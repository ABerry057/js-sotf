<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review 30:2 (2006), 231-253 MEDIATING JUDAISM: MIND, BODY, SPIRIT, AND CONTEMPORARY NORTH AMERICAN JEWISH FICTION by Sara R. Horowitz That Jewish literature in North America is an altogether secular venue has long been regarded as a truism among many influential literary scholars. Indeed, for much of the twentieth century, the fiction of Jewish immigrants and their progeny wrote its way into American and Canadian culture through narratives that captured the process of acculturation by distancing itself from Jewish traditional practices, construed mockingly or nostalgically as relics of a European life left behind, a wellspring of historical or textual memories that oppress or elevate. The few departures from this trend-fiction that represents Judaic ritual and experience sympathetically, with complexity and depth-are exceptions that prove the rule: Chaim Potok's novels, for example, beginning in the late 1960s and continuing through the close of the twentieth century, and a handful of women novelists negotiating Jewish feminism in stories and novels of the 1980s and 1990s. One could argue that for generations of Jewish North American writers and their readers, literature served, in a sense, as an alternative grounding for Jewish ethics and values that in the past had been derived more directly from religious learning and practice or from the mores of a more tightly bound community. Many readers have discerned the influence of Jewish texts or history, the inflection of Jewish languages, or the underpinning of Jewish ethics in this body of writing. Following trends in European Jewish literary modernism that mapped out points of pressure and rupture as modernity, secularization, and acculturation pulled at Jewish tradition, North American Jewish fiction most often brought these Jewish resonances to bear in the service of a new American amalgam that was removed from the daily experience of Jewish religious and ritual life. On a concrete level, the depiction of religiously observant characters-when they appeared at all in North American Jewish fiction-was often set safely in the past, in stories of origins and departures. Sometimes, set in the present, Orthodox Jewish characters represented markers of the past, bearing the weight of the Jewish experience in the double sense of gravitas and burden. However, since the mid- 1990s, there has been a virtual explosion of Jewish fiction in North America that places Judaism, ritually observant Jewish characters, and traditional religious communities at the center. In these works, the lives of the characters pivot on their ritual observances. Put simply, daily life is Jewish life. The proliferation of novels and stories about Jewish people pursuing lives in serious relationship to religious communities and practices has not yet been fully examined as a North American 231</page><page sequence="2">Sara R. Horowitz cultural phenomenon. However, an extended discussion of this imagined Judaism, sparked by an essay in the January 30, 2005, issue of the New York Times Book Review, has taken place across a range of popular media. The arguments marshaled by the essay, its supporters, and its critics, offer a snapshot of a particular cultural moment in Jewish North American letters. Highly critical of contemporary fiction's portrayal of Orthodox Judaism and Orthodox Jewish characters, the New York Times essay, titled "The Observant Reader," castigates in stern and elaborate terms the ways in which most contem- porary Jewish authors in North America represent the world of Orthodox Judaism.' Characterizing their works as profoundly hostile to halakhic Judaism, the essay presents detailed criticisms of the portrayal of religious characters in specific novels and short stories. More surprisingly, the essay also criticizes the (presumed) religious practices and views of the authors themselves. The review prompted an abundance of cultural discussion in the Jewish and secular presses; in op-eds, letters to the editor, and other review essays; and in Jewish and literary blogs.2 Taken together, the review and ensuing impassioned exchanges about the representation of Orthodox Judaism in contemporary North American fiction capture a particular cultural moment, not only in the world of belles lettres and not only among Jewish writers and readers. The debate raises important questions about literature and its relationship to religious belief and practice, to cultural rupture and cohesion, and, more broadly, to issues of belonging and exclusion.

A brief precis of the essay will suffice to highlight the points of contention. "The Observant Reader" was a failed book review written by Wendy Shalit that was expanded into an issue-based essay at the encouragement of Book Review editor Sam Tanenhaus. Because the life trajectories and religious biographies of Shalit, the authors she discusses, and those who responded to her critique have been central to the development of the debate, I begin with some biographical information. Shalit is the author of A Return to Modesty: Discovering the Lost Virtue, which she published in 1999 at age twenty-three.3 An extended defense of chastity and traditional gender difference, the book emerged from a Commen- tary article documenting the author's personal battle against coed dormitories as an undergraduate at Williams College. As she explains in the book, the review, and in a subsequent article defending the review, Shalit grew up in a secular Jewish home but adopted Orthodox belief and practice as a young adult; she is a ba 'alat teshuvah, a newly observant Jew.4 "The Observant Reader" takes aim at the ways in which Shalit believes Orthodox Jews and Orthodox Judaism are depicted in contemporary Jewish American letters. Looking at the works of a short list of writers while asserting more broad-based claims for contemporary Jewish fiction, the essay argues that Orthodox Jews-especially ultra-Orthodox, or haredi Jews-are portrayed by Jewish writers as "hypocrites," outrageously and secretly transgressive. These imaginary Jews engage in forbidden sexual acts, gorge on forbidden foods behind closed doors, and generally fear the approbation of their neighbors more than they fear the wrath of God. At best, Shalit argues, they are presented as fum- bling, superficial, scrawny, dowdy, desexualized, or perverted. Missing, she avers, are images of good, consistent, fulfilled observant Jews, set in the context of the "idealism" that drives their life commitments. Shalit castigates a cluster of contem- porary Jewish North American writers for their misrepresentation of Orthodox Judaism and Orthodox Jews, either out of ignorance or malice. Fictional haredim, she argues, are radically unlike their real-life counterparts. The essay, however, takes issue as much with these fictional portrayals as with the lives and faith commitments of the authors of these fictional works. The authors' negative or unresolved feelings about their own Jewishness, the essay asserts, drive their writing, or their ignorance distorts their fictive worlds. Ultimately, Shalit asks, what authorizes these writers to create works of fiction that depict Orthodox Judaism? As lapsed Jews (what Shalit terms "authors who have renounced Orthodox Judaism") or uneducated Jews (authors who "were never really exposed" to 3.

Jewish World Review, February 15, 2005, www.jewishworldreview.com/0205/shalitreplies.php3. This column has been reprinted on several Web sites, especially those associated with Orthodox institutions, such as http://aish.com. 233</page><page sequence="4">Sara R. Horowitz Orthodox Judaism), she deems them unqualified to write about committed Judaism. The authors-whom Shalit refers to in her "Orthodox Fiction" essay as "Ortho- bashers"-portray "deeply observant Jews in an unflattering or ridiculous light."5 Although Shalit half concedes that some of this writing might be "first-rate literature," she worries that it gives "many people" mistaken ideas about Orthodox Judaism.6 At the heart of the essay is Shalit's division of contemporary Jewish American authors into "outsiders" and "insiders." Outsiders are strangers to the religious way of life and thus can depict it only superficially. Insiders know the Orthodox world because they inhabit it, and their books reflect this experiential intimacy. The essay further divides insiders into two subcategories, "outsider insi- ders" and "insiders' insiders." "Outsider insiders" are authors who either were once Orthodox but have drifted from or repudiated that way of life or pretend to be a part of the religious world but, in actuality, are not. As Shalit describes them, they "write about a community they may never have been part of."7 "Insiders' insiders," the ultimate insiders, embrace Orthodox, especially haredi practices and beliefs, and portray this positively in their fiction. Based on biogra- phical information gleaned from publicists, Web sites, mutual acquaintances, and literary scuttlebutt or extrapolated from the authors' fictional writing, Shalit assigns writers to a category of belonging. Not surprisingly, given the haredi denigration of modem cultural production, Shalit finds true insider authors a rare breed. The vast majority of seeming insiders, the essay asserts, "purported to explain the ultra-Orthodox from an insider's perspective" without actually writing from the inside.8 Thus, the outsider insider poses as a native informant but is not. Into this category Shalit places such writers as Nathan Englander (For the Relief of Unbearable Urges), Jonathan Rosen (Joy Comes in the Morning), Tova Reich (Master of the Return), and Tova Mirvis (The Outside World).9 Englander, for example, has noted in interviews that he found yeshiva education "anti-intellectual" and no longer keeps kosher, and yet he writes fiction about characters who do. Jonathan Rosen, in Shalit's reading, "dismisses modem Orthodox"' through fic- tional characters who reflect negatively on Judaism or who embody hypocritical or unappealing attributes; Tova Reich, although raised in a traditional home, writes about rabbis who gorge themselves on Yom Kippur, chase women, or give their toddlers marijuana; and Tova Mirvis, who grew up in a modem Orthodox house- hold, has not "logged real time among the haredi."" Moreover, Shalit reads their 5. Shalit, "The Observant Reader," 16. 6. Ibid. 7. Ibid. 8. Ibid. 9.

"[T]his kind of 'insider' fiction actually reveals the authors' estrangement from the traditional Orthodox community, and sometimes from Judaism itself."12 By contrast, in the insiders' insider category, Shalit places such authors as Risa Miller (Heavenly Heights) and Ruchama King (Seven Blessings)-"newly religious Jews that Mirvis, Englander and others describe but don't quite understand."'3 The printed responses and online Listserv, zine, and blog commentaries that followed Shalit's essay focus on a set of related issues: (1) Was Shalit correct in her characterization of authors as insiders or outsiders-that is, did she get it right when she described their level of Jewish observance in childhood and now? (2) Even if correct, were these biographical details relevant to her evaluation of their books? Several respondents termed her analysis a "tzitzit check," comparing her scrutiny of authorial religious observances to the practice of verifying that yeshiva boys were wearing ritual fringes under their garments;'4 Mirvis coined the phrase "shaitel check," referring to the wigs worn by married Jewish women out of ritual modesty.'5 (3) Were the depictions of the religious Jews in the novels accurate or off the mark-that is, did the literary portrayals conform to the real-life behavior of Jews in these communities? Were the details of obser- vance, dress, and thought accurately portrayed? Did the authors misrepresent the inner workings of religious Jews and their communities out of ignorance-that is, as outsiders, did they hit wrong notes and misconstrue ritual practices? (4) Were the portrayals that Shalit characterized as negative indeed so, and if so, does this constitute an aesthetic flaw or an ethical shortcoming in the novels and stories? Many respondents criticized Shalit for "reading fiction as sociology" rather than as imaginative writing (although such disciplinary crossing is not inherently problematic).16 There were repeated citations of Cynthia Ozick's remark in Quarrel and Quandary, which distinguishes the stringent ethical and ritual requirements of Judaism from the boundless freedom of literary imagination: "Fiction has license to do anything it pleases. Fiction is liberty at its purest.""17 Who would have imagined that such a debate about Jewish American letters would ensue as we plunge into the twenty-first century? Not so long ago, virtually all scholars read Jewish literature in North America as a secular discourse, however much its texts might gesture to religious texts, ritual practices, and remembered communities. Literary works might be hostile, indifferent, or nostal- gic toward Jewish religious observance, but they rarely engaged with the Jewish religious experience in a complicated and nuanced fashion.

Horowitz literature represented such social phenomena as immigration, acculturation, assimilation, and exclusion and grappled with such existential issues as historical trauma and ethics. But no one, it seems, expected it to deal fairly-indeed, at all- with Judaism as a religion. Why, at this particular cultural moment, might one expect Jewish American letters to engage with traditional Jewish life and, more- over, do so with kindness? The novels and short fiction cited in this literary debate-indeed, the debate itself-signify a critical shift from considering Jewishness as a North American ethnicity or subculture to thinking about Judaism as religion. This move reflects a broader academic interest in religion. In a column in the Chronicle of Higher Education, for example, Stanley Fish observes that "the academy is finally catching up" with American culture by "tak[ing] religion seriously" rather than treating it condescendingly "as a way of thinking that we have moved beyond." Once dismissed by a largely secular academy, religion, Fish notes, "is now where the action is." When Jacques Derrida died, he writes, "I was called by a reporter who wanted know what would succeed high theory and the triumvirate of race, gender, and class as the center of intellectual energy in the academy. I answered like a shot: religion."1'8 That the American literary imagination may plumb the religious experience in multivariate aesthetic forms is not, of course, a new idea. Many authors have been read for the religious ideas that inform their narratives. But the terms of the Shalit debate center on the extent to which characters (and sometimes their authors) conform to the religious norms of their community, providing positive role models that might, as Shalit hopefully writes, "succeed in converting some of those outsider insiders" to a religiously observant life.19 I would like to disrupt the debate, first by querying the didactic considerations that impelled it. Shalit's cri- ticism of contemporary novels featuring religious Jewish characters suggests that she affirms the possibility that novels may serve as vehicles for straightforward moral instruction, as tools for the attainment and maintenance of traditional cultural literacy. More than that, Shalit's desire for novels that "convert" readers or that affirm the rightness of piety implies that novels instruct readers by presenting char- acters who exemplify the mores of the religious community, who present the com- munity's best image of itself, and who can serve as role models for their readers. Shalit's critique is interesting for its focus on the mass trade novels aimed at the general reading public rather than the more limited body of American novels published by religious presses, which are developed as a soft form of religious 18. Stanley Fish, "One University under God?" Chronicle of Higher Education, January 7, 2005, C1. 19. Shalit, "The Observant Reader," 17. Shalit's evaluation of the representation of Orthodox characters in contemporary American Jewish fiction resembles some of the earnest, well-intentioned, but often simplistic early feminist critiques of novels and films, which looked for "strong," "positive" female figures to serve as role models for readers. Similarly, Herman S. Gray notes that "the still entrenched language of positive or negative images, polemics about the commodification of blackness, and the endless search for authenticating narratives have come under critical scrutiny and finally been put to rest." Gray, Cultural Moves: African Americans and the Politics of Representation (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005), 15. 236</page><page sequence="7">Mind, Body, Spirit, and Contemporary North American Jewish Fiction instruction. Jeffrey Shandler, for example, notes the phenomenon of rabbinically endorsed "entertainment literature" in Yiddish, marketed in the Brooklyn haredi neighborhood of Boro Park and guaranteed by their publishers to be "worthy of being brought in to respectable Jewish homes."20 But such novels function as a form of gatekeeping-providing acceptable genre novels, for example, to discou- rage haredi readers from turning to books that carry the influence of outside cultures and may introduce them to values that contradict their own. Shalit's focus, by contrast, is a body of literature aimed at a diverse readership who is not part of the haredi world. In that context, the essay's concern that haredi life be presented sympathetically is as much an issue of moral instruction as it is a matter of self-presentation to the multiculture of American society. In other words, Shalit's essay suggests that, for some readers, novels function as a form of kiruv, a term for bringing nonobservant Jews into the religious world. For other readers, the novels serve to deexoticize a culture that is viewed as radically alien. Thus, "The Observant Reader" argues for a literature that sympathetically depicts Orthodox characters who live out their piety in consistent and life- affirming ways. In this sense, the essay does not draw a distinction between didac- tic literature produced within and for an "insider" haredi audience and imaginative literature aimed at a broader audience.21 The difference, however, is crucial in understanding how the "liberty" of imaginative literature, as Ozick puts it, might function in an encounter with the religious imagination. To the extent that they succeed aesthetically, the novels discussed in Shalit's essay rely on a thick description of the symbols, practices, and meanings of religious culture. I borrow the term "thick description" from anthropology, where it was introduced by Clifford Geertz in The Interpretation of Culture to connote a particular meth- odological approach to ethnography.22 According to Geertz, thick description of a culture-that is, richly detailed descriptions of behaviors contextualized in the symbolic system (or "web of significance") that makes them meaningful- brings the observer ever closer to understanding the intricacies of a particular culture. "Believing," he notes, "that man is an animal suspended in webs of sig- nificance he himself has spun, I take culture to be those webs."23 Geertz's use of "thick description" has become a staple in religious studies in North America. According to Geertz, all cultures comprise "a multiplicity of complex conceptual structures, many of them superimposed on or knotted into one another, which are at once strange, irregular, and inexplicit."24 To analyze a culture is to interpret the behaviors of its people in the context of the structures 20. Jeffrey Shandler, "Shopping for Yiddish in Boro Park," Pakn Treger 40 (Fall 2002): 24. 21. Though Shalit dismisses such didactic novels-the "officially 'kosher' " works produced in the haredi community-in her essay "Must Orthodox Fiction Be So Fictional," her critique in "The Observant Reader" makes little allowance for works that are not "kosher." 22. Clifford Geertz, The Interpretation of Cultures (New York: Basic Books, 1973). Geertz draws the term from Gilbert Ryle. 23. Geertz, The Interpretation of Cultures, 5. 24. Ibid., 10. 237</page><page sequence="8">Sara R. Horowitz of meaning that give these behaviors significance. "When we say we do not understand the actions of people from a culture other than our own," Geertz explains, "we are acknowledging our 'lack of familiarity with the imaginative universe within which their acts are signs."'25 In approaching the questions raised in the debate over Shalit's essay, following Geertz, we would shift from Shalit's focus on whether each Orthodox character is portrayed in a positive light to whether the novel entails a symbolic system that adequately embodies a thick description of the communities they portray. Accordingly, whether a newly Orthodox woman might sometimes give in to her yearning for shrimp salad (as in Tova Mirvis's novel The Ladies Auxiliary), or whether an Orthodox man might scrupulously observe the laws of kashrut but easily cheat on his fiance (as in Jonathan Rosen's Joy Comes in the Morning), or whether a haredi community might remain indifferent to the fate of a missing girl (as in Tova Reich's "The Lost Girl")-all points of contention in the debate we have been fol- lowing-is less significant than examining whether and how the narratives convey the nuances of meaning such behaviors might have in the symbolic systems the characters inhabit. Interestingly, Geertz likens his methodology of ethnographic analysis to the literary analysis of text: Both, he notes, are a form of "sorting out the structures of signification ... and determining their social ground and import .... Doing ethnography is like trying to read (in the sense of 'construct a reading of') a manuscript."26 As Geertz notes, "A good interpretation of anything-a poem, a person, a history, a ritual, an institution, a society-takes us into the heart of that of which it is the interpretation.'"27 A thick reading teases out the layers of meaning and the dramatic signifi- cance of even small gestures. It exposes a culture's conceptual systems and the ways in which these symbolic structures may differ for each person or may be slightly out of sync within a community. Reading the engagement party scene in Tova Mirvis's novel The Outside World offers an illustration. The novel follows the subtle courtship of two ultra-Orthodox young adults, Tzippy and Baruch. Tzippy is the oldest of five daughters in a haredi family in Brooklyn. Rebelling against the predictable pattern of arranged shidduch dates in the relent- less march to the "big wedding" and married life, Tzippy flees to Israel, ostensibly to study at a religious girls' seminary but really to buy some measure of freedom for herself. Studying in Israel puts some distance between her and her controlling mother and deflects the close and persistent scrutiny of their insular community. Baruch, in contrast, was raised as Bryan in a modem Orthodox home in New Jersey. Deferring his admittance to an Ivy League university, he studied at a yeshiva in Israel during the gap year-the year between high school and university-following the accepted educational pattern among his family's reli- gious cohorts. Early in the novel, we learn that Bryan had been drawn into the yeshiva world and "had undergone some transformation his parents couldn't 25. Ibid., 12-13. 26. Ibid., 10. 27. Ibid., 16. 238</page><page sequence="9">Mind, Body, Spirit, and Contemporary North American Jewish Fiction understand."28 Rejecting his English name in favor of the Hebrew, Baruch chose to continue his studies at the yeshiva rather than pursue a secular higher education at Columbia University. The couple's courtship begins in Jerusalem at Tzippy's initiative, outside the surveillance of their respective families. Eventually they announce their engagement. At a party in the home of Baruch's parents, the couple catches a moment alone in the backyard, away from the crowd. In the following scene, the two touch for the first time: They sat next to each other, on chairs whose legs were touching. Tzippy's and Baruch's arms almost touched as well. She was scared of what she would feel and scared of how he would react, scared that he would pull away in horror and scared that he would not. But she couldn't stop herself. She leaned toward him and grazed his hand with two of her fingers. It was so light, so soft, that it could have been imagined or wished. She did it again, to be sure it had really happened. She ran her fingers across his hand, and her body tingled with the shock and pleasure of actually touching. Too thrilled and scared to move her hand, she waited to see what would happen next. He held her hand. He gently stroked her fingers. He wanted to touch her face, which he had stared at these past few months. He wanted to kiss her mouth, which distracted him when he learned, when he davened, when he slept. He put his arms around her and she leaned in close, their bodies gently pressing against each other. Just as his lips were about to find hers, a looming figure appeared in Baruch's head. It was the face of his rabbi, who whispered in his ear, "So you haven't changed after all." If he leaned any closer to Tzippy, these words would become true. One kiss and he would disappear. Guilt outpaced desire and he pulled away.... It was dangerous to walk the edges. That was where people got lost. Baruch stood up and turned around. They both tried to pretend it hadn't happened. As they went inside, though, the initial touch replayed itself in their heads, mirrored back from every angle. A hundred hands reached for each other. A thousand fingers intertwined.29 The scene depends on the reader's understanding of the sexual code determined by the couple's religious observance, which gives their gestures complex meanings. It depends, as well, on each character's individual relationship to his or her commu- nity of origin and community of choice. Tzippy and Baruch have scrupulously observed the laws of negiya, which mandate that unmarried men and women refrain from any sort of touclh whatsoever. The utter physical separation before marriage lends tremendous sexual power to even the slightest touch. But sexual prohibitions do not stand in isolation: They are part of an interlocking system of laws and customs, each seen in its smallest detail as undergirding or undermin- ing the whole. Tzippy and Baruch inhabit this symbolic system and understand 28. Mirvis, The Outside World, 27. 29. Ibid., 124-25. 239</page><page sequence="10">Sara R. Horowitz the significance of even minimal gestures. Their shared religious culture drives the scene as Mirvis constructs it. The scene also depends on their different-one might even say opposing- life trajectories. Baruch has moved away from a modem Orthodox sensibility, a network of beliefs and behaviors that affirms the "integration of religious and secular" knowledge and values.30 He has entered into an exclusionary religious sphere, the haredi community, that rejects integration with the secular (although not as imperviously as it purports to do so). Although conventions of sexual modesty and restraint operate in the modem Orthodox world as well, in actuality, that community sanctions a wider range of behavior. As an adolescent, Baruch and his friends dated girls, kissed, touched. In the imagined voice of his ultra-Orthodox rabbi, Baruch hears the system he has adopted come into conflict not only with bodily desire but also with the system in which he was raised. The vision of the rabbi evokes a well-known midrash on the story of Joseph and Potiphar's wife in Genesis 39, in which the image of Joseph's father (dyukno shel 'aviv) appears before Joseph just as he is about to enter into an adulterous relationship with the wife of his master.31 Jacob warns Joseph that if he sins with Potiphar's wife, his name will be erased from the 'efod, or breastplate, of the high priest-that is, he will not be counted with his brothers among the tribes of Israel. In the midrash, the image of the father acts as an antidote to (forbidden) sexual desire, interrupting transgressive behavior and indicating where the borderline of religious belonging must be drawn. In Mirvis's novel, it is the image and voice of the rabbi who heads the yeshiva where Baruch studies-rather than those of Baruch's father-that intervene, underscoring the young man's movement from one set of religious values to a different (albeit related) one. Touching a woman becomes a litmus of religious membership and sexual restraint a crucible for extended sets of meaning. Tzippy's trajectory is different. Though she is still a part of the haredi community, her journey to Israel is a move away from the mores of her parents and cohorts, if only in her mind. Whereas Baruch rejects his parents' dream of an Ivy League education, Tzippy harbors forbidden thoughts about studying in college-thoughts that are as loaded as her gentle touch in the backyard. This grazing of her fiance's hand is part of her push against the boundaries that constrain her, the boundaries of a community whose hold on her is weakening. Mirvis's novel captures the shifts between overlaying webs of signification of different Orthodox communities whose separation is not impervious. The power of the internalized voice of Baruch's rabbi and the actualization of Tzippy's forbidden fantasy point to the instability of religious identity for these characters. The backyard encounter between Tzippy and Baruch is one among many moments that deepen the sense of the beliefs and practices of overlapping religious communities and the modulation of individual desire within these contexts. That 30. Ibid., 26. 31. B. Sotah 36b. 240</page><page sequence="11">Mind, Body, Spirit, and Contemporary North American Jewish Fiction the narrative does not privilege any one modality is an indication that the novel is not intended as a book of moral instruction in the manner of didactic haredi literature. Instead, the novel offers a growing sense of the complexity and diversity of religious experience within American Orthodox Judaism. Whom do Shalit and her interlocutors imagine to be the audience for the novels and stories they argue about-and how might different ideas of audience shift the debate? In contending with these questions, I would like to trouble the insider-outsider dichotomy that drives Shalit's essay and much of the response to it. Although Shalit's essay is predicated on a distinction between Jews as members of an ethnicity and Jews as members of a faith community, the terms the essay introduces-insiders and outsiders, authenticity and stereotype-have long been the staple of ethnic studies. The issue of who "belongs" to-and thus has the right to speak for and about-an ethnic group has been a contentious point not only in literary and cultural studies but even in university hiring. The relevance of the ethnicity, race, or gender of scholars who work and teach African American literature, or Jewish Studies, or Islamic studies, or women's studies, or transgender studies, or queer studies is debated repeatedly and heatedly. Moreover, as African American film scholar Ed Guerrero once remarked, scholars tend to be dissatisfied with the portrayal of their own ethnic groups in popular culture. For example, contrary to the public acclaim, many Jewish scholars and critics had deep reservations about Steven Spielberg's film adaptation of Thomas Keneally's novel Schindler's List, and many African American scholars and critics criticized Spielberg's adaptation of Alice Walker's novel The Color Purple. In Cultural Moves: African Americans and the Politics of Representation, Herman S. Gray points to the dissatisfaction of African American "media activists and cultural critics" with "black visibility and represen- tation" in the media and popular culture, noting the inherent conflict between calls for more "images that more positively and satisfyingly represent blackness" and more "realistic representations."32 The scrutiny of others, the dual position of being both spectator and object in the cinema-that is, looking at the characters onscreen and, at the same time, identifying with them-is a discordant and discomfiting experience. In her 1990 volume on creative and critical writing by women of color, Making Face, Making Soul, Gloria Anzaldifa describes the dynamics of her uni- versity colloquium on feminism and women of color. Although the course was open to all, the author noted that "[t]he problem was that whitewomen and white Jewishwomen, while seeming to listen, were not really 'hearing' women- of-color and could not get it into their heads that this was a space and class on and about women-of-color."33 Similarly, in A Sitdown with the Sopranos, a 2002 collection of academic essays about the depiction of Italian Americans in the fabulously popular television series, editor Regina Barreca limited contributors 32.

Horowitz to Italian Americans like herself. Defending this choice in the introduction to the volume, Barreca explains: Our heritage and our parochialism inform our responses as viewers .... What is significant is the fact that you have to earn the membership to the inside group: you must be initiated. Ethnicity works the same way. Would you tell a joke about a Dubliner if you were at an Irish pub-and you weren't Irish? Would you make an Amos and Andy joke if you were on stage at the Apollo theater? Would you tell an Italian joke at a Sons of Italy meeting if you weren't Italian? You would know better than to assume that you under- stood fully what it was like to be in that group if you were dealing with members of that group, right?34 Like Shalit, Anzaldfia and Barreca position themselves and their communities as insiders who mediate not only their own culture but also cultural productions about their culture for outsiders. Such an approach rests on the presumption of neat and stable boundaries between inside and outside and between insiders and outsiders. It assumes that the location of the borderline and the identity of the speakers can be determined singularly and as a matter of fact. Not merely the best but the only legitimate vantage point is from within. However, the borderline of belonging is less fixed and more fluid, not only for ethnicity but also for religious membership. For example, modem Orthodox Judaism exists at the interstices of the religious and secular worlds, or, to put it more accurately, it constructs for itself a worldview using bits imported from many sources. Even the more exclusionary ultra- Orthodox community is not wholly separated from the dominant culture. Pearl Abraham's novel The Romance Reader, for example, gives a sense of the fantasies about American life that haredi girls develop.35 Rachel, the oldest child of a hasidic rebbe in upstate New York, struggles against the close scrutiny of her father's community and the minute strictures that regulate and restrict all aspects of her life. Her cultural curiosity and inner rebelliousness finds an outlet in reading paperback romance novels, a forbidden but tolerated activity (at least for girls). In her actual life, Rachel must wear colored opaque stockings or flesh-tinted hose with seams, so that no one mistakes fabric for flesh. In her dream life, she imagines an elaborate romantic fantasy involving Mr. Gartner, owner of the inn where she works as a lifeguard, replete with cowboy hat, large bed, roasted pheasant, red lace underwear, and black silk stockings. These fanta- sies affect the shape of desires, inflecting the inner lives of haredi girls. Abraham's novel about contemporary haredi adolescent girls evokes the world of women in traditional eastern European Jewish cultures a hundred years ago, who also read 34.

Then, as now, occasions for culture crossing were in abundance-in the market, the workplace, the subway. In con- temporary culture, it is not simply a question of porous boundaries. In the novels and stories brought into the current debate, the borders are not fixed at all, although they may sometimes appear to be. Responding to Shalit's comments about his novel, Jonathan Rosen notes that, for the characters in Joy Comes in the Morning, "The boundaries of Judaism are fluid ... as they are in real life."36 Rather than dividing neatly into definable categories, such as secular, newly, and formerly Orthodox (the outsiders, insiders' insiders, and outsider insiders of Shalit's essay), Jews move in and out of communities at different times in their lives, and sometimes different times of the day. This fluidity within the contemporary Jewish experience is a mark of the integration and acculturation of Jews in North America. It is also part of a larger cultural consciousness of the constructedness-hence the nonfixed quality-of identity, involving a heightened sense of the instability of the boundaries of belonging and of ethnic, gender, cultural, and religious identity. In explaining why she included only Italian American critics in A Sitdown with the Sopranos, Barreca leaps from a consideration of culture mediators as audience-"our responses as viewers"-to a description of them as performers. Barreca's illustrations of the inauthentic or unauthorized cultural voices of outsi- ders all hinge on the metaphor of performance: telling jokes at a pub, on stage, or at a meeting. Barreca's introduction begins by positing three positions-the objects of cultural production (The Sopranos), their legitimate interpreters (the contributors to the volume), and the audience of outsiders-but her metaphor collapses these into two categories, performers/performance and audience, which reduces finally to only one category: insiders, interchangeably performing and spectating. Shalit's essay, too, presumes three positions, although somewhat different ones: cultural production (ultra-Orthodox characters), their mediators (novelists), and readers (or audience). Here, too, the three categories quickly col- lapse into two: characters (living or imagined) and audience, with the first category expanding to include Shalit as well. Ultimately, with the vision of the "converted" reader, the essay aspires to a similar reduction to a single position: insider. Although Shalit does not evoke concrete images of spectacle and theater in the way that Barreca's metaphor does, "The Observant Reader," too, centers on issues of performativity. In linking the faith commitments of the authors with the behavior of the imaginary characters of their novels, the essay suggests that writers self-reflexively perform their Jewishness through their characters' speech and actions. Like Barreca's introduction, the essay insists on defining auth- entic and inauthentic performances-that is, performances by insiders and outsi- ders. Both Barreca and Shalit function as gatekeepers-that is, as arbiters of who belongs and who does not-Barreca through her function as editor, Shalit through her approbation of certain novels over others. As such, in the context of their respective writing, they assert their credentials and perform their ethnicity 36.

Shalit briefly narrates a journey from benighted prejudice against the strangeness of "black hats and side curls ... a group of men wearing odd fur hats" to the traditional practices of Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox Judaism.37 It is no coincidence that both essays bring performativity to bear on issues of membership and authenticity. One characteristic of the cultural moment in which both Barreca and Shalit write is the fluidity of roles and identities, something Shalit herself alludes to when she notes, "Some of my Jewish friends have intermarried with people of other faiths; others have gone back to their traditional roots," a phenomenon that many of the respondents to "The Observant Reader" also note.38 Indeed, the path Shalit briefly charts of her own evolution-an American Reform Jew who encounters the strangeness of haredi Judaism in Jerusalem, studies at an Israeli all-girls seminary, and returns to North America as an Orthodox Jew-exemplifies the quintessentially American (but also postmodern) proclivity for reinventing the self. The openness of North American culture to such reinvention, hybridization, and acculturation disrupts fundamental ordering categories. The always-open invi- tation to self-redefinition involves a deconstruction and reconstruction of the self that evokes powerful feelings of anxiety emerging from the perceived element of ambiguity and heightened sense of the contingency of identity. In analyzing the significance of liminality in religious ritual, Victor Turner notes an intensification of identity performances during moments of cultural crisis and reintegration. That is, during times of social change that challenge traditional ways of viewing cul- tures and cultural membership, people become more aware of the impermanence, perhaps even arbitrariness, of identity and the instability of communal boundaries. "Ritual and drama involves selves, not self," Turner observes. Moreover, in performance, "The 'self' is split up the middle-it is something that one both is and that one sees and, furthermore, acts upon as though it were another."39 Turner focuses on the ways in which performance (especially ritual) operates on the "threshold," enacting and then resolving liminality, or in-betweenness. "The dominant genres of performance in societies at all levels of scale and complexity tend to be liminal phenomena.... both the performances and their settings may be likened to loops in a linear progression, when the social flow bends back on itself, in a way does violence to its own development, meanders, inverts, perhaps lies to itself, and puts everything so to speak in the subjunctive mood as well as the reflexive voice."40 Because "liminal entities are neither here nor there ... betwixt and between the positions assigned and arrayed by law, custom, conven- tion, and ceremonial," the resolution of ritual performance traditionally results in a restoration of stability to identity, community, and boundaries, thereby relieving the discomfort of ambivalence.41 In that sense, Anzalduia's, Barreca's, and 37.

For North American Jews, the present sense of cultural crisis is linked not only to the postmodern unraveling of race and gender but also to the ongoing negotiation of race, gender, and ethnicity in America. Pointing to a fundamental and enduring liminality, in their introduction to Insider/Outsider.: American Jews and Multiculturalism, David Biale, Michael Galchinsky, and Susannah Heschel refer to the American Jewish self-perception of occupying a "liminal zone," an "anomalous status: insiders who are outsiders and outsiders who are insiders ... a boundary case whose very lack of belonging to a recognizable cat- egory creates a sense of unease."42 In How Jews Became White Folks, Karen Brodkin explores changes in the construction of American Jewish ethnoracial identities in light of the evolving classification of race in America. Brodkin notes that Jews experience "racial middleness ... an experience of marginality vis-at-vis whiteness and an experience of whiteness and belonging vis-a-vis black- ness."43 Vincent Brook notes that the "constructed and highly contested nature of Jewish identity" is crucial in explaining the proliferation of Jewish characters on televisions sitcoms from 1989 onward-the same period that has seen a marked increase in the publication of Jewish North American novels featuring religious Jewish characters.44 Brooks links the trend in television sitcoms with "a complex negotiation of assimilationist and multiculturalist pressures specific to the American Jewish experience. While appearing to be a breakthrough in Jewish representation, the trend also points to a renewed crisis in Jewish identity formation" brought on by a tension between assimilation into the mainstream and maintaining Jewish difference, a disruption of "the delicate balance between the senses of 'sameness' and of 'otherness"' that define the construction of Jewish American identity.45 Though Shalit isolates the ritual observance of Judaism from other aspects of North American Jewishness, the authors she treats present Jewish characters negotiating religious practices against the wider backdrop of North American life and culture. Their ritual performances negotiate the pressures of ambivalence. Whereas Geertz notes the affirmative function of ritual performances, a dynamic whereby "the world as lived and the world as imagined, fuse under the agency of a single set of symbolic forms," Turner also points to the potential of per- formance to destabilize.46 As such, performance makes visible the dynamic aspect of culture, in contrast to what Turner sees as the "static models for thought and 42.

Horowitz action," such as "cosmologies, theologies, philosophical systems, ethical systems, and ideologies."47 In that sense, performance challenges what are perceived as fixed norms, destabilizing the boundaries between self and other, insider and out- sider, belonging and exclusion. In resolving liminal states, the dynamics of per- formance may reassert firm boundaries, reshape cultural norms, and open up new cultural possibilities that then become the norm. At some level, these dynamics denaturalize the sense of wholeness of both communal and individual identity, revealing complicated sets of interactions between individuals within a community and between individuals and their communities. Even while reasserting a percep- tion of cultural stability, liminal performances also reveal the provisional nature of inside and outside, challenging such binary categories. Many contemporary Jewish American novels turn on the performative aspect of identity, focusing on liminal moments that reveal religious identity as dynamic rather than static. In Mirvis's The Outside World, clothing is strongly connected to identity performance. As Ann Rosalind Jones and Peter Stallybrass demonstrate in their work on everyday and performance dress during the Renais- sance, clothing functions as both the "material memories" of the wearer and "a currency whose circulation unmakes and remakes the subject"; changes of clothes function as both a demonstration of and a vehicle for identity shifts.48 Baruch's transition from modem Orthodox norms to haredi practices and the corresponding but opposing movement of his sister Ilana from modem Orthodox toward increased liberalization are signaled by their self-conscious changes of clothing. Both enact their desired identity by dressing the part, in ways that impli- cate desire, discipline, and gender performance. When Baruch returns home from Israel, his inner change is made visible by the clothing he wears. He appears in the garb of the haredi yeshiva where he studied-white shirt, dark jacket, and black fedora. At home, feeling that the sureties that come with the fusion of the religious symbolic system and everyday life "which had existed so fully in yeshiva, threatened to collapse," Baruch sets about purging his room-in particular, his clothes closet-of all that metonymically recreates his prior identity as a modem Orthodox young man.49 He creates a pile of detritus from his former life. His bulletin board was covered with old sports schedules and pictures from camp with his arms around various girls.... his high school yearbook, his guide to the SATs, his copies of Sports Illustrated (regular and swimsuit).... the knit yarmulkes he had once worn. They were a Modern Orthodox mating ritual, crocheted by girls as flirtatious gestures and inscribed in con- trasting colors. 'To Bryan, Luv Hadassah,' one cooed. 'Friends 4-ever,' another promised.... They were the religious equivalent of a sports car, and Baruch had traded his in for a somber four-door: the black velvet yarmulke. He paused only when he came to his Yankees cap.... He would never wear 47. Turner, The Anthropology of Performance, 84-85. 48.

One day he would take it out and marvel at who he had once been.... Toward the front [of the closet] were the new clothes he had bought in Israel: identical black dress pants next to identical white long-sleeved shirts. Pushed to the back were Tommy Hilfiger shirts and Gap blue jeans, Nike sneakers and cable-knit sweaters. Rabbi Rothstein had made it clear that such clothes were a way of imitating the non-Jews, a modem-day idolatry.... if it weren't illegal in Laurelwood, he would have made a bonfire and set them aflame.50 Baruch refers to this purge, this giving up of what he once held dear-what defined "who he had once been"-as "his karban olah, his burnt offering," an act of true worship that contrasts with the cultural symbols that his rabbi has termed idolatrous practices or false worship. In a final flourish, he tosses the Columbia University sweatshirt that his father gave him, a sign of the now- repudiated promise of an Ivy League (secular) education. This he terms his "karban chatat," the sin offering required of penitents in ancient times."5 In linking his housekeeping with a sacrificial ritual of the ancient Temple designed to bring the transgressive outsider back into the fold of the people, Baruch creates a purging ritual that is intended to resolve the liminality of being between two different (albeit related) sets of symbolic systems and to solidify his belonging to his desired community. The purging ritual is also a way of disci- plining the body, removing from his possession the objects that link him with physical pleasure-either sports or sexuality. The "regular and swimsuit" issues of Sports Illustrated link the gendered desires that are accepted in modem Ortho- dox mores to a haredi masculine identity that must be disciplined and tightly controlled. The knit yarmulkes wom by modem Orthodox men, bearing the "flir- tatious gestures" of women, are revealed as sham rather than sacred objects, or, as objects in a "mating ritual," they point to a different, incompatible symbolic system. His sister Ilana's rebellion against her parents' modem Orthodox practices represents a trajectory that is opposite that of her brother. Linked with her sexual awakening, Ilana's rejection of her community's strictures is expressed as a rejection of the sexual discipline of modest dress for women. Like Baruch in the yeshiva, Ilana enters into a closed institution where she negotiates a new way of being. In an eight-week summer camp, Ilana takes up with new friends, exchanging clothing, makeup, and hairstyles and "experimenting with all the different ways they could look."52 Ilana wears skimpy, sexually suggestive cloth- ing, in contrast to the more modest attire she wears at home. In doing so, she takes secret pleasure in her sexuality-"the quiet thrill of looking up to see a boy staring at her legs .... her shirt dipped low when she bent over ... the flash of her bra strap, the seemingly unintentional baring of a thigh."53 Ilana experiences this change of 50.

Horowitz appearance not merely as an outer but as an inner transformation: "She was becoming herself."54 Upon her return home, the more modest clothing she had worn before feels denaturalized, like the artifice of costuming that not only masks but also does violence to one's true self. Glancing in the mirror as she dresses for her first day of school in a long denim skirt and baggy T-shirt, Ilana cringes. "The skirt not only covered her body; it hid who she was. It was like putting on a costume, gearing up to play a role that wasn't her.... Suddenly she couldn't stand it. Her legs felt too constricted. She felt like they might break into a rash."55 Ilana repeatedly uses the term "masquerade" to describe not only her clothing but also people's religious observance generally. As Ilana and other girls challenge the mores of the community by wearing more revealing clothing to their Jewish day school, their teachers and rabbis see the destabilizing potential that is inherent in transgressive dress, fearing the "school's slide into the world of the Jewish prep school."56 The distinctive and desexualized clothing of the religious girls clearly marks them as members of their community. The removal of such markers blurs the boundaries between insider and outsider. Thus, the rabbis "worried that their students were becoming no different from their non- religious counterparts."57 The school imposes a dress code on female students, forbidding a range of garments including "platform shoes, skirts above the knee, sleeves above the elbow, shirts that were skimpy or exposed the collarbone.... skirts with slits that passed the knee or sweaters that could be deemed immodest or tight."58 The school principal cites a welter of rabbinic auth- orities that define "what parts of them were off limits," texts that focus on the dangerous and hence forbidden allure of female sexuality.59 Brought to discipline the girls' desire, the texts subject Ilana's body to a punishment she describes in physical terms: "[L]ike arrows, they landed on various parts of her body. She became nothing but an assemblage of forbidden parts: legs, elbows, arms, thighs."60 In Ilana's inner monologue, the pain reduces her to mere flesh.61 Seeing herself through the eyes of the rabbis-not only the rabbis of her school but also those of the Jewish textual tradition-denaturalizes Ilana's sense of both her old and her new clothing and, ultimately, of her body. Not yet removed from the authority of the rabbis but no longer feeling bound by it, Ilana is defined by neither her new nor her old garb and simultaneously by both.

In a relay race at school in which the girls pull on an oversized school T-shirt, run the circuit, and then pass the T-shirt to the next runner, Ilana removes both the oversize T-shirt and her own shirt, running the track in her bra and short skirt. Either by accident or by design- the narrative leaves it ambiguous-Ilana throws off the discipline of mores and texts, feeling that "something inside her sprang free."62 For Ilana, the moment symbolizes a rejection of the fixed gender role assigned her in the Orthodox world and a questioning of the fixed nature of the borderline that separates reli- giously observant Jews from others. "I am looking at our family and everyone is something different... . Who are you? Who are we?"63 In Blackface, White Noise, Michael Rogin discusses how identity perform- ance and public border crossing "parody ... the supposedly natural identity."64 According to Rogin, "Drag queens who dress as women and whites who black up call attention to the gap between role and ascribed identity by playing what, in the essential view, they cannot be."65 In Mirvis's novel, too, characters cross- dress, wearing the garb of that which they desire to be but fear they are not. This masquerade both affirms and unravels the desired identity, calling into question the stability of all identity and the boundaries between inside and outside. Moreover, the very stringency of a culture's dress code energizes the identify performed. Rogin observes that "[t]he more freedom there is to try on different genders, ethnicities and other roles, the more likely the performed identity will have little purchase on the self. The more performance scripts identity, the more it serves power; the more freedom to perform any role, the less sub- version in the play."66 Cultural newcomers possess a heightened sense of both belonging and exclusion, and hence an especially strong need for identity performance. In The Outside World, Tzippy's mother Shayna is a ba 'alat teshuvah, someone raised outside the Orthodox community who became religiously observant while at university. Even after many years, having studiously learned and adopted the rules of her community, married, and raised children according to its norms, she worries about belonging. She fears that "her neighbors would see through her, to her past. They would strip off her hat, her long skirt, and her stockings, and expose her as an impostor."67 The expansive and detailed plans for her eldest daughter's betrothal and wedding constitute an elaborate staging designed to prove to herself and to others that she "belonged in this world" in an indisputable way, that she sits naturally in her elected identity and community.68 Such moments 62.

Horowitz of denaturalization make both the characters and the reader aware of the construct- edness of identity. Such hyperattention to the details of dress, meals, and decor is a kind of Jewish drag, a concern with self-presentation to members of one's commu- nity. That Shayna feels compelled to perform her belonging indicates that mem- bership and identity are always under negotiation. The novelists cited in the debate under discussion portray characters who are in constant renegotiation through cultural and gender performance, faith, practice, and identity in flux. In Rosen's Joy Comes in the Morning, several characters struggle with faith and identity. For example, Lev Friedman envies the spiritual ease of Deborah Green, a Reform rabbi, whom he describes as resembling a plant, "nourishing herself directly from the source"-that is, drawing spiritually without self-consciousness and without mediation.69 The metaphor (which evokes the link between women and nature in nineteenth-century science writing) appeals to Deborah. But when she experiences a crisis of faith, the horti- cultural terms change. She feels "like I was the burning bush and I just flamed out."70 When she tells her sister's lesbian lover she fears that losing her faith will entail losing Lev's love as well, the double meaning of "bush" mixes the sacred with the sensual, discipline with desire. The narrative takes pains to high- light the gender crossing of the woman rabbi. The first time Lev sees Deborah praying with a tallit, a sacred garment traditionally reserved for men, he sees her as "a strange ghostly man"; Deborah's former boyfriend, Reuben, an Orthodox Jew, once called her a "transvestite."7 Deborah continues to fulfill her pastoral obligations, offering congregants spiritual succor in moments of despair. But whereas once she felt a world saturated with wholeness and religious meaning, now she becomes self-conscious about masquerading as something she is not. Lev, a science reporter who is struggling to sort through his own connection to Judaism, literally "performs" a rabbi. Through a series of circumstances, he finds himself officiating at a funeral, allowing the bereaved family to believe he is a rabbi. Fearing exposure as a sham, he recollects the way that Deborah comforts the bereaved and eulogizes the dead-essentially, he performs "Deborah." "Deborah had a way of talking that was humble yet somehow com- manding. He tried to capture her posture."72 He later confesses to her, "At the funeral ... everything I did was an impersonation. I was imitating you... . But somehow they took it as real. And that made it real for me."73 Deborah responds that "all rabbis are impersonators," but this element of performativity does not make them false. Their exchange clarifies for the reader that performance is not sham but speech act, a way of creating events, of creating self. As Turner notes, cultural performances not only act out the values and symbols of a culture but also "may themselves be active agencies of change, representing the eye by which the culture sees itself and the drawing board on which creative 69.

Lev successfully plays the part of a Jew by acting out a woman rabbi, fol- lowing several failed performances as a religious Jew that collapse on the grounds of gender anxieties. For example, although he is drawn to Jewish learning and practice, Lev fears appearing too Jewish. "It seemed unmanly [to wear a kippah]. It seemed Jewish. The little knit bulls-eye target seemed a virtual 'Kick Me' sign."75 For Lev, then, constructing a Jewish identity always involves not only performing Jewish but also a kind of gender crossing. Lev's fear of appearing "unmanly"-that is, feminized and weak-evokes long-standing antisemitic tropes of the effeminate Jew. His mime of Deborah loosens up the rigid boundaries of gender identity, renegotiating what it can mean to him to be a Jew. Through Deborah's and Lev's Jewish performances, Rosen not only reveals the fluidity of religious identity but also debunks the binary terms of gender identity. In con- temporary North American Jewish fiction, the unmooring of the boundaries of community and culture is made visible in moments of crisis. Events that push the boundaries of the faith community, test individual faith, or strain the adequacy of available explanations destabilize what was once presumed to be fixed and whole. Geertz's analysis of religious culture notes three pressure points where "chaos" unsettles religious stability, points "which lack not just interpretation but interpretability": "Bafflement," or events and phenomena that the culture cannot explain; extreme suffering; and a "sense of intractable ethical paradox."76 As characters in contemporary Jewish American fiction come up against such things as bereavement, infertility, constraints on sexual desire, intel- lectual ambition, and spiritual yearning, the hold of religious and cultural norms loosens, making space for cultural play. Performance at once reaffirms and dislodges stability, raising issues of communal cohesion and rupture, individual belonging and exclusion. In "The Observant Reader," Shalit regards Jewish American fiction as an author's textual performance of Judaism. Who is the imagined audience for such a performance? Both Shalit's essay and Barreca's introduction to the Sopra- nos volume imagine an audience of insiders whose authentic ways of being expose such performances as sham. In other words, according to these essays, insiders don't "perform." They simply are. This is a different idea of performance than the one used here. But both Shalit and Barreca also imagine another audience, one of outsiders who would not know the actual from the sham and might be misled. This audience requires cultural critics such as Shalit and Barreca to mediate cultural production such as novels, films, and television series. The cultural mediator reveals who poses, who pretends, who postures, who mimes, 74. Turner, The Anthropology of Performance, 24. 75. Rosen, Joy Comes in the Morning, 157. 76.

But the cultural mediators, whether they are the newly observant novelists whose writing Shalit admires or the Italian American contributors to Barreca's volume, also perform for an audience. Shalit sees these writers-and herself-as "enter[ing] the reli- gious fold" equipped with "the literary training of the more secular life they left behind."77 These skills, Shalit asserts, make newly observant writers "ideally suited to act as interpreters between the two worlds."78 What she describes, however, is not a two-way exchange but a one-way, controlled, circumscribed self-presentation of the religious world to the secular audience. "In their work, age-old customs are being presented in a way that reminds us of the deep satisfac- tions they can provide, even, or especially, in the face of the uncertainties of modem life."79 In her New York Times review, Shalit enacts a public repudiation of the self she once was. "At 21, I was on the outside looking in ... a Reform Jew." She viewed Orthodox Jews as "mean," the women "oppressed drudges." Now she understands the women are "strong and energetic."80 Although the intent of such a performance is to fix cultural values and affirm the distinction between inside and outside, one unsought result is the highlighting of liminality, of in-betweenness, of border crossing. As several participants in the debate over Shalit's essay note, had the newly Orthodox writers whom Shalit cites so approvingly been raised in their desired communities, they would not have received the literary training to write novels about haredi Jews. Indeed, the transgressive potential of novels is one of the focal points of Abraham's The Romance Reader. One of the hallmarks of postmodern culture is the destabilization of such things as identity, community, and ideology. Firming up boundaries and shoring up lost certainties constitute one response to the anxieties of the consequent ambi- guities. The authors treated in "The Observant Reader" are seen as problematic not so much because their characters act in ways that are antithetical to Judaic values and practices but precisely because they locate their narratives and sensibilities in a reconfigured and evolving Judaism. By contrast, the character flaws and foibles in Jewish American novels that operate within secular rather than religious frame- works do not challenge the stability of the Orthodox world. For example, Shalit views such writers as Malamud, Bellow, and Roth as "assimilated Jews who have written profoundly about the alienation that accompanies that way of life."'81 In other words, the angst and anomie of their characters is a consequence of their having abandoned traditional Judaism, but returning to "traditional roots" presumably avoids or resolves such existential crises. Indeed, it may well be that the author's status as a ba 'alat teshuvah, that is, as a self-described newcomer to Orthodox Judaism, calls forth an impulse to stabilize identity, community, and borderlines by seeing Judaism as static and fixed rather than dynamic. The title of Shalit's essay suggests that the religiously observant community speaks out 77. Shalit, "The Observant Reader," 17 78. Ibid. 79. Ibid. 80. Ibid., 16. 81.

The contemporary Jewish North American authors whom Shalit cites- and many she does not-explore the pressure points within contemporary Judaism. They might question the centrality of the Holocaust, or the nostalgia for a simplified past, or the clear-cut definitions of Jewishness that sometimes define contemporary Jewish discourse in North America. They substitute instead the difficult psychic work of constituting community, working through issues of religious belief, practice, and identity. The best of contemporary Jewish American fiction seeks to complicate a foreshortened and simplified dis- cussion about Jewish identity and Jewishness in our time. In looking at America's Jewish question, they opt to explore the in-betweenness, the shifting borders, rather than to resolve them by engraving the borderlines.82 Sara R.
