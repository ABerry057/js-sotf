<plain_text><page sequence="1">Byron L. Sherwin. In Partnership With God: Contemporary Jewish Law and Ethics. Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 1990. xiv, 290 pp. In Partnership With God is a book which holds much promise. Most importantly for scholars of Jewish studies, it contains a ringing critique of the sufficiency of the Wissenschaft values which continue to drive the disci- pline, and a sustained argument for a very different program of Jewish scho- larship. In Sherwin's view the Wissenschaft program "is scholarship about Judaism rather than Jewish scholarship" (p. 8). What he advocates is "a program for contemporary Jewish scholarship aimed at the perpetuation and the continuous recreation of Judaism" (ibid.). This objective is, of course, altogether at odds with the "scientific" character of academic Jewish scholarship, whose practitioners seek to understand, but not to perpetuate, Jewish life or tradition. To be sure, Sherwin does not claim, as some traditionalists might, that academic Jewish scholarship is of no value at all. He recognizes that its insights can be useful. Nevertheless, he believes that even these insights must be taken with more than a grain of salt, because "by casting the history, reli- gion, literature, and institutions of the Jewish people into Western academic categories the very tradition that these scholars wished to preserve was dis- torted beyond recognition" (p. 5). He is most emphatic, indeed, that acade- mic scholarship is not sufficient, not only because it distorts the truth, but because it is discontinuous with the classical goal of Jewish scholarship, which has been "to advance the value system embodied in the Jewish texts and institutions it studies" (p. 9). This requires on the part of its practitioners, we are told, not only Jewish knowledge, but Jewish corhimitment: "Neither Jewish scholarship nor Jewish scholars can divorce themselves from Jewish observance or from</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 123 Jewish life" (p. 13). Moreover, its methodology is more akin to art than to science, since its task "is to continue the process of creative misreading of the text within the parameters of the value system that teaches us how to relate to the text in the first place" (p. 10). For Sherwin, "creative misreading" is critical, since he argues vigorous- ly, in an essay entitled "Philosophies of Law" (chapter 2 of the book), for what he calls the "dialogic view" of halakhah, as against the "monolithic view." The monolithic view, according to Sherwin, "emphasizes the possi- bility of only a single halakhic response to each halakhic question ... [and] encourages the need for halakhic certainty" (p. 24). The dialogic view, on the other hand, understands revelation "to be a dialogue between God and human beings" (p. 24), in which there is an irreducible human element. "God does not reveal halakhic decisions but halakhic possibilities. The task of the sages of each generation is to discern halakhic decisions for their own generation from among these pluralistic possibilities" (p. 29), even if this means contravening one of the established codes of law, or halakhic prec- edent. If all this has something of a familiar ring, that is because in its broadest outlines it is familiar. Sherwin's acknowledged debt to two of his teachers, Abraham Joshua Heschel and Seymour Siegel, is evident throughout, not only substantively, but in the case of Heschel, stylistically as well. Sherwin has a gift for the apposite story and for the punchy epigram which he puts to effective use. He is also remarkably erudite. The essays-and this volume is essentially a collection of essays-cover such diverse topics as euthanasia, repentance, bar and bat mitzvah, tzedakah, and parent-child relations. He brings to these topics an unusually wide range of sources: rabbinic, kabbalis- tic, historical, theological, and, yes, Wissenschaft. If he decries the excessive specialization of contemporary Jewish studies, it is altogether apparent in his own writings that he is not guilty of that crime. There is much to learn from these essays. The substance and range of the essays, however, do not mask the great difficulty in carrying out the program for Jewish scholarship which Sherwin advocates. Indeed, they exemplify it. For how, after all, can one be sure as to which particular values make up the "value system" which Jewish scholar- ship is supposed to advance? Once the analysis moves beyond platitudes, the difficulties really begin. We all know that the Jewish tradition values life, but how exactly does that play itself out in some of the complex contexts of euthanasia? As scholars have long recognized, while law may in some fash-</page><page sequence="3">124 BOOK REVIEWS ion be related to morality, it is hardly morality's handmaiden. Exposing the underlying values of the American Constitution is of course helpful, but that does not amoun't to the sustained, often highly technical legal analysis which makes up a Supreme Court decision. Philosophers are not asked to decide constitutional law; Supreme Court justices are. I certainly do not mean to suggest that Sherwin is guilty of platitudinous generalizations; he is far too sophisticated for that. I do mean to suggest, however, that insofar as his essays deal with matters halakhic, they lack the bite, the technical sophistication of legal analysis, Jewish or otherwise. If they are intended to provide normative guidelines, then they fall short of what legal analysis requires, whether one's theory of halakhah is dialogic or monolithic. On the other hand, if they aim to provide some explanatory framework for Jewish norms, then they lack the systematic methodology to do so satisfactorily, to break new conceptual ground. That is, they do not engage historical issues enough for the historian, philosophical issues enough for the philosopher, textual issues enough for the text critic, and so on. In other words, despite their erudition-there is something here for everyone-many of the essays left at least this reviewer on the whole more informed, but nevertheless oddly unfulfilled. Perhaps this is because some were apparently written for nonscholarly presentations, which would account for their surveylike quality. But then they would hardly exemplify Sherwin's program of Jewish scholarship. In part this problem is, of course, a consequence of Sherwin's attack on Wissenschaft methodology. But, and this seems to me a critical issue, what methodology then is to be used in its stead? The traditionalists who abjure Wissenschaft methodology have their own quite sophisticated one, at least for normative questions. Halakhic scholars know a serious halakhic argu- ment when they see one. But if classic halakhic argumentation is aban- doned, if even a widely accepted pesak of the Rema in his glosses to the Shul- ban Arukh is up for grabs, and most importantly, if an analysis of what are necessarily amorphous "values" gets imported into the normative discus- sion, then there is, unavoidably, a commensurately amorphous quality to the analysis itself. The disciplinary methodologies of the historian, philosopher, and so on, of course, solve this methodological problem, but many are not appropriate to normativity; and in any case Sherwin eschews exclusive reliance upon any of these methods, whether or not the aim is normative. In effect, then, he is caught on the horns of a difficult methodological dilemma raised precisely</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 125 by the program of Jewish scholarship he advocates. This reviewer is most sympathetic to Sherwin's impassioned plea for committed Jewish scholar- ship and his erudite effort to exemplify it. But scholarship without a clearly defined method lacks the bite to prove its case. Moshe Z. Sokol Touro College New York, N.Y.</page></plain_text>
