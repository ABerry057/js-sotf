Stanford University Press, 1997. xviii, 362 pp.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 399 Talya Fishman has written a brilliant book that sheds much light on the enigmatic but well-documented personality of Leon Modena as well as about the nature of rabbinic Judaism. Leon Modena (1571-1648), the outstanding Venetian rabbi of the early modem period, wrote many Hebrew works in many of the literary genres of Renaissance and Baroque Italy and personally engaged in polemics with Jews and Christians about the nature of rabbinic Judaism. Although most of Modena's writings have been long available in print, new compositions by him are still being discovered, such as his Bible commentaries, recently described by Binyamin Richler. Although Modena wrote many responsa, letters, and poems, central to an understanding of his thought are works that he never explicitly prepared for publication: his autobiography, his critiques of Kabbalah--particularly his scholarly assault on the antiquity of the Zohar and Christian use of it for missionary activity--and his transmission of a powerful critique of rabbinic Judaism, Kol Sakhal, the subject of Talya Fishman's study. As Fishman correctly notes, reactions to Kol Sakhal for the past century and a half have been based on the Jewish denominational preference of the historian. Some have tried, for various reasons, to identify Modena not only as the editor and copyist of the work, about which there can be no dispute, but also as its author, thereby vindicating their own desire to undermine either rabbinic authority or else Modena's position as a rabbi. Fishman's contribution offers a new interpretation of Modena's relationship to the Kol Sakhal and of the nature of rabbinic Judaism in the early modem period. She submits that inherent in early modem rabbinic Judaism in particular, and in all stages of rabbinic Judaism in general, can be found a sustained critique of rabbinic culture. Thus she asserts with considerable evidence--and even more is available, including references in the works of Modena and others to contemporary "Karaites," "fools," "so-called rabbis," and "Jewish Lutherans," the removal of titles from rabbis, and the conversion of rabbis to Christianity--that premodem Jews and even the rabbis themselves were not unquestionably obedient to rabbinic authority, and that modem Jewish movements distorted the sources and suppressed the evidence for earlier diversity in Jewish life and thought. Fishman draws on a comparison of passages in Modena's oeuvre and in Kol Sakhal to reach the conclusion that Modena was the author of Kol Skahal. She puts forward two possible reasons why Modena, a rabbi, may have written so anti-rabbinic a work: either as a private "prank," or as a "ventriloquist's</page><page sequence="3">400 BOOK REVIEWS dummy," to enable him to present his own views. To these two reasons could be added a third: Modena set up the text as a foil for presenting and refuting arguments against rabbinic Judaism. Fishman, however, tacitly does not accept these positions. Fishman raises the interesting possibility that Modena donned a mask when writing Kol Sakhal, a work she characterizes as an "invention." This thesis becomes especially convincing when Kol Sakhal, purportedly acquired by Modena in the summer of 1622, is compared to Modena's autobiography, Hayyei Yehudah, begun by him between 1617 and 1622 and continued until shortly before he died. This latter work, often presented as the first Hebrew autobiography, can easily seduce readers to think that they have had access to the facts of its author's life and that the author may not have been a particularly happy, successful, or endearing person. This creates what could be called a false positivism because, especially when his other writings are compared, the apparently straightforward, factual nature of his autobiographical narrative proves to be falsified by competing facts. In her introduction to Hayyei Yehudah, drawing on the canons of autobio- graphical criticism, Natalie Zemon Davis insightfully characterized the work as "Fame and Secrecy," part of a program, conscious or not, of posturing, confessing, bragging, and repenting. A similar conclusion emerges when one compares Modena's autobiography with Abraham Yagel's contemporaneous Valley of Vision, recently edited and translated by David Ruderman, a work that clearly mixes dream sequences with descriptions of what seem to have been actual events, heightening the question, not of how to separate fact from fiction, but rather of why autobiographical writers mix them so effortlessly in their constructions of themselves. Similarly, by avoiding the trap of taking apparent facts at face value, by refusing to reject fanciful elements, and by looking at the larger picture of the book itself, Fishman sees the Kol Sakhal as part of a historiographic and political program for the secularization of Jewish culture, offering a fascinating comparison to the life and writings of his Venetian Catholic contemporary Fra Paolo Sarpi. Alas, for the Jews, she notes, such a program failed during the seventeenth century, although she could find no evidence that Modena contributed more than one draft of Kol Sakhal, but it was at least in the good company of Spinoza's slightly later pseudepigraphical Theological-Political Treatise and Uriel Da Costa's Example ofa Human Life and his condemned Exame das tradi 6es Phariseas conferidas com a lei escrita, recently rediscovered, translated, and edited by H. P. Salomon.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 401 Fishman reminds us on several occasions that the entire point of Kol Sahal as well as the life and thought of Leon Modena and their place in seventeenth-century thought is missed by comparing them, as is so often done, with developments in the nineteenth century, often characterizing Modena as the first modem rabbi, or as I myself have suggested in protest, the last medieval rabbi. If, instead, we follow Talya Fishman's careful program for reading Modena, we may be able to conclude that Leon Modena was in fact the first postmodern rabbi.
