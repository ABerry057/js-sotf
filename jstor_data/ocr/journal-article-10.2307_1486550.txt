<plain_text><page sequence="1">KOVNER VS. KOVNER "A PARTING FROM THE SOUTH" VS. "COMBAT PAGE" by REUVEN SHOHAM I The poet Abba Kovner was a partisan and freedom fighter during World War II (1942-1945), made aliyah in 1945, and published his first long poem, 'Ad lo 'or ("Until There Was No Light"), in 1947. At the outbreak of the Israeli War of Independence he fought on the Egyptian front (1947-48), serving as a cultural officer, or politruk,' in the Giv'ati Brigade. Preda me-ha-darom ("A Parting from the South"), his second long poem2 and one of the pivotal works by a modem Hebrew poet, was written against the background of the War of Independence. However, critics have not yet been able to find a fitting place for it in the canon of Hebrew poetry and culture, although several serious attempts have been made.3 The present study does not refer to every aspect 1. Politruk was the nickname given to educational and cultural officers of Palmach and Haganah forces combat units during the War of Independence. It reflected the strong influence of Soviet World War II literature on Israeli literature and culture in those days. At the time, the term had no negative connotations, although the Soviet politruks earned a bad reputation after World War II. 2.

Until recently critics only dealt with certain aspects of this long poem. However, leading critics dwelt on the work's great importance and quality. Examples are Benjamin Hrushovski, who in September-October 1952 published three articles dealing with the modern Hebrew long poem in general, and Kovner in particular, in Masa, the literary supplement of the daily AJS Review 22/2 (1997): 223-241 223</page><page sequence="2">224 REUVEN SHOHAM of this complex poem but focuses on one particular point. I contend that "A Parting from the South" implies an attempt by the visionary speaker of the poem to compel the young country, soon after the war, to part from the world of death, from cultic memories of the dead and guilt feelings toward them (the dead in the 1948 war in Israel and the dead in the ghettos of Nazi Europe in World War II). Abba Kovner tries to detach himself, and his readers, from death, to liberate them from the old perspectives. He seeks to remove them from the war ethos which had indeed been his own and which he himself had nurtured only one year before the publication of Preda me-ha-darom in his newsletter, Daf kravi ("Combat Page"), written while he was serving as an educational officer with the Giv'ati Brigade on the southern front. With the fighting over, Kovner regarded this ethos as a danger to the survival of the new State of Israel. In this context, it should be recalled how small the population of Israel was then and how heavy a price the country had paid for victory: 6,000 casualties out of a total population of 600,000, and this after one-third of the Jewish people had been destroyed in Nazi Europe. Kovner's leave-taking from the battlefields of the south and from those slaughtered in the death camps of Europe originated principally in a total commitment to the ethos of life, a commitment which required the speaker La-merhav. The three were published as one article under the title "Abba Kovner and the Modem Hebrew Long Poem" (Hebrew) in Abba Kovner: A Selection of Critical Essays on His Writings (Hebrew), ed. Shalom Luria (Tel Aviv, 1988), pp. 42-82. See also B. Y. Michali, "Abba Kovner's Four Long Poems" (Hebrew), Moznayim 31, nos. 3-4 (1970): 166-175; Shalom Luria, "Abba Kovner: The Man and His Poetry" (Hebrew), in Abba Kovner: A Selection of Critical Essays, pp. 192-277; and especially idem, "Preda me-ha-darom by Abba Kovner" (Hebrew), Zehut/Identity 3 (1983): 200-206. This was the beginning of a close reading of the whole long poem, but the discussion was discontinued shortly after it began. See also the partial comment by Dan Miron, "Kovner's New Long Poem" (Hebrew), in Abba Kovner: A Selection of Critical Essays, pp. 83-89; and the more exhaustive treatment in idem, Mul ha- 'ah ha-shotek ("Facing the Silent Brother: Essays on the Poetry of the War of Independence") (Tel Aviv, 1992), pp. 273-274, 320-324, 364-365.

See also the latest publication on Kovner's poetry, Ziva Ben-Yoseph Ginor, Beyond the Legend (Hebrew) (Tel Aviv. 1995). Although these partial responses disagree as to the way in which the poems are ordered and on their composition and nature in general, critics agree that Preda me ha-darom was one of the most important works written after the War of Independence and a leading contribution to modem Hebrew poetry.

KOVNER 225 to erect a prominent psychological barrier between the living and the dead, to preserve life and abandon the cult of death because it might eventually paralyze the vital forces of the new state. In the poem Mot dambam ("The Death of Dambam"), the dead fighter makes an explicit statement conveying his final wish to Shlomit, the woman he loves. He orders her to forget him in order to survive.

Yet it was no trivial matter to leave the death cult of the heroic war and at once fashion a new myth, one of life, especially, as mentioned, since Kovner himself had been a formidable proponent of the old cult. To provide a basis for this new perspective on life, Kovner was therefore obliged to change his own attitude first. This departure from himself after the two wars forced him to review the recent as well as the remote past, and to examine such concepts as heroism and memory, fighters and enemy. He sought fresh meanings for sacrificing and being sacrificed, laying siege to cities and being besieged, conquering and being conquered; ultimately, he searched for the real goal of the Israeli people and the Israeli soldier, starting from the very beginnings of Jewish history. This paper examines, for the first time in Kovner criticism, how the "implied author"' of his Preda me-ha-darom dissociates himself from the "implied author" of the newsletter for fighters, Daf kravi ("Combat Page"), which was written by Kovner as a politruk with the Giv'ati Brigade during the War of Independence. Kovner wrote and published the "Combat Pages" (Dappim) before and after battles or important actions in which the brigade was involved. They were distributed to the soldiers when a battle was raging as part of an attempt by the commanding officer, Shim'on 'Avidan, to sustain the fighting spirit of his men. At the time Kovner's Dappim were better known than his literary writings, the partisan long poem 'Ad lo 'or, which had been published in 4. Hebrew text, p. 39; Kaufman's translation, p. 89. 5. As Booth put it in his Rhetoric of Fiction (Chicago, 1965), pp. 71-76.</page><page sequence="4">226 REUVEN SHOHAM 1947. The first "Combat Page" was distributed on June 9, 1948; fifteen years after the war, sets of the Dappim were stapled together and presented to the soldiers when they gathered to commemorate their service in the brigade. The climate in Israel changed rapidly against the background of World War II and after the 1948 war. The postwar literature of the early 1950s placed particular emphasis on the feelings of sadness, even depression, weighing on many of the Israeli elite, the freedom fighters who had just returned home from the battlefield. This sober mood must be understood against the expectations before the War of Independence and the shattering of those expectations after it. Before and during the war, the Jewish population was fighting not only for survival but also for a utopian Israel, as conceived in the light of the socialist ideas of the time. When the war ended, a bureaucracy and government institutions arose, and many veterans felt alienated from the new society and the incipient political system forming in the newborn state. Despite having made the supreme contribution, they felt deceived and abandoned by the country they had fought for and by people who had not shared their terrifying experiences. Many of them believed that they were witnessing the emergence of a country different from the one they had dreamed of and fought for. Their disappointment is widely reflected in Israeli poetry, prose, and drama after 1948.6 Kovner believed that the deep gloom that beset the inhabitants of the young state, after so many lives had been lost, was life-threatening for the young country. The tender young nation, so vulnerable in its earliest stages of growth, had to shore up its strength, not sink into melancholy and thereby imperil the future. One may see Preda me-ha-darom as an attempt to deal with the traumas of the 1940s. Moreover, perhaps for the first time in Hebrew literature after the two wars, the poem tries to fortify the nation in readiness for the hard times ahead. The poem is special inasmuch as it does not confine itself to satirizing the new reality, or to expressing nostalgia for a vanished past, or lamenting the dead. Instead, it tries to point the way to life, without catchwords, without self-deception, facing the dead and facing life, on both the national, collective level and the psychological, personal level of the individual. The first step in achieving these goals was to differentiate the new poem from the Dafkravi, so well-known to his readers at the time. 6.

KOVNER 227 As stated, Kovner served as cultural officer in the Giv'ati Brigade, which fought on the southern frontier against the Egyptian army, and the newsletter was a page of topical, combat-related material. The Dappim were meant to give information and to mentally prepare the soldiers for the job they had to do. In addition, they were an openly propagandistic publication along the lines of Panfilov's Men, a Soviet war novel by Alexander Bek, which was extremely popular in those days,7 and which probably gave Kovner the nick- name "Politruk." Certainly, the portrait of the speaker that emerges from the Dappim is one-dimensional and hard for present-day readers to accept. The Dappim are full of pathos, elevated language, slogans, extreme statements, unequivocal declarations, and the like, as we shall see below. Yet we have to bear in mind that times have changed. Today, when we all lead well-ordered lives in "concrete time"8 as law-abiding citizens in a stable society, the Dappim not only lack relevancy but seem inhuman.9 Of course, the times and the special circumstances in which the Dappim were written must be taken into account, and when we judge the Kovner of the Dappim we have to bear in mind that these were "mythical times," as Eliade puts it, when ordinary people had to become soldiers, ready, almost wishing, to throw their lives away in the service of the "Great Mother" in order to ensure the survival of the land, the tribe, the nation, or, more specifically, of the frail young Israeli nation. In such times, we learn from Eliade, the individual usually loses his individuality; he becomes a soldier in a uniform, which erases his uniqueness and puts him in a special mood of readiness to lay down his life, placing it in the bosom of his "Great Mother."'1 7. Panfilov s Men by Alexander Bek was translated into Hebrew and published in 1946, along with other Russian war novels. One may see the popularity of literature of this kind in Uri Avneri's war diary Besdotpleshet (1949; reprint ed., Tel-Aviv, 1950), pp. 258-260. See also the English translation On the Forward Fringe: A Novel of General Panfilov ' Division (London: Hutchinson, 1945). 8. Mircea Eliade, Cosmos and History (New York, 1959), pp. 17-34. 9. A good example of the problematic reception of the Dappim can be found in Kovner's testimony. In his collection of essays On the Narrow Bridge (Hebrew) (Tel-Aviv, 1981), p. 161, he cites a passage from a letter written to him by Shirley Kaufman (his translator into English). She did not want to translate the original Dafkravi inserted into his long poem (1969), p. 45. She asked his permission not to translate this "page," because she was afraid that the American reader would reject writing of this kind. 10. Eliade, Cosmos and History, pp. 17-34.</page><page sequence="6">228 REUVEN SHOHAM In the Dappim, which gave expression to the feelings of the author and the fighters, we find those mythical yet hard times. The enemy is Goliath, the demonic monster, and the men of the Giv'ati Brigade are David, who has to kill the monster in order to save his people; there is only us against them: a soldier in a white hat confronting a Goliath in black; the author demands that everyone risk his life without hesitation because "Our homes, the lives of our children, the eyes of eighty generations watching us, the souls of six millions who had no chance and who call to us from the ground where they are buried-they demand a terrible vengeance." The passage quoted is signed by Shim'on 'Avidan, the commanding officer of the Giv'ati Brigade; it is part of the introduction to the collected Dappim, which, as noted, were stapled together. Presumably Kovner wrote the intro- duction to the collected pages, but even if he did not, the passage reflects the way of thinking of those times and faithfully expresses the collective mind which blurred the individuality of the fighters. The collected Dappim are full of hortatory sentences, such as "Honor and glory to our brave warriors" who are facing "the butchers [kalgasim] of the invading army, ill-trained, ill-disciplined hordes." The word kalgasim is auto- matically equated with "Nazi beast" in the fullest sense of the word. The single heading of each of the Dappim is significant: "Death to the Invaders!" In one typical statement, Negba, a kibbutz in southern Israel, is called "Negbagrad" (July 13, 1948), evoking Stalingrad, to which the Nazis laid siege, with the implication that Negba, like Stalingrad, is defending itself in exemplary fashion and the enemy will come to a "bad end, as at Stalingrad." The Egyptians are "Anglo-Faroukian dogs""'' who are crushed under the wheels of Israeli vehicles (July 14, 1948); and the plague that hits them is "the plague of darkness--the plague of blood" (ibid.). The enemy becomes the archetypal Pharaoh with his chariots; thus the speaker inflames his comrades. He warns them not to have any hesitations about the enemy, relating this episode: The driver pulled back: human beings under his wheels! Just a moment. ... The driver remembered Kibbutz Negba, remembered the village of Bet-Darass, 2 and he stepped on the gas, he ran them over! Stop at nothing, boys: Murderous dogs must be put to death. The more dogs you kill, the more will you love beauty, goodness, freedom. Run them over! Ready! 11. A verbal combination of 'Angliah ("England"), which governed that part of the world at the time, and Farouk, the name of Egypt's king in those days. 12. Bet-Darass: a Hebrew wordplay on the verb daras, "to crush underfoot."</page><page sequence="7">KOVNER VS. KOVNER 229 In the issue of July 16, 1948, Kovner writes: "Please, you descendants of Pharaoh, please: Cross only in pools of blood---cross only a red wadi [Arabic: dry stream]." This may seem shocking to present-day readers, but we must bear in mind that the Egyptians were 60 kilometers from Tel Aviv, with no more than a handful of virtually unarmed young Jewish men facing them. We must bear in mind that this was a "holy time," when a tiny number of Jewish settlers had to fight for survival after the destruction of European Jewry only a few years earlier. All this makes it mandatory for today's readers to view matters in context. In any event, Kovner's implied author is a pseudo-prophetic figure, almost apocalyptic, who addresses his fellow soldiers in strongly emotional terms, using the rhetoric of war propaganda centered on a mighty struggle, calling on his comrades and friends to fight to the last bullet, to lay down their lives in the battle against the monstrous foe. III In Preda me-ha-darom Kovner returns to the southern front, the battlefield of the Giv'ati Brigade, soon after the war, but now as a poet rather than a politruk.'3 One may imagine that Kovner the poet was unwilling to leave those terrible Dappim as his only written testimony to that trying time. This uneasiness, it would seem, compelled him to write not only this poem but also the novel Panim 'elpanim ("Face to Face") (Merhaviya, 1953, 1955), dealing with the same wartime events as the Dappim and his long poem. It is as if he felt an urge to look back and set down the full story of those days, through indirect reservations regarding the one-dimensional Dappim of the past. The long poem does not explicitly verbalize his reservations, but it certainly does so by implication in the following ways: 1. The speaker empathizes not only with the young fighters but also with the enemy and his towns and villages.14 2. As in the Dappim, the warriors are linked to the biblical Israelites, who, having left Egypt and servitude, have the Red Sea before them and 13.

Throughout the poem, the reader is given the opportunity to see the men as human beings, from within, with all their fears and pain, whereas in the Dappim the approach taken is always from the outside: the speaker addresses his audience from a position of prophetic authority, even though he identifies with them emotionally and occasionally uses the more familiar "we" in his speech. However, he always sounds as if he is making a speech through an amplifier to convey an authoritative historical message. I would almost suggest-with caution--that he appears as a new Moses, addressing his fellow men from above as they leave Egypt and slavery and move forward to the Promised Land. A good example is the page of July 17, 1948, entitled "The Plague of Stench." The speaker, connecting past and present, gives a vivid description of the smell arising from the corpses of the Egyptian soldiers outside the fences around Negba in which he makes brutal rhetorical use of the plagues of Egypt. (The content of this page is a response to a newspaper report that King Farouk had visited hospitals in Egypt and expressed satisfaction with the morale of his fighting men.) The Kovnerian speaker addresses the ruler of Egypt, as Moses did, but much more scornfully, demeaning him by using the transliterated English word "king" instead of the Hebrew melekh. King Farouk, King Farouk! Would you be so kind as to remove your kingly vestments and come to the fields of Negba to collect the harvest of stinking MORALE? Because life is very hard on us-because we have learned to breathe clean air, fresh and pure in this birthland of ours. Then the speaker once more turns directly to the fighters: King (melekh) Farouk-he won't come to collect his dung. For many, many days have passed since the time of Moses and the ten plagues of Egypt, including those to which Pharaoh's descendant has become accustomed: - He has become accustomed to LICE and feels good about it. - He has become accustomed to BOILS,... to PESTILENCE,.... to WILD BEASTS,... to FROGS and LOCUSTS--and feels good about it. ... Only the plague of blood remains to be learned! And it will come: 15. See the opening poem, which is a stanza from the poem "Combat Page" (Hebrew), pp. 9,37.</page><page sequence="9">KOVNER VS. KOVNER 231 First-it is different today among the progeny of Moses-is the plague of darkness. It is the night of the raid by the Jews. Afterwards comes the plague of stench, that is, the rot in the field. And our hand is still poised for the GREAT PLAGUE OF BLOOD. Thus the speaker not only takes on a Moses-like image, but also treats his soldiers as a group (first- or third-person plural), an object to be manipulated rhetorically. The reader is not allowed to see individuals from within, to closely observe their fears and traumas. In Preda me-ha-darom they are subjects whose inner life is laid bare. More specifically, Kovner focuses on one particular fighter, Dambam, the main character of the poem, and uses the stream of consciousness and Dambam's monologues to trace his awareness, as well as his subconscious, with microscopic accuracy. (Dambam is the protagonist of Preda me-ha-darom, and the only fighter who has a name. The name Dambam is made up from two words, dam, meaning "blood," and bam, meaning "in them." It is a shortened form of Dubenbaum, the full name of a soldier known as "Dabembam," who fell on October 26, 1948 in the battle for Beersheba. In order to bring the reader into a close relationship with his hero, Kovner even appends a note on Dambam: "I did not know the man; I only heard his name during those nights, from far away, and its sound penetrated to me, strange and exciting. The man was killed. And I was left with only the rhythm of his nameDa---Dmbambam.'6) In the poem "The Death of Dambam," mentioned above, the reader has the opportunity to penetrate Dambam's mind at the very moment that he dies, not only as a soldier but as a subject, a lover, and a son. After Dambam conjures Shlomit, his love, to forget him, we hear him at the moment he takes leave from life: 1 1 And quiet. .Et A last quiet. ,'ii.ng tj.W Like snow there on the fir tree. ._nW ?Y f ow .Wl ..

The speaker not only looks into the inner world of his heroes, he also refers to the feelings of the enemy, who is no longer "the butcher" --and therefore he can afford to dwell on the suffering of the civilians, peasants who had done no wrong but lost their homes. The poet dissociates himself from the generalizations and stereotypes of the Dappim. The poem intimates that the idea underlying the Sacrifice of Isaac (the 'Akedah) is not monopolized by the Jewish soldiers. The enemy has a "right" to his own 'Akedah. The first sign pointing in this direction is in the poem 'Even halaka ("Smooth Stone"),'8 where the 'Akedah is an extension of God's Covenant with the people of Israel (Genesis 15). In this poem all the hills are Picasso's Guernica: "Guernica on every hill!" --and the speaker makes no distinction between Giv'ati hills and enemy hills. In a note appended to the Hebrew text, the poet refers to Picasso's famous painting: "Guernica-a canvas by Picasso which depicts a terrible outcry" (p. 47). The cry expressed in Picasso's picture is a leading motif in Kovner's poem, and the muted cry which arises from it envelops both the fighters and 17. Hebrew, pp. 40-41; Eng. trans., pp. 89-90. 18.

(Accordingly, Kovner ends the last poem of Preda me-ha-darom with the line: "Oh, my friends, why are you silent? If the silent is not").19 In fact, the speaker in "Smooth Stone" is surprised and asks himself and the reader: "How will the sea distinguish between the trembling curl" (of the young Jewish fighter) and the "torn goat-flesh of Kedar [an Arab tribe] floating on the water?" The "curl" or lock of hair, in the style of those days, is synecdochical for the young Israeli-born fighter, the Sabra. The sacrifice of torn goat-flesh (korban ha-gappaym), according to Kovner's notes following the poem,20 as well as the word Kedar, stands for the (Arab) enemy, who is equally sacrificed on the hills of the south. The outcry of Guernica conveys the Giv'ati Brigade as well as its enemy. The sea that swallows the blood of both does not distinguish between them. The Sacrifice of Isaac, shared by the two warring nations, becomes a key image and central theme in the visions of this poem; and it is more overt in the second cycle of the long poem (the first of its three main cycles, all entitled "Mirage of Sand"). The poem's three main cycles are all headed by the recurring caption Mar 'at holot ("Mirage of Sand"), which in Hebrew lends itself to several interpretations (chiefly, a mirror, a mirage in the desert, and a prophetic vision, or the revelations which biblical prophets envisioned)21 in poems like "Sounds from Nearby"22 and "Radio Silence."23 In the first the speaker tells us that a father is taking his son to the spot where he will be sacrificed, and in the second we witness the thunderous sacrifice of Dambam, the main hero of the long poem, who ascends to heaven in a storm when he breaks through into the stronghold and is blown up as he cuts the barbed wire. In both texts Kovner treats the theme traditionally. The sacrificed young men are Abraham's sons. In the second "Mirage of Sand" cycle (the third cycle of the entire poem), Kovner takes the liberty of suggesting that the Arab village and its inhabitants are also victims. It opens with the poem "Gates of the City."24 The poem implies that the "City" is a an enemy city that has been conquered, but we do not know whether it is an Arab town in the south of Israel captured during the War of 19.

In any event, this alien town goes up in flames and burns like ancient parchments "scorched for three nights." The speaker looks at the gates of the city as Abraham looked at the gates of Sodom (Genesis 18:20-33) and asks: "Who set fire to the city / and did not wake the city?" (and perhaps did not warn them, in contrast to the warning God gave the citizens of Sodom and Gomorrah, according to the Bible and the tales of the sages).

We are not told who the city belongs to, but we know that it is an alien city. Nor does the shepherd (Abraham?) know the city. If it were his own, he would have known its name; if it is not his, it is an enemy city. Therefore, the "uncircumcised hand" (beyad arela; omitted in Kaufman's translation) which set fire to the city and did not awaken the residents belongs to one of the shepherd's fellow men. The ability of the shepherd, and of the speaker, who identifies with him, to acknowledge the suffering of those who have not sinned contrasts sharply with the one-dimensional worldview of the Dappim. As distinct from "Gates of the City," the poem "Night of the Siege,"25 the first poem of the third "Mirages" cycle, describes a beleaguered city which seems to belong to the Israeli warriors, although this is not quite certain. But many verbal coinages and motifs link it to the burning city in "Gates of the City." Here too the situation is not clear: who is besieging the city? who is beleaguered? who are the "good guys" and who the "bad" in this story? The city features archaic elements. The night of the siege is "large and ancient," the city 25. Hebrew, pp. 33-35; Eng. trans., pp. 85-86.</page><page sequence="13">KOVNER VS. KOVNER 235 has seven gates, and seven guards stand watch. But "the iron gates could not hold--they groaned at the hinges, / collapsed at the foot of the one / hole" until there was "a thin cry" and the gates "stretched out" like Titans (nefilim). All the features combine to make this a beleaguered city of antiquity, an archetypal city soon to be conquered and razed to the ground. At the same time it is a typically Kovnerian variation on the besieged city of Simhat 'aniyim ("Joy of the Poor") and Shirey makot mitzrayim ("Songs of the Plagues in Egypt"),26 two well-known long poems by Nathan Alterman which were published in 1941 and 1944 respectively. The two cities, the one in Kovner's "Night of the Siege" and the one in Alterman's "Night of the Siege,"27 the alien city and the Israeli city, are close to each other, or at least are not enemies, for they share the same fate. Thus the reader can no longer distinguish between besiegers and besieged, between friend and foe, between us and them. Suddenly the reader discovers that the besieged are the besiegers, and the besiegers are the besieged; sometimes you storm the city, and sometimes your city is stormed, and there is no palpable difference between the two. Since time immemorial, the existential human situation has been, and remains, siege and sacrifice; and this archetypal situation does not distinguish friend from foe.

These things happened between July 16 and 18, 1948, when the Giv'ati soldiers tried to break through enemy fortifications and reach the besieged South. The two villages are mentioned in Kovner's Dappim beginning from July 13, 1948; they were objectives for which the Giv'ati Brigade sacrificed the lives of its men. The page for July 19 reports that the villages were taken that day; the caption is "Breakthrough in the South." Needless to say, the fighters receive high praise from Kovner the politruk; and as usual, his style and tone are elevated and the account is full of pathos. As for the poem, it does not try to gloss over anything or hide behind some anonymous city, and there is an unmistakable link with the Dafkravi; therefore the reader expects a flush of victory, lamentation at the news of the fallen soldiers whose memories will be cherished forever, and the like. But instead, the reader is listening to a commanding officer asking over the radio: "Who set the fire in Kharatiyah and Hata?" The question carries obvious echoes of the question "Who set fire to the city?" in "Gates of the City" quoted earlier. In these echoes one can hear the disbelief and guilt feelings of someone who feels responsible for the fact that the city is in flames. But there is a difference; as distinct from the earlier poem, where the speaker does not say who set fire to the town, stating merely that it was by an evil hand, this poem makes it quite clear that the villages belong to the enemy and that those who set fire to them were Israeli soldiers. In any event, the exchange on the radio seems, at first reading, to be on two different levels. The first is a factual dialogue between two commanders, one of whom is in the burning cities while the other is behind the lines. On the second level the dialogue comes across as the voices of conversing ghosts, which, as Dan Miron says, walk the empty, burning streets of the cities (villages), giving expression to the horror of destruction by fire.29 In addition 29. Miron, Mul ha 'ah ha-shotek, p. 320.</page><page sequence="15">KOVNER VS. KOVNER 237 to Miron's inmerpretation, I would note that this text can be understood in more than one way. In the first and immediate sense, one seems to hear the members of a commission talking to each other as they investigate the case of the two villages. One of them is trying to establish the identity of those who set fire to the villages, and the other, who knows, seems to be evasive. This person knows the answer, but will not hand over the guilty because they are his own men. The concluding lines of the poem tell us what the stance of the implied author is. His point of view is verbalized by a third character, who seems to have listened to the surrealist dialogue: "The deserted clay huts are burning. And the fire opens wide / and the fire is wild." The last line of the poem, which stands alone, expresses the viewpoint of this third person: "The enemy walks in Kharatiya and Hata." This statement is no doubt a reaction to the miserable clay huts of the refugees being consumed in the raging fire and the evasive answers of the commanding officer. The entire scene, according to the third voice, makes the hand of whoever started this unnecessary fire--the same person as in "Gates of the City"---a "wild" hand (yad arela), a hand that "has not been disciplined," the hand of a mob that has run riot. The poem itself is structured as a "turn-over poem,"30 one in which the continuum of the text misleads us into construing a hypothesis based on what we have read so far; but when we go on reading we discover that we have to construe it by a different hypothesis which takes into account the conflicting material which we encountered as we were reading on. What appears at first to be a real or surrealist dialogue--two commanders talking--can also be understood as a monologue of lamentation. The recurring statements and questions, repeated in harrowing, monotonous voices, are characteristic of a lament. The speaker employs anaphora and epiphora in most of the sixteen lines of the poem. Everything is aimed at intensifying the rhetorical monotony which characterizes the lament, the permanent fixation on the emotional shock. The repeated use of the names Kharatiya and Hata works as a "focused euphony," linking the keywords of the text and drawing the reader's attention to them.31 The euphony in the poem directs the reader's attention to the three homony- mous root consonants of the Hebrew verbs KRT (karat, nno, "to destroy") and 30.

Lastly, the whole picture may be nothing but a "showing" of some psy- chomachia (inner struggle) in the psyche of the speaker. The last speaker in the poem did in fact fight for his life and the survival of the nation, but in the heat of battle he overstepped the boundaries separating what he may do from what he may not, and unnecessarily set fire to the abandoned clay huts. The speaker's feeling is dramatized; we are actually aware of his feelings of uneasiness, shame, and guilt, which become a lament for the vanquished and the victors. The difference is highlighted by a comparison of this poem with Kovner's writings published in the Dappim after these battles were fought. ... this earth is blood-soaked. The blood is deep in the ground. The blood of ancient Israelites-and our blood. And blood meets blood. And on the ground the invader's boots. For they have come to destroy us-let us remember; For their advisers wanted our surrender and believed we would surrender- let us remember; For we were poor and young, and they could not overcome us- let us remember; For we broke their spirit, we destroyed their strength, we gained the upper hand and we dealt the great bloody blow-let us remember; The earth shall not carry their unclean boots, snakes: go back! For we have made a solemn promise to the graves that were dug, To the scorched hills of the South To the Commanders that led us to victory And to the Jewish People. We s w e a r: DEATH TO THE INVADERS! This text uses some of the same devices that Kovner used in his poetry (anaphora, epiphora, etc.) to convey the immediacy of the battlefield. But whereas the text quoted uses exclamation marks, the poem has question marks. The sharp, clear-cut division between unclean invaders and pure defenders is equally absent. Rhetorical obscurity replaces unmistakable clarity, a loud, ringing statement, as if the author were implying that "this piece of writing is not mine."</page><page sequence="17">KOVNER VS. KOVNER 239 The next poem is called Dafkravi ("Combat Page"), which Shirley Kauf- man translates as "Battle Order."32 From the title we might assume that it is a restatement of a text from the "page," the Dafkravi. In fact the poem diverges significantly from that source and is definitely not what we expect. True, it describes the beginning of a battle, but it is completely different from the original: there is no war cry. On the contrary, the poem raises the legitimate fears of the "infants," the soldiers who were so young, and the attempts of the speaker, who represents the national myth, to encourage them to "break" their fears. However, since this poem has no immediate bearing on my subject, it is not treated here. It is important insofar as the title raises expectations which are not fulfilled: again, this proves that the author does not follow the approach taken in the original Dafkravi. V The fifth and last part of Preda me-ha-darom is ha-daf 'asher nish 'ar ba-kvish ("The Page That Was Left Behind on the Highway").33 Here we find two poems, the first being a shortened version of an authentic text of the Daf kravi 1948 of October 23 (p. 45). The "page" expresses joy over the victorious breakthrough in the South. But it is diametrically opposed to the texts referred to above, and therefore a natural question arises: What is the purpose of this Dafkravi? Hrushovski, for instance, argues that it was meant to convince the reader-not altogether successfully-that the events described served as the background to the poem; it meant, even though it failed, to give the poems some unity, constituting the whole work as a "single narrative or dramatic thread."34 He contends that this text makes no contribution to the unity of the long poem and does not link up with the other poems. In contrast to Hrushovski, it seems to me that the original "page" serves a different purpose. It is not connective material but, conversely, a disclaimer: it suggests that the speaker of Dafkravi, the educational officer of the Giv'ati Brigade, is an "unreliable author" in the new, experiential, psychological, and moral stance developed in Preda me-ha-darom.35 One might say that the 32.

Such a reading of the poem explains the title "The Page That Was Left Behind on the Highway," which implies that the pamphlets Kovner wrote as a politruk, being no longer relevant or wanted, should be dumped somewhere on the highway. In his capacity as chief rhetorician for the Israel Defense Forces, the author wishes to part from himself, to apply other, more humane yardsticks capable of treating the enemy not as monsters but as torn and charred human beings. The text of the "page" is inserted before the last poem in order to highlight the difference between the stock phrases and slogans of the past and humane poetry which emphasizes the pain and suffering of mankind. The poet himself substantiated this some years later in his response to Kaufman's request not to translate this page in order to spare the feelings of American readers:36 A woman tourist ... sent me an English translation of Preda me-ha-darom, but she wants me to let her leave out the passage from Dafkravi .. . She says she understands my sentiments with regard to the text, but she points out that an American reader would neither understand nor accept this material. She does not say it sounds militaristic. Now I do not relate to the Dafkravi in a sentimental way.... The Dappim were written at night or very early in the morning, I worked fast, under makeshift conditions; ... by morning, the soldiers had their "page." ... When I reread those pages now, I ask myself: Did I write those lines? Why is this document included in Preda me-ha-darom? ... I gave it the title "The Page That Was Left Behind on the Highway." What did I want to say? Two things: First, poetry is really a kind of apology, we ask forgiveness for what we do in our lives, and for what people have done to us. If poetry has any moral significance at all, perhaps this is it. It is a vehicle of apology for the evil that is immanent in the human condition.... And lyric poetry is apology. Perhaps that is why this fighters' Dafkravi is included in Preda me-ha-darom. Second, I wanted to say that the fighters' Dafkravi was left behind on the highway, that it was forgotten, to pass into oblivion as the times and real-life situations which it reflected changed. For it is not reality that lasts, but the poetic experience. It lives on in its own special way. That is probably the meaning of these lines from the concluding poem of Preda me-ha-darom that follow the Dafkravi: " A step ends in each step. There--the city? Silence. And nothing but silence. Only young grass- A big tent moves in the wind. A cypress touches a cloud. Sunset. A red shadow rises like an echo in its vault. 36. See above, n. 9.</page><page sequence="19">KOVNER VS. KOVNER 241 Oh, my friends, why are you silent? if the silence is not.37 The passage substantiates my reading of "Voices from the Hill" and the Siege poems; they are a lament for the dead and a prayer asking forgiveness for "what we do in our lives, and for what people have done to us." The Daf Kravi which Kovner introduced before the last poem underlines the difference between the work of Kovner the politruk during the War of Independence and the poetry that "parted" from it when the war was over. The reader is told to leave the one-dimensional "page" "on the highway" to be swept away by the wind, to be consigned to oblivion as he parts from the south and goes back north. It is as though the Kovner of Preda me-ha-darom shuts out his fighters' Combat Page from the world of mirages. It is mentioned only to be forgotten, to delegitimize it and the world it stands for. Preda me-ha-darom is a parting of Kovner the humanist poet from Kovner the politruk who coined catch phrases to motivate his men in times of war. Kovner's poetry belongs to the canon of humanist Hebrew poets, ranking with S. Yizhar's Hirbet Hize' and The prisoner, which were published in the same year as Kovner's long poem (1949). The two authors give expression to the trauma of the battles won by the Israel Defense Forces and the moral dilemmas of the war. Kovner is a humanist; his compelling poetry should form part of the cultural heritage of modem Israel and world Jewry. Haifa University Haifa, Israel 37.
