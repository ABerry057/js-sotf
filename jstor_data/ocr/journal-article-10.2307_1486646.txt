<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sandra B. Lubarsky. Tolerance and Transformation: Jewish Approaches to Religious Pluralism. Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College Press, 1990. x, 149 pp. Religious absolutism is the view that my religion is true and all other reli- gions, to the extent that they contradict mine, are false. Religious relativism, on the other hand, asserts that all religions are equally true or false. Sandra Lubarsky rejects the first of these alternatives because of recent developments in physics which make it clear that we are limited by our subjectivity and physical location, and also because of history, which documents the bloody consequences of religious absolutism, biblical scholarship (the precise role of biblical scholarship in undermining religious absolutism is not explained), and the personal experience of loving those who do not share our traditions. For these reasons, Lubarsky vigorously rejects all forms of religious absolutism. But she also rejects relativism because it denies the existence of truth itself and thereby makes impossible any real sympathy for other traditions. Is there a third alternative? Lubarsky argues that there is and labels it "veridical pluralism," which holds that there is more than one tradition that speaks truth. The truths that traditions speak are partial and may therefore appear to conflict with one another. "But," writes Lubarsky (p. 6), "if what a tradition speaks is really true, then it must be congruent with other statements of truth," since "that which is true is of necessity compatible with all else that is true." Historical religions, then, consist of the true and the false. They contradict each other from their falsehoods and agree with each other in their truths. Since truth is to be preferred over falsehood, it would be very nice to extract the truths of all religions, discard their falsehoods, and emerge with a super-religion free of all falsehood. But wouldn't such a super-religion constitute an absolutism,</page><page sequence="2">296 BOOK REVIEWS since those committed to it would believe that their religion is true and anyone questioning any of its tenets would be in error? It may be, of course, that Lubarsky would deny that any human being can make claim to possessing the final truth in religion. But to the extent that a person believes something to be true, she is an absolutist because she affirms that those who disagree with her are in error. I do not think that veridical pluralism is sufficiently thought through in this book to constitute a third alternative to absolutism and relativism. Early in the book, Lubarsky refers to the apparent contradiction between Judaism, which affirms the existence of God, and Buddhism, which denies God's existence. There is a way, she insists, to integrate these two teachings so "that the self-consistent wholeness of reality is preserved" (p. 14). The attempt at integration is made in the last chapter of the book. But, curiously enough, in that chapter there is no reference to the existence or nonexistence of God. Instead, the major difference found between the two faiths (though Buddhism may not be a faith) is that Judaism is future-oriented while Buddhism is present-oriented. Judaism dreams of a future much better than the present, while for Buddhism it is the present moment itself that is promising. From the Buddhist point of view, "living toward the future constitutes a form of clinging and it is clinging or attachment that is the source of all suffering" (pp. 123-124). On the face of it, these are two very different perspectives, especially when we realize that another way of expressing the difference is to say that Judaism is primarily ethical while Buddhism is primarily aesthetic. But this does not discourage Lubarsky. We can have the best of both worlds. "The Buddhist emphasis on the here-now," she writes (p. 126), "may aid Jews in recovering a sensitivity to God's immediacy and thereby realigning the relationship between the past, present and future." Because God judged the created world to be "very good," we may conclude that this refers to the beauty of the world inasmuch as moral agency is not usually attributed to the created order. And, suggests Lubarsky, Jews may even wish to reconsider the primacy of the ethical over the aesthetic. She quotes Charles Hartshorne and John Cobb, both of whom argue that the aesthetic is more inclusive than the ethical. Buber's stress on the immediacy of the "I-Thou" is, according to Lubarsky, "consistent with the Buddhist orientation to the 'now' "(p. 126). It is possible that the future belongs to a religion that incorporates the best of Judaism and Buddhism, not to speak of a number of other traditions</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 297 that may also have important insights to contribute. But this new religion would not be either Judaism or Buddhism but a new creation. I share Lubarsky's commitment to dialogue but am skeptical that it is possible to find a perspective from which we can pick and choose, separating the wheat from the chaff in all religions so as to remain with a religion that is all wheat and no chaff. Religions have a way of insisting on being the highest criterion and do not easily yield that position of privilege to something higher than they. Nevertheless, dialogue, even transformative dialogue (the term Lubarsky uses for dialogue that has the potential for seriously changing the participants) is necessary. But differences will remain, and perhaps that is not so bad. Michael Wyschogrod Baruch College of the City University of New York New York, N.Y.</page></plain_text>
