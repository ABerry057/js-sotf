The resulting struc turalturaltural tension is analogous to that posed by the prominence of the expert expert witness in the modern American court, or the active role of private private industry in administrative law. This article examines the relationship relationship in the classical rabbinic corpus from Palestine between rabbis rabbis and farmers, or between rabbinic and agricultural expertise. It It considers whether agriculture would have been conceived of in this this context as a specialized or technical body of knowledge, and, if so,so, whether and how agricultural Halakhah accommodates itself to this fact. A legal system is relatively nominalist, on one understanding of this term, to the extent that its rules depend to a lesser degree than they might otherwise on facts of the matter, that is, on facts not produced by the legal system itself. In an earlier article centered on a story in the Babylonian Talmud (B. Sanhedrin 5a-b) about Rav and the herders, I argued that one impetus toward nominalism comes from the desire to disentangle law from complicated bodies of technical fact.1 According to the story, Rabbi Judah the Patriarch denied Rav license to "permit" firstborn animals, that is, to determine that their blemishes are severe enough to render the animals profane. The stam insists that the patriarch's denial did not stem from any lack of familiarity on Rav's part with animal anatomy. Rav had in fact devoted eighteen months to studying the subject with herders. The problem, on the contrary, was that Rav had become too expert. Because the logic of his decisions would remain opaque to other licensed but less knowledgeable experts, and hence sow confusion, the patriarch excluded him from the circle of licensed experts. On the stam's explanation, the rabbinic law of permitting firstborns becomes nominalist by settling for, and indeed insisting upon, knowledge of animal anatomy that is less detailed than the knowledge of the professional Parts of this paper were presented at the Association for Jewish Studies Annual Conference in 2011 and at a conference on "Halakhah and Reality" in 2012, sponsored by Bar Ilan University, New York University, and Cardozo Law School.

The same article provides the framework for a broader inquiry into the relationship between rabbis and other professionals or quasi-professionals, or between rabbinic knowledge and bodies of technical knowledge that are analyti cally independent from rabbinic Halakhah, but to which Halakhah "speaks."3 This essay will consider the relationship between agricultural law and agricultural science, or, more loosely, between rabbis and farmers. Rabbinic texts speak of specialized agricultural tasks, and of an "expert farmer" (4.(איכר אומן But do they recognize a corresponding body of technical farming knowledge that bears on agricultural law? If so, how do they treat it? Is there any evidence of a 2. In the article I collect other passages in the Bavli, most famously the Akhnai story, that high light the possibility of too much knowledge. To these we may perhaps add the Bavli texts that demon strate a reluctance, in practice, to implement rabbinic "blood science," according to the analysis in Samuel Israel Secunda, "'Dashtana'—"ki derekh nashim li'"—A Study of the Babylonian Rabbinic Laws of Menstruation in Relation to Corresponding Zoroastrian Texts" (PhD diss., Yeshiva University, 2007), 61-152. Both in these texts and in the Rav story, a rarefied technical expertise that would dis tinguish the prohibited (sacred) from the permitted (profane) is excluded from halakhic practice, with the result that halakhic practice is more stringent than it need be. See also the story of the Harkinas brothers at B. Yevamot 16a, which echoes the Akhnai story and, more faintly, the story of Rav and the herders. 3.1 treated one aspect of this inquiry in my lecture at the Association for Jewish Studies Annual Conference in 2010 ("Rabbis and Butchers"), which I plan to publish in revised form in the near future. 4. The phrase איכר אומן is probably more precisely translated (pace Gedaliah Alon, The Jews in Their Land Their Land in the Talmudic Age [70-640 C.E.], trans. Gershon Levi [Jerusalem: Magnes, 1980], 1.158 59) as "expert plowman." On this figure see T. Bava Mezi'a 11:9, and implicitly T. Bava Mezi'a 7:5 (pace Saul Lieberman, Tosefta Ki-fshutah: A Comprehensive Commentary on the Tosefta, 3rd ed. [New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 2001], 9.249-50, and see Jehuda Feliks, Agriculture in Pales tine tine in the Period of the Mishna and Talmud [Jerusalem and Tel-Aviv: Magnes and Dvir, 1963], 29); M. Bava Mezi'a 8:1; M. 'Arakhin 6:3 (on which see Hayim Lapin, Early Rabbinic Civil Law and the Social History History of Roman Galilee: A Study of Mishnah Tractate Baba' Mezi'a [Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1995], 204 n. 182). For the association of the איכר with plowing see also, e.g., Jeremiah 51:23; M. 'Ohalot 6:1;6:1; T. Yom Tov 4:6; Daniel Goldschmidt, ed., Seder ha-kinnot le-tish'a be-'av (Jerusalem: Mosad Harav Kook, 1972), 148 1. 9 (שור אכרים, from a qerovah by Qillir); and cf. Syriac 'KR (pael). The terms בקר (baqqar) and תוור (tawar) in the Talmuds (on which see Meir Ayali, Workers and Artisans: Their Their Labor and Status in Rabbinic Literature [Givatayim: Yad la-Talmud, 1987], 32) probably refer to the same expert plowman. We may venture that a farmer would hire such an individual, together with his oxen, for the first, more strenuous plowing. See Lucius Iunius Moderatus Columella, On Agri culture,culture, trans. Harrison Boyd, Loeb Classical Library (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1940), 2.2.24; Gildas Hamel, Poverty and Charity in Roman Palestine, First Three Centuries C.E. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990), 114-15 and nn. 114-15, 121-22. For the notion that the plowman (arator, bubulcus), unlike the common farm laborer, must have special physical characteristics, and in particular, that he be tall enough to intimidate the cattle, see Columella, On Agriculture, 1.9.3. On the fragmentation of Palestinian estates, which incentivized hiring rather than owning draught animals, see Daniel Sperber, Roman Palestine 200-400: The Land: Crisis and Change in Agrarian Society as Reflected Reflected in Rabbinic Sources (Ramat-Gan: Bar-Ilan University Press, 1978), 207, and for a remark that appears to assume the general disadvantageousness of fragmentation see Avot de-Rabbi Natan, A:8 (ed. Schechter, p. 18b) and Avot de-Rabbi Natan, B:18 (ed. Schechter, p. 20a). 304</page><page sequence="3">"Like an Expert Sharecropper" desire to disentangle agricultural law from agricultural fact, or, in other words, to construct agricultural law in nominalist terms? Greco-Roman Background The status of agriculture as a subject is a question that Greek and Roman writers debated across many centuries. In Xenophon's Oeconomicus, of the early fourth century bce, Isomachus manages to persuade Socrates that "farming is not trouble some to learn, like other arts (rejyaq), which the pupil must study till he is worn out before he can earn his keep by his work. Some things you can understand by watching men at work, others by just being told, well enough to teach another if you wish" (15.10).5 Because one can pick up sufficient agricultural knowledge incidentally, through observation and casual inquiry, the qualities that ultimately separate the good farmer from the bad are care and diligence, not knowledge. "[T]he slothful cannot plead ignorance, as in other arts: land, as all men know, responds to good treat ment. Husbandry is the clear accuser of the recreant soul" (20.14—15). Antonius, a character in Cicero's first-century BCE dialogue, On the Orator, takes his cue from Xenophon's Isomachus. In arguing against Crassus that the art of the orator does not demand detailed study of the common law, Antonius com pares rhetoric to agriculture. For it is one thing to be a craftsman in a specific subject and art, and another to be no dullard or raw hand in social life and the general practices of mankind. Which of us may not survey his estate or go to see his rural concerns, whether in quest of profit or of amusement? Yet no one passes his days so bereft of sight and sense as to be wholly ignorant of the nature of sowing and reaping, or of lopping of trees and pruning of vines, or of the times of year for doing these things, or of how they are done. If then some one of us has occasion to look over his estate, or give some commission to his agent, or order to his bailiff, on details of husban dry, need he get by heart the volumes of Mago of Carthage? Or may we be sat isfied with our own mother-wit? (1.58.248-49) Antonius appears to accept that there is a technical science of agriculture, of the sort elucidated in Mago's treatise, which was translated from Punic into Latin with the sponsorship of the Roman Senate.6 But Antonius denies that expert agricultural knowledge is relevant for estate management in the ordinary course of things.7 Varro, a contemporary of Cicero, appears to respond to Antonius's position in his dialogue, On Agriculture, also from the first century BCE.8 A character named 5.

It is, as well, a science (scientia), which teaches what crops are to be planted in each kind of soil, and what operations are to be carried on, in order that the land may regularly produce the largest crops" (1.3). For Scrofa, the profitable farmer is one well versed in agricultural science. Two generations after Varro, Columella, at the beginning of his technical treatise On Agriculture, takes vigorous issue with "the common notion ... that farming is ... a business which has no need of direction or precept." He, on the contrary, marvels at the subject's magnitude, "like the immensity of some great body," and at "the minuteness of its several parts" (l.preface.21). Both Varro (through the mouths of his characters) and Columella recommend attentiveness to the agricultural wisdom of ancient and contemporary farmers, as well as personal experimentation.10 Among those who recognize an agricultural science we may also count the Jewish philosopher-exegete Philo, who, in his On Husbandry, distinguishes between Noah the "husbandman" (yscopyo(;) and Cain the "worker of the ground."11 The latter is Xenophon's farmer, who merely expends effort, and "carries very heavy loads" (21). The former, by contrast, is proficient in the science of husbandry (xfj&lt;; yeropYiKfji; 1£%\ןז׳&lt;;), not an "unprofessional" (iSio'jrric, rabbinic Hebrew הדיוט) but a "skilled worker" (f:|J.7n:1poc, the equivalent of the rabbinic 12.(4) (אומן Agriculture emerges in these sources as a contested area: the common knowl edge of a farming society, for some, but for others, a technical science. In the sec tions that follow we turn to the rabbinic literature of Roman Palestine (especially the Mishnah, the Tosefta, and the Yerushalmi) for evidence of rabbinic views on agriculture and, most importantly, on the extent to which agricultural Halakhah depends on technical agricultural knowledge. In view of the wide scope of the rel evant corpus—an entire order of the Mishnah is dedicated to laws bearing on agri culture, and discussions that implicate agriculture also occur throughout the other five orders of the Mishnah, and in related texts—and of the fact that the corpus only addresses these questions incidentally, the aim here is not to provide exhaustive answers, but to collect and explicate the most relevant texts and patterns.

Shevi'it 5:1 [35d]) the Yerushalmi probes the "one third" standard, that is, the rule that the fruits of a tree that have reached one third of their growth before the New Year belong to the previous year's crop for the purpose of tithing. The passage of immediate interest to us addresses the standard's apparent imprecision. ר' בון בר חייא בעא קומי ר' זעירא מעתה שליש הראשון לשעבר ושליש השיני לבא אמי ליה שליש הראשון קשה לבוא מכיון שהוא בא מיד הוא גדל אמי ר' בא ב(!)אריס אומן ילף לה ר' זעירא שמואל אמי שיתין יומין שו(!)תה עליי שיתא יומין שיתין עליי R. Bun b. Hiyya asked before R. Zeira: On this basis, the first third should count for the previous one, and the second third for the coming one? He said to him: The first third comes with difficulty. Once it comes, it grows immediately. Said R. Ba: R. Zeira learned it like an expert sharecropper. Samuel said: Sixty days, six leaves; six days, sixty leaves.13 R. Bun would have the year for tithing correspond precisely to growth. If the fruit completes one third of its growth by the New Year, then that one third should be tithed according to the previous year, while the other two thirds should be tithed according to the following year. R. Zeira offers a scientific defense of the one-third standard. The final two thirds of the fruit's growth are, as it were, contained in the first third, because it is in the first third of its growth that the fruit expends effort, while the final two thirds follow easily afterward. R. Zeira's claim is presumably connected to the view, which he himself assumes in a statement cited numerous times in the Yer ushalmi, that the seed of a fruit that has attained one third of its growth is viable.14 Samuel's statement confirms that the initial growth is the slowest.15 13. For this and other citations from the Yerushalmi I use the text of MS Leiden. According to Peter Schafer and Hans-Jiirgen Becker's synoptic edition (Synopse zum Talmud Yerushalmi [Tubingen: J.C.B. Mohr, 1991]), באריס is much better attested than כאריס, but the latter is undoubtedly the correct reading. 14. Y. Hallah. 1:3 (57d); Y. Ma'aserot. 1:1 (48d); 1:3 (49a); Y. Shevi'it2:7 (34a). In the last instance, R. Zeira's statement is followed immediately by the very same question (but without attribution) that R. Bun b. Hiyya asks in the above passage. R. Yohanan responds to the question differently from R. Zeira, with exegesis rather than science. R. Yohanan's response also occurs, in his name, in B. Rosh ha-Shanah 12b. Interestingly, in the Bavli, R. Yohanan's response is given a naturalistic interpretation, perhaps— the back-and-forth is unclear—by R. Zeira himself. For another case in which a rabbinic measure—the maximum size of a freewill meal offering—is explained exegetically by one rabbi or school (R. Yehudah b. Ilai, on one version), and naturalistically by another (R. Shim'on), see M. Menahot. 12:4 (var iants: T. Menahot 12:8-9; B. Menahot 103b). Both R. Zeira in B. Rosh ha-Shanah 12b and R. Shim'on in the meal offering exchange end up defending the naturalistic position, in almost identical words, by con ceding that the measure's bright line is arbitrary, even though the measure does in fact track a natural phenomenon. R. Zeira's defense undoubtedly depends on R. Shim'on's. It is possible that in B. Rosh ha-Shanah 12b, R. Shim'on's position has been reinterpreted (by R. Zeira or the stam speaking through him) so that the point is not that rabbinic measures represent arbitrary cutoffs, but that the rabbis, in imple menting bright-line measures, can in fact precisely track the underlying natural phenomenon. 15. The notion that a plant's rate of growth is variable occurs also in Plutarch's "How a Man May Become Aware of His Progress in Virtue," 77 (in the first volume of his Moralia, trans. Frank 307</page><page sequence="6">TzviTzvi Novick What does R. Ba mean when he observes that R. Zeira has responded like an expert sharecropper? Is his tone condescending? Complimentary? Neutral?16 It is worth noting that R. Zeira may well have been a sharecropper, or something like it. The Yerushalmi (Y. Bava Mezi'a 4:12 [9d]) reports that he worked in flax (עסק בהדא כיתנא.(כיתנא). R. Zeira tells elsewhere (Y. Berakhot 1:1 [2d]) that he was conscripted into agri cultural labor, which was often the fate of small landholders in the vicinity of imperial estates, who were given cultivation rights with the understanding that they would, in exchange, contribute their labor to those estates.17 Be that as it may, R. Ba speaks directly not to R. Zeira's occupation, but to the social location of the information that he has invoked. R. Zeira answers R. Bun's question less as a rabbi than as a farmer well versed in agricultural science. R. Ba's statement acknowledges a difference between halakhic discourse (unmarked) and specialized farming discourse (marked). The construction of agriculture as a distinct body of knowledge also emerges implicitly from a formula that occurs almost exclusively in the Tosefta and the Yer ushalmi, and generally—in the Yerushalmi almost always—with reference to agri culture. After stating a law that implicates a finding of fact, the anonymous voice asks: How does one know (יודע), or, how does one determine (18?(בודק The Cole Babbitt, Loeb Classical Library [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1927]), albeit in this case with the fastest growth at the start: "We may compare a reed, the growth of which at its beginning has a very great impetus, which results in an even and continuous length, at first in long sections, since it meets with few obstacles and repulses, but later, as though for lack of breath as it gets higher up, it grows weak and weary, and is gathered up in the many frequent nodules, when the life-giving spirit meets with buffets and shocks." 16. Neither traditional nor modern commentators (e.g., Yehuda Feliks, Talmud Yerushalmi: Tractate Tractate Shevi'it, 2nd ed. [Jerusalem: Rubin Mass, 2000], 316) hear any undertone in the remark. There is a certain structural analogy between R. Ba's comment about R. Zeira's response and the anon ymous Yerushalmi's reflection on a comment by R. Zeira in Y. Terumot 11:3 (47d). On the latter passage see Furstenberg, "Eating," 90-91. 17. Moshe Gil, "The Decline of the Agrarian Economy in Palestine under Roman Rule," JESHOJESHO 49 (2006): 286, 301.

For a list of the instances in the Yerushalmi see Moshe Assis, A Concordance of Amoraic Terms,Terms, Expressions and Phrases in the Yerushalmi (Jerusalem: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 2010), 718. In the Tosefta, the "know" formula is consistently distinguished from the "deter mine" formula in the following ways: (1) only the question "how does one know" ends with "whether [x is the case] or not" (2) ;(אם ... אם לאו) the "know" question is always in the singular (יודע), and the "determine" question always in the plural (בודקין); and (3) the "know" formula occurs exclusively in agricultural contexts, and the "determine" formula exclusively in sacrificial and purity matters. These distinctions do not hold for the Yerushalmi. The "know" formula never ends with "whether [x is the case] or not"; the Yerushalmi uses the singular for both formulae; and both formulae occur, with very rare exceptions, exclusively in agricultural cases. Another difference between the Tosefta and the Yerushalmi is that in the Tosefta, the answer to the question is almost always anonymous, 308</page><page sequence="7">"Like an Expert Sharecropper" following example is typical. The Mishnah (M. 'Orlah 1:5) cites the anonymous view that in the case of a shoot of a vine that has been directed into the soil, so that it grows its own roots, the shoot does not have the status of an independent plant, and hence is not subject to the law of the "foreskin" (ערלה), which prohibits consumption of the fruit of a plant for three years after its planting. R. Meir contends that the shoot is only exempt if the shoot has been planted in poor soil. In the Yer ushalmi (Y. 'Orlah 1:5 [61a]), R. Abbahu, in the name of R. Yohanan and R. Hisda, contends that the debate between the anonymous view and R. Meir occurs only when one does not know whether the shoot is nourished (chiefly) from itself ("the youngling") or from the vine ("the elder"), for if it is certain that the shoot is nourished from itself, all agree that it constitutes a new plant, and if from the elder, then all agree that it does not constitute a new plant. The Yerushalmi probes this position. How can one know the source of the shoot's nutrition? And if it is possible to know, then how can the situation of ignorance—the only situation subject to the debate in the Mishnah, according to R. Abbahu—ever arise? כיצד הוא יודע ר' ביבי בשם ר' חנינה אם היו העלים הפוכין כלפי הילדה דבר בריא שהוא חי מכה הזקנה ואם היו העלים הפוכין כלפי הזקנה דבר בריא שהוא חי מכח הילדה אמר ר' יודן בר חנין סימנא דאכל מן חבריה בהית מסתכלא ביה אמר ר' יודן אבוי דר' מתנייה תיפתר שנשרו העלין How does one know? R. Bibi in the name of R. Haninah: If the leaves are turned toward the youngling, it is certain that it lives from the strength of the elder.19 And if the leaves are turned toward the elder, it is certain that it lives from the strength of the youngling. Said R. Yudan b. Hanin: The mnemo nic is, one who eats from his friend is embarrassed to look at him. Said R. Yudan father of R. Metanya: Resolve it as being when the leaves have fallen. R. Bibi reports that one can use the orientation of the leaves on the youngling as an indicator of the source of its nutrition, for the leaves consistently point away from whereas in the Yerushalmi it is almost always attributed. For בדק with the sense of (scientific) investi gation see also Y. Hallah 1:1 (57a), and note (per Robert Murray, Symbols of Church and Kingdom: A Study Study in Early Syriac Tradition [Piscataway, NJ: Gorgias Press, 2004], 23) that the position of badoqa in the Christian school at Nisibis appears to describe a teacher of secular subjects. The question "how does one do (עושה)?" sometimes occurs in the Yerushalmi in contexts close to those in which the above formulae occur. See, e.g., Y. Shevi'it 4:4 (35b); Y. Terumot 9:1 (46c); Y. Mo'ed Katan 1:4 (80c); Y. 'Avodah Zarah 2:3 (41b). One instance, in Y. Yevamot 8:2 (9b), is especially noteworthy, because it concerns knowledge that is very explicitly tagged as specialized. The Yerushalmi cites a tannaitic state ment (paralleled in Sifrei Devarim,pis. 247 to Deuteronomy 23:2 [ed. Finkelstein, p. 276]) to the effect that the only difference between the priest with crushed testicles and the priest with a cut member is a matter of "medical practice" (הלכות רופאין), namely, that the former is treatable while the latter is not. The anonymous voice poses the question, "how does one do," to which a named rabbi responds with a medical procedure that addresses the symptoms of the crushed testicle. 19. Elsewhere in the Yerushalmi the term "it is certain" (דבר בריא) occurs by itself, i.e., indepen dent from the "how does one know/determine?" question, in contexts that likewise involve technical agricultural detail. See, e.g., Y. 'Orlah 1:4 (61a). 309</page><page sequence="8">TzviTzviTzvi Novick the source. What, then, is the case of uncertainty, where the Mishnah's debate arises? When there are no leaves. This short sugya can be read as a kind of turn and counterturn around the problem of rabbinic law and technical fact. R. Abbahu's statement confines the debate in the Mishnah to the case of uncertainty, and thus relieves the law of the need to make a factual determination. It is precisely where no factual determi nation can be made that the law speaks. Relegation of the law to the case of uncer tainty is a common move in. rabbinic dialectic, but the exchange in the continuation of the sugya—the "how does one know" question and its after math—exposes this move as a strategic way of aligning law with the question of fact without directly engaging that question in any real detail. In this case, the sugya powers beyond this point, to delve precisely into the factual question. The existence of fixed formulae—"how does one know/determine?"—for such turns to (chiefly agricultural) fact marks them off as a distinct form of inquiry, which we may with good reason call that of the "expert sharecropper." The Minimum Vineyard The Mishnah's overview of the laws of "mingled species of the vineyard" (כלאי הכרם) in tractate Kil'ayim (chapters 4-7) is almost wholly occupied with the question of whether a given formation of vines constitutes a vineyard. If it does, then the prohibition against planting another species holds for the entire area, and four cubits beyond it. If it does not, then the prohibition applies only to the six handbreadths around each vine. There is evidence that these vineyard formations, and the dimensions ascribed to them, served as the paradigm cases of linear measurement for early rabbinic authorities.20 The foundational measurement is that of the minimum vineyard. According to M. Kil'ayim 4:6, the smallest vineyard is one that consists of two vines aligned across from two vines, with a third "protruding as a tail" (יוצא זנב). If, according to the anonymous view in M. Kil'ayim 5:1, the vines are planted in a jumble, rather than in rows, they constitute a vineyard only if it is possible to discern an arrange ment of two opposite three. Contemporary Roman writers also recommend plant ing vines in units of five, but in their case, the five vines take the form of a quincunx, with two vines in opposite rows, and the fifth in between the two pairs, equidistant from all four vines. According to Varro's Scrofa, the quincunx 20. Thus T. Kelim Bava Mezi'a 6:13 articulates a general rule concerning "the measurements that the sages spoke of with reference to the vineyard"—that is, the four vineyard formations listed in the Tosefta pericope, as well as in M. Kil'ayim 7:3—but in the continuation appears to apply this rule to all measurements, whether of the vineyard or not. Indeed, the parallel Mishnah pericope, M. Kelim 16:10, speaks of "all the cubits," with no reference to the vineyard. Remarkably, the same variation occurs between M. Kil'ayim 6:6 and the Yerushalmi commentary thereon. The Mishnah states a rule (one that very closely resembles the rule in T. Kelim Bava Mezi'a 6:13) with reference to "the measure ments that the sages spoke of with reference to the vineyard." R. Yonah, in the Yerushalmi (Y. Kil'ayim 6:6 [30c]), challenges the restriction of the rule to the vineyard. The Yerushalmi offers various responses to R. Yonah's challenge, but none survives, so that in the Yerushalmi, as in M.

"Our ancestors, on the same amount of land but not so well laid out, made less wine and grain than we do, and of a poorer quality" (1.7.2).21 The Mishnah (M. Kil'ayim 4:6) is familiar with the quincunx arrangement, but denies it the status of a vineyard. Whether we are to see in this denial a traditionalist or a nativist or an anti-Roman sentiment is uncertain, but, as we will later observe, rabbis do recognize a link between their planting practices and their native soil.22 Two pericopes, one in the Tosefta and one in the Yerushalmi, concern the rabbinic definition of the vineyard, and offer insight into the question of technical agricultural knowledge and its relationship to rabbinic agricultural law. The Tosefta (T. Kil'ayim 3:5) reports that the case of the jumbled vineyard came before R. Gamaliel. He instructs his interlocutors to go and ask a certain Yose b. Giali (Golai, according to the editio princeps), whom he characterizes as "one most well versed" (בר ובקי) in "the laws of the vineyard" (23.(הלכות הכרם Yose provides the answer enshrined anonymously in M. Kil'ayim 5:1: If it is poss ible to discern an arrangement of four vines in two rows, plus a tail, then it is a vineyard. Why does R. Gamaliel not know the law? Why is it known to Yose b. Giali? Is R. Gamaliel's ignorance connected with the fact that, as a large landholder who leased his estate to sharecroppers, he was less than familiar with matters pertaining to vineyards, and especially small ones?24 Virtually nothing is known of Yose b. Giali outside of this source.25 Nor can we be sure of the nature of the expertise attributed to him here. I have rendered the phrase הלכות הכרם as "the laws of the vineyard," but in fact, outside of this case, the word הלכה occurs in tractate Kil'ayim (Mishnah and Tosefta) only in the phrase: "[a vine formation] planted in accord with its הלכה," that is, its way (M. Kil'ayim 5:1; T. Kil'ayim 3:5-6). Thus, what Yose knows may be characterized less as law than as fact, and in par ticular, the conventions of viticulture. But just as the term הלכה itself spans is and ought,ought, so Yose's knowledge bears directly on legal questions.26 A set of three interrelated stories that also involve ignorance about matters connected to the laws of mingled species of the vineyard sheds some additional light on the varying levels of expertise in this body of law within rabbinic 21. On the quincunx see also Columella, On Agriculture, 3.13.3; 15.1-2; 16.2. 22. For a case where tannaitic literature reflects a view that Roman agricultural writers charac terize as the traditional but misguided view of farmers, see Furstenberg, "Eating," 175. 23.

Gamaliel's economic status see Shaye Cohen, "The Rabbi in Second-Century Jewish Society," in Cambridge History ofJudaism, vol. 3, The Early Roman Period, ed. William Horbury et al.

Yoma 39a) that his father's goats, though herded at some distance from Jerusalem, nevertheless bore the odor of the Temple incense. 26.

Cf. the phrase הלכות רופאין quoted in n. IB. 311</page><page sequence="10">TzviTzviTzvi Novick circles. One of the three stories, which occurs in the Bavli (B. 'Eruvin lib), makes explicit reference to such expertise. הלך ר' יהושע אצל ר' יוחנן בן נורי ללמדו תורה אע"פ שבקי בהלכות כלאים ומצאו שיושב בין אילנות ומתח זמורה בין אילן לאילן ואמי לו איבעא גפני' כאן מהו לזרוע אמי לו בעשר מותר ביותר מעשר אסור R. Joshua went to R. Yohanan b. Nuri that he might teach him Torah, even though he was well versed in the laws of mingled species. And he found him sitting among trees. And he extended a vine shoot from tree to tree and he said to him: If vines were here, could one seed [another species] there? He said to him: If the distance is ten, it is permissible, but if more than ten, it is forbidden.27 The halakhic question is whether "the form of a doorframe" (צורת הפתח) constitutes a partition, whether for the Sabbath, so as to demarcate a property as private, or, in particular here, for the laws of mingled species, so as to allow one to plant vines on one side and another species on the other without leaving any additional space. In the above story, attributed to R. Yohanan, R. Joshua asks R. Yohanan b. Nuri about the status of a vine shoot stretched across two trees, so as to form the shape of a doorframe. R. Yohanan b. Nuri counts this quasi-doorframe as a partition, so long as the distance between the two trees is ten cubits or less. What appears to be a different version of the same story occurs in the parallel sugya in the Yerushalmi (Y. 'Eruvin 1:9 [19c] = Y. Kil'ayim 4:4 [29b] = Y. Sukkah 1:1 [52a]), again in the name of R. Yohanan. מעשה שהלך ר' יהושע בן קרחה אצל ר' יוחנן בן נורי לנגנגד והראהו שדה אחת ובית חבירתה היתה נקראת והיו שם פרצות יותר מעשר והיה נוטל אעים וסותם דוקרנין וסותם עד שמיעטן פחות מעשר אמי כזו כן מחיצת שבת A story: R. Joshua b. Korhah went to R. Yohanan b. Nuri to Ginegar, and he showed him a field that was called the white house (?), and there were breaches there larger than ten. And he took planks and sealed it, pitchforks and sealed it, until he had reduced them to less than ten. He said: Like this, so is the partition for the Sabbath.28 While the traveler in the Bavli's version, R. Joshua, is presumptively R. Joshua b. Hananiah, the R. Joshua in the Yerushalmi's version is R. Joshua b. Korhah. The details of the two rabbis' interactions also vary. A traditional commentator on the Yerushalmi, Ber Ratner ('Ahavat Ziyon ve-Yerushalayim, on Y. Kil'ayim 4:4&gt; speaks for many when he argues in favor 27. The text is from MS Munich 95. 28. The field is presumably not R. Yohanan b. Nuri's own. For another case in which R. Yohanan b. Nuri forcibly intervenes in response to a violation of the laws of mingled species of the vineyard in Ginegar, see Y. Kil'ayim 6:6 (30c). In M. Kil'ayim 6:6, he emphatically expresses his view on a matter related to the one at the center of the latter story. 312</page><page sequence="11">"Like an Expert Sharecropper" of the Yerushalmi's originality. "The version [in the Bavli] is puzzling, for R. Joshua b. Hananiah would not go to R. Yohanan b. Nuri." It is more natural, on this view, that R. Joshua b. Korhah, a third-generation Tanna, rather than R. Joshua b. Hananiah, an early second-generation Tanna, should have traveled to receive instruction from R. Yohanan b. Nuri, a late second-generation Tanna. But this view, even if correct, furnishes no grounds for emending the Bavli (against almost all witnesses) so that it, too, features R. Joshua b. Korhah. On the contrary, the Bavli's apologetic qualifier, "even though he was well versed in the law of mingled species," should be taken as evidence that the Bavli indeed takes its R. Joshua to be R. Joshua b. Hananiah. It is precisely because R. Joshua should not, in the Bavli's view, be going to his junior colleague for instruction in the laws of mingled species that the Bavli deems it necessary to insist on R. Joshua's competence in the area. Moreover, the consideration that Ratner raises is far from dispositive. One tannaitic source (T. Ta'anit 2:5) imagines R. Joshua (b. Hananiah) conceding to R. Yohanan b. Nuri in a debate. Even more pertinently, M. Kil'ayim 6:4 (paralleled in T. Kil'ayim 4:7) tells of R. Joshua (b. Hananiah) visiting another late second generation Tanna, R. Ishmael, and engaging him, in the field, in a conversation about the laws of mingled species. מעשה שהלך ר' יהושע אצל ר' ישמעא' לכפר עזיז והראהו גפן שהיא מודלה על מיקצת תאינה אמי לו מה אני להביא זרע תחת המותר אמי לו מותר והעלהו משם לבית המגנייא והראהו גפן שהוא מודלה על מקצת הקורא בתוך סדן שלשיקמה ובו קורות הרבה אמי לו תחת הקורא זו אסור והשאר מותר A story: R. Joshua went to R. Ishmael in Kefar Aziz, and he showed him a vine trained over part of a fig tree. He said to him: May I introduce seeds under the remainder [of the fig tree]? He said to him: It is permitted. He brought him from there to the house of Maganya and showed him a vine trained on part of a branching in the trunk of a sycamore, and in [the trunk] were many branchings. He said to him: Under this branching is forbidden, and the remainder is permissible.29 It is not certain who asks whom in this exchange. In another exchange between R. Ishmael and R. Joshua (M. 'Avodah Zarah 2:5), the two rabbis come off more or less as equals. Whichever way the conversation is construed, but especially if R. Joshua asks the questions, the story offers further evidence that R. Joshua b. Hananiah's seniority does not, in itself, compel us to identify R. Yohanan b. Nuri's visitor as R. Joshua b. Korhah rather than R. Joshua b. Hananiah.30 If the Bavli's story indeed represents a secondary version of the Yerushal mi's, the shift from R. Joshua b. Korhah to R. Joshua (b. Hananiah), along with 29. The text is from MS Kaufinann. 30. It is worth noting that another story involving the visit of a Tanna (R. Eliezer) to his student is recorded only a few lines after the story of R. Joshua and R. Yohanan b. Nuri in B. 'Eruvin lib. 313</page><page sequence="12">TzviTzviTzvi Novick other details that distinguish it from the Yerushalmi's version (a question about the planting of "seeds"; the extending of a vine over a tree; a concluding statement distinguishing between the permissible and the forbidden), may have been influ enced by the story of R. Joshua and R. Ishmael in M. Kil'ayim 6:4.31 However we construe the relationship between the three stories, the Bavli's apology for R. Joshua—"even though he was well versed in the laws of mingled species"— is specific to the Bavli, and, as we have noted, likely reflects its own anxiety about the possibility of rabbinic ignorance, or perhaps, about the possibility that a junior colleague might know more than a senior one.32 Together, the three stories reinforce the notion that some rabbis were more conversant in the laws of mingled species than others, but, at least in the two stories in Palestinian sources, relative ignorance is not a matter of anxiety. The stories also highlight a different dimension of the laws of mingled species that bears on our inquiry, namely, their visual character. In both the Mishnah and the Yerushalmi, the halakhic analysis originates in situ, in the act of pointing out (הראה) a feature of a vineyard or field. Laws that implicate complex visual details are often precisely those in which questions of expertise, and of the struc turing of rabbinic knowledge vis-a-vis that of other professions, arise. Thus halakhic texts speak, for example, of "appearances of afflictions" (מראות נגעים; M. Nega'im 1:1) and "seeing (i.e., diagnosing) afflictions" (רואין את הנגעים; T. Mo'ed Katan 1:8); of and "showing" a firstborn animal to an expert in animal blemishes (הראהו למומחה; T. Bekhorot 3:2).33 In the above stories, the laws of mingled species take their place, if a peripheral one, among these other, intensely visual bodies of law.34 31. If the Bavli read the Yerushalmi's story against the background of the Mishnah's, it may have been led to do so not only because of the similarity of their general circumstances and the involve ment in both of a R. Joshua, but also because both involve a field associated with a toponym consisting of a construct phrase governed by the word בית. 32. The words ללמדו תורה in the Bavli story could be read to indicate that R. Joshua traveled to teach teach R. Yohanan b. Nuri. All of the other extant witnesses in the Saul Lieberman Institute of Talmud Research database (version 5) have ללמוד תורה "to study Torah," which makes far better sense—the student conventionally travels—and is almost certainly original. If the deviant formulation in MS Munich 95 in fact conveys that R. Joshua taught R. Yohanan b. Nuri, then it is most easily understood as a later and more radical response to the same discomfort that probably occasioned the "even though he was well versed in the laws of mingled species" qualifier. 33.1 touched upon this topic in my lecture at the Association for Jewish Studies Annual Con ference in 2010 ("Rabbis and Butchers"), and plan to return to it at greater length. 34. Though it is generally supposed that R. Yohanan b. Nuri and R. Ishmael lived, respectively, in the apparently small villages Ginegar and Kefar Aziz, the only evidence linking them to these locations is the above stories, and another in the Yerushalmi (Y. Kil'ayim 6:6 [30c]) in which R. Yohanan b. Nuri burns mingled species in Ginegar. Other sources firmly link R. Yohanan b. Nuri to Beth She'arim, a larger center a few kilometers west of Ginegar. See Ben Zion Rosenfeld, Torah Centers Centers and Rabbinic Activity in Palestine, 70-400 CE: History and Geographic Distribution (Leiden: Brill, 2010), 68, 127. The possibility must be entertained that these rabbis lived and/or taught not in the small villages associated with their names, but near them, and traveled to the villages to instruct in and enforce agricultural law. For apt reservations about Rosenfeld's methodology see Joshua Schwartz^ review in Review of Biblical Literature 2012 (http://www.bookreviews.org). 314</page><page sequence="13">"Like an Expert Sharecropper" The second datum on the minimum vineyard that bears on our inquiry occurs in the Yerushalmi's commentary (Y. Kil'ayim 4:6 [29c]) on M. Kil'ayim 4:6, which specifies the number and arrangement of the vines in such a vineyard. The commentary on the Mishnah pericope begins with the following exchange. ר' חייה בר בא בשם ר' חייא בר יוסף ארץ כנען לגבולותיה גבולות שבדו להם הכנעניים ר' אימי בעי ולמידין מן הכנעניים R. Hiyya b. Ba in the name of R. Hiyya b. Yosef: "The land of Canaan accord ing to its boundaries" [Numbers 34:2]. The boundaries that the Canaanites conceived. R. Immi asked: And do we learn from the Canaanites? It is far from obvious that the quoted exegesis of Numbers 34:2, taken by itself, means to provide a basis for the Mishnah's definition of the minimum vineyard. We will return to this issue below. For now let us note that R. Immi's challenge takes the exegesis as an attempt to ground some sort of conclusion, probably the one in the Mishnah. This challenge is followed, in the Yerushalmi, by two statements about the minimum vineyard. While traditional commentaries (e.g., the Penei Moshe) suppose that these statements respond to and acknowledge R. Immi's challenge by offering different arguments for the logic of the minimum vineyard, it is possible that the statements are not intended as responses to R. Immi, but address a different question.35 Another version of R. Hiyya b. Ba's teaching occurs in the Bavli (B. Shabbat 85a). The Mishnah pericope to which it attaches, M. Shabbat 9:2, offers a proof text for a notion conveyed in M. Kil'ayim 3:1, that one can plant seeds of five dis tinct species in a bed that measures six handbreadths by six handbreadths in such a way that the seeds do not draw nourishment from each other, so that one does not run afoul of the laws of mingled species. The Bavli assumes that the prooftext by itself is insufficient. How, it asks, can the rabbis ultimately be sure that five seeds planted in such an arrangement do not intermingle? דא״ר חייא בר אבא א״ר יוחנן לא תשיג גבול רעך אשר גבלו ראשונים גבו' שגבלו ראשונים לא תשיג ומאי גבול גבלו ראשונים א״ר שמואל בר נחמני א״ר יונתן אלה בני שעיר החרי יושבי הארץ אטו כליה (!) עלמא יושבי רקיע נינהו אלא שהיו בקיאי' בישיבה של ארץ [ישרי] שהיו או' מלא קנה זה לגפן מלא קנה זה לתאנה וחורי שמריחין את הארץ וחוי שהיו טועמין את הארץ כחיווי For R. Hiyya b. Abba said in the name of R. Yohanan:36 "You shall not move aside your countryman's boundaries, which the first ones bounded" 35. For the latter possibility see, e.g., the translation of Heinrich W. Guggenheimer (The Jerii salemsalem Talmud, First Order: Zeraim, Tractates Kilaim and Sevi'it [Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2001], 160-61). 36. I cite MS Munich 95. A minority of manuscripts (Oxford Opp. Add. fol. 23; JTS ENA 2069.26) mistakenly attribute the statement to R. Samuel b. Nahmani in the name of R. Yohanan, the authors of the statement that follows afterward. 315</page><page sequence="14">TzviTzvi Novick [Deuteronomy 19:14], The boundary that the first one bounded, do not move aside. And what is the boundary that the first ones bounded? Said R. Samuel b. Nahmani in the name of R. Jonathan: "These are the children of Seir, the Horite, inhabitants of the land" [Genesis 36:20]." And are all others inhabi tants of the firmament? Rather, they were expert in making the land habit able,37 for they would say: The full length of this rod is [suitable] for vines, the full length of this rod is [suitable] for figs.38 And "Horite" [ibid.]: that they would sniff the earth. And "Hivite" [Genesis 36:2]39: that they would taste the earth like a snake.40 In the Bavli passage, as in the Yerushalmi, the author of the statement about the boundary makers is R. Hiyya b. Ba. The second comment, which is introduced to elucidate the first, is also attributed to Palestinian Amoraim, R. Samuel b. Nahmani and R. Jonathan. The two versions of R. Hiyya b. Ba's teaching are attached to different aspects of the law of mingled species: in the Yerushalmi, to the law of minimum vineyard, and in the Bavli, to the law of five seeds in a bed. Is it possible to ascertain which context, if either, is original? Both versions depend on the word גבול (boundary). But only a bed is said, in rabbinic literature (M. Kil'ayim 3:1-2; B. Shabbat 85a), to be surrounded by a גבול. A vineyard is surrounded instead by a fence (גדר; e.g., M. Kil'ayim 4:2) or partition (מחיצה; e.g., T. Kil'ayim 3:2). If, then, we are to suppose a common origin for the two versions, then the more original context is more likely the bed. Most likely the teaching was not originally offered in the context of the law of mingled species at all, and did not speak originally to the Canaanites' purported agricultural expertise. Rather, it constructs the Canaanites as surveyors, who estab lished and marked the boundaries of the land that Israel would later conquer.41 37. Instead of ישיבה other manuscripts have יישוב. 38. For קנה in connection with the demarcation of a plot of land see also Sifrei Deuteronomy, pis.pis. 315 to Deuteronomy 32:12 (ed. Finkelstein, p. 357). For מלו הקנה "the fall length of the measuring rod" see also Ezekiel 41:8, and cf. Ezekiel 40:8. The words מלא הקנה also occur in Sifrei Zuta to Numbers 19:15 (ed. Horovitz, p. 311), where a weaver is said to bore a hole through a wall to lay down a weaver's rod, evidently lengthwise. 39. On the identification of the verse see the Tosafot, ad 10c„ s.v. Hivi. In most manuscripts, this exegesis is attributed to R. Pappa. 40. Cf. Geoponika: Farm Work: A Modern Translation of the Roman and Byzantine Farming Handbook,Handbook, trans. Andrew Dalby (Devon: Prospect Books, 2011), 80 (attributed to Anatolios): "Others, not satisfied with testing [the soil] by observation, devised a method using other senses. Having dug to a certain depth at the relevant place they extract some soil, and first of all evaluate it by smell. Not yet sat isfied, they put it in a vessel, pour on drinking water and carry out an examination by taste." See also n. 52 below. Discernment of the character of the soil by sight, smell, and taste has its parallel in—and, given the pervasive correlation of womanly and earthly, may even have served as the model for—the specialized rab binic practice of examining vaginal blood not only visually but also by smell (per B. Niddah 20b, on which see Secunda, '"Dashtana,"' 32-44, 118-19; and cf. B. Yevamot 60b) and taste (per Jerome, on which see HillelHillel Newman, "Jerome and the Jews" [PhD diss., Hebrew University, 1997], 41^42). 41. On the distinctive expertise of the surveyor see, e.g., Columella's complaint (On Agricul ture,ture, l.preface.3) that few study or teach agriculture, whereas other subjects, including "the science of surveying and mathematics" (mensurarum et numerorum modum), enjoy robust recognition. 316</page><page sequence="15">"Like an Expert Sharecropper" A likely tannaitic comment on Deuteronomy 19:14—the verse to which R. Hiyya b. Ba's teaching also attaches, in the Bavli—distinguishes between the boundaries that Joshua established, probably the tribal allotments within the land of Canaan, and those that the Canaanites established, probably the boundaries of the land of Canaan itself.42 Against this background, the Yerushalmi's version of the tradition conveyed by R. Hiyya b. Ba can be understood as meaning to clarify that Numbers 34:2 introduces the external boundaries of the land, not its internal divisions.43 On this reconstruction, the sugyot in their present form attest to the secondary transfer of R. Hiyya b. Ba's tradition from the realm of surveying to the planting of vine yards and the science of root nourishment.44 The use of the word בדו in the Yerushalmi's version appears to strike a dis cordant note, for the root מ־״י ordinarily conveys not simply invention but fab rication, or falsehood. It is possible, in immediate terms, that בדו is conditioned by the verse. The exegesis would depend on reading Biblical Hebrew גבול in light of Aramaic and Hebrew גב״ל "to make, form."45 More gen erally, the cultural framework implicit in R. Hiyya b. Ba's use of בדו is probably that of technological innovation, instances of which we have already encountered 42. Midrash Tannaim to Deuteronomy 19:14 (ed. Hoffmann, p. 115). My thanks to Michal Bar Asher Siegal for discussing this passage with me. For what appears to be the same distinction see Y. Pe'ah 2:1 (16d). (The Bavli version of the latter, at B. Bava Batra 56a, is different.) 43. The same verse, Numbers 34:2, is cited by the "children of Africa," descendants of the Canaanites, as proof of their ownership of the land in the trial before Alexander the Great described in B. Sanhedrin 91a and in the scholion for the 25th of Sivan in the Fast Scroll (Vered Noam, Megillat TaTa 'anit: Versions, Interpretations, History, with a Critical Edition [Jerusalem: Yad Ben-Zvi, 2003], 198-205). The Bavli's version seems to me too vague to allow for determination of its original sense, but note that it is arguably in tension with the tannaitic comment that I have cited. 44. The entwinement of surveying and agriculture in the development of these talmudic pas sages is unsurprising, and attested elsewhere. Thus the second-century bce (?) Alexandrian (?) historian (?) Artapanus, immediately after crediting Joseph with dividing up the land of Egypt by means of boundaries, reports that he "made much barren land arable" (John J. Collins, "Artapanus," in The Old Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, ed. James Charlesworth [New York: Doubleday, 1985], 897 [fragment 2]). The Bavli reports (B. Bava Mezi'a 107b) that R. Judah exhorted R. Ada the surveyor: "Do not treat surveying lightly, for every little bit [of land] is fit for saffron." Likewise, Mago, the Carthaginian author of the aforementioned famed agricultural treatise, is credited, perhaps incorrectly, as the source for a passage in the Corpus Agrimensorum Romanorum, an anthology of technical writings on surveying. See Brian Campbell, The Writings of the Roman Land Sun'eyors: Introduction, Text, Translation Translation and Commentary (London: Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies, 2000), 255, 445 n. 13. The occasional expectation that the surveyor take into account the fertility of different areas in dividing plots—"The lands were allocated according to an evaluation of their fertility and the nature of the terrain" (ibid., 171)—represents a practical point of contact between the two praxes. Note that in the exegesis of Genesis 36:20 in the above Bavli passage itself, the areas suitable for the planting of figs and vines are indicated with reference to the surveyors measuring rod (קנה). 45. Both Hebrew and Aramaic גב״ל (per, e.g., Michael Sokoloff, A Dictionary of Jewish Pales tiniantinian Aramaic of the Byzantine Period, 2nd ed. [Ramat-Gan, Bar-llan University Press, 2002], 119 [s. v. 829 ,[גבל) and rabbinic Hebrew בד״י (per Lieberman, Tosefta Ki-fshutah, 4.485) belong to the semantic field of kneading (sourdough, mortar). 317</page><page sequence="16">TzviTzvi Novick in connection with the quincunx and with the validation of experimentation in Varro and Columella.46 The expertise that R. Samuel b. Nahmani's statement attributes to the Horites —the ability to discern which soil is suitable for which crop—is of foundational importance in Greco-Roman agricultural writing. According to Xenophon's Isoma chus (16.1), "the nature of the soil," that is, "what the soil is capable of growing," is what authors on agriculture call "the most complicated problem in agriculture," and the "first" thing a farmer must know. In the definition of agricultural science prof fered by Varro's Scrofa, reproduced at the very beginning of this article, the deter mination of the crop suitable for each soil likewise has pride of place.47 It is tempting to see in the attribution of agricultural expertise to Canaanites an echo of the esteem for Carthaginian agricultural science in Roman literature. We have already made reference to the Carthaginian Mago's monumental treatise on the subject, deemed of such great importance that the Roman Senate sponsored its translation into Latin. The offhand way in which Varro's Antonius refers to it in the remark quoted above suggests that the name "Mago of Carthage'' had achieved a cultural resonance beyond the province of technical writers on agriculture 48 The fact that Columella not only makes use of Mago's treatise, but also cites a maxim about farm size in the name of "the Carthaginians, a very shrewd people" (1.3.9), is further evidence of the association of the Carthaginians with agricultural exper tise. Rabbinic sources manifest a very explicit awareness of the connection between the ancient Canaanites and contemporary Phoenician colonies in North Africa, including Carthage 49 Their construction of the Canaanites of old as expert farmers may build on this connection. But it is more likely that the statements in the Yerushalmi and the Bavli simply develop the intuitive link between autochthony and agriculture. The Pen tateuch itself, in a passage (Deuteronomy 6:11) on which various rabbinic 46. For the delineation of boundaries as a form of technological innovation cf. Artapanus's characterization of Joseph as "the first to divide the land [of Egypt] and distinguish it with boundaries" (Collins, "Artapanus," 897). Artapanus indicates in the same context that Joseph "discovered measure ments," one of the foundations of the surveyor's science, per Columella's remark in n. 41 above. On Joseph and the other Jewish figures in Artapanus as Kulturbringer see Gregory E. Sterling, Historio graphygraphy and Self-Definition: Josephos, Luke-Acts and Apologetic Historiography (Leiden: Brill, 1992), 175-76. 175-76. 47. The cultural significance of crop location is conveyed by the Yerushalmi's story (Y. Ta'anit 3:8 [66d]) about Honi, who falls into a deep sleep just prior to the destruction of the first temple, and awakes seventy years later, after the return from exile, to find "a changed world (עלמא מחלף): a place that was a vineyard was now an olive grove, and a place that was an olive grove was now a grain field." (Amos 9:14 implies that after the return from the exile, vineyards will not be rebuilt in the same locations, but built anew in different ones.) The story presumes that it is the link between crop and location that orients human beings in the world, and indeed, that determines the identity of the world across time. 48.

The close connection between superstition or magic and agriculture in the rabbinic worldview emerges from, inter alia, the fact that the paradigmatic instance of witchcraft for the Mishnah (M. Sanhedrin 7:11) is the magical harvesting of cucumbers.53 Most strikingly, for our purposes, Canaanite agriculture and "the ways of the Amorites" occur, respectively, in the Akivan and Ishmaelian comments on the biblical prohibition (Leviticus 18:3) against "walking in the laws" of the Egyptians and the Canaanites. The Akivan comment excepts building and planting from this prohibition, while the Ishmaelian comment finds in the verse the source of the ban on "the ways of the Amorites."54 The sources that we have analyzed replicate the distinction that emerges from a comparison between the two schools' approaches by upholding Canaanite agricul tural expertise as authoritative, despite the fact that the same Canaanites are recog nized elsewhere as experts in another, not unrelated area of illicit superstition. Conclusion In rabbinic circles in Palestine, some rabbis were considered more knowl edgeable than others in certain agricultural laws. On one occasion, a rabbi 50. In the story of the trial before Alexander the Great, on the version in b. Sanhedrin 91 a and in the Parma MS of the scholion (Noam, Megillat Ta 'unit, 198-205), the "children of Africa" are said, oddly, to leave behind cultivated fields for the Jews when they flee, even though their home, in the present of the story, is not Israel, but North Africa. This motif likely depends on Deuteronomy 6:11. 51. The use of the first person in the voice of the anonymous Mishnah, especially in a purely halakhic context, is striking. The only other anonymous instances of אבותינו in the Mishnah occur in M. Ta'anit 4:6, M. 'Avot 5:4-5, and M. 'Arakhin 3:5, all more or less "aggadic" contexts. For two other inquiries concerning the halakhic status of crops grown by the Canaanites and seized by the Israe lites seeY. Hallah2:l (58b). 52. Expertise in discernment of soil is attributed in another Palestinian source (Y. Ta'anit 2:1 [65b]) to "the elders of Sepphoris, who, when the first rain fell, smelled the soil, and could say what the rains of the year would be." 53. See also B. Sanhedrin 68a and especially Avot de-Rabbi Natan, A:25 (ed. Schechter, p. 41a). On this magical practice see Gideon Bohak, Ancient Jewish Magic: A History (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008), 360. The link between magic and agriculture is also reflected in, e.g., T. Shabbat 7:15 = T. Shevi'it 1:10; Y. Shevi'it 2:7 (34a); Y. Ma'aser Sheni 5:13 (56d); Y. Sanhedrin 7:1 (25d); and cf. the practice of "chanting out crops" (fruges excantare), which the Twelve Tables pro scribe, and to which Virgil refers at the end of his eighth Eclogue. On "the ways of the Amorites" see Bohak, Magic, 382-85 and Beth A.

Giali), but there is no evidence for a general practice of the sort. Rabbinic sources do betray an awareness of technical agricultural facts as a distinct body of knowledge that bears on Halakhah. This body of knowledge is marked out by a formula, "how does one know/determine." It is constructed as the province of the "expert share cropper," and of the ancient Canaanites. But the existence of such a body of knowledge does not appear to be a source of overt anxiety to rabbis of tannaitic and amoraic Palestine. They do not overtly recognize it as a problem for rabbinic authority, nor do they, in evident ways, construct agricultural Halakhah so as to make it less dependent on technical agricultural facts, or in other words, more nominalist.
