<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FACTICITY OF MEDIEVAL NARRATIVE: A CASE STUDY OF THE HEBREW FIRST CRUSADE NARRATIVES by ROBERT CHAZAN In the early stages of the modern rewriting of medieval Jewish history, the sources most consulted and adduced were narrative. As the enterprise has matured, further source genres have been discovered and utilized, thus allowing for improved understanding of the medieval Jewish experience. Of late, the reliability of narrative sources has come under question, but at the same time these narrative sources have been utilized in new and creative ways. To be sure, both the questioning and the innovative utilization of medieval Jewish narrative sources have been profoundly influenced by similar tendencies among general medievalists, as they seek to refine their tools of historical reconstruction.' 1. Considerations of medieval historical narrative by medievalists include: J. de Ghellinck, L'Essor de la litterature latine au XIIe sidcle, 2 vols. (Brussels, 1946), 2:89-198; M.-D.

I propose to conduct this investigation by focusing on a set of narrative sources-the two original Hebrew First Crusade narratives-that seem rich in historical detail, and, at the same time, offer considerable insight into the impact of literary formats and preexistent imagery as well as authorial goals and purposes. The focus of this analysis will be the question of facticity. Can these rich narratives be responsibly utilized for reconstructing aspects of the events which they purport to describe? The Hebrew First Crusade narratives have attracted much attention ever since their publication at the end of the nineteenth century. Both the striking content of these narratives and the vigor of their style have captured the interest of historians, and they have, as a result, been subjected to considera- ble scrutiny. Much of this scrutiny has focused on technical questions flow- ing from the overlap of segments of the three extant narratives. There have been recurrent efforts to clarify the relationship among the three composi- tions.2 Larger questions of the style and historicity of these accounts have been generally neglected in favor of a sense that they can be fully trusted with respect to the data which they provide.3 Only of late has the fundamen- tal question of the historical accuracy of these narratives been addressed. The first to raise this issue was Ivan G. Marcus in his 1982 Prooftexts article, "From Politics to Martyrdom: Shifting Paradigms in the Hebrew in Renaissance and Renewal in the Twelfth Century, ed. Robert L. Benson and Giles Constable (Cambridge, Mass., 1982), pp. 387-417; the essays collected in Ernst Breisack, ed., Classical Rhetoric and Medieval Historiography (Kalamazoo, 1985); and the essays collected in Speculum 65 (1990): 1-108. Note the valuable bibliography compiled by Roger Ray, "Medieval Historio- graphy through the Twelfth Century: Problems and Progress of Research," Viator 5 (1974): 33-59. 2. Note the important article by Anna Sapir Abulafia, "The Interrelationship between the Hebrew Chronicles of the First Crusade," Journal of Semitic Studies 27 (1982): 221-239, and my own discussion of these issues in chap. 2 of my European Jewry and the First Crusade (Berkeley, 1987). In view of my conclusion that the narrative of Eliezer bar Nathan is deriva- tive, I shall focus in this study, as I did in the book, on the truncated narrative and the narrative attributed to Solomon ben Samson. I shall continue to utilize the designations which I used in the book for these two narratives-S for the shorter narrative and L for the lengthier. 3. Among those who have utilized these texts, particularly noteworthy are the insights offered by Jacob Katz, Exclusiveness and Tolerance (Oxford, 1961), pp. 82-92, and Alan Mintz, Hurban: Responses to Catastrophe in Hebrew Literature (New York, 1984), pp. 84-101.</page><page sequence="3">FACTICITY OF HEBREW FIRST CRUSADE NARRATIVES 33 Narratives of the 1096 Crusade Riots."4 This essay is noteworthy on two scores: first for the specific insights that it offers and, more importantly, for raising the critical questions of the stylization and tendentiousness of these important Hebrew narratives and thus the trustworthiness of the valuable data which they provide. Marcus begins his study with some general obser- vations on medieval narrative sources and moves beyond the general observations to advance a specific analysis of the Hebrew First Crusade accounts. Both the general observations and the specific analysis are inter- esting and important. Marcus opens his general observations by noting the prior lack of "a literary reading in which the complete narratives are considered as products of coherent religious imaginations." He moves immediately to explain this lacuna. The stance enunciated by Marcus is crucial and should be cited in some detail. The classification of the texts as medieval chronicles is one reason for this failure. That term usually denotes texts which contain documentary historical data which are embedded in a theological narrative framework.5 But the notion that medieval chronicles consist of an almost mechanical combination of "facts" and a "religious narrative framework" is a distortion: Such texts cannot be treated as though the "facts" are preserved in narrative like fossils in amber. Most medieval narrators were not interested in what happened for its own sake. Instead, a monk or a royal biographer or a hagiographer usually made use of what he considered to be facts-especially miracles-in order to demonstrate the wonders of God or of His royal or ecclesiastical servant. What appear to be facts in a medieval chronological narrative, then, should be considered a highly edited version of the "deeds" (gesta) which the narrator learned from traditional accounts, hearsay or eye-witness reports. The events actually reported qualify for inclusion only when they fit the narrator's pre- 4. Ivan G. Marcus, "From Politics to Martyrdom: Shifting Paradigms in the Hebrew Nar- ratives of the 1096 Crusade Riots," Prooftexts 2 (1982): 40-52. 5. There is some problem with Marcus's use of the term "chronicle" and my use of the same term as well. The broad medieval distinction between "chronicle" and "history" generally involved length of presentation and embellishment, with the term "chronicle" used for brief and unadorned presentation, and "history" denoting lengthier and fuller presentation. This distinction is emphasized in a number of the essays in the Breisach collection cited in note 1. In view of this terminological issue, I have ceased utilizing the designation "chronicle" and adopted the more neutral term "narrative."</page><page sequence="4">34 ROBERT CHAZAN conceived religious-literary schema. Medieval chronicles are, in this sense, fictions: imaginative reorderings of experience within a cultural framework and system of symbols.6 This is an important and provocative position, one that deserves serious consideration and reflection. There are two issues which Marcus raises, one having to do with the raw materials which underlie medieval narratives and the other with the editing of these raw materials. The first is somewhat puz- zling. Marcus suggests that "what appear to be facts in a medieval chronolo- gical narrative, then, should be considered a highly edited version of the 'deeds' (gesta) which the narrator learned from traditional accounts, hear- say or eye-witness reports." It is not clear to me what the difference is between Marcus's "facts" and his "deeds," although the word "facts" does have a reductionist and negative ring to it.' In any case, what medieval nar- rators depict is, by and large, a set of events. Whether one chooses to call these events "facts" or "deeds," they are the raw materials upon which the medieval narratives are based. Marcus's observations with respect to the editing process are clear. He argues for a high level of imaginative interven- tion. Marcus begins with these general observations and then proceeds to propose a specific "preconceived religious-literary schema" that explains many key features of the Hebrew First Crusade chronicles. Let us note Marcus's conclusion with respect to these chronicles: The Solomon ben Samson narrative, to which I shall give the most attention, consists of a highly articulated five-part structure: two different kinds of nar- rative are framed by three liturgical interpretations of the narratives. Each community's experience is structured, in effect, as a drama in which a liturgical prologue introduces the first act which then narrates the political events which took place when a particular community confronted the Crusader threat; a liturgical entr'acte separates the political narrative in Act One from the list of martyrologies in Act Two. Finally, a liturgical epilogue concludes the action by addressing the ultimate meaning of the acts of martyrdom.8 6. Marcus, "From Politics to Martyrdom," p. 42. 7. For fuller discussion of the range of realities that may be reconstructed from medieval narrative, see below. 8. Marcus, "From Politics to Martyrdom," p. 42.</page><page sequence="5">FACTICITY OF HEBREW FIRST CRUSADE NARRATIVES 35 If I have understood properly the Marcus contention, this five-part struc- ture constitutes "the narrator's preconceived religious-literary schema," that preconceived ordering through which the information at the disposal of the author/editor is sifted. Thus, Marcus's general claims with respect to medieval narrative find expression in an elaborate structure which he finds embodied in-or perhaps at the root of-the Hebrew First Crusade nar- ratives. What is not altogether clear in the Marcus study is his own understand- ing of the implications of the "preconceived religious-literary schema" for the historicity of the data provided in these narratives. While, on the one hand, his general observations conclude with the suggestion that "medieval chronicles are, in this sense, fictions: imaginative reorderings of experience within a cultural framework and system of symbols," his close investigation of the chronicle of Solomon ben Samson leads him to a more positive view. He suggests that the schema reflects the essentially tendentious goal of the Hebrew narratives, the desire to justify beyond any possible doubt the extreme behavior of the martyrs of 1096. In view of this desire to justify, Marcus makes the following acute observation with respect to the literary genre adopted by the narrators: The narrator's' effort to legitimate the innovative acts of martyrdom is also reflected in his use of genre, but here two different considerations undercut one another. On the one hand, the narrator adopted a quasi-liturgical mode, perhaps with the hope of perpetuating the account in the permanent liturgy of the community, the German-Jewish rite. On the other hand, the narrator's need to justify the martyrs by bearing witness to their actual deeds led him to record the facts as he knew them in the form of a sequential narrative. But the descriptive detail essential to the prose medium made the liturgical parts un- assimilable into the liturgy, which is almost always cast in the most general language of "Israel" and "God," not particulars, such as the "Jews of Mainz" and the "Christians of France and Germany."'0 What this would seem to suggest is that the literary schema does not, in the end, distort the information provided by the narratives, that the narrator, in 9. Marcus, it will be recalled, focused on the Solomon ben Samson narrative. 10. Marcus, "From Politics to Martyrdom," p. 43.</page><page sequence="6">36 ROBERT CHAZAN order to achieve his ends, recorded "the facts as he knew them in the form of a sequential narrative." When I undertook my own analysis of the events of 1096, I was of course aware of the work of Marcus and concerned with the issues which he had raised."I This concern is reflected in both the second and fifth chapters of my European Jewry and the First Crusade. The second chapter of this book is devoted to a discussion of the sources and their reliability. In this discussion I made three claims with respect to the Hebrew First Crusade narratives. These claims related to the original sources upon which the later narratives seem to be based, the transmission of these source materials to the authors/ editors of the narratives, and the measure of distortion imposed upon these materials by the authors/editors. In discussing the sources for the narra- tives, I noted that they seem to stem from eyewitness testimony to the events themselves, although that is surely no foolproof guarantee for historicity. More important, I noted their commitment to detail and diversity. "Rather than portraying a stereotyped and repetitive set of behaviors both Christian and Jewish, they focus on a variety of actions and reactions. The uniqueness of specific circumstances, groups, and individuals is highlighted.""2 With respect to the transmission of this original material to the later authors/ editors, I noted simply that the time span between the events and the com- position of the narratives was short enough to allow for easy access to earlier written materials and for direct oral transmission of some of the eye- witness accounts. There are no special problems associated with the trans- mission of immediate data to the somewhat later writers. Finally, as regards the distortions imposed by the later narrators, I suggested the following: The two original Hebrew chronicles are clearly tendentious in nature. They were written in the wake of catastrophe in order to address pressing theologi- 11. In European Jewry and the First Crusade, I addressed the Marcus article on p. 308, n. 21, disagreeing with Marcus's contention of a five-part schema which controlled the Hebrew First Crusade narratives and arguing, both in that note and on pp. 44-47, for the reliability of the data provided in the Hebrew narratives. Jeremy Cohen, in his review of European Jewry and the First Crusade, basing himself on the more skeptical general formulation of the Marcus article, expressed regret over my failure to address more fully the Marcus view; see the American Historical Review 93 (1988): 1031-1032. In part, the present study was occasioned by a desire on my part to respond to Cohen's request for a fuller analysis of the issues raised by the Marcus article. 12. Chazan, European Jewry and the First Crusade, p. 44.</page><page sequence="7">FACTICITY OF HEBREW FIRST CRUSADE NARRATIVES 37 cal and spiritual issues and to allay gnawing doubts. They are meant to re- assure the Jewish reader and, at the same time, to present Jewish supplications to the Deity. These are clearly interpretive efforts, focusing heavily on the valor of the Jewish martyrs as both a consolation for the human audience and a foundation for the prayers directed at a divine auditor. Given such a focus, the chronicles could understandably have become highly distorted. However, in fashioning these texts of consolation and supplication, the narrators of S and L seem to have retained a strong sense of the specific, the unique, and the diverse that is the hallmark of their sources.'3 The second section of the fifth chapter of European Jewry and the First Crusade is devoted to a more detailed look at the motivations that occa- sioned the Hebrew narratives. In that discussion, I continued to examine the possibility of serious distortion and concluded, once again, that, while the narratives were surely written to promote identifiable purposes, the authors/editors chose to remain rather faithful to their sources (and by extension to the realities) rather than to efface the reality in favor of some preexistent interpretative scheme. In a review of European Jewry and the First Crusade, Ivan G. Marcus returned once more to the issue of the historicity of the Hebrew First Crusade narratives. At this point, the ambiguity of the discussion in his Prooftexts article was replaced with a more strongly skeptical stance. Mar- cus, in this review, took a sharper stand, arguing that the texts do not in fact offer modern researchers the requisite reliable data for historiographic analysis. Marcus raised a number of issues related to the facticity of the Hebrew texts. The first involves an understanding of-or more precisely my alleged failure to understand-the nature of the Hebrew sources. Chazan's study also obscures the genre of these texts. Often called local Jewish chronicles or hagiographies, these texts are not documentary records to which theological comments or poems have been added. They are highly edited, rhetorically colored, and liturgically motivated literary reworkings of circular letters and oral reports, written for definite purposes.'4 13. Ibid., pp. 45-46. 14. The Marcus review can be found in Speculum 64 (1989): 685-688; this citation can be found on p. 686.</page><page sequence="8">38 ROBERT CHAZAN This leads Marcus to the central issue. The entire text is an interpretive whole in which some details have been in- cluded or heightened, others omitted or deemphasized, as is characteristic of many genres of medieval Latin historiography. Although general corrobora- tion exists in the contemporary Latin and later Hebrew sources that riots occurred and that some Jews killed their families and themselves, it is lacking for most of the very detail that is characteristic of the narratives. Variety of details in the sources (pp. 4, 44-48, 309) does not prove that the detail is in the events themselves and not in the narrators' minds. Chazan's argument is cir- cular, and his insistence on looking for detailed "facts" in these sources is futile.I5 This criticism surely echoes the general observations of the earlier Marcus article, although it suppresses Marcus's own observations on the tendency of these narrators to include, for their own purposes, detailed information available to them from more immediate sources. The end-result of the Marcus criticism is to leave us in a position of knowing almost nothing re- liable of the events of 1096; all that we know is the mindset of later Jewish commentators on these bloody events (how bloody they were would not be all that clear). This sketch of prior work on the Hebrew First Crusade narratives sets the stage for a fresh look at the facticity of an important set of medieval nar- ratives. The most reasonable starting point for this investigation is a look at the specific schema proposed in the Marcus Prooftexts article. It will be recalled that Marcus proposed a five-part organizational structure which constitutes, in his eyes, the prism through which the events of 1096 were viewed by the Jewish authors/editors. To identify the structural grounding of a text-medieval or otherwise-is a considerable achievement and would be most helpful in uncovering the biases and distortions of the given text. At the same time, such claims of a discernible organizational structure must be assessed with considerable care, and the applicability of the proposed 15. Ibid., p. 687. I might suggest, with tongue mildly in cheek, that Marcus himself may be guilty of imposing a "preconceived schema" in his review of my book. In his 1982 article, he decried the tendency to read the Hebrew First Crusade narratives as "an almost mechanical combination of 'facts' and a 'religious narrative framework.' " Despite my extensive treatment of these Hebrew narratives in chaps. 2 and 5 of European Jewry and the First Crusade, Marcus leveled precisely the same criticisms in his review, in almost the same language. This perhaps suggests his own "preconceived schema," although-to be fair to Marcus-it may well be that he simply found my treatment of the issues which he raised unsatisfying.</page><page sequence="9">FACTICITY OF HEBREW FIRST CRUSADE NARRATIVES 39 schema must be tested throughout the entire text. Is the five-part scheme adumbrated by Marcus in fact omnipresent throughout the narrative; is it indeed, as he claims, the structure utilized for depicting "each community's experience"?'6 A close look at the details offered by Marcus shows that the evidence which he adduces for his five-part schema flows entirely from the Mainz episode as depicted in the Solomon ben Samson narrative. The examples used for highlighting all five phases of the purportedly encompassing schematics are drawn in their entirety from that chronicle's portrayal of the major assault on Mainz Jewry.1" This leads us to ask simply and directly: Do the stories of communities other than Mainz exhibit the same five-part organization? The lengthy Hebrew chronicle attributed to Solomon ben Samson provides us with evidence from a total of eighteen identifiable assaults on Jewish communities in 1096; these include attacks on the Jewries of Speyer,'8 Worms (2),19 Mainz (2),2o Cologne,21 the seven towns in which 16. In his statement noted earlier, Marcus speaks of "each community's experience" as structured in a five-part sequence. Shortly thereafter (still p. 42), he speaks of the construction of "each community account in a highly stylized way." 17. In fact there are some serious problems in the organization of the Mainz episode in the chronicle of Solomon ben Samson. Marcus's schema is actually even better illustrated in the more tightly organized account of the events in Mainz found in the anonymous truncated nar- rative which Marcus designates A and which I designate S. 18. I shall refer readers to two Hebrew versions of the Solomon narrative-those found in Adolf Neubauer and Moritz Stern, eds., Hebrdische Berichte iiber die Judenverfolgungen wihrend die Kreuzzige (Berlin, 1892), pp. 1-30, and Abraham Habermann, ed., Sefer Gezerot Ashkenaz ve-Zarfat (Jerusalem, 1945), pp. 24-60-and two available English translations- Shlomo Eidelberg, The Jews and the Crusaders (Madison, 1977), pp. 21-72, and Chazan, European Jewry and the First Crusade, pp. 243-297. The Speyer episode can be found in Neu- bauer and Stern, p. 2; Habermann, p. 25; Eidelberg, p. 22; Chazan, p. 244. This episode is depicted far more fully in the truncated anonymous chronicle, which I designate S and Marcus designates A. 19. According to the Solomon narrative, the first assault on Worms Jewry took place on the twenty-third of Iyyar (May 18, 1096), with the second assault coming a week later. Again the shorter narrative provides fuller information. On the two Worms episodes, see Neubauer and Stern, p. 2; Habermann, pp. 25-26; Eidelberg, p. 23; Chazan, p. 245. 20. The first Mainz assault came on the third of Sivan (May 27, 1096); the second involved the band of Mainz Jews led by the parnas Kalonymous, which was removed from Mainz by the order of the archbishop, and was eventually abandoned by the same archbishop and destroyed.

Rather than serving as the prism through which all data are filtered, Marcus's five-part sequence turns out to be unique to one episode only. Not only is the five-part sequence not in evidence beyond the first Mainz episode, even the claimed ubiquity of political negotiation as one of the two central elements in Jewish 1096 behavior turns out to be chimerical. While Marcus proposes that political negotiations formed act one of a two-act drama in terms of which the narrator envisioned the events of 1096, political negotiations in fact appear only infrequently. Out of the eighteen episodes depicted in the Hebrew record, only in five is there political negotiation of any kind portrayed in the narrative. In the remaining thirteen instances, there is no mention whatsoever of political negotiations. Even in those five cases where political negotiations are depicted, they fail to adhere to a common pattern, or more precisely they fail to conform to the Mainz pat- tern, which Marcus has proposed as the key mode in which the experience of each community was envisioned. While prior to the first assault in Mainz negotiations with the archbishop of Mainz and the local burgrave were initiated by the leaders of the Jewish community (as Marcus correctly notes), in the second assault on Mainz Jews it was the archbishop of Mainz who initiated communication with the remnants of Mainz Jewry led by the parnas Kalonymous; in the assault on the Cologne Jews sequestered in Moers the negotiations were carried on by the local municipal ruler first with the crusaders and then with the Jews; in the first assault on the Jews of Trier the negotiations involved the Jews and Peter the Hermit; and in the 22.

The first incident in Trier involved Peter the Hermit and his band and took place on the first day of Passover (April 10, 1096); the second took place in early June.

Thus the paradigm of negotiation extracted from the Mainz episode by Marcus in no way reflects a preexistent scheme imposed on the data. Even in the few cases where negotiations are noted, they fail completely to conform to the Mainz pattern. The conclusion forced upon us by the data is that the framework pro- posed by Marcus is in point of fact not evident in the narrative of Solomon ben Samson. To the contrary, close inspection of the eighteen episodes depicted in the Solomon narrative suggests precisely the opposite of Marcus's conclusion. Rather than reflecting a rigidly circumscribed frame- work within which the narrator prejudges his data, the Solomon narrative exhibits considerable flexibility in the way in which it organizes the episodes which it recounts. Heterogeneity of organizational structure is the style of the author/editor. There do not seem to be any organizational a priori assumptions on the basis of which the tales are told. Political negotiation as the first of two recurrent acts in the drama is in fact not observable in the narrative, and in those cases where reports of such negotiation surface, they adhere to no identifiable preconceived pattern.27 While Marcus's proposal of a five-part framework through which the narrator envisages the events of 1096 and by means of which he opts for inclusion or exclusion of the details available to him is negated by the evidence provided by the narrative itself, the broader issue of the facticity of the Hebrew First Crusade narratives remains to be addressed. Both Marcus and I agree that the Hebrew First Crusade narratives are highly tendentious, addressing a variety of issues ranging from political advice through halakhic justification of the martyrs and on to theological rationalization for the catastrophe. We both agree that the presentation of Christian and Jewish behaviors in the Hebrew First Crusade narratives is highly stylized both in language and in imagery. Yet, despite my broad agreement with many aspects of Marcus's analysis, I find myself at odds with a number of his conclusions. Let us begin with the key sentence in the general formulation 27. In a general way, Marcus has been more reductionist than the sources which he accuses of the same fault. While he identifies two patterns of Jewish reaction to the crusading threat- political negotiations and martyrdom-the Hebrew narratives present us with a more diverse range of Jewish behaviors, including flight, refuge with Christian neighbors, battle, conversion, and a variety of martyrological behaviors that call out for the drawing of important distinc- tions.</page><page sequence="12">42 ROBERT CHAZAN presented in his Prooftexts article: "Medieval chronicles are, in this sense, fictions: imaginative reorderings of experience within a cultural framework and system of symbols." My problem is a simple one: Why limit this desig- nation to medieval chronicles? Are not many works of modern historical writing similarly "imaginative reorderings of experience within a cultural framework and system of symbols"? In fact, are not all works of ancient, medieval, and modern historical writing "imaginative reorderings of experi- ence within a cultural framework and system of symbols"?28 The question that must be posed is: While most historical narratives, perhaps excepting those recently written from the modernist "scientific" perspective, tend to be highly stylized and tendentious,29 what is it that dis- tinguishes medieval narratives and makes them unusually problematic? Or indeed is there something special about medieval narratives that sets them apart and make them particularly problematic? If there is no such special characteristic, then the techniques developed for other periods for filtering out tendentious distortion and rhetorical stylization should work quite well for medieval narratives (or should work at least as well as they work for other periods). If there is some special problematic, then we must find it. Here I believe that the recent studies on medieval historical narrative come to our assistance. The key characteristic of medieval narrative noted in many of these studies is the tendency toward the imposition of stereotypic motifs from an earlier Christian (and Jewish) legacy. The forms that these stereotypic motifs take vary widely, but the commonality involves the imposition on contemporary affairs of paradigms from a differing setting. Where such a preexistent model operates in a consistent manner, we are of course justified in maintaining a posture of skepticism toward the data presented. Such data are much more a reflection of the preexistent model than of the reality under consideration.30 28. Inter alia,the narratives of Herodotus, Thucydides, and Josephus from antiquity and the recent histories of eyewitnesses like William L. Shirer, George F. Kennan, and Abba Eban would all seem to represent nicely "imaginative reorderings of experience within a cultural framework and system of symbols." 29. There has surely been an effort on the part of recent historians to be less tendentious, although the level of success in that effort is debatable. However, it has regularly been noted that stylization has hardly disappeared-the complex academic trappings of acknowledgments, disclaimers, notes, and bibliography hardly constitute a flight from stylization. 30. Note, e.g., the essays in the Breisach collection that attempt to identify the ubiquitous influence of classical rhetorical patterns on major medieval historical narratives. Yosef Hayim</page><page sequence="13">FACTICITY OF HEBREW FIRST CRUSADE NARRATIVES 43 To be sure, even here a word of caution is in order. In some instances, the scheme dominates the data; in other cases, however, the scheme is actualized in the mind of the observer by the data. In these latter cases, it is the data that stimulate the imposition of the explanatory stereotype. In his valuable discussion of "The Problematic Emergence of History Writing as a Separate Genre," Albert Cook, speaking of the admixtures of historical fact with elements of myth and legend that characterize both Homer and Hero- dotus, says the following: Usually the modern concern for a purified professional historiography will overlook the historiographic element in such admixtures, classifying them oversimply as fiction, when actually they may be performing the historio- graphic task of organizing data around a central question much more prob- ingly than many an additive chronicler will have done.3' Let us flesh this point out with a specific example. If Marcus's contention of a two-part drama that begins with political negotiation and concludes with martyrdom had in fact been borne out, would this necessarily mean that such a sequence was a product of the narrator's imagination? Would it not be possible that the author was profoundly impressed with the reality of a striking sequence that forced itself upon his consciousness?32 This is not to Yerushalmi, in his important Zakhor: Jewish History and Jewish Memory (Seattle, 1982), p. 36, identifies "assimilation of events to old and established conceptual frameworks" as a major characteristic-and weakness-of medieval Jewish historical writing. Marcus likewise makes some valuable observations in this regard when he describes the tension between the demands of the quasi-liturgical. format and the sequential narrative format. There he speaks of the liturgy as "almost always cast in the most general language of 'Israel' and 'God,' not particu- lars, such as the 'Jews of Mainz' and the 'Christians of France and Germany.' " To the extent that patterns of prior thinking are omnipresent, skepticism as to empirical observation is war- ranted. For a broad discussion of the impact of paradigms on medieval Jewish perceptions and the possibility of moving beyond such paradigms, see my "Representation of Events in the Middle Ages," History and Theory, Beiheft 27, pp. 40-65. 31. Albert Cook, History/Writing (Cambridge, 1988), p. 15. 32. In fact, Marcus himself suggests that the paradigm that he found in the Solomon ben Samson narrative was the result of empirical observation: "By constructing each community account in this highly stylized way, the narrator affirms that a fundamental shift took place in the world-view of the Jews he is describing: a shift from politics to martyrdom. The narrator's plan is to justify the martyrs' behavior by describing how they resorted to killing only after exhausting all conventional religious and political alternatives." Thus Marcus himself seems to suggest that the purported preconceived scheme which he identifies was actually the result of the behaviors observed in 1096. This hardly makes it a preconceived scheme.</page><page sequence="14">44 ROBERT CHAZAN gainsay the problems associated with the imposition of prior stereotypes. I fully acknowledge such problems. I am only suggesting once more that the issues associated with the assessment of the reliability of data are extremely complex. In treating medieval narratives, how might we best evaluate the extent to which preexistent stereotypes have been imposed and thereby arrive at a considered assessment of the reliability of the data provided by such nar- ratives. In my study of the First Crusade, I proposed two criteria for such evaluation. The first involves the identification of preexistent models. Where such models are readily identifiable, we are justified in extreme skepticism. A simple case in point: In a valuable and interesting eleventh-century Hebrew depiction of early persecution of northern-French Jewry, the author portrays the onset of persecution in the following fashion: The gentiles murmured and plotted, intending to wipe out, to kill, and to destroy all the Jews in the land. The king and queen then took counsel with his officers and barons within the boundaries of the kingdom. They said to him: "There is one people spread throughout all the provinces, which does not obey us. Its laws and teachings are different from those of all peoples. Now let us go and obliterate them, so that the name of Israel be no longer remembered; for they are a snare before us. Let us announce throughout all your land that whoever does not accede to us and does not heed our words will die." The king and his officers were in complete accord on this plan.33 It takes little ingenuity to perceive that we have here wholesale imposition of motifs from the biblical book of Esther. In light of this wholesale imposition we are thoroughly justified in skepticism with respect to the data presented in this part of the Hebrew account.34 With respect to the Hebrew First Cru- sade chronicles, however, the lack of identifiable stereotypes for the 33. This valuable early northern-European narrative was first published in Orar Tov (Berlin, 1878), pp. 46-48; it was reprinted in Habermann, Sefer Gezerot Ashkenaz ve-Zarfat, pp. 19-21. 34. Again note the complexity of these issues. I suggested in an earlier study ("1007-1012: Initial Crisis for Northern-European Jewry," Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research 38-39 [1970-71]: 101-117) that, in view of the corroborative data, we are justified in seeing this persecution as an instance of governmentally inspired violence. In other words, the imposition of the Esther motifs was stimulated by some of the real attributes of this particular instance of persecution.</page><page sequence="15">FACTICITY OF HEBREW FIRST CRUSADE NARRATIVES 45 behavior and thinking of the Jewish martyrs suggests that the narratives are grounded in direct observation rather than in preexistent models. Both Marcus and I agree that one of the major objectives of the Hebrew First Crusade chronicles was thejustification of behaviors that were most unusual and innovative. Under such circumstances, there were no readily available stereotypes to be imposed on the events of 1096. This suggests, then, a minimum of distortion from preexistent models and a maximum of direct observation and reporting.35 In assessing the presence or absence of distorting preexistent models there is a second-and yet more important-gauge that can be utilized, and that is the level of homogeneity versus heterogeneity in the reporting. Just as in everyday life experience we are justifiably skeptical of reports that are overly monolithic, so too in our reading of medieval narrative materials it is important to assess the level of homogeneity versus heterogeneity. Where the narrative presents one pattern only, skepticism is warranted; where diverse patterns are depicted, the likelihood of wholesale distortion through the imposition of prior stereotypes is minimized. This was the point of my emphasis on the diversity reflected in the narrative depictions of a variety of Christian behaviors and a corresponding variety of Jewish behaviors. Examination in this essay of Marcus's claim of a fixed organizational pat- tern for the First Crusade narratives and revelation of the diversity in narra- tive organization add yet another dimension to the case. If there is in fact no fixed organizational pattern, then the likelihood of a preexistent frame- work into which current data are absorbed is minimized. Diversity of detail does not in and of itself prove verisimilitude; it does however suggest the absence of preexistent and distorting stereotypes.36 From both points of view, then, the Hebrew First Crusade chronicles, upon close examination, seem to show a relatively high level of facticity: No 35. Not surprisingly, fresh depictions of the kind observable in the Hebrew First Crusade narratives could, with the passage of time, be subsumed into the more traditional paradigms. In European Jewry and the First Crusade, pp. 143-148, I noted the tendency of subsequent Ash- kenazic authors to efface the unusual patterns of 1096 behavior and to subsume both Christian and Jewish behaviors into preexistent paradigms of oppression and required response. 36. Recall Marcus's note, cited earlier: "Variety of details in the sources ... does not prove that the detail is in the events themselves and not in the narrators minds." To be sure, variety of detail does not prove facticity; it does, however, suggest the lack of a controlling framework and hence much enhances the likelihood of facticity.</page><page sequence="16">46 ROBERT CHAZAN obvious prior imagery can be identified that suggests a preexistent prism through which the events are viewed, and the diversity so readily observable in the organization of the narrative, in the portrayal of Christian behaviors, and-most strikingly-in the depiction of the Jews of 1096 suggests that the authors/editors of the extant narratives were deeply immersed in the reali- ties of the experiences which they set out to narrate. This is not to suggest by any means that we must slavishly accept what they tell us. I suggested recur- rently in my study of these events that we must exercise great care in our use of the sources and be constantly on guard against distortion. To cite but one instance. I would be reluctant to accept the numerical ratio of martyrs to converts proposed in the narratives. Since the purposes of the narrators involved a highlighting of the martyrs, exaggeration of the number of martyrs and diminution of the number of converts would surely be likely. What is so striking, however, is the refusal on the part of these narrators to gloss over the reality of conversion. This suggests a commitment to register- ing the complex realities of a turbulent period. This last observation leads to the issue of identification of what may and what may not be properly gleaned from the Hebrew First Crusade narra- tives. We have noted recurrently Marcus's objection to eliciting "facts" from narrative materials. It is important, at this juncture, to identify the wide range of "facts"-or perhaps better the wide range of realities-that might be elicited. In some instances, modern historians are concerned with reconstructing specific events, generally because of their very great interest and significance.37 To be sure, this is a perilous process. As anyone who has had the dubious pleasure of serving on a jury well knows, reconstructing the details of a given event, even when there are numerous living witnesses who can be directly questioned, is a hazardous business. The legal system makes allowance for the difficulties in such reconstruction by establishing levels of doubt, recognizing in effect that there can be no absolute certainty in such reconstruction. By and large, however, modern historians are not concerned 'with the reconstruction of specific incidents, but rather with uncovering important patterns of behavior and thought.38 Here the brute "facts" serve 37. In my forthcoming book on the Barcelona disputation, the second chapter is devoted to an effort to reconstruct the event itself, with all due allowance for the uncertainty of such an enterprise. 38. In European Jewry and the First Crusade, my interest lay almost exclusively in recon- structing patterns of behavior and thought, both Christian and Jewish.</page><page sequence="17">FACTICITY OF HEBREW FIRST CRUSADE NARRATIVES 47 as evidence for broadly observable patterns of behavior in the past. The discrete "fact" is not the ultimate issue; it is rather the combination of a set of such "facts" that is decisive. This is the style of analysis most often essayed by contemporary social historians. Let me flesh out this point by turning our attention to a specific incident depicted richly in the lengthier of the two original Hebrew First Crusade narratives, viz., the burning of the synagogue of Mainz by a Jew who sur- vived the crusader assault on his community.39 The narrator provides a detailed account of the conversion of Isaac ben David the parnas, the res- toration of the family house, Isaac's decision to take his own life and the lives of the surviving members of his family, his slaughter of his children in the adjacent synagogue, his burning of the family home with his mother con- sumed by the flames, and finally his setting fire to the synagogue, in which he perished.40 What then are the facts or realities reflected in this story? On one level, there might be an effort at reconstructing details of the Mainz Jewish experience. I might suggest the following broad possibilities: (1) the details of the story might be accepted in their totality, including both the behaviors and the purported statements of the Jew Isaac; (2) the behaviors depicted might be accepted as factually accurate, with reservations as to the statements attributed to Isaac; (3) the detailed behaviors might be ques- tioned, accepting only the conclusion that there was a synagogue in Mainz that was burned by a Jew after the crusading mobs had departed; (4) the story in its totality might be rejected. Where one might wish to draw the line with respect to this kind of facticity is not easy to determine. There is, however, a second style of reconstruction, one that puts far less of a burden on the specific material. This second style of historical research involves identifying patterns of Jewish behavior and thinking. For establish- ing such patterns, any specific incident serves only as one of many sources of data. Thus, from the story of Isaac ben David, we can derive a number of important hypotheses as to how Jews took their own lives and the lives of 39. Neubauer and Stern, pp. 11-13; Habermann, pp. 36-38; Eidelberg, pp. 39-41; Chazan, pp. 262-265. 40. The passage is extremely rich in ancillary detail, e.g., the musings of Isaac about wealth, his search for the family treasure in the cellar of the house, the relationship of son to mother and father to children portrayed, the involvement of yet another converted Jew and his fate, the rumors that the synagogue would be transformed into a mint or into a church.</page><page sequence="18">48 ROBERT CHAZAN their families, the symbols that Jews invoked in their acts of martyrdom, and the special trauma suffered by some of those who converted. To the extent that the evidence supplied by the story of Isaac ben David is corroborated by other incidents in the narratives, we are then justified in utilizing these data for the purpose of this second style of historical research. What is sure- ly warranted in the utilization of the rich materials in the Hebrew First Crusade narratives is the uncovering of a series of patterns-patterns of Christian behavior, of Christian thinking, of Jewish behavior, of Jewish thinking. Examination of the Hebrew sources suggests that they are not con- trolled by a set of preexistent paradigms; the innovative and diverse behaviors depicted rule out the imposition of such preexistent paradigms.4' We are thus warranted, I would argue, in mining these sources to recon- struct actual patterns of Jewish and Christian behavior and thought mani- fested during the chaotic spring months of 1096. To this extent at least, the sources commend themselves as useful and reliable indices of aspects of the events of 1096.42 I am not suggesting that empirical observation was the goal of the Hebrew narratives. What I suggest, rather, is that, for the authors of the Hebrew narratives, the best way to make the case that they wished to make was to tell their tale in as close to a realistic manner as possible. As we recall, Marcus, in his Prooftexts article, espouses this view as well as in a passage, already cited, on the genres chosen by the narrators of the 1096 events. Toward the end of his essay, Marcus adds the following: "Once again his- torical accuracy is conveyed for reasons of religious ideology, not because the narrators were interested in the past for its own sake."43 In the view so 41. Recall Marcus's failure to identify an organizing theme around which the narratives were constructed. 42. I have focused heavily on the reconstruction of patterns of behavior and thought. In so doing, I do not wish to rule out reconstruction of specific events. I have paid less attention to this type of historiographic effort simply because it was not my goal in the utilization of the Hebrew First Crusade narratives. 43. Marcus, "From Politics to Martyrdom," p. 51. It is worth recalling the broad observa- tion of Haim Hillel Ben Sasson, in his study of medieval Jewish historiography, that "all medieval historiography is tendentious." "Concerning the Goals of Medieval Jewish Chrono- graphy and Its Problematics," Historyonim ve-Askolot Historyot (Jerusalem, 1963), p. 29. The issue is not tendentiousness; the issue is the narrators' means of achieving their purposes. Where the means they employed involve a fairly accurate portrayal of empirical realities, the data supplied can be utilized-always with requisite caution-by the modern historian.</page><page sequence="19">FACTICITY OF HEBREW FIRST CRUSADE NARRATIVES 49 expressed Marcus and I are quite at one. We both agree that fulfillment of the political, halakhic, and theological objectives of the authors/editors brought them to the point of introducing into their narratives realistic detail, not out of any commitment to historical knowledge for its own sake, but rather as a means of achieving the important goals which they had set for themselves. Thus, for example, in order to justify the extreme behavior of those martyrs who had exceeded the halakhic guidelines and the aggadic stereotypes of passive death at the hands of oppressors, it was necessary for the Jewish narrators of the events of 1096 to highlight in some detail the innovative behaviors of their heroes.44 The same diverse detail was required for mounting the theological case before God that there had never been such a martyrdom in Jewish history and hence its reward should be unparalleled. Only if the tale was told in a full and detailed manner could both cases be made effectively. We should be alert to the fact that, at about the same time that the Jewish authors/editors were composing their renditions of the appalling yet heroic events of 1096, a parallel group of writers in the Christian camp were extolling their heroes, the victorious warriors of the First Crusade. These Christian narratives, including both eyewitness accounts and later composi- tions, have been studied and utilized extensively. They are every bit as stylized and tendentious as the Jewish narratives. In fact Marcus's felicitous depiction of the Jewish records-"highly edited, rhetorically colored, and liturgically motivated literary reworkings of circular letters and oral reports, written for definite purposes"-would comfortably apply to all of the major Christian First Crusade accounts as well. Yet theological perspectives and literary embellishment have hardly led recent medievalists to disqualify these important sources in their search for the evidence upon which to base their wide-ranging analyses of the events of the First Crusade, including both reconstruction of specific events and identification of important pat- terns of crusading behavior and thought. Allowance has been made, to be sure, for elements of exaggeration and distortion, but no wholesale rejection of these sources has been proposed. I would suggest that here too scholars have found little tendency to impose inappropriate stereotypes and have dis- cerned enough diversity in these rich narratives to warrant a reasonable 44. For a depiction and discussion of the innovative patterns of Jewish martyrdom in 1096, see European Jewry and the First Crusade, pp. 105-136.</page><page sequence="20">50 ROBERT CHAZAN measure of comfort with the data that they supply.45 Like their Christian contemporaries, twelfth-century Jews narrating the events of the 1090s cer- tainly had at their disposal numerous examples of narration according to preexistent models; they were also aware, both within their tradition and outside it, of alternatives, of tendentious writing styles that found the depic- tion of diverse and multifaceted behaviors best suited to the achievement of their purpose. To be sure, highlighting diversified behaviors as a means for achieving the purposes of the Jewish and Christian narratives of the First Crusade explains only a portion of the remarkable freshness and openness of these accounts. While the complex goals of the authors/editors may explain the careful depiction of diversified forms of Jewish martyrdom, they do not adequately explain why the Jewish narrators should have chosen to acknowledge so readily nonheroic Jewish behaviors and-perhaps more strikingly-friendly Christian behaviors. Rather than making all Jews mar- tyrs and all Christians oppressors, the authors/editors of the Jewish narra- tives chose to acknowledge a far more nuanced reality, sometimes in ways that contravened their central purposes. In order to explain properly these aspects of the diversity of the 1096 narratives, in both Jewish and Christian behaviors, yet another factor has to be taken into consideration, and that is the general change in perceptions that is a central aspect to what has been so often depicted as the "twelfth-century renaissance." The new mentality, which has been widely studied and depicted, involved above all else a con- cern for the real and the multifaceted in both nature and human affairs. While it is prudent to maintain a level of skepticism with respect to claims of Zeitgeist, the evidence of this new spirit is so compelling, and parallel con- clusions have been reached by so many distinguished researchers, that one can hardly remain unaware or unconvinced of these innovative pro- clivities.46 45. Specific materials have been rejected by modern historians. Note, e.g., the thorough skepticism that has developed with respect to the details of Urban II's speech at Clermont. Nonetheless, the major recent histories of the Crusades have shown no inclination to reject narrative materials as the basis for their reconstructions. 46. The literature on twelfth-century innovation is now extremely rich. Among the most useful treatments are Ghellinck, L'Essor de la litterature latine au XIIe sitcle and Le mouvement thdologique du XIIe sitcle, 2nd ed. (Brussels, 1948); Chenu, Nature, Man, and Society in the Twelfth Century; R. W. Southern, The Making of the Middle Ages (London, 1953) and Medieval Humanism and Other Studies (Oxford, 1970); the essays collected in Benson and Constable,</page><page sequence="21">FACTICITY OF HEBREW FIRST CRUSADE NARRATIVES 51 Let us note two powerful statements by one of the most wide-ranging investigators of the new twelfth-century spirit, M.-D. Chenu. The first of these speaks to the phenomenon in its breadth and diversity. Merely to mention the new and fresh perceptions that writers, artists, and sculptors offered to the sensibilities of their contemporaries, or the secular shape that men of politics and affairs were giving to institutions hitherto sacra- mentalized, is to suggest, as one must, which way the wind was blowing- blowing over all of nature, from flora and fauna to the shape given to the human body, from erotic impulses to the behavior pattern of corporate life. One finds the strophe of William of Aquitaine on springtime, and the volup- tuous Eve on the lintel of the north portal at Autun; the sketchbooks of Villard of Honnecourt, and the erotic casuistry of Chretien de Troyes; the small tradesmen set in the stone of capitals, and the realistic sense of man's destiny among the great chroniclers; the political psychology of John of Salisbury, and the anticlericalism of the second part of the Roman de la Rose; the limitation of certain secular rights of the clergy by Philip Augustus or St. Louis, and recourse to rational proofs in courts of law instead of the mystical expedient of trials by ordeal. The whole world of pseudonature, which had long cast its deluding shadow over things and men, was fading from men's imagination; it was by quite other means than imagination that nature, discovered now in its earthly reality, would acquire its religious significance and lead men to God.47 What is so striking about this passage is the broad range of phenomena that is invoked to illustrate this new spirit. Let us complement this passage with a second, in which Chenu addresses historical consciousness in particular, using as his example precisely the materials that we are addressing, crusad- ing narratives; to be sure, those from the Christian side. Of course feudal people had always been interested in the past and enjoyed hearing about it; but they sang of the great deeds of their ancestors, and their imagination transformed the exaltation of these memories into epics. Men of the second half of the twelfth century remained sensitive to the dramatic and lyrical seduction of the chanson de geste, which they overloaded with episodes. But the "epic fermentation," as Gaston Paris called it, did not deal with con- Renaissance and Renewal in the Twelfth Century; Brian Stock, The Implications of Literacy (Princeton, 1983). 47. Chenu, Nature, Man, and Society in the Twelfth Century, p. 5.</page><page sequence="22">52 ROBERT CHAZAN temporary material, that of the crusades for example, which would have lent itself to the same treatment. They began to distinguish the description of the real from pure escape literature. Apart from the literature of fables and dreams, and even if contaminated by legend, "true history, bit by bit, took the place of the epic in the collective memory." This was a new awareness that went beyond the isolated individual to embrace all of society, a society for which human affairs became a legitimate matter of concern.48 Parallel to my argument that the behaviors and attitudes of the 1096 martyrs can only be properly understood against the backdrop of the new sensibility of the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, I contend that the Hebrew First Crusade narratives must similarly be seen as part of the in- vigorating new sensitivity to nature and society that developed during this period. It was this new sensitivity, alongside the complex goals of the nar- rators, that moved them to reject earlier stereotypes and to essay a depiction of the events of 1096 in a fresh and relatively accurate fashion. It is the com- bination of tendentious purposes and new spirit of observation and depic- tion that accounts for the more realistic style of the Hebrew First Crusade narratives. While this combination does not assure absolute faithfulness to the events, and while care must-as always-be exercised in utilizing the data provided in these narratives, wholesale dismissal of the evidence provided by these accounts is surely unwarranted. Such out-of-hand rejec- tion of the Hebrew First Crusade narratives fails to recognize the special qualities of these narratives, the means which their authors chose for achiev- ing their purposes, and the larger intellectual and spiritual environment in which they were created.49 48. Ibid., pp. 175-176. The quotation, "true history, bit by bit, took the place of epic in the collective memory," was drawn by Chenu from Marc Bloch's Feudal Society. 49. This setting of the Hebrew First Crusade narratives in the context of twelfth-century intellectual and spiritual creativity leaves us with one further problem, and that is the dis- appearance of this vigorous new style from the Jewish scene. To be sure, the disappearance was far from instantaneous. Some of the same spirit is, it seems to me, notable in the letters that depict the Blois tragedy of 1171 and in the remarkable narrative account by Rabbi Moses ben Nahman of his Barcelona encounter with Friar Paul Christian. Such instances notwithstanding, Yerushalmi's basic contention, in Zakhor, as to the rarity of this style in medieval Jewish his- tory writing remains correct and begs explanation. At this juncture, I have no full answer to the problem. I would only note provisionally the estrangement of northern-European Jewry from those areas in which the most exciting intellectual and spiritual creativity was taking place. This is only a cursory and provisional suggestion; the issue bears further thought.</page><page sequence="23">FACTICITY OF HEBREW FIRST CRUSADE NARRATIVES 53 Postscript Subsequent to the completion of this paper, another important study by Ivan G. Marcus has appeared in Prooftexts, a study entitled "History, Story and Collective Memory: Narrativity in Early Ashkenazic Culture."o50 This study appeared too late to permit me to integrate my reactions into the body of this text. I have been allowed, however, to append some comments that will hopefully add further clarification to my position on medieval narrative sources. Since the new Marcus study makes a number of general observa- tions on the genre, this postscript permits me to close with observations broader than those embodied in the paper. Marcus begins with some fundamental observations on historiographic styles. He suggests three categories of students of Jewish narratives about the past, "depending on whether they are looking for 'facts,' literary genres and motifs, or the historical meaning of cultural symbols." The first group Marcus calls "historical positivists," the second "folklorists," and the third "anthropological historians." Marcus discusses each of these three groups briefly and then proceeds to provide two illuminating examples of the approach of the "anthropological historians," one drawn from the work of Gerson D. Cohen on Abraham ibn Daud and the second involving the Carolingian myths of early Ashkenazic Jewry.5' I surely have no quarrel with the legitimacy of "anthropological history" or the "folkloristic" approach. The focus of this study has been the facticity of some important medieval Hebrew narratives, and it is therefore with Marcus's first category that I am most concerned. Let us look at Marcus's brief treatment of this group. He speaks of the canonical texts of medieval Jewish historiography as the texts that look like history based on the positivist's perspective that facts are embedded in these narratives or form some proportion thereof. They are thought to be narratives that record events that actually happened. The collec- 50. Ivan G. Marcus, "History, Story and Collective Memory: Narrativity in Early Ash- kenazic Culture," Prooftexts 10 (1990): 1-23. Note Marcus's parallel abandonment of the term "chronicle" in favor of the looser designation "narrative." 51. The same combination of sources is addressed by Joseph Shatzmiller, "Politics and the Myth of Origins: The Case of the Medieval Jews," in Les Juifs au regard de I'histoire, ed. Gilbert Dahan (Paris, 1985), pp. 49-61.</page><page sequence="24">54 ROBERT CHAZAN tion and the approach of the positivists is based on the nineteenth-century Rankean epistemology that governs most academic historiography to this day. It posits that the past can be retold "wie es eigentlich gewesen"-as it actually happened.52 In illustrating the positivistic tendency, Marcus cites the work of Avraham Grossman and myself, suggesting that we focus almost exclusively on the facticity of narratives that are not in reality documentary "sources." Not that events and "facts" do not exist out there "behind" these texts, but they are not "in" them, and the persistent assump- tion that they are leads to few positive results and, more significantly, avoids a more appropriate analysis that would make historical sense of what that type of source can tell us. But it is not at all obvious that the positivist approach and its logically derived anthology of texts are either the only ones or the ones that enable one to reach the very goals its practitioners seek: to discover what Jews-thinkers and more ordinary Jews-thought, felt, and wrote about the past."5 Let me begin with the last of these observations. If I am a representative of Marcus's first category, then I feel that he has arbitrarily diminished my goals in the study of such texts as the Hebrew First Crusade narratives and similar narrative records. Like him, I am much interested in what Jews "thought, felt, and wrote about the past."54 That, however, is not "the very goal" that I seek. I am also very much concerned with what happened dur- ing the First Crusade. While in no sense denying the desirability and possibi- lity of extracting insight on how subsequent Jews viewed the past, I am, at the same time, vitally interested in the realities of that past. Now, in this new statement, is Marcus suggesting that insight into those realities can or cannot be derived from medieval narratives? It seems to me that this new study straddles the fence. Whereas his 1982 Prooftexts article, as we have seen, posited a significant relationship between the Hebrew nar- ratives and the realities of 1096, and his Speculum review denied any such relationship, this new Prooftexts article does not take a firm position. To be sure, to call this style of historical research "positivist history" and to root it in Rankean epistemology is scornful, but at no point does Marcus state un- 52. Marcus, "History, Story and Collective Memory," p. 2. 53. Ibid., pp. 2-3. 54. Recall my discussion of the post- 1096 reactions of Ashkenazic Jewry in chap. 5 of Euro- pean Jewry and the First Crusade.</page><page sequence="25">FACTICITY OF HEBREW FIRST CRUSADE NARRATIVES 55 equivocally that such historical research cannot be done. We are thus left with three Marcus positions: one suggesting that "positivist history" can be written, the second that it cannot be written, and the third indecisive. Let me conclude by reestablishing my position. I accept the validity of both "anthropological history" and "folkloristic" study. To the extent that any other use of narrative sources is dismissed, I disagree. Marcus's dismis- sal of these materials is rooted in two methodological errors, one involving the unwarranted conflation of a number of diverse historiographic styles under the designation "positivist," and the second involving the lumping together of a broad spectrum of sources under the single rubric of narrative texts. Let us begin with the former. Marcus treats all efforts at identifying historical realities in narrative sources as "positivist," a designation surely intended as pejorative. He treats such positivism as a continuation of Rankean epistemology and speaks of the "'stuff of the positivist" as "nitty- gritty details.""55 Now, my earlier analysis suggested that there are in fact at least three discernible styles of historical reconstruction of past events from narrative depictions (or, for that matter, from any other genre of source material as well). These include: (1) antiquarian reconstruction of past events on the assumption that the sources are accurate and faithful in their rendition of these events-while such historical writing may lie at the root of Marcus's displeasure, such work is in fact far from the norm among his present-day colleagues; (2) painstaking effort at reconstruction of past events-generally significant incidents, with full appreciation for the diffi- culties in such reconstruction and with full recognition of the tentativeness of the results of such effort; (3) identification of patterns of behavior and thought. In this last style of historical reconstruction, the discrete facts assembled bear less of a burden than Marcus places upon them, since they only assume meaning when they are corroborated by other data,56 When no imposed patterning from traditional paradigms can be discovered, then the data presented in narrative sources can be utilized-always with all due caution-by the modern researcher, in particular for the reconstruction of patterns of past behavior and thought. 55. Marcus, "History, Story and Collective Memory," pp. 2 and 4. 56. Marcus's conflation of diverse historiographic styles leads him to make exaggerated demands on the broad group of historians that he designates "positivist." In his Speculum review, he was highly critical of my failure to examine the few erasures in one of the manu- scripts by ultraviolet light. Similarly, in "History, Story and Collective Memory," he says: "Great pains must be taken to reconstruct the best possible state of the text-every letter can be</page><page sequence="26">56 ROBERT CHAZAN This last point leads us to the second of the methodological errors. Just as there is a spectrum of modern approaches to the past, so too there is a spectrum of narrative texts available to us from that past. Some of these texts bear only the most tenuous relationship to the events depicted; some, on the other hand, are highly reliable. To lump all narrative sources into one category is unacceptable. Narrative texts differ widely with respect to such matters as distance from the events depicted, reliability of channels of com- munication of information, rigidity of paradigms imposed, fullness and heterogeneity of detail.57 I agree wholeheartedly that no a priori assumption of reliability can be made when a medieval narrative text is encountered. At the same time, I similarly reject all a priori dismissal of narrative sources. In all cases, the specific narrative must be examined from a variety of perspec- tives, discussed at some length in this paper. The impact of literary para- digms can be noted, can enhance our understanding of the text, and can expand our knowledge of the history of folkloristic motifs and literary style. The purposes of the authors can be analyzed, can put us on guard against distortions, and can form an important element in the history of Jewish poli- tical, social, and religious thinking. Beyond all this, many narrative texts- the Hebrew First Crusade narratives upon which this paper has focused and others as well-can be utilized to reconstruct aspects of Jewish and non- Jewish experience in the context depicted. To reject such reconstruction as a goal of historical research seems to me unwarranted; to argue that narrative texts provide no evidence for such reconstruction seems to me unreasonable. New York University New York, N.Y. a significant datum about a person, place or date." I would argue that such special standards apply to those involved in textual editing or with some kind of antiquarian reconstruction. However, those historians interested in reconstructing patterns of Jewish and non-Jewish behavior and thought depicted in medieval narrative materials bear no greater burden-it seems to me-than their confreres concerned with "folkloristic" and "anthropological" his- tory. Given their utilization of reinforcing data, for such historians every letter does not bear the weight assigned to it by Marcus. 57. Note Marcus's reference to Avraham Grossman and myself as examples of "positivist" historiography. While I am truly flattered to be lumped with such a distinguished colleague, the disparity in the materials with which the two of us have worked is most striking. Marcus has in effect combined slim narrative materials written many centuries after the fact with rich, detailed, and highly nuanced materials based on eyewitness testimony and early written reports. Such combinations will not do. Each set of materials must be carefully assessed with respect to its potential facticity.</page></plain_text>
