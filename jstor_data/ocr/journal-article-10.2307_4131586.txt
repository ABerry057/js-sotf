<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stephen Katz. The Centrifugal Novel: S. Y Agnon 's Poetics of Composition. Madi- son and Teaneck, NJ: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1999. 219 pp. Agnon studies are still with us. The great modern Hebrew prose writer has been gone for nearly three decades, but new studies in Hebrew and even in En- glish have made it seem as if he were still in our midst. They continue to increase 175</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review our understanding of his life and his oeuvre, obviously, but the immediacy of this Nobel prize laureate for his particular culture strikes me as unique among western literary figures. Speaking only of English, in this decade alone, Anne Golomb Hoffman and Nitzah Ben Dov have published full-length monographs, and scores of articles have appeared on subjects ranging from biography to inter- textual exploration, and from language to folklore sources. All this is on top of an even more plentiful supply of materials from the '70s and '80s (some Israeli schol- ars, like Shaked, have even published in English), which followed on the heels of Arnold Band's indispensable Nostalgia and Nightmare. One has to assume that Dan Laor's comprehensive Agnon biography, HayyeiAgnon-which has just been published-will be translated into English and share its plentiful light with the purely English-speaking scholarly community. Laor's biography was not complet- ed when Stephen Katz published The Centrifugal Novel, although several articles containing material intended for the eventual biography appeared over recent years. It can be a pleasant surprise to see how classic belles-lettres are illuminated through new critical lenses and new combinations of lenses. Agnon can be turned and turned again, and-one hopes-the process won't stop soon. Of course, that turning is most relevant within Israeli scholarship, where a larger community un- derstands the native cultural issues more fully, and many writers acknowledge their own literary obligation to the great Galician story teller. (Katz notes Laor's con- tribution to the discussion in his note 6 to Chapter One.) Katz endorses the well-discussed notion of centripetal and centrifugal vec- tors in Agnon's longer prose work. "The centripetal approach to the formation of works of fiction reveals a process of creation by segments: pieces of narrative are joined, at times artificially, in a chainlike sequence of scenes having associative and causal connection with each other ... " (p. 26). "The centrifugal novel, on the oth- er hand, may be likened to the ideal sculpture imprisoned within a block of mar- ble ... awaiting the artist's act of releasing it by chipping away at all excessive mat- ter, leaving intact only that which is the work of art. To gain their ideal balance, centrifugal works tend to undergo significant contraction leaving behind any num- ber or combination of episodes or short stories ... " (pp. 26 and 27). I will leave it to Israeli critics to comment on whether Stephen Katz's work will be viewed as an original contribution within the Israeli community. It certainly represents a more complete study than has been available in English about one as- pect of Agnon studies-a significant elaboration of the inevitable studies of vari- ant texts of Agnon's work. Clearly his application of this notion to Oreah Natah LaLun ("A Guest for the Night") runs counter to the evidence of Band's original reckoning of the length of the novel's two primary editions. Katz combines his concentration on Oreah Natah LaLun with the fascinating examination of the author's personal life and the relationship of that life to the fic- tive persona he created-as storyteller and chorus to the action on life's stage. Fur- thermore, Katz demonstrates how some of the themes in the works which have been built out of several units work themselves out in other fictions, so that one may trace both themes and character. For the English reader this is an especially 176</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews important contribution, but even Hebrew readers may gain from the diligence of Katz's analysis. Katz has taken up the question of the literary persona of the storyteller- narrator whom Agnon created as an author, and draws upon his research within the Agnon Archives to demonstrate the self-consciousness with which the apparently manipulative storyteller, the "unreliable narrator," sets out to confound his reader as a part of the reading enterprise. For Katz, Agnon's narrator functions as a char- acter within many of the novels and longer short stories. This in itself is not news to regular readers of Agnon; what is news is that there is support for this readerly conclusion within the archives and storage of manuscripts themselves. Eschewing the classical new critical concentration on the finished literary product, Katz has found evidence of a conscientious and determined use of rabbinic sources and sources from other stories within the Agnon oeuvre for the creation of new mate- rial. Thus, the study of manuscripts, pieces of paper, ostensibly random notes, and so forth adds to our understanding of the author's intention, and, more important, creates a kind of metanarrative to the narrative as it came to be completed. The book begins with a quaint anecdotal introduction to Bet Agnon, in a sen- sitive description which captures the deceptive maneuvers of this author-tricky both in his life and as a fictional persona. The intimate opening invites visitors to the Agnon home and draws one into the experience of uncovering the evidence that Agnon created a fictional character out of himself through the artifacts he has left for us to discover. The life depicted in the museum's video tape and other orga- nized curatorial presentations of Agnon (artful though all this is) are not nearly as satisfying, ultimately, as a careful piecing together of life and work. Katz con- tributes mightily to this piecing together, as does the epistolary presentation "Es- therlein" which has been so popular on Israeli stages over the last couple of years. My only substantive argument with Stephen Katz's book has to do with his effort to carry new critical thought to a "logical conclusion" which would deny us a scholarship of building our understanding of Agnon and his oeuvre out of the re- ality of text and life. The straw man of new criticism has already been discredited, even as the new critical legacy remains something to be heeded and utilized to en- hance one's appreciation of an integrated literary text. Let all these flowers bloom, and we shall be able to continue in our literary progress on all fronts. Indeed, there are instances in Katz's study where one misses a discussion of the story itself, where the critic has let themes and meaning and intricate descriptions of story con- struction interrupt one's appreciation of the delights that await a reading ofAgnon's stories. Katz's approach to the work would restrict the uninitiated Agnon reader from appreciating what made this writer such a pleasure to read as well as so weighty an artist. And so we welcome work on Agnon by some of our traditional close readers. Books like The Centrifugal Novel owe their importance to the new critical legacy. On a less substantive level, "S. Y. Agnon's Poetics of Composition" needed considerably more editing than it received. The work is full of typographical er- rors, debatable calls about punctuation, and extended sentences that should have been re-composed. Antecedents need to be searched out, and sentences that ought 177</page><page sequence="4">AJS Review to have ended early extend into indeterminacy. I fear that this fine study may not get the attention it deserves because of these editing problems. Having said that, I can urge owning and using this important book, for its many ideas and for its dili- gent provision of notes, relevant appendices, and insights about composition.
