<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review 27:1 (2003), 1-22 THE COPENHAGEN SCHOOL: THE HISTORIOGRAPHICAL ISSUES* by Marc Brettler A bit more than a quarter of a century has passed since the publication of Thomas Thompson's landmark The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives,' in- augurating what has been called the Copenhagen School, typified by the works of Thompson and Niels Peter Lemche, who now both teach at the University of Copenhagen. Few works have changed the face of biblical scholarship so com- pletely. In conjunction with John Van Seters' Abraham in History and Tradition,2 Thompson's book sounded the death knell for those who insisted on the historici- ty of the patriarchal period, a relatively common position up to that point, espe- cially in America. By illustrating that details of the Genesis narratives reflect first rather than second millennium institutions, contrary to the claims of Albright, Gor- don, Speiser,3 and others, Thompson began a revolution in biblical scholarship. A parallel revolution was fostered by Lemche, whose Danish work of 19724 precedes that of Thompson. Lemche, however, only became well known following his publication in 1985 of Early Israel: Anthropological and Historical Studies on the Israelite Society Before the Monarchy. 5 Lemche, too, was iconoclastic, disman- *This is a revised version of a paper delivered at a conference on the Copenhagen School at Northwestern University in October 1999.

This theory, promulgated by Albrecht Alt and his student, Martin Noth, in 1929-1930, suggested that Israel was joined together in the period of judges through a rotating central sanctuary (the am- phictyony), which was fundamental in creating Israel.6 This theory was extremely influential for almost half a century, especially within German scholarship, because of its power to explain why the Pentateuch incorporates such a diversity of tradi- tions: they originated in different groups assembled around a central sanctuary. Lemche was one of several scholars who pointed out the fundamental problems of this model, imported from classical studies; he noted, for example, that the classic Delphic amphictyony, the model typically used by biblical scholars, only came into being in the eighth pre-Christian century.7 Like Thompson, his emphasis was un- covering anachronisms in the scholarly reconstructions of the premonarchic peri- od. He observed concerning the period of judges: "Accordingly it must be con- cluded that it is irrational to believe that we in the Book of Judges find historical documents in the proper sense of the word."8 Lemche's findings concerning the non-existence of the amphictyony in ancient Israel, as well as his observations in his 1985 book, Early Israel, concerning the highly problematic nature of the "peri- od of judges," have been embraced by most mainstream biblical scholars. These early seminal works of the Copenhagen School were by and large pos- itively received, and they helped to revolutionize the field of biblical scholarship.9 More recently, these scholars have taken the methods and conclusions of their ear- lier works and applied them to later and later biblical periods; these more recent works have been quite controversial, both within biblical scholarship and in the popular press. In terms of large-scale works, 1992 is a fundamental date. That was the publication year of Thompson's Early History of the Israelite People From the Written and Archaeological Sources, which concludes: "The linguistic and liter- ary reality of the biblical tradition is folkloristic in essence. The concept of a benei Israel ... is a reflection of no sociopolitical entity of the historical state of Israel of the Assyrian period...." o That year also marked the publication of the first edition of Philip R. Davies' In Search of 'Ancient Israel,'where the words "Ancient Israel" of the title are in quotation marks, suggesting that the search yields nega- tive results. A complete overview of the Copenhagen School is infeasible in this con- text." Even a comprehensive examination of the work of two core members of 6. See A. D. H.

Instead, this es- say will focus on a seminal article of Lemche, and on two recent summaries that indicate that this school has come of age: Lemche's The Israelites in History and Tradition, 3 published in 1998, and Thompson's 1999 book, The Mythic Past: Bib- lical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel,' 14 published in England as The Bible in History: How Writers Create a Past. The main theme of these works is already evident in their titles. The Israelites in History and Tradition is a play on John Van Seters' Abraham in History and Tra- dition,15 which, along with Thompson's The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narra- tives, removed the patriarchal period from modern histories of Israel. In this new work, Lemche approaches the entire Bible with a similar perspective. The use of "myth" twice in Thompson's American title highlights its objective. Thompson's preferred title, preserved in the British publication'6--The Bible in History: How Writers Create a Past-is a polemical play on one of the best-selling books that in- sists on the basic historicity of the Bible: Werner Keller's The Bible as History.'7 Before examining these two very recent books by Lemche and Thompson, it is useful to focus on a seminal article that articulates in a concise form many of the points made in these larger works: the 1993 article by Lemche, "The Old Tes- tament-A Hellenistic Book?"'8 The oeuvre of Lemche and Thompson may be examined from many perspectives; the focus here will be on historiographical is- sues. For this reason, it is important to establish how biblical historical texts were written. The following observations would garner general assent:I" (1) History, in the sense of the events themselves, does not write texts. People write texts. (2) Es- pecially in the pre-modern world, people did not write about the past for its own sake-there was little intrinsic interest in the past. This is reflected in the many re- cent academic discussions on history and memory, which consider memory, in contrast to history, to be more typical of the pre-modern era. (3) The rise of mod- ern historiography, with its interest in the past as it actually was, is a relatively re- cent development, connected to the rise of the modern German university. Before that, history tended to be national history. (4) If pre-modern history was not in- terested in "the objective" past, it was primarily interested in its author's present. (5) Ideology is a significant component in all history writing. 12. Niels Peter Lemche, Early Israel (VTSup 37; Leiden: Brill, 1985). 13.

Biblical "historical" texts were written by people, who were religious ideologues (theologians), and they were predomi- nantly interested in the present and the future, rather than in accurately transcrib- ing the past. This is epitomized by Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi: "Israel is told that it must be a kingdom of priests and a holy people; nowhere is it suggested that it be- come a nation of historians."20 This does not mean, however, that the biblical au- thors never got their facts right, and that the Bible is useless or nearly useless, as a source of the history of ancient Israel. Cartography offers a useful analogy to history writing. We expect a map of the Chicago area, let us say, to be similar to the actual city in significant ways. It should reflect the city, but obviously it cannot be the city. Depending on scale and goal, it will emphasize certain characteristics, and de-emphasize others. Maps are judged based on their goals: a physical map that left out Lake Michigan with its various depths would be judged grossly deficient, but a human population map need not include this information. A Department of Public Works map should in- dicate the water mains; this would not be expected of a cultural map of the city. All would agree that pre-modern cartographers could not use Global Posi- tioning System data and satellite photos to draw their maps, and as a result, these old maps are less accurate than contemporary ones. However, are they all funda- mentally wrong, even when their primary goal is ideological? For example, most scholars acknowledge that the Medeba Map, a mosaic from the floor of a sixth- century Jordanian church, is in many respects quite accurate, although its artist probably did not travel the entire area, but used Eusebius as his main source. As well, this artist was highly ideological, placing Jerusalem at the center of the world.21 Granted, this map depicts the area poorly, compared to a modern map made using space-age technology, but is it totally different in kind from the mod- ern map? Returning to reconstructing biblical history: scholars grant the Copen- hagen School's fundamental point that the biblical sources cannot be paraphrased by the modern historian in an attempt to create history, since they map out the world in a pre-modern fashion. But, might these texts nevertheless, like pre-modern maps, be used with care to recreate the past that they purport to depict, or do they reflect only their author's ideology or theology? There is a general sense among ancient historians that the closer the text is to the events, the more reliable it may be. An eyewitness account certainly need not be reliable: it may be seriously tainted by theology, ideology, or poor observa- tion. The Chinese accounts of what we call the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 illustrate this; compare, for example, the pro-student accounts to the offical account.22 As well, accounts which are subsequent to the events depicted are even 20.

Thus, one of the first questions typically asked by historians concerns the distance of the text from the event. Proximity need not assure accuracy, nor need distance assure inaccuracy, but this is often the case. This is why the date of biblical historical texts is a crucial issue for the mod- ern historian of the biblical period.23 For these reasons, Lemche's "The Old Testament-A Hellenistic Book?" (see n. 18) is very important. Until the 1970s, small sections of the Bible, for ex- ample, parts of Daniel, were recognized as Hellenistic, but these were considered to be anomalous. The earliest of the narrative sources, J (the Yahwist), was con- sidered by most to be a tenth-century work, reflecting the period of real kings named David and Solomon.24 Over the last few decades, this position has eroded.25 Source criticism has begun to fall apart, thanks to the work of some Scandinavian scholars26 and others, like the German Rolf Rendtorff27 and the British scholar R. N. Whybray.28 A new position had begun to develop by the late 1970s, which saw relative unity in much of the Torah and viewed it as a reflection of the trauma of the Babylonian exile. For example, David J. A. Clines observed: "wherever ex- ilic Jewry opens the Pentateuch it finds itself."29 This type of position, which tends to view the Torah as a unity that is the product of the exilic period, has been in- fluential, and Lemche's position may be seen as an extension of this view. Lemche suggests that the majority of the OT30 is Hellenistic, although there bert, eds., Beijing Spring, 1989: Confrontation and Conflict. The Basic Documents (Armonk, NY: M. Sharp, 1990), pp. 55-88. Note the reflective analysis in "Afterward: History, Myth, and the Tales of Tiananmen," in Popular Protest and Political Culture in Modern China: Learning from 1989, eds. J. Wasserstrom and E. Perry (Oxford: Westview Press, 1992), pp. 244-280. 23. This is especially so in contemporary scholarship, where the old assumptions concerning the fundamental conservatism of texts that eventually became part of the Bible, and of oral traditions, has been questioned. Concerning the latter, the work of the Scandinavian Lemche has been instru- mental in questioning the work of the Scandinavian School of Epic, which had emphasized the fun- damental reliability of epic tradition; see his Early Israel, pp. 380-383. The study of folklore would confirm these observations concerning the variable accuracy of oral audition. 24.

On the other hand, he suggests that the Bible is really post-Hellenistic, since "in its present shape-[it] is a Jewish- Rabbinic collection of writings no earlier than the 2nd Century CE" (p. 163). A particular understanding of canon is crucial to this viewpoint; Lemche (implicit- ly) rejects the argument often voiced these days for a canon within a canon,31 and understands the canonization of the Bible as a unified event, caused by the de- struction of the Second Temple and the Hadrianic persecutions of the second cen- tury CE (p. 163). In addressing possible counter-evidence to this hypothesis, in particular, the fact that the Samaritan canon comprised of only the Torah reflects an earlier stage of canonization, he suggests that the Samaritan community did not like the Jerusalem-centered ideology of biblical books other than the Torah and this is why these non-Torah texts were not canonized. Lemche's position is not absolutely impossible, but is quite unlikely. Various pieces of evidence that he has not addressed do suggest that the Torah was canon- ized first, and that we should not speak of a CE canon. This is conceded by Philip Davies, who in a recent important book on canonization notes that the Pentateuch likely existed before Nehemiah or Ezra.32 A recent debate has emerged concern- ing nevi'im and ketubim, the second and third parts of the Hebrew canon, name- ly, were these two sections originally a single section, divided only later,33 or do they reflect historically distinct divisions, with nevi'im preceding ketubim.34 How- ever, citations of Torah material in Chronicles and elsewhere using a formula like "kakatuv" ("as is written"),35 as well as evidence from the Dead Sea Scrolls, where 4QMMT, one of the earlier scrolls, refers to "sefer moshe" ("the book of Moses") alongside "sifrei ha nevi'im " ("the books of the prophets") and "David,"36 seem to suggest that the canon was not emergent as a single unit only in the aftermath of the destruction of the Temple, but, rather, it emerged in stages. Canon is a notoriously difficult and important concept; the many recent ob- servations of Philip Davies in his Scribes and Schools: The Canonization of the 31. This model is the basis for inner-biblical interpretation; see esp. Michael Fishbane, Bibli- cal Interpretation in Ancient Israel (Oxford: Clarendon, 1985). Sid Z. Leiman, The Canonization of Hebrew Scriptures: The Talmudic and Midrashic Evidence (Hamden, Conn: Archon Books, 1976), makes a strong argument that the tripartite canon represents distinct stages of canon formation. 32. Philip R. Davies, Scribes and Schools: The Canonization of the Hebrew Scriptures (Louis- ville: Westminster John Knox, 1998), p. 101. 33. This is the position of John Barton, The Oracles of God: Perceptions of Ancient Israelite Prophecy in Israel after Exile (New York: Oxford University Press, 1986), pp. 35-95. 34. This was the traditional, pre-Barton position. For a critique of Barton, see R. T. Beckwith, "A Modern Theory of the Old Testament Canon," VT 41 (1991), pp. 385-395. A useful, recent sum- mary of issues concerning the canon is found in John Barton, "The Significance of a Fixed Canon of the Hebrew Bible," in Hebrew Bible/Old Testament: The History of Its Interpretation, ed. Magne Sae- bo (G6ttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1996), 1.67-83. 35.

Yet, the brief attempt by Lemche to create an alternate understanding of the canon, an un- derstanding that only takes into account a small part of the available evidence (pp. 164-168), is not sufficient to undermine the notion of a canon that in part predates the Hellenistic period. Stated differently, theories must be judged on the basis of evidence, which is weighed, and Lemche, in offering his new under- standing of canon, has not weighed all the evidence, explaining, for example, why Joshua-Kings, but not Ezra-Nehemiah are part of nevi'im-one of the most im- portant pieces of evidence for a tripartite canon that reflects a historical process.38 Old theories may certainly be wrong, but they cannot be proven to be wrong by showing that one element used to support them is wrong. As well, although it is proper to muddy that which is often presented too simplistically, that also is not enough evidence to disprove an existing theory (in this case, plausible, though un- likely, scenarios concerning the relative development of the Hebrew and Greek or- der of the Bible have been presented [pp. 164-165]. Old theories are revised when it is shown that the preponderance of evidence used to buttress them, as well as other, new39 evidence, is best explained through a new theory-but this is not the case here. Other evidence adduced by Lemche, such as the fact that the first complete OT is found in Greek, is highly problematic. Although Lemche is correct in not- ing that we must place the traditions found in Samuel between the 1 1th century BCE, the scholarly date for the prophet Samuel, and the "first half of the 4th cen- tury CE," the date of the earliest complete Samuel manuscripts (p. 169), his con- clusion that within this period, "we should, of course, start where we are best in- formed," is problematic. It is silly to be so insistent on a 4th-century terminus ad quem, based on the earliest complete Septuagint manuscripts. Lemche seems to relish italicizing the word "fragments" in reference to the Dead Sea Scrolls (e.g. p. 170), indicating that these might not be reflective of the book as a whole. It is correct that there was not a single book of Samuel in the library of Qumran, since the text had yet to be established; indeed, one of the copies of the book differs from the later Massoretic text, incorporating an episode later lost through textual error.40 But here is the evidence: We do not have the entire book preserved at Qumran. We have four different manuscripts of Samuel that contain pieces, some largely iden- tical to the book as it is later known from the Septuagint;41 only much later, in the first millennium, do we have complete Hebrew manuscripts of the book. But there is little reason to doubt Samuel's existence as a book at Qumran: The fragments 37. See n. 32 for full citation. 38. See Leiman, The Canonization of Hebrew Scriptures. 39. In the case of biblical studies, new evidence may be archaeological, or may reflect the de- velopment of a new theory that succeeds in explaining a wide variety of texts more successfully than previously. 40.

VanderKam, The Dead Sea Scrolls Today (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1994), pp. 129-130 and the discussion of Eugene Ulrich, The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Origins of the Bible (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1999), pp. 28-29. 7</page><page sequence="8">Marc Brettler largely overlap with the larger book as it was later preserved, and most likely come from some form(s) of the book of Samuel. In other words, the Qumran fragments are not like the separate Sumerian Gilgamesh stories, which were later joined to- gether to form an Akkadian epic and which differ in many details and in structure from the epic.42 Lemche is correct that "no absolute proof exists that these books must be older" than 340-350 CE (p. 169), the date of the Vaticanus Septuagint manuscript. However, "absolute proof" is rare in the study of antiquity. For example, classi- cists do not claim that Herodotus is medieval because the earliest complete man- uscript of The Histories dates from the 9-10th century.43 Furthermore, if we ac- knowledge Lemche's position, we would have to date the Hebrew Bible to 925 CE, the approximate date of Aleppo,44 the first time a complete Bible was copied in a single codex.45 Or perhaps we should be suspicious of the stories surrounding Aleppo, which is no longer completely preserved, and should date the Hebrew Bible to 1008-1009, the date of Codex Leningrad B 19A, the earliest completely preserved Bible in a single volume. Lemche's suggestion that we "start where we are best informed" when find- ing the historical basis of a text is further problematic because we are ill-informed about so much of the biblical period, especially the early pre-exilic period, thanks to Lemche, Thompson, and others. We are somewhat better informed in the Hel- lenistic period, as a result of Josephus, Philo, and some Greek and Roman authors who noticed Jews and wrote about them, but this is irrelevant. Much of this Hel- lenistic material, especially that found in the great apologist Josephus, must be used with great caution;46 the same skeptical rules used by Thompson and Lem- che of the biblical authors must be applied to these ancient scholars as well.47 Fur- thermore, let us imagine that we had a consensus concerning the reconstruction of the Hellenistic period, alongside a consensus that the earlier Persian period can hardly be reconstructed and an agreement that offering any detailed survey of still earlier exilic and pre-exilic periods is impossible. In addition, let us imagine that, in some details, the outlines of the biblical story fit that independently recon- structed Hellenistic period. This would still not suggest that biblical literature should be assigned to that period. History is written by balancing various alterna- 42. See Jeffrey H.

Thompson's The Bible in History," SJOT 14 (2000), pp. 122-126. 8</page><page sequence="9">The Copenhagen School: The Historiographical Issues tives, and this would be a case where we have only one alternative, as the others have disappeared-we know too little about most of the periods involved to say, for example, whether the narrative of the Joseph story fits the early pre-exilic pe- riod, the late pre-exilic period, the exilic period in Babylon, the exilic period in Is- rael, the Persian period in Israel or in one of the diasporas, or the Hellenistic peri- od. Because of the paucity of evidence, we cannot see in which period it best fits, and therefore it is methodologically incorrect to say that because it may fit the Hel- lenistic period, as opposed to other periods, which are "black boxes,"48 we should date it to the Hellenistic period. A specific example concerning Lemche's Hellenistic dating may be seen in his observation concerning the creation story in Genesis 1: ... we should have a look at the story of the creation of the four elements, light and darkness, water and earth, from an ancient point of view, then it is obvious that God 'creates' these elements as if he wished to be in accordance with some ideas current among Greek natural philosophers from the 6th cen- tury and onwards (p. 171). First of all, the parallels between Genesis 1 and the Greek material adduced by Lemche are vague and general. Furthermore, it is crucial to ask: What other cre- ation myths in antiquity could the biblical authors have known, and with which of these does the Bible have the closest parallels? Most scholars would see certain Mesopotamian parallels as stronger,49 and it is therefore wrong for Lemche to posit a Greek connection without a detailed comparison illustrating why these parallels are better than the Mesopotamian ones. In addition, as noted earlier, Lemche treats most biblical texts as a unified whole, and does not sufficiently distinguish between their ideologies and likely date of composition. For example, most biblicists would agree with his contention that is it is "a fact" that the "tales [in Joshua] have nothing to do with historical circum- stances at the end of the late Bronze Age and in the beginning of the Iron Age" (p. 174). Yet his deduction that the texts were created in the post-exilic period "to cre- ate a racially pure Israelite nation" (p. 174) is quite far-fetched, as so little of Joshua deals with the issue of racial purity, and because there is a huge difference between the presentation of a "pure" Israel in Joshua and clearly post-exilic sentiments such as Ezra 9:2, "the holy seed has become mixed with the nations of the land."50 The methodology of Lemche may be characterized as creeping skepticism, wherein he has become more and more skeptical of the outlines of various bibli- cal narratives.

Lemche begins by doubting the historicity of the period of judges, then moves to the united monarchy, the period of David and Solomon (p. 175), and creeps forward, suggesting, for example, that "the Josiah of 2 Kings need not be a historical figure at all" (p. 179), "as no external source ever men- tions Josiah" (p. 178). However, this criterion used to evaluate the historicity of Josiah is too stringent-modern historians of ancient Israel cannot follow the ad- monition of Deuteronomy 17:6 and 19:15 that two or three witnesses are needed to decide a case. Instead of insisting on direct witnesses, Lemche should consid- er what indirect internal evidence might help evaluate a text's date or historicity. For example, many scholars suggest that the first edition of the Deuteronomistic History, the books from Deuteronomy to Kings, dates from the reign of Josiah. This is reflected in various structural elements in Kings, and in the fact that Josi- ah is idealized even though he dies in battle (see 2 Kings 23:29-30)-this sug- gests that much of the account of Josiah was written before he died.51 Thus it is unlikely that the depiction of his reign is fabricated to the extent suggested by Lemche. Although the suggestion that an original version of the Deuteronomistic History was composed during Josiah's reign is only a theory, this theory is but- tressed by significant evidence, and it is problematic to assert instead that Josiah was created as a reforming king in a much later period. As he moves toward a conclusion, Lemche suggests several points that "may speak in favour of a hellenistic date of the Old Testament" (p. 182): 1) "It is a fact that the history of Israel as told by the Old Testament has little if anything to do with the real historical developments in Palestine until at least the later part of the Hebrew monarchy" (p. 182). This may be true, but does not make the HB into a Hellenistic book. 2) A main theme of Genesis through Joshua is "the more or less utopian idea that a major Jewish kingdom-even empire-should be (re-)established in Palestine"; this idea cannot be early (p. 183). It is, however, uncertain whether this should be characterized as a major theme of the beginning of the Bible. Furthermore, this idea could have developed in the pre-Hellenistic period, as Israel, with an inferiority complex in relation to the great Mesopotamian and Egyptian empires.52 This scenario for certain elements of the biblical foundation myth is at least as plausible as that suggested by Lemche. 51. See the literature cited in Steven L. McKenzie, "Deuteronomistic History," ABD 2. 160- 168; the lengthy defense of the two-editor theory by Mark A.

As noted earlier, detailed evidence is not provided to support this claim. 4) Such Greek texts were unknown to Jews in the Persian period (p. 184). Since Lemche has not proven his third point, this observation, while likely correct, is irrelevant. Lemche anticipates two of the strongest likely objections to his position, not- ing that scholars would feel that too much diverse literature is being pushed into a single period, and that the linguistic evidence might dispute the Hellenistic age (pp. 187-188). The first objection is not serious-following Rainer Alberz and others, ancient Israel may be viewed as a "synchronically complex society," which can, in a single period, incorporate a wide diversity of ideas, as Lemche indeed does suggest. The second objection is more serious. Lemche, like Davies, is heav- ily dependent on an article by Knauf that suggests that biblical Hebrew was an ar- tificial language, and thus what most scholars see as diachronic development re- ally represents synchronic difference.53 This position, however, has been criticized, with good reason, by other linguists.54 As shown most recently by Avi Hurvitz, the "traditional" diachronic model, suggesting that over time Aramaic influenced bib- lical texts such as Chronicles, more satisfactorily and completely explains the ev- idence of the biblical texts that we have.55 This model offers a better explanation than does Lemche's of why Chronicles has so many Aramaisms, whereas the Deuteronomistic History has so few: the Deuteronomistic History predates the Persian Period, in which Aramaic was the lingua franca.56 Lemche's theory also does not explain why Daniel is replete with Greek words like nrr'ianit (3:5, 15),57 a type of musical instrument,58 but these are lacking elsewhere in the supposedly Hellenistic Hebrew Bible. Nor does it explain why Hezekiah's name is spelled in-;PTm in Kings, but inr'prnm in Chronicles, "coincidentally" allowing Kings, which most scholars agree is pre-exilic through exilic, to agree with the name's spelling in cuneiform sources of the very late eighth century, while the Chronicler's spell- 53.

In this connection it is noteworthy that Thompson explicitly admits as a fact that Aramaic became especially important in the post-exilic period (The Mythic Past, pp. 215, 267-268), so we would not be disputing the basic background assumption of this linguistic evidence. 57.

To take an example adduced by Avi Hurvitz, it cannot be proven with certainty that the author of the Deuteronomistic History avoids the Hebrew-Aramaic term max, "letter," because he didn't know it, and thus naturally used lno, "scroll," instead. However, the model which suggests that sections of the Bible are written and pre- served in pre-exilic Hebrew is much more compelling, suggesting that the Bible cannot be a Hellenistic book. In sum, although Lemche's suggestions are not absolutely impossible, the evidence he ignores suggests that they are unlikely. The parallels he draws between the Bible and Hellenism are weak and schematic. That we know something about Hellenism, and that we can easily situate texts there on relatively broad thematic grounds, does not mean that most biblical texts originated there. Finally, big the- ories must be able to incorporate small pieces of evidence, and the model of Lem- che is extremely unlikely given the many small pieces of evidence that he dis- misses in a summary fashion or ignores. Thus, this seminal article does not prove that the OT is a Hellenistic book. Lemche's book, The Israelites in History and Tradition, has the same strengths and weaknesses as the shorter article. His claim that "To assume the historicity of a biblical narrative in advance is unscholarly.. ." (p. 30) is fundamentally sound, as is his observation that most "modern scholars, in spite of the sophistication of their biblical studies, were entangled in a network of biblical concepts and ideas. Only to a certain point have they been able to liberate themselves from the pres- sure of the biblical tradition" (p. 133). He is correct in chastising most historians for "the usual habit of paraphrasing the biblical text" (p. 163) and in presuming that "everything must be defended as long as possible" (p. 151). He is also correct to note that we may not simply convert biblical stories into modern historiography by shifting from divine to human causality (p. 151). To the extent that this book may further the adoption of these principles by the mainstream, it should be ap- plauded. 59. This point concerning the spelling of Hezekiah's name was pointed out by Nadav Na'aman during the International Meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature in Finland in 2000. On the spelling in the scrolls, see Eduard Yechezkel Kutscher, The Language and Linguistic Background of the Isaiah Scroll (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1959; Hebrew), pp. 78-79; in English, Edward Yechezkel Kutscher, The Language and Linguistic Background of the Isaiah Scroll (1QIsaa) (Leiden: Brill, 1974), pp. 104-106. 60.

Much of this has to do with the very narrow stric- tures he uses for reconstructing the Israelites in history. For example, in his inves- tigation of the archaeological evidence he is very narrow-he does not analyze, for example, certain artifacts that might bear on this issue, such as the many seals, signet rings and bullae.61 His bar of proof is too high; it is unclear what type of evidence might have convinced him of a separate Israelite ethnic identity. For reconstructing his history of "real" Israel, Lemche often stresses the sig- nificance of primary, ancient sources discovered in situ versus secondary sources, like the Bible. These primary sources are outlined and analyzed carefully in the chapter "Israel in Contemporary Historical Documents from the Ancient Near East" (pp. 35-64). The paucity of references itself is significant, suggesting the relative insignificance of Israel in the eyes of its contemporaries, marking a sharp contrast between internal and external perceptions of Israel. For methodological reasons, he interprets these inscriptions as if the Bible did not exist, so that the Israel of histo- ry is not tainted by the Israel of tradition. Lemche ignores the possibility, even the strong likelihood, that in places the Bible does reflect relatively accurate informa- tion about the pre-exilic period that deserves to be correlated with archaeological finds. For example, Lemche nowhere explores the implications of the fact that all the kings of Israel mentioned in Assyrian and Babylonian inscriptions are also men- tioned in Kings62--this has some bearing on the value of (parts of) Kings as a his- torical source. Nor does he discuss the ways in which 2 Kings 18:13-16 agrees with the Assyrian account of Sennacherib's third campaign, and the fact that other verses like 18:15-16, about Hezekiah paying Assyria from temple and treasury funds, may be found elsewhere in the Bible, suggesting the strong likelihood that the Bible, a secondary source, in places preserves archival material.63 This neglect skews his perception of the Bible as a relevant source for the history of ancient Israel. Lemche's critique of the value of Kings as a historical source might be seen as a reasonable extension of the Copenhagen School's much earlier critique of the patriarchal narrative and the period of judges, yet Lemche does not take into ac- count that much of the material in Kings seems to be different in kind from the 61.

As noted by Nadav Na'aman,64 the house built concerning the lack of historicity of the patriarchs was ultimately accepted by scholars because of an impressive list of anachronisms assembled in Genesis by Thompson and others. No similar list exists for Kings. This does not mean, of course, that Kings is historical and contemporaneous with the events it depicts, and may be used uncritically as a historical source, as some pre-Copenhagen School scholars might have done--verisimilitude need not imply historical truth. How- ever, given that Kings lacks anachronisms, largely lacks the signs of Late Biblical Hebrew, has signs that it incorporates archival material, and some of the kings mentioned in it are confirmed by Mesopotamian sources, it seems inappropriate to view it as a secondary source of little value and to treat it like Genesis or Judges. Additionally, Lemche's chapter "Israel in Contemporary Historical Docu- ments from the Ancient Near East" is overly eager to show that archaeological ma- terial that might fit the Bible could not possibly do so. Sometimes this is reason- able, as in the observation that the Siloam inscription65 does not mention Hezekiah, thus it cannot be simplistically used to confirm the Bible's accounts of Hezekiah's tunnel in 2 Chronicles 32:30 (p. 47). However, Lemche's suggestion that the prominence of Omri rather than Ahab in the Mesha inscription suggests that Omri was "the apical founder of the kingdom of Israel" (p. 45) reaches well beyond the evidence, especially given that "Ahab the Israelite" is mentioned in the monolith inscription of Shalmaneser III.66 Lemche's skepticism concerning the mentioning of King David in the Tel Dan inscription is not unique.67 The inter- pretation of "nrmn in that inscription as the Davidic dynasty is the most reason- able interpretation, especially after additional pieces of this inscription were found. Lemche's proposal that the inscription is a likely forgery, and has been im- properly joined by the Israel Museum, where "the joint is presented as a fact and covered with a 'protective' plaster" (p. 150, n. 17), is absurd. The many protests by Lemche and others concerning this inscription and its interpretation recall the bad joke concerning the individual who is confronted by a friend, asking why he didn't return a watch he had borrowed. He answers: I never borrowed it; I returned it and you misplaced it; it is the very watch you are wearing. Lemche similarly says about this inscription: it doesn't refer to David; it is not a single inscription anyway; it might be a forgery. This type of overly skeptical attitude typifies much of the analysis of this crucial chapter,68 and only by discounting so much biblical inter- 64.

The Copenhagen School is often incorrectly stereotyped as totally destruc- tive. Especially in the chapter "The People of God" (pp. 86-132), Lemche is in- terested in describing what the Bible is, noting: "Instead of a report on what real- ly happened in Palestine in the Bronze through Iron Ages in antiquity, the history writers re-created the past as a tragic drama about Israel, as being under the curse, and at the same time respectively the blessing of God" (p. 130). This is too flat a description of the Bible, ignoring its richness and variegation. It is overly simplis- tic to say that "every part of the history is seen and should be seen from this per- spective" (ibid.). A counter-hypothesis might see the Bible as a more complex work, from various periods, reflecting various degrees of historicity, and having a multiplicity of purposes, one of which might be depicting an Israel simultaneous- ly under blessing and curse. Thompson's The Mythic Past is very similar to Lemche's recent book. Like Lemche, Thompson considers the Bible to be "secondary evidence," "known to us first from the Hellenistic period" (p. 8). He is generally skeptical of reconstruct- ing early Israelite history; concerning the tenth century, he states: "One cannot speak historically of a state without a population. Nor can one speak of a capital without a town. Stories are not enough" (p. 165). He too is critical of the inter- pretations of the Tel Dan inscription that find mention of a real King David (pp. 203 -205). At places, his rhetoric is more strident or sarcastic than Lemche's. For example, he compares the Maccabees to the Taliban (p. 199 and elsewhere),69 and concerning the book of Kings' suggestion that there are two kings named Jer- oboam, he quips "What harm an extra Jeroboam?" (p. 23) Thompson goes beyond Lemche, suggesting that we must seek a Greco- Roman background for the Hebrew Bible: "Texts do not give direct evidence for the construction of a history of any world of the past asserted by their authors, but rather for the history and perspective of the author's own world as implied in the texts' projections. This world is rather Greco-Roman than Hellenistic" (p. 254). In terms of specifics, he suggests that "It was Antiochus IV of Syria who was the Ahab of history" (p. 208) and "The stories, for instance, of the building of the temple by David or Solomon, Cyrus or Nehemiah (and the mirroring of these sto- ries in the ark and tent of the wilderness wanderings and in the altars built by the patriarchs), were narratives that established a pattern of fitness and propriety sur- rounding the restoration of temple services in 164 BCE" (p. 209). As noted earli- er, for linguistic reasons, it is difficult to believe that these narratives were com- posed at such a late period. In addition, Thompson does not adduce the type of detailed proof needed, noting for example, very specific ways in which Ahab mir- rors Antiochus, or how the various temple episodes reflected the events of 164 BCE. In fact, if the structures of David, Solomon, Cyrus, Nehemiah, and the tent ture in Context: Essays on the Comparative Method, eds. Carl D. Evans et al.

In fairness it must be noted that his book was published before the events of 9/11/01. 15</page><page sequence="16">Marc Brettler of the wilderness all mirror the temple of 164, why are these structures depicted so differently? Thompson also suggests that "If we wish to define the community that is implicit in the creation of a book like the Bible's Psalter, it helps to turn again to the Dead Sea scrolls" (p. 239). This is troubling on several grounds. The language of the Psalter and that of the hodayot, a genre of prayers found at Qum- ran, is quite different, as is their theology-the type of dualism and religious determinism found throughout the hodayot is largely absent from the psalms.70 Furthermore, the Psalter itself contains relatively clear internal indications that it developed over time, and should be studied as such-this is evident from both the sophisticated editorial work completed by Gerald H. Wilson,"7 but also from the simple fact that Psalm 72 ends with the words ,wl 1 -rntr mnrin i, "the prayers of David son of Jesse have ended." It would seem that such evidence, like other evidence for editions of the Deuteronomistic History, or strata within the Pentateuch, is largely ignored by the Copenhagen School because it is conjectural. But such theories about the editing of Psalms are strong theories, with great explanative power; they have garnered general scholarly assent and should not be totally ignored. Thompson, like Lem- che, is searching for absolute certainty. He claims that "judgments that events are plausible, likely, or even probable are hardly ever good tools for an historian. His- tory doesn't require the plausible. It requires evidence" (p. 229). But is his long, detailed, and interesting reconstruction of ancient near eastern history, based on archaeology and evidence of climate change (pp. 103-225) any less conjectural than many of the theories developed concerning biblical texts and their develop- ment? Rather than looking for the absolutes insisted upon by the Copenhagen School, other scholars are willing to speak of "tentative history,"72 Or to use meth- ods such as "triangulation"73 from various sources to recreate history. In the words of Lester Grabbe, "If we accept only what we can be absolutely certain about, we might as well give up the historical task ab initio because extremely little falls in that category."74 Similar observations have been made by classicists concerning the reconstruction of Greek and Roman history.75 This book by Thompson, like Lemche's Ancient Israel, presents itself as pos- itive, as an exploration of how the Hebrew Bible should be interpreted as a con- structive myth of Greco-Roman Judaism: 70.

The writers of the Bible are surprisingly re- alistic and truthful. In their own terms-which are not the terms of critical historical scholarship-they express themselves well about the world they know ... . They write however with ideas, thoughts and images, metaphors and motifs, perspectives and goals that are quite at a tangent to those of the present day (p. 104). It does this by "using old traditions about the past as parables" (p. 189) since "It is a tool of philosophy and moral instruction" (p. 99). Depending on how "myth" is understood, Thompson may be correct. However, he ignores the possibility that even a mythological text that is not primarily interested in giving us the real past may, at points, when analyzed closely, offer us useful information about this past. In addition, like Lemche's reading, Thompson's mythological reading is relatively flat and monochromatic because the historical and ideological depth that tra- ditional biblical scholarship sees in these texts is lost in Thompson's model of a Greco-Roman composition. Thompson admits that sometimes the biblical authors used "old traditions" (p. 189) or included "surviving fragments of the past" (p. 295), but he shows lit- tle interest in uncovering which specific fragments these might be. This is because he deals with large blocks of material as wholes, rather than as comprised of ma- terial with a long and complicated history. For example, in his treatment of Kings as a source, he points out the historically problematic treatment of Elijah and Jon- ah (p. 59). However, it is generally conceded that the Elijah material is secondary to the book, and either was incorporated as a whole into the book by the Deuteron- omistic Historian,76 or is a late addition to the book;77 in either case, it does not bear on the historiographical nature of the rest of Kings. Thompson's discussion of Jonah is confusing-he mixes up the Jonah who is swallowed by the big fish of the book of Jonah with the short notice of "Jonah son of Amittai" found in 2 Kings 14:25. What bearing does the Jonah story, which is marked as fanciful,78 and found in a separate book, have on the historicity of Kings, which mentions the same prophet? Does the existence of tall tales about certain American presidents suggest that any source that mentions these individuals is ahistorical? Thompson's reconstructions of the real history of Israel are often as prob- lematic as those he critiques. For example, he suggests: "There is also evidence of a few minor deities such as Azazel in the scapegoat ritual of Leviticus 16 and Lilith, the goddess of the night and mother of Cain" (p. 172). Since the book is popular, and is thus not extensively footnoted, it may be assumed that the reference to Lilith is based on Isaiah 34:14, "Wildcats shall meet hyenas, Goat-demons shall greet each other; There too the lilith shall repose And find herself a resting place" (NJPS). This verse certainly does not suggest the existence in the states of Judah 76. Those who advocate this position are discussed in Steven L. McKenzie, The Trouble With Kings: The Composition of the Books of Kings in the Deuteronomistic History (VTSup 42; Leiden: Brill, 1991), p. 84. 77. McKenzie, The Trouble With Kings, pp. 81-100. 78. See Brettler, The Creation of History, pp. 47 and 174, n. 170. 17</page><page sequence="18">Marc Brettler and Israel of "Lilith, the goddess of the night and mother of Cain." First of all, the dating of material in all of Isaiah is now hotly contested, as there is an increasing tendency to see the mark of the exilic Deutero-Isaiah on greater and greater por- tions of the book.79 Secondly, on what basis may Lilith of this verse with certain- ty be equated with the Mesopotamian deity of the same name?80 Third, though there is a post-biblical tradition that Lilith was Adam's first wife, there is no tradi- tion that disputes the biblical text, and states that she, rather than Eve, was the mother of Cain. Finally, Lilith is not explicitly identified as Adam's first wife un- til the Alphabet of Ben-Sirah, a post-Talmudic work.81 While late works may sometimes preserve much earlier traditions, it is doubtful that here earlier Judaean and Israelite practices have been preserved accurately for more than a millennium. A similar carelessness is evident elsewhere in this work, particularly in Thompson's treatment of certain Hebrew texts. This might suggest that this book's focus on archaeology, ancient near eastern history, general issues like the impact of climatic change, and broad metaphorical reading of the biblical text is caused by Thompson's lack of precise engagement with the Hebrew text. Such an engagement would surely suggest problems with the rather flat picture he presents of the Bible as a myth as a synchronic, Greco-Roman text. For example, Thompson suggests that the name Noah refers to "relief" and "reconciliation," and connects these both to "nah" (p. 25); however, the root for "relief" in Gen 5:29 is nnr. In discussing the biblical etymology of txw, Israel, with a sin, Thompson improperly connects it to "u', with a shin (p. 27). Following a common error, he mistranslates u~rwn of the prologue of Job as "Satan" (p. 172), even though the presence of the definite arti- cle there militates against this translation,82 and suggests that Satan per se did not exist in the world-view of Job's author. He has, according to a note on p. 3, trans- lated biblical texts himself; it is thus unclear how he might render nmarn of Joshua 1:8 as "love" (p. 241)-it means "to read in an undertone." The same issue is seen in his translation of Psalm 1:2, b ti i nrar r',rinnixn rnirr ninna nt ' as "but is one who has his joy on Yahweh's torah; who loves Yahweh's torah and stud- ies it day and night" (p. 224) and "He rejoices in Yahweh's torah and loves the tra- dition day and night" (p. 229). Although the exact meaning of the rare root vx is uncertain, his translation of Micah 6:8, 1nrTx t ni varnm as "Keep awake and walk with your God" (p. 69), is very unlikely. He is also careless in his reference to the evidence that is, and is not, found in the Bible, speaking, for example, of "the Elohe Shamayim that we find in Isaiah" (p. 318); this phrase is never found in that book. These errors, taken together, reflect on Thompson as a reader and in- terpreter of biblical texts. 79. See H. G. M.

He translates Isaiah 40:3, as "A voice cries in the wilderness: prepare Yahweh's path; make straight the way of God through the desert" (p. 219), which fits the NT de- piction of John the Baptist in all four gospels,83 rather than the usual translation of "A voice rings out: "Clear in the desert a road for the LORD! Level in the wilder- ness a highway for our God!" (so NJPS). This may hint at a wider Christian agen- da. Through his re-dating of the Hebrew Bible, the Old Testament is brought clos- er and closer to the New, and significant continuity is seen between the two. This is the opposite of the type of typical Protestant supersessionism, where significant discontinuities are found between the Old and New Testaments, and thus the Old is superseded by the New; instead, the Old becomes subsumed into the New. This is illustrated by the many cases where the New Testament is adduced to illustrate how the Old Testament functions as a myth. Lemche's suggestion that the OT be understood in terms of Israel under blessing and curse,84 a theme which is quite reminiscent of Galatians 3:13-14, likely also reflects a reading of the Hebrew Bible through a Christian lens. Given that both Lemche and Thompson teach in a Faculty of Theology that is very Christian-centered in terms of its offerings, their Christian bent is not entirely surprising. Given that both Thompson and Lemche suggest a Hellenistic or Greco- Roman date for much of the Bible, it is appropriate to tie these thoughts together with an analogy from that world concerning the use of Homer in reconstructing the Greek past.85 This analogy is appropriate-there certainly was a stage of Homeric fundamentalism or romanticism; this even motivated the excavation of Troy,86 which has close parallels to the use and abuse of biblical/Syro-Palestin- ian archaeology. The earliest complete manuscript of Homer dates from the early tenth century CE,87 which, just as with the Bible, is many centuries after its puta- tive date of composition. Finally, scholars continue to debate issues of historicity in The Iliad and The Odyssey. Some of the conclusions of contemporary Homeric scholarship are re- markably like those of the Copenhagen School. Hans Giinter Jansen, writing in Jack Sasson's Civilizations of the Ancient Near East, notes that: "It must be stat- ed clearly: an evolution of the epic with respect to its potential historical content 83. Matt 3:3; Mark 1:3; Luke 3:4-6; John 1:23. 84. See p. 15. 85. By concluding with this example from Homer, I do not mean to suggest that Greek, rather than ancient near eastern texts, should be our primary point of comparison; I merely want to meet the Copenhagen School on its own terms. In contrast, for example, to John Van Seters' In Search of His- tory, the Copenhagen School rarely uses comparative evidence from the ancient Near East to draw its analogies; yet, as noted, among others, by Hans M. Barstad, "The Strange Fear of the Bible: Some Re- flections on the 'Bibliophobia' in Recent Ancient Israelite Historiographies," in Leading Captivity Cap- tive, ed. Lester L. Grabbe, pp. 120-127, a reasonable working hypothesis is that the Bible should be viewed as an ancient near eastern text! 86. See the summary in Hans Giinter Jansen, "Troy: Legend and Reality," in Civilizations of the Ancient Near East, ed. Jack M. Sasson (New York: Scribner's, 1995), 2.1121-34. 87. This is the Ms. Venetus Marcianus 454, also called Venetus A; see Michale Haslam, "Home- ric Papyri and the Transmission of the Text" in A New Companion to Homer, eds.

Yet most classicists trace the development of The Iliad and The Odyssey, and use evidence to discern the prehistory of these epics.89 Classicists generally believe that the final stage has not obliterated all traces of earlier di- alects;90 indeed, Homer as we now have it incorporates many working features of non-Ionic dialects involved in the earlier stages of the evolution of Homeric dic- tion. Nor has the final work recast all of its earlier traditions into Iron Age pat- terns.91 For example, a reference to the "silver-studded sword" in Iliad 14.405 is typically seen as fitting a sixteenth- and fifteenth-century milieu.92 Furthermore, although these two great works are considered myths, most classicists would not a priori discount their value for reconstructing some aspects of ancient civiliza- tion that predate the time of the final "composition" of these works.93 Thus, the contemporary understanding of Homer negates the three main claims of the Co- penhagen School: (1) works must be read only in terms of their final date of crys- tallization; (2) linguistic and internal evidence may not be used for discerning lay- ers within a text; (3) mythological texts may not be used for recreating ancient history since the genres of myth and history are mutually exclusive. This analogy also suggests that those who oppose the methods of the Copenhagen School should not be automatically categorized as fundamentalists or neo-Albrightians, but may well be working from a different notion of how ancient history is created, a notion that is well-accepted within the world of the study of classical antiquity. In sum, the sentiments of Thompson and Lemche that "We can say now with considerable confidence that the Bible is not a history of anyone's past"94 are ex- 88. Jansen, "Troy: Legend and Reality," 2.1131. 89. For one such reconstruction of these stages, see Gregory Nagy, Poetry as Performance: Homer and Beyond (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), pp. 107-206, and a summary in Gregory Nagy, Homeric Questions (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1996), p. 42. 90. Geoffrey Horrocks, "Homer's Dialects," A New Companion to Homer, pp. 193-217. I cite Horrocks in particular, since he tends to be a minimalist concerning the retention of pre-Ionic elements in Homer. 91. The literature on this is immense; see for example, E. S. Sherratt, "'Reading the Texts': Ar- chaeology and the Homeric Question," Antiquity 64 (1990), pp. 7-24; Jan Pal Crielaard, "Homer, His- tory and Archaeology: Some Remarks on the Date of the Homeric World," in Homeric Questions, ed. Jan Paul Crielaard (Amsterdam: J. C. Gieban, 1995), pp. 201-288; and John Bennet, "Homer and the Bronze Age," in A New Companion to Homer, pp. 511-533. The summary in Martin Litchfield West, "Homer," in Oxford Classical Dictionary, ed. Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth (third edition; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996), p. 719 is quite apposite: "Only fossilized memories of the Mycenean age survive in his work"-but they do survive! 92. Jansen, p. 1131. For an additional example where the Iliad reflects second millennium prac- tices, see R. Janko, The Iliad: A Commentary (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), 4.213 on Iliad 14.402-408. 93. The composition of the Homeric epic poems may be even more complicated than that of biblical texts; if anything, this strengthens my analogy. 94. Thompson, The Mythic Past, p. xv. 20</page><page sequence="21">The Copenhagen School: The Historiographical Issues aggerated. Yes, the Bible may be seen as a literary composition,95 but the distinc- tion between history and literature, which has become so fundamental to the study of biblical texts, is a misplaced distinction.96 Certainly, both Lemche and Thomp- son are correct that the Bible is fundamentally a myth, and does not have interest in the real past as its focal point; yet, there are places where the Bible likely re- flects antiquarian interests,97 and even a myth that is not interested in the past may, in places, accurately depict the past. Finally, the premise of the Copenhagen School, that the Bible is a Hellenistic book, is doubly faulty: it ignores the evidence of linguistic dating of biblical texts, and it treats the Bible as a monolith. Thompson was correct when he noted that "Writing is an exercise of influ- ence and persuasion" (p. 375). Unfortunately, general historical method suggests that the approach of the Copenhagen School, especially as it relates to the late date of the Bible and the total ahistoricity of the text are not persuasive. A school that concentrates on the need to "expand on our ignorance"98 ultimately becomes tire- some, as it is more useful to expend scholarly energy on what we can say. Marc Brettler Brandeis University Waltham, Massachusetts 95. For the problems with using the term "literary" for the Bible, see The Creation of History, pp. 14-17. 96. It has its origin in modern critical scholarship with Johan Huizinga, "A Definition of the Concept of History," in Philosophy and History: Essays Presented to Ernst Cassirer, eds. Raymond Klibansky and H. J. Paton (Gloucester, MA: Peter Smith, 1975), pp. 1-10. Huizinga's essay is critiqued in Brettler, The Creation of History, p. 11. 97. This is the main point of Baruch Halpern, The First Historians: The Hebrew Bible and His- tory (San Francisco, CA; Harper and Row, 1988). Even though he exaggerates the extent of these "an- tiquarian interests," he does show their presence. 98. Thomas L.
