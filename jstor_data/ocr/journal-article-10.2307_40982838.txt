If one turns from the introduction to the actual catalog, one can find entries for Elijah Levita's Bove buch, a romance printed in the sixteenth century at an uncertain location; Benedict Spinoza's Trac- tatus theologico politicus, printed anonymously in 1670; and Menachem Azariah da Fano's manuscripts from the late sixteenth century.2 And in an entry that seems straight out of Borges, Steinschneider included a listing of his own writings.3 Neither Levita's Yiddish romance, nor Spinoza's Latin philosophical treatise, nor Da Fano's discussions of Kabbalah in manuscript, nor Steinschneider's own largely German writings strictly fall under the category of a printed Hebrew book. A fundamental gap exists between the title of the catalog - Hebrew books in the Bodleian Library - and its actual contents, which are works that pertain to Jewish literature. In composing his catalog, one of the greatest bibliographic 1 . Moritz Steinschneider, Catalogus Librorum Hebraeorum in Bibliotheca Bodleiana (Berlin: Ad.

These are variations on a fundamental question that was asked in the late eighteenth century by none other than Immanuel Kant: "What is a book?" Kant asked in the midst of a discussion on piracy in The Metaphysics of Morals. He pro- ceeded to answer as follows: "A book is a writing, which represents a discourse that someone delivers to the public by visible linguistic signs."4 I want to examine how Kant's definition applies to one Jewish book from the early modern period- a book many will agree was of some consequence for the history of the Jews - Joseph Karo's Shulhan 'arukh. In doing so, I outline some areas of possible inquiry into the histories of Jewish books between the invention of printing and the onset of political emancipation. No other book composed in the early modern period had as profound and lasting an impact on Jewish life as Karo's. The Shulhan 'arukh ("The Prepared Table" or "The Ordered Table") eventually became the standard code of Jewish law throughout Europe and the Mediterranean world. With few exceptions, nearly every Jewish com- munity had accepted it as authoritative within generations of its initial publication. The Shulhan 'arukh as a "writing" delivered to the Jewish public by Joseph Karo had a truly transformative impact upon Jewish life. In this way one can speak of Karo's work as a discourse, as an idea. The book served scholars as a reference work and lit- erate lay people as a manual of Jewish law. It stimulated commentary and controversy, resistance and cooptation. One is hard pressed to find another book written in the early modern period thatendured as long as the Shulhan 'arukh.5 And yet, the Shulhan 'arukh was not a single book. In answering his ques- tion, Kant pointed to the dual nature of the book: Not only is a book an idea or a discourse, but it is also "a corporeal artifact, opus mechanicum, that can be repro- duced."6 As a material object, or rather as a set of material objects, the early modern editions of the Shulhan 'arukh point to several crucial aspects of its history. The work was composed by Karo in Safed, a center, if not the center, of Jewish culture for much of the sixteenth century.7 But the Shulhan 'arukh did not take the material form of a printed book in Safed; it first appeared in print in Venice at the Bragadin press in 1564-1565. 8 4.

The location and date are both of enormous significance, as was the material form the book actually took. Venice was the capital of Hebrew printing for much of the sixteenth century. So much of early modern Jewish culture took material form there: The cultural renaissance in Safed appeared in print at presses in Venice and elsewhere in northern Italy; these same printing houses were meeting places for Jews, converts, Catholics, and Protestants; Hebrew printing in Venice and its environs had a dramatic impact upon the publication of Yiddish texts; and the Bible and the Talmud became printed books in Venice in the first half of the sixteenth century.9 It is not an accident that Karo's work, intended to serve as a standard law code for all Jews, appeared there. The date is also of considerable consequence. After the burning of the Talmud in 1553 and a bitter feud between the two most important printers of Hebrew, the pro- duction of Hebrew books in Venice had ceased.10 With its resumption in 1564, a new regime of censorship was imposed upon it, and the Talmud could not appear in print.11 Karo's Shulhan 'arukh was one of the first texts to appear under this new regime. The complications posed by the Shulhan 'arukh as a set of material objects do not stop there. The earlier editions were addressed to young men. They were issued in various sizes, some of which could be carried around with ease, and were designed to be used anywhere, not only in the synagogue or in the study hall. Like the editions of the Greek and Latin classics that had appeared at Aldus Manutius' press in Venice earlier in the century, the work contained a preface but offered little commentary.12 Furthermore, in some printings Karo's Shulhan 'arukh was not one book, but four, as each volume of Jacob ben Asher's Tur to which it served as a précis was packaged as its own volume. The early editions hardly looked or felt like the weighty law code it would even- tually become. 9.

Between its first printing in 1564 and the end of the sixteenth century, no fewer than seventeen editions appeared in print, the majority of them in Venice, as well as one in Salonika, and six in Krakow.13 A number of these editions appeared before Karo's death in 1575, and the Shulhan 'arukh was one of the first Hebrew books to be reprinted in the lifetime of its author. Yet it is safe to say that the Shulhan 'arukh would not have had its staying power as a work of enormous cultural authority had it not become an entirely different text when it appeared in Krakow in 1578-1580 with the glosses of Moses Isseries.14 Isseries, one of the towering figures of early modern Polish Jewish life, had been at work on his own law code for some time when he learned of Karo's project. Rather than compete, he decided to append his own glosses with what he claimed were the Ashkenazic customs and practices.15 In this edition of the Shulhan 'arukh, one finds a central dynamic of early modern Jewish history on the pages of a printed book: the coexistence, competition, and tension between Ashkenazim and Sephardim. Indeed, the very categories of Ash- kenazic and Sephardic are thrown into relief by the reactions to Isserles's glosses. Thus Hayim ben Bezalel, brother of the famed Maharal, had little patience for Isserles' attempt to summarize all of Ashkenazic tradition in his glosses and took it as a form of cultural imperialism and an erasure of difference among Ash- kenazic and Polish practices from different regions.16 But Isserles' glosses signaled far more than simply the "Ashkenization" of a Sephardic text;17 they also heralded the beginning of an extensive commentary tra- dition that would grow up around Karo's code, radically transforming its purpose and its material form. In the ensuing centuries, Joshua Falk, Shabbateai (or Sab- batai) ha-Kohen, Abraham Gombiner, Israel Meir ha-Kohen, and many others would eventually add their commentaries to all or part of the Shulhan 'arukh. In so doing, they transformed the text from a short compendium accessible to anyone with a basic knowledge of Hebrew into one that required instruction and supervision. The book was also transformed in its material form. Already in the sixteenth century, the Shulhan 'arukh had changed from a being a book that 13.

However, he clearly articulated his opposition to the category of "Ashke- naz" as one that had obliterated any variation in custom among Jews who hailed from distinct geo- graphic areas. See principle 9, Hayim ben Bezalel, Vikuah mayim hayim (Amsterdam, 1711), 6a. On this figure, see Reiner, "The Ashkenazi Elite at the Beginning of the Modern Era," 86 n. 2. 17.

The commentary tradition that surrounded its text would soon come to dwarf Karo 's own work. This extensive commentary tradition had a further effect of considerable import: By and large, the commentaries to Karo's Shulhan 'arukh that appeared on the printed page were written by Ashkenazic rabbis; the Sephardic commen- taries did not usually appear alongside the text. In this intensified Ashkenization of a Sephardic text, one can find a larger trace of one of the central shifts from the early modern to the modern in Jewish history, a shift that has parallels in the transformation of Lurianic Kabbalah by the founders of Hasidism in the eight- eenth century and one that is undergirded by a massive demographic transform- ation of Jewish populations in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. When Karo wrote the Shulhan 'arukh, the Jews of the Ottoman Empire were among the largest Jewish communities in the early modern world. When Gombiner wrote his commentary a century later, this demographic profile was beginning to change; and when Israel Meir ha-Kohen composed his in the nineteenth century, the Jews of the Levant were but a small minority of the world's Jewish population. This brief sketch of the history of the Shulhan 'arukh indicates how compli- cated the history of one early modern Jewish book can be. A developing subfield within the study of the early modern world, the history of the book as a set of methods has the potential to open up several lines of inquiry into the study of the early modern Jewish past. Below is a rapid survey of a few areas. Manuscript and Print In his Print, Manuscript, and the Search for Order, David McKitterick characterizes the relationship between print and manuscript in the early modern period as a long divorce.18 For Jews, one might posit that the divorce was never finalized: The composition of texts in manuscript never disappeared from Jewish culture. The writing of a Torah scroll, the composition of a mezuzah, and other such sacred objects continues uninterrupted. Even beyond these basic ritual functions, manuscript writing continued to play a crucial role in Jewish societies for centuries after the invention of printing, and manuscripts continue to exist in persistent tension with printed books. One could write an entire work on manuscript culture among early modern Jewry along the lines of Brian Richardson's recent study.19 Such a book would unearth a range of intellectual activities that have either been studied in isolation from one another or not studied at all. Here too the history of the Shulhan 'arukh proves particularly instructive. In his discussion of the Ashkenazic tradition of glossing the Shulhan 'arukh, Elchanan Reiner concluded: "The Ashkenazi halakhic book at 18.

In certain respects it was a kind of printed manuscript, that is, a text which, in the way it took shape, rejected the new communicative values of print culture and created a text with esoteric com- ponents, thus protecting its elitist position."20 Reiner's concept of a "printed manuscript" neatly dissolves the distinction between print and manuscript so beloved by historians fixated on rupture. It should also serve as the point of depar- ture for the study of several aspects of early modern Jewish culture: the spread of kabbalistic books, the development of Jewish reference works, the study of mar- ginal annotations, and the history of collections to name only a few. Editing There has been a flurry of studies on early modern editing. Paolo Trovato and Brian Richardson have explored the range of roles played by editors and bookmen in the formation of Italian literary culture in the Renaissance.21 Anne Goldgar has examined the editorial entrepreneurs who worked in the Netherlands more than a century later.22 Scholarship on Jewish editors or the editing of Jewish texts in the early modern period has lagged behind.23 The very terms for an editor have yet to be studied with any systematic rigor, much less examined in a social context. A study of these known but largely obscure figures might reveal powerful continuities and disruptions between these, and later Jewish publicists in the modern period. The editing of the multiple early modern editions of the Shulhan 'arukh might potentially serve as a case study for how to examine a single text in multiple contexts: editing the same book in Venice, Krakow, and Sal- onika was a different editorial task. Censorship Recent work on early modern censorship by Amnon Raz-Krakotzkin and others has used the methods employed by historians of the book to reframe one of the central sites of interactions between Jews and Catholics in early modern Italy.24 Their work, and Raz-Krakotzkin's study in particular, has demonstrated 20.

Yet there is much that historians still do not know about the history of censorship in the early modern world. Basic biblio- graphic tools such as a census of all the printed books that contain censor marks by even the most prominent of censors, Domenico Gerosolimitano, have yet to be created. In this instance, the question has at least been posed when it comes to the Shulhan 'arukh. Reception History Historians of the Jews have begun to study the reception of classical and medieval texts in the early modern and modern period. Adam Shear's recent book on the Kuzari, Boaz Huss's on the Zohar, and work on Spinoza by Allan Nadler and Daniel Schwartz have explored three prominent texts or figures and their afterlives.25 Elchanan Reiner and Joseph Davis have charted the way toward a reception history of the Shulhan 'arukh; their studies should serve as a model for the unwritten history of Karo's code among the early modern and modern Sephardic rabbinate. Yet no scholar has taken on the Herculean task of writing a history of the early modern Hebrew Bible along the lines of Debora Shuger's study of the Bible in the Renaissance or Jonathan Sheehan's study of the Bible in the Enlightenment.26 The same can be said of the Mishnah, the Talmud, and Midrash.

Such work has the potential to challenge a range of historiographie commonplaces about the origins of Jewish scholarship in the nineteenth century. In this instance we lack a history of the consumption of the Shulhan 'arukh. Who owned the book or books? Which editions did they possess? How many people had access to a given copy of the work? Answers to such questions might complement and com- plicate the reception histories provided by Reiner and Davis. Censorship, reception history, libraries, editing, and manuscript and print - these are only a few of the numerous areas where the methods employed by histor- ians of the book have the potential to open fields inquiry for scholars of the early modern Jewish past. But there are many others: the relationship between reading and writing, the history of correspondence and letters, the development of period- icals and reference works, and the relationships between Hebrew and vernacular literatures. To return to Kant: In the midst of his discussion of piracy, Kant posited an opposition between the book as a discourse or idea and the book as a material object. Of course, books were also many other things. They were 28. See Sifriyot ve-osfei sefarim, ed. Yosef Kaplan and Moshe Sluhovsky (Jerusalem: Zalman Shazar Center, 2006).
