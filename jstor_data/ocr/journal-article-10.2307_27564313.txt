<plain_text><page sequence="1">Barbara Hahn. The Jewess Pallas Athena: This Too a Theory of Modernity. Trans. James McFarland. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2005. 233 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000748 Readers of German are no doubt familiar with the impressive body of scho larship on women writers, gender studies, and German-Jewish literature and culture that Barbara Hahn has produced over the last two decades. Hahn, the editor of the writings of Rahel Levin Vamhagen, has done pioneering work on Vamhagen, Hannah Arendt, and so many other German-Jewish women writers and intellectuals. This volume, a translation of Hahn's well-received Die J?din Pallas Athene: Auch eine Theorie der Moderne (Berlin, 2002), delivers the English-speaking world a fine translation of one of Hahn's most important works, a substantial series of essays on the overdetermined category of the "Jewess" as it was experienced and theorized by a staggering lineup of German-Jewish women writers and literary and intellectual elites from the mid eighteenth century through the Holocaust and beyond. Hahn brings together a breathtaking repertoire of thinkers. She looks at well-known women such as Arendt, Vamhagen, Rosa Luxemburg, and Margarete Susman. At the same time, she gives equal due to fascinating and lesser-known figures, such as the nineteenth-century writer Johanna Goldschmidt and Anna Contanze, Countess of Cosel, an eighteenth-century convert to Judaism. Building on archival research, an immense selection of primary sources, and her own vast erudition, Hahn weaves together a rich, dense, and enormously rewarding network of subtle reflec tions on Judaism, gender, and modem culture that promises to be of interest to a wide group of scholars in Jewish studies, cultural studies, and intellectual history. The Jewess Pallas Athena is not a conventional book. Hahn's goal, as she states in her introduction, is not to provide a survey or a linear history of the figure of the Jewess in German culture. She wants to explore, instead, a series of constellations of theoretical reflections on models of culture and their meta phors of exclusion and repression. Hahn succeeds brilliantly at this task, with inci sive analyses that are beautifully written and testify to the power and importance of close reading. There are, of course, numerous figures who are never mentioned, such as the popular nineteenth-century novelist Fanny Lewald, for example, or writers such as Rahel Meyer or Sara Hirsch Guggenheim, whose works appealed primarily to Jewish audiences in the nineteenth century. One also has to wonder about certain other choices, such as why, in her dis cussion of "the politics of difference" around 1800, Hahn pays so much attention 407</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews to a relatively unknown 1791 work by Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Grattenauer rather than focusing on Grattenauer's bestselling antisemitic pamphlets from 1803. But Hahn does cover an enormous array of both major and minor writers, bringing her texts into dialogue with a diverse set of contexts. Her productively eclectic approach to her subject matter, moreover, enables her to produce an extremely far-ranging study that is neatly divided into sixteen short chapters, each of which reads well on its own as a self-contained essay. There is, put simply, no other book in the field that approaches this breadth. In this regard, the fact that Hahn avoids producing a single, overarching historical narrative is perhaps one of the book's strengths. To be sure, social historians of German Jewry schooled in the work of Paula Hyman or Marion Kaplan may find The Jewess Pallas Athena frustrating, as will those looking for a book that stakes out an unequivocal position for itself in debates about modernity and processes of modernization in Jewish history. Hahn does make major contributions to historiography, as, for example, in a powerful chapter that elegantly demystifies what she aptly terms the "myth of the salon." But the overwhelming concern of her study is to trace how literary and intellectual elites reflected on and constructed the realm of culture from the mid-eighteenth century on in their writings. Those open to Hahn's approach will thus find The Jewess Pallas Athena an enormously satisfying and provocative work of literary and cultural criticism. Hahn takes her title from a poem by Paul Celan, in which the phrase "the Jewess Pallas Athena" unsettles the opposition between Judaism and Hellenism and brings these two traditions together in an unconventional way through the figure of the Jewess. In so many of the writers Hahn discusses, the figure of the Jewess Pallas Athena emerges again and again, becoming a productive foil for the sophisticated reflections on culture and acculturation that Hahn teases out of the vast repertoire of texts she has at her disposal. For the most part, translator James McFarland has done a wonderful job of reproducing Hahn's spirited German prose and capturing its elegance. Nevertheless, readers who do not read German will undoubtedly be made uncomfortable by the numerous Germanisms that linger in the text?such as the frequent use of sentence fragments for stylistic punctuation, or the use of terms such as "the preterit" where one might have written "past tense," or "culture-theoretician" where one might have said "theorist of culture" or "cultural theorist." This edition of the text would also have benefited from the inclusion of more in the way of background information on some figures unfamiliar to those in the English-speaking world. All in all, however, these are minor quibbles. This is an important book, and Princeton University Press has done a great service in making it available to a broader public. Jonathan M.
