Cincinnati, OH: Hebrew Union College Press, 2003. 464 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001025 Relatively little research is being done in the area of midrash halakhah. Of the work being done, most of it?for example, the prodigious labors of Menahem Kahana?falls under the rubric of philology. Only a few scholars?most notably Jacob Neusner, Steven Fraade, Daniel Boyar?n, and Moshe Halbertal?have addressed the question of how to understand the project of midrash halakhah. (Jay Harris has helped us understand how the endeavor was viewed by Jews from the medieval period and onward, but this is a separate issue.) Therefore, any attempt to explicate the program of a work of midrash halakhah, such as 172</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Howard Apothaker's, is a welcome addition to the field, however problematic it might be. Apothaker's work consists of three parts: (1) a brief introduction to the pro blems of understanding the program of midrash halakhah collections, such as the Sifra, and an explanation of how he will proceed in his own analysis; (2) an anno tated translation, structural analysis, and summary of Sifra, Dibbura deSinai; and (3) an analysis of the rhetorical formulae, literary structures, and legal traditions of the Sifra, as well as a chapter comparing the forms and goals of the Sifra with those of the Mishnah. The first and third parts are the most useful. Apothaker begins his introduc tion with a useful description of the symbiosis between the exegetical and eisege tical functions of midrash halakhah. He states that "the framers [of the Sifra] seek to certify rabbinic law and culture by the creation of a formal exegetical link from a fixed Scripture, properly interpreted, to a derived proposition; and they seek to validate the formal authority of Scripture by the creation of a formal eisegetical link from a fixed proposition to a ratifying scriptural expression, again properly interpreted" (13). This, and not, as Neusner suggests, "a systematic critique of the Mishnah," is the project of the Sifra. Clearly, the Mishnah-Tosefta and the Sifra share some common concerns and content, but they are pursuing different goals using different formats. In particular, in his comparative study of the legal traditions found in the Mishnah-Tosefta and in the Sifra (378-400), Apothaker shows that some of the legal traditions found in the Mishnah are extensions of laws that are mentioned only in the Sifra. These latter might have been "resected," as Apothaker puts it, into the Sifra, which therefore might still have postdated the Mishnah. This datum certainly allows one to read the Sifra as other than a reactive appraisal of the Mishnah. Apothaker begins the third section of his work with a discussion of the rhe torical formulae used in the Sifra. He classifies these formulae into three broad categories: specifications, meaning that "a scriptural phrase implies a specific proposition or meaning"; ratification, whereby "a scriptural phrase is validated as sufficient" (and just as important and necessary) because it ratifies a specific proposition; and preclusion, which is "a scriptural phrase...validated as necess ary because it precludes an erroneous proposition" (340). Apothaker's essential distinction between specification and ratification/preclusion relates to his earlier discussion of the Sifra's dual goals of finding a scriptural basis for rabbinic tra dition and finding omnisignificance in scripture. The relationship, however, is complex. For example, Apothaker describes the following as "simple ratifica tion": The Sifra inquires about the scriptural basis for a rabbinic tradition (minayin+proposition x) and responds by citing a verse (talmud lomar= scriptural phrase A). Apothaker describes this form as ratification because he regards its function as ratifying the necessity of the verse. However, one could just as well say that its function is to legitimize a rabbinic law by providing it with a scriptural basis. In general, Apothaker does not acknowledge sufficiently the constant interplay between eisegesis and exegesis, on the one hand, and the validation of rabbinic teachings through scripture and of scripture through rabbinic tradition, on the other. 173</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews A brief classification and analysis of the Sifra's literary structures follows. Apothaker concludes that there are no overarching literary structures of significance in the Sifra (377). The final chapter, mentioned earlier, compares the legal traditions found in the Mishnah and Tosefta. Here Apothaker provides us with some of his most interesting findings. First, he demonstrates that "the set of rules in Dibbura deSinai on topics shared with Mishnah-Tosefta can be understood as an independent body of law" (378). But further, Apothaker makes the observation that for some topics, specifically the jubilee year and bondsmanship, there are "tractates" appear ing in the Sifra that do not appear at all in the Mishnah or Tosefta. Additionally, there are many instances of topically relevant rules that appear in the Sifra but do not appear in the Mishnah and Tosefta. These rules sometimes take "mishnaic" form and are sometimes formulated in the forms typical of the Sifra. All of this supports Apothaker's characterization of the Sifra as a project related to the Mishnah and Tosefta but independent from it, substantially as well as formally and axiologically. Furthermore, it weakens many of the arguments put forth by Neusner and Melamed for dating the Sifra later than the Mishnah. Alas, the heart of Apothaker's work, an annotated translation and analysis of Dibbura deSinai itself, is disappointing. Though Apothaker makes judicious use of the available manuscripts and the early printed editions, as well as I. H. Weiss's edition of 1862 and the work of Meir Friedmann (Ish-Shalom), he seems not to have consulted the classical medieval commentaries. Moreover, although Apothaker is much better than Neusner in his translation at elucidating the mechanics of the Sifra's exegesis, his understanding of the text itself is often incorrect, particularly when it comes to technical terms. Two examples will suffice. In Sifra Be-har perek 1:5, Apothaker misunderstands the debate between the Houses of Hillel and Shammai regarding whether one may consume produce of the sabbatical year be-tovah as having to do with eating the produce from land that was given as a gift (53). In fact, the discussion concerns the circumstances under which ownership of the produce, not the land, was trans ferred. Moreover, be-tovah means, as it does elsewhere in rabbinic literature, exactly the opposite of Apothaker's interpretation: It refers to something given as a quid pro quo, where, however, no formal obligation was entered into by the recipient. In Be-hukotai perek 10:5, Apothaker translates perotrot as "detailed accounting" (278). In fact, it is the fee that Temple officials must pay a money changer to exchange the forty-eight small coins, pundions, received as part of the redemption price of a field, for a larger coin, a sela. This cost is passed on to the individual redeeming the field. One final deficiency in Apothaker's work should be mentioned. Based on the presence of a group of tradents different from that in the rest of the Sifra, as well as rulings in conflict with statements elsewhere in the Sifra, J. N. Epstein the orized that Sifra Be-hukotai is of different authorship than the rest of the Sifra. Apothaker, in treating Dibbura de-Sinai as one unit, clearly disagrees with Epstein. Indeed, his whole project would be fatally flawed if he were to take Epstein's position. Nonetheless, Apothaker waits until the end of the book (405) to mention Epstein's view, and then only in a footnote. His counterargu ments, moreover, are spare indeed. 174</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews To sum up, Apothaker is working in a neglected area of rabbinic scholarship, and he clearly has the potential to investigate questions about the nature and pur poses of midrash halakhah that have been given scant attention. One hopes that his future work will give as much attention to the detailed work of interpretation as to the consideration of the larger questions that he has framed so well.
