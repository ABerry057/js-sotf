New York: Columbia University Press, 1997. x, 220 pp. Despite changes in religious fads and fashions, Mordecai Kaplan remains the central figure in the history of American Judaism in the twentieth century. Kaplan's pivotal role in the evolution of Reform, Orthodox, and Conservative Judaism, his founding of Reconstructionist Judaism, and his crucial significance in American Zionism, Jewish education, social work, and the Jewish center movement have been chronicled in a number of important volumes published in recent years, including Richard Libowitz's Mordecai M. Kaplan and the Development of Reconstructionism (1983), Jacob Rader Marcus and Abraham J. Peck's The American Rabbinate (1985), Delores Joan Rogers's The American Empirical Movement in Theology (1990), Emanuel S. Goldsmith, Mel Scult, and Robert M. Seltzer's The American Judaism</page><page sequence="2">172 BOOK REVIEWS of Mordecai M. Kaplan (1990), Mel Scult's Judaism Faces the Twentieth Century (1993), and S. Daniel Breslauer's Mordecai Kaplan 's Thought in a Postmodern Age (1994). This newly published study by Jeffrey S. Gurock and Jacob J. Schacter is unique in that it offers us an Orthodox view of the Orthodox Kaplan. Although it covers much of the ground already traversed by Scult, it is important for three reasons. First of all, it sees Kaplan the Orthodox rabbi through the eyes of his Orthodox followers and opponents. Second, it charts Orthodox fascination with, and ambivalence about, Kaplan from the time of his break with Orthodoxy in the 1920s until his death in 1983. Finally, it reflects Orthodoxy's failure to truly come to grips with Kaplan and indeed with all non-Orthodox manifestations of Judaism in America or, for that matter, anywhere in the world to this very day. The authors have produced an excellently conceived, written, organized, and documented work. They succeed in conveying the flavor of Kaplan's home and community, the atmosphere of the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Yeshiva and the Jewish Theological Seminary in the early decades of the century, and the mood of the Orthodox synagogue and street when Kaplan functioned as a "minister" in Congregation Kehillath Jeshurun in New York City's Yorkville and, later, as a rabbi in the Jewish Center on the Upper West Side. They demonstrate that Orthodox reactions to Kaplan always ranged from willingness to accept parts of his message to implacable opposition to everything he represented. Throughout the volume, the authors alternate the term "heretic" with "out- sider," "opponent," and especially "dissenter." They finally settle on "heretic," the most theological of these words. Yet they fail to refute convincingly the suspicion that Kaplan's excommunication and categorization as a heretic was more cultural than theological, more the result of the failure of American Orthodox leaders to square innovation and criticism with their opposition to inevitable change and adjustment than an intellectual repudiation of Kaplan's thinking. In fact, it would seem to have been due primarily to what Kaplan in another context once termed "anti-Maimunism in modem dress." Kaplan's great sins appear to have been his rejection of the kind of supernatural belief that accepts the miracle tales in the Bible literally, his assertion that the viability of such basic Jewish traditions as Shabbat and kashrut needed to be reassessed in the modem world, and his denial that God spoke in an audible voice at Sinai or that the revelation there actually took place as described in the Torah. With regard to the last of these points, it is worth recalling what</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 173 Jacob Agus, discussing Maimonides, wrote in his The Evolution of Jewish Thought (1959, pp. 190-191): When the Jewish people stood at the foot of Mount Sinai and heard the Ten Commandments recited by Moses, they were so deeply moved that in their imagination they heard voices and beheld wondrous sights. But the account of the revelation at Sinai must not be taken literally.... according to Maimonides, the account of the Sinaitic revelation in the Book of Exodus should be read as a parable (moshol). .... in general, "the inner meanings of the words of the Torah are the gems while the literal parables are no more than illustration. Maimonides also had his problems with miracles, and he expended no small effort in dealing with them in his Guide of the Perplexed. As far as Shabbat and kashrut are concerned, reassessment need never have been confused with repudiation or rejection. Kaplan's major contribution to Jewish thought, hailed by Orthodox rabbi Shlomo Riskin as worthy of being emblazoned "in gold letters atop every Jewish institutional building" (p. 156), was his definition of Judaism as a civilization. But this definition clearly implies that Judaism must be pluralistic. In a pluralistic civilization, diversity replaces heresy as a sine qua non. Indeed, Kaplan may have hit upon his definition as a result of his desire to delegitimize heresy as a category of Jewish thought. The authors fail to account adequately for what finally motivated Kaplan to break with Orthodoxy intellectually. Kaplan, it must be recalled, was the outstanding representative of the Haskalah movement in the twentieth century. Although conventional wisdom regards the Haskalah as having run its course in the 1880s, in fact it continues to this very day with all Jews who choose a synthesis of modernity and Judaism as their way of life. (Modem Orthodoxy is itself a product of the Haskalah.) The rationalistic, universalistic, and this-worldly emphases of the Haskalah were the primary sources of Kaplan's objections to Orthodoxy as it was practiced in America in the first half of the twentieth century. Kaplan was also greatly influenced by new developments in religion and religious thought in the America of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In 1874 the popular Chicago preacher David Swing was tried for heresy in the Presbyterian church. Swing taught that if Christianity in the modem world could no longer be spread as a dogma, it could now be promoted as a way of life and as a civilization. Swing's heresy trial was widely reported in the press and was a cause celebre in American Christianity for decades</page><page sequence="4">174 BOOK REVIEWS thereafter. Kaplan was, of course, primarily influenced by the philosopher William James, but the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Josiah Royce, John Dewey, Douglas Macintosh, Henry Wieman, Alfred North Whitehead, and others also influenced him. Sociology, psychology, and comparative religion also had lasting effects on Kaplan's thinking and helped him decide to break with Orthodoxy, and in fact to repudiate Reform and Conservative Judaism as well. This study clarifies not a few conundrums of early-twentieth-century American Judaism. In the early decades of the century, for example, the only real difference between the Jewish Theological Seminary and its Orthodox counterpart, the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, was the will- ingness of the former to tolerate Kaplan. The Young Israel movement, of which Kaplan was a founder, saw itself in those days as neither Orthodox nor Reform, neither Zionist nor Socialist. It intended rather "to awaken Jewish young men and women to their responsibilities as Jews, in whatever form these responsibilities be conceived" (p. 80). Everyone interested in any aspect of Judaism will benefit from a reading of this well-conceived and excellently executed book. Emanuel S.
