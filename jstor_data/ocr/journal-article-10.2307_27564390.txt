Jerusalem: Zalman Shazar Center for Jewish History, 2006. 350 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001475 Yosef Salmon's book Do Not Provoke Providence: Orthodoxy in the Grip of Nationalism examines the relationship between religion and Jewish nationalism in the modern period. Expanding on his previous research on religion and Zionism, this work contributes to the study of Jewish Orthodoxy as well as to the issue of the relationship between religion and Jewish nationalism. The following review will focus especially on the second topic?that is, on Jewish nationalism and its relationship to religion. The book's introduction presents some theoretical aspects of the relationship between religion and nationalism in general and between religion and Jewish nationalism in particular. This introductory chapter is highly signifi cant in light of the intensification of the study of nationalism in recent years. The methodological stance of the book is developmental. That is, it assumes development within the Jewish people from a traditional to a nationalist society. As do other researchers of nationalism, Salmon believes that Jewish nationalism is a modern phenomenon that relies on ancient tradition. Salmon rejects the view of nationalism as a modern and basically secular phenomenon that inherits and replaces the medieval religious period.1 In his view, in the modern age, we find a mixture of religion and nationalism, and we cannot distinguish between them as two separate phenomena. This is true in the Christian and Islamic worlds, in which religions are universal and cross ethnic lines; it applies even more so in the world of Judaism, in which there is "complete overlap between reli gion and ethnicity" (12). The book's four sections lead the reader from the beginning stages of Jewish nationalism in the nineteenth century to the establishment of the state of Israel: (1) 'Erez yisra 'el in Orthodox thought, (2) the movement from support to reservation in the period of Hovevei Ziyon, (3) the political Zionist period, (4) the transform ation of religious values in Israeli society. The main body of the discussion 1.

However, in the introduction as well as the last section of the book, the author points out processes taking place in today's state of Israel through which the Zionist ethos is gradually eroding: "Zionist society today is in a state of deep uncertainty, as the rationale for its exist ence has been deprived of much of its substance and value" (37). The three con cluding chapters of the book address the current situation of Israeli society. As noted, the author believes that although Jewish nationalism is a modern phenomenon, it developed from within historical Judaism. The theoretical inquiry and presentation of the historiographical discussion at the beginning of the book are important to all those studying the relationship between religion and nationalism because the basic terms in this field have changed drastically since the 1980s. Salmon believes that Jewish nationalism grew out of the world of the Jewish Enlightenment, yet the traditional stream also had nationalist trends. Although in general, Jewish Orthodoxy was not nationalist, and even acted in opposition to Zionism, especially beginning in the 1890s (204, 209-12, 213-35), it also produced several outstanding leaders for Jewish nationalism in the second half of the nineteenth century. In the section addressing the birth of Jewish nationalism, Salmon determines that the writings of R. Zvi Kalischer reveal a clear nationalist trend. As early as the 1860s, a group of nationalist Jewish thinkers formed whose members included the Orthodox as well as followers of the Enlightenment: Kalischer, Alkalai, Gordon, Hess, Smolensikin, Natonek, Pines, Eliasberg, and others. These thinkers opposed the popular trend in Jewish philosophy of that time?that is, to minimize the national dimension of Judaism. During this period, these people did not succeed in formulating a clear nationalist plan, but their nationalist intentions were clear. In this regard, Salmon continues the approach begun by Jacob Katz, but he is much more decisive than Katz regarding the nationalist stance of traditional thin kers as Kalischer and Alkalai (215-16).2 During the era of classical Zionism, there was no clear and decisive separ ation between a national religious orientation and religious anti-Zionism because prominent personalities of that time changed their minds and switched camps during different periods of their lives and in varying contexts of the conflict between religion and Zionism. Such, for example, is the case for Yechiel Michael Pines (third and sixth chapters), who represents the mobility of nationalist Orthodox leaders "from support to reservation." Those who were enthusiastic sup porters of the national settlement project in 'Erez yisra'el at the beginning of the Eovevei Ziyon movement began to separate themselves from it because of growing dissatisfaction with the accelerated process of secularization that fol lowed the Zionist project of the 1890s. Zionism in general, according to the author's definition, was not a secular movement, but it was definitely a modern movement and therefore accelerated processes of secularization (14). The 2.

The complex relationship between religion and nationalism in the Zionist context is a central theme throughout the book. Enthusiastic religious Zionists who aspired with all their being to create cooperation between the traditional camp and followers of the Enlightenment faced many difficulties. Rabbi Samuel Mohilewer, the moderate leader of Hovevei Ziyon who devotedly defended cooperation between religious and secular Zionists, also aspired to recruit more religious Jews to the movement (145). During the 1890s, Pines, who supported and aided Bilu members to settle in Gedera, stood in the center of a conflict between "the old Yishuv" and "the new Yishuv" (179-81). The Bnei Moshe organization also became embroiled in argument, both with the Zionists of the Enlightenment and with the religious Zionists (189). The numer ous disagreements did not end with the appearance of Herzl's political Zionism; rather, they increased in intensity. In the Eastern European Orthodox camp, the objection to Hovevei Ziyon and later to political Zionism deepened beginning in the late 1880s, following sharp polemics on questions related to keeping mitz voth and education (206-207). The religious objection to Zionism took on a sub stantially political character when it was led by the fifth Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Shalom Dov-Baer Schneersohn, from 1900 to 1902 (209-12, 227-31). After intensive efforts, Herzl himself gave up the idea of recruiting the entire Orthodox movement to the Zionist line (251). Salmon does not merely describe the relationship between religion and nationalism in the nineteenth century; he also relates it to processes of change in traditional values within the Jewish society of the modern state of Israel. Here he identifies the roles and importance of religious values and myths present in Israeli society. For example, he describes the centrality of the messianic idea to the Zionist movement and Zionist thought, as well as the prominence of national myths in the life of Israeli society. According to Salmon, religious myths served the Zionist movement as formative elements of the state of Israel's national identity. The Jewish messianic idea and the concept of renewal, of "renew our days as of old," serve modern Israeli society as unifying bonds. The religious movement within the Zionist project has been the subject of widespread research, particularly in the field of religious philosophy.3 This book lays a foundation for research that is primarily historical. Lately, Jewish nationalism as a historical phenomenon has faced criticism, on both ideological and academic levels. Not only is this issue now a topic of academic research, it is also a subject of public debate in Israel and throughout the Jewish world. For this reason, this book should occupy a central place on the bookshelf of all who 3.
