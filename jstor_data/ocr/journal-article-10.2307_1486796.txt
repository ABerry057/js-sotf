<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HISTORIOGRAPHICAL LEGACY OF SALO WITTMAYER BARON: THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD by ROBERT CHAZAN The impact of Salo Wittmayer Baron on the study of the history of the Jews during the Middle Ages has been enormous. This impact has, in part, been generated by Baron's voluminous writings, in particular his three- volume The Jewish Community and-even more so-his eighteen-volume Social and Religious History of the Jews. Equally decisive has been Baron's influence through his students and his students' students. Almost all researchers here in North America currently engaged in studying aspects of medieval Jewish history can surely trace their intellectual roots back to Salo Wittmayer Baron. In a real sense, many of Baron's views have become wide- ly assumed starting points for the field, ideas which need not be proven or argued but are simply accepted as givens. Over the next decade or decades, these views will be carefully identified and reevaluated. At some point, a This paper was originally delivered as part of a plenary session devoted to the historical legacy of Salo Wittmayer Baron, held at the 1990 conference of the Association for Jewish Studies. I have made modest changes in the original, but have decided to retain the lecture format. 29</page><page sequence="2">30 ROBERT CHAZAN major study of Baron's legacy, including his influence on the study of medie- val Jewish history, will of necessity eventuate. Such a study will have, on the one hand, its inherent intellectual fascination; at the same time, it will con- stitute an essential element in the next stages of the growth of the field, as it inevitably begins to make its way beyond Baron and his twentieth-century ambience. There are a number of factors that contributed to the formation of Salo Wittmayer Baron's view of the medieval Jewish experience. These include his wide-ranging training in a number of disciplines; his remarkable erudi- tion in materials both Jewish and non-Jewish; his own particular placement in time and space, involving both his European origins and his full embrace of the American milieu; and his original orientation as a student of the modern Jewish experience. For the purposes of this brief presentation, I should like to focus on the last element, Baron's original orientation toward the modern period, and its influence on some of his central views of the medieval Jewish experience. In an important preface to her bibliography of Baron's writings, Jeanette Meisel Baron makes the following significant observations: Professor Baron who decided to dedicate his life to Jewish history felt that he could accomplish this only by acquiring a very broad base from which to work. He, therefore, studied history, political science, economics, and juris- prudence as well as the more traditional Jewish and Semitic subject matter and received his doctorates from the University of Vienna in Philosophy (History as a major, Semitic Languages as a minor), 1917; Political Science, 1922; Juris- prudence, 1923; and his rabbinical degree from the Jewish Theological Semi- nary in Vienna in 1920. With this background he now felt that he was able to specialize primarily in the field of modern Jewish history. However, he was sidetracked by such general works as his The Jewish Community and A Social and Religious History of the Jews, particularly its second edition on which he has spent the last twenty-five years working in the ancient and medieval areas.' I would suggest only one modification to these important observations by the person who knew Baron best: It seems clear that the last four decades of 1.

BARON 31 his life were devoted heavily to the medieval period specifically, not to a combination of the ancient and medieval. A few further observations on Baron's growing attraction to the medie- val Jewish experience are in order. A look at the bibliography assembled by Mrs. Baron shows that, up to the appearance of the first edition of A Social and Religious History of the Jews in 1937, by which time Salo Baron was in his early forties and had published extensively, he had devoted himself to only one study of medieval Jewish life, namely, his article on Maimonides, which appeared in 1935 and was obviously stimulated by the celebration of the seven-hundredth anniversary of the birth of the great sage.2 The bulk of his pre-1937 publications dealt with modern Jewish life or, in more limited numbers, with the biblical period. The first edition of Baron's Social and Religious History was carefully organized and balanced. In the twelve chapters of the work, three are devoted to the biblical period, three to rab- binic Judaism, three to the medieval Jewish experience, and two to the modern period, with the opening chapter serving as a broad methodological introduction.3 It was Baron's original intention to maintain roughly the same balance in a proposed six-volume second edition of A Social and Reli- gious History of the Jews, two devoted to the biblical and rabbinic epochs, two to the Middle Ages, and two to the modern Jewish experience.4 In fact, 2.

It is somewhat unfortunate that Baron chose to designate his magnum opus a second edi- tion of A Social and Religious History of the Jews. He did so because of his original view of the proposed new work. In fact, as noted shortly, the new work turned in unexpected directions. The end result has been considerable and unfortunate neglect of the first edition of A Social and Religious History of the Jews, which deserves a better fate. It is a remarkably balanced overview of major themes in Jewish history, in many ways far more accessible to students and the general reading public than the massive eighteen-volume second edition. 4. There is widespread agreement that this was Baron's original plan. Note the clearcut statement by Lloyd Gartner in his full and excellent memorialization of Baron in Zion 55 (1990): 325. I have spoken with a number of Baron's students, who similarly recollect the ori- ginal plan. To be sure, I have found no written statement of Baron's intentions. The preface to volume 1 of the second edition of A Social and Religious History of the Jews does not spell out the overall plan of the revised edition. The preface to volume 3 does acknowledge a change in approach and attempts to explain it. Baron's acknowledgment of the shift is bland: "Although generally adhering to the historical approach of the first two volumes, the author found it necessary to devote to the High Middle Ages, a period of but seven centuries (500-1200), much more space than he had to the treatment of the preceding two millenia." Some of the considera- tions that Baron advances for the shift are not terribly convincing. Perhaps the most persuasive</page><page sequence="4">32 ROBERT CHAZAN the first two volumes, which appeared in 1952, conformed precisely to the projected scheme. With the appearance of volumes 3 through 5 in 1957, the original scheme was abandoned. Baron spent the remaining three decades and more of his life composing thirteen more volumes that brought his his- tory only to the year 1648. What had been projected as a broad history of the Jewish people in fact became a great synthetic presentation of the period between the seventh and seventeenth centuries. The man who had assid- uously prepared himself for the study of modern Jewish history had become the most encompassing of the students of the medieval Jewish experience. What I would like to argue is that Baron's early orientation as a his- torian of modern Jewish life had significant impact upon his thinking as he synthesized the history of medieval Jewry. I would argue that at least four of Salo Baron Baron's central views on the medieval Jewish experience reflect his original orientation toward and immersion in the modern Jewish experi- ence. I propose to treat these four views by moving from the more specific to the more general. Perhaps the Baron interpretation that is most obviously indebted to his early orientation toward modern Jewish history was his emphasis on the role of nationalism in the decline of medieval Jewry in the West. One of the most striking theses advanced in Baron's work has to do with the impact of nationalism on the fate of medieval Jewry. Let us note his striking formula- tion early in volume 9 of A Social and Religious History: This [the simultaneous decline of Church and Jewish fortunes] was no mere coincidence. The Jewish people and the Church universal were victimized by essentially the same factors. We shall see how destructive of the entire Jewish position was the rising tide of medieval nationalism. Less conscious and, in many respects, less virulent than modern nationalism, the medieval drive toward national unity, most clearly exemplified in the struggle of the French Crown with its feudal vassals, operated in the direction of ethnic exclusivity and national sovereignty. The former played an enormous role, as will become is his last claim, which points to the availability, for the ancient period, of "much secondary literature of high quality and recent vintage," and the lack of a parallel literature on the Middle Ages. For students of the career and creativity of Salo Baron, perhaps the most intriguing ques- tion of all is the shift that took place in his revised edition of A Social and Religious History of the Jews during the 1950s. That shift set him on the course that would endure for the remaining three and a half decades of his life.</page><page sequence="5">THE HISTORIOGRAPHICAL LEGACY OF SALO W. BARON 33 clear in a later chapter, in underscoring the "alien" character of the Jewish minority and in the ultimate quest for its total elimination via expulsion, con- version, or extermination. The aspiration toward national sovereignty, on the other hand, undermined that very spiritual and cultural universality which had lent a semblance of realism to the ecumenical leadership of the Church. In this way, the destinies of medieval Jewry and those of the medieval Church became subtly intertwined beyond the ken and wishes of the leaders of either party.5 This is a teaching that has been far from universally accepted by late- twentieth-century historians of medieval Jewry.6 It does, however, represent a vigorous new view of medieval Jewish fortunes, and it does reflect-I believe-the impact of Baron's earlier work as a historian of the modern period. From his doctoral dissertation onward, Baron was vitally concerned with modern European nationalism and its impact on Jewish life. Indeed, his interest in the phenomenon of modern nationalism was so strong that it led him beyond the pale of Jewish history, to the writing of a book devoted entirely to consideration of the phenomenon of nationalism in its broadest outlines.7 Here, then, there can be no real doubt as to the impingement of Baron's modern Jewish studies upon his later work on the circumstances of medieval Jewry. Baron's emphasis on the role of medieval nationalism in the deteriora- tion of medieval Jewish circumstances went hand-in-hand with another major reinterpretation, his reassessment of the role of the medieval Church. For Baron's great predecessor Graetz-and indeed for Dubnow as well- the archvillain of medieval Jewish life was the Roman Catholic Church.8 Let 5.

While recent historians of the Jews have not overtly attacked Baron's emphasis on medieval nationalism, they have in fact indicated their negative reaction by their failure to fea- ture this line of thinking and to pursue it. It seems to me that recent work on the growing repressiveness of medieval western Christendom suggests that Baron's emphasis on nationalism per se may be exaggerated, but that his sense of a new spirit that increasingly tended to isolate the Jews and other outgroups finds considerable support. For a striking formulation of this new particularistic and xenophobic spirit, see for instance Friedrich Heer, The Medieval World. Europe 1100-1350, trans. Janet Sondheimer (London, 1961). I deal with these issues at con- siderable length in chapter 7 of my forthcoming The Decline of Early Ashkenazic Jewry. 7. Salo Wittmayer Baron, Modern Nationalism and Religion (New York, 1947) . 8. An emphasis on the role of the Church in medieval Jewish fortunes continued to be prominent in the work of many Israeli historians, including Yitzhak Baer and Haim Hillel Ben- Sasson.</page><page sequence="6">34 ROBERT CHAZAN us attend briefly to a remarkable passage in the seventh volume of Graetz's great history: The orphaned state of Judaism at the beginning of the thirteenth century [due to the death of Maimonides] was compounded by the enmity of a mighty force, the likes of which had not been seen, with respect to power and tenacity, since the time of Hadrian. Pope Innocent III (1198-1216), from whom stemmed all the evil that the European peoples suffered down to the Lutheran reformation: the tyrannical domination of the Roman Church over princes and peoples, the enslavement and dimming of the spirit, the persecution of free inquiry, the institution of the Inquisition, the funeral pyre for heretics, i.e., for those who dared to doubt the infallibility of the Roman bishop-this Pope Innocent III was also a bitter enemy of the Jews and Judaism and dealt severer blows against them than all their previous foes. The little band of Jews was like a thorn in the eye of the mighty prince of the Church in the Vatican, who enth- roned and dethroned kings, apportioned crowns and countries, and, through his army of papal legates, spies, and Dominican and Franciscan monks with their bloodthirsty piety, subjugated the whole of Europe, from the Atlantic Ocean to Constantinople and from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arctic regions. For this handful of people, with their clear intellect, their pure faith, their moral strength, and their superior culture, was a silent protest against Roman arrogance.9 Despite his unquestioned admiration for Graetz, Baron in effect turned the Graetzian view on its head. For Baron, both the Church and medieval Jewry were victims of a more powerful force than either, the force of incipient nationalism. Unlike his predecessors-and indeed many of those who have come after him-Baron saw in the Roman Catholic Church essentially a conservative force that was oriented, above all else, to the maintenance of a status quo. With respect to the Jews, this meant, for Baron, the maintenance of a delicate balance between protective toleration and the impingement of vexing limitations. The key, however, lay in the maintenance of this balance. It was the decline of the Church-in Baron's view-that opened the way for more radical and more destructive views of the Jews and Judaism. Again, it seems to me that such a view of the Church reflects once more Baron's early 9. Heinrich Graetz, Geschichte der Juden von den iltesten Zeiten bis auf die Gegenwart, 7:4.

Let us turn our attention to a third and 'somewhat broader impact of Baron's orientation toward the modern upon his work in medieval Jewish history. One of Baron's abiding interests, from his earliest days as a his- torian, was demography and demographic change. Indeed, his earliest important essay outside the realm of modern Jewish history was an article entitled "The Israelite Population under the Kings."' Baron's interest in and views of Jewish demography and demographic change represent a valuable corrective to more traditional attitudes on this subject. Baron insisted repeatedly, in both his writings and his lecturing, that the dramatic instances of demographic change occasioned by expulsion and persecution should not be allowed to obscure the fact that, over the ages, the vast major- ity of Jews uprooted themselves and their families and sought new homes out of a fairly normal human desire for betterment for self and progeny. This is a point that I can well remember Baron emphasizing in classroom presentation. In part, this emphasis is simply the result of Baron's vast eru- dition and his broad awareness of human history and inclinations. However, here too I believe that his early focus on the modern period, where the evi- dence for peaceful demographic movement abounds, significantly influ- enced his understanding of the Middle Ages, where such evidence is ex- tremely sparse. It is this sense of slow, peaceful demographic change that was critical to Baron's reevaluation of the impact of the crusades on medie- val Jewish life in Europe. Despite the drama of the crusading period and the poignancy of the sources that depict Jewish suffering at the hands of the cru- saders, Baron chose to see the period in a broader context, arguing that the evidence-slim but incontrovertible-of ongoing migration into the lands of northern Europe and of the unimpeded growth of the Jewries of this rapidly developing young area indicates clearly that the crusades constitute no signi- ficant landmark in the development of early Ashkenazic Jewry." It was, in 10. Salo Wittmayer Baron, "The Israelite Population under the Kings" (Hebrew), Abhand- lungen zur Erinnerung an Hirsch Perez Chayes (Vienna, 1933), pp. 76-136. 11. Baron, A Social and Religious History of the Jews, 4:89-9 1 and 147-149. This view of Baron's has met with limited acceptance, as the older notion of 1096 as a dramatic turning point continues to be presented more regularly. I attempted to argue the Baron view in some depth in the closing chapter of my European Jewry and the First Crusade (Berkeley, 1987).</page><page sequence="8">36 ROBERT CHAZAN this case as in so many others, that attention to demographic realities ena- bled Baron to proffer innovative interpretations of the medieval Jewish experience. The last of the four Baron views that I wish to note is the broadest and most significant of all. It is Baron's conviction that the history of the Jews in all its dimensions-demographic, economic, political, social, intellectual, and spiritual-can only be understood against the backdrop of the broader societal context in which the Jews found themselves. This conviction mani- fests itself on every page of Baron's writings on medieval Jewish life. I men- tioned, early on, Baron's first essay on the medieval Jewish experience. "The Historical Outlook of Maimonides." It is striking that the first section of this essay is entitled "Jewish and Arab Historiography"; it was obviously Baron's sense that the historical outlook of Maimonides could not be under- stood without a sense of the traditions impinging upon him, and that those traditions included both a Jewish and a non-Jewish component. To be sure, this conviction of the importance of the broad societal con- text hardly seems innovative, yet here-I would argue-we deal with pre- cisely one of those points at which Baron's views have become established doctrine. If we pause for a moment to consider the sense of Graetz on this matter-and Graetz was in many ways Baron's revered guide to the field of Jewish history-we shall see how innovative Baron's assumption was. Let us note a critical passage from the writings of Graetz: Within this space of time [the seventeen centuries of diaspora experience], world history has thrice changed its garb. The venerable Roman Empire lan- guished and sank into the grave; from its decaying body sprang the chrysalis of the European and Asiatic nations; they attained the brilliant butterfly-form of Christian and Moslem chivalry; and from its smoldering castles rose up the phoenix of civilization. World history was transformed thrice, but the Jews remained the same; at most they changed in outward form. Indeed, world his- tory also thrice changed its spiritual nature. From distinctive, but hollow cul- ture, mankind sank into barbarism and dark ignorance; from ignorance, it again rose to the luminous spheres of a higher culture. But the spiritual con- tent of Judaism remained the same; it was only enriched by the new materials and patterns of thought.'2 12. Graetz, Geschichte der Juden, 4:2. Again, I have provided my own translation, based on the second edition (Leipzig, 1865).</page><page sequence="9">THE HISTORIOGRAPHICAL LEGACY OF SALO W. BARON 37 This remarkable statement is light-years away from the most fundamental perspectives of Salo Baron. Many factors played a role in the development of Baron's sense of the impact of societal context. In part, his views flowed from the fullness of his knowledge of Western civilization. It is impossible to imagine Baron sub- scribing to the condescending view of Western civilization embodied in the Graetz statement. What I am proposing is that one of the factors that shaped Baron's sense of the embeddedness of Jewish experience in a broader matrix was his early orientation toward the modern period of Jewish experi- ence, the period during which such embeddedness is a given. In other words, those historians who focus on the medieval Jewish experience, because of the nature of the sources with which they deal, run the greatest risk of neg- lecting the broader context in which Jewish life unfolds. It was precisely Salo Baron, the historian of modern Jewry who evolved into the synthesizing stu- dent of medieval Jewish life, who was best attuned to this dimension of Jewish experience and who was best equipped to insist upon locating the Jews within their larger context. This brief presentation has touched on only a portion of Salo Baron's legacy to the study of medieval Jewish history. I have tried to highlight his late immersion in medieval Jewish history and the impact that his earlier bent toward the modern period had on his views of the Middle Ages. There is obviously much more to be said concerning Baron's views of medieval Jewish life, the genesis of these views, and their influence." As I indicated at the outset, I have no doubt that the further development of our field, as it progesses into the twenty-first century, will necessitate far fuller considera- tion of the legacy of the great synthesizer of the medieval Jewish experience. New York University New York, N.Y. 13. I shared a copy of my lecture with Lloyd Gartner, whose full essay on Baron has already been noted. He was supportive of my thesis and further suggested the importance of understanding Baron's upbringing. Gartner notes Baron's upper-middle-class roots and his immersion, from childhood on, in the world of business and affairs. This gave Baron, according to Gartner, a perspective significantly different from that of most Jewish historians, recruited from the world of the yeshivot and the intelligentsia. Gartner's observations seem to me very important. As noted at the outset and the conclusion of this essay, much work remains to be done on the historical oeuvre and thought of Salo Wittmayer Baron.</page></plain_text>
