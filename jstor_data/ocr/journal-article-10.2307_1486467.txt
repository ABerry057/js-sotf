<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Abraham Halkin and David Hartman. Crisis and Leadership: Epistles of Maimonides. Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1985. x, 292 pp. This volume contains three of Maimonides' most famous epistles-On Martyrdom, Epistle to Yemen, and On Resurrection-admirably translated with helpful comments by Abraham Halkin. David Hartman introduces the volume, and after each epistle he elaborates on its theological and philo- sophical doctrines. Hartman stresses the disturbing enigma of Maimonides' oeuvre: did Maimonides write intentionally for two different audiences, the masses and the elite, and in so doing advance contradictory opinions? Before turning to a discussion of Hartman's distinctive approach, a brief discussion of the sources is necessary. The Epistle on Martyrdom concerns those North African Jews who, when confronted with Almohad persecution, chose apostasy to avoid death. Some made a formal confession of faith yet continued to practice and per- petuate Judaism within the confines of their homes. An anonymous rabbi had ruled that such people were no better than idolators and that their actions were not only in vain but sinful. Maimonides adopted a more lenient attitude in an effort to encourage them. Those who were able to do so, he wrote, should escape to other lands. As for martyrdom, dying 'al qiddush ha-shem was certainly a great and holy act, but it was not warranted by the circumstances in this case, because professing the Islamic faith was not the same thing as practicing idolatry, and furthermore, the Muslim rulers knew that the "converts" were clandestinely practicing Judaism. 133</page><page sequence="2">134 BOOK REVIEWS The Epistle to Yemen also sought to sustain Jews against the onslaughts of a fanatical Muslim sect, this time in Yemen. It was written in response to a letter from Jacob ben Nathanel al-Fayyumi, who had contacted Mai- monides on behalf of the community with four questions: Did their com- munal suffering have any significance? How should they respond to an apos- tate who was now a missionary for Islam? How were conflicting messianic claims to be evaluated? Could the messianic advent be predicted by astro- logy? The last of the three epistles, the Essay on Resurrection, was written late in Maimonides' life. In it he defends himself against accusations that he did not believe in the resurrection of the body. Maimonides asserts his absolute belief in bodily resurrection, but insists that the resurrected bodies will ulti- mately return to dust and the soul alone will enjoy the divine presence eternally. These three epistles have long perplexed readers and commentators. The Essay on Resurrection apparently tries to have it both ways, accepting the idea of physical resurrection, since to do otherwise would be heretical, but making it only a temporary stage, so that immortality of the soul could remain the preferred doctrine. The position on martyrdom advocated in the Epistle on Martyrdom seems to contradict halakhah, including Mai- monides' own halakhic rulings. The significance attached to messianic phenomena in the Epistle to Yemen is at variance with Maimonides' attempts to devalue messianism in some of his other writings and counte- nances the type of unrefined eschatology he repeatedly condemned. Is there any way to make sense of these seemingly inconsistent positions? In the introduction, Hartman maintains that Maimonides, in these three epistles, was attempting to aid the "ten thousand ignoramuses" so cavalierly dismissed in the Guide. "Here is no erudite intellectual expounding complex philosophical arguments for the sake of a 'single virtuous man,' but a com- mitted leader who enters the marketplace of the community and is prepared to suffer hardships for the sake of the welfare of the whole" (p. 6). Hartman further asserts "that a commitment to the community is actually a leit- motiv of all his works" (p. 6). According to Hartman, "Even in the Guide, Maimonides does not advocate an ivory-tower existence, but instead tries to convince his reader to return to the community" (p. 6). Another of Maimonides' primary aims, according to Hartman, was to educate the community in such a way as to neutralize their obstinately faith- ful illusions and thwart their lofty religious expectations. "While fully aware</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 135 of the gap that existed between the levels of worship of the masses and the educated few, he nonetheless tried, throughout his life, to raise the level of the community closer to the ideal of love of God" (p. 8). In this view, then, the three epistles demonstrate Maimonides' attitude when he had to come to the assistance of communities facing critical challenges, in contrast to the modes of thought he adopted in the Guide. Another way of resolving the apparent inconsistencies may be found in Maimonides' heuristic technique and possible pedagogical models as a teacher. Ever the philosopher par excellence, Maimonides sought to devise educational methods for the masses, who, according to some of his writings, were almost beyond instruction. He faced a difficulty familiar to most teachers: Is it better to risk boring the few by addressing the many, or to alienate the many by speaking to the few? This was one of the quintessential quandaries that Maimonides confronted. Maimonides adopted the pedagogical approach of taking the world on its own terms. Both humanity in general and Israel in particular were accepted as they were, and it was in accordance with this that his approach to diverse religious issues was developed. Maimonides understood indubita- bly that the metaphysical and ontological questions regarding the Torah and its mitzvot differ from the epistemological ones. That is to say, since the divine laws are the result of divine wisdom, they are rational and conse- quently knowable by mankind. But the laws-in part, if not in toto-may have been conditioned historically, and therefore may, to some degree, be contingent. This, of course, approaches the position advanced by some concerning the explanation of the ta'amei ha-mitzvot in general, and the sacrifices in particular, in part 3 of the Guide. If, in fact, one subscribes to the idea of God employing divine "ruses," or some sort of accommodation or gradual- ism in His Law, then surely Maimonides, as a committed leader and not simply an erudite intellectual, could advance supposedly contrary positions depending upon diverse conditions at disparate times. This would not be inconsistent with Hartman's thesis that Maimonides was continually con- cerned with the community. Would it, after all, be so strange for a leader of a community in crisis to sanction practical positions that were supposedly at odds with stances advocated in theory? This is one and the same issue with regard to the hostility between philosophy and halakhah; the fragile yet per- durable role and function of messianism; and the dilemma of eschatology. How are they presented to, explicated, and perceived by the few and the</page><page sequence="4">136 BOOK REVIEWS many? For Hartman, these letters reveal the sage offering practical counsel to people and communities facing calamity. Hartman's well-known differences with other interpreters of Mai- monides (L. Strauss, H. Soloveitchik, I. Twersky, A. Funkenstein, among others) are addressed but not reconciled in this volume. His impassioned discussions are informative and provocative. This is not a book for begin- ning students, but for those who have studied Maimonides it provides the cogent reflections of a sensitive scholar. And yet, despite the abundant scholarly contributions of Hartman and others, the questions concerning the Sage of Fustat still draw us onward. Stephen D.
