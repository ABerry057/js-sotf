This nonterritorial strain of Jewish nation- alism, also known as Autonomism, was once widely regarded as "together with Zionism the most important political expression of the Jewish people in the modern era."1 From its fin-de-siècle origins in the Russian and Austro-Hungarian empires, it spread rapidly across Eastern Europe, sprouting various movements for Jewish national-cultural autonomy. After World War II, however, Diaspora Nationalism vanished almost overnight. So too was its intellectual afterlife marked by silence, as postwar historians of Jewish political thought largely ignored its legacy.2 Recently, however, Diaspora Nationalism has emerged as a growing field of scholarship.3 The results are impressive: a striking new wave * This article was written with the support of the University of Virginia Jewish Studies Program and Dean's Office, and the Posen Foundation.

Given Diaspora Nationalism's deep ideological linkage to Eastern Europe, it comes as little surprise that most scholars have limited their gaze to that region. However, the reality is that the movement was a thoroughly transnational phenom- enon. To properly understand the history of Diaspora Nationalism, we must look beyond Eastern Europe to assess its larger impact on global Jewish political life. 4.

In every episode of international diplomacy from the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 through to the founding of the United Nations (UN) in San Francisco in 1945, American Jews figured prominently in negotiations regarding Jewish minority rights in Eastern Europe. Yet we know relatively little of the particulars of Diaspora Nationalism's intellectual reception and political support in the American Jewish context.9 In this article, I address this lacuna by recovering the biography of one of Diaspora Nation- alism's foremost American intellectual advocates: Oscar Janowsky (1900-1993). Once an influential scholarly figure in American Jewish affairs, today Janowsky is all but forgotten. His reputation rests narrowly on the book he pub- lished in 1933, The Jews and Minority Rights, 1898-1919, the only major study of Diaspora Nationalism that appeared in the English language in the twentieth century.10 In its day, the book earned him a reputation as a leading American auth- ority on minority rights and nationalism. During World War II, he championed Jewish national-cultural autonomy for postwar Eastern Europe, arguing promi- nently that national federalism and political autonomy offered more general sol- utions to the problems of nationalism, minorities' protection, and state sovereignty. As late as 1945, even after facts about the Holocaust had become widely known, Janowsky continued to press the Autonomist political claim on behalf of East European Jewry. Taken together, Janowsky 's wartime writings raise an interesting question about the persistence of Eastern Europe in the mid-century American Jewish pol- itical imagination. But what makes him still more relevant to a general reappraisal of the history of Jewish nationalism in the United States- is his active participation in the leadership of the American Labor Zionist movement. Thus, at the same time as he called consistently for Jewish national autonomy in Eastern Europe, Janowsky publicly campaigned for the cause of Jewish statehood in Palestine. We are accustomed to typologies of Jewish nationalism that posit Zionism and Diaspora Nationalism as locked in a zero-sum competition for popular Jewish loyalties. 1 1 This putative conflict is often framed in terms of a choice between 8.

The binary opposition is neatly encapsulated in the opposition between the Hebrew term aliyah and the Yiddish concept of doikeyt, or "hereness," denoting ideological rootedness in Eastern Europe. This dichotomy, however, is based largely on the bitter political conflicts of Eastern Europe and the inevitable backshadowing produced by Zionism's later success. By contrast, Janowsky's model of American Jewish nationalism empha- sized the easy and necessary reconciliation of these two distinct political objec- tives (national autonomy in Eastern Europe, national sovereignty in Palestine). His case highlights the elastic character of American Zionism, in which two political foci not only coexisted but also actively complemented each other in a harmonious vision of global Jewish nationhood. Of course, Janowsky was not alone in his theoretical rapprochement between Diaspora and Zion. Recent scholarship has highlighted a number of other twentieth-century Jewish thinkers, including Shimon Rawidowicz, Morde- cai Kaplan, Horace Kallen, and Israel Friedlander, who developed broader models of nationhood and political sovereignty in order to balance dual commit- ments to American liberalism and Zionism.12 Thanks to this work, we no longer approach the intellectual history of American Zionism strictly in terms of an either/ or dichotomy between America and Zion or homeland and exile. Nor do we take for granted that support for territorial sovereignty was the sole factor defining this kind of liberal nationalism. Yet because Eastern Europe is usually bracketed out in historical discussions of American Jewish nationalism, a certain false emphasis on the binary split between Israel and Diaspora persists. Adding Janowsky to this emerging narrative allows us to recover a third geographical dimension to American Jewish nationalism. Reexamining American Zionist support for minority rights in Eastern Europe suggests how Diaspora Nationalism served as a crucial ideological bridge between the potentially divergent ideals of statist nationalism in Palestine and political liberalism in the United States. So, too, does it draw our attention back to the time when American Jews grappled with the question of whether they themselves should seek state recognition and political rights as a national minority in the United States. In this article, I analyze Janowsky's attempt to define a model of American Jewish nationalism with a dual telos: Diasporic minority rights in Eastern Europe and territorial sovereignty in Palestine. Beginning with an analysis of his 1933 book and its reception, I trace the further development of his ideas in the early 1940s' context of wartime Zionist and American foreign policy circles. I then turn to his reactions to the abrupt decline of minority rights after World War II and their replacement by the new doctrine of international human rights. That seismic shift, coupled with the triumph of Zionism, brought an end to Janowsky's 12.

His response took two forms: a heated critique of international human rights as a form of Jewish "assimilation" and a series of socio- logical studies in which he struggled to define American Jewish collective identity without reference to nationalism. These two efforts expose the root tension between his steadfast belief in the protean and exceptional character of American Jewish identity and his ideological assertion of global Jewish nationhood. I con- clude that Janowsky 's support for Diaspora Nationalism ultimately faltered on the shoals of American Jewish identity. Documenting this failure thus not only exposes the limits of transnational political ideologies' penetration into American Jewish life, but also reveals the crucial mid-century moment when liberal interna- tionalism and Jewish nationalism completed their larger fateful divergence. I. A LONG-DlSTANCE NATIONALIST Oscar Janowsky came of age during the single most fertile decade of Jewish political thought in twentieth-century America. Born in 1900 in the Polish- Lithuanian shtetl of Suchowola, he arrived on the Lower East Side in 1910 just as American Jewish intellectuals had begun to radically rethink Jewish collective identity in the face of the massive flood of new immigrants and nationalist ideol- ogies from Eastern Europe. In search of a framework for Jewish national identity and international political solidarity in a diverse, liberal American society, they produced a flurry of new ideas and social experiments: Horace Kallen's cultural pluralism; Louis Brandeis 's American Zionism; Chaim Zhitlovsky's socialist Yid- dishism; the New York Kehillah communal autonomy of Israel Friedlander, Mor- decai Kaplan, and Judah Magnes; the Joint Distribution Committee's international philanthropy; and the American Jewish Congress movement.13 Janowsky encountered many of these thinkers and their ideas firsthand during his teenage years. After studying in a Talmud Torah and graduating from DeWitt Clinton High School, he enrolled at City College. At the same time, he took courses at the New York Kehillah 's Board of Jewish Education and the Jewish Theological Seminary Teachers Institute. Though energized by the climate of intellectual experimentation, he recoiled from the partisan passions and manic factionalism of many of his peers. Under the influence of Brandeis, Friedlander, and Kaplan, he stressed the harmonious interplay of Jewish and American in his identity. A "confirmed Zionist," he wept with joy upon hearing the news of the Balfour Declaration, yet took equal pride in acquiring his U.S. citi- zenship.14 As an immigrant himself, he harbored little sentimentality for Eastern 13.

Indeed, his connection to Diaspora Nation- alism emerged not through political activism but through academic scholarship. After graduating with a BA in History from City College in 1921, Janowsky immediately enrolled in the PhD program in modern European history at Colum- bia University. In search of a topic with contemporary political implications, he chose as his dissertation the subject of "Jewish national minority rights" at the Paris Peace Conference.15 Interestingly enough, the choice was made over the objections of his advisor, Professor Carlton Hayes, the preeminent American his- torian of nationalism of the day. Hayes openly resisted the idea that the Jews con- stituted a distinct nation. He went out of his way to emphasize his conviction that "both in ancient times and throughout the middle ages, and even down into modern times, the Jews have been not so much a nationality infused with nation- alism as adherents to a religion."16 Undeterred, Janowsky continued his research, which included interviews with scores of American and East European Jewish pol- itical leaders, among them Simon Dubnow, Cyrus Adler, Chaim Zhitlovsky, Chaim Weizmann, Yitzhak Greenbaum, Nahum Sokolow, and Menachem Ussish- kin. After positive approval by the Jewish historian Salo Baron, newly appointed to the Columbia faculty, and a grudging acceptance by Hayes, Janowsky sub- mitted the completed work. The following year he published his dissertation as book with a preface by American Zionist Judge Julian Mack. The Jews and Min- ority Rights earned Janowsky a teaching position at City College, where he went on to spend the remainder of his career, rising to become a distinguished professor of history and international relations.17 In substance, Janowsky 's book comprises a sweeping history of the move- ment for Jewish national minority rights in Europe in the first two decades of the twentieth century, and a very careful, detailed study of the political process at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 that had produced the interwar Minorities Trea- ties. The result is a vigorous prescriptive argument in favor of Diaspora National- ism in the guise of strictly descriptive scholarly account. The book opens with a brief overview of the origins of "minority nationalism" among East European Jews, emphasizing its recent origins and the influence of Austro-Marxism and the East European sociopolitical context. Janowsky stresses that his topic is neither Zionism nor Palestine: "Our objective is rather to trace the development Clarification," Menorah Journal (October 1943), 228.

In his eyes, the Minorities Treaties should have been formulated as a vehicle for national self-determination rather than merely an inter- national device to protect vulnerable minorities in the new multiethnic nation-states of the region. He therefore criticizes the Jewish political achievements at the Paris Peace Conference as insufficient. Despite guarantees of Jewish citizenship and lin- guistic and cultural rights, the Jews failed to realize any of the broader potential "vision of states of federated nationalities." Various proposals for Jewish member- ship in the League of Nations, the right to collective reparations, self-regulated emi- gration, and other "national legislative and administrative organs" simply vanished from the final product. Without these, Janowsky explains, the Jews of Eastern Europe cannot be said to have fulfilled their nationalist aspirations. Given this expansive interpretation of minority rights as an explicit vehicle for national self-government, it is not difficult to detect the strong influence of con- temporary Diaspora Nationalist thought throughout the book. Chief among those thinkers whose ideological imprint is clearly evident is Simon Dubnow. Janowsky dates the beginnings of "non-Zionist nationalism" as a modern political movement to 1 898, the year of Dubnow's first explicit call for national autonomy. So too does he follow Dubnow's lead in invoking the pre-modern European Jewish kehilah, or corporate, autonomous community, as the prototypical model for modern Jewish Diaspora Nationalism.19 However, in one important respect, Janowsky breaks with his fellow historian. Although Dubnow had suggested that American Jewry might organize itself into a national self-governing body, Janowsky empha- sizes that in the United States and other Western countries, Jewish national auton- omy is neither necessary nor appropriate.20 Hence, one must take care to differentiate "the objectives of the western nationalists from those of the east- European autonomists." "The former did not demand national rights for them- selves," he explains; instead, they sought "to unite world Jewry on a program calling for national rights in the east-European states of multiple nationality."21 Given the unique social and political character of the United States, which was not a "state of multiple nationalities" but a homogenizing society, national 1 8.

In other words, the role of "western" Jews in America is to enact political nationalism as a long- distance program in Eastern Europe.22 To justify this bifurcated model of Diaspora Nationalism, Janowsky empha- sizes that the key distinction in Jewish politics lies not between Diaspora Nation- alists and Zionists, but in the fundamental division of the Jewish world into "two well-defined classes": "nationalists" and "assimilationists." The former, whom he identifies with the American Jewish Congress and other Zionist groups, recognize Jews as a "nationality." They therefore support Jewish claims to political auton- omy in Eastern Europe and sovereignty in Palestine. Meanwhile the "assimilation- ists" reject the "characterization of the Jews as a national group." Reading his narrative, it becomes clear that he views the British and American "assimilation- ists" as wholly responsible for the demise of true national-cultural autonomy for East European Jewry. Much as they had opposed the Balfour Declaration, the American Jewish Committee and the Anglo-Jewish Association had similarly derailed the prospects for Jewish autonomy in Paris in 1919. By framing the nar- rative of the Peace Conference in terms of a morality play between good and bad Jewish leaders, Janowsky reveals his underlying goal: to link the cause of Dia- spora Nationalism in Eastern Europe to that of Zionist statehood in Palestine. The Balfour Declaration had granted Jews their lawful rights to territorial nation- hood in Palestine. Their parallel rights to autonomous nationhood in Eastern Europe, however, still eluded them.23 Despite this novel linkage, Janowsky 's model of Jewish nationalism still rested on the same assumption of American Jewish exceptionalism held by other American Zionists of his day. From World War I on, the Brandeis school of Zionism had claimed that Jews could thrive under conditions of American democracy, but that less fortu- nate brethren elsewhere needed a national homeland. This "long-distance national- ism" was explicitly framed as a form of civic philanthropy and enlightened advocacy that complemented, rather than challenged, American liberalism.24 Simi- larly, Janowsky's two-chambered Jewish nationalism effectively split America and Eastern Europe even as he linked them. Even while claiming that Diaspora Nation- alism had profound "national implications" for all Jews, he stressed that the political rights in question applied only to the Jewish struggle for national autonomy in Eastern Europe, not elsewhere in Western Europe or North America.25 22.

Most critics recognized his scholarly achievement but contested his characterization of the American Jewish struggle for East European Jewish minority rights at Paris. Thus, Melvin Fagen of the American Jewish Committee disputed that "assimilationist" American and British Jewish leaders had resisted supporting the political interests of East European Jewry. Western representatives did, in fact, promote "minority rights" regarding Jewish language and culture in Eastern Europe, Fagen concluded in a 1935 book review. They simply rejected "national rights," because "they did not confuse the desire to retain a traditional group-culture with a political program designed to set them apart from their neighbors, to make them what they are not and cannot be - a political division [on the basis of] already outworn ideas of a political nationalism that defied reality."26 Morris Waldman, executive director of the American Jewish Committee, castigated the book's subjective distortions and "unveiled contempt" for Western Jewish leadership: "Since Janowsky is writing a history and not a polemic he does not express his views directly in his description of the course of events which led to the Minorities Treaties. But his sympathies for Jewish nationalism are threaded throughout the fabric of his work." To Waldman, Janowsky's call for "political autonomy" for East European Jews was a "dangerous" form of Jewish nationalism, "which reduced to elemen- tary terms is the Nazi theory that we Jews are aliens in the countries in which we live."27 In reply to his critics, Janowsky consistently defended his scholarly objec- tivity. Yet he also clearly relished the fight with his ideological opponents.28 More importantly, he sought out and received the positive endorsements of promi- nent American Zionists, such as Julian Mack, Felix Frankfurter, Brandeis, and Kallen. The latter two men went even further, proposing that the American Jewish Congress send Janowsky to Europe for the 1935-1936 academic year to research the current status of Jews and other national minorities under the League of Nations system. Janowsky eagerly assented. Before he had finalized his plans, however, a surprising offer arrived from his ideological rivals at the American Jewish Committee. They asked him to prepare a report on diplomatic efforts and international law regarding the status of minorities, particularly Jews, in Germany. The Committee's aim was to produce a substantial monograph to be released in conjunction with the public resignation of James McDonald, the 26. Fagen, "Review," 4(MU. 27.

II. Autonomy in Eastern Europe, Sovereignty in Palestine Janowsky's European journey over the course of 1935 and 1936 coincided with the moment when prospects for Diaspora Nationalism were in rapid decline. Nazi Germany had quit the League of Nations and enacted the first of the Nurem- berg Laws; Poland had likewise withdrawn from its Minority Treaty and suc- cumbed to a right-wing military dictatorship. The Comité des Délégations Juives, an Autonomist organization that nominally represented European Jewish political interests to the League of Nations, had fallen apart following the death of Leo Motzkin in 1933. Its successor organization, the World Jewish Congress, had yet to come into existence. Chaos in the international Jewish political world and the grave situation of European Jewry therefore posed an acute test to Janowsky's political ideas. However, his European sojourn only reinforced his conviction that autonomy in Eastern Europe and sovereignty in Palestine should go hand in hand. Traveling armed with an array of academic, press, and U.S. diplomatic cre- dentials, Janowsky traversed much of the continent, including Poland, Czechoslo- vakia, Hungary, Romania, and Greece. The results were issued in rapid succession: International Aspects of German Racial Policies (1937), co-written with his erstwhile critic, Melvin Fagen, a sober study of the legal and political status of minorities under Nazi persecution, and People at Bay: The Jewish Problem in East-Central Europe (1938), an .unflinching country-by-country account of Jewish suffering under fascism, right-wing nationalism, and anti- Semitism.32 As these books make plain, Janowsky harbored few illusions about the enormous dangers confronting European Jews and the fundamental obstacles to Jewish physical survival, let alone national political life, even before the war began. Still, he declined to endorse the conventional Zionist view of emigration as the obvious solution to the crisis. In the conclusion to People at Bay, he 29.

While a Jewish "national homeland" was certainly a positive desideratum, it rep- resented only one of a number of "palliatives and partial solutions." These included the economic reconstruction of European Jewish life, large-scale emigra- tion to the West, and a "United Jewish Representation" to represent the Jews of Europe in the same way the Jewish Agency operated on behalf of those in Palestine.33 The events of World War II did little to weaken Janowsky's firm adherence to a dual vision of Jewish national autonomy in Eastern Europe and national state- hood in Palestine. In a 1943 article on "Jewish Rights in the Postwar World," he offered a simple prescription: "In multi-national states, principally those of Eastern Europe, the Jews would constitute a minority nationality with political as well as cultural implications. And in Palestine, the Jews should be a territorial nation."34 However, the dichotomy between these two entities would not necessarily be symmetrical, since a "Jewish Homeland implies - definitely demands - a status for the Palestinian Jews radically different from that obtaining in any other country. . . . Palestine alone offers the promise of a full and unhindered develop- ment of Jewish life. Everywhere else the Jews can only constitute a minority; at best their institutions can only be supplementary to the all-embracing culture of the country."35 In Palestine, Jewish national life would thrive to its fullest extent. So too would Jewish territorial sovereignty remove "the veil of anonymity from the Jewish people," assuring dignity of status, national equality, and "stand- ing in the world community."36 The hierarchy between statehood in Palestine and nonterritorial autonomy in Eastern Europe points to a deeper tension in Janowsky's model. On the one hand, in his wartime writings he frequently depicted an independent Jewish state as the ultimate prize in international politics. His privileging of Jewish sover- eignty reflected classical Zionist tenets regarding the superiority of statist, territor- ial nationalism over any other kind of Diasporic Jewish political arrangement. On the other hand, he criticized those Zionists who focused exclusively on Palestine as the sole location for Jewish national life. For both practical and ideological reasons, he concluded in a 1943 essay, "Zionism does not presume to have found the complete solution of the Jewish problem."37 Moreover, he argued else- where that, in order to secure peace in regions of multiple nationalities, conven- tional sovereignty should be replaced with a new model of "cultural pluralism." The conflict between these two positions naturally comes to a head in Janowsky's treatment of Palestinian Arab nationalism. 33. Janowsky, People at Bay, 161, 183-87. 34.

Many argued that a shared framework of national federalism provided the only sol- ution to the equally just national claims of Arabs and Jews. Faced with the specter of binationalism in Palestine, Janowsky concluded that it represented Utopian fantasy incompatible with both the moral claims and political necessities of Zionism. Instead, he suggested, Zionists should pursue "a bi-national regime in which the Jewish majority forms a Jewish State, but the Arab minority continues to function as a nationality [with] not only civil and political equality but also recognition as a national community worthy of official sanction of its language, its religious and edu- cational institutions, and its customs and ways of life." The "bi-national" character of this state should not translate into political parity between the two nations: Thus the issue is not bi-nationalism versus the Jewish state. The issue is a Jewish state with a bi-nationalist constitution versus a Jewish-Arab state. . . . In the final solution - the determination of the political form of Palestine after the transition period - minority status for the Jews of Palestine must be ruled out as inconsistent with the conception of a Jewish National Homeland.38 Diaspora Nationalism thus offered a solution to Zionism's Arab dilemma. If auton- omy can satisfy Jewish national demands as a minority population in the multina- tional states of Eastern Europe, where Polish, Romanian, and other forms of conservative nationalism are unlikely to vanish, it can surely rise to the task for the Arabs of Palestine. The Jews of Eastern Europe will therefore benefit from the international prestige and political clout of Zionist sovereignty; at the same time, their own national minority experience will help make the case that an Arab minority can thrive in a majority- Jewish nation-state. III. From Minority Rights to Human Rights As word of the Holocaust spread in American society over the course of World War II, many Jewish political thinkers abandoned the idea of minority rights, dismissing them as an utter political failure. Janowsky, however, took the opposite stance. Rather than merely champion national-cultural autonomy for postwar East European Jews, he now argued more broadly that the Jewish case was the exception that would create the new rule in international relations. "In our own day of intense and almost universal national consciousness," he explained in a 1942 volume entitled Strategy for Democracy, "[we] must recognize that in regions of mixed nationality, liberty and equality can be realized only by the exten- sion of religious pluralism into cultural pluralism."39 The ideal model for political 38.

Under the interwar Minorities Treaties system, Janowsky noted, national minorities within given countries technically did not possess affirmative national rights as a group, but only as individuals. Hence the Jews could not petition the League of Nations directly for redress of violations of their collective rights. These two problems could be resolved, Janowsky believed, through instituting the principle of "cultural pluralism" as a constitutional apparatus within individual states together with a new kind of League of Nations, featuring an international "tribunal representing the various national units and the minorities" of the world to which any "aggrieved minority" might turn for redress.41 Janowsky 's optimistic view of national-cultural autonomy as both a Jewish and general postwar political solution stemmed from his wartime involvement in the newly reenergized liberal internationalist circles that had sprung up among American intellectuals and academics, particularly in New York City.42 During the war, organizations such as the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Commission to Study the Organization of Peace (CSOP) proposed a renewed multilateralism in American foreign policy. They promoted the idea of a new international political organization with global legal authority to ensure world peace, collective security, and international protection of minorities.43 Janowsky began his association with the CSOP early in 1940 and continued to par- ticipate in working groups, policy planning conferences, and publication projects throughout the war.44 In the spring of 1945, the CSOP published Janowsky 's major foreign policy study, Nationalities and National Minorities (with Special Reference to East-Central Europe), with a foreword contributed by its leader, James Shotwell.45 In Nationalities and National Minorities, Janowsky argued that the era of the sovereign national state had ended in Eastern Europe. It would be replaced, he posited, by a system of multiethnic states in which minorities peacefully 40. Ibid., 114. 41. Ibid., 110. 42.

As proof of viability of this new model of multiethnic states, he pointed specifically to Switzerland, the Soviet Union, and South Africa (though he conceded the obvious weaknesses of the latter two).46 Undeterred by his awareness of the war's genocidal impact on Jewish life, Janowsky still predicted a significant Jewish place in the postwar pol- itical order: Many Jews will undoubtedly remain in east-central Europe. Though reduced in numbers and impoverished, they should be assured not special privileges, but a status of equality with other nationality groups. If the end of the war finds some settled in compact masses on a definite territory, they should enjoy national and territorial autonomy like other similar peoples. If they survive only as small and scattered communities, national-cultural autonomy should place them on an equal footing with other minorities. In either case, they should be an integral part of the structure of the state.47 In writing these words in the spring of 1945, Janowsky was not alone among American Jews in advocating a renewal of Jewish life in Eastern Europe with some form of group rights. Most American Zionists continued to assert that, in theory, Jews should retain at least the same cultural and linguistic rights they had under the Minorities Treaties after the war.48 Organizations such as the World Jewish Congress and the Jewish Labor Committee advocated a more affir- mative platform of national minority rights. Janowsky took a similarly maximalist line in his policy-planning work with the CSOP. In particular he focused on the new United Nations human rights program as the vehicle through which to finally secure Jewish autonomy in Eastern Europe. Over the course of 1943 and 1944, Janowsky co-authored the CSOP's report, "International Safeguard of Human Rights" and lobbied the State Depart- ment on the organization's behalf.49 As a result, he initially placed high hopes in 46.

He was, therefore, bitterly disappointed to witness the express shift away from minority rights to human rights in the 1945 United Nations Charter.50 To his thinking, the political change severely undermined chances for rethinking the nation-state and nationalism in a way that was vital to global Jewish interests and world peace as a whole. Even more galling, the new frame- work of human rights discarded an affirmative right to national-cultural autonomy. Its replacement, a universal yet nonbinding system offering protection of individ- uals from discrimination, ignored the sociopolitical realities of Eastern Europe. It also severely challenged his vision of East European Autonomism as a vehicle for American Jewish nationalism. "Today, 'minority rights' are as passé as the boyish bob," lamented Janowsky in a 1946 article. Rather than a victory for international democracy, the new UN Charter represents a "catastrophic retreat" and "retrogression in the struggle for human rights." "'Minority rights' were not an alternative to 'human rights' but their fulfillment," Janowsky argued, "the culmination of at least a century of repeated international efforts to protect human rights."51 Strikingly, the party he identified as most responsible for this political debacle was neither the CSOP nor the U.S. State Department, but the American Jewish Committee. The group had hailed the new human rights vision as "the best protection for Jews is the security of all human beings and the enforcement of their fundamental rights [as individuals]."52 Janowsky mocked this claim as Utopian and "assimila- tionist."53 Though evidently aware of the larger political forces at work in the shift from minority rights to human rights, he still insisted on interpreting 1945 as an ironic repetition of the drama of Paris in 1919. Both at the Paris Peace Conference and at the San Francisco United Nations Conference twenty-five years later, he wrote, American Jewish "assimilationists" successfully undermined the cause of Jewish minority nationalism.54 Janowsky 's impulse to blame American Jews for the decline of national- cultural autonomy in international relations exposed the dilemma at the root of 50.

As his charged critique of the American Jewish Committee suggested, the quest for Jewish minority rights in Eastern Europe was not simply a valuable political end in and of itself. Rather, it served in his mind as the means of defining a Jewish national consciousness in the otherwise liberal context of American society. Yet all of the ire he directed at the American Jewish Committee's antina- tionalism belied his own reluctance to embrace a more direct language of nation- alism with reference to American Jews. In fact, Janowsky's own conflicted attitude toward American Jewish collective identity eroded much of the force of his own political argument. Janowsky's writings about American Jewish identity offer a revealing coda to his lost battle for Diaspora Nationalism, for they highlight the underlying thread of American Jewish exceptionalism that runs throughout his work. IV. The American Jew. From "Nationality" to "Community" The question of American Jewish identity first appeared explicitly in Janowsky's 1940 article, "The Status of Minorities in a Democracy," published in The Reconstructionist. There he contrasted the Jewish situation in the United States with that of Eastern Europe, explaining that American Jews need not seek national-cultural autonomy: "In our broad American democracy there is room and to spare for Jewish group life. But we must realize that, unlike Eastern Europe, American minority groups will cultivate their historical traditions as a secondary or supplementary culture, maintained and furthered on a voluntary non-political basis."55 On the surface, Janowsky's language suggested that Amer- ican Jews should abandon any national self-definition - let alone political aspira- tions - given the dictates of American democracy. This placed him, ironically, in the same camp as his antinationalist foes. Yet even as he conceded the inadequacy of traditional "national" and "political" labels for American Jewish collective identity, he still sought to preserve a model of tangible Jewish nationhood compa- tible with political liberalism. In his 1942 anthology The American Jew, a collec- tion of scholarly essays edited by Janowsky, he tackled the question of nomenclature directly. Writing in the book's conclusion, he cautioned that it was incorrect to refer to American Jews as a "national" group. Rather, they were better termed a "spiritual-cultural group," for whom Jewish group life was entirely voluntary and secondary to their fundamental Americanness.56 However, in the 55.

There has been much confusion in the use of the words "nation," "nationality" and "community." The term "nation" signifies a political state. Obviously, the fifteen or sixteen million Jews of the world do not constitute a state. The pol- itical allegiance of every Jew is to the country of his citizenship The word "nationality" is the English equivalent of the French nationalité and the German nationalitaet, which connote, not political allegiance, but spiritual and cultural affinity. . . . Since the term "nationality" has not gained wide cur- rency in the United States, the word "people" might perhaps better character- ize this conception. The Scotch and Welsh are nationalities or peoples within the British nation. Their political allegiance is indivisible, but they are con- scious of specialized cultural loyalties. Likewise, the American Jews, whose political loyalty is exclusively to the United States, recognize a religious and cultural relationship with Jews in other parts of the world. . . . There is, then, a Jewish nationality, or a Jewish people.57 Despite his attempt at clarifying the semantics of nation and nationality, Janowsky was incorrect in claiming that nationality or its French or German caiques were devoid of political significance. So, too, did his postulation that nation only meant state fly in the face of his own earlier arguments about the nature of East European society and Jews therein. Instead, his semantic contor- tions reflected his wishful thinking regarding the struggle to define Jewish nation- alism in the American context. Invoking a "Jewish nationality" was his attempt at reaffirming Jewish nationhood while also theorizing out of existence any possible tension between Jewish nationalism and American liberalism.58 Envisioning Jewishness in America as a purely voluntary, substate affair, more akin to a historic, affective bond, than a formal, state-level political status, Janowsky faced the perennial modern challenge of maintaining an otherwise unbounded Jewish identity in an open, liberal society.59 The dilemma became even more acute after 1948, when the ideological debates about Zionism in the American Jewish world rapidly subsided. As the reality of the State of Israel, the Cold War, and internal racial tensions in the United States all materialized, American Jews shifted decisively toward a model of ethnic solidarity and commu- nal philanthropy rather than overt political nationalism. Even the American Jewish Committee, Janowsky's favorite opponent, abruptly made peace with Zionism. In 57. Janowsky, "Conclusion," 254. 58. Janowsky s attempt at distinguishing between "nation" and "nationality" evidently derived from his contemporary rereading of Brandeis's own explanation. In 1940, Janowsky wrote the introduc- tion to a reissue of Brandeis's 1915 pamphlet. See Oscar Janowsky, "Introduction," in Louis Brandeis, The Jewish Problem and How to Solve It, ed. O.

In the late 1940s and 1950s, he led two massive national survey projects - the Jewish Welfare Board Survey, a three-year sociological study (1945-1947) of Jewish communal life, and the Commission for the Study of Jewish Education in the United States (1952-1957).60 In each case, he jostled publicly with those leaders whom he termed "assimilationists." He reserved his greatest scorn for his scholarly opponents, criticizing sociologists Louis Wirth and Arnold Rose and historian Oscar Handlin as openly hostile to the value of Jewish peoplehood.61 Looking back decades later, Janowsky claimed victory in the postwar fight with "assimilationists" who sought to undermine the Jewish people. After the struggles over Zionism and Diaspora Nationalism, American Jewish identity rep- resented the last frontier in need of defense from the errant proponents of liberal universalism. However, his postwar communal activities on behalf of education and communal relations were a far cry from the vigorous, globally engaged pol- itical nationalism he espoused during the 1930s and 1940s. Language was again a key factor in this change.62 Even as he fiercely argued in the 1950s against other scholars who claimed American Jews were not a "minority group," he con- ceded that "American Jews do not constitute a minority in the East European sense of the term" and that the term national did not quite apply to their identity.63 By 1964, in the sequel volume to The American Jew, he had even abandoned the term nationality when referring to American Jews. Reluctantly, he instead opted for the muted term community to describe American Jews as a group. Despite the fact that they possess "neither a representative spokesman nor a central address," he wrote, the term community indicated that "the great majority [of Jews] have a sense of belonging together, with common interests which are served by special organiz- ations and institutions."64 Addressing the fate of interwar Diaspora Nationalism, Hannah Arendt wrote in 1940 that the only way to turn Jewish "minority rights" in Europe into a viable 60.

He sought to link Eastern Europe and Palestine in a vision of Jewish nationhood that blended national autonomy with national sovereignty. Neither precluded the other. In fact, the claims to nationhood in each political context reinforced one another in a complementary fashion. But the emphasis on political nationhood, legally recognized, in Europe and Palestine only exacerbated the tension when it came to the United States. For Janowsky was unwilling to assign American Jews a national political identity of their own. In the end, Janowsky's brand of American Jewish nationalism lived and died by its American Jewish exceptionalism. Much as he aggressively spoke the language of Jewish nationhood in the American context in the 1930s and 1940s, he carefully emphasized that neither minority rights nor territorial sover- eignty applied to American Jewry. Indeed, together with his fellow American Jewish nationalists and rival antinationalists, he shared the belief that Jews as a group should remain invisible to the American state. He steadfastly resisted any concept of American Jews as a distinct juridical or political category. The very expansiveness of his nuanced Jewish nationalism, coupled with a firm embrace of liberalism, made it difficult to articulate what Jewish nationhood actually meant in the American context. If Jews formed one global nation, why did only those in Eastern Europe and Palestine require state-level national recognition? And if the sole purpose of American Jewish nationalism was to secure Jewish autonomy in Eastern Europe and sovereignty in Palestine, what need was there for such a political ideology after Zionism's postwar triumph and Diaspora Nation- alism's precipitous decline?66 Ultimately, Oscar Janowsky's American vision of Diaspora Nationalism represented an attempt to bridge the classic divide between nationalism and liber- alism in modern Jewish political thought. His goal was not to challenge the Zionist vision of Jewish nationalism as a project of territorial sovereignty but to comp- lement it with a Diasporic strain of national-cultural autonomy. In doing so, he sought to forge a middle space between the extremes of Jewish political life in Palestine and the United States. By expanding the notion of Jewish nationalism to include Eastern Europe as a secondary national homeland alongside Palestine, 65.

Feldman (New York: Schocken Books, 2007): 126-29. 66. Writing at the same time, an otherwise sympathetic colleague of Janowsky explained this dilemma in these terms: "There is no such thing as separate nationalisms reserved for the Polish, the Rumanian, the Russian Jews from which the American Jews can claim exemption. Either there is one Jewish people or there is none."

What he found instead was a now-familiar paradox: mid-twentieth-century American Jews recoiled from the language of nationalism even as they enthusiastically sup- ported nationalist political aspirations abroad. Zionism appealed to them precisely because it concentrated Jewish national politics within the territory of the sover- eign Jewish state. Any attempt to blur the ideological lines between nationalism and liberalism or separate the nation from the state in the manner of Diaspora Nationalism threatened this neat ideological dichotomy. Even as American Jews continued to focus on the Jews of Eastern Europe in the second half of the twen- tieth century, they advocated not minority rights but national repatriation to the Jewish homeland. Political life could no longer take place outside the confines of American liberalism or Jewish territorial nationalism. As the United States and Israel emerged as the two poles in the American Jewish political imagination, the former space between them, both geographic and metaphorical, vanished.
