<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael M. Laskier. The Jews of the Maghrib in the Shadow of Vichy and the Swastika. Publications of the Diaspora Research Institute, Book 80. Tel-Aviv: Diaspora Research Institute, 1992. vii, 376 pp. (Hebrew). Within the field of Holocaust studies, growing attention is being paid to the condition of Jews outside Europe. This includes some Mediterranean basin countries which were ruled by regimes under strong German influence and which developed their own legislation, methods, and institutions to deal with the "Jewish Question." Thus, Italy from 1938 had its racial anti-Semitic legislation and policies, followed by Vichy France from 1940. In both cases, the attitude towards the Jews was shaped by German pressure as well as by local traditions and conditions in the two countries and in the African and Asian countires under their control. In this Hebrew-language book, Michael Laskier surveys the condition of the Jews of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia during World War II, and presents eighty five documents. A short bibliography, indexes of places and persons, and a summary in English (pp. v-vii) are included. The survey (pp. 11-113) contains an introduction and four chapters. Laskier regards as his contributions to the field a) the use of sources which had not been consulted in the past, b) the inclusion of Tangiers and Spanish Morocco, and c) a comparison of the condition of North African Jewries with that of the Jews of Libya and the Middle East. The first chapter deals with the legal and social status of the Maghrebi Jews on the eve of the German conquest of France. This is followed by an examination of the Maghrebi Jews in 1939-1943 and the anti-Jewish attitude and legislation of the Vichy regime. The third chapter deals with the role of Vichy in Morocco and Algeria and the German invasion of Tunisia and their influence on Zionist activities. The last chapter compares North African and Middle Eastern Jewries with respect to their political and social status, reaction to anti-Semitism, and relations with the Jews in Palestine.</page><page sequence="2">244 BOOK REVIEWS But the main importance of the book rests with the documents (pp. 123-360), which are mainly from Jewish and French state archives. All are given in Hebrew (original or translation) and are annotated (giving primarily data on persons, places, and organizations). The documents provide valuable and hitherto mostly unpublished material on racial legislation and attitudes of the Vichy government, Free France, Germany, and American authorities regarding Maghrebi Jews, as well as information on Jewish communal affairs. Most of the documents provide the anti-Jewish legislation in the French Maghreb (based mainly on the Bulletin de la Fideration des Socidtis Juives d'Algeirie). Also included are statistics, data on internal affairs, and activities of Jewish Palestinian soldiers and emissaries and their contributions to the enhanced spread of Zionism. Although the late reenactment of the Cremieux decree, providing the Algerian Jews French citizenship, is referred to in the survey, its text is not provided, and the documents hardly deal with Betar and Revisionist Zionism which were strong in the region. The benefit one could get from these documents could increase with a more rigorous editing. For example, document #43 (pp. 246-248) deals with Tripoli, Libya, during February-July 1944 and not with Tunis: this is evident from the context and the fact that its author, Naftali Bar-Giyora, was in Tripoli during that period; the original mentions only a code name-Tveryah-referring to Tripoli. The cross-references between the documents and the survey are often too broad, mentioning only the chapter and issue (e.g., p. 217, n. 2)-the index is of little help in this matter, because it lists only persons and places. The transliteration of Arabic terms and names is apparently based on the French, and results in some odd orthography, even when taking into consideration the unique Maghrebi pronounciation (e.g., the Muslim month Dha al-Hijjah is rendered as ,t"A, [pp. 131, 138]; some place names on p. 297 are mistransliterated; and the letters t0 and n are sometimes mixed). At times, the Hebrew translation is archaic, and it would have been helpful to add the original terminology (e.g., murshey ha-memshalah [p. 220], 'amarkalim [p. 221]) or unidiomatic (e.g., 'imahotenu [p. 230]). The Biblical term Pehah was not the one used in Morocco, and its use in the text and in the list of terms (p. 361, with the definition: the governor of the town Morocco) are misleading. Some remarks relating to the documents are not clear; thus, on pp. 236 and 238 it is stated that a large part of the material was rephrased without changing its meaning and some parts were omitted-does this refer to the original files or done by Laskier? The statement that there are various conflicting</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 245 studies relating the possibility that the Germans prepared extermination plans in Tunisia (p. 239), should be substantiated, as the controversial issue of Judenrat with regards to Tunisia (p. 236). It would have been helpful to cite major works on Meghrebi communities or individuals when data on these were provided (e.g., Daniel Schroeter's book on Mogador [p. 157]). Some entries which are neither place nor personal names are included in the indexes (e.g., Palcor is a news agency and not a place name; Shaykh al-Madinah is a title and not a person's name). Some works are mentioned in the text, at times in an abbreviated form, but not in the bibliography (e.g., p. 23, n. 29; p. 24 [al-Kholti], p. 53 [Ghoul, Senousi, Ibn al-Hujjah], etc.). The documents are listed on pp. 115-118, without page numbers; their inclusion, following the table of contents, would facilitate location of the material. The above remarks notwithstanding, Laskier has published an informative survey and an interesting collection. His main contribution is making these important documents available under one cover, mainly to Hebrew readers, demonstrating the dangers the Maghrebi Jews faced during World War II.
