Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996. 256 pp. Lawrence Hoffman's study of circumcision is ostensibly trying to respond to the question: why do we have this rite, antiquated and difficult as it is? In other words, Hoffman, who is a Reform Jew, asks why Reform Judaism sustained this practice when it denied a place to so many other unfashionable practices. He attempts a systematic study of the rite from a number of vantage points. Hoffman draws on sociology, anthropology, philology, history, and anec- dotal evidence in his study of circumcision. However, none of these forays into the subject is treated with any rigor; thus, the better-trained reader learns little, and the casual reader cannot effectively process the information he provides. What emerges are highly tendentious readings of rabbinic literature using primarily anthropological categories. Levi-Strauss, Mary Douglas, and a number of others are granted divine status in Hoffman's cosmos. He constructs an approach to circumcision that for him represents the most important insight into the rabbinic world. He claims that a quest for order defines the entire halakhic system of the Talmud. His theories rest on a simplistic reading of the material: the blood of circumcision is an act which is controlled; that is, the mohel makes an incision on the infant for a defined time and stops the blood from flowing heavily. The site of the incision is also relevant because sexual regulation is a marker of control of the passions in righteous men. For example, Hoffman notes that Joseph's control of his sexual desires, that is, the blood flow of sexual desire, in the house of Potiphar, was highlighted as righteousness par excellence in midrash and in kabbalistic literature. The blood of circumcision is typical of the male place in the halakhic world. This is so because males control the environment of circumcision by drawing blood at a specific time at will. In contrast, the blood of the menstruating woman is an aspect of the uncontrolled nature of women, their rawness and their naturalness. Hoffman notes that women's issues are compared by the rabbis to vines without limits. His taxonomy of the differences is worthwhile citing: "What interests us is the fact that dichotomies of nature/culture, women/men, and wild/controlled are symbolized by the archetypical blood of the two sexes. The essence of circumcision is the willful and controlled drawing of blood according to the Toraitic command, that is,</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 257 according to cultural dictates. Women, on the other hand, are characterized by blood that flows naturally, uncontrolled by culture" (pp. 167-168). The implications of this rather exaggerated notion of physiology is that women are prohibited from time-bound positive commandments (p. 165). Hoffman summarizes: ". .. the entire rabbinic system is based on a sociology of order in which it is men's role to impose order on human affairs, paralleling a male God's primeval act of ordering the cosmos. The halakhah is nothing if not the system of imposing order on creation" (p. 156). Hoffman's comparison between the two bloods is not supported by rabbinic readings and in essence operates only as a construct in Hoffman's own highly idiosyncratic reading. The blood of niddah is just one of the many flows which are treated in the Bible. Both the zav and the zavah are problems of purity in the life of Israel. Hoffman, to his credit, cites Jacob Milgram's credible interpretation of the biblical record. However, he claims that the system which operates in the Bible differs from the mishnaic tradition (pp. 147-148). This is simply not the case. He offers only his own and Howard Eilberg-Schwartz's interpretation as evidence for a different reading. Further, if control is associated with blood, Hoffman should realize that the woman is in control of her own sexual life. The Bible says she is to count her niddah, this places the burden of responsibility in the woman's world. In my view, "control" is simply too vague an issue to determine on the basis of every halakhah. It is all too easy to interpret control in every act, and it leads to misrepresentations of the system as a whole. In this reviewer's opinion, Hoffman misinterprets the Talmud and its commentators when he maintains that the tosafists argued with the Talmud, when in fact they explain the text. His claim that the Talmud (Kiddushin 52b) prevented women from entering the Temple courtyard, whereas the tosafists permitted it, misses the point. What the tosafists explain, in fact, is that the Talmud prevented women from entering the courtyard only for purposes of betrothal, since this could have infringed upon the dignity of the holy Temple. Hoffman is on slippery ground when he tries to date the blessing on the wine to geonic times (with its first appearance in Seder Ray Amram). This fallacy, common in Jewish Studies, aims to date a certain saying or act to the person relating it. However, there is no way of telling if there were blessings prior to this date; we are only in possession of the record for the geonic period. Highly tendentious also is his reading of the wine given to the woman to drink. He associates it with salvation and sees Christian aspects to this component (another Hoffmanesque reading which is not borne out by any</page><page sequence="3">258 BOOK REVIEWS source material). He claims that the wine is associated with women because it is blood. However, as he is well aware, and brings a number of proofs to this effect, the husband or child drinks the wine also. If this is so, the symbol of blood = wine is no longer operative. Hoffman is too eager to fit everything into one neat unit. He extends his critique of blood so far as to suggest that "the blood of circumcision thus functioned as an iconic marker in opposition to the blood of menstruation to differentiate the genders in rabbinic Judaism" (p. 190). This is an extraordinary oversimplification of the rabbinic system. Man cannot live by blood alone, and neither should an anthropologesque scholar of liturgy.
