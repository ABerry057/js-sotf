<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Robert G. Boling and G. Ernest Wright. Joshua. Anchor Bible, vol. 6. Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1982. xix, 580 pp., with 4 pl. and 11 maps. Because they have in theory been directed to a wide public, the Anchor Bible commentaries have sometimes proved undistinguished without offer- ing much assistance to readers unschooled in the ways of professional scholarship. With Joshua, this is not the case. George Ernest Wright's posthumous introduction (he was assigned the volume originally) will immediately assume a place in the history of scholarship as a clarion of Albright school orthodoxy on the Israelite conquest and the composition of the Former Prophets. It nevertheless lays out the issues in a form accessible to the uninitiated. And Robert Boling's commentary, with its repeated adversions to the rhetorical structure of the book as a whole, will wear the years better than most volumes in the Anchor series. Boling's commentary is most valuable when communicating the results of archaeological inquiry. One segment (pp. 251-254) correlates architec- tural phases at Shechem to sociopolitical organization: the abandonment of the royal chapel in the mid-sixteenth century led supposedly to non- monarchic government later in that century, and to a covenantal relation- ship with outlying populations in the fourteenth century, when unwalled villages proliferate in Canaan's central ridges. Boling plausibly relates Shechem's destruction by Abimelech (Judges 9) to Shiloh's rise in the later 111</page><page sequence="2">112 BOOK REVIEWS premonarchic period, and Shiloh's destruction (ca. 1050) to Gilgal's rise in Saul's day. Equally fruitful are the excavation and survey results he brings to bear on the conquest narratives (chaps. 10-12, pp. 278-329). These illuminate both the history and the history of the traditions that the narra- tives embody. Throughout, Boling's amply deployed archaeological exper- tise provides precisely the service that this most geographical of biblical books demands. Boling is also commendably conscientious with the text. Copious critical notes, rendered accessible to the interested nonprofessional, make the case for and against every disputable reading Boling adopts by tracing the variants' origins. Refreshingly, Boling throws his hands into the air when the evidence does not warrant conviction. The intellectual honesty marks his archaeological discussions-evidence inimical to his own position (such as the absence of Iron I settlement at Gibeon, p. 262) is neither suppressed nor cloaked, but flatly stated. Wright (pp. 37-72) and Boling (pp. 132-135) embrace the theory of a Deuteronomistic History (Deuteronomy and the Former Prophets) origin- ating in Josiah's court (Dtr-1) and revised in exile (Dtr-2). Boling assigns texts to one or the other edition: his Dtr-1 portrayed a lightning conquest, his Dtr-2 a conquest by stages; and Dtr-2 is the fount of those terms (such as edah, nasi) that scholars characterize as "priestly." This enterprise, however, is not pursued overzealously, taking into its purview prior sources or the implications of Dtr-2's "priestly" language for the sociology of doctrine in Jerusalem: the endeavor is too treacherous, and it is to Boling's credit that he does not clutter the commentary with extensive ruminations concerning the authorship of each text. With Wright, he denies the presence of pentateuchal sources and eschews the comprehensive discussion of composition history (recently, N. K. Gottwald's Tribes of Yahweh, pp. 146-186), best reserved to a separate monograph. As a document in the history of criticism, the commentary's most marked feature is the influence of George Mendenhall. Boling echoes Mendenhall's penchant for Luwians (pp. 280, 305, etc.); even for Simeon, a normal hypocoristicon from some such name as Ishamael: "A Semitic explanation of the name is uncertain. It has been provisionally related to the Anatolian place name Samhuna. Mendenhall, Ten Gen, 163 n. 62" (p. 436). But it is Mendenhall's theory that the conquest was a "peasants' revolt" that has had a prodigious impact both on Wright (pp. 80-84) and on Boling (pp. 128-132). For Wright especially, formerly a staunch advocate of</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 113 Albright's "lightning conquest" theory, this represents a formidable volte- face. The "conquest" reconstruction accommodates itself easily to the "revolt." Boling sees Yahwism as a response to Late Bronze Baal devotion. He associates the Levites with the Exodus (as though dealing with Alt's "infiltration" hypothesis and figuring which tribes arrived when); they "formed the militant core, and earliest leadership, in the religious move- ment" (pp. 251 f.). And he comments, after Joshua 11, "It was a new day in Galilee, the beginning of a period when ... it would be safe to live in unwalled villages, until ... tax collectors [again became] a common sight, coming this time from Jerusalem" (p. 311). Here, Mendenhall's antimonar- chic sentiments surface, dismissing the political and economic realities that determined governmental organization as irrelevant to communal justice (doubly ironic in that Mendenhall's standards today would demand big government, not anarchism). But apart from this deliberate naivete (also regarding the "oppressions" of the "judges" period), neither Wright nor Boling modifies the old Albrightian conquest theory much in order to incorporate Mendenhall's view. The circumstance that explains the easy marriage of Albright's "con- quest" to Mendenhall's "revolt" has gone largely unremarked. The revolt hypothesis, though shifting the emphasis, still turns on the invasion under Joshua: Mendenhall spotlights Canaan's putative receptivity to Israel's irruption. But the operative force for change, the historically crucial event around which the reconstruction ultimately centers, is still the invasion of Joshua 1-11. There are serious flaws in Mendenhall's scenario-there is no evidence of peasant flight to the hills; Mendenhall's evidence is valid only for the latifundia, which all scholars concede fell last; and the "egalitarian- ism" that Mendenhall thinks was spawned by oppression in hierarchical city-states is thought to have endured the reformation of hill-country community relations, where ideology apparently no longer responds to changing economic circumstances (that is, the concept of the relationship between ideology and context is somewhat simplistic). But even if all Mendenhall's disenfranchised peasants did rise to greet the invaders, it remains the Israel entering from Transjordan that introduced Yahwism and the covenant into Canaan. The weaknesses of Mendenhall's hypothesis affect this commentary only marginally. But the hypothesis' presence indicates the extent to which it has penetrated the intellectual market. Boling's commentary will prove the</page><page sequence="4">114 BOOK REVIEWS popular English-language resource for the Book of Joshua for the rest of this decade and much of the next. It incidentally documents the fact that the revolt hypothesis will occupy the pages of scholarly journals for the same term. The book is furnished with extensive indices.
