Gottlieb World Jewry is divisible into two major groups of tradition based on geographic and historical considerations: Eastern or Sephardi and Western or Ashkenazi. They differ in their rites of prayer, customs, and also in many points of Jewish law. Moreover, their pronunciation of Hebrew in the synago gue differs as well. This situation leads to a practical question: May one elect to change his pronunciation of Hebrew from one tradition to the other? More to the point, as we shall see, may one change from the Ashkenazi (Western) to the Sephardi (Eastern)?1 On the face of it, this is strictly a matter of halakhah (Jewish law). But we will argue that the number of responsa written in the last seventy years that address this question and the highly charged attitudes expressed or implied in them reveal much more than law alone. Responsa in general, we will claim, should be examined through the lenses of the social sciences because they stand at the convergence of sociology and 1. Previous discussion of responsa about differences in pronunciation can be found in Hirsch Jakob Zimmels, Ashkenazim and Sephardim: Their Relations, Differences, and Problems as Reflected in the Rabbinical Responsa (Gregg: London, 1958), 82-90; and Shimon Sharvit, "Mivta'eha shel ha-'Ivrit le-'or ha-sifrut ha-rabbanit le-doroteha," in Sefer Shivtiel: Mehkarim ba-lashon ha-Tvrit u-ve-masoret ha- 'edot, ed. Isaac Gluska and Tsemah Kessar (Tel Aviv: Association for Society and Culture and Afiqim, 1992), 316-37. The term "Ashkenazi," referring to Jews of Northern European descent, was first associated with Franco-German Jewry and was later expanded to include Jews of Central and Eastern Europe. Ashkenazi Israelis are their descendants, so, too, most of British and Amer ican Jewry. Sephardim were originally the Jews of Spain and Portugal, Sepharad being a biblical place name that was associated with Spain in the Middle Ages. In current popular usage, "Sephardi" connotes Jews of Eastern (Muslim) countries such as Syria, Iraq, Persia, Turkey, and those in the Arabian Penin sula, Israel serving as the dividing line between east and west. In one sense, this name is anachronistic because traditions originally spread from the east (Babylonia) to Spain; in another sense, though, the connotation is valid because following the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492, the exiles found refuge in the Ottoman Empire, including Palestine and regions of the Middle East. Many Jews of Eastern origin therefore prefer the more original designation Mizrahim, "Eastern Jews." However, the traditions of North Africa?Algeria, Morocco?are also Sephardic, brought to those lands by the Spanish ?migr?s, yet these lands are all due west of Israel, hence not "Eastern." For the sake of con venience, despite the possible inaccuracies, we will use the accepted terms Sephardi and Ashkenazi. Most non-Ashkenazim, even Yemenites, will define the polar opposite of "Ashkenazi" as "Sephardi," including themselves in this definition. However, if asked what they are, they will respond with their country of origin (Iraqi, Yemenite). 335</page><page sequence="2">Isaac B. Gottlieb halakhic decision making. In the particular question before us, accent has become a nodal point between religion, legal writing, and sociolinguistics.2 It is commonly accepted in Western legal studies that rhetorical and literary aspects of legal decisions are as revealing as their contents.3 It seems probable that the field of "law as language" grew out of the expanded role given to language by sociolinguistics.4 By the latter quarter of the twentieth century, linguistics encom passed subfields such as language as art, as cognition, and as behavior; language as behavior included the sociology of language.5 At approximately the same time, jurists and literary critics were pointing out the role expression plays in a legal argument.6 2. Diana Boxer, Applying Sociolinguistics: Domains and Face-to-Face Interaction (Philadel phia: John Benjamins, 2002), 125, notes that "the domain of religion has seen a relative paucity of sociolinguistic research over the past decades." Her own study of bar mitzvah (ibid.) is more concerned with talking than with language. Chaim I. Waxman, "Toward a Sociology of Psak," Tradition 25, no. 3 (1991): 12-25, reprinted in Rabbinic Authority and Personal Autonomy, ed. Moshe Sokol (Northvale, NJ: Jason Aronson, 1992), deals with the role socioeconomic conditions play in halakhic decisions and in their acceptance but makes no mention of language. Binyamin Lau, Mi-mar an 'ad mar an: mishnato hahilkhatit shel harav 'Ovadyah Yosef {Tel Aviv: Miskal, 2005), in a section entitled "Decisions with a Social Orientation," does not cite R. Ovadiah's views on pronunciation. Don Seeman, "Ethnographers, Rabbis, and Jewish Epistemology: The Case of The Ethiopian Jews," Tradition 25, no. 4 (1991): 13-29, investigates the relations between halakhic decisions and the social sciences, a question that will concern us here as well. On the nature of halakhic decisions, see Marc D. Angel, "A Study of the Halakhic Approaches of Two Modern Posekim," Tradition 23, no. 3 (1988): 41. Mark Washofsky, "Responsa and the Art of Writing: Three Examples from the Teshuvot of Rabbi Moshe Feinstein," in An American Rabbinate: A Festschrift for Walter Jacob, ed. Peter S. Knobel and Mark N. Staitman (Pittsburgh: Rodef Shalom Press, 2001), 149-204 (http://www.huc.edu/faculty/washofsky.shtml), views responsa from the point of view of "law as language," about which see further. 3. The number of books on law as literature is legion: James B. White, The Legal Imagination: Studies in the Nature of Legal Thought and Expression (Boston: Little, Brown, 1973); idem, Heracles ' Bow: Essays on the Rhetoric and Poetics of the Law (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1985); Ian Ward, Law and Literature: Possibilities and Perspectives (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995); Lenora Ledwon, ed., Law and Literature: Text and Theory (New York: Garland, 1996); Richard A. Posner, Law and Literature (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1998); and Guyora Binder and Robert Weisberg, Literary Criticisms of Law (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2000). A. Julius, in the introduction to Law and Literature, ed. M. Freeman and A. D. E. Lewis (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), 2:xiii, identifies four meanings for "law as literature": (1) the laws per taining to literature, (2) law in literature, (3) the law as literature, and (4) legal and literary hermeneutics. The last two areas are relevant to this paper. 4. "To adopt a speech-act perspective on literary texts (rather than on fictional discourse) is to see that literature, like any other linguistic performance, is a collective interaction as well as a verbal object" (Sandy Petrey, Speech Acts and Literary Theory [New York: Routledge, 1990], 71). 5. Michael A. K. Halliday, Language as Social Semiotic: The Social Interpretation of Language and Meaning (London: Arnold, 1978), 11. 6. The following remarks by a leading scholar in the realm of "law as language" studies convey the sense of the term: "My focus was always on language and expression.... I could begin to see that the law was a system for the translation of mute and inexpressible experience to another plane" (James Boyd White, The Edge of Meaning [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2001], 220). He adds, "The lawyer and the judge live constantly at the edge of language, the edge of meaning" (223). 336</page><page sequence="3">The Politics of Pronunciation Rabbinic responsa, often treated as texts, differ fundamentally from other types of Hebrew literature. The responsa are primarily a form of communication and argumentation, not a form of literary art. For this reason, analyzing them by describing their vocabulary, grammar, and syntax?the classic treatment for Hebrew texts such as the Bible and the Mishnah?is inadequate.7 We will attempt to examine these responsa as rhetorical compositions in their own right that reveal particular attitudes toward the Hebrew language, Jewish society, and religious change.8 Because responsa in general highlight rhetorical techniques, irrespective of the specific halakhic issue they are discussing, we will illustrate the role of rhetoric in Jewish legal writing from a teshuvah (responsum) of Rabbi Moses Feinstein that is unrelated to our chosen topic.9 The power of words is already made evident in the title: ?rrwiraoixp "nan ^xx nxunw nwx m nrn Regarding the status of the sons of a woman who was married by a "Conservative Rabbi" This responsum, like all Ashkenazic shutim, is written in Hebrew.10 The Hebrew word for "rabbi" is rav, plural rabbanim. But Rabbi Feinstein translit erated the English "Conservative rabbi" into Hebrew letters (which we have indicated above by quotation marks). By doing so, he denied the title of rabbi (rav) to members of the Conservative movement. Further on in the responsum, he writes, "Since he is a member of 'the Conservative Rabbis,'" again using the English words.11 He did not use the phrase rabbanim konser vativiim, which would be the neutral Hebrew equivalent of "Conservative rabbis." 7. Language studies of the responsa were done by Moshe Z. Kaddari, "Kivunim be-heker lesho nah shel sifrut ha-she'eilot u-teshuvot," Leshonenu 54 (1990): 231^15. Kaddari called for a mor phology and syntax of the language of the responsa in addition to semantic studies. His student, the late Zvi Betzer, followed suit with several papers on the grammar and vocabulary of the responsa. However, there is no mention in Kaddari's paper of sociolinguistics. The rhetorical and literary aspects of responsa have been highlighted in the pioneering paper of Washofsky, "Responsa and the Art of Writing." 8. Rhetoric in legal literature has been defined as a "subset of stylistic devices that is used to persuade readers or listeners" (Posner, Law and Literature, 255). 9. Iggerot Moshe 4:E.H.13 (the sections of Shulhan Arukh are henceforth abbreviated: 'Orah Hayyim, OH; Yoreh De 'ah, YD; Even ha-Ezer, EH; Hoshen Mishpat, HM). See n. 103 herein for details on Rabbi Feinstein, his responsa, and our system of citing them. 10. Jewish decisors in Islamic lands wrote responsa in Judeo-Arabic, and the Geonim in the East (Iraq) penned theirs in Aramaic. But Jews in Germany and France during the Middle Ages wrote in Hebrew, as did Sephardic decisors under Christian rule (Nahmanides in northern Spain). Possibly they modeled their use of the holy tongue after the use of Latin in the church and therefore refrained from writing responsa in the vernacular (Old French, German, or Catalan). Western and Eastern Euro pean Jews, as well as American halakhic authorities, have continued to write in Hebrew right up to the present (communicated by Dr. Yehuda Galinsky). 11.

Feinstein 's argument.12 At issue was the status of the sons of a woman who married a second time without receiving a Jewish bill of divorce {get) from her first husband, whom she had married in a Conservative ceremony. Were the children she bore to the second husband to be considered bastards (mamzerimfl R. Feinstein ruled that the mother's first marriage was no marriage at all in Jewish law, and the "Rabbi" who officiated was no rabbi; therefore, one need not be concerned about the status of the children born of the second marriage.13 This brief example shows how one particular use of language?the injection of a foreign term into a Hebrew responsa and its pejorative connotations? determines the societal attitude of the responsum, which then becomes part and parcel of the teshuvah. The legal argument is rooted as much in rhetoric as in substance. Changing Pronunciation?The Problem The question at hand is whether one who was brought up in the Ashkenazi reading tradition, which differentiates between the vowel signs patah (/a/) and kamaz {l?l), zereh {le?) and segol {lei), and between the letter tav with a dagesh {/t?) and without {/si), may pray using the Sephardi pro nunciation, which does not make these distinctions.14 The central issue in the responsa is the virtue of maintaining one's received traditions, but in the background, one can discern the ghost of Eliezer Ben-Yehudah, the venerable Hebrew lexicographer and language reformer.15 Residing in Palestine in the first decades of the twentieth century, he "ruled" that spoken Hebrew in Palestine should follow the Sephardi pronunciation. His choice was based on aesthetic considerations and probably took into account that Sephardi Jews were the majority of Palestine's Jewish inhabitants. At any rate, this 12. Washofsky, "Responsa and the Art of Writing," also cites R. Feinstein's use of the translit erated "Rabbi" for members of the Reform rabbinate and "temple" for their synagogues. See also Jacob Chinitz, "Reb Moshe and the Conservatives," Conservative Judaism 41 (1989): 11, who cites a respon sum of R. Feinstein as follows: "The fact that he was known as 'rabbi' and not as 'rav' indicates to me that he was Conservative" [Iggerot Moshe 5:EH4]. Unfortunately, this is a misreading. What R. Feinstein wrote was, "It seems from the use of the word 'Rabbi' by the questioner [presumably writing in Hebrew] in place of the word rav that the mesadder kiddushin [the officiating rabbi being referred to] must have been a Conservative rabbi." Reb Moshe made a logical deduction based on the questioner's style and did not independently deem every "rabbi" a member of the Conservative clergy. After all, American Orthodox rabbis are also called "rabbi." Nevertheless, our point is academic, as the example we chose to cite (like those of Washofsky) indicates that the medium of language served R. Feinstein's case to deny the validity of Conservative (and Reform) rabbis. 13. Not that halakhah requires a rabbi for the ceremony; rather, the responsum creates an ambi ence of ersatz both for the officiator and the ceremony 14. In Sephardi pronunciation, both kamaz andpatah are sounded as lal, and zere and segol as lei. The letter tav is always plosive Itl. 15. See Jack Fellman, The Revival of a Classical Tongue: Eliezer Ben Yehuda and the Modern Hebrew Language (The Hague: Mouton, 1973). 338</page><page sequence="5">The Politics of Pronunciation was not a natural language change but a decision made by the Zionist establishment.16 Zionism was not the only movement to "tamper" with the Hebrew language.l On the eve of the nineteenth century, European Jewry maintained a state of diglossia.18 Among Ashkenazi Jewry in Eastern and Western Europe, Yiddish was the spoken language, while the language of prayer and religious writing, includ ing responsa, was leshon ha-kodesh, "the holy tongue," pronounced l?shn k?ydesh in Ashkenazi Hebrew. This was a dialect based on biblical and rabbinic Hebrew and talmudic Aramaic.19 Mizrahi (Eastern) or so-called Sephardi Jews also maintained a state of diglossia. Those in the Middle East, Spain, North Africa, and the former Byzantine lands spoke Judeo-Arabic, Judeo-Spanish ("Ladino," properly Dzhudezmo or judaismo),20 or Judeo-Greek, generally in accord with the language of their sur roundings (Turkey is an exception). Leshon hakodesh was the Hebrew they used in the synagogue, identical in its social role to the religious language of Ashkenazi Jewry but distinct from it by virtue of the Sephardi pronunciation. During the Enlightenment period, in its Jewish version known as the Haskalah,21 enthusiasts of social reform tried to change both elements of the 16. The decision was taken by the Va 'ad ha-Lashon (Language Committee) in 1913. This was an early example of language planning; on this topic, see Shimon A. Shur, "Modern Hebrew in the Light of Language Planning Terminology, History, and Periodization," Hebrew Studies 37 (1996): 39-54. On whether it was demography or ideology that brought about this decision, see Nathan Efrati, Mi-leshon yehidim le-leshon 'umah: ha-dibbur ha-'ivri be-Erez-Yisra'el ba-shanim 1881 1922 (Jerusalem: Academy of the Hebrew Language: 2004), 88-91. 17. The following paragraphs are based on Israel Bartal, "From Traditional Bilingualism to National Monolingualism," in Hebrew in Ashkenaz: A Language in Exile, ed. Lewis Glinert (Oxford: Oxford University Press: 1993), 141-50. 18. Charles A. Ferguson, "Diglossia," Word 15 (1959): 325-40, thinks that the term refers to using two varieties of the same language: "In many speech communities, two or more varieties of the same language are used by some speakers under different conditions" (325). Joshua A. Fishman, "Societal Bilingualism: Stable and Transitional," in Language in Sociocultural Change (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1972), 135-52, uses the term "diglossia" for speaking two different languages as well. Fishman sees the Jewish situation as one of "stable diglossia co-occurring with wide spread bilingualism. Traditional (pre-World War I) Eastern European Jewish males communicated in Hebrew (H) and Yiddish (L). In more recent days their descendents have continued to do so, adding to their repertoire a Western language (notably English) for intragroup communication" (Joshua A. Fishman, "Bilingualism With and Without Diglossia; Diglossia With and Without Bilingualism," in Sociolinguistics: The Essential Readings, ed. Christina B. Paulston and G. Richard T?cher [Oxford: Blackwell, 2003], 360). Here, H stands for high language, L for low. 19. "The English term Hebrew is a misnomer in our context, suggesting as it does either the language of the Bible or the new Hebrew.... What traditional Jewry was concerned with was loshn koydesh ... in which Biblical and Mishnaic Hebrew, Talmudic Aramaic, the post-Talmudic amalgama tion of Hebrew and Aramaic all had converged into one linguistic entity" (Max Weinreich, "Yidishkayt and Yiddish: On the Impact of Religion on Language in Ashkenazi Jewry," in Mordecai M. Kaplan Jubilee Volume..., ed. Moshe Davis [New York: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1953], 388). 20. Ibid., 385. 21. This period encompassed more than 120 years, from the 1770s to the 1890s. See Shmuel Feiner, "Towards a Historical Definition of the Haskalah," in New Perspectives on the Haskalah, ed. Shmuel Feiner and David Sorkin (London: Littman, 2001), 184-220. 339</page><page sequence="6">Isaac B. Gottlieb Ashkenazi diglossia. They wanted to replace Yiddish with the vernacular? German in Germany, and Russian, Polish, or German in Eastern Europe. The goal was to utilize language as an entrance card to general society, which was now open to Jews after the emancipation. It goes without saying that speaking the language of the country was itself a major step in the direction of acculturation. In addition, the maskilim or reformers also wanted to change "the holy tongue" from a predominantly rabbinic dialect to biblical Hebrew as an expression of renewed secular Jewish culture. L?shn k?ydesh did not lend itself to poems, plays, novels, and newspapers in Hebrew, for it was primarily the language of prayer and Torah studies. The new diglossia of the Enlightenment wanted to reflect the varied themes of the times: on the one hand, integration into general society, and on the other, a renaissance of classic Jewish sources?primarily the Bible. This meant shaking off the coils of medieval rabbinic Judaism and its language. By contrast, the emergent Zionist movement in the late nineteenth century fostered a single-language solution. It wanted to replace the vernacular of enlight ened European Jewry, which was now German or Russian, with the national language, which was to be Hebrew. Of course, Zionism recognized that the spoken and national language of the Jews could only be unified when state and nation were one in the Land of Israel. Because the second language of Haskalah Jews in Europe had already morphed into a secular Hebrew based on the biblical dialect, in effect Zionism was pushing for a single language, Hebrew, to replace the traditional diglossia. The response of the traditional Orthodox community, today called haredi (ultra-Orthodox), to the language reforms of the Haskalah and Zionism was identical. In the spirit of "a plague on both your houses," Orthodox Jews objected to both the diglossia put forth by the Enlightenment and the monolin gualism of the Zionists. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, tra ditional Jews persisted in speaking Yiddish and did not take on the language of the general populace. In addition, they rejected the secularization of Hebrew and maintained l?shn k?ydesh, with its heavy rabbinic component, as their religious dialect.22 Ironically, a state of diglossia is still the situation of most identifying Jews in the Diaspora, haredi and modern; the shared component of their bilingualism is leshon ha-kodesh, synagogue Hebrew. As for the everyday language, the haredi community speaks Yiddish,23 while the general Jewish community abroad uses the language of the country. Further, the place of Hebrew in their Jewish identity is quite similar, although for different reasons. For the average Jew, the Jewish 22. The sociolinguistics of the Orthodox in Europe was much more complex, depending on the country in question and the branch of orthodoxy?hasidic or otherwise. See, for example, Solomon Poll, "The Role of Yiddish in American Ultra-Orthodox and Hassidic Communities," in Never Say Die! ed. Joshua Fishman (The Hague: Mouton, 1981), 197-218, which lists "eight distinct categories in the expression of attitudes towards Yiddish" (200) in the Hungarian Jewish community in the mid nineteenth century. 23. In fact, the haredi community in Israel often speaks Hebrew, so it is important for its members to distinguish clearly between the vernacular ("secular" Hebrew) and l?shn k?ydesh. 340</page><page sequence="7">The Politics of Pronunciation national language is not critical to his or her identity. Use of the national language is limited to the synagogue service, in the form of the sacred tongue (leshon ha-kodesh). Its further employment beyond the rites of worship is viewed as the purview of the learned, not the general populace.25 To sum up, modern Hebrew and leshon ha-kodesh are not identical for haredi Jews or for general Jewry in the Diaspora. Pronunciation?Ashkenazi for synagogue Hebrew, Israeli for modern Hebrew?perpetuates this difference.26 However, among haredim in Israel, the distinction is based on ideology: The holy tongue and secular street Hebrew must be kept apart. For general Jewry abroad, this distinc tion is insignificant because their spoken language is the local vernacular. As against these two groups, the Mizrahim, the Eastern or Sephardi community worldwide, and the religious-Zionist camp in Israel both pronounce leshon ha-kodesh and modern Hebrew in identical fashion. For the Sephardi Jews, their historical pronunciation of leshon ha-kodesh happens to coincide with the pronunciation of modern Hebrew.27 For the religious Zionists in Israel whose received tradition is the Ashke nazi pronunciation, creating a unity between the holy tongue and the spoken dialect is, as it is for the haredim, a matter of ideology: While the haredim strive to maintain an opposition between the two, religious Zionists aim to unite them because they perceive everyday talk in Hebrew to be imbued with holiness as well.28 In the responsa, all these positions are given expression, explicitly or implicitly. For those who maintain that leshon ha-kodesh and everyday Hebrew are two different entities, one holy and the other secular, the question of changing pronunciations from one to the other has ramifications that go beyond the narrow halakhic issues.29 A member of a group who changes his pronunciation to pray in 24. John Myhill, Language in Jewish Society: Towards A New Understanding (Buffalo, NY: Multilingual Matters, 2004), concludes that Jews and Gentiles differ with regard to the place that language occupies in their national identity. For non-Jews, the main components of national identity are language and country; whoever does not speak English in the United States is perceived by the average citizen as being less than American. But for Jews, identity is based primarily on religion and ancestry. Therefore, not knowing Hebrew (or not residing in Israel) does not flaw one's Jewish identity. 25. Lewis Glinert, "Language as Quasilect: Hebrew in Contemporary Anglo-Jewry," in Glinert, Hebrew in Ashkenaz, 249-64, has suggested that Hebrew be called a "quasilect" in England, an "as if language, because English Jews pray in Hebrew but are not able to speak it. 26. The difference between leshon ha-kodesh, the holy tongue, and the modern spoken form of Hebrew may indeed come under the rubric of diglossia (see n. 18 herein). However, Ferguson, "Diglos sia," 333, finds that the term means that "H has grammatical categories not present in L and has an inflectional system of nouns and verbs which is much reduced or totally absent in L," as in the case of Classical Arabic and its spoken dialects. The difference between the Ashkenazi pronunciation and the Sephardi is one of language variation alone and does not affect grammar. 27. In truth, this identity is not a full correspondence because traditional Sephardi pronunciation maintains the guttural consonants, while Israeli Hebrew does not. 28. The idea ofmerging the secular and the sacred is especially strong among the followers of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, author of two responsa on the question of changing pronunciations. 29. At the beginning of the twentieth century, R. Shalom Ber Schneersohn, the Lubavitch Rebbe, "vented his wrath upon the portrayal of the Hebrew language as the national language and demanded that his followers vigorously maintain the traditional diglossia that assigned a sacred 341</page><page sequence="8">Isaac B. Gottlieb Sephardi pronunciation runs the risk of identifying the language of the synagogue with modern Israeli Hebrew and confusing the holy with the secular, which is far from neutral in value. Further, he throws his own social grouping into question.30 The Responsa?Analysis The halakhic aspects of these responsa, normally of prime interest, are not the subject of our inquiry.31 From a strictly legal standpoint, both Rabbi Kook, the first chief rabbi of Palestine and spiritual mentor of the religious Zionist movement, and Rabbi Weiss of the ultra-Orthodox anti-Zionist 'Edah Haredit, rule against changing pronunciation from Ashkenazi to Sephardi. However, their rhetoric could not be further apart. Rabbi Kook (1) expresses the wish that "all of Israel will be one con federation with no differences or changes at all," by which he means that in the ideal state, all citizens of Israel will speak with a single pronunciation. He also comments on the aesthetics of the Sephardi pronunciation: "It has a grace and beauty all its own." Rabbi Weiss (8) considers the Sephardi pronunciation to be inferior on linguis tic grounds, and already in the presentation of the question, he notes that those who ask about changing their pronunciation to the Israeli pronunciation "only have a national intention, because this is now the spoken language in the State of Israel." Though both R. Kook and R. Weiss hand down the same ruling, the rhetoric of the latter is critical and pejorative, whereas the former is idealistic and complimen tary, reflecting extra-halakhic elements in their thought.32 For R. Kook, the prohibi tion against change comes to preserve one's heritage; for R. Weiss, the fact that the Israeli pronunciation of leshon ha-kodesh is identical with modern spoken Hebrew speaks most strongly against adopting it for religious use. Rabbi Ouziel (3), both a Sephardi and a Zionist, also sings the praises of a unified pronunciation, describing "the renaissance of the Hebrew language (hasafah ha 'ivrit) as the spoken language of the Jewish people in the land of Israel, a people divided into many Diaspora dialects and pronunciations, even in their Torah language." Like R. Kook before him, he seems to see language variation within Hebrew as less than ideal and a consequence of exile. And though he, too, speaks approvingly of the aesthetics of the Sephardi pronunciation, "We cannot agree of our own minds to all that seems aesthetic and rings nicely in our ears." function to leshon ha-kodesh and a colloquial role to the vernacular" (Bartal, "From Traditional Bilin gualism," 147-48). R. Shalom Ber claimed that in talmudic times, "the masses engaged in worldly matters did not speak the Holy Tongue ... and in Eretz-Israel as in Babylonia the masses spoke another language" (cited by Bartal, loc. cit.). 30. Because "pronunciation reflects the permanent social group with which the speaker ident ifies" (Hudson, Sociolinguistics, 48), changing pronunciation carries with it serious social consequences. 31. The ensuing discussion is based on the responsa cited in the appendix. Each responsum there is numbered from 1 to 13 and is referred to by number in this section. 32. On extra-halakhic considerations in Rabbi Kook's decisions, see Neria Guttel, Hadashim gam yeshanim: bi-netivei mishnato ha-hilkhatit-hagutit shel harav Kuk (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 2005). 342</page><page sequence="9">The Politics of Pronunciation That is to say, there are objective halakhic factors to consider that take precedence over subjective aesthetic ones. He himself was unwilling to rule "at the present time [1935] about choosing this or that pronunciation." However, he wanted to convene a rabbinic assembly that would decide on a unified pronunciation for all synagogues, and he opposed those who ruled that a change of pronunciation from Ashkenazi to Sephardi is prohibited, calling their claims and proofs "untenable." Rabbi Zevi Pesah Frank (4), a former chief rabbi of Jerusalem, opposes the change based on two classic arguments: The first invokes a talmudic prohibition on abandoning received traditions, and the second claims that there is a transgres sion involved in pronouncing God's name (pronounced by Ashkenazim as 'adonoy) with a patah {'adonay)?3 However, he, too, concludes that "where it is probable that our words will not be heeded, the Rabbis have already noted that it is compulsory (mizvah) to refrain from saying something that will not be heard." The content of his decision says one thing, the tenor of his argument quite another. Reckoning with reality, he understood that a ruling to prohibit a change to the Sephardi/Israeli pronunciation would not stand. Similarly, R. Kook had already written (1) that although the traditional Ashkenazi pronuncia tion should be maintained, if a synagogue adopted the Sephardi pronunciation, this would become the rule. Rabbi Herzog (5), the second Ashkenazi chief rabbi, raises two novel argu ments from the historic and linguistic realms to support a change of pronunciation: First, in the eighteenth century, the hasidic movement in Eastern Europe changed the daily prayers from the Ashkenazi nosah (text, wording) of their forefathers to the Sephardi based on the fact that the mystics whom they revered were Sephar dim.34 Why should a change of wording in the prayer book pass muster, asks R. Herzog, but not a change of pronunciation? Second, in a pointed response to those who claim the Sephardi pronunciation is inferior because it makes no dis tinction between patah {/a/) and kamaz {/a/), he notes the lack of distinction among Ashkenazi speakers between the consonants aleph /'/and ayin IeI, het Ihl and heh /h/, and tav Itl and samekh I si. In addition, Lithuanian Jews merge the pro nunciations o? shin I si and sin Is/. If such pronunciations do not invalidate religious recitations by Ashkenazi Jews, neither should the lack of distinction between patah and kamaz in the Sephardi pronunciation be considered a flaw.35 R. Herzog 's reliance on historical and linguistic arguments may be compared to his dependence on historical and sociological studies to determine the halakhic status of Ethiopian Jewry. This raises an aspect of responsa beyond our immediate purview?the kinds of knowledge on which rabbinic decisions are based.36 33. This claim comes up time and again and is explained in the appendix. 34. In particular, they venerated the Ari, Rabbi Isaac Luria (1534-72), who resided in Safed. 35. Rabbi Kook had earlier argued (2) that an Ashkenazi using the Sephardi pronunciation when reading the Shema was equivalent to "one who read the Shema without enunciating the letters properly ... he has fulfilled his obligation," but should not do so from the outset (M. Berakhot 2:3). 36. "Rabbi Herzog is unique in his clear and unequivocal attribution to 'the researchers' of his doubt regarding Ethiopian Jews" (Seeman, "Ethnographers," 20). The issue is epistemological: What kinds of knowledge or sources are acceptable to halakhic decision makers? 343</page><page sequence="10">Isaac B. Gottlieb But while the trend of his argument is to permit the change, R. Herzog then prohibits it on polemical grounds. He claims that the first to abandon the Ashke nazi pronunciation in favor of the Sephardi were the Reformers in Germany. Approving a change of pronunciation would therefore be interpreted as making reform-like changes in Jewish law, to which Herzog was vehemently opposed. The polemical argument is bolstered by appropriate rhetoric: "the poison of Reform," "the heart knows whether one intended to correct or to distort." This last talmudic proverb means that one must evaluate intentions when the identical activity can serve good ends and bad. R. Herzog is accusing the Reformers of sin ister intentions in changing the pronunciation of Hebrew, as opposed to the hasidim, who changed the prayer book from the Ashkenazi rite to the Sephardi. Because Herzog himself had earlier made the comparison between rite and pro nunciation, the reader is bound to do so as well and will then be puzzled by Rabbi Herzog 's objection to the Reform change of pronunciation. In order to accept the hasidic change but reject that of the Reformers, R. Herzog finds the dis tinction in the invisible realm of intent. In a teshuvah written six years later (6), R. Herzog rules that "an Ashkenazi who prays in the Sephardi pronunciation should take care to extend the open vowel (i.e., he should lengthen the vowel in the last syllable of adonay), but there is no prohibition to pronounce [God's name] withpatah. " Why does he permit here what he previously prohibited? Perhaps the difference is that the first response was written to a rabbi in South Africa, and R. Herzog feared the change of pronunciation by an entire congre gation would be interpreted as religious reform. The second responsum was addressed to an individual questioner in Israel. In 1951, Reform Judaism in Israel posed no threat, and R. Herzog could rely on his original arguments about the correct ness of the Sephardi pronunciation. This explanation receives support form the fact that in this second respon sum, he notes that one may not rule against changing pronunciations based on the Hatam Sofer, the reigning European halakhic authority in the nineteenth century who prohibited even minute changes in prayer customs, because, accord ing to R. Herzog, the Hatam Sofer was writing to oppose the Reform movement.37 Further, R. Herzog notes that he himself prays in the Ashkenazi tradition but uses the Sephardi pronunciation when leading the prayers or reciting the blessings at the Torah in the central Yeshurun synagogue in Jerusalem, where that is the accepted pronunciation of the congregation. The unique Israeli situation must figure in the decision whether to allow a change of pronunciation. In this second teshuvah, R Herzog deals with the kamaz-patah argument in an original way. Herzog notes that pronouncing God's name either as 'adonoy or 'adonay still distinguishes it from the word 'adoni, "my master," a title of respect when addressing human beings. Both the Ashkenazi and Sephardi pronunciations 37. Rabbi Moshe Sofer (Schreiber), 1762-1839, is considered to be the spiritual father of Hun garian Jewry in the modern period. Born in Frankfurt am Main, he was appointed rabbi of Pressburg in 1806 and was considered the greatest rabbi of his generation. He is known for his voluminous responsa and for his successful battle against the Reform movement in Austria-Hungary. 344</page><page sequence="11">The Politics of Pronunciation reflect the use of the plural form ("my masters") when addressing God, clearly differ entiating between the holy and secular meanings of this word. Further, in his gramma tical discussion, he cites the Masorah and Ibn Ezra's biblical commentary, unusual sources for a halakhic responsum. As in his first responsum, he relies on scholarly analysis, this time of a grammatical nature, to reach a halakhic conclusion.38 Rabbi Meshulam Ratt (7), who was aligned with the religious Zionist move ment, objects to the change on the identical grounds cited earlier by Rabbi Frank. His responsum is free of any rhetoric, polemic, or insinuation and may be con sidered a "model case" that shows how a responsum can be based exclusively on halakhic grounds. We cited R. Weiss's position (8) earlier. He finds the Sephardi pronunciation that has only five vowels to be lacking, and the Israeli pronunciation to be further flawed, for it has adopted the worst of both worlds: It does not distinguish, like the Sephardi pronunciation, between the vowels patah and kamaz, segol and zereh, and has also abandoned the Sephardi pronunciation of the laryngeals. Aside from the tone of his argument, which we discussed earlier, there is something to note about the form of his responsum. On the face of things, he could not possibly have cited Rabbis Kook or Herzog, whose collections of responsa, though written earlier, were published after the responsum of R. Weiss (but see further). However, he ignores Rabbi Ouziel's published responsum on the matter. Noncitation is certainly a form of rhetoric. R. Weiss' second responsum (9) takes a novel form, for in effect it lists sources in favor of a change in pronunciation, most notably the unusual step taken by Rabbi Nathan Adler (Frankfurt, eighteenth century), the teacher of the Hatam Sofer, to change his pronunciation of prayer to the Sephardi. Weiss quotes these counterarguments from a letter written to him by an admirer, who notes that he saw these "pro-change" sources in the responsa Ziz Eliezer by Rabbi Waldenberg (10). After citing them, the admirer expresses surprise that R. Waldenberg recorded these sources without comment. The admirer himself reacts to the change of pronunciation attributed to R. Adler by saying, "Who knows what his intention was in this, and who can compare in his ways to R. Adler?" In other words, the precedent set by Rabbi Adler is so exceptional that it cannot be considered a precedent (!). Had this admirer paid attention to R. Waldenberg's rhetoric and style, he would not wonder why Ziz Eliezer did not comment on his sources. Waldenberg was asked by someone from the ultra-Orthodox community in Jerusalem whether he could use the Sephardi pronunciation to recite the Kiddush on Friday night on behalf of Israeli 38. Rabbi Herzog's relation to scholarship was neither tangential nor superficial: He published a two-volume work in English, The Main Institutions of Jewish Law (London: Soncino, 1936-39), the first while chief rabbi of the Irish Free State, the second after being chosen as chief rabbi of Palestine, in which he writes, "My work does not purport to be a history of Jewish Law.... Were I writing such a history, I would, of course, have to deal very fully with the critical theory about the Pentateuch which dissects the Law of Moses into distinct sources." The mere mention of biblical criticism and the history of halakhah distinguishes Herzog from other traditional posekim (halakhic decisors). Further evidence of his cultural world is an expression of gratitude to a friend in the preface (xvi): "He is the Maecenas of this work" (xxv). 345</page><page sequence="12">Isaac B. Gottlieb nurses whose pronunciation was Sephardi-Israeli. R. Waldenberg agreed to rule on the matter at hand but not to go into the general issue of changing one's pronunciation. However, he then cites Rabbis Kook,39 Ouziel, the story about R. Nathan Adler, and the response of the Ridbaz,40 the last three of whom saw the change to Sephardi pro nunciation in a positive light. He actually cites the opinion of Ridbaz that the Sephardi pronunciation is superior. Having said this, R. Waldenberg repeats that he will not deal with the basic issue, but he rules that the questioner may recite the Kiddush in the Israeli pronunciation for the nurses and thereby fulfill his own obligation as well. The structure of the teshuvah in effect says, "While I won't decide the larger question at present, this is my opinion," suggesting that he is in favor of allowing a change in pronunciation. It is therefore no wonder that R. Waldenberg did not question the sources he cited that were sympathetic to a change of pronunciation, for the entire shape of his teshuvah leans in that direction. One cannot know which authorities Rabbi Feinstein (11, 12) consulted; he cites no earlier responsa in his decision. In the very first line (11), he sets down the rule that any change is prohibited. However, he then presents an argument similar to that of R. Herzog about the variations to be found in the Ashkenazi pronuncia tion of Hebrew, such as the Polish, Lithuanian, and Hungarian pronunciations. By way of illustration (he does not bring any examples), we might compare the Polish, Lithuanian, and Hungarian pronunciations for the vowel holam loi. The first pro nounce it oy, the second ?y, the latter in certain regions as German lui. German Jews themselves pronounce holam as the diphthong ?w (as in "cow"). If all of these are within the pale of Ashkenazi, concludes R. Feinstein, then any and all pronunciations of Hebrew, including the Sephardi, are equally legitimate. Further, he speculates that perhaps the diversity among Ashkenazi communities is attributable to the foreign languages they speak, which influences their pronun ciations of Hebrew. If so, then none of these variations can be said to be original Hebrew. From these arguments Reb Moshe, as he was affectionately called, draws the conclusion that all pronunciations of Hebrew are valid for the members of a particular community, even though logic would dictate that at the time of Moses, only one of the pronunciations was original and "correct." From the point of view of modern linguistics, as we will point out in the postscript, R. Feinstein's ideas about language change approximate some of the historical processes that Hebrew underwent. At the end of the responsum (11), R. Feinstein rules: "It is prohibited to change [pronunciations] save if he were to move to another location with no inten tion to return [to his original locale]. Therefore in our places [the United States] 39. Though his published responsa appeared only later, Rabbi Kook had written on the subject in the journal Kol Torah 2 (1933): 1-4, and had spoken about the matter in his published approbation of R. Ouziel's responsa volume, OH 1. R. Waldenberg summarizes R. Kook's arguments as published in Kol Torah in the summary that appeared in 'Erez Tovah (Jerusalem, 1947), a collection of responsa by R. Tobiah Judah Tavyomi (Gutentag), a rabbi in Tel Aviv. Thus, R. Weiss could have cited R. Kook's opinion, either from Ziz Eliezer or Erez Tovah, but he chose not to. 40. R. Jacob David b. Ze'ev Willowski, Safed (1845-1914), not to be confused with Radbaz, R. David b.

This summation clearly opens the door for new immi grants to Israel to adopt the Sephardi/Israeli pronunciation. In a second responsum (12), R. Feinstein allows a young man in Argentina to read the Torah in the Sephardi pronunciation in an Ashkenazi synagogue. His main concern is not the reading of the individual youth but the synagogue's custom. To this end, he counsels that one of the smaller minyanim (prayer groups) in the syna gogue should meet in a side room on that particular Sabbath and read the Torah in the Ashkenazi pronunciation, and the youth could then read in the main synagogue in the Sephardi pronunciation. Further, he wonders out loud whether the synagogue foun ders had the right to adopt the Ashkenazi pronunciation in the first place, knowing that a large population of Sephardim might reach their shores. It seems that with this argument, he is trying to retroactively change the synagogue custom to include the use of both pronunciations. Like Rabbi Frank, he sees the reality of modern Hebrew for what it was; he realizes that maintaining the old Ashkenazi pronunciation would distance young people from the Orthodox synagogues, at least in South America.41 Parenthetically, it seems that this same assessment was behind his decision to translate English words into modern Hebrew in the last three volumes of his responsa, which were published in Israel.42 Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef (13) is an unabashed supporter of the Sephardi ritual in all matters.43 He defends the Sephardi pronunciation as correct, attacks the Ash kenazi pronunciation for its distortion of vowels and consonants, and makes short shrift of earlier respondents who raise claims against changing pronunciations. He cites former chief rabbi Unterman with approval, who opined that "since in these times hundreds of thousands of our brethren joined us [in Israel] who never heard the Ashkenazi pronunciation, and two generations here were educated only in accord with the Sephardi pronunciation, we cannot deny them the right to read and to pray in the pronunciation in which they were raised and educated." Further, R. Yosef predicts that "there is no doubt that in the end, the Sephardi pro nunciation will reign supreme in all places, and when the youth who study in our schools grow up, this pronunciation will be accepted all over." The bold rhetoric is not halakhic but ethnic and social: It proclaims, "This is the pronunciation of the majority and this is the pronunciation in which Israeli children are being taught. The Ashkenazi pronunciation is on the way out even 41. He makes reference to his own previous responsum (11) and wishes that schools would teach in the Ashkenazi manner, but he seems to accept the reality that modern Orthodox day schools and high schools use the Israeli/Sephardi pronunciation; the entire responsum goes in the direction of acceptance. 42. R. Feinstein asked the editors to change all the foreign (English, Yiddish) terms that he used for realia to modern Hebrew so that Israeli readers could understand them. There are some signs that this had already been done sporadically in the earlier volumes that were published in New York. 43. He is the spiritual leader of Shas, an ethnic political party whose motto is "to return the crown to its rightful place." The party was born when Sephardi voters broke away from the traditional haredi Agudat Yisrael party, which they felt was dominated by Ashkenazi haredim and prejudiced against its Sephardi members. 347</page><page sequence="14">Isaac B. Gottlieb for Ashkenazi Jews, and it behooves them to change their pronunciation in the synagogue so as not to lose their youth." In contrast to R. Waldenberg, who would not utilize the platform of an individual request to discuss the general issue of pronunciation, R. Yosef takes the opportunity of an individual questioner to deliver a broadside against Ashkenazi Hebrew. However, his rhetoric is clearly nonpolitical. As opposed to the responsa of R. Ouziel and R. Weiss, R. Yosef does not take Zionist and national aspirations into account; they are neither a point against adopting the Sephardi/Israeli pronunciation, nor do they weigh in its favor. The camps of "us" and "them" in this responsum are neither the religious and the secular, nor the haredim and the Zionists. For R. Yosef, as for the Shas party that he heads, the major divide in Israeli society is between Sephardi and Ashkenazi eth nicity. This Pandora's box includes the entire gamut of social class. Because pronun ciation is a factor in social grouping and identity, those who track R. Yosef's religious and social philosophy should be able to align his views on pronunciation as presented here with his overall outlook.44 Ironically, the existence of religious pol itical parties in Israel turns an ethnic issue into a political one, though R. Yosef himself studiously avoids the political sphere in the actual teshuvah. Conclusions These responsa should be studied as a form of language because they rely on rhetoric as much as on source material to make their case. There is no clear-cut ruling in the Mishnah, the Talmud, or early rabbinic authorities for or against the change of pronunciation. Most of the responsa that object to the change cite two argu ments, the first a general talmudic prohibition against changing accepted traditions,45 the second a very specific point based on a biblical commentary of R. Bahya b. Asher (Spain, thirteenth century) that seems to associate the correct pronunciation for the name of God ( 'dny) with the Ashkenazi pronunciation. One may retort that the first argument does not apply to our case, and the second is a comment about pointing the last syllable in the word 'dny with the vowel sign patah or kamaz, not about its pronunciation. For lack of solid halakhic arguments, the shut fall back on rhetorical devices. Some responsa grant an inherent superiority to one pronunciation over another, 44. See Lau, Mi-maran; and Ariel Picard, Mishnato shel ha-rav 'Ovadyah Yosef be- 'idan shel temurot: heker ha-halakhah u-vikoret tarbut (Ramat-Gan: Bar-Han University Press, 2007). 45. The verse from Proverbs (1:8; 6:20 with variations) mentioned by many of the responsa is understood to mean that one may not forsake the customs of one's father (though the verse literally speaks of "your mother's Torah"). The source for this ruling, cited by some as Y. Pesahim 4:1 (30d), does say "do not change the customs of your fathers" but does not connect it to any verse. B. Pesahim 50b tells of the people of Beisan (Beth-Shean), whose custom was not to travel from Tyre to Sidon for business on Friday so as not to interfere with preparations for the Sabbath. Their sons came before R. Yohanan and asked for permission to make the trip for economic reasons. He told them, "Your fathers already accepted [the prohibition] on themselves, as it says, 'Heed my son the ethics of your fathers, and do not desert the Torah of your mother'" (Proverbs, loc. cit.), and he prohibited their travel. However, one may claim that keeping the customs of the fathers relates to pro hibitions, not to positive actions. 348</page><page sequence="15">The Politics of Pronunciation others invoke the rhetoric of polemics against any sort of change. Another rhetorical tactic eliminates rival views by ignoring previous opinions. Still others paint an ideal future situation in which it is assumed that linguistic unity will reign, implying that such unity is a desideratum even now. These are all strategies of persuasion. In line with general observations cited at the beginning of this paper about the law as a form of language, these responsa give verbal expression to deep-seated feelings: Shall the Jews in Israel continue to maintain separate communal traditions, as they did in the Diaspora, or should they pursue national unity in so crucial an area as language? If unity is the desired end, which tradition shall become the common heritage? In some of the responsa, there is an inherent tension between the role of Hebrew as a holy tongue alongside its role in everyday discourse. This tension is related to the respondent's views on Zionism, contemporary Judaism, and the state of Israel. Such standpoints are not expressed in the halakhic content of each teshuvah but may be learned from its rhetoric and style of writing. We further posited at the beginning of this paper that the specific arguments for and against a change of pronunciation concur with, and are evidence for, basic sociolinguistic ideas. They certainly corroborate the following points: Language is used as a symbol of group-membership. People use their speech in order to identify the particular social groups to which they belong (or would like to be thought to belong).... Social psychologists have claimed that people like to think the group to which they belong is, in at least some respects, better than others with which it can be compared.... One of the ways in which people persuade themselves that their group is better than others is by finding characteristics of their own group which appear in some ways inherently preferable to those of other groups ... If parents tell their children that their own way of speaking is the 'right' one, then it will automatically follow that other groups speak less well.46 Many other studies ... have revealed correlations between language variation and social stratification but social class, however defined, has rarely, if ever, been demonstrated to be the only independent variable which determines choice of speech forms.... Sex and ethnicity ... also interact in complex ways with social class in determining an individual's speech behavior, as what Fishman et al. (1971) have called social domain (family, school, work, market, church).47 Clear cases of diglossia involve only one language, and so only one ethnic group and culture; there is no ethnic strife, and when conflict occurs it is most often along lines of social class or religion.48 46.

Gottlieb The question of changing pronunciation for the language of prayer is a proving ground for the foregoing sociolinguistic principles, in which religion (and not necess arily halakhah) plays a role. The standard Hebrew on the street in Israel for all speak ers is indeed that form that was created "by conscious and deliberate planning,"49 the Sephardi version. Clearly, then, the conflict over the pronunciation of leshon ha-kodesh in the synagogue is related to social class and religion. Original regional dialects?Ashkenazi and Sephardi pronunciations?have become social dialects relating to class and network.50 The same can be said of English in Great Britain, where the East Midlands dialect emerged as the standard because the region included prestigious areas such as London, Oxford, and Cambridge.51 Viewing the situation as one of diglossia {leshon ha-kodesh in relation to modern Hebrew), l?shn k?ydesh is the H of haredi speakers, based as it is on biblical, mishnaic, and medieval rabbinic Hebrew, while modern Hebrew is their L.52 Consequently, it is important for this group to maintain differences between the two, and pronunciation is the most obvious variant. For other groups, as we have described earlier, the opposite is true: Elimination of the Ashkenazi pronunciation brings synagogue Hebrew and the spoken dialect closer together, which in their eyes is a practical and ideological desideratum. For those people who want to identify with one social group or another, or to change their affiliation, pronunciation may be an essential element of their self-perception as well as their identity in the eyes of others. Postscript About fifty years ago, linguists discovered that the Jews of Ashkenaz in the Middle Ages spoke in the Sephardi tradition, pronouncing kamaz as patah. Rashi (1040-1105), the classic Ashkenazi commentator on the Bible and the Talmud who studied in Germany and resided in northern France, did not differentiate between kamaz and patah53 Transcriptions of Hebrew names into Latin letters show that the Jews in England also pronounced kamaz as patah54 In addition, Ashkenazi Jews, like the Sephardim, pronounced zereh as segol. The Ashkenazi pronunciation we know today came to Europe later on. How, when, and why this happened is a matter of speculation. The renowned Semitic scholar Eduard Y Kutscher summarizes this discovery as follows: "Until a generation ago it was commonly thought that the ... Ashkenazi 49.

But H. Yalon has shown that in Europe at the beginning of the second millennium CE, the Ashkenazi communities pronounced the qames gadol like the patah, and that the change to the so-called Ashkenazi pronunciation began in the thirteenth, and came to an end in the fifteenth century."55 Ilan Eldar, who has done the most extensive research on Ashkenazi and pre-Ashkenazi reading traditions, states, "The Jews of medieval Ashkenaz (up to around the mid-fourteenth century) had just five vowel qualities in their pronuncia tion (a, e, i, o, u)?as against the set of symbols in Tiberian vocalization, represent ing a phonological system of seven vowels."56 Hanokh Yalon (cited earlier by Kutscher), a pioneer in the research of Hebrew pronunciations among different com munities, claims that the change in the pronunciation of the kamaz as l?! was the result of the influence of Yiddish and local German dialects used by the Jews. Max Weinreich notes that "Sefarad kept up the old tradition, Ashkenaz changed their tradition totally in the thirteenth century."57 Chaim Rabin believes that the Ashkenazi reading tradition was brought to Germany in the twelfth century by emi grant teachers from Palestine who would read the Torah in this pronunciation. It was represented by the Tiberian vowel system, which has separate signs for patah and kamaz. In Muslim countries, however, Spain included, the Babylonian system of vocalic notation held sway, which did not distinguish between patah-kamaz5% This is the origin of the Sephardi identification of the two vowels. The three vocalic notation systems?Tiberian, Babylonian, and Palestinian? represent three actual pronunciations of Hebrew, two in the land of Israel and one in Babylonia, in the eighth and ninth centuries CE.59 Thus claims of superiority for the Ashkenazi pronunciation, based on the fact that the Sephardi pronunciation expresses only five vowels while the Tiberian notation system has seven signs, must be altered; the rabbis who authored the responsa could never have guessed that at an earlier time there were multiple systems of notation, each of which accorded with one of the various pronunciations. In light of the evidence for Sephardi pronunciation among Western Jews, the idea implicit in many of the responsa, that to change one's Ashkenazi pronunciation would be to desert the "received pronunciation," is not necessarily so. As we have seen in our conclusions, many of the responsa on both sides of the argument exhibit some form of linguistic prejudice.60 One can only wonder whether the evidence for the different pronunciations and notation systems, were it made known to the authors of the responsa, would serve to eliminate the rhetoric predicated 55.

Gottlieb on the idea that there must have been only one correct Hebrew, or that some language developments are "right," others "wrong."61 It has been pointed out that "one of the most solid achievements of linguistics in the twentieth century has been to eliminate the idea that some languages or dialects are inherently 'better' than others."62 We have seen how halakhic authorities with no formal training in the social sciences intuitively arrived at conclusions that take this observation into account.63 The knowledge that there were multiple language traditions might also temper some wishful thinking about a unified, single pronunciation among all speakers, whether in the ancient past or in the eschatological future, as such a situ ation runs counter to linguistic findings. The epistemological question is central here: Will halakhic authorities accept history, sociology, and linguistics as reliable sciences that can help clarify the reality on which to base Jewish law?64 It seems to be a general truth that in many halakhic questions dealing with modernity, the amount of actual precedent is by definition small, and the posek falls back on ideas and values that may best be understood through the social sciences. The responsa that we have seen as a whole reflect what sociolinguists have discovered about language and attitudes toward language. Further, the responsa act as language, to express those ideas that lay behind legal decisions. For these reasons, applying the insights of literary critics, legal theorists, sociologists, and historians to the responsa may lead us to appreciate their wider implications for the study of Judaism.65 Isaac B.

It would seem that post facto {bedi'avad) changing one's pronunciation does not render the reading invalid, for we hold with the view of R. Yose in the Mishnah (B. Berakhot 15a = M.

Therefore someone who reads in a different pronunciation from that of the general community is no worse off than one who did not 66.

The author was the first chief rabbi of Palestine, Abraham Isaac Hakohen Kook (1865 1935). He came to Palestine in 1904 and was chosen as chief rabbi in 1921. He was known for his love of the early pioneers (haluzim), though they had abandoned the religious way of life. Four volumes of his responsa were published posthumously: Mishpat Kohen (1936) deals with questions about commandments related to the Land of Israel; Da'at Kohen (1942), responsa on Yoreh De'ah; Ezrat Kohen (1969) with Even ha-Ezer; and finally, 'Orah Mishpat (1979), responsa on 'Orah Hayyim and Hoshen Mishpat. 68.

But from the outset {le-khathilah) it is cer tainly an obligation to recite all recitations of holiness in the most complete way. Therefore it follows that one should not change his pronunciation from the received tradition, for each reading tradition has pronunciations of vowels and consonants that, when judged by the criteria of another tradition, are considered as "one who read and did not pronounce all the letters properly." And even though it is the custom here in the Land of Israel to give an advan tage to the Sephardi pronunciation, this is only because it has a grace and beauty all its own, but the main advantage of any pronunciation is its accuracy in differentiating the consonants and vowels, and in this the Sephardi pronunciation is inferior to the Ashkenazi, and certainly the Yemenite pronunciation is the best of all, because it is careful to distinguish between every consonant and vowel with great accuracy. Without doubt it is not permitted for someone brought up in this pronunciation [the Yemenite tradition] to leave it and to exchange it for another system which is less accurate.... May the Almighty make the peoples pure of speech so that they all invoke the Lord by name [see Zephaniah 3:9] and may the Lord be one and His name be one [Zechariah 14:9] and Israel will be a unique nation on earth [I Chronicles 17:21] ... and all of Israel will be one confederation with no differences or changes at all ... and until that happy time we are commanded to fulfill "be careful with the customs of your fathers" (B. Bezah 4b). 3. Mishpetei Ouziel 1:1 (1935)69 On proper pronunciation of vowels and consonants when reciting the Shema, Prayer, and Reading the Torah: The immigration of Diaspora Jews to the land of Israel, which was brought about by God's grace upon us in our generation, and the renaissance of the Hebrew language {ha-safah ha- 'ivrit) as the spoken language of the Jewish people in the land of Israel, a people divided into many Diaspora languages and pronunciations even in their Torah language, raises a very important halakhic issue about unifying the language and its pronunciation. When this question had to be solved for educational institutions and for the man on the street, it was resolved with no difficulty, with the acceptance of the Sephardi pronunciation with minor variations as the language of everyday speech and learning. When, however, this question was posed with regard to the question of religious speech?such as reciting the Shema, the 69. R. Ben-Zion Meir Hai Ouziel was born in Jerusalem in 1880. In 1911, he was appointed Hakham Bashi (chief rabbi) for Jaffa under Ottoman rule, where he worked in harmony with the Ash kenazi Chief Rabbi Kook. Active in Zionist affairs, he was exiled by the Turks to Syria because of his pro-Jewish activities during World War I, but he returned to become chief rabbi of Tel Aviv and then Sephardi chief rabbi of Palestine (1939). He wrote three volumes of responsa between 1935^0 (1 : OH, YD; 2: EH; 3: HM). These were reissued in 1995-2000. 354</page><page sequence="21">The Politics of Pronunciation prayers, reading the Torah, and all matters which must be recited in the sacred tongue (leshon ha-kodesh)?we cannot agree on our own to all that seems aes thetic and rings nicely in our ears. We must find the solution for this question within the sources of the halakhah. From my conversations with several sages in our generations, I heard from them that they decided this issue with a sharp knife70 and said: a person does not fulfill his obligation to read obligatory readings except in the Ashkenazi pronunciation, and they decided based on proofs and theories that are untenable, that the Ashkenazi pronunciation is the basic and original pronunciation, invalidating all others. I have just recently seen the words of the great sage Rabbi A. I. Kook, who ruled that one should not switch from one pronunciation to another, because all such changes fall under the category of "one who read [the Shema] and did not articulate the letters" which is prohibited at the outset ... and in addition each community must adhere to its customary pronunciation because of [the verse] "and do not desert the Torah of your mother"71.... I myself was wont to say about this matter: since it is not for us to decide, and since an assembly of rabbis that is fit to hear the issue and decide did not yet do so, it is best to follow the ruling that "whosoever follows this view is in order, and whosoever follows this view is in order" (B. Berakhot 27a). I did not say this as a halakhic ruling; it is just that the reality is such, that a person cannot change his habits in which he was educated from youth when reciting the Shema and the Shemoneh Esreh and all obligatory readings.... However, because others had already ruled in this matter, and he, too, had received a query from abroad, R. Ouziel proceeds with a lengthy halakhic discussion of all the related issues, or those that were brought by others as germane to the problem. He concludes, From our discussion it emerges clearly that a change of pronunciation does not mean that the reader has not fulfilled his obligation, and even if we say that his pronunciation is wrong, all goes after the intentions of the heart and the expla nation of the matter. Anyone who recites and is careful to read properly in that particular tradition with which he is familiar or which he has chosen for himself, has fulfilled his obligation.... All this I have written in order to show that in my opinion we are not able to rule at the present time about choosing this or that pronunciation, nor are we able to say that one who reads in a pronunciation different from that of his 70. The source of this expression is the root of the words pesak, "halakhic decision," and lifsok, "to render a decision," which also means "to cut." R. Ouziel means to say that they rendered a clear-cut but harsh and radical decision. 71. See n. 45 herein. Actually, R. Kook did not cite this verse and the attendant gemara but rather B. Bezah 4b; see Responsum 2. 355</page><page sequence="22">Isaac B. Gottlieb father and teachers did not fulfill his religious obligation, or violated the precept "do not desert...." But this does not free us from dealing with this halakhah in depth and deter mining in an assembly {kenesiah) of rabbis and scholars the exact grammar of the language when it is read, that it be unified in all the synagogues and study halls.72 But we have missed the boat and now we stand before a fait accompli from which we cannot go back.... 4. HarZevi 2:4 (1945)73 About those who chose for themselves specifically {davka *) the Sephardi pro nunciation, and when they serve as the reader in the synagogue and also when uttering the ineffable Name of God in the form 'dny they pronounce the nun with a patah in place of a kamaz ... certainly it is proper to object to their actions.74 But where it is probable that our words will not be heeded, the Rabbis already said that it is a mizvah not to say something that will not be heard. 5. Heikhal Yizhak O.H. 3 (1945)75 Question: If one may change his pronunciation from Ashkenazi to Sephardi. He first cites the responsum on this question by R. Kook, who had already responded in 1932 in the negative, based on the following two principles: first, 72. "Exact grammar" is Hebrew dikdukah shel ha-safah; it seems to us he meant "exact pronunciation." 73. R. Zevi Pesah Frank (1873-1960) was chief rabbi of Jerusalem for many years. Born in Kovno, Lithuania, he came to Jerusalem at the age of twenty and was appointed to the Rabbinical High Court of Jerusalem in 1907 by R. Israel Salant. He was instrumental in establishing the chief rab binate of Palestine and invited R. Abraham Isaac Kook to serve as the first chief rabbi. Many of his responsa deal with actual issues in Israel and commandments related to the land. Three volumes of responsa arranged according to the Shulhan 'Arukh were issued posthumously: (YD) in 1964, (OH) in 1969, and (OH) 1973. Two volumes on laws related to agriculture in the Land of Israel, Sefer Har Zevi Zera'im, were issued in 1985 and 1991. 74. The Sephardi pronunciation of God's name 'dny as if it were written with patah under the nun rather than kamaz (the Masoretic pointing) comes up frequently in these responsa as a prime reason to forbid a change of pronunciation. See the discussion of Responsum 6, and n. 90 herein. 75. This responsum is addressed to a rabbi in Johannesburg, South Africa. The author, Rabbi Isaac Halevi Herzog (1887?1959), was born in Lomza, Poland. He studied at the University of London and the Sorbonne in Paris, where he received his doctorate for a thesis on "The Dyeing of Purple in Ancient Israel." In 1916-19, he was rabbi of Belfast, Ireland. He moved to Dublin to become first chief rabbi of the Irish Free State in 1925. In 1936, he was elected to succeed Rabbi Kook as Ashkenazi chief rabbi of Palestine. Aside from his English work, The Main Institutions of Jewish Law, he stood at the head of a committee of scholars that produced (in 1947) the first volume of Ozar ha-Posekim (volume 19 was published in 1995), a compendium of the responsa litera ture arranged according to the Shulhan 'Arukh. Three volumes of his responsa, Heikhal Yizhak, were published posthumously: 1 (EH) in 1960, 2 (EH) in 1967, and 3 (OH) in 1972. Between 1989 and 1991, all of his responsa were reissued in nine volumes under the title Pesakim u-Ketavim (Decisions and Writings). 356</page><page sequence="23">The Politics of Pronunciation changing one's pronunciation is considered as "one who read [the Shema] without ?76 enunciating the letters properly." Second, it is a violation of the prescription ?77 "forsake not the teaching of thy mother." R. Herzog takes issue with the second principle first, based on the fact that thousands of Jews in Russia and Poland changed the text of their prayers from nosah Ashkenaz (the Ashkenazi rite) to nosah Sefarad (the Sephardi rite) under the influence of Hasidism and with the approval of great halakhic authorities, notably R. Schneur Zalman of Lyady, the first Lubavitch Rebbe. As for the first principle, R. Herzog has great reservations about its applicability, citing once again an argument from reality: The Ashkenazim themselves make no distinction between het and heh, "and the pronunciation of het is close to that of heh"; further, there should be a difference between the pronunciation of tav without a dagesh and samekh, for they are two separate phonemes, yet we Ashkenazim do not distinguish between them at all; most Ashkenazim do not differentiate between 'alef and 'ayin, and some do not set apart the pro nunciation of shin from sin. Clearly we must conclude that these pronuncia tions do not put their speakers outside the pale of leshon ha-kodesh, for if they did, none of us would be executing the commandment to read the Shema properly, as well as the Priestly Blessing which must be recited in Hebrew {leshon ha-kodesh) by Torah law, and other pronouncements that must be made in leshon ha-kodesh. Because the Ashkenazi pronunciation with all its imperfections is considered leshon ha-kodesh, the Sephardi is no worse. Nevertheless, having rejected both of R. Kook's proofs, R. Herzog opposes a change in pronunciation for polemical reasons: Such a change may serve, in our generation and in places where the poison of Reform has spread so much, to our great chagrin, to bring many intellectuals and also the ordinary people to have impious thoughts about doubting the tra dition and fixed Jewish customs, and we must beware of making such an impression.... The Reform movement was the first in Europe to change the pronunciation to Sephardi, and though our brethren the Hasidim changed the rite of prayer, they did not change their pronunciation, and only the refor mers came and changed, and everything goes after the intention, and "the heart knows whether one intended to correct or to distort"78 ... and they only intended to be like the Gentiles. 76. M. Berakhot 2:3. 77. R. Herzog, like R. Ouziel (see n. 71 herein), is not accurately citing R. Kook's source, as the latter had referred to the principle "be careful with the customs of your fathers" (B. Bezah 4b); see Responsum 2. 78. An expression found in T. Shevi'it 3:8; and B. Sanh?drin 26a. 357</page><page sequence="24">Isaac B. Gottlieb At the conclusion of the responsum, he brings two further reasons for opposing the change: Changing the pronunciation will create arguments in the synagogue; most people will not learn the Sephardi pronunciation properly, as there are no Sephar dim in the questioner's community. 6. Heikhal Yizhak O.E. 1 (1951)79 Question: May God's name be pronounced in the Sephardi pronunciation, with a patah. (1) God's name written 'dny is found in the MT 134 times and the nun is always punctuated with a kamaz. Now Ibn Ezra (Genesis 19:18) says that 'dny in that verse carries a kamaz because it is the end of a verse; this means that every holy name receives a kamaz (which is why Ibn Ezra had to explain why this 'dny has a kamaz even though its meaning is profane)80 but not every kamaz renders the word holy. For example, if it comes at the end of a verse or has a pausal cantillation sign, it can be profane and yet take a kamaz. However, in the opinion of the Sages (against Ibn Ezra) this appearance of 'dny [in Genesis 19:18] is also holy (Shavuot 35b). Above (Genesis 18:3),81 there is a dispute among the Sages if the word is holy or profane, and Rashi brings both opinions in the Talmud, but he does not decide between them on the basis of the vocalization with a kamaz, see Nahmanides' commentary there; behold, as we said, every holy [ 'dny] has a kamaz, but not every [form with] kamaz is holy. (2) Of course there are infinite secrets here, but our Holy Torah is like a ladder rooted in the ground [the reference is to Jacob's ladder] whose head reaches the heavens, and the peshat [simple meaning of the text] is the first rung on the ladder. In the way o? peshat it seems that the intention [in the vocaliza tion of God's name as 'adonoy with kamaz] was to distinguish between one who speaks to a human king, calling him "my master" [Hebrew 'adoni], and one who addresses the Almighty, calling Him "Lord" in the plural form [ 'adonoy], meaning "master of masters," just as elohim is in the plural form, though He is one and there is no second to Him ... Further, when the created speaks to his Creator ... even if there is not a [syntactic] reason to pause, he must always pronounce the name of God as if it were a pausal form, for he must take a moment to contemplate what he has just uttered.82 (3) Therefore God forbid to say that there is some prohibition in pronoun cing God's name with a patah, and he who says thus is slandering our brethren the Sephardim, them and their fathers and their teachers ... who all pronounce the nun with an open vowel [patah]. Nonetheless, they distinguish between 79. The response was written to a questioner from Bnei Brak, who complained that members of his synagogue objected to the Sephardi pronunciation of God's name. 80. Lot addressed the people of Sodom as 'dny, "my masters." 81. The reference is to Abraham's address to the three angels (or the Lord, depending on the interpretation of 'dny). 82. In this way, R. Herzog explains why 'dny is vocalized with kamaz (the pausal form) rather than patah, which has the identical meaning but is the contextual form. 358</page><page sequence="25">The Politics of Pronunciation the holy and the profane because when it is holy they lengthen the open vowel somewhat, and we do so by pronouncing it with a closed vowel \kamaz]P Therefore, an Ashkenazi who prays in the Sephardi pronunciation should take care to extend the open vowel, but there is no prohibition to pronounce [God's name] with patah. (4) It is said in the name of the Hatam Sofer that it is prohibited to change pronunciations, but I do not recall that it was for that reason [pronouncing God's name with a patah] that he forbade the change, and even if such a thing is to be found in his writings, one cannot learn from it in all places, for he gave his ruling against the reformers-destroyers in Hamburg, who changed the pronuncia tion from Ashkenazi to Sephardi with malicious intent. 7. Kol Mevaser 2:12 (1955f4 On reading the Torah in the Sephardi pronunciation to a congregation where this pronunciation is not understood by everyone.85 R. Ratt cites Magen Avraham {Shulhan Arukh O.H. 68) about changing customs in prayer, likewise responsa Hatam Sofer (O.H. 15, 16; H.M. 188) about changing one's prayer from nosah Ashkenaz to nosah Sefarad. All this was said of changing the text of prayer, where "both are equally good" (Ecclesiastes 11:6), but in our case it is more severe, for if one errs in the vocalization while reading the Torah and the meaning is thereby changed, we make him repeat the reading. So too a reader {shaliah zibbur) who does not pronounce the letters properly, we do not allow him to officiate in the synagogue ... and in our case, changing the pronunciation so that he does not distinguish between kamaz and patah in reading God's name, reading the nun [of 'dny\ with a patah and making of the holy profane, this is a serious matter.... The outcome of all this is that in reading the Torah and public prayer let them hold fast to their received custom and they may not change to the Sephardi pronunciation. 83. "Open" and "closed" refer to the shape of the lips when pronouncing these vowels, and this is the source of their names (patah = open, kamaz = pursed, closed). "We" refers to Ashkenazim. R. Herzog claims that the Sephardi pronunciation lengthens the kamaz somewhat more than the short patah, while Ashkenazim make a qualitative rather than a quantitative difference. 84. R. Meshulam Ratt (1875-1963) was ordained at the age of twelve in Poland and served as rabbi in Romania. Active in the Zionist movement, he immigrated to Israel in 1949 and was a member of the chief rabbinate, where he served as advisor to the Rabbinical High Court. Among his responsa is a decision affirming the obligation to recite Hallel on Israel Independence Day. Two volumes of Kol Mevaser were published by Mosad Harav Kook, in 1955 and 1962. 85. The response was given to a rabbi in Capetown, South Africa. 359</page><page sequence="26">Isaac B. Gottlieb 8. Minhat Yizhak 3:9 (1958)86 Regarding changing the Ashkenazi pronunciation to the Israeli pronuncia tion in prayer and all matters of holiness:87 I want to alert His Honor88 to the efforts of several reformers, who noisily demand to change the regular Ashkenazi pronunciation, which we received from our fathers for prayer and for all matters of holiness, to the Israeli pro nunciation which was recently invented, based partially on the Sephardi pro nunciation. I come to express my opinion, that it is clearly prohibited by halakhah to change one's pronunciation for all matters of holiness for the fol lowing reasons: R. Weiss then makes the following claims: The rule cited by Magen Avraham {Shulhan Arukh O.H. 68) that one should not change the rites of prayer "clearly applies to pronunciation as well." Likewise, the rule that one has to be meticulous in his vocalization of consonants in the reading of the Shema*9 applies also to changing one's pronunciation. Further, the fact that Israeli Hebrew does not distinguish between kamaz and patah means that it does not dis tinguish between the holy and the profane in the reading of the word 'dny when it means "the Lord" (with kamaz), as opposed to when it means "my masters" (voca lized with patah). (The reference is to the word as it appears in Genesis 18:3 and to R. Bahya's comments in his Bible commentary ad loc.)90 He then quotes from the prayer book of R. Jacob Emden (Yaavetz), who writes, "In the matter of the vowels, how fortunate we are, unlike the Sephardim who do not distinguish between kamaz and patah, [and] in this they make the holy 86. Rabbi Yitzhak Yaakov Weiss (1902-89) was the head of a yeshiva in Munkacz, Hungary, then a dayyan (rabbinical judge) in Romania for twenty years. In 1948, he became the head of the Orthodox rabbinical court in Manchester, England. In 1970, he immigrated to Israel at the behest of the rebbe of Satmar, R. Yoel Teitelbaum (see the introduction to vol. 10 of Minhat Yizhak), where he assumed the position of the head of the court (Badaz) of the Edah Haredit, the ultra-Orthodox com munity in Jerusalem. He authored ten volumes of responsa. Eight appeared between 1956 and 1983, volume 9 in 1985, and 10 in 1989, shortly after his death. All ten were reissued in five volumes in 1993. 87. "All matters of holiness" is a talmudic term (kol davar she-bi-kdushah) referring to prayer, Torah reading, benedictions, and other vocal religious performances. 88. The "responsum" is addressed to the chief rabbi of Great Britain, Rabbi Israel Brodie, and appears to be a letter initiated by R. Weiss rather than a response to a question. 89. This is the principle cited by Rabbi Kook (see Responsa 1 and 2), who is not cited by R. Weiss. 90. The word 'dny in Genesis 18:3 is vocalized in the Masoretic Bible with kamaz. R. Weiss quotes extensively from Bahya's Torah commentary, Genesis 18:1, where he writes that "even though it seems that the kamaz and patah are one and the same, the identical vowel, it is not so, but there is a difference between them in pronunciation." Bahya speaks of "high" and "low" vowels, but he seems to be using these terms as metaphors for spiritual qualities of the vowel signs and not as phonetic descriptions. He also ascribes kab balistic values to these vowel signs. Bahya b. Asher ibn Halawa of Saragossa, Spain, wrote a Bible com mentary (in 1291) based on that of Nahmanides. He was a student of R. Solomon b. Abraham ibn Adret (Rashba), himself a disciple of Nahmanides. He is not to be confused with Bahya ibn Pakuda, the eleventh-century philosopher and author of Duties of the Heart. 360</page><page sequence="27">The Politics of Pronunciation profane ... and I always wondered about this, till I discovered that the rabbi and kabbalist Bahya also objected to this, and he was one of them91 ... besides which they reduce the number of holy dots [the vowels] which were given at Sinai, for they have no recognizable patah92 and the holam is completely missing from amongst them93 ... likewise they identified the segol with the zereh94 and for their language malady there is no cure."95 R. Weiss then sums up the evidence he marshaled from Bahya and Emden: What is left for us to say, if they [Bahya, Emden] wrote all this against the Sephardi pronunciation which was their received tradition,96 and certainly in the case of the Israeli pronunciation, which is only partially taken from their pronunciation. How right are the words of a maskil on this topic,97 who said that the modern Hebrew pronunciation unites within it the flaws of all the pronunciations: the lack of distinction between patah and kamaz like the Sephardim, and the lack of pronunciation of the guttural letters [i.e., identity between 'alef and 'ayin, khaf and het, etc.] like the Ashkenazim.98 91. That is, a Sephardi. 92. Because they pronounce the kamaz in the same way. 93. See the discussion of Responsa 11 and 12. Ashkenazim pronounce the holam as oy (Eastern Europe), aw (Germany), or the word "oh" (United States), while for Sephardim (and Israelis), it approximates the l?l in "long". To the Ashkenazi's ear, the Sephardi holam is identical to his own pro nunciation of the kamaz, and hence for Emden, the Sephardi holam is "missing." 94. These vowels are identical in Sephardi pronunciation?lei?like the Ashkenazi segol. 95. It should be noted that Emden wrote in rhymed verse; consequently, some of his phrases are exaggerated for the sake of the rhyme or wordplay 96. R. Jacob Emden was an Ashkenazi who served a Sephardi community. Already his father, the Hakham Zvi, did so in Holland, which is the source of his title hakham, "sage." This may be why R. Weiss uses the words "they," "their," implying that Emden was also a Sephardi. However, Emden's language earlier, "and he [Bahya] was one of them," clearly shows that he placed some distance between himself and the Sephardi community. 97. It is not clear whether maskil here means one who is conversant in non-Torah subjects such as language or someone who is a product of the Haskalah. 98. Polemics aside, R. Weiss's claim has linguistic support. David Tene, late professor of med ieval Hebrew at the Hebrew University and a member of the Israel Academy for the Hebrew Language, wrote about the 1913 decision of the Hebrew Language Council (Va'ad ha-Lashon ha-'Ivrit) to rec ommend that the Sephardi pronunciation be taught in Palestinian schools: "Both in the system of con sonants and vowels David Yellin and his followers strove to establish a pronunciation which would give each letter of the alphabet and each vocalization sign a unique sound. From this aspect, the eastern [Sephardi] pronunciation is more accurate and more correct than the Ashkenazi pronunciation. But as far as the vowels, the Ashkenazi and Yemenite vocalizations are superior to the Sephardi vocalization in the number of vowel realizations, and the Sephardi pronunciation is less accurate and less correct than the other two, as reflected in the Tiberian punctuation of Hebrew" (David Tene, "Shalosh he'arot al hakhvanat ha-lashon ha-'Ivrit l"tPrK|"-tfi (1890-1990)" in Ha-lashon ha-'Ivrit be-hitpathutah u-ve-hithadshutah, ed. Joshua Blau [Jerusalem, 1996], 224). Rabbi Kook's words in Responsa 1 and 2, make the identical point. See also Aharon Dotan, '"Inyanei hagayah ba-tefilah u-bi-kriyat ha-Torah," in Sefer Shivtiel, 68-76, who discusses the different pronunciations of kamaz katan in the Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Israeli traditions. 361</page><page sequence="28">Isaac B. Gottlieb And I say all this even if the intention of the reformers were for the sake of heaven ... but they only have a national intention, because this [Sephardi pronunciation] is now the spoken language in the State of Israel.... 9. Minhat Yizhak A'Al (1965) Rabbi Weiss returns to this subject in a responsum addressed to R. Israel Waltz of Jerusalem, "formerly a rabbi in Budapest," who had sent Weiss several lengthy comments in support of R. Weiss' positions, including the above respon sum. R. Weiss cites the writer's comments in full. Of interest are several sources that R. Waltz cites that not only allow for a change in pronunciation but actually promote it: But I am amazed at the great sage Ridbaz99 in his responsa Bet Ridbaz (No. 27, p. 64a) who responded to a Sephardi rabbi as follows: "It would seem that your pronunciation of Hebrew is more accurate than ours, because we, as a result of our sins, wandered from place to place, from exile to exile, more than you did, therefore I would believe that your Hebrew pronunciation is the more accurate." This quote was cited by the Ziz Eliezer100 who did not comment on it at all; but all his [i.e., Ridbaz] words are opposed to Bahya and to R. Yaavetz and to our great rabbi the Maharal of Prague. And behold, in the work Yaskil Avdi (part 2, O.H. 3)101 the author relates that the great and holy R. Nathan Adler, the teacher of the Hatam Sofer, changed his custom and taught himself to pray in the Sephardi pronunciation, but who knows what his intention was in this, and who can compare in his ways to R. Adler? 10. Ziz Eliezer 7:28 (1962)102 R. Waldenberg was asked whether one could accept a position to recite the Kiddush on Friday nights in the Sephardi pronunciation for a group of nurses who spoke Hebrew in the Israeli fashion. He answered that there was no problem here of "abandoning one's custom" because it was being done on a 99. R. Yaakov David b. Ze'ev Willowsky, Safed (1845-1914), not to be confused with Radbaz, R.

Born in Jerusalem, he became a leading rabbinical authority who stood at the helm of the kabbalist yeshiva Bet El and served as a judge in the Rabbinical High Court. The first volume of his responsa Yaskil Avdi was published in Jerusalem in 1939 and the eighth after his death, in 1983. 102. R. Eliezer Waldenberg (1915-2006) was a member of the Rabbinical High Court of Jeru salem. His responsa deal with modern problems, specifically issues of medicine and halakhah. In addition to the responsa Ziz Eliezer (22 volumes), he wrote Hilkhot Medinah (1952), devoted to halakhic issues relating to the state of Israel.

I won't deal at length with the issue, since I was asked about a temporary change, but I will mention what Yaskil Avdi cites about R.

I likewise cite what I have seen in the responsa Bet Ridbaz who, in an aside at the end of a teshuvah writes to a ques tioner who was a Sephardi rabbi, "It would seem that your pronunciation of Hebrew (leshon ha-kodesh) is superior to ours".... "As I said," concludes R. Waldenberg, "I will not at present render a decision on the question whether one may change his pronunciation, and I cited the above just to strengthen what we wrote above that in the question at hand, there is no room at all for doubt, and one may change his pronunciation even if he himself intends to fulfill his own obligation [to hear Kiddush] with this recitation." 11. Iggerot Moshe 5: O.H. 5 (1969)103 Because of the detailed and complex halakhic reasoning in this responsum, we decided not to risk misrepresenting Rabhi Feinstein's ideas by a selective trans lation. Instead, we ask the interested reader to see the original. We only present that part of the teshuvah that offers his linguistic analysis, discussed above on page 346: The reason that two different pronunciations are to be considered leshon ha kodesh even though only one of them is the correct way104 is as follows: if a large community reads the same letters and vowels in a set pronunciation, this has to be considered the holy tongue even if it deviates from the original pro nunciation in which the Torah was given. And we must conclude thus, 103. R. Moses (Reb Moshe) Feinstein (1895-1986) was the premier halakhic authority in the United States in the second half of the twentieth century. He was born in Russia and served as a rabbi there until his immigration to the United States in 1937. He was known internationally for his written responsa, Iggerot Moshe. Seven volumes appeared during his lifetime, and an eighth was issued by his sons and grandsons in 1996, edited by R. Shabtai A. Rappoport. The following is a bibliography of R. Feinstein's responsa, subtitled by the section of the Shulhan Arukh with which they deal: 1. OH (New York, 1959); 2. YD (New York, 1959); 3. EH (New York, 1961 [on the title page of the last rep rinting, the Hebrew date is given as "5734" (1974)]); 4. HM/OH part 2/EH part 2 (New York, 1963); 5. YD part 2/OH part 3/EH part 3 (New York, 1973); 6. OH part 4/Y.D. part 3 (Bnei Brak, 1981 [the latest printing reads "Brooklyn, New York 5742"(1981)]); 7. EH part 4/HM part 2 (Bnei Brak, 1985); 8. OH part 5/YD part 4 (Jerusalem, 1996). We refer to the volume and responsum number (e.g., 1:OH104) according to the foregoing listing. The date given is the date of the individual responsum. 104. R. Feinstein earlier reasoned that during the First Temple period prior to the exile, all Jews must have spoken in an identical way. 363</page><page sequence="30">Isaac B. Gottlieb because there are also strange pronunciations within Ashkenazi Hebrew itself between different countries, as between the pronunciation of the Lithuanians and the Polish and the Hungarians; for we are all Ashkenazim and we cannot say that from the beginning there were particular pronunciations, but there are certain corruptions [which arise] in one locale and which become, with the passing of time, the regular pronunciation of those people in their languages, and the change affects their pronunciation of leshon ha-kodesh as well.... 105 12. Iggerot Moshe 6: O.H. 65 (1980)106 A boy in Argentina who was educated in the Sephardi pronunciation wants to read the Torah in the synagogue on his bar mitzvah and to lead the prayers, even though the custom of the synagogue is to use the Ashkenazi pronunciation. R. Feinstein confirms his previous responsum against making such changes and expresses his opinion that the Ashkenazi pronunciation should be taught in "our [American, South American] schools," but since it is now several years that our elementary and yeshivah high schools teach in the Sephardi pronunciation, many parents do not want to trouble their children to now master the Ashkenazi pronunciation, and they leave the [Ashke nazi] synagogue for another. Some also turn to Conservative synagogues, a loss, both financial and personal, for the synagogue 'Ahdut Yisra e/107.... It should be instituted for the sake of peace (mipney ha-shalom) that the lad read the Torah in the synagogue, and let them read the parashah in the Ashkenazi pronunciation as is their custom in another room even if there be present only a quorum often. If there is an early minyan in the synagogue, it is enough that they read the Torah in the usual tradition in the early minyan. And if the boy wants to be the hazzan, since we do not rely on the prayers of the reader, save for the kedushah and answering Amen [to his blessing] and the Modim prayer, one should not be strin gent about this, if it happens several times a year. R. Feinstein then goes on to speculate that perhaps, with the founding of the syna gogue, there were only a few people whose reading tradition was Ashkenazi. He wonders out loud whether they had the right to set down the custom for the syna gogue, "because they knew and built the synagogue with the idea that perhaps those who would come after them [who pray in the Sephardi pronunciation] might be the majority." 105. R. Feinstein presumes that the various pronunciations in Hebrew stem from different pronunciations in the languages of those countries. He may have had in mind the realization of holam as lui by parts of German-speaking Hungarian Jewry, who transferred the umlaut to their Hebrew reading. 106. Chronologically, this teshuvah belongs after the responsum of Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef. However, we present the two responsa of Rabbi Feinstein together. 107. An Orthodox synagogue in Argentina that follows the German (Ashkenazi) rite fastidiously. 364</page><page sequence="31">The Politics of Pronunciation 13. Yabia Omer 6: O.H.I 1 (1976)108 R. Ovadia Yosef responded to an Israeli-Ashkenazi questioner who inquired whether, having been educated in the Sephardi pronunciation of everyday Hebrew and having grown accustomed to praying in the same pronunciation, he had now to revert back to the Ashkenazi pronunciation so as not to violate the verse "And do not forsake the instruction of your mother" (Proverbs 1:8). R. Yosef combined this question with another:109 Could members of an Ashkenazi synagogue whose custom was to pray and read the Torah in the Sephardi pronuncia tion now return to the Ashkenazi pronunciation? This had become an issue between those members who wanted to return to the custom of their fathers, the Ashkenazi pronunciation, and others who wished to maintain the Sephardi-Israeli way. In par ticular, the questioner mentions the pronunciation of God's name, which the Ashke nazi tradition vocalizes with kamaz { adonoy), while the Sephardim, who do not differentiate between patah and kamaz, sound it with lal {'adonay). R. Yosef writes that "I am going to answer in extreme brevity," but in fact this is a very lengthy responsum.110 Here are the salient points in Rabbi Yosef s reply (the para graph numbers/letters are in the original): (a) Regarding the pronunciation of the consonants, there is no doubt that the correct and true pronunciation is Sephardi, because the Sephardim distinguish between het and an aspirated khaf between kof and a geminated kaf and between samekh and a "soft" tav. Likewise, between 'alef and 'ayin, unlike the Ashkenazim.... (d) But as regards the vocalization of the vowels, no one amongst us knows to decide between Ashkenazim and Sephardim and generally speaking every ethnic group goes by its father's customs ... Now as regards the pronunciation of kamaz and patah, even though most Sephardim do not distinguish between them,... nevertheless the more meticulous distinguish between kamaz which is a long vowel {tenu'ah gedolah) and patah which is a short vowel {tenu ah ketanah). Even though the difference is slight, nevertheless the knowledgeable can hear the distinction.111 108. Born in Baghdad, Iraq, in 1920, R. Ovadiah Yosef came to Israel at the age of four, studied in yeshivot in the old City of Jerusalem, and was ordained by Chief Rabbi Ouziel. He is a former Sephardi chief rabbi of Israel (Rishon le-Zion) and is considered the foremost Sephardi halakhic auth ority. His two responsa collections are Yabia Omer (ten volumes, 1954-2004) and Yehaveh Da 'at (six volumes, 1977-1980). The date given here is the publication date of the volume. 109. It is unclear whether the second question was sent by the first person, a second questioner, or whether R. Yosef himself phrased it. The ambiguity arises because R. Yosef presents the first ques tion in his own words (as he generally does), referring to the questioner in third-person ("I was asked by a young scholar"). However, at the conclusion of this second query, the responsum seems to adopt the voice of the questioner: "Let him [R. Yosef] show us the path to the light." 110. In the printed volume, the responsum runs ten and a half columns, two columns per page. 111. In his responsum, (see n. 83 herein), Rabbi Herzog makes a similar argument. Perhaps the "lengthened" quality of the kamaz that they both take note of is the fact that the last vowel in the name 'dny is a diphthong. 365</page><page sequence="32">Isaac B. Gottlieb R. Yosef then discusses Bahya's comment to Genesis 18:3. Bahya, a thirteenth century Spanish biblical commentator associated with mystical currents in Judaism, which had been previously cited by R. Weiss in Minhat Yizhak as criticiz ing the lack of distinction in Sephardi pronunciation between these two vowels. R. Yosef demurs; on the contrary, Bahya was describing the meticulous Sephardi pronunciation. How could Bahya have had the Ashkenazi vocalization in mind when he wrote, "Even though it seems that the kamaz and patah are one and the same, the identical vowel, it is not so, but there is a difference in their pronun ciation," when the Ashkenazim make such a clear difference between them? Rather, Bahya was describing the Sephardi pronunciation of these two vowels, which is very close, almost "one and the same," but when properly enunciated, not identical. Bahya was advising the reader to make a slight difference between kamaz and patah when pronouncing God's name in the Sephardi tra dition. At this point, R. Yosef makes an aside about the Ashkenazim, who "sound their kamaz like our holam [l?l], and in their holam they stick in an additional yod [%/]."112 R. Yosef quotes the work Noheg Kazon Yosef, which opines that "even though the Sephardim read the vowels correctly, nevertheless we (Ashkenazim) should not read them differently than is our tradition, because our community is used to this way." From here, says Yosef, we see that an Ashkenazi authority praises the Sephardi pronunciation as the correct one, "and he must have heard the slight difference of the meticulous among us who distinguish between kamaz and patah." As is his fashion, R. Yosef then cites a plethora of sources that deal with this question. He cites everyone who wrote before him, those we have cited here and many more, and critiques their views. He cites Ear Zevi (4), who is unhappy about Ashkenazim who want to take on the Sephardi pronunciation of Hebrew in the synagogue, particularly with regard to the pronunciation of God's name with patah rather than kamaz, relying on what Bahya wrote. Next, R. Yosef cites Kol Mevaser (7), who feels that switching pronunciations from Ashkenazi to Sephardi is worse than switching the prayers from the Ashkenazi rite to the Sephardi, again relying on Bahya's comment. R. Yosef then responds, (4) With all due respect to both of them [Har Zevi, Kol Mevaser], they did not pay attention to the fact that the Ashkenazi pronunciation of God's name ['adon?y] where the nun is pronounced as if with our holam is much worse, even according to Bahya's own logic, and this change is done fla grantly.113 Bahya's whole intent was to be meticulous in pronouncing the 112. He is describing the Eastern European vocalization of the holam. In Germany, it was sounded as the diphthong I owl. See the discussion of R. Feinstein's responsa, numbers 11 and 12. 113. R. Yosef is not speaking only of the final syllable I noy I but, as we cited earlier, also about the second syllable Idol, which the Ashkenazim pronounce /doy/. It would seem that the Ashkenazi pronunciation of the holam [?] as l?yl is, to R. Yosef's ears, much more of a strident violation of the rules of pronunciation than the pronunciation of kamaz as patah among the Sephardim. 366</page><page sequence="33">The Politics of Pronunciation kamaz, as do the knowledgeable Sephardim. But there is no support whatso ever for the Ashkenazi pronunciation [of kamaz] from Bahya. (5) I saw a responsum of Rabbi Unterman [former Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel] cited in Keter Efrayim, page 360, who claimed that since in these times hundreds of thousands of our brethren joined us [in Israel] who never heard the Ashkenazi pronunciation, and two generations here were educated only in accord with the Sephardi pronunciation, we cannot deny them the right to read and to pray in the pronunciation in which they were raised and edu cated. Certainly those today in Israel who still pray in the Ashkenazi fashion can understand the Torah reading and the prayers in the Sephardi pro nunciation, which is the pronunciation they hear all day long in conversations, speeches, and the news.... And I heard that the Torah giant R. Isaac of Volozhin used to reread the Shema daily in the Sephardi pronunciation after he had completed the prayers, for perhaps that was the most correct pronunciation of Hebrew, and with regard to a Torah commandment he took the stringent position [to repeat the Shema]. The final conclusion, one cannot force someone who regularly prays in one pronunciation to switch to another, even if the majority in the synago gue is accustomed to another pronunciation [meaning that the questioner need not switch to the Ashkenazi pronunciation even if that was what most of the worshippers wanted]. However, the reader {shaliah zibbur) and Torah reader must comply with the wishes of the majority. But there is no doubt that in the end, the Sephardi pronunciation will reign supreme in all places, and when the youth who study in our schools grow up, this pronunciation will be accepted in all places.... And more than this I say, that where there is no argument amongst the worshippers in the synagogue, then they may switch over to the Sephardi pronunciation even at the outset {le-khathillah), as did the great Gaon Rabbi Nathan Adler. [R. Yosef had earlier cited the story of R. Adler of Germany, who changed his prayer pronunciation to the Sephardi, thinking it to be more correct.] In this way we can draw Israeli youth closer to the worship of God, to attend the synagogue on a regular basis ... because the Ashkenazi pronunciation is foreign to them and he who comes to the synagogue once will not continue to so. In conclusion, an Ash kenazi who was educated in the Sephardi pronunciation may continue in this fashion, and there is not the slightest prohibition of "Do not desert the teachings of your mother."
