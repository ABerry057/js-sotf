Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1998. xiii, 355 pp. Benjamin D. Sommer elevates the analysis of inner-biblical interpretation to the next level of sophistication and rigor in this volume, a substantially revised ver- sion of his University of Chicago doctoral dissertation written under the direction of Michael Fishbane. He focuses on the reuse of older biblical material in a spe- cific biblical text, Isaiah 40-66. These chapters of the book of Isaiah, seen as an addition made a century and a half later to Isaiah 1-39, are assigned to an anony- mous sixth-century prophet called, for the sake of convenience, Deutero-Isaiah. By treating the reuse of older biblical material in Deutero-Isaiah, Sommer is able to delineate what might be distinctive in Deutero-Isaiah's methods of inner-biblical interpretation, a desirable next step in the analysis of inner-biblical interpretation. What is impressive in Sommer's book is his ability to move to larger issues in bib- 350</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews lical studies and to parallel issues in other academic and intellectual pursuits often ignored in biblical studies. The book also exhibits a clarity of writing and argu- ment in what in many ways is a highly technical subject. Sommer commences with a discussion of the distinction between allusion and intertextuality, defining his project as an analysis of allusion because allusion reflects the intent of an author, whereas intertextuality is a construct in the mind of the reader. This allows him to sidestep the difficulty of determining whether a reader would even recognize the reuse of material and, more importantly, to con- nect the text to the guiding hand of a particular prophet and to connect that prophet to his time and place in the historical development of Israelite religion. Sommer isolates the stylistic traits of Deutero-Isaiah's reuse of older mate- rial and argues that Deutero-Isaiah, while often making recourse to methods of in- ner-biblical exegesis used elsewhere, utilizes a number of methods whose combi- nation is rarely found elsewhere. He often splits up a phrase from older material into a unit in which the constituent parts of the phrase may be separated by sever- al words or even several verses. This is employed in combination with word play, where a borrowed word is used in a different sense from its source, and sound play, where words from Deutero-Isaiah's source are linked to similar-sounding words in his oracles. Sommer links Deutero-Isaiah's allusions to his theological program. For example, material that refers to the Davidic monarch is typically transformed by Deutero-Isaiah to refer to the Israelite nation as a whole. Deutero-Isaiah delib- erately excludes mention of the Davidic monarchy because his theology excludes the restoration of the David monarchy. Sommer shows that Deutero-Isaiah makes extensive use of material from other prophets. One of Sommer's most interesting conclusions is that, while Deutero- Isaiah does allude to material from First Isaiah, he makes more extensive use of Jeremiah. This refutes the claim made by some biblicists that Deutero-Isaiah pos- sesses an organic connection to First Isaiah and was intentionally written as an ap- pendix to First Isaiah. The ramification of this is that the placement of Deutero- Isaiah on an Isaianic scroll is mere coincidence. Deutero-Isaiah could have, by chance, been placed on a scroll at the conclusion of Jeremiah. Sommer's chapter on Deutero-Isaiah's use of psalms carefully grapples with the quandary of identifying allusions to material that is so stereotypical. When the psalms sound so much alike, how can it be determined that Deutero-Isaiah is re- ferring to a particular psalm rather than utilizing psalmic language in general? Throughout his study, Sommer struggles with the tentativeness of identifying al- lusions, but it is here that his argumentation is most rigorous. Sommer concludes his volume by placing Deutero-Isaiah's activity into a general scheme of development. Deutero-Isaiah bases his prophecy on older prophecies rather than on direct experience of the divine word; his prophetic of- fice is textualized in allusion and recasting of older words. In this way, Deutero- Isaiah prefigured the tendency of the Second Temple period to rely on the inter- pretation of texts so as to become a hermeneutically based religion. Furthermore, Deutero-Isaiah's confirmation of older prophecies of doom is employed to prove that earlier prophets spoke accurately, thus legitimizing the entire enterprise of prophecy. At the same time, the use of allusions strengthens Deutero-Isaiah's own 351</page><page sequence="3">AJS Review authority. Deutero-Isaiah's repetition of messages of comfort, called by the term "reprediction," and his reversal of earlier negative prophecies to positive ones, which conforms to Deutero-Isaiah's message of restoration, are legitimated be- cause they are based themselves on authoritative material. Of course, one could always quibble that some of the allusions Sommer iden- tifies are not certain but merely possible, but such objections are basically imma- terial. Mildly troubling, however, are the boundaries Sommer sets around certain texts that have been identified as later than Deutero-Isaiah and his refusal to treat possible allusions to them in Deutero-Isaiah. A future study could focus on the use of allusion to date texts, especially pentateuchal texts. In sum, Sommer's outstanding volume sparkles with originality and is a stimulating advance in the study of inner-biblical interpretation.
