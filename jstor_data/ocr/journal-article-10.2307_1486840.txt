Hanover, N.H.: Brandeis University Press, 1992. 191 pp. At a time when it has become difficult even to keep track of all the current scholarship in the field of Jewish studies, it is remarkable that there is still so little available on the history of the Ashkenazi civilization of Eastern Europe, the world from which the majority of present-day Jews are directly descended. The reasons for this cannot concern us here, but its results should; even in academic circles, a great deal of our thinking about this rather major portion of the past continues to rely on "what my bubbie told me." This applies particularly to the highly charged issue of relations between Jews and their coterritorial neighbors, and above all with the Poles. On the subject of Polish-Jewish relations, Jews and Poles, in and out of academia, hold opinions whose certainty seems to vary in inverse proportion to the state of their knowledge. The book under review is a significant and, in several respects, unique contribution to this sorely needed knowledge. Hardly by coincidence, it is also an excellent example of interdisciplinary and multicultural studies. The authors, a Polish and a Jewish literary historian, have set themselves the task of tracking the traces, in both Polish and Jewish literature, of a key event in Polish history. The 1863 Polish insurrection against the Russians was the watershed in the creation of a modern Polish national identity; it created a myth of national resistance and martyrdom that animated Polish freedom struggles for well over a century, beginning against the tsars, and continuing against the Nazis and the Soviets. But this event also inspired an influential image of Polish-Jewish comradeship-in-arms, an alliance for freedom between (in the words of Antoni Slonimski, a twentieth-century Polish poet of Jewish origin) "the two saddest nations on earth." Chronicling the development of this image in Polish and Jewish literary texts resonates far beyond the texts themselves; in Eastern Europe, literature and literary symbols, as the authors are well aware, easily function as politics and, indeed, as prophecy. This is the stuff out of which national mythologies as well as national antagonisms are created and sustained. The significance of the present study, particularly at this moment in history, certainly transcends the Polish-Jewish context. For many readers of this book, the notion of Polish-Jewish fraternity, let alone the idea of a mystical Polish-Jewish union with messianic objectives,</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 431 originally propounded by the Polish national poet Adam Mickiewicz in the 1840s, will come as something of a surprise. While actual Jewish involvement in the 1863 uprising was largely limited to small groups of upper-class youth primarily in Warsaw, it included some powerfully evocative moments, among them the sermons of Dov Meisels, the Orthodox chief rabbi of Warsaw, preaching support for the rebels, and the martyrdom of Michal Landy, a young Jew shot by Russian troops as he lifted a cross carried by a fallen Polish comrade during a demonstration. In Polish literature of the uprising and the years immediately following, as this study reveals, the image of "the Jew with the cross," along with references to the Maccabees and other Old Testament imagery, is everpresent, no less a part of the emerging insurrectionary mythology than the well-known slogan, "For our freedom, and for yours." Contemporary Jewish sources are disproportionately fewer. They are the product of a handful of rationalist maskilim, distant observers of the events themselves, writing in Hebrew, Yiddish, German, and Russian, for whom a multinational empire was generally preferable to a uninational state, and who were particularly mistrustful of religiously tinged Polish nationalism. Their image of Jewish involvement in the insurrection was, as the authors conclude, "almost the exact opposite of the Polish perception" (p. 96). The second half of the study traces the fate of the idea of Polish-Jewish brotherhood during the half-century between the uprising and World War I. Championed at first by the Polish positivists, who encouraged Jews to put their economic expertise in the service of the Polish nation and to assimilate into Polish culture, the notion was increasingly undermined by economic, social, and political change. For one thing, capitalism, as it developed in Poland and indeed throughout Eastern Europe, was mired not only in class but in national antagonisms; the Polish intelligentsia, primarily of gentry origin, increasingly viewed Jewish entrepreneurship and Jewish money as enemies of Polish values. It also began to occur to them that, even given the opportunity, Jews might not want to become "good Poles." The rise of Jewish nationalism, in both its Zion- and Diaspora-affirming varieties, was paralleled by the spread of a new sort of Polish nationalism whose cornerstones were ethnicity, Catholicism, and antisemitism. On the eve of Polish independence, the ideology of "Kochajmy sie" ("Let's love one another"), inspired by Mickiewicz and the symbols of 1863, appeared as "a vision of a golden age tainted with the bitterness of unfulfilled expectations"</page><page sequence="3">432 BOOK REVIEWS (p. 143). The authors trace this growing bitterness in the mutual stereotypes of Poles and Jews as reflected in canonized literature, as well as, much to the authors' credit, in the rapidly growing genre of popular literature. There are sophisticated observations here, as, for example, reflections on the political function of literary naturalism in debunking Romantic mythology and helping to introduce a biological stratum into both Polish and Jewish nationalism. While the authors were wise in not undertaking the entire subject of Polish-Jewish relations in history, their study leans somewhat too far in the opposite direction, and suffers from an insufficiently developed historical framework. Like it or not, scholars of East European history cannot assume their readers' familiarity with the outlines of their subject in the manner of their Western counterparts. The readers of this English-language study, most of whose sources are Polish, would have greatly benefitted, for example, from a simple chronicle of the events of 1863 and of the Warsaw pogrom of 1881. The omission of any discussion of events prior to the 1850s is also regrettable. For example, the reality, as well as the mythology, of modern Polish-Jewish comradeship-in-arms did not begin in 1863, but in 1795, when a Jewish regiment commanded by Berek Joselewicz fought under Tadeusz Kosciuszko against the Russians in the final defense of the Polish Commonwealth. While Joselewicz receives passing mention in this study, the importance of his example is never made clear; yet it was his name, more than that of Michal Landy, that functioned as a synonym for Polish-Jewish brotherhood well into the present century. More generally, in not extending its scope, if only in a historical overview, to the Polish Commonwealth, the study misses an important perspective on both the meaning of the 1863 uprising and the myth of Polish-Jewish brotherhood. For the uprising was a true watershed; it was as much about the past as about the future, as much about the longings of the Polish nobility for Old Poland as about modern nationalism. The authors note that the positive images of Jews in late-nineteenth-century Polish literature tapped the "categories and values characteristic of a traditional, premodern society" (p. 146), while the negative images of Poles in Jewish literature drew on the traditional Jewish stereotype of the "evil nobleman" (p. 113) Behind this welter of images stand centuries of a unique alliance between Jews and the Polish nobility that terms such as "traditional" and "premodern" are insufficient to characterize.
