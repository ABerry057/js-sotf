Leiden: Brill, 2001. xii, 301 pp. German Jewish communities underwent momentous changes in status, com- position, and character during the fifteenth century, yet apart from its intellectual legacy, this period has merited scant attention from historians. Even contempo- raries viewed the post-plague German communities as a diminished and spent shadow of their vital medieval Ashkenazic predecessors, and historiography has maintained this perception. Scholars characterized the period as one of intellectu- al decline, population shrinkage and expulsion from the remaining cities that had not destroyed or expelled their Jewish communities during the bubonic plague depredations. Despite the real devastation caused by the fourteenth-century chaos, much vibrant life remained within German Jewish communities.' Little has been 1.

Bell's book intends to fill this gap. Neither a social history, nor an intellectual history of fifteenth-century Germans and Jews, it is a pioneering attempt to track the changing definitions of Jewish and Christian identity in the fifteenth century. It is an ambitious enter- prise. Bell begins by examining the changes that led to the exclusion of Jews from German cities in the course of the fifteenth century. A rich trove of chronicles, records, sermons, and other primary sources written by Christian contemporaries of the events forms the foundation for Bell's analysis. Bell puts these sources to excellent use. His first chapter focuses on changes in the governance of German cities in a critical period of their growth, c. 1300-1500. It is followed by a dis- cussion of the changes taking place in urban morality with a late medieval theo- logical shift of emphasis to moral behavior rather than sacrament as the agent of spiritual transformation. The influence of penitential sermons on the urban population and the lai- cization of sacred spaces led to the blurring of boundaries within the cities between profane and sacred spheres. Bell's strength lies in his direct analysis of primary sources. His discussion of the role of language is rather derivative and banal when it rounds up secondary theoretical material. But as soon as Bell gets to an actual chronicle and its specific locutions, such as that of Burkhard Zink and his use of various terms that denote inclusion or exclusion, particularly the term gemain, Bell's work shines. Bell's study of the changing Jewish community and its self-definitions in this period combines similar balances of strengths and weakness. He marks the transi- tion from the period in which the kehillah was the primary repository of commu- nal authority before the Black Death, to the reconfiguration of Jewish settlement patterns after the plague, which resulted in the formation of regional associations (but no reference to the monumental work of Daniel Cohen on Landjuden- schaften), as an essential turning point. He has made excellent use of the newest volumes of Germania Judaica which cover the years until 1519, even devoting a special appendix to it (Appendix A-E, 255-260), but other important works, such as the monographs of Hava Fraenkel-Goldschmidt, are underutilized. Bell's strengths as a close reader highlight one of the primary puzzles of this work: his persistent, even perverse, resort to filtering primary texts through sec- ondary sources whenever possible, including primary sources available in editions listed in his bibliography and used elsewhere in the book. Why cite Terumat ha- Deshen of Isserlein (p. 172) from the Ben-Sasson textbook when it is listed among the primary sources and available in modern editions? Or R.
