<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review 26:2 (2002) "ARAB CHAINS" AND "THE GOOD THINGS OF SEPHARAD"* Aspects of Jewish Exile by Marc Saperstein and Nancy E. Berg The following article has emerged from an experimental, interdisciplinary course, co-taught by the authors in the fall of 1996, entitled "Exile: Jews, Litera- ture, and History." From the dozens of primary texts used in the course, we have se- lected six to illustrate the literary-conceptual analysis employed. Beyond the in- trinsic aesthetic appeal of the passages, they have been chosen to exemplify the diversity of relevant material: in genre (poetry, disputational and homiletical liter- ature, drama, fiction, memoir), cultural-historical context over the past millenium (Muslim and Christian Spain, eastern Europe, twentieth-century Egypt and Israel), community (Sephardic, Ashkenazic, and Middle Eastern Jews) and language of au- thorship (Hebrew, Arabic, and English). Starting with one of the most familiar texts of post-biblical Jewish literature, we move in the modern period to decidedly less- known works, challenging simplistic assumptions about "canon" in research about the Jewish past. The juxtaposition of pre-modern and modern texts is intended to highlight both the continuities and the ruptures brought by the twentieth century.* While the word exile has unmistakably negative connotations in the English language, its Hebrew equivalent, galut-or in the Ashkenazic and Yiddish pro- nunciations, golus-is even bleaker, evoking associations with a dismal reality all but devoid of redeeming characteristics. There is a geographical component: Jews forcibly displaced from their ancestral homeland, scattered, dispersed, wandering, homeless, unable to find rest. In addition, the word suggests subjugation and op- pression at the hands of the Gentile nations; as a classic study formulates it, "per- secution, outrage, and injustice from which specious privileges give no relief."' There is a psychological element as well. Galut suggests feelings of shame, hu- miliation, and suppressed anger before the taunting of enemies and rivals, so poignantly expressed in the mocking challenge of the Babylonian conquerors: * The authors would like to express their gratitude to the William T. Kemper Foundation for sponsoring the Faculty Award program at Washington University in St. Louis that supported the de- velopment of this course. 1. Yitzhak Baer, Galut (New York: Schocken, 1948), p. 10. Cf. Arnold Eisen, Galut: Modern Jewish Reflections on Homelessness and Homecoming (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1986), p. 99, characterizing Yehezkel Kaufman's monumental Golah ve-Nekhar: galut is "a set of interrelated processes that includes hurban (destruction of the Temple and, by extension, of the Jewish communi- ty), subjugation, wandering, confinement to ghettos, and (the most recent development) assimilation." 301</page><page sequence="2">Marc Saperstein and Nancy E. Berg "Sing us one of the songs of Zion" (Ps. 137:8); feelings of guilt because of the sin- fulness that, in accordance with the terms of the covenant brutally enunciated in such passages as Leviticus 26 and Deuteronomy 28, initiated the exile and pro- longed it. And there is a theological dimension; as one celebrated Jewish preach- er put it, "the essence of our exile, that which pains our souls, is the departure of the holy spirit from among us, leaving us unable to sense the presence of our Cre- ator; that is the ultimate anguish and burden of exile."2 This negative ambience of galut in traditional Jewish literature has been highlighted and accentuated by in- fluential Zionist writers, who used it as a foil to delineate all that they rebelled against, the antithesis of their goals and aspirations.3 While there is little question about the authenticity of such associations, the actual treatment of exile in Jewish literary texts reveals aspects more nuanced and multivalent. The familiar geography of the traditional concept-exile as forced re- moval from the land of Israel, and the end of exile as return to that land-is occa- sionally subverted in unexpected ways. Perhaps even more surprising is a reval- orization of the concept, in which living in the ancestral homeland is no longer automatically identified as good, and living outside the land as bad. The three pre- modern and three modern passages that follow illustrate some of the stunning and perhaps surprising permutations of this central concept. 2. Jonathan Eybeschuetz, Ya 'arot Devash (Jerusalem: Lewin-Epstein, 1968), 2: 74a. This is not to deny that rabbinic literature contains statements recognizing the potential advantages of demo- graphic dispersion among the nations, whether for security reasons (e.g. Genesis Rabbah 76,3 on Gen. 32:9) or to attract proselytes from among the nations (e.g., b. Pes. 87b on Hos. 2:25), or that medieval Jews used such statements to develop theories of exile as providing opportunities for atonement or even special mission. See Shalom Rosenberg, "Exile and Redemption in Jewish Thought in the Sixteenth Century: Contending Conceptions," in Jewish Thought in the Sixteenth Century, ed. Bernard Dov Coop- erman (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1983), pp. 399-430. Nevertheless, such statements seem anomalous and marginal in rabbinic literature, as they are far outweighed by material such as that presented in Bialik and Ravnitzky's Sefer ha-Aggadah (Hayim Naman Bialik and Yehoshua Hana Ravnitzky, The Book of Legends [New York: Schocken, 1992], pp. 377-86). Note the conclusion of Isaiah Gafni, after reviewing all the rabbinic sources: "However, despite the statements we have cited, and especially the tradition in Pesahim 87b attributed to R. Eliezer, it does not seem that the idea of mission to the Gentiles acquired primary standing in the totality of what the sages said about the rea- sons for the dispersion."

E.g. A. B. Yehoshua's characterization of galut as "a national disaster, a temporary situation, a fall, and the root of all evil."

For examples of other Zionist writers on exile, see Joseph Brenner, "Self-Criticism," in The Zionist Idea, ed. Arthur Hertzberg (New York, Atheneum, 1975), pp. 307-12, esp. p. 310; Jacob Klatzkin, "Bound- aries," in Hertzberg, pp. 316-27, esp. pp. 322-23; and the position taken by the character Yudka in Haim Hazaz's "The Sermon," in Modern Hebrew Literature, ed. Robert Alter (New York: Behrman House, 1975), pp. 271-87, esp. pp. 279-82. It has been noted that some extreme Zionist character- izations of Jewish life in the Diaspora have much in common with the literature of late-nineteenth- century and twentieth-century antisemites. This case was made in 1934 (in a Zionist context) by Ye- hezkel Kaufman, "The Ruin of the Soul," reprinted in Zionism Reconsidered: The Rejection of Jewish Normalcy, ed. Michael Seizer (New York: Macmillan, 1970), pp. 117-29, and has been further devel- oped by contemporary scholars. 302</page><page sequence="3">"Arab Chains" and "The Good Things of Sepharad" 1. The first text is one of the most famous poetic creations of Judah Halevi: My heart is in the East, and I at the edge of the West- How can I taste what I eat? How can I enjoy it? How can I fulfill my vows and my bonds, while yet Zion is in Edom's domain, and I in Arab chains? It would be easy for me to leave behind all the good things of Spain, as It would be precious for me to behold the dust of the desolate Shrine.4 The six lines of the poem (actually three long lines, each composed of two hemistiches) can be divided into two sections. The first, containing the first four lines, is constructed in a syntactic chiasmus. Lines 1 and 4 both express situations of contrast, disjunction, distance: East versus West is paralleled in line 4 by Edom (the realm of Christendom) versus the Arab (the world of Islam). The poet's "heart" versus "I"--his physical body-is paralleled in line 4 by "Zion" versus "I." Lines 2 and 3 express the poet's reaction to this situation in the form of three rhetorical questions, each beginning with a form of the Hebrew word "how?" The first two, eikh, evoke an analogous rhetorical question in response to the Babylonian cap- tors' mockery: "How can we sing the Lord's song in a foreign land?" (Ps. 137:4). The third, eikhah, resonates with the opening word of the Book of Lamentations, the paradigmatic response to the catastrophe of Jerusalem conquered. In Halevi's poem, the tension is more internal: between the expectations of normal life-that the taste of good food will be enjoyed, that serious obligations freely undertaken will be fulfilled-and the poet's assertion that these expecta- tions of normalcy are confounded under present circumstances. Like the ques- tion in Psalm 137 just cited, the rhetorical questions are ambiguous. They could refer to an objective condition, meaning, "Even good food tastes bland to me, and I am unable to fulfill my vows." Or they could reflect the poet's inner con- flict, meaning, "The food actually does taste good, but I should not be enjoying it; I should not be fulfilling my normal obligations, although I do." Both read- ings of the first line contradict the wine poems that were a common genre in the writing of the poet's colleagues, and of Halevi himself, poems that celebrate the pleasures of good food and drink. The second reading, which may well produce 4. The translation is based on Selected Poems ofJehudah Halevi, trans. Nina Salaman (Philadel- phia, 1928), p. 2, and The Penguin Book ofHebrew Verse, ed. and trans. by T. Carmi (Philadelphia, 1981), p. 347, with modifications; Carmi's "domain" in line 4 expresses the ambiguity of the Hebrew ?"n, which means both "territory" and "rope" (an ambiguity pointed out to us by Nehama Aschkenasy). Note the much freer translation in David Aberbach, Revolutionary Hebrew, Empire and Crisis (New York: NYU Press, 1998), p. 111, which loses some of the nuances of the Hebrew, especially in the last two lines: "I'd lightly leave the good of Spain/ to see the Temple's dust again." The first line of the poem is one of the best known in Hebrew poetry to Israelis; note the ironic misappropriation of this line in a modern Israeli drama, when a survivor of the Holocaust eking out his existence in the newly established Jewish State misquotes, " 'I sleep in the East. My heart is in the West.' Rabbi Judah Halevi, if I'm not mistaken... " (Ben-Zion Tomer, "Children of the Shadows," in Israeli Holocaust Drama [Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 1996], p. 175). 303</page><page sequence="4">Marc Saperstein and Nancy E. Berg a stronger poem, echoes the conclusion of an early wine poem by Dunash ibn Labrat: "Even as you rejoice, jackals run wild in Zion; Then how can we drink wine?"5 The third question is more serious. "Vows and bonds," a Biblical phrase (Num. 30:5,6), possibly intended to evoke the beginning of the Yom Kippur for- mula Kol Nidre ("All vows and bonds ... "), conveys both religious obligations to God and the contractual obligations of economic exchange. The implication is that in exile, all normal life is insipid, paralyzed, or hypocritical.6 The assertion in line four of the poem requires consideration of historical context. "Zion is in Edom's domain," the standard medieval Jewish code name for Christendom, applies to the period following 1099 (and ending in 1187, though Halevi died in 1141), when the Crusaders controlled Jerusalem. "I in Arab chains," together with "I at the edge of the West," show that the poet is writing in Muslim Spain. It is significant that Halevi used this phrase to describe his situation before the Almohad invasion of the 1 140s devastated the Jewish communities of Andalu- sia. This poem was written during a period of relative tolerance, in which Jewish communities flourished and culture thrived under Islamic auspices. While this was by no means an idyllic environment,7 Halevi's own success in so many realms professionally (as a physician), economically, and culturally: as poet, theologian, and teacher-underlies what must have been a surprise for his readers in the for- mulation, "I in Arab chains." This surprise is heightened by the very next line with its evocation of "all the good things of Spain," suggesting a characterization of Andalusian Jewish life in strong tension with "Arab chains." That tension is never fully resolved. The sec- ond unit of the poem, comprising the final two lines, seems more like a wistful fantasy than a resolute plan. We note again the parallelism at the beginning of the two hemistiches, linked by the conjunction kemo and reinforced by the assonance of the Hebrew verbs yeqal and yeqar, setting up a comparison that is not repro- 5. See, for example, Halevi's wine poem in Hayim Schirmann, Ha-Shirah ha-Ivrit be-Sefarad u-vi-Provans (Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik, 1961), 1:433: "from its mouth [of the bottle] I taste the good- ness of its fine fruits": 'nni~n' ~10u nrvuxK lnal. For Dunash ibn Labrat's "The Poet Refuses an Invita- tion to Drink," see Carmi, p. 280. (There appears to be a lot more ambivalence in that poem toward the pleasures of life in exile than the final lines would indicate.) This is not to suggest that Halevi is re- jecting in this line the Arab style of poetic writing in general, a theme to which we will return. 6. Schirmann (1:489), followed by Carmi (p. 347) explains this as "the vow he made to emi- grate to the land of Israel," but this seems implausible for several reasons. First, the phrase, with both nouns in the plural, is more likely to refer to many obligations than to a single vow. Second, the paral- lelism between lines 2 and 3 suggests that line 3 also applies to life in Spain, not to the possibility of leaving Spain. Finally, "Arab chains" could not have prevented him from leaving Spain, for Jewish mer- chants traveled on the Mediterranean all the time. As for Crusader control over the Holy Land, why would he have made such a vow if the Crusader conquest had already made it impossible for him to fulfill it? 7. S. D. Goitein, A Mediterranean Society, vol. 5: The Individual (Berkeley: University of Cal- ifornia Press, 1988), p. 450: "It was a time of extreme urgency. Constant and gruesome warfare was going on in Spain. ... The feelings of impotence in the absence of any signs of relief were dangerous forebodings of despair and loss of faith." Goitein illustrates the success and pre-eminent reputation of Halevi on pp. 448 and 467; cf. Ross Brann, The Compunctious Poet (Baltimore and London: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1991), p. 85. 304</page><page sequence="5">"Arab Chains" and "The Good Things of Sepharad" duced in the common translations. "It would be easy" just as "it would be pre- cious." But the endings of the lines bring the reader back to the contrasts estab- lished in lines 1 and 4: "all the good things of Spain," versus "the dust of the des- olate Shrine." The power of the statement lies in the reversal of expectation: "all the good things of Spain" have little value for the poet, "dust" and "desolation" are somehow precious.8 How does this poem relate to the conception of exile as an unmitigated dis- aster, as uncompromisingly bleak? And what are we to make of the poet's person- al stance with regard to the continuation of his life in exile? This cannot unam- biguously be determined from the poem itself; additional information is necessary. If "I in Arab chains" means that the poet was actually writing from prison,9 and if "Zion in Edom's domain" suggests that the Christian Crusaders prohibited Jews from setting foot in the Holy Land, the poem would be a lament for the constraints that made it impossible for him to undertake the journey to Jerusalem. But while this reading cannot be excluded on strictly internal grounds, abundant external data confirm that neither Halevi personally, nor Jews in general, were physically or legally prevented from leaving Spain to journey eastward. This suggests a reading closer to what A. B. Yehoshua characterized as a "neurotic" choice'0: the poet yearns for Jerusalem, theoretically rejects life in galut, yet remains where he is, perhaps despising himself for continuing to enjoy the "good things" that he claims it would be so easy to abandon. Read in this way, the poem contains no obvious manifesto for personal aliyah, and certainly not for a mass movement; to the contrary, it ap- pears like an anguished description of resignation to a conflicted status quo. Yet we know that Halevi did indeed leave Spain with the intent of reaching Jerusalem. Should the poem be interpreted in the context of the poet's actual decision to seek out the "desolate shrine" in the East? Such a reading may take the poem to ex- press both a yearning for home and a forceful repudiation of an accommodation to galut, even when conditions are relatively benign. The poet lived in a period of cul- tural flourishing in Muslim Spain, in which he, personally, reached a pinnacle of suc- cess, yet he rejected it all, refusing in this poem to recognize anything of value in his Andalusian environment. Accordingly, life in exile is indeed a disaster, the Jew in the Gentile environment is an outsider, an alien, incapable of finding fulfillment on the most significant level. And at least one Jew was able to draw the consequences and act accordingly, revealing what was possible if only other Jews had chosen similarly.'1 8. Compare Moses ibn Ezra in Schirmann, 1:380: "O lend him thy wings, That he may fly unto his loved ones and rejoice in the dust of their land," referring not to the Holy Land but to Andalusia. 9. As, for example, was Menaem ibn Saruk: Schirmann, 1:8-30. 10. See the essay cited above in n. 3, and compare the statement of Otto Weininger in Joshua Sobol's play discussed below. 11. Thus Halevi becomes a kind of proto-Zionist, whose activist decision to abandon the Dias- pora has messianic significance and pre-figures the aliyah of Zionists in the late-nineteenth century. See Benzion Dinur, " 'Aliyato shel Rabbi Yehudah ha-Levi le-Eres Yisra'el ve-ha-Tesisah he-Meshihit bi-Yamav," in Be-Ma'avaq Dorot (Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik, 1975), pp. 202-31; Franz Rosenzweig, commenting on this poem, wrote that "the lonely yearning of Halevi's soul is the first beacon of the new movement, a movement that carries into the present day" (Ninety-Two Poems and Hymns of Yehu- da Halevi [Albany: SUNY Press, 2000], p. 235). This view tends to overlook the strong quietistic atti- 305</page><page sequence="6">Marc Saperstein and Nancy E. Berg This paradigmatic rejection of galut is not so simple, however. First, it is im- portant to note that the poet concedes there are indeed "good things" in exile. Food generally does taste good, even in Muslim Spain; "vows and bonds" are made all the time, and most Jews do (and indeed should) fulfill them. The presentation of galut in this poem is not totally bleak. Furthermore, if we incorporate Halevi's lat- er decision into our reading of the poem, we must include also the poems written while aboard ship on his journey eastward. These poems give the lie to the rhetor- ical claim, "It would be easy . . " and suggest that its syntax may hint at ambiva- lence and uncertainty. Some of the sea poems echo, in greater detail, the willing- ness or even eagerness to abandon good foods, possessions, and wealth.12 But others express a deep sense of loss: for home, family, friends, disciples, an ordered religious life with synagogue and academy that was not only comfortable but rather attractive.13 What is being abandoned in these poems does not seem at all to be a description of "exile" as commonly understood. Indeed, in a climactic passage of the Kuzari, Halevi uses the term "exile" to characterize the decision to leave be- hind a comfortable life in the Diaspora and to brave the dangers of a journey to the Holy Land.14 Leaving Spain for Jerusalem is a self-imposed exile, a pilgrimage of suffering sacrifice with atoning power-an idea more commonly associated with Christian thought than with Jewish discourse (although Halevi was not unique in this regard).'5 One might argue that this decision could be considered at least as "neurotic" as the decision to remain. There is one other element of Halevi's ambivalence. While his poem is writ- ten in the Hebrew language, like the other Andalusian Jewish poets of his own and tude toward messianism-that bearing exile and degradation with patience and humility is the key to redemption-evidenced in much of Halevi's writings; as expressed by Yitzhak Baer: "to suffer humbly and be patient is the mission of the Jews in the Galut" (Galut, p. 31). For this theme in Halevi's works, see Kuzari, V, 115 (trans. Hartwig Hirschfeld [New York: Schocken, 1964], p. 79); Schirmann, 1:467. 12. E.g. Schirmann, 1:503, lines 9-10. Cf. Sidra DeKoven Ezrahi, Booking Passage: Exile and Homecoming in the Modern Jewish Imagination (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999), p. 41, on the ambivalence of such passages in Halevi's poetry. 13. E.g., Schirmann, 1:501, lines 2-9: the proclamations "I will not weep over ... , I will not remember... , I will almost forget ... " are clearly protesting too much; cf. also 503 lines 11-12, and Goitein, 5: 467: "[in Spain] he found rest in the houses of study and prayer, enjoyed his Sabbaths, fes- tive holidays, and glorious Passovers; he loved his family; cultivated an endless circle of worthy friends; and, last but not least, was successfully within his medical profession and, consequently, enjoyed a sat- isfactory economic situation". 14. Kuzari V, 23 (trans. Hirschfeld, p. 293): "He is supported by the saying of the Sages, 'Exile atones for sins' (b. Makkot 2b), especially if his exile brings him into the place of God's choice." 15. Joshua Prawer, The History of the Jews in the Latin Kingdom ofJerusalem (Oxford: Claren- don Press, 1988), pp. 145-46, notes the anomalous use of "exile" and suggests parallels with the Chris- tian doctrine of atoning pilgrimage as articulated by Bernard of Clairvaux. Elhanan Reiner has shown that many subsequent Jewish "pilgrims" to the Land of Israel thought of their dangerous journey as having atoning power: cf. Haviva Pedaya, "Eres shel Ruah ve-Eres Mamash: R. Ezra, R. Azriel ve-ha- Ramban," in Eres Yisra 'el ba-Hagut ha- Yehudit bi- Ymei ha-Beinayim, ed. Moshe Hallamish and Aviez- er Ravitzky [ Jerusalem: Yad Ben-Zvi, 1991 ], p. 246. Other contemporaries of Halevi, including Moses ibn Ezra, Abraham ibn Daud, and Moses Maimonides, also used the word galut to refer to the forced abandonment of Muslim Spain. But the use of this word for a journey from Spain to the Land of Israel is quite an extraordinary reversal. 306</page><page sequence="7">"Arab Chains" and "The Good Things of Sepharad" previous generations, he followed an Arabic rhyme scheme and an Arabic metri- cal system. Not only this, but the very content of the poem appears to be influenced by the Arabic poetry of nostalgia and longing for a distant place. In some of these poems, the site of fond memories--often a campsite-is now abandoned and in ruins; in others it is beautiful yet unattainable. A striking application of this topos to a personal situation in Muslim Spain was written by Abd ar-Rahman I, survivor of the Umayyad dynasty, who established himself in Andalusia after the Abbasid seizure of power in the East: A palm tree I beheld in Ar-Rusafa, Far in the West, far from the palm-tree land: I said: "You, like myself, are far away, in a strange land; How long have I been far away from my people! You grew up in a land where you are a stranger, And like myself, are living in the farthest corner of the earth.16 Indeed, the sense of exile and alienation is considerably stronger in this than it is in Halevi's poem, for the Arab refugee ruler recognizes no "good things" in Spain, and does not have the option of returning to the East. In short, Halevi's poetic re- pudiation of the "Golden Age" is formulated in ways that reflect the Arabic ambi- ence he claims he would readily abandon. Perhaps this, rather than any legal sub- servience or oppression, is the meaning of the "Arab chains" he bemoans. But as he continued to write this style of poetry even on hisjourney, it is not clear he would have maintained that he had left all of the "Arab chains" behind."7 Halevi's poem shows no way to leave the exile at present. At best, he might substitute one form for another. The second passage to be considered comes from a text that has been the subject of considerable scholarly investigation in recent years: Nahmanides' ac- count of his "Disputation at Barcelona" with the apostate Paul Christian. 16. A. R. Nykl, Hispano-Arabic Poetry (Baltimore: J. H. Furst Co, 1946), p. 18; on Ar-Rusafa, cf. Jaroslav Stetkevych, The Zephyrs of Najd: The Poetics of Nostalgia in the Classical Arabic Nasib (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993) p. 109, pp. 269-70, n. 13, and compare also pp. 117, 189. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, this geography of nostalgia is reversed, with Middle Eastern Arab poets writing longingly about Andalusia: see Reuven Snir, " 'Al-Andalus Arising from Damascus': Al-Andalus in Modern Arabic Poetry," in Stacy N. Beckwith, ed., Charting Memory: Re- calling Medieval Spain (New York: Garland, 1999), pp. 263-93. 17. See Brann, pp. 88-92 for a discussion, and rejection, of the view that Halevi repudiated Arabic style Hebrew poetry late in his life. As Brann argues, Halevi seems to have maintained a com- plex and ambivalent attitude toward this kind of poetry to the end (p. 96). The statement of Aberbach (above, n. 3) that in this poem Halevi "breaks out of the shackles of Arabic ornamentation" (p. 111) does not seem persuasive. (After this article had been accepted for publication, Ross Brann sent us two other offprints in which he treats motifs from Arabic poetry used and transformed by Halevi in this poem: see Brann, "The Arabized Jews," in The Literature ofAl-Andalus, ed. Maria Rosa Menocal et al. [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000], pp. 273-76; idem, " 'How Can My Heart Be In the East?'

The essence of our judgment, truth, and justice does not depend upon the Messiah. You are worth more to me than the Messiah. You are king, and he is king. You are a gentile king, and he is a Jewish king, for the Messiah is but a king of flesh and blood like you. When I worship my Creator in your dominion, exiled, suffering, and under subjugation, the shame of the nations (Ezek. 36:15), who taunt me always, my reward is abundant, for I bring a whole offering to God from my physical be- ing. Because of that, I shall increasingly merit life in the World to Come. How- ever, when a king of Israel, of my own faith, will rule over all the nations, and I have no choice but to abide the law of the Jews, my reward will not be as abundant."18 In this passage, Nahmanides sets out to diminish the significance of the mes- sianic belief for Judaism. Even if we were to be convinced that the current exile will continue forever, he maintains, even if there should never be a Messiah, nev- er an ingathering of the exiles, never a rebuilding of the Temple or a restoration of the Davidic line of kings, the essence of Judaism would not be affected, its foun- dation would not be undermined. The contrast with Christianity is not explicit, but it is clearly implied: Christianity cannot stand without its doctrine of the Messiah, Judaism can. This position is expressed through what appears to be a shocking hyperbole. James I, the king of Aragon, is worth more to this rabbi than the Messiah. So un- expected is this formulation that the reader instinctively tends to turn to various hermeneutic options. Is this the fawning of the insecure courtier? Is Nahmanides expressing himself with irony? Is it a conventional flattery not intended to be tak- en by Jews with full seriousness? Is it the discourse of the oppressed, compelled to speak in a way that does not reflect what he truly believes? This last option seems plausible in the context of the entire account. Our pas- sage comes on the second day of the public Disputation. On the first day, Nah- manides was exposed to the new style of Christian argumentation rooted in rab- binic literature. The first question to be disputed was "Whether the Messiah had already come." In support of this proposition, Friar Paul had cited rabbinic texts affirming that the Messiah was born on the day the Temple was destroyed. Nah.- manides first replied that he did not believe in that statement, then that it must have an esoteric meaning, but this opened him to the charge that he rejects the authori- ty of the Talmudic sages-a precarious position for a medieval Jewish leader to defend. Finally, he resorts to a technicality: even if the Messiah was born in the year 70, that does not prove that he has come, namely, begun his public career. To 18.

For our pur- poses, the complex questions of the relationship of Nahmanides' text to the Latin account of the Dis- putation, and to what he actually said before the king in Barcelona, are not relevant, as our concern is with the conception of exile in the literary report. On these issues, which have been studied extensive- ly for more than a century, see, most recently, the discussion of the literary character of Nahmanides' account in Chazan, pp. 39-79, and pp. 100-41. 308</page><page sequence="9">"Arab Chains" and "The Good Things of Sepharad" this the king makes the obvious reply that this Messiah would now have to be well over 1000 years old. Despite Nahmanides' effort to put the best possible spin on his performance in the text intended for Jewish readers, one has the impression that he was in a dif- ficult position by the end of the first day.19 He must have given extensive thought that night to various strategies for the resumption of the debate, for at the begin- ning of the second day, he makes two dramatically new points. First, unlike the le- gal component of rabbinic literature, the aggadic component is not authoritative and binding upon Jews; it is rather analogous to the sermons delivered by a bish- op. And second, even if the Messiah had come and gone, and the exile should con- tinue forever without any hope for a Messiah in the future, the Jewish religion would not be substantively affected. Whether indeed this marginalization of the messianic age was merely a tac- tical ploy or reflects what Nabmanides really believed continues to be debated.20 Yet, setting Nahmanides' sincerity aside, the plausibility and internal coherence of the position does not seem open to doubt. That the Messiah was to be a human be- ing, and therefore in the same category as Gentile kings was the normative Jewish position throughout the ages. That Judaism does not depend upon the messianic belief is more controversial, for well-known Jewish thinkers, including Mai- monides, made it a fundamental principle of Jewish faith. Yet, Nahmanides reiter- ated this in another, non-polemical context, and other Jewish thinkers also main- tained a similar position.21 What enabled Nahmanides and the others to make this surprising claim? The argument can be broken down into several unspoken components, coming from various sources, yet together leading to the conclusion. First, the essence of Ju- daism is not living in the messianic age, but observing the commandments of the Torah.22 Second, the value of observing the commandments is directly propor- 19. The difficulty of Nahmanides' position at this point is emphasized by Martin Cohen, "Re- flections on the Text and Context of the Disputation of Barcelona," HUCA 35 (1964): 172. 20. One obvious problem is that Nahmanides claims to have insisted at the very outset that the disputation be focused not on peripheral issues of Jewish practice but on "matters upon which religion as a whole depended," and therefore they "agreed to discuss first of all the subject of the Messiah." His position on the second day seems to reverse this earlier statement. Yitzhak Baer thus maintains that this position was taken "against his own convictions": A History of the Jews in Christian Europe, 2 vols. (Philadelphia, 1961-1966), 1:153. Cf. Chazan, Barcelona and Beyond, pp. 65, 128, where this incon- sistency is noted without drawing a direct conclusion about Nahmanides' sincerity. 21. Nahmanides, Sefer ha-Ge'ulah, in Kitvei Ramban, ed. Chavel, 1:279; cited by Baer, A His- tory of the Jews in Christian Europe 1:248. Solomon Schechter took this parallel in a context "where there was no occasion to be over polite to the Government" as evidence that it reflects Nahmanides' genuine view: Studies in Judaism (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1896), p. 106.

For the tension (or contradiction) between this principle and the position, taken by Nahmanides in his Torah commentary, that even those commandments applicable outside the land of Israel cannot be fully observed in exile, see Marc Saperstein, "The Land of Israel in Pre-Modern Jew- ish Thought," in Lawrence Hoffman, ed., The Land ofl Israel: Jewish Perspectives (Notre Dame: Notre Dame University Press, 1986), pp. 200-201 and 207-208 n. 35. 309</page><page sequence="10">Marc Saperstein and Nancy E. Berg tionate to the difficulty of the observance; this view, with roots in the rabbinic lit- erature ("the reward is proportional to the pain," Avot 5:22), reiterated by Mai- monides in his "Epistle on Apostasy," is commonly associated with the doctrine of medieval German Pietism (H.asidut Ashkenaz).23 Third, the conditions of life in exile make the observance of the commandments extremely difficult for Jews: there are powerful pressures to abandon the faith, and those who cling to it are sub- jected to taunting and humiliation from their Christian neighbors.24 Fourth, while some of the most important commandments cannot be observed at present- especially the offering of sacrifices in the Temple-this lack is more than com- pensated when Jews offer themselves as a sacrifice to God through their willing- ness to remain Jews, rather than following the easier path of conversion.25 Final- ly, the essential reward, the desired end of all life is immortality of the soul in the World to Come. The messianic age, physical rather than spiritual, in time rather than eternity, is far less important than this. Putting all these assumptions together, Nah.manides' conclusion makes in- ternal sense. Maimonides had earlier argued that the Messianic Age is a means to the ultimate goal of a purely spiritual reward in the World to Come, in that it will make it easier for the masses of Jews to devote themselves to "the Law and its wis- dom," namely the attainment of philosophical enlightenment.26 Nahmanides ac- 23.

On German Pietism and its doctrine of reward proportionate to the difficulty (or the apparently senseless- ness) of the commandment, the pressures to transgress it, and the humiliation endured for its perfor- mance (at the hands not only of Christians but of other Jews), see Yitzhak Baer, "He-Megamah ha-Datit ha-Hevratit shel 'Sefer Hasidim,' Zion 3 (1937): 9; Joseph Dan, Torat ha-Sod shel Hasidut Ashkenaz (Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik, 1968), p. 239; Haym Soloveitchik, "Three Themes in Sefer Hasidim," AJS Review 1 (1976): 336-37; Ivan Marcus, Piety and Society (Leiden: Brill, 1981), p. 32. 24. Cf. Halevi, Kuzari I, 115 (trans. Hirschfeld, p. 79): since each Jew could "become the friend and equal of his oppressor by uttering one word, and without any difficulty" [i.e., through conversion to the majority faith, in Halevi's case Islam], those who bear humiliation and degradation and remain loyal to Judaism earn a rich reward from God. 25. This motif is present in the chronicles and liturgy written in the wake of the Crusade mas- sacres. See, e.g., Alan Mintz, Hurban: Responses to Catastrophe in Hebrew Literature (New York: Co- lumbia University Press, 1984), pp. 94-97, 101; Robert Chazan, European Jewry and the First Cru- sade (Berkeley, University of California Press, 1987), pp. 126-31. With Nahmanides' formulation, compare Ezra of Gerona, cited by Moshe Idel, "The Land of Israel in Medieval Kabbalah," in Hoff- man, The Land of Israel: Jewish Perspectives, p. 177: "Nowadays the Jews are already released from the obligation [to dwell in] the Land of Israel. Their suffering-out of love of God-the [vicissitudes of] the dispersion, and their afflictions and subjugation are like an atoning altar for them, as it is writ- ten, For Thy sake are we killed all day long (Ps. 44:23). (See the discussion of this passage by Haviva Pedaya, "Eres shel Ruah ve-Eres Mamash," pp. 243-49, leading to the "paradoxical conclusion that it is obligatory to live in exile [at present]," p. 248.)

But, resorting to the Pietistic notion that the more difficult the challenge- the greater the temptation to opt out-the greater the reward will be, he draws the opposite conclusion: because the Messianic Age will make observing the com- mandments easier, it is precisely the current life in exile that is more conducive to achieving the reward in World to Come.27 Even more than Halevi, Nahmanides presents galut as an arena of suffering. Jews in exile, mocked and scorned by their neighbors, are subjected to fearsome pressures to abandon a distinctive religious identity and accept the ways of the ma- jority. At best they can rely on a sympathetic king who guarantees their physical safety and the possibility of observing their traditions. Yet even under such rela- tively benign conditions, this possibility of remaining a Jew in galut entails a strug- gle. Loyalty to Jewish demands and worship of the Creator through performance of the commandments require a sacrificial effort, tantamount to a form of ongo- ing martyrdom. To be a Jew in exile is to transform one's own body into a sacri- fice to God. Nevertheless, this negative depiction of life in exile, though apparently sim- ilar in some ways to Halevi's "Arab chains," functions differently for Nahmanides because the contrast drawn by each is different. Halevi contrasts exile in the far West to the site of the Temple Mount at present-desolate, controlled by the forces of Christendom, empty of Jews. Yet this depressing alternative is Halevi's goal. It can be achieved only through a total repudiation of the present geographical exile for a different form of exile in the Holy Land, superficially far more dismal, yet to the poet more desirable. Nahmanides sets up a triad. Exile, with all its present bleakness, is contrasted with a future return to Jewish sovereignty under the mes- sianic king. But the expected valence of this dichotomy-galut bad, messianic age good-is subverted through the introduction of a third element: life in the World to Come, which is understood to be more important than the messianic age. This ultimate goal is achieved not through sacrificing the "good things" in the current arena of galut, but by sacrificial loyalty despite the adverse pressures of galut, for this is what enables the Jew to reach the ultimate reward. While Hale- vi's poem articulates a negation of the exile despite its "good things," Nahmanides' statement suggests a surprising affirmation of the exile, for its very difficulties and challenges make it instrumental for a higher purpose. Exile, with all its pain and oppression, is therefore the key to spiritual immortality, and-paradoxically-life under a messianic king who will compel all Jews to observe the commandments may be more perilous for the future of the soul in eternity. The third text is from a homiletical composition by the early Hasidic mas- er (New York: Behrman House, 1972), p. 225. Cf. his formulation in the introduction to "Heleq" of the Mishnah Commentary, ibid., pp. 415-16. 27. Compare the later formulation by the eighteenth-century Hasidic writer Jacob Joseph of Polonne: "What the experts in ethics have written is well known: that the reward for one who serves God truly and devotedly in the time of exile is many times greater than [the reward for] one who served God in the earlier period." Mendel Piekarz, Hasidut Polin (Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik, 1990), p. 219 n. 28; cf. also the formulation of later Hasidic masters cited on pp. 214-15 and on pp. 225-26). 311</page><page sequence="12">Marc Saperstein and Nancy E. Berg ter, the Maggid of Mezhirech. It begins with the apparently simple statement from Avot 1:7, i lwn7 p3irn, usually translated "draw away from an evil neighbor": v-i pwIn n pnirm. This means that it is easier to achieve the Holy Spirit in our time, a time of exile, than it was in the days when the Temple was still stand- ing. To understand this, consider how difficult it would be to approach a king in his royal palace, as compared to when he is traveling through the country- side. While he is on the road or at an inn, anyone can approach him, even a simple farm lad who would never be permitted to enter the palace. In the same way, God will immediately inspire and dwell within someone who thinks about communion with God now, in our time of exile. For this reason, it is im- portant to remove ourselves from evil desires and evil thoughts, so that God will not be separated from us. Rather, whatever we do should be for the sake of God's name. Thus l prnn: remove from the neighbor, namely from the one who dwells by you, pw~n p;nin, remove the evil.28 The passage is framed by a striking piece of homiletical exegesis. In typical Hasidic style, the preacher takes a simple, familiar phrase from the classical liter- ature and gives it a twist that is novel yet firmly rooted in the language of the text, for "draw away from an evil neighbor" should have used not the hiph 'il, pni1n, but the hitpa 'el, pnrinrn.29 The homilist therefore breaks down the traditional syntax of the three words and reconstructs it anew. There is no "evil neighbor." The Iw is the indwelling presence of God (n;rw). "Evil" becomes the direct object of the transitive verb "remove," meaning "set at a distance." Though "evil" is di- rectly juxtaposed to "neighbor" in the sentence, the goal is to set distance be- tween them. Evil thoughts must be set at a distance, lest they cause God to be separated from us. If this new insight into the familiar words from Avot comes at the end of the paragraph, the reader (or listener) is confronted with a stunning and challenging novelty at the very beginning: "It is easier to achieve the Holy Spirit in our time, a time of exile, than it was in the days when the Temple was still standing." Such an assertion would appear to violate much of what Jews "know" about galut, as expressed in so many statements indicating that God is more accessible in the Holy Land, in the Holy City, in the Temple, than in the "lands of idolatry." One tradition was that with the destruction of the Temple, the divine presence withdrew entire- ly from the earth, that even God's providential protection terminated completely with the exile, leaving the Jewish people to the fate determined by the stars, the 28.

Cf. Martin Buber, Tales ofthe Hasidim, 2 vols. (NewYork, Schocken, 1964), 1:103, who introduces the element of the king's being "driven from his realm" without any basis in sources I could find. 29. This problem is not addressed by most of the commentators, who apparently assume the meaning is [prv nx] pn1n,. Judah Lerma, noting the use of hiph 'il rather than hitpa 'el, suggested that the meaning is that one should warn a newcomer about an evil neighbor and thereby remove him from the neighbor's influence (cited in Samuel de Uceda, Midrash Shemu'el [B'nei B'raq, 1992], p. 33). 312</page><page sequence="13">"Arab Chains" and "The Good Things of Sepharad" brutalities of cynical politics and military might, or chance.30 A powerful expres- sion of this, written not long after the Maggid's homily, represents the more com- mon, pessimistic view of distance and inaccessibility: During the time of the temple, no man dwelled in permanent sin, for the sac- rificial offerings would atone ... and nothing stood in the way and prevented our prayers from rising to our Father in heaven. Today, however, that is not the case. For due to the multitude of our sins ... there is an iron wall that sepa- rates us [from God] and stops [our prayers]. And there is no direct route for the ascent of our prayers ... and our worship is like a barren woman, for it does not give birth and it yields no fruit, for the gates of prayer have been locked.31 The more comforting affirmation was that the divine presence went into exile with the Jewish people.32 Or, in the words of the Khazar king in the Kuzari, "one can draw near to God in any place with a pure heart and strong desire"33-a position close to that in our text. But even this does not maintain that God is more accessi- ble in exile than in the ancient Temple of Jerusalem. That appears to be a revolu- tionary claim,34 and it is substantiated not by a complex conceptual or exegetical argument, but by recourse to a simple analogy. 30.

The most extreme expression of this is that "even when he prays to God, God does not hear his prayer, as he is under [the jurisdiction of] princes and constellations." 31.

The images of the intervening "wall of iron" and the locking of the gates of prayer come from the Talmud (b. Ber. 32b), but the expression of the barrenness of Jewish worship in exile goes beyond the familiar sources. 32. B. Meg 29a and parallels; cf.

Berg As in so many traditional Jewish analogies or parables, this one involves a king, who clearly represents God. Usually, it is a member of the king's family who goes out from the palace into a foreign realm: the wife, or the son, representing the Jewish people. Sometimes a messenger is sent out of the palace by the king. In the Kuzari, Judah Halevi speaks of a man who became so close to the king that he was invited to the king's table and could enter the king's presence whenever he wished. Unlike the other subjects, when this man went on a dangerous journey, far away from the palace, he is fully confident that he will continue to enjoy the king's pro- tection, even at a distance.35 Maimonides' celebrated "parable of the castle" fo- cuses on the efforts of various categories of human beings to find the palace, en- ter its gates, and thereby come into the very presence of the king.36 In all of these analogies, the king remains in his palace; only rarely do we find a king journeying forth.37 This passage, therefore, subverts a literary tradition as well as a theological commonplace. What is particularly striking is that while we might expect the parable and its application to apply exclusively to the tsaddiq, substituting a new axis mundi for the sacred geography of Jerusalem and Temple, it instead applies to the ordinary Jews being addressed.38 Despite reference to the "holy spirit," this is not a validation of the rebbe's unique role, but a call for the Hasidim to take advantage of their spiritual opportunities. Perhaps there was an appeal to actual experience: a Jew in the late-eighteenth century, who would nev- er get through the doors of the imperial palace, might conceivably catch a glimpse of the Czar travelling through the countryside. However, this simply validates the theological insight; it is unlikely that it would generate such a dramatic reversal of traditional assumptions. There must be a deeper rationale. The passage works out the implications of the conception that God dwells within the pure and devoted human being-an idea that is not Biblical or Rabbinic but apparently enters Judaism, probably from Sufis, in the poetry of the Spanish "Golden Age."39 It may also reflect the influence of the popular Lurianic notion of 35.

In the Kuzari, the Jewish spokesman maintains (somewhat more ambiguously than the poem) that in the spiritual giants of the Jewish past, "the Shekhinah found a worthy abode (mahall)" (III, 65, trans.

V, 314</page><page sequence="15">"Arab Chains" and "The Good Things of Sepharad" the nisosot, sparks of the divine essence, scattered throughout the world, and there- fore accessible even to ordinary human beings, a doctrine developed into a full im- manentist theology by the Maggid of Mezhirech.40 Whatever the source of this idea, the implications for the nature of exile are dramatic. What separates the Jew from God is not the nature of galut-detachment from the Holy Land, destruction of the Temple, immersion in a Gentile environment-but the evil desires of the hu- man heart, which can be mastered. If indeed it is easier to encounter God in exile than in the Temple of Jerusalem, exile is not a total catastrophe, devoid of the pos- sibility of any meaningful religious life. It is, rather, an opportunity and a chal- lenge. While both the passage from Nahmanides' "Disputation" and the passage from the Maggid of Mezhirech reflect a much more positive attitude toward the func- tion of exile in the religious life than Halevi's poem, the difference between the two passages should also be clear. Although the Maggid was living in late-eighteenth- century Eastern Europe under conditions generally considered to be harsher than those in Muslim Spain, in the Maggid's homily, there is no suggestion of "Arab chains." Nor is there any hint of a sacrificial offering of the Jew's body, as in Nahmanides. The essential characteristic of exile is access to God, who may Him- self be suffering in exile. Of course, conditions are better in the palace than "on the road or at an inn," but this applies to the king, not to the "simple farm lad"- the ordinary Jew-who would never be allowed into the palace. Homelessness, up- rootedness, powerlessness, all the common characteristics associated with galut are at least temporarily forgotten; the surprising suggestion is that, in spiritual terms, the situation of the Jews has actually improved with the exile in compari- son with the period when the Temple was still standing. The conclusion is similar to that of Nahmanides: that Judaism does not depend upon a messianic age, and that attention should be focused on the present rather than on the future-but for a very different reason. In the statement of this Hasidic rebbe, we find something that might be termed an "affirmation of the exile." Such an attitude would certainly lead one to expect that any messianic tension, any urgency of expectation for rad- ical change on a national level, and any activism to bring about the messiah would be dissipated or neutralized. These three texts suggest an unexpected complexity of "authentic" Jewish attitudes toward exile and Diaspora in the pre-Emancipation era, illustrating how the valences of an apparently straightforward passage can often be uncovered only 23, p. 293); see now, on this passage and its probable Sufi background, Diane Lobel, "A Dwelling Place for the Shekhinah," JQR 90 (1999): 103-25.

Berg through a careful investigation of its literary, historical, and conceptual dimen- sions. As for the material in the modern period-texts produced against the back- ground of the debates over Emancipation, Zionism, and the establishment of the State of Israel-these reveal an array of attitudes toward "exile" even more diverse and provocative. 2. The scope of exile in the modern period shifts from the grand categories of sin, divine retribution, and the potential for spiritual redemption to the secular, per- sonal level. While exile becomes a metaphor for the human condition, it is also a very real experience for individuals uprooted from their homes. For writers, it be- comes a privileged, almost a preferred, condition, part of a literary tradition hark- ing back to Ovid and Dante.41 For Jews, political Zionism redefines exile in na- tionalistic terms. The modern Jewish authors of the three texts discussed below are situated at the intersection of this literary tradition and the Jewish tradition of galut, the intersection of the personal and the political, the individual and the communal. The different places defined as home by these works, and the different lan- guages in which they are written, evoke the diversity of Jewish life in the modern golah. These texts explore the experiences of exile-each intensified by the de- piction of a memorable last night in a familiar environment-more than its mean- ing or valorization. The first text looks at the origins of the modern political solu- tion to Jewish exile: Zionism. In Herzl's Vienna, Zion regains its geographical location. However, as the other two texts reveal, for many Jewish communities, es- pecially those outside of Europe, Zionism is not the antidote to exile; rather, it be- comes a contributing factor to it. Biblical paradigms of exile--banishment from the Garden of Eden, forced wandering, renewed dispersal-regain currency in contemporary forms. Yehoshua Sobol dramatizes the experience of exile in his play Nefesh Yehu- di (Soul of a Jew),42 a fictionalized account of the end of Otto Weininger's life. Flashbacks and dreamlike sequences fill in biographical details, expose relation- ships between the characters, and reveal the psychological and philosophical un- derpinnings of the action and dialogue. Sobol's presentation of exile shows it to be a curse as terrible in its own way as the wild beasts, pestilence, and cannibalism threatened in Leviticus 26. Yet it is not punishment for disobeying God's law, but rather the natural consequence of failure to follow the law of modern nationalism. The drama takes place in fin de si cle Vienna, a milieu of astonishing cul- tural achievements and profound decadence. The text is replete with references to contemporary cultural, intellectual and political giants: Strindberg, Wagner, Mae- terlinck, Hamsut, Kleist, Freud, Fliess, and Herzl. The mayor of Vienna, Karl Lueger, remains offstage but is a player nonetheless. His antisemitism contributes to an atmosphere of hostility toward the Austrian Jews, to a breeding ground for 41.

Through his main character, Sobol presents exile as societal sickness.43 The malaise of the community is given intense expression in both the characterization and the words of Otto Weininger, the individual: Judaism is on an even lower level than femininity. Woman believes in man, the Jew believes in nothing. The Jew is the enemy of form. The Jew is a born an- archist. The Jew elects to live in exile: it is his natural way of life. He felt this way even before the destruction of the Temple. The Jew will prefer this way of life even when he has his own country. (Sobol, p. 76) As a dramatic persona, Otto is a classically exilic figure: a twisted genius. His neu- roticism arises from his belonging to a group that is condemned to exile. His own experiences, the basis for his professional work as a psychologist, tie together the personal and the political by conflating the Jewish, the feminine, and the sick. (The opinions expressed by the character and his theories regarding gender, mental health and Jewishness are taken from Weininger's 1903 treatise Sex and Charac- ter.44) The increasingly hostile environment and growing antisemitism of turn-of- the-century Vienna are internalized by the young Otto, who suffers from the "vic- timage of location."45 Jews are despised, it is implied (consistent with classical Zionist theory), because they do not have a nation to call their own, and because of their acceptance-indeed embrace-of their exile. At the same time, politics make it impossible for them to be "at home" even when they are at home. The other characters represent alternative responses to the worsening atmo- sphere. Otto's father, a Wagner enthusiast, is in some ways more German/Austri- an than many of his non-Jewish co-nationalists. His assimilationism is most fer- vent on the cultural level.46 Otto's friend Clara is a militant Zionist who sees the 43.

Berg creation of a Jewish state, the fulfillment of Herzl's dream, as the only possibility for Jews to live without fear of persecution. Clara is joined in her politics by Berg- er, although he seems to be motivated more by lust than by ideology. Another mem- ber of their group is Tietz, a non-Jew and a self-professed liberal who reacts with disdain to the growing threat of antisemitism. His benevolence is suspect, howev- er: his Jewish friends are exotic to him (especially Clara), and his enthusiasm, sug- gests Otto, is in a way more insidious than the bald antisemitism of Karl Lueger and his followers. Exile here is decadence. The Jew, according to Otto in the passage cited above, consistently chooses exile. This choice is not based on enjoying "the good things of Spain," on earning a spiritual reward in eternity, or on the opportunity for greater access to God. Rather, it is a symptom of a sickness that pervades the com- munity and the individual psyche. Sobol's articulation of Otto's sentiments echoes A. B. Yehoshua's essay cited above, which asserts that "On the eve of the destruc- tion of the Second Temple, one-third of the [Jewish] people was already abroad. They left of their own choice... .47 Both Yehoshua and Sobol's Otto suggest that the Jew has a natural affinity for life in the galut; Yehoshua: "the virus of the go- lah is in our blood," Otto: "exile is his natural habitat."48 Sobol affords his char- acter the prescience to predict that "The Jew will prefer this way of life even when he has his own country," a prediction supported by the very statistics (now dated but still valid) with which Yehoshua opens his article: "The gates are open, the pos- sibilities are many, but the immigrants do not come."49 Sobol both supports and questions this point by focusing on an individual more brilliant and more disturbed than any of his peers. He represents the whole, sick society, but in the end, he re- mains an individual. Otto cannot live in exile, but neither can he leave his exile. His "chains" are psychological. He eventually opts for conversion to Protestantism as a re- sponse to the condition of exile, and shortly after he kills himself. His suicide demonstrates the failure of his strategy; he cannot escape his "Jewish soul," he can neither accept nor abandon his self-image as an exilic Jew. Earlier, he had acknowledged Zionism as "the last remnant of nobility that's still left in Ju- daism." He himself, however, is too deeply affected by the exilic culture of de- generacy to be able to start over in a new land, and he concludes that Zionism 47. Yehoshua, "Exile as a Neurotic Solution" (see above, note 3), p. 18. Earlier in the play, Otto states, "If Jews had any sense of guilt they would have left exile long ago, during the Second Temple when they had a country of their own" (p. 58). Compare also the statement in Halevi's Kuzari II, 24 (trans. Hirshfeld, p. 100): At the end of the Babylonian exile, "Divine Providence was ready to restore everything as it had been at first, if they [the Jews] had all willingly consented to return [to the land of Israel]. But only a part was ready to do so, while the majority and the aristocracy remained in Baby- lon, preferring dependence and slavery, and unwilling to leave their houses and their affairs." 48. Yeshoshua, p. 33; Sobol, p. 58. 49. Sobol, p. 76; Yehoshua, p. 20. Otto's formulation is ambiguous: if it pertains to Jews who remain in the Diaspora after 1948, then it is essentially the same as Yehoshua's complaint, but it could also allude, "prophetically," to Jews born in Israel who choose to live in the Diaspora, or who imitate exilic values even in the Jewish State. 318</page><page sequence="19">"Arab Chains" and "The Good Things of Sepharad" as a movement is doomed to failure.50 His life serves as an anguished affirma- tion of exile. The larger extra-literary context of the play contributes to its message. It is written in a language and country that is (at least in part) the realization of Zion- ism. The title, Nefesh Yehudi, was certainly intended to evoke the words of"Hatik- vah" adopted as the Zionist-and Israeli national-anthem: As long as the soul of the Jew beats inside the heart And (as long as) the eye looks eastward to Zion Our hope is still not lost, The two-thousand-year-old hope: To be a free people in our own land, The land of Zion and Jerusalem. The "Jewish soul" in the title-Otto-stands in stark contrast to the meaning of the phrase in its original context. The character tries to submerge his Jewish soul by becoming a Christian, thereby subverting the sentiment expressed by the lyrics. While the play is clearly critical of the self-hatred espoused by Otto-the deni- gration of the Jewish and the feminine-it also gives voice to these ideas without entirely disavowing them. Galut, dangerous and contagious, may not be dispelled even by the return to the land of Israel. Can Zionism flourish if it is rooted in the debauchery, xenophobia and self-hatred of Weininger's Vienna? The establishment of a Jewish State does not resolve the problem of exile for all Jews, especially once exile is reinterpreted on a personal level of individ- ual experience. Samir Naqqash's novella "Laylat 'Uraba" (The Night ofHoshana Rabbah),5' which frames a story set almost fifty years after Weininger's suicide, calls Sobol's message into question. Zionism is at best a misguided delusion, and the historical "return" to Israel is in fact, a personal passage into exile. "Laylat 'Uraba" is the story of one family's celebration of Sukkot on the eve of their exile from Iraq following the establishment of the state of Israel, bringing to an end a continuous Jewish communal history beginning with the exile to Babylo- nia in 586 BCE. Unlike some of Naqqash's other works that place their stories in an abstract setting,52 this work is vividly realized in large part by the specificity of time and place. The novella begins with the frame narrative: the narrator is addressing an unseen audience in an Israeli coffeehouse recounting his family's Hoshana Rabbah celebration three decades years previously in Iraq (the inner narrative). 50. "I consider Zionism to be the last remnant of nobility that's still left in Judaism" (Sobol, p. 57); "Zionism too will sink in the Jewish abyss like a stone in a swamp" (p. 58). Compare Sex and Character, p. 307: "Zionism must remain an impracticable ideal, notwithstanding the fashion in which it has brought together some of the noblest qualities of the Jews. Zionism is the negation of Judaism, for the conception of Judaism involves a world-wide distribution of the Jews. Citizenship is an un- Jewish thing, and there has never been and never will be a true Jewish State." The above-cited formula- tions about the Jews' preference for "exile," however, are Sobol's addition to what Weininger wrote. 51.

About Hoshana Rabbah that was thirty years ago. ... Much more than that, and less by very little. And it was there. . . . As far away as the world-to-come, a world whose doors are firmly shut, opening only with each death. There it was, my brothers, and our own childhood was there also. But things change. And the difference was great ... It's impossible to compare .... How very different! (Naqqdsh, p. 163) The binarism of the passage is clearly expressed, spatially (Iraq versus Israel), tem- porally (then versus now), and situationally (home versus exile). In a variation on Nahmanides' triad described above (exile, Land of Israel, world-to-come), here there is a clear parallel between distant home and world-to-come, both distinctly contrasted with Israel. The inner story is set toward the end of the festival in the family's sukkah, a temporary structure made permanent here through narration and repetition. The procedure of building the sukkah follows a set pattern year after year; the de- scription of this iterative event shifts to a specific instance, the last time the nar- rator and his family observed the holiday in Iraq. The night of Hoshana Rabbah that year, and the structure in which it is celebrated, achieve a permanent existence fixed by nostalgia in the narrator's memory and by the written text. The structure of the sukkah mirrors the narrative situation, framing the char- acters and their stories, holding them in warm embrace, separating the inside from the outside. The glorious booth of the past contrasts with the gloomy coffeehouse of the story present, standing in for childhood and for home. In memory, it is safe, permanent, and all-encompassing. It houses friends and family, the holy and the secular, the living and the dead. "All that exists was enclosed in a circle of wel- come, at the limit of the senses, the seen, the heard, the smelled, the felt" (Naqqash: p. 175). There is a self-conscious emphasis on the storytelling-the traditional cof- feehouse setting in the frame story, the narrator's turning to the implied audience, even the allusions to the "Arabian Nights" ("and after night turns over one thou- sand days," Naqqash, p. 12). As in The Thousand and One Nights, the storytelling is life-giving, protecting the narrator from the dreariness of the coffeehouse, the world of the present, and the state of exile in the State of Israel. The narrator at- tempts to offer a reprieve from the oppressive silence by telling his story and by temporarily creating community out of the audience assembled. This fictional quality is in tension with the elements of autobiography: the narrator's younger self appears as subject and object, and his tale ends with his family banished from what seems to have been Paradise. Naqqash's use of language in this work reinforces the perception of Israel as exile and Iraq as home. First, the work is written in Arabic.53 The inner narrative 53. An obvious counterpart to Naqqdsh is Anton Shammas, an Israeli Arab who published his best-selling novel, Arabesqot, in Hebrew. He has written about his choice of language in several venues; see, e.g., "Exile From a Democracy," in Literature in Exile, ed. John Glad (Durham: Duke University Press, 1990), pp. 84-86. In this essay, Shammas inverts the idea of exile and of language as home- land--as a Palestinian in Israel he feels an exile in his own home. Paradoxically, he has adopted the 320</page><page sequence="21">"Arab Chains" and "The Good Things of Sepharad" is made homey and familiar through its use of colloquial language in its lyrical de- scriptions and lively dialogue. The use of the dialect adds more than local color; it serves to document an endangered language and to portray the recent past in its own language.54 By contrast, the frame narrative, despite being in the guise of a spoken address, is kept to a somewhat stiff standard Arabic, typically spoken in more formal settings and between people without a dialect in common. This im- plies the lack of shared background among the members of the coffeehouse audi- ence and another aspect of exile: the absence of community. The difference be- tween the language used in the two parts-the frame and the framed-underscores the discontinuity and contrasts between now and then. Phrases in the framing nar- rative such as "like the traces of an abandoned campsite" place it in the context of the qasTdah (pre-Islamic ode), which traditionally opens with a section full of long- ing for the past.55 The narrator tries to make the coffeehouse into a substitute sukkah, to pop- ulate it for a brief and shining moment with the memories of Hoshana Rabbah, childhood, and home. Yet the distance between now and then is never fully erased. Gloom reigns, memories are recalled not created, and even the stories-once a source of security and enjoyment-betray. After describing a touching reunion scene between himself and Uncle Heskel Ezra, the narrator denies its truth-value: "But this never happened" (Naqqash, p. 214). This repudiation casts doubt on the reliability of his continuing narrative and on that of the frame as well. The narra- tor undermines his own position; the denial intended for the story immediately pre- ceding hovers over the stories that follow. Even so, the narrator allows the tragedies to assert their own truth. Just as the truth-value of the narrator's story is subverted, so too is the child- hood idea of the home as a safe, permanent and all-encompassing place. While the sukkah seems at first to be finished and whole, in reality it is not. Cousin Salih is absent; "the necklace is incomplete." The sukkah's seeming permanence is belied by both its traditional symbolism as transient and the framing narrative, which refers to this night as the last Hoshana Rabbah in Iraq. The frailty of the sukkah's protection is demonstrated when the threat from the outside creeps in like the smell of smoke. As Iraq becomes less and less hospitable to its ancient Jewish commu- nity, the gathering threat correlates with the loss of innocence and light. The evening of the last Hoshana Rabbah comes to an end with ominous fore- shadowing built on multiple allusions to the story of the Egyptian exile. The set- ting of the story, the season of Sukkot, and the sukkah itself recall the journey of the children of Israel, the circuitous route of their return from exile to the Land of Israel. "We became wandering foreign strangers," the narrator declares. The pillar language of Hebrew ("the language of grace") to express his state of exile ("the language of confu- sion"). Shammas now lives in the United States and writes essays in English; Naqqlsh has left Israel for London, writes in Arabic, and even considered moving to Cairo. 54. However, even qualified use of Iraqi Jewish colloquial Arabic requires careful glossing and limits the audience. It leads to an increasing distance between the writer and his source material, and freezes the dialect in an unnatural manner, dependent on--in this case--a twelve-year-old's vocabu- lary and an adult's memory of circa 1950. 55. Cf. above at note 16. 321</page><page sequence="22">Marc Saperstein and Nancy E. Berg of the cloud, which accompanied the children of Israel by day, summons its coun- terpart: the pillar of fire, the night companion. As with the sukkah, these pillars are transvalued from a positive symbol of guidance and protection to something threatening. Fire hovers on the edge of the narrative, in the flickering candles and gas lanterns. Its presence is presaged by the character Selim's smelling smoke. Baba Sida, the family elder, unable to smell the smoke, rebukes the younger Se- lim for being an alarmist; he represents the majority view of those in the Jewish community who did not sense any threat to their security in Iraq. Selim understood correctly the impermanence of the sukkah structure, of the home the Jews had made for themselves in Iraq. Only in a retrospective gaze at the denouement of the once great Jewish community of Babylonia can one understand Selim's insistence: "Warning is a duty" (Naqqash, p. 211). While the biblical departure from Egypt is an occasion for celebration in the annual holiday cycle, this novella offers a reinterpretation. By focusing on the forty years in the desert through the references chosen, the author and his narrator write a story of exile rather than homecoming.56 Here narration is eulogy. The dead mourned for by the story are less the phys- ically dead than the spiritually dead, those who have lost their innocence, their world of light, their Hoshana Rabbah past. It is dedicated to the memory of good- ness. Memory mediates between the story past and the narrative present. Like nar- ration, memory confers meaning through selecting events and ordering them. The story is a [re]construction of home. The sukkah, and that night of Hoshana Rab- bah, achieve a permanent existence in the narrator-character's memory and in the written text. At the end of the Hoshana Rabbah holiday the visitors disperse, the lanterns are taken down, and the sukkah is disassembled, no longer shelter or sanc- tuary. We see home in the process of becoming not home, yet it is still better than exile.57 Ironically, the sukkah, a temporary shelter on the way out of exile from Egypt back to the Land of Israel, here frames the story that bemoans the passage to Israel. Israel becomes the locus of exile, where innocence is seen as folly, where family members and friends lose track of each other, and where individuals fall prey to destitution, illness and despair. In Naqqdsh's account, Israel is a dreary coffeehouse, with a colorless-per- haps nonexistent-audience, contrasted with the lovingly decorated and well-lit sukkah brimming with friends and family. The Jewish pilgrimage festival that so strongly ties family members with each other and with their ancestral dead loses all currency in Zion. Instead, the Promised Land is the site of many tragedies: un- employment, poverty, senility, early death. The narrative ends when our guide the storyteller is told that his uncle is missing. In the new Israeli exile, the family is lost. 56.

In sociological and related studies the adult immigrants of the era are often referred to as "the desert generation." 57. In the text Baghdad is lovingly referred to as "the Lady of the Lands." 322</page><page sequence="23">"Arab Chains" and "The Good Things of Sepharad" Out of Egypt58 is a different kind of inversion of the exodus story and the idea of the Egyptian exile. This memoir recounts the last episodes in the life of one Jewish family in Alexandria. The final chapter begins with the father receiving an anonymous telephone call and proclaiming, "It's started." Earlier that day some- one had thrown a stone at one of the aunts and shouted, "Foreigners out!" The fa- ther's factory is nationalized, the family is hounded by frequent phone calls, and, ultimately, they are informed that they have one week to leave.59 The family is at once uniquely idiosyncratic and representative of the time and place. The members of the family bring a profusion of languages, backgrounds and citizenships: French, Ladino, English, Turkish, Greek, Syrian, Italian, Ger- man. In all of its polyglot-ness, the family serves as a microcosm of Jewish histo- ry or at least of the "Jewish condition," that is, fated to be wandering from one na- tion or culture to another.60 In the following passage, the young narrator prepares to take his leave from the only home he has ever known. It is the first night of Passover, 1965. He stands on the corniche looking out to the Mediterranean, in an ironic echo of Moses scan- ning the geography of the Promised Land from Mt. Nebo: Facing the night, I looked out at the stars and thought to myself, over there is Spain, then France, to the right Italy, and straight ahead, the land of Solon and Pericles. The world is timeless and boundless, and I thought of all the ship- wrecked, homeless mariners who had strayed to this very land and for years had tinkered at their damaged boats, praying for the wind, only to grow soft and reluctant when their time came ... And suddenly I knew, as I touched the damp, grainy surface of the sea- wall, that I would always remember this night, that in years to come I would remember sitting here, swept with confused longing as I listened to the water lapping the giant boulders beneath the promenade and watched the children head toward the shore in a winding, lambent procession. I wanted to come back tomorrow night, and the night after, and the one after that as well, sens- ing that what made leaving so fiercely painful was the knowledge that there would never be another night like this, that I would never eat soggy cakes along the coast road in the evening, not this year or any other year, nor feel the baf- fling, sudden beauty of that moment when, if only for an instant, I had caught myself longing for a city I never knew I loved (Aciman, pp. 339-40). 58.

After a brief respite following the Suez crisis (1956) in which the conditions for Jews liv- ing in Egypt improved, the early sixties brought an increase in anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli sentiment. The 1961 dissolution of the union between Egypt and Syria (the UAR) and the adoption of the Char- ter for National Action (1962) emphasizing Islam, nationalism, and socialism allowed less tolerance for minorities. The nationalization of privately owned factories-such as that of the father in Aciman's book-ended an era of prosperity for many middle-class Jews in Egypt. For more information see Michael M. Laskier, The Jews of Egypt 1920-1970: In the Midst of Zionism, Anti-Semitism, and the Middle East (New York: New York University Press, 1992). 60. Cf.

Berg The Acimans are neither as assimilated as Otto and his friends in Sobol's Vi- enna nor rooted for centuries as were the narrator and his family in Naqqash's Baghdad. They belong fully neither to the place that has been their home nor to their people and its traditions. Despite living in Egypt for a generation, no one in the family is fluent in Arabic. When the narrator is taken to task for never having done his Arabic homework ("But none of the other European boys studies Arabic," he protests [Aciman, p. 233]), the father has to turn to the servant's son to tutor the miscreant. The family is barely exposed to the indigenous culture. They listen to classical music, enjoy French plays, dress in fine Italian clothing ("don't match your clothes like a pauper" the boy is admonished, p. 329). "Such a pity," com- plains the grandmother when she finds yet another source of European imports. "Things are beginning to improve just when we are leaving" (p. 330). And yet, in Alexandria, the very 'high' European culture is part of the indigenous scene. Despite their religious heritage, no one in the family is fluent in Judaism. "What kind of Jews are we?" asks one of the older relatives. They don't know the prayers, they don't observe most of the commandments, and their attempts to hold a Passover Seder on their last night in Egypt falter and ultimately fail. [The father] began to recite in French, without irony, without flourishes, even meekly. But as soon as he began to feel comfortable with the text, he started to fumble, reading the instructions out loud, then correcting himself, or skip- ping lines unintentionally only to find himself reading the same line twice. At one point, wishing to facilitate his task, my grandmother said, "Skip that por- tion." He read some more and she interrupted again. "Skip that too." "No," said Elsa, "either we read everything or nothing at all." An argu- ment was about to erupt. ... No one had any idea what to do, what to read, or when to stop. "Some Jews we are," said Aunt Elsa, who had also started to laugh and whose eyes were tearing. "Shall we eat then?" asked my father. "Good idea," I said. (Aciman, p. 335) The irony of the family's last night in Egypt falling on Passover is not lost on the author, the reader-or, one suspects, the characters. The Aciman family is far from celebrating their departure. The anchor of the holiday not only reinforces the fam- ily's distance from traditional Judaism, but their cultural connection: they are per- secuted and forced from their home because they are Jewish. One of the central ironies of the modern Jewish experience is the frequency with which those most disconnected from their religious heritage are often most oppressed because of it. After the dismal attempt at a family seder, our first-person narrator takes a sentimental journey through the streets of Alexandria, suffused with the sadness of having to leave a place that has become home.61 He walks the corniche in 61. This is not unlike that taken by the protagonist of a modern Hebrew novel on the verge of leaving Baghdad for Israel, and their sentiments are similar: "I wanted to say that I am leaving Iraq. For good. Forever. I won't see the Tigris again before I die. I will stand in an unfamiliar street, in an unfa- miliar city, and scream and no one will hear me. It already happens in dreams. I already miss every- thing and I am still here. I don't know how this is different from death." Sami Michael, Hofen Shel Arafel (A Handful of Mist) (Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 1979), p. 230. In both of these stories the sadness is clearly the sadness of having to leave a place that has become home. 324</page><page sequence="25">"Arab Chains" and "The Good Things of Sepharad" Alexandria, and is offeredfiteer, the "soggy cakes" of the passage quoted. Fiteer is a traditional local food (not kosher for Passover) sold on the street corners dur- ing the month of Ramadan. The blend of cultures, foreign and local, shows the fam- ily to be not unlike other cosmopolitan-mongrel Jews living in Egypt at the time- separate from the indigenous people, yet not separate. In Aciman's memoir, the idea of Egypt-or any other place members of the family have lived-as a place of exile never enters the picture.62 Even less does the idea of Israel as the place of return from exile. Israel is not the destination of choice. In fact it is not even considered. On the verge of adolescence, the narrator- as-boy is the only one to take the prayers of the Passover Seder literally. He protests, "What I want is to have no part of [the Seder]. I don't want to cross the Red Sea. And I don't want to be in Jerusalem next year" (Aciman, p. 333). Exile in this case is leaving a place that has become home, no matter how unlikely, and while the family seems less rooted in Egypt than its counterparts in Iraq, in Austria and else- where-they all come from somewhere else and none are fluent in the vernacu- lar-Alexandria is the only place the boy has ever known as home.63 Aciman's narrative suggests that "Exile is a kind of dying."64 The father of the family has an expression for those who are on the threshold of leaving Egypt. Returning from the homes of those about to leave, he asks, "Did you smell the abat- toir?" Indeed, when the family finally packs to leave, the narrator recognizes the smell of the slaughterhouse. "Abattoir?" the boy asks. "Abattoir," the father con- firms. On his walk after the Seder, the narrator thinks about Alexandria, "about this city, so inseparable from who I was at that very instant" (Aciman, p. 315) and rec- ognizes the finality of his encounter: "And suddenly I knew ... that I would al- ways remember this night.. . (p. 339). It is a poignant account of the very personal nature of exile. And yet it is an experience potentially shared by everyone in the Jewish community. Exile is a place unknown, over the edge of the precipice. The condition of exile is consistent over the years, but the terms for explor- ing, understanding, and accommodating it have dramatically changed. The theo- logical dimension, so prominent in the pre-modern passages, is absent from these modern texts, replaced by psychology and the literary tradition of exile. In none of these cases is the relationship to God, or becoming a better Jew, the issue. Otto's religious conversion from Judaism appears to be motivated by accommodation, not 62. In his recent book of essays, False Papers (New York: Farrar Straus Giroux, 2000), Aciman describes his return to Alexandria as an adult. "I am, it finally occurs to me, doing the most typical thing a Jew could do," he writes. "I've come back to Egypt the way only Jews yearn to go back to places they couldn't wait to flee. The Jewish rite of passage, as Passover never tells us, is also the passage back to Egypt, not just away from it" (p. 5).

Para- doxically the multiplicity of these homes makes the idea of home in Egypt more permanent. See for example Itzhak Bar-Moshe, Bayt FT Baghd-d (A House in Baghdad) (Jerusalem: Association for Jewish Academics from Iraq, 1975).

The rituals of Hoshana Rabbah as described by the coffeehouse narrator are more a celebration of community than a spiritual occasion; in either case, they are abandoned in the new, Israeli exile. Our young narrator of Out of Egypt allows no place for tradition, religion or spirituality in his narrative, or in his life, past or present. Not surprisingly for exile literature, setting is dominant in these narratives. So too is the extra-literary context: the language in which each text is written, where, when and by whom. Only the first text, authored by an Israeli in Hebrew for an Israeli audience, suggests that Israel is a possible redemption from Jewish exile. Yet the setting of the drama is in early-twentieth-century Europe, a nursery for both modern antisemitism and political Zionism. Home in the other works- crafted in Arabic and English respectively by writers who had both experienced the dislocation of exile-is personal, not national, where the heart actually is and not in the poetic East. In both cases home is in an Arab country; in the former text, the site of the ancient, rooted and accomplished community of Babylonian Jewry, and in the latter, a stopping ground for more recent arrivals from Syria, Turkey and Europe. The "Arab chains" here seem to be the emotional ties to the "good things of Sepharad" (or Baghdad, or Alexandria). And the "dust of Zion," no longer in "Edom's domain," is merely dust, not at all precious. Israel is neither home nor re- demption. In one case, it is a site of personal exile, and in the other it is irrelevant to the entire discussion. Jewish identity bears upon the issue of exile only as a con- tributing factor to the experience, and as a set of cultural codes to express this ex- perience. The traditional mode, in which the world is divided into the land of Is- rael and the Galut, has been eclipsed by one in which the world divides into home and exile with a constantly shifting geography.
