(It must have taken a whole day to deliver that lecture.) Joshua Blau is a sound and authoritative scholar, and his contributions have made a significant impact on our discipline. This is a very useful dis- cussion on these two important Semitic languages--Hebrew and Arabic- before and after their respective revivals. The first chapter is a brief history of Arabic and Hebrew before their revival. Blau discusses how both Standard Arabic and Hebrew have under- gone a modern renaissance after having unexpectedly experienced a time of decay (Arabic in the thirteenth to eighteen centuries and Hebrew in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries). The similarities in the renaissance of the two languages are such that both are to be included in the general frame- work of the adaptation to Western culture of languages outside the Western sphere; both are connected with the national renaissances of both peoples. Blau traces the history of both languages, stressing that Standard Arabic emerged in the sixth century as a supratribal literary language, as distinct from the spoken language, which had numerous dialects. Hebrew has two strains in its history, Biblical Hebrew and Middle Hebrew. The perpetuation of both Standard Arabic and Hebrew was due to the fact that they were the languages of traditional societies, based on religion, in which the religious texts were memorized. The differences in the historical development of the two languages are: (1) Standard Arabic was the literary language of the majority of the popula- tion in a continuous territory in which the spoken languages were Arabic dialects. Hebrew was the language of the Jews, who were in the minority, dispersed in various countries where the spoken languages were those of the surrounding people. (2) Standard Arabic has a single linguistic development with uniformity and invariability in spelling, morphology, and syntax. In discussing the revival of Hebrew versus the renaissance of Standard Arabic, Blau notes how both competed with other languages: Hebrew with European languages, but primarily with Yiddish, which had become a cul- tural language; Arabic with European languages, but primarily with the dialects. The revival of Hebrew was due to the historical situation among the Jewish immigrants to Palestine. Hebrew was the cultural language common to all, and thus it became the cultural and spoken language. This is in contrast to Arabic, where the cultural language is Standard Arabic but the vernacular remained one of the Arabic dialects.</page><page sequence="3">264 BOOK REVIEWS Both Modern Hebrew and Modern Standard Arabic have conspicuous differences in phraseology, vocabulary, and syntax derived from their respective classical languages and thus must be regarded as new stages in the development of each language. Blau stresses that the parallel processes affecting the two languages are due not to their influence on each other, but to the influence of Standard Average European. He gives numerous illustra- tions of ways in which this has occurred, such as European borrowing from the Hebrew and then the Arabic taking it from the European, or from Arabic to European to Hebrew; the use of phrases and concepts in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament which were taken over into European usage and then into Arabic and Hebrew. The influence of Standard Average European on vocabulary, phrase- ology, and syntax is very significant according to our author. Here he gives a plethora of examples showing the "semantic extension," that is, the seman- tic shift in meaning of words and phrases from Classical Hebrew and Stan- dard Arabic to correspond to the meaning in Standard European languages. He also notes the syntactical imitation by both modern languages of the Standard Average European: usage of continuative relative clauses; adverbs of circumstance being marked by the accusative; tendency to introduce verbs into nominal clauses; frequent use of temporal clauses to designate contrast; consecutive clauses introduced by "so that"; use of the "cleft sentence"; use of the passive when the agent is marked; two nouns in con- struct directly followed by the nomen retum; use of two contrasted preposi- tions preceding the governed noun and the greater frequency of adverbials. Other similarities to Standard Average European include the tense structure of Modern Hebrew, and the use of periods. Blau concludes that in orthography and morphology the two languages have preserved their ancient character, but in other linguistic fields they exhibit new layers of development. In speaking of the differences between Modern Hebrew and Modern Standard Arabic, Blau stresses that: (1) Modern Standard Arabic is only a cultural language while Modern Hebrew is used in every sphere of life, including speech; (2) Arabic is tripartite (Modern Standard Arabic/ Classical Arabic/dialects) while Hebrew is binary (Classical/Modern); (3) the Classical phases differ in that Standard Arabic has relative unifor- mity while in Hebrew there are two classical languages: Biblical and Post- biblical, whereas Modern Hebrew has amalgamated elements from both classical strains.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 265 Blau concludes this lengthy "lecture" by briefly describing the history of the language academies of both languages, and their areas of interest: both deal with a consonantal script and an inconsistent use of matres lectionis, hence uniformity in spelling is difficult to achieve; variations in spelling; and coining of new terms. Under the latter he discusses the techniques employed: use of secondary roots, quadriliteral roots, absorbing foreign words by using homonymous autochthonous words, and also compounds and pre- fixes. The book is very readable and easy to understand, especially due to the inclusion of the English translations of all foreign words and phrases. However, the technical aspects of the printing leave much to be desired: letters not all on same line level; divisions of words at the end of lines are not right (see p. 155, "rei-gned"); lack of spaces after periods; and commas and some words being run together. There is no arrangement of examples, especially in Chapter 4. Had they been systematically arranged according to type, it would be much easier to follow. Such a significant and useful book should have been attractively printed. These flaws are minor and insignifi- cant for those readers who will doubtless be delighted with the contents. This volume is required reading for all who are interested in Hebrew and Arabic. The general linguist will also greatly benefit from it. It will prove a valuable source of reference and information and is highly recommended. Menahem Mansoor University of Wisconsin Madison, Wis.</page></plain_text>
