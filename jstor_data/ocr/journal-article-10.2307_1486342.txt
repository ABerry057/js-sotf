<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EMERGENCE OF HASMONEAN COINAGE By URIEL RAPPAPORT University of Haifa The topic under discussion here has been dealt with often in the scholarly literature on Jewish numismatics. In the last five decades con- siderable progress has been made, which has brought about a better understanding of the problem and resolved some of its difficulties.1 We shall try-availing ourselves of some of these contributions-to pursue the problem further. ---A-- A major obstacle in past research on Hasmonean coinage was the inclusion of coins of the first revolt, namely the "Thick Sheqels" and some bronzes. Discussion of these incorrect attributions distracted attention from more productive lines of research.2 This controversy is now resolved be- 1. We note the following: O. R. Sellers and W. F.

Both numismatic and archaeological evidence agree that both the "Thick Sheqels" and the aforementioned bronzes are to be completely disassociated from Hasmonean coinage." We shall there- fore ignore this question. --B- The first bit of information we have concerning Hasmonean coinage is one sentence in a letter of King Antiochus VII Sidetes of Syria to Simon the Hasmonean4 from the year 139/8 B.C.E. It reads as follows: K~a 7rkpefdl oL oroLcoac KG/I/a 'oL0V, VO6/tyIa rT Xcjpg ov (I Mace. 15:6). It is translated in the Dropsie edition as follows: "I turn over to you the right to make your own stamp for coinage for your country" (pp. 231-33). Since no coins were struck as a result of this permission and since- along with some other grants contained in the same letter-it was annulled shortly afterwards by Antiochus VII,5 we must disassociate the beginning of Hasmonean coinage from this document and deny the dependence of Hasmonean coinage on it. If we assume a connection between the royal permission and actual Hasmonean minting, we must also assume a similar situation in Judaea both under Simon and at some later period in John Hyrcanus' rule. Such an assumption does not accord with the development of the Hasmonean state into a completely independent and sovereign one. Simon may have been partially a vassal ruler, or at least was viewed as such by the Seleucids.6 Under such circumstances there was some mean- ing to the grants of Antiochus VII to him, including the permission to strike coins. Later this permission as well as other grants were rescinded by Antiochus VII, and after a while Judaea became even more dependent on the Seleucids.7 Judaea's subjugation continued for about five years, till Antiochus' army was defeated and he himself fell in battle against the Parthians in 129 B.C.E. From then on began the full political indepen- dence of Judaea under John Hyrcanus I (following-J.H. I), who openly challenged the Seleucids. Though he may have suffered some set- 3.

I Mace. 14:38; 15:26, 35). 7. After the murder of Simon (134 B.C.E.) Antiochus VII attacked Judaea and forced John Hyrcanus to surrender. See Ant., XIII, 236-53.</page><page sequence="3">URIEL RAPPAPORT 173 backs, he was successful in making Judaea a sovereign state.8 This renders unlikely his dependence on any foreign power for permission to strike coins. No connection then, is to be assumed between the document men- tioned above and Hasmonean coinage. -C- Let us see now what motivation the Hasmoneans could have had to strike coins. Were they eager to have coinage of their own? Did they see in it an important manifestation of their sovereignty? In the Hellenistic period coinage was indeed considered as an important manifestation of the status of a certain political unit, be it a dynastic state or a city-state (i.e., a polis). The states used their coins to spread religious and political data, to inspire admiration for themselves and/or for their rulers, and to stress the dynastic element in the state. This was done par- ticularly through silver coins, which were considered suitable for this pur- pose. Political importance was usually attached to them, whereas bronze coins were considered to be only their reflection, with no intrinsic impor- tance. Very rarely, if at all, was the attempt at political self-assertion made through bronze coins only, whereas silver coins served this aim quite often.9 These facts ought to be given due consideration in considering the Hasmonean coinage, which consists only of bronze coins. Was there any political or dynastic motivation to the first issue of Has- monean coins? Did Hasmonean coinage form a step in the march of Judaea towards sovereignty? We think the answer is negative. Had Hasmonean coinage any such purpose we would expect it to be in silver.10 An illumin- ating example of such silver coinage are the Jewish silver coins of both the first and the second revolt, which were minted specifically with such pur- pose.11 8. See Ant., XIII, 254 ff. and especially paragraph 273: ". .. After the death of Antiochus (Sidetes) he too revolted from the Macedonians, and no longer furnished them any aid either as subject or as a friend" (R. Marcus' translation in the Loeb ed.). For J. H. I's reversals see E. Schiirer revised English edition, 1973, I, 204-6. A completely different approach is taken by L. Mildenberg in Historia Judaica, 11(1949), 86, 99 and notes. 9. See the survey of E. J. Bickerman, Institutions des Sileucides, 1938, chap. VI, pp. 211-35. 10. There is no reason whatsoever to suppose that the Hasmoneans were unable to mint in silver, for the Nabatean kings and even cities like Tyre or Ascalon did so. That the Hasmoneans were not too poor for this we may gather from passages like I Macc. 15:24, 32; Ant., XIII, 249 (cf. R. Marcus' note, op. cit., ad loc.), 273; Ant., XIV, 34-36. 11. As can be seen both by the fact that they were struck in silver and by their inscriptions and symbols.</page><page sequence="4">174 EMERGENCE OF HASMONEAN COINAGE Moreover, Hasmonean coins lack some other qualities which made coins popular as instruments of political propaganda and dynastic glorifi- cation. They do not bear any portraits of the rulers, so common on other contemporary coins. Since their coins served neither political nor dynastic interests, it is not plausible that the Hasmoneans (with the exception of Mattathias-Antigonus) struck them with any of these interests in mind. Furthermore, Hasmonean coinage is technically so inferior that it seems likely that it was of no major importance to the Hasmoneans. Minting in Judaea at that period probably was a sensitive matter. Any human or zoological representation was opposed, and the religious-national revival at that period made it impossible for the Hasmoneans to consider minting in the way done in the neighboring states. Since the Hasmoneans were aware of, and probably in full agreement with, this self-imposed limita- tion, the coins lost any attraction they might have had as means of com- munication or propaganda. Their attitude towards coinage was one of indifference and no initiative was taken to issue coins in silver, for they were a priori unable to equal, not to say compete, with the other dynastic coins of their time. Bronze was not important and there was no desire to issue it. Usually even dates were not put on those coins; this may show how trivial they were considered by the government itself. D-- Why, then, did the Hasmoneans mint at all? An answer, which seems reasonable to us, was already suggested by some numismatists.'2 It was pointed out that the Hasmoneans minted coins willy-nilly, and they did so mainly because of their responsibility to supply the need of the country for "small change." Such a need resulted from the fact that the Seleucid government was neither responsible nor expected-after 129 B.C.E.- to supply it. Contrary to silver coins-which were diffused beyond the borders of their immediate place of minting and may even have served in international trade-bronze coins were usually minted and used lo- cally.'3 With no one else to maintain the necessary supply of bronze coins, this task naturally fell on the shoulders of the Hasmoneans, who actually began to mint a fully independent bronze coinage. The dependence, or relation, of the first Hasmonean coins to the autonomous coinages of some neighboring city-states does not seem very likely to us.'4 No doubt 12. See A. Ben-David, op. cit., p. 96. 13. See E. J. Bickerman, op. cit., pp. 216-17, 225 et passim. 14. Hasmonean coins differ from the cities' coins not only in the lack of silver</page><page sequence="5">URIEL RAPPAPORT 175 Judaea gained its independence through the general disintegration of the Seleucid empire, but its bronze coins did not play any role in the latter event. Hasmonean bronze coinage was created out of necessity, and its minting did not go beyond the demands of necessity. Hasmonean bronze coins appeared when a shortage of small change made their minting indispens- able. They do not reflect Judaea's attainment of independence, but are a post factum evidence of its position as already fully independent. Since no shortage of silver coins was felt, silver was never minted by the Has- moneans. Silver coins were interchangeable among states and may have been used-to be sure with some exceptions'5-far from their minting place. So an influx of silver coins entered Judaea regularly, dependent on economic activity and other factors.'6 There was no compelling reason for the Judaean government to supply them, as there was with bronze, in part because of the ample minting of silver at nearby Tyre. Tyrian silver coins are found in large quantities in Eretz-Israel throughout this period, and-either with some formal arrangement or more probably without it -they supplied Judaea's need for silver currency.'7 minting, but also by their dynastic character and the avoidance of promulgation of their independence. (They did not declare their autonomy, etc. and did not use a new era, as did some of the cities and the later coins of the Jewish revolts.) Has- monean coins referred only to their factual sovereign status at that time. For a different approach see B. Kanael, op. cit., in IEJ, 1(1951) and M. Krupp, "Bemerkungen zur Miinzgeschichte der Hasmonier," Institutum Judaicum der Univer- sitiit Tiibingen (1971-72), p. 132. 15. For such an exception see M. Rostovzeff, "Some Remarks on the Monetary and Commercial Policy of the Seleucids and Attalids," in Anatolian Studies presented to W. H. Buckler, Manchester, 1939, pp. 277-98. 16. We may surmise that payment to mercenaries was a large item in the budget (Ant., XIII, 249) and was paid in silver. On the other hand some revenues-in addition to regular taxes, customs and other income-might have been drawn from the Temple. Though the earliest references to regular contributions (by now prob- ably the Half-Sheqel) are a little later than the period under discussion (cf. Cicero, Pro Flacco, 28, 68; Jos., Ant., XIV, 112-13; and also Th. Reinach, "Mithridate et les Juifs," REJ, 16(1888), 204-10), it is quite possible that contributions to the Temple were already current in the time of J.H. I. 17. See A. Kindler in Eretz-lsrael, 8(1967) (Sukenik Memorial Volume), 322-23 (in Hebrew); A. Ben-David, Jerusalem und Tyrus, 1969. An example of Hasmonean bronze and Tyrian silver as the currency in Judaea at that period is provided by the finds at Qumran. See R. de Vaux, Archaeology and the Dead Sea Scrolls (1973, rev. English edition), pp. 34-36 and RB, 63(1956), 565-69. Cf. also B. Kanael, "Some Observations on the Chronology of Khirbet Qumran," in Eretz-lsrael, 5(1958), 164-70 (in Hebrew).</page><page sequence="6">176 EMERGENCE OF HASMONEAN COINAGE --E,---- It is difficult to determine when Hasmonean coinage began, for it is mostly undated,'s relatively stereotypic, technically poor and limited to bronze. So we have to rely mainly upon the evidence of hoards and finds in archaeological excavations and on the contents of the coins' inscrip- tions. Historical argumentation is only secondary and admittedly quite often it is not as decisive as we may wish it to be. Several findings at archaeological sites, already partially discussed, are relevant here. Such are the findings at Beth Zur,'0 to which great importance was attached in refuting the attribution of coins of the first revolt to the Has- monean period (see above). They also supply us with important data about the sequence of coins, which were in use in Judaea in the Hellen- istic and Hasmonean periods. Attention was already drawn to this evi- dence in relation to Y. Meshorer's theory that Alexander Janneus was the first Hasmonean to strike coins.20 In any event, the coins found at Beth-Zur show that Seleucid bronze coins ceased to be used in Judaea around 130 B.C.E., i.e., with the final debicle of the Seleucid armies against the Parthians (129 B.C.E.). The last significant Seleucid coin finds are followed by Hasmonean coins, mainly of John Hyrcanus. Assum- ing now that there is no other way to establish the attribution of these coins (inscribed with the name of Yehohanan in Hebrew) to either J.H. I or J.H. II-what can we learn from the find itself? Beth-Zur played an important role in the time of the Maccabean re- volt,21 but with the conquest of Idumaea by J.H. I (approximately in 125 B.C.E.)22 Beth-Zur began to decline. Because the border of Judaea was pushed farther south the place apparently lost its strategic importance.23 18. For the exceptions see J.

I and not of J.H. II, in whose days the site was almost completely abandoned. The sequence of the coins found in Beth-Zur also points to the same conclusion.24 A very clear and sharp decline in Seleucid coins is noticed after Antiochus VII, and the only continuation of coins on the site is with the Yehoh.anan coins.25 The assumption that those coins are of J.H. II would create an unexplained gap from approximately 130 to at least 67 B.C.E. We infer then that those Yehohanan coins can be attributed only to J.H. I. Similar to the evidence from Beth-Zur is that from other excavations. Though very general, the numismatic report from Maresha (Marissa) points in the same direction.26 This city also declined at the same time as Beth-Zur.27 The same general conclusion is to be drawn from the evidence from Gezer, which also shared the same circumstance as Beth-Zur.28 Somewhat similar are the results of the survey at the site of Yodpath (Yotapatha) in Galilee. But the very general resum6 of the findings and its location in Galilee, not in Judaea, do not allow definite conclusions.29 Other findings are not relevant to our problem.30 The same is true of some, if not all, hoards of Hasmonean coins.3' 24. See notes 19 and 20 above and the table in Ben-David, op. cit., p. 97. 25. Such a sequence is reflected, e.g., in the Ptolemaic and Seleucid coin finds in Eretz-Israel. They show clearly the point of transition and the direct sequence of coins with the takeover of the country by Antiochus III from Ptolemy V. See table II in M.

Not only did Maresha decline because of geopolitical changes but it also suffered severely in the conquest of Idumaea by J.H. I. See U.

Kindler, director of the "Kadman Museum of Coins" in Tel-Aviv, for publication. According to Kindler this group was actually a hoard."3 Most of the coins-of Akko- Ptolemais-are dated to the years 130-110 B.C.E."3 Since three coins of Yehohanan were also found in this "hoard," it seems that they must be attributed to J.H. I. -F- Another consideration which does not support the attribution of Yeho- hanan coins to J.H. II is the very precarious position and restricted author- ity of J.H. II under the Romans. This precludes, in our opinion, the possibility that he minted the Yehohanan coins. It is very unlikely that he was able to mint at all at the beginning of his career (before his deposition by his brother Aristobulus II), since he reigned solely only about three months.M The authority he may have held before that, in his mother's life, did not make it appropriate for him to mint, especially since Alexan- dra herself never struck coins with her own name. Later, in 67-63 B.C.E., he did not hold power in Judaea and undoubtedly was in no position to mint.a The most suitable period, then, for J.H. II to strike coins would have been after his reinstallation by Pompey in 63 B.C.E. But, his position under the Romans does not at all suggest that he enjoyed the right to mint coins, and even less-that he was entitled to strike coins with an inscrip- tion such as Yehohanan HaKohen HaGadol VeHever HaYehudim or the report on the site in stencil by Y. Naveh, in Hebrew, 1966, pp. 31-34); Crowfoot and Fitzgerald, "Excavations in the Tyropoieon Valley, Jerusalem 1927," PEF Annual, 5(1929), 103-20; J. W. Crowfoot, G. M. Crowfoot, K. M.

The report on Shechem is so unclear about the Hasmonean findings that no conclusion can be drawn from it [O. R. Sellers, BA, 25,3(1962), 96]. 31. As with excavation finds, the value of hoards for our discussion is limited if they are composed mainly of coins of only one ruler. See M. Thompson, O. Mtrkholm, C. M. Kraay (eds.), An Inventory of Greek Coin Hoards (1973), nos. 1608; 1611; 1612; 1615; 1623; 1624; 1625. 32. A.

The very severe arrangements imposed by Pompey on JudaeaS6 and the even more severe settlement imposed on it a few years later by Gabin- ius,37 rule out any such possibility. The institution of Hever HaYehudim mentioned on those coins is contradictory to the position of the Jews under Rome at that time as well as to the general tendencies of Roman politics.38 Improvement in the position of J.H. II took place after 47 B.C.E., when favor was shown to him by Julius Caesar."A9 Indeed, those who attribute coins to J.H. II would consider this short span of time, which extends at most to 40 B.C.E., as suitable for the minting of the Rosh HNever HaYehudim coins, because J.H. II was nominated by Caesar to be Ethnarchos.40 But this contention is not convincing. There is no reason to place the Rosh Hever HaYehudim coins among the last of the Yeho- hanan coins and among the last of Hasmonean coinage in general (with the exception of Mattathias-Antigonus coins). Besides, such an attribution has meaning only if we attribute all, or at least many other Yehoh.anan Kohen Gadol VeHever HaYehudim coins to J.H. II. This, we tried to show, is untenable. So there is no reason to attribute any coins to J.H. II in the years 47-41 B.C.E., after an interval of some thirty years (76-47 B.C.E.) in Hasmonean coinage.41 36.

Clearly Gabinius' division of Judaea into five synhedria as well as Pompey's rigid treatment of Judaea rules out any function of Hever HaYehudim. No sov- ereignty was left to it. Judaea was curtailed, divided and under the administration and even the jurisdiction of the Roman governor of Syria.

The inscription Rosh Hever HaYehudim can be explained satisfactorily in regard to J.H. I. Cf. my review article cited in note 20, p. 114. In any event J.H. I probably began his rule as Ethnarch, a position he might have inherited from his</page><page sequence="10">180 EMERGENCE OF HASMONEAN COINAGE The first one who was allowed under Roman rule to strike coins- admittedly only bronze coins-was King Herod. His position under Rome, as king, was incomparably better than that of J.H. II.42 It would be only reasonable then to suppose that the much weaker J.H. II was not allowed any coinage at all.43 -G- We will end our discussion with comments on some additional aspects of the problem, which seem to us to be relevant to our main theme. (1) Connected with the attribution of Yehohanan coins to either J.H. I or J.H. II is the attribution of Yehuda HaKohen HaGadol VeHever Ha- Yehudim coins to either Judah-Aristobulus I or Judah-Aristobulus II. If we attribute the Yehohanan coins to J.H. II, we should attribute the Yehuda coins to Aristobulus II.44 Otherwise we may attribute the Yehuda coins to Aristobulus I. Which of the two attributions is preferable? We are in favor of the attribution to Aristobulus I. The inscription Yehuda Ha- Kohen HaGadol VeHiever HaYehudim is more plausible on coins of a successor of J.H. I than on those of the son and the successor of Janneus. The first-Aristobulus I-was not, in all probability, king, and the con- stitution of Judaea continued under him, outwardly at least, as before. Thus the inscription fits him well.45 For Aristobulus II we would expect the title "king" to appear on his coins, as it appeared both on his father's and his son's coins. An absence of coinage under him is also more easily explicable than is one under Aris- tobulus I. Probably Janneus' massive minting made additional coinage father Simon (I Macc. 14:47). But it is to be kept in mind that this word, Ethnarch, translates here a Hebrew term unknown to us, whereas in the case of J.H. II, he was appointed Ethnarch, but we do not know for sure what the Hebrew term was which was used to translate this Greek word. For more about the sequence of Yehohanan coins see below. 42. On Herod's position see Schiirer, revised English edition (1973), pp. 316-17. 43. Since we viewed Hasmonean coinage till Mattathias-Antigonus as a response to monetary necessity, it may be noted here that under Janneus the minting of bronze coins was copious. For the great number of Janneus coins in comparison to other issues see, for example, the hoard noted in Israel Numismatic Bulletin (Nos. 3-4, August-December, 1962, p. 106); the finds from Qumran (R. de Vaux, op. cit., p. 36); and the hoard from Ophel (PEFQS, 1927, p. 184). Cf. also B. Kanael, op. cit., in note 17, p. 166b and M. Krupp, op. cit., p. 132. It is quite possible then that no urgent need for bronze coins was felt for some decades following Janneus' rule. 44.

Thus Shelomzion-Alexandra and Aristobulus II (ruling almost immediately after her) felt no need to issue new bronze coins (see note 43 above). (2) The most recent article related to the subject under discussion is by Y. Meshorer.46 He reports the acquisition by the Israel Museum of a tiny coin (0.77 gr., apparently of bronze, though not stated as such) with a radiate head of Antiochus VIII on the obverse and a lily on the reverse, and the letters BA which he deciphers as B(a tX&amp;ows) A(vrt6bxov)47 and LK (= year 20). The coin seems to be unique and, besides the abbreviation BA, the dating by regnal year is extremely rare on Seleucid coins. For this Meshorer rightly sees an analogy in coins of Tryphon struck at Ascalon. He concludes that the coin is to be dated to 102 B.C.E. and that it was minted at Jerusalem. By this he tries to prove that no Hasmonean coins were struck in Jerusalem prior to Janneus, whose reign began in 103 B.C.E.4s However, from the aforementioned data we should rather conclude that this coin was minted at Ascalon. The only link to Jerusalem is that a series of coins of Antiochus VII, commonly attributed to a mint at Jerusalem,49 indeed bear an anchor on one side and a lily on the other side. The lily which is similar on both 46. Y. Meshorer, "The Beginning of the Hasmonaean Coinage," IEJ, 24(1974), 59-61. 47. Ibid., p. 60, and we may add to the similar abbreviations cited there an Ascalonian coin of Alexander Balas-B( aarLhw ) A( X~w&amp;vpov ). See A. B. Brett, "The Mint of Ascalon Under the Seleucids," ANSMN, 4(1950), 48, no. 7. 48. "This would prove the theory suggested in 1967, that Hyrcanus I (135-104 B.C.) as well as Aristobulus I (104/3 B.C.) did not mint coins and that Alexander Janneus was the first Hasmonean who minted coins, starting after 102 B.C." Meshorer, ibid., p. 61. 49. This attribution is already found in L. F. de Saulcy, Recherches sur la num- ismatique judai'que, 1854, pp. 100-101; Cf. also E. Babelon, Rois de Syrie . 1890, p. CXLIII, nos. 1166-67. Cf. also no. 1448; P. Gardner, BMC-Syria, p. XXXII; p. 75, no. 69; pl. XX, no. 14. O. Mlrkholm in International Numismatic Convention, Jerusalem 1963, 1967, p. 86 also accepts this attribution. For additional coins of this and similar series cf. SNG (Syria-Seleucid kings), Copenhagen, 1959, nos. 248, 340; SNG, VI, I (Lewis collection), London, 1972, nos. 1089; 1090; 1091; SNG, IV, VIII (Fitzwilliam Museum), London, 1971, no. 5754. A. Kindler refers to these coins in more general terms: "Coins of this type are found mainly in Judea, hence the assumption that they were minted for this region." (in Coins of the Land of Israel, Collection of the Bank of Israel, A Catalogue, 1974, p. 12, no. 3). We favor Kindler's cautious statement. An attribution of these coins to Ascalon would account well with the frequent finds of these coins in Judaea. The attribution of Seleucid coins to a mint in Jerusalem may be doubtful also because Jerusalem was not a polis at that time. It is questionable if a mint would have been established by the Seleucids in a place other than a Hellenistic polis.</page><page sequence="12">182 EMERGENCE OF HASMONEAN COINAGE coins is rightly considered typical of Judaea, both because of antecedents in the late Persian period and subsequent use of it on Hasmonean coins.50 But this is not enough for such an attribution. Those coins of Antiochus VII-if struck at Jerusalem at all (see note 49 above)--do not bear a human head on either side, probably in deference to the sentiments of the Jews. Nevertheless, this coin, surely later, ignored this sensitivity and bears the image of the king. Moreover, Antiochus VII coins bear dates according to the regular Seleucid usage, whereas on this coin an extraordinary dating is used. In addition, this very same date LK (year 20) is known to us on another coin, which was struck at Ascalon.51 The only connection to Jerusalem then is the lily on that coin of Anti- ochus VIII. But this argument cannot outweigh all the other contradictory evidence. Moreover, this phenomenon can be explained by the influence of the previous coins of Antiochus VII, wherever they may have been minted (see note 49 above). Finally, we must consider, in addition to the above arguments, the historical situation in Eretz-Israel at the very end of the second century B.C.E. Is it at all feasible that any Seleucid king at that time was in a position to strike coins at Jerusalem?52 From what is known about Judaea after 129 B.C.E. this seems unlikely (see section B above). It would be superfluous to enter into details at this point,53 but contention such as that of Meshorer must necessarily be based on a reevaluation of Hasmonean history. (3) Another consideration-of a different kind-which affects our theme is the inner development of Hasmonean coinage, mainly in its first 50. Meshorer, op. cit., p. 60. 51. A tetradrachm with a royal portrait and an eagle with the inscription .A2K IEPA2 AZ ATTO and the date LK. See G. Macdonald, "Seltene und unedierte Seleukidenmiinzen," Zeits. fiir Numismatik 29(1912), 103, no. 38. Macdonald's at- tribution of this coin to Antiochus VIII is challenged by A. B. Brett, "A New Cleopatra Tetradrachm of Ascalon," AJA, 41(1937), 454 et passim and id., "The Mint of Ascalon under the Seleucids," ANSMN, 4(1950), 54. In any case we do not wish to imply that the coin is not of Antiochus VIII or that the date is not ac- cording to regnal years, but only to demonstrate how far the attempted attribution of the small bronze coin discussed above is from being conclusive, and that alter- native approaches to the attribution of the coin are possible. 52. As remarked so aptly by H. Seyrig: "Le probl~me est done un probl~me historique: quel 6tait le status de J6rusalem en 106/105?" Unfortunately it was not answered. See Meshorer, op. cit., pp. 60-61. 53. At precisely the period ascribed for this coin (either 106/5 or 102/1 B.C.E.) Judaea was flourishing and no reason can be found for Seleucid coinage there. For details see M. Stern, in Zion, 26(1961), esp. 16-21.</page><page sequence="13">URIEL RAPPAPORT 183 stages, i.e., the Yehohanan coins. Their development, from the numis- matic point-of-view, shows their origin in a Hellenistic-Seleucid-Palestinian background and indicates their chronological sequence as well. One of the major problems which faced those who were in charge of Hasmonean minting, at least in its initial phases, was the necessity of abolishing any human representation from these new Jewish coins,54 though such representations were very common all around them. The Seleucid coins, like many others, usually had the portrait of the king on the obverse (with no inscription on this side), and some scene or symbol surrounded by or in between an inscription on the reverse. The inscription gave the king's name, and the date and various monograms also appear quite often on this side. This was, generally speaking, the regular form of Seleucid and many other Hellenistic coins, on which the Jewish coins were naturally modeled, but from which they deviated considerably. The first and more rudimentary solution to this problem seems to have been the replacement of the portrait by a spacious emblem (it can hardly be called a symbol). This emblem appears, like the royal portrait, with no additional inscription or any other mark. The most startling example of this solution may be found in the helmet-cornucopiae coin of J.H. I.65 The meaningless helmet, copied from Seleucid coins,"5 fills the field of the obverse and so the usual king's portrait, which was an anathema in Jewish eyes, is replaced. A similar solution was adopted on a less rare series, the lily-palm-branch coins, where the lily covers all the obverse field and the reverse bears the palm-branch as symbol, with inscriptions on both its sides.57 This somewhat rudimentary solution to the iconic problem soon gave way to a more developed one. New coins were minted, on which erasure of the portrait was made good by separation of the inscription and the symbol of the reverse. Thus the surplus space, which resulted from the abolition of the portrait, was used in a better way. Instead of the king's 54. See Exodus 20:4-5; Deuteronomy 5:8-9. Though in later periods a more lenient approach was adopted, it was very rigid at least up to the Bar-Kochba revolt. This rigid attitude began no later than the Hasmonean period with its national and religious renaissance. 55. Meshorer, No. 25; Reifenberg, No. 7; Hill, BMC-Palestine, p. 188, No. 1. 56. Babelon, Rois de Syrie . . ., 1890, no. 1449; Macdonald, op. cit., no. 28; Brett, ANSMN, 4(1950), 48-49. Similar bronze coins, with no portrait, may have suggested this simple solution to the Hasmonean mint masters, who imitated them in other details too. 57. Meshorer, nos. 21, 21A, 24; Reifenberg, no. 12; Hill, pp. 195-96, nos. 48-56. We will not deal at this point with the Greek letters on some of these coins.</page><page sequence="14">184 EMERGENCE OF HASMONEAN COINAGE portrait, or the spacious meaningless emblem on the above-mentioned Yehohanan coin (note 55 above), we find on the obverse the inscription, inscribed in the center of the field and encircled by a wreath. This side, with its Hebrew inscription, now became the obverse.58 The reverse re- mains with the symbol (but without an inscription, which was transferred to the other side of the coin) to serve as the main and most significant part of it. This development produced another change, this time in the symbol of the reverse. In the helmet-cornucopiae coin of J.H. I we have parallel cornucopiae,"5 the two horns of which are arranged alongside each other. This arrangement of the "horns" left barely enough space to accommo- date the inscription which accompanied them on the reverse.60 In the more recent coins, where the inscription was taken away from the cornu- copiae and much more space was left free on that side, the horns were designed in such a way that they covered the field of that side of the coin completely. So, instead of the "parallel cornucopiae" we find the more spacious cornucopiae, tied at the bottom and with horns spreading on two sides, covering the field and even leaving place in their midst for an additional secondary symbol, the pomegranate. To sum up: The first coins struck under J.H. I were the helmet- cornucopiae series. These were followed by the lily-palm-branch series. After them, or perhaps concurrently, the wreathed inscription-spreading cornucopiae series was minted.'ex 58. This seems to have been noticed by G. F. Hill, who was followed by A. Reifenberg but, unfortunately, not by Y. Meshorer. See the references in notes 55 and 57 above. 59. Cf. the Seleucid coins in Babelon, op. cit., pp. 166-69, nos. 1291 etc.; 1302 etc., pl. XXIII, 5, 10(Alexandria II Zabina); p. 177, no. 1367, pl. XXIV, 9(Antiochus VIII and Cleopatra); S. Ben-Dor, PEQ (1948), p. 62 (Antiochus VII) and also cf. two coins of Gaza, Hill, BMC-Palestine, p. 143, pl. XV, 1, 2. 60. The inscription is not very wisely arranged. It surrounds the emblem instead of being arranged in vertical lines on its sides (as on the Seleucid coins mentioned in note 59). Such an improvement is seen on the related lily-palm-branch coins (reference in note 57). 61. The simultaneous minting of the lily-palm-branch and the wreathed inscription- spreading cornucopiae series is quite possible, since these two series are of a different denomination. The first is of half-peruta (=lepton) and the second of peruta (=dilep- ton). The helmet-cornucopiae series is of greater denomination (trilepton) and was discontinued. This lends additional argument to our contention that this series was the first to be minted under the Hasmoneans.</page><page sequence="15">URIEL RAPPAPORT 185 -H Here we terminate our discussion. Additional arguments may be ad- duced in support of the old, generally accepted, opinion that Hasmonean coinage began not later than under J. H. I. It may be noted, e.g., that to begin Hasmonean coinage with Janneus would result in a strange se- quence of the linguistic aspect of the legends. Bilingual, or even trilingual, under Janneus; unilingual under Aristobulus II and J.H. II (why?!) and again bilingual under Mattathias-Antigonus.62 However it seems to us that the amount and weight of the above considerations suffice to allow the fixing of the commencement of Hasmonean coinage in the time of J.H. I. POSTSCRIPT After this article was sent to the press, I saw R. S. Hanson's "Toward a Chronology of Hasmonean Coinage," BASOR, 216(Dec., 1974), 21-23, which attempts to advance some arguments in favor of Y. Meshorer's theory, mentioned above. In my opinion, the date and the arguments adduced there are far from conclusive and may be explained at least as well by our hypotheses as by Meshorer's theory. We would agree with Hanson about "the paleographical evidence, as unsteady as it can be in the minute and often ill-executed scripts found on coins" (ibid., p. 21) and would avoid conclusions from it at this stage. As for his other considerations, they seem untenable to us. The large propor- tion of Janneus' coins on the sites of Khirbet Shema and Meiron is to be expected (cf. note 43 above), whereas the few Yehoh.anan coins may be considered as part of the currency in Janneus' time (naturally they did not disappear with J.H. I's death). We cannot agree that Queen Alexandra "after the death of her husband, continued his final series of coins in the name of his successor" (ibid., p. 22). We would rather think it quite feasible that when Janneus himself, or his suc- 62. This and other difficulties are easily overcome with the traditional attribution of these coins. We do not agree with the opinion of M. Krupp, that Hasmonean coins first bear Aramaic legends and only later Hebrew legends (op. cit., p. 135). We also reject his dating of Janneus' dated coins at some other date than his twenty-fifth regnal year (ibid., pp. 134-35), as well as some other of his arguments and conclusions.</page><page sequence="16">186 EMERGENCE OF HASMONEAN COINAGE cessor (Shelomzion-Alexandra, not J.H. II, at that time), gave up his royal coinage (Yehonathan HaMelekh), they replaced it by Yehon- athan (or Yonathan) HaKohen HaGadol, etc., imitating the J.H. I series of HaKohen HaGadol, etc. In any event, we think that the pos- sibility of posthumous coins of Janneus is very likely and surely de- serves a detailed examination.</page></plain_text>
