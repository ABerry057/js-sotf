He also was a prolific writer who authored books on the Bible, Jewish history, theology, and Christian origins, in addition to several novels. All of this while he served in the pulpit for fifty-four years, first in Albany and then in Cincinnati, where he was the rabbi of Congregation Bnai Jeshurun for the last forty-six years of his life. It is little wonder, then, that there is a considerable literature concerning Wise, including several full-length biographies. Much of the biographical literature, however, is highly laudatory, some almost worshipful. In the present study, Sefton Temkin has provided us with a much-needed critical and balanced portrayal of Wise. Wise's long career was marked by much controversy, and scholars have differed in their assessments of the man and his accomplishments. One of the central questions in evaluating Wise, a question that Temkin deals with extensively, is whether Wise was a moderate or a radical reformer. Most scholars who have dealt with Wise have characterized him as a moderate reformer in contrast to the more radical east coast reformers like David Einhorn and Samuel Hirsch. Cited as proof are his insistence on maintaining the Saturday Sabbath, the retention of a large core of Hebrew prayer in the service, his belief in Divine revelation and the Mosaic authorship of the Torah (or most of it), and his acquiescence in the statement issued by the 1855 Cleveland Conference asserting the authority of the talmudic interpretation of the Bible. Even the prayerbook that he and Max Lilienthal edited, Minhag America, retained much of the traditional service. A revisionist view most forcefully expressed by Aryeh Rubinstein sees Wise as a radical who differed from Einhorn and the easterners only on the pace but not the substance of reform. Temkin takes a middle course and describes Wise as an ambivalent conservative reformer. This seems to be based on Wise's position on Hebrew in the prayer service, the Saturday Sabbath, his belief in the Sinaitic revelation and rejection of biblical criticism, the moderate changes in Minhag America, plus Wise's emotional attachment to tradition that occasionally came to the surface. Still, even accounting for all of this, Wise's position discarding the second day of festivals and circumcision for male converts, not requiring a religious divorce, ridiculing, if not rejecting, the dietary laws, and the apparent denial of belief in a personal God leave one wondering if "conservative reformer" is really an apt characterization of Wise.</page><page sequence="3">286 BOOK REVIEWS What makes Wise so difficult to pinpoint is his inconsistency. At the Cleveland Conference, he seemed to accept the authority of the Talmud. At other times, he rejected that position. The Pittsburgh Platform of 1885 contradicted positions that he had espoused time after time. It rejected the Sinaitic revelation and most of the Mosaic legislation, asserting that the laws of the Torah were to be judged according to "the views and habits of modern civilization," and it relegated talmudic law to the realm of the past. Wise responded to criticism of the Pittsburgh Platform and his support of it by evasion. Ignoring the Platform's acceptance of biblical criticism, which he rejected, Wise instead noted that the Platform did not deal with practical matters. It did not press for transferring the Sabbath to Sunday or for abolishing ritual circumcision. Temkin theorizes that Wise sensed the changes that were occurring at the time. The threat posed by Jewish defections to Felix Adler's Ethical Culture movement alarmed the reformers. Wise concurred with Kaufmann Kohler, the architect of the Pittsburgh Platform, that reform had to articulate a clearly liberal stance to complete with the new ideology. Always the pragmatist, Wise was willing to accommodate. It was a case of Cleveland in reverse. There Wise accepted the statement on talmudic authority in order to accommodate the traditionalists. At Pittsburgh he went along with the radicals. Other examples of Wise's inconsistency abound. While he generally favored the convening of a rabbinic synod to standardize American Jewish religious practice, he also criticized the idea as an authoritarian intrusion on the right of individual congregations to determine their own ritual practices. Throughout his career, Wise fought against Christian missionaries who sought to convert Jews and against attempts to Christianize the federal Constitution. Yet, he opposed a resolution of the Board of Delegates in 1870 to combat attempts to Christianize the Constitution,. One of his goals was the estab- lishment of a college to train teachers and rabbis. However, he opposed the short-lived Maimonides College, referring to it as a "Polish Cheder in a modernized garb." Wise's inconsistencies have been interpreted either as unprincipled op- portunism combined with uncontrolled egoism which prevented him from joining any Jewish cause in which he was not the leader, or as a willingness to compromise in order to attain a higher goal. Temkin accepts the latter view as an explanation of most of Wise's inconsistencies. Wise was driven by a desire to unify American Jewry with himself as its leader. He hoped that his</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 287 Minhag America would both unify American Jewry and gain him recognition as its unchallenged leader. There is a constancy in his advocacy of union, i.e., the creation of an organization that would unite the various congregations throughout the country, and in his campaign to establish a college. While he blew hot and cold on the synod, union and college remained fixed goals. These he pushed constantly in the pages of his newspapers and in the numerous lecture trips throughout the country that he undertook. To attain these goals he was willing to accommodate both those to his ideological left as well as those to his right. Temkin considers Wise's most important contribution to be his effort to create an "American" Judaism, a Judaism that conformed both to the spirit of America as well as to the conditions of life there. He adamantly opposed those reformers who wanted to preserve German as the language of reform in America. For Wise, America was the natural setting for the flowering of a modernized liberal Judaism. Like some other of his reform colleagues, he identified American ideals with Judaism. At one point, at least, he even believed that the teachings of Judaism would become the common property of America. This optimism and religious triumphalism may also be seen in his connection with the Free Religious Association, a group of liberal Unitarians headed by Octavius B. Frothingham. After Felix Adler succeeded Frothing- ham as head of the organization in 1878, Wise withdrew. Temkin writes that Wise could no longer affiliate with an organization headed by Adler, whom he viewed as a renegade. However, it may be that Wise's withdrawal was symptomatic of a larger disillusionment that he was undergoing. His experience with liberal Christians had been disappointing. He believed that liberal Protestants who had discarded much of traditional Christian doctrine were returning to the Jewish roots of Christianity, and that liberal Christianity would eventually merge into Judaism. However, as Wise learned, liberal Protestants continued to view Jesus as a special figure and Christianity as the fulfillment of Judaism. From their perspective, if liberal Christianity and liberal Judaism were to merge, it was Judaism that was going to have to make the move. The 1880s and 1890s brought other problems that seem to have tempered Wise's optimism. The increasing immigration of Jews from Eastern Europe began to change the face of the American Judaism that Wise had striven to create. His attitude toward the newcomers was the mixture of humanitarian concern and disdain for their unkempt orthodoxy that was</page><page sequence="5">288 BOOK REVIEWS common among the established German Jews in America. In addition, the rising tide of antisemitism in America in the 1890s must have given Wise cause to ponder whether his optimism was overreaching reality. Temkin's book is the best scholarly work on Wise to date. It presents an admiring yet critical picture of Wise's achievements and personality. Wise was a complex and explosive mixture of optimism and supreme self-confidence; he was bombastic in self-praise and highly combative against his critics. On the other hand, there were times when he expressed self-doubt, self-pity, and depression. Temkin leads us through the full range of Wise's emotional makeup and at times conjectures how it may have affected Wise's actions. Temkin's book would be strengthened had he dealt more extensively with Wise's attitude toward Christianity and his relations with liberal Protestants. Much of Wise's writing deals with Christianity, and defining the relationship between the two religions was important to him in formulating his American Judaism. Temkin might also have added a section to the Bibliographical Note dealing with the major secondary material on Wise. Wise was the central figure of nineteenth-century American Jewry. Temkin's nuanced portrayal is a welcome contribution to our understanding of the man and his times. George L. Berlin Baltimore Hebrew University Baltimore, Md.</page></plain_text>
