<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kadya Molodowsky. Paper Bridges: Selected Poems. Translated, introduced, and edited by Kathryn Hellerstein. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1999. 543 pp. In recent years there has been much interest in the place of Kadya Molo- dowsky in the canon of Yiddish literature. At the same time, the translation of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Yiddish literature has become an impera- tive-fueled by the Holocaust, the quality and quantity of writing that occurred prior to and even after it, and a heightened awareness of many women writers heretofore underrepresented in translation. Nor can one ignore the tremendous fluctuations in the perceived viability and legitimacy of Yiddish, as either a lan- guage or a literary vehicle, that have taken place and are still taking place into the twenty-first century. Into this tumultuous set of circumstances, Molodowsky's po- etry has been reborn by virtue of an extensive translation. Kathryn Hellerstein's translation of Molodowsky's selected poetry ably demonstrates one reason she has been canonized: Even the most chauvinistic or politicized of her contemporary male colleagues recognized that she was "a nat- ural poet" with things of consequence to say. Another reason Molodowsky is being canonized is more complex, since her poetry (and life) reveal a purposeful but anguished careening back and forth. She was the traditional Jewish woman imbued with biblical and rabbinical allusions, attitudes, and constraints, but she was also a socially-conscious political activist. She was a sophisticated early childhood educator, yet she was drawn to a more lyric and personal aesthetic. She had a depressed view of her right to be a poet during and after the Holocaust, but it was a period of intense interest in Zionism for her. 180</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews For a while she was unable to write at all, but she produced memorable children's po- etry. By her tenacious hold on her Jewish identity and her efforts to become a mod- em woman writer, she tempts us to see her as an iconic writer. Indeed she is that most iconic of all Jews, a "survivor," in the sense that her will to write persisted and matured through good, bad, and worse times: in Bereza Kartuska in Grodno Province; in the Paleof Settlement of the Russian Empire, where she was born in 1894; in Warsaw, Kiev; back home; again in Warsaw; pre- cipitously in 1935 to Philadelphia and then New York; in Israel; and back in New York. Hellerstein makes a strong case for Molodowsky's ability to remain artisti- cally and psychically intact despite geographic, political, and personal upheavals. What happens to a world-class poet when iconic status is bestowed on him or her? Might it affect what is selected of their work to translate? Does it limit or simplify the perception of complexity in the writer's voice? Can it detract from an understanding of that writer's place in the larger canon of world literature? I read the undertext of desperation and despair in many of Molodowsky's po- ems as a struggle to come to terms with her fear that her suffering is punishment for the "sin" of abandoning more traditional mores. Additionally, many of her po- ems dwell upon thwarted efforts to construct her identity as The Poet. Thus I am persuaded that her own absorption with these issues both sustained and maimed her poetic potential. Whether she is the perfect icon or not, the reader will find the book com- pelling precisely because it is haunted by this issue. Molodowsky plays out the of- ten tragic tension between Socialism and Zionism, between Yiddish and Hebrew, between Europe and America, between post-Holocaust traditionalism and the self, in poem after poem. One wonders where her "take" on the current bifurcations in Jewish life, and the general state of affairs in the world, would have led her poeti- cally were she alive today! The wonderfully appropriate title of the book, Paper Bridges, has been in- spired by three separate poems containing that phrase-one published in the 1930s in Poland, another in the 1940s in New York, and the last in the 1960s in Buenos Aires. The second was even published by "The Paper Bridge Press." Obviously the legend that when the Messiah comes Jews will cross into Paradise over a paper bridge had deep symbolic meaning for Molodowsky. However, the differences in the three poems are compelling in light of the above comments. In the first, titled "My Paper Bridge," the bridge leads Molodowsky back to halcyon times. (Indeed, in villages such as Bereza Kartuska, the road out into the fields did appear to meet and merge with the sky at the end of the shtetl.) But the poet encounters the poverty and despair of the Jewish condition in those times in the person of a homeless woman with whom she is forced to contend and with whom she in a sense merges or identifies. In the second, titled "A Poem to the Paper Bridge," there is a post-Holocaust recognition of the endurance of the Jewish people, and hopes for manna in the desert and the dawn of a new day. Nevertheless, it is a bittersweet poem. The third poem, "On the Paper Bridge," dances tauntingly, teasingly, back and forth between dutifulness and capriciousness, between her calling to write and the call of"women's work" and the world's work. In the end, she tries to resolve 181</page><page sequence="3">AJS Review this fundamental conflict in her life and work by using the learned metaphor of "Nutrikin" (or Notarikon), the mystical technique of interpreting letters of one word as initials of other words-i.e., by being a writer. This theme is further poignantly elaborated in poems such as "A Poem About Self" and "Leave Taking." Of course, her ability to turn one metaphor over and over so differently is a trib- ute to her talents. Hellerstein's fine introduction fleshes out Molodowsky's biography, simul- taneously sketching out the complexities of a life in many ways emblematic of the whole of Jewish cultural, political, and linguistic history in the twentieth century. Her extensive endnotes provide readers with much food for thought. They are both scholarly and remarkably honest commentaries on the challenges and choices faced in translating a language as linguistically infused as Yiddish. Wayne State University Press, long the publisher of a diverse ethnic cata- logue, is to be commended for not stinting on the supportive material Hellerstein wished to include; they have created both hard and soft cover editions beautifully bound, illustrated, and papered. Hellerstein's translation style calls up some important issues, solves them with a consistent and deliberate aesthetic, and successfully provides readers with great access to Molodowsky's poetry. We want translators to "understand" their au- thors; she does. Mindful of Molodowsky's generous use of rhyme, Hellerstein allows herself rather free rendering of these, particularly in the children's tales, but less so in her more symbolic or visionary poetry. Some translators tend to sacrifice rhyme for other qualities. By and large Hellerstein is not willing to. Differences in the typi- cal metrical foot in Yiddish versus that in English also color her translations. Yiddish has no capitalization; it often uses the convention of beginning a line with "and." In normal discourse the verb must be in second place. Hellerstein usu- ally chooses to opt out of this pattern, which can sometimes change the semantic emphasis in a line. Hellerstein sometimes chooses the present participle when Yid- dish gives her the option of the simple present tense as well. This is one of those nuances that poets know can subtly affect the impact or sense of immediacy of what is written. Hellerstein chooses to capitalize the first letter of each line. Most- ly her punctuation end-stops lines. True, this is characteristic of an older/and or more formalistic poetry, but it can rein in the emotional intensity of a poem in En- glish. Much has already been written about the hazards of gerunds in English, and about the choice between Latinate and more Anglo-Saxon synonyms. For exam- ple, in one poem Hellerstein chooses the word "primordial" over "ancient," possi- bly out of respect for its biblical undertones. English quantifies its nouns-a bunch of, a group of, etc.-this is not as typical in Yiddish. On the other hand, Yiddish has gender markers that can make for a certain cumbersomeness in English or create the alternative temptation of condensation. Erudite and extensive as Hellerstein's book is, it cannot be expected to fully explore the modernist movement in Yiddish poetry, nor to provide the full story of Molodowsky's relationship with other great Jewish writers of her time on both sides of the Atlantic. It cannot possibly explore the full implications of Birobid- 182</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews jhan in one of her poems. About her relationship with her husband and his politics much has been left unsaid. What the book will do is impel the reader to discover many other noteworthy Yiddish poets and prose writers now available in translation. They are from times and places when to write, think, and dream in Yiddish was to be a Jew. After all, it was that anguished Jewish poet Paul Celan who said, "Only one thing remained reachable, close and secure amid all losses: language....
