<plain_text><page sequence="1">Basil Herring. Joseph Ibn Kaspi's "Gevia' Kesef" New York: Ktav Publish- ing House, 1982, 303 pp. + 45 pp. (Hebrew text) Joseph Ibn Caspi (Kaspi) was a rather prolific writer who lived in southern France and northern Spain in the fourteenth century. As a part of the medieval Jewish Aristotelian tradition he wrote many books, including commentaries on most of the books of the Bible, summaries of Plato and Aristotle (from Averroes), commentaries to the Guide, and more. Many of Caspi's works were published at the beginning of this century by Isaac Last. His commentary on the Guide had already been published by S. Werbluner, as had his IKevu;at Kesef by Renan-Neubauer. Among the works un-</page><page sequence="2">242 BOOK REVIEWS published was a work called Gevia' Kesef found in a Turin manuscript of which Last was unaware. Basil Herring has provided us with an edition of the Gevia' Kesef taken almost entirely from MS Turin (a fragment of the book found in a Munich manuscript was consulted, but a manuscript appar- ently in the Guenzberg Collection in Moscow was inaccessible). Besides the text of the book, Herring has given us an annotated English translation along with an extended introduction to the life and works of Caspi. In this introduction there are chapters on Caspi's life and writings, his exegesis, his treatment of the names of God in Scripture, and his treatment of miracles in the Bible. In the introduction to Gevia' Kesef, Caspi says that "the intention of this work is to write whatever I can regarding the secrets of the Torah that I did not see fit to write in the MaSref la-Kesef Tirat Kesef, Mizrak Kesef and Menorat Kesef' (p. 135). Herring shows that there is an intimate relation- ship between this book and another book by Caspi called Kesef Siggim which Caspi describes as "one hundred and ten profound questions worthy of consideration from the Pentateuch and the Prophets."' At the beginning of chapter 6 of Gevia' Kesef Caspi says, "What is written in this work up to this point, as well as what is written in Mizrak Kesefand Menorat Kesef has resolved the first sixteen questions that we enumerated in Kesef Sigim. Therefore I will now proceed to solve the others, one at a time" (p. 157). At the end of Gevia' Kesef he says, "With this, the questions that I wrote that appertain to the Book of Genesis have been completed" (p. 276). In his notes, Herring tries to reconstruct some of the questions from this book, which is not extant, and these reconstructions are quite helpful. It would have been useful for Herring to have tried to put together all of the questions he was able to reconstruct in an appendix so that we could get an idea of the contents of at least the first part of Kesef Siggim. Another issue relating to the text of Gevia' Kesef is whether or not MS Turin is itself a part of a larger work, as originally promised by Caspi in IKevugat Kesef or is complete in itself as an elucidation of philosophic prob- lems in the Book of Genesis. Herring argues that our text of Gevia' Kesefis complete. His argument is based on a number of factors the most important of which is that most of the references to Gevia' Kesefin Caspi's other works can be located in MS Turin. However, there are a number of references that cannot be found there. Perhaps Caspi intended to write a book which dealt 1. In Kevu;at Kesef See B.

Herring has already shown that Gevia' Kesef was written toward the end of Caspi's life. It might well be that he ran out of time. At any rate, it seems to me that the question of the completeness of Gevia' Kesefis still open. Herring himself refers to his conclusions as tentative. The Hebrew text is presented in a most felicitous manner, although the critical apparatus is rather meager, since the majority of the manuscript is available in only one recension. The translation is accurate and the notes are helpful. The long introductory section provides much useful analysis of some of the basic themes of Caspi's writings. Herring's first chapter, "Kaspi's Life, Works, and Background," is generally well done, bringing up to date the earlier works on the subject.2 Caspi was a rather controversial figure in his day and found antagonists both among philosophers and among traditiona- lists who thought he was revealing too much of the esoteric meaning of the Bible. Caspi showed great disdain for the masses, who never showed him much respect, but Herring neglects the fact that he also derided and mocked the rabbis and "pseudo-philosophers" who castigated him for delving into the mysteries of the Scripture. Caspi also tended to use terms like "my sons" and "my son" in his writings. Herring says that he began this practice after Kalonymos wrote his refutation of Caspi's Tirat Kesef, thereby addressing "himself in his works to his children, convinced that they alone could appre- ciate his writings" (p. 10). This is difficult to accept, since Caspi had already used these expressions in Tirat Kesef, and Kalonymos himself criticizes Caspi for referring to his readers in these terms.3 In the second chapter Herring examines Caspi's methodology as a bibli- cal exegete. At the beginning of this chapter Herring says that Caspi is accused of not adding "significantly to our understanding of the plain mean- ing of Scripture" and that the purpose of the present chapter is to examine this evaluation. Herring presents an excellent analysis of Caspi's methodo- logy but never really offers an evaluation. It seems that he wants to claim 2. See especially I.

From a close reading of this chapter it is not at all clear that he has achieved his goal. His chapter "The Names of God in Scripture" is very good. He shows that Caspi's attempt to offer an analysis of why the names of God change in the early chapters of Genesis is probably in response to Abner of Burgos, the famous Jewish convert of the fourteenth century, who in Teshuvot la- Meharef(not Melbares) places a good deal of emphasis on his own interpre- tation of the names of God. This would go a long way in helping us under- stand Caspi's interest in Jewish-Christian polemics in his later writings. Still, one leaves the chapter with the sense that something is missing. We have not been given an overarching synthetic approach to the material which would give us some insights into Caspi's general approach to the nature of God. Herring's treatment of Caspi's view of miracles is also quite interesting. He points out that Caspi distinguished between two categories of miracles: those that he calls "naturally possible" and those that are "impossible" (nimna'im). The problem here is whether or not Caspi, as a radical inter- preter of Maimonides, believed that truly "impossible" miracles, that is, supernatural events which interfere with the normal course of nature, can occur. Herring shows that there are two kinds of impossibility: logically impossible and naturally impossible. For Caspi, according to Herring, "even God cannot change the former class of impossibles, whereas He can and does temporarily change natural laws, thereby achieving what is impos- sible for man to effect" (p. 107). Most of the miracles in the Bible are actual- ly in the first category mentioned above ("naturally possible"), and Caspi spends a good deal of time offering extended exegesis of biblical passages concerning miracles to show that they belong to this first category. However, Caspi also claims that there are some miracles which do belong to the second class ("naturally impossible"). The fundamental question is, What miracles fall into this latter category, and how do they function? Her- ring shows that Caspi's position on this question is influenced by Ibn Ezra and Avicenna and Averroes, who argue that the prophet, when he achieves union with the Active Intellect, is able to "change or suspend natural laws so as to produce miracles" (p. 110). Caspi claims that Moses, having achieved this state of conjunction, was able to exert a certain power on the four elements and thereby produce miracles. It was this view that was challenged by Kalonymos in his refutation of Caspi. In his discussion of these issues Herring would have been helped by two recent works which appeared after</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 245 the publication of his book: "Theories of Prophecy in Medieval Jewish Philosophy" by Howard Kreisel (Brandeis University diss., 1980) and "The Anthropological Theory of Miracles in Medieval Jewish Philosophy" by A. Ravitzky (Heb.), in Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 2 (1982/83): 323-362. These works pay careful attention to the role of the prophet in the performance of miracles. Another problem lies in the fact that Caspi is very hard to pin down as to what exactly qualifies as a miracle of the second type. When referring to this second type he sometimes says "impossible or barely possible" (nimna' 'o 'efshari rahbok), which then does not seem to refer to authentically super- natural events. In one place Caspi says that one should not make a distinc- tion between the three Hebrew terms for "miracle" ('ot, mofet, pele'),4 and in another he makes a clear distinction between the three, claiming there that pele' refers to the category of the "impossible or barely possible."5 Herring refers to a number of cases where Caspi apparently interprets the events as miracles of the second type, but Caspi himself seems somewhat confused by these cases. Even though he seems to want to include them as instances of the second category, he is not comfortable with his interpretation (see esp. his discussion of the First Plague).6 Herring's interpretation of Caspi on miracles helps us unravel this complex question, but it seems to make Caspi's views clearer and more coherent than they actually are. All in all, the presentation of the heretofore unpublished work Gevia' Kesef along with a good annotated translation is a welcome addition to the developing literature of post-Maimonidean philosophy and exegesis. The introductory chapters, with some reservations, provide helpful discussions of Caspi and his place in medieval Jewish thought and exegesis. Barry Mesch University of Florida Gainesville, Fla. 4.
