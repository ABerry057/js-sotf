Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2007. x, 292 pp. doi: 10.1017/S036400940800144X Matthew Hoffman's From Rebel to Rabbi is a detailed exploration of the figure of Jesus in modern Jewish literature and art. Hoffman's main argument is that modernity, enlightenment, and religious reform changed Jewish perceptions of Jesus and that, reciprocally, these new views of Jesus played an important role in shaping Jewish identity in modern times. The reclamation of Jesus has been driven both by the inner need to construct a new understanding of Jewish identity and by its external value in reconciling the Jewish and Christian worlds. Hoffman demonstrates his thesis in a convincing, lucid, and engaging manner. The first chapter of the book reviews the "Quest for the Jewish Jesus" in Western Europe and America, from Moses Mendelssohn and the Berlin Haska lah to early twentieth-century Jewish historiography and Reform theology. Hoffman presents a detailed and informed summary of the strategies by which Jewish intellectuals incorporated Jesus in a positive way into their works, and he provides a good survey of prior research in the field, with the exception of omit ting Eugene (Yaacov) Fleishman's work.1 Chapter 2, in which Hoffman distinguishes between the Eastern and Western European Jewish relationship to Jesus, is an important and unique contribution to 1.

Hoffman argues that unlike Reform rabbis and modern scholars living in liberal democracies, Russian Jews were more exposed to political and popular antisemitism. As a result, a tension grew between "the attrac tion of liberal, intellectual trends of tolerance, social justice and universal brother hood, and the strongly particularistic needs of the Jewish people in Russia and its struggle for national survival and equal rights" (64). Hoffman mentions two other factors that set Eastern European Jewish intellectuals apart from most of their Western European counterparts: Russian Jewish nationalism, specifically Zionism, and the fact that in the East, the languages in use were mainly Hebrew and Yiddish?and therefore, as he rightly points out, the discourse on Jesus should be viewed as internal to the Jewish world. Hoffman illustrates these ten sions by focusing on two debates within Jewish intellectual circles on the status of Jesus and Christianity in modern Jewish life: one between Chaim Zhitlovsly and S. Ansky, and the other between Ahad Ha-Am and Yosef Chaim Brenner. These controversies came to be known as di zeylem frage, "the Crucifix Ques tion," and me 'ora ' Brenner, the "Brenner Affair," respectively. In my view, the strongest portion of the book is its third chapter, which deals with Yiddish modernism and its relation to Jesus. Hoffman insightfully analyzes works by writers such as Asch, Shapiro, Greenberg, Ravitsh, Halpern, Horovitz, Leyvik, and Manger. His main argument is that these Yiddish writers formed what he calls a "landscape of the cross," a virtual subgenre in which each author represents Jesus in accordance with his particular ideological or poetic vision. Each depicts his own version of Jesus, while at the same time creating a "new home for him in the emerging canon of secular Jewish culture" (169). In the fourth chapter, Hoffman focuses on the centrality of one particular theme: the suffering of Jesus as a Jewish martyr in Jewish historiography, theol ogy, literature, and art. The crucifixion stands at the center of many of these works. Hoffman creatively analyzes their representation of Jesus as both Jewish victim and god of the victimizers. It is surely impossible to incorporate in a discus sion of this scope each and every work that deals with the theme, but I specifically missed Greenberg's very famous poem, Uri Zvifarn zeylem INRI (Uri Zvi in Front of the Cross INRI), which is typographically arranged in the shape of the cross. Mention of this poem would also have been helpful in Chapter 5, which deals with figurations of Jesus and other Christian motifs in the work of Marc Chagall. The analysis of two of Chagall's works in particular?White Crucifixion (1938) and In Front of the Picture (1968-71)?would have benefited from such a comparison. But what is crucially missing from Hoffman's discussion is treatment of Modern Hebrew literature and its relation to Jesus. Hoffman explains this choice by arguing that, in distinction to modern Yiddish writing, there is no "wide spread proliferation of Christian symbolism and the image of Jesus" in modern Hebrew literature (266-67 n. 2). Hoffman's suggestion is not only mistaken (although unfortunately common) but also leads him to miss a whole corpus that could have supplemented and even reinforced his main argument. For Hebrew writers such as Avraham Shlonsky, Natan Bistritsky, Aahron Kabak, Haim Hazaz, and Avidgor Ha-Meiri, the figure of Jesus offered a broad range of symbols that articulated contemporary nationalist and messianic points of 458</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews view. At the same time, they perceived Jesus as the "other," the menacing god of the Christians. This ambivalent approach gave rise to a mode of representation characterized by the literary device of multiple perspectives. These early twentieth-century writers avoided taking a stand in the debate over the veracity of the Christian Gospels and Jesus' metaphysical nature, limiting themselves to presenting various voices that recount aspects of the Jesus myth. This polyphony of sometimes inconsistent versions of the Jesus story presents the reader with a Jesus who is more of a social and cultural construct than a real historical figure. A good example of this mode of representation is found in the first Hebrew play about Jesus, Jesus from Nazareth (Yeshu'a mi-Nazeret), written in 1921 by Natan Bistritzky, a Zionist activist and the editor of a number of modern Hebrew literary journals. In this play, the figure of Jesus appears almost entirely as mediated through the other characters?those who accompany Jesus in the last year of his life. Each of them constructs Jesus' character according to his own ideological agenda. Through this technique Bistritzky reveals different trends and ideologies characteristic of Second Temple-era Judaism but leaves the image of Jesus vague, revealing the weakness of the firsthand or eyewitness story. Hoffman's thesis might also have benefited from discussion of some of the stories of the Nobel Laureate S. Y Agnon, which criticize from within some of the very trends addressed here (see, e.g., "Ma'agelei zedek" [Cycles of Justice, 1923], "Nifla'ot shamash beit ha-midrash ha-yashan" [The Wonders of the Caretaker of the Old Study Hall, 1925], and "Ha-'adonit ve-ha-rochel" [The Lady and the Peddler, 1943]). An exploration of modern Hebrew literature could also have prevented Hoffman's inaccurate claim that after World War II, and as a result of the Holo caust, the Jewish fascination with the figure of Jesus "faded [as] the climate was no longer deemed appropriate" (255). In fact, in works that were written after the Holocaust and the attainment of Israeli statehood?by Israeli writers such as Pinchas Sadeh, Nathan Zach, Yehuda Amichai, Dalia Rabikowicz, Yona Wallach, Meir Wieseltier, Yitzhak Laor, Yoel Hoffmann, and Avot Yeshurun? Jesus' suffering is a dominant theme, while the traditional antagonism between Jesus and the Jews is strongly suppressed. Moreover, in a shift typical of contem porary Israeli discourse on Jesus, one that reflects broader cultural tendencies in contemporary Israel, the figure of Jesus as Other is dislocated, or, perhaps, repa triated, to Europe. The very same Europe that Greenberg called "The Kingdom of the Cross" (Malchusfon zeylem) now entices a young generation of Israeli writers who see in Jesus a representative of an attractive and remote culture. In contem porary Israeli poetry, Jesus is frequently conceived neither in the historical context of the relationship between Judaism and Christianity nor in his religious role but as a representative of an aesthetic world that gains its attractiveness from the fact that it is different and distant from anything associated with the old Jewish Self. Europe, now symbolically empty of Jews, is an attractive place for young Israeli writers who seek to become part of a non-Jewish culture in which Jesus plays a central role. These lacunae notwithstanding, Hoffman argues successfully throughout the book that the Jewish reclamation of Jesus has permeated all forms of 459</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews modern Jewish culture. His lucid and engaging portrayal of the various manners in which the figure of Jesus has been employed in the creation of a modern, secular, Jewish culture is an important contribution to contemporary scholarship on modern Jewish intellectual history.
