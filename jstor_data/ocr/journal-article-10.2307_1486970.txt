New York: Columbia Uni- versity Press, 1990. x, 276 pp. Abundance is not a word generally associated with East European Jewish immigrants. Most historical accounts, including Irving Howe's World of Our Fathers, emphasize the hardships associated with immigration: the poverty, congestion, disease, and hunger that many immigrants experi-</page><page sequence="2">346 BOOK REVIEWS enced during their first years on American soil. In this volume, however, Andrew Heinze argues that abundance too played a formative role in immi- grant Jewish life. When eastern European Jews arrived in America, they encountered not only a host of new products but a new perspective that was intimately related to the fact of material abundance. In adopting the American standard of living, they would inevitably be adapting to a characteristically American attitude. As consumers, then, they would lay the foundation of an American identity. (p. 42) Heinze focuses on the "culture of consumption" in the American Jewish immigrant community. His best chapters cover such usually neglected sub- jects as clothing, leisure, "the parlor and the piano," and American advertis- ing in the Yiddish press. In another chapter, he reinterprets the role of the Jewish woman from this perspective, arguing that she was, as a baleboste, the "manager of domestic consumption." Patterns of consumption also serve, according to Heinze, to distinguish Jews from Gentiles, and immi- grants from those who stayed behind in Europe. Heinze concedes from the outset that "some rough edges have inevitably been smoothed out" in his analysis. He contends, I think wrongly, that "whereas the experience of human beings is full of contradictions and ambi- guity, the task of historical analysis demands passionate and almost single- minded attention to one focal point of life" (p. 13). Single-factor analysis, however, is fraught with problems, and some emerge here. The chapters on American Jewish religious life, for example, argue that material abundance contributed to the decline of Jewish Sabbath observance. Whereas in Eur- ope, Sabbath observance had been reinforced by "the selective use of luxur- ies," Heinze claims that in America, "where luxuries were routinely trans- formed into necessities, material objects ceased to serve this spiritual purpose ... the lure of consumption hastened the decline of traditional Judaism, which culminated in the conversion of the Sabbath into a shopping day" (p. 220). One is hardpressed to accept this argument, although Heinze repeats it several times, for it was, in fact, the absence of abundance-the need to secure a job in an environment where Sabbath meant Sunday and everyone worked a six-day week-that did more than anything else to destroy Sabbath observance among immigrants. Moreover, material objects never ceased to serve spiritual purposes among American Jews; old luxuries</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 347 were simply replaced by newer and more expensive ones-witness the con- temporary renaissance of Jewish ritual art. In some cases, abundance actual- ly made possible a significant strengthening of Jewish religious life, partic- ularly in Orthodox circles. In other cases, displays of abundance themselves became a form of Jewish religious observance, particularly at times of cele- bration and in the rituals connected with philanthropy. Heinze stands on firmer ground in most of his other chapters, and there is no question but that he has enriched our understanding of America's impact on Jewish life. Significant questions remain, however, that one hopes that Heinze or some other scholar will take up. Thus, more attention needs to be paid to historical patterns of consumption among American Jews: what changed over time and what did not. We also need a more nuanced analysis of how abundance affected Jewish life: what it destroyed, what it transformed, what it democratized-and, in each case, why. Finally, we need to fit the themes that Heinze explicates into the larger framework of American Jewish social, economic, and cultural history. This will enable us both to see change over time (what happened, for example, during periods of economic decline?) and to relate consumption to other factors that- Heinze's singleminded focus notwithstanding-were simultaneously trans- forming American Jewish life, both from within and from without.
