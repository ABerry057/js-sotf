I even knew him when he was a liberal." That seemed like a long while ago. It certainly pre-dated Friedman's publication of The Neoconservative Revolu tion (2005), Commentary in American Life (2005), and What Went Wrong? The Cre ation and Collapse of the Black-Jewish Alliance (1995). It probably came before Friedman published New Perspectives on School Integration (1979), which evalu ated (rather sharply) his own earlier advocacy work in 1961 as part of a committee that wrote Philadelphia's first school desegregation program. Even Friedman's 1966 analysis of racial conflict in Philadelphia, Case Study of a Riot, must have differed considerably from the views of the young man who first entered Jewish organiz ational life as director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) office for Virginia and North Carolina, just as the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its Brown v. Board of Education ofTopeka decision in 1954. Friedman spent most of these for mative years with the ADL battling "separate but equal" segregation in the South, a cause he felt aligned to encountering antisemitism. When interviewing for the pos ition at Temple, I had the chance to ask Friedman about his "change" from liberal ism. He only repeated what his friend Irving Kristol had famously said, that a conservative is a liberal who has been mugged by reality. What went wrong? Why did Friedman and such a vocal portion of his liberal generation imagine it had been "mugged"? Friedman had no short list of lamenta tions: white flight from his beloved Philadelphia, a public arena increasingly characterized by vulgarity rather than civility, cultural identification downward instead of up, and, most shockingly to Friedman (a marine of World War II), out right America bashing. Like a latter-day Mr. Sammler, these issues churned within Friedman during his last years, and they animated his attempt in The Neoconser vative Revolution to categorize and defend an "alternate" political route for Amer ican Jewry, something different from the liberalism that he believed had failed him, his generation, his Jewish community, and America. As an alternative, he wanted to reclaim the "strand of conservative Jewish thought that has been little noticed" (3), a strand advocated by certain "apostates from liberalism" (7), himself included, who called themselves neoconservatives and who, to Friedman, generally followed the following principle: "As here used, conservatism denotes a body of thought that emphasizes the right of individ uals in society to pursue their own interests with as little government interference as possible. Socialism is seen as a failure, while capitalism, with all its faults, is cred ited with having provided for the material well-being and individual freedom of increasingly larger numbers of people, both in this country and abroad" (6). But here the attentive reader will immediately recognize a difficulty: Fried man's neoconservative position is "conservative" only as that term is used colloqui ally. Rather, Friedman's neoconservatives seem committed to liberal principles, often with almost mystical belief in the transformational possibilities of economic liberalism. In domestic politics, Friedman's neoconservatives imagine that political groups have been effectively superseded by a single political entity?the state? and that the state properly acts according to the wishes of a majority of individual citizens. In foreign policy, the neoconservatives are committed to bringing this liberal vision to the rest of the world. These laissez-faire emphases have very 404</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews little connection to traditionally conservative theories. Charles Liebman correctly understood conservative theory as being "ethnocentric rather than cosmopolitan" and as "folk-oriented."1 That is to say, unlike Friedman's accent on "individuals in society," conservative political theory typically recognizes the de facto power of groups, and it has sought to accommodate their presence within an encompass ing political system. Viewing Friedman's neoconservatives as paleoliberals, even as relics from an earlier enchantment with liberalism held by the Progressive left at the beginning of the century, goes a long way toward understanding the so-called change that Friedman felt. Friedman didn't change. The left changed. Kristol's quip about muggings less accurately captures the transformations of American politics than Ronald Reagan's excuse for why he finally switched political parties: "I didn't leave the Democratic Party," he said. "The party left me."2 For if there is one clear trend of the American left in the last half century, it is movement away from classic liberalism and the rule of a majority of individual citizens and toward newfound appreciations of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, and other "identity politics"?which is to say, group politics, even "folk politics." In light of this, I think Friedman's idea of a neoconservative revolution is inaccurate. There was certainly a revolution: It was away from liberalism, and it was conser vative?but it was activated and embodied by the left. The first occasion when one of Friedman's old liberals came to be con sidered "conservative" by continuing to act based on a political model already abandoned by the left occurred in the in the early summer of 1943, when Justice Robert H. Jackson overturned Justice Felix Frankfurter's U.S. Supreme Court Gobitis decision of three years earlier. In Friedman's view, Frankfurter was a "premature Jewish Neoconservative," who at this moment underwent a founding "transition" to conservatism. But I think matters occurred differently, and I will take the rest of my review to discuss this case in order to clarify the dif ficulty of Friedman's general analysis of the neoconservative phenomenon. The Gobitis case revolved around the expulsion of two children from a Penn sylvania school district for refusing to pledge allegiance to the American flag, a practice mandated by the school board but which the children's devout Jehovah's Witness parents believed to entail idolatry. Frankfurter had ruled for the Court that the school board's mandate was probably foolish, but it was constitutional insofar as it made no attempt to establish a state religion and had not been executed for the specific purpose of precluding religious practices (which is how previous Courts had understood the scope of the First Amendment). Therefore, liberal jurisprudence mandated judicial restraint. In the absence of a clear constitutional limitation, the citizenry had the right to enact legislation, code, and even inane school board 1. This was certainly Otto Von Gierke's position; see Gierke, Political Theories of the Middle Ages (Cambridge: University Press, 1913); and Charles Liebman, The Ambivalent Jew: Politics, Reli gion, and Family in American Jewish Life (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1973), 140-42. 2. http:/www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-reagan, 1,4780792.story?page=4&amp;coll=la-news obituaries&amp;ctrack=l&amp;cset=true.

The place for the wisdom of the school board to be judged was within due democratic processes in which all citizens could participate.3 Three years later, and after a significant amount of violence against Jehovah's Witnesses as a result of the publicity surrounding the case, Justice Jackson reversed Frankfurter's decision with language critical of the wisdom of the democratic process. The "majestic generalities" of the Bill of Rights had been "conceived as part of the pattern of liberal government in the eighteenth century," he wrote. "We must transplant these rights to a soil in which the laissez-faire concept or prin ciple of noninterference has withered at least as to economic affairs, and social advancements are increasingly sought through closer integration of society and through expanded and strengthened governmental controls."4 Jackson held that those recently "expanded and strengthened governmental controls" mandated an expanded and strengthened judiciary. Frankfurter began his dissent of the Barnette decision by noting his own empathy for the difficulties of minorities and their special reliance on constitutional liberties. He wrote, "One who belongs to the most vilified and persecuted minority in history is not likely to be insensible to the freedoms guaranteed by our Consti tution."5 Nevertheless, in a liberal democracy, minority groups are not above the rules established by the majority. Which is to say, to disregard the political rule of the majority in the name of differing minority viewpoints is to establish the political right of "identity" groups to circumvent the liberal democratic process. When Jackson reversed the earlier Gobitis decision and ignored the judicial restraint principle of liberal jurisprudence, in effect he inaugurated a period of judi cial activism and aggressive Court policies concerning the proper judicial purview of democratically enacted legislation. Frankfurter and his judicial restraint came to be seen as "conservative" forces in jurisprudence, a view that Frankfurter himself felt shocking and which, in any event, was untrue. Despite Frankfurter's personal minority status (as well as his belief in the foolishness of the legislation and codes in question), he had simply held fast to his trust in liberal principles and demo cratic processes. Jews in the first half of the past century almost devoutly shared Frankfurter's trust in liberalism, and liberalism served them well. It allowed Jews to ascend to the American middle class usually within a generation of their various immigra tions, and it also shepherded Jews into the body politic with a thoroughness nowhere else experienced in the Diaspora. How those liberal ideals came undone in the second half of the century, often by incorporating large doses of truly conservative politics (i.e., folk politics and identity politics), is another story. Suffice it to say that liberal ideals have served other minority groups less ably than they have American Jews, and Friedman and his neoconservative friends have never recognized this political reality. Still, Friedman's neoconserva tives continue to embody the once strongly held beliefs of American Jewry, while 3. Minersville School District v. Gobitis, 310 U.S. 586 (1940). 4.
