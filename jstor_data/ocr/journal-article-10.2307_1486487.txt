<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hyam Maccoby. Judas Iscariot and the Myth of Jewish Evil. New York: Free Press, 1992. ix, 213 pp. Hyam Maccoby is well known to those who study Judaism in the first centuries of the common era and the history of Jewish-Christian relations. The present book is a continuation of his work in the latter area. More specifically it grows out of his various works on Jesus and on Paul. As in many of his works on such subjects, Maccoby continues to write with a passion. He writes to stimulate the emotions of his readers and in doing so tends to stretch the bounds of scholarly credibility. There is no lack in Maccoby's knowledge of the scholarly literature and his ability to treat the sources. His problem lies in the fact that he insists on arriving at conclusions on difficult scholarly questions, whether the evidence is there or not. Maccoby's views will certainly stimulate the popular market. He argues that Judas Iscariot was Jesus' brother and may even have become the leader of the Jesus movement. He then argues that this fact was covered up by the Pauline Christians, who separated out a demonic Judas from the apostle Judas, not Iscariot, in several phases. Throughout history this demonic Judas</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 179 was increasingly degraded. In addition, the demonic Judas also came to be identified with the Jewish people. The development of the myth, however, should not be surprising, since it filled anthropological and psychological needs. In fact, Judas Iscariot became a necessary counterpart to the sacrifice of Christ on the cross (pp. 9, 41, 58). Maccoby admits that his case is built on a "considerable chain of circum- stantial evidence" and that some may complain that his process is "selective" (p. 160); but he responds that the same criticism might be applied "against any detective" who must build much from small clues. "We have to read between the lines in the documents" (p. 128). It was against such methodology that Henry Cadbury once warned a class at Harvard, when he stated, "In the area of Christian origins the three most important words for any scholar to learn are 'I don't know.'" This is a position that Maccoby rejects (p. 137). In doing detective work, one should be sure of the foundations, but there are several in this book that are open to question. The following are representative. Maccoby seems to accept the assumption of a "normative Judaism" (p. 16), and he is generally careless in his use of the words like "Gnostic" and "Messiah." In trying to prove that all the Judases named in the New Testament were a single person, he seems to forget that Judas was a very common Jewish name. Although there were many apostles who were not members of the Twelve, including Andronicus, a woman named Junia (Rom. 16:7), and Paul himself, Maccoby tends to equate the apostles with the Twelve. He builds much of his case on the assumption that with Judas gone, the Twelve should have been called the Eleven. What seems more likely is that twelve represented an idealized number, like the twelve tribes of Israel, the twelve laymen in the Qumran Community Council ('Asat haYahad), or one of the centuries in a Roman legion. In regard to Jewish Christianity and the Jerusalem Church, Maccoby claims to know far more than careful scholars find provable. As for the rest of the Church, Maccoby tends to lump them all together as Pauline, even the author of Luke-Acts (p. 50), who carefully avoids Paul's theology of the cross. Maccoby continually stresses the importance of the sacrifice on the cross in Paul and the early Church (pp. 8-9); yet sacrificial categories are of only minor importance for Paul's interpretation of Jesus' death. Aside from a few simple references to the blood of Christ, which may or may not have had a sacrificial connotation, and possible sacrificial allusions related to the Eucharist (1 Cor. 10:16, 11:23-26), the genuine epistles of Paul specifically call Jesus' death a sacrifice no more</page><page sequence="3">180 BOOK REVIEWS than twice and only in passing (1 Cor. 5:7 and perhaps Rom. 3:25). Paul can just as readily speak of the moral life as a sacrifice (Rom. 12:1). Apart from Paul, the only New Testament writer to stress a sacrificial aspect in Jesus' death is the author of Hebrews, but the theologian who really brought the sacrificial doctrine of the atonement to the fore was Anselm in the eleventh century. Maccoby seems to be reading modem Christian interpretations of Jesus' death back into Paul. In spite of these criticisms, there is much that is good in this work. For example, Maccoby's study of the title "Iscariot" is carefully laid out and treats all the theories in a reasonable manner. He also is probably correct in stressing the political aspects of both Jesus and Judas. Unfortunately, he damages the credibility of a serious work by overspeculation. One could hardly disagree with the fact that the Judas stories developed in totally unhistorical ways from the time of the earliest accounts to the present. The contradictions within the New Testament are blatant, and Maccoby's book would have been more helpful had he limited his work to tracing the myths of Judas through such documented changes. By devoting less space to dubious speculation, he might have been able to tell more about the documented development of these myths in patristic, medieval, and later periods. John T.
