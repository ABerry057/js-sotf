<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ephraim Kanarfogel. Jewish Education and Society in the High Middle Ages. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1992. 213 pp. In the environment that produced Rashi and the tosafists, enormous intellectual energy was focused on the most challenging texts in the Jewish tradition. These scholars changed forever our understanding of what the Talmud is, the technique of talmudic study, even the very conception of talmud torah. Considerable attention has been devoted to the attitudes of the tosafists toward the social, economic, and spiritual problems of their age. Less has been given to the educational institutions and values that prevailed among the Jewish communities in which the tosafists rose to preeminence. It seems reasonable to assume that the tosafists could have been produced only from a broad base of community-sponsored schools, much as major league baseball players rise through the pyramidal structure of little league, high school, college, and minor league teams. Further, that the schools estab- lished and funded by the medieval Jewish community provided "universal" primary education (at least for males) and higher education for those with</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 309 appropriate talents. And finally, that the educational commitments of medieval Jews were considerably broader than those of their Christian neighbors, who saw no need for literacy outside the church. This last point is buttressed with an often-cited passage by a disciple of Abelard who criticizes the lack of commitment to education among his Christian contemporaries by contrasting them with the Jews, who educate all their sons no matter how poor they are, "not for gain, as the Christians do, but for the understanding of God's law, and not only [their] sons, but [their] daughters." Such assumptions are vigorously challenged by Ephraim Kanarfogel's research, which forces us to reevaluate and revise much of what we thought we knew. He concludes that unlike the communities of talmudic Babylonia, Islamic lands, and Spain, the small communities of Ashkenaz did not sponsor an organized elementary school system. The teachers, hired and maintained by individual parents for their own children, had low social esteem and little security. In a certain respect Jews lagged behind their Christian neighbors, for the Third Lateran Council of 1179 decreed that all cathedral churches had to provide a teacher who would teach poor children at no cost. At the level of higher education, the academies of sophisticated talmudic study were not systematically supported by the communities in which they were located. Students went to study with a particular scholar, not to an estab- lished institution. During the period of the tosafists, there was no communal mechanism to ensure aid even for indigent students, whose ability to study was limited by the money at their disposal. Nor did the community grant support to the scholars themselves, not even in the form of the talmudically sanctioned tax exemption. Unlike in Spain, where the professionalization of the scholarly class proceeded apace despite Maimonides' strictures, Ashkenazic scholars supported themselves from outside work and could afford to devote full time to study and teaching only if they were independently wealthy. Following this provocative and original treatment of the economic and social foundations of medieval Ashkenazic Jewish education, Kanarfogel turns to more traditional intellectual history, discussing the development of tosafist dialectic, the role of biblical studies in the Ashkenazic curriculum, and the educational theory and practice of the German Pietists. He suggests that the shift from pre-tosafist study to tosafist dialectic may parallel the shift from monastic learning to the urban cathedral schools that occurred in Christian Europe perhaps a generation earlier. In the final chapter, he carries further the work of Haym Soloveitchik and Israel Ta-Shma on the German Pietists' critique of the tosafist paideia, arguing that the Pietists, with a less elitist</page><page sequence="3">310 BOOK REVIEWS view than that of the society as a whole, attempted to foster an educational program for Jews other than the most brilliant talmudic scholars. Kanarfogel draws on the full range of sources produced in northern France and Germany, with important comparative dimensions provided by materials from Jewish communities of southern France and Spain and from Christian sources. The annotation is meticulous and extensive, reviewing issues of debate in the scholarly literature and raising significant subsidiary points. The argument becomes somewhat less convincing when it reaches for broad explanations. Kanarfogel asserts that the "educational level of both laymen and upper-level students in Spain was generally lower than in Ashkenaz" (p. 64), and that this explains why Spanish Jews needed to assume communal responsibility for education, while Ashkenazic Jews could leave it to the individual. But the sources cited speak of the low level of talmudic learning in Sephardic Jewish society, not the high level among ordinary Jews in Ashkenaz. And even if it could be demonstrated that the average Jew in northern France knew more Talmud than his contemporary in Castile, we would still need to explain how Ashkenazic Jews achieved such a level with a system in which talented children from poor families were often excluded. The assertion that "Spanish society was not as conducive to achieving a high degree of educational success" (p. 64) as was Ashkenazic society simply begs the question. A similar problem arises in the treatment of the Pietist critique. It remains debatable how representative or idiosyncratic the Pietist program was in early-thirteenth-century German Jewish society. But even if we view the Pietists as a small sect that never became a true movement, it surely does not follow that every view in Sefer Hasidim should be considered a minority position. Kanarfogel presents the tosafists as representing "Ashkenazic society at large," opposed by the Pietists' radical critique. But it may not be justifiable to generalize that "Ashkenazic society valued the scholar above all others" (p. 90), or to assume that most Ashkenazic Jews disagreed with the Pietist position on the importance of an educational curriculum intended for those who would never become tosafists. How fully the tosafists represented the values and aspirations of the ordinary Ashkenazic Jew remains to be demonstrated. There are two appendices. The first is devoted to Sefer Huqqei ha-Torah. As this text mandates a full institutional structure for a multi-tiered educational system, it is crucial for Kanarfogel's thesis that it cannot reflect the reality of Ashkenazic Jewry in the High Middle Ages. If it is Ashkenazic in origin, and not Provengal as some have argued, then it must be merely a "theoretical</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 311 blueprint," telling us nothing about the institutional realities of Ashkenazic Jewish life. Kanarfogel notes several possible points of contact between this text and Sefer Hasidim. It is not clear to me, however, why he chose to republish the Hebrew text, which is accessible in several earlier publications. Surely it would have been more useful to have published an annotated translation of this fascinating yet elusive work. The second appendix is a brief discussion of the "Ashkenazic Educational Initiation Ceremony" for children beginning their Jewish study, concluding that many aspects of this familiar ceremony "require further investigation." This might have been more effectively integrated into the second chapter, in which Kanarfogel brings various kinds of material documenting (contra the Aries thesis about medieval childhood) a genuine emotional attachment to small children. In this chapter, the focus on education is temporarily abandoned. It would have been helpful to hear more about pedagogical techniques, including attitudes toward corporal punishment of children. Despite these minor reservations, Kanarfogel's book is challenging, stim- ulating, and suggestive. It does more than deepen our understanding of the history of medieval Jewish society and culture. The issues it raises bear directly on contemporary educational debates: the advantages of private versus public funding, elitist and universalistic philosophies, specialized versus balanced curricula, communal responsibility and the role of individual initiative, the priorities of generating sources of support for disadvantaged students and for scholars devoted to pure research. We live with the implications of these issues every day. Marc Saperstein Washington University St. Louis, Mo.</page></plain_text>
