New York: Holmes &amp; Meier, 1990. xvi, 274 pp. The late Vivian Lipman was a distinguished British civil servant for whom the writing of English Jewish history was an avocation rather than a</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 331 profession. The author of a pioneering Social History of the Jews in England, 1850-1950 (1954), Lipman considered himself a disciple of Cecil Roth and viewed what was his last book as a sequel to Roth's History of the Jews in England (3rd ed., 1964), which in effect ended in 1858 with the admission of Lionel de Rothschild to the House of Commons. In truth, Lipman was a more accomplished historian than Roth, whose work on English Jewry was unabashedly apologetic and celebratory. While Lipman can also be faulted for his filiopietism, his attention to the social history of the community, especially shifting residential and occupational patterns, distinguished his work from that of others associated with the amateur school of Anglo- Jewish historiography. Lipman's is the first attempt to survey the postemancipation period in British Jewish history and as such provides a useful introduction to the basic trends and events in the last century and a half, although it is unlikely to be the last word on the subject. As in his previous work, the most impressive parts of his book are those sections treating questions of demography and socioeconomic status: birth, death, and marriage rates; immigration waves; residential patterns; occupational diversification and mobility. His discus- sion of the geographical dispersion of London Jewry from the area of initial settlement in the City of London and the East End is especially valuable and could serve as a model for similar discussions of Jewish residential patterns in other European cities. The strengths of Lipman's survey-its comprehensiveness and its con- cern with demographic and related matters-cannot, however, mask its glaring weaknesses. To start, it is chronologically unbalanced. The half- century from the start of World War II to the present is treated in a single, fifteen-page chapter, although this was a period that witnessed dramatic changes in the life of British Jewry-religious polarization, radical assimila- tion, widespread economic mobility, and a transfer of political allegiance to the Tory party. At the same time, episodes which are far better known, such as the genesis of the Balfour Declaration and the growth of anti-alien senti- ment at the turn of the century, receive perhaps more attention than they deserve, given the availability of first-rate scholarship about these events and the almost complete absence of historical writing on the post World War II period. Since Lipman himself knew this period at first hand and was no stranger to the corridors of communal power, it is disappointing that he treated it so cursorily. I suspect that one reason that Lipman may have given it short shrift is that even the most generous reading of the period cannot sustain the trium-</page><page sequence="3">332 BOOK REVIEWS phalism or whiggish optimism associated with the amateur school of Anglo- Jewish historiography. In the penultimate sentence of the final paragraph of the book, having previously registered the fact that Anglo-Jewry is shrink- ing and that only one-third of young Jews are currently being married in a religious ceremony, Lipman soberly concludes that the outlook for the com- munity seems to be that of "polarization and decline." This is not the kind of analysis characteristic of the amateur historiographical tradition, which has tended to celebrate the achievements of the community-its loyalty to tradition, its moderation and pragmatism in religious matters, its concern for and generosity toward its less fortunate members, its love of harmony and compromise, its rootedness in English society, etc. That Lipman acknowledges the impossibility of describing the recent history of Anglo- Jewry in celebratory terms is remarkable, given his prior association with the amateur school. Unfortunately, his break with the older tradition is incomplete. The result is that this account of modern British Jewry is an awkward amalgam of the old and the new. Unlike Roth, Lipman recognizes the centrality of intracommunal conflict-between immigrants and natives, workers and masters, Zionists and assimilationists, old money and new money, religious traditionalists and progressives-and places the issues dividing them near the center of his story. (It would be difficult to do otherwise, given the emphasis on communal strife and divisiveness in books and articles pub- lished in the last decade.) However, Lipman's treatment tends to sanitize these disputes. He fails to convey the depth of feeling (fear, anger, loathing, greed, etc.) that came into play, so that at times communal disputes appear to be little more than dispassionate, rather bloodless differences of opinion, rather than clashes between irreconcilable visions of community, politics, and religion. This can be seen, for example, in his treatment of the attitudes of communal leaders toward East European immigration. The most that he can admit in regard to this still sensitive issue is that they harbored "some reservations about the immigrants" and feared that "the machinery of relief would be unable to cope with the influx." As Eugene Black demonstrates in The Social Politics of Anglo-Jewry, 1880-1920 (1988), the established lead- ership was as eager as the alien-restrictionist camp to limit the flow of poor Jews from Eastern Europe, not because its members were antisemitic, of course, but because they believed that the presence of large numbers of unanglicized strangers would create more antisemitism, thereby undermin- ing their own hard-earned social and political gains.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 333 Lipman's inability to acknowledge the anxiety aroused by the new- comers is linked to his treatment of antisemitism. Like many of his prede- cessors, he tends to minimize the extent of hostility to Jews in British society and to ignore its impact on Jewish identity and behavior. To be fair, he eschews the sort of platitudes about English tolerance and fair play that are common in Roth's work. But he confines his treatment of antisemitism largely to overt political manifestations of Jew-baiting (such as the anti- Bolshevik conspiratorial antisemitism of the Morning Post after World War I or the East End campaign of the British Union of Fascists from 1934 to 1936), while omitting any discussion of social and cultural antagonisms and their long-term impact on the formation of communal policy and personal identity. Whether intentional or not, this conveys the impression that anti- semitism was a marginal phenomenon, largely confined to the political fringe, without organic links to traditions or images shared by broad groups of the population. Furthermore, it also implies that British Jewry evolved in a kind of cultural and social vacuum, free from external pressures, however subtle, generated by the surrounding society. That this was clearly not the case has been amply demonstrated in the recent work of Eugene Black, David Cesarani, Tony Kushner, David Feldman, and Bryan Cheyette. Lipman's roots in the apologetic tradition of Anglo-Jewish historio- graphy can also be discerned in his failure to discuss forms of assimilation that led to disaffiliation from the Jewish community. As I indicated above, he does mention the fall in synagogue marriages in recent decades, but the impression given is that this is a new phenomenon rather than one rooted in attitudes and behavior extending back several generations. The reason for this is that, like Roth, Lipman tends to present the history of the community as more or less a success story, a narrative in which the protagonists man- aged to combine loyalty to Jewish tradition with participation in British society. It would be impossible to know from this account, for example, that drift and defection were widespread in the interwar period among the fami- lies of the old Victorian elite, who were then losing their hold on the comun- ity's central institutions. This is typical of Lipman's failure to confront head-on those issues that challenge the filiopietistic view of British Jewish history. Todd M.
