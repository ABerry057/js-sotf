Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1998. 208 pp. This is a superb study of post-Holocaust theology, perhaps the best study of its kind since Steven Katz's Post-Holocaust Dialogues. Zachary Braiterman fo- cuses on three of the most important post-Holocaust theologians-Richard Ru- benstein, Eliezer Berkovits, and Emil Fackeheim-in an attempt to demonstrate that all three thinkers share a common discourse rooted in a theological sensibili- ty which Braiterman identifies as "antitheodicy," a term he has coined. Anti- theodicy refers to a position which rejects theodicy-that is, any attempt to justi- fy God in the face of catastrophic suffering or to see redeeming value in it, even if one continues to believe in God. Braiterman also makes use of postmodern insights to explore the dynamic of how the three post-Holocaust theologians reread or mis- read the traditional sources in order to catapult antitheodic discourse from the mar- gins of Jewish thought into its center. The first three chapters introduce the study by providing definitions of theodicy and antitheodicy, surveying theodic and antitheodic motifs in biblical and rabbinic literature and demonstrating how such major Jewish theologians as Bu- ber, Heschel, Soloveitchik, and Kaplan are captive to theodic approaches toward suffering. The next three chapters focus on the three post-Holocaust theologians and are, therefore, the heart of the study. In Chapter Four, Braiterman shows how Rubenstein initiates antitheodic Jewish discourse in post-Holocaust theology. He presents a far more nuanced portrait of Richard Rubenstein than one finds in pre- vious assessments, showing that, far from being the radical and destructive revi- sionist his critics make him out to be, Rubenstein is, in fact, a complex thinker who attempts to reinvent the Jewish tradition. The great surprise in this study is Braiter- man's analysis of Eliezer Berkovits in Chapter Five. Ostensibly at the opposite pole from Rubenstein, Berkovits is read by Braiterman as sharing the same antitheod- 376</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews ic tendencies that inform Rubenstein's thinking. Braiterman argues that in Faith After the Holocaust Berkovits swings between theodic and antitheodic thinking, and that in his later work, With God in Hell, the antitheodic strain becomes more pronounced. Braiterman's analysis of Fackenheim in Chapter Six follows along the same lines as his analysis of the other two theologians in examining how Facken- heim adopts antitheodic thinking in his emphasis on the imperative of Jewish sur- vival as the 614th commandment. In his concluding chapter, Braiterman argues that the three post-Holocaust theologians constitute a "discursive formation" of the kind postulated by Foucault, with its own rules, thematic objects, and class of experts designed to restrict and control the way in which discourse is constructed. In this case, antitheodic dis- course is the privileged mode of thinking, a form of discourse which, Braiterman emphasizes, was made possible only by a new language for the Holocaust created by a wide array of figures in the 1950s and 1960s in fields as diverse as literature, politics, and popular culture. Braiterman also draws on Umberto Eco to argue that the three theologians come up with their new antitheodic discourse by aformal re- arrangement of elements, or "signs," within the tradition rather than by alteration of its content. Braiterman concludes with some reflections on the implications of his study for the future of Jewish theology. This volume has many virtues. Most salient from my perspective is that Braiterman has gone well beyond his predecessors in his insightful understanding of the nature of the relationship of post-Holocaust theology with the classical tra- dition. In addition, he has broken new ground in attempting to understand that re- lationship in light of the tools provided by postmodernism. But perhaps the great- est strength of Braiterman's study is the multitude of penetrating insights he provides in his running commentary on each thinker, insights too numerous to summarize here. Moreover, versatile erudition underlies Braiterman's analysis as he brings to bear on his subject an impressive range of fields that include Jewish theology, literary theory, sociology, and art. Still, I have difficulties with some of Braiterman's ideas. I wonder if, in his eagerness to demonstrate a discursive linkage between the three thinkers, he has overstated his case somewhat. Braiterman's insights about Berkovits are provoca- tive, but not entirely convincing. He places too much emphasis on the citation of Yossel Rakover at the end of With God in Hell as evidence that Berkovits' think- ing leans toward antitheodicy in his final ruminations on the Holocaust. One could argue that Berkovits would not have seen Rakover's view-or any other in the same volume-as a guide for his own theology. As Braiterman himself notes, Berkovits draws a sharp distinction between armchair theologians like ourselves and those who actually experienced the suffering of the death camps; thus, we dare not criticize even those who lost their faith entirely in the death camps (p. 126). I believe that Braiterman is also too harsh in emphasizing the negativity of Fackenheim's thinking. I disagree with the assessment that at the end of God's Presence in History "all that remains are antitheodic fragments and the dumb will to endure" (p. 143). Fackenheim's third fragment implores Jews to continue their identification with the poor and persecuted of humanity, a point which Braiterman 377</page><page sequence="3">AJS Review glosses over.1 Moreover, Braiterman fails to mention that for Fackenheim, Jews continue, in the aftermath of the Holocaust, in their traditional role as witnesses to humanity, which in the present era means being witnesses of both endurance and hope in an age of nuclear threat (ibid., p. 95). It would seem that these ideas invest the suffering of the Holocaust with at least some redemptive value. Braiterman's use of Foucault's notion of discursive formation, while illumi- nating, strikes me as somewhat awkward. First, while it is true that the three the- ologians may have formed a new theological discourse with the help of a language created by their literary and cultural predecessors, Braiterman, to my mind, does not provide enough information regarding this dynamic. We are never given an ac- count of what language was actually created, nor is sufficient explanation provid- ed for its effect on the three theologians. Only Fackenheim's overly romantic views of the State of Israel (pp. 151-154) and Berkovits' curious dependence on the fic- tional Yossel Rakover are discussed in any detail (pp. 123-125, 133). Second, Braiterman does not account for the fact that in many respects post-Holocaust the- ology, especially that of Rubenstein, who initiated this way of thinking, was a stark departure from the language of the Holocaust that came before it in directly con- fronting religious questions in a way that literature and other media had not; that is why Rubenstein was attacked and Elie Wiesel was not. Finally, for someone like Rubenstein, that departure may have had as much to do with the immediate envi- ronment of the 1960s in America, where all sacred dogmas were being questioned, as it did with the images provided by such figures as Wiesel, a factor which might move one in a direction different from that provided by Foucault. Despite these observations, I conclude by emphasizing my enthusiasm for Braiterman's accomplishment. This is a profound and sophisticated study, and even in those places where I disagree with Braiterman I am enlightened by his provoca- tive thinking.
