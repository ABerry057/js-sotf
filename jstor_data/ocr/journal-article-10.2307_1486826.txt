<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS 393 David Noel Freedman, A. Dean Forbes, and Francis I. Andersen. Studies in Hebrew and Aramaic Orthography. Biblical and Judaic Studies, vol. 2. Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 1992. xi, 328 pp. Chapter 1 of the present volume is by Freedman (Andersen's teacher); chapters 2, 8, and 10 by Forbes; 4, 5, 6, and 15 by Andersen. The other seven chapters, plus a lengthy appendix, were written collaboratively, either by Andersen and Forbes or by Andersen and Freedman. As William H. Propp, the editor of the series, explains in the preface, this book arose from a conference at the University of California, San Diego, in 1986, to discuss the method and findings of Andersen and Forbes's Spelling in the Hebrew Bible, which came out in that same year (Biblica et Orientalia 41). Six years later, the newly published material is miscellaneous and on the whole supplementary; much of it was deemed peripheral or unsuitable for inclusion in their tightly focused Spelling. We can be grateful that it is made available here. And in the midst of many particular observations I find one very striking and far-reaching conclusion: "The spellings now found in MT [the Masoretic text] are a perpetuation and preservation of norms that were put in place during the Persian period" (p. 250). In the list of references at the end, the most recent entries are reviews of Spelling in 1988 by J. Barr and D. Pardee. However, my own review of it in Hebrew Studies 30 (1989), 96-100, must have come out too late to be taken into account. I will not now summarize my chief criticism, the inadequacy of the authors' phonetic analysis. But I must in fairness remark that one crucial misstep is partially corrected here: Their statistical procedure in Spelling led them to disregard the thirty-eight occurrences of n 'your' or 'you' (masc. sing.), on the criterion that this is less than 1 percent of the total; for 1- occurs 6,998 times. Andersen now cites those thirty-eight passages (p. 63)-which are really thirty-nine, since ;ip 'he will strike you' (Ps. 121:6) is inadvertently omitted. It is too bad that he gives only the locations, not the actual Hebrew forms, such as .i3.z 'I will strike you' (2 Sam. 2:22, in contrast to the "converted perfect" ~.. 'and he will strike you', 1 Kings 20:36). For to some readers the concentration of the rare in- forms in certain environments might have suggested a phonetic cause: namely, dissimilatory deaspiration of the second [kh] to [k] when the first [K] is aspirate. I pointed out this recurrent phenomenon in an article "Grassmann's 'Law' in the Early Semitic Loan-Word XITr6v, KlOwiv," Studi Micenei ed Egeo-anatolici 8 (1969):</page><page sequence="2">394 BOOK REVIEWS 66-75, and at greater length in The Indo-European and Semitic Languages (Albany, 1971), pp. 572 ff. Andersen and Freedman's discussion of this pronominal suffix elsewhere in the new book suffers from a grave misapprehension: "the Masoretes uniformly [!] read both these spellings as -ka [really {-ko}, with a fricative consonant usually and a back-vowel always], overriding the information preserved in the traditional spelling without he [the final letter n]" (p. 204). Here they overlook the pausal forms with no vowel at the end: 1? { lIk} 'for you', I= { Iimmik;} 'with you', etc., which prove it was an oral tradition of Bible reading-not some imaginary rule-that regulated where in the Bible text the Masoretes of Tiberias pronounced a final consonant with the vowel {-1}, and where without it. The misstatement is partly corrected on page 216, referring to "the pausal form, i.e., -ak"; but a different oversight weakens this paragraph. Commenting upon tm,5vK 'to you' in a fragment of Deuteronomy (5:28) found at Qumran near the Dead Sea, Andersen and Freedman call attention to the Masoretic ir.., which is formally like a plural noun (cf. ;' I 'your sons'); but while noting that the Masoretic text contains "examples of the long spelling" (the thirty-eight or thirty-nine occurrences of tm-), they ought to have added that not one of these is plural. This fact would have been apparent if the table on page 63 showed not just the thirty-eight locations but the Hebrew words themselves. At the time when the Masoretic spelling was fixed, the consonant group [yK] in such an environment was uniformly aspirate before the vowel [3]-no less than the consonant [h] itself in r,.5 'to her', r'ta 'her sons', etc.-and therefore, by Grassmann's "law," [yK] precluded any aspiration after the vowel. And whereas aspiration very easily accompanied the voiceless velar consonant in ancient Hebrew (like many other languages), it could even affect-in a peculiarly Hebrew environment-a much less susceptible consonant. Thus the subject suffix 'n- 'they' or 'you' (fem. pl.), which on the whole retains its final n, is most inclined to shed it in verb-forms of the In"1 type, such as ,'i.n 'and they made [him] drink' (Gen.19:33, 35). The instances are mainly in Genesis and Exodus (see The Indo-European and Semitic Languages, pp. 577-578). The articulatory constraint that produced '.- in the Masoretic text, to the exclusion of *i,., also tended to produce 4'.- at times, instead of the usual ir'.-. Forbes's chapters, dealing with statistical methods, are beyond my ability</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 395 to evaluate, but they are evidently composed with great expertise. Andersen and Freedman's treatment of the Aramaic inscription from Tell Fekherye (chap. 11) is remarkably thorough, commenting upon each and every word. (It is reprinted from "JSOT Supplement Series 48.") No Aramaic characters appear; instead they present first a straightforward transliteration, then a transliteration with vowels added according to a reconstruction of the Aramaic language as they suppose it to have been before the period of the documents in Ezra 4:8 ff. (p. 140). Judiciously they disclaim phonetic accuracy. Their main concern is to locate the words in which the letters ,n, i, or ' stood only for the prolongation of a vowel sound, rather than for the consonants [h], [w], or [y] respectively. The reader is free to use the copious data without being committed to the same interpretation as Andersen and Freedman espouse. The meticulous attention to detail, which all three authors show on every page, enlarges the realm of knowledge in a difficult and highly technical field.
