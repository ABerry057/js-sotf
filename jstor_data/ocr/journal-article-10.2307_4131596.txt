<plain_text><page sequence="1">Elliot N. Dorff and Louis E. Newman, editors. Contemporary Jewish Theology: A Reader. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. xvi, 522 pp. It is arduous to review an anthology that has the ambition of presenting the large spectrum of movements and schools of contemporary Jewish religious thought. Limits of space prevent us from discussing individually the many authors selected in it. Instead, we must consider the criteria by which the authors have been chosen and how the editors have organized the anthologized materials. Such cri- teria are reducible to the idea that is expressed by the editors in the brief preface. In these last decades of the twentieth century, the Jewish world has experienced an extraordinary flourishing of thought that produced an enormous quantity of works of theological, philosophical, and ethical reflection, whose development was un- thinkable right after World War II. This production was especially widespread in the Anglo-American area, where the English-speaking Jewish communities emerged as the most learned, wealthy, and pluralistic communities in the diaspo- ra. Nobody can deny this sociological fact, which is also a cultural phenomenon. This anthology objectively reflects this situation. Nonetheless, it also shows the great open-mindedness and the vivacity with which the Jewish thinkers of this cen- tury have tried to answer the questions posed by history. Perhaps this is the right key to comprehend the phenomenon of such a large, variegated, and high-quality intellectual production. The many, often tragic, un- precedented foundational events of contemporary history touched the Jewish peo- 204</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews ple so deeply that they were stimulated and sometimes forced to elaborate new re- sponses to the new problems of meaning and interpretation that the events entailed. The re-flourishing of Jewish thinking during the last hundred years is also fruit of what Emil Fackenheim called "the return of the Jewish people into history." Such a return forced Jewish thinkers to face, on the one hand, the problem of continuity and/or discontinuity with the past, and, on the other hand, the challenge of imag- ining and creating the conditions of a less traumatic future. Dorff and Newman have organized the volume in the following manner. Af- ter Byron Sherwin's introduction discussing the historical-epistemological status of the controversial category of "Jewish theology," the editors present some ex- cerpts from the most significant oeuvres of philosophers who are already consid- ered classics: Hermann Cohen, Franz Rosenzweig, Martin Buber, Abraham I. Kook, Mordechai Kaplan, and Abraham J. Heschel. A third and larger part is ded- icated to basic themes and includes essays by authors who belong almost com- pletely to the second part of the century. The themes are classical chapters of all "Jewish theologies of history": God, creation, revelation, redemption, covenant/ election, and the law. A fourth part is an exploration of the two fundamental expe- riences of the Shoah and the rebuilding of the State of Israel and their different- often conflicting-interpretations. The last part sets up a debate on the future of Jewish theology, especially the developments that neo-Hasidism, Jewish femin- ism, and postmodern hermeneutics can offer. In all, thirty-nine authors are pre- sented, plus brief introductions for each of the five parts, and some final biblio- graphical suggestions. I dare say that the volume is the best anthology on this sub- ject because it is a very accurate panorama of this old-new branch of Jewish philosophy, that is, Jewish theology. As the editors honestly admit, the major problem of the volume is the treat- ment of Zionist thought. Certainly, Zionism is also a philosophical phenomenon (we must remember Ahad Ha'am or Aaron Gordon, for example, who are com- pletely absent from the anthology). As well, the theme of the return to Zion and Jewish nationalism is partially absorbed into the reflection on the theological meaning of the rebuilding of a Jewish state. Notwithstanding, classical Zionism (at least in its most significant exponents) is a secular, anti-religious response to the problem of the economic alienation of the European Jews and to persecution. The difficulty thus becomes finding a place for this essential current of contem- porary Jewish thought inside a theological anthology. I think an exception could be made for Eliezer Schweid, who is already well known in the United States for his outstanding research on Jewish thinking of this century. But, as I stated at the beginning, it is arduous to judge the criteria of selection, always subjective, of the included and the excluded. The anthology is thought of in continuity with a previous book, Contempo- rary Jewish Ethics and Morality (Oxford, 1995), also edited by Dorff and New- man. It is offered to academics and scholars, and to educators and religious lead- ers in search of new perspectives and insights. It shares a special space on the bookshelf together with two other anthologies essential for a holistic vision of cur- rent Jewish thought: Contemporary Jewish Religious Thought, edited by Arthur Cohen and Paul Mendes-Flohr (New York, 1986), and The Zionist Idea.
