<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS H. Louis Ginsberg. The Israelian Heritage of Judaism. New York Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1982. 145 pp. H. L. Ginsberg's recent monograph is perhaps the most seminal study of the Deuteronomic question since Julius Wellhausen's History of Israel, Volume 1, first published in 1878, a work which in its time revolutionized biblical research.' No two works could be more dissimilar, however, either in style or method. Wellhausen wrote expansively, seeking to demonstrate a comprehensive theory of religious development in ancient Israel. He worked with historical models derived from other disciplines. Ginsberg, on the other hand, writes more in the manner of a theoretical mathematician, providing us with a series of equations, laconically stated, and accompanied by only brief comments. Ginsberg focuses on a limited number of key biblical passages, and sub- jects these to a type of exegesis which he himself has perfected and refined more than any other modern scholar. His method rests on the analysis of diction, which allows him to trace literary provenance. Ultimately, Gins- berg's potential for conclusive demonstration is greater than was Well- 1. The original German title was Geschichte Israels. In 1883, Wellhausen published a second, revised edition under the title Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels, which has become the standard reference work (English trans., Prolegomena to the History of Israel [Cleveland and New York: Meridian Books, 1961]). 143</page><page sequence="2">144 BOOK REVIEWS hausen's, because he bases his conclusions on biblical Hebrew expression, on the evidence of language, rather than on a theoretical model. Ironically, what has remained valid in Wellhausen's own reconstruction is his interpre- tation of certain specific biblical texts, whereas his overall historical recon- struction has been shown to be problematic in basic respects. In the present study, Ginsberg argues that "proto-Deuteronomy" (a term designating those sections of the book which we have reason to con- sider primary) originated in the northern Israelite kingdom of the mid- to late-eighth century B.C.E., in the period prior to the downfall of northern Israel. Ginsberg coined the term "Israelian" to convey this geosocial context. In the course of the monograph, he also exposes the Israelian origin of other biblical writings-chapters 6-7 of Micah, parts of the Book of Proverbs, and certain Psalms. The cumulative effect of his discussions is to provide a more balanced view of literary creativity and religious develop- ment during the eighth century B.C.E. We become aware of positive responses to the problems of northern Israelite society, coming from within that society itself. Ginsberg's effort corrects for the "bad press" received by the northern Israelite kingdom in much of biblical literature. Foremost among the Israelian responses are the teachings preserved in Deuteronomy. Ginsberg argues that the doctrine restricting all sacrifice and cultic activity to one legitimate temple first emerged in northern Israel and was then transmitted to Jerusalem and Judah. It eventually impacted seventh-century Judah, as well as the postexilic Judean community restored. By positioning proto-Deuteronomy in northern Israel of the eighth century B.C.E. instead of in seventh-century Judah, as most scholars had concluded, Ginsberg also places the priestly component within Torah literature (known as P) in literary-historical perspective.2 He shows that, with surprisingly few exceptions, priestly legislation represents a set of accommodations to the Deuteronomic program, especially as regards the changing character of the annual pilgrimage festivals. I Undoubtedly, the best way to underscore the importance of Ginsberg's contribution would be to clarify the centrality of the Deuteronomic question 2. Perhaps the best representative discussion of the Deuteronomic question is to be found in M. Weinfeld, Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomic School (Oxford, 1972). Ginsberg's mono- graph will, however, require serious modification of Weinfeld's treatment.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 145 itself, in both historical and phenomenological terms. Essentially, what we call the Deuteronomic question concerns patterns of worship and the de- limiting of sacred space. In the Near East, as elsewhere in the ancient world, the sanctity of space lay at the heart of religious experience. A primary func- tion of institutionalized religions was, therefore, to determine where one could legitimately worship. In antiquity, worship inevitably involved sacri- fice, for prayer, by itself, was regarded as insufficent. It was generally held that sacrifice was efficacious only at sacred sites. To put it another way: sacrifice worked only at sites where divine beings were thought to be present, or to which they could be invited. When we read of the initiation of sacrificial worship at a site previously unknown for its sanc- tity (at least, as the Bible states the matter), we find that worshipers would invoke the deity by name. The resultant appearance of the deity, the theophany, served to confirm the sanctity of the site. Ritual activity and magical means were aimed at consecrating space-the ground itself, as well as the related structures, artifacts, and materiel, extending to the personnel operating in sacred space. Decisions relevant to the locus of worship and celebration determined, to a considerable degree, the manifest character of a given religion. One would surely expect to find in the Hebrew Bible state- ments of policy on the matter of sacred space; and indeed we do. Exodus 20:19-23 tells us what certain "Israelian" spokesmen of the ninth or perhaps early eighth century B.C.E. thought about sacred space. The stated policy is as follows: Israelites may offer sacrifices to the God of Israel at any mdqdm ("cult-place") in the land where God permits His name to be invoked. He permits this where certain specific conditions are met; namely, idolatrous worship is emphatically forbidden, the altar is construct- ed in a specific manner, and the priests conduct themselves decorously. The God of Israel will "arrive" at a proper mdqdm in response to invocation, and will grant blessings to His worshippers. There is no limit on the number of such cult-places. This relatively early statement, appearing almost directly after the Deca- logue, and immediately before the laws of the Book of the Covenant, corre- lates with the most reliable biblical traditions on religion and worship. The Patriarchs, as we read about them in the earliest narratives of Genesis, erected altars all over the land, and offered sacrifices upon them, invoking God's name and experiencing theophanies in sacred space. Jacob's experi- ences at Beth-El, as related in the northern Israelite narrative of Gen. 28:12-22, provide a good example. Judges of Israel acted in the same way, and even Solomon offered sacri-</page><page sequence="4">146 BOOK REVIEWS fices regularly on the great bdmdh at Gibeon before the Temple was built in Jerusalem (I Kings 3). Elijah sacrificed on a Yahwistic altar somewhere in the Carmel range (I Kings 18), just as Samuel had, before him, at any num- ber of cult-places located along his circuit.3 Archaeological excavations have unearthed Israelite cult-places all over the land, literally from tell-Dan to tell-Beer-Sheva, dating from the period of the monarchies, and even prior to that time at such sites as Shiloh, in the Ephraimite hills. Although we find conflicting traditions in biblical literature, it would seem that Exodus 20:19-23 accords with official policy up to and until the historical period covered by approximately the last ten chapters of Second Kings; which is to say, until near the close of the eighth century B.C.E., when Hezekiah was king over Judah and Jerusalem. The normal pattern in biblical Israel, according to law, policy, and cus- tom, was one of multiple cult-places of varying magnitude and complexity, functioning on a local, regional, and even a national basis. Every town of any size would normally have a cult-place of some sort nearby, either an altar or a bdmdh. There were places for worship located on the main roads and in border areas, often attached to military or administrative outposts. The sanctuaries at Arad and Beer-Sheva were representative of this system. This system is specifically renounced in Deuteronomy, chapters 12 and 14-17, where a different doctrine altogether is expounded. If Exodus 20:19-23 permits worship at any proper mdqdm in the land, Deuteronomy explicitly forbids this. All cultic activity is to be restricted to one mdtqdm, whose location will be determined by God. All that we are told is that this mdcjom would stand in one of the tribal territories. The restriction covers festival celebrations and the remittance of tithes, votives, and firstlings. In literary context, Deuteronomy 12, which is the principal statement of policy, addresses the Israelites of Moses' time, as they prepared to cross the Jordan into Canaan. The chapter opens with the command to destroy all existing pagan cult-places in Canaan, where the native inhabitants of the land worshiped, together with their attendant artifacts. The one legitimate mdqdm was to be newly constructed, not produced from an earlier structure. As the chapter unfolds, however, the Israelites are told not to persist in their own erstwhile pattern of offering sacrifice at various cult-places. The justifi- cation of that policy (the one followed before entry into the land) was that a people on the move, who had not as yet arrived at a secure haven, might 3. A fairly elaborate description of such a cult-installation is found in I Samuel 9.</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 147 require many places of worship. Once settled, however, Israelites were to utilize only one, newly erected sanctuary in the Promised Land. Deuteronomy 12 continues with regulations concerning the slaughter of animals. Since all sacrificing would be restricted to a single sanctuary, the act of slaughtering animals, when performed elsewhere, could have no sacral significance whatsoever. No cult of purity would be involved, nor any altar used. Instead of being dashed on the altar, as was the practice with sacrificial blood, such blood was to be spilled on the ground and covered over. Among other things, this change in the phenomenology of slaughter- ing would eliminate the need for priests and other cult-practitioners throughout the land. Indeed, chapter 12 proceeds to exhort Israelites to be generous to the Levites, who would presumably join the ranks of the un- employed! Chapter 12 of Deuteronomy ends with an admonition to avoid forms of worship practiced by the indigenous Canaanites. Deut. 14:22-27 extends the laws of chapter 12 to tithes and firstlings, and 15:19-23 restates the law as regards firstlings. Chapter 16 emphasizes the requirement that the annual pilgrimage festivals take place exclusively at the central mdlom, including even the paschal sacrifice. In chapter 17 we read that the High Court would be located at the central md om, as well. The point to be made about Deuteronomy 12, in particular, is that it purports to speak only of idolatry. The polarity it generates is between wor- ship of the God of Israel and pagan worship, and this is part of a widespread tendency in biblical literature to brand improper worship of the God of Israel as tantamount to idolatry. This tendency masks several different forms of heterodoxy, some purportedly representing the worship of the God of Israel, but which were objectionable in the view of biblical spokesmen. But the reference in chapter 12 of Deuteronomy to the earlier pattern of worship among the Israelites, who themselves used multiple cult-places, is a giveaway! It alludes to reality, and suggests that the issue actually being addressed is the policy governing worship of the God of Israel, not simply the eradication of idolatry, on which every official tradition agreed. Deute- ronomy is ostensibly blind to the actual history of worship in ancient Israel. It imposes its doctrine on the entering Israelites, whereas, in historical per- spective, what it states clashes with a background experience of local and regional worship of the God of Israel, in the Promised Land itself. Its mes- sage confronts a longstanding, customary pattern, formerly thought to be proper and in accordance with God's will. Here is not the place to deal with traditional attempts to resolve the</page><page sequence="6">148 BOOK REVIEWS Deuteronomic disagreement with patterns of worship recorded in biblical books canonically subsequent to Deuteronomy, and which were believed to pertain to subsequent periods of biblical history. Understandably, later Jewish interpreters sought to demonstrate the overall consistency of the biblical record. The offerings of Samuel and Elijah, recorded in the books of Samuel and Kings, were taken to be sporadic and unusual measures, and not representative of normal patterns of worship in the premonarchic and monarchic periods. In utter contrast to the traditionalist view, modern critical scholars eagerly seized on what they correctly regarded as a significant, documented shift in religious policy, inevitably connected in some way to the edicts of Josiah, king of Judah, recorded in II Kings 22-23, and dated ca. 622 B.C.E. This shift in policy surely accounts for the repeated proverbial condemna- tions of the bdmdt editorially implanted into the text of Kings.4 While the Temple in Jerusalem was under renovation, a priest discovered an old document, which was brought to Josiah and read in his presence. Upon hearing its contents, Josiah rent his garments, and sought clarification from the prophetess Huldah. She confirmed the authenticity of the docu- ment, and interpreted its contents to mean that Jerusalem and the Temple would be destroyed, and the people sent into exile. God had been angered by the widespread idolatry. From the measures which Josiah undertook in response to the dis- covered document, we may infer something of its specific contents. He destroyed, or at least put out of commission, cult-places all over the land. He singled out for particular attention the cult-center at Beth-El and its adjoining necropolis, and the Tophet outside of Jerusalem. He killed off pagan priests, and ordered Israelite priests to report to Jerusalem, thereby terminating their operations elsewhere. Of particular interest was his direc- tive proclaiming celebration of the paschal sacrifice in the Temple of Jerusa- lem, something that had never before occurred. Against this background, we may now formulate what we have been referring to as the Deuteronomic question. We do so in several phases: 1. What is the historical relationship between the legislation of Deute- ronomy and the edicts of Josiah? Are both sources referring to the same religious movement, and if so, how? 2. Is the tale told in II Kings about an old document discovered in the 4. For examples see I Kings 22:44, II Kings 12:14, 14:4, 15:4, 35, etc.</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS 149 Temple to be taken at face value? Are we to conclude that the objection to existing cult-places had, indeed, emerged at an earlier period, but had been ignored or opposed during the long reign of Manasseh, throughout most of the seventh century B.C.E.? Or is this tale legendary, merely intended to lend sanction to what was, in reality, a reform of worship and of the priesthood initiated by Josiah himself, and actually a product of religious ferment in the Judah of the mid- to late seventh century B.C.E.? 3. How are we, in either case, to interpret the efforts of Hezekiah, who had also sought to eliminate existing cult-places, as reported in II Kings 18:3-5, 22? These efforts would have taken place soon after the fall of the northern Israelite kingdom, in the late eighth century. II Ginsberg does justice to all phases of the Deuteronomic question as we have just formulated it. How he does so requires us to read Hosea with new eyes, and to register its diction more precisely than we have been doing. A cursory reading of Hosea in tandem with Deuteronomy would hardly endorse Ginsberg's claim that the Deuteronomic program originally consti- tuted a response to Hosean prophecies. There is little overall similarity between the two works. And yet, Ginsberg has identified three examples of corresponding diction which are so distinctive in biblical writings of the ninth to eighth century B.C.E. that we may theorize that the author (or authors) of proto-Deuteronomy most likely would not have derived such diction from any source other than the books of Hosea, which are collec- tions of Israelian writings. (As a matter of fact, Ginsberg posits two Hoseas: chapters 1-3, written in the ninth century, and chapters 4-14, of the eighth century.) The theory that dictional correspondences indicate shared literary pro- venance rests on the reality that in ancient societies writers and scribes learned their techniques of composing narratives and chronicles, as well as poems, and legal and ritual codes from relatively few teachers. The succes- sive exponents of specific teachings were usually associated with the same, ongoing institutions, and worked in the same schools, or circles, so that they would expectedly employ the same diction as their mentors and precursors had. In Hosea 2:10 we read that the Lord, in His kindness, had provided the Israelites with dagan, tFrdsh, and yitshar, "grain, wine, and oil," in that</page><page sequence="8">150 BOOK REVIEWS order (cf. further in Hos. 2:24). In Deut. 12:17, part of the basic exposition of the Deuteronomic program, we read that Israelites are required to remit tithes of dagan, tfrdsh, and yitshadr, in that order, to the Lord, at the one central mdqdm. This is repeated in Deut. 14:23 and 18:4. What was, in the first instance, a merism became a cliche in the writings of the Deuteronomist (Deut. 7:13, 11:14, 28:51). Independently, two of the three components of the merism, ddgdn and tfrdsh, occur as a pair in Gen. 27:28, 37, in the work of the Elohist of northern Israel; and in Hos. 7:14 and 9:1, somewhat adapted. The fact that, according to Ginsberg, chapters 1-3 of Hosea derive from the ninth century B.C.E. adds significance to the dic- tional correspondence between Hosea and Deuteronomy, because it brings us back to the northern Israelite society of an even earlier period. What we have is, therefore, Israelian diction par excellence, and we can trace the further transmission of the same merism in Judean literature and into postexilic times, even as far as the recently discovered Temple Scroll. The other two examples of diction discussed by Ginsberg are equally compelling. But diction alone cannot make the case that proto-Deuteronomy is an Israelian creation of the period between 740 and 725 B.C.E. Ginsberg conse- quently discusses examples of Deuteronomic legislation which he regards as responses, at least in part, to Hosean prophecies. It is the interaction of diction, theme, and law which ultimately clinches the argument. Ginsberg cites two examples of Hosean influence. One seemingly has nothing directly to do with the religious doctrine of Deuteronomy, but we shall learn that, in a curious way, it does! In Hos. 10:13-15, the prophet condemns reliance on chariotry and professional warriors, as part of his antiwar policy. Deut. 20:1-9, part of the law of warfare, and Deut. 17:16-17, part of the law of the king, echo this Hosean theme. More immediately pertinent to the argument is Ginsberg's suggestion that Hos. 8:11-14 was the impetus behind Deut. 12:8-18. Here is how Gins- berg explains this point: The centralization of the cult which is required by Deut. 12:8-18 is surely, at least in part, a response to the denunciation cum threat of Hos. 8:11-14: "For Ephraim has multiplied altars-for guilt; his altars have redounded to his guilt; (12) The principles (?) of the instruction I wrote for him have been treated as something alien. (13) They have slaughtered victims to no purpose (?)-only for meat to eat. YHWH has not been appeased by them. Behold, He will remember their iniquity and punish their sins: back to Egypt with them! (14) Since Israel has</page><page sequence="9">BOOK REVIEWS 151 forgotten His Maker while building temples... I will send down fire on his cities and it shall devour his fortresses." The Deuteronomist evidently reasoned: if a multiplicity of altars and temples will lead to exile and devasta- tion, the catastrophe may be averted by reducing the number of temples to one, so that people may not rely on them as a means of obtaining absolution. That this passage in Hosea was a factor in giving rise to the law in Deut. 12, is confirmed by the recurrence in the latter of the phrase we have italicized in the former: yzbhw bsr wy'lkw (Hos. 8:13) tzbh w'klt bir (Deut. 12:15) [p. 21]. Surely, this matter warrants added discussion, because it is pivotal to the entire attribution of an Israelian provenance to proto-Deuteronomy. We begin with Ginsberg's keen observation that Hos. 8:11-14 and Deut. 12:15 are linked by shared and highly distinctive diction. As a matter of fact, no other biblical passage contains, in a single clause, these three ingredients: the verb 'dkhal, "eat," the verb zdbhah, "to slaughter," and the noun bdcir, "meat." But this is more than a technical correspondence. The theme of feasting on meat is basic to Deuteronomy 12, which repeatedly states that in the new order of worship, feasting on meat will have no sacral significance. Whereas Hosea regards as regrettable the practice of reducing the sacrificing of animals to mere feasting on meat, with no worshipful intent, Deuteron- omy ordains that henceforth, the slaughter of animals outside the one legiti- mate mdqdm will, ironically, be nothing more than feasting on meat. So much for diction and its allusiveness. The real question is whether the Deuteronomic program is a logical response to Hosean prophecies. Is the reduction of sacred space to one legitimate cult-place a reasonable response to what Hosea was opposing in the northern Israelite society of the mid- to late eighth century B.C.E.? All of Hosea 8 expresses the prophet's observation that Israel has aban- doned "what is good," as verse 3 puts it. As a consequence of its disloyalty, northern Israel will be destroyed by an enemy. The people had betrayed bernt and tarah, and their worship of God had been hypocritical. They seek ritual atonement as a mask for their transgressions. They appoint kings unacceptable to the Lord, and spend their wealth on idols, a prime example being the Bull of Samaria. This brings us to vv. 11-14, which Ginsberg cites in particular. It is a case of "the more the worse!" The prophet posits a correlation between the proliferation of altars and temples and the guilt of the people. Those who endow temples and erect altars are the very ones who have forgotten God. The more cult-places, therefore, the greater the affront to God and the more severe the degeneration of society. The same quantitative correlation is</page><page sequence="10">152 BOOK REVIEWS expressed in Hos. 4:7, with reference to priests: "The more numerous they (=the priests) have become, the more so have they offended Me. I will turn their prestige into disgrace!" The theme of Hosea 8 is carried forward in Hos. 10:1-8, which adds vehemence to the prophetic denunciation of an expanded cultic establish- ment under royal sponsorship. The passage is extremely difficult to interpret with assurance, but it holds forth potential insights into the thrust of Hosea's policy on cult and worship. Israel is a ravaged vine, And his fruit resembles him! When his fruit abounded, He had built abundant altars! When his land enjoyed plenty, He had erected stelae aplenty! But because his devotion failed, He now faces ruin!5 So now he himself will pull down his altars, He will smash his own stelae! For now they claim: "We have no king! We did not fear the LORD, So what can the king do to us?" Agreements were concluded with false oaths, And covenants enacted, And justice broke out like poisonous weeds In the furrows of the field! The residents of Samaria fear for the calf of Beit-'Awen, Its populace mourns over its glory, 5. I prefer to see the botanical metaphor as moving quickly to the people of Israel. NJPS translates: "Now that his boughs are broken up," etc. This rendering takes its cue from II Sam. 18:14, where bilkbh hd'~dlh means "in the thick growth of the terebinth." The verb bdlaq is taken in the usual sense of "dividing, splitting off, or the like." The translation given here posits a second root in biblical Hebrew: .hlaq, cognate to Akkadian ljalaqu, "to disappear, vanish, to become missing or lost, to perish" (see the Assyrian Dictionary [University of Chicago], vol. 6 (l), 36 f.). This root is probably attested elsewhere in biblical Hebrew, unbeknown to most (cf. the niphal form in Gen. 14:15, as an example). The sense here is that the metaphor, having shifted from the vine to the people, speaks of their loss of "heart," namely, their loss of devo- tion or loyalty. For this sense of Hebrew lebh, see usage in Num. 32:7, 9, II Sam. 15:13, I Kings 12:27, etc.</page><page sequence="11">BOOK REVIEWS 153 That has departed from it.6 It, too, will be transported to Assyria, As tribute to an imperial king. Ephraim shall be shamed, Israel shall be failed by its own policy! Samaria's monarchy is dissolving, Like foam upon the water! The high-places of 'Awen shall be ruined, The guilt of Israel! Thorns and thistles shall overrun her altars, They shall say to the mountains: "Cover us!" To the hills: "Slide over us!" Hosea might have preferred no cult at all to what he had observed in northern Israel. The cult establishment was a major part of the problem, because its influence contradicted the true objectives of religious life. It represented what we might call "state religion." Joash and Jeroboam II, kings of northern Israel, exploited the popular penchant for worship and celebration, and the strongly felt need for expiation and divine forgiveness. The royal establishment endowed numerous altars and cult places, and royally appointed priests undoubtedly assumed control over existing tradi- tional cult-places so that everywhere, royal policy would be sanctioned by the institutions of religion. This strategy is brought home by the sharp inter- change between the prophet Amos and Amaziah, the priest of Beth-El, preserved in chapter 7 of Amos. Chapters 8 and 10 of Hosea inform us that royal policies had proved disastrous, both in domestic and international terms. The people were beginning to defy their king. They were tearing down the lavish symbols of royal policy, the altars and stelae. They reasoned, a fortiori, that once they had offended God and suffered His wrath, they had little to fear from a discredited king! In Hosea 8 and 10 we observe a subtle blending of the religious and the sociopolitical as themes of prophetic denunciation. Most assuredly, there was something seriously wrong with current modes of worship and with reli- gious attitudes, but there was more to the problem than heterodoxy and hypocrisy. 6. Hebrew 'dwen, "iniquity," represents a pejorative alteration of the toponymic Beit-'El, "House of God," to Beit-'Aen, or just 'Awen, for the actual town of Beth-El. See Hosea 4:15, 5:8, in addition to our passage.</page><page sequence="12">154 BOOK REVIEWS Hosea and Amos refer by name to a number of cult-centers, undoubted- ly royally sponsored, which were operative in the northern Israel of the eighth century B.C.E. They mention Beth-El, of course, as well as Dan, Gilead (Jabesh Gilead?), Gilgal, Samaria, and Shechem. They also refer to mnizbc2hdt, "altars," and this is significant, as we have seen in the case of Hosea 8:11.7 Now, Isaiah of Jerusalem, who also objected to lavishing wealth on idols (Isa. 2:7-8), refers only once to the problematic of such altars. This is as part of an oracle on the downfall of the Kingdom of Damascus (Isa. 17:1-11), in which the prophet predicts for the Arameans the same misfortune that was about to befall the northern kingdom of Israel! The point is that the phenomenon of altars was a distinctive feature of religious life in northern Israel, and it is only when he is characterizing the situation in northern Israel that Isaiah refers to it specifically. In fact, a good case could be made for concluding that Isaiah of Jerusalem spoke somewhat like a northerner when his subject was the religious disloyalty of northern Israelite society. One need only compare Hosea 14:4b with Isaiah 17:8! The target of Hosea's critique is the domination of religious life by the kings of northern Israel. In these terms, we can appreciate Ginsberg's atten- tion to the thematic link between Hosea's reference to chariotry and profes- sional soldiers, on the one hand, and the laws of Deuteronomy 17 and 20, regarding the duties of the king and warfare, on the other. Is it coincidental that Hosea 8:1 accuses the House of Israel (for that is how Ginsberg reads this verse) of transgressing the covenant, while Deut. 17:2 speaks of an Israealite who advocates doing the same, with both texts employing the fairly rare formula, 'c"bhar birFt?8 Given the emphasis in chapters 8 and 10 of Hosea on bnrft, mishpdt, "jus- tice," and tbrah "instruction," is it coincidental that Deuteronomy 17 calls for the establishment of a High Court in the projected central mcqdm, where tdrah and mishpc2i would, it was hoped, be dispensed faithfully? Ginsberg 7. See Hosea 8:11, 10:1-2, 8, 12:2, Amos 3:14. The quantitative correlation reappears later in Jer. 11:13, 17:1, and the problem of numerous altars informs Ezekiel 6, for instance, and is addressed in Kings and Deuteronomistic literature generally. 8. The Masoretic text of v. 1 has belt YHWH, "House of the LORD," but NJPS, informed by Ginsberg, suggests that an emendation would yield belt Yisrd'll, "House of Israel." It was Ginsberg who surmised that biblical manuscripts may have registered only a yod (in our case, bert y-), not the entire word, so that an ancient copyist might have misread the intent. See the article by Ginsberg, "Hosea," in Encyclopaedia Judaica, vol. 8, cols. 1010 f. For the formula 'dbhar bi?rFt, "to transgress the covenant," see Hosea 6:7, and also Jos. 7:15, 23:16, Judg. 2:20, which are Deuteronomistic in tone.</page><page sequence="13">BOOK REVIEWS 155 notes the theme of royal arrogance shared by Deut. 8:12-15, 17:20, and Hosea 13:5-6. We find in Hosea and Deuteronomy shared themes associated with the monarchy, in addition to distinctive dictional links between the two sources. The structure of Deuteronomy 17 seems almost to be dictated, or condi- tioned, perhaps, by Hosea's agenda. It begins by condemning an Israelite who worships other gods, and proceeds to ordain a High Court in the cen- tral temple, so as to promote justice in the land. It continues to warn of the danger presented by a king who becomes haughty and profligate, and requires kings to study the book of God's teachings diligently. The prophecies of Hosea prompt us to regard the Deuteronomic restric- tion of cultic activity to one central sanctuary as part of a larger, more comprehensive program. We must not miss the point of Deuteronomy 12 that the one legitimate mcdqdm for sacrifice and celebration will not stand in the royal capital; that its location will not be determined either by the monarchy or by any traditional institutions. It will be located where God determines, "in one of your tribal territories." This is Deuteronomy's way of saying that the central temple would be taken out of the hands of the royal administration, and that the High Court would also be independent. The beautiful oracle preserved in Hosea 14:2-9 affords us a mirror- image of the Hosean critique of northern Israelite society. When Israel repents, and "returns" to the Lord, what will then be its national policy? Israel will not enter into unwise treaties, nor place its reliance on Assyria. Nor will it rely on chariotry, an allusion to relations with Egypt. Israel will no longer worship idols, but will look to the Lord for help. For His part, the Lord will bless Israel bountifully. The most significant state- ment comes in v. 2b: Say to Him: "You absolve all sinfulness, And accept good acts. We shall substitute for bulls, The [pledge] of our lips!" In context, this is not, I submit, a suggestion that prayer may replace sacrifice as a mode of worship, as the later Jewish tradition has interpreted this passage, followed by some modern scholars. Rather, the statement emphasizes that a pledge of loyalty to the Lord is more efficacious than sacrificing bulls! Such a pledge might be expressed in the very words of this oracle, the words of vv. 3b-4 and 9. All who are wise and intelligent</page><page sequence="14">156 BOOK REVIEWS (.dkham, ncbh6n) realize that this is what the Lord truly desires from His people. Once again, diction suggests a link between Hosea and Deuteron- omy.9 III Most of Ginsberg's monograph actually deals with the transmission of proto-Deuteronomy into Judah, and with assessing its eventual impact there. Ginsberg's reconstruction of the development of the annual festivals is a major breakthrough in itself. His treatment of the Josianic edicts is inci- sive. He explains how Hezekiah, in his own time, was motivated by the doc- trine of proto-Deuteronomy, and how, in a later generation, Josiah revived this doctrine, and ordered major changes in religious life, adapted to the Judean situation of the late seventh century B.C.E. The Addenda which Ginsberg provides attest to his magnificent obses- sion with philology and exegesis, and further elucidate the relationship between the priestly source of the Torah and the Book of Ezekiel. The purpose of this review essay was to attempt an explanation of Gins- berg's "equations," as I called them at the outset. My understanding of them may differ from what Ginsberg himself had in mind, but I have tried to convey, at least, what one student has learned from his teacher. More study of royal policy as it affected religious life in the northern kingdom of Israel during the eighth century B.C.E. is certainly required. Nevertheless, I am pre- pared to accept Ginsberg's principal hypothesis: Originally, the program stated in Deuteronomy 12 constituted a response to the situation which obtained in the northern Israel of the mid- to late eighth century B.C.E., before the Assyrian invasion A word should be said, in conclusion, about the long-term effects of the restriction of sacred space ordered by Josiah, less than half a century before the final destruction of the First Temple of Jerusalem, an edict ultimately based on the doctrine of proto-Deuteronomy. To understand the relevance of Josiah's edicts for the Judean exiles in Babylonia, one should read Ezekiel 20 closely. The single, legitimate temple in Jerusalem was relevant to the hope of national restoration to the Land of 9. Note this diction in Gen. 41:33, 39, which represents northern Israelite writing (the work of the Elohist), and in Deuteronomistic sources such as Deut. 4:6, I Kings 3:12, Jer. 9:11.</page><page sequence="15">BOOK REVIEWS 157 Israel. An exiled people whose religious fulfillment depended on access to Jerusalem would be less likely to abandon its hope of return! The Jewish communities of the Diaspora were to establish alternative types of religious institutions, such as synagogues; but with relatively few exceptions, these communities were to consider sacrificial worship improper in the lands of exile. After all, they had been taught that the God of Israel had ordered their ancestors, as they were about to enter Canaan, to limit worship and celebration to the single mdqdm which He would select as the unique locus of His earthly presence. To Judeans, this meant the site of the Temple in Jerusalem. Baruch A. Levine New York University New York, N.Y.</page></plain_text>
