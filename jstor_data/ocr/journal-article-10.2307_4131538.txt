Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 2002. xxvii, 399 pp. This is a translation and slight modification ofDat ve-Ziyyonut: Imutim Ris- honim (1990), a Hebrew collection of articles previously published by Yosef Salmon. In this English volume, some sections of the Hebrew edition were omit- 376</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews ted, some were altered, and two recent articles were added. The thirteen articles ad- dress the period from 1818 (the writings of Hatam Sofer) until 1922 (the founding of Ha-Po'el ha-Mizrachi) and ask how religious Jews-especially those who were drawn toward the hope of restoring the Jewish people to Zion-dealt with the chal- lenges presented by the increasingly secular Jewish national movement. This ques- tion is at the center of Salmon's body of research on East European Zionism. Salmon fixes his gaze on the elite: rabbis who were vying with each other to lead the Zionist movement toward tangible success without compromising reli- gious ideals, religious figures who wielded influence in the Yishuv, and secular or less religious Zionist activists. He focuses on the junctures in the history of Hib- bat Zion that required policy decisions in which religious tradition would be hon- ored, transformed, or breached. Such junctures were frequent during the 1880s and 1890s, when secularized Jews began to advocate for mass migration to Palestine and to agitate for educational and cultural reforms that would prepare young Jews for a country of their own. Some religious leaders looked approvingly at the mod- ification of religious norms-for example, the adoption of agricultural labor by Ashkenazic newcomers to Palestine and the concomitant diminution of the ideal of the Torah scholar wholly supported by the donations of Diaspora Jews. Every compromise and acceptance of change by Hibbat Zion religious leaders enabled them to keep their hand in the directorship of the movement, but also brought down upon them harsh rabbinic denunciations and the loss of support from religious Jews. Reading Salmon's articles, one gets the impression that the disunity of the rabbinic leadership, the anti-Zionism of key rabbis, and the immense difficulty of reconciling religious tradition and nationalism led to the erosion of religious in- fluence in the Zionist movement. A more balanced examination of the growing sec- ularism of Zionism would require attention to factors beyond the religious world: the Russian political and legal realities that affected the movement, as well as the relative importance of its regional centers; the concerns of ordinary Hibbat Zion members and contributors; the social and economic environment inhabited by the settlers; the greater organizational skills of secular Jews; the advantages that a sec- ular approach conferred in directing the transformation of the Yishuv, and so on. The narrowness of Salmon's focus could be excused, however, were it not for his neglect of basic research conventions. He is noticeably remiss in embed- ding his work within existing scholarship-the studies by Jonathan Frankel, Joseph Goldstein, and Ehud Luz come to mind. In Salmon's articles, the reader learns of the viewpoint of a historical figure through paraphrase and summary, and the footnotes typically include only a reference to the primary source material; the reader lacks longer quotations from the original work, references to other research, and solid evidence for why Salmon attributes a particular motive for or agenda be- hind the individual's stated beliefs. For example, Salmon propounds the view (in Chapters 1 and 2) that Zevi Hirsch Kalischer arrived at his messianic ideology in reaction to the Reform movement's rejection of messianic concepts (in Chapter 3 he makes the same claim for David Gordon). He has little evidence to support this conclusion and does not mention the work of scholars who show otherwise. In con- trast, when Gideon Shimoni discusses Kalischer's messianism in The Zionist Ide- 377</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews ology (1995), he credits Salmon for suggesting the influence of Reform, as well as the opposing viewpoint expounded in my own research and in the groundbreaking study of Kalischer by Jacob Katz. The reader is informed of the basic scholarship, the different explanations, and Shimoni's perspective. Salmon also tends to be reductionist. In Chapter 2, he assesses the reaction of "traditional Jewry" to Kolonisations- Verein fuer Palaestina by surveying the opinions expressed by the editors and contributors to the Hebrew press (particu- larly Ha-Maggid, Ha-Mevasser, and Ha-Levanon). He assumes that each press represents a well-defined ideology or interest group, which together comprise the bulk of religious Jewry. Had he considered the scholarship on the Hebrew press, he would have described a more complex picture. Salmon incorporates his own in- terpretations in his summaries of editorials and opinion pieces without designat- ing them as such. Oddly enough, Salmon neglects to provide the reader with tools he himself has generated. In his article (Chapter 7) on the pro-Hibbat Zion tract Shivat Ziyy- on, he provides some historical background and then generalizes about the opin- ions expressed in the book, without referring to the new edition of Shivat Ziyyon issued in 1998, for which he wrote an introduction, notes, and indices. Despite those problems, Salmon's articles arouse the reader's interest in the subject. The most useful and original material in the volume deals with the last two decades of the nineteenth century (Chapters 4-11), and these are a good starting point for further research.
