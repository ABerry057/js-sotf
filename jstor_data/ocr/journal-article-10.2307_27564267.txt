Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 2005. xiv, 383 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000293 This how-to book starts by describing the historical-critical method as a fundamentally neutral approach to text, but it quickly frames part of its task as showing the utility of this method for contemporary religionists. Marc Zvi Brettler holds that the critical method "greatly enriches the text, and allows us to recover a vibrant civilization over two millennia old." His historical-critical reading method is intended to help the lay person discern developments and trends within biblical reli gion and society, as well as subsequent Jewish history. Only with a critical method "can these different voices be fully heard and appreciated" (5). Perhaps less popular among scholars will be Brettler's conviction that the understanding derived from this reading exercise "allows us to understand ourselves" (5), an idea that is no less integral to the book's plan than the concern for critical methodology. Unlike most standard introductions, Brettler does not survey the entire Tanakh piece by piece. Rather, he structures his book around passages that are illustrative of various genres, literary, ideological, social, and textual issues. The goal is to help the reader develop reading skills that, in effect, will prepare him or her to confidently approach passages beyond those Brettler has space to eluci date. As Brettler explains, historical-critical methods enable us to understand the text as the biblical reader would have, and that requires engaging the reading mies of the ancient Israelite. After setting up the needed background, twenty one chapters (Chap. 5-26) expose his target audience?the curious adult?to reading strategies that are relevant to historiography, myth, source criticism, law, the development of cult and religion, intertextual phenomena, prophecy and biblical poetry, wisdom literature, and canon. Evaluated strictly for its pedagogic focus?and this is fundamentally a teach ing book?Brettler's writing is nothing less than masterful. He leads the reader through an array of complexities with remarkable clarity, cogent analogies, and admirable sophistication appropriately calibrated to his audience's needs. He never overwhelms the reader with unfiltered information, as he sensitively intuits what is sufficient to make his pedagogic point. Especially satisfying is his readiness to explore the edges of what can be asserted with confidence, frequently leaving unresolved issues open so as to illustrate?sometimes implicitly but often expli citly?the limits of our hermeneutic. Brettler's paradigm moves away from introdu cing information for its own sake toward pairing information with a reading method. The effect is to empower readers and, in the process, to challenge serious teaching scholars to rethink the role of an introduction to Bible in their own pedagogy. I wish to raise two closely related critical concerns, but first I want to empha size that neither detracts from the superb pedagogic units offered by Brettler; rather, both relate to the broader framing of those units. The book aspires to meld historical-critical scholarship with the practice of Judaism. The core teaching chapters are bracketed between the opening section, "Reading as a Jew and as a Scholar," and the afterword, "Reading the Bible as a Committed Jew." Brettler claims that this book is the first "Jewishly sensitive introduction to the 173</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews historical-critical method," but the "Jewishly sensitive" part of this work is essen tially relegated to the final four pages, where he discusses "how the historical-critical method can help contemporary Jews relate to the Bible as a religious text in a more meaningful way" (5). As it is, the chapters proceed without any clear link to "the practice of Judaism," even in the context of subjects as controversial as women in Judaism (Chap. 27 on Esther and Ruth ends with little more than a cheeky role-play) and theodicy (Chap. 25 on Job ends with an apologia). In the after word?just shy of five pages?Brettler shares his personal proclivity to "adopt some [biblical] texts as more meaningful to [him] than others" while transforming the plethora of voices found in Tanakh "into a more monolithic book" for Jewish living. Making such personal choices, he tells us, includes balancing the needs and thinking of community, "like-minded friends, or an extended family," as he emphasizes the social role that text has in defining a religiously self-identified group. The keen sophistication at the core of this book fades to a faint shadow of itself in the all-too-brief afterword. Perhaps this is indeed the first how-to-read the Bible introduction that self-consciously engages historical-critical thinking in a "Jewishly sensitive" manner (whatever that means). But given the fact that scholars since the early nineteenth century have endeavored to provide a basis for integrating critical thinking with all of Jewish literature, history, and ritual (not just Tanakh), the claim deserves better contextualization. In July 1841, Abraham Geiger wrote that his work "both scholarly and prac tical centers in the effort to produce a Judaism that would be alive, truly spiritual, and satisfying and nourishing to both mind and soul." He feared that scholars of Judaica would "withdraw into their field of scholarship and be utterly lost for all the practical ends of Judaism, dejectedly observing the scene from afar, like Zunz." His Urschrift und ?bersetzungen der Bibel in ihrer Abh?ngigkeit von der Innern Entwickelung des Judenthums (Breslau, 1857) is nothing if not "Jew ishly sensitive," although the practical application of his critical findings appeared mostly in lectures and articles published from them until the end of his life (1864). Although our data pool and methods have changed significantly since Geiger 's day, those questions about how to integrate scientific methods with religious prac tice have been approached by scholars and lay people in each subsequent gener ation. In effect, there are many paradigms available for this pursuit, but none seems to have influenced the content or structure of Brettler's composition.2 1.

Geiger's understanding of scripture and Talmud were integrated into every aspect of his beliefs about Jewish practice. On his attitude toward liturgy, see David Ellenson, After Emancipation: Jewish Religious Responses to Modernity (Cincinnati, OH: Hebrew Union College Press, 2004), Chapter 9. 2. Among twentieth-century writers, only Mordecai Kaplan is mentioned (337 n. 3). A recent impressive attempt to provide an integrated approach to Jewish practice can be found in two volumes by Arnold M. Eisen: Taking Hold of Torah: Jewish Commitment and Community in America (Blooming ton: Indiana University Press, 1997); and Rethinking Modern Judaism: Ritual, Commandment, Com munity (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1998). 174</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews A second concern stems from Brettler's treatment of ongoing controversies in biblical scholarship. This serves as the backbone for his whole historical-critical endeavor. After surveying trends within twentieth-century historiographie approaches?from "historical fundamentalism" through the so-called Copenhagen School?Brettler offers the lay reader what he calls "a reasonable middle position," which is that "the Bible may be used, with significant caution, as a source for ancient history, just like any other ancient document" (21 ; emphasis added). But since when is tmth (or the "best reading") the result of a compromise based on the geography of intellectual extremes? And why should the "middle" (wherever that is) constitute a "reasonable position" simply by being in the middle? Brettler grants that the Bible includes myth and that stories as central as the Exodus from Egypt "did not happen" (279), but he avoids a concrete treatment of how this critically derived "tmth" should influence our uses of biblical literature, whether it is for the sake of recon structing "history" or shaping religious practice. Historiography is only part of the quotient. Labeling Deuteronomy "a pious fraud" (85) (a literary genre of sorts), does not actually diminish its fraudulence or its fictional character, nor does its alleged "piety" quell a person's urge to ask, "Why should a fraudulent docu ment serve as the backbone of a tmth-seeking religion, or the writing of history, or in shaping a life of religious engagement?" Such a question is neither asked nor answered in this book, even though the book is supposed to integrate critical methods and religious concerns. Scripture's authority depends on the strategies that transformed it from literature into a divinely sanctioned historiography. Remove that ideological overlay and the alleged value of scripture becomes nothing more than an ethnocentric essentialism based on delusional assertions of uniqueness, which in some fundamental way contradict historical-critical assess ments of origins. These tensions are neither defined nor explored. In this postmodernist age, there is reason to wonder if trust in the historical-criti cal method as a tool for enhancing applied religion?rather than other literary tools? doesn't parallel Mark Twain's description of Eve's trust in the animals: "She trusts them all, they all trust her; and because she wouldn't betray them, she thinks they won't betray her."3 Well, the rest, at least with regard to Eve, is, as we say, "history." Had Brettler only set out to write a how-to book, there would be very little to criticize here. The pairing of Brettler's prodigious skills as a pedagogue with his strong and emdite readings of biblical passages leaves us with a work every that teacher of Tanakh can comfortably require of his or her students. That is, take away the two issues just elucidated, and we are left with the heart of this volume, in which there dwells an admirable scholarly and pedagogic soul. David H.
