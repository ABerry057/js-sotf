<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jay M. Harris. Nachman Krochnmal: Guiding the Perplexed of the Modern Age. New York: New York University Press, 1991. xvi, 336 pp. Jay M. Harris's Nachman Krochmnal: Guiding the Perplexed of the Modern Age is an authoritative treatment of Krochmal's The Guide of the Perplexed of the Time. With remarkable fluency in Krochmal's multilayered Judaic, Germanic, and Galician environments, Harris superbly renders the processes by which his subject crafted an intellectual shield for Judaism to ward off assaults from disparate quarters. Krochmal labored with the scholarly instruments of nineteenth-century Central Europe, and Harris interprets this significant, but unfinished and problematic book through the history of ideas. Harris's title, as well as that of Krochmal's work, is misleading. Both books are principally designed for observant Jews-not generically "perplexed" Jews-who wish to engage in secular discourse to defend rabbinic Judaism. In Krochmal's treatise "the fundamental elements of traditional Jewish thought remain: God as an instructor in faith through revelation; the authenticity and antiquity of the oral law; the inspired leadership of the Great Assembly, Pharisees, and rabbis; the qualitative distinction between Judaism and all other religions, despite acknowledgment of some common elements; Israel as the light unto the nations; the eternity of Israel" (p. 320). Especially in his imaginative discussion of Krochmal's possible evaluation of attempts by later Jewish thinkers to balance the religious and secular in the era since his own time, Harris's veneration of Krochmal is unabashed. Although Harris exposes several of Krochmal's egregious errors in disputation, he prizes Krochmal as</page><page sequence="2">94 BOOK REVIEWS a singularly outstanding champion of this difficult exercise. Clearly, Harris's book will best be used by scholars who seek a learned exegesis of a modern text that is nevertheless an apologia for halakhah and belief in "rabbinic Judaism as a profound and theologically advanced tradition" (pp. 282-283), intimating "that there is no conflict between Judaism and modern historical and philosophical thought (p. 25). A notable aspect of this book is its placement of Krochmal in a specifically Galician context to account for the influences of his worldview and his circumscribed expectations for Jewish assimilation. Harris details Krochmal's stance regarding the increasingly powerful Hasidic movement, whose anti-intellectualism and superstitiousness presented obstacles to Jew- ish self-understanding and Gentile acceptance of Judaism's respectability. Although Krochmal's Guide is largely a conservative reaction to German- Protestant criticism, his "hatred of Hasidism" (p. 12) and other forms of "religious decadence" (p. 17) is no small factor motivating his project. After describing the composition of the Guide, Harris explores the book's main issues. He details Krochmal's attempt "to clarify the central metaphysical positions of Judaism" to uncover "their latent philosophical content" (p. 45), stemming primarily from an urge to insulate Judaism from modern philo- sophical critiques. Refering to Hegel, Schelling, Ibn Ezra, Spinoza, and the philosophes, Harris reconstructs Krochmal's (sometimes farfetched) marriage of Judaism and philosophy against German idealism, the Enlightenment, and "extremist" Jewish thought. In so doing, Krochmal not only protects the Jews but exalts them as "the bearers of a unique consciousness" (p. 81). Perhaps here Krochmal is closer to Moses Mendelssohn than the author acknowledges, but in other instances Harris indicates where Krochmal intersects with or departs from Mendelssohn's thought. The principal task of "Krochmal's Theory of History" (chap. 3) is to prove that Judaism is not "a relic," which for Harris is one of Krochmal's less satisfying endeavors. "Krochmal remained committed to the essential program of the Deuteronomist, insisting on the relationship between one's faith in God and historical destiny" (p. 131); he argued in favor of Jewry's moral superiority over the Gentiles, asserting that "Jewish faith is unique and absolute" (p. 135), that Jewry is "exempt from the law of demise" (ibid.), and that "their spiritual essence remains beyond time, even as their external spiritual institutions are subject to it" (p. 135). Despite the legend to the contrary, Harris writes that Krochmal was not</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 95 an important biblical critic (chap. 4). Interestingly, halfway into the book comes the first instance in which Harris characterizes his subject's work as "apologetic" (p. 159). The critics, however, had too much hard evidence to allow Krochmal's apologia to hold up; one exception to his often "im- plausible" argumentation is his study of selected psalms. On "The Rabbinic Tradition" (chap. 5), Krochmal applies "recent historical scholarship" to "properly categorize the legal materials of the rabbinic corpus" and uses "the critical historical method to affirm the basic integrity" of rabbinism (p. 226). Not surprisingly, he produces "a highly partisan presentation" (p. 234) in which rabbinic historical claims are typically unquestioned. Here Harris introduces Krochmal's notion of the ahistoricity of the Torah, and his tendentious argument that the Israelite religion and rabbinism are parts of an interwoven whole. The final chapter investigates Krochmal's attempt to wrestle with a body in Judaism that could not be squashed into into any modem intellectual category-the aggadah. Krochmal tries to prove that some of the aggadot have pedagogical purposes, and are therefore efficacious, while other aggadot are superfluous-if not embarrassing-and should be disinherited. In the face of patently antirational sources, the pitfalls of Krochmal's approach are glaringly evident. Still, Harris's explanation of why his subject's polemics on this issue should interest us is lively and provocative. Overall, through his skillful discussion of Krochmal's text and his world, Harris has indeed provided "an important picture of the intellectual disorientation wrought by modernity" (p. 315). To a lesser degree, a similar disorientation apparently besets the author. In a revealing moment, Harris tells us that "I cannot help but feel that modern Judaism will continue to drift aimlessly or take refuge in fideism if it cannot resolve-for itself-the problem of historical relativism, and self-confidently affirm a transcendent and binding set of principles" (p. 319). Insomuch as the reader is likewise moved, he or she will find Krochmal and his current interpreter relevant and compelling. Michael Berkowitz Ohio State University Columbus, Ohio</page></plain_text>
