<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME USES OF JUSTIFICATION IN JEWISH EDUCATION by WALTER I. ACKERMAN Ben Gurion University of the Negev The justification of plans and programs is a necessary condition of the relationship between systems of education, both obligatory and voluntary, and the publics they serve. Those who are responsible for the conduct of the educational enterprise in general and the schooling of the young in par- ticular must provide those who support the system, financially and otherwise, with acceptable and defensible reasons for the efforts and ac- tivities of the schools. The idea of justification in education rests on the as- sumption that the process of schooling, whatever its form and content, is subject to rational control and that the authority for the conduct of schools is derived from the principles inherent in the justification offered. A pro- ferred justification is most effective and likely of acceptance when the posi- tions it generates on educational issues fit the general fabric of ideals and aspirations of the society to which it is addressed. If, as we believe, justifica- tion is a necessary part of the rhetoric which surrounds legislatively deter- mined and state maintained school systems-i.e., systems whose right to ex- istence is not subject to question or doubt in any modern society and where attendance is required by law-then it follows that it is of even greater significance for voluntary school systems which lack the coercive power of their governmental counterparts-i.e., Jewish education. The growth and development of the American public school provide in- 1</page><page sequence="2">2 WALTER I. ACKERMAN structive examples in the uses of justification.' Historians of American education have noted that the acknowledgment of the right of every child to a continually elevated minimum of schooling and the practical expression of that principle in an ever widening network of schools of various levels were achieved only as schoolmen and their supporters were able to offer argu- ments which outweighed the apathy of the indifferent and countered the op- position and resistance of those who, among others, were unwilling to bear the burden of increased taxation explicit in the acceptance of public educa- tion or were committed to elitist conceptions of school and society. The schools of colonial America were created, first of all, to safeguard the cultural heritage brought from the mother country. But more than that, as Bernard Bailyn has noted, the conditions of life in the wilderness of early America affected both the stability of the family and the authority of com- munal and religious institutions. Publicly supported schools were conceived as the substitute for the once constraining influence of home, church, and community.2 This function of schooling, new to those whose prior ex- perience of education had been limited to the English model of the seventeenth century, is clearly reflected in the early educational laws of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.3 A later period in American life brought with it the necessity of refining the original purposes of schooling and introduced the idea that the schools of America were the instrument for the develop- ment of a uniquely American character rooted in a morality which was the legitimization of established authority. Noah Webster, writing in the early years of the Republic, notes that "our constitutions of civil government are not yet firmly established: our national character is not yet formed" and exhorts his countrymen to recognize the need for "systems of Educa- tion .., .which may not only diffuse a knowledge of the sciences but may implant, in the midst of American youth, the principles of virtue and liberty; and inspire them just and liberal of government, and with an inviolable at- tachment to their country .... ."4 The implications of this form of justifica- tion were strikingly apparent to Tocqueville who observed that "in the 1.

The great reformers of nineteenth-century American education justified their efforts by appealing to the self-interest of the native population: .. Unless we educate our immigrants they will be our ruin. It is no longer a mere question of benevolence, of duty or of enlightened self-interest, but the intellectual and religious training of our foreign population has become essen- tial to our own safety; we are prompted to it by the instinct of self- preservation.... It is altogether essential to our national strength and peace, if not even to our national existence, that the foreigners who settle on our soil, should cease to be Europeans and become Americans .... It is necessary that they become substantially Anglo-American .... The most effectual, and in- deed the only effectual way, to produce this ... national feeling and character, is to bring our children into the same schools and have them educated together.... The public schools should be our best schools, and possess a character sufficiently elevated to secure the patronage of the influential and wealthy, that all children of our republic may be educated together. This would be our strongest national aegis, the surest palladium of our country ... .6 The examples of justification noted above reflect the changes that took place in the thinking of Americans regarding their schools in the period that stretched from the early days of settlement in New England to the time just before the Civil War and the beginnings of national maturity. The varied reasons given for the expansion and continued development of the public schools are more than fillips of educational ideologies, although at times they are just that. They are essentially an expression of the changes in American life brought about in the transition from the relatively simple societal organization of the homogeneous colonial population to the far more complicated and intricate patterns of the burgeoning industrialized urban society which was the America known to the masses of immigrants of disparate cultures and traditions who populated the cities and worked the 5.

ACKERMAN factories. The idea that schools are affected and should somehow respond to the changing nature of society is a philosophical statement which guides all aspects of the educational endeavor. Together with other fundamental propositions, it provides an underpinning for the formulation of aims and objectives and thereby influences teacher training, curriculum development, the organization of the schools and the evaluation of pupil achievement. The expectations of those who support the educational enterprise and, even more important, of those who are its clients, are set and determined by the justification offered for the objectives of schooling. In this paper we propose to examine some of the justifications used by American Jewish educators in their efforts to develop a system of Jewish education in the United States. Our starting point is the middle of the nineteenth century, that period in American Jewish history which first saw a recognizable Jewish settlement in the country. Wherever possible we have attempted to relate the arguments for Jewish education to events in the larger American setting. The material brought here is not intended to be ex- haustive; we have limited our study to certain personalities and postures not because of any predilection or bias in favor of their views to the exclusion of others but rather because their positions appear to us to have been both representative and central to the evolution of several of the more significant patterns of practice in American Jewish education during the period under survey. II Traditional Judaism requires no justification for the education of children other than that contained in the divine imperative, "Take to heart these words with which I charge you this day. Impress them upon your child- ren" (Deuteronomy 6:6,7). These verses repeated in the daily liturgy and amplified by continuous commentary, are the foundations upon which was developed a pattern of formal education which, woven as it was into the tightly knit fabric of home, synagogue, and community, insured the trans- mission of Jewish culture across the generations. The idea of learning which guided the traditional Jewish school was the study and mastery of Sacred Scripture and its adumbration in the limitless "sea of the Talmud." Despite some important exceptions, notably among the Jews of medieval Spain and their descendants, Jewish education then was religious education in which secular studies were, at best, only a tool for better understanding Holy Writ. Classical Jewish education, however, was already under attack even before the arrival of large numbers of Jews in America. The blandishments</page><page sequence="5">JUSTIFICATION IN JEWISH EDUCATION 5 of modernism and the desire to reach out into the world which surrounded the ghetto had prompted "enlightened" German Jews to seek new forms of education for their children. David Friedlander, who at the end of the eighteenth century was a leader in the struggle of German Jews for equal rights and whose religious views were a harbinger of Reform Judaism, founded the Beit Sefer Hinnukh Ne'arim in Berlin with the avowed inten- tion of providing its pupils with a secular education. In response to an in- quiry about his school Friedlander could write, "My friend you must choose one of two things: either you must educate your son to take his place among the "chosen"-that is, you must educate him to believe that we are a chosen people and that the study of Torah is superior to all the wisdom of the West and that it is forbidden to take a German book in hand. Or you will educate him for the world in which we live and leave him without any knowledge of Gemara .... This is the spirit of our times; we Jews no longer live in a separate quarter and the opera rather than the cantor and a modern aria rather than prayer nourish the soul .... Our traditional ways are no longer compatible with the times . . . ." 7 Friedlander ultimately came to the view that Jewish children should attend governmental schools together with their non-Jewish peers and that Jewish education should be limited to a sup- plementary school which would provide catechismal instruction in the fun- damentals of the Jewish religion. The first Jewish schools in America, founded and maintained by syn- agogues in keeping with the pattern of church sponsored education which was prevalent at the time, offered their students a curriculum which com- bined both religious and secular studies. Congregation Shearith Israel of New York, for example, engaged a teacher in 1762 "to keep a public school in the Hebrew, to teach the Hebrew language, and translate the same into English, also to teach English Reading Writing and Cyphering."8 The forms of schooling adopted by American Jews in the years between the end of the eighteenth century and the middle of the nineteenth-day schools affiliated with synagogues, private academies, Sunday Schools and private instruc- tion, all of them Jewish counterparts of the educational institutions of the larger community-were neither intended nor able to recreate in the United States that type of learned Jew who was the ideal of the traditional educa- tion.

ACKERMAN great centers of Jewish learning in Europe was accelerated by the rise of the public school. The American commitment to the free common school impressed an indelible stamp on Jewish education and made all but in- evitable the pattern of supplementary schools which till this day is the domi- nant form of Jewish schooling in the United States. Few indeed were the Jews who hesitated to send their children to the public schools, whatever the consequences for Jewish education. Unlike the Catholics who waged a bitter, if futile, struggle against the non-sectarian Protestantism of the common school9 and finally felt compelled to establish their own independent school system, the overwhelming majority of Jews in mid-nineteenth century America welcomed the opportunity provided by the public school and were among its most ardent supporters.' Even statements such as that of Horace Mann-"Our system earnestly inculcates all the Christian morals; it founds its morals on the basis of religion.",-which reflected the influence and power of the Protestant establishment in the con- duct of local school systems, did not stem the stream of Jewish children entering the public schools. Isidor Busch, an immigrant Jew who fled Europe after the revolution of 1848 and soon after his settlement there became a prominent figure in the Jewish and public life of St. Louis, un- doubtedly found much support when he called upon his fellow Jews to "sup- port as much as you can the public school system and lend no help whatever to sectarian institutions." To those Jews, clearly a minority, who still favored separate Jewish schools, Busch would say, "Should our children be educated as Jews only or even as foreigners in language and spirit, or shall they be educated as Americans, as citizens of the same free country, to be with them one harmonious people; or should we ourselves foster that unfor- tunate prejudice that pressed so many bitter, burning tears from most of us, and from our fathers in the old country? Answer yourselves which system will do the one, and which must result in the other?" 2 Busch's own position was unequivocal: "The common welfare, the interests of the whole people, the safety of our republic demand of us to be in favor of public as opposed 9.

Among those who accepted the challenge, perhaps the most persistent and in- defatigable was the Rev. Isaac Leeser. From the pulpit of Congregation Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia, in the pages of the Occident, a periodical of which he was publisher and editor, in the textbooks he wrote and published, and in sermons and lectures delivered in the major Jewish centers of the time, Leeser waged a determined and unrelenting struggle for the grounding and improvement of Jewish education in the United States. During the years of his service to the Jewish community Leeser developed a many-leveled argument in support of Jewish education. As a traditional Jew he was, of course, impelled, first and foremost, by the divine command. Leeser, however, was practical enough to understand that in the circumstances of his time and place the weight of tradition was no longer as compelling a force among Jews as it had once been. In attempting to con- vince Jews of the importance of Jewish education he resorted to a series of assertions which appealed as much to elemental instincts for survival as to religious and theological sensibilities. While Jewish education was surely in- tended "to awaken in the young a spirit of devotion and piety" as well as "a desire to serve their Maker,""5 it was also calculated to stem disaffection from the Jewish people. Those who are indifferent to Jews and Judaism behave as they do, according to Leeser, as the "result of ignorance";'6 those who have converted to other faiths have done so "because of improper education";'7 and those whose behavior causes alarm require "education of the heart.. . to direct and restrain"'8-an influence beyond the power of secular education.

ACKERMAN somehow at odds with the fulfilment of obligations to their newly adopted country, Leeser could claim that religious instruction meant the inculcation of love "not only for that country in which we were born, but also and chief- ly that in which we enjoy the liberty of person, security of property and benefit of laws enacted for the common welfare.""9 Judaism, maintained Leeser, not only teaches love of country but also imposes the obligation to do "whatever may benefit the country ... pay due deference to laws. .. pay taxes, be obedient to authorities.., .hurry to its defense."20 The proper respect for law and authority seems to have occupied Leeser as much as it did non-Jewish educators of the time. The obsession with "punctuality, regularity, attention and silence" which characterized the thinking of the professional administrators who rose to ascendancy in American education during the nineteenth century2' was shared by Leeser. If religious education meant instilling the "fear of God" in the hearts of young scholars, it also meant that they "ought to treat their teachers with the utmost possible respect; they ought to get well the lessons that are given them to study; they ought to be early at school; and have their clothes always clean and tidy; they ought to sit quietly and still during school hours and listen with the strictest attention to whatever is taught them; if the teachers reprove them, they should not look sullen or angry much less give an impertinent answer; when the teachers have to use punishment, they should submit with becoming patience; .. . no scholar should ever get angry or displeased if the teachers reward a deserving fellow scholar, for such reward should stimulate the others to excel likewise, but should be no cause for envy and bitter feeling."22 These views place Leeser well within the company of those whose ideas shaped the educational practice of that period. Theirs was a position which held that the child was an incorrigible who required the strictest discipline to prevent his own undoing and the ruination of civilization; that the teacher was the embodiment of the norms and values of the society which employed him; and that the school, the place where child and society first meet, was the training ground for the maintenance of the existing social order. School, therefore, was more than a place which transmitted information and developed rudimentary skills; it was the setting which instilled that par- 19.

Leeser's vision of Jewish education was hardly rooted in an educational philosophy which could lead to a school radically different from the public school. Like generations of American Jewish educators after him, Leeser drew his ideas about education from sources outside of the tradition he sought to perpetuate and the Jewish school he describes23 is similar in every respect but its subject matter to the non-Jewish schools all about him. His justification of a separate Jewish school was, among other things, based on the conviction that a strictly secular education was incapable of inculcating those qualities of mind and heart which were the irreducible elements of good citizenship. The logic of that position could easily lead to the conclu- sion that not only was there no conflict between one's adherence to Judaism and a loyalty to American ideals but rather that the religiously educated Jew was a better American. Much of Leeser's energy was devoted to attempts to introduce a sense of common purpose and unity into the chaotic conditions which characterized Jewish life of the period. He was perceptive enough to understand that Judaism could not survive, let alone flourish, in America unless there were created those institutions and agencies which are the hallmarks of a genuine community. Here was yet another function to be performed by Jewish education: "No doubt many deplore the little union there is among us; but a community of education will excite a community of feeling and when this is achieved, we may then proceed to unite harmoniously to develop our religion on a firm and secure base."24 Leeser's commitment to the development of a community coupled with his firm belief in the truth of traditional Judaism placed him in the forefront of those who opposed Reform Judaism. The teachings of Reform were for Leeser both divisive and false. He claimed that the spread of Reform Judaism was the result not of a considered examination of its tenets but rather of ignorance. The leaders of Reform, particularly Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, were successful in their efforts to attract followers only because poorly educated Jews "yield to those they think learned, without examining for themselves, and accept the doubtful counsels of their ministers, no matter what these may be .... If the people were properly instructed, if they had 23. Occident 9, no. 2 (May 1851). 24. Occident 2, no. 9 (December 1867).</page><page sequence="10">10 WALTER I. ACKERMAN studied carefully the simple word of God, they would not so easily be led cap- tive"25 (Italics mine). Education would guarantee that the public would ar- rive at a true understanding of Judaism and perforce give the lie to the proponents of Reform. Not even the biting sarcasm which Leeser used in at- tacking Wise could hide his profound faith in the power of education: In a letter we received ... a report of a Kahal meeting is conveyed ... in these words: "A majority has decided that we expect a Messiah and a restoration of Palestine! Thank you gentlemen in the name of the son of David; thank you in the name of the Prophets. But can want of education go further? A minister, not the most famous for learning comes with the new bantling, in which Mes- siah and resurrection are struck out; and the people instead of telling him to attend to his own efforts, to teach the religion for the promulgation of which he ought alone to have been chosen, gravely proceed to a vote .... We com- plain of the want of information among the people, that they permit such a question to come before them and we urge, therefore, that they use every effort to promote a healthy education among themselves, convinced that then only can we act understandingly and if it brings the triumph of Reform we should not complain; but we do not imagine this possible . . . .26 Leeser's justification of Jewish education was sharpest when he argued the merits of a separate Jewish school which offered a combined curriculum of Jewish and general studies. He was convinced that Sunday Schools, after- noon and evening schools, and all other forms of supplementary education were simply inadequate to the task of transmitting any sort of meaningful understanding of Judaism. Leeser's own experience in Philadelphia led him to oppose Busch's plea for the primacy of the public school and the relega- tion of Jewish education to a secondary role played out on weekends, after- noons, and evenings. The restrained tone of his response-"Mr. Busch ... underrates the difficulties of evening religious schools. The mode of in- structing children in the Hebrew etc. in the extra hours, has been tried and has signally failed"27-does not altogether reflect the force of his feeling. Leeser's support of the type of school known today as a day school, a school in which "it is not to be a secondary matter whether the child learns Hebrew and religion,"28 was rooted in his sense of what was required for in- 25.

His admiration of the United States, repeatedly expressed in editorials and sermons, did not blind him to the fact that, even in the freedom of the new republic, Jewish children were subject to "open or secret attack against the religion of their fathers."29 Years before Busch's appeal to Jews to forego separate Jewish schools in favor of the public school, Leeser had pointedly warned parents that Jewish children who attend public school "hear prayers recited in which the name of a mediator is involved; they hear a book read as an authority equal if not superior to the received word of God. . . . We are in great error if we suppose that Christian teachers do not endeavor to in- fluence the sentiments of their Jewish pupils; there are some at least, who take especial pains to warp the mind and to implant the peculiar tenets of Christianity. ...."30 A proper Jewish education, possible only in a school responsible for the total education of the child, would not only remove youngsters from the damaging influence of overzealous Christian teachers but would also provide them with "a conscious dignity" and "a becoming pride in the name of Jew."31 The Jewish school thus conceived was more than a place which taught the information and skills necessary for life as an observant Jew; it was to be the institution which so shaped the character of the child as to place him beyond the "approach of a contrary conviction"32 and make him "proof against the open and silent attacks of those differing from us . . and firm in the profession of the lineage and faith of Israel, though alone in the midst of thousands."33 A review of the various functions assigned to the school by Leeser tells as much about his understanding of what was happening to Jews in America as it does about his views on education. It is clear that in his mind the school was henceforth to be the central and critical institution of Jewish life. The Jewish school was that place in which both the mind and heart of the Jewish child were to receive their definitive form. The importance ascribed to for- mal schooling reflects the decline of the influence of the family and the com- munity in the developing Judaism of the younger generation. The forming of the child as a Jew, formerly a partnership between home, school and com- munity, was now relegated largely to the school. That transfer of respon- 29. Occident 4, no. 2 (May 1846). 30.

ACKERMAN sibility, a hallmark of modern society whose imprint was sharpened even further by the complementary processes of industrialization and urbaniza- tion which defined much of life in nineteenth century America, placed the Jewish school in the impossible position of attempting to preserve that which had been rejected by its natural and necessary partners. The proponents of a combination of public school and supplementary Jewish religious schools received vigorous and sustained support from Rab- bi Isaac Mayer Wise, the "father" of Reform Judaism in America. Wise's privileged position as a rabbi, first in Albany and then in Cincinnati, together with his considerable gifts as a journalist and teacher placed him in the forefront of those who insisted on the necessity of Jewish participation in the public schools. His commitment to the common school expressed itself, among other things, in his service as a member of the Board of Ex- aminers of the Cincinnati school system and of the Board of Directors of the municipal institution of higher education, the University of Cincinnati. Jewish religious education, as conceived by Wise, was the province of the congregational Sabbath School. The time and place of the school's meeting, obviously borrowed from the model of the Protestant Sunday School, were clearly designed to prevent accusations of Jewish separatism and to insure the possibility of Jewish involvement in the life of the larger community. Wise's position here reflects his clearly held conviction, fundamental to an understanding of his conception of Judaism and its relationship to American life, that "outside of the synagogue we are citizens of the land of our nationality or adoption and need not perceptibly differ from any fellow man. In public life, in business, in culture, in all worldly aspirations, we have lost our identity and very few, if any, wish to restore it."34 The branches of instruction in the Sabbath School which engaged Wise's interest and support were a) biblical and post-biblical history, b) religious and moral doctrines of Judaism, c) Bible reading in English, d) Hebrew reading and translation, and e) instruction in religious singing, "having in view the preparation of the youth for participation in congregational singing."35 This curriculum outline is based on the view that the Bible is the 34. Israelite 17, no. 38 (March 17, 1871). Wise repeatedly returned to this theme: "The Jew must be Americanized. ... The Jew must become an American in order to gain the proud self- consciousness of the freeborn man.... We must be not only American citizens but become Americans through and through outside the synagogue" (Isaac M. Wise, Reminiscences [Cin- cinnati and New York, 1901], p. 331). 35.

The pages of the Israelite of which he was the founder, editor and often the major con- tributor, carry article after article exhorting Jews to provide their children with a proper Jewish education. He could write that the education of the young was necessary, even essential "if the dear heirdom of our ancestors, in its purity and integrity, shall be handed down from generation to generation."40 At another time he would note that Jewish schools are a vital factor in "guarding our youth against sectarian influences."41 On yet another occasion, he would underscore the importance of education in general, and, by inference, of religious education in particular, by writing that ". . . a good education is essentially necessary to carry us through the world with propriety.... Our future success and happiness depend almost entirely upon the education we receive ... ."42 In short, Wise's belief in the efficacy of schooling was a deeply ingrained article of faith and like many of his contemporaries, Jews and non-Jews alike, he was convinced that educa- tion, properly conceived and administered, was the panacea for the ills of both man and society.

ACKERMAN formed by a concern which arched above the specific ideas he shared with all those who argued the need for Jewish schools. That concern was shaped by the significance he attached to the American experience, his interpretation of Judaism and the relationship between those two poles of his inspiration. Wise's own studies had led him to the abandonment of the traditional belief in a personal and transcendental Messiah. In its place he substituted the idea of a Messianic Age and, in his thinking, the United States, with its republican form of government and guarantees of individual conscience and liberty, was the morning star of a new epoch in human history.43 He was firmly convinced that "before our very eyes the world moves onward into the golden age of redeemed humanity and the fraternal union of nations as our prophets thousands of years ago have predicted. We are fast ap- proaching the universal democratic republic with civil and religious liberty, cemented by the world's advanced intelligence. This century settles old ac- counts. It is progressive."44 Little wonder then that Wise was a fervent champion of America and its institutions and devoted himself to the break- ing down of any and all barriers which threatened to keep Jews from full and active participation in American life. Indeed Jews had a signal contribu- tion to make in hastening the approach of the millennium: "The mission of Israel was and still is to promulgate the sacred truth to all nations on earth; to diffuse the bright light that first shone on Sinai's sanctified summit, all over the world."45 The Judaism which Wise thought to be the "true religion of all intel- ligent men" was clearly not that of the traditionally observant Jew. The very idea of the "mission of Israel" reflected his tenaciously held belief that much of what passed for Judaism was a perversion of the pristine spirit of biblical religion and completely foreign to the temper of his times. Judaism would be capable of engaging the loyalty of Jews and of fulfilling its promise as the "teacher of future generations," Jewish and non-Jewish alike, only as it rid itself of the layers of "priestcraft, superstition and fanaticism" which were the unfortunate inheritance of earlier, less enlightened ages. The demands of reason dictated the conclusion that Judaism was capable of surviving in America only as it was "transformed to correspond to American sentiments, feeling and thoughts."46 43.

His was a call for a school which would provide the knowledge and shape the intelligence indispensable to the reforming of Judaism. A reformed Judaism, the only Judaism possible in America, required that every Jew ". . . know what God commanded and be his own priest and expounder of the Law."47 A proper Jewish education meant not only the transmission of information of historical interest but, more important, the cultivation of an attitude which made the student ". . . independent in matters of religion, . . . not exposed to sectarian imposition, not subject to priestcraft and pious frauds, . . . not led astray by frivolous demagogues" and permitted him to "stand safe and firm on the basis of divine truth, the doctrines and principles of Judaism which, there is not the least doubt, ... will once triumph over the fiction yet existing in the world and become the religion of humanity."48 The task of the school, as defined by Wise, was, in theory at least, not beyond the power of that institution; actually no other agency, even in a time of more stable familial and communal organization, was capable of fulfilling the role. His statement of the problem and the solution he proposed led Wise to the inex- orable conclusion that the future of "rational" Judaism was the respon- sibility of the Jewish school.49 III The tide of Jewish immigration which flooded America during the clos- ing years of the nineteenth century and in the two decades immediately fol- lowing created new opportunities for those concerned with Jewish educa- tion. For the first time in the history of Jewish settlement in the United States, there existed that combination of density of population and human resources which is the pre-condition of a sustained and organized effort in education. The growing centers of Jewish population in the major cities of the eastern seaboard guaranteed a reservoir of pupils in numbers sufficient for the establishment of schools which were effective educational units. Among the immigrants could be found a sizable number of learned and educationally experienced men who were prepared to devote themselves to the work of Jewish schools. 47.

ACKERMAN The impact of the wave of immigration is reflected in the statistics of school enrolment in New York City-a pattern which repeated itself in other cities, even if on a smaller scale. In 1911, there were 114 Jewish schools in New York City which enrolled 28,032 children of elementary school age.50 Six years later, in 1917, the number of schools had increased to 181 and the student population numbered 41,043.51 These figures point to a growth of some fifty percent in both schools and enrolment-a record of ex- pansion which is significant by any standard. The 1917 study discloses, among other things, that at that time there were 45 Jewish schools in New York City with an enrolment of 300 pupils or more; three of these schools could boast of student bodies of 1,000 children and above.52 While many of the teachers employed in the Jewish schools of the time lacked even the most minimal qualifications, there was among the teacher corps a perceptible number of men who were both learned and practiced. The latter came to America with a background of traditional Jewish learn- ing and a record of experience in the hbeder metuqqan of Eastern Europe. They brought with them a zeal and dedication to Jewish education which was inspired by the Zionist ideal of a people reborn in its ancient homeland. These are the men who laid the foundations of modern Jewish education in the United States. The model of the hbeder metuqqan prompted the establishment of a number of afternoon schools, in New York and other cities, which set a standard not often met in a system of supplementary education. These schools combined a fierce devotion to Jewish nationalism with a sensitive concern for the child which was uncommon for the time. The curriculum of the Talmud Torah, as these schools were called, centered on 'ivrit be-'ivrit, the "natural" method of Hebrew language instruction, Hebrew literature, Bible and history.53 The Talmud Torah was, on every count, a significant departure both from traditional Jewish education and from the accepted practice of American Jewish schools up to that time. The broad outlines of nationalist ideology which informed the work of the Talmud Torah were refined by adherence to the philosophy of Ahad 50.

Principals and teachers alike ac- cepted the challenge implied in the statutes of Bnei Mosheh, the secret society founded in Russia in 1889 and headed by Ahad Ha'am which, in its dedication to the idea of the renaissance of the Jewish people and the return to the Land of Israel, conceived and supported a series of important educational ventures. They viewed themselves as an elite entrusted with the sacred mission of teaching "the child to know his people and the land of his forefathers..., to educate our young children so that they will know the Hebrew language, the history of Israel and its Torah . . . , to lead them to a love of the national heritage. . ., the Land of Israel and its settlement, the Torah of Israel, its language and wisdom, the memory of our forefathers and their history . . . , and thus to educate the generation we require."54 That declaration was the hortative expression of a carefully wrought theory which placed the process of education at the very center of the move- ment for national revival and survival. The future of the Jewish people, ac- cording to Ahad Ha'am, depended, first and foremost, on a regeneration of the spirit of Judaism; that is to say that the physical survival of the Jews was contingent upon their desire and ability to develop and maintain a life style which was unique and different from that of other nations because it was rooted in the cultural traditions and experiences of the group. The true significance of the settlement in Palestine was neither in the sphere of politics nor in its promise as a refuge for the persecuted. Palestine was im- portant because "we require a place which will serve as a national spiritual center, a safe haven not for Jews, but for Judaism, the spirit of our nation."55 The "spiritual center" in Palestine would serve as a source of inspiration to "those Jews scattered in their various countries . . . and instill in them the strength to live as Jews even in those places where they are deprived of all national rights."56 The Jewish school was assigned a place of critical importance in that long and arduous process of national metamorphosis which was the matrix of Ahad Ha'am's conception of Zionism.57 The school was central not only because the cultural heritage had to be learned and understood in a new way-neither as an object of religious reform nor as the subject of an archaeological interest in the past but rather as the key to still to be 54.

ACKERMAN developed cultural patterns-but also because neither the community nor the family and home could be relied upon to provide the support required for the development of a distinctive way of life.58 Indeed the school was con- ceived as a counterforce to the destructive influences of a hostile environ- ment and the "bastion" in which a new national character would take shape and form.59 The school was thus the embodiment of the national will and the place in which there would be restored that "sentiment of unity and purpose" which was the pre-condition of national independence. Ahad Ha'am and his disci- ples could call on Jews to subordinate their personal interests and con- venience for the sake of the common good because of their firm conviction that the individual existed only by virtue of his membership in a collectivity. Not only was the individual a social being but "even if he should so desire he cannot under any circumstances free himself of the influence of the group."60 That observation, moreover, was something more than a simp- listic sociological piety. It reflected a comprehension of Judaism which had as its goal the perfection of the nation and, at a later date, of mankind in general. Individual "salvation," a concept essentially foreign to Judaism, was possible only as a function of one's complete identification with the strivings and aspirations of the Jewish people.6' To the extent that education was the key to national self-realization, it was also the avenue of personal fulfilment. Education in the spirit of the national heritage and as the tool for the development of a new Jewish culture was not, however, totally unmindful of the needs of the individual. If the Jewish school envisioned by Ahad Ha'am was to mould a personality which would internalize the norms and values of Judaism and dedicate itself to the common good, it was also required to provide Jews with that sense of completeness and security which was denied them both because of the brutal circumstances of life in Eastern Europe and because of the conflict generated by the meeting of Judaism and modern western culture. National education, the term used by Ahad Ha'am to dis- tinguish his notion of the Jewish school from that of the traditional school, was, therefore, "compelled to provide Jewish children with that internal moral support so necessary for the difficult life which awaited them. They 58. Idem, "Ha-IHinnukh ha-Le'ummi," Kol Kitvei.... p. 413. 59. Ibid. 60. Ginzberg, "Shinnui ha-'Arakhim," Kol Kitvei..., pp. 154-59. 61.

The nation, in the view of Ahad Ha'am, was fundamentally a cultural entity and the relation between any one nation and the family of nations is one in which each group's life is an attempt to embody in its own particular manner ideals which are common to humanity as a whole.64 Judaism was thus part of the culture of humanity; it was the Jewish people's distinctive way of expressing common human ideals. Withal the par- ticularism of Judaism was unique among, and even superior to, all other specific expressions of human aspirations because it alone gave primacy of place to the power of the spirit.65 The objectives of Jewish education as detailed by Ahad Ha'am demanded a school whose curriculum centered on the Hebrew language and its literature. The mastery of the national language was the keystone of the entire structure-both because of the intrinsic power of language in the shaping of personality and because Hebrew was essential to an under- standing of the nation's literature, the storehouse of its culture. The Hebrew language and its literature, more than anything else, when properly taught to young children, would "tie them with bonds of love and reverence to their people and its land and.. . awaken in them the desire to dedicate themselves to the service of their people and to contribute to the national rebirth."66 The Hebrew language and its literature, furthermore, was something more than simply a tool for fixing the boundaries of national 62.

From this national resource they will draw the beginnings of their knowledge of those truths which ennoble the soul of man and which are the great possessions of human culture. Only in this way will there be created that organic connec- tion between the individual and his nation which alone is capable of providing us in the future with men who are complete..., men in whom the 'man' and the 'Jew' are joined in a harmonious whole .... ."67 Those men who had been fired by the philosophy of Ahad Ha'am brought a new vision of Jewish education to the United States. Despite the adjustments in the particulars of educational procedure demanded by the circumstances of life in America, they remained fiercely loyal to the theory and the translation of its principles into practice. The justification for schooling which they offered is perhaps best summed up in the common usage which speaks of the Hebrew School as distinguished from the Religious School and the Sunday School. They brought with them a passion for the Hebrew language which often bordered on mystical zeal and a single minded dedication to the rebuilding of Palestine and clearly viewed themselves as counterparts of the balus and thus part of an elite charged with nothing less than insuring the future of the Jewish people.68 Their views stood in striking opposition to both the approach of Wise and his followers who denied the national aspects of Judaism and limited Jewishness to the synagogal practice of a religious faith and to the other-worldly orientation of traditional Judaism with its emphasis on the study of Jewish law.

Although written many years later and describing another generation of Jewish teachers, the following excerpt applies equally well to the men we are discussing here: "The Seminary College was theoretically committed to what Jewish tradition calls Torah lishma, learning for its own sake, but in actual fact its purposes were very far from being disinterestedly academic. The literal meaning of Torah lishma may be 'learning for its own sake,' but the true, the theological meaning of the idea is 'studying the revealed word of God for the sake of heaven.' The Seminary College did not, I think, consider that it was teaching the revealed word of God for the sake of heaven; it did, however, consider that it was teaching the heritage of the Jewish people as a way of ensuring the survival of that people (my father knew what he was do- ing when he sent me there). This is not to imply that there was anything covert or devious going on; on the contrary, most professors of the Seminary simply and frankly took it for granted that their business was to deepen the Jewish commitment of their students by making them more fully aware of the glories of the Jewish heritage. They were not training minds or sen- sibilities; they were training Jews!"

The influence of these men made itself felt throughout the developing system of Jewish education in America; indeed they were largely responsible for creating that system. They founded schools in every major center of Jewish population; they were among the key figures in the growth and expansion of Bureaus of Jewish Education; and it was they who founded and staffed the major Jewish teacher training institutions in the country. The ideas they propagated remain a dominant motif in Jewish education-or as some would insist, Hebrew education-to this day. IV No less dedicated to the idea of a "new" Jewish life were those who gave their allegiance to Yiddish and Yiddishkeit. Like their Zionist opponents the Yiddishists who were responsible for the first Yiddish schools in the United States drew their inspiration from across the ocean; they too adapted an ideology rooted in Eastern Europe to the circumstances of Jewish life in early twentieth century America. Illegal Yiddish schools had been es- tablished in Warsaw as early as 1899, to be followed by similar efforts in Bialystok, Kiev, and Vilna.69 The spread of Yiddish schools in Poland paral- leled the growth of the Bund, the General Jewish Workers Union, which countered Zionist doctrine with the theory of doikayt (hereness), a form of cultural autonomy. The Bund was an important factor in the creation of the Central Yiddish School Organization (CYShO), an association of Yiddish schools which soon after its founding in 1921 numbered 182 affiliates. On the eve of World War II, some 17,000 boys and girls were receiving instruc- tion in CYShO schools.70 The Yiddish schools of Poland, intended as they were for children of working class families, built their program on the foundations of secularism, socialism, and the Yiddish language and its literature. The choice of Yiddish was both ideological and pragmatic-ideological because it symbolized a break with the Hebrew of the religious tradition and the past; pragmatic because it was the language of the masses. Chaim Zhitlowsky, a major theoretician of Yiddishism, recalls his own decision to adopt Yiddish as the language of Jewish rebirth: 69. Miriam Eisenstein, Jewish Schools in Poland 1919-1939 (New York, 1950), p. 19. 70. Ibid., pp. 35, 37.</page><page sequence="22">22 WALTER I. ACKERMAN One must talk to a people in its own language. But our people use two languages: Hebrew and Yiddish. In the world in which I grew up, both languages had the same prestige. ... After all, Torah was studied and in- terpreted in Yiddish. Hebrew, the sacred tongue, was valued more, but only religiously. As a secular language, in which one read the paper or a haskalah book, it may have outranked Yiddish slightly, not for any inherent reason, but because of its association with education. The question facing me was to decide in which language to appeal to the Jews, not just the ignorant masses, but the whole people, to train an avant garde to fight for the ideals of universal progress and for their realization in Jewish life. I decided on Yiddish. This was my calculation: we, the carriers of ideas of universal human progress, had to appeal to the people with our message about quite a new world, the world of modern, progressive West European culture. Vis-&amp;-vis this world, the whole Jewish people were like the ignorant masses .... One could make no distinc- tions between classes and levels of education. One had to use the language that everyone understood. That was Yiddish, the vernacular of every Jew.71 Yiddish was thus both means and end; the instrument for the forging of the new culture which would in turn express itself in a language free of the intel- lectual and political conservatism of the tradition. The appeal to socialism gave voice to the conviction that only a radical reordering of society was capable of eliminating the oppression and ine- quality which were the inevitable lot of the defenseless Jewish worker under capitalism. The Yiddish school was considered a major force in the class struggle which would herald a new era in the cultural, economic, and social life of the Jews. While the traditional school indoctrinated its pupils to ac- cept the status quo and thereby perpetuated the abuses characteristic of a capitalist society, the Yiddish socialist school declared its intention to "educate a generation that, equipped with the necessary knowledge and in- formation, would bring about a new social order that would end the ex- ploitation of the proletariat... and do away with the class structured society of the past."72 Clearly conversant with progressive trends in Euro- pean education of the time, Yiddish socialist educators drew a sharp distinc- tion between the perfunctory application of methodological innovations which had little or no influence on the essential character of a school and the adoption of those pedagogical principles which bespoke new models of 71.

Because the purpose of the radical Yiddish school was to prepare its pupils to serve as productive members of the "socialist society of the not so distant future," it could not be merely "a continuation of the old type school nor the result of a gradual evolution of a reform in education." With neither history nor tradition to bind it to a lifeless past, the "new school" was free-indeed the revolution demanded it-to chart a new course in the education of Jewish children, an education free of the "formalism and abstraction" which characterized the bourgeois school. In such a school new methods-i.e., the principle of labor (arbets printsip) which was a hallmark of progressive educators of the time-cannot be: "mere mechanical addi- tions to an existing structure . . . . They must serve as the central axis on which the entire contents of the school revolve .... The principle of labor is the basis for preparing for the life that is to come, for educating to that com- mitment, productivity and activism which must serve as the foundations of the new society . ... The school must be ... transformed into a socialist in- stitution for learning informed by clearly articulated educational prin- ciples . . .."73 The first Yiddish school in America was founded in 1908 in Brownsville, a section of New York City noted for the socialist leanings of its largely working class population. Yiddishists in other cities followed suit and in the years immediately after World War I there were already Yiddish schools of various kinds in every major center of Jewish settlement. The thrust of these schools is evident in a description of the work of the National-Radical Yid- dish school founded in Chicago in 1912: "... Conversations and discussions regarding social problems and movements are held in classrooms. The fol- lowing personalities are studied and discussed: Robert Owen, Karl Marx, Ferdinand La Salle, Moses Hess, Bakunin, Kropotkin, the Gaon of Vilna, Baal Shem Tov, Moses Mendelssohn, and others. The aim of this course is to imbue the children with the desire to join the ranks of the fighters of freedom and give them the appreciation of the movements which con- tributed to the progress of humanity."74 The enthusiasm and devotion of those most closely associated with the Yiddish schools required translation into terms which spoke to the parents of the children for whom the schools were intended. Like the Hebraists and Zionists, Yiddishists developed a rationale for the maintenance of their 73. I. Rubin, "Di oyfgaben fun der nayer shule," Naye shule, June 15, 1921, pp. 28-32. 74.

ACKERMAN schools which was calculated to attract those who questioned or were indif- ferent to the need for ethnic schools. Addressing himself to those in the socialist community who saw a striking contradiction between the nationalism of the Yiddish school and the doctrines of socialism, Zhitlowsky declared: "Everyone must belong to a people.., .whether he wants to or not. ... One cannot be 'nationless'. .. even if belonging is against his will .... Whatever might happen to Jews in the future, they are not at present part of any people and other nations are correct . .. in their refusal to consider Jews as 'blood of their blood.' As a nation Jews belong only to themselves.""75 For those who would claim that "America is dif- ferent" and that the Jewish experience in Eastern Europe could not serve as an example in a truly democratic society, Zhitlowsky was quick to point out that "... when Americans compel all the various ethnic groups in the country to Americanize themselves, that is neither a manifestation of human solidarity nor an example of voluntary brotherhood. The drive for Americanization is a veiled form of slavery, but slavery nonetheless . . . ex- actly as in Russia .... While the Russians use the Cossack's whip, Americans resort to the lash of hunger and the promise of good jobs with which they buy the souls of foreigners . . . .76 The recognition and acceptance of nationhood, Jewish or any other, leads inexorably, according to Zhitlowsky, to a commitment to the language of the group. To deny one's own language in favor of a foreign language is to engage in an act of bittul ha-yesh; it is tantamount "to spitting in one's own face."77 The unique genius of a people can express itself only in its own language. The more developed a language, the richer is the national culture; the most sublime expressions of a people's culture transcend the group and touch that which is common to all of mankind; the dialectic which characterizes the meeting of the particular and the universal enriches the national culture and spurs it to seek yet higher levels. The language of the Jewish people is Yiddish and only in that language can Jews hope to give voice to that which is at once most authentically Jewish and most universal- ly human.78 When the Jewish school introduced its students to the Yiddish language and its literature, it was, in the eyes of Yiddishists, creating the instrument 75.

Chaim Zhitlowsky, "Zoln mir do boyen unzer kultur in english?," Ale verk, 1:155-58.</page><page sequence="25">JUSTIFICATION IN JEWISH EDUCATION 25 which was a guarantor of national unity. The function of language in the struggle of the Jews for survival was more than a matter of casuistic ideology. "We are," wrote Zhitlowsky, "a world wide people, spread out among different nations and tongues .... Such a dispersed people in this particular period of its history especially needs . .. to have all its parts held together."79 The claim for Yiddish as the language of the Jews, the language which all Jews shared in common, remains one of the more inexplicable aspects of Yiddishism. It is a position which reflected the experience of the Eastern European immigrant to whom it was addressed; it ignored those sectors of the Jewish people whose history had taught them other languages. The more militant socialists among the Jewish workers found the nationalistic proclivities of the National-Radical Yiddish schools sponsored by the American Poale Zion Party-schools which acknowledged that "Hebrew is. . . a language of substantial national importance"-no less nettling than the teaching of religiously oriented Jewish schools. The paral- lel strains of secularism and radicalism were the dominant motifs of the network of Yiddish schools established by the Workmen's Circle (Arbeter Ring), the fraternal organization of Jewish working men whose growth and decline is a mirror of the Jewish immigrant experience in America. The com- pass of a doctrinaire socialism set the course of these schools, first es- tablished in 1916, on a road of radicalism, opposition to Jewish nationalism and hostility to religion: "The education which children receive in the Talmud Torah and the beder as well as in the so-called National-Radical schools can in no way please us .... The Talmud Torah and the beder teach only religion and very often a fanaticism from which we want to free our children. And in the National-Radical schools they are taught ultra- nationalism which more often than not is openly Zionist .... We want our children to receive neither a religious education nor a Zionist education but a free Yiddish education. .... We want our children to receive an education which is free of the idea of a Chosen People and of every form of chauvinism. We want our children to receive an education informed by the spirit of freedom. . . . The children of working class parents cannot be or- dinary socialists; they must be Jewish socialists .... Instead of prayer and religion, we will teach our children modern Yiddishkeit, Jewish history and literature,... knowledge which they will find helpful in their socialist ac- tivity."80 79. Ibid. 80.

ACKERMAN The Workmen's Circle schools were conceived not only as alternatives to other forms of Jewish education but also as an antidote to the bias of the public schools. Yiddish schools rooted in the temper of active radicalism were necessary because ". . . in a capitalist society the public schools are controlled largely by capitalists, the enemies of the working class. . . . The teachers are forced to plant in the young innocent hearts reactionary chauvinism. Therefore, every clear minded worker who strives for a more beautiful and better world for humanity cannot permit himself to remain in- different to the education of his own children. .... The foundations of the new order must be carefully prepared .... Without the younger generation, .... the future of the ship of life and the workingman's fight will be lost. ... ."8' Among the reasons offered by Yiddishists for the maintenance of a separate school system, none is as poignant as that which addressed itself to the gulf which separated immigrant parents from their American born and educated children. An article by Abraham Liessen, the Yiddish poet, is worth quoting at length: ... The Jewish students in the schools and colleges everywhere are the brightest and most diligent . .. .;the lists of prizewinners are proof. The children of homeless . .. and driven Russian, Galician, and Rumanian Jews win the most prizes. In the old country these children would have had little chance of going to school; in the old country thousands of these children could not even have been sure of remaining among the living.. . and here in America they win first prize .... But there is a question we must ask. What have we gained from these educated youngsters? Why have these admirable college graduates disappeared from the Jewish street? Why do we neither see nor feel them? Where are they? ... They are mostly the children of poor peo- ple, the children of workers. Why do they not feel their obligation to the poor? Why do they so easily forget the suffering and self-sacrifice of their parents? Why do they become traitors to their class? . . . Those fathers and mothers who are incapable of thinking deeply about education are happy and feel themselves fortunate with the opportunity provided by the American school. The intelligent ones, however, . . . soon come to the conclusion that something has gone wrong in the American school .... That school rends a terrible tear in the Jewish soul; . . . it touches and destroys the foundations of that which is the holiest and most beautiful in our long-suffering Jewish life: the Jewish family.... In those schools our children have become estranged from us.... It matters little that they live with us under one roof, that they eat together with us 81.

We are separated by an abyss, an abyss of the soul.82 The inference, of course, is clear: proper Jewish schools in which Jewish children are taught Yiddishkeit, the culture of their parents, would stem the tide of disaffection and bridge the gap between the immigrant generation and its American born and educated offspring. V Neither the nationalist Hebrew school nor the socialist Yiddish school were capable, if indeed they were at all intended for that purpose, of satisfy- ing those Jews who were dedicated to the maintenance of traditional forms of Jewish education in the United States. The inadequacies of the then ex- isting schools in New York City had spurred a group of Orthodox Jews to found the Yeshivat 'ES Hayyim in 1886. The purpose and program of the yeshivah were "to give free instruction to poor Hebrew children in the Hebrew language and the Jewish religion-Talmud, Bible, and Shulhan 'Arukh-during the whole day from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon."83 The directors of the yeshivah were sworn to "conduct themselves only according to the customs of Poland and Russia, in accord- ance with the customs of our fathers and our forefathers" and to prevent "... an admixture or inkling of any change or alteration or deviation even from the smallest otf the least of the customs of Poland."84 It is clear that the founders of 'ES IHayyim as well as those responsible for the beginnings of similar institutions of the time and later were guided by the image of the great yeshivot of Eastern Europe. That model of Jewish education had been refined over centuries of continuous practice and had set an uncompromising standard by which to judge those who claim to be educated Jews. Whatever the variations between the yeshivot of different times and places they were of style and detail rather than of principle and purpose. The scope and range of studies were ordained in a divine command whose authority was no less binding in New York than in Volozhin. The supporters of traditional Jewish education faced many of the same problems which bedeviled those Jewish educators who sought to develop other forms of Jewish schooling in the United States. The lack of finances was an ever present problem: "Our financial condition was so poor that we 82. "Unzere kinder," Forverts, July 10, 1910. 83.

ACKERMAN had no money with which to buy books. So we bought one Gemara for ninety cents and tore it into three parts, giving one part to each of the three melammedim."85 The idea that New York City was to be the home of a yeshivah was perceived by many as a threat to the acceptance of Jews in America and an impediment to Americanization. When in 1915 'Es HIayyim was merged with the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary to form the Rabbinical College of America there were those who were quick to pronounce ". . . the New York yeshivah an anachronism for which the United States had neither the time nor the place and every dollar spent for its maintenance is that much waste or worse. A legitimate use can be found for every dollar that the Jews of the United States can spare and there is none to waste for transplanting in American soil an institution of the medieval ghetto."86 Neither the lack of funds nor the hostility of "uptown" Jews, however, could dull the determination of the supporters of the yeshivah. A far more serious challenge to the idea of a yeshivah and its exclusive concentration on the study of Talmud was that posed by the concern for secular studies among even those Orthodox Jews who were committed to the traditional form of Jewish education. The casual attitude of the directors of 'ES Hjayyim toward secular studies-"two hours [each day] shall be devoted to teach the native language, English"-was hardly calculated to satisfy those parents and students who felt the need for a course of study which would equip young people for life in the United States. Indeed the question of secular studies was the immediate cause of a student strike at RIETS in 1906. The directors of the school, which had been founded in 1897 in order to provide a higher level of talmudic study than was available at 'Es .Hayyim, withdrew financial support from an entire class because a number of students had either refused to sign a pledge of abstention from secular studies or once having signed the statement violated its terms. The action of the directors led to the circulation of a student petition which demanded "... a curriculum in the native language and general knowledge."87 The stand of the directors of RIETS was not without authority of prece- dent. The history of Jewish education offers ample evidence of resistance, and even fierce opposition, to secular studies. The famous yeshivah of 85. Ibid., p. 73. 86.

The talmudic statement, "Go and find an hour which is neither day nor night and study in it Greek wisdom," reflects an attitude which shaped the con- tours of Jewish learning and impressed a peculiar stamp on the world of the yeshivah. The engagement with secular studies was viewed as time wrongful- ly taken from the study of Torah and as a hazardous involvement with the work and thought of those who do not accept the "yoke of the law." The weight of this tradition of divorcement, already strained by the forces of modernism even in Eastern Europe, was unequal to the insistent demands for secular studies advanced by students attuned to the rhythms of American life. Shortly after his appointment as rosh yeshivah and president of the faculty of the Rabbinical College of America, Dr. Bernard Revel an- nounced the opening of the Talmudical Academy, the high school depart- ment of the College, "in which the regular high school studies as prescribed by the Board of Education of the City of New York for the city high schools are taught."88 The purpose of the school, the first high school in the United States to offer Jewish and secular studies under one roof, was to "coordinate and unify the forces of education of our spiritually endowed youth, to bring harmony and light into their spiritual lives and to guide their Jewish con- sciousness and widen their moral and mental horizon."89 The Talmudical Academy was to become the paradigm for the modern American day school, the unmistakable achievment of Orthodox Jewry which set the stan- dard of intensive Jewish education in this country. If those who opposed the combination of Jewish religious studies and secular studies which distinguished Talmudical Academy, and later Yeshiva University, could cite rabbinical authority in support of their position,"9 those who welcomed Revel's bold move could likewise summon a justifica- tion drawn from impeccable example. The new school could be placed on a line which led back to the Israelitische Realschule which was founded in Frankfurt-am-Main in 1853 by Samson Raphael Hirsch. 88.

ACKERMAN The Realschule reflected Hirsch's conception of Judaism and was the educational expression of his efforts to combat the influence of Reform and the spreading disaffection with Judaism among German Jews. Whereas Reform, like its precursors of the German Haskalah, judged Judaism in the light of modern thought and sensibility, Hirsch maintained that the teachings of the Torah were the standard by which to measure the achieve- ments of man and society: "If Judaism has been established by God then it is destined to teach the age, but not to let itself be taught by the age.""9 Ac- cording to Hirsch, the presence of God was immanent in every creative ac- tivity of man and the divine was manifest in nature and history. The wisdom of non-Jews is as much an instance of God's beneficence as the revelation at Sinai; nothing in this world, then, is beyond the purview of the observant Jew. The complete Jewish life is that which is totally dedicated to the proper fulfilment of the laws of God. A genuine understanding of the Torah, however, requires knowledge "as extensive as possible of the realities of all earthly human relationships; a vast and varied store of wisdom .... The true talmid .bakham will find that he can learn something from every person...."92 Not for nothing did our sages formulate the blessing we pronounce upon coming in contact with a man learned in general knowledge: "Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who has given of His wisdom to mortals." An interpretation of Judaism which "looks with favor and interest on every branch of learning, which teaches about nature and mankind and helps you understand men in their struggle with nature and one another"93 leads easily and naturally to a curriculum for a Jewish religious school which includes instruction in the vernacular, natural history, physics, geography, psychology, and anthropology.94 The philosophical underpinnings of Hirsch's conception of Judaism were the ground upon which he developed the idea of torah 'im derekh 'ere?, the motto of the Realschule, which was intended to serve as a guide to Jews in their relations with the world about them. In commenting on the mishnah in Avot (2:2) from which the phrase is drawn, Hirsch noted that the term derekh 'eres "is used primarily to refer to ways of earning a living, to the social order that prevails on earth, as well as to the mores and considera- 91.

It is incumbent, therefore, upon those responsible for the rearing of the young to provide them with "the possibility of becoming self-supporting" through the ac- quisition of "some business, some craft, some art, some profession""95 in ad- dition to whatever other skills and knowledge may be required for life in and out of the Jewish community. This embracive conception of education, deeply rooted as it was in Torah and including both general knowledge and practical skills, was a prescription for the nurturing of loyalty to Judaism and the development of the ability and willingness to withstand the contrary ideas of an unfriendly environment.96 While there is debate as to whether or not Revel was influenced by Hirsch's teaching, it is reasonable to assume that he had more than passing knowledge of the nature of the Realschule. As a matter of fact, there is a striking similarity between the positions developed by Hirsch and the justification offered by Revel to placate those who opposed his idea of a school which emphasized talmudic learning at the same time as it offered a program of secular studies. Like Hirsch, Revel saw the institution of which he was the head as a major line of defense in the battle against defection from Judaism. In explanation of the intent of the yeshivah to establish a College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Revel pointedly addressed himself to the problem of students who must go elsewhere for that general education which they were determined to acquire. The proposed college was to serve ". .. the double purpose of educating both liberally and Jewishly a number of Jewish young men who have been already imbued with the spirit and sanctity of Judaism and its teachings, so that these men may not be lost to us... In existing colleges, Jewish students are led to efface their Jewishness .... Some of our idealistic and talented young men will find in a College of Liberal Arts and Sciences under Jewish auspices a congenial home, un- hampered by real and psychological restrictions, which stifle the spirit...."97 In a style somewhat reminiscent of that used by Hirsch, Revel spoke of the programs he sponsored as attempts to further "the harmonious develop- ment of all the faculties of man." The yeshivah in both its high school and college departments, strives to provide "an education through which the 95. Ibid., p. 410. 96.

ACKERMAN human conscience and the Jewish conscience develop harmoniously into the synthesis of a complete Jewish personality, that indicates the guiding laws of life in accordance with the immortal truths of Judaism in harmonious blending with the best thought of the age and the great humanitarian ideals upon which our blessed country is founded."'98 This combination of Torah education and general knowledge would, according to Revel, enrich both Jewish and American life. The apparent correspondence noted above should not, however, obscure a very real difference between Revel and Hirsch. The latter's attitude toward general knowledge was an integral part of a carefully reasoned philosophy of Judaism. The manner in which Hirsch chose to list the contents of a proposed course of study strongly suggests an integrative approach which creates points of convergence between religious and secular studies.99 Revel, by contrast, seems to have arrived at his position as a result of pressures born of circumstance; he was convinced the yeshivah could retain its brightest students only if it offered them the opportunity of a college education.'00 Revel was always careful to maintain a distinction between the yeshivah proper and the general studies departments, whether on the high school or college level. The structure of the school day reflected this dif- ferentiation: religious studies took place in the morning and early afternoon; general studies programs began at three o'clock. "Harmonious education," the rubric Revel used to describe his approach, meant essentially separate curricula which provided the student of the yeshivah with the opportunity of acquiring a college education at the same time as he pursued intensive Jewish studies. The uniqueness of the institution was its readiness to assume responsibility for the total education of the student and to create an at- mosphere for general academic training which was consistent with its religious teachings.

The various types of schools we have described were founded at the turn of the present century; their activities were directed to and drew 98. As quoted in Rothkoff, Bernard Revel, p. 259. 99.

In this respect these schools were repeating the pattern of an earlier period. Indeed, it was not until well after World War II that enrolment in Jewish schools of the more intensive kind was to consist largely of the children of native born American Jews.'0' Despite this similarity to the ex- perience of an earlier time, there is reason to argue that the circumstances of life in the United States in the years before World War I and immediately after were so different from those which had obtained during the nineteenth century as to pose problems for Jewish educators of the later period which were new and unprecedented. The parallel and interdependent processes of immigration, industrialization, and urbanization had changed the face of America at an extraordinary rate. The social and economic complexities oc- casioned by these powerful trends strained the resources and abilities of ex- isting institutions and contributed to a festering tension between various ele- ments of the population. The immigration of Eastern European Jews which began in the 1880s created a visible Jewish presence where none had existed before. America could now count a large number of Jews, concentrated in cities ill-equipped to accommodate an exploding population, whose background, behavior, and customs were at painful odds with the norms of the Protestant establishment and of the already well established Jewish im- migrant of an earlier period. Many of the problems which confronted all Jewish schools in this period can be understood only against the background of the struggle of teachers, pupils, and parents alike to resolve the unavoidable tension created by the desire to maintain fidelity to people, language, and faith and the need to ad- just to the harsh demands of the country to which they had all but recently come. Jews, of course, were not the only immigrants who strove to maintain a pattern of ethnic and religious loyalty which was rooted in the customs and traditions of another place,102 although they did differ in that their at- tachment was not to the country which they had left. Those immigrants who attempted to define anew the nature of their culture and to create a synthesis between that which they remembered and that which they were experiencing in America met with opposition both from within and without. American educators were on the whole unsympathetic to the efforts of immigrnnts to 101. Alexander Dushkin and Uriah Engelman, Jewish Education in the United States (New York, 1959), p. 87. 102.

ACKERMAN retain ethnic and religious identities and were often cruelly indifferent to the need for the familiar which impelled the new American to seek reminders of his origins. "Americanization" programs in the public schools were clearly calculated to eliminate all forms of cultural difference and to create a sense of shame at being foreign. Julia Richman, the first woman district school superintendent in New York City and a leader among those public school educators who worked with immigrant children, gave voice to a widely held attitude when she declared: "The immigrants must be made to realize that in forsaking the land of their birth, they were also forsaking the customs and traditions of that land; and they must be made to realize an obligation, in adopting a new country to adopt the language and customs of that country." 103 Not all immigrants, moreover, were anxious to maintain ties with the culture of their homeland. The very factors which had led them to emigrate often worked against the retention of attitudes and behavior which in their own view marked them as different. Those who left the country of their birth had done so out of a desire to better themselves socially and economically. Even without the prodding of zealous "Americanizers," many immigrants quickly convinced themselves that the achievement of suc- cess and respectability in America depended in no small measure on confor- mity to the standards set by the native Anglo-Saxon Protestant American. If the public school, free and open to all, was the road which led to position and acceptance, the ethnically oriented school, religious and secular, was surely nothing but a detour leading to a social and economic dead end. It seems clear that this attitude explains, in part at least, the relatively low percentage of children of elementary school age enrolled in Jewish schools during the period under review here. 04 Jewish educators, both of the time with which we are here dealing and of an earlier period as well, were acutely sensitive to the problems inherent in the attempt to maintain an identifiable minority culture in the face of the contrary pressures exerted by an attractively powerful majority. Their writings, while often extolling the virtues and advantages of life in America, also reflect an almost overwhelming sense of helplessness in the confronta- 103.

Only rarely, if at all, did they attempt to develop a theory of Jewish educa- tion which provided a justification for their efforts in terms that came to grips with the principles underlying the American system. The first Jewish educator to grapple with this problem in a vigorous and sophisticated fashion was Isaac B. Berkson, one of a group of young, American trained Jewish educators who under the leadership of Dr. Samson Benderly in the Bureau of Jewish Education of New York created the first real system of Jewish education in this country.'05 Berkson was himself a son of immigrant parents whose own education and experience point to that amalgam of the American and the Jewish which was the heart of his theory. His work bears the imprint of his training at Teachers College and Columbia University where he studied with John Dewey and William H. Kilpatrick, two of the most influential figures in American education of the time. Theories of Americanization,'06 the book based on his doctoral dissertation, appeared during the wave of fanatic patriotism and sharp anti-foreign attitudes which began with the entry of the United States into World War I. The basic task which Berkson set for himself was to provide a justifica- tion for the continued existence of minorities as identifiable and functioning groups in American society. Even though he wrote with "special reference to the Jewish group" his premises were applicable to all minorities. He begins his work with an examination of the nature of democracy, moves from there to the deduced argument for the rightful-even imperative- place of minorities in a democratic society, then considers the means best suited to the preservation of minority cultures and concludes with a recital of the benefits which accrue to the individual and society alike from the presence of a diversity of cultures. The essence of democracy, according to Berkson, is its recognition of the uniqueness of the individual and its guarantee of his right to self- determination: "The individual must in the last analysis be the ultimate and only judge of the salvation which is in accordance with his own nature."'07 The freedom to determine the nature of one's own being, however, depends for its realization upon the availability of alternatives which afford the pos- sibility of choice. In addition, the process of self-determination which 105.

ACKERMAN defines individuality requires for its fulfilment a recognition of the in- terdependence of all men. Democracy then is "a progressive consideration of uniqueness, a multiplication of diverse possibilities, a growing con- sciousness of man's interdependence."'08 The homogenization of culture explicit in the then current theories of Americanization denied the principles of democracy as thus posited. To deprive the individual of the right of choosing the locus of his allegiance, even when the object of that loyalty is a minority whose traditions and customs differ from those of the majority, is to do violence to the notion of self-determination. The presence in a society of a variety of minorities, each of which represents a distinctive way of life, creates that diversity which is the condition of meaningful choice. The shared experience of children of diverse background in a public school sensitive to the significance of ethnic identity and supportive of its cultural expression fosters that sense of in- terdependence without which neither the individual nor the group is com- plete. A truly democratic society is that which permits ". . . the in- dividual... to develop through forces selected by the laws of his own nature, not moulded by factors determined upon by others either in the in- terest of themselves or in accordance with an assumed good."'09 The implications of his theory aside, it is Berkson's contention that the denial of one's origins and the attempts to forge an American of a standar- dized character are injurious to the health of the individual and the nation alike. It is not only that "the ultimate judgment of the value of the ethnic group must be in the experience of the person who has lived the life of the ethnic group,""0 but also that the failure to appreciate the significance of one's ethnic connection is a sign of moral weakness and a barrier to the in- tegration of personality."' Like the individual who would deny his ethnic origin, the nation which would blot out cultural differences suffers an ir- reparable loss. It deprives itself of the valuable contribution to the strength of the polity which derives from citizens whose ethnic experience refracts the pieties of the majority and subjects them to critical examination. Dual loyalties are the ground in which is rooted the sensibility to the needs of others which is the condition of heightened humanity; they provide a sense of perspective and serve as protection against mindless indoctrination.

His mode of life, his religious views, his evaluations are all called into question by the presence of the dominant current of thought. ..; his life must be more highly self-conscious and rationalized than it need be for him who accepts current ways and modes of thought which are socially ap- proved. ... Forced to find worth and beauty in his own people's life to sanc- tion his loyalty, he carries over the same thought in thinking of the new culture. ... Trained to seek below the surface of his own tradition, he will tend to look for what is exalted in American life and to base his loyalty upon a conscious realization of the significance of America.""2 The recognition of the right to existence of minority cultures forces the question of the means required for the maintenance of a vibrant and creative group life which is responsive to the needs of its members and capable of enriching the larger society of which it is a part. As far as the Jews are con- cerned their future in the United States and elsewhere was dependent, first and foremost, upon the realization of Ahad Ha'am's ideal of Palestine as a "spiritual center." Berkson was convinced that "the possibility of maintain- ing a vital Jewish ethnic culture in the diaspora is dependent upon the ex- istence of a cultural center to serve as a source of spiritual replenishment and to prevent the ethnic spirit from becoming the petrified relic of an an- cient grandeur. The community theory becomes a hopeful solution only if there will be established an autonomous Jewish center in Palestine.""3 In America itself a meaningful Jewish life was possible only as the resources of the group were harnessed to the development of a network of schools dedicated to the preservation of Torah, the essential element of Jewishness. Torah, as conceived by Berkson, is the "central idea in Jewish life" and is "a word of many connotations ranging from the usual designa- tion of the Pentateuch to the whole spiritual life . . .; it is Jewishness, the spiritual life and Godliness. . . . The idea of Torah has been broadened to include cultural and aesthetic values as well as those which popular usage identifies as religious.""'4 Because knowledge is the essence of Judaism and can be acquired only through education, the preservation of Jewish culture which is the raison d'etre of Jewish survival requires that the school become the central agency of Jewish life. The school rather than the synagogue was to be the preeminent symbol of Jewish life in America because it alone was 112. Ibid., p. 127. 113. Ibid., p. 109. 114. Ibid., pp. 101-2.</page><page sequence="38">38 WALTER I. ACKERMAN capable of encompassing the wide variety of views and activities which were legitimate expressions of Judaism. The program which was the logical outcome of Berkson's analysis is perhaps best exemplified by the curriculum of the Talmud Torah of the Central Jewish Institute in New York. The Institute itself was a center which addressed itself to every age group in the community; the Talmud Torah was the hub of a wide variety of social and educational activities. The course of study of the Talmud Torah centered on the Hebrew language and its literature: "Of the 2160 hours in the entire six year schedule 1548 hours are devoted to Hebrew subjects: 744 are devoted to the Hebrew language and secular literature, 504 hours to the Sacred Literature which is read and taught in Hebrew, and 300 hours to the Hebrew Prayer Book." In addition, pupils were taught history, customs, and institutions and the Jewish Sab- bath and holidays."5 The overall purpose of the school was to convert "the physical Jew, who is so by birth, into a spiritual Jew, who remains so by reason of the ideal significance of Jewish life.""6 The theory of democracy propounded by Berkson required that the Jewish school be supplementary to the public school. To support parochial education was to segregate children along lines of creed and to deny them that opportunity of shared experience which alone could insure that sense of interdependence and willingness to cooperate with others which are the hall- marks of a democratic society. Aside from the intrinsic contribution of Jewish education to the continued existence of the Jewish people, Berkson could justify the effort involved in the support of an independent, sup- plementary Jewish school by denoting those qualities of mind and heart which the educated Jew would bring to his life as an American citizen. A mastery of Hebrew, an international language which transcends time and geography, is a step away from narrow nationalism; to know the Bible is to gain an insight into the spiritual forces which shaped the character of the English speaking world; the record of Jewish history is a key to the under- standing of Western civilization; an appreciation of the meaning of Jewish survival frees man from the powerlessness of dependence on circumstance and is testimony to the strength of will and purpose."7 The education of the Jew is perforce the education of the American! Berkson's theory of Americanization, even though developed in 115. Ibid., pp. 195-202. 116. Ibid., p. 202. 117. Ibid., pp. 128-40.</page><page sequence="39">JUSTIFICATION IN JEWISH EDUCATION 39 response to the specific circumstance of a society in which newly arrived im- migrants were a troublesome factor, has until this day remained part of the ideological armamentarium of American Jewish educators. Not only is Berkson's statement a brilliant exposition of the nature of group relationships in a democratic society, in its melding of the American and the Jewish it is also a particularly congenial position for all those concerned with Jewish education. The philosophical underpinnings of the theory, derived as they are from the thought of John Dewey, are rooted in the mainstream of liberal American thought. They are thus acceptable to all those who hold that the health of Jewish education, as well as of the Jewish community at large, depends upon identification with the progressive ele- ments in American society. At the same time those of a more conservative bent can find ample support for the maintenance of their views within the framework of Berkson's ideas. From a Jewish point of view the appeal to the precepts of Ahad Ha'am is a welcome to all those who would reject religious authority as the basis of their allegiance to Judaism. Berkson's reasoning, however, forces the recognition of the legitimate place in the Jewish community, and in America, of those whose Judaism is expressed in religious terms. The idea of "cultural pluralism," the term borrowed by Berkson from Horace Kallen, has, moreover, acquired a new currency in re- cent years. The growing acceptance of the critical and positive function of ethnicity in American life has brought Berkson's work to the attention of a new generation and has lent a new spirit to the proponents of ethnic school systems. The emphasis on the survival of the group which was at the heart of Berkson's position, as well as of that of most of those who concerned themselves with the justification of Jewish education in the United States, rested on the assumption that the legitimization of the group's aspirations was a sufficient condition for the retention of the loyalty of the individual. The needs of the group were held paramount because it was taken for granted that its well-being, a combination of the acquiescence of the ma- jority around it and the desire of its members to secure its continued ex- istence, was assurance of individual self-fulfilment. The denial of one's origins, therefore, was seen not only as a danger to the life of the group but as a deterrent to personal realization as well. Whatever the correctness of this view, it was rarely offered as a specific of a conceptual scheme but rather stated as a datum of conventional wisdom. Appeals to the individual for the affirmation of his fidelity were more often than not couched in moral</page><page sequence="40">40 WALTER I. ACKERMAN terms which paid little attention to deep seated psychological needs. The psychological impact of the group on individual personality and behavior was most completely introduced into the vocabulary of justifica- tion of Jewish education by Kurt Lewin, the noted social psychologist whose pioneering research is the basis of much of our understanding of group dynamics. Against the background of the rise of Hitler to power in Nazi Germany and the attendant shock of antisemitism in the United States, Lewin addressed himself to the role that positive and meaningful identification with the Jewish people might play in providing the Jewish child with the psychological equipment he would require to cope successful- ly with the threats of a hostile environment. Drawing upon his field theory, Lewin's method of analyzing causal relationships and building scientific constructs, he ascribed to Jewish education a central role in the development of psychologically healthy and well adjusted Jews. According to Lewin, the group of which the individual is a member is a critical factor in the determination of his behavior: "The group to which an individual belongs is the ground on which he stands, which gives or denies him social status, gives or denies him security and help .... The firmness and clearness of this ground determine what the individual wishes to do, what he can do, and how he will do it.... From early childhood, social facts, particularly the feeling of belongingness to certain groups, are among the most fundamental constituents of the growing world, and determine what the individual considers right or wrong, his wishes and his goals.""' The maladjusted individual is very often one who is unsure of his ground; his psychological imbalance stems from the ambiguity and uncertainty he suffers regarding the group to which he belongs. Confusion and in- definiteness about belonging are common characteristics of minority group members who for one reason or another attempt to detach themselves from the group of their birth and do not quite succeed in gaining admission into the majority group. Such a person is a "marginal man," hanging somewhere between two worlds, who as a result of the rebuff ". .. is almost perpetually in a state of conflict and tension.""9 In Lewin's view the modern Jew is a prime example of marginality; he is no longer sure of his allegiance to the Jewish group and despite his desire for acceptance he finds himself rejected by the non-Jewish majority. Jews who 118. Kurt Lewin, "When Facing Danger," Resolving Social Conflicts (New York, 1948), P. 174. 119. Ibid., p. 164.</page><page sequence="41">JUSTIFICATION IN JEWISH EDUCATION 41 are no longer sure of why they ought to remain Jewish and yet find themselves excluded by non-Jews are singularly susceptible to that im- balance in behavior which is the consequence of the absence of a firm ground of belongingness. The continued obdurateness of the privileged ma- jority, the result of circumstance as much as of will, coupled with the uncer- tainty of belongingness to the Jewish group of an increasing number of Jews, the result of the modernism which weakened the foundations of traditional Judaism and the political freedom which reduced the differences between Jews and non-Jews, could only increase the incidence of marginality and maladjustment. The dynamics of group interaction as understood by Lewin led him to the conclusion that it was erroneous to assume that the acceptance or rejec- tion of a minority group was in any way connected with its behavior. In his analysis of antisemitism he pointed out that "the Jew answering accusations should realize that they are but a surface below which deeper social problems are hidden, even in those cases where the argument is put forth in good faith. The need of the majority for a scapegoat grows out of tension.... No logical argument will destroy these basic forces ....".120 Jews should be aware of the fact that "more than words of self-defense are necessary to change social reality. . . . The Jew will have to realize that for him as well as for any other underprivileged group the following statement holds: Only the efforts of the group itself will achieve the emancipation of the group.... There is one field of action left to the Jew, where the results depend mainly upon himself. This is the field of Jewish life."l21 The pressures which limit access to the group of one's choice demand of the Jewish parent that he prepare his child for the fact that in later life he is going to be a member of a less privileged minority group. This is best done by ". .. an early buildup of a clear and positive feeling of belongingness to the Jewish group. This is one of the few effective things that Jewish parents can do for the later happiness of their children. In this way parents can minimize the ambiguity and tension inherent in the situation of the Jewish group."'22 Those parents who are chary of intensifying the Jewish identifica- tion of their children lest it compromise their loyalty to America "should not be afraid of so-called 'double allegiance.' Belonging to more than one overlapping group is natural and necessary for everyone. The real danger 120. Ibid., p. 163. 121. Ibid. 122.

ACKERMAN lies in 'standing' nowhere, in being a 'marginal man,' an 'eternal adolescent.' ,"23 Education is clearly a necessary factor in the forming of the individual whose identification with an underprivileged minority is strong and positive enough to overcome the feelings of inferiority and fear which often are the concomitants of membership in low-status groups. The Jewish school is a critical arena for the buildup of "a clear and fully accepted belonging."'24 It is the office of the school to help the Jewish child understand that because "the Jewish question is a social problem rather than an individual problem of good behavior,"'25 all Jews share a common fate. A grasp of this sociological fact is the basis for the development of the sense of in- terdependence which constitutes a group and the establishment of a firm social ground. The school program should attempt to provide the youngster "with a long-range view which includes the past and the future of Jewish life and links the solution of the minority problem with the problem of the welfare of all human beings .... ."126 The end product of the educational process conceived in these terms should be an individual willing to "accept active responsibility and sacrifice for the group."'27 Lewin contends, in fact, that demanding a spirit of self-sacrifice for the sake of a group whose fate has positive meaning is one of the more effective ways of heightening the in- dividual's sense of belonging and personal well-being.128 Whatever the play of external circumstance, however, it is the individual who, in the final analysis, determines his relationship to the group. As Lewin points out, "an important factor for the strength of the forces toward and away from the group is the degree to which the fulfillment of the in- dividual's own needs is furthered or hampered by his membership in the group."'29 The many factors which impinge upon the generation of in- dividual needs and their fulfilment make it difficult, of course, to isolate the role of the school. To the extent, however, that education is conceived as a process which contributes in some degree to the achievement of an equilibrium in the need system of the individual, Lewin's observation has significant implications.

The individual, his needs and his interests, become at least as important a factor in the planning of curricula and the determination of learning experiences as subject matter and the requirements of the group. Indeed there are those who would claim that the centrality of the individual is paramount and that the weight ascribed to his concerns is the touchstone of the school ex- perience. Many Jewish educators, of his own time and later, eagerly seized on Lewin's theory of group identification in their endeavors to justify the ac- tivities of Jewish schools. By and large, however, relatively few efforts were made to read that theory in terms of the individual. The Jewish group and its continued existence retained its primacy as the source of authority for curriculum development; the pupil and his needs remained subsets of the social construct. It was not until recently that Jewish schools began to pay more than lip service to the idea of meaningful attention to the place of in- dividual needs and interests in the development of the school program.130 The view of Jewish education as a means of defense in the struggle of an embattled minority against the blandishments and threats of a powerful ma- jority is, of course, not restricted to Lewin alone. It is a posture he shares with all those whose views we have brought here. This is a position which, among other things, rests on the assumption that the culture of the majority is ineluctably attractive-a perception characteristic of immigrant com- munities. It is understandable, therefore, that no little of the effort expended in the justification of Jewish education was, as we have indicated above, directed toward establishing the compatibility of Jewishness and Judaism with the norms and values of America. Quite a different attitude is discerni- ble in the writings of younger Jewish educators to whom the immigrant ex- perience and the terror of antisemitism speak only through the filter of the memories of an older generation. The cadence of their thought clearly takes its beat from the events that racked America in the decade of the sixties. The position taken by these young men and women, recent additions to the ranks of professional Jewish educators, is one in which the relationship of Jews to America is tempered by the critique of American society and culture which characterizes the "counter-culture." The general dissatisfac- tion with American life which was part and parcel of the civil rights cause and the anti-Vietnam movement is reflected in the declaration that "we are 130.

ACKERMAN not interested in raising Judaism's hemline, in watering down her claims to make them compatible with American culture; indeed to respond to the pull of our history and tradition is to feel increasingly uncomfortable with much of what is happening in America. . . ."131 The attempts of previous genera- tions of Jewish educators to find points of contact between the teachings of Judaism and the American "way of life" are rejected because "... demon- strations of Judaism's compatibility with American life are pathetically uninteresting.... Increasing numbers of Jewish teenagers are them- selves uncomfortable with their governmental, cultural and economic surroundings."'32 To identify with "authentic" Jews and Judaism, a process understood as a continued search for self-realization rather than the accep- tance of a closed system of pre-ordained imperatives, is to discover an alter- native to the vacuity of American life. A Jewish school informed by this view is the first step in the creation of a community which is a haven for those who are increasingly critical of and alienated from America. The school is that place which should expose its pupils to the richness of the Jewish tradition in all its varied expressions and thereby lay the foundation of a life which is more meaningful than that offered by a "rather mindless and anti-nomian government, a plastic culture and an economic system which unwittingly destroys communities and corrupts interpersonal relationships."'33 The material discussed in this paper is drawn from sources which extend over a period of more than one hundred years-from the middle of the nineteenth century up to the present. It is representative of the arguments used by Jewish educators to justify their efforts throughout that time and reflects the issues which concerned and still affect Jewish education. At the same time, it mirrors attitudes and behaviors inside the Jewish community and without. Our study indicates, moreover, that Jewish educators have found it constantly necessary to plead the cause of Jewish education before an audience which by and large no longer considers the sanctions of the religious tradition either authoritative or binding. Even though the themes of justification echo specific events, as we have attempted to show, the lines of argument are remarkably consistent and contain common elements which underscore persistent problems. 131.
