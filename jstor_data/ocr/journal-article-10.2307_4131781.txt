Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000. xi, 270 pp. As crusaders swept through the Rhineland in 1096 en route to the Holy Land, they brought destruction to Ashkenazic Jewry, through death or forced con- version. Record of this violence has survived in Latin and Hebrew chronicles as well as in Hebrew dirges. These chronicles have been the subject of intense scruti- ny since their publication in 1892. Attention has focused on accounts that in Worms, Mainz, and elsewhere Jews killed their family members and then them- selves when the enemy was at the door. The Hebrew sources glorify these acts of self-destruction as the embodiment of the religious ideal of martyrdom, Kiddush Hashem. Two decades have witnessed a shift in methodological focus, from what the chronicles say to the way they say it. In 1982 Ivan Marcus questioned the as- sumption that the narratives provide a reasonably accurate report of the events. He argued that the texts attest to the concerns of their authors, rather than those of the protagonists, and that they represent "fictions of a particular religious imagination."' Similarly, Jeremy Cohen has devoted several studies to the cultur- al context of images and symbols employed by the narrators. Symptomatic of the decline in the credibility of the chronicles is the assertion, which has entered the mainstream of scholarship, that many, if not most, Jews chose apostasy over death, despite the fact that the chronicles depict martyrdom as the predominant response. Robert Chazan has been one of the leading figures in this field of scholar- ship. His European Jewry and the First Crusade (Berkeley, 1987) is a thorough scholarly treatment; In the Year 1096 (Philadelphia, 1996) is a more popular sur- vey of the subject, with an innovative discussion of its place in modern historiog- raphy. In these works, and in a dozen articles, Chazan has consistently defended the "facticity" of the chronicles, though he, too, has been attentive to issues con- cerning the needs of the narrators and their literary techniques. God, Humanity, and History (GHH), Chazan's latest contribution, addresses the fundamental ques- 1. Ivan G. Marcus, "From Politics to Martyrdom.

The thrust of GHH is Chazan's characterization of the messages of the nar- ratives as "time-bound" and "timeless." The former motif is intended "to provide guidance for that time when the next threat of anti-Jewish hostility would devel- op" (p. 112). Chazan terms this approach "time-bound," because he claims that the Mainz Anonymous, in his view the earliest and most important Hebrew narrative, was written on the eve of the Second Crusade, when "guidance" would have been particularly handy. The idea of studying the past behavior of the enemy in order to prepare for an approaching confrontation seems anachronistic; a mode of thought character- istic of modern (American?) culture, rather than of medieval Europe. A more fun- damental problem is that the narrators do not explicitly mention any immediate practical purpose. Nor is it clear what the readers could have learned, even in the- ory, from the behavior of the assailants and victims of 1096. Chazan is aware of this last problem. We read, concerning the behavior of bishop Engilbert of Trier: "Clearly there was not a lot to learn from all this for the future" (p. 116). He also makes the general remark: "no clear-cut messages can readily be distilled" from the narratives (p. 117). The terms time-bound and timeless are also problematic. The narratives scarcely seem time-bound if, centuries later, Jews could have continued to draw upon them for strategic guidance. Moreover, subsequent generations, too, would have been profoundly moved by the memorialization of the victims, a second time- bound motif identified by Chazan. Conversely, concerns that Chazan deems time- less were obviously as important to the Jews of 1096 as they were to those of oth- er eras. If time-bound messages are also timeless, and vice versa, the classification scheme appears unhelpful. Theodicy is the quintessential timeless issue. Chazan explains that one ap- proach to this problem in the narratives is that the persecutions were, simply, a di- vine decree (i.e. no explanation). Another view, located in the chronicle of Solo- mon bar Simson, sees the horrors of 1096 as retribution for the Golden Calf episode. The latter explanation is derived from the narrative's statement that there existed a decree from "the day of my accounting," a phrase found in the Golden Calf story. This explanation is questionable, for the medieval narrator may have used the phrase rhetorically, to indicate generally that the violence was retribution for past sins-not necessarily for the Golden Calf. The primary timeless motif is that God will-and must-reward the su- preme heroism and devotion of the martyrs and exact retribution from the as- sailants. This, says Chazan, is a novel view of God's role in history, the innovative contribution of these writings. I would emphasize the delicate relationship be- tween "will" and "must": The expressions of certainty may represent positive think- ing, rather than absolute conviction, for the petitionary element betrays lingering, pervasive anxiety. Chazan is at his best when he tackles the thorny problems of the chronolo- gy and authorship of the different chronicles, and the relationship of the narratives to one another. His analysis of their structure and literary characteristics is sensi- 125</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews tive and path-breaking. For example, he portrays the Mainz Anonymous as tightly organized, and therefore the work of a single author, contrasting this with the chronicle of Solomon bar Simson, which he characterizes as a clumsy compila- tion of earlier sources. Novel and intriguing, too, is Chazan's suggestion that the reports in the latter chronicle of the Cologne persecutions and of the events at Tri- er are independent narratives. The final chapters are an ambitious and enlightening comparison of the He- brew narratives with medieval Hebrew storytelling and with the Gesta Francorum, a contemporary Latin chronicle. Chazan maintains that the Hebrew narratives are unprecedented in Hebrew literature, but strongly resemble the Gesta Francorum. In particular, the Hebrew and Latin texts emphasize the centrality of human ac- tion, rather than the divine manipulation of history, an idea that Chazan reason- ably sets in the context of the twelfth-century Renaissance. GHH greatly advances the study of the 1096 catastrophe and its immortal- ization through the author's thorough and trenchant analysis and his thoughtful and creative insights. It provides a much-needed springboard for further research into an endlessly relevant chapter in Jewish history, one that is both painful and fasci- nating.
