<plain_text><page sequence="1">R. Abraham Ibn Ezra. Yesod Mora ve-Sod Torah.- The Foundation ofPiety and the Secret of the Torah, an annotated critical edition by Joseph Cohen, in collaboration with Uriel Simon. Ramat-Gan: Bar-Ilan University Press, 2002. 232 pp. All histories of Jewish philosophy have an entry on Abraham Ibn Ezra despite the fact that all agree that he produced no philosophical books or even essays. Yet he certainly has earned a place in these histories because just about all Jewish thinkers, including giants such as Gersonides, reckon with Ibn Ezra's views at some point or other. Just how or why Ibn Ezra achieved this stature is, to my mind, one of the enigmas of Jewish intellectual history, but that is not our concern here. The closest Ibn Ezra came to writing a coherent philosophical work is the tract under review here, Yesod Mora ve-Sod Torah. Ostensibly a monograph on ta'amei ha-mizvot, or the rationale underlying the biblical commandments, Yesod Mora also conveys Ibn Ezra's better-known teachings on astrology and arithmology. The gist of Ibn Ezra's message is that the individual must exert himself in self-perfection, with the ultimate goal of recognizing as best he can God's handiworks, of which the biblical commandments are one example. Like Ibn Ezra's writings in other fields, Yesod Mora is short and enigmatic and exists in many, many manuscript copies. Accordingly, Ibn Ezra's text takes up only a small portion of Cohen's edition-on average, about five lines per page on pages 61-204, in a large font. It is furnished with a very detailed and lengthy commentary, and manuscript variants are listed in the apparatus. 460</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews To avoid a cumbersome and probably useless apparatus, the editors had to choose only a few of the thirty-nine manuscripts and early printings available to them. They availed themselves of a partial collation prepared some years ago by Shoshanah Levin, which they used to narrow the selection even more, ultimately settling on five manuscripts, which are described in detail on pages 21-22. Personally, I would not have rejected out of hand incomplete copies, as they have done; the fact that the vagaries of time caused some pages to fall out of a particular copy says nothing about the quality of the text transmitted. This is billed as the first critical edition; nevertheless, I did not notice any passage in which the difficulties of interpretation had been eliminated on account of better readings. By far, the lion's share of the book is taken up by the commentary, in which I include not just the very copious explanatory notes that run alongside the text but also an introduction of some fifty pages. Ibn Ezra prefers the hit-and-run approach in Yesod Mora, just as he does in his biblical commentaries, leaving it to the reader or commentator to flesh out the full import of his remarks and to place them as best he or she can within a consistent and embracing religious philosophy. As a rule, the commentators search other writings-in particular, Ibn Ezra's commentaries on the Torah-for related pronouncements in the hope of unscrambling his secrets and piecing together his philosophy. However, this alone is not enough; the commentator usually has some general idea of the direction in which he thinks Ibn Ezra is pulling and uses this as a guide in piecing together the texts. The main difference between the medievals and the modems is that the latter tend to employ classificatory schemes; Ibn Ezra most often is sorted into the box labeled "neo-Platonic," and his views are expected to align themselves accordingly. Cohen is right in calling attention to Ibn Ezra's Pythagoreanism (54), but his account of that school is flawed. First, I do not know what he means when he says that Ibn Ezra's "analogical thinking" betrays a Pythagorean "influence." The ancient Pythagoreans taught that the earth moves around a central fire, though I am sure that many medievals whom we would label Pythagorean held that the cosmos is a rotating sphere. However, the idea that time is the number of motion is a distinctly Aristotelian teaching. Plato puts forth a very different theory in his famous Pythagorean dialogue Timaeus, and his views were further developed by Proclus and lamblichus. Again, Cohen is correct in connecting Sefer Yezirah to Pythagoreanism, but the link that he sees between Sefer Yezirah and Ibn Ezra's disquisitions on the arithmology of the tetragrammaton just does not exist. These errors with regard to Pythagoreanism are not representative of the quality of the commentary. Cohen is certainly alert to the difficulties of trying to construct a coherent philosophy out of Ibn Ezra's remarks. His introduction and commentary are thorough and, barring the criticism of the preceding para- graph, quite acceptable. To my taste, Cohen's style lacks academic polish-but then again, it is free of the pretensions that one sometimes finds in academic writing, especially on Ibn Ezra. Ibn Ezra's entire religious philosophy devolves around a small set of ideas that are enunciated in various places in his oeuvre; 461</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews these have been gathered here for the purposes of explicating Yesod Mora, and the edition has been provided with a good index. For all of these reasons, this edition serves as a handy compendium of Ibn Ezra's thought. Y. Tzvi Langermann Bar-Ilan University Ramat-Gan, Israel</page></plain_text>
