New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006. xvi, 246 pp. doi:10.1017/S036400940800127X In this first book, based on her dissertation work, Elizabeth Shanks Alexander opens up for inquiry the very foundations, assumptions, and purpose of the Mishnah. Using the field of orality studies, she studies one specific tractate, Tractate Shevu'ot, by holding the presumptions of orality theorists against the evidence of the Mishnah. What emerges is a fresh conception of the character of the Mishnah itself. Alexander's goal is to demonstrate that the Mishnah did not begin as a cano nically rigid oral text recited by those who memorized it by rote. Rather, she pre sents the Mishnah as a fluid "text," shaped by structural frameworks, fixed phrases, and conceptual concerns that "could be constructed anew in various per formative settings" (74). The differentiation between a fluid and a fixed text has ramifications for our understanding of the authority with which the Mishnah was received, and for the process of transmission itself. In the first chapter, Alexander argues that the Mishnah and Tosefta may be conceptualized as two oral recitations of the same fluid text. Because the text itself is not a series of words but rather a series of structures, concepts, and phrases that could be constructed at will, the Mishnah and Tosefta are to be con sidered both equally valid renderings of the same underlying text. The texts are gov erned by similar rules, making them always the same in essence, if not in form. This analysis allows the Mishnah and Tosefta to be truly parallel texts without hierarch ical conceptions of textual corruption, but it cannot account for where the Mishnah and Tosefta differ dramatically. While this chapter offers some interesting comments on the relationship between Mishnah and Tosefta, these same phenomena can (and have been) productively explained by theories of textual and not oral transmission. The same may be said of her second chapter, in which she argues that the Mishnah grew in authority and was granted special authoritative status by the time of the Talmuds, but "more so" in Babylonia because of a growing ideology of textual fixity. This chapter has more to do with talmudic hermeneutics than the oral nature of the Mishnah, and as such, this chapter is somewhat tangential to her larger argument. It works best in constradistinction to the previous chapter, in which it seemed as though serendipity, audience, and chance played large roles in establishing the wording of the Mishnah. By contrast, the Talmuds attribute tremen dous deliberation and intentionality to the precise wording. Still, without a broader accounting of the various well-noted differences between the two Talmuds, it is unclear that the differences she notes in the treatment of mishnaic sources should be attributed to a chronological trend toward greater mishnaic authority. However, in the second half of the book, the payoff of the "oral conceptual lens" becomes much clearer. Chapter 3 presents a study of the casuistic form in Mishnah Shevu'ot. Alexander demonstrates that the recitation of the Mishnah involved complicated forms of legal reasoning, and she argues that the Mishnah models the process of legal analysis for its students. For example, Alexander 410</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews argues for a reinterpretation of the "borderline" case in the Mishnah as serving an important pedagogical purpose. She writes, "borderline cases sensitize students, readers, and listeners to the complicating factors within a case, and they alert them to the many alternative principles by which any given legal conundrum might be resolved" (167). Using the vantage point of orality studies, Alexander develops a genuinely new account of the pedagogical purposes of the Mishnah?one that is ulti mately convincing. Under a conception of oral performance, the recitation of the Mishnah is both a normative process of law and a performance of legal reasoning itself. While these conclusions could theoretically be borne out also by a theory of textual transmission, Alexander explains, "Though the textually crystallized version of M. Shevu'ot before us today presents a series of analytic exercises that have already been performed and solved, we can also read the textual artifact as an invitation to reenact the exercises" (169). Indeed, Alexander invites her own readers to do exactly that by continuing the tradition she writes about?to continue the performance of the texts by contemplating oaths, liability, and logical puzzles. This confluence of invitation and analysis lends all the more credibility to her analysis in Chapter 4, which opens with an unexpected surprise: By focusing on the oral performative aspects of the texts rather than more traditional considerations of lit erary genre, Alexander is able to show continuity between tannaitic and late amoraic (even stammaitic!) forms of legal reasoning. She argues that forms of legal reasoning which take precedence in oral reasoning continue to play a large role in shaping the text, suggesting that "the same intellectual habits?valuing the ability to view a matter from two different and even mutually exclusive perspectives?are cultivated by both the teyku problem and the borderline case" (190). Intriguingly, Alexander's analysis of legal reasoning as a part of oral performance manages to blur the usually sharp line of demarcation between tannaitic and amoraic thinking. That said, the greatest challenge of this book is its scope. While Alexander attempts to limit her findings to the tractate of Shevu'ot, in this endeavor she is ulti mately unsuccessful. As she is making claims about the intellectual habits and culture of the sages, it is simply impossible to consider the purpose of Tractate Shevu'ot as an enterprise separate from that of the Mishnah overall. She claims an "intellectual milieu" that cannot be coherently restricted to only certain chapters of the Mishnah. This reader is left with questions about the application of these theories to other parts of rabbinic literature, whose evidence leaves contradictory imprints. Throughout, Alexander manages to explain difficult legal concepts about oaths in simple and elegant language, making this book suitable not only for the advanced scholar of rabbinics but also for novices who may find it of interest. It presents a clear thesis about the origins and purpose of the Mishnah that should be considered by all Mishnah scholars, but it also could serve as an excellent introduction to Jewish legal thinking for undergraduates or scholars of law. Its accessibility and clarity are ultimately winning. Ariella Radwin University of California Los Angeles, California 411</page></plain_text>
