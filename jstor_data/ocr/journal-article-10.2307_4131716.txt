See, for example, two books that he edited or co-edited: Art and Its Uses: The Visual Image and Modern Jewish Society (Studies in Contemporary Jewry: An Annual, Vol. VI) (New York: Oxford University Press, 1990) and From Court Jews to the Rothschilds: Art, Patronage, and Power 1600- 1800 (Munich: Prestel, 1996). 378</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Jewish Icons: Art and Society in Modern Europe, is a thoughtful, well-written, and original account of how Jews interacted with the non-Jewish world through art. This text is not a seamless narrative. Rather, Cohen rightly has organized it as sep- arate essays, fragments of a history of the relationship of Jews to modern art. The book's greatest strengths lie in its interdisciplinary approach, its exploration of lit- tle-known objects, and its examination of a broad range of Jewish art patrons. Or- ganized chronologically, the book begins with a chapter on early modern Christian images of Jewish rituals. The second chapter explores Jewish ceremonial objects, and subsequent chapters examine portraits of rabbis, nostalgic images of the ghet- to, the history of Jewish art collections, and representations of Jewish homeless- ness and hopelessness. The word "icon" in the title appears in two contexts. On the one hand, it refers to portraits of rabbis, which had a hagiographical function.2 On the other hand, it refers to David Roskies' description of Samuel Hirszenberg's Ex- ile (1904) as "the first icon of Jewish suffering" (p. 234). The last four chapters are especially persuasive. Chapter Three examines a long-neglected but important subject: portraits of rabbis dating from the seven- teenth through the nineteenth century. At first rabbis were shown alone, in half- length, and gazing intently at the viewer while holding a book or seated in a library. Cohen convincingly demonstrates that such renderings were designed to exalt the rabbi, to construct him as spiritual and learned, and to foster a close emotional bond between viewer and subject. Breaking with the centuries-old injunction against portraiture, traditional Jews adopted modern techniques to bolster Orthodoxy. Lat- er mass-produced prints displayed rows of portrait heads of prominent Jews, in- cluding rabbis, to satisfy a growing "interest in history and national conscious- ness" (pp. 149-150). The fourth chapter examines how assimilated Jews of the second half of the nineteenth century produced idealized images of traditional Jewish life, untouched by modernity. Cohen persuasively argues that "feelings of disorientation and emptiness" among urban Jews produced nostalgic feelings for the life they had left behind (p. 156); they eagerly embraced images that visualized ghetto life as filled with warmth and contentment. In the fifth chapter, Cohen explores the range of motivations that sparked the development of Jewish art collections in the second half of the nineteenth centu- ry. Private and public collections served to satisfy nostalgic longing; to preserve local history; to prove that Jews were cultured and refined; to demonstrate their contributions to their countries; and to promote a sense of Jewish nationalism and historical consciousness. The last chapter focuses on images created by Jews in re- sponse to the pogroms of 1881 and 1903. Cohen shows that, in contrast to the pos- itive images of the mid-century, later ones portray Jewish life as filled with pover- ty, despair, and endless wandering. The greatest weakness of the book is the first chapter, which is based on a series of false assumptions. First, Cohen claims that images of Jewish rituals by Christian artists are "drawn from direct observation." "It is hard to imagine," he writes, "that such drawings could have been executed without the artist's presence 2. Cohen's third chapter is entitled "Rabbi as Icon." 379</page><page sequence="3">AJS Review and direct observation" (p. 57). Yet knowledge of Jewish ritual could have been transmitted in other ways: orally, through texts, or through images in books on Jew- ish customs. Cohen's conclusion contradicts what we know about the practices of early modern artists. Final works (as opposed to preparatory sketches) did not re- produce what artists saw; rather, artists created images that looked realistic but were in fact constructed.3 Second, Cohen repeatedly argues that these images are objective. His the- sis-that "images can reflect social reality"-is first stated in the introduction (p. 8), and then developed insistently throughout the first chapter. Art has a point of view; it is not a mirror of reality. But for Cohen, images by Christians are "es- sentially objective" (p. 18); show an "objective interest in Jews" (p. 22); "offer an objective treatment of Jewish ceremony" (p. 44); are "realistic" (p. 54); and "document the rite faithfully" (p. 60). Because Cohen views these images as ob- jective, he fails to recognize those elements that denigrate Jews. For example, fig- ure four shows Jewish women talking in synagogue during a religious ceremony. In contrast, images in Jewish books omit such negative behavior.4 Instead, they idealize Jewish ritual, and everyone, including women and children, pays atten- tion. Since Christians repeatedly condemned women who gossiped during reli- gious services,5 the motif of the talkative Jewesses would have been interpreted negatively by Christian viewers. Similarly, a Christian image of a Jewish circum- cision shows blood on the infant's cushion (fig. 18). Again this motif does not ap- pear in contemporary Jewish images and is probably meant as a criticism. Cohen points to the presence of dogs as proof of another print's realism (p. 54), but dogs were considered especially odious and often used to denigrate figures portrayed nearby.6 Concerning B6ner's print of Jewish women, Cohen concludes that "two of them appear with their backs turned to the viewer, intimating their consent to show him the backside of these clothes, while a third stands with her coat removed to demonstrate the garments underneath" (p. 55). But there is no evidence that the women posed. The artist may well be denigrating the figures by showing them from the rear and with their undergarments displayed.7 Because some Christian images of Jewish ritual include Christian specta- 3.

He writes, "The Jew harbors no objections to having a Christian view his service" (p. 63). But when both artist and patron are Christian, we can conclude nothing about how actual Jews felt, only about how Christians constructed that re- sponse. In fact, images of Jewish rituals made for a Jewish audience include no Christians.8 Can we understand the motivations and practices of real Jews from a study of Christian art? Art made by and for Christians can only reveal something about Christian attitudes toward Jews. Furthermore, a realistic style is not equivalent to an objective one. When artists adopt a realistic style, they convince viewers all the more that their images-even those that denigrate-are fact, not fantasy. But is determining the accuracy of these images the most important question? It might be better to ask who was the intended audience for these images and what ideo- logical function they perform. Although there are weaknesses in the first chapter, Cohen's book greatly ex- pands our knowledge of Jewish art in the modern period. Cohen embraces the study of both "high and low" art (p. 8); laments the traditional privileging of Jew- ish texts over Jewish visual culture (p. 3); and rightly observes that the earliest his- torians of Jewish art were largely devoted to "documenting and describing" (p. 7), whereas later scholars, like Cohen himself, can address other issues. We have much to learn from his work. Diane Wolfthal Arizona State University Tempe, Arizona</page></plain_text>
