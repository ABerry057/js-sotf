Brill, 1995. xiii, 455 pp. Jews writing in the Persian language produced a rich literature largely unknown outside a tiny circle of scholarship. The two best-known figures are poets: Shahin (13th-14th cent.) and 'Emrani, the first half of whose Ganj-ndme ("Book of Treasure") is edited and translated in the current volume. David Yeroushalmi's critical study discusses the entire work and</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 261 provides an introduction to Judeo-Persian literature as well as to 'Emrani's life and literary output as a whole. Yeroushalmi has established that 'Emrini was born in 1454 in Isfahan, and moved as a young man to Kashan. He was about eighty when he wrote the Ganj-ndme, a commentary on chapters 1-4 of Mishnah 'Avot. He probably died shortly after the completion of this work in 1536. In this, as in his other works, 'Emrani is at once totally Jewish and thoroughly Islamic-Iranian. Intimately conversant with Bible, midrash, halakhah, and kabbalah, 'Emrani nevertheless makes frequent use of the concepts and language of Islamic society, including Sufism. Biblical figures are often presented by their Persian or Islamic names, not the Hebrew. There are references to the Qur'an, and especially to Ferdawsi, Sa'adi, and Hgfez, which his readers would surely have recognized. Perhaps most interesting is 'Emrani's commitment to Sufi-style devotion and piety. He recommends studying under a Master (whom he calls a pir), in comradeship with other disciples. A recurrent theme is attention to achieving "understanding in the heart," the organ which is ... the substance and being of life Immersed in (Divine) Attributes and submerged in the essence of being ... (For) the heart is the reflection of the Majestic Light, Adjacent to the Divine Favor. (37:25, 35) It is typical of 'Emrani's approach to gloss the "three pillars" of Rabbi Shim'on b. Gamaliel's dictum ('Avot 1:18) as Revealed Law, Path (Tariqat), and Truth. Furthermore, he notes that the way to Truth is through 'elm ("religious knowledge," i.e., Torah) and Divine Law, loyalty to which should be achieved first, and then the Path, which requires an elder, a guide (24:3-8). Yeroushalmi's discussion of the Sufi-style elements of this work is enlightening; 'Emrani's pietism, however, invites further, more extended study. In the 4,800 verses of the Ganj-ndme 'Emrani did not attempt to use 'Avot as a framework for a systematic work. Rather, the sayings of the sages were occasions and springboards for his insights into ethics and especially piety. Yeroushalmi, although noting reconstructions of the history of the composition of 'Avot, does not reflect on why 'Emrini commented only on the first four chapters, except, perhaps, to imply that he may have cut short</page><page sequence="3">262 BOOK REVIEWS his project due to increasing awareness of his advanced age, reflected in comments toward the end of the work. It seems likely, however, that 'Emrini considered the maxims of the first four books to be perfect for his purpose, unlike the statements of the fifth chapter (or the sixth chapter, qinyan Torah, usually added to 'Avot). In any case, the work has come down to us complete, in numerous manuscripts; 'Emrani's conclusion appears after the commentary on chapter 4. 'Emrani does not repeat the text of the Mishnah, introducing each section simply with, for example, "Yehudah ben Tabbay says" (sec. 14 on 'Avot 1:3); in many but not all cases, this is a translation of the phrase introducing the sage's statements; the original text would have been well known to Persian Jews. Sometimes there is only a tenuous connection between the Mishnah text and his poetic elaboration. Ben Tabbay urges judges to consider litigants guilty before judgment but innocent after having accepted the sentence. 'Emrani's concluding sentiments on this mishnah may derive from reflections about one who ignores ben Tabbay's dictum by taking a bribe but carry the thought much further: He who does not strive truthfully Who is engaged in hypocrisy and deceit, You shall regard the prayer shawl which covers his head As the saddlebag of a donkey that is laid over him. (14:27-28) Yeroushalmi's edition of the Persian relied on numerous manuscripts from the United States and Israel, and his English translation captures some of the poetic power of the original. Although at times necessarily technical, his comments include a good introduction and analysis. The bibliography shows broad and careful reading of Western-language, Hebrew, and Persian materials. Pirqe 'Avot is one of the most beloved and popular works in the spectrum of Jewish literature. A translation of Emrani's entire work would be desirable; perhaps even the simultaneous appearance of a Hebrew version as well as an English one. 'Emrani's commentary might well be of general interest to numerous scholars who study the history of ethics and pietism, which among Jews was often expressed in the form of 'Avot commentaries. Moreover, given the popularity of 'Avot, an accessible, complete translation might greatly promote interest in Judeo-Persian poetry among a broad and diverse</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 263 audience in the Jewish community. This reviewer found 'Emrani's comments to be delightfully enchanting; this wonderful example of Judeo-Persian poetry deserves wide dissemination among scholars and laymen.
