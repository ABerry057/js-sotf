<plain_text><page sequence="1">Moshe Aberbach. Labor, Crafts and Commerce in Ancient Israel. Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1994. xii, 294 pp. This book opens with a clear statement of purpose: in the face of antisemitic charges that Jews are parasites, and unwilling to work, Moshe Aberbach asserts the high moral value associated in Jewish tradition with manual work as a means of earning one's livelihood. His purpose is to "correct widespread misconceptions concerning Jewish economic activity throughout history; to demonstrate Jewish participation in every facet of economic life . .. above all, to emphasize the moral significance attached to labor in biblical and rabbinic literature alike" (p. xi). This seems to promise a study of biblical and rabbinic attitudes to labor, based on a survey of Jewish involvement in economic activity. What we get is somewhat different: a vast compendium of anecdotal evidence relating to labor, crafts, and trade, much of it of great intrinsic interest. But serious deficiencies of substance and method make it unlikely that Aberbach has achieved his stated aim. To begin with issues of substance, Aberbach has here assembled an</page><page sequence="2">382 BOOK REVIEWS uncritical collection of stories concerning various crafts, trades, and profes- sions, organized chronologically into seven chapters dealing with biblical, Hellenistic, rabbinic, and talmudic materials in order; two chapters (4 and 6) explicitly address attitudes toward physical labor and various trades, desirable and undesirable. The last chapter assembles anecdotes concerning the rela- tionship between masters and apprentices. There is no explicit conclusion; similarly we are plunged in medias res without the benefit of an introduction discussing methodological issues or the history of the subject. Perhaps no study of this sort could be meaningful if it did not present us with a mass of detail about a wide variety of occupations. And the superabundance of evidence certainly demonstrates that Jews did participate in every facet of economic life. Too often Aberbach appears to digress into the study of the occupations themselves-a vast inquiry which is necessarily superficial and largely derived from the traditional modern authorities (M. Jastrow, S. Krauss, J. Preuss, for example) and from some specialized studies (especially evident is Aberbach's debt to M. Wischnitzer). Many of the stories which Aberbach assembles are amusing and instruc- tive, though their deeper meaning, as often, seems hidden from Aberbach's passing glance: the fuller on the roof who committed suicide by jumping down soon after the death of R. Judah the Patriarch, for instance (p. 216)-what does knowledge of his trade add to our understanding of the story--or knowledge of this story contribute to an evaluation of the fulling trade? "It demonstrates close relations between the Patriarch and an ordinary fuller who frequently visited him" (ibid.). This might suggest that the fulling trade was perfectly respectable-or that the relationship with the Patriarch transcended the barrier of social status! The anecdotal structure of this collection and the lack of any sophisticated methodology too often leads the author to pass over issues of substance in favor of a patronizing or flippant remark which tells us more about the attitudes of the author than about the values implicit in the "sources" (e.g., pp. 47, 99, 100, 128, 141, 188, 202 n. 1052, 237--to list only the egregious examples). The reader will search in vain for any protracted critical discussion of ancient attitudes toward manual labor, crafts, or professions. Also missing is any systematic study of texts which have as their explicit purpose the expression or evaluation of ancient attitudes toward work. To what extent can we expect texts to provide answers to questions which are not on their agenda (the story of the saintly shepherd retold on p. 230 does not intend to cast light on the shepherd's trade-nor does it do so unintentionally). Would it not be wiser to focus our attention on texts which</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 383 have more to offer? Inspection of the index of sources cited by Aberbach reveals a characteristic propensity to cite one set of texts more frequently than others. Several pages from Kiddushin in the Babylonian Talmud, for instance, speak rather eloquently of the worth of various crafts or occupations; similar "clusters" of citations are found from Baba Batra and Berakhot. It would seem more efficient to focus on these major texts which deal directly with the value of labor and to examine closely their structure and contents, rather than attempting to infer the values and the agenda implicit in a whole collection of anecdotes. Aberbach's work is also flawed by methodological deficiencies. He shows no awareness of the rhetorical values, practices, and structures of his "source" documents. In particular, many of these anecdotes show a marked tendency to hyperbole; amusing misconceptions arise from reading them with a naive literalism (e.g., pp. 67, 112, 187; by contrast the role of hyperbole is recognized on p. 122). Again each text has its own agenda; some few deal directly with the issues in which Aberbach is interested, but most contribute only indirectly to this discussion. A more subtle methodology would facilitate the classification and use of most of these anecdotes, as I have suggested. The tendency to assess all anecdotes as a priori equal in value regardless of their context and purpose in that context often leads to an amusing impasse: camel-drivers are either robbers or worthy men; sailors are uniformly pious, unless we are to read one text as referring to sailors rather than barbers (pp. 220, 232). Of course, paradox is a rhetorical device much favored by the rabbis; but many apparent contradictions may best be understood as arising from the apologetic needs of different contexts--or simply from the fluid nature of oral tradition. On one occasion a "fuller was sent by the rabbis on a confidential mission to R. Eleazar ben Azariah"; but "according to another version it was R. Akiba (who is not known ever to have been a fuller) who carried out this task" (p. 215). How are we to assess these narrative variations? Familiar to every student of rabbinic literature, they represent an insoluble problem for a scholar who takes every tradition literally and as of equal value. Aberbach's study provokes a very fundamental question: Can these sources be made to answer the questions which he addresses to them regarding changing attitudes to labor, craftwork, and the professions in ancient Jewish tradition? The innocent or naive reader, however delighted by the narrative riches on display here, may be tempted to despair. Even the greatest optimist will concede that a more sophisticated methodology must be brought to bear</page><page sequence="4">384 BOOK REVIEWS on these data, if they are to help us understand what value was attached to labor among Jews in ancient times.
