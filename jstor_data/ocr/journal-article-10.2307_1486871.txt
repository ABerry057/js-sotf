Harvard Semitic Monographs 54. Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1995. xxv, 463 pp. This work differs from previous studies of ancient Near Eastern health care in two important ways. First, it approaches the subject from a modem medical-anthropological perspective. Thus, it attempts no diagnoses, but rather it examines the socioreligious dynamics that determined Greece, Mesopotamia, and Israel's own conceptions of illness. According to Hector Avalos: "It is often more important to understand what an ancient culture defined as an 'illness' than what the actual cause might have been from a modem scientific standpoint" (p. 27). Second, this work focuses on the role of the temple as a health care provider. For this Avalos limits his comparisons to three possible medical functions (i.e., petition, therapy, and thanksgiving) of the temples of Asclepius in Greece, Gula/Ninisina in Mesopotamia, and Yahweh in Israel. His comparisons reveal significant differences between the temples' functions: ". .. the temple of Gula was a resource center that stored and distributed information and paraphernalia to the health consultants. It also had a thanksgiving function, and perhaps petitionary and therapeutic functions on a limited scale. In Greece, the Asclepieion was a locus which definitely had petitionary, therapeutic, and thanksgiving functions for patients" (p. 395). Avalos attributes the lack of an infirmary in the temple of Gula to a Mesopotamian medical theology in which numerous "senders/controllers" of an illness were essential for therapy. "Thus, regardless of the existence of a healing deity, ultimate relief was centered in contacting and entreating the correct 'sender/controller' of an illness, and not the healing deity" (p. 227). By contrast, Avalos attributes the prominence which the Jerusalem temple placed on its thanksgiving function (at the expense of the petitionary and therapeutic functions) to socioreligious factors resulting from the centralization of the cult. One of Avalos's most interesting discussions concerns the association of healing with temple dogs. He examines their presence at the Asclepieia in Greece, at the temple of Gula in Isin, and in burials both in Egypt and at Ashqelon, and concludes that the relationship emerged from the view that dogs were "'helper(s)/defender(s)' of humans" (p. 414). Though Avalos's connection certainly is correct, one must question his conclusion, for not only were negative views of dogs prevalent in Mesopotamia and in Israel, but, as</page><page sequence="2">108 BOOK REVIEWS noted by B. J. Collins, there might have been ritual uses for the dog as well, at least in Mesopotamia.' Nevertheless, the connection made by Avalos stands, and though he does not mention it, his observation informs us of a possibly ironic allusion to the association of dogs with healing in 2 Kgs 9:36-37, where we hear how dogs licked up the blood of Jezebel (the etymology of whose name Avalos relates to zbl "disease" [pp. 281-282]). Similarly, we also might look to the Ugaritic epic of Kret, which tells us how king Kret, stricken at the sudden loss of his family and wealth, enters the temple of the chief god, El, sobbing: Like a dog in your house, we pass the time Like a cur, at your entrance. (UT 125:2-3, 16-17) Not only does the text mention a dog in relation to El's temple, but, to use Avalos's terms, Kret here utilizes the primary health care locus for petitionary purposes. Though this work offers many contributions, it also warrants several critical remarks. Foremost is Avalos's frequent use of the Documentary Hypothesis as a stable base on which to build his arguments. By drawing distinctions between biblical texts assigned to the P (Priestly) source and to the D (Deuteronomist), Avalos concludes: "By the time that the laws in P were implemented, the petitionary and therapeutic functions of the temple were, for most practical purposes, eliminated" (p. 379). Whether Avalos is correct here we probably shall never know, for P and D do not exist outside the world of scholarly constructs. To build additional hypotheses upon this questionable construct, in this reviewer's opinion, considerably weakens the thesis. Also notable is Avalos's lack of attention to distinctions in literary genre that affect his arguments. As an example I offer the Mesopotamian tale of the Poor Man of Nippur. This text, which Avalos gleans for meaningful references to the asa2 "medical practitioner," is well known for its satire and humor.2 Yet Avalos states that "the story is consistent with the fact that home 1.

By overlooking the genre of the text, Avalos has missed the humorous point of the as2i's housecall. It is precisely because it was unusual for a doctor from Isin to visit the mayor of Nippur (who, as Avalos admits [p. 177], doubtless had Nippurian medical practitioners at his disposal) that the mayor should have been suspicious of the poor man's ruse. (He was disguised as a doctor in order to get the mayor alone to beat him.) One also wonders why there is almost a complete absence of references to the Ugaritic texts, despite the author's assertion that Israel emerged from a Canaanite matrix (pp. 403-404). I have remarked on the possible literary reference to dogs in El's abode, but doubtless one also could study the petitions of King Kret, El's temple, and the Ugaritic magical incantations from the perspective of medical anthropology. There are also numerous editorial infelicities, including an inconsistent spelling of Bullutsu-rabi, incorrect Hebrew word order (p. 315), unfinished sentences (p. 89), discontinued footnotes (pp. 389-390), and partial duplica- tion of paragraphs (pp. 391-392). Adding the numerous typographical errors would lengthen the list considerably. Finally, and this is intended more for the publisher: the fonts used in this monograph, especially the Hebrew, are nearly illegible and seriously detract from the book's marketability. It is difficult to believe that a better font was not available in today's age of advanced computer technology. These critical comments notwithstanding, Avalos has collected and ana- lyzed numerous and diverse textual sources as well as data from the field of medical anthropology, and in so doing has created an impressive and unique contribution to biblical and Near Eastern studies.
