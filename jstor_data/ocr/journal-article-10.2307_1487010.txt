Stiefel/ Frank Mecklenburg Deutsche Juristen im amerikanischen Exil (1933-1950) The German legal profession suffered more than any other professional group from Nazi persecution. Thousands of Jewish or politically liberal minded lawyers went into teaching liberal arts and social sciences.

Translated on the basis of the manuscripts and provided with a commentary by Marcus van Loopik Translation and explanation of some rabbinical texts.

Swartz Mystical Prayer in Ancient Judaism An Analysis of Ma'aseh Merkavah This book is a formcritical and historical analysis of Ma'aseh Merkavah, and an evaluation of the place of Ma'aseh Merkavah and the forms of religion it reflects in the history of Judaism. It is shown that Ma'aseh Merkavah evolved from a collection of prayers to be recited in community with the heavenly hosts to a prescription for the active cultivation of the individual's ascent to and vision of the upper realm. The study thus explores the relationship of mysticism and magic to prayer in Judaism of Late Antiquity and sheds light on the problem of the function of a prayer in a religious culture. 1991. 210 pages (est.)
