Hanover, N.H.: University Press of New England, 1994. 341 pp. The subject of the response of Italian military and diplomatic officials to the fate of the Jews in southeastern France and Tunisia during World War II has been treated before, most notably by Leon Poliakov and more recently by Susan Zuccotti. Daniel Carpi's study breaks new ground in the thoroughness of its research and in its penetrating analysis. Drawing upon previously unexamined documents in Italian government and military archives and at the Centre de documentation juive contemporaine in Paris, Carpi contends that, in the period from November 1942, when the German occupation of all of France gave Italy control over the southeastern part of the country, to May 1943, when Mussolini was deposed and German troops reoccupied the region, Italian officials were able to prevent arrests and mass deportations of the kind that were occurring elsewhere in France. A similar effort was made in Tunisia, even after it came under the joint authority of Axis forces in November 1942. Carpi argues that the actions of Italian officials to protect Jews had an indirect effect on the Vichy government, strengthening its stand in 1942 and 1943 in the face of the unbending German determination to carry out the Final Solution in France. Thanks to the actions of a group of daring and courageous Italian bureaucrats and military officers, the percentage of Jewish survivors was higher in southeastern France than in France as a whole, while Jews in Tunisia generally escaped the ravages of the Final Solution. Before 1942, Italy appears to have paid little attention to the fate of Jews in France. With the exception of the issue of the property held by Italian Jews, Italian diplomats and military officers seemed little concerned with the wave of anti-Jewish measures enacted and carried out by the Vichy regime in the Southern Zone and by German authorities in the Occupied Zone. To have protested such actions would have been hypocritical, given Italy's proclamation of its own antisemitic laws in 1938. It was the growing realization in the fall of 1941 of the development of a more radical Nazi policy that spurred Italian officials to act on behalf of Italian Jews in France. Fascist Italy now realized that preserving its international position and demonstrating its role as an equal partner with Nazi Germany necessitated upholding the rights of all its citizens abroad. Italian officials were also undoubtedly influenced by reports of gassings and other atrocities committed against Jews who were deported to the East after 1942. As Carpi notes,</page><page sequence="3">138 BOOK REVIEWS there is ample evidence that by the end of 1942, disgust with German policies toward Jews had affected even high-ranking Italian diplomats and had spread among broad segments of the army. It is not surprising, therefore, that by the time Italy gained control over southeastern France, government administrators and army officers in the area had become committed not only to protecting Italian citizens but all Jews under their authority. In the case of Tunisia, the concerns of Fascist Italy were less lofty but the results were similar. Carpi describes how the fate of the Jews in Tunisia became embroiled in a larger struggle-the unceasing effort by Italian officials to prevent the French from gaining an advantage in the competition between the two countries for control of the North African colony. In this context, the Italian Jewish population was seen as an important political and economic force that could bolster Italy's imperialist designs. Without the support of the Jewish community of Tunisia, the delicate numerical balance between Italians and French in the colony, which had already tipped in favor of the latter in the early 1940s, would be utterly destroyed. As a result, the Italian authorities successfully thwarted Vichy efforts to apply its race laws in Tunisia. Even after the Axis occupation in November 1942, German officials proved unable to enforce discriminatory policies against Italian Jews. The result of Italy's efforts to protect its national interests was that Jews holding Italian citizenship in Tunisia enjoyed preferential treatment and were protected from decrees imposed on the rest of the Jewish community throughout the period of Vichy control and German occupation. In his discussion, Carpi places special emphasis on the role of a number of outstanding individuals, including Giuseppe Bastiannini, who replaced Count Ciano as deputy foreign minister in February 1943, and who successfully pleaded the case of the Jews before Mussolini; Police Inspector General Guido Lospinoso, who thwarted German and French efforts to deport Jews from southeastern France by making himself totally unavailable; Father Marie-Benoit, a Capuchin monk based in Marseilles, who organized an extensive network to aid persecuted Jews in southeastern France; and Angelo Donati, a banker residing in Nice, who worked actively to aid his fellow Jews. Unlike other historians, Carpi gives short shrift to Mussolini, however, who he claims lacked both sophistication and humanitarian concern in his negotiations with Germany over the fate of the Jews. By far the most controversial part of the book is the conclusion, in which the author attempts to briefly examine the reasons for the Italian government's defense of Jews. In contrast to those who would argue that</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 139 antisemitism was alien to Fascist ideology, Carpi contends that anti-Jewish sentiment was clearly evident in the radical antibourgeois factions of the early movement. In passing race laws in 1938, Mussolini thus embraced many of the early ideals of many of his most fervent supporters. The desire to defend Jews, Carpi concludes, thus did not arise from the nature of Fascism but rather as a result of opposition to it. In an argument which, unfortunately, he fails to develop adequately in the body of the work, Carpi claims that the army officers and diplomats who helped defend Jews were generally drawn from more conservative elements in the Fascist movement. Thus, Carpi maintains, their unwillingness to cooperate with German security forces in the roundup and deportation of Jews was part of their opposition to the radicalization of the regime as a whole. It is a tantalizing argument that flies in the face of more standard views. One can only hope that the author will develop this thesis in more detail in a future study.
