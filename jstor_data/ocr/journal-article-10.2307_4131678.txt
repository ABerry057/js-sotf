Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2004. 528 pp. In Ascension of Authorship, Jed Wyrick raises and re-raises important and unresolved questions about canonization, authorship, textuality and attri- bution. Not only are these questions essential to any investigation on the formation of Jewish and Christian scriptures, but also they are important for an account of the authority of Tanakh. Even more, these questions must be raised when considering the status and stature of texts that fall outside the canonical corpus. In Ascension ofAuthorship, Wyrick courageously takes on these important questions and does so with a broad chronological sweep (from the biblical materials through Augustine). This is especially bold for a revised dissertation. The range, the number of important texts that Wyrick has gathered in a single volume, and his commitment to engaging the particular texts in their own contexts all make this book an important and lasting contribution to the study of ancient religions. Perhaps the book's most important contribution is also the reason why it has been included in a comparative literature series: It does indeed bring together texts and traditions from different contexts, crossing linguistic, theologi- cal, and generic boundaries. 448</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Wyrick argues two main theses. The first is that Jewish attribution practices focus on the process of textualization, whereas Greek practices focus on the indi- vidual responsible for the composition. The second thesis is that the AuJhebung of these two traditions can be found in Augustine, who first brings together the elements of what we still recognize as the concept of authorship. In fact, Wyrick repeatedly credits Augustine with having created the concept of authorship (380). Like any generalization about Athens or Jerusalem-let alone the differ- ences between them-Wyrick's first thesis risks oversimplification. I will mention only a few examples on the Jewish side. Wyrick says that "Jewish exe- getes insisted that the midrash was the text, after it had been properly filled in" (135). But this is true only of some of the traditions of exegesis. Consideration of pesher and self-conscious rewritings of earlier traditions would have required him to complicate the story. In such cases, there are distinctions of various kinds between text and exegesis. Wyrick also presupposes that the later rabbinic discourse of an unwritten Oral Torah was operative during the Second Temple period. However, there is no such concept in the extant literature from that time but rather recollections of it in much later texts. So, for example, he writes, "It now seems certain that Josephus did not value the Pharisaic traditions of the fathers, the equivalent to the rabbinic torah she b 'al peh, the Oral Torah revealed on Mt. Sinai to Moses and passed down through a channel of prophets and later wise men, for similar reasons" (184-85). Instead of contrasting Josephus and later rabbinic written traditions, Wyrick might have been better off discussing a variety of ways in which the traditions and interpretations can be shown to be authoritative and definitive for a variety of Judaisms in late-Second Temple, post-70 traditions and even later. Another example of Wyrick's telescoping of ancient Judaism into a single static whole is his discussion of 4 Ezra. Wyrick suggests that this is a work whose liberal attitude toward writing "clashes with the rabbinic prohibition on reading outside works" (324). The problem is that 4 Ezra was certainly written prior to any of the extant rabbinic traditions. In addition, rabbinic discussions about "outside works" and about "authorship" more generally and ongoing prophecy cannot be reduced to a single, systematized narrative. To speak of a "clash" between texts written in very different times and contexts is to reduce the diversity and development of late ancient Judaism to a synchronic disagreement. Moreover, Wyrick reduces pseudepigraphy to an authority-conferring strat- egy employed during the Second Temple period (see Chap. 2). But there are much earlier instances of pseudepigraphy within the biblical prophetic traditions, and the practice may be seen not as a way of authorizing one's own views by appropriating the text of another but rather as a way of achieving individuation by emulating and identifying with the founder of a discourse. The genealogy of a concept risks at least two pitfalls. It risks the teleological fallacy of construing earlier developments as leading inexorably to some elected goal, and it risks the genetic fallacy of interpreting later developments as continu- ing expressions of their origins. Wyrick seems to commit both fallacies. He regards the conversation between what James Joyce calls "JewGreek" and 449</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews "GreekJew" as reaching its fulfillment in the Augustinian moment, when the antithesis between Jewish textualism and Greek individualism is aufgehoben, and authorship comes to be both about the individual and the divine. This dichot- omy between Jew and Greek is not substantiated in the ancient Jewish traditions, but even more than that, the narrative in this book is vulnerable to the charge of triumphalism. Why is the concept of authorship crystallized uniquely in Augustine's writings? Wyrick also says that, "the very nature of modem author- ship is, consequently, theologically determined, and is religious through and through. Authorship is stuck with Augustine's Hellenized perspective on the strange and undeterminable relationship between Moses and scripture" (397). Even if Wyrick were right-and what we still call authorship was given its charac- teristic shape by Augustine-how would it follow that modem authorship remains theologically determined? To be sure, the concept of authorship has undergone radical transformations from Augustine to Spinoza or, if you will, from Kierkegaard to Derrida. Sweeping generalizations that claim a single meaning for authorship that is determined by Augustine as "through and through theo- logical" are bound to raise an eyebrow or two. Finally, by focusing exclusively on the telos, that is, Augustine's conception of authorship, Wyrick reduces the entire debate about canon to the matter of attribution. He also claims that these debates were already at work in the late Second Temple period: "In the late Second Temple period, attributions were used to exclude as well as include works into a given group's canon. Because a text's attribution was seen as the most telling indication of its authoritativeness and legitimacy, certain works could be ruled out from the canon on the grounds that they were not written down by an eligible prophet" (110). First, although there are some current scholarly debates about a bipartite or tripartite division of authoritative texts from this period, we do not have any record of pre-70 CE debates about the scriptural canon. Second, it seems that many other factors played significant roles in the eventual inclusion or exclusion of a text. For example, calendrical calculation and sacrificial rituals seem to have been of equal importance for the determination of a text's authenticity and authority among Second Temple communities. What happens to Jewish practices of writing and reading that reimagine authorship in ways that are-to mention just a few-mosaic, pseudonymous, indi- vidualized, effaced, or heavenly? There are fascinating and transformative devel- opments in the concept of authorship that occur prior to and subsequent to Augustine that play no role in Wyrick's book. Wyrick could have claimed less for Augustine, or he could have developed a parallel and developing narrative in the history of Judaism. The absence of that narrative leaves us with an unbalanced volume. Consideration of Iggeret Rav Sherira Gaon would have been very instruc- tive for this book. Not because this geonic epistle can be said to be historically accurate, but because it reflects a growing self-consciousness about matters of attribution, conceptual development, and schools. Perhaps Wyrick might have constructed a parallel narrative to the Augustinian ascension by considering this epistle. 450</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews I conclude by emphasizing the importance of visiting and revisiting the questions that Wyrick raises and of following his lead in taking a comparative approach that is both synchronically and diachronically wide ranging. He is to be commended for a provocative study that is broad, bold, and risk taking. Hindy Najman University of Toronto Toronto, Ontario</page></plain_text>
