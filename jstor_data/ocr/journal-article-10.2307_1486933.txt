<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nancy E. Berg. Exile from Exile: Israeli Writers from Iraq. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1996. 212 pp. The efflorescence of literary and critical work on and by Judeo-Arab Jews in the last decade provides us with a renewed appreciation for the emotional depth and intellectual sophistication of a culture that has often been misrepresented and marginalized in Jewish Studies. Nancy Berg's Exile from Exile: Israeli Writers from Iraq is a contribution to this growing field of knowledge. Its focus is the work of authors who emigrated from Iraq to the State of Israel shortly after its establishment. The book is divided into two parts. The first part considers "The Literature of Exile and Iraqi Jewish Writing," and the second, "Narrative Writings of the Iraqi Jews in Israel." Chapter 1, "Exile, Literature, and Jewish Writers," summarizes major themes in exile literature and theory. The condition of exile, a discontinuous state of being, leads to a crisis of identity. The search for identity and the dual existence of living here and there give rise to exile literature. Chapter 2, "The Jewish Community in Iraq," offers a historical survey of Iraqi Jewry from biblical times to modernity. The author highlights the enormous contribution of the Babylonian Talmud, and the continued halakhic innovations of the geonim throughout the Middle Ages. She notes the religious and social restrictions the Jewish community suffered under medieval Islamic rule, and finally the tribulations and crises brought about by secularization, antisemitism, and anti-Zionism, pressures that led to the mass migration of Iraqi Jewry to the newly founded State of Israel. Chapter 3, "Jewish Writers of Modem Iraqi Fiction," highlights the cultural contribution Jews made to modern Iraqi literature. Jewish writers were among the pioneers of the</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 331 modem Iraqi short story. Notable among them were Anwar Shaul, Yaqub Bilbul, and Shalom Darwish. In Chapter 4, "The Choice of Language," Berg discusses the most serious challenge Iraqi authors had to face upon arriving in Israel. To write in Arabic was to hold on to something familiar in a strange land. The authors who chose Arabic often came from more traditional and insular Jewish families. Because their readership was limited, they moved from being a Jewish minority in Iraq to being an Iraqi minority in Israel. On the other hand, those who turned to Hebrew had to confront several difficulties: it took time to achieve fluency, and it took special skill to translate linguistically and culturally an experience that had taken place in an Arabic context. In chapter 5, "The Experience of Transition: First Novels in Hebrew," Berg discusses Shimon Ballas's, Ha-Ma'abarah (1964), Sami Michael's Equal and More Equal (1974), and Eli Amir's Fowl of Atonement (1984). All three novels are critical of the discriminatory treatment suffered by Mizrahim, or immigrants from Arab and Muslim lands, at the hands of the Ashkenazi establishment. Until recently the Ma'abarah literature was considered marginal not only because it challenged the master narrative of Zionist ideology, but also because it was written in the style of the realistic collective novel typical of an earlier generation. Chapter 6, "Childhood and Home in Iraq: Narratives in Arabic," focuses on Yitzhak Bar-Moshe's A House in Baghdad and Samir Naqqash's The Night of Hoshana Raba. Both works (the first an autobiography, the second a fictional novella) offer a nostalgic depiction of childhood in Baghdad. In both works childhood is depicted as a time of innocence, safety, and rootedness. The metaphor of the home is central in both, suffusing the past with a nostalgic perspective. Chapter 7, "Different Perspectives on Life in Iraq: Narratives in Hebrew," discusses works in Hebrew in which the Jewish past in Iraq is less idealized. Among the authors discussed here are Shalom Darwish, Shimon Ballas, and Sami Michael. These authors describe Iraq as a menacing exile, thereby explaining the necessity of their moving to Israel. In chapter 8, "Conclusion," Berg emphasizes what I consider to be the most important contribution of this volume: "The greatest collective achievement of the Jewish writers from Iraq is the creation of a new literary subgenre that focuses on the experiences and issues at the core of Israeli society" (p. 155). This book is the first work in English to deal with the Iraqi experience in Hebrew literature, and it introduces the English-speaking reader to authors and works little known outside Israel. One wishes that Berg made more of</page><page sequence="3">332 BOOK REVIEWS previous critical work, notably in Hebrew, concerning Mizrahi literature and authors (e.g., Lev Hakak). In addition, there is only a somewhat tenuous link between the theoretical comments on exile literature in the first chapter and the comments on immigrant literature in the concluding one. Otherwise, this book offers an appreciative reading of a long-neglected body of literature, a reinterpretation of a cultural experience, and a reevaluation of an aesthetic tradition. Herein lies much of its value. Esther Fuchs University of Arizona Tucson, Ariz.</page></plain_text>
