Ivii, 578 pp. That the Jewish people has a distinct political tradition should not at all be surprising. Yet, it has been only about thirty years since the process of its recovery has begun. Major political thinkers, including Leo Strauss, Aaron Wildavsky, and especially Daniel Elazar, have made significant contributions to understanding the major impact that Jewish political thought has had on the Western political tradi- tion. With the increasing secularization of political thought since the seventeenth century, there had been a marked reluctance to understand the Bible as a resource for political discussion. However, it has been demonstrated that the consent/con- tract basis of authority is derived directly from federalist theology of the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries in Western Europe. "Federal," after all, is derived from the Latin,foedus, which means covenant.' Protestant churches searching for a basis of polity that was not based on Catholic hierarchical sacramental authori- ty returned to the Hebrew Bible. Their clergy studied Hebrew with rabbinic tutors who most probably emphasized the Jewish mutual concept of covenant over the Christian unilateral covenant theory. We can read late medieval city managers, such as Althusius in Germany, who described the "perfect Jewish polity" as a model for city government.2 Frequent references to biblical sources in Western political thought were not unusual. In- deed, Michael Walzer, one of the editors of the volume under review, has demon- strated in his Exodus and Revolution the political significance of the book of Ex- odus on political revolutionary movements.3 The Jewish Political Tradition: Authority is the first of four volumes on the subject, the others being: Membership, Community, and Politics in History. If the first volume is any indication of the future, we can expect works of great quality. This work lets the tradition speak for itself by presenting primary texts, beginning 1. Daniel J. Elazar, Covenant and Commonwealth (New Brunswick and London, 1996) p. 25. 2. Johannes Althusius, The Politics of Johannes Althusius, translated by Frederick S. Carney (London, 1964). 3.

The texts are presented with sagacious introductions. The book includes several com- mentaries written by contemporary scholars that engage in a dialogue with the text in a most stimulating manner. The commentaries critically address the texts, demonstrating their significance. They are well written and invite the reader to par- ticipate in the dialogue. Yale University Press has done a magnificent job in publishing the book. Its design is sumptuous, the layout welcoming. The volume's look reflects the serious nature of its content. Michael Walzer points out in his introduction that the integrity and unified nature of the Jewish political tradition is based on its "intertextuality" (p. xxii), that is, biblical literature has been regarded as the foundation text. The task of this four-volume series, Walzer writes, is to retrieve appropriate texts from the tradi- tion, integrate them-that is, provide a context for them in the world of political thought in general-and provide criticism in order to be fully engaged in the mes- sages of the tradition. The editors and contributors have succeeded in this ambi- tious task. The work on covenant is excellent in regard to its relation to consent issues. Covenant is probably the unique contribution of the Jewish political tradition to political thought. It would have been helpful, especially since this concept has had such an enduring influence on Western political theory, to include a descriptive analysis of how biblical covenants functioned, the different types of covenants, and the mechanisms therein. This reader would have appreciated a commentary on the Spinoza extract. Spinoza is such a pivotal thinker in so many ways-between the holy and the sec- ular, between the ancient and the modern, between theocentric and anthrocentric concepts of authority and between communal and individual identity. He also lived during a time and in a place where biblical concepts of covenant were widely dis- cussed as a basis of authority for Protestant churches. It would have been inter- esting to read an analysis of Spinoza's thought in the context of the federal theol- ogizing that was the rage in the Netherlands. It was the secularization of federal theology that led to the consent theories of Locke and Hobbes. Unfortunately, the limited space allotted to this review does not allow for any extension of these com- ments. The selection of texts is marvelous. Especially remarkable and generally un- available to the general reader are the medieval texts such as Gerondi and the texts reflecting real issues about the scope and source of authority raging in various Jew- ish communities. Especially telling was the piece by Jacob Sasportas, a commu- nal rabbi competing for authority with lay leadership. In this context it would have been useful to include early on the concept of the three differing, sometimes competing, traditional jurisdictions of authority an- alyzed by Stuart Cohen: liturgical (keter kehunah), adminstrative (keter malkhut) and divine (keter Torah).4 In this vein, another text that should have been included in Chapter Four, on priests, is that of Numbers 8: 9-12, which demonstrates that 4.

This reflects the biblical concept of authorization: divine authorization is never sufficient. The king, too, is not only designated by God but also must be accepted by the people. It would have been important to note a paradox in biblical authority: The tribe of Levi was not allowed to own land. This precept would seem to be a source of a proto-system of checks and balances, that is, the role of this tribe was pow- erful because of its liturgical authority acting as the gatekeepers between the peo- ple and God. At the same time it was totally dependent on the people for suste- nance and the sacrifices that the priest performed. This interdependency would act as a check against aggrandizing power. The prophets, who claimed to represent God, had no institutional support. This seems to be yet another example of checks and balances. God's representa- tive stands alone and must depend on persuasion and the power of his word. The prophet cannot back up his claims with physical force. Finally, one important primary source for understanding authority has not been included in this otherwise comprehensive volume. That source is Jewish litur- gy, which contains not only a model for authority-constituent relationships but an active consent exercise that illustrates the engagement of people in governance. Jewish liturgy continues to be utilized. Liturgy provides a political vision of gov- ernance. The constituency is actually engaged in proclaiming its consent. Hence, its placement in the context of Jewish political tradition needs to be examined. Gordon M. Freeman Walnut Creek, California</page></plain_text>
