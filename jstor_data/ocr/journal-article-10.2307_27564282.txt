Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2004. xi, 311 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S036400940700044X Studies of the Jewish vernacular press during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries have focused largely on Yiddish periodicals in America, czarist Russia, and interwar eastern Europe. In eastern European Jewish historio graphy, the rise of Yiddish culture?particularly the Yiddish press?has been recognized as a symbol of the cultural fluorescence of eastern European Jewish life before the Holocaust. Yet historians of eastern European Jewry have paid 208</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews little attention to the contemporaneous rise of the Ladino press in the Ottoman Empire. Sarah Abravaya Stein's study is a rare attempt to straddle the worlds of eastern European Jewish studies and Ottoman Jewish studies. Requiring linguistic compe tency in several languages, Stein's comparative approach to the study of Jewish history analyzes both the Yiddish and Ladino presses in the Russian and Ottoman empires. She confines her study primarily, though not exclusively, to the first daily Yiddish and Ladino newspapers in the Russian and Ottoman empires: the St. Petersburg-based Der fraynd, which was printed between 1903 and 1913, and the Constantinople-based El tiempo, which circulated between 1872 and 1930. By analyzing both presses in terms of news, opinions, editorials, and advertisements, Stein sheds light on the differences and similarities between the fin de si?cle Russian and Ottoman Jewish cultures. Stein acknowledges the crucial demographic asymmetry between the two communities: Whereas the Russian Empire contained within its borders the largest Jewish community in the world by the end of the nine teenth century, numbering 5.2 million, the contemporaneous Ottoman Jewish commu nity did not exceed 250,000, a figure not much greater than the Jewish population of Warsaw alone (219,000). Yet Stein demonstrates the vibrancy of the Ladino-speaking communities and the modernizing influence of their vernacular press. Stein finds that Der fraynd and El tiempo reflected the contrasting characters of the two communities. The papers differed dramatically in their attitudes toward the Jewish vernacular, acculturation, and Zionism and Jewish nationalism. Ideo logically, Stein points out, Der fraynd was both Zionist in its orientation and unwavering in its promotion of a positive attitude toward the Yiddish language. Yet, as she shows, it was a vaguely defined Zionism, one that also served to satisfy the authorities, who were pleased with the idea of a paper that encouraged Jewish emigration. The Ottoman Empire's first Ladino daily differed significantly from its Yiddish counterpart. El tiempo began circulation during the 1870s, following the spread of constitutional government and Jewish emancipation in Europe up to the borders of the Russian and Ottoman empires. The paper of a much smaller Ottoman Jewish community, El tiempo was a non-Zionist paper that promoted loyalty to the state and displayed a clearly negative attitude toward the Ladino language even though it was the mother tongue of the vast majority of Ottoman Jews. Like the early maskilim in Russia, who expressed contempt for Yiddish but found it a useful tool for disseminating the ideology of the Haska lah, El tiempo viewed Ladino as merely a temporary tool for raising the cultural level of the Jewish masses. By the 1890s, the paper had become a full proponent of Ottomanism?that is, for the preservation of one multireligious and multilin gual country (70). Eventually, by the early twentieth century, the paper assumed a pro-Turkish stand, encouraging its readers to adopt Turkish as the language of instruction in Jewish schools. In a revealing passage, El tiempo editor David Fresco, remarked that he was Jewish in "orientation" but Ottoman in spirit. "I am an Ottoman, genuinely patriotic" (78). Despite the paper's negative attitude toward Ladino, Stein argues that if "Ottoman Jews viewed themselves as 209</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews essentially (even quintessentially) Jewish, the Ladino press, too, came to be viewed by many as inherently Jewish regardless of content" (125). The chapters on advertisements demonstrate the two papers' modernizing influence. Stein reproduces here a fascinating variety of graphic images from pol itical cartoons, product advertisements, and classified ads. She finds that the ads similarly reflected the different orientation of the papers. Whereas, Der fraynd's ads promoted products and goods, a large part of El tiempo's ads were selling services that would facilitate its readers' rise to the middle class, with the French Jewish bourgeoisie as the social model (172-74). Stein also analyzes the Ladino instmctional press, directed primarily at woman, and shows that these Ladino periodicals promoted Westernizing projects, modem dress, and modem education for women. Stein thus finds that "in the Southeastern European context, it was Jewish women rather than men who were responsible for promot ing cultural change" (127). Stein seems to be on more solid ground when she is writing about Ottoman Jewry. Regarding Russian Jewry, some issues can be raised. For example, little distinction is made between "Russian Jewry," a term used to denote the empire's entire Jewish population, and the Polish Jews in the Kingdom of Poland. Given that the Jewish population in the kingdom constituted one-fourth of the total Jewish population in the Russian Empire, a distinction between the Pale and the Kingdom of Poland could have been made more consistently. Thus, we read that many "Russian Jews" also turned to Russian-language period icals, particularly such influential Jewish ones as Voskhod. It could have been noted here that Izraelita, the Polish-language Jewish periodical, was also in circulation at the time (28-29). In other places, Stein refers to the "Yiddish, Russian and Hebrew" orientation of "Russian Jewry," discounting the Jews in the Kingdom of Poland, whose modernizing elite looked to Polish as the path to high culture. One could also take issue with Stein's evaluation of Ottoman Jewry's supposedly unique attitude toward the state. She observes that "while elsewhere in Europe Jews tended to support the dismantling of the imperial structures, the fear of imperial disintegration was unique to Ottoman Jewry (though it was shared, perhaps, by a certain segment of Habsburg Jewry)" (82). Ottoman Jewry was not, in fact, unique, for the vast majority of both Habsburg and Russian Jewry favored the preservation of the state borders even as they called for a social and political transformation of those states. Nonetheless, by adopting a comparative approach to two major Jewish com munities that are rarely studied together?despite their proximity to one another? Stein makes an important contribution to Jewish historiography. Joshua D. Zimmerman Yeshiva University New York, New York 210</page></plain_text>
