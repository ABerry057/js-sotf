<plain_text><page sequence="1">Daniel Sperber. The City in Roman Palestine. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 1998. viii, 200 pp. This book attempts a synthetic overview of select aspects of the city in Roman Palestine--primarily as built environment, but also addressing material on the administration and regulation of such urban institutions as marketplaces, including some aspects of market regulation and administration (chaps. 1-3), taverns and their policing (chap. 4), bathhouses (chap. 5), other public buildings (chap. 6), roads (chap. 7), city walls (chap. 8), and water management (chap. 9). Most of the volume was written by Sperber, and it demonstrates the combination of extensive knowledge of literary material and detailed philological interest that students of rabbinics and of the history of Roman-period Palestine have come to expect from his work. The subject of Sperber's discussions is almost always textual (literary and epigraphic), although occasionally he raises the relationship of the textual material to archaeological remains (e.g., of roads, pp. 103-104 and n. 6). Sperber is at his most useful, particularly for those whose primary frame of reference is rabbinic texts, in bringing Greek, Latin, and rabbinic texts to bear on one another. For example, his discussion of oil in bathing practices links together an allusion to the remains at Pompeii, the first-century Latin writer Celsus, an Oxyrhynchus papyrus fragment of a gospel text, and what appears to have originally been a third- or fourth-century school text from Gaul with rabbinic traditions about the bathhouse (pp. 59-62). 1. London: Routledge, 1997.</page><page sequence="2">108 BOOK REVIEWS Given Sperber's range and his own earlier work on the economy of Palestine, it is unfortunate that he has not attempted to place his elucidation of the nuts and bolts of Palestinian cities, seen through the lens of rabbinic texts, into a social-historical framework. This is a lack that Sperber himself addresses in the introduction (p. 3), but it is no less sorely felt for its having been acknowledged. Some hints of what such a "socioeconomic historical thesis" (p. 3) might contend with are occasionally given. In a footnote Sperber observes that his own reading of rabbinic passages relating to such issues as town organization, planning, and institutions differs from other treatments because he understands them to "reflect the city scene," not that of villages (p. 7, n. 9). This raises important questions about the contexts (geographical, economic, social) of rabbis and their texts and, consequently, urbanization. The conclusion of chapter 4 gestures more explicitly toward the kind of analysis Sperber carried out in two earlier volumes on the economy of Palestine: '[the textual evidence] suggests a mood of tension and urban unrest... which came as a natural consequence of the growing economic and social deterioration of the third and fourth century" (p. 53). Although not without its opponents, such a thesis would be well worth developing, and Sperber is well suited to have done so. Without such a framework, Sperber's contribution, for all its interest, regrettably remains primarily a study of the way certain aspects of the urban environment are referred to in rabbinic texts, and not of the city in Roman Palestine. In addition to Sperber's work, the volume includes contributions from two other authors. "Buildings for Entertainment" by Zeev Weiss (pp. 77-91, 94-102) completes Sperber's discussion in chapter 6 with a review of theaters, hippodromes, and other structures, as well as some of the evidence for their use in Palestine. A lengthy chapter and two appendices by Joshua J. Schwartz on "Archaeology and the City" (pp. 149-194) serve as chapter 10. Schwartz covers archaeological remains corresponding to the buildings and institutions discussed by Sperber (and Weiss), adding in particular a review of harbors, temples, and an appendix on synagogues appendix 2). (To Schwartz's comment on temples at Caesarea one might add the architectural remains and recently excavated foundations of a temple identified with the temple of Roma and Augustus referred to by Josephus; cf. p. 162 and n. 73.) Schwartz appears to have defined the purview of his study so narrowly as to include only materially attested public buildings within city walls, built before Constantine's conquest of the Eastern Roman Empire. This has the result, for</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 109 instance, of excluding "leisure-time activities" pursued in domestic spaces from discussion (p. 164), although these activities might be as much the product of urbanism as public buildings. Aqueducts built to draw water from the countryside into the city are said to be "not really urban institutions" (p. 178). Churches are excluded on chronological grounds (p. 190). Synagogues-probably contemporaneous with "Byzantine" churches-are treated in an appendix as "not really city structures by nature, except perhaps in the more Jewish cities of Tiberias and Sepphoris" (p. 190). The more interesting archaeological and historical question might be the way in which local cultures (what are "Jewish cities"?) shaped the architectural profile of cities and of Roman-period urbanism in Palestine.
