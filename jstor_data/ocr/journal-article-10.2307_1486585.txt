<plain_text><page sequence="1">Scot McKnight. A Light Among the Gentiles: Jewish Missionary Activity in the Second Temple Period. Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1991. x, 205 pp. In this small monograph, Scot McKnight argues that Judaism during the Second Temple period (and later) was not a "missionary religion." Page after page he drives home the message that what has been used as evidence for missionary activity is not usable, not reliable, or of no general significance. He proceeds methodically by seeking answers to a set of questions from the available evidence (Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo, Josephus, rabbinic texts, plus inscriptions, Greco-Roman literature, and finally the New Testament): What can we discern from the sources regarding Jewish attitudes to Gentiles (chap. 1)? What attitudes did the Jews have regarding proselytes and proselytism (chap. 2)? How did Jews convert Gentiles (chap. 3)? What were the requirements expected of a convert (chap. 4)? What are the various levels of adherence to Judaism (chap. 5)? The New Testament evidence is discussed separately, in a sixth and final chapter. The volume concludes with copious notes (pp. 123-159), full indices, and a large bibliography (pp. 160-184), to which one might add the fol- lowing titles: U. Rappaport, Jewish Religious Propaganda and Proselytism in the Period of the Second Commonwealth (Jerusalem, 1965); C. Buss- mann, Themen der paulinischen Missionspredigt auf dem Hintergrund der spiatjiidisch-hellenistischen Missionsliteratur (Bern, 1971); and David Novak, The Image of the Non-Jew in Judaism: An Historical and Constructive Study of the Noahide Laws (Toronto, 1983).</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 301 The main thesis of this work, that there is not as much evidence for active proselytizing by Jews during the Second Temple period as has been supposed, is forcefully argued. There are, however, quite a few difficulties with important details. McKnight presents the reader with an enormous amount of well-indexed source material. Even for that alone, he would deserve the reader's gratitude. Most of the references I checked are accurate (but on p. 13, lines 25-27, Ag. Ap. should be replaced by Ant. three times). However, even though the sources may touch on the questions addressed by McKnight, they frequently do not fully support his statements. For example, he states that "an important element of Jewish views of proselytization is that there will be a massive conversion of Gentiles at the Last Day" (p. 47). He supports this by over a dozen references to Apocrypha, Pseudepigrapha, and Talmud. While all these texts involve Gentiles in a positive relationship to the God of Israel in an eschatological framework, few refer to conversion. In the discussion of relations between Jews and Gentiles, McKnight lists eight aspects of an "integrating tendency" (p. 12). One of these is "friendliness." After a few references to Philo, McKnight concentrates on the evidence relating to Sardis. First he cites three documents contained in Josephus' Antiquities. All of them deal not with friendliness but with the legal status and internal autonomy of the Jewish community of Sardis, safeguarded through Roman guarantees (against a less than friendly local administration?). The remaining evidence pertains to later centuries, but aside from the chronological question, I am not sure how much probative value the remains of the great synagogue have for "friendliness." Other more pertinent evidence could have been cited for-and against-friendly relations between Jews and Gentiles, in Palestine as well as in the diaspora. But sweeping statements such as "the Jews were generally friendly with their neighbors" (p. 14; cf. pp. 26, 116) are not helpful, especially after the correct statement that "it is no longer accurate-nor ever was it-to speak of 'the Jewish attitude toward Gentiles' " (p. 11). Furthermore, whereas McKnight speaks, somewhat oddly, of plural "missionary religions" and implicitly of nonmissionary religions within Christianity (p. 5), he seems to try to establish one identical pattern of openness without missionary efforts for Judaism, in Jerusalem, Galilee, Alexandria, Sardis, Antioch, and most everywhere else, from the late Second Temple period till Constantine. He then is able to dismiss the rather strong evidence for conversionary activity in Rome and the isolationism of Qumran as mere exceptions to the rule.</page><page sequence="3">302 BOOK REVIEWS Generalizations are sometimes necessary, but McKnight is often rather quick in harmonizing disparate data or leaving out evidence contrary to his thesis. For example, he cites Ben Sira 13:15 and 18:13, in each case without the verses immediately following, thereby attributing a one-sidedly universalistic outlook to Ben Sira. Josephus is one of McKnight's main sources throughout and is discussed in some detail (pp. 70-73, 96-97). It surprises, however, that he can state: "The consensus today is that Josephus is essentially reliable but with not uncommon embellishments" (p. 143, n. 99). Nowhere does McKnight address the differences between Josephus' several works, and often the biases of Josephus and of his sources seem to be forgotten. McKnight tries to use rabbinic evidence for the period under discussion with due caution. Some minor mistakes are noticeable, like his quoting a fourth-century tanna, dating Abot de R. Natan later than the Babylonian Talmud, and citing it in an unconventional way (p. 42). More serious is the use of one of the minor noncanonical tractates as evidence for an idea to be found in "the rabbis" (p. 50). Instead, one might have expected discussion of various passages in the Mishnah, Tosefta, and Yerushalmi of Avodah Zarah, and perhaps a passing reference to the extracanonical tractate Gerim. Each book ought to be judged by what it includes, and not by what is excluded. But it strikes this reader as peculiar that among the various means of gaining proselytes marriage receives only half a sentence of attention (p. 68). This is later explained by the assertion that marriage (and other methods, such as economic advantage and force) "are not worthy of consideration in a study on missionary activity" (p. 77). It seems that just as McKnight pays attention to Joseph and Asenath, so marriage as a factor leading to proselytism would need to be addressed. McKnight instead comes to the conclusion that "it is likely that the most effective and probably unconscious method Jews 'used' to attract Gentiles was the compelling force of a good life" (p. 67). He cites several legendary or sententious texts in support, but his argument rests primarily on modern analogies. McKnight seems to overlook the fact that the witness of a religion's members is a necessary prerequisite for rendering a religion attractive, but is not by itself sufficient for explaining the religion's spread. McKnight has effectively challenged the idea of widespread Jewish missionary activity. But the question remains: If there was little or no "missionary" activity (the burden of proof now rests on whoever asserts there</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 303 was), why and how did Judaism spread as widely as it did in the Roman world?
