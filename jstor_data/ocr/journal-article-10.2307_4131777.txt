The religious poetry of Judaism turned a corner with a prolific hymnist from seventh-century Palestine called Eleazar birabbi Kallir (or Killir). Modern studies of medieval Jewish liturgical poetry, or Piyyut, have increased considerably and many manuscripts and fragments have been discovered in several Genizah collec- tions, offering new material on the tradition of classical hymnists from the period of late antiquity and early Islam. Yosse ben Yosse, Yannai, Shimeon bar Megas, Yehudah, Kallir, and Yohanan ha-Kohen are the outstanding names of synagogue poets who composed their hymns for the weekly sabbath and the festivals, pre- dominantly in Palestinian-Jewish communities. Kallir was the greatest poet for having reshaped the tradition of Piyyut it- self. His influence on the classical and post-classical school of Hebrew religious verse was far-reaching. In his numerous compositions (intended exclusively for holidays) he shows that religious awareness needs a new language to be adequate- ly expressed. His linguistic creativity led to innovations that came not only from 115</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews complicated allusions, but also from the use of rare biblical words and the intro- duction of Aramaisms or new expressions with little regard for what is normative in classical and rabbinic Hebrew. Kallir as well as other hymnists created numer- ous forms of the verb through analogical conjugation and formation, often forms of expression taken over from midrashic literature or the spoken language, strength- ening the tendency in contemporary literary Hebrew to mix grammatically accept- able forms with novel kinds of derivation. Kallir succeeded in presenting his poetry as a mediation of religious sense in his time through his personal understanding of piyyutic language and themes; for this he was the object of public admiration and criticism. Saadiah Gaon and Abraham ibn Ezra represent traditional objections to Piyyut that survived until quite recently. Today, Kallir's significance must not be judged from what the an- cient grammarians said of him, because the modern critical establishment of new texts gives a different idea of his art. Moreover, later Piyyut traditions in Italy and Ashkenaz echo many features of Kallir's poetry, demanding a reassessment of Kallir's lasting contribution to the qualities of piyyutic language and style. Among the new hymns that emerged from the Genizah were his qedushtot for Shavuot, the nine-part hymns which end with a recitation of Is. 6:3 and are de- signed to adorn the benedictions of the 'amidah during the morning service on the festival. On Shavuot, the anniversary of the giving of the Torah, the composers of liturgical poetry were specifically attracted to a versification of the numerous ag- gadoth about the Sinai event and the Ten Commandments. Kallir is credited par- ticularly with having made extraordinary embellishments for the required Torah reading for Shavuot. Some of the hymns have remained part of the Shavuot litur- gy to this day, but Shulamith Elizur has re-edited these texts on the basis of Ge- nizah manuscripts together with a number of unknown fragments. Elizur is at her best when she traces the qedushta parts through Genizah materials and recon- structs the best textual witnesses. Her detailed commentaries are impressive and her analysis of poetic structures is most accurate. However, her discussion of the ideas and concepts prevailing in Kallir's hymns is often too narrow. Kallir's qedushtot are essentially poetic commentaries, introducing a wealth of talmudic-midrashic traditions in connection with the holiday theme. He did not, however, draw his inspiration only from the subjects of the Bible or Midrash; he also used popular legends and developed their themes, thus breaking new ground. Kallir enlarged the biblical and aggadic images, for instance, by presenting a de- scription of world history up to the Sinai event including a personified Torah who refused to be offered to Adam, Noah, or the Patriarchs. The earliest association of the Torah with a (female) personality occurs in Proverbs, but Kallir elaborates this motif and designates the Torah to be a daughter of God who was proposed to many grooms until she chose to be married to Moses. Such an embellishment, giving the Sinai story its epic character, is preserved in Piyyut but not in rabbinic sources. Elizur discusses this specific aspect of Kallir's narrative range extensively, but related features of his religious temper and lyrical power are underappreciat- ed. Kellir's hymns communicate with strong involvement a sense of intensity in a language and through metaphors that extend beyond the standard rhetoric of the synagogue poets. He created for himself a highly particular and yet not eccentric 116</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews idiom for rendering the spiritual-ecstatic meaning of Shavuot while accepting the practical significance of the commandments of the Torah for Jewish existence. It is necessary to stress the value of Kallir's liturgical poetry in order to place his oeu- vre in its proper temporal and spatial setting in seventh-century Palestine. Elizur's book will prove to be an indispensable aid for reaching more definite conclusions about Kallir's hymnography.
