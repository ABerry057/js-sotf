Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1989. x, 319 pp. Gudrun Krimer's study on the Jews of Egypt is divided into five sec- tions: Communal Structure and Composition; Communal Organization; Socioeconomic and Political Change (1914-1918); Jewish Reactions to Poli- tical Change: Egyptian Patriotism, Communism, and Zionism; and The Beginning of the End: Egyptianization, the Arab-Israeli War, and the Burn- ing of Cairo. Kramer explores the reasons for the swift rise and decline of this minor- ity community in a Muslim land. Beginning with an examination of the communal structure and composition of Egypt's Jewry, she illuminates its diversity in religious rite, ethnic origin, language, and nationality. In so doing, Krimer paints an extensive and vivid picture of the Jewish commun- AJS Review 16 (1991): 199-2 10 199</page><page sequence="2">200 MICHAEL M. LASKIER ity's heyday in the 1920s and 1930s when Jewish merchant families con- trolled commercial empires linking Egypt's economy to Europe. Although tolerated and even respected, the Jews were only marginally integrated into the dominant Sunni Muslim culture of Egypt. And when, in the late 1930s, but particularly after the end of the Second World War, the conflict over Palestine unleashed latent tensions and new political strife, their status was seriously challenged. Oral interviews and extensive archival sources in Egypt, Israel, and Europe enabled Kraimer to record in great detail the Jewish community's struggle for survival during these turbulent years as anti-Zionism, Egyptian- ization, and Islamic resurgence gradually combined to erode the commu- nity's fragile position in Egyptian society. What Krimer's findings indicate, as do other recent studies, such as Shimon Shamir's The Jews of Egypt: A Mediterranean Society in Modern Times (London: Westview Press, 1987) and my forthcoming The Jews of Egypt: In the Midst of Zionism, Anti-Semitism and the Middle East Conflict, 1920-1970 (to be published by New York University Press), is that the Jewish minority of Egypt, like the Christian minorities (Copts, Armenians, and Greeks), played a vital role in the economic, educational, and cultural modernization of their country. I find that the Jews of Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, and Egypt had several features in common, and that is one of the purposes for this review essay. First, all of these countries came under colonial influence during the course of the nineteenth century and the early part of the twentieth century. Egypt was occupied by Britain in 1882, while Morocco and Tunisia became French protectorates (Morocco in 1912 and Tunisia in 1881); Algeria was occupied by France in 1830. Second, unlike the Muslim majority, the Jews (and Christians) in these countries welcomed with considerable enthusiasm French and British colo- nial penetration. With the assistance of French Jewry and its major overseas network of schools, known as the Alliance Israelite Universelle,' and by fre- quenting European consular-sponsored educational institutions, the Jews of 1.

In Algeria they frequented the public schools created by the French, and, in fact, many drifted away from Jewish religious traditions as a result of "over-acculturation." Although the acculturation process in Algeria was more rapid than in Tunisia and Morocco, by the 1940s Jewish populations in the major urban agglomerations of Sfax, Tunis, and Sousse (Tunisia), and of Casablanca, Tangier, Marrakesh, Fez, Rabat, and Meknes (Morocco) had become increasingly francophone. The traditional languages of Judeo-Arabic and Judeo-Spanish receded in favor of European culture. Only in the rural countryside of Morocco's Atlas Mountains, as well as in southern parts of Tunisia and Algeria, did the Jews remain largely tradition-bound. In Egypt, as compared with North Africa, the Jews of the middle and upper classes adopted one of the leading European languages. As Kraimer notes (p. 28), in the late nineteenth century this was mainly Italian, which until 1905 served as the chief language of instruction in the community schools of Alexandria. By that time, however, French had become the lingua franca of the local foreign minorities and the Turko-Egyptian elite alike. The Jewish communi- ties held their meetings in French, and until the 1930s, French was also the main language of instruction in the community schools, as well as in the schools of the Alliance Israelite Universelle at Cairo and Alexandria. An important westernized elite of Jewish journalists, secularly oriented teachers, large-scale merchants, and administrators of foreign firms emerged in these countries from the modern schools under European spon- sorship. The pioneers of the modern press in Morocco and Egypt were Jews and other foreign or ethno-religious minorities. The teachers of the Alliance Israelite Universelle schools, trained in Paris, came from these Mediter- ranean basin communities. As part of the modernized elite, they also contri- buted to the intellectual regeneration of segments of the Jewish populations situated in the urban centers. It is true that many Jews were still unaffected by the changes and poverty was still rampant among various strata of Jewish society. Nevertheless, in the communities of Egypt and Algeria in particular, the Jews of the urban milieu benefited in significant numbers from the material advantages of European colonial expansionism. Third, as a small minority subordinate to Islamic rule-Ottoman influence in Egypt, Algeria, and Tunisia; Sherifian authority in Morocco- the Jews (and similarly their Christian compatriots) envisaged in European colonialism an opportunity to become politically and socially emancipated a</page><page sequence="4">202 MICHAEL M. LASKIER l'Europdenne like their coreligionists in France and other parts of Europe. With the European colonial presence a reality in these countries beginning with Algeria in the 1830s, the Jews and the Christians of the Mediterranean basin became the indispensable intermediaries between the Muslims and the Europeans: a positive pro-European element-from the colonial stand- point-for the promotion of new ideas and economic enterprises among the indigenous populations. In Egypt as in other parts of the Middle East and North Africa, the Jews sought, and quite frequently obtained, foreign consular protection and citi- zenship from the representatives of the European powers. In Egypt and parts of the Ottoman Empire, the Jews could avail themselves of the so- called "regime of capitulations" then practiced. This system allowed foreign nationals as well as persons protected by the European powers to enjoy special privileges and guarantees. The Muslim authorities were forbidden to harm them, arrest them, conscript them into the army, or confiscate their property without the prior permission of their European country's local consular representatives. Whereas not everyone could obtain such benefits, the regime of capitulations gradually granted protection to important seg- ments of Egypt's Jewish communities. Fourth, another feature common to these communities included the population concentrations. Mediterranean basin Jewry were becoming urbanites. Yet whereas in Egypt they had been settled in urban areas such as Cairo, Alexandria, Port Said, and Tanta for many centuries, the making of urban Jewry in French North Africa was largely attributed to internal migrations from the rural countryside and the Sahara desert since the nine- teenth century. For example, the emergence of important Moroccan urban Jewish centers like Casablanca, Marrakesh, Agadir, and Tangier is a result of Jewish migration there from the Atlas Mountains in significant numbers, beginning in the 1860s.2 Finally, similar to their counterparts in Egypt, the Jews of North Africa were divided into several groups of people, causing communal turmoil as well as encouraging cultural diversity. In Morocco cultural diversity and 2. On Jewish life in these communities, see especially Norman A.

In Tunisia this was the case between the ancient community, the Touansa, and the newly arrived Jewish immigrants (starting in the late seventeenth century) from Livorno. The conflict between the Touansa and the Livornese, especially in the city of Tunis, led to a form of communal duality that threat- ened to destroy Jewish life. The two forces struggled over financial alloca- tions, rituals, burial grounds, and political representation.3 Although in Egypt communal tensions did not reach the boiling point, it should be noted that Jewish population heterogeneity was indeed evident. In addition to the small ancient communities and the Karaites, the arrival of Oriental and Sephardic Jews from parts of the Ottoman Empire and the Balkans, and the absorption of East European Ashkenazim-a process which occurred during the nineteenth century-caused considerable up- heavals in Egyptian Jewish communal life. The Jews of Egypt, whose communities had existed almost continuously for two millennia and had expanded after the Ottoman conquest in 1516, became prominent in public and private finances. Under Ottoman rule and during the reign of the Muhammad Ali dynasty, they emerged as merchants, moneylenders, moneychangers, and dealers in jewels and diamonds. They held the customs revenues in the cities and seaports as tax-farmers (midl- tezims), and are also mentioned as traders in coffee, which evidently replaced spices as the major item in Egypt's international trade. The Ottomans, it seems, were guided in Egypt by realistic considera- tions, and exploited Jewish financial, commercial, and linguistic skills absent among the Muslims. This was also the case in other regions of the Muslim world, including pre-1830 Algeria, where the Duran, Bacri, and Bushnag Jewish mercantile families collaborated with the Turkish deys (governors); the Husaynid beys in Tunisia collaborated with the newly arrived Livornese Jews-many of whom were experienced merchants who 3.

LASKIER conducted brisk international trade in the name of the local rulers. Similar- ly, in Sherifian Morocco, Jewish merchants, known as the tujjdr al-sultdn, engaged in large-scale commerce on behalf of their sultans.4 Unlike Morocco and parts of the Middle East and North Africa, where, despite European colonial penetration, Jews and other non-Muslim minori- ties were exposed to restrictions by their Muslim rulers; or, in the case of Algeria, irrespective of its conquest by the French in 1830, where Jews were subject to anti-Semitic tendencies on the part of the European settlers (even though they became French citizens after 1870), Egypt, with its stability and trade opportunities since the 1880s, offered Jews in distress multiple oppor- tunities. According to Kramer (pp. 9-10): If the Jewish immigrants were attracted to Egypt by the same pull factors as the others, they had frequently been exposed to particularly strong push fac- tors in their countries of origin. To the economic crisis in parts of the Ottoman Empire and Eastern Europe and political instability or actual war in the Medi- terranean area, which affected all groups of the local population, were added incidents of persecution on religious or racial grounds in parts of Eastern Europe or outright expulsion, as in the case of Palestine during World War I. Kraimer also points out that while Jews of diverse origins and linguistic background (Arabic, Italian, French, Yiddish, Polish, Russian, and Greek) settled in different residential districts and quarters in Cairo and its en- virons-the humble socioeconomic group of "Rabbinate Jews" in the Hirat al-Yahid (Jewish quarter); the Ashkenazim in the Darb al-Baribira area; the Karaites in the quarter known as 'Atfat al-Yahid al-Qard'in, bordering on the Hirat al-Yahfd; and well-to-do middle and upper middle classes in Garden City, Zamilik, Giza, and 'Abbisiya-in Alexandria as well as in the provincial towns these divisions were not so acute. Moreover, whereas in Alexandria all the diverse Jewish groups were integrated into one single communal structure, in Cairo the existence of three communal entities (Sephardi/Oriental, Karaite, Ashkenazi), in which only the Sephardi/ Oriental entity was recognized by the authorities as the official representa- tive of all Jewish groups, rendered Jewish life in that city more complex (p. 20). 4. On this subject, see Michael Abitbol, Timoins et acteurs: les Corcos et l'histoire du Maroc contemporain (Jerusalem: Ben-Zvi Institute, 1977); and Schroeter, Merchants of Essaouira.</page><page sequence="7">JEWS IN MODERN EGYPT 205 While in Cairo and its environs the more affluent and socially mobile Jews left the traditional neighborhoods for the suburbs and exclusive sec- tions of the city, Heliopolis, Giza, Zamalik, and 'Abbasiya, the lower middle classes were situated in 'Abidin, Bdb al-Liiq, and Dahir. A similar phenomenon was evident during this period in French North Africa as a result of social mobility among the Jews. The more affluent deserted the Jewish quarters (mellabs) for the European-built villes nouvelles of Casa- blanca, Fez, Rabat, and Meknes.5 Politically, just as unfavorable trends affected the Jews of Europe and North Africa during the 1930s and 1940s, certain developments in Egyptian society hurt the Jews there. Until Egypt became independent in 1922, under the British occupation (1882-1914) and protectorate (1914-1922), there were few obstacles in the way of minorities to obtain foreign citizenship and to benefit from European protection within the context of the capitulations. Between 1914 and the 1920s approximately 25 percent of the Jews in Egypt held foreign nationality or protection. Over 40 percent were stateless, and the rest were Egyptian subjects. Until 1936, when the capitulations were finally abolished, most Jews did not bother to obtain Egyptian nationality. Those who did opt for it during the 1930s and 1940s encountered innumera- ble obstacles in connection with the Nationality Law of 1929. Secondly, owing to the rising tide of Egyptian nationalism in the 1930s, Pan-Arab and Pan-Islamic ideas emerged. The conflict in Palestine between the Arabs and the Yishuv, culminating in the 1936-39 Arab Revolt, exposed the Jews of Egypt and North Africa to hazardous challenges. However, alongside these developments, since the beginning of the twen- tieth century, the Jews were also exposed to other ideas and movements associated with Communism, Socialism, and Zionism. Regarding Zionism, as was the case with most Jewish communities of the Islamic Diaspora, Zionist activity had been confined to fundraising on behalf of the Jewish National Fund and the Jewish Foundation Fund. Following the Balfour Declaration, Zionist federations were created in Cairo and Alexandria as an initiative of Ashkenazi immigrants as well as several local Sephardim. Still, as in the Maghribi Jewish communities, most of the educated and influential Jews during the interwar period were indifferent to Zionism as a political and national movement. 5.

LASKIER As was the case with Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Syria, and Iraq during the late 1930s and especially the 1940s, Zionist activity in Egypt increased with the assistance of emissaries (shelih.im) from Palestine. The latter repre- sented the Zionist institutions of the Yishuv, which included the Haganah, the Jewish Agency for Palestine, and the Mossad Le'Aliyah Bet, the appara- tus responsible for illegal immigration to Palestine from diverse parts of the Diaspora ever since the British published the White Paper of 1939. From that point on, particularly in the wake of the Holocaust, Zionist activity in Egypt-as in the rest of the Muslim Diaspora-was more aliyah-oriented, making the transition from fundraising/philanthropic Zionism to active Zionism (rvo'vto mrnn). As in Casablanca and Tunis, Hebrew cultural clubs and Zionist youth movements became active in Cairo, Alexandria, and Port Said, movements such as Ha-Shomer ha-Tsa'ir, He-Ijalutz, and Bnai 'Aqiva. These began to play a prominent role in the lives of urban Jewish youths. Based on my findings, I am hesitant to argue, as Krfimer apparently does, that Zionism in Egypt failed to achieve important objectives because it was confined to a small elite of activists. To begin with, it is probably true that despite its dynamism, the pro-Zionist press did not reach most people in the Jewish communities of Egypt and the Fertile Crescent (Syria, Leba- non, and Iraq); and the numbers of active and dedicated Zionists, especially during the interwar years, was limited at best. Yet the same could apply for most communities of the Diaspora. Active Zionism everywhere-with the sole exception of several Eastern European communities-was largely con- fined to a tiny elite of organizers, institutions, and movements. As long as the Jews of the Diaspora felt financially and politically secure, they did not search for the Zionist option or consider aliyah. Besides, many Zionist emis- saries from the pre-1939 period arrived in Egypt and North Africa from Palestine and Europe with the preconceived notion that very little could be done to awaken the Jews to become Zionists, and they simply came for the purpose of collecting funds on behalf of the Jewish National Fund/Jewish Foundation Fund. Before the late 1930s or early 1940s, these emissaries made no serious inroads in the effort to transform local Zionism into an aliyah-oriented movement. Did the state of Zionism in Egypt undergo an extensive transformation in subsequent years? Beginning in 1942-43, once Zionism gained momen- tum, both as a local initiative and with the assistance of trained emissaries from Palestine, its contributions to the Yishuv and, after 1948, to the State</page><page sequence="9">JEWS IN MODERN EGYPT 207 of Israel not only matched the efforts of other communities in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa, but often surpassed them. The activists in Egypt learned to organize underground movements, they served as in- dispensable auxiliaries to the emissaries, and they helped them to register more than 14,000 Jews for aliyah in 1949-50. By undertaking such missions, they risked their lives for Israel. All of these functions were implemented at a time when Egypt and Israel were either at war or on the verge of a military conflict. Indeed, in other communities, too, Zionist achievements in favor of Israel's best interests were accomplished by small elites of Zionist activists. Taking French Jewry as another example, it is widely known that, despite the contribution of this community to elevate the status of their coreligion- ists in the Mediterranean basin communities through the work of the Alliance Israel1ite Universelle, it was a culturally assimilated community. Yet it was due to the initiatives of a small Zionist elite in France that in 1948-49 fruitful negotiations on Israel's behalf took place with the French govern- ment. These negotiations led to the opening of the aliyah gates from French Morocco. Until 1948, aliyah efforts had been suppressed by the French protectorate authorities. The revised policy enabled the emissaries of the Jewish Agency and the Mossad Le'Aliyah to organize the emigration of more than 80,000 Moroccan Jews between 1949 and 1956. Did the Palestine question before 1948 and the Middle East wars of 1948, 1956, and 1967 constitute the only reason for the decline and eventual disintegration of the communities in Egypt? Were there other factors at work in connection to, or separate from, these events? Krimer addresses these issues superficially (p. 235), partly because her analysis does not extend beyond 1952. There is no doubt that the Palestine question and the Middle East conflicts had an adverse impact on the Jews. During the Nasser era (1954-1970), the authorities implemented draconian measures against the Jews at home which were directly related to the regional conflict, thus compelling many of them to leave. The military defeats of the Arabs after 1948, the return from the battlefield of the frustrated Egyptian soldiery, and political restlessness among the officer corps, whose members searched for scapegoats, placed the Jews at the center of attention. Nasser, like his pred- ecessors (albeit more vigorously), vented his anger at the Jews by resorting to internments, expulsions, and sequestrations of property. Moreover, whereas the anti-Semitism during the 1930s and 1940s was largely confined, according to Kraimer, to ultra-nationalists as well as fundamentalist move-</page><page sequence="10">208 MICHAEL M. LASKIER ments, in the post-1948 period, mainly under Nasser, it gained considerable momentum in high government circles. On the other hand, though the Middle East conflict surely hastened the dissolution of the Jewish communities, which otherwise would have sur- vived in Egypt longer and in more substantial numbers, the conclusion I arrive at is that there were other factors involved, often indirectly connected to these events, or not connected to them at all. The Jewish communal dis- solution process, it seems, would have taken place in any event even if Israel did not exist. Why? Domestically, in addition to suppressing the opposition among Egyptian Muslims, Nasser and the ancien regime in its final phase also directed their hostility at the small minorities in order to limit their influence, as part and parcel of the anti-Western and xenophobic campaign. The 1947 "Company Law," which limited Jewish representation in major companies in favor of "true" Egyptians, is one case in point (as Krfmer notes). Nasser's nationalization policies of 1961-64, affecting affluent Muslims, Jews, and Christians, are another, leading to the departure of numerous "capitalists" from Egypt and resulting in a growing lack of con- fidence in the Egyptian economy by other strata of the population-essen- tially among Christians and Jews. In fact, economically, the Greeks were in much the same situation as the Jews, even though Greece was not at war with Egypt. As Amikam Nachmani observes, already in 1951 the Egyptian government began whittling away at the privileges of the Greek community (then 140,000 strong), holding talks with its representatives aimed at regu- lating their status. The Egyptians sought to confine Greek economic activity and increase official involvement in minority affairs. They insisted on the right to deport any Greek whose occupation or activities were incompatible with state security. Interestingly, concern for the Greek minority in Egypt served as one of Greece's official pretexts for preserving a low profile in rela- tions with Israel. According to Nachmani: Israel concluded that improvement of [Graeco-Israeli relations] was possible in one of two eventualities: Graeco-Egyptian agreement over the status of the Greek minority, or, alternatively, deterioration in its status. This would presu- mably lead the Athens government to realize that its anti-Israeli policies provided no guarantees for the safety of the Greeks in Egypt. In time, Nasser fulfilled Israeli expectations: after the Suez campaign [of 1956], he enacted stringent laws against foreigners which had a particularly crippling impact on the Greeks. By the mid-1960s, the numbers of Greeks in Egypt had dwindled</page><page sequence="11">JEWS IN MODERN EGYPT 209 to about 30,000. "The second catastrophe" and the "second Smyrna" were the terms the Greek press applied to the anti-Greek persecutions in Asia Minor during the 1920s.6 In other words: sooner or later, due to domestic problems, Egyptianization, and the surge of the nationalist and fundamentalist tides, the Jews, like the other minorities-portrayed as collaborators with European imperialism- would have been forced to resort to communal self-liquidation. To what extent was anti-Semitism, not merely anti-Zionism, a factor in Egypt? Anti-Semitism in the Nasser era during the 1950s and 1960s, and similar trends among "Young Egypt" and the Muslim Brotherhood fun- damentalists in previous years (described by Kraimer), became a source of concern in the communities. Perhaps the fact that Nasser's regime had ties with ex-Nazis in the 1950s and early 1960s did not necessarily mean it was virulently anti-Semitic, as claimed by international Jewish organizations. However, the dissemination in Egypt of Mein Kampfin Arabic and Nasser's statements about the excessive worldwide influence of Jewish capitalism were indicative of the regime's anti-Jewish sentiments. Notwithstanding, it is important to distinguish between the attitude of the regime and of ordi- nary Egyptians. Neither the pro-German propaganda of the 1930s and 1940s, prevalent in Egypt as well as in other Middle Eastern/North African societies, nor the anti-Jewish policies of the post-1955 period aroused ordinary Egyptians against the Jews the way such manifestations had managed to achieve in Europe. When describing internment and other restrictions imposed on the Jews in 1948 during the first Egyptian-Israeli confrontation, Krimer argues that "compared to what would take place in Egypt during and after the wars of 1956 and 1967, suffering was still relatively mild in 1948. The community emerged from the first Arab-Israeli war without heavy losses in human life and property" (p. 215). This is only partly true, for one could argue that in 1956 and 1967, at least, terrorism on a large scale was not directed by extremists against Jews, as was very much evidenced in June, July, and Sep- tember 1948. Yet she is quite right in concluding that what occurred in 1948 6.

LASKIER was not so terrible, given the emotions involved in the war. It could have been worse. One other point comes to mind in connection with Krimer's analysis on this point: Egypt's policies toward the Jews during the Middle East con- flicts-internments, sequestrations, expulsions, and surveillance-albeit harsh, were not unusual and did not set a precedent for cruelty. As unfor- tunate as these policies were, harassment of various types has been conduct- ed by other nations in the region and elsewhere in time of war. The United States, which, unlike Egypt, is a nation whose political foundations are deeply rooted in liberal democratic traditions, interned Japanese-Americans during World War II, the innocent victims of the American-Japanese crisis of 1941. KrSamer's book is of high quality, but I find fault in the fact that the treatment stops in 1952, the eve of the Egyptian Revolution. She should have stopped in 1948-49, on the eve of the Egyptian-Israeli armistice agree- ment. Her sources on the events immediately preceding the revolution are limited, and consequently the contribution to the reader's understanding of the 1948-52 period is rather minor. In sum, Kraimer has written an excellent account of the Jews of Egypt since World War I. It is the most comprehensive study ever written on this fascinating and complex Mediterranean basin community. On the other hand, one of the reasons why I raise the comparative-analysis aspect is because this approach was not undertaken by Kraimer in her study. In com- paring and contrasting socioeconomic and political issues in Egypt with North Africa and the Middle East, I hope to have given the reader a broader perspective for understanding the place the Jews had in Muslim societies in general. Many topics-such as Zionism (which could have been analyzed more extensively given the sources that were available to Kraimer), Euro- pean anti-Semitic propaganda in Egypt during the 1930s, Egyptian Jewry's solidarity with Jews living under the influence of the Third Reich after 1933, the position of Egyptian Jews during World War II, and the role of the Yishuv on their behalf-could be analyzed in relevance to similar develop- ments in Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria, as well as Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq. Future research should build on Kraimer's foundation in these direc- tions. Spertus College of Judaica Chicago, Ill.</page></plain_text>
