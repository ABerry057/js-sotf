<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael Stanislawski. Autobiographical Jews: Essays in Jewish Self-Fashioning. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2004. 209 pp. Michael Stanislawski's description of Flavius Josephus's autobiography captures the principal thesis of this elegant reflection on the use of autobiography as a historical source: "I see the Vita not as an 'autobiography of a very special kind' but precisely the opposite: as an exemplar of a genre (or series of connected genres) in which an author's life-story is crafted by a highly partial, both conscious and unconscious, selection of which episodes of his or her life to retell, refracted through an ever-changing sense of selfhood" (23). Not one of the seven samples ranks highly in terms of historical accuracy or absence of bias. But as the subtitle conveys, the real value of these autobiographies lies in their ability to reflect the self-fashioning of a literary identity, the tensions of the times (in Josephus's case, the loyal Jew and the virtuous Roman), and the individual's quest for defi- nition in relation to the larger society. Stanislawski analyzes Josephus's Vita, Asher of Reichshofen's Sefer zikhronot, Glickl's Zikhroynes, Moshe Leib Lilienblum's Hat'ot ne'urim, Osip Mandelstam's Shum vremeni, Stefan Zweig's Die Welt von Gestern, and Sarah Kofman's Rue Ordener, Rue Labat. Stanislawski, in all cases and tongues, is thoroughly in command of all the material he analyzes. If the overall balance is titled in the direction of the modem era, that is only appropriate given the relative paucity of premodern examples (see the discussion on page 33) and the author's own area of expertise. Stanislawski is a historian's historian in his discriminating use of other fields, such as literary criticism and cognitive neuroscience, which he ultimately subordinates to the task of assessing historiographical issues, and finally, in his defense of the historian's enterprise against a postmodernist and rela- tivistic treatment of truth. Specifically, Stanislawski remains convinced that these autobiographies yield valuable historical insights even if they can no longer be read "as veridical depictions of their author's lives and times" (175). All of these lectures succeed marvelously as discrete essays. The hypothesis that Glickl wrote her celebrated memoir mainly after the death of her second, not 193</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews first husband is argued with gusto. (I found Stanislawski's treatment of Marvin Lowenthal's translation somewhat mean-spirited-for all its defects, this book has been an invaluable entr6e to students of Jewish history, and better English translations are not readily available). Glickl and Asher of Reichshofen constitute the first pairing of three parallel lives. As one would expect from the author of For Whom Do I Toil? Judah Leib Gordon and the Crisis ofRussian Jewry, the chapter comparing Moshe Leib Lilienblum and Osip Mandelstam is a gem. The former, a hero to maskilim and Jewish nationalists, and the latter, a Russian poet and apos- tate, both started their autobiographies early and doubled back to create very different finished products. Equally wonderful is the chapter on Stefan Zweig, which delicately explains his non-Zionist brand of Jewishness (127-28), as well as his suppression of sexuality and his thirty-year marriage to Friderika Zweig. Like Zweig, Sarah Kofman ended her own life. In her case, the Nazi's pursuit was secondhand: Her rabbi father had been deported and murdered fifty years before her death. Stanislawski's "parallel lives" reminded me of Plutarch- perhaps the first Western author to recognize in biography a means of teaching something universal-much more than "what Alcibiades did and suffered." This book is another stellar product of the Stroum Lectures. As such, it is well-organized into four main chapters, thoroughly readable and to the point. Outside this format, however, one could imagine a more substantial book. Is there a difference between privately written memoirs and autobiographies clearly meant for a wide readership? In other words, how different are the autobio- graphies of Zweig and Lilienblum, who knew their stories would reach a wide audience, from those who did not? How did the process of publication affect the final product? In only one fascinating case, Asher of Reichshofen (36-37), do we learn the details. The author writes, "I have read, at times at the madly obsessive rate of one per day, several hundred autobiographies and memoirs" (9). But rarely in this study does Stanislawski elucidate how the generalizations formed here also apply to those volumes. Although Stanislawski is attentive to gender issues, a fact reflected in his chapters on Glickl and Kofman, only taking in those other examples would have enabled some generalizations on this point. Though the author is a master of conveying context, much more could have been said about the autobiographies of non-Jews during the same period. When the author cites a study by Marcus Moseley proving the influence of Rous- seau on Solomon Maimon's Lebensgeschichte (56), one wants Stanislawski to say more-about the study, about Maimon, and about Rousseau. If the sharpest criti- cism one can raise about a book is that it could have been longer, that is high praise indeed. Anyone interested in autobiography, identity formation, the relationship between memory and history, or the methodology of teaching primary texts will benefit greatly from reading this volume.
