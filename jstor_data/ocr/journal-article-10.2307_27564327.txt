Lupovitch If Moses ben Amram and Moses ben Maim?n... would climb out of their graves and contemplate modern Judaism, they would recognize neither the narrow straits of Orthodoxy nor the Mosaism of the reformers. They would say: "As you reformers search for spirit, you lose the core of religion, for the kernel needs the husk; [The Orthodox] preserve only the husk, but leave the kernel..." Whoever does not learn from Israel's rich history, whoever does not distinguish between the eternal, immutable obligations, and the lesser aspects that are dependant on time and place?condemns Judaism to stagnation, to death. Too much form conceals the kernel...the Torah is falsified through formalism, whether by the Orthodox or radicals. How, then shall we find the pure and true Judaism? Only by the happy recon ciliation of both aspects.l With these words, Alexander Kohut engaged the radical Reform stance of Kaufman Kohler in the spring of 1885. The exchange with K?hler crystallized Kohut's raison d'?tre for Conservative Judaism: an authentic alternative to what he termed "stupid Orthodoxy and insane Reform."2 Kohut articulated a fully devel oped version of this view in Ethics of the Fathers, a compilation of his polemics against K?hler that he published a few months later. This earned Kohut a place among the Conservative movement's pantheon of nineteenth-century founders, along with Sabato Mor?is, Benjamin Szold, and Marcus Jastrow. Though directed specifically at Kaufman K?hler and other radical refor mers, this polemic points to a tension between Kohut's ideological aims and the I express my gratitude to Deborah Dash Moore and Harvey Meirovich for their comments and criticisms. 1.

Lupovitch challenges he faced as a communal and congregational rabbi, both in Hungary and in America. As an ideologue, Kohut defined authentic Judaism as a multifaceted blend of beliefs, practices, and loyalties, and he defended the authority and mut ability of Jewish law and custom as equally indispensable components of Judaism. In other words, Kohut did not merely stake out a median alternative between Orthodoxy's unyielding commitment to religious observance and Reform's puta tive hypersensitivity to the rhythms of the outside world; he advocated an inclus ive Judaism that incorporated a broad and diverse array of beliefs, practices, and customs?including those of all but the most extreme Reform and Orthodox Jews. This multifarious religious outlook was bred by Kohut's religious upbring ing in Hungary and rabbinic training at the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau and nurtured by the favorable conditions of late nineteenth-century Hungary and America. It instilled in Kohut an overriding sense of moderation and compromise. Kohut implicitly regarded Orthodoxy, Reform, and other nineteenth-century redefinitions of Judaism as improper deviations from an auth entic, preexisting Jewish traditionalism. In particular, he assailed American radical Reform and Hungarian ultra-Orthodoxy equally as the furthest deviations from the true nature and spirit of rabbinic Judaism and as mutually aggravating symptoms of the same malady: a surplus of religious ideology at the expense of a centuries long rabbinic balance between ideology and practicality. As a communal leader, however, Kohut recognized that, in the face of intractable religious extremism, compromise was not always possible; on the con trary, he challenged religious extremists such as K?hler actively and aggressively. Amid an increasingly tempestuous sea of intracommunal conflicts, Kohut repeat edly faced the arduous task of reaching a "happy reconciliation" between conflict ing Jewish factions while preserving a sense of unity and inclusiveness. In an age of increasing Jewish fractiousness and exclusivity, defending this view was no easy feat for a communal or congregational rabbi. Kohut repeatedly opted, to borrow from the words of Jonathan Sarna, for "compromise for the sake of unity" over "firmness for the sake of principle."3 As a leading rabbinic voice in Hungary and then in America, he championed a sense of unity that encom passed diverse practices and beliefs, facilitated by a preference for reconciliation over conflict and practical solutions over idealistic visions of the future. In such cases, Kohut conceded the paradoxical necessity of separating from movements that were overrun by religious extremists in order to create an inclusive movement.4 Kohut's challenge in advocating unity in a divisive age, moreover, was intensified by the fact that his willingness to countenance differing outlooks extended beyond the four cubits of religious observance into other realms of 3. Jonathan D. Sarna, American Judaism: A History (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2004), 184ff. 4. The search for a balance between unity and diversity has engaged Conservative thinkers for more than a century, most recently expressed by Arnold Eisen at a roundtable discussion "Jewish Denomination in a Post-Denominational World" at the conference of the Association of Jewish Studies, December 17, 2006. 50</page><page sequence="3">Navigating Rough Waters Jewish life. Kohut believed that the age of emancipation and modern nationalism created new possibilities for expressions of Jewish identity. He saw no inherent conflict between a sense of Jewish solidarity and a patriotic love of country, and he denounced those who regarded tradition and patriotism as irreconcilable. He blended un-self-consciously a traditional belief in Jewish peoplehood and cho senness with a profound Magyar and, later, American patriotism. He encouraged Hungarian Jews to embrace the Hebrew and Magyar languages with equal zeal. Once in America, he incorporated a strong American patriotism, an affinity for the English language, and a commitment to nascent Zionism without dislodging his commitment to his Jewish or Magyar roots. In challenging K?hler, therefore, Kohut expressed a sharp disdain for ideo logically supersaturated, extremist sentiments in any direction. He impugned Kohler 's utter dismissal of halakhic authority, no less than Orthodoxy's wholesale rejection of halakhic mutability, as parallel threats to Jewish unity. Instead, Kohut championed a traditional Judaism that was unshackled by the vociferous conflicts between Orthodoxy and Reform and unaltered by the ideologically driven faction alism that had overwhelmed central European Jewry during the nineteenth century and had begun to divide American Jewry during the 1880s. Recognizing the diffi culty of this task, Kohut lauded those Jewish communal leaders who, in his esti mation, had deftly navigated this tortuous path, notably, Zachariah Frankel, Leopold Low, Solomon Judah Rapoport, and Moses Montefiore. He characterized these men not as champions of one point of view over all others but as compro misers, as reconcilers of conflicting points of view into a unified religious outlook that was capable of absorbing diverse customs and beliefs. Kohut's polemic against K?hler thus marked a point of inflection in a career long campaign against religious extremism, disunity, and exclusivity. He targeted communal leaders whom he regarded as extreme rather than moderate. K?hler and his supporters in the American Reform movement were, by the end of the nine teenth century, the most radicalized in the world. Neolog leaders tended toward the moderate side of progressive Judaism. Ultra-Orthodoxy, an invention of Hun garian rabbis, was the most radicalized segment of the Orthodox world; American Orthodoxy was tepid by comparison. To be sure, Kohut recognized the qualitative disparity between the radicalism of American Reform and Hungarian Orthodoxy and the moderate nature of both Neolog Judaism and American Orthodoxy. Kohut's strident criticism of K?hler was sandwiched between more cordial relationships with less radical reformers. During the two decades prior to his arrival in America, Kohut ardently defended Neolog Judaism against Hungarian Orthodoxy. Kohut venerated Leopold Low, the founder and leading spokesman of the Neologs, as a model of religious commit ment and civic patriotism harmoniously blended and as the victim of Orthodoxy's narrow-mindedness and ignorance. Once in America, Kohut was the rabbinics instructor and an important mentor of Rabbi Stephen Wise?Kohler's successor as the leading rabbinic voice and a moderating force within American Reform. Kohut maintained an equally amiable relationship with much of the self defined Orthodox community of late nineteenth-century America. Even Judah Eisenstein, an early outspoken critic of Conservative Judaism, was a comparatively 51</page><page sequence="4">Howard N. Lupovitch mild critic of Kohut and the seminary during its early years. In fact, as Jonathan Sarna and Jeffrey Gurock have pointed out, until the 1950s, the Conservative move ment's boundary with its Orthodox counterpart remained porous and blurred. The real point of contention between more traditional rabbis such as Eisenstein and Con servative rabbis such as Kohut, Mor?is, and Solomon Schechter was whether American Orthodoxy should include all observant Jews, be limited to the narrow conception of Orthodoxy, or be limited to an even narrower conception of Ortho doxy.5 Even Eisenstein, despite his criticisms, endorsed and even sent students to study at the rabbinical seminary that Kohut helped found. Not surprisingly, Kohut and the other founders of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America never defined a clear boundary between Conservative Judaism and American-style Ortho dox Judaism.6 Nonetheless, Kohut refused to ally even with these more moderate expressions of Orthodoxy and Reform. Though religious radicalism was his primary target, Kohut came to regard the existence of even a moderate Reform or Orthodoxy as an impediment to the unified and inclusive Judaism that he recreated in Hungary and America. His unwillingness to sanction even moderate religious movements ultimately cast a dual irony over Kohut's rabbinic career. Though an advocate of unity, he twice played a leading role in the founding of separate movements?in Hungary in 1870, when he founded the Status Quo movement, and in New York in 1885, when he led a secession of rabbis from the Reform movement. Though an advocate of inclusiveness, he founded movements that were minuscule in comparison to their more exclusive rivals. Status Quo remained a distant third behind Orthodoxy and the Neologs, while Conservative Judaism was minuscule for the first decade and a half of its existence.7 Mapping the Middle Ground: Status Quo, Positive-Historical, and Conservative Judaism Historians have labored to pigeonhole Kohut, as they have many of his con temporaries in east-central Europe, especially within the sharply defined German Jewish array of religious currents. Kohut has been placed at various positions within the muddled religious middle ground of nineteenth-century central 5. Sarna, American Judaism, 189-91; and Jeffrey S.

In fact, he was neither Orthodox, nor Reform, nor Positive-Historical. Rather, his was a tradition alist outlook in the pre-nineteenth-century sense of the term, aptly characterized by Gershom Scholem: It is precisely the wealth of contradictions, of differing views, which is encom passed and unqualifiedly affirmed by tradition. There were many possibilities of interpreting the Torah, and tradition claimed them all... Precisely because tradition perceives, receives, and unfolds that which lives in the word, it is the force within which contradictions and tensions are not destructive but rather stimulating and creative.8 Kohut's outlook echoed a centuries-long endeavor by rabbinic thinkers to strike an authentic balance between tradition and innovation while maintaining a usable balance between uniformity and diversity. This search for balance had already found expression during the formative generation of Ashkenazic Judaism in the statutes of Gershom ben Mein "Everything in accordance with the view of communal elders, the customs of old, and the exigencies of the times."9 More than nine centuries later, Kohut echoed this view: "It behooves indi viduals and communities to appoint... such men who acknowledge belief in auth ority and who, at the same time, with comprehension and tact, are willing to consider what may be permitted in view of the exigencies of the times, and what may be discarded, without changing the nature and character of the foun dations of the faith."10 Kohut's commitment to tradition and innovation was a common thread that connected various influences: his moderately traditional upbringing and early edu cation in Kecskemet, his training at Zacharias Frankel's Positive-Historical semin ary in Breslau, his twenty years as a Status Quo rabbi, and his tenure as the rabbi of Ahavat Chesed in Manhattan. He was born in 1842 in Fel?gyh?za, a small town described by his granddaughter, Rebekah Kohut, as "a little speck in Pest County."11 His father, Jacob Kohut, was an accomplished talmudic scholar and polyglot who had immigrated a generation earlier to Hungary from Moravia, hence the Czech surname. Like many Jewish fathers in Hungary, Jacob Kohut spent much of his time on the road; thus, beyond tales of rabbinic achievements, he had little time to devote 8.

Felegyh?za's minuscule Jewish population, moreover, could barely sustain a decent school, and it is doubtful whether Kohut had any education prior to the age of nine. In 1850, his family moved to the larger town of Kecskemet. Once in Kecskemet, Kohut studied with, among others, Heinrich Deutsch, who would later join the Jewish intellectual elite in Pest, and Simon Fischmann. In 1860, Kohut enrolled in the University of Pest, where he studied for two years. In 1861, Kohut enrolled in Zacharias Frankel's seminary in Breslau and quickly established himself as one of Frankel's most gifted students. While study ing at the Breslau seminary, Kohut also received a doctoral degree in Oriental languages from the University of Leipzig. In 1867, he became the first graduate to complete Frankel's program in fewer than six years. In fact, he completed the program in five years?half the standard ten-year duration. Anecdotes regarding Kohut's intellectual prowess abounded. For example, when asked by other stu dents why Kohut was allowed to graduate in five years rather than the standard ten, Frankel answered that Kohut's diligent, tireless study regimen required that nights be counted separately from days in determining the duration of his enroll ment at the seminary.12 Soon after graduating from the Breslau seminary, Kohut returned to Hungary and was invited by Baron J?zsef E?tv?s, the Hungarian minister of religion, to serve as secretary of the recently convened Hungarian Jewish Congress of 1868-69.13 Though he failed to broker an agreement between traditionalists and progressives, his efforts established his reputation as the great Hungarian Jewish compromiser. For the next two decades, from 1868 to 1885, he served as the rabbi of three Status Quo communities?Sz?kesfeh?rv?r, P?cs, and Nagyv?rad?and emerged as the leading voice within the Status Quo movement. Circumstances in 1885 prompted Kohut, along with his wife and eight chil dren, to immigrate to New York. After the family physician moved to New York, Kohut's wife's ailing health necessitated the move. In addition, Kohut was in search of a publisher for his magnum opus, 'Arukh ha-shalem, and it seemed more likely that he would find one in the United States. The difficulty of relocating to America was mitigated by a job offer from Congregation Ahavat Chesed in New York, a comparatively young congregation that was rapidly emerging as the other prominent New York congregation, alongside the older, more established Temple Emmanuel. Within a year of his arrival in New York, Kohut challenged K?hler from the pulpit of Ahavat Chesed and joined Sabato Mor?is and others to found the Jewish Theological Seminary in 1886. Shortly thereafter, he received a ten-year contract extension from his congregants at an annual salary of $6,000.l4 12.

The latter regarded Kohut as a crucial nexus between Conservative Judaism and Frankel's Positive-Historical Judaism, not least of all because Kohut and Bernard Drachman were both founding members of the Conservative movement who had studied with Frankel. The connection to Frankel, these rabbis claimed, provided Conservative Judaism with a legitimizing European ideological Ursprung: "[Conservative Jews] needed a theory of its own that would harmonize tradition and change. They found this theory in the ideas of the Historical School, articulated by Zacharias Frankel and his contemporaries in Germany, that Judaism was a changing and developing entity which through the ages had recognized the temper of the times and changing conditions and had adjusted to them without sacrificing its own integrity."15 This assertion, reiterated countless times, has become a mantra within the rhetoric of Conservative Judaism, most recently intoned seemingly by rote: "Zacharias Frankel is generally regarded as the ideo logical founder of Conservative Judaism."16 To be sure, there are striking similarities between Positive-Historical Judaism and Conservative Judaism. Frankel's Jewish Theological Seminary in Breslau and the rabbinical seminary that Kohut helped found in New York a gen eration later shared a common scholarly approach.17 The students of the two seminaries, moreover, came from a similarly diverse range of religious back grounds and views. Until 1872, Frankel's seminary was the only one in Europe outside Italy; for Kohut and other seminarians, the Breslau seminary was a catch all, attracting students from a variety of religious outlooks whose common aim was to study rabbinic and secular subjects in one institution.18 Similarly, the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, as the only alternative to the increas ingly progressive Hebrew Union College, attracted a body of students from varie gated traditional backgrounds. 15.

This scholarly approach was aptly described by Ismar Schorsch: "With remarkable accu racy, [Frankel's] conception, as it gained adherents across Germany, became known as historical Judaism...The name embodied the essence of Frankel's accomplishment: harnessing the power of Jewish History for the preservation of Judaism...Though more intuitive and less systematic, the program stands comparison with the historical reconciliation of Judaism and philosophy that was begun in tenth-century Baghdad... Studied with compassion and understanding, Jewish history could provide a source of inspiration, meaning, and renewal... Freed from the shackles of dogmatic history on the one hand and the pressure to subordinate the past to the present on the other, the Breslau school was able to achieve a creative symbiosis between traditional piety and modern scholar ship."

Lupovitch Yet Kohut's years in Breslau represented only one step in his coming of age as a rabbinic thinker and communal leader, sandwiched between more protracted experiences in Hungary and America. Though he regarded Frankel as a mentor and a key formative influence, Kohut's outlook combined elements of Breslau and Positive-Historical Judaism with the moderate traditionalism he had inherited from his father and from Simon Fischmann and with the distinct outlook of Status Quo Judaism. The elder Kohut had impressed on his son the scholarly accomplish ments of their family forbears, notably Israel Palota, Jacob Kohut's grandfather. Palota had been a disciple of Ezekiel Landau of Prague and had been among those rabbis who objected to Aron Chorin's lenient ruling regarding sturgeon. Palota's criticism of Chorin, however, was based on what Palota concluded was an improper reading of Landau's seminal responsum on sturgeon. While acknowl edging that Jews in many communities had the custom of eating sturgeon, Palota felt that Chorin had not adequately rooted a lenient stance on sturgeon in rabbinic tradition. Yet Palota still allowed for the possibility that, once a lenient ruling on sturgeon could be properly and convincingly inferred from rabbinic tradition, there would be reason to challenge the custom of eating it.19 Simon Fischmann had impressed a similar message on Kohut. Fischmann was the son of Moses Ezekiel Fischmann, rabbi of Miskolc, who, for more than three decades, remained aloof from the growing conflicts between Orthodox Jews and their adversaries, preferring instead to preserve the moderately tra ditional character of Miskolc Jewry.20 Simon Fischmann had inherited his father's willingness to countenance religious innovations that could be justified within rabbinic tradition and a unending search for unity and reconciliation between conflicting views and camps.21 As secretary of the Hungarian Jewish Congress and as a Status Quo rabbi, Kohut found new expression for this view. In 1868, Kohut coauthored the statutes issued by the Hungarian Jewish Congress of 1868-69. Although the Orthodox critics of the congress alleged that it represented exclusively the interests of Neolog Judaism?to the detriment of Orthodoxy?the content of the statutes suggests a more inclusive posture aimed at preserving an overarching sense of unity. Statute no. 4, for example, allowed disgruntled members of a community to separate "only if they are unable to reach a compromise between themselves and the community to which they had hitherto belonged." Furthermore, Statute no. 11 allowed members of a community to form a separate service and 19. Barnett A. Elzas, "Memoir of Alexander Kohut," in Alexander Kohut, The Ethics of the Fathers, ed.

Like many of the early Status Quo communities, the three com munities he served were fraught with internal conflicts during the 1860s over whether to affiliate with Orthodoxy or Neolog Judaism. By the end of the 1860s, these conflicts had devolved at times into physical fights, periodically requiring local gendarmes to be called in to restore order. Kohut was brought in successively by each community to mediate these disputes. In each case, he helped broker a compromise between advocates of Orthodoxy and Neolog that included affiliation with Status Quo.24 Status Quo, it should be noted, was not simply a rejection of Orthodox and Neolog Judaism but, more broadly, a rejection of the obligation to choose between tradition and innovation, whether this choice was based on rabbinically or histori cally defined criteria or the Zeitgeist. Like the graduates of the seminaries in Breslau and New York, Status Quo rabbis administered a m?lange of congrega tions and communities that were connected solely by the fact that their rabbis came from the same seminary. Neither Status Quo, nor Positive-Historical, nor, at least until the 1950s, Conservative Judaism were formally structured move ments like Orthodoxy and Reform. Neither had a prayer book or, for that matter, anything more than a minimal connection between the communities and congregations presided over by the graduates of the Breslau and New York seminaries. What Mashall Sklare observed half a century ago in his seminal study of Conservative Judaism could have just as easily applied to the congrega tions and communities led by Positive-Historical or Status Quo rabbis: "No organ izational publications are regarded by Conservative Jewry as authoritative, no convention resolutions exist which define Conservatism with any precision, and no promotional materials have been issued which present the Conservative program."25 Alongside the parallels between Frankel's Positive-Historical Judaism, on the one hand, and Status Quo and Conservative Judaism, on the other, it is critical to note the dissimilar contexts in which German, Hungarian, and American Jews 22.

Lupovitch formulated their respective religious views. German Jewry was unique among the Jewish communities of the nineteenth century in enduring first the loss of eman cipation and then a protracted public debate over whether they merited regaining it. This experience, as Michael Meyer has shown, pervaded German Jewry's spec trum of religious identity, from Holdheim 's radical reform to Hirsch 's neo Orthodoxy, and informed Frankel's religious views no less than any other German Jewish religious ideology. Frankel and other German Jewish rabbinic figures?their different approaches notwithstanding?conceived the choice between tradition and innovation as a sharply delineated either/or proposition between those aspects of Judaism deemed essential and thus immutable and those deemed nonessential and thus mandated to be changed according to the Zeitgeist2 To be fair, the methods by which Holdheim, Frankel, Hirsch, and others defined this proposition differed substantially. Frankel's and Geiger 's method, which combined the use of history and rabbinic precedent, differed sharply from Hirsch 's notion of a nonnegotiable corpus of revealed beliefs and practices, and both differed from the preeminence that Holdheim assigned to the spirit of the times. Yet each defined his perspective around the same either/or proposition, with a notable self-conscious sensitivity regarding emancipation. In this regard, the Hungarian and American contexts were crucial in the for mation of Kohut's religious outlook and tactics as communal leader. In both places, the internal religious disputes between traditionalists and innovators unfolded in a highly favorable political and social climate that, inter alia, was rela tively indifferent to the religious affiliation of Hungarian or American Jews. The Hungarian statesmen who emancipated and welcomed Jews into the ranks of the Magyar nation were concerned primarily with Hungarian Jewry embracing Magyar language and culture and far less with the Jews' level of religious obser vance or affiliation. The no less favorable climate in late nineteenth-century America allowed Kohut to continue his overt criticisms of religious extremism with the same lack of self-consciousness, even after relocating to Manhattan. This, perhaps more than anything else, allowed Kohut to hash out a range of iden tities un-self-consciously, without worrying about compromising the political status or social acceptance of his coreligionists.27 26. What David Ellenson noted with respect to Hirsch was no less true for Frankel and other German Jewish ideologues: "No group in nineteenth century Germany is more representative than modern Orthodoxy of the struggle both to adapt and to modify Judaism to the challenges of the time and to maintain a link to the past." See Ellenson, Rabbi Esriel Hildesheimer and the Creation of a Modern Jewish Orthodoxy (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1990), 12. On the distinct experi ence of German Jewry, see Meyer, Response to Modernity, esp. 77-89; and Ephraim Navon, "The Relationship of Religious Thought and Liberal Politics in the Writings of Abraham Geiger, Zacharias Frankel, and Samson Raphael Hirsch, 1830-1851," Jahrbuch des Intituts f?r Deutsche Geschichte 6(1984): 154ff. 27. For a more detailed examination, see Lupovitch, Jews at the Crossroads, 189ff. 58</page><page sequence="11">Navigating Rough Waters The upshot is that, although Kohut was ordained at the Breslau seminary, his religious outlook was more Hungarian than German Jewish. It was during his nearly two decades as a Status Quo rabbi that Kohut formulated the religious outlook that he would bring with him to America in the mid-1880s. That Kohut brought this distinctly Status Quo outlook to America was evident in his relation ship with his new congregation, Ahavat Chesed. Upon his arrival, Kohut appeared to be at odds with his new congregation. The latter, under the guidance of Kohut's predecessor, Adolf H?bsch, had implemented a series of changes much like those advocated by radical reformers. This included expunging liturgical references to the Messiah, the Return to Zion, and the restoration of the sacrificial cult; reciting prayers in German; truncating the weekly Torah reading at the rabbi's discretion; eliminating the observance of Hanukkah, Purim, and the second day of Passover, Sukkot, and Shavuot; introdu cing mixed pews; and adding an organ.28 Rather than confront his congregants, Kohut appealed to their sense of mod eration in his inaugural address to the congregation, a foreshadowing of his polemic with K?hler a few months later: "A narrow conception and enforcement of so-called truth has led to more disaster in the world than war or poison... I offer you the old and the new in happy and blended union. At times you may find that I shall differ from you. I ask you to bear with me as I shall bear with you."29 Gradu ally he convinced his congregants to restore traditional practices. Under his gui dance, the congregation resumed observance of Hanukah, Purim, and the second day of festivals and reinstated the full Torah reading. At the same time, Kohut did not oppose mixed pews.30 In retrospect, Kohut's ability to reach this compromise with so little fanfare reflected a crucial similarity between him and H?bsch, his predecessor. Like Kohut, H?bsch had been born in Hungary. He had been educated in ?buda, Hungary, by tea chers whose religious outlook was much the same as that of Kohut's teachers in Kecs kemet. In America, moreover, H?bsch had been an ardent proponent of Isaac Mayer Wise in the latter's endeavor to fashion what Michael Meyer has described as "an Ephemeral Broad Unity."31 Most important, perhaps, while H?bsch was willing to sanction more extensive changes, he shared Kohut's notion of the rationale of Reform. That is, he insisted that all reform be justifiable within the corpus of rabbinic tradition. This allowed Kohut to smooth the transition by echoing his predecessor outlook: "I consider the truth to be that which has been taught by the rabbinical Jewish doctrine, usages which cannot be based on the Talmud, I reject"32 28.

Elzas, "Memoir of Alexander Kohut," xxxii. 59</page><page sequence="12">Howard N. Lupovitch Defending Moderation and Compromise Although his ability to win over his Hungarian and American congregants shored up his position, Kohut justified his outlook historically in a one-volume history of the Jews.33 Kohut's primary aim in writing this book was to produce a primer for Hungarian Jews to study Jewish history?a Hungarian version of Heinrich Graetz's History of the Jews. Like Graetz's work, Kohut's history focused primarily on scholars and intellectual currents. Like other Hungarian Jewish scholars, though, Kohut noted the absence of Hungarian Jewry in Graetz's multivolume work and paid greater attention to the Jews of Hungary and the Habsburg monarchy. Beneath the Graetzian veneer, Kohut defended his notion of Jewish authen ticity by demonstrating how it had been woven from the outset into the very fabric of rabbinic Judaism. Kohut repeatedly lauded those Jewish scholars, past and present, who embraced a diverse array of views and were willing to engage dis senting points of view constructively, and he impugned those who those refused to countenance such diversity and rejected rival points of view outright. Recount ing the primordial rabbinic disputes between Hillel and Shammai, for example, Kohut noted that, during the formative period of rabbinic Judaism, religious unity initially did not require total uniformity: Already during the age of the Temple there emerged the disputes between Hillel and Shammai, a divergence of opinions in the interpretation of holy scripture that brought into being differing views of the fulfillment of religious command ments ... Already in the making was an effort, from antiquity onward, to forge a unified position based on debated points of tradition, that by the time of Hillel and Shammai were characterized by the fact of dispute.34 Kohut then noted that opposition to this diversity-tolerant approach appeared among the disciples of Shammai, who, "in particular rigidly fashion, adhered to their traditions."35 Such resistance to the possible coexistence of multiple views, Kohut argued, was an endemic countercurrent in the development of Judaism but was consistently overcome by the more tolerant Hillelite view, which counte nanced a sense of unity without precluding a panoply of views. During the nine teenth century, Kohut noted with dismay, the Hillelite mainstream current and the Shammaite countercurrent traded roles. In this sense, Kohut's appraisal of Hillel resonated with a conciliatory, middle-ground position within Hungarian Jewry that, during the latter half of the nineteenth century, was increasingly drowned out by more strident positions to the left and especially to the right. Kohut's Hillel recalled the Hillel described by Aron Chorin of Arad, a like-minded Hungarian reformer who had lived two generations earlier. Chorin, the only non-German participant at the original 33. Alexander Kohut, A zsid?k t?rtenete a biblia befejesz?s?tol ajelenkorig (Nagyvarad, 1881). 34. Ibid., 41. 35. Ibid., 42-13. 60</page><page sequence="13">Navigating Rough Waters Reform Judaism Conferences of the 1840s, is generally regarded as the harbinger of reformist Judaism in Hungary. Chorin's religious outlook, though, was at odds with Reform points of view, particularly his claim that religious reforms had to be justified within the teachings of rabbinic tradition.36 Like Kohut, Chorin was wary of extreme positions?in this case, Reform Judaism's willingness to make changes based primarily on the Zeitgeist or some historical factor. Like Kohut, Chorin extolled Hillel as the archetypical opponent of religious fanaticism: His own perfection united with his charitable love of people, striving for his happiness and the happiness of others, in order to promote with all possible might and skill a child-like devotion to God without exceeding the boundary between piety and fanaticism?the aberration of spirit. Such a spiritual endea vor, he believed, manifested in all practical aspects of life, and engendered the development of beasts into rational men.37 While conceding intramural conflict as a recurring phenomenon in Jewish discourse, Kohut distinguished between constructive and destructive methods among disputants. In describing the thirteenth-century controversy over the writ ings of Maimonides, Kohut championed the defenders of Maimonides yet admitted that "the cause of those who disputed with the Maimonideans was not entirely unjustified." Implicitly, at least, Kohut acknowledged the tenability of the anti-Maimonidean stance: "Maimonides endeavored to reconcile philosophy with Jewish belief and outlook... but his opponents insisted that the word of the Talmud was polar opposite with its implicit message. The grass-roots (t?sgy? keres) Talmudists wanted nothing to do with philosophic exploration."38 It was not the rabbinic opposition to Maimonides per se that Kohut censured but the dis unifying effects that both sides of the conflict precipitated. The loftiest aim, Kohut argued, was to disagree without undermining a sense of unity, that is, by allowing conflicting views to coexist. 36. Insofar as he is still often pigeonholed as the father of Reform Judaism in Hungary, Chorin remains a largely misunderstood figure. This is due in no small part to the fact that most works on Chorin still rely primarily on Leopold Low's factually rich but biased biography of Chorin, written a century and half ago; see Low, "Aron Chorin," in Gesammelte Schriften II (Hildesheim, 1979), 251-420. Three notable exceptions are Moshe Pelli's short essay, which presents Chorin as a transi tional figure between Haskalah and reform; Avigdor L?wenheim's short article on Chorin and the Par isian Sanh?drin, which raises the question of Chorin 's complex religious outlook but settled for categorizing him as a Hungarian Israel Jacobson, a proto-Reform, or a proto-Neolog rabbi; and Moshe Carmilly-Weinberger's seminal article on Chorin and his relationship with the Jewish commu nity of Arad, which does not address Chorin's relationship with the German Reformers or with the Neologs. See Pelli, "Milhamto ha-ra'ayonit ve-hahalachtit shel ha-Rav Aharon Chorin be'ad reforma datit be-yahadut," Hebrew Union College Annual 39 (1968, Hebrew section): esp. 64-69; L?wenheim, "Igeret Aharon Chorin le-asefat ha-nichbadim ha-yehudiyim be-Paris," Ziyon XLVI (1991): 201-204; and Carmilly-Weinberger, "The Jewish Reform Movement in Transylvania and Banat: Rabbi Aaron Chorin," Studia Judaica 5 (1996): 13-60. 37.

Lupovitch This ability, Kohut suggested, was exemplified by Nachmanides, whom Kohut singled out as the exemplar of rabbinic conciliation. Although Nachma nides disagreed with Maimonides, he never dismissed Maimonides: To Maimonides, Judaism was a religion of ideas; to Nachmanides it was a reli gion of feelings and emotion. Nonetheless Nachmanides acted with great respect?even toward the speculative passages. He looked with circumspection at the French communities, whose agents proposed that Maimonides' Guide could be censored but the Sefer ha-Madda could be permitted...He paid Mai monides great respect, but did not indulge either side's lopsidedness.39 Nachmanides' role as a facilitator of compromise provided Kohut with a model through which to laud similar-minded figures in the nineteenth century. Thus, Kohut lauded Solomon Judah Rapoport as a latter-day reconciler of traditional and novel beliefs, as "the bearer of light and a preserver of knowledge... who col lected the light of science and the warming rays of belief in a single focal point." Like Kohut, Rapoport rejected both Orthodox and Reform positions as inauthentic by pointing to Judaism's internal mechanism for innovation: "Were there some matter among our customs or laws that stood in need of reform, it would be reformed or renewed with the passing of time."40 Rapoport thus saw no contradiction between recent scientific findings and extant traditional beliefs. In Rapoport's "union of science and belief," Kohut saw a means of reconciling the Orthodox notion that law and belief trumped science and reason with the Reform notion that placed science and reason in an anterior position to law and belief. Kohut commended Rapoport's assertion that religious belief and scientific discovery are complementary aspects of a complete mind: "The union of science and belief that we encounter in harmonious pervasiveness in all of Rapoport's cultural, historical, biographical, and scientific works contrasts with the way that we once shamefully repressed the power of judgment that admires an orderly and visionary mind."41 In this regard, Rapoport embodied the essence of Status Quo Judaism, namely, the inherent right of every Jew not to choose between religious beliefs and scientific knowledge. "For all those who do not want to estrange themselves from belief by whirling around toward the icy principles of disengaged thoughts... and for all those who want to rear the children with the powerful nourishment of a belief-strengthening hearty spirit, it is the union of belief and knowledge that refuses to cast the behemoth of superstition and fantasy in order to condemn 39.

Rapoport's true strength, Kohut argued, lay in his ability to see faith and science as equally authentic elements of one's Jewish identity: Rapoport was true to his two names, Solomon and Judah. Like Solomon he was wise and learned; like Judah he was a true scion of all the beliefs that ori ginated with Jacob... Rapoport placed the ark of knowledge into the sanctuary of belief.... He maintained that science and Judaism are equally favored sons, the young offspring of the lofty scholarship and the ancient, towering cedars hewn as from new and born fruit.42 The ability of scholars like Nachmanides and Rapoport to appose seemingly conflicting points of view provided for Kohut the basis for an antidote to intracom munal strife. Communal unity, Kohut believed, inhered within the diverse corpus of laws in the Talmud. Sadly, Kohut admitted, recent developments had eroded this dimension of talmudic influence: The Talmud has been such a mirror for the Jews themselves for centuries, especially showing a clear image of their spiritual life and development. Unequaled, it contrives a correspondence between even the most distant matters, and finds distinctions even between the most related. It strives, however, not toward the sort of fault-finding, analyzing, and the sort of dis secting inquiry that often degenerates into casuistry ... Indeed, Talmudic study was the savior of the Jews in the Middle Ages, which alas has not carried through to modern times.43 The solution, therefore, was to hardwire the perspective of a Nachmanides or Rapoport into the institutional framework of communal life, notably, the synago gue and the schoolhouse. Kohut noted that, until recently, synagogues had pre served and reinforced a sense of unity: "Jews have built belief systems and magnificent temples, temples that inspire awe ... owing to the magnificence of a sense of community ... an orderly, unified, agreeable, community ... that is so willing to sacrifice everything ... but their highest privilege: communal harmony {Gemeindefrieden).,"44 During the nineteenth century, Kohut noted, synagogues had been transformed into focal points of ideological disputes, par ticularly in Hungary: "In so many Israelite communities here in Hungary, the building of synagogues has become the cornerstone and the impetus for Israel to divide into separate factions. The synagogue, which was once a house of assem bly and unity, is now exalted over the wreckage of communal unity." Yet he remained optimistic that unity could be preserved. He extolled his own followers 42. Kohut, Ged?chtniss-Rede zu Ehren der verewigten Salomo Jehuda Rapoport, 8, 11-12. 43.

Lupovitch for resisting the trend toward divisiveness: "Not so here! In this healthy mountain air, the marshplant of discord thrives not at all."45 An overarching conclusion that emerges from Kohut's history and other writings is that conflicting religious views do not, in and of themselves, threaten or undermine communal harmony or unity. Rather, ideological positions that rigi dity to the point of no longer tolerating concurrent ideas are the source of disunity and disharmony. In retrospect, such a mentality was ideally suited for a Status Quo rabbi facing ideological challenges and calumnies from both directions. Between Compromise and Controversy If Kohut was to endorse an overriding sense of unity convincingly, he had to justify his own decisions to found separate movements in Hungary and America. He found this justification in the religious dispute between Baruch Spinoza and the Jewish community of Amsterdam. Kohut attributed the break between Spinoza and the Jews of Amsterdam to a flaw in each side of the conflict. Initially during the seventeenth century, Kohut noted, traditional Jewish life in Amsterdam had been moderated by the community's leading intellectual figure, Menasseh ben Israel. Under ben Israel's guidance, narrower and more parochial ideas were set aside in favor of more inclusive ideas?notably, the universal connection between God, Israel, and the cosmos. This, Kohut claimed, allowed Menasseh ben Israel "to fortify the dilapidated foundation of Israel" by instilling a greater sense of communal unity.46 However, as ben Israel's disciples succumbed to more elitist and exclusive notions, the result was the emergence of a more radical, antireligious expression of freethinking. For Kohut, Spinoza represented, first and foremost, a backlash against religious rigidity: As ben Israel's disciples began to distort its foundation... the fruitful womb of Judaism again bore a giant who soundly cured the perverseness and aberration of the world, and, more deeply acquainted with the relationship between heaven and earth and between the material and the spiritual, tore asunder like a second Abraham the idols before which the world groveled in awe and intellectual torpidity... His name was Baruch Spinoza.47 On a fundamental level, Spinoza's defection underscored a weakness in traditional Judaism: "As his knowledge of foreign ideas increased, he became more and more alienated from rabbinic forms of Judaism. Whatever was not justifiable to his bright, profoundly discerning mind was deemed superstition and inexorably cast aside; his search matured his breach with Judaism." By justifying Spinoza's break with the Jewish community, moreover, Kohut justified any break with an intractable, entrenched rigid establishment. For Kohut, the irreconcilability of the conflict between Spinoza and the Jews of Amsterdam became a metonym 45. Ibid, 4. 46. Kohut, Zsid?k t?rt?nete, 224. 47. Ibid., 228. 64</page><page sequence="17">Navigating Rough Waters for latter-day conflicts between religious extremists and their adversaries: The intractability of the former left the latter with no choice but to leave. Yet Kohut did not attribute Spinoza's alienation solely to an increasingly rigid religious tra ditionalism but rather to a flaw in Spinoza's own anemic Jewish upbringing: "The reminiscences of his youth were unable to put up even a narrow spiritual fight? and he broke with his practices."48 A stronger Jewish upbringing and education, Kohut seems to have been suggesting, may have averted Spinoza's defection. In this regard, Kohut contrasted Spinoza with Zacharias Frankel and Leopold Low. Like Spinoza, Frankel rejected a religious position that he regarded as overly radical and, in this case, overly progressive: the rejection of Hebrew as the language of prayer by some of the more radical participants at the Reform conferences of the 1840s. In addition, Frankel was assailed by more traditionalist elements as being overly progressive. Unlike Spinoza, however, Frankel remained committed to tra ditional Judaism despite his alienation from dominant religious positions within the Jewish community. Kohut explained Frankel's unbreakable connection to a scholarly background that was rich enough to deflect invectives from any direction: It is popular in recent times, especially in Hungary's Orthodox circles where so many have formulated opinions that reflect an unscientific and blurred jud gement, to discredit the very scholar who stands atop his generation. These whipper snappers {Gernegrossen) have no worldly or even Jewish-scientific grounding and cannot understand even a Mishna. These cock-eyed eccentrics, sapped by the legacy of a truncated Talmudic education, tell endless fibs drawn from the rusted quirks of their pilpulistic petty merchant spirit and from the rotted arsenal of their memories of youth. They never learned that which is right, and, indeed, the only thing they "learned" was to claim auda city as a privileged possession... These spiritual midgets... are not even worthy of tying one of Frankel's shoelaces.49 Yet as much as Kohut venerated his mentor's successful struggle against extreme positions, he regarded Low's struggle as even more successful: Low resisted without breaking with part of the Jewish community. Low, whom Kohut lauded as a "pearl of Judaism and of the [Hungarian] Fatherland," was the leader of the nascent Neolog movement during the 1840s. He emerged in 1848 as one of the most visible Jewish supporters of the Hungarian Revolution and ensuing War of Independence. During the 1860s, he edited and published Ben Chananja, the leading German-language newspaper of Hungarian Jewry.50 Like Aron Chorin, Low has often been pigeonholed by historians as a German Jewish-style religious reformer living in Hungary, just as Neolog Judaism has 48.

Lupovitch often been regarded as the Hungarian branch of the Reform movement. Low's atti tude toward religious reform, though, reiterated Chorin's insistence on rooting religious reform in the parameters defined by rabbinic tradition?one of the central reasons why Neolog Jews tended to take a more conservative direction than German Jewish reformers. Nonetheless, Low's comparatively conservative attitude toward reform intensified the invectives hurled against him by Hungarian Orthodoxy: "All fanaticism, indifference, superstition, and ignorance joined together against him and assaulted him with projectiles."51 Low spearheaded the campaign against religious fanaticism and ignorance; as Kohut noted, Low "overturned obscurantists and their black, greasy-winged statutes whose influence on life was fading and not awakening." Yet, as Kohut noted, Low's rich Jewish background enabled him to challenge religious extre mists without ultimately breaking with Judaism: In strong faith in the redeeming hand of the master, Low carried God in his bosom; he remained true to his obligations with the fastness of his character despite all the inhibiting influences... Like a powerful protagonist of religious emancipation, he shot down the Goliath of superstitions and discredited the hosts of fanaticism of Israel... the Guardians of the Faith {Shomre ha-Dat) like sacred Beasts {Hayot ha-Kodesh), large and small, snorted ire and ven geance at Low, stampeding their bold attacks with course kicks, to no avail.52 The challenge in contesting religious hard-liners, as Kohut understood it, was transforming potential Spinozas into Frankels or, better yet, into Leopold Lows. This required weaving the outlooks of scholars like Rapoport and Nachmanides into the curriculum of Jewish schools. Paraphrasing a talmudic adage that the edu cation of children supersedes even the onset of the messianic age, Kohut priori tized the day-to-day concern for proper education over ideological cogitation, such as speculation as to when the Messiah might arrive: "Whether or not we embrace the romantic calculation of the messianic age, we rhapsodize with soulful pleasure in the preparation and calculation of our children's future. Our children are the pledges of our future, bearers of the messianic kingdom."53 A proper communal education system, Kohut believed, would undermine the roots of extremism: "The present generation's religious knowledge, with the exception of a few individuals, is based merely on childhood reminiscences, which defied obliviousness by happenstance through concealed pockets of memory... . So sad is this to a people who cherished the notion of studying the Torah day and night." Owing to the deleterious impact of lesser scholars and tea chers, Kohut suggested, the curriculum of the Talmud Torah had degenerated into 51. Ibid., 11. Michael Silber has noted that more conservative progressive positions were the target of the most virulent Orthodox tirades. See Silber, "Ultra-Orthodoxy: The Invention of a Tra dition," in The Uses of Tradition: Jewish Continuity in the Modern Era, ed.

Nonetheless, Kohut looked forward to the revival of Jewish edu cation under the proper supervision: I can think of no other ways than the classical, highest education offered by the Talmud-Tora.... to insure that the achievement of knowing the bible will no longer be a mere pious wish but will have a real basis. Students pre pared and equipped with knowledge of the five books of Moses will be able to have a greater appreciation for the religious instruction offered to them. Tea chers who have learned the fundamental truth of Judaism will be appointed to present Judaism and impress it upon the children... Nonetheless, I know of no tried and tested means of educating our children other than that offered by the Talmud Torah, a foundation that will forever be revered and will surely produce a very rich spiritual dividend.54 Tradition and Patriotism Kohut's willingness to engage internal religious conflicts so un-self consciously reflected a level of unbridled self-confidence exhibited by Jews in pre-World War I Hungary and America. This self-confidence was buttressed by unimpeded possibilities for acceptance into the mainstream and by a virtual absence of antisemitism as a mainstream political or cultural phenomenon. Hun garian and American Jews, in contrast to German Jews, experienced relatively little pressure to look over their shoulder, as it were, to assess whether a particular religious innovation or lack thereof would compromise their legal status. Even in Hungary, except for a brief period during the 1840s, religious behavior had little or no bearing on the debate over Jewish emancipation in Hungary. The price tag of emancipation in Hungary consisted primarily of adopting the Magyar language and embracing Magyar culture. By the 1860s, proponents of emancipation placed, at most, secondary importance on the particular religious behavior of Magyarized Jews.55 They picked and chose between tradition and innovation un-self-consciously and with little or no sense of urgency. For Hungarian Jews, moreover, the comprehensiveness of emancipation precluded not only concerns regarding citizenship but also any doubts regarding the inclusion of Hungarian Jewry in the Magyar nation. Kohut, in this regard, exemplified Hungarian Jewry. He was an ardent Magyar nationalist who named his children after Habsburg and Hungarian notables. Even after immigrating to 54. Alexander Kohut, Aufruf zur Gr?ndung eines Talmud-Thoravereins (Pecs, May 16,1875), 7-9. 55. Elsewhere I have shown that, until 1849, Lajos Kossuth's link between religious reform and emancipation dominated the discourse on Jewish emancipation; thereafter, and especially during the 1860s, Kossuth's notion was supplanted by those of Bertalan Szemere and Baron J?zsef E?tv?s. E?tv?s and Szemere were relatively indifferent to the particular religious affiliation of Hungarian Jews, as long as the latter embraced the Magyar language and culture. See Lupovitch, Jews at the Crossroads, 189ff. 67</page><page sequence="20">Howard N. Lupovitch America and embracing American citizenship and patriotism, he maintained a strong commitment to his Magyar heritage. He was especially devoted to Lajos Kossuth and was often referred to as the "Jewish Kossuth."56 Kohut had little or no concern for the possibilities of full Jewish inclusion into mainstream, whether in Hungary or in America. Kohut, like other Hungarian citizens, believed that religious differences had no bearing on his newly attained status as citizen of Magyar. This, more than anything else, distinguished Kohut from Frankel and his fellow German Jewish rabbis. In this regard, it is instructive to compare Kohut's attitude toward emancipa tion with that of German Jewish ideologues such as Frankel and Samson Raphael Hirsch. To be sure, Kohut's fervent embrace of emancipation resembled that of other traditionalists. Like Frankel and Hirsch, Kohut urged Jews to take full advan tage of the material benefits made possible by emancipation. There were important differences in this regard between Kohut and his German Jewish contemporaries. While ascribing a quasi-biblical significance to emancipation, seeing in it a fulfill ment of the prophet Jeremiah's primordial instructions to the Jews in exile, Hirsch qualified this religious endorsement with a cautionary note: "But sorrowfully indeed would I mourn if Israel should forget itself so as to deem emancipation... not too dearly purchased through capricious curtailment of the Torah, capricious abandonment of our vitality."57 Frankel echoed this concern. He took issue with those among his contem poraries who claimed that religious reform was a necessary sacrifice to obtain emancipation. Instead, he drew a sharp line between the political implications of emancipation and the religious implications of religious reform: "There is no connection between the claim for and granting of emancipation as an act of justice, and internal reform of Judaism as a religious act... When we strive for emancipation... we want to attain not only the pleasure of rights... we see in emancipation a triumph of justice and humanity."58 Kohut, too, cautioned against paying too high a price to obtain these benefits. Like Hirsch and Frankel, he was wary of religious reformers who regarded emancipation as a prize worthy of abandoning Jewish tradition: If it is true that the all-important event of emancipation constitutes a new era in the history of Hungarian Jewry, we should approach this watershed moment with sober thoughts as with all turning points, and look back to the past with a careful eye before crossing the threshold into the future.... I would not want to attain a Jewish law at the cost of maintaining our traditions and way of life. Yet Kohut took equal issue with traditionalists who embraced emancipation tepidly and with suspicion or regarded emancipation as potentially antithetical 56.

Kohut rejected such views as overly simplistic: "Those who by virtue of narrow-minded thinking... are indifferent to the lofty idea of emancipation?I utterly ignore... I turn instead to those who rejoice in obtaining emancipation, but only to those who understand this moment with the proper pro portion"59 The latter phrase may well have referred to Hirsch, who regarded emancipation as a matter of "secondary consideration,"60 that is, largely in utilitar ian terms as a means to greater loyalty: "Let us repeat?in whichever land Jews shall live as citizens, as inhabitants or enjoying special protection, they shall honor and love the princes and government as their own, contribute with every possible power to their good, and fulfil all the duties toward prince and land which a subject owes his prince, an inhabitant to his land, and a citizen to his country."61 In other words, Hirsch regarded emancipation as the latest challenge to traditional Jews to minimize the extent to which civic duty interfered with internal Jewish life: "I bless [emancipation], if Israel does not regard emancipation as the goal of its task, but only as a new condition of its mission... but I should grieve if Israel... would welcome emancipation as the end of the exile, and the highest goal of its historic mission. If Israel regards this glorious concession merely as a means of securing a greater degree of comfort... it would show that Israel had comprehended the spirit of its own law."62 Frankel embraced emancipation more fervently?or perhaps less pragmati cally?but his view of emancipation differed from Kohut's in terms of the impli cations of emancipation for the national identity of the Jews. Frankel's initial optimism regarding the prospect of German Jews being fully accepted as Germans eventually gave way to a more limited sense of inclusion: "To a German," Frankel noted, "Germanness is a Race; those who stand outside it do not belong to his state, and can find no space in it."63 By contrast, Kohut claimed that emancipation meant that Jews had attained not only equal rights and full citizenship but also total inclusion in the ranks of the Magyar nation. Indicative of the contrast between Kohut's and Frankel's disparate apprai sals of Magyar and German nationalism is how each used the festival of Hanukkah as a metaphor for the age of emancipation. Frankel regarded the coming age of emancipation, for the material benefits it promised, as the latest in a series of exter nal challenges to Jewish belief: We have once again emerged from the day of Antiochus where again rages an inner enemy, the inner betrayal of our entrails overcoming and discovering 59.

We halt at this point. And if the principle of the state holds that Jews cannot enjoy the full rights of men, so we suffer for our religion.64 By contrast, Kohut regarded the Magyar nobles who had advocated emancipation as latter-day Maccabees: They rushed to proclaim and confer emancipation on our people, just as our ancestors the Maccabees won a victory for their religious beliefs. In our country illustrious people, whom we could call Magyar Maccabeans, lead this charge. The most preeminent of the Maccabee family were Judah and Simon, one the heroic champion the other the wise mentor. Such are the Magyar Maccabees. Ferenc De?k, the moral champion, the sage caring leader of the land; and Joseph E?tv?s, the preeminent moral hero, the heart of the land, the wise mentor?a blessing and gratitude to their memory. Thanks to this gallant nation...Let us kindle the Hanukkah candle in our temple and in our homeland.65 Thus, it is not surprising that Kohut, while looking to Frankel as an intellectual mentor, regarded Leopold Low as an exemplar of religious commitment and patri otism harmoniously blended: Just as the aboriginal Judah Maccabee slew his adversaries, so our Judah Low rendered harmless our fatherland's Esau. He reproached the Hungarian Jacob for a lack of patriotism... He was a martyr of patriotism, allowing himself to be incarcerated, and from the prison dungeon he cried out: "Oh Magyar Nation, behold the Hungarian Jew is a good son to the fatherland..." and, from then on, one dreaded reproaching or unjustly accusing Hungarian Israelites.66 Once in America, Kohut transplanted his seamless blend of tradition and patriotism to the New World. His dual commitment to Magyar nationalism and Jewish tradition easily absorbed American patriotism as a third component. His steadfast commitment to Magyar nationalism?he remained a devotee of Lajos Kossuth throughout his life?did not preclude him from having a deep com mitment to America. He mastered the English language within three years of his arrival in America. In an address commemorating the completion of the Statue of Liberty, Kohut expressed this devotion to his new home: "In this land of our 64.

Like Kohut, Mor?is was deeply connected to the country where he had been born and raised?Italy. His forbears had been among the Jews who settled in Livorno/Leghorn in the sixteenth century. His father, Samuel Mor?is, had been a freemason and had been imprisoned during the 1820s for agitating along side his Italian Christian neighbors against Habsburg and Papal rule. Sabato, born in 1823, had been deeply influenced by the writings of Giuseppe Mazzini and the Young Italy movement, with its motto Dio e il Pop?lo, or "God and the Nation." Mor?is would later apply this motto in his own blend of tradition and Italian and American patriotism.68 Jastrow, born six years after Mor?is, had grown up in Poznan, an area of intense cultural conflict between ethnic Germans and Poles. Later, as rabbi of Warsaw, Jastrow sided with the cause of Polish nationalism against the Russian empire, encouraging his followers to rise in revolt along with their Polish neigh bors. After Russian soldiers fired on Polish demonstrators, killing five, Jastrow addressed an assembled crowd of Jews and Christians, promising that his congre gation would support the Polish revolt. On the following Saturday, in violation of the prohibition against work on the Sabbath, Jastrow joined the twenty-three members of the Jewish tribunal and the heads of the Catholic Church to lead a massive demonstration. The following Saturday, Jastrow delivered the first-ever Polish-language sermon in Warsaw, in which he eulogized the demonstrators killed by Russian soldiers.69 One People, Multiple Tongues The un-self-consciousness that made this synthesis of tradition and patrio tism possible was carried a step further in America in Kohut's attitude toward language. He believed that fluency in Hebrew and the vernacular created an optimal situation for the Jews, both with respect to their internal development and to their relationship to the non-Jewish world. His advocacy of the vernacular was typical of Jews who embraced emancipation. He regarded a full embracing of the Magyar language as the true price of admission to Magyar civilization: "The isolating agent that has prevented us from resembling the Magyar nation is none other than our neglect of our beautiful sounding and charmingly resonant Magyar language; indeed, Hungarian Jews have until now spoken to this people with foreign sounding lips ... and we have in effect been asking for emancipation 67. Alexander Kohut, Thanksgiving Day: An Appeal to the American People (New York, 1890), 3. 68. Davis, Yahadut America Be-Hitpathutah, 38^2. 69. Ibid., 55. 71</page><page sequence="24">Howard N. Lupovitch with a foreign tongue. For this reason, our emancipation was been delayed until now."70 He regarded the mastery of the Magyar language attained by Jews such as Low as critical: "Low immigrated here only four decades ago from a foreign land, and in a remarkably short time he spoke the tongue of the people in a thoroughly Hungarian idiom just like a master of eloquence, such that at so many opening ceremonies of Hungarian synagogues he was called in as a national interpreter."71 Yet Kohut did not advocate embracing the Magyar language at the expense of the Hebrew language. On the contrary, he regarded mastery of Hebrew as equally important as mastery of the vernacular as the key to Jewish survival and the heart of a flourishing of Jewish culture.72 Here again, it is useful to contrast Kohut with Hirsch. Hirsch's advocacy of Jews learning Hebrew had an implicit, apologetic undertone. That is, he regarded the study of Hebrew as a way of facil itating one's general education and knowledge: The intellectual and cultural benefit to be derived from Hebrew instruction will be greatly increased if, when he is a little older, he can be initiated into the study of Talmudic law.... The very appearance of these writings, devoid as they are of all vowel signs and punctuation marks, gives an idea of the mental alertness which is required to read them, and how excellent a training this reading of itself gives in alacrity of thought, closeness of attention and shrewdness of conjecture.73 Kohut attributed to the Hebrew language a much deeper significance. His earliest area of research interest, Persian influences on the Hebrew language in the ancient world, explored the linguistic similarities between Hebrew and other Near Eastern languages. This project laid a cornerstone for his overall conception of linguistic acculturation by Jews through the ages. He regarded the Hebrew language as a vehicle through which Jews absorbed the best elements of others cultures?a major source of Jewish strength: Israel gathered from the literature of eleven folks-families?the product of Assyrian, Pheonician, Chaldean, Samaritan, Syrian, Old Persian, New Persian, Arabic, Greek, Byzantine, and finally Latin, and from their vocabu lary gathering together multifarious building materials to form a creative genius: the Jewish people.... For many centuries, its industrious laborers gathered together from the literature of the world and from the fields of 70. Kohut, F?lreismert Izrael, 8. 71. Kohut, Leopold L?w, 16. 72.

In his history of the Jews, Kohut linked two late tenth-century scholars as the driving forces in the development of rabbinic culture in Europe: Solomon ben Isaac (Rashi) and Nathan ben Yechiel of Rome. The works of Rashi, the great progenitor of biblical and talmudic commentary, would not have had such lasting import and impact without ben Yechiel's massive lexicon of rabbinic terminology, 'Arukh ha shalem.75 Indeed, the aim of maintaining the connection to the pristine origins of the Hebrew language provided the impetus for Kohut's magnum opus: a new, criti cal edition of ben Yechiel's 'Arukh. Kohut spent years clarifying and annotating the hundreds of entries in this work. In his introduction, he departed momentarily from the arid world of etymology and grammar that makes up the bulk of this voluminous work to reiterate what he regarded as the indispensability of maintaining the integrity of rabbinic texts: "I shall enumerate those individuals noted for clarifying the words and teaching of our sage... who distinguished between the words of the translations of the Talmud and those words commonly used only by the sages of the Talmud."76 Kohut then pur ported a less obvious yet critical reason for preserving the integrity of the Hebrew language, a reason with implications for his own age. He cited an example of anti Jewish figures who attempted to use a flaw in textual transmission against the Jews: After Rabbi Elijyahu there emerged the Christian scholar Johann Buxtdorf, who came to Hungary and attempted to obfuscate the distinctions between texts based on his studies of Jewish texts and on which he based his book Lexicon Chaldaicum Talmudicum et Rabbinicum, which BuxtdorTs son published... In this way, he frequently derided the teachings of Israel and interpreted dishon estly and mocked us by departing from the interpretations of Rabbi Natan... The Pope castigated him...but this frightened us as we saw to our dismay that... by distorting the truth he implicated also other Jewish scholars as well.77 In the age of emancipation, Kohut suggested, a precise understanding of the Hebrew language would ensure that Judaism is understood properly by Jews and non-Jews alike; precluding assertions that a commitment to Judaism somehow prevented traditional Jews from being loyal, patriotic citizens. Thus, Kohut 74. Kohut, F?lreismert Izrael, 6. 75. Kohut, Zsid? t?rt?nete, 128-29. "The many questions and many answers in modesty of the much learned Rashi, here and there he put questions to such men whose instruction was not under his great Talmudic authority, such as Rabbi Nathan ben Yechiel who was a teacher in a Talmudic academy in Rome and who compiled the famous Talmudic-Midrashic dictionary, the Aruch." 76. Alexander Kohut, ed., Sefer 'arukh ha-shalem (New York, 1955), xlv. 77. Ibid., xlv-xlvi. 73</page><page sequence="26">Howard N. Lupovitch regarded Hebrew not only as a pillar of Jewish identity but as a secondary prere quisite for emancipation, alongside mastery of the Magyar language: "With regard to the Hebrew language?we should not deprive ourselves of the holy relic from the tradition that remains with us from our forefather's heritage... without exag geration, it is possible to assert that the neglect of our language is a sacrilege, for whose sake our emancipation has been delayed until now.78 Moderation: Kohut's Path to Practical Zionism Neither his commitment to religious tradition, nor his Magyar and American patriotism, nor his simultaneous embrace of Hebrew and the vernacular preempted Kohut's support of the nascent Zionist movement. Here it is useful to note a par allel between Kohut and the Hungarian Jewish Zionist poet and essayist Avigdor Hameiri. Like Kohut, Hameiri (born Feuerstein) remained a committed Magyar patriot decades after embracing Zionism. Like Kohut, Hameiri was able, as one historian recently noted, "to have been simultaneously moved by Magyar and Jewish notions of collectivity, without necessarily worrying that one impinges on the other."79 Like other traditionalists, moreover, Kohut regarded the practical aims of Hibbat Zion perfectly consonant with traditional Judaism.80 For Kohut, the essence of Zionist activity lay in the building of settlements rather than the con struction of a political ideology, in particular, in the achievements and contribution of Moses Montefiore.81 In "The Fourth Moses," Kohut portrayed Montefiore as the fourth in a series that included (the biblical) Moses ben Amram, Moses Maimonides, and Moses Mendelssohn. In essence, Kohut believed that Montefiore was the practical or "applied" version of the other three. Moses Montefiore was no lawgiver like Moses ban Amram, but he was a receptor and follower of the law. Moses Montefiore was not a philosopher of religion like Moses Maimonides, but was a philanthropist of religion, that is, the aim of his well-endowed charity work stemmed from his religious impulse. Moses Montefiore was never a popular philosopher like Moses Men delssohn, but his philosophy, that Judaism is a religion of deeds, he popular ized through undying practical achievements.82 78.

Alexander Kohut, "Moses Montefiore: The Fourth Moses in the History of Judaism," American Hebrew, October 9, 1885, 140-41. 74</page><page sequence="27">Navigating Rough Waters What's more, Kohut believed that Montefiore's achievements brought to fruition the aims of the other three: What the first Moses taught, "The Torah is not in heaven,"... the Torah lived not merely on his lips as a mere theory, but lived in his heart?not as merely distant sentimentality but practical experience. The second Moses wrote a "guide to the perplexed," Montefiore served as a guide to those who are per plexed ... The third Moses wrote a dignified work title: Jerusalem. The fourth Moses transformed the dust of Jerusalem.83 Kohut thus presented Montefiore as a metonym for the overarching significance of Zionism as a culmination of centuries of Jewish aspirations: Like Moses ben Maim?n 's Yad Hazakah, the work of Montefiore's imagina tive hand is likewise divided into sections and chapters. There are seven sec tions, as seven times he toured the Holy Land and enriched it with Talmud Torah schools, hospitals, agricultural schools, artisan houses, and many other humanitarian institutions that eternalize the name Moses Montefiore... is it any wonder that all of Israel wept at the passing of the fourth Moses just as they did for the first Moses?"84 In retrospect, Kohut's affinity for practical Zionist initiatives points to the connection between a moderate religious outlook and a willingness among tra ditional Jews to embrace Zionism. The most extreme elements within Orthodoxy and Reform rejected Zionism outright during the 1890s and remained adamantly opposed to Zionism longer than more moderate groups. This tendency explains, inter alia, why Status Quo was the first Hungarian Jewish movement to embrace Zionism.85 Kohut and Schechter: Similar Positions, Opposite Results At the time of Kohut's premature death in 1894, the Conservative movement remained mired at the margins of American Jewish life, with a minuscule member ship that was overshadowed by American Reform. A year later, the leaders of the movement brought over Solomon Schechter to deliver a series of lectures in Phi ladelphia.86 In retrospect, Schechter's arrival as the new leader of the movement jump-started the anemic movement and seminary founded by Kohut and Mor?is and propelled Conservative Judaism to a position of preeminence by the interwar period. 83.

Lupovitch In retrospect, the similarities and differences between Kohut and Schechter underline the reasons for Kohut's successes and failures. Like Kohut, Schechter was aided by a towering reputation as a world-class scholar and academic; Schech ter's work on the Cairo Geniza paralleled Kohut's on Persian literature and the 'Arukh ha-shalem, although the former was far more accessible to a wider reader ship. Moreover, Schechter's notion of a bilingual American Jewry, fluent in English and Hebrew, recalled Kohut's affinity for Jewish bilingualism. For both, bilingualism reflected the ability of Judaism to assimilate foreign influences constructively, as Schechter noted in 1910: "That certain foreign beliefs and foreign usages should creep in was unavoidable, as Israel neither could nor would shut itself off entirely from the influences of the outside world. But they had to pass through that process of assimilation to things Jewish, and of elimin ation of things un-Jewish, which was strongly at work in the synagogue; and through this their transformation and complete conversion to Judaism were effected."87 Most important, perhaps, Schechter brought to Conservative Judaism a powerful, inclusive sense of unity much like Kohut's. Schechter characterized this view as "Catholic Israel," an all-inclusive notion of Jewish tradition and inno vation, and between unity and diversity.88 Kohut never coined as catchy a phrase, but his life and career embodied the essence of this phrase. Like Schechter, Kohut worked toward unifying all traditional Jews under the banner of a common, inclus ive religious outlook. From the outset, however, Schechter had certain advantages over Kohut. Between the time of Kohut's death and Schehcter's emergence as the leader of Conservative Judaism, two changes realigned the sympathies of American Jewry. First, eastern European Jewish immigrants were a full decade further along toward becoming more comfortable and self-confident in America and toward viewing their religious affiliation in "the pragmatic and utilitarian terms of their fellow citizens, and thus more likely to affiliate with Conservative Judaism as a convenient compromise between the competing loyalties of ethnic and national identity."89 Second, Zionism in its varied manifestations had emerged as a unifying glue across a broad Jewish constituency. By endorsing Zionism, Schechter and Conservative Judaism appealed to a more diverse cross section of American Jewry. These important differences notwithstanding, Kohut's and Schechter's respective conceptualizations of Conservative Judaism differed in a crucial way. Schechter envisioned Conservative Judaism as a means of unifying American 87. Solomon Schechter, "The Beginnings of Jewish Wissenschaft," in Seminary Addresses and Other Papers (Burning Bush Press, 1959), 177-78. 88. Indeed, just as Kohut's religious outlook was shaped by his experiences in Hungary, Schechter's notion of Catholic Israel was a reflection of his childhood home in Focsani, Romania. See Howard Lupovitch, "Searching for Catholic Israel in Focsani: Solomon Schehcter's Childhood in Romania," Studies in Jewish Civilization 16 (2005): 313ff. 89. David Weinberg, "The Jewish Theological Seminary and the 'Downtown' Jews of New York at the Turn of the Century," in Wertheimer, Tradition Renewed, 2:6. 76</page><page sequence="29">Navigating Rough Waters Jewry under the banner of a single movement and its institutions; his middle ground was a middle-ground movement. Kohut, by contrast, envisioned Conser vative Judaism as he had envisioned Status Quo: as a way to unify Jews by restor ing a pre-nineteenth-cenrury sense of unity?that is, by eliminating religious movements entirely within Judaism. In an age of religious movements, Kohut's attempt to impose unity by paring away affiliation to a particular movement was, in retrospect, hopelessly out of sync with the age. This was the actual nature of his conservatism. As a leader of the Status Quo movement and, later, as a founder of the Conservative movement, Kohut called for a return to an earlier pre-schismatic period. Kohut's views resembled Orthodoxy and Reform far less than they resemble the fluid traditionalism of an earlier age. In its deemphasis of ideology in favor of a greater emphasis on a religious unity, diversity, and inclusiveness Kohut's religious outlook was conservative not only with respect to Reform Judaism but also with respect to Orthodox Judaism. Yet amid their widely dissimilar success in attracting a broad following, it should not be forgotten that Kohut and Schechter shared the view that theirs was the most authentic form of Judaism. The parallels between Kohut and Schech ter suggest that it was not Kohut's Hungarian roots per se that infused this conser vative mentality into Conservative Judaism but a broader middle ground current within European Jewry. This current found its clearest expression within the non-German elements of European Jewry, suggesting that Conservative Judaism has eclectic European roots that have yet to be fully explored. Indeed, the founders of Conservative Judaism were not of German Jewish origin. Kohut and Benjamin Szold were Hungarian, Sabato Mor?is was Italian, Marcus Jastrow was from Poland, and Schechter was Rumanian.90 Even Frankel, although he spent much of his rabbinic career serving several German Jewish communities, had been born in Prague and educated in Pest; arguably, he was only partially a product of a German Jewish milieu.91 In this more eclectic comparative framework, Kohut is still a key link between Conservative Judaism and its European roots. It is simply necessary to attach the European side of the link outside of German Jewry. In the end, Kohut's aim of unity was realized, at least partially, in the wide spread camaraderie he had with a diverse array of religious thinkers in Europe and America. After his death, Kaufman K?hler, his arch-polemical rival, paid him perhaps the most fitting tribute: This is what Alexander Kohut's life meant to us. He navigated Jewish scholar ship on a sea of Talmud, washing up on every land where Jews live, absorbing in its bosom the currents of the age. Early on he ventured out like a hardy seaman in a self-made vessel to discover untested waters and unknown terri tories, to retrieve pearls of wisdom from the deep. And to this great end he 90. This was noted by Diner, "Like the Antelope and the Badger," 4; see also Lupovitch, "Searching for Catholic Israel in Focsani," 315-16. 91.

The young Israel, the American Israel, did not sense the gleaming life of our father, the citadel of the Talmud.... Neither did the Hungarian Communities, on which Dr. Kohut stood at its peak, take pride in such a possession.92 How ironic perhaps that K?hler, a proponent of a radically religious and exclusi vist outlook, would capture Kohut's role as a link between a moderate European traditionalism and Conservative Judaism?its American counterpart and progeny.
