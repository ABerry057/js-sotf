<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Joshua J. Schwartz. Lod (Lydda), Israel: From its Origins Through the Byzantine Period, 5600 B.C.E.-640 C.E. British Archaeological Reports, International Series 571. Oxford: Tempus Reparatum, 1991. 212 pp. Joshua J. Schwartz's study of Lod is a welcome addition to the literature on the historical geography of ancient Israel. The book is divided into three parts. The first (pp. 15-36) contains three chapters dealing with "sources, geography and boundaries." The second part (pp. 39-135) contains seven chapters tracing the history of the city in chronological sequence. The third and final part (pp. 139-185) contains a chapter on the morphology of ancient Lod and one on the economy of the city and its hinterland. This shifting between a topical and a chronological organization results in some repetition, but on balance the use of both approaches is beneficial. Fifteen maps, sixteen photographs, a bibliography, and an index complete the book. Clearly the heart of the study is the historical survey. And while attention is given to the entire span of Lod's existence, beginning in the mid-sixth millennium B.C.E., 90 percent of the survey is devoted to the period 332 B.C.E.-640 C.E. In other words, Schwartz concentrates on the period when Israel was part of the Greco-Roman world. The choice of Lod as a subject may at first seem surprising. It was not as large or as important as Sepphoris or Tiberias, neither of which has received detailed monographic study. Nor has it yielded a body of archaeological evidence comparable to what has been uncovered at the latter sites. However, in the context of Jewish history, a case can be made that Lod was a major town. In fact, one of Schwartz's important suggestions is that Lod, rather than Yavneh, was the center of Jewish life in post-70 Iudaea (see chap. 8). Conversely, one suspects that the relative abundance of rabbinic sources on Lod contributed to the decision to write about this city. The fact that the longest of the historical chapters (chap. 8) is on the shortest period (65 years) is best explained by the availability of so much relevant rabbinic material. Schwartz does an excellent job of assembling all the available archaeolog- ical and epigraphic evidence-from nineteenth-century publications, reports buried in the archives of Israel's Antiquities Authority, and recent discoveries 279</page><page sequence="2">280 BOOK REVIEWS not yet published. A good example is the special appendix on the site of Modiin and the Hasmonean tombs (pp. 61-65). His use of the literary sources is based on sound methodological principles. He is careful to distinguish between sources actually from a period and sources about a period but themselves later (e.g., p. 49). He is aware that later sources may be anachronistic or inaccurate with respect to an earlier period (e.g., pp. 39, 73, 96). Similarly, he illustrates how fluid text traditions on toponyms, compounded by disagreement over the identification of the latter, limit or even negate the usefulness of many literary sources (e.g., p. 91, n. 11). Unfortunately, Schwartz is not always consistent in his critical caution. He correctly observes that it is "unlikely that a late Byzantine midrash should relate to the tannaitic period" (p. 97, n. 96). Yet in the same chapter he cites Byzantine midrashim as evidence for precisely that period (see p. 95, n. 61, and p. 96, n. 82). Similarly, Schwartz expresses surprise that a "rich Syrian matron" displayed interest in and knowledge of the Bible in a conversation with the tannaitic master Eliezer son of Hyrcanus, as recorded in the Palestinian Talmud (p. 87). In view of the stock narrative theme in rabbinic literature which has pagans such as Alexander the Great, Roman emperors, and Roman matrons evince similar interest and knowledge, the surprise is that a source like this is considered evidence for the life of Eliezer. In fact, there is a tendency in the book to treat the anecdotes in the rabbinic sources as historical. Not everyone who works with these materials agrees with this approach. Other criticisms are of secondary importance. For example, why begin the Roman period in 37 B.C.E. rather than in the more commonly used 63 B.C.E.? And what would Romanists make of Schwartz's unequal subdivision of this era, especially his calling 70-135 "the middle Roman period"? Why not admit that the chronology reflects Jewish historiography and use the fairly common "period between the revolts"? More maps would have been helpful, especially a more detailed topographical map and ones showing the suggested boundaries of the toparchy of Lod. Also a desideratum is more consistency in the forms of place names between text and map, and among maps, though most readers will probably figure out the identity of Kefar Kesem and Kafr Kasm, or of Jimzu, Gimzo, and Gamzo. Even if one disagrees over the interpretation of the rabbinic materials, Schwartz's work illuminates many issues in the historical geography of ancient Israel, ancient urbanism, and Jewish history. Among his original conclusions, the following are of note. Schwartz argues that Lod was part of the territories</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 281 given to the king of Sidon by the Persians according to the Eshmunazzar inscription. Consequently, it was not part of any Persian province, neither Samaria, Yehud, nor Ashdod (see pp. 44-45). He suggests that the rabbinic traditions on Ben Stada/Stara are polemical accounts reflecting the activities of Peter in Lod (pp. 67-71). And he suggests that the Roman colonia of Diospolis was established north of the "old city" of Lod. In part because of this location the new foundation never really developed into an urban center (pp. 142-144). In sum, Schwartz is to be congratulated on his valuable contribution to Land of Israel scholarship. David Goodblatt University of California at San Diego La Jolla, Calif.</page></plain_text>
