The Emergence of Hasidic Politics in Congress Poland by Marcin Wodzi?ski The various efforts to reform Jewish society in Poland from the late eight eenth century on elicited reactions among the representatives of Jewish society, both among those who supported the reforms and among others, much more numerous, who were less favorably inclined toward reform. The hasidim were, of course, among the latter. All the reforms affected the hasidim, just as they did other members of the community; but certain actions directed against their movement as such affected them specifically. It seems natural, therefore, that hasidim were not simply passive victims of the deeds undertaken by the central and regional organs of the state. It would be hard to expect otherwise because, after all, the hasidim were a party most interested in the favorable resolution of antihasidic government investigations. Furthermore, what for the government was only one of society's problems (and a marginal one at that), and for the maskilim was an important but not a key problem, was for the hasidim a cardinal question, a matter of the very exist ence of Polish Hasidism. From the beginning of the government's interest in this movement, we witness petitions written by hasidim to officials at all levels of the state administration, attempts to gain powerful allies, and both open and behind the-scenes actions to attain the most advantageous decisions possible for the movement. A relatively large number of hasidic leaders were engaged in this type of shtadlanut (representation of the Jewish community or communities before the state and local authorities), and hasidic literature is full of stories of the intercession of zaddikim in defense of the Jewish people. However, if we lay aside the traditional hasidic stories?such as the soup spilled by the zaddik Elimelekh of Lezajsk (Lizhensk)1 so that Emperor Joseph II would not sign an anti-Jewish decree?there remains a range of questions about the beginnings of hasidic political activity and about the propriety of that activity. To be sure, the political history of Hasidism has more than once been the subject of study, but the interest of researchers has focused primarily on two 1.

The first is the contemporary political movements representing the many factions within Hasidism, and often other Orthodox groups, as well as their contemporary continuation in the politics of Israel. Of special interest are the studies of the political activities of the best known of the ultra-Orthodox pol itical parties, Agudes Yisroel and Makhzikey Hadas.2 As a rule, these studies describe political actions at the end of the nineteenth century and during the first half of the twentieth century, the era of mass politics and modern political movements. The theoretical basis of such an approach is a conception of the devel opment of eastern European Jewish society as comprising three stages, from a tra ditional society through a period of liberal progressivism to a phase of postliberal mass politics.3 Such a dialectical schema treats, of course, only the last phase in full and so directs its attention only to this later period. A second common area of research describes the political activity of hasidic leaders during the premodern period and the nineteenth century, focusing, for example, on the controversy, known in hasidic literature, over the role of Napoleon and the engagement of some of the zaddikim on either side,4 or the later interces sion of Polish zaddikim with Moses Montefiore,5 or the influence of the zaddik Menahem Mendel Schneerson at the meetings of the Rabbinical Commission in 1843.6 These are only a few examples of many. The drawback of many of these 2. On Agudes Yisroel, see Gershon Bacon, The Politics of Tradition. Agudat Yisrael in Poland, 1916-1939 (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1996).

This perspective corresponds to both the dominant trend in the historio graphy of Hasidism, which is interested above all in the zaddikim (the result of a specific paradigm of the history of Hasidism as the story of its leaders), and the general tendency of political historiography, which understands politics as an elite undertaking of a select group of leaders. Such a perspective, however, seems especially insufficient today as we increasingly understand Hasidism as a mass movement encompassing forms of activity that transcended the hasidic court. Therefore, in the sketch presented here, I propose to examine hasidic engagement in political activity with regard to the tension between the politics of hasidic leaders and the legitimization of this activity by the broader hasidic community. My hope is that such an approach will allow us to better grasp the complex, multifaceted nature of this phenomenon. The questions that seem most important in this context are the following: Why and under what circum stances did hasidic political activity develop? How did the representatives of Hasidism react to political challenges? How did their reactions evolve? How did their reactions differ from those of nonhasidic traditional Jews? And most importantly, how and in what way did political involvement change the hasidic movement?organizationally, ideologically, and in terms of its self-perception? One should note that the political world of nineteenth-century Europe, even at its eastern reaches, differed fundamentally from premodern politics as practiced in the early modern Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In the nineteenth century, political mechanisms were subordinated to the criteria that Max Weber recognized as the fundamental factors in modernization: bureaucratization, the universalization of law and administrative procedures, the professionalization of administrative services, the written nature of all procedures, depersonalization, on hasidic historiography (mainly generated by the Schneersohns) and its characteristics, see Ada Rapoport-Albert, "Hagiography with Footnotes: Edifying Tales and the Writing of History in Hasid ism," in Essays in Jewish Historiography, ed. Ada Rapoport-Albert (Ottawa: Scholars Press, 1991), 119-59. 7. The most notorious is the equating of Jewish political activity with bribery; see Levine, "'Should Napoleon Be Victorious...,'" 14. 8. Still worse is when historians use a narrative of their own design to impress their own ideo logical and political vision on others. Raphael Mahler proved a master of this technique. His vision of "hasidic leadership of Jewish passive resistance," inspired both by Zionism and by Marxist ideology, still remains surprisingly influential today. See Mahler's Hasidism and the Jewish Enlightenment: Their Confrontation in Galicia and Poland in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century, Yiddish trans. E. Orenstein, Hebrew trans. A. Klein and J. Machlowitz Klein (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1985). 223</page><page sequence="4">Marcin Wodzi?ski the increased role of the state in regulating and coordinating relations between groups and individuals, and the broadening of the categories of citizenship and civil rights (though, under eastern European conditions, limited).9 Under such conditions, those interested in politics were, whether willing or unwilling, forced to seek contemporary political tools and begin to apply them; this in itself indicated a certain form of modernization. For antimodernist social groups, this process of applying elements of modernity in order to preserve their antimodernist character was known as "defensive modernization."10 What did this process look like for hasidim? In this essay, I try to answer the some of the questions I have posed with reference to the example of the Congress Kingdom, primarily on the basis of archi val material. I do not want to claim that the example of the Congress Kingdom is a universal model illustrating the development of hasidic political activity in all regions of eastern Europe. Certainly this process played out somewhat differently, perhaps even entirely differently, in Galicia, Ukraine, and Lithuania. Precisely for that reason, it seems necessary to focus my study?which is based on local archi val sources rather than hagiographie hasidic literature?not on all of eastern Europe but only on one political region and its local social, political, and legal con texts. It is true that archival sources are usually less impressive than hasidic stories and often present only a fragmentary picture, especially for earlier periods. Still, archival material offers some important advantages. Contemporary with the events under investigation and generated without the intention of telling a story, archival sources allow for narratives that are less vulnerable to distortion of the source author's intentions and anachronisms. Moreover, the shift from a general eastern European perspective to a sharp focus on a single political entity, the emphasis on the close ties between Jewish political activity and the local non Jewish context, and the extensive use of archival material are all of programmatic significance. BEGINNINGS: BEREK SONNENBERG AND HlS CIRCLE Until the beginning of the nineteenth century, the actions initiated by hasidic leaders had an episodic character, and the reliability of many testimonies describ ing these actions is questionable. Such is the case with stories of the appearance of R. Levi Isaac of Berdycz?w (Berdichev) during the Four-Year Sejm in Warsaw (1788-92) and the meetings held on common hasidic politics during this time.11 9. Max Weber, On Law, Economy and Society, ed.

The information, besides hasidic sources, emerges from a remark by Menahem Mendel Lefin 224</page><page sequence="5">How Modern is an Antimodernist Movement? Even if we accept that the hasidic tradition preserved a trace of the reality of events (and this seems to be a reasonable judgment), we can fairly suspect that the telling of the story fifty years later included a projection of the anachronistic political imagination of the author on the meaning of earlier events. This, as is known, is the general problem of the credibility of hasidic (or any other traditional) litera ture.12 This does not mean, of course, that stories of political acts from the earlier period are not credible at all. Some of them, such as the political aspects of the well-known conflict between hasidim and their opponents in Vilna at the turn of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, have been well documented by independent sources and are described in the literature on the subject.13 It also seems that certain hasidic?and not only hasidic?leaders simply had natural pol itical talents and in their political activity were ahead of their time. Certainly this was the case with R. Shneur Zalman of Lady (Liadi) and, among zaddikim active in central Poland, R. Levi Isaac from Zelech?w (known better as the zaddik from Berdycz?w/Berdichev). Characteristically, though, even in the case of the most engaged hasidic pol itical leaders, the nature of their political activities shows that they viewed politics in a strictly theological (and occasionally messianic) sense, much as normative rabbinical Jewish culture had viewed politics since the early medieval period. The clearest examples of this are the pronouncements of zaddik Pinhas of Korzec (Korets) on political topics, such as the theological role of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth in the history of the Jewish Diaspora, and the later conflict among zaddikim on the role and meaning of the Napoleonic Wars, as well as the pronouncements of the best politician among zaddikim of this mentioning a hasidic leader who had arrived in Warsaw from Ukraine; see Lefm, "Essai d'un plan de r?forme ayant pour objet d'?clairer la nation Juive en Pologne et de redresser par l? ses moeurs," in Materialy do dziej?w Sejmu Czteroletniego, ed.

Of course, neither a lack of originality nor the theological views of politics ever stemmed practical work in the political arena. In early Hasidism, however, the issue was not only the lack of originality in a more general philosophy of politics but also a lack of clear goals?and even imagination?concerning the eventual role of politics. It seems understandable that, until Hasidism grew to become a social phenomenon, the political involve ment of its representatives could have had only an accidental and amorphous char acter. One should not expect an organized form of hasidic political activity and hasidic political reflection during a period when this movement still had not com pleted its transformation from an elite pietistic formation to a mass social movement. When did this transition occur? Archival material from Polish archives shows that this transformation did not take place in central Poland until the second decade of the nineteenth century. It is during this same time that we find the first clear traces of hasidic political activity in this territory. Beginning from the first investigation in 1817, the provincial and, soon after, central administrative institutions of government interested themselves in the conflicts that were then breaking out among hasidic groups in the cities of central Poland.15 A quickly growing number of reports of different types of conflicts among the "michalki," "kitajowcy," or "Hussites" (the different names applied to Hasidism further dee pened the chaos and loss of governmental administration) reached the local and provincial state authorities.16 The conflicts most often concerned the right of hasidim to create their own prayer halls, but they also concerned the paying of community taxes, the use of the ritual bath, spending on the renovation of the synagogue, the rights of the ritual slaughterer, and so on. Already in 1818, the Government Commission for Religious Denominations and Public Enlightenment 14.

Dresner (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1985), 40-43. For an analysis of the hasidic political manifes tations from the Napoleonic period, see Levine, '"Should Napoleon Be Victorious...'" 15. For more on the most important government investigations in the matter of Hasidism, see my essay "Rzad Kr?lestwa Polskiego wobec chasydyzmu: Poczatid 'polityki chasydzkiej' w Kr?lest wie Kongresowym (1817-1818)," in Zydzi i judaizm we wsp?lczesnych badaniach polskich, ed. Krzysztof Pilarczyk (Krakow: Wydawnictwo Antykwa, 2003), 3:65-77. 16. It should be noted, however, that term "Hussite" had nothing to do with any supposed analogy to Protestant Christianity. In central Poland, the a sound of kamats gadol was pronounced in both Yiddish and Hebrew as u, whereas consonants in final sounds became voiceless, hence khusit or khusyt instead of hasid in contemporary standard Hebrew or khosid in YIVO standard Yiddish. Because the Polish language lost phonematical opposition between voiced kh and voiceless h and eventually lost voiced kh altogether, for the Polish-speaking interlocutor, the Yiddish (or Hebrew) word khusitlkhusyt was identical with the Polish husyt (Hussite). The form was frequently recorded in Polish literature in the nineteenth century, and today this is the most common name for hasidim in Polish folk culture. See Maria Brzezina, Polszczyzna Zyd?w (Warsaw: Pa?stwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, 1986), 72, 336; Alina Cala, Wizerunek Zyda w polskiej kulturze ludowej (Warsaw: Uniwersytet Warszawski, Instytut Socjologii, 1988), 18, 25, 36, 45, 56-57, 59, 68-72 (an English translation of the book loses this linguistic feature; see Cala, The Image of the Jew in Polish Folk Culture [Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1995], passim). 226</page><page sequence="7">How Modern is an Antimodernist Movement? (i.e., the Ministry of Religions and Education) decided to learn more about Hasid ism and to regulate such matters on a national level.17 This decision led to the first organized activity among representatives of the hasidim in central Poland. One incident began with the closing of the hasidic prayer hall in Plock. How the Plock police found out about the existence of the shtibl (hasidic prayer hall) is not known; also unknown are the reasons for the decision to close the prayer hall. Three days later, ten hasidim appealed to the Provincial Commission "in every one's name," asking for the withdrawal of the decision. As a result of hasidic inter vention in the matter, the Government Commission for Religious Denominations and Public Enlightenment and, soon after, the viceroy of the Congress Kingdom, General J?zef Zajaczek, became interested in the matter. The appeal was accompanied by a petition action to the president of the Provincial Commission and, it seems, by mass corruption, a typical instrument of Jewish?and not only Jewish?politics in eastern Europe. As Florian Kobyli?ski, president of the Pro vincial Commission, wrote, "in spite of all kinds of government bans," the kita jowcy were able to maintain an active shtibl in many locations throughout the province "by paying off lower police officials."18 In the end, after obtaining numerous opinions (among them those of the maskilim Abraham Stern and Yekhezkel/Stanislaw Hoge), Viceroy Zajaczek and the Administrative Council (i.e., the central government) recognized the right of hasidim throughout the entire country to assemble for prayer and banned persecution of the hasidim, citing constitutional "liberty and freedom for all faiths." This investigation concluded with a complete victory for the hasidim. Subsequent government actions and hasidic involvement in further investi gations in 1820, 1822, and 1823-24 were very similar. The most typical examples are a series of formal petitions for the withdrawal of a decision delegalizing the hasidic prayer halls in 1824 and a successful attempt to influence Viceroy Zajac zek in the same matter. In spite of these undoubted successes, the activity of hasidic politicians was of an exclusively defensive character, both at the level of state politics and at the community or provincial level. There was only one known attempt during this time of a conscious effort by hasidim to compel the non-Jewish city authorities in Cz?stochowa to force concessions on the nonhasidic majority, an example of offensive, not defensive, political activity. In 1820, hasidim in Cz?stochowa turned to the mayor for help in gaining access to the ritual bath, which had been denied to them by the board of the kahal elders and the nonhasidic majority. 17. The investigation in Plock has been analyzed in my Haskalah and Hasidism in the Kingdom of Poland: A History of Conflict, trans. Sarah Cozens (Oxford, UK, and Portland, OR: Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 2005), 88-90; the most extensive description can be found in my "Rzad Kr?lestwa Polskiego wobec chasydyzmu," 69-77.

The hasidim then turned to the Provincial Commis sion for help. Finally, however, the two sides came to an understanding without the mediation of the state authorities, and from the course of events, it turns out that this was the intention of the hasidim from the beginning. The hasidim limited the involvement of non-Jewish authorities to a minimum and hesitated to pull them into an internal Jewish conflict. Moreover, the intervention of the mayor and the president of the Provincial Commission came only in an extreme, atypical situation, such as the refusal by the kahal and the burial society it controlled to bury a hasidic child.19 Therefore, in spite of this singular "offensive" action, we can call the first stage of hasidic politics "reactive" and describe it characteristically as defensive. This activity seems somehow forced, a counter reaction to the actions of the government or competing forces within Jewish society; there appear to be no traces of coordination or long-term strategy, which does not mean that hasidic actions were ill prepared or ineffective. Rather, it seems they were simply undertaken reluctantly. Interestingly, if the archival sources are to be believed, the people involved in this activity were not the most well-known hasidic leaders of this period (such as Simha Bunim of Przysucha [Pshiskheh], a grain merchant and druggist), who, it is known from other sources, were otherwise well oriented in the pedestrian matters of real life.20 The individuals who undertook this singular activity had a certain political experience resulting from their professional contacts with the Polish gov ernment and Polish law. Most evident was a group concentrated around Berek Sonnenberg, the richest Polish Jew and a known protector of Hasidism. In addition to Berek Sonnenberg, there was also his wife Temerl, their son Jakub, follower of the Przysucha school of Hasidism Alexander Zusya Kahana, and the rich entrepre neurs Abraham Kamienicer and Hersz Stamm.21 Berek Sonnenberg, his family, and the many people associated with him participated in numerous negotiations with the government during the period of Prussian rule and the Duchy of Warsaw (1795-1815). As a result, they not only took advantage of useful contacts with representatives of Polish authority but also acquired the ability to act in a formal ized and bureaucratic administrative system. Examples of the surprising effective ness of this activity include the negotiations of Berek Sonnenberg in the matter of 19.

Isaac of Warka (Vorke), a rabbi in Siedlce in 1826 and in Plock in 1829.23 Kahana's first known intervention in politics occurred in 1824, when he was a young twenty-nine-year-old without any formal position. It is not clear whether Kahana acted then as an agent of Simha Bunim; his ties with the Sonnenberg family suggest that the political interests of Kahana could have developed without the influence of his spiritual patron. For the next ten years, Kahana was the most active hasidic shtadlan in Congress Poland. It appears that in 1829, R. Isaac of Warka, who would later become one of the most influential of the hasidic leaders in Poland, recognized the superior quality of Alexander Kahana's mediation and requested that he intercede on behalf of the imprisoned Jews of Zambr?w.24 The fact that this activity was strictly defensive and that the individuals engaged in it were not representative authorities of the hasidic movement played a big part in creating the image of Hasidism as an antimodern movement. The most important hasidic leaders were not engaged in this type of activity, not only because they did not have the proper preparation but also because they viewed themselves?and were viewed as?spiritual rather than political leaders. Simply, nobody expected them to be involved in politics. In turn, the fact that the political activists were not universally recognized representatives of the hasidic community and that, more than once, their position within Hasidism was controversial (as in the case of Berek Sonnenberg), allowed them to operate outside the sphere of activity that was recognized as normative for Hasid ism. Hasidim experienced politics as an external phenomenon, foreign to their world, and so categorized it as such.25 This all meant that the political involvement of hasidim during this period was low. This type of activity occurred most often at the community, or kahal, level. The hasidim defended themselves against accusations brought forth against them by the kahal or, sometimes, appealed to non-Jewish authorities for help in conflicts with the nonhasidic majority; the hasidim, however, did not 22.

Even when a central investigation took place in Warsaw in 1818, the lasting traces of hasidic involve ment were modest enough, limited to appeals to provincial commissions for the opening of their shtiblekh, petition actions, and local corruption. Hasidism had not yet matured enough socially to undertake political initiatives independently on a larger scale, even in matters related exclusively to hasidic society. It is possible to say that the degree of hasidic involvement in politics was in a certain sense proportional to the recognition of the political significance of Hasid ism and the involvement in such matters by the central powers of the Congress Kingdom. Above all, the authorities of the Congress Kingdom viewed these matters as singular incidents of local significance, without ties to the general poli tics of the "Jewish question." Even the alarmist report of the known maskil and antihasidic critic Abraham Stern and the then-popular antihasidic story of the Polish Enlightenment writer Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz did not change this general attitude.26 Moreover, as was eventually learned, Viceroy Zajaczek and the Admin istrative Council did not share Stern's and Niemcewicz's negative views of the shtibl, while Stanislaw Staszic, the minister who was most critical of the hasidim, managed in a short time to come out with completely contradictory decisions (a tendency of his), so it is difficult to speak of any consequences of his political views. In essence, the decisions of the Administrative Council and viceroy from 1818, along with the formal decrees and directives from the ministries, provincial commissions, and local authorities from 1817 to 1822, were very chaotic; they did not have an influence on the further politics of the government in this matter, nor did they play an essential role in the internal events of this movement in Congress Poland. Several factors account for this: (1) a lack of inherited legislation in this area to which the administration of the Congress Kingdom could appeal;27 (2) an inertia and lack of desire to take on new issues, typical of all administrations; (3) stereotypical and schematic thinking on the "Jewish question" in categories that did not reflect internal Jewish religious divisions; (4) a general ignorance of Jewish issues and an unwillingness to deepen knowledge in this area; (5) a lack of knowledge of other investigations and decisions in matters related to Hasidism, and so a lack of awareness of the general scale of the phenomenon (this was, of course, a result of the beneficial imperfections of the state administration); and (6), as in similar matters, an unwillingness on the part of Jewish society to disclose 26. See Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, Lejbe i Si?ra czyli Listy dw?ch kochank?w, vols. 1-2 (Wars zawa, 1821). Stern's report has been published more than once; see Raphael Mahler, Hahasidut vehahaskalah (begaliziyah uvepolin hakongresa'it bamahazit harishonah shel hame'ah hatesha-'esrei, hayesodot hasoziyaliyim vehamediniyim) (Merhavia: Sifriat Poalim, 1961), 477-81, English translation in my Haskalah and Hasidism in the Kingdom of Poland, 260-63. 27.

OFFENSIVE: R. MEIR ROTENBERG OF OPAT?W (APT) Qualitative changes in hasidic political activity in the Congress Kingdom appeared in the mid-1820s. The reasons for this included, on one hand, the growing interest of the Polish government in Hasidism and the numerous antiha sidic investigations at this time and, on the other hand, several spectacular political successes that were a result of these investigations. It is hard, then, to overestimate the significance of the success of the hasidim in the investigations into hasidic matters that the Polish government conducted from 1823 to 1824.29 After learning from the head of the gendarmerie in Parczew that the local group of "Hussites" had illegally, in his opinion, gathered for prayer in private homes, Viceroy Zaj^czek recommended to the Government Commission for Internal Affairs and Police an investigation into the entire affair. Shortly after, on the basis of ministry reports and the opinion of Abraham Stern, the viceroy banned gatherings of hasidim for prayer in private halls, along with pilgrimages to hasidic leaders and the making of "appointments" (literally, zjazdy\ most likely, hasidic gather ings) in their homes. This called forth the reaction of the hasidim. After a series of formal peti tions from Alexander Zusya Kahana and Abraham Kamienicer, the viceroy again ordered an examination into the question of the supposed "harmfulness" of this movement. To achieve this goal, a deputation, again under the direction of Stanislaw Staszic, was established; this deputation called for the interrogation of five hasidic personalities, of whom only one appeared for questioning, R. Meir Rotenberg of Opat?w (Apt). Accompanying him, however, were several rich and influential protectors of Hasidism: the aforementioned Abraham Kamie nicer, the entrepreneur Hersz Stamm (connected to the Bereksohn family), and Jakub Bereksohn, the son of Berek Sonnenberg. Under the influence of the explanations put forth by these men, the deputa tion recognized that "there was not the least need" to persecute hasidim,30 and Zaj^czek decided that "the Jewish sect of hasidim, or Kitajowc?w, did not hold 28. On the Jewish regulations forbidding suing a Jew in a non-Jewish court, see Lederhendler, The Road to Modern Jewish Politics, 12-14. 29. This investigation has been described in the literature more than once; of the most important publications on the subject, see Mahler, Hasidism and the Jewish Enlightenment, 317-37. The most comprehensive description is included in my "Sprawa chasydym?w. Z material?w do dziej?w chasy dyzmu w Kr?lestwie Polskim," in Z historii ludnosci zydowskiej w Polsce i na Slqsku, ed.

The regulations that were accepted not only revoked the decree outlawing the movement and exposing it to legal persecution but also gave the hasidim full liberty of assembly and essentially put them in a more ben eficial position vis-?-vis other Jews. Moreover, representatives of Hasidism not only initiated a renewal of these investigations, they also actively participated in the process of influencing opinions of the deputation led by Staszic that were favorable to them. This must have encouraged them to undertake more important, independent activity in the future, and this soon occurred. The first action under taken after the investigation of 1823-24 featured so many new characteristics that it is fair to describe it as a model for the next phase of "hasidic politics." In November 1824, zaddik Meir Rotenberg of Opat?w (Apt) sent to the Government Commission for Internal Affairs and Police an accusation that the local police had harassed the hasidim and obstructed their peaceful religious assembly. In the same letter, he also demanded an immediate implementation of the aforementioned decision to fully legalize the hasidic shtiblekh.32 Staszic, in the name of the Government Commission for Internal Affairs and Police, sent the complaint to the Government Commission for Religious Denominations and Public Enlightenment for further consideration. This body, in turn, refused to take any action and informed the Government Commission for Internal Affairs and Police that the accusation was removed from questions of religious freedom but instead concerned police order. In the end, the Government Commission for Internal Affairs and Police decided to investigate the matter. R. Meir, interrogated in Opat?w by the district commissar, denied author ship of the petition. As he stated, he had never accused the local police or anybody else, but, disturbed by the fact that Viceroy Zajaczek's decision to allow hasidim separate religious services had not yet reached Opat?w, he had written "to the Bereksohn family, to Warsaw, in order for them to hurry and send such an order, and to make sure there were no obstacles in sending it."33 In accordance with this request, Jakub Bereksohn had sent the Government Com mission for Internal Affairs and Police an appropriate note, but, through a misun derstanding, he had included in it complaints about the actions of the Opat?w gendarmerie and its commander. As is easy to understand, the unfounded charge could have caused R. Meir trouble with the local police and could even have had negative administrative con sequences. R. Meir consequently denied any kind of connection with the charge 31. AGAD, CWW, 1871, p. 213; AGAD, KRSW, 6635, folio 6. 32. R. Meir's petition has not been preserved; its content is known to us thanks to the official correspondence it engendered. See AGAD, KRSW, 6635, folio 9-22; CWW, 1871, pp. 214-18. Some documents related to R. Meir's intervention have been published in Mahler, Hahasidut vehahaskalah, 492-501. Unfortunately, Mahler's reconstruction of the events is incomplete and biased. For another view of R. Meir's activities and contacts with the government, see Dynner, "Men of Silk," 79-81, 112-13. 33. AGAD, KRSW, 6635, folio 18-22. 232</page><page sequence="13">How Modern is an Antimodernist Movement? and even stressed that, during the examination, the gendarmerie had admitted "no indecency or perversion, but behaved, of course, quietly, calmly, and properly."34 The report of the district commissar is cut off in the source, but if its conclusions were accepted (and this seems probable), R. Meir achieved complete success. His explanation in the matter of the unfounded charge of the gendarmerie was accepted and, at the same time, the police denied any kind of harassment of? or even interest in?the hasidim, confirming in this way the hasidim's right to free assembly.35 Several particulars in the intervention of R. Meir deserve mention. The first new characteristic feature was that this was the first hasidic initiative in the Con gress Kingdom in which a representative of Hasidism made contact with the auth orities and took the initiative to get state institutions to change the legal regulations and behavior of the state administration. It is thus possible to speak of a change from a defensive to an offensive phase in the practice of politics. Although politi cal activity of a defensive character did not later disappear (moreover, the differ ence between defense and offense was sometimes not entirely clear), from the mid-1820s on, the same hasidim increasingly initiated more investigations. A good example of this is the intervention of the hasidic leader from Wloclawek, Meir Rypi?ski. In 1827, he wrote a series of petitions to the provincial and central Polish authorities to confirm the right to free assembly for prayers in shti blekh and to introduce additional advantageous regulations.36 Similarly, in the years 1835^43, the collective action of hasidim in B?dzin (Bendin) against local rabbi informer Abraham Hersz Rozynes turned out to be equally effective (strangely, Rozynes was successfully dismissed in spite of the support granted him by the secret police and military authorities), as was the later hasidic campaign favoring a change in election ordinances for the board of the Jewish community in Warsaw.37 The second characteristic feature of this new phase of "hasidic politics" was better coordination and a better long-term plan of activity, thus introducing stra tegic actions and the conscious use of all available political means to reach specific goals. The details of the intervention of R. Meir of Opat?w are not particularly evident, even more so because R. Meir and Jakub Bereksohn attempted to cover up the traces of their actions. Nonetheless, success in avoiding responsibility for charging local police falsely, the effective manipulation of responsible 34. Ibid. 35. Ibid., folio 16-17. 36. AGAD, CWW, 1411, pp. 66-81; AGAD, Komisja Wojew?dztwa Kaliskiego, 702, p. 171. The regulation in the matter of shtiblekh, issued in 1827, turned out to be the essential regulation in the matter, remaining valid until the end of the Congress Kingdom. 37. On the Rozynes affair and consecutive attempts by the hasidim to dismiss him from the rab binical office, see AGAD, CWW, 1481, pp. 6-307, 347^18; AGAD, CWW, 1474, pp. 40-326; AGAD, CWW, 1445, pp. 223-32.

Isaac of Warka. To this we will return in a moment. The third equally striking characteristic of hasidic politics of this phase, rep resented by the intervention of R. Meir from 1824 to 1825, was the fact that the zaddik alone, not just one of his representatives, appeared officially in the role of shtadlan, though, to be sure, R. Meir benefited in this matter from the help and mediation of Jakub Bereksohn. The testimonies of R. Meir confirm that Bereksohn lent his name even without previous consultation, though, given their close cooperation, it is difficult to believe this.38 Moreover, during this same period, there appeared other petitions written in the name of the zaddikim, which should lead us to believe that the name of R. Meir on a letter to the Govern ment Commission was not a mistake.39 In my opinion, the zaddik's role as the author of the intervention signals a more general change in the relationship to political activity. Throughout eastern Europe in the first half of the nineteenth century, there was a marked tendency toward rabbinical acceptance of political functions or, as Eli Lederhendler has said, toward the creation of a "rabbinical shadow government."40 Among politi cally engaged "rabbis" (Lederhendler placed all religious authorities in this category) were, of course, the hasidic leaders?for example, Israel of R?zyn (Ruzhin), Menahem Mendel Schneersohn of Lubawicz (Lubavich), and Isaac of Warka. When R. Meir of Opat?w was asked by the district commissar from Olkusz, J. Pomianowski, about the basis for his "title of superior of the hasidim," he responded that he based his right to appear in the group's name on his "being of this sect and by its principles honored?I am universally regarded by them as superior."41 As for all of the Jewish community, so, too, for hasidim, the appearance of politically engaged religious leaders caused an essential ideological change. The zaddik, signing his name on the petition to the Government Commission, appeared not only in a spiritual position but also as the earthly political protector of his hasidim. He then received a new role, accepting?or generating?a cardinal change in the very image of Polish Hasidism. R. Meir accepted the image of the zaddik as a political leader and the image of Hasidism as a movement of a certain political distinctiveness and so, in certain aspects, a modern phenomenon. Of course, this does not mean that the rank-and-file representatives of the move ment began from 1825 to understand contemporary politics and to see themselves 38. During another interrogation run by Stanislaw Staszic in 1824, Jakub Bereksohn served as an interpreter for R. Meir of Opat?w, who "because of lack of knowledge of Polish or even understand able German, was assisted by Jakob Bereksohn Sonnenberg, a businessman of the local factories." See AGAD, CWW, 1871, pp. 168-79. 39. See AGAD, CWW, 1871, pp. 114-17, 119-21; see also Boim, Harabi rebe bunem mipe shisha, ii. 633^0 (copy and the Hebrew translation). Alexander Zusya Kahana was also a hasidic reli gious leader, in the broad meaning of the term; he was not, however, a zaddik but only a communal rabbi in Siedlce and Plock, as well as an intimate associate of Simha Bunim of Przysucha. 40. Lederhendler, The Road to Modern Jewish Politics, 74; for more, see ibid., 68-83. 41.

On the contrary, hasidic popular literature suggests that the understanding of contemporary political mechanisms remained very low, limited schematically in the popular imagination to protection and corruption, and the image of Hasidism as an antimodernist movement actually strengthened in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Nonetheless, the image of Polish Hasidism as interested not only spiritually but also materially in the well being of its followers undoubtedly has its roots, alongside other factors, in the pol itical orientation of its leading representatives. Triumph: R. Isaac Kalisz of Warka The political involvement of hasidic leaders in central Poland reached its culmination in the 1840s. Further qualitative changes and a transformation to the third phase of "hasidic politics" followed. The zaddik Isaac Kalisz of Warka, the most active of the political representatives of the Orthodox faction of Jewish society in Congress Poland, became the symbol of this politics. His shta dlanut has already been described many times in the historical literature, and so there is no particular need to discuss it in detail here.42 However, several charac teristic features that distinguished the activity of R. Isaac from earlier hasidic initiatives should be mentioned here in order to grasp the novelty of his political involvement. Above all, the society in defense of which R. Isaac acted was not the hasidic community but rather the entire Jewish society in Poland. Moreover, R. Isaac did not reveal to Polish authorities his own hasidic identity, introducing himself "as a Rabbi in whom the entire Jewish nation places its trust" and "whose true vocation is to watch over the religion as a whole."43 This was a revolutionary change and a very characteristic feature of this new phase. Political activity did not have the character of direct, sheer defense any more but rather of a two-sided political game with the Polish government. An excellent example of this is R. Isaac's most well-known intervention from 1846, when he asked Moses Montefiore, tra veling in Poland and Russia, to approach Tsar Nicholas I in the matter of eliminat ing the obligation of military service and the rejection of Jewish dress.44 42. See, e.g., Assaf and Bartal, "Shtadlanut ve'ortodoksiyah"; and Marcin Wodzi?ski, "Hasid ism, Shtadlanut, and Jewish Politics in Nineteenth Century Poland: The Case of Isaac of Warka," Jewish Quarterly Review 96, no. 2 (2005): 290-320.

Isaac of Warka with Montefiore are unclear (various sources give different locations even for the place of the meeting), but from the existing information, it is clear that the subject of the intervention was the decrees on military service and dress? questions related to all of Jewish society, not only the hasidic community. It is possible to maintain, to be sure, that the question of dress concerned the hasidim, especially tied to tradition, more than other Jews and so in a sense was "hasidic." In essence, however, from 1846 on in the Congress Kingdom, the law regarding the change in Jewish dress allowed those with religious obligations (rabbis and so-called spiritual leaders or judges), "elders" over the age of sixty, and those who paid special tax to wear Jewish dress.45 Most important, then, was the matter of finances and not the degree of tradition. The decree was most burden some for those who could not pay such taxes, and we have no data that allow us to assume there were many hasidim among those unable to pay. In fact, initial research on the social and occupational status of hasidim in several Jewish communities of central Poland during the mid-nineteenth century indicates that hasidim were overrepresented in higher fiscal classes and underrepresented among those with lower incomes.46 The law changed and became more oppressive in 1850, but R. Isaac could not have known about this during Montefiore's intervention in 1846. Still clearer is the general Jewish, nonhasidic character of R. Isaac's other interventions, known to us thanks to archival sources. The first well-documented action from 1835 concerned the right of the Jewish communities in Poland to establish their 'eruvin (strings, threads, or wires traditionally hung around Jewish districts to allow objects to be carried outdoors on the Sabbath) in Jewish quarters during the Sabbath and on Jewish holidays. The next action?actually, a series of interventions from 1839 to 1845?concerned the establishment of special controls for kosher butchers (essentially an attempt by the communal rabbis to regain the control over kosher meat). From 1840 to 1842, R. Isaac also undertook an administrative intervention to liberate Jews from the obligation of obtaining a civil divorce before a religious divorce. From 1840 to 1841, R. Isaac helped the community of Czyzew to free itself from the threat of a rabbi appointed by the state and intervened at least twice in defense of Jewish prisoners.47 The obvious beneficiary of all of these actions was the entire Jewish society, not just hasidim. 45. AGAD, KRSW, 6643, folio 1-102. For a more general account of the state regulations regarding Jewish dress in Poland and Russia, see Israel Klausner, "Hagezerah 'al tilboshet hayehudim, 1844-1850," Gal-Ed 6 (1982): 11-26. 46. The socioeconomic standing of Hasidism in the nineteenth century is still to be investigated. However, the once dominant claim of Raphael Mahler {Hasidism and the Jewish Enlightenment, 7-10) that nineteenth-century Hasidism was a movement of the oppressed masses is often challenged today. My claim is based on the yet unpublished sample analysis of the prospographic materials from Alek sandr?w (Alexander), Cz?stochowa, and Wloclawek from the years 1820-37. See AGAD, CWW, 1734, p. 224; Archiwum Pa?stwowe w Toruniu, Oddzial we Wloclawku, Naczelnik Powiatu Wloclawskiego, 438, pp. 178-79; and Akta miasta Wloclawka, 319. 47. All these interventions are discussed in my "Hasidism, Shtadlanut, and Jewish Politics." 236</page><page sequence="17">How Modern is an Antimodernist Movement? I do not want to question or guess at R. Isaac's intentions; I readily accept that his goal was the defense of the people of Israel, as he viewed the people's interests and defined them in his interventions. However, independently of these external goals and the sincerity of his intentions, the activity undertaken by R. Isaac also had an ulterior motive, more important from my point of view. This was to influence, by political action, the opinion of all Jewish society and, in effect, to strengthen the position of the movement that R. Isaac represented. Political activity in the state arena gained an additional dimension, becoming in a certain sense an instrument of an internal Jewish game to strengthen the position of Hasidism among other competing factions of Jewish society. R. Isaac certainly wanted to gain ministerial permission to establish 'eruvin in Jewish quarters throughout the Congress Kingdom and the control of kosher meat sold by local butchers. But at the same time, thanks to this effective course of action, he strengthened his own image as a savior of the Jewish people in Poland and, by implication, the image of Hasidism as a movement that was effective at defending Jewish interests. The involvement of many people, including numerous rabbis and the communities' elders, leads us to conclude that this activity must have been well known to relatively large sections of Jewish society. Therefore, it was clear who defended them from the gezerot, or "evil decrees," of the Gentile government, such as oppressive divorce laws, the prohibition on 'eruvin, or the enforced con scription of Jewish prisoners. Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that the success ful interventions by R. Isaac of Warka and other hasidic leaders did influence the standing of the hasidic movement among the Jewish population, who could view this movement as its valid legal representative and its most successful defender, so much so that in the 1840s, British missionaries called Warka the "Jewish capital of Poland."48 The second characteristic feature distinguishing R. Isaac from earlier shta dlanim was his increased specialization and his use of surprisingly modem and precise mechanisms of political activity. R. Isaac surrounded himself with a group of highly competent administrative-legal aides who maintained excellent personal contacts with representatives of the Polish government. The best known of R. Isaac's helpers, Mordecai M?tele Michelson of Kafuszyn, even gained high state distinction and deserved fame as a shtadlan in hasidic literature.49 This team skillfully took advantage of all administrative options, the examination of peti tions, and the influence of the decisions of the government administration; 48. AGAD, CWW, 1457, p. 575. 49. See Waiden, Ohel Yizhak, 6-8, no. 64; Zevi M.

At the same time, R. Isaac's own activity points to an excellent knowledge of the change in political climate and its eventual consequences. In the spectacular affair of the trustees of the kosher meat slaugh terers, R. Isaac succeeded in overcoming the clerical inertia of the provincial gov ernment and three departments of the Government Commission and convinced the provincial authorities and ministers to recognize him as the de facto representative of all of Jewish society in the Congress Kingdom, to come out with decisions favorable to his positions, and in three instances, to correct previous decisions. Such a degree of professionalism had been unknown in earlier hasidic shtadlanim, and as a consequence led to R. Isaac's unquestioned position as the political representative of traditional Jewish society in Poland, which was accepted by the authorities of the Polish Congress Kingdom. Such success demanded from R. Isaac and his assistants a very significant involvement in the mechanisms of contemporary politics. This, in turn, encouraged further participation in politics, and so further "modernization" of the parameters of the political involvement. By the 1840s and 1850s, we see in the Congress Kingdom the apogee of hasidic involvement in the contemporary mechanisms of politics, termed earlier "defensive modernization." This does not mean, of course, that Hasidism became a modern movement per se. The hasidic version of "defensive modernization" accepted modern methods of political action, at the same time strengthening its antimodernist self-perception and rejecting the values of the modernizing world. This ambiva lence can also be seen in the intervention of R. Isaac of Warka. One of the charac teristic features of these interventions, which I have not yet mentioned, was the increased tendency to introduce the zaddik as the center and primary cause of the political activity. R. Isaac appeared as the sole representative of society both externally, in letters directed to the government, and internally, in the hasidic hagiography. Of course, the author and readers of stories about R. Isaac knew that the zaddik did not act alone but usually employed a team of highly qualified assistants. Numerous, though subtle, mentions of this can be found in the hasidic literature. Nonetheless, political activity was undertaken in the zaddik's name, authorized by him, and attributed to him in its entirety. It may even be said that the zaddik acted through his followers. Moreover, in hasidic tradition, this activity acquired supernatural dimensions, and its mythologization followed. We observe, then, a kind of cycle: from the vision of the zaddik as an apolitical religious leader, to his appearance in the world of politics, followed by the introduction of politics into the religious sphere through the mythologization of this politics. In this way, a reconciliation of the apparently contradictory images of the zaddik as a political player participating in the meanderings of contemporary politics and as the leader of a conservative community, loyal to the traditions of its fathers, becomes possible. This method of political activity?tactical or defensive?thus did not have any serious ideological consequences or lead to a change in the image of the hasidic movement. 238</page><page sequence="19">How Modern is an Antimodernist Movement? CONCLUSION The schema of the three phases of hasidic political activity introduced here has a rather typological, and not strictly chronological, character. The fragmentary nature of the sources does not allow for much more; only for the period of activity of R. Isaac of Warka are the sources somewhat more extensive. One should remember, too, the natural limitations of all types of systematization such as this. The events described here took place between the second half of the 1810s and the mid-1840s and so encompass only a relatively short period of twenty five to thirty years. Many of the men described were active for all or almost all of this period, and their attitudes certainly did not all evolve in accordance with the schema introduced here. And in activities such as those described here, the influence of individual, and even accidental, factors (for example, the talents of leaders such as R. Isaac of Warka or the degree of corruption among individual officials) were essential. The point of the schema introduced here, then, is to reconstruct the collective political consciousness of hasidim in Congress Poland (though "collective" does not aptly describe the actions of a small group of activist politicians) and the evolution of this consciousness, not individual attitudes and behaviors. As always, this type of generalization is burdened by a significant risk of error. I think, though, that the risk is worth taking. It seems that alongside indi vidual and accidental factors, the political activity undertaken at this time by representatives of Hasidism arose from a common imagination and can be termed "political culture," with all the ambiguity of the term. I would not dare to call this hasidic political culture; it must be said that too little distinguished it from other traditional forms of political culture in Jewish eastern Europe. But exclusive to Hasidism was the direction of its evolution from 1815 to 1848. As a result of factors both external (numerous attempts to reform Jewish society undertaken by the government of the Congress Kingdom from 1815 to 1830, the interest of the government in Hasidism, and investigations into this issue) and internal (the rapid rate of hasidic expansion in central Poland), representatives of the hasidic movement during this period turned to the political tools of the modernizing state. The successes and often surprising advantages achieved by hasidic leaders in the early phase of their involvement led to an intensification of activity. Along with the increasing skill of the hasidic shtadlanim went the broadening of the functions and applications of con temporary administrative procedures and the benefits obtained from increasingly improved procedures. In this sense, one can say that the new political categories of post-Napoleonic Europe influenced Polish Hasidism?or perhaps more pre cisely stated, influenced the political consciousness and political image of hasidic leaders. At the same time, however, this movement and its leaders managed to preserve the distinctively antimodernist character of the hasidic com munity, based on the movement's self-image as incarnation of traditional, conser vative world of their forefathers. However incredible, the union of a traditional self-image and modem political behavior turned out to be functionally efficient and even exceptionally lively. 239</page><page sequence="20">Marcin Wodzi?ski The Rebbe of Ropczyce (Roptshits), Naftali Tsevi Hirsh Horovitz (1760 1827), is reported to have said, "It requires great cleverness to be whole-hearted with the Lord." Martin Buber used this statement as evidence of corruption in later Hasidism.50 However, one can also see in this saying something very true about the state of Hasidism during the nineteenth century. When analyzing the dis crepancy between the perception and self-perception of Hasidism and the actual social features ofthat movement, one can only say that nineteenth-century Hasid ism indeed needed a lot of modernization in order to remain antimodernist. Polish Hasidism successfully managed to combine a very traditional self-image with the adoption of modern forms of political activity and social interest. This, in fact, would become the most characteristic feature of Polish Hasidism in the decades to come.
