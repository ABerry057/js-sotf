<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS 389 Leon J. Weinberger, ed. and trans. Twilight of a Golden Age: Selected Poems of Abraham Ibn Ezra. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1997. xv, 267 pp. As Leon Weinberger comments in his introduction, of the five "celebrated scholar-poets in 'Golden Age' Spain, only Abraham Ibn Ezra inspired in the public mind the kind of legend generally associated with a Moses or Elijah the Prophet" (p. 55). Mathematician and exegete, philosopher and poet, Ibn Ezra was led by fortune and temperament to wander from Spain to Italy, North Africa, France, and England. To him, perhaps, more than to any other thinker or influence, the Jews of Christian Europe owed their exposure to the new forms of knowledge that had blossomed in Arab Spain. An English-language work devoted to Ibn Ezra the poet, and making available some of the vast range of his oeuvre, is long overdue. This said, scholarship on the period and its writers has advanced considerably since Professor Weinberger's first monographs on Golden Age and Balkan Hebrew writers began appearing in the 1970s. Held against this standard, both in form and substance, this book will disappoint. The introductory essay moves through a number of themes addressed by the selected poetic texts. However, the discussion of intellectual, cultural, and historical currents is superficial, and the bibliography reveals that only a cursory nod has been given to the bounty of recent work on medieval Andalusian Hebrew poetry and culture. This goes for the treatment of astrology, Neoplatonism, Jewish scholarship in northern France, and the attitudes of medieval Christians and Muslims. The portrayal of Ibn Ezra as an anti-Christian polemicist is astonishing; Weinberger reads generic dismissals of Islam and Christianity as specific references to Christian "monks" and Almohad persecutors. There is no evidence for accusing the Christian monastics of Ibn Ezra's time with particularly virulent anti-Jewish behavior, a belief Weinberger has perhaps acquired by extrapolating backwards the work of Jeremy Cohen on the thirteenth-century friars. Likewise, it is not clear why Muslim polemicists would be engaged in Hebrew gematria (p. 48), or in Hebrew at all. Weinberger's generalized references to "the realism in mid-twelfth-century Hispano-Hebrew prosody" (p. 69) seem again to extrapolate from trends associated with twelfth-century writing in (Christian) northern Europe to poetic production in Arab Spain. In a way that evokes touchingly the editions of Golden Age poets produced a century ago, Weinberger constructs a romanticized version of his subject at odds</page><page sequence="2">390 BOOK REVIEWS with the hard-headed and occasionally sharp-tongued rationalist portrayed by the poet's own words. Other misrepresentations are harder to explain. In a section devoted to Ibn Ezra as a popular figure in Jewish legend, Weinberger includes texts presented as translations from Egyptian "folk-tales" (pp. 57, 58). As Weinberger notes, the texts were published in 1992 by Yitsaq Avishur, who, however, identifies them as Iraqi and Egyptian legends transcribed from living Iraqi Jews in Israel today. For secular muwashshahat with Judeo-Arabic or Arabic and romance endings, Weinberger has reproduced S. M. Stem's translations without clear attribution. The translations pose other problems. In some cases, an old attitude towards translation is perhaps at stake, one that permits the translator greater liberty in refashioning the original text. In other cases, Weinberger seems to miss conventional topoi of the genre. In poem 10, for instance, the poet resorts to a standard topos of the ailing lover, and the text must be translated: "take pity on his sadness./ He is so light he almost flies like a bird, and grief has threaded his hair with silver / He is so thin he can't be seen, and his heart melts from sickness" (p. 83, 11. 3-5). Weinberger translates, "take pity on his condition [i.e., matsav not ma'atsav]]./ From anguish, gray hairs hasten upon his head, Almost as fast as the bird flies./ The wretched man, his heart melting from love's fever, Is reluctant to show his face" (p. 81). In yet other cases, the meaning of the poem is seriously distorted by mistranslations. Thus, in poem 9, 1. 22, the verse "my body is exhausted and my soul burned out" is rendered as "My family is disabled and I am ignorant of what lies ahead" (p. 79), or in poem 21, 11. 6-7, where the Hebrew must mean "In all His works He is wondrous; He heals the sick,/ He works without agency (i.e., directly), openly and not in secret" (see Levin's note, 1:77-78), Weinberger has "He labors in secret healing the sick/ He works concealed without tools that can be seen" (p. 133)-the precise opposite, theologically, of the Hebrew's intent. Weinberger uses Hebrew texts from either Schirmann or Levin; the Eggers text, for all its problems the earliest, is unmentioned. Inexplicably, he occasionally changes the order of lines (poem 15A, p. 100) or of entire stanzas (poem 10, p. 82) from their appearance in his source. In short, this is a book that falls short of many scholarly expectations, while ironically reminding us of the labors of men like its author, who in many ways laid the groundwork for the studies to come. If Twilight of a Golden Age leaves</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 391 the reader longing for another book about Abraham Ibn Ezra, then perhaps, after all, part of its job has been done.
