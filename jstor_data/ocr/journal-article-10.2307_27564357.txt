These works herald the emergence of a new wave of Mishnah research.1 While differing significantly in their themes and methods, all the works discussed here share some basic methodological assump tions that are not shared by more "traditional" studies. Among these are a holistic attitude to the Mishnah as a composition; interest in questions of variegation of genre and style (narratives, rituals, lists, etc.); sensitivity to literary devices and techniques; and the use of new interpretive paradigms from rhetoric, cultural, and performative studies. There is yet another, more fundamental, feature shared by many of these new studies: their return to the most basic questions regarding the nature and char acter of the Mishnah?questions that stood at the center of academic scholarship of rabbinic literature from its very inception but have been largely abandoned in favor of more local philological and interpretive studies.2 What characterizes the Mishnah as a composition? What kind of project is it? What is the place of midrash within it? What kind of historical value does it hold? What are its relation ships to older traditions? Or, in short, what is mishnah? In what follows, I attempt to explore some of these new developments through two specific case studies: Elizabeth Shanks Alexander's application of 1. These are the studies discussed in this essay: Elizabeth Shanks Alexander, Transmitting Mishnah: The Shaping Influence of Oral Tradition (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006); Avraham Walfish, "Shitat Ha'arikhah Hasifrutit Bamishnah al-pi Massekhet Ro'sh Hashanah" (PhD diss., Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2001); Moshe Simon-Shoshan, "Halakhah lema'aseh: Narra tive and Legal Discourse in the Mishnah" (PhD diss., University of Pennsylvania, 2005); Martin S Jaffee, Torah in the Mouth: Writing and Oral Tradition in Palestinian Judaism, 200 BCE-400 CE (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001); Beth A. Berkowitz, Execution and Invention: Death Penalty Discourse in Early Rabbinic and Christian Cultures (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006); and Chaya Halberstam, Evidence and Uncertainty: Rabbinic Judges Interpret the World (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, forthcoming). 2. On these developments, see Jacob Neusner, ed., The Modern Study of the Mishnah (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1973). 235</page><page sequence="2">Ishay Rosen-Zvi orality studies to mishnaic research, and several recent studies on ritual narratives in the Mishnah. Orality, Textuality, and Methodology in Mishnah Research Mishnah research has a long tradition of focusing on text, both in its philo logical and its literary aspects. When orality began to gain attention as a theoretical tool in rabbinic studies, it was mainly limited to the writings of folklore special ists,3 who attempted to identify remnants of folk literature in rabbinic Aggadah (an attempt strongly criticized by Yonah Fraenkel and his Aggadah-as-high-literature school).4 In recent years, rhetoric began to take the place of folklore, and scholars started thinking of actual performative settings for the production of rabbinic lit erature.5 Nonetheless, the impressive body of knowledge developed in orality studies made very little headway into rabbinics, which remained focused largely on written texts. This lacuna supplies the background necessary to evaluate Alexander's recent book on Mishnah Shevu'ot, Transmitting Mishnah: The Shaping Influence of Oral Tradition. Alexander uses the concept of orality in order to renew the dis cussion of some very old questions regarding the composition, redaction, and transmission of the Mishnah. The book is courageous in its willingness to debate some of the most prominent scholars and most established theories on the Mishnah and its creation.6 Alexander returns to the very beginnings of the field, using the fieldwork of Milman Parry and his student Albert Lord on oral storytellers in Yugoslavia in order to imagine how an oral-textual production might have looked. The results are at times eye-opening. Thus, she reads the fixed phrases, appearing time and again in Mishnah Shevu'ot (,*?D1X t?w nrattf "my "'Dft ,*7mi sntw), not simply as termini technici, used for the sake of legal clarity, as the common explanation goes, but as building bricks for oral transmit ters, similar to what Parry and Lord observed in both the Homeric and the Yugo slavian cases. Alexander takes these studies as a powerful antidote to the literary bias that separates too sharply the production and the transmission of texts. According to her oral model, textual transmission involves a renewed act of textual creation. Thus, Alexander's "oral lens" replaces fixed exempla with a flex ible model and passive transformation with active performance.7 3. See Eli Yassif, The Hebrew Folktale: History, Genre, Meaning, trans. J. S. Teitelbaum (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1999); Galit Hasan-Rokem, Web of Life: Folklore and Midrash in Rabbinic Literature, trans. Batya Stein (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2000). 4. See mainly Yonah Fraenkel, Sipur ha-agadah, ahdut shel tokhen vezurah (Tel Aviv: Hakib butz Hameuhad, 2001), 236-60. 5. One of the first books to utilize such concepts was Steven Fraade, From Tradition to Com mentary: Torah and Its Interpretation in the Midrash Sifre to Deuteronomy (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1991). 6. Thus, in the course of her introduction alone, Alexander challenges both S. Lieberman's thesis of the oral publication of the Mishnah (19-21), and J. N. Epstein's theory of textual corruption (25-27). 7. Alexander, Transmitting Mishnah, 9. 236</page><page sequence="3">Orality, Narrative, Rhetoric Their pioneering work notwithstanding, Parry's and Lord's concepts remain very limited, especially in their insistence on binary divisions between orality and literacy. Alexander thus turns to more recent scholars such as Ruth Finnegan, who emphasizes the coexistence and interdependence of orality and literacy. Written texts are orally performed (thus bringing them to a wider, usually illiterate, audience), whereas oral recitation both depends on and facilitates writing (as is clearest in the case of ancient rhetoric). Here, Alexan der's book is consciously based on Martin Jaffee's 2001 Torah in the Mouth, which takes as its central task to establish the coexistence of oral and written transmission in rabbinic literature.8 Alexander applies Jaffee's model to analyze Mishnah-Tosefta parallels in Tractate Shevu'ot. Like Jaffee, but unlike most scholars, Alexander reads these parallels not as an adaptation of one source or the other, but as a testimony to the existence of multiple versions of the same source, as is typical of oral transmission.9 In the second chapter, Alexander's book moves from the Mishnah itself to its reception and canonization in the two Talmuds. Alexander chooses her own path here as well, which remains distinct from common conceptions. Instead of identify ing the canonization process in the very formation of the Mishnah itself, at the first half of the third century,10 she presents it as the result of a long process of talmudic interpretation of, and engagement with, the Mishnah. Here, however, one might question her dating of the Mishnah's canonization "by the end of rabbinic period" (77). Alexander's conclusion is based on identifying authoritative status with textual fixity, which seems problematic in light of our knowledge about cano nization processes of other rabbinic compositions, first and foremost the status of the Bavli in the Geonic academies, which, although fully authoritative and binding, was textually fluid and "open."11 The second part of the book (Chap. 3^4) is dedicated to an analysis of the casuistic style of Mishnah Shevu'ot. The place of casuistics in early rabbinic lit erature has earned a thorough and detailed discussion in Leib Moskovitz's Talmudic Reasoning: From Casuistics to Conceptualization}2 For Moskovitz, 8. While Jaffee's book suggests a wide thesis with sporadic examples, Alexander applies it to a systematic study of one tractate, thus exemplifying its exegetical power. 9. "Jaffee bypasses the question of priority that occupies so many scholars evaluating parallel traditions. Instead of trying to resolve the question of which version came first, Jaffee illustrates how oral performance can produce just the kind of variety exhibited by the parallels" (Alexander, Transmit ting Mishnah, 36-37). 10. Some scholars claim that the Mishnah had some binding and authoritative status even before Rabbi Judah the Prince, which explains his avoidance of thorough adaptations of the Mishnah in accordance to his own views. See Zacharias Frankel, Darkhei hamishnah, 2nd rev. ed. (Tel Aviv: Sihai, 1959), 285; and Jacob Nahum Epstein, Mevo'ot lesifrut hatanna'im (Jerusalem and Tel Aviv: Dvir and Magnes Press, 1957), 212. 11. See Yerahmiel (Robert) Brody, "Sifrut hage'onim vehatext hatalmudi," Mehkerei Talmud 1 (1990): 237-303; and Uziel Fuks, "Mekomam shel hage'onim bemasoret hanusah shel hatalmud habavli" (PhD diss., Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2003). 12. Leib Moskovitz, Talmudic Reasoning: From Casuistics to Conceptualization (T?bingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2002). 237</page><page sequence="4">Ishay Rosen-Zvi casuistics is not only a stylistic choice but also a more general "mode of logic and reasoning."13 Casuistic form testifies not only to a preference for a certain type of legal formulation14 but also, by and large, to the way the Tannaim thought.15 The generalizations and conceptualization found in tannaitic material (mainly in the Mishnah) are "of very low level" and are "rather narrow in scope and not very abstract or creative, conceptually speaking."16 Moskovitz does admit that in some cases a "readily discernible implicit principle" stands behind casuistic for mulae, in which case casuistics should be read as a legal style rather than a mode of thinking ("principled law in casuistic fashion").17 He also maps various kinds of implicit and explicit generalized rulings in tannaitic literature. However, he does not offer any reasoning the Tannaim may have had for choosing casuistics as the prevalent style in the Mishnah. Ultimately casuistics seem, for him, to simply be a part of "ancient law in general," and so it is the other side of the issue, the development of halakhic conceptualization, that occupies most of his explanatory effort.18 It is exactly this lacuna that is the starting point of Alexander's thesis, analyzing mishnaic casuistics as a conscious educational tool. Alexander's theoretical sophistication, together with her sensitive close read ings, allow her to read the numerous short case studies, which are the building blocks of Mishnah Shevu'ot, in an unexpected way. Rather than as a testimony to a not-yet-conceptual legal mind, Alexander reads casuistic halakhah as pedago gic instruction in legal thinking, even while teaching new laws. Different types of casuistic styles are read by Alexander as specific devices to train students in various kinds of legal inference. Thus, the simple basic casuistic form in the Mishnah is interpreted as "using particular cases to illustrate general rules," while series of related cases are "an exercise in compare and contrast," improbable cases are "exploring how different legal principles interact," and borderline cases are "flesh ing out legal ambiguities."19 Alexander thus agrees with Abraham Goldberg's 13. Moskovitz, Talmudic Reasoning, 9. 14. In Moskovitz's words, "such rulings often seem to be conceptually casuistic [that is, not grounded in broader conceptual issues] and not just casuistically formulated" (ibid., 47). Moskovitz cites only two examples: M. Shabbat 24:2 and Mo'ed Katan 1:1.1 cannot see any reason to assume that the distinctions made in both these Mishnah units do not have a broader concept behind them, like the distinction between little and much effort, nm? (as the two Talmudim indicate; see B. Shabbat 155a; Y Mo'ed Katan 1:1 [80a]), and are solely "realia based issues." This conclusion strikes me as an a priori assumption regarding rabbinic (lack of) conceptualization rather then a textual-based inference. 15. See, for example, his formulation: "why casuistic legal formulation (and, apparently, casuis tic thought) are so common in tannaitic literature" (Moskovitz, Talmudic Reasoning, 50 n. 14). 16. Moskovitz, Talmudic Reasoning, 59, 97. 17. Ibid., 49. 18. Ibid., 97. One should further note that although most of his examples are taken from the Mishnah, Moskovitz does not discuss it independently, but only as part of a tannaitic tendency toward casuistics in general. 19. These are the subtitles of Chapter 3. Alexander adopts this model from current scholarship on biblical casuistic style (see Talmudic Reasoning, 123-28, and, more extensively, Elizabeth Shanks Alexander, "Casuistic Elements in Mishnaic Law: Examples from M. Shevu'ot," Jewish Studies Quar terly 10, no. 3 [2003]: 190-200). This borrowing raises a number of questions not discussed by 238</page><page sequence="5">Orality, Narrative, Rhetoric famous thesis of the Mishnah as a teaching manual, rather than as a legal code or anthology,20 but asserts that the "teaching" in this manual should not be restricted to legal content only, but more generally to legal thought and analysis. This is a good example of the new sensitivities shared by many of the recent studies, even when they employ different methods and approaches. M. Simon Shoshan, in his dissertation,21 also discusses the Mishnah's casuistic style, and his account differs significantly from that of that of Alexander's. While Alexander treats casuistics as a distinct style, Simon-Shoshan views it as part of a larger range of mishnaic rhetorical techniques, showing relative degrees of narrativity. Moreover, Alexander emphasizes the pedagogic virtue of casuistics, whereas Simon-Shoshan emphasizes the special claim of authority it implies. Both, however, share the very basic attitude to casuistics as a rhetorical device rather than as a mode of legal think ing, as is common in various studies.22 Though quite different, a shift from legal to rhetorical models (for analysis of legal sections!) is clear in both cases. Let us now return to the oral/written coexistence theory, the center of both Jaffee's and Alexander's studies. While Alexander essentially bases her thesis on general theories of orality (like Goody's and Finnegan's), Jaffee cites specific his torical comparisons to contemporary Hellenistic literacy in order to establish his claim.23 He specifically associates rabbinic literature with Roman rhetorical exer cises, in which students revised famous written texts while performing them orally. He sees this, and similar phenomena, as possible models for the development of rabbinic literature and, more specifically, as an explanation for the existence of signs for both oral (mnemonic devices, lists, and narratives) and written com ponents (compositions and combinations that ignore these oral special traits) in the Mishnah.24 The model itself makes a lot of sense, and also has some convin cing cross-cultural examples, but its applicability to rabbinic literature is far from proven. In fact, Jaffee applies the oral/written model in two different, even oppos ing, ways regarding various compositions. When dealing with the relationship Alexander: Should we ascribe educational traits to all ancient casuistic laws, or is there something special about biblical and mishnaic casuistics alone? Are mishnaic casuistics simply an imitation of the biblical style, or is it a development or an adaptation of it? What are the relationships between mishnaic casuistics and contemporary (Roman and other) legal styles? Despite the attractiveness of Alexander's thesis, a more solid evaluation of the nature of mishnaic casuistics should deal with these questions. 20.

According to Jaffee, "the editorial work.. .seems more amenable to a scribal copyist/editor, untroubled by mnemonically managing an abundance of formulaic styles" {Torah in the Mouth, 109). This claim runs against the study of Avraham Walfish, "Shitat," who found a wide usage of wordplays, chiasms, repetitions, and other mnemonic devices in the Mishnah's redaction. 239</page><page sequence="6">Is hay Rosen-Zvi between Mishnah and Tosefta (Chap. 6), he explains the parallel material as coming from two "independent written recensions of an anterior oral performative narrative," assuming a transformation from an oral mode to a written one.25 However, when discussing the recasting of the tannaitic material in the Talmuds (Chap. 7), he argues for a transition in the opposite direction, from written to oral?"reworking through memory a written text."26 While both have parallels in Hellenistic practice and are theoretically possible, I did not find a convincing argument for preferring one model in the first case and the other in the second. How are we to choose the relevant model for comparison, and, more importantly, how can we be sure that rabbinic literature complies with it? Yaacov Sussman has recently suggested that it actually does not. In his article "Torah shebe'al peh: peshutah kimashma'ah?koho shel kotzo shel yod" (which might be translated as "Taking the Concept of 'Oral Torah' Literally? The Power of the Jot and Tittle"),27 Sussman claims that rabbinic literature was created and transmitted exclusively orally, at least until the eighth century.28 He further insists that while the coexistence theory holds true for many cultures, both contemporary with and later than the rabbis, it does not apply to rabbinic lit erature. There is no single positive proof of the existence of official or unofficial written copies in the house of study,29 as was assumed by scholars.30 Indeed, all the sources show that the rabbis never turned to written books, even when they failed to remember the text or had doubts regarding its exact wording (the two classic cases for consulting books in ancient cultures).31 They had only the Tannaim (memorizers or "living books")32 at their disposal in these cases. The popularity of the coexistence thesis, especially regarding the Mishnah, does not come from evidence for the existence of written material beside the oral memor ization in the house of study, but from dogmatic, theoretical, and comparative assumptions regarding textuality.33 Such a phenomenon of exclusively oral 25. Jaffee, Torah in the Mouth, 102. 26. Ibid., 131. 27. Mehkerei Talmud 3 (2006): 209-384. 28. Sussman, "Torah," 328. 29. "If after all this great effort we have not been able to cite even one real piece of evidence for the existence of books in halakhah, it means that there were actually none" (ibid., 225). 30. See Jacob Nahum Epstein, Mavo lenosah hamishnah, 3rd ed. (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 2001), 692-706; Saul Lieberman, Hellenism in Jewish Palestine, 2nd ed.

Shamma Friedman (Jerusalem and New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1993), 29-47. There is a disagreement regarding the exact nature of these written copies of the Mishnah?whether they were formal editions (Albeck), private notes (Lieberman), or something in between (Epstein). All, however, agree, as Sussman, "Torah," shows, that there was some kind of written version of the Mishnah available to the sages, whether formally or not. 31. Sussman, "Torah," 279-82. 32. Sussman "Torah," 240-44; cf. Lieberman, Hellenism, 88-90. 33. One can in fact identify two very different arguments for the coexistence thesis: the com parative argument based on the place of literacy in Hellenistic cultures, and specifically on the unpre cedented phenomenon of the existence of a composition of the size of the Mishnah in exclusively oral 240</page><page sequence="7">Orality, Narrative, Rhetoric composition, Sussman continues, indeed might be unique to the cultural environ ment of the rabbis,34 and it should be understood in light of a similarly exceptional ideology of nnmttf min, one authoritative Torah, as the basis of the rabbinic academy,35 distinguished from all other traditions, which should therefore be kept oral. There is only one book in the house of study, the Bible. This ideology, phrased formally only during the third century,36 but with much older roots,37 is the foundation of this unique phenomenon of HD *73nttf min: a thoroughly literate culture whose literary production is nonetheless exclusively oral. Sussman's paper is itself not without problems,38 but it should, I believe, function as a warning sign against uncritical wholesale implementations of con temporary theories of orality. General theories, like comparative studies, should not become our only measure, lest they prevent us from appreciating the specific material at stake. This is the case, for example, with Catherine Hezser's rejection of Saul Lieberman's thesis on the exclusively oral publication of the Mishnah, on the ground that "there is no analogy for the oral transmission of a literary corpus as large as the Mishnah in late antique Greco-Roman society."39 The similarities manner (see n. 39 herein), and the philological argument based on the unlikelihood of oral tradition having such a firm textual fixedness from so early on (unlike other rabbinic composition, most notably the Bavli, see n. 11 herein). Sussman, "Torah," naturally takes issue mainly with the second argument (that "a book is necessary for the existence of fixed version," 317), which he identifies as the basic hypothesis behind Epstein's magnum opus: Mavo ("Torah," 308). 34. See Sussman's claim ("Torah," 350-52) that what makes this phenomenon so special is not the exclusivity of orality per se (a phenomenon well known from several Eastern ancient cultures) but its existence in a culture so deeply invested in written books. What makes it unique, in other words, is the combination of literacy and orality, which creates this ideological, conscious, literate orality (unlike the popular orality of ancient Christianity; see Guy G. Stroumsa, "Early Christianity?A Reli gion of the Book?" in Homer, the Bible, and Beyond: Literary and Religious Canons in the Ancient World, ed. Margalit Finkelberg and Gedaliahu A. G. Stroumsa [Leiden: E. J. Brill, 2003], 162-63). 35. "The only book in the world of the rabbis are the holy scriptures" (Sussman, "Torah," 284). 36. See esp. Y. Pe'ah 2:6 (17a) and the sources cited by Epstein, Mavo, 694; Albeck, Mavo, 112-13; and Jaffee, Torah in the Mouth, 140-47. 37. Already beginning, according to him, with the Pharisees (Sussman, "Torah," 333 n. 6). 38. Sussman is not consistent regarding the question of whether an oral tradition can create a written-like fixed version (cf. "Torah," 268-319). He also deals with rabbinic literature as basically one entity (345 n. 65; cf. his statement on 348) and does not consider seriously the possibility of differ ent modes of transmission for different compositions (see, e.g., his all-too-fast rejection on 373-74 of Shlomo Naeh's suggestion that the tannaitic midrashim, unlike the Mishnah, were actually put in writing during the third century). He also becomes very vague and laconic when moving from describ ing the phenomenon to explaining it (353-55). In the foregoing summary, I have tried to refine what seems to me to be the main thesis of the article, but it includes numerous other discussions, regarding, among other things, wissenschaftgeschichte and analysis of specific Sugyot. 39. Catherine Hezser, "The Mishnah and Ancient Book Production," in The Mishnah in Con temporary Perspective, ed. Alan J. Avery-Peck and Jacob Neusner (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 2002), 183. Hezser's paper is built around the assumption that it is sufficient to demonstrate that a given phenom enon did not exist in Roman literacy in order to reject its existence in rabbinic culture. Needless to say, the comparison does not work the other way around. 241</page><page sequence="8">Ishay Rosen-Zvi between rabbinic and other oral cultures should be decided in each case specifi cally and cannot be simply taken for granted. Theories regarding rabbinic orality do not always give enough place to the unique characteristics of rabbinic literature. They often tend to mix three different meanings of orality, introducing a measure of vagueness into the discussion: The first is orality as a theoretical-methodological tool of thinking about texts (what Alexander calls an "oral lens," or "the oral conception of textuality"). The second is orality as a historical phenomenon, characterizing ancient (or, more gen erally, premodern) societies, which facilitates comparative historical studies, mainly, in our context, with Roman-Hellenistic textuality. And, finally, there is the specific rabbinic ideology of the Oral Torah, HD bviw min. A cautious study of rabbinic orality has to monitor both the theoretical and the comparative contexts of orality by a careful study of the third, culturally specific concept. Any claim about rabbinic orality, moreover, has to take the rabbinic corpus as a whole into consideration?midrash and mishnah, halakhah and Aggadah, early and late? and to resist the temptation to concentrate on specific texts that seem to lend them selves more easily to oral conceptualization, such as late aggadic compilations in the case of folklorists,40 and mishnaic lists or ritual narratives in the case of studies of oral performance.41 Tractates Hullin or Yevamot were no less orally transmitted than Tractate Yoma' or Midrash Eikhah Rabati, and thus every theory about the scope and meaning of rabbinic orality, performative or otherwise, has to take all these texts into account.42 Imagining the Temple: Ritual Narratives in the Mishnah One area in which these new studies seem to make a great difference is that of Temple laws and narratives in the Mishnah. The Mishnah contains nearly forty narrative-like descriptions of various rituals, most of which are related to the Temple and its cult.43 These descriptions, identified by their distinctive narrative-like style?a succession of verbs (e.g., the priest goes, takes, brings, etc.) 40. See Avigdor Shinan, "Sifrut ha'aggada: bein higgud 'al peh umassoret ketuvah," Mehkerei yerushalayim befolklor yehudi 1 (1981): 44-60. 41. Martin S. Jaffee, "Writing and Rabbinic Oral Tradition: On Mishnaic Narrative, Lists and Mnemonics," Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy 4, no. 1 (1994): 123^46. 42. Compare the claim of Y Fraenkel that the existence of several versions of stories in rabbinic literature has nothing to do with the similar phenomenon known from folk literature, as can be proven from the fact that several versions appear in both halakhah and Aggadah (and no one claims that the rabbinic halakhah is folk literature in origin). Therefore, "It is evident that there is no cultural or his torical connection between the oral culture of the rabbis...to the global social phenomenon of folk storytellers" (Fraenkel, Sipur haagada: achdut shel tochen ve-zura [Tel Aviv: Hakibbutz Hameuhad, 2001], 237). 43. The only study that tried to present a full list of such narratives is Y. Breuer, "Pa'al uvenoni bet'iure tekes bamishnah," Tarbiz 56 (1987): 299-326, but this list should be thoroughly revised. See Ishay Rosen-Zvi, The Rite That Was Not: Temple, Midrash and Gender in Tractate Sotah (Jerusalem: Magness, 2008), 242^13 n. 1. 242</page><page sequence="9">Orality, Narrative, Rhetoric rather than the normal apodictic or casuistic mishnaic style ?might occupy a whole tractate (Yoma', Tamid), a chapter (Pesahim 10, Nega'im 14, Parah 3), a single Mishnah unit, or even one part of it (Bekhorot 9:7, Zevahim 5:3). Several recent studies?such as those by Avraham Walfish on Tractates Ro'sh Hashanah and Tamid;45 Yair Lorberbaum, Beth Berkowitz, and Chaya Halberstam on capital punishments in Sanh?drin;46 Daniel St?kl Ben-Ezra on Yoma';47 and my own study of Sotah48?undermine the naive conception of these tractates as authentic descriptions of Temple rituals, recorded when the Temple was still functioning or shortly thereafter.49 According to the new studies, these narratives are by and large a result of second-century debates, fashioning and redaction, and should, accordingly, be taken to represent the concerns of that post-Temple era. The Temple and its worship were studied, reshaped, and even reinvented as part of the second century's all-inclusive legal system, according to the academic needs and interests of its sages. It seems that a conceptual revolution has indeed occurred, and in a very short period of time. I have in fact experienced this revolution with regard to my own study of Tractate Sotah. When I submitted my dissertation in 2003, I felt almost like a heretic, offering to read this Temple ritual as a theoretical textual creation, and nonetheless as a ritual?a performative textual-ritual, created in the tannaitic house of study. When revising my study into a book, less than three years later, I could already cite a handful of powerful studies on various tractates to support and enrich such a reading. M. Yoma' can serve as a clear example of the depth of this shift. Most of the tractate consists of a detailed chronological description of the Temple ritual on the Day of Atonement (or, simply, "The Day," yoma'). D. Z. Hoffman was among the first to describe Yoma' as an "old Mishnah," formulated when the Temple was still functioning, and his observation was adopted by J. N. Epstein.50 Examination of the arguments cited by both shows clearly that they based their theories more 44. On this style, see Breuer, "Pa'al" (note his observation that the succession of verbs can be either in past or present tense). Cf., however, the claim of Simon-Shoshan, Halakhah, that there is no clear-cut distinction between ritual narratives and other mishnaic styles and that, rather than use sharp classifications, we would be better off talking about different "levels" of narrativity (ma 'asim, examples, casuistic laws, etc.) in the Mishnah. 45.

Recently, Daniel St?kl has raised some serious questions regarding this conception, and especially the assumption that Yoma' should be regarded as a reliable historical description of Temple ritual.52 He has shown that several details in the mishnaic ritual are clearly anachronistic,53 while others contradict descriptions found in the earlier writings of Philo, Qumran, Josephus, and the Gospels. Moreover, some of the laws are clearly derived from midrashic inferences or theoretical legal analogies rather than based on concrete reality, and some are even explicitly attributed to mid-second-century sages (the Usha generation). St?kl's and similar studies have convincingly undermined the "ritual narrative as temple memories" doctrine and instead uncovered a multiplicity of factors that operate in the mishnaic discourse of the Temple in a way not recognized by more tra ditional scholarship. They have shown that the Mishnah artfully combines Temple and priestly traditions54 with post-Temple reality and practices,55 biblical exegesis,56 ideological innovations, analogies from other halakhic fields,57 and more. Even in the realm of biblical exegesis alone, a plethora of sources may be identified, combining verses regarding the tabernacle in the desert, the First and Second Temples, and Ezekiel (read by the sages as a prophesy referring to the future Temple), all combined with traditions and memories from the last days of the Second Temple.58 As this plurality of sources clearly shows, ritual narratives in the Mishnah should be considered first and foremost as a style, a literary device, rather than 51. "Die vielen in unserer Mischna befindlichen l?ngeren Beschreibungen von culturellen oder anderen religi?sen Ceremonien unver?nderte Theile der ersten Mischna sind" (Hoffman, Erste, 24-25). The only argument cited by Epstein is M. Yoma' 1:3, "and they read before him out of the rite of the day," but "the rite of the day" (ovn tto) can easily be interpreted as referring to Leviticus 16. 52. St?kl, Impact, 19-28. 53. Most notably, the sages' control of the high priest and on the ritual (1:3-6). Cf. the descrip tion of the Torah benedictions (7:1), which seem to be influenced by the rabbinic synagogue liturgy; see also Ishay Rosen-Zvi, "Responsive Benedictions and the Creation of Liturgical System in rabbinic Lit erature," Jewish Studies, an Internet Journal 7 (2008): 1-29. 54. See esp. the descriptions in Tractates Tamid, Shekalim Chapter 3, Pesahim Chapter 5, and Parah Chapter 3. In a few cases, one can find external evidence to verify the mishnaic description. Compare, for example, the mishnaic claim that the purification water was made by children (M. Parah 3:2) to the explicit prohibition of such a practice in Qumran (4Q271 2:13). 55. See I. Rosen-Zvi, "Haguf vehamikdash: reshimat mumei hakohanim bamishnah umekomo shel hamikdash beveit hamidrash hatanna'i," Mada'ei hayahadut 43 (2005-2006): 52-55. 56. See esp. the ritual narratives that are structured as a succession of derashot: M. Ma'aser Sheni 5:10-14 (the confession of tithes); Sotah 7:5 (blessings and curses); Sotah 9 (the rite of the 'eglah 'arufah); Yevamot 12:6 (halizah); and Nega'im 12:5-7 (nig'ei batim). 57. See, for example, M. Nazir 6:6-9. 58. The clearest example is found in M. Middot. Compare Middot 1:2, 2:5, 5:4 (first person testimonies of the Sages), 4:4 (verse from 1 Kings, regarding Solomon's temple), 3:8 (Zachariah's description of the Second Temple), 2:5, 3:1, and 4:1-2 (quotes from Ezekiel, with explicit references to the future temple). Additional references are to Psalms (2:5) and Isaiah (4:7). 244</page><page sequence="11">Orality, Narrative, Rhetoric as a specific body of knowledge. Indeed, by looking at the content only, one cannot know whether a Mishnah will appear in narrative-like or apodictic style. Similar issues are discussed in some Mishnah units as narratives, while in others as apodictic laws, regardless of their parallel theme. Thus, for example, while some biblical rituals are presented as richly developed narratives in the Mishnah, others possess only some sparse narrative characteristics. Others still, lack all narrative qualities and are presented instead as a series of derashot, with no chronological sequence.60 This requires us to think about ritual narrative in the Mishnah first and fore most from a literary and rhetorical perspective. What is gained by presenting a specific ritual in a narrative style? Phenomenologically speaking, the uniqueness of the ritual narrative is located in the special way it combines law and narrative, thus presenting the ritual as both a typical event and a binding law. These two are intimately connected, for the alleged repetitive nature of the ritual (the descriptive side) is exactly what gives rituals their binding power (the prescriptive one): This is how it should be done because this is also how it was always done. M. Simon Shoshan similarly emphasizes the rhetorical power of ritual description in the way it presents the law as an ever present reality: "Ritual narratives present a chain of interrelated events relating to the Temple cult. ... These texts are not stories because the event described are not one-time occurrences but procedures that were repeated on a regular basis. Ritual narratives operate in an almost mythic structure of time and space in which the same events repeat themselves exactly over and over again."61 Such an analysis may explain an interesting fact that has been overlooked, to the best of my knowledge, by previous scholarship. Ritual narratives in the Mishnah tend to present the way rituals were performed in the Temple era, even in cases when the laws surrounding them discuss the way these rituals are performed in the post Temple era. A clear example is the laws of testimony on the new moon (Wim wwp) in Tractate Ro'sh Hashanah. Although scholars observed that these laws combine the reality of the Temple in Jerusalem with that of postdestruction Yavneh, they did not notice that the ritual narrative itself, beginning with Mishnah 1:9 (n?Ciw ^ Wim m) and ending at 2:7 (tzmpfc wnpa), presents Jerusalem alone as the telos of the journey, while Yavneh appears only in the laws surrounding the narrative.62 This may indeed be exactly the role of such narratives: the presentation of a pure, ideal, "original," ritualistic world, untouched by historical events. Ritual narratives thus make the past present, even when the laws around it discuss more mundane issues, which are relevant for actual legal practice. In S. Fraade's words, "Though these legal practices are often performatively inoperable in the historical context 59. Or even a specific source, "Liber Ritualis," as some scholars imagine. See D. Levine, Ta 'aniot hazibbur uderashot hahakhamim (Tel Aviv: Hakibbutz Hameuhad, 2001), 67-68 n. 2. 60. Compare M. Sotah 9 (full narrative) to M. Sotah 8 (partially narrativistic) to M. Sanh?drin 8-9 (non-narrativistic homilies). 61. Moshe Simon-Shoshan, "Etiological Stories in the Mishnah" (unpublished paper). 62. Mishnah units 1:6 and 2:8-9. 245</page><page sequence="12">Ishay Rosen-Zvi of mishnaic times, through their narrativization they become perpetually present and accessible via the portals of mishnaic study."63 Some ritual narratives suit such performative reading more than others, so much so that they might even be described as a "script or score ... produced with the assumption that its meanings will be activated primarily in performance before an audience."64 So, most notably, is the case with Mishnah Yoma', which seems especially conducive to liturgical recitation. Indeed, as Y Yahalom and M. Swartz have shown, the earliest (avodah liturgies for the Day of Atonement were no more than slight modifications of Mishnah Yoma' itself.65 One can go a step further and claim that the mishnaic narratives function not only as manuals for performance but are in fact themselves rituals, to be carried out through learning or reciting. Thus writes B. Berkowitz regarding the descriptions of court executions in Tractate Sanh?drin: "[T]he rabbinic ritual of execution may be the ideal ritual. While rituals usually work to create a perfect reality in an unpredictable world, the ritual of the Mishnah creates a reality that is almost impervious to contingen cies."66 As strange as this thesis may sound, it is not very different from the con ception that appears in several amoraic circles, which consider the study of order Kodashim in the Mishnah as a substitute for actual sacrifice,67 a fact that probably caused the inclusion of this order in the Babylonian curriculum.68 Such understanding might carry implications for much more than mishnaic Temple rituals only. Taken seriously, it can shed new light on the question of the place of the Temple in the Mishnah as a whole. Temple laws do not appear as an isolated realm in the Mishnah. To the contrary, the Temple is fully integrated into the mishnaic legal system. The language and style of Temple laws are not different in any recognizable way from any other law, whether operative in tannaitic times or completely theoretical. The destruction has almost no presence in the Mishnah.69 In most cases, the Temple does not appear as a memory of the past or an expectation for the future but as part and parcel of the all-inclusive mishnaic 63.

The concept of "perfect reality" is taken from J. Z. Smith's theory of ritual, see esp. idem, To Take Place: Toward Theory in Ritual (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992). For a similar claim regarding Mishnah Sotah, see Rosen-Zvi, Rite, 226-41. 67. Lev. Rab. 7:3 (ed. Margolioth, p. 156), B. Ta'anit 27b, and parallels. 68. Unlike the other two nonpractical orders, Zera 'im and Taharot, which were excluded from the Babylonian (but not the Palestinian) curriculum. See Yaakov Sussman, "Sugyot bavliot lisedarim zera'im vetaharot," (PhD diss., Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1969), esp. 307. 69. The destruction does appear in several Mishnah units (see, e.g., M. Ma'aser Sheni 5:2; Sukkah 3:12; Ro'sh Hashanah 1:3-4, 4:4; Mo'ed Katan 3:6; Nazir 5:4; Sotah 9:12; and Bekhorot 4:1), but these are only exceptions to the general tendency to treat the Temple as present and part of the general binding halakhah. For a clear example of this tendency, see M. Pesahim 10:3; and Shmuel Safrai and Ze'ev Safrai, eds., Hagadat hazal (Jerusalem: Karta, 1998), 25. 246</page><page sequence="13">Orality, Narrative, Rhetoric legal code in the very present. Such integration is unique, and in fact it is unknown to us from any other Jewish legal code in late antiquity.71 These characteristics have brought Jacob Neusner to claim that the Mishnah should be read as a substitute to the Temple in a post-Temple era rather than as a legal guideline toward it: "The Jewish nation went from doing things to imagining systems. ... The second century was an age of system-building, making things up in the mind, spinning a web of reality out of the gossamer threads of attenuated hope. It was a time of philosophy, inner reconstruction."72 Neusner's ungrounded generalizations were justly criticized,73 but as a result, the thesis itself was never seriously engaged. I believe that Neusner's thesis should be modified but not rejected altogether. The Mishnah cannot be fully explained as a fictitious substitution for a failed reality, but this aspect does exist in the Mishnah and should not be overlooked. Thus, for example, Tractate Sanh?drin presents a Utopian society, ruled by a Jewish king and judged by a Jewish central judicial institution (the Sanh?drin), wielding full judicial and punitive authority.74 Tractates Demai and 'Avodah Zarah, on the other hand, assume a very different social reality, one in which adherents of the rabbinic system live as a minority among nonrabbinic (Jewish or Gentile) majority.75 Thus, a more balanced analysis should take into account at least two opposing vectors: practical legal instructions, on the one hand (as, for example, the laws of purity, tithes, etc.), and the creation of an alternative discursive reality, on the 70. This, of course, has to be accounted for in light of the inclusive curriculum of the tannaitic house of study, which includes both practical and theoretical issues. On the tannaitic curriculum see H. Shapira, "Beit hamidrash beshilhei bayit sheni uvitekufat hamishnah" (PhD diss., Hebrew Univer sity of Jerusalem, 2001). 71. Compare the distinction made by Josephus between Temple laws (appearing in the third book of Antiquities, in a descriptive manner) and universal, "secular" laws (appearing in the forth book in a prescriptive style). See also David Altshuler, "On the Classification of Judaic Laws in the Antiquities of Josephus and the Temple Scroll of Qumran," AJS Review 7-8 (1982-83): 1-14. Similarly, we find a clear separation in Qumran between works dealing with practical laws (such as Rule of the Community) and eschatological compositions dealing with the future temple (e.g., the Temple Scroll and War Scroll). A f?ll integration of Temple laws into the everyday code, in a manner similar to the Mishnah, is found in none of these cases. 72.

The crucial question, however, is what is the relationship between the two vectors, and how are they combined in the Mishnah? Let me exemplify this last point with a specific query. The destruction of the Temple did not mark the end of the observance of many laws, which continued to be practiced after the destruction of the Temple, albeit in a substantially different manner. The question raised in these cases?most notably holidays and rules regarding the land (piQ nrf?nn rmx?)?is which of the halakhic realities? Temple or post-Temple?is engaged by the Mishnah. In some cases, the Mishnah's discussion concentrates on the Temple, while in others it is the factual, post-Temple mode that is discussed. Thus, for example, Mishnah Ma'aser Sheni assumes Jerusalem to be the place to which the second tithe is brought, while its use and disposal after the destruction appears only at the very end of the tractate (5:7: "If a man has produce at this time [Hin pn]"). Most of Tractate Bekhorot, on the other hand, discusses bodily defects, which are relevant particularly to the postdestruction reality, in which only defects can make the first born animal fit for priestly consumption. Here, Temple times appear as a clear exception (4:1: "During the time of the Temple [wipnn ny^rn] ... it is permitted"). Thus, while Ma'aser Sheni discusses bazeman hazeh as an atypical case, in Bekhorot, it is bishe 'at hamikdash that appears as the exception. The picture is thus far from being unequivocal, demonstrating the urgent need for a more systematic mapping of the various factors operating in the Mishnah. Only such a mapping would enable scholars to seriously engage the basic questions regarding Temple ritual and law: How much of it stems from Temple traditions? Is there any identifiable linguistic or stylistic difference between the mishnaic presentations of laws currently in effect versus laws whose observance has fallen into disuse? What is the role of different generations (Yavneh, Usha, and later second-century sages) in reconstructing Temple rituals? The same holds true for other stylistic traits in the Mishnah: casuistic versus apodictic laws, lists versus general rules, and so on. In each case, we should ask, where does the Mishnah use one style and where the other? Is there any ident ifiable pattern? Is it a question of chronology, genre, literary variation, or some combination of all the above? New tools engender new tasks. Because we have already tasted the fruits of the new studies, we cannot be satisfied with impressionistic generalizations anymore. We should move forward to more systematic works on a series of specific textual studies aiming at a broader synthesis regarding the Mishnah. A study of one single tractate, thorough and innovative as it may be, cannot tackle these questions. Only looking at the larger picture will allow us to evaluate the place of the second century house of study in recreating mishnaic Temple rituals. In summation, I have discussed two case studies of current Mishnah research: recent applications of orality studies to rabbinic literature, and several readings of Temple rituals in the Mishnah. Although very different in nature, both share the same basic gesture: returning to "old" questions on the nature of the Mishnah in order to shed new light on them through novel approaches and methodological tools. Orality studies gives us new insight 248</page><page sequence="15">Orality, Narrative, Rhetoric into questions of the redaction and transmission of the Mishnah, while utilizing tools from cultural studies challenges us to rethink the antiquity and historicity of various mishnaic traditions. What is more, in both cases, the new analyses became possible only through the combination of large agendas, contemporary methods and theoretical tools, and concrete text-centered philological research, thus beginning to break the artificial wall, characterizing previous research, between philology and cultural studies. There is much work ahead of us, but after reading the studies mentioned here, I believe we are on the right track. Ishay Rosen-Zvi Tel Aviv University Tel Aviv, Israel 249</page></plain_text>
