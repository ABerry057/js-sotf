Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College Press, 1988. 505 pp. The core of Raphael Jospe's Torah and Sophia: The Life and Thought of Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera is a critical edition and annotated translation of</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 101 Falaquera's Sefer ha-Nefesh ("Book of the Soul"). The text and translation are preceded by an explanatory discussion of Falaquera's psychology based on his Sefer ha-Nefesh and other writings. Yet Jospe's book is not only a work on medieval psychology, it is in addition a treasurehouse of informa- tion on Falaquera, replete with lengthy citations and translations culled from the full range of his writings. Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera (ca. 1225-1295) was one of the few important Jewish philosophers of the thirteenth century. Although recognized as a gift- ed Hebrew poet, Falaquera's greatest contribution to Jewish literature was as a translator, disseminator, and interpreter of medieval Islamic and Jewish philosophy. Falaquera, as Jospe points out, was not an original thinker, but "the breadth and depth of his knowledge of Judaism, philosophy and science qualify him as an important figure in the development of Jewish philosophy" (p. 1). The nature of Falaquera's contribution to Jewish philos- ophy is certainly evident in Sefer ha-Nefesh, which in its careful blending of texts by leading Islamic philosophers, primarily Avicenna and Averroes, is representative of Falaquera's works. Jospe's book begins with a chapter on Falaquera's life and times; chapter 2 lists and discusses his works; chapter 3 presents Falaquera's views on various subjects; and chapter 4 analyzes Falaquera's psychology. Five appendices follow: A contains the text of Sefer ha-Nefesh; B, the transla- tion; C, notes to the translation; D, the first printed edition of Falaquera's Shelemut ha-Ma'asim, a short but valuable treatise on ethics (I have identi- fied an unexpected Arabic source for this work in a forthcoming essay in Maimonidean Studies); and E, a collection of citations with translations from Falaquera's lost commentary on the Bible, retrieved from Samuel ibn Sarsa's Meqor Hayyim. Jospe concludes his book with a bibliography and indices. A Hebrew-Arabic-English glossary is not provided, and would have been very helpful. Torah and Sophia is a work of ponderous scholarship, laudable attention to detail, and profuse documentation. Jospe rarely seeks shortcuts. For example, rather than simply refer to parallel and source texts in his notes to the translations, Jospe often quotes them in full, provides an English trans- lation, and cites page references to several manuscripts. In his studies, Jospe exhibits familiarity with the full range of Falaquera scholarship and builds upon this work, always attentive to credit his sources. Jospe's Sitzfleisch is perhaps most apparent in his important chapter on Falaquera's works. Here his account of the various works far exceeds that of his predecessors. He describes the works, notes modern editions and translations, draws upon a</page><page sequence="3">102 BOOK REVIEWS wide variety of scholarly studies, and outlines the structure of certain texts. In the case of Falaquera's as yet unpublished encyclopedia, De'ot ha- Pilosofim, Jospe offers a very helpful nine-page analytical table of contents. Appendix E, referred to above, is a bonus for the reader, and completes the picture of Falaquera's literary activity (one correction [see p. 459]: Fala- quera does indeed refer to a planned commentary on Ecclesiastes in Iggeret ha- Vikkuah). Jospe's attempt, however, to chronologize Falaquera's writ- ings (pp. 31-33) runs into difficulties and is not convincing. For example, it is not clear that Falaquera's list of books in Sefer ha-Mevaqqesh is itself chronological, nor that his references to Sefer ha-Nefesh in Sefer ha-Ma'alot are to his own book by that name, and not simply to Aristotle's De Anima. Jospe's edition and translation of Sefer ha-Nefesh are commendable. The six previous editions of the text are all based on a single Vienna manu- script and plagued with significant misreadings (see pp. 266-268). Jospe's critical edition is eclectic, based on eight manuscripts, "as well as the evidence of the sources, in comparison with parallel or similar passages in De'ot ha-Pilosofim" (p. 268). The sources are primarily texts on the soul by Avicenna and Averroes. Passages from these texts are translated by Fala- quera, often literally, sometimes at length and sometimes in abridged form, and sometimes skillfully connected with other texts. These same passages and combinations of passages often appear in the De'ot. The result is that both the sources and the De'ot emerge as potentially decisive testimonia for determining the text. Jospe recognized their importance, but it would have been helpful to the reader had he included in the apparatus to the text the instances where these testimonia support or question his readings (e.g., De'ot confirming the errors of omission in MSS t ,T ,: to 289, 11. 25-26, and MSS T, ,;1 ,a to 291, 11. 14-15; and Avicenna's al-Najah supporting the variant additional phrase in MSS t ,f ,: to 317, 1. 4). Jospe provides a brief statement of the relationships among the manuscripts, but no attempt is made to draw a stemma. It seems to me after a cursory examination of the lengthier omissions in the manuscripts, most a result of homoeoteleuton, that the manuscripts stem from two hyparchetypes, each capable of preserv- ing correct readings not present in the other. In short, Jospe's choice of an eclectic text is fully warranted, particularly in view of the testimonia of the De'ot and the Arabic sources. Jospe's translation gives due care to technical terminology. A few terms could, however, have been translated with greater precision. For example,</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 103 fnkuo (translating the Arabic khatgah) is often best translated as "property"; '~nnv'a (p. 307) should be translated as "homonymous" rather than the more general "equivocal"; Pn;rn7 em, mrn eil;a or ,apn , Innn (p. 307) refers to "the homeomerous bodies"; nmi and nir (p. 301) are not syno- nyms, and should not be translated by the same term ("proof'); and ntan (p. 308) should be translated as "blending." Jospe's discussions of Falaquera's teachings indirectly raise the question of the extent to which the texts and passages translated by Falaquera express his own opinons and his own phraseology. Jospe's inclination is to treat the quotations no differently from Falaquera's own words. Thus, for example, Jospe writes: "Although Falaquera's own usage of the term [Dln] is virtual- ly exclusively in a religious context, he does refer to the term in its broader political context, and defines o'oin, n x5 as the art of politics [better: the art of laws or lawmaking], 'the ability to put into effect political actions which are beneficial in reaching happiness'" (p. 27). The definition (as well as the surrounding discussion) is translated by Falaquera from Alfarabi's Kitdb al-huraf (Mahdi edition, p. 152). Similarly, Jospe writes that Fala- quera "quotes Plato to the effect that poetry does not lead to wisdom but away from it" (p. 16), but the passage that cites Plato is a translation from Alfarabi's Philosophy of Plato (Mahdi trans., p. 56). Jospe writes: "as Fala- quera puts it, logic is to the intellect and intelligibles as grammar is to language and words" (p. 154), where in fact it is Alfarabi "putting it" in Falaquera's translation from the Ihd' al-'ulim (Madrid, 1953, pp. 23, 32). Jospe concludes his discussion of the prophet as philosopher-king as fol- lows: "The political function of the prophet-philosopher-king is thus well- established for Falaquera. The true art of politics consists of the study of those things which lead people in political union to felicity" (p. 113). Here Jospe paraphrases Falaquera's translation of a passage from Alfarabi's Tahsil al-sa'adah (Mahdi trans., p. 24). In these and similar instances Jospe has certainly not done any wrong. If Falaquera chooses selectively to trans- late Alfarabi or any other thinker and if there is no evidence to the contrary, we may consider that he shares the views propounded. Yet one cannot help wondering if and where Falaquera differs from his sources, and this can best be determined by carefully examining (as Leo Strauss began to do in "Eine vermisste Schrift Fartbis") what he omits from them in his translations and where he modifies or departs from them. The same question of Falaquera's indebtedness to his sources emerges from Jospe's detailed notes to Sefer ha-Nefesh. He cites or refers us to Fala-</page><page sequence="5">104 BOOK REVIEWS quera's sources as well as parallel passages in De'ot, but the "cf." with which these references are invariably prefaced does not clarify whether the reference is an exact translation, paraphrase, parallel treatment, or some- thing else. By not sharing his knowledge with us, Jospe leaves all but the most industrious reader ignorant of the extent to which Falaquera uses his sources, and the extent to which Sefer ha-Nefesh and De'ot duplicate, paral- lel, and differ from each other. Jospe's general outline of sources (pp. 182-184) and the ensuing discussion in chapter 4, although helpful, do not resolve these issues. Torah and Sofia is the fourth work on Falaquera to appear in the last few years, a fact that bespeaks the growing appreciation for this hitherto unheralded figure. In light of Jospe's praiseworthy effort in this book, we can look forward with anticipation to the realization of his announced goal of a critical edition of the De'ot (p. 48).'
