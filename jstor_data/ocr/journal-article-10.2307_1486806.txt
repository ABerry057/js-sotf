New York: Harwood Academic Publishers, 1991. xi, 220 pp. Judicial Deviation in Talmudic Law by Hanina Ben-Menahem inaugu- rates a series, Jewish Law in Context, sponsored by the Institute of Jewish Law at Boston University School of Law. Ben-Menahem's work analyzes an unusual feature of talmudic jurisprudence: cases in which judges ruled against accepted halakhic norms. Western legal systems have not allowed such discretion, except where the law is obscure, insufficient in its instruc- tions, or generative of various solutions. Ben-Menahem's seven chapters present his methodology; the nature of talmudic case reports; some prototypical cases of extralegal considerations in judgments; a claim that the Palestinian and Babylonian talmudic tradi- tions differ over the acceptability of judicial deviation; principles which opposed extralegal considerations; power-conferring rules which allowed judicial deviation and their limitations; and his conclusions. We may gather a sense of the work's strengths and weaknesses by concentrating on some of ben-Menahem's case analyses. Given the halakhah's fluidity in the talmudic period, what is Ben- Menahem's definition of talmudic judicial deviation? The case of a "kid- napped bride" (B. Yevamot I 10a) serves as one example. A fatherless female minor was betrothed by her mother or brothers. Thus, her marriage had status in rabbinic law but not according to the Torah itself. When she reached her majority, her husband decided to consummate the marriage ful- ly. While she was seated on the bridal chair, another suitor kidnapped and married her. R. Beruna and R. Hananel, two of Rav's students, were pres- ent. They declared the marriage to the kidnapper invalid, leaving the woman free to remarry without a divorce. This ruling, however, contradict- ed Rav's dictum which granted legitimacy to the kidnapper's marriage. According to Ben-Menahem, Rav's students should have regarded his rul- ing as the binding norm. Regarding this case, "R. Ashi said: he [the kid- napper] acted improperly, therefore they [the Beth Din] treated him im- properly and deprived him of the right to a valid betrothal" (B. Yevamot I10a). R. Ashi's declaration that the kidnapper was "treated improperly" indicates a judicial deviation from the norm based on an extralegal consider- ation. Ben-Menahem, of course, cites many such cases, among them Gittin</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 117 40a-b (pp. 50-54), Yevamot 107b (pp. 56-60), and Ketubot 49b (pp. 61-66). Given the chaos judicial deviation can cause to a legal system, Ben- Menahem seeks its parameters in his fifth and sixth chapters. Chapter 5 deals with cases which appear to oppose judicial deviation. Ben-Menahem argues, however, that these cases are exceptional. For exam- ple, he analyzes Simeon b. Shetah's objection to Judah b. Tabbai's view, pertaining to capital cases, where conviction is only possible on the testi- mony of two witnesses, that a false witness may be executed even if there was no corroborating second false witness and therefore the defendant would not have been found guilty. Ben Tabbai sought by this ruling to uproot the Sadducean view that false witnesses deserve execution only if their victim has been executed. The Pharisaic halakhah allowed the witnesses' execution if the accused was convicted, but only when both witnesses were false. Ben- Menahem, citing IHazon Yehezkel, a twentieth-century traditionalist com- mentary, claims that Simeon b. Shetah rejected Judah b. Tabbai's deviation because it uprooted one Sadducean view while supporting another. Ben- Menahem himself suggests that Simeon b. Shetah refused to accept judicial deviation when it led to capital punishment for ideological reasons, but accepted it in other cases. Thus, Ben-Menahem concludes that there is little sustained general objection to judicial deviation. A similar approach marks chapter 6. Here Ben-Menahem finds limita- tions on "power-conferring rules" which appear to license regular deviation from the halakhic norm. If limitations were nonexistent, then judicial devia- tion would be a meaningless term. One power-conferring rule that Ben-Menahem explores is shuda de- dayyaney, a procedure whereby the court makes an award to one of many claimants when the truly legitimate recipient is unidentifiable. According to Ben-Menahem, even if the court exerts "strong discretion" and make its award based solely on its own criteria, its prerogatives are limited to (1) fac- tual cases with no resolution (2) judged only by qualified judges (3) who applied shuda de-dayyaney only during judgment, not as post factum justifi- cation (pp. 157-158). Hence, shuda de-dayyaney allows judicial deviation only in highly circumscribed cases. Ben-Menahem argues that all "power- conferring rules" are similarly circumscribed. Thus, judicial d~viation is a real phenomenon. Ben-Menahem's work is generally fine, but not fault-free. There are digressive excursuses which blur otherwise clear presentations (e.g., p. 78, par. 2; pp. 81-82; and p. 95, par. 3). Also, his methodology and interpre-</page><page sequence="3">118 BOOK REVIEWS tive treatment of sources is somewhat uneven. For example, Ben-Menahem violates one of his own methodological principles, namely, that he engages only in jurisprudential analysis, not historical reconstruction (p. 7). Yet in his analysis of the Simeon b. Shetah-Judah b. Tabbai dispute (see above, and pp. 100-107) he cites Hazon Yehezkel's attempt to reconstruct the his- torical reason for Simeon b. Shetah's objections. He himself attributes to Simeon b. Shetah another reason for objecting to Judah b. Tabbai's views. Ben-Menahem rests his claim that this case is exceptional on these historical grounds. Ben-Menahem also shifts between academic critical-historical method and more traditional rabbinical interpretive styles as if they shared a unified conception of rabbinic sources. For example, in his discussion of a case of an informer (pp. 113-118), Ben-Menahem uses contemporary philological method to prove that a particular talmudic passage is a post-amoraic addi- tion to an amoraic discussion (p. 116, and nn. 63-65). Relying on this, he argues that the case is one of judicial deviation. Yet, in the same chapter Ben-Menahem uses traditional arguments to neutralize the apparent oppo- sition of certain halakhic midrashim to the Babylonian Talmud's acceptance of judicial deviation. He argues, for example, that the Babylonian Talmud's lack of most of these midrashic citations shows that "the Sages rejected them." He also tries to reduce the halakhic midrash sources to the "ideal" and "aggadic," i.e., non-normative. The talmudic cases, on the other hand, reflect the "real" and are therefore analogous to normative halakhah (p. 123). Many of these contentions are questionable from an academic perspec- tive. The fact that the Babylonian Talmud does not cite certain halakhic midrashim does not necessarily mean that the "Sages" rejected their view- point. The Babylonian Talmud's redactors may not have possessed these baraitot (see R. Tam in Sefer Hayashar; Ch. Albeck, Mebqarim Bi-Vraita ve-Tosefta), and, at any rate, the "Sages" and the Talmud are not equiva- lent. Finally, there are many times that the halakhic midrashim are used to justify and support normative halakhah in the Talmud. Their status cannot be reduced to aggadah or merely "the ideal" in a coherent fashion. Despite these criticisms, Judicial Deviation in Talmudic Law is a fine con- tribution to the modern study of talmudic jurisprudence and one of its important phenomena. It directs our attention to the sometimes-differing claims of law and justice. Ben-Menahem, a scholar who shows competence</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 119 and integrity in his work, offers us insights into how the talmudic heritage tried to arbitrate those claims.
