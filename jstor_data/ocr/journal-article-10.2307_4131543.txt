Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999. ix, 335 pp. The scope of research devoted to the entrance of European Jews into the modern civic realm has expanded steadily in the last two decades. Historians have 387</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews turned their attention to communities formerly considered only marginally impor- tant because of their small size, their location at the periphery of Europe's most significant political and cultural developments, or their failure to correspond to the models of emancipation and enlightenment derived from the historical experience of French and German Jews. This new direction in Jewish historical writing has generated an ever-increasing body of social-historical data and is marked by a growing emphasis on regional factors, particularly urban-rural differences, and a new appreciation for class and gender as categories of analysis. The result-a more highly nuanced picture of modernization-has firmly discredited the dominant Germanocentric perspective favored by previous generations of historians. Now, thanks to the publication of Lois Dubin's outstanding book, The Port Jews of Habsburg Trieste, our understanding of the forces that shaped modern Jewish society and culture has been advanced appreciably. Dubin has succeeded in pro- ducing a balanced reassessment of much of the conventional thinking about peri- odization, modernization, and the role of Haskalah and Emancipation. Dubin's study of the north Italian Jewish community of Trieste in the eigh- teenth and early nineteenth centuries rests on an exhaustive investigation of the po- litical, socioeconomic, cultural, and intellectual realms. Its primary objective is to reconstruct the complex relationship between the state and the Jews. Dubin ana- lyzes the efforts of the absolutist state to reform the Jews' legal and political sta- tus and carefully demonstrates how these developments and the process of internal transformation, particularly with respect to communal institutions, cultural orien- tation, and religious behavior, were so crucially intertwined. Her second goal is to relate the foregoing to the larger context of modern Jewish history. Dubin places the unique story of Trieste within a broadly conceived comparative-analytical framework; in so doing, she has brought greater clarity and precision to the rela- tionship between socioeconomic change and legal equality, and to the distinction between acculturation and ideological change. Trieste offers a splendid case study of modernization. The Jewish commu- nity was formally constituted in 1746, although the ghetto had been established a half-century earlier. Its rapid population growth-by 1818 it had become the largest religious-ethnic minority in the city-coincided with the dramatic expan- sion of the Trieste economy. Encouraged to settle in Trieste to assist in the devel- opment of the free port, the Jews received economic privileges no different from those enjoyed by the city's other residents. They were permitted to own real and movable property, and to be occupied freely in commerce, manufacturing, and ar- tisanship. Roughly half of Trieste's Jews were engaged in international commerce and finance, and the most successful Jewish merchants assumed a leading role in the city's commercial firms. The most fascinating aspect of Trieste, and ultimately its most instructive, was its multifaceted cultural and political identity. Politically, the northern Adriat- ic port city was under Habsburg control, but culturally it remained Italian, a dual- ity that Dubin has approached with considerable perspicacity. By investigating the relationship between the royal authorities in Vienna and their representatives in Tri- este, Dubin skillfully charts the main policy considerations in the absolutist state and, more importantly, the mechanics of policymaking throughout the regimes of 388</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Maria Theresa, Joseph II, and Leopold II. Her analysis of Jewish efforts in 1779- 1780 to reach the executive level of the Borsa dei Mercanti-the trade association that mediated between the merchants and the government-reveals the conflict- ing views of Viennese and Triestine authorities, concerns over the growing promi- nence of the Jewish commercial class among the city's elite, and the limits of Vienna's power. Vienna supported the Jewish argument that exclusion from the ex- ecutive board violated the principle of equal opportunity so fundamental to the free port, and eventually Karl von Zinzendorff, the governor of Trieste, was persuaded that the Jews could not be deprived of this right, though the majority of Christian Borsa members objected. Dubin shows how this relatively small matter exempli- fied political differences between Vienna and Trieste, and local Jewish-Christians tensions as well. On the basis of correspondence between government authorities and the Jewish communal leadership, Dubin has masterfully reconstructed the intensive deliberations concerning the attainment and maintenance of privileges contained in the Statute of 1771, which set the stage for Joseph II's far-reaching toleration edicts. Her discussion of Joseph's toleration policy toward the Jews is most im- pressive. In addition to providing a valuable comparison of the edicts issued sep- arately for each part of the monarchy in the 1780s, she offers important insights into the three-way negotiations between the Trieste Jewish community, Zinzen- dorff, and the central authorities in Vienna, showing how each formulated its po- sitions and how the local context demanded certain adjustments in the legislation. The Edict helped create a new climate of opinion that eventually enabled Triestine Jews to join the executive ranks of the Borsa, and, generally, confirmed that these economic rights verged on political power. These and other facets of the legal and economic standing ofTriestine Jewry are all firmly grounded in extensive research in the government and community archives in Trieste and Vienna, and are consis- tently presented within the general socioeconomic and political context. The foregoing advances, and the tensions they occasionally engendered, were characteristic of a type of community that Dubin has fittingly designated as a "port Jewry," of which Amsterdam, Bordeaux, Hamburg, Livorno, and London represent additional examples. Shaped by state efforts to promote maritime com- merce, such Jewish communities were valued for their contributions to the com- mon good, and they were therefore not expected to submit to the process of radical transformation demanded in typical Ashkenazic settings. Owing to the religious and cultural diversity that was characteristic of port cities, the Jewish population encountered less hostility than elsewhere. The notion of economic utility, imbued with the moral dimension of virtue, made it possible for Jews to be included in the civic realm without undergoing political emancipation. One may legitimately ask whether conditions in Trieste and other port cities were so exceptional as to ren- der their histories inapplicable to the experiences of the vast majority of Jews in Europe. While port Jewries enjoyed conditions that diverged from the moderniza- tion experienced by more mainstream Jewish communities, their distinct stories decisively expose the inadequacy of the dominant explanatory paradigm. In Du- bin's book this idea, though not new, receives its most thorough substantiation to date. But more importantly, her detailed analysis of the relationship of the state and 389</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews the Jewish community, and of the Jews' response to their changing economic and political milieu, clarifies how the usual paradigms work under diverse circum- stances, and thereby sheds light on the larger European picture. By examining the Jewish community's response to the cultural implications of economic change in late-eighteenth-century Trieste and to political develop- ments in the Habsburg Empire, Dubin makes her most important contribution. Ini- tially, she shows that the state had already displayed interest in the education of Trieste's Jewish youth a decade before Joseph II issued the Edict of Toleration. Maria Theresa's Statute of 1771 outlined provisions requiring the community to supervise the examination of teachers and students and to ensure that the youth study Italian and German; in 1776 attempts were made to extend normal school- ing to Jews in Trieste and elsewhere. Seeing continuity between these tentative ef- forts and the subsequent establishment of the Jewish community's own normal school in 1782, Dubin turns her attention to the relationship of the community to the Berlin Haskalah. While Trieste's support for educational reformer N. H. Wes- sely is well known and has been amply documented, it has never been adequately assessed. Dubin is the first to subject the corpus of letters exchanged between com- munal leaders and Wessely, and especially the views of Rabbi Formiggini and his rabbinic colleagues, to an in-depth investigation that is informed by local and Hab- sburg politics. Her analysis reveals that although their support for the inclusion of general studies in the school curriculum was unwavering, the Trieste rabbis could not agree either to the attempt to delineate an autonomous realm of human knowl- edge as separate from Torah studies or to any effort that might diminish the pri- mary status of the Torah. While their endorsement of the Haskalah was qualified, their defense of modern education acknowledged its undisputed economic and so- cial utility, as well as its compatibility with the contemporary and historical expe- riences of Italian Jewry. Dubin has convincingly demonstrated that although Triestine Jewry emerged as an exponent of Haskalah and was viewed in central Europe as the embodiment of its ideals, Wessely's Trieste supporters were not maskilim in the conventional sense. Rather, "this was a case of convergence, not identity, and of mutually rein- forcing but essentially independent trends" (p. 136). In Trieste, a different dynamic was at work. In contrast with the situation in Ashkenazic communities in middle Europe, cultural openness in Trieste was not a product of a rupture with tradition, but was continuous with the Italian ideal of the rabbi-poet-doctor that personified the much-revered synthesis of general and religious studies. Trieste's positive self- image and affirmation of the Renaissance model, together with the process of ac- culturation that was endemic to all port Jewries, rendered the adoption of an ideology of cultural transformation unnecessary. With this portrayal of the Tries- tine Jewish community, Dubin has taken a middle position between historians who define modernization in ideological terms and those who see it as the functional equivalent of acculturation. The culmination of Dubin's efforts is her chapter on the Habsburg marriage reforms and the challenges they posed to religious and communal autonomy. To test the reaction of Trieste's leadership to the stresses and strains of modernization, she reconstructs and analyzes two cases of individuals who contested Judaism's 390</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews traditional laws of marriage, one involving a father who objected to the marriage of his daughter on the grounds that she was a minor according to Habsburg law, and the other relating to a request by a kohen and a divorcee to marry civilly. In the first case, the father tried to evade the Jewish community and Jewish law by petitioning the state to annul the marriage. Ruling that Jewish law could not over- ride the civil law of the state, Vienna pressured the rabbi, Raffael Tedesco, to de- clare the marriage invalid. However, the rabbi's unwillingness to comply with the state's demand was strongly supported by the community's lay leaders, and ulti- mately the father was forced, out of concern for his daughter's future marriage prospects, to withdraw his objection to divorce. In the second case, the state simi- larly upheld the couple's request for a civil marriage ceremony, against the strident opposition of communal leaders. Dubin's painstaking description and discussion of these complex issues in Jewish law are first-rate, as is her analysis of what was at stake for the individuals concerned, the community, and the state. With these detailed accounts, and the erudite explication that accompanies them, Dubin offers readers entree into a world that is rarely seen from up close. An elegantly written work of mature and thorough scholarship, The Port Jews of Habsburg Trieste represents a critically important contribution to understanding the multifaceted and multitextured interaction of the state and the Jewish commu- nity at the dawn of the modern era.
