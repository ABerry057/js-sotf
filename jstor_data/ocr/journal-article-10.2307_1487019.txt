<plain_text><page sequence="1">98 BOOK REVIEWS John Day. Molech: A God of Human Sacrifice in the Old Testament. Univer- sity of Cambridge Oriental Publications, 41. Cambridge: Cambridge Uni- versity Press, 1989, ix, 115 pp. The meaning of the term molek has been subject to debate since 1935, when Otto Eissfeldt, in his Molk als Opferbegriff im Punischen und Heb- riaischen und das Ende des Gottes Moloch, connected it to the Punic mlk, which he saw as a sacrificial term. For the last fifty-five years scholars have debated whether the biblical references to a cult of molek pertain to human sacrifice to a deity named Molech or to child sacrifice in general. They have also argued about whether the terms associated with the biblical molek allow for the possibility of an animal as a substitution for a human victim. This book reevaluates the comparative and biblical evidence associated with these positions, and argues that biblical Molech was an underworld deity, equivalent to the god Mlk of Ugarit and to the Akkadian Malik. The book has four substantive chapters: "Molech: Divine Name or Sacrificial Term?" (pp. 4-14), "The Nature of the Molech Cult and the Meaning of Tophet" (pp. 15-28), "The Background and Identity of Molech and His Relationship to Yahweh" (pp. 29-17), and "Passages Where Allu- sions to Molech Have Sometimes Wrongly Been Found" (pp. 72-81). In addition, it contains a concise introduction (pp. 1-3) and "Summary and Conclusions" (pp. 82-85) and a very useful appendix, "Classical and Patris- tic References to Phoenician and Carthaginian Human Sacrifice" (pp. 86-91). The book is generally well structured; it might have been improved, however, by having a short chapter examining the few biblical texts which explicitly mention Molech.1 The book as a whole presents a very plausible, but not a definitive thesis. Day's treatment of the Punic evidence is convincing; he synthesizes the material clearly and notes that mlk there is a general sacrificial term (pp. 4-9). He then uses context, not etymology, to independently investigate the meaning of Molech in biblical sources (pp. 9-13). This principle of favoring context to etymology is very sound, but Day's arguments are not fully per- suasive. For example, he notes that the verbs used with Molech are typically used in the Bible with deities, not sacrifices (pp. 10-12). However, as Day himself notes, these verbs are predominantly, but not exclusively, used with 1. Contrast in this regard George C. Heider, The Cult of Molek: A Reassessment, Journal for the Study of the Old Testament Supplement Series 43 (Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1985), pp. 223 ff.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 99 deities, so in reality his argument suggests strong probability rather than certainty. He further argues that none of the ancient versions recognize Molech as a sacrifice, so it must refer to a deity (p. 12). This carries little weight, since there are many cases where the versions no longer understand the original meaning of a Hebrew word or institution.2 In sum, Day's argu- ments that Molech must refer to a deity are not fully compelling. He has established the probability, but not the certainty of his thesis. If we accept that the biblical molek is a deity, the next fundamental issue is to evaluate the meaning of its use with the verb h'byr; specifically, need it suggest that the person is killed, or does it allow for the individual to be symbolically passed through a fire without being consumed? Day states, "There can be no doubt that the Old Testament itself understands the terms [h'byr b'sl in the sacrificial sense" (p. 15). However, it is uncertain whether h'byr b's means the same thing in every context. Day is certainly correct that the context of Ezekiel 16:21, which uses s4g in conjunction with h'byr b's, suggests that the term there refers to actual sacrifice. But this need not always be the case.3 Day's argument that Molech victims were killed is further defended by the association of s'hty hyldym in Isaiah 57:5 to mlk in 57:9. This is problematic, since it is based upon a possible but not certain emendation of melek to molek, and presumes without proof that vv. 5-9 are from the same pericope.4 Furthermore, Day's discussion of "rabbinical views on the nature of the Molech cult" (pp. 20-22) is not very helpful, and his lack of facility in rab- binics is reflected in the awkward reference to the "early fourth century Rab Abaye" (p. 21). Day does not fully consider general theories of biblical scholarship when making certain philological arguments. This is seen most clearly in the sec- tion entitled "The Old Testament Evidence for the Canaanite Origin of the Molech Cult" (pp. 29-31), where he argues that the Bible associates Molech worship with Canaanite practices, so it must be Canaanite rather than 2. The extent to which the LXX is guessing the meaning of the Hebrew rather than reflect- ing an accurate tradition has been summarized recently by Emanuel Tov, "The Septuagint," in Mikra, ed. Martin Jan Mulder (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1988), pp. 169-171. 3. See Moshe Greenberg, Ezekiel, 1-20, Anchor Bible (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1983), p. 281. This important work is lacking from Day's bibliography; in general, his biblio- graphy and notes overemphasize minute philological studies at the expense of biblical commen- taries. 4. The commentaries are divided on whether these verses are from the same pericope.</page><page sequence="3">100 BOOK REVIEWS Aramean. However, the biblical texts which make this association include the Holiness Code (Lev 18:21), the redactional layer of the Deuteronomistic history in Kings, Isaiah 57, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel; these are all late. It is thus quite possible that in reality Molech worship was appropriated from Arameans, and late pre-exilic and exilic biblical texts which tend to always blame the Canaanites have incorrectly attributed it to Canaanites. Day's incorrect assertion forces him to prematurely reject a possible connection between Molech and the Aramean deity Adad-Milki (pp. 41-46), though his own conclusion that Molech = Ugaritic mlk = Akkadian Malik (pp. 46-55) is also quite plausible. His interpretation could have been strength- ened by a more detailed treatment of the religious aspects of child sacrifice and their connection to chthonic deities. The skepticism found in Day's treatment of verses incorrectly assigned to Molech (pp. 72-81) is welcome. However, Day seems not to have noticed that most of these "incorrectly assigned" passages are early, so the implica- tion of their rejection is that Molech may not be attested to in the Bible before the exile. This would have very important implications concerning the origin and extent of Molech worship in Israel, but Day has not noted this. In sum, the issues surrounding Molech worship are not resolved in this book. It provides a useful, clearly written summary of previous scholarship, and presents detailed technical arguments in a very clear fashion. However, the arguments that it adduces are often not fully compelling. It has not adequately paid attention to literature found in biblical commentaries and to general biblical issues, such as the dating of biblical texts. Finally, it has not directly engaged the horror of child-sacrifice or explored why it was practiced. In this regard, Heider's monograph (see n. 1), which explicitly raises the question "[So] why did the parents do it?" (pp. 383, 407), is a more compelling treatment of the problems associated with Molech. Marc Z. Brettler Brandeis University Waltham, Mass.</page></plain_text>
