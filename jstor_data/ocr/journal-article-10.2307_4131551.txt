Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College Press, 2003. x, 264 pp. Think of the intensity and notoriety of Sylvia Plath in the English-speaking world, and multiply it several times: that is Yona Wallach for the Hebrew-speaking world today. The most passionate and flamboyant figure in postwar literary Israel, Wallach was born on a small farming village in 1944, lived there most of her life until her death of breast cancer in 1985, and after her death has become a cultural legend. In life Wallach experimented with sex, drugs, and madness (she checked herself into a mental hospital in 1964 and remained for three months, deliberately exploring what the subconscious yielded), was a compelling live performer of her poems, and was typically surrounded by worshipful younger writers. In her art she was yet more experimental. Her poetry combines mysticism, sexuality, an ecstat- ic love of nature and a correspondingly powerful mistrust of society and its con- ventions, a fascination with language and the breakdown of language, an insistence on the validity of freedom and will. Steeped in biblical allusions, mythology, fairy tales, and kabbalistic imagery, she often twists and turns her sources with playful or violent irony. Her lexicon swerves through extremes of exaltation and crude- ness. Her verse sometimes is traditionally rhymed, more often unpredictably and jazzily ragged, her imagery is often surreal, her narratives elliptic, her syntax frac- tured-yet thrillingly readable. While Zafrira Lidosky Cohen's bibliography lists numerous reviews and es- sayson Wallach's work, and a best-selling biography, hers is only the second full- length book on the poet. Unlike Lily Rattok's more exclusively feminist study, Angel of Fire, Cohen casts a wide net. Contextualizing the poet in terms of the waves of modern Hebrew poetry since Bialik, she gives due weight to Wallach's female forebears, especially Dalia Ravikovich and Dalia Herz, and to the themes of female struggle and sexual war that form a major thread of Wallach's writing. But she also tells us that Wallach was ravished by Walt Whitman's expansive cre- ative energy. Ultimately, she does not see Wallach as a poet of victimization but as a poet of triumphant self-exploration. Again, although her study makes massive use of postmodern literary theory, Cohen argues that Wallach rejected the post- modern view of language as merely socially constructed, trapping us in "petrified meanings" (p 41). For Wallach, language is potentially sacred, issuing from the depths of the unconscious, which in an early poem "unfolds like a fan" ("The Un- conscious Unfolds," quoted on p. 85). In one of her last collections, Wallach writes, "Let the words act in you/let them be free/they will enter you inside/making forms upon forms ... because they are nature and not an invention/ and not a discovery for they are yes nature" ("Let the words," quoted pp. 36-37). That words are al- ways "pregnant with meaning" for Wallach, "is never in doubt," Cohen declares. Cohen rightly claims that Wallach's poetry is layered and often duplicitous in its meanings, showing in many cases how surface sense becomes inverted when we pay attention to the allusions. In "Cornelia," for example, a girl seems to be pas- sively exploited by the devil who makes her "pick nettles" and then by "men" who "did to her" because of her "nettle rash." But Cohen points out that Cornelia's name contains the root for the Hebrew krn, "radiate," used of Moses when he descend- 410</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews ed Sinai, and alludes as well to the Greek myth of Core, who became queen of Hades. Citing the one use of "nettles" in the Bible, Isaiah 55:13, "instead of the nettle shall the myrtle tree come up," Cohen argues convincingly that we can see this poem as one that celebrates Cornelia's sexuality and mocks both devil and "men." In another poem, "Cecilia," Cohen finds allusions to multiple biblical and talmudic sources. The ecstatic and frightening nocturnal vision of "And We Were Like Lunatics" is both filled with allusions to prophecy and clairvoyance and an account of the discovery of a divine self within. Wallach's famously provocative and often violent erotic fantasies, like "When You Come to Sleep With Me Like God" and "Tefilim," are at the same time meditations on politics, on spirituality, and on the possibilities of "authentic existence" beyond the constraints of biology. Cohen's close-reading strategies are a powerful aid for anyone who hopes to probe the complexity ofYona Wallach's work. Even where one disagrees with specific interpretations, Cohen forces the reader to think beyond the obvious. The method works less well with Wallach's late poetry, in which the poet abandoned dramatic situations and indulged herself in ambitiously philosophical streams of con- sciousness that seem to defy coherent analysis. Many of these poems are simply too long for close reading. But Cohen is surely right in her general claim that how- ever nihilistic the poems may seem at first glance, their actual aim is "to destroy and recreate, wreck and establish, annihilate and reconstruct" a "transcendent re- ality" (p. 219). Any future critic of Yona Wallach will have to reckon with this strongly argued book. Alicia Ostriker Rutgers University New Brunswick, New Jersey 411</page></plain_text>
