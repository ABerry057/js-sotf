As a pioneering theologian, sociologist, and teacher of American Judaism in the twentieth century, Kaplan (1881-1983) stood as a towering figure at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City, where he worked for a good deal of his very long life. Yet even with the publication of his groundbreaking work Judaism as a Civilization (1934) and his popular following, he felt marginalized and embattled throughout his life. To help manage and defend those professional conflicts, Kaplan turned to his journal to record his personal stmggles and anxieties. These diary entries offer important clues to the ways he discovered and created an American Jewish identity through the art of journal writing. Mel Scult, the editor of Kaplan's diary musings, has compared this "universe of words" to Kaplan's penchant for mapping out ideas and his reluctance to turn vision into practice. The diary, Scult concludes, "is another dimension of his in volvement in words, not things."1 Yet Kaplan personified his journal as a material friend through whom he could engage and explore his ever-present desire to create something permanent. The very materiality of language offered Kaplan relief from the fear of creative failure and hope of securing a home in America. To rephrase Scult's critique, those words were Kaplan's things, and he embodied what he calls his "self-aspect" in the material journal. In the following study, I propose to view Kaplan's act of journal writing as a cultural strategy of belonging in America. For Kaplan, the journal allowed him to "externalize and render transferable" those most personal features of the self. Fru strated by repeated attempts to instill those features in his children, Kaplan instead turned to his journal as a material substitute. To the journal, he would transfer his desires and fears; but he could also create there more lasting impressions of the self. In this way, disclosing the self in writing satiated his longing for a presence and home in America. By creating a distinctive personality in the diary entries, 1.

Within those diary pages, he carved out space for expressive fulfillment: a performance of the self as a form of self-exposure. Kaplan's readers would become witnesses to his claim to America; the journal, in turn, would become a material archive of Kaplan's life. Indeed, Kaplan believed that only his journal verified his life as a real and meaningful one?so much so that he worried the journal would be misplaced or, worse, never read and so quite easily forgotten and discarded. This sense of displacement, expressed so frequently within the journal, parallels much of Kaplan's own personal history. Bom the same year of the pogroms in Russia, Kaplan immigrated with his parents as part of the first wave of eastern European Jewish migration to America in the 1880s. The anxious exposures of place, dwelling, and home, all so prevalent in Kaplan's diaries, echo much of the immigrant Jewish experience. The increasing nativism in 1920s America marked immigrants as foreigners, an overt attempt to protect American culture from dangerous outsiders. Displacement and loss surface from within the Jewish presence in America, as they do in Kaplan's journals. Despite all this, immigrant Jews like Kaplan imagined a country open to their yearnings for a better life. Kaplan's passion for the diaries?they could fill twenty-eight volumes, each of 400-500 pages in length2?reflects his acute desire to archive the self in America: to create a permanent home and inheritance for himself and others. The desire for presence in the journals exposes the possibility of failure: Writing may not fully express the human personality, Kaplan might not recover his identity "from oblivion," and even more, the immigrant Jew could very well remain alien and homeless in America. Kaplan feared that his journal as material archive would never appear or that it would be displaced by other forms and soon forgotten. This sense of self as a material commodity, one as ephemeral as pro ducts in the open market, haunted Kaplan's diary and his identity as an American Jew. A consuming culture might very well devour the self and render the material archive as absent rather than fully present. To better recover Kaplan's fear of material loss, and the importance of establishing a permanent dwelling in America, I turn to Derrida's understanding of the archive in his perceptive analysis of Yosef Yemshalmi's reading of Freud.3 The ontological pressure to create a per manent thing?what Derrida calls archive fever?tormented Kaplan throughout his life, but nowhere more acutely than in his journal. This story of arrival and loss is also a narrative about urban life in New York, where commercial interests, billboard advertising, leisure enticements, and the frenzied mix of cultures invaded and became part of Kaplan's own American experience. Kaplan landed in America in 1889, a young boy who had lived his 2. At this time, only one volume of his journals has been published, with two more volumes intended for publication in the near future. 3.

As a student and later a teacher at the Jewish Theological Seminary, Kaplan developed what he hoped would become a recon structionist program for the burgeoning Conservative movement in America. When the seminary proved too confining for his expansive program, Kaplan reluctantly gave shape to the new Reconstructionist movement that would estab lish its own rabbinical college, compose new prayer books, and build synagogues for an increasingly devoted community. But these creations would arrive after Kaplan's more foreboding thoughts in the 1920s and 1930s, when the concern for permanence and the anxiety of absence loomed large. Social historians of this period?Andrew Heinze, Jenna Weissman Joselit, and Riv-Ellen Prell chief among them5?can help us situate Kaplan's works within this Jewish cultural moment in America. In doing so, they reveal how Kaplan's diaries remain part of the immigrant narrative in New York at a time when material consumption and social enticements carved out defining Jewish experiences. Cultural tensions surface in Kaplan's writings because he displayed moder nist and immigrant obsessions with self, place, and home. Yet much of the interest in Kaplan has focused on his theological, philosophical, and sociological theories. To be sure, his disavowal of a personal God who commands, as well as his visceral denial of the special claims of a chosen people, have not won wide acceptance from American Jews, even within the Reconstructionist movement. But rarely, if at all, have scholars turned to cultural studies to enliven and explore Kaplan's modernist dilemmas. This essay attempts to draw cultural studies into the orbit of American Jewish thought in order to enrich both material studies of religion and philosophical accounts of self-fashioning.6 To do this, I have divided the essay into four sections: the journal personified; the journal as art; the journal as material archive; and the American journal. Each section maps out the cultural significance of Kaplan's journals for American Jewish identity. The immigrant Jewish experience amplified, and in many ways determined Kaplan's thought. As Kaplan searched for home, he relied on material products like his journal to 4. Scult, Judaism Faces the Twentieth Century, 19-27. 5. Andrew R.

Cultural studies is a broad term that has taken on numerous meanings. In this essay, I use the term to designate fields of inquiry that focus on human acts of cultural significance?home building, economic and material practices, literature, identity formation, and art. For some representative works in these fields, see Kenneth Ames, "Material Culture as Non Verbal Communication: A Historical Case Study," Journal of American Culture 3 (1980): 619^41; Marc Manganaro, Culture, 1922: The Emer gence of a Concept (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2002); and Michael North, Reading 1922: A Return to the Scene of the Modern (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999).

The Journal Personified Autobiographical writing, as William Spengemann and L. R. Lundquist argue, produces a self by employing common cultural myths and images. The author "sees himself through cultural categories and so "creates for himself a recognizable identity.7 But as Elizabeth Podnieks observes, the boundaries between autobiography and diary writing have been obscured in the modernist era.8 The diary, like the autobiography, includes "internal closures and sum mations," provides "structural and thematic patterns," and is "a consciously crafted text." Rather than a secret, private work, the diary is a public text designed for a particular audience: It is a kind of "private-diary-as-public-text."9 Kaplan's diaries provide an illustrative example of journal writing as public performance in which an author crafts a text as a spectacle for others to observe, interpret, and treasure. Kaplan edits his entries throughout the journal, often adding sentences in the margins, and even referring to other journal sections that related to his present entry. His strong editorial hand?rewriting and repositioning sentences, correcting punctuation, including notes in the margins?reveals an author who understands his text as a public work to be read by others: This is, to be sure, a "consciously crafted text." Even more, Kaplan would review the typed copies of his handwritten diaries and correct those editions when stylistically necessary.10 All this suggests a kind of private writing intended for public con sumption. This public face of the diary emerged along with the reflective, expres sive individual in Renaissance and Enlightenment currents and became critical to the modernist preoccupation with self-fashioning.11 Journals provided a material medium in which to render and create the self in words. As Kaplan's obsessive writing becomes increasingly darker, clouded by insecurity and doubt, the diary captures his modernist desire for self-fashioning.12 Kaplan always admired those who wrote books, and even more those who secured each moment of the day for their professional duties. He would not defend 7. William Spengemann and L. R. Lundquist, "Autobiography and the American Myth," American Quarterly 17, no. 3 (1965): 502. 8.

Surrounded by colleagues who churned out significant works in Jewish studies and relatives who succeeded in business, Kaplan found little solace in returning to his diaries, again and again, to compensate for his lack of physical work or more lengthy written treatises. He chided his passion for diary writing as a leisurely desire, unbecoming of a serious academic scholar?and certainly not for one who aspired, as Kaplan surely did, to admira tion and devotion from his students and congregants. Idleness, in the form of retreating to the diary, suggested failure. For Kaplan longed to create something of permanence, some physical and material reminder that he mattered?both to those he cared for and to future generations of American Jews. Journal writing became a conduit for exploring this anxiety of presence and the ways in which written words render the self visible and alive. The diaries confirmed for him that he had created something durable and unique. This is why I call it a "perform ance," for Kaplan explores and fashions his identity through the material script and enacts this identity through his writing on the journal pages. He struggles to reveal how the impressions of writing?the enduring markings on the page?could manifest a real, embodied personality of importance. Kaplan turned to words to alleviate his sense of loneliness and failure. When on vacation on the Jersey shore in 1916, Kaplan recalled how much he enjoyed the fresh air and sunshine away from his home in New York City. He chafed at the material abundance and wealth of city life. Finding housework vulgar, he often associated the city with filth and cheap tastelessness.13 But kitsch aside, the summer days on the shore offered health and a sense of leisure that was often missing from urban decadence.14 Yet distant from the oppressive urban air, Kaplan could not fully enjoy his luxury?a recurring modernist anxiety. He com plains of his "solitude and isolation" in what he imagined as a prison, where "the days and the weeks are passing by without my achieving anything." City life offered something else entirely: a community of speakers in which Kaplan "at least [had] occasion to interchange a word with somebody." The city retained its appeal for Kaplan despite its filth and chaos. Away from New York, Kaplan admits, "I am all alone."15 It is noteworthy that Kaplan associ ates the failure of achievement with the absence of discourse. Without "a human being who is interested in or troubled by problems similar to mine," Kaplan cannot 13. Scult, Communings of the Spirit, 13-14, 127. 14. Kaplan shared much with other modernists who disdained the unhealthy working conditions of urban factories and the suffocating reign of technology, bureaucratic rationality, and capitalist pro duction in the city. This was as much aesthetic critique as social commentary, for, like other modernists, Kaplan sought some modicum of experiential meaning to counter the "technocratic promise" of Fordism that seemed to straightjacket self-fulfillment. For the most telling examples of these views, see Clement Greenberg, "Avant-Garde and Kitsch," in Art and Culture: Critical Essays (Boston: Beacon, 1961), 3-21; Oswald Spengler, The Decline of the West (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991), 24-25, 245-54; and Warren Susman, Culture as History: The Transformation of American Society in the Twentieth Century (Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press, 2003), 71,93-95, 107,237-51. 15.

Achievement means "to interchange a word with somebody"; failure is that sense of loneliness in which the productive word lies dormant. On that Saturday night at the Jersey shore, Kaplan turned to his journal to write a meaningful word, to engage "a word with somebody," even if that body is the journal personified. Scult notes Kaplan's propensity for describing his journal as a friend, reflected in this diary entry in 1929: "As on previous occasions I shall resort again to this diary as though it were an intelligent friend to whom I could communicate what I am stmggling these days to formulate."16 Melissa Klapper notes that young women in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century also "treated their diaries as emotional confidantes" and often confessed their "inner feelings" in those pages.17 Indeed, young girls personified their journals in order to relieve their loneliness, and they, like Kaplan, could explore and express themselves most fully in that material medium. For Sandra Rubin, fifteen years old in 1955, her journal captured her "tme self," and she remained stubbornly loyal and committed to the diary.18 This is certainly tme for Kaplan as well. Trapped by the failure of work and the prison of isolation, Kaplan domesticates his diary as that embodied friend with whom a word is both possible and meaningful. One senses the all-embracing seclusion of a writer yearning for meaningful words. Yet the journal proves a poor substitute for his friends in the city. Kaplan expresses profound ambivalence about journal writing and the significant time he devotes to the practice. He is admittedly ashamed of the diary as a compensatory substitute for human friendship. He often remarks of time better spent studying the Talmud than marking his journal.19 Yet it is precisely these opportunities for self-expression that so burden Kaplan: Writing which records first hand experiences, however crude it be, it seems to me ought to have more value than formal writing in which we merely add to the endless discussions about this or that abstract concept. That journal writing "ought to have more value" suggests it does not, both for Kaplan and his professional colleagues. Kaplan himself obsesses over his lack of production and, at forty-six years of age, shamefully admits he does not have one significant book to his name?and blames his time with the journal for his professional infertility.20 Three years later, in 1930, while working on Judaism as a Civilization, he returns to this trope and anxiety: "I am like a woman who constantly miscarries. Is it a wonder that I am green with envy when I see some 16. Ibid., 35, 341. 17. Melissa Klapper, Jewish Girls Coming of Age in America, 1860-1920 (New York: New York University Press, 2005), 13. 18.

But the journal serves as his source of friendship, and it transposes his self into a material medium. Although he "miscarries" often (to use Kaplan's gendered rhetoric), at least he does not prostitute himself by "spreading" throughout the learned periodicals. His manliness finds expression in his diaries?even as diary writing has been traditionally the literary outlet for women.22 He is envious of his colleagues, to be sure, but Kaplan's personal experiences really are more valuable for their intense "aura," as Walter Benjamin would call it.23 His journal is no miscarriage: It is masculine writing that gives birth to the material self. Kaplan attempts to reclaim some notion of the unique (and male) personality in the material practice of journal writing. This performance of the male self is of crucial importance for understanding Kaplan's journal. Kaplan was more the prophet than priest?more a man of words, as Scult would have it, than of things. But words were Kaplan's things: They were the permanent material objects of his creation. They embodied his thoughts, pas sions, and self. Yet Kaplan often complained of his failure to do "more permanent work"?the kind of work that would make a lasting impression.24 Could the journal be that kind of thing? Could it retain the weightiness of permanent cre ation, of lasting mark and evidence of the embodied self? Kaplan is none too sure: I do not know why I find it so hard to write about myself. But as I think of it I really do know why. It is this terrible urge to do something worth while which leads me to regard as wasted every movement that I spend without improving my knowledge or mental power. I live inwardly as though I had but a short time to live and wanted to accomplish something substantial before it was too late. I suppose most people who combine mediocrity with inordinate ambition are always in a hurry.25 Here again, Kaplan refuses the luxury of self-expression in diaries and craves the status and respect of professional accomplishments. His ambitions lead beyond the journal to build communities and compose great academic works. The anxiety of writing, as expressed in this diary entry, is the anxiety of finirude itself: "It appears to me that even death makes no impression upon our type of people. And fool that I am I expect a sermon of mine to leave a lasting impression!"26 To perform the self in this life is to leave an inheritance for others. Kaplan's journal is his material 21.

I want to emphasize just how much ofthat legacy occurred within Kaplan's diaries. Kaplan would become the American male by inscribing his self within the pages of his journal. Indeed, Kaplan described his diary as "the stmggle for self expression by means of the written word." This sense of exploring or mining the self in writing captures Kaplan's imagination, and he finds solace that perhaps his own words may compensate for his failures in academic life: For the last hour and a half I have been writing aimlessly [in my diary] only to find some compensation for my frustrated hopes and ambitions. Would I not have employed that time to better advantage if I had worked on the paraphrase translation of the Midrash of Shir Hashirim [Song of Songs]? From one point of view the answer should be an emphatic yes.... On the other hand, no one but myself could write my diary. Whether what I have to say is wise or foolish, interesting or boring, it is the attempt of a personality to save itself from inarticulateness and oblivion by the mere skin of its teeth.27 Academic work attracts Kaplan for its prestige and admiration?qualities that Jewish men coveted from their coworkers and families. Kaplan's frustrated hopes and ambitions could be realized through intensive work in Hebrew trans lation. But he recognizes that "anyone ... could do that work." He could not inscribe or reveal his personality in that kind of writing. But in his diary, the self's "struggles are entirely its own and no other person in the world could know them and record them."28 This is the self-made American male, the lonely individual before faceless conformists. It is the dream of the unique person ality, created and determined by "no other person in the world." It is the wandering Jew who, in the very fashioning of home, secures a place to rest. Saved from oblivion, Kaplan constitutes his identity within the written word, which exposes the frustrations and hopes of a male Jew becoming American. The journal is Kaplan's own; it is his claim to America. A translation of midrash captures some other self; journal writing fashions a home because it mimics the American practice of the individual, authentic self. The journal was not the only material medium Kaplan employed to establish a claim on America. In October 1929, Kaplan describes his work on a bust of his father. He had shown the piece to the painter Joseph Tepper, who pointed out some minor faults with the figure. Only months earlier, Kaplan had thought it ridiculous to play with clay. But now he bristles at Tepper's critique: "Faults or no faults before I started to remodeling it[,] it bore a perfect resemblance to father." Kaplan set out to mold an exact likeness, and, as he tells it, [S]pent about twelve or thirteen hours on it. I was up till 3:30 in the morning. I simply could not tear myself away from it until I managed to retrieve the 27. Ibid., 314. 28. Ibid. 116</page><page sequence="9">Mordecai Kaplan and the Art of Journal Writing resemblance to father, and in this I succeeded only by restoring the very face lines that Tepper criticized most severely as not being human.29 There are surely deeper psychological issues at play in creating a likeness of one's father than mere fascination with material objects. Yet note Kaplan's arrival as master artist?not by dismissing Tepper's critique but by materially revealing the critic's incompetence. For the bust only resembles Kaplan's father when he restores the lines that Tepper suggested he remove. Kaplan had it right from the beginning, and he stays up all night to prove himself worthy?and more artisti cally perceptive?than the professionals (those other "fathers"). And it is precisely this sense of competence and superiority that Kaplan misses from his academic work. There, he feels ashamed by his lack of scholarly publications, and he con siders what he has done only frail cobwebs amid more solid, sturdy pieces. But in creating a material object of stature and resemblance to the real, Kaplan under scores the divide between thought and things: "I wish my literary tasks and studies could have such a grip on me as this modeling."30 Artistic work has this kind of grip on Kaplan because it is a material thing that retains a lasting impression. For Kaplan, academic studies are flights into Jewish utopia. But a clay model, or a journal that exposes the self, are permanent objects of enjoyment and passion. He discovers and performs his manliness in creating material things. Kaplan need not succeed in business: His prestige and competence arrive through material productions. In short, Kaplan does things with things, and this material practice exposes a very different personality than the one who competes for academic distinction. Through art, Kaplan discovers his competence, loyalty, and a sense that he has arrived despite what more established critics might suggest. He is at home in his art. The Journal as Art For Kaplan, art cultivates the expressive self and renders it in some material form. Art does not reimagine the world, or even the self, as some Utopian possi bility. Its power lies in adequately describing the nature of things: The ancients had an idea that to know the name of a thing or person was to be in a position to exercise control over that thing or person. Somewhat akin seems to be the work of art. Its points describe and articulate the innermost aspects of the environment and of our own natures, thereby enabling us to put them under our control.31 To name the animals, as Adam does in Genesis, is to rule over them. It is to act with authority and clarity of purpose. So, too, Kaplan claims here, for the work of art. In 29. Ibid., 369. 30. Ibid., 370. 31. Ibid., 257. 117</page><page sequence="10">Ken Koltun-Fromm aesthetic creations, the artist maps out the natural and human terrain, and in doing so, he controls both the real world and the inner life. Like Kaplan's clay pieces, art creates a "perfect resemblance" to the world and ourselves, and it grabs us with its immediacy. Kaplan understands his journal in much the same way as a noble attempt "to save itself [the personality] from inar ticulateness and oblivion." Journal writing is artistic work because it exposes the "innermost aspects" of the self and thereby gives expression to it. By exposing the self, the journal names and locates the human personality and so enables its material expression. The self becomes what it is through Kaplan's description of it in his journal. It is an artistic mode of self-fashioning.32 For Kaplan, journal writing is a work of art. Artistic works play a central role in Kaplan's understanding of Jewish experience. In Faith and Ethics (1954), a text written in Hebrew, Kaplan argues that art helps us achieve our deepest human strivings and goals and that Judaism is a kind of artistic performance.33 He explores these issues as well in his 1956 work Questions Jews Ask, a text that responds with "reconstructionist answers" to contemporary concerns.34 Kaplan encourages the arts as part of his program for an enlivened Jewish civilization. But he recognizes that some might consider this "putting the cart before the horse." Should we not revive the Jewish spirit in order to invigorate the arts, rather than the reverse, as Kaplan suggests in this text? To justify the expansion of the arts for contemporary Jewish practice, Kaplan explains that "all art presupposes a deep emotional experi ence, of which it is the expression."35 The Hasidic movement offers one telling example, for as a "popular religious revival of great emotional intensity, [it] left a permanent impress on Jewish culture in literature, music, dance, the theater and other arts." Note, to begin, the return of the "permanent impress" in Kaplan's discussion. Art retains a lasting imprint when it revives a strong emotional experience. But art also helps to strengthen that experience and "stimulates emotions akin to those which produced it."36 Emotions find their material expression in art, and in turn, artistic works produce new emotions and experi ences. In this way, Jewish art can enliven the Jewish spirit, even as it is produced by that spirit. Art becomes the expressive medium for cultural production and meaning.37 Kaplan harbors an expansive notion of the arts, one that includes literature, performance, and the plastic arts, as well as other cultural modes of expression. When asked what he means by the term "Jewish art," Kaplan responds with a spacious account: 32. See Greenblatt, Renaissance Self-Fashioning. 33.

Since it is the function of art to give significant and abiding expression to human experi ences, whatever does that for Jewish experience may be considered Jewish art, whether the work be that of a Jew or a non-Jew.38 One could very well ask, what would not count as Jewish art in this definition? Kaplan's functional view widens the capacity of the arts to become the emotional trigger of cultural life. Art creates a lasting impression on human experience. Whatever does that for the Jewish experience is Jewish art. But this functional account relies on a psychological principle: Kaplan believes that deep emotional experiences require an outlet. Without material expressions, those emotions "might otherwise subside and leave no permanent effect." The arts "keep alive those experiences," enable us to recognize them as our own, and help "stimulate new emotional responses."39 We become fully human in and through the arts, and we develop our emotional lives and experiences by creating lasting artistic expressions. Yet Kaplan is attuned to public opinion, particularly to the perception that Jews have never been keen on the arts or, for that matter, very good at them. Why should contemporary Jews emphasize the arts when they "[have] played a very subordinate role in Jewish civilization?"40 Without taking stock of the justice of this attack,41 Kaplan merely accepts it, only to argue for the necessity of Jewish artistic expression in the modern world. Kaplan echoes what Jewish cultural elites, in the years before and during the interwar years, had been pursuing with some vehemence. In Jewish newspapers, they sought to "train the Jewish race in aesthetics" in order to cultivate Jewish creative artists and, perhaps most crucially, transform Jews into cultural pioneers.42 Undertaking this cultural agenda, Kaplan argues that in the past, religion unified Jews across cultural and political divides. All Jews, Kaplan claims, retained similar beliefs and practices. But those days are gone, for "with freedom of thought, inevitably comes diversity of belief." How, then, can modern Jewry recoup this lost unity? Some "other influ ences must fill the vacuum" created by this loss of religious unity: "The spirit to animate the communal organism will derive from their cultural activities, among which the arts will have to figure prominently."43 Modern art, as that preeminent cultural expression of human emotions and experiences, will "create a common 38.

Art is what Kaplan calls a modem "functional equivalent" to religion. Rein terpretation, in Kaplan's functional method, is a "process of finding equivalents in the civilization to which we belong for values of a past stage of that or another civilization."45 One must identify basic human needs and then discover how to satisfy them with a modem expressive form.46 The arts are that form for modem Jews, so Kaplan believes: By utilizing Jewish tradition and Jewish community life for the development of ethical standards and aesthetic content, Judaism can give the modern Jew a spiritual culture that would be the equivalent of what the Torah meant for his fathers.47 Like traditional religion, the arts unify the emotive experiences of Jewish life. As that common modem currency of cultural expression, art has "the power of uniting us in this generation with our forefathers." Journal writing, I now want to argue, is one way to save the arts for the Jews. In a fascinating journal entry in May 1931, Kaplan asks, in a rather stilted way, how "to render [the] self-aspect of our individual polarity transferable from our own bodies to other bodies."48 It is a question concerning human finitude and our desire for a lasting expression of the self: The desire that our children should cherish our traditions and ideals is essen tially the desire to transfer to them our self-respect as well as bodily aspect, thereby assuring ourselves a form of survival which is as near to personal identity and continuity as is possible in the face of the fact of death.49 Personal identity expands through time, even after death, to include the lasting impressions that we create in our children. What lies behind these thoughts, however, is Kaplan's anxiety that his children will not "cherish our traditions and ideals." Indeed, he is bitterly disappointed with his Jewish life at home: I'm a failure not only in the Seminary and in the S.A.J. [Society for the Advancement of Judaism], but even in my own home. Despite all my yearn ings to beautify Jewish life, to enrich it with song and poetry and dance, I do not get the least cooperation from any member of my family. I had hoped that 44. Ibid., 370. 45.

I thought that my children would ask me to read or speak Hebrew with them. All these dreams of mine have proved to be nothing but illusions. It seems that I am doomed to live out the rest of my days in a sort of prison made for me by aspirations and tastes which separate me from my own wife and children.50 Kaplan's desire for survival?his need to render features of the self permanent and lasting?rubs against the apathy of his familial relations. His children, to be sure, bear the brunt of Kaplan's frustrations. They are his children, after all, and thus should know better. One senses even professional embarrassment, as if the indif ference at home only confirms his failures in academic life. Securing male prestige proves both maddening and futile "in a sort of prison." It is the kind of captivity that makes the fact of death certainly more real, and ever so personal. Yet it is nonetheless crucial that Kaplan's prison is an aesthetic one, informed by "aspira tions and tastes" that seclude him in isolation. Domestic Judaism, "even in my own home," is an artistic experience of song, poetry, dance, and taste. If Kaplan cannot live through his children, then perhaps he can do so through other means. All too aware that he is "succeeding very little in getting my children to take over my self-aspect," Kaplan allows them to "have their way." He partially blames himself for this collapse and claims "not [to] possess the ability to externalize my personality by means of song, story, poem or paint ing." Those kinds of artistic expressions do not fully capture Kaplan's personality. But his journal does, and it becomes Kaplan's artistic medium for transferring his emotions and experiences to others: "In my frustration, I turn to writing in this journal as the only means left me to externalize and render transferable that aspect of my being I experience as my soul, self or reason." Journal writing is Kaplan's exposure of self to others. It is his art, his capacity to express personality in a material medium that creates a lasting impression. He can "render transfer able" constitutive features of his personality. As Kaplan realizes, "no one but myself could write my diary." Precisely so?for the journal captures the individual personality as an artistic, lasting, material presence. The Journal as Material Archive That sense of permanence, of transferring the self through journal writing, gives rise to the anxiety of finitude all the same. Kaplan exposes those fears when, on a train bound for Schenectady, he explores writing in the third person. His daughter Judith had tried this once, but she abandoned the practice when it came across as too superficial. But Kaplan takes it up here, and his reflections are acutely perceptive. He wonders why his craving to write "seized him like a madness." Without paper on the train, he grasps a blank part of a newspaper, and when out of room there, composes between the lines of the text. But this obsession belies a more ominous fear: 50. Ibid., 375. 121</page><page sequence="14">Ken Koltun-Fromm After every such writing spell he would experience a sense of calm as though he had succeeded in accomplishing something that had permanence to it, something, therefore, that rescued his life from the vortex of time. But before long that feeling would vanish. "How insecure our sense of security, how transient our experience of permanence" he said to himself.51 Why did the feeling of calm vanish? Kaplan suggests that even as his madness retreated, it would nonetheless reappear sometime later, and so the craving would continue. And linger. He could never fully rescue his self "from the vortex of time" because it remained too embedded within it. The experience of permanence is momentary?a temporary calm before the maddening storm returns. This is, I believe, an intensely capitalist form of desire, in which Kaplan sati ates his yearnings in a thing (the journal), only to heighten those desires once again in the very satisfaction of them. The temporality of the commodity form continually excites Kaplan's desires. Kaplan expresses these anxieties on the eve of the Depression, when the speciality of commodities are in full force. His desire to experience perma nence exposes the anxiety of material security. That desire is rooted, I will argue later in this essay, in a process that Andrew Heinze calls "adapting to abun dance." Seeking a home in America through consumption, Kaplan, like many of his fellow Jewish immigrants, believed that permanence could be had through material products. That faith would vanish with the Depression, and so, too, Kaplan's comfort in creating a lasting impression of his self in journal writing. Yet the workings of the capitalist economy already suggest how material products are ephemeral. Could the self be yet another commodity form? On that train bound to Schenectady, the third-person narrative suggests that the self can take on many styles?even impersonal and transient ones. This sense of calm in the printed word, however temporary, eases Kaplan's anxiety of failure "to beautify Jewish life" in the home. To be sure, the anxiety returns, again and again, as that sense of permanence in the material product inevi tably disappears. But the printed medium provokes this serenity in no small part because it is caught up in consumer and mass culture, where it can reach beyond the household to influence countless others. This accounts for the widespread use of the press by religious groups in the nineteenth century, when technological advances and access to new markets through better and faster trans portation allowed print to influence regions beyond the spoken word.52 The thoughts of one nineteenth-century Christian evangelical could very well be Kaplan's own: What is written is permanent, and spreads itself further by far, for time, place, and persons, than the voice can reach. The pen is an artificial tongue; it speaks 51. Ibid., 289. 52. See Ann Douglas, The Feminization of American Culture (New York: A. A.

The pen is a kind of image of eternity?it will make a man live when he is dead.... 53 Writing confers immortality because it outlasts the self?or better, it carries the self forward and beyond. For Kaplan, the journal is not merely an "image of eternity" but its very possibility. So there is another sense of loss noted in the journal entry on the train: the material loss of paper. Kaplan describes a scene in which he frantically searches for scraps, even with texts filled to the edges, so that he can quiet his craving to write. But he cannot silence this primal urge, for failure to write means a loss of self: But I must keep up this diary. It is the only evidence I have that I have ever existed. I need it to counteract the feeling of blankness with which I am often seized. My past is as though it was not so that I feel forced to turn the pages of the diary to convince myself that I have lived. I sometimes feel that we don't have to die to know what death is?in fact, it is then that we don't know. The time that we know it is when we are alive and we try to keep our own past from dying; yet no matter what we do it dies on our hands.54 Driven to write ever more in his diary to prove his existence, Kaplan recognizes he can never do enough. His past will continue to die, even as he writes frantically and often. Kaplan is already dying, as it were, unable to fully capture his own life experiences in his journal writing. The tight link between the absence of diary pages and the feeling of "blankness" tethers Kaplan's sense of self to the material journal. If those pages are blank, then so is the self. The loss of material paper, then, is very much to the point. Without it, Kaplan remains imprisoned in a "feeling of blankness," and he cannot turn the pages to attest to a valuable life. The pages, like his self, are indeed blank without words. The material medium holds out some hope of permanence and continuity, as if Kaplan has invested the thing itself with an enduring presence. The self survives only if the material thing does, too. To counteract that "feeling of blankness," Kaplan creates an archive of the self in his journal. It becomes a material witness to a life lived. The notion of an archive has fascinated modern commentators, especially those who recognize the importance of memory and technology in the production of meaning. Jacques Derrida's Archive Fever is, to my mind, an important work in this area, and it can help us recognize the importance of material products for Kaplan's 53.

Derrida critically appraises Yerushalmi's Freud's Moses,55 but he also offers a fascinating account of archives along the way. In his typically masterful way, Derrida teases out multiple meanings, but he claims that all material archives require a place of domicile "where they dwell permanently."56 This dwelling marks a passage from the private to the public sphere. Among the many emotions that motivate the creation of an archive, one of them is the fear of death: There would indeed be no archive desire without the radical finitude, without the possibility of a forgetfulness which does not limit itself to repression. Above all... there is no archive fever without the threat of this death drive, this aggression and destruction drive.57 For Derrida, we create archives to limit forgetfulness, to hold back the threat of extinction. This sense of the "trace," in which a figure of absence already lurks within the desire for presence, indicates the yearning to archive the self.58 The threat of loss and forgetfulness conditions archive fever. We can certainly witness this in Kaplan's obsession with journal writing. He feels compelled to account for his life, not only for himself, but for others, too. The journal provides that hope for a permanent dwelling within which his self remembers and over comes a radical finitude. But it is a tenuous grasp on presence, for that "feeling of blankness" remains ever palpable and threatening. Kaplan yearns to transfer his "self-aspect" to the journal because, as an archive, it bears witness to a "worthwhile" life. The journal exposes Kaplan's archive fever and the fear of forgetfulness that informs it. Kaplan demands a material archive as a compelling witness to personality. To witness, in this sense, is to offer some marker of testimony, some physical indi cation of existence and meaning. For Derrida, this appeal to testimony in a material archive reflects the desire for absolute presence. Yerushalmi argues that if the Jews really did kill Moses, as Freud indicates in Moses and Monotheism, then the murder would not have been repressed but recorded; that is, it would have been archived in some physical form. But how can Yerushalmi be certain that no archive exists? Why must an archive retain a material, written form, such that the historian can access and critique it? Could there not be virtual archives, or other such deposits hidden from the historian's gaze? According to Derrida, this is precisely what Freud calls for: Freud claimed that the murder of Moses effectively left archives, documents, symptoms in the Jewish memory and even in the memory of humanity. 55.

There are traces and supplements, even sur pluses of meaning that create their own archives of memory. But this worries Kaplan, and so he invests the material archive with a sense of permanence and transparency. Only the physical thing can transfer the self to others, in Kaplan's view. The very materiality of writing and the physical presence of the journal inspire (falsely, in Derrida's view) a sense of permanence and stability. Kaplan's religious faith begins with the hope that material things witness to the presence of a life, and those things transfer personality into the future. The material archive is the only archive for Kaplan that escapes the finitude of existence. Yet as Kaplan discovers on the train to Schenectady, material things can dis appear. If material archives remain the only human option to escape death, then Kaplan fears that even here, we continually die in the archiving of the self: In contrast with the extravagant waste of nature man is jealous of everything he produces. He projects his personality into whatever he creates, and he therefore experiences the agony of dying every time his creations have to be thrown into discard.60 For Karl Marx, the value of our creations lies in the labor we invest in them. For Kaplan, that value resides in the personality, and we experience "the agony of dying" at the moment of material waste. This sense of material loss revives the anxiety of being itself and the possibility of self-annihilation. Kaplan contends that more of us keep diaries because we no longer believe in personal immortality. Eternity can be had only in the transference of the self to others through the material journal.61 Kaplan even imagines a life flooded with diaries, "when the world will be cluttered with so much of this kind of writing that juries will have to be established to decide which diaries may be destroyed." This idea shocks Kaplan, for it means that some diaries will lose their permanent dwelling? which, as Derrida reminds us, is constitutive of archive fever. Kaplan's traumatic fantasy makes explicit an underlying current in his reflections on the self: Personalities have become a kind of commodity to be dis carded and wasted. We have become consumers of the self. In the engine of the market economy, consumption generates waste and overabundance. A consuming culture destroys the self?that "self-aspect" projected and performed in journals. Kaplan compares the process of "condemning the trashy" journals to "whether the victim of an incurable disease should have euthanasia administered to him." To lay waste to a journal is to kill a self: "I can't imagine that any one would have the heart to deliberately destroy a document in which the poor human ego 59. Derrida, Archive Fever, 64-65. 60. Scult, Communings of the Spirit, 485. 61. Ibid., 339-40. 125</page><page sequence="18">Ken Koltun-Fromm flees as to the last refuge from complete death."62 If this is a plea to his readers, then Kaplan begs for a permanent life in material form. Only his journal as permanent dwelling archives his personality and offers some consolation before death. Perhaps journals, and the performance of self within them, can cheat death after all. Compare Kaplan's investment in the archive with Freud's Note on the Mystic Writing Pad (1925), a work composed around the same time as these excerpts from Kaplan's journal. Freud, too, fears the loss of memory, and he believes as well that we can overcome forgetfulness through material deposits that recover memories without distortion. He searches for a medium that will remain perpetually available to new inscriptions without erasing older ones. Freud wants a material archive that continually records the self through a perma nent memory trace {dauerhafte Erinnerungsspur). The mystic writing pad {der Wunderblock) can do just that thing, in Freud's view, because it "providefs] both an ever-ready receptive surface and permanent traces [Dauerspuren] of the notes that have been made upon it."63 Derrida, reading both with and against Freud, focuses on how the writing instrument performs erasures and supplements, "the double force of repetition and erasure, legibility and illegibility." He also alerts us to the technology of memory production and the ways in which a material medium "founds memory."64 This sense of presence and absence, together with the construction of memory, echoes much that we have discovered in Kaplan's journal. For Kaplan recognizes the nearly apparitional quality of his journal in the way that it both performs and hides the self. The ego flees to the journal, but that material object withholds the anchor of presence so coveted by the engaged personality. Yet only these kinds of aesthetic creations capture memories and produce archives, in Kaplan's view. Artistic works?poetry, dance, visual arts?produce selves of sub stance and "taste." Journal writing is Kaplan's artistic medium, and through it, he externalizes his "self-aspect" for others. But Kaplan also worries that the ego really does flee to the journal?entirely, without remainder and distortion. This gives rise to the fear that the self is but another commodity in the open market, with all the possibilities of overproduction and waste. If the journal can produce the self, then the impersonal market can discard it. Kaplan's mystic writing pad exposes the spectral quality of commodities, and the selves marketed therein. Kaplan imagines the day when we will literally lack the "breathing space"65 to preserve all diaries, abandoning the shoddy works in order to save the more expres sive journals. Unable to turn the pages of those less fortunate archives of memory, we 62. Ibid., 340. 63.

His journal must find a permanent dwelling for his person ality so that his personality will survive into the future. As Freud has taught us, virtual archives do not disappear. But material archives do, and so they engender anxieties of finitude. Kaplan's journal is his art, his expressive desire to render inner emotions and experiences permanent and expressive. Without it, his personal ity "experiences the agony of dying" and the forgetfulness of a lived life. The loss of the material archive, so Kaplan believes, would mean the loss of self. The American Journal Andrew Heinze reveals how Jews consumed material products to become American and to secure a home there. As immigrants to a new country, with a strange language and culture, Jews recognized how material goods could signify a changed identity. The study of immigrant consumption, in Heinze's view, reveals how groups adapt to new social conditions. Jews adopted "habits of consumption" that imitated American practices,66 and Kaplan's journal fits within this paradigm of becoming American: It is an identifiably American journal. As Kaplan moves from immigrant to middle-class American, his journal marks his arrival and claim to an American Jewish identity. Surrounded by the variety and plenty of desirable goods, Jews, like most Americans, "expressed their hopes for advancement through the consumption of things that suggested a more secure social position."67 The term suggested is important, for that security would be frustrated by a rising nativism that denied assimilation through consumption.68 But many of these immigrants believed they had left nativism behind in eastern Europe, and they imagined America as a new promised land of opportunity. And savvy businesses marketed those oppor tunities directly to immigrants. Installment plans allowed Jews to buy on credit those luxury items once thought to reside beyond affordable means. As more pro ducts became available, the possibility of "immediate acquisition" only hastened the transformation of desire into need.69 Jews believed they could identify with America by becoming good consumers, and they could repeat this practice over and over again as new commodities came to the market. In this endless supply of circulating products, Jews appropriated those habits of consumption that would identify them as comfortable middle-class Americans. Jews negotiated their anxieties to become Americans through the consump tion of material products. Heinze recounts a "novel ritual" during Passover?"the dumping of household furnishings into the city streets"?as Jews improved their standard of living. Jewish immigrants would buy new Passover dishes and 66. Heinze, Adapting to Abundance, 7-8. 67. Ibid., 30. 68.

Jews were "greening themselves out" as they upgraded "their level of material life in the manner of urban Americans."70 The purchase of the parlor organ, too, signified that Jews had made it in America.71 The piano dominated the music scene well into the 1920s. It corresponded with the rise of Tin Pan Alley and the marketing of sheet music, but it also symbolized the values of hard work, domesticity, and moral integrity.72 The piano enabled Jewish children, especially girls, to become refined middle-class citizens.73 But the anxiety always remained that, despite American assurances, con suming products would not transform Jews into Americans. For these Jewish immigrants really could not afford a piano, although the installment plan allowed them to purchase one. And it barely fit within the small confines of most tenement apartments. The dumping of household goods into the streets during Passover, and the display of new clothes and furniture (in which, according to Heinze, both the poor and the affluent participated), could only provoke the tension that, as Jews invested their identity in material products, those products could be wasted, lost, and discarded. Jews, in other words, could fail to become Americans because, even as dedicated consumers, there is always more?more products, more desires, more anxiety. They might never consume enough, let alone what they required to live a decent life. Jewish consumption is an anxious performance of the self to become American. Kaplan, too, is an American consumer, and we can see this in his journal writing. His intense desire to produce something of value, permanence, and "lasting impression" remains part of this story of American consumption because Kaplan yearns for security among material products. If, as Heinze claims, Jews consumed in order to become American, then Kaplan also creates products for others to consume?and in this, he attempts to overcome his finitude and sense of failure. Immigrant Jews?and Kaplan is one of them?invest their selves in the objects they live with and value. But as the market engine revs up and commodities disappear only to be replaced by new ones, the anxiety of home lessness resurfaces. For Kaplan, it arises in his fear that we will destroy journals for lack of available "breathing space." Without such a place of dwelling, the self dies a second time. Capitalist markets ensure that no thing can presume longevity and safe passage. As Jews consume products to identify themselves as Americans, they become as insecure and ephemeral as the commodity itself. The anxiety of consumption lies at the heart of Riv-Ellen Prell's study of Jewish women and men in Fighting to Become Americans. Prell argues that as 70. Ibid., 83-84. 71.

She reveals, in fas cinating and insightful ways, how class, gender, and race have all shaped Jewish attitudes to each other and their place in America: The Jew was the alien to the nation, avaricious and aggressive. The woman was marked by her desire, in this setting defined primarily by consumer items of fashion and leisure. Her class was marked by the illegitimacy of that desire, wanting those things to which others, but not she, were entitled.74 Both Jews and non-Jews held these sentiments in twentieth-century America, and these stereotypes, to employ Heinze's phrase, reflect the anxiety and pressures on an immigrant community adapting to abundance. In the 1920s, the image of the ghetto girl, who was "garish, excessively made up, too interested in her appearance, and too uncultivated to dress smartly,"75 embarrassed both Jews and non-Jews alike. Her vulgarity reminded Jews that they might not be fully accepted by America's Protestant majority. Merely suggesting a kind of excess and unbounded desire "might more aggres sively enforce their [Protestant] boundaries between insiders and outsiders."76 Jews worried that they lacked refinement, and the ghetto girl's excessive and brash style exemplified the fear that all Jews, in truth, were like her. The stereo types of the ghetto girl, the young Jewish woman in search of marriage, and even the Jewish American princess, are all defined by their excessive and cmshing desires. They are dangerous to Jewish males, who must supply what they demand. In failing to do so?and they could not but fail?Jewish men demonstrate "that they had not yet become Americans."77 And if they could not do so, then the promise of material abundance was a cruel scam played on unsuspecting outsiders. This sense of a con, I believe, haunts Kaplan's journal as well. America really was closed to Jewish aspirations and commitments. So Kaplan had to pry it open by writing himself into American civilization. He would remake America into a home for outsiders. It is a male performance to supply what the ghetto girl (and others like her) requires. But Kaplan's journal is also a witness to his own desire for home. To archive the self, as Derrida reminds us, is to assert oneself as present?to make an impression even on those who reject it. Kaplan's lifelong pursuit for something permanent, something to overcome human finitude and insecurity, belies a desperation to establish a home in hostile territory. The anxiety of journal writing itself?echoed in Kaplan's state ment, "I must keep this diary. It is the only evidence I have that I have existed"?reveals the very tensions that Prell and Heinze uncover in their cultural studies of Jews in twentieth-century America. Kaplan seeks a dwelling in 74. Prell, Fighting to Become Americans, 43-44. 75. Ibid., 23. 76. Ibid., 26. 77. Ibid., 94. 129</page><page sequence="22">Ken Koltun-Fromm America. But he buys a home even though he is aware that the cost might be too high. If the self lives for others in the journal, then the individual personality might become lost or, worse, rendered superfluous. If another journal could take its place, then the self dies once again. Like the dumping of old Passover wares, a new archive will simply replace the old, and the self as a commodity becomes a relic of the distant past. Conclusion In a powerful article about the meaning that things have for us, Bill Brown reflects on how "human subjects and inanimate objects may be said to constitute one another."78 Objects, Brown claims, hold the capacity "to materialize identity." In America, where the "abstract subject of democracy" always remains out of reach, the gathering of objects grounds that identity with "particular content." Brown recounts Mark Twain's grief at the death of his daughter Suzy and the way in which Twain united that death with the loss of a burning house: "Twain grieves her loss through its loss." In coupling the death of a child with the demise of a physical object, Twain illustrated, according to Brown, "the way objects touch souls."79 For early twentieth-century American Jews, and certainly for Mordecai Kaplan, objects touched souls in ways that materialized Jewish identity in the accumulation and consumption of objects. Jews negotiated their place in America through material things and invested those things with their hopes and anxieties for a permanent, stable, and secure life. That possessions could vanish, as they did in the 1929 stock market crash, only witnessed to the very transient and vulnerable dwelling in which Jews resided in America. Kaplan understood this all too well. On a Monday night in May 1929, Kaplan attaches a photo of himself to his diary,80 yearning once again for a material presence: I took this picture this morning on the way from Dr. Spivak to the library of the Union Theological Seminary. I suppose it is vanity that prompts me to have my picture taken or my bust made or to have a phonographic record made of my voice as I tried last Friday. But is there not also an innate desire to want to know more about oneself? Perhaps also the wish to snatch from the ravenous maw of Time something that might endure?if at least for a little while.81 A physical thing?a photograph, bust, or voice recording?reveals Kaplan's plea for immortality as material archive fever. The restlessness of American Jewry that Kaplan observed and sought to overcome only intensified the longing for an object that would, this time, make a permanent impression. 78.

For the immigrant Jew, so Kaplan believed, this search proved especially difficult. Kaplan forever searched for home, and his concept of civilization marked one grand attempt to fashion it in America. Yet, as Kaplan well understood, the Jew in America could never quite be at ease: It is otherwise when I read a piece of Talmud, Midrash, medieval poetry or philosophy. Much of it is arid, barren, even ugly, but it is my cultural home, and this feeling of at homeness is more to me than the actual worth of the ideas or the beauty of their expression. I am utterly miserable when a long period of time elapses without my having an opportunity to read [a] Jewish text, and I am equally miserable when I do read it, because of an awful solitude in which I find myself. I feel like one who comes back to his home town and finds it completely deserted.82 A home in America is a tenuous thing. Kaplan attempted to find and secure it in his journal, and for others through a civilization, but he seemed homeless nonetheless. That sense of modernist solitude, one that Ann Douglas attributes to the "terrible honesty" of the 1920s, disturbs and consumes Kaplan's passions.83 His are the passions of a stranger in a foreign land who, after dwelling within it, can no longer fully return to his now deserted home. Kaplan finds himself in the classical Jewish texts, but those material books also uncover an "awful soli tude" of wanderings and sterility. What I have called the performance of the material self is an ambiguous act of identity formation. It reveals, on one hand, the ways in which objects texture and inform the self. But on the other hand, those things can consume the self to the point that it dies continuously without the object. Kaplan's journal?indeed, the act of writing itself?is a performance of self in and through a material thing. It represents Kaplan's attempt to materialize his identity, to archive the self. The art of journal writing is to make a lasting impression on the things and persons who constitute personal identity. Only then can that awful solitude and sense of abandonment be relieved?if at least for a little while. Ken Kolrun-Fromm Haverford College Haverford, Pennsylvania 82. Ibid., 381. 83.
