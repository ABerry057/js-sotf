<plain_text><page sequence="1">Renee Levine Melammed. Heretics or Daughters of Israel: The Crypto-Jewish Women of Castile. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. vi, 256 pp. The forced conversions of perhaps a third of the Jews of Spain in 1391 pre- sented significant dilemmas for the Spanish Crown, the Spanish Church, and the conversos themselves. While the Church insisted that baptism, even by force, was irrevocable, instructing and assimilating so many converts was a major challenge. Conversos, too, were in a quandary: Some chose to relocate and revert to Judaism openly; others accepted their altered situation and not a few pursued new possi- bilities in Church and public roles; many married their children into Old Christian families. There were New Christians, however, who relinquished neither birthplace nor heritage, choosing to observe Judaism surreptitiously. By the last decades of the fifteenth century, when an increasingly anxious Church encouraged a reluctant Crown to establish an Inquisition directed at conversos engaging in Jewish prac- tices, women had become a particular target. As Renee Levine Melammed ob- 148</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews serves in her detailed and well-argued analyses of Inquisition proceedings against women accused ofjudaizing, "The Inquisitors realized the unusual importance of the home in crypto-Judaism and understood that women willingly became the car- riers of the tradition they viewed as inimical" (p. 15). Melammed's delineations of the interactions between these women and their adversaries in the inquisitorial courts demonstrates the determination of some conversa women to subvert the teachings of the Church and risk prison or death to provide for the Jewish conti- nuity of their families. Melammed divides her analyses of Inquisition confession books and trial transcripts into three periods: the pre-expulsion era from 1391 to 1492, when con- versos could still interact with Jews; the years immediately following the expul- sion, from 1492 to 1550; and the end of the sixteenth century, when New Chris- tians who had been born as Jews were gone but their descendants remained. She points out that the Spanish monarchs justified their 1492 edict of expulsion by ac- cusing Jews of encouraging New Christians to participate in Jewish rituals, prac- tices, and expressions of belief. Melammed finds that Jews did not, in fact, actively proselytize. Rather, conversos who were so inclined sought out and relied on Jews for moral, spiritual, and ritual support, such as providing kosher meat and matzah, and frequently visited synagogues. Moreover, New Christians sometimes provid- ed funds to rebuild devastated Jewish communities and institutions. In one Inqui- sition proceeding, a conversa named Beatriz Gonzalez of Toledo was accused of bathing, cutting her nails, wearing clean clothes, going barefoot, and asking for- giveness of others on Yom Kippur, "and some nights before the Great Fast, she went to the synagogue to see how the candles burned and how the Jews prayed and she heard them" (p. 28). Many confessions to similar acts by accused judaizers leave no doubt that by living in close proximity to Jews, New Christians who wished to continue Jewish practices could easily do so. Melammed notes that following the expulsion, when the converso commu- nity lost its sole source of "Jewish" food, wine, and books, as well as active Jew- ish models, clandestine religious practice inevitably began to diverge from nor- mative Judaism. It is in this period, she argues, that women's domestic activities, including preparing Sabbath meals, putting on clean Sabbath garments, baking matzah, and observing dietary laws, became especially central to crypto-Jewish life as men were deprived of the public domain in which they had traditionally functioned. Indeed, the female commandments of kindling Sabbath lights, burn- ing dough from the Sabbath loaves, and, to the extent possible, niddah observance, emerged as major symbols of crypto-Judaism as women became the primary bear- ers of Jewish culture. Around 1500, a number of messianic visionaries of Jewish ancestry claimed to be prophets bearing a message of salvation specifically directed at conversos. At least two, Ines of Herrera and Mari G6mez of Chill6n, were women, and both preached a return to Jewish practices so that God would take conversos out of cap- tivity and transport them to the Holy Land. Melammed details how the Inquisition acted quickly to condemn and eliminate these visionaries and their supporters, suc- cessfully stopping a movement with obvious appeal to the New Christian communi- ty. She does not explore, however, whether exposure to Christianity, with its many 149</page><page sequence="3">AJS Review female saints and visionaries, might have set the stage for a degree of female em- powerment otherwise all but unknown in Jewish messianic movements. The conversa lived in an environment of suspicion in which virtually any en- counter with an Old Christian could prompt the filing of an accusation with the lo- cal Inquisition. Servants who worked alongside conversa housewives had numer- ous opportunities to observe unusual food preparation and dietary behavior, while the nature of their subservient position often led to resentment towards their employers. In the second part of her book, Melammed analyzes several trials of accused judaizers, detailing the complexity of the legal system as well as the de- termination of inquisitors to quash any perceived judaizing proclivities. In the si- multaneous trials of two women and one man from the same family, she shows how the social interactions of a small town were laid bare as a large percentage of the town's population became involved in or were mentioned in the proceedings. Since the accused were not told who had testified against them, they had to document any possible quarrel, employer-servant rancor, property feud, family vendetta, or sexual intrigue that might have led to their denunciation to the authorities. These tachas, long lists of individuals with possible grievances against the accused, were essential since a witness's testimony could be discredited if an ulterior motive was proved. Melammed discusses the fascinating case of Beatriz Rodriguez, a Castilian midwife. The Inquisition persistently collected information about her over a period of fifty years and frequently summoned her to court. Melammed suggests that ten- sions between midwives and male authority figures, especially clerics, were as in- fluential here as any judaizing by Beatriz. Noting attempts during this period to impose legal limitations on midwives in some Spanish cities, she asks, "Was this conversa midwife a heretic, or was she a strong, independent woman whose actions and attitudes might have perturbed the inquisitor even if she had not been a New Christian?" (p. 145). In 1550, after many years of harassment, Beatriz was forced to submit to a trial at the age of almost seventy. Although ultimately reconciled to the Church and permitted to go home, confiscation of all the property she had ac- quired over the previous fifty years effectively condemned her to an old age of poverty and shame. There seems little evidence that Beatriz herself was involved in any significant crypto-Jewish practices; however, Melammed's final chapter reveals how trial transcripts from late sixteenth-century Alcazar indicate that descendants of conversos in a remote part of Spain still retained a high degree of Jewish obser- vance. While the community undoubtedly included knowledgeable crypto-Jewish men, Melammed points out that, "Alongside them, working in tandem or on paral- lel levels, were their sisters, nieces, mothers, and daughters" (p. 165). Scholarly debates over such issues as how many conversos deliberately re- tained Jewish practices, the proportion of those New Christians denounced to the Inquisition who were actually guilty of knowingly judaizing, the real motivations of the Inquisition in targeting New Christians and the extent to which it did so, and the reliability of Inquisition testimony, much of it obtained under torture, have raged in recent decades. Melammed does not address these controversies directly but as- sumes that the inquisitors were sincerely looking forjudaizers and that most of their accusations had a factual basis. She praises Isabel Garcia, who was able to convince 150</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews the inquisitors of the sincerity of her Christianity, as "a conscious judaizer who beat the system" (p. 44). Yet Isabel's transcript, which reveals a syncretistic merging of Jewish and Christian practices, indicates that the reality could have been more am- biguous. In some instances illiterate and ignorant defendants may have unthinkingly maintained traditional domestic and family customs alongside Christian beliefs. Nevertheless, the details Melammed painstakingly amasses indisputably demon- strate that some conversa women did play central and courageous roles in resisting the attempts of the Church and Inquisition to eradicate their Jewish identification and heritage. Her important and readable book, which includes several appendices of Inquisition documents, demonstrates the significance and usefulness of such records when carefully read and adds new substance and nuance to our under- standing of the role of gender in one of the defining epochs of Jewish history.
