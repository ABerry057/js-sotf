Researchers trained in historical musicology typ- ically use document study, note analysis, and contemporary aesthetic writings to examine how questions of "Jewishness" manifest themselves in the works of se- lected composers. Ethnomusicologists frequently utilize ethnographic fieldwork methods developed for studying musical practices of Jewish communities within a broad cultural and symbolic system. Jewish music researchers in Israel com- monly focus on comparative cultural projects intended to illuminate stylistic or song-based pathways of transmission from one age or culture to the next. Cultur- al theorists tend to situate music as a medium for negotiating the borders between Jews and other groups. And with the lay public in mind, specialists and nonspe- cialists alike have generated numerous popular textbooks claiming to cover "Jew- ish music." Each of these disciplines asks different questions about the nature of sound within Jewish contexts; yet central to all is the question of how the sound it- 5. J. L.

In this review, I will look at books from three trajectories of Jewish music research: Schiller's publication, centered in the methods of historical musicology, examines key Jewish-themed works of three major twentieth-century composers; Katz's presentation of the letters of comparative musicologist Robert Lachmann provides insight into the state of ethnographic music research in pre-state Israel; and Edelman's textbook-consciously aimed at a lay audience-aims to provide an introduction of the field. Studying the music of self-identifying Jewish composers provides research- ers with great challenges: What is significant about labeling these composers as Jewish in the first place? How do sound and identity correspond with each other? What can be said about these composers' non-Jewish music? Perhaps the most significant pitfall is the inevitable attempt to translate written notes into a recipe for Jewishness (see Eric Werner's The Sacred Bridge [1959] and volume one of Sholom Kalib's The Musical Tradition of the Eastern European Synagogue [2002] among many others). Fortunately, David Schiller has managed to sidestep many of these issues in his careful and well-documented study Bloch, Schoenberg &amp; Bern- stein: Assimilating Jewish Music. Schiller, an Assistant Professor at the Universi- ty of Georgia School of Music, uses the multifarious concept of assimilation as the unifying factor in his analyses of Ernest Bloch's 1933 Sacred Service, Arnold Schoenberg's 1946 A Survivor from Warsaw, and Leonard Bernstein's 1963 Kad- dish symphony. Fully aware of assimilation's packed nature within twentieth- century American-Jewish discourse, he examines the meaning of each composer's attempts to fit openly Jewish subject matter into what he terms "non-Jewish" mu- sical forms (i.e., oratorio, cantata, and symphony, respectively). For each com- poser, he claims, this process partook of a different philosophical approach and Jewish/non-Jewish worldview. Although Schiller does not entirely fulfill his book's promising premise, his work is the best I have yet read in seeking and framing ques- tions of "Jewishness" in Western concert music. From the outset, it is clear Schiller has done his research and developed sol- id analytical chops-two factors often lacking in studies of this sort. The thor- oughness of his approach, combined with an engaging writing style, leads to some marvelously informed and well-documented discussions about each composer and his representative work. In addition, by intelligently utilizing a wide range of thinkers to center his study-from Sergio Della Pergola to Francois Lyotard for theoretical background, and Theodor Adorno, Kurt List, Andre Ungar and others for contemporary critical response-Schiller can engage in broader questions of Jewish identity and memory while creating a forum for discussion of Jewish west- ern composition accessible to scholars outside the core of Jewish musicology. The most successful and best-conceived chapter of the book focuses on Bloch's Sacred Service. Schiller's access to Bloch's letters from the time he com- posed Sacred Service help shine new light on the composer's religious outlook and philosophy, and provide several valuable and direct references to his composition- al procedures for setting the service. Schiller then offers a strong sociomusical analysis of the piece, beautifully weaving together philosophical, cultural, musi- 399</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews cal, liturgical, and historical sources to provide fresh insights into the origins, im- portance, and impact of Sacred Service. Schiller's chapters on Schoenberg and Bernstein, while well constructed, fall short of the standard established by the Bloch chapter. This is most noticeable in the background Schiller provides for each composer. As opposed to Bloch's re- vealing letters and deep complex of literature, the material Schiller provides on Schoenberg and Bernstein appears limited mainly to secondary and published pri- mary materials. Schiller struggles to fill in Bernstein's background in particular, often resorting to secondary works written decades after the fact in order to gauge his composition and religious philosophies. Though intelligently arranged, these sources simply cannot provide the same rich, convincing portrait afforded Bloch. Schiller's musical analyses provide for interesting and worthwhile reading; at the same time, they seem overly brief-perhaps due to the rarity with which these pieces have been analyzed in the past. The author's tendency to emphasize one or two main points in each case is illuminating (particularly with the Schoen- berg case, in which he convincingly notes the connection between the use of an augmented triadic figure and an underlying subtext of divinity) but leaves many unanswered questions, as well as a hunger for more detail and nuanced descrip- tion. The Schoenberg and Bernstein chapters also rely heavily on twelve-tone mu- sical analysis; although Schiller takes up such analytical challenge with aplomb, providing solid explanations and strong writing, those readers not acquainted with the twelve-tone system will find these passages opaque. To conclude the book, Schiller curiously begins by juxtaposing a number of passages taken verbatim from earlier in the book. One can only think cynically that Schiller compiled the start of the conclusion for those who do not read the inner chapters; for someone who has read through the whole book, however, they feel like a jarring recap. Nonetheless, once through these pages, Schiller sails along to a brief but thought-provoking conclusion: to Bloch, Jewish music had a racial qual- ity; to Schoenberg, it was intrinsically modern; and to Bernstein, it was by nature postmodern and disjointed. Schiller's presentation clearly makes these ideas wor- thy of consideration, and has hopefully paved the way for others to continue schol- arly discussion of this high caliber. Contributing significantly to another strand of Jewish music research is Ruth Katz, Professor Emeritus of Musicology at Hebrew University. In her book "The Lachmann Problem," Katz fills in one of the most significant lacunae in the story of Jewish music research (as well as the history of ethnomusicology): the tale of Robert Lachmann, comparative musicologist and founder of what is today the He- brew University National Sound Archives. Lachmann has long been regarded as a significant but little-known figure in the Jewish music world. Editor of the first in- ternational journal of comparative musicology, author of the posthumous mono- graph Jewish Cantillation and Song in the Isle of Djerba, and well-regarded authority on Arabic music, Lachman died from a long illness in 1939, cutting short a blooming career and relegating him to the shadows of Jewish music history. "The Lachmann Problem" represents Katz's valiant (and nearly hagiographic) attempt to return the man to his rightful place in Israeli and Jewish musicology. Katz literally tells Lachmann's story in dramatic form. After a compulsory 400</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews introduction providing an undistinguished background on the rise of Nazi Ger- many and the creation of Hebrew University, Katz launches into the Lachmann narrative by presenting three "acts" and an epilogue. In each act, she reprints what appear to be the full (translated) texts of most of Lachmann's extant letters from his files at Hebrew University and The Jewish National and University Library, in- terspersed with comments meant to provide context. At times this technique works nicely, particularly once Lachmann begins to struggle for his archive's financial existence at the unsympathetic hands of Hebrew University. Yet at its worst (par- ticularly toward the end), the comments become overly adulatory and take away from the impact of the primary materials. Most important, however, is that the letters concerning Lachmann tell their own story. Summarily dismissed as a librarian at the Prussian State Library in 1933 by the Nazi regime, Lachmann successfully applied for work at the Hebrew Uni- versity in Jerusalem. Upon his arrival from Berlin, however, Lachmann met great frustration in establishing and maintaining his proposed Archive of Oriental Mu- sic. Although warmly endorsed by then Chancellor Judah L. Magnes, Lachmann ultimately received little funding from the University and was repeatedly refused full affiliation with the University proper. The letters illuminate his story in great detail, including the slow growth of Lachmann's Palestinian recording project, Magnes's consistent but finally fruitless support, and Hebrew University's own hands-off (and, as intimated by Katz, passively hostile) attitude toward musical study in higher education. That Lachmann died before he could reach stability rep- resents to Katz a tragedy, both for Lachmann and for the study of music in Israel. Accompanying the main storyline are several other important document col- lections. An epilogue reprints Lachmann's correspondence with American musi- cologists, including Charles Seeger and fellow expatriates Germans Curt Sachs and George Herzog. A series of appendices illuminate other chapters of Lach- mann's life and philosophy: important personal documents from Germany; letters to his parents describing the 1932 Cairo Conference on Arabic music; twelve ra- dio talks on "Oriental Music," complete with a CD of what Katz believes to be the original examples; and four "Lectures on Eastern Music" delivered to university students in the 1930s. Each of these additions provides new and welcome insight into Lachmann's all-too-brief transplanted career, enriching our portrait of him and his work-and hopefully, in the process, rewriting Jewish musical history. To say that Katz intends through her book to restore Lachmann to the con- sciousness of Jewish music researchers, however, would be an understatement. Rather, the dramatized style of presentation, the book's separation into "acts," and Katz's repeated reference to Lachmann as a "hero" in her epilogue intimate a de- sire to elevate Lachmann to legendary status. Katz's impetus to celebrate his sto- ry and achievements to this degree is curious, and seems unnecessary to this reader. Perhaps, in creating this volume, Katz also aims to dispel doubts of Lachmann's legitimacy within a more local academic circle. In any case, we dissipate any fur- ther opposition to Lachmann's status. A third prominent strand of Jewish music literature comprises textbooks de- signed for the general public. These works, created with the confidence that Jew- ish music holds a broad popular appeal, have rarely been successful. Rather than 401</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews pointing out the challenges and nuances of the field, they tend to propound a mythology of Jewish music as a unified and "safe" narrative. Such remains the case with Marsha Bryan Edelman's Discovering Jewish Music, a self-described general survey of Jewish music for nonspecialists with a particular focus on the twentieth century. Had Edelman limited herself to the last century (or even the last half century), this book might have emerged as a pleasant, light, and informative work based on personal knowledge and engagement, perhaps appropriate for syn- agogue adult education classes. Instead, however, Edelman attempts to cover the entire span of Jewish music history, with deeply flawed results. To this reviewer, the ideal popular Jewish music text would present the cur- rent state of the field in accessible language. While Edelman's language is certainly accessible, her presentation is far from current. Though it includes some classic sources, Edelman's list of references seemingly ignores most of the last twenty years of Jewish music research, including major books and essays by Kay Kauf- man Shelemay, Edwin Seroussi, Philip Bohlman, Mark Kligman, Joachim Braun, Eliyahu Schleifer, Geoffrey Goldberg, and Israel Adler (not to mention work by earlier Israeli musicologists Hanoch Avenary and Edith Gerson-Kiwi). Her ten- dency to rely selectively on older works, whose methods and conclusions are cur- rently under much critical scrutiny, is puzzling and frustrating, and results in a book already well behind the academic curve. Edelman's lack of secondary sources is particularly noticeable in the book's first three and one-half chapters, which span Jewish music from biblical times to the Enlightenment. She is clearly out of her element here, summarizing the first couple thousand years of Jewish music history through a limp web of anecdotal evidence, overreliance and undercontextualization of scriptural sources, and un- supported assertions. Subsequent chapters on the St. Petersburg folklore society and the Yiddish theater are better organized, but rely heavily on other sources (Al- bert Weisser's 1954 The Modern Renaissance ofJewish Music in the former case, and Nahma Sandrow's 1977 Vagabond Stars in the latter) to the point that some passages have become mere thinly veiled rewordings of their sources. Edelman's strongest chapters come at the end of the book, where she deals with more recent events. Here she is on surer footing, due perhaps to her person- al involvement with the music she covers. Depth of understanding, as elsewhere in the book, is not the objective; rather, Edelman aims mainly to outline and illustrate significant movements, events, compositions, and artists within the context of American and Israeli Jewish history. And to her credit, she does not end with a "de- cline of Jewish music" lament often self-righteously intoned during discussions of modern Jewish music "trends" (see, for example, recent works by Sholom Kalib and Joseph Levine). Instead Edelman lets the material speak for itself, allowing the reader to revel in Jewish music's continued richness and variety. In her attempts to bring the reader into contact with the music she describes, Edelman includes over 160 notated musical examples, ranging from anonymous (and undocumented) chant patterns to samples of full piano and vocal scores. Six- ty-five of these examples also appear as short audio segments on the accompany- ing CD. In one sense, notations and their musical samples are quite helpful for readers to experience the music themselves-a notoriously difficult feat for a print 402</page><page sequence="6">Book Reviews publication. Yet while the audio examples are an attractive idea, they feel overly brief here (most are under a minute long), and seem better suited for accompany- ing a popular lecture than immersing a new reader. That many of Edelman's sound sources are out of print, moreover, means most listeners will never be able to hear some of the music she presents in anything but a minimal context, which is un- fortunate. The realm of Jewish music history texts is a highly variable one, with sev- eral clamoring for attention but few if any that can currently address the needs of a dedicated course in the subject. Amnon Shiloah's Jewish Musical Traditions (1992) is strong in its scholarship and cultural focus, but has a difficult writing style and tends to minimize the art music scene. Peter Gradenwitz's 1996 The Mu- sic of Israel (2nd edition) has a considerable scholarly apparatus, but focuses main- ly on Europe and Israel, eschews the role of the United States, and adheres to currently questionable concepts of what makes music "Jewish." And Abraham Z. Idelsohn's Jewish Music in its Historical Development (1929), while still unsur- passed in its breadth and critical approach, can be unwieldy, does not cover the sev- enty-five years since its publication, and feels similarly dated. Within this context, Edelman's book is welcome in concept, but disappointing in execution. May the day arrive soon when Jewish music pedagogy publications can again rise to reflect the frontline of academic scholarship. Judah M.
