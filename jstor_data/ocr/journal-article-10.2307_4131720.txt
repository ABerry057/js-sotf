<plain_text><page sequence="1">Seth Forman. Blacks in the Jewish Mind: A Crisis of Liberalism. New York: New York University Press, 1998. x, 274 pp. This is a welcome corrective to the many recent polemical and scholarly- but tendentious-studies of black-Jewish relations that portray Jews as differing little from other whites. As Seth Forman indicates, many of these studies bear the imprint of the Black Power movement, whose influence mounted in the late 1960s. Seeking to undermine the integrationist civil rights coalition in which Jews occu- pied a leading role, the writers of these works severely minimized or denied any special Jewish empathy for the African-American cause. David L. Lewis claims that Jewish involvement in the civil rights movement was motivated by self-inter- est rather than by heightened sensitivity rooted in a memory of antisemitic perse- cution. Jews allegedly "us[ed] Blacks as surrogates" (p. 12) to eliminate discrim- ination against Jews, blacks deriving little benefit from the alliance. Harold Cruse similarly portrayed Jews in the civil rights movement as opportunistic, as a privi- leged group that had not suffered in the United States and therefore had nothing in common with African Americans. According to Forman, Taylor Branch even cites Israel's refusal to grant citizenship to members of Ben-Ami Carter's "Black He- brew" sect as evidence that Jews have been "perpetrators of racial hate" (p. 14). But Branch ignores the invalidity of the sect's claim to be Jewish as well as its vir- ulently antisemitic and anti-white theology. Rejecting a genuine multicultural model for a narrowly constructed racial one, many black nationalists have even labeled Jews the most racist whites. Thus, the Nation of Islam (NOI) depicted the Jews as the most malicious of the white devil race created by the mad scientist Yacub. Black academics like Tony Martin supported the NOI's ridiculous charge that Jews controlled the slave trade. The his- 389</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review torians August Meier and John Bracey helped legitimize this antisemitic fabrica- tion by suggesting that Jewish involvement in the slave trade, and in the plantation system of the American South, constituted one of the most important subjects for future research. Fearing that any acknowledgment of significant Jewish suffering threatened the concept of a monolithic white racism, many black nationalists grossly inflated the death toll of the Atlantic slave trade, and even the numbers imported, in an ef- fort to trivialize Jewish suffering during the Holocaust. Forman quotes Malcolm X, a militant antisemite for most of his career, as complaining that "everybody's wet-eyed over a handful of Jews who brought it on themselves"-in effect, justi- fying the Holocaust-while ignoring "our one hundred million" captured and brought to "this country" (p. 71)-a monstrous exaggeration. Forman notes that American Jews maintained a "truly admirable" (p. 15) record on civil rights, and that most African Americans perceived Jews as more friendly to their cause than other whites. The Jewish press was strongly sympa- thetic to African-American civil rights, and the major Jewish-led trade unions were historically more committed than other unions to organizing and admitting blacks. Jews were virtually unique in retaining a liberal outlook after achieving significant economic mobility after World War II. Forman also argues that Jews continued to support racial integration even when the destabilization of Jewish neighborhoods and their institutions, on which Jewish identity depended, was often a consequence. Northern Jews strongly endorsed racial integration in the South, even when it threatened the physical and economic security of the region's small Jewish popu- lation, and Southern Jews themselves were more supportive of desegregation than other Southern whites. Forman traces the growing divergence between African-American and Jew- ish interests as blacks pressed for racial preferences and "community control," threatening a system of merit-based entry and advancement in education, govern- ment, and the professions that after 1945 had benefited Jews. Affirmative action programs confirmed the Black Power view of Jews as "privileged" whites, a sta- tus made official in 1973 when the federal government established five racial cat- egories and classified Jews as "non-Hispanic whites." This implied that Jews, as part of a monolithic white majority, had oppressed those in the other four cate- gories. Forman argues that the communal needs of blacks have been taken more se- riously in the United States than those of Jews. This is in part illustrated by what until recently was widespread government backing for racial preferences bene- fiting African Americans. Forman notes that African-American moviemakers to- day often receive financing to make films celebrating African-American culture that disparage racial intermarriage, while Jews in film have traditionally avoided Jewish themes and celebrated Jewish-gentile intermarriage. In music, African Americans remained committed to jazz and other identifiably black forms, while Jews who succeeded in that field invariably wrote and performed music that had no connection whatsoever to Jewishness-a prime example being Irving Berlin, composer of "White Christmas" and "Easter Parade." The predominantly Jewish "New York Intellectuals," largely excluded from university careers, could gain 390</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews prominence only by writing on non-Jewish topics. By contrast, the African-Amer- ican "public intellectuals" of the 1990s, like Henry Gates and Cornel West, occu- py high-salaried positions at prestigious universities, and write almost exclusive- ly about race. The author is to be commended for his stimulating, forthright, and often in- sightful discussion of a critical subject. Stephen H. Norwood University of Oklahoma Norman, Oklahoma</page></plain_text>
