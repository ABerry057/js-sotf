<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dianne Ashton. Rebecca Gratz: Women and Judaism in Antebellum America. American Jewish Civilization Series. Detroit: University Press, 1997. 329 pp. Set in the Philadelphia made familiar by Ben Franklin, Dianne Ashton's biography of the legendary Rebecca Gratz is a fascinating study of the tensions born of balancing one's Jewish religious identity and one's commitment to an emerging nation that was decidedly and increasingly Christian. While other scholars of early American Jewish history have sketched the antebellum period in terms of uncovering Jewish heroes, the impact of quiet antisemitism, economic growth, and immigration patterns, Ashton studies the period by</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 413 analyzing Gratz's choices and decisions. Through her exhaustive search of Gratz family papers, archival records of Philadelphia's moral reform institutions, and general American and American Jewish history books, as well as her understanding of feminist theory and history, Ashton has created a touchstone. Rebecca Gratz is a rich source of information about privilege coupled with "otherness," social mores of the literary and economic elite, the restrictions on women that ironically became the source of community authority, and Jewish family and cultural daily life in early America. Rebecca Gratz, one of the twelve children of a wealthy, merchant family and aunt to twenty-seven nieces and nephews, many of whom she raised, revealed herself through hundreds of letters that paradoxically depict both the narrowness and the urbanity of New York, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. These three cities constituted her world, and she traveled comfortably between her home and the homes of relatives and friends where she wintered or summered and, more often than not, nursed or attended to the needs of others. Undoubtedly, she was attending to her own needs as well: her need for companionship, intellectual stimulation, and social acceptance. As portrayed by Ashton, Gratz was intelligent, cultured, resilient, sen- sitive, and ambivalent. Religion was her refuge but sometimes the source of some of her most difficult challenges and, it seems, her preoccupation. She had close friendships with Christian women and men, some of whom fall into the category of admirers, but she was steadfastly committed to Judaism. In this regard, she may indeed, as is often said, have inspired Scott's romanticized portrayal of Rebecca in Ivanhoe, but that is more properly a footnote than an achievement. She was also sensible and broad-minded and embraced her Christian sisters-in-law and nieces and nephews rather than fracture the family. She devoted many letters and conversations to explaining and defending Jewish practice and belief to her friends, who assured her that real Christians held no contempt for Jews because Jesus himself had forgiven them on the Cross! (Ashton's restraint is admirable.) In an era in which Christian evangelism spawned increasingly strident expressions of antisemitism, Gratz firmly believed and lived by the principle of exemplars, believing that her good works demonstrated the worthiness of all Jews. She dedicated herself to charity, founding the Female Hebrew Benevolent Society, the Philadelphia Orphan Asylum, the Hebrew Sunday School (later merged with the Hebrew Educational Society) for the influx of Jewish immigrants, and the Jewish Foster Home. The institutions she founded influenced the ethos of similar organizations throughout the United</page><page sequence="3">414 BOOK REVIEWS States and helped shape Judaism to its American contexts. In antebellum America, as less than 1 percent of the population, Jews were vulnerable targets of Christian zeal. Because women participated in this religious revival so vigorously, Gratz was subject to her friends' religious passions. Aware of the temptations of conversion, she organized communal life to strengthen Jewish education and self-knowledge, reminding the Jewish community of its obligations to provide services according to biblical tradition-care for the poor, the widow, and the child. Ashton's dominant theme is the manner of Gratz's expression of her Judaism: She expressed her faith through "charity and ethical actions" (p. 91), the realm of women in antebellum American in contrast to the ritual and prayer of men. Ashton also tracks the attitudes of Gratz's peers to sex and marriage, both of which were constant topics in the letters she exchanged with her sisters and friends. The prevailing attitude toward sex cautioned women of its dangers to physical and spiritual health. In antebellum America, female purity was exalted, while formal and informal education for girls prepared them for fulfillment as wives and mothers. Although it is impossible to determine the reasons with any certainty, Gratz remained single all her life, devoting herself to Jewish communal organizations and to her family, developing the former to supplement the latter. Her good works were significant and practical contributions, anticipating the needs of women and children directly and powerfully. Her considerable organizational and leadership skills shaped the Female Hebrew Benevolent Society and the Philadelphia Orphan Asylum, and rooted them in the ethic of tzedakah. For Gratz, these visible expressions of Jewish self-help would demonstrate to the non-Jew the willingness and ability of Jews to accept responsibility for their own community. At the same time, these institutions improved the lives of Jewish women and children. Gratz's most visible legacy was her work as a builder of communal institutions, which demonstrates concretely the piety she hoped to instill in the Jewish community. Grounded in Jewish ethics, these institutions embodied the teachings of the religion. But Gratz's legacy, as proved by Ashton, extends beyond the individual and communal mitzvot. She was a courageous leader, a strong woman who loved her family, her religion, and her country, and served them all by forging a new type of woman, someone who understood that spirituality was necessary and practical in a developing country. She showed that women could express nurturance through communal service, that they could also be skilled managers and leaders, that one could be an American and not compromise one's Judaism. Dianne Ashton's carefully</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 415 researched biography is a responsible evocation of an accomplished woman who consciously grew into a gracious, substantial American Jewish hero.
