Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1993. x, 308 pp. In Images of Sephardi and Eastern Jewries in Transition, Aron Rodrigue has translated, organized thematically, and provided provocative and infor- mative introductions to the correspondence---a rich array of letters, reports, directives, and policy guidelines-between teachers of the Alliance Israelite Universelle and the Alliance Central Committee in Paris. Understandably, modern Jewish historians have tended to limit their focus to specific geo- graphic areas and to particular communities of Jews. Yet as this excellent study suggests, much can be learned when these boundaries are transcended. By probing the delicate, problematic, and dynamic interactions between westernized Jewry and their Sephardi and Eastern coreligionists, Rodrigue</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 419 not only reveals the distinctiveness, self-representation, and self-identity of "westernizers" but also presents an extraordinary lens with which to view the sociopolitical transformation of Middle Eastern and North African Jewry. From its inception in 1860, the Alliance had clearly defined goals: "to work throughout the world for the emancipation and moral progress of the Jews; to help effectively all those who suffer because they are Jews; to encourage all publications designed to achieve these results" (p. 7). Motivated by a genuine sentiment of Jewish solidarity and a commitment to the Enlightenment ideology of moral virtue, economic utility, and political liberty, Alliance members, largely although never exclusively from France, set themselves the task of transforming, or in their own words, of regenerating, the Jews of the world. The means? Modem, intellectually rigorous schools for Jewish girls and boys. By 1939, the Alliance had established 127 schools from Morocco to Iran. Some of these schools were coed, most were primary, and a few were vocational. Although the teachers were originally chosen from graduates of Jewish schools in France and the Rabbinical Seminary in Paris, they were subsequently recruited from the Ottoman Empire and in smaller numbers from North Africa and the Middle East. They then were trained by the Alliance in Paris--either at the Ecole Normale Isra61ite Orientale or, if young women, at the Institut Bischoffsheim, Mrs. Isaac's, and Miss Weill-Kahn's, and finally, after 1922, at the Alliance normal school for women in Versailles. Predictably these recruits were from less-well-to-do families. For the women, moreover, in addition to prestige, the position of teacher also provided the only career in which they could lead an independent existence. Letters-for example, from Mrs. Weismann, who arrived at the Institut Bischoffsheim from Adrianople at the age of fourteen-speak poignantly of the cultural shock experienced by the young men and women as they arrived in cosmopolitan Paris. Four years later, however, they provided the Alliance with the first indication that the goal of westernizing could indeed succeed. As Rodrigue has so acutely observed, these teachers, "missionaries for modem Western civilization" (p. 38), became simultaneously ethnogra- phers and informants, mediating the information reaching Paris through an "ambiguous and veiled dialogue" (p. 135) between "self' and "other" which were paradoxically one and the same. Throughout this work, Rodrigue's analyses, whether of Middle Eastern society, French Jewry, or the Alliance teachers, are subtle, sophisticated, nuanced, and, in at least one instance, perhaps even controversial. They are</page><page sequence="3">420 BOOK REVIEWS also so adroitly woven into the primary documents that the reader never looses the vitality and immediacy of the first-hand accounts. The very emergence of a westernized elite such as the Alliance teaching corps, Rodrigue argues, suggests that traditional Jewish society may well have been in decline even before the impact of the Alliance made itself felt. As for the teachers, their often-scathing critiques of this society served to underline the distance they sought between themselves and their origins. Both in self-representation and self-identity, they had become Western Jews reenacting, Rodrigue tells us, a "self-legitimizing drama of emancipation" (p. 10). Although the majority of the letters and reports are from male teachers, women's voices are also heard. As self-defined "feminists," they decry the condition of women in Muslim lands and advocate radical reforms to improve the position of their coreligionists. Notwithstanding contrary evidence concerning Jewish women in Central Europe, Rodrigue suggests that in many instances these Sephardi and Eastern Jewish women became "vectors" of the most radical forms of westernization. Because they were women, they viewed westernization more positively than did their male counterparts. The leaders of the Alliance, of course, provided the blueprint for much of the discourse of the teachers. And it is here that one gains important insights into the identity of French Jewry, which was, at one and the same time, assimilationist and devoted to Judaism, proud of being French and equally assertive of its connection to and solidarity with the Jewish people. But if this model represents a new form of Jewish ethnicity, it is also clearly indebted to the European Haskalah. How often one is reminded of the maskilim of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, as the Alliance teachers discuss the significance of dress, decry the "jargon" of their coreligionists, critique traditional Jewish society and culture, and underscore the need for productive employment. And yet I would also argue that their ambivalence toward the Sephardi and eastern communities demonstrates how easily the attitudes and posture of non-Jewish advocates of Jewish reform were internalized and appropriated a century later by the Jews themselves. As with all fine works, one wishes for even more. One wonders, for example, how the teachers of the Alliance Israelite, immersed in French culture, language, and civilization, resembled and differed from their French counterparts. Recent studies such as Jacques Ozouf and Mona Ozouf's La Republique des Instituteurs (Paris, 1992) will be helpful in placing the</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 421 Alliance teachers in context. In the meantime, Aron Rodrigue has provided us with a richly illustrated entry into a world whose significance can no longer be ignored.
