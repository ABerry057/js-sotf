New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. 2004. 490 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000396 Last year marked the 350th year of permanent Jewish settlement in North America. The retelling of Peter Stuyvesant's seventeenth-century pledge permitting twenty-three Brazilian Jews the opportunity to settle in colonial New Amsterdam launched a year-long commemoration highlighted by scholarly conferences, public lectures, and a host of synagogue-based courses on the subject. Scholarly groups, including the field's two major depositories, the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati and the American Jewish Historical Society in New York City, sponsored a variety of events, hosted a dedicated Web site (www.350th.org), and welcomed the president of the United States to a gala anniversary dinner in Washington, D.C. Two of the field's leaders, New York University's Hasia Diner and Brandeis University's Jonathan Sama, harnessed the celebration to launch important new books. Diner's A History of Jews in the United States approaches the subject through a historical lens, whereas Sarna focuses on religious themes in his Amer ican Judaism. Their near-simultaneous publication challenges many historio graphie assumptions in the field and has raised the visibility of the American Jewish experience in both academic and popular settings. Diner divides American Jewish history into three chronological eras: an early period stretching from the first permanent North American Jewish settlement in 1654 until the close of the early national period in 1820, a hundred-year span from 1820 to 1920 that Diner calls "the pivotal century," and the remainder of the twentieth century. Her decision to periodize A History of Jews in the United 196</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews States along these lines challenges a historiography that typically bases its narra tive on a differentiation between the 100,000-strong central European (commonly known as German) Jewish immigration of the mid-nineteenth century and the arrival fifty years later of two million eastern European Jews. "Adhering to these binary categories of "German" and "eastern European," she claims, "clouds the process of understanding Jewish migration to America and leaves out some important facts" (93). Instead, Diner blends the two immigrations into a single historical epoch, urging her readers to explore parallel themes and comp lementary analyses of Jews that, considered together, inspired "tectonic shifts" that revolutionized Jewish history (73). Diner's book is an exceptional work of social history, bringing much of the last generation's historical research to bear on the American Jewish experience. Her gendered analysis reveals that in colonial America, for example, New York Jews constructed a mikveh before they built their synagogue (17). She integrates many themes dominant in the historiography of American Jewish women of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in her treatment of the period between 1820 and 1920. What is most innovative, though, is her inclusion of post World War II Orthodox Jewish women and the creation of the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance in a historical epoch that is usually treated in more limited dis cussions of subjects such as the Reform movement's ordination of women rabbis and the Conservative movement's eventual embrace of the changes advocated by Ezrat Nashim (355). A new generation of social historians has explored the impact of white privilege in U.S. history. Diner embraces their findings, eschewing some of the exceptionalist argumentation that has typified American Jewish historical writ ings. Even as Diner acknowledges the particularity of antisemitism in the American experience (especially after the immigration restriction acts of the 1920s), she understands the powerful historical impact of Jewish whiteness. Diner traces Jewish whiteness as early as the colonial period, when, in the North, it offered privilege and, in the South, translated into Jewish participation in the "peculiar institution" of slavery (25). As Diner observes, "A mark both of the Jews' inclusion as whites and of their worldwide involvement in trade was the fact that like their white neighbors... . Jews owned slaves, averaging about two per family" (26). Compared to African American or Chinese American history, Diner concludes, antisemitic discrimination against Jews did not compare to the devastating and continuing impact of American racism, whether evidenced by the segregationist laws of the Jim Crow South or the congressional restriction of Chinese immigrants after 1882 (165). Her treatment of twentieth-century relations between blacks and Jews not only acknowledges the well-known history of Jewish participation in the civil rights movement but also explores the powerful cultural interaction of the two groups. As Diner explains, Jewish musicians and artists routinely challenged cul tural taboos on matters of race, popularizing African American culture for white audiences, crossing the color line in their professional engagements, and inviting otherwise marginalized performers to join them on stage or in the recording studio (208). 197</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Yet Diner also notes a recent historiographie trend that is more critical of Jewish involvement in the black-Jewish partnership. "Many involved in the movement, including Jewish communal leaders, rabbis, and activists," she explained, "saw the Jews' flight to the suburbs as a kind of middle-class compla cency, a tacit acceptance of racial privilege, and did not mince words when casti gating Jews whose behavior seemed to support the oppressive racial status quo" (270). Though American Jews, especially in the North, continued to vote liberal and Democratic, their commitment to racial equality weakened in the face of Great Society affirmative action and quota programs in the mid-1960s, as well as court-ordered busing in the 1970s. Jonathan Sama's American Judaism refracts the American Jewish experience through a religious lens. He is concerned, at first, with a central question in modem Jewish history: Can Jewish communities thrive in an open and pluralistic nation that is committed to both religious freedom and the separation of church and state? Rejecting the oft-written linear narrative that demands the demise of Orthodoxy and the rise of assimilation in American Jewish life, Sama holds optimistic: "Casting away old paradigms," he argues, Jews "transformed their faith, reinventing American Judaism in an attempt to make it more appealing, more meaningful, more sensitive to the concerns of the day" (xiv). American Judaism emerges, in Sama's estimation, as "a story of revitalization" (xiv). Sama places the Jewish experience at the center of American religious history. As a non-Christian minority in the United States, Jews pressed govern ment agencies and their fellow citizens to expand the limits of American religious expression (xv). Although they were less successful during the colonial period, the constitutional guarantees of church-state separation propelled American Jews onto more equal footing with their non-Je wish neighbors. By the twentieth century, that sense of religious equality found voice in the title of Will Herberg's pathbreaking 1955 book, Protestant-Catholic-Jew. A population that rarely exceeded 5 percent of the total population, Jews could count themselves as one third (or even one-half) of the American religious tradition. With the exception of historians such as Eli Faber and the late Jacob Rader Marcus, most observers of the American Jewish experience have not focused his toriographie attention on the colonial period. Here, Sama is at his best, combining an internationalist perspective that demonstrates important new insights into the development of early American Judaism. In his opening chapter, Sama connects the development of mid-seventeenth century American Judaism with the experience of Jews living in the Iberian Peninsula (3). He compares the synagogue-state relations of colonial American synagogues with those in both Europe and the West Indies, contrasting their diver gent size, religiosity, and relationship to the state (15, 28). The Jews of Curacao, Suriname, and Jamaica, for example, outnumbered their coreligionists in the American colonies (28). Conversely, American Jews rejected the religious models embraced by Jews in England, Europe, and the Middle East, choosing instead a synagogue style that was closer in form to those of the Protestant refor mers (39). Colonial North American Jews centered their religious lives, Sama argues, around the synagogue community, locating their Jewish lives within the 198</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews confines of the synagogue walls. "The synagogue and organized Jewish commu nity," according to Sama, "became one and the same?a synagogue-community? and as such it assumed primary responsibility for preserving and maintaining local Jewish life" (12). Sama constructs a powerful argument that links the religious development of American Judaism with the evolution of the nation's larger democratic values and institutions. Throughout the American experience, Sama observes, Jews declared their loyalty to their nation and sought active civic engagement with government. Though he is correct to point out the limited role played by Jews in the American Revolution, Sama does identify the Revolutionary period, which culminated in the writing and ratification of the U.S. Constitution, as a historical moment that "transformed American Jewish life forever" (36). As Thomas Jefferson's America matured into a burgeoning Jacksonian republic, Sama observes parallel develop ments within American Judaism. "Dissenters," he argues, "no longer sought to com promise their principles for the sake of consensus; instead, they felt free to withdraw and start their own synagogues, which they did time and again" (59). Despite their divergent approaches, these two books share a great deal in common. Though Sama focuses his attention on the religious aspects of the American Jewish experience, he weaves his analysis over a broad historical time line. He explores the specific impact of key historical events on the development of American Judaism, tracing the contours of colonial-era American Jewish history, the impact of the American Revolution on Judaism, the expansion of Amer ican democracy during the Jacksonian period, the Civil War, as well as various Jewish immigrations to the United States. Among his more powerful historical theses is his assertion that antisemitic pogroms played a lesser role in motivating Jewish immigration than most historiography argues. Instead, Sama concludes, its root causes "lay deeper in overpopulation, oppressive legislation, economic dislo cation, forced conscription, wretched poverty, and crushing despair" (152). Diner covers the religious aspects of the American Jewish experience as well, positing in her introduction that "in matters of religious practice, American Jews looked less often either to canonical works or to authoritative leaders" (2). Her discussion of the colonial era is rich in religious history and parallels, in large measure, the conclusions that Sama draws on the synagogue community. She continues with a religious narrative of the early national period, which wit nessed "the first steps toward the transformation of Jewish communities" and when the Lockean roots of American democracy meant a fundamental shift from covenantal Judaism (61). In the twentieth century, Diner notes the Reform movement's return to tradition and embrace of Zionism, the Conservative move ment's struggle to reconcile it own internal dissension over Jewish practice, and Orthodoxy's inability to build a solid and cohesive organizational infrastructure (250, 252, 255). Sama agrees with Diner that the traditional emphasis on central and eastern European immigration clouds our understanding of the American Jewish experi ence. For Sama, that older periodization "rests on the false and tunnel-visioned assumption that Jews are more influenced by their 'generation in America' than by their surroundings and the events of the day" (xix). 199</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews Although this new approach is needed to draw out other causal agents, Diner's decision to organize her chapter headings around "the pivotal century" of 1820-1920 leads to confusion about cause and effect in nineteenth-century Jewish America. While Parts I and III of The Jews of the United States include chapters that follow one another in chronological order, Part II breaks down the middle period as "a century of migration, 1820-1924," "a century of Jewish life in America, 1820-1924," and "a century of Jewish politics, 1820-1920." The suc cessive chapters, overlapping in chronology, make it difficult for readers to distill the narrative or draw larger conclusions on the relationship between subthemes. It has been a challenge, until now, to find single-volume syntheses that capture the American Jewish experience. Both of these narratives will serve the field well.
