<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CONCEPT OF THE THREE KETARIM: ITS PLACE IN JEWISH POLITICAL THOUGHT AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR A STUDY OF JEWISH CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY by STUART A. COHEN Jewish political traditions, it has been argued, constitute an integral facet of Jewish civilization in its entirety. They reflect a constant - albeit often implicit - understanding that the validity of Jewish teaching can best find expression in a political setting. They also embody Judaism's commitment to the establishment of the perfect polity. As implemented through the pro- cess of covenant (brit), and as buttressed by the attribute of loving-kindness (hesed), political traditions in effect comprise the vehicles whereby the Congregation of Israel attempts to transpose the kingdom of heaven (mal- khut shamayim - "the good commonwealth") to earth.' 1. An earlier version of this paper was presented to the Workshop on Studying and Teach- ing the Jewish Political Tradition, held in Jerusalem in August 1981 under the auspices of the Center for Jewish Community Studies. The center, under the direction of Professor Daniel Elazar, has been in the forefront of Jewish political studies throughout the decade of its exis- tence, and I am grateful for the opportunity to express my thanks to Professor Elazar and the other fellows and associates of the center for their inspiration and advice.

Elazar, "Covenant as the Basis of the Jewish Politi- cal Tradition," in Kinship and Consent: The Jewish Political Tradition and Its Contemporary 27</page><page sequence="2">28 STUART A. COHEN Thus understood, Jewish political traditions are perceived to be utili- tarian in intent and dynamic in form. They constitute neither the linear derivatives of a systematic body of political theory nor a monolithic corpus of constitutional doctrine. Rather, they are the products of a continuous political dialogue which, throughout the long course of Jewish history, has been primarily concerned with the practical definition of proper modes of Jewish political conduct and the instrumental application of appropriate forms of internal Jewish government. Only partially has that dialogue been summarized formally, in the occasional comments of Jewish political thinkers. More often, and more fully, it has been articulated in the behavior- al dimensions of Jewish public life. That is why its investigation and recon- struction is such an exacting task. The principles underlying Jewish political traditions cannot be distilled from the writings of individual Jewish philo- sophers - very few of whom have composed reasonably architected state- ments of political import. Rather, they have to be inferred from the activities and habits of Jewish political practitioners. Ultimately, indeed, they can only be identified by an examination of the instrumental arrangements which have periodically regulated relationships within and between the component segments of the Congregation of the Children of Israel (Adat B'nei Yisrael - otherwise, the edah). It is these which lie at the very root of the Jewish political experience and these which therefore have to be explored in order to understand its evolution. The present paper is designed as a contribution to that inquiry. Its underlying purpose is to examine the institutional processes whereby the stream of covenantal arrangements which have characterized the various epochs of Jewish constitutional history have been put into effect. Specifical- ly, it seeks to trace the form and structure of the provisions which the Jewish political tradition has made for the exercise of political power and the manner of its distribution. It will attempt to demonstrate that the concept of the three ketarim encapsulates the organizational system whereby Jewish polities traditionally - and consistently - distributed authority among and between specific governmental instrumentalities. It will further suggest that a study of the development of the ketarim might also facilitate wider his- torical analyses of the dynamics of Jewish constitutional change. Uses, ed. D. J.

It has no sympathy with a system of government in which a single body or group possesses a monopoly of the attributes, prerogatives, and privileges of political authority. A survey of the long history of Jewish political conduct, as well as a review of the comments passed on the Jewish political tradition by some of its most representative exponents and commentators, reveals this to be a cardinal constitutional axiom. It has made its influence felt in every one of Judaism's constitutional epochs, and in every arena of Jewry's com- munal organization. In principle, the concentration of power is to be avoid- ed and denigrated; its diffusion among various legitimate (or legitimated) domains of government is to be encouraged and praised. Constitutional omnipotence is occasional and implicitly refused even to God;2 it is per- manently and explicitly denied to man. One illustration of the Jewish commitment to this rule is provided by the early rabbinic attitude toward the degree of constitutional authority wielded by Moses. The example, as will be readily appreciated, is not chosen at ran- dom. Moses is singled out for attention because he is a protagonist of such extraordinary stature and status within the Jewish political tradition. According to the biblical account, not only was he in exceptionally close contact with God. Apart from his successor, Joshua, he was also the only human being ever to be divinely designated eved adonai (lit. "servant of the Lord," a title which, in constitutional terms, carries with it the designation of "Chief Minister to God"). That is why subsequent commentators found it so difficult to dragoon him into any of the categories conventionally applied to lesser mortals, whose influence over the entire course of Jewish history has been less manifest and less profound.3 Therein, however, lies the 2. Hence, Abraham can invoke jurisprudential principles when haggling over the fate of Sodom ("Shall the judge of the entire world not perform justice?"; Gen. 18:25); Moses can refer to basic rights when attempting to avert God's wrath (e.g., Num. 16:22); the tannaim can insist that the torah is "not in heaven" (e.g., Talmud Bavli [hereafter T.B.] Bava Me;iah 59a-b); and the amoraim can reject the notion that the covenant was foisted upon an unwilling and virgin people at Sinai (T.B. Shabbat 88a and tosafot). 3. For one early example of the extent to which Moses was considered to have fulfilled an extraordinarily wide range of constitutional functions, see Philo, De Sacrificiis Abelis et Caini, IV, 130, Loeb Classical Library ed., trans. F. H. Colson (London, 1929), vol. 2, p. 189: There he is described as Israel's "captain and leader the High Priest [sic] and prophet and friend of</page><page sequence="4">30 STUART A. COHEN interest of the case. So stringent was the traditional Jewish insistence on the diffusion of political power that not even Moses could be granted the pre- ponderance of authority which - according to aggadic legend - he blatant- ly sought. In the words of Exodus Rabbah (2:7), "Moses requested that kings and priests should descend from him. Thereupon God said to him: 'Draw not nigh thither' [al tikrav halom; Exod. 3:5]; i.e., your sons will not perform sacrifices because the priesthood is already assigned to your brother Aaron ... the monarchy is already assigned to David." What followed, the sources suggest, had to conform to the pattern thus established at an embryonic stage of Jewish constitutional history. As much is emphasized by the rabbinic attitude toward the succession of Joshua, who - although also an eved adonai - was clearly in not quite the same category as Moses.4 The relevant biblical narrative (Num. 27:15-23) itself intimates that Joshua's authority was not to be as far-ranging as that of Moses; it specifies that at his induction ceremony Joshua, unlike Moses, was com- manded to stand before Elazar the High Priest, the custodian of the Urim and Thummim (Num. 27:21). Characteristically, commentators of the tal- mudic era noted this obligation as well as the additional fact that (according to a strict rendering of the text) Moses was instructed to place only one of his hands upon Joshua. Hence the comment, first found in the fourth- century Sifrei to this passage, that "Joshua had need of Elazar and Elazar of Joshua."5 The requirement, we are invited to understand, was not merely functional - in the sense of being the consequence of the manifold tasks which awaited the new leader of the edah. It was, rather, constitutional - in the sense of being a symbolic commitment to the survival of the principle of power-sharing arrangements. God." Talmudic sources, although more precise, are only marginally less extravagant. They refer to Moses as both "king and prophet" (melekh ve-navi); e.g., T.B. Shavu'ot 15a. The designations of David as eved adonai in Psalms 18:1 and 36:1 are not manifestly of divine origin. Within the present context they might be understood to be the consequence of a human endeavor to attribute to the founder of the royal dynasty a title which intimated un- questioned constitutional primacy. 4. E.g., T.B. Bava Batra 75a; "The elders of that generation said: 'The face of Moses is like the sun; that of Joshua is like the moon.'" 5. Chap. 141. The fact that Moses did, eventually, place both of his hands on Joshua (Num. 27:23) presents an obvious complication and provoked much subsequent rabbinic huffing and puffing (e.g., T.B. Sanhedrin 105b and Numbers Rabbah 12:9). None of this, however, satisfied the Malbim (Meir Loeb ben Jebiel Mikhael, 1809-1879), who restated the obvious: "And then he was commanded to lay on Joshua only one single hand and to bestow upon him only some of his honor" (Ha-Torah ve-ha-Mitzvah, Num. 27:21). For an alternative (non-Jewish) view of this incident, see Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan, pt. III, chap. 40.</page><page sequence="5">THE CONCEPT OF THE THREE KETARIM 31 To this axiom subsequent rabbinic historiography remained consistently faithful. Accordingly, examples of deviations from the norm were severely castigated; threats to its preservation were stringently denigrated. In some instances, this gave rise to shrewd - and tongue-in-cheek - comments on the political situation prevailing at the time of the redaction of the Talmud (e.g., T.B. Horayot Ilib: " 'The scepter shall not pass from Judah' [Gen. 49:10], this refers to the exilarch of Babylon, who dominates [rodeh] Israel with a rod; 'nor the staff from his descendants' [ibid.], these are the children of Hillel, who publicly teach the Torah to Israel"). In others it provoked particularistic - perhaps even idiosyncratic - interpretations of Jewish his- tory. A case in point is provided by the treatment accorded to the Hasmo- nean kingship, a vein of Jewish constitutional history which rabbinic commentators assiduously mined (and to which we ourselves shall have cause to return). Nalhmanides (Moses ben Nabman, 1194-1270), to cite only one such source, was in little doubt as to the explanation for the string of tragedies which befell that unfortunate family. Basing himself on emin- ently respectable sources (T.J. Horayot 3:2), he referred explicitly to the principle of the division of powers: "It is possible that there was an element of sin inherent in their kingship because they were priests and were com- manded to reserve their officiation for the needs of the altar. . . . it was not for them to rule [limlokh] but only to perform the service of God. ... and R. Hliyya bar Aba explained that the Torah ordained that the priests, levites, and entire tribe of Levi should not have a portion in the kingship - and that is a fitting and proper matter" (commentary to Gen. 49:10). The whiff of the manifesto which pervades such comments must not be allowed to conceal their instrumental impulse. The power-sharing princi- ples thus adumbrated were not left in the rarefied sphere of high theory. Such was the unity of conception and execution that they were institutional- ly fostered throughout the evolutionary course of Jewish constitutional history. A clear line might therefore be traced from the models of constitu- tional power-sharing described in the Bible to similar arrangements devel- oped under very different political circumstances. The boundaries which (in the traditional view) were supposedly placed on the extent of Joshua's power were not regarded as exceptional. On the contrary, parallel limiting provi- sions - some of them explicitly derived from such pentateuchal precedents as the limited monarchy of Deuteronomy 17:14-20 - were laid down wherever and whenever Jews found themselves confronted with the need to adapt or alter their framework of government to the pressures of unprece- dented requirements. One prominent example is provided by the talmudic</page><page sequence="6">32 STUART A. COHEN prohibition against the presence of a melekh in the Sanhedrin; another by the convention that the appointment of dayyanim in talmudic Babylon be jointly approved by the resh galuta (exilarch) and the rashei yeshivah; yet a third by the meticulously preserved balance between the ray rosh (Rab de la Corte) and the nagid in Sephardi communities of the high medieval era; a fourth in the provisions made for joint consultation between the rashei medinot and dayyanei aratzot in the Va'ad Arba ha-Aratzot (Council of the Four Lands) of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Polish Jewry.6 The list suggests that Jews persistently attempted - albeit with varying degrees of success - to divide communal governance in a way which might preserve and foster the federal requirements of their political heritage. II It would not be difficult to adduce further examples of constitutional power-sharing in Jewish public life. The exercise would undoubtedly be instructive, since each instance possesses instrinsic historical interest. But for present purposes such repetition would probably be superfluous. Unless subjected to further analysis, a mere catalogue of Jewish governmental arrangements would add little to a synoptic understanding of the procedures whereby the appropriate ordinances were initiated and nothing at all to an identification of the procedures whereby they were sustained or modified. In order that these facets of the case might be clarified, attention must there- fore be turned elsewhere. Specifically, an examination needs to be made of the forms and structures of the separation of powers which the Jewish politi- cal tradition seems most consistently to have favored and to which (as far as the evidence suggests) it most faithfully adhered. At this point it seems necessary to guard against the intrusion into our discussion of two potentially obstinate red herrings. One is Jesus' injunction to the Pharisees to "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's" (Matt. 22:21); the other 6. On these instances see, respectively, T.B. Sanhedrin 18b, and Maimonides, Hilkhot Sanhedrin 2:4; M. Beer, Reshut ha-Golah be-Bavel bimei ha-Mishnah ve-ha-Talmud (Tel Aviv, 1970), pp. 106-141; A. Ashtor, Korot ha- Yehudim bi-Sefarad ha-Muslemit, 2 vols. (Jerusalem, 1966), vol. 1, pp. 263-265, and Y. Baer, A History of the Jews in Christian Spain, vol. 1 (Phila- delphia, 1961), pp. 212-231; Y. Heilprin, Pinkas Va'ad Arbah Aratzot: Lekutei Takkanot, Ketavim ve-Reshumot (Jerusalem, 1945), introduction. The constitutional position allotted to the rabbanim rashi'im and the rabbinical courts in the modern State of Israel - for all its anomalies - can be portrayed as an echo of precisely the same principle.</page><page sequence="7">THE CONCEPT OF THE THREE KETARIM 33 is Montesquieu's division of the arms of proper government into the three branches known as the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary.7 These are two familiar formulas, both of which readily come to mind as paradigms for an analysis of the Jewish system of government. Moreover, superficially attractive supports for their adoption as appropriate referents for a study of Jewish attitudes to government can be found in Jewish sources, both classi- cal and postclassical. Montesquieu's division, for instance, might be strait- jacketed into the verse: "The Lord our judge, the Lord our law-giver, the Lord our King - He will save us" (Isa. 33:22). More explicit, if of slightly less distinguished pedigree, are the props which could be found to support the bifurcate division posited by Jesus. In one frequently quoted passage, for instance, Menahlem Ha-Meiri (1249-1316) speaks pointedly of "the leader- ship" being "generally delivered to two persons, one from the standpoint of the Torah, and he is the high priest; and one for the leadership of the [mater- ial] world, and he is the king" (Beit ha-Bebira on T.B. Sanhedrin 18b). Neither of these formulas can be accepted as a relevant paradigm for the Jewish perspective on the separation of powers. Principally, this is because neither of them complements what we know from sources other than those cited here about Jewish attitudes toward government and its exercise. The classic Christian division into the "two swords" of government, for instance, is most blatantly contradicted by the majoritarian - indeed, vir- tually unanimous - view of mainstream Jewish thinking, which simply does not abide the division into Church and State to which the paradigm must logically lend itself - and to which, indeed, it has ultimately led in the Western world.8 The tripartite division suggested by Montesquieu is simi- 7. For which the conventional source is De l'Esprit des Lois, bk. XI, chap. 6. No attempt is here made to determine whether Montesquieu actually invented the notion; that is a scholastic minefield which has already led to the spilling of much ink. Suffice it to say that "this idea was by Montesquieu expounded with greater insight and elaboration than anyone before him; he possessed it more fully than they did, saw fully into its implications and into the conditions, social and psychological, of it being realised. It is his idea by right of conquest." J. Plamenatz, Man and Society, vol. 1 (London, 1963), p. 194. 8. See M. Sicker, "Rabbinic Political Thought" (Ph.D. diss., New School for Social Research, 1972), pp. 384-387. This interpretation also points out that a closer study of each of the quotations adduced here suggests that they did not really constitute constitutional com- ments of the sort which we seek. Rather, they fall into the category of incidental intrusions, each in its own way of intrinsic interest as an indication of the extent to which the Jewish tradi- tion has sporadically managed to pick up occasional statements from other traditions and assi- milate them to its own use. They cannot, however, be elevated to the level of comprehensive - and specifically Jewish - statements of political fact or political theory, to which, indeed, they are basically alien.</page><page sequence="8">34 STUART A. COHEN larly at odds with the mainstream of the Jewish political tradition, albeit for different reasons. From the Jewish point of view, Montesquieu placed the cart before the horse. His principal concern was with the examination and definition of the major functions of government - which branch was to be responsible for which actions. In his view, a balanced separation of powers constituted a virtually mechanistic guarantee of constitutional freedom, and was therefore an end in itself. ("Liberty does not flourish because men have natural rights or because they revolt if their rulers push them too far; it flourishes because power is so distributed and so organized that whoever is tempted to abuse it finds legal restraints in his way.") Jewish traditions and experience of government, however, suggested a different order of priorities. How governmental institutions ought to exercise power became a secondary consideration; whence they derive the authority to do so was a subject of prior importance. To put matters another way, the exponents of the Jewish political tradition (over the long haul) considered it proper to tackle the issue of the precise source of constitutional power before getting down to an examination of the appropriate functions of constitutional instruments. It is this which explains why Jewish commentaries addessed themselves to an entire range of questions which Montesquieu (quite rightly, by his own standards) would have considered antecedent to his own concerns: What is the nature of the Jewish people's particular covenantal relationship with God? Within the framework of that covenant, which instrumentalities pos- sess the right to interpret the relationship and make it effective? Whence do they derive the discretionary powers of exegesis and implementation which might enable them to do so? The answers to these questions, it is here suggested, both reflected and enhanced the covenantal traditions of the Jewish political heritage. In their descriptions of the just governmental system, Jewish sources posit a frame- work which is both federal in arrangement and consensual in tone. More explicitly, they depict the distribution of political power among three dis- tinct clusters of governmental authority: the sphere of the torah; that of the kehunah (priesthood); and that of the malkhut (kingship). Each of these domains possesses a distinct franchise, with prerogatives laid down in various sets of law-making enunciations. As thus ordained, the torah consti- tutes the vehicle whereby God's teachings to Israel are interpreted, specified, and transmitted; the kehunah, the conduit whereby God and the edah are brought into constant contact and close proximity; the malkhut, the legiti- mately empowered means whereby civic relationships are structured and regulated in accordance with the covenantal stipulations of the divinely</page><page sequence="9">THE CONCEPT OF THE THREE KETARIM 35 ordained constitution. Demarcating these authoritative combinations are divisions not of function but of interest. Their distinctions lie less in the needs they serve than in the perspectives which they bring to bear on Jewish political conduct. Each of these domains is regarded as possessing a distinct focus of interest, an attribute which is reflected in their behavior as separate mediating devices between God and His people. Each keter, in effect, acts as a particular prism on the constitution of the Jewish polity. Accordingly, each is entitled to exercise a constitutional check on the others. III References to the tripartite division between the torah, the kehunah, and the malkhut are scattered throughout biblical and rabbinic literature. In the former, the categorization seems sometimes to be implied by the structural arrangement of the text;9 in the latter it is often referred to obliquely (as in the aggadic passage relating to Moses, quoted above, p. 30). It is most prominently to be found, however, in sources dating from the talmudic period, where these domains are first specifically referred to as the three ketarim. ' 9. Most notably in the outlines of governmental provisions to be found in Deuteronomy, chaps. 17 and 18, wherein, after a general introduction (17:8-13), separate paragraphs are allotted to the appointment and prerogatives of the melekh (Deut. 17:14-20), the kohanim and levi'im (18:1-8), and the navi (18:9-22). This division established a form to which, it appears, the Jewish political tradition thereafter remained remarkably faithful. The source is impor- tant, since - from the viewpoint of biblical chronology - it provides early evidence for a theory of Jewish civics in conditions of independent statehood. It is also, admittedly, somewhat problematical. Confusion is likely to be engendered by the appearance of the word yorukhah (from the same root as torah) in juxtaposition to the judicial functions of the priests (17:11). For a discussion of this point that largely does away with the difficulty, see A. Cody, A History of Old Testament Priesthood (Rome, 1969), pp. 114-123, esp. p. 119. For an explicit exegetical application to these passages of the conceptual framework posited here, see the sixteenth-century commentary Torat Mosheh to Deut. 18:1 by Moses Alshekh of Safed, especially par. 6: "Here are the three ketarim ..." 10. Of which the most succinct, and probably the best known, is to be found in Mishnah Avot 4:13: "Rabbi Simeon said: 'There are three crowns: the crown of torah, the crown of kehunah, and the crown of malkut; but the crown of a good name excels them all.'" The pur- pose of this particular epigram is manifestly ethical - and that is how it has quite properly been interpreted in the standard commentaries. Nevertheless, the need to acknowledge the heuristic intentions of R. Simeon cannot be transposed into an excuse for ignoring the political realities upon which his statement was based - and which probably rendered it all the more intelligible to his contemporaries. As much was appreciated by the author of A vot de Rabbi Natan (chap. 41), as well as by such medievals as Duran and Bartenoro, all of whom did in fact go to some lengths to establish the biblical basis for each of the three ketarim. Unfortunately, their efforts</page><page sequence="10">36 STUART A. COHEN The timing, it may be suggested, is both significant and neat. It is signifi- cant because the term emerged during one of the most convulsive periods of Jewish constitutional history. The first three centuries of the common era span the fall of the Second Commonwealth, the failure of the Bar Kochba revolt, the flowering of rabbinic Judaism, and the rise to authority of the great centers of Jewish government and scholarship in Babylon. Any one of these phenomena might have been expected to necessitate a significant degree of political stock-taking. Together, they generated a complete consti- tutional reappraisal which both summarized the principles of previous con- stitutional practice and shaped much of the form of subsequent constitu- tional development. Moreover (as was often the case in Jewish constitution- al history), the process was essentially conservative in style. Earlier political modes were not totally abandoned; rather, they were now fully articulated and - in the process - preserved for future adaptation and enhancement. From that point of view, the timing of the use of the term ketarim is also neat. Chronologically, the early talmudic period constitutes something of a halfway house in Jewish constitutional development; it stands roughly equidistant from the genesis of the Jewish political tradition (the epoch of the patriarchs) and its present station. The form, structure, and terminology of that critical period can therefore perhaps serve as a benchmark for the study of Jewish constitutional development in its entirety. From it, the his- torian can delve back for earlier origins and manifestations and reach forward for later derivatives and echoes. Such has been the methodology employed here. No claim is made that during the talmudic era the three ketarim had reached their apogee, nor that the balance between them was - from a constitutional perspective - ideal (in many respects, in fact, quite the opposite was the case). Nevertheless, it was during that period of recur- rent constitutional crisis that something of an apotheosis was attained, with the claims of each keter and its respective instrumentalities being articulated in a particularly pungent form. have been completely wasted on some other observers, who complain that the original teaching "is only spoiled by laboured interpretations" (R. Travers Herford, The Ethics of the Fathers [New York, 1961], p. 113). Something of a case might be made for the adoption of an alternative term to that of ketarim. Zirin (lit. "garlands" or "wreaths"), for instance, might be considered one prospec- tive candidate, not least since it is employed in the Talmud to describe precisely the tripartite division with which we are here concerned (T.B. Yoma 72b). Significantly, however, Rashi's commentary on that particular text reverts to the more conventional ketarim - and it is in such respectable company that we beg to remain.</page><page sequence="11">THE CONCEPT OF THE THREE KETARIM 37 An initial examination of those claims reveals two features of immediate relevance; on the one hand, the autonomy of each of the ketarim; on the other, the interdependence of the tripartite system as a whole. The first finds expression in those texts which stress the intrinsic "sovereignty" of each keter (a concept itself nicely conveyed by the generic title itself, which is literally translated as "crowns"). They depict each as wielding - under God - independent authority within its own sphere of jurisdiction. This is the theme underlying the talmudic insistence that none but the principal instru- ment of the keter kehunah may enter the Holy of Holies; that only officers of the keter malkhut can lead the edah into a battle classified as milbemet reshut; and that no constitutional interpretation is valid unless it receives the sanction of the accredited representatives of the keter torah. No keter, is the clear implication, possesses a constitutional right to impinge upon the domain of the others, far less to deprive them of their proper constitutional franchises. As much is indicated by the attested historical circumstances of their creation. According to the classic sources, each keter originally derived its authority from a founding covenant of its own with God; the revelation at Sinai established the keter torah; the covenant with Aaron called into being the keter kehunah (Num. 25:13); the covenant with the house of David gave institutional form to the keter malkhut (Ps. 89:13, Ezek. 37:24-25)." These distinctions were further hallowed by the ordained differences in the internal structures of each keter. From the first, each possessed its own network of officers; each, furthermore, instituted its own procedures in order to determine the manner of their legitimate appointment and succes- sion.12 11. A vot de Rabbi Natan, loc. cit. For an early comparison of the "priestly" and "royal" covenants, see Ecclesiasticus 45:24-25. 12. As is the case in all political systems, the issue of legitimate succession poses problems of a particularly thorny nature. These are too intricate to be detailed here. Briefly stated, the Jewish political tradition requires that prospective candidates for appointment to governmental office (minui) fulfill at least two of the following three criteria: appropriate heredity (yibhus); popular approval and/or recognition (haskamah); and the enactment of a constitutionally recognized ceremony of induction into office (meshibiah - "anointment"; or semikhah - "ordination"). The point to be made here is that the "mix" between these various requirements varies from keter to keter, with no two ketarim demanding identical qualifications. As much is evident, to take but one example, from the deuteronomic passage quoted above: the melekh, in that case, derives his power from a process which combines both popular selection and divine approval (in later coronation ceremonies symbolized by both acclamation and meshibhah); the position of the kohanim is made principally dependent on genetic circumstances; the navi is "raised up from amongst his brethren" by virtue of his divinely inspired understanding of God's will (which can be given formal recognition within the keter by a process of semikhah, as in the case of Joshua, who was thus ordained by Moses).</page><page sequence="12">38 STUART A. COHEN Interdependence - the second characteristic of the arrangement here outlined - is no less marked a feature of the ketaric system. Essentially, this principle conveys the idea that no Jewish polity is constitutionally complete unless it contains representatives of all three ketarim in one form or another. They are, indeed, the governmental extensions of the three pillars upon which all society must rest; remove any one, and the entire edifice is bound to collapse.-3 They are not, therefore, perceived as severely compartmenta- lized spheres of jurisdiction, with one (or more) being responsible for mat- ters secular, and the other (or others) for matters religious. On the contrary, what characterizes the system in its entirety - indeed, what transposes it into a system - is the insistence that they must be seen jointly to participate in the most crucial areas of Jewish governmental life: judicial as well as legis- lative, military as well as sacerdotal. That is why authorized officers of all three ketarim must combine in order to give constitutional effect to acts of political significance - minor as well as major.'4 The proper Jewish polity, is the implication, is that which contains fully articulated and functioning institutions in all three ketarim. The good Jewish polity is that in which, furthermore, the balance between the ketarim is both buttressed and respected. In practice, of course, history rarely obliged by conforming to such neat categorization. Consequently, attested heights of constitutional perfection (as here outlined) were rarely attained. The three ketarim can be described as manifestly articulated entities during the ancient periods of independent Jewish statehood. Most obviously was this so during the First Common- wealth. The biblical account suggests that, after an initial period of gesta- tion, the system then settled into what might be described as a "classic" pattern: the prophets constituted the principal instruments of the keter torah; the priests those of the keter kehunah; and the kings those of the keter malkhut. The era of the Second Commonwealth promised to bring about the A thorough analysis of this issue - citing classic sources and specifically referring to the dif- ferences between the three ketarim - is to be found in Moses Sofer, Responsa Iatam Sofer, Orah Hayyim, no. 12. I am grateful to my student, Ms. Hildah Shatzburger, for drawing my attention to this source. 13. E.g., Joshua Falk Katz, Perishah to Tur, HIoshen Mishpat I, la; commentary on Avot 1:2. 14. The presence of representatives of all three ketarim in such major constitutional actions as the designation of the melekh is profusely illustrated in the Bible (e.g., 1 Kings 1). More inter- esting, because less obviously necessary, is the requirement that any extension of the city limits of Jerusalem, or of the boundaries of the Temple, similarly requires their joint presence. See Mish. Shavu'ot 2:2.</page><page sequence="13">THE CONCEPT OF THE THREE KETARIM 39 reemergence of a similar pattern, with the offices being occupied by (respec- tively) the sages, the priests, and - after the Maccabean revolt - the ethnarch. Even in ancient Israel, however, periods of equilibrium and har- mony between the three branches of government were few and far between. One possible instance is provided by events at the very beginning of the Israelite monarchy, when the Davidic kingship became an established fact of Jewish political life, but not yet an overweening influence over Jewish politi- cal development. Another might be sought at the very close of the biblical chronology, when the Ezra-Nehemiah covenant laid down new ground rules for Jewish constitutional expression in circumstances which necessitat- ed a high degree of inter-keter cooperation. But even thus to identify brief moments of apparent constitutional equilibrium is to demonstrate the extent to which - even in the classical phase - they were exceptional. The predo- minant picture of Jewish government was far more turbulent and, for pre- cisely that reason, far more interesting. For the most part, Jewish constitu- tional history (biblical and postbiblical alike) is shot through with the records of continuous tensions between accredited representatives of the three ketarim, few of whom adhered strictly to the boundaries of their pre- scribed constitutional demesnes, and most of whom sought to attain a pre- ponderance of political power and the preeminence of their own facet of constitutional interpretation. It is these conflicts which, it is here suggested, account for the recurrence of tension which underlay such a large propor- tion of the intricate gyrations of Jewish politics, both sectional and national. IV Any synoptic examination of Jewish constitutional history from that perspective must begin by noting the fundamental resilience of the tripartite structure of the ketarim. For all the vicissitudes of Jewish public life, the basic parameters of the triad seem constantly to have reasserted themselves. Throughout every epoch of Jewish constitutional history, and within vir- tually every arena of Jewish political organization - in the diaspora as well as in Eretz Israel - each of the ketarim can be seen to have found some form of institutional expression. This characteristic is, in retrospect, even more remarkable than the periodic strains which have marked the relation- ships between representatives of these three domains. Indeed, what has to be noted in this context is not that the ketarim were often engaged in struggles for constitutional superiority, but that the struggles were never taken to</page><page sequence="14">40 STUART A. COHEN extremes. If the sources are to be believed, the weapons employed were those of usurpation rather than destruction. Classic Jewish records provide not a single instance of the utter elimination of one keter by another (or by a combination of the other two); neither, for that matter, do they indicate a successful attempt on the part of one keter to indicate that the existence of any other is either illegitimate or unnecessary. What can be discerned, rather, are numerous examples of a process of co-option. Principal instru- ments of one keter attempted (sometimes, and for limited periods, success- fully so) to attain commanding authority within the edah by posing as the repositories of two domains. By thus amalgamating prerogatives and wear- ing, as it were, two crowns, they contrived to neutralize the constitutional influence of the third and subject its officers to their own particular will. The historical circumstances which generated such shifts in the balance of power between the three ketarim can be variously categorized. In some (isolated) instances, the sources indicate that a degree of imbalance must be attributed to God's own will. Such is the case with Moses, the divinely desig- nated eved adonai, who combined the principal offices of both the keter torah and the keter malkhut (and, to boot, ordained the chief officer of the keter kehunah - Lev. 8:12). 5 In a second category, the stimulant to a similar monopoly of power seems to have been more properly foreign, in the sense of being the direct consequence of the actions of a non-Jewish agency. The most blatant example appears to be that of the early talmudic nasi. For- mally, his seat of authority lay in the keter torah. With the approval of the victorious Roman authorities, however, incumbents of this office were also able to straddle the domain of the keter malkhut - and thus to acquire a degree of preponderance not recalled since the days of Moses himself.'6 The most arresting cases of constitutional usurpation, however, were of a third kind: where the stimulants appear to have been primarily - and often exclusively - internal. They are not directly attributable to an ex machina agency located beyond the formal confines of the edah but to forces and movements at work within one of its component domains. Alterations in the relationships between the ketarim, in other words, were in this cate- 15. The fact that the appointee, Aaron, was also his brother, tended further to increase Moses' authority; it also helped to incite the discontent expressed by Korab. See Rashi's com- mentary to Num. 16:3. 16. Significant, in this context, is the Talmud's comparison of Moses and R. Judah ha- Nasi, both of whom combined "torah and greatness [gedulah]," to which Rashi adds: Moses "was superior to all Israel in malkhut and torah, so was Rabi [Judah ha-Nasi] in the nesi'ut and torah" (T.B. Gittin 59a and Sanhedrin 36a).</page><page sequence="15">THE CONCEPT OF THE THREE KETARIM 41 gory allied to changes of institutional command and procedure within indivi- dual ketarim. The two processes were interdependent, not only because one preceded or succeeded the other, but because they fed upon each other. The relationship was at once both organic and dynamic. It is true that this structure of relationships has often been obscured. The attested motives for many of the cases of attempted political usurpation which fall within the present category appear to have been prosaic. A highly personal quest for power - even though occasionally decked out in ideolo- gical garb - provided a conventional, but nonetheless viable, explanation for several of the constitutional struggles of Jewish history. Often, in fact, such struggles were depicted as nothing more remarkable than the indivi- dual aspirations and ambitions of the dramatis personae who stalk the pages of all mainstream Jewish demonologies. But even when due allowance is made for this aspect of human nature," appropriate note might also be taken of the mold into which Jewish constitutional struggles have been invariably cast. Once attention is shifted from the immediate motives of par- ticular episodes to their underlying structure, a recurrent pattern of conflict begins to emerge. Periods of relative constitutional stability, when the balance of power between the three ketarim was held more or less stable, seem to have been followed by moments of constitutional crisis, when one keter harnessed sufficient strength to assert preponderating claims which necessitated a readjustment of the alignment in its entirety. That readjust- ment itself held sway for some time, until it was in turn tried, tested, and - if found to be incapable of resisting the aggrandizement of another keter - superseded by a new constellation of the forces. The evolution of this somewhat cyclical pattern can best be illustrated by the examination of various examples, each of which facilitates its analysis step by constitutional step. One striking instance of the genesis of the pro- cess is provided by the kingship of Solomon; another can be discerned during the reign of Alexander Yannai. Both epochs witnessed the emergence of a particularly strong keter malkhut. In both cases, moreover, that keter attempted to attain constitutional preponderance by encroaching upon roles 17. And it is significant that classic Jewish sources do acknowledge the weight which it deserves. "R. Joshua ben Kovsai said: 'All my life I ran away from executive authority [serarah]; now that I wield it, I pour a pot full of boiling water on all who would take it away from me. Just as the pot burns, injures, and sullies - so do I act' " (T.B. Menabot 109b, T.J. Pesabim 6:1). Contrast this with the apolitical stream of Jewish thought expressed in the injunc- tion to "love work and hate mastery [rabbanut], and do not acquaint yourself with government [reshut]" (Mish. Avot 1:10).</page><page sequence="16">42 STUART A. COHEN which properly belonged to another keter. By constructing the Temple, it has been pointed out, Solomon clipped the political wings of the kohanim at the same time as he expanded their sacerdotal functions and provided them with economic security - a masterly stroke.'" Yannai's achievement, although equally important, was considerably less dramatic. It was an acci- dent of birth, which ensured that all Hasmoneans were genetically kohanim, that gave him a foot in both domains. The significance of each of these episodes lies as much in the responses to which they gave rise as in the circumstances from which they evolved. Each was considered to endanger the constitutionally ordained balance between the ketarim, and was on those grounds resisted by the keter which felt itself to be dangerously isolated. In the two cases here cited, for example, it was spokesmen for the keter torah who recalled the necessity for power-sharing arrangements. During the biblical monarchies the principle was ultimately to be invoked by the nevi'im, whose conflicts with the instruments of royal tutelage (kohanim included) consequently became endemic (e.g., Amos 7:10-17). During the Maccabean kingship it was enunciated by the Phari- saic sages. Clearly, it was Yannai's usurpation of a second of the three crowns which aroused their ire, quite as much as his rude infringements of the niceties of sacerdotal protocol or the alleged murky circumstances of his mother's past. "Suffice yourself with the keter malkhut," they exhorted him in a classic exposition of the thesis, "and leave the keter kehunah to the descendants of Aaron" (T.B. Kiddushin 66a). A range of factors ultimately determined the fate of such constitutional struggles. Hard-and-fast rules are difficult to ascertain, since conditions vary from one constitutional crisis to another, and success was therefore dependent upon the particular political circumstances attendant upon each. In some cases, much depended on the autonomy of the putative arrange- ment intimated by the aggressive keter and its consequent immunity to external interference, whether divine or gentile. (If, to take a very early example, Koralh and his entire edah are swallowed up by a miraculous earth- quake, then there can be no likelihood of the eved adonai being easily ousted from his anomalous position. Similarly, there was little hope for a restored 18. Of course, the construction of the Temple essentially culminated a process; it did not set a trend. Solomon's blunt deposition of Abiathar (1 Kings 2:26) had already indicated the balance of forces between the two ketarim. See A. Alt, "Formation of the Israelite State in Palestine," in Essays on Old Testament History and Religion (Oxford, 1960), p. 218 and fn. 17; Y. Aharoni, The Land of the Bible (London, 1966), pp. 268-273; and E. W. Heaton, Solomon's New Men: The Emergence of Ancient Israel as a Nation State (London, 1974), pp. 50-51.</page><page sequence="17">THE CONCEPT OF THE THREE KETARIM 43 and independent keter malkhut in Eretz Israel after 135 C.E., when the Roman suzerain restricted its dealings almost entirely to the nesi'ut.) More generally, however, the factors determining the fate of a move toward con- stitutional usurpation seem to have been internal, and to have depended upon the responses of the concerned branches of the Jewish constitutional system itself. At this level, two other sets of circumstances generally proved to be par- ticularly decisive. One was the cohesiveness of the keter which had originally sought to usurp power and to bring about a constitutional realignment. As much is again illustrated by the sequence of events during the biblical and Hasmonean monarchies. In the former case, it was the recurrence of dynas- tic squabbles within the Judean royal household which enabled Jehoiada, the kohen gadol, to reassert his rightful constitutional authority and play a crucial role in the coronation of Joash (as did Hilkiah the kohen gadol in the reforms of Josiah). In the latter, it was the internecine strife between Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II, leading to the intervention of Pompey, which brought about the accession of Herod - who did not share Yannai's yihus and could not, therefore, possibly continue to function as the principal instrument of the keter kehunah as well as the keter malkhut. Equally influential, however, was the response of the keter which felt itself to be most threatened by a possible combination of the other two. Here, too, Jewish history provides no infallible recipe for success. In some cases, representatives of threatened ketarim attempted to thwart their adver- saries by advocating a strategy of entrenchment and conservatism. Such, to quote an early example, was the reaction of the prophet Samuel to the pros- pect of a mighty keter malkhut.9" Elsewhere, and more successfully, the chosen course was that of reform and flexibility. Threatened ketarim managed to survive, not by clinging with gritty determination to their for- mer institutions and procedures, but both by adapting to the new constitu- tional circumstances and, where and when necessary, by inventing new ones. Such, most notably, was the policy pursued by the keter torah during the 19. For which the classic source is 1 Sam. 8:11-18. Within the present context, two points are worthy of note in regard to this passage. The first is the phrase mishpat ha-melekh, which may (or may not) be a deliberate echo of Deut. 18:3 (mishpat ha-kohanim) possibly designed to contrast the two domains. The second is Samuel's own position. By virtue of his status and activities (and rather ambivalent title: ro'eh - "seer"), he may be described as a leader with a foot in both the keter torah (as a prophet) and the keter malkhut (as a military leader). The fact that, in his youth, he had also ministered at Shiloh might also have left him with residual claims on the keter kehunah. The coupling of his name with that of Moses and of Aaron in Psalms 96:6 certainly raises an intriguing question (cf. T.B. Rosh ha-Shanah 25a-b).</page><page sequence="18">44 STUART A. COHEN First and Second Commonwealths in response to the dangerous aggrandize- ment of the keter malkhut and its usurpation of the authority of the keter kehunah. In the former case, its response was to adumbrate a distinct "prophetic code," which emphasized the keter torah's claims to be the repository of the edah's moral conscience. During the Hasmonean mon- archy the threat was similarly countered by the formulation of new - and distinctly nonpriestly - rules and procedures for constitutional interpreta- tion and exegesis, and their incorporation into the tradition as the torah shebe'al peh.20 Both developments were far more than the reflexive reactions of spokesmen for popular resistance to royal absolutism (though they were that too). They were, perhaps above all, attempts to repair infringements of the constitutionally ordained balance of power between the ketarim by the invention and application of new mechanisms which might restore some balance to the structure which one keter considered to have been under- mined by the actions of another. It is the hypothesis of the present paper that the pattern thus outlined did not come to an abrupt end with the destruction of the Second Temple. The structure of the three ketarim was subsequently preserved, not only in occa- sional disquisitions of a theoretical nature, but in the practical manifesta- tions of Jewish governmental forms. Not even the heterogeneous nature of diaspora circumstances, it is here contended, entirely obliterated an appar- ent Jewish commitment to the maintenance of the three ketarim. As expres- sions of governmental forms, they proved to be remarkably persistent and significantly universal. Therein, it might be suggested, lies the intrinsic interest of the paradigm and the possible value of its use as an analytical tool for the study of Jewish constitutional history in its entirety. That history can, indeed, profitably be structured around the fate and fortunes of each of the ketarim and can be analyzed from the perspective of their triangular relationships. In this way, observers might be enabled to view Jewish consti- tutional history not as a record of disparate events but as something approx- imating to a carefully structured three-legged race in which the participants - even though often out of step and not infrequently tripping each other up - seem generally to be heading toward the same constitutional goal. 20. For one view of the political thrust of Pharisaic exegesis, see L. Finkelstein, New Light from the Prophets (London, 1969): "The Mishnah in all its versions was a proclamation of the authority of the non-priestly scholar as opposed to that of the Temple priests. It was used by the Pharisaic teachers, spiritual heirs of the Prophets and the Men of the Great Synagogue, to show that they, and not the contemporary High Priests, were the authorized interpreters of the Law" (p. 82). See also J. Neusner's comment in A Life of Yohanan ben Zakkai: Ca. 1-80 C.E.,</page><page sequence="19">THE CONCEPT OF THE THREE KETARIM 45 V If the essential resilience of the structure of the three ketarim seems often to have been obscured, the principal reasons might lie in the nature of Jewish historiography. The vast majority of the surviving records for a study of Jewish constitutional developments derive, almost exclusively, from rab- binic sources. They were compiled by persons who regarded themselves as linear intellectual descendants of the prophets, and hence similarly entitled to serve as the mediators of God's commandments and the interpreters of His constitutional decrees. For precisely that reason, the sources tend to slant matters in such a way as to emphasize the keter torah's version of the march of events. That version, indeed, has become something like the "offi- cial" Jewish constitutional record. To say that is not to deny that the rab- binic sources do themselves faithfully acknowledge the theoretical rights of the other ketarim to an independent form of constitutional expression. Neither is it to disregard the fact that some of the philosophical and kabba- listic literature produced by subsequent generations (such as the Sefer ha-.Hasidim of the thirteenth-century Ijasidei Ashkenaz or the more in- fluential Zohar compiled at roughly the same time in Sepharad) also provide glimpses of streams of thought which were at variance with the conventional rabbinic trend. Nevertheless, not until comparatively recently do we begin to possess the range of communal and individual records which might con- tribute toward a comprehensive interpretation of events from the perspec- tives of each of the three domains. Until then, the historian is constrained to rely upon sporadic digressions in an area which is for the most part domi- nated by the vast corpus of halakhic literature at its various levels and in its various literary forms. It is this circumstance, more than any other, which has contributed to a Jewish version of the "Whig" view of constitutional history. Those segments of the edah which are perceived to express sympathy for the claims of the keter torah are generally singled out for attention and examined with sym- pathy; representatives of other attitudes tend to be neglected and their posi- 2d ed.

He did not have any function in the Temple service which might support his demand to direct and interpret the rites. On the con- trary the sage's only authentication was his teaching and his own embodiment of the burden of his message. He represented a third force in religion, opposed to the two primary elements of charisma and traditional routine. These two elements were united in the experience of the 'Torah.'</page><page sequence="20">46 STUART A. COHEN tion hardly explored at all. Furthermore, and precisely because the vast majority of Jewish opinions on matters constitutional are to be found in the classic storehouses of halakhic works (the Talmud and its commentaries; the great codes; and the responsa literature), they almost invariably articulate the perspectives of the keter torah, by whose representatives they were for the most part compiled. Not only do they insist on the necessity for the full participation of that keter in Jewish government (a view which is incontesta- ble), but also on its inherent supremacy (which is far more debatable). Care- fully selected biblical verses are subjected to close scrutiny,2' and then tendentiously set to a purpose which is as avowedly political as manifestly moralistic. They are the props upon which major halakhic authorities of the High Middle Ages supported their contention that the keter torah was entitled to be considered the final arbiter of constitutional interpretation.22 They are also the basis upon which earlier tannaitic sages had constructed a strict hierarchy of three ketarim. It has been found to be said: there are three ketarim - the keter torah, the keter kehunah, and the keter malkhut. Aaron merited the keter kehunah and took it; David merited the keter malkhut and took it; but behold the keter torah is not apportioned. This in order not to give an excuse for people to say: "Were the keter kehunah and keter malkhut still available, I would have merit- ed them and taken them." Behold the keter torah; it is an admonition to every- body. For anyone who merits it is considered by God as though he had merited all three. Conversely, anyone who does not merit it is considered by God as though all three ketarim were available and he had forfeited them all. And should you say: "Which is the greater?" R. Simeon b. Elazar used to say: "Who is greater, he who anoints the ruler or he who rules [ha-mamlikh o ha- molekh]? Obviously the former .. ." The entire essence of the other two ketar- im is derived solely from the strength of the keter torah; as it is said: "By me kings reign ... by me princes rule" [Prov. 8:15-16]." The Covenant which God entered into with Aaron is greater than that He entered into with David. (Sifrei to Numbers, chap. 119.) 21. See, for example, the exegesis of Deut. 17:11, 17:18, and 32:7 in such passages as T.B. Shabbat 21a-23b, which are themselves amplified in such later commentaries as those of Nabmanides (e.g., to Deut 17:11). The manner in which these verses are thus examined stands in marked contrast to the treatment accorded to other passages, whose thrust is somewhat dif- ferent. For a summary of much of this trend, see Abarbanel's commentary on 1 Sam. 8:4-7 in his Perush al Nevi'im Rishonim, pp. 202-210. 22. E.g., Maimonides, Hilkhot Mamrim 1:1-2, and the sources quoted in M. Elon, Ha-Mishpat ha-Ivri: Toldotav, Mekorotav, Ekronotav, 3 vols. (Jerusalem, 1973), pp. 220-221.</page><page sequence="21">THE CONCEPT OF THE THREE KETARIM 47 One striking example of the qualitative imbalance which can be pro- duced by the quantitative discrepancy in the source materials is provided by the keter torah's claims to unique continuity. For a large proportion of Jewish history its spokesmen have claimed that they speak for the branch of Jewish government that is not only the most senior of the three but also the one that has been least subject to modifications in structure and form. Ever since mishnaic times (at least) they have claimed to wear a seamless cloak of uninterrupted interpretation and consecutive exegesis, and hence to embody that segment of the polity which has been least subject to disturbance. That, clearly, is the thrust of such historical excursi as Mishnah A vot 1:1 ("Moses received the Torah from Sinai and passed it on to Joshua, Joshua to the elders, the elders to the prophets, the prophets to the men of the Great Assembly . . ."). That, too, is the implication of the various legal formulas which establish rules of halakhic precedence (e.g., hilkhata ke-vatra'ei). Such passages are designed to emphasize the perpetuity, as well as the supre- macy, of rabbinic discourse. Not surprisingly, therefore, they have been assiduously cited in every one of the constitutional referents and commen- taries in whose composition representatives of the keter torah have played a commanding role.23 All proclaim that the thread which linked the talmudic hakhamim to Moses continued to stretch, unbroken, down through the amoraim, savoraim, geonim, posekim - even to the gedolei ha-dor of later eras. The extent to which such claims are justified in the case of the keter torah may, it seems, have been exaggerated. The story of that domain, as has already been indicated, is not one of uninterrupted continuity. Both the First and Second Commonwealths witnessed revolutionary shifts in the persona and institutions of the keter torah. Challenges which originated out- side its own sphere of constitutional jurisdiction then required its represen- tatives to formulate new forms of constitutional interpretation. These remained distinct from those of the contemporary keter malkhut and keter kehunah, but they were also noticeably different from those adopted by 23. E.g., Ibn Daud's introduction to his twelfth-century Sefer ha-Kabbalah, ed. G. Cohen (Philadelphia, 1966), p. 3: "The purpose of this Book of Tradition is to provide students with the evidence that all the teachings of our rabbis of blessed memory, namely, the sages of the Mishnah and the Talmud, have been transmitted: each great sage and righteous man having received them from a great sage and righteous man ... as far back as the men of the Great Assembly, who received them from the prophets, of blessed memory all." See also the introduc- tions to such great codes as those compiled by Maimonides, Asher ben YeIhiel, and Joseph Caro (which are all conveniently quoted in Elon, Mishpat Ivri, vol. 3).</page><page sequence="22">48 STUART A. COHEN previous institutions of the keter torah itself. The navi of the monarchy was not an exact replica of the ro'eh of the era of the judges; neither was the talmid .hakham of the Talmud a carbon copy of the navi. (That, it might be argued, is one reason why spokesmen for the keter torah during the talmudic era went to such lengths to emphasize that they were the legitimate heirs of the prophets' mantle. The difference between the two instrumentalities was too obvious to be passed over in silence.)24 Equal note might be taken of the changes which affected the develop- ment of the keter torah at a later stage, when its claims to continuity and uniformity are less open to question. The shifts, it must be pointed out, were more evolutionary than convulsive; but they are noticeable for all that. The yeshivot of the high and late Middle Ages were not the precise equivalents of the earlier recruiting grounds for officers in the keter torah, the metivtot of Bavel.25 Neither can the rabbinate of the early modern period, with its strict bureaucracy and heavy formality, be regarded as a replica of the institution- al forms fashioned by the talmidei bakhamim of talmudic times.26 Finally, there has been the response of the keter to the circumstantial and intellectual challenges of the contemporary age. The postemancipation emergence of modern "schools" of interpretation (the neo-Orthodox, the Conservative, the Reform) seems - from a strictly constitutional perspective - to provide appropriate indices of the continuing vigor of the keter torah. That develop- ment has, admittedly, produced divisive effects, some of which have brought about the diffusion of the demesne. It has not, however, caused its dissolu- tion. On the contrary, by stimulating the establishment of new "seats" of Jewish learning (the rabbinical seminary, the theological college, and the 24. T.B.

According to one view: "In the world of the sages during the Temple period you find no bureaucratic organization - no sys- tem whatsoever of appointment, no promotion, no remuneration, nor even any real arrange- ments for training or definition of functions. Likewise, there were, of course, no titles; simply the personal name of the sage was used. The titles 'rabban' or 'rabbi' are of a later time." E.

Be that as it may, a synoptic historical survey suggests that the survival of the keter torah (in its various manifestations) need not be regarded as a unique phenomenon in the history of the Jewish political tradition. Indeed, when due account is taken of the potentially destructive pressures exerted on the keter kehunah and the keter malkhut, it is their resilience which would appear to be the more remarkable. They, too, participated in the Jewish struggle for survival in its constitutional manifestations. Similarly, they both developed characteristics of dynamism and flexibility necessary for their continuity. Hence each periodically effected multiple changes in its institu- tional structures and operational procedures. At one level, these took the form of the invention and utilization of a rich variety of terms to describe their principal instruments. At another, they generated more fundamental searches for new means of expression within the original terms of reference. These changes undoubtedly wrought realignments in their individual forms and manifestations. But, notwithstanding the various overlays of termino- logy and nomenclature, they did not cause their total disappearance. Still less did they precipitate structural alterations of a fundamental character in the system as a whole. Both the keter kehunah and the keter malkhut contin- ued to articulate the Jewish political tradition's demand for two constitu- tional perspectives which were independent of the keter torah. Both, accord- ingly, were granted some degree of whatever formal or informal authority the edah possessed in the management of its own affairs. It is less difficult to substantiate this thesis in the case of the keter malkhut than in the case of the keter kehunah. In part, the reasons are func- tional. In every one of the epochs of Jewish constitutional history there has existed a perceived need for the presence of civic instrumentalities - em- powered to participate in the formulation of public policies, the adjudica- tion of communal disputes, and the execution of political requirements. These were functions which no representatives of the keter torah ever attempted to fulfill by themselves for any significant length of time. Once the monarchy had received divine sanction, there was no valid precedent for their attempting to do so. David ha-Melekh, after all, had been mashiah adonai ("the Lord's anointed") and the designated forebear of the Messiah. His direct descendants, therefore, possessed a far more personal claim to partnership in the constitutional framework than did most representatives of the keter torah. For precisely that reason, every nasi in early talmudic</page><page sequence="24">50 STUART A. COHEN Palestine, like every resh galuta in Babylon, stressed his pedigree as nir le-veit david.27 Conventional rabbinic qualifications, which most of them possessed, were not their only criteria of office. The seat of their authority lay in another domain. Hence their claims to independence from (if not precedence over) such representatives of the keter torah as the av bet din and the geonim (respectively). Subsequent officers of the keter malkhut attained equally substantial status. Most significantly was this so during the High Middle Ages, when no single instrumentality of that keter was operative at the very broadest level of Jewish communal organization. The centripetal nature of Jewish public life, as expressed by the emergence of the kehillah as the virtually autono- mous unit of Jewish government, greatly increased the weight of the keter torah. Its representatives, operating as a communications network which rested upon halakhic correspondence between individual posekim, then con- stituted the sole means of preserving the unity of the edah. Even they, however, did not deny parnassim, negidim, mishtadlim, and shtadlanim a legitimate share of Jewish communal authority. During the modern era, which witnessed the reemergence of wider civic instrumentalities of the Jewish polity, these rights were further buttressed. The postemancipation appearance of worldwide Jewish political spokesmen (as first exemplified by Moses Montefiore and Adolphe Cr6mieux), and subsequently of multi- country Jewish representative organizations (such as the Alliance Israelite Universelle, the Anglo-Jewish Association, B'nai B'rith, and the World Zionist Organization) demonstrated the extent to which the constitutional continuity of the keter had been preserved. The occasional overlapping of their claimed franchises was less significant than their collective claim to an authoritative voice in the making of Jewish public policy and their combined representation of interests which were clearly distinguishable from those bespoken by the keter torah. The establishment of the State of Israel, whose founding fathers deliberately invoked the slogans and symbols of Jewry's ancient political sovereignty, further underscored this development. Spora- dic Israeli claims that the agencies of the state possess a prior right to defend and represent Jewish civic interests throughout the world - however often challenged - are in many respects little more than an atavistic restatement 27.

The destruction of the Second Temple (an event which exerted an obviously crucial influence on the entire course of Jewish constitutional development) was for the keter kehunah a shock of catastrophic proportions. Admittedly, the weaknesses of this branch of government had long been apparent. Its independence had been undermined by the keter malkhut during the biblical monarchy, when kohanim were sometimes virtually reduced to the status of royal instrumen- talities. Despite the kehunah's increased prestige early in the Second Com- monwealth (especially under Ezra, himself a priest, and Simon ha-Zaddik, a kohen gadol), its principal officers had subsequently suffered from an increasing degree of disrepute, which had already become chronic by the middle generations of the Hasmonean monarchy.29 Nevertheless, the cessa- tion of the Temple service in 70 C.E. undoubtedly put an end to any hope that the situation might be rectified. At a stroke, the kohanim were then deprived of their sacerdotal roles and judicial functions. They were reduced - in fact if not in name - to the status of fossils, in possession of only marginal constitutional rights and honorific ceremonial duties. Under such circumstances, all attempts to revive the keter kehunah in its predestruction form, as a genetically unified and independent branch of Jewish govern- ment, were bound to fail.3" Readjustment, in this case, had necessarily to be a more protracted and complicated process. For a considerable length of time thereafter, accordingly, this keter virtually dropped out of sight. If the Jewish political tradition was to remain true to its own principles, however, this state of vacuum could not long persist. The tradition, to put it 28. C. S.

Whether or not any attempts were made remains an intriguing historical question. The thesis that the kohanim attempted to reestablish their cohesion and regain their authority was put forward by Buchler (Kohanim ve-A vodatam) and Dinur (in his commentary to Pirkei A vot). Both of these sources saw indications of this revival in the coup which brought about the deposition of Gamaliel II and his replacement by Elazar ben Azariah ha-Kohen. See G. Alon, Mekharim be-Toldot Yisrael, vol. 1 (Tel Aviv, 1967), p. 258.</page><page sequence="26">52 STUART A. COHEN baldly, could not suffer the complete disappearance of a domain which addressed constitutional issues from such an important perspective as the ritual dimension of Jewish life. It demanded the continued existence of a recognizable branch of government which would sanctify the polity by help- ing to bring God's presence into the lives of individual members of the edah. From this perspective, the destruction of the Temple merely compelled the domain to seek new instrumental expressions (parallel to the shift in the emphasis of ritual expressions, with the extension of synagogal worship to replace Temple service). It did not ultimately obviate the need for a separate branch of government which would sharpen the edah's awareness of the divine and interpret its constitution through such a prism. There was a con- tinued and felt need for a designated and legitimated instrumentality which would help the edah to achieve communion with God, and which might attempt to give some metaphysical meaning to His various manifestations. From a constitutional perspective, these functions could not be per- formed by the halakhic authorities who adopted the role of spokesmen for the keter torah. Their prisms were bound by the strictly codified doctrinal and juridical traditions of their own domain. Instead, they ultimately devolved upon a completely new spectrum of instrumentalities, whose claims to acquired sanctity increasingly came to rest upon the inspirational (and sometimes ecstatic) sources of the spiritual messages which they claimed to embody. Their ultimately philosophical heuristic objectives may not have been very different from those of the scribe-cum-rabbi of the tal- mudic genre. Like them, they were essentially concerned with a quest for synthesis, through the reconciliation of apparent ambiguities and the resolu- tion of seeming incongruities.3" Where they differed, however, was in the means whereby the depths of such concerns were explored and mediated. From the point of view of the keter kehunah, God and Israel had not merely to be associated by a stream of formal actions whose propriety was estab- lished through attested scholarship. They had also to be "married" through emotions and feeling. Godly government, in this sense, necessitated not only the regulating and ritualizing of specific and recurrent modes of behavior. It also required an explicit exploration of the metaphysical dimensions of the concepts upon which such regulations are based. The distinctions must not, of course, be exaggerated. Intellect and emo- tion, like scholarship and piety, were never regarded as opposites in the 31. J.

Rather, they were perceived as two sides of a coin which - in the most authentic of cases - were combined within the personality of a single individual. Nevertheless, these attributes were sufficiently distinct to be accorded separate designations. It is this, perhaps, which explains the use of a multiplicity of terms to describe the emergence of a range of communal instrumentalities who were collectively considered to fulfill public needs dis- tinct from those satisfied by recognized representatives of the keter torah and the keter malkhut. The darshan, the moreh horayah, the maggid, the ;addik - perhaps even the shaliah ;ibbur and the hazzan32 - provide examples of such roles at the most limited level of communal organization. (The modern communal rabbi of Western communities, who makes exten- sive use of the moralistic sermon from a pulpit when communicating with his congregants, in many ways epitomizes the type.)33 Groups and indivi- duals who might be be described as pietists and/or speculative thinkers (the .Iasidei Ashkenaz, the kabbalists, the theologians of the modern era) may be adduced as instances of figures who may be considered to have exerted a wider influence. None can be described as the functional descendants of the classical priesthood - most obviously since they do not perform the ritual services for which that class was solely responsible. Clearly, however, each was also significantly distinct from both the posek of the halakhah and the embodiment of Jewish civil government. Their role, rather, has been to serve as interpreters of the Jewish condition and thus to influence the tone of Jewish government.34 It was, in sum, by replacing the sacrament with the 32. An office which would once appear to have been of more than marginal importance. The term itself (possibly derived from the Akkadian bazzanu - "governor") is employed in mishnaic texts to describe a Temple officer (e.g., Sotah 7:7-8, Yoma 7:1-2) and was soon trans- posed to the synagogue (Tosefta Megillah 3:13 and T.J. Berakhot 9:4). For the hazzan's later participation - often formal - in Jewish communal affairs, see the sources quoted in L. Finkelstein, Jewish Self-Government in the Middle Ages (New York, 1936), p. 197, fn. 1; B. Rosensweig, Ashkenazic Jewry in Transition (Ontario, 1975), p. 42; and L. Landman, "The Office of the Medieval Hazzan," Jewish Quarterly Review 62 (1971-72): 156-187 and 246-276. Discussing one period, Landman notes: "As a result of the educational standards of the cantor- ate and the fact that they were considered 'the messengers of the community' to intercede with God on the community's behalf, the status of the cantor during the Geonic Age was on a very high level. In some areas, the hazzan was the head of the community." 33. For various discussions of this point, see G. S. Rosenthal (ed.), The American Rabbi (New York, 1977), especially A. Kass, "Watchmen for the Community," pp. 9-22; G. S. Rosenthal, "The American Rabbi as Theologian and Philosopher," pp. 77-96; and H. R. Rabinowitz, "The Rabbi as Preacher," pp. 117-140. 34.

COHEN word that they kept alive what has here been described as the essence of the priestly dimension of the constitution and that they reinforced (or re- awakened) the edah's awareness of its presence in the midst of the divine. VI To point to such changes is not, of course, to ignore the unique circum- stances by which each was generated. It is, however, to suggest that they might also be seen as extensions and expression of a wider pattern, and thus as evidence of the continuity of Jewish governmental forms over long periods and across cultural watersheds. It is at this level that an analysis of the three ketarim might facilitate an understanding of the workings of the Jewish political tradition. Through the three ketarim, the multifaceted character of the Jewish people seems to have found political as well as reli- gious expression in a way that constitutionalized power-sharing. By remain- ing faithful to that structure, moreover, the Jewish people might traditional- ly have prevented their political life from losing all unity of form. On both counts, it is here suggested, the concept would appear to warrant further investigation. At the very least, it might profitably be employed as an organizational device with whose assistance seemingly disparate elements of the Jewish constitutional story might be seen to adhere to a recognizable pattern. Furthermore, a study of changes within and between the ketarim might provide observers with a tool of analysis, with whose help they might measure the forces which have helped to shape the very texture of Jewish constitutional life. Bar-Ilan University Ramat Gan, Israel condition and past. By explicitly covenanting to ensure the remembrance of the Holocaust, par- ticipants in the gathering - led by Wiesel - undertook to reinforce the place of that experience as a motif of Jewish public life and behavior. The presence of the Prime Minister of Israel at the closing ceremony of the convention (which was held at the Western Wall) further contributed to the deep symbolic significance of the event, and to its possible reinforcement of the Holo- caust syndrome as an influence on Jewish political culture.</page></plain_text>
