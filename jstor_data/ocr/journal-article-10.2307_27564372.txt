Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006. xiv, 285 pp. doi:10.1017/S0364009408001293 The book is a series of originally independent studies on the historical significance of the aggadic material in the Bavli, continuing and developing this extremely prolific author's previous studies on these issues: Sages, Stories, Authors and Editors and The Sage in Jewish Society} The first four chapters compare Palestinian and Babylonian portrayals of several subjects: Chapter 1 compares their differing descriptions of Roman persecutions between 135 and 1. Sages, Stories, Authors and Editors (Atlanta, GA: Scholars Press, 1994); and The Sage in Jewish Society (New York: Routledge, 1999). 414</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 138 CE, demonstrating that Babylonian sources tend to emphasize the prohibi tions against Torah study, which points to the Bavli's "internal focus." Chapter 2 compares the way in which these different compositions depict events from the Second Temple period, claiming that Babylonian sources tend "to downplay the role of kings and to emphasize the role of sages" (38), especially with regard to their influence and control of the priesthood. This claim is reiterated in Chapter 3, which concentrates on Babylonian stories that employ the term "when the sages heard about the matter." Chapter 4 shows that the Bavli trans forms stories narrating mockery from heretics, Samaritans, or amei ha-a 'rez, to encounters between rabbis. Kalmin concludes that the Babylonian sage has little interest in encounters with others: "Palestinian rabbis tended to be more aware than Babylonian rabbis that their actions and opinions could or did provoke ridi cule among nonrabbis" (87). Kalmin thus endeavors to disclose what these sources reveal about the lives and beliefs o? real sages, not only the ideology of the Bavli's narrators or editors. The other chapters analyze various reflections of Sassanian realia in the Bavli. Chapter 5 discusses the influence of the Sassanian taboo on idols on the Jewish Babylonian attitude toward idolatry, and Kalmin finds an interesting gap between the reality reflected in the stories (i.e., a minimal record of idol worship) and rabbinic anxiety toward idolatry, which seems to exist inde pendently of real life: "more in the minds of the rabbis than grounded in the reali ties of life in Sassanian Persia" (109). Chapter 6 rereads Babylonian homilies about the Sassanian monarchy (especially B. Yoma' 10a) and claims that the objection of the rabbis to this dynasty, which came to power in the third century CE, was overemphasized in scholarship, as was its interest in "politics" in general. Kalmin claims that the Babylonian rabbis were much more closed and "inward-looking"?minding mainly their own business?than historians tended to believe. Chapter 7 examines the portrayal of the Sadducees in the Bavli, especially their designation as rejecting the oral Torah, and claims that the proximity between these portrayals and those found in Josephus (but not in Palestinian sources) testify to connections between Josephus or "Josephus-like traditions" and the Bavli. It further indicates that the appearance of such traditions in the Bavli does not precede the fourth century, a fact that strengthens Kalmin's thesis that the mid fourth century, the generation of Rava and Abaye, was a crucial period regarding the receptiveness of Babylonian sages to Palestinian (and more generally Western) influence. This thesis is further discussed in the conclusion, citing evidence from various areas of social interaction (charity, genealogy, marriage) to strengthen the claim that the fourth century was indeed a watershed in the "Palestinization" of the Babylonian sages, a process that transformed their attitudes toward the external world. Kalmin's thesis is thus twofold: (1) Babylonian rabbis were a relatively closed and inward-focused elite, uninterested in the external world (whether that of nonrabbinic Jews or Sassanian Persians). They confined themselves to the four walls of their study house and had literally only Torah in their life, much as their contemporaries of the Persian upper classes lived in a closed and rigid 415</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews hierarchy. The strong study house orientation of the Babylonian narratives was already discussed by Kalmin in his previous studies, as well as by several other scholars.2 The contribution of the present book to this discussion is the new evi dence it cites for this thesis. While scholars have tended to look mainly at narra tives referring directly to the study house, Kalmin widens his survey to narratives on various themes and issues, from kingship to heresy, which?thus Kalmin? betray the Bavli's orientation toward the internal interests of the sages. (2) A deep transformation in the attitude of Babylonian rabbis toward nonrabbis occurred in the fourth century, as revealed in discussions of marriage, lineage, and social interaction. Kalmin ascribes this transformation to a new encounter with Palestinian (and Hellenistic) ideas and traditions, which were more open and worldly oriented. The thesis is based on Zvi Dor's Tor at (erez yisra 'el be bavel (1971), which revealed a special connection between Rava and his students and Palestinian traditions. Kalmin, however, adapts this textual study into a wide historical reconstruction (appearing mainly in the introduction and conclusion). He further contextualizes this process as a result of the resettlement policy of King Shapur I during the third century. However, the century-long delay between the political events and their alleged cultural influence, not accounted for by the author, somewhat weakens this historical speculation. On the methodological level, Kalmin is conducting a dual polemic. On the one hand, he argues against the historians of Jewish Babylonia, who accept the Bavli as a reliable account of the amoraic period (even while rejecting its histori city in regard to Roman Palestine and the Second Temple period), without separ ating the different layers of the sugya, and without distinguishing Amoraic statements from post-amoraic additions. In various chapters, he claims that more attention to higher criticism may question the origin of some of the state ments ascribed to Amoraim in previous scholarship, revising the history of ideas in Jewish Babylonia; cases in point would be rabbinic attitudes to the Sas sanian dynasty (127) and to the Sadducees (157). On the other hand, Kalmin rejects the "radical" skeptical attitude that ques tions the very possibility "[of making] the leap from literature to history" (186). "History" is used by Kalmin to denote the practices and ideas of real sages in Babylonia who lived in the third to fifth centuries CE rather than those of the Bavli as a composition (or of its post-amoraic redactors). Kalmin rejects this pseu depigraphic thesis and tends to accept the attributions of the sources. As in his previous studies, Kalmin does not confine his historical reconstruc tions of the sages' intellectual history to explicit amoraic statements but bases his analysis on narratives as well. He contends that although the Bavli is known for thorough Babylonization of its narratives (see, e.g., David Goodblatt's analysis of B. Hor. 13b-14a; Isaiah Gafhi and others on B. BQ 117a; Hayyim Shapira 2. See Kalmin, The Sage in Jewish Society, 5-13. Jeffrey Rubenstein is most systematical in his Talmudic Stories: Narrative Art, Composition, and Culture (Baltimore, MD; Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999), 268-70; and The Culture of the Babylonian Talmud (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003), 31-35. 416</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews and Daniel Boyar?n on the Yavne stories in B. Ber. 27b-28a, and more), it does preserve systematic differences between its characterizations of Babylonian and Palestinian sages, a fact that can hardly be accounted for if we ascribe everything to the ideology of the redactors. Thus, the Bavli narrates many Palestinian rabbis coping with heretics but almost never discusses Babylonian ones doing the same. Similarly, the Bavli is almost silent about encounters of Babylonian rabbis with actual idolatry but generously attributes such encounters to Palestinian sages. This adds to the credibility of the (long slandered and defamed) Babylonian nar ratives, at least as far as the settings and patterns are concerned. This is, in my opinion, one of the book's most important and innovative insights. Had Kalmin distinguished more carefully between realities revealed in the narratives and the explicit lessons they promote, he might have supported his argument better. If the program is indeed attractive, its implementation is less than satisfactory. There is a somewhat disturbing gap between what the book claims to do and what it actually does. In most of the chapters, Kalmin confines himself to four or five "repre sentative" sources, which he complements with historical data from secondary litera ture. There is no attempt to encompass all relevant sources on a given matter, and many relevant sources are missing (see, e.g., B. Shab. 130a, San. 74a, 110a for the first chapter on Roman persecution). There is also relatively little serious lower-critical textual work, except for an occasional reference to Dikdukei Soferim (the rare textual discussion on page 126 is flawed, for the version of the Yemenite manuscript is a result of clear homeoteleuton, while the version Kalmin rejects appears in all other textual witnesses, including the second Yemenite ms. [JTS Rab. 1623]). Take, for example, the fifth chapter, which discusses idolatry in Babylonia. Kalmin deduces, on the basis of one sugya (B. AZ 54b-55a), that idolatry was conceived as a "significant threat" (116) by Babylonian sages. However, most of this sugya has a tannaitic parallel (mentioned, but not discussed, in note 46), and only one homily in it involves Babylonian sages. (Even this homily seems to be more about the murderous behavior of idolaters than about idol worship per se.) Based on this single story, a few other narratives (which express "no clear anxiety," 118), and with references to secondary literature on "the iconoclas tic taboo of Sassanian Zoroastrianism" (of which we do not know when and to what degree was implemented), Kalmin formulates his far-reaching conclusion about the "puzzling disconnect between reality 'on the ground' in Sassanian Baby lonia and the rabbis' experience of the world" (120). These reservations notwithstanding, the book is a serious contribution to the ongoing debate on the use of the Bavli as a historical source. It contains thorough and well-articulated methodological discussions, raises serious questions, suggests original solutions, and points toward possible directions for future scholarship.
