Westport, CT: Praeger, 2002. xiv, 299 pp. In the preface to The Hope Fulfilled, a history of the Zionist movement from the 1880s to 1948, Leslie Stein writes that, unlike other voluminous publications that have dealt with the history of modern Israel, he has attempted to provide a con- cise description of the events that led to the founding of the State of Israel. Focus- ing primarily on the political, military, and diplomatic aspects of Zionist history, this 275-page (sans glossary and index) volume is indeed a succinct yet thorough description that gives the student of Zionist history a sound introduction to the ori- gins and history of the movement. Stein's book offers a rather traditional account of Zionist history. As other histories of Zionism have done before, Stein traces both the development of the Yishuv in Eretz Yisrael and the evolution of the Zionist movement as a political body. As well, he tends to follow the conventional periodization of Zionist histo- ry, beginning with what he describes as the first nationalist wave of Jewish immi- gration in 1882, and then dividing Zionist history according to the different aliyot-waves of Zionist immigration to Israel-and according to the changes in British attitudes vis-a-vis the Zionist project. What sets this book apart from oth- er such histories of Zionism, in my mind, is the ease with which Stein's narrative flows and the vividness with which he portrays certain critical events in the histo- ry of Zionism. When he describes the first Zionist congress, for example, he pro- vides the reader with such a rich and lively picture of the clash of characters, ideologies, and backgrounds that the reader can clearly understand the carnival- like atmosphere that dominated the event. Also in his preface, Stein claims that his main goal was to provide the read- er with a balanced narrative (p. xi). It is unclear to me what a balanced historical narrative is or should be. Unlike an editorial newspaper page, a historical narra- tive is not supposed to mediate between conflicting sides of a political or ideolog- ical debate. Every choice that a historian makes-which events to describe, what sources to draw on-is politically and ideologically charged; and Stein's book makes clear, not balanced, choices, which is what a historian is ultimately expect- ed to do. Stein writes the history of Zionism from the perspective of modern Jew- ish history. He traces the emergence of the Zionist movement to events that shaped the lives of eastern-European Jews at the end of the nineteenth century and he de- scribes the Zionist settlement of Israel from the point of view of the Jewish set- tlers. The Arab point of view in this narrative, however, is barely represented. (It is perfectly legitimate to write the history of Zionism from a predominantly Jew- ish perspective just as it is entirely acceptable to write the history of Palestinian nationalism from an Arab perspective). While Stein's choice of perspective is utterly reasonable, his choice of sources is somewhat problematic. This book, which is based solely on secondary sources, was written in 2003, but it might just as well have been written in the early 1980s. The controversies and debates launched by the emergence of the New Israeli His- torians and the post-Zionist critics that have completely altered the contours of Zionist historiography over the past two decades are all but absent from Stein's 405</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews book. It would be very difficult to justify the fact, for example, that after the stud- ies of Benny Morris on the question of the Palestinian refugees (Morris's work is not alluded to in this book), Stein only dedicates two paragraphs to this critical episode in the history of the formation of the State of Israel. Furthermore, even the more traditional Zionist historians today would be wary of the type of hagiographic prose that Stein resorts to at times, like when he assesses the veracity of the account of Yoseph Trumpeldor's final words: "Whether Trumpeldor actually explicitly stat- ed that 'It is no matter; it is good to die for our country' is of no consequence; all his living actions clearly indicated that that was, in fact, his credo" (p. 151). The post-Zionist debates, whether one accepts the post-Zionist claims or re- jects them (and there are more indications that contemporary Israeli historians are moving away from many of the post-Zionist assertions), have certainly broadened the scope of Zionist historiography. Traditionally almost limited to the realm of diplomatic/military history, Zionist historiography has in recent years come to en- compass more social and cultural aspects. Regretfully, social and cultural analy- ses of Zionist history are mostly absent from Stein's account. For a student interested in a lucid and engaging, yet traditional, political and diplomatic account of the years leading to the creation of modern Israel, The Hope Fulfilled would be a good choice; it will not fulfill, however, the needs of a student interested in a more contemporary exposition of Zionist history that presents the Zionist experi- ence from a more complex and multilayered vantage point.
