<plain_text><page sequence="1">Norman Roth. Jews, Visigoths and Muslims in Medieval Spain: Cooperation and Conflict. Medieval Iberian Peninsula Texts and Studies, vol. 10. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1994. 367 pp. The intent of Norman Roth's work is to consider relations between Jews and Christians in Visigothic Spain and between Jews and Muslims in al-Andalus and Christian Spain. The author states that the topic of Jewish- Christian relations in later medieval Spain will be considered in a subsequent volume. Thus, both volumes together promise to provide a comprehensive discussion of the relations of Jews with other peoples in medieval Spain as a whole, and thus to provide an overview of the subject lacking in the more specialized works of E. Ashtor and Y. Baer, among others. Indeed, it appears that Roth's intent is to. provide, as well, a corrective to the views of Ashtor and other scholars in this field of research. In the present volume, he only partially fulfills these goals. Structurally, the first four chapters provide a general historical consider- ation of the topic, followed by more specific studies of such issues as urban life, cultural influence, and polemical encounter in chapters 5 through 7. It is the historical survey in the first four chapters which presents the book's greatest weakness. The organization of these chapters is unclear, and, as well, they appear to lack an overarching thesis. Roth tends instead to become engrossed in minutiae and rather tangential arguments. Although some of these are quite interesting, they render the work fragmented. The disjointed nature of his discussion is particularly evident in the section of chapter 1 entitled "The Jews under the Visigoths" (pp. 11-13),</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 167 where he ranges from the demographics of Jews under the Visigoths to a digression on the attractions of the Spanish climate and an attack on Bernard Bachrach's view on intermarriage, and then concludes with a discussion of Arianism and miscellaneous other scholarly arguments. The sections of the chapter concerning Jews in the light of Visigothic law and church councils devolve into mere listings of evidence. Roth argues that these subjects have been sufficiently summarized and analyzed previously. However, the reader is led to wonder why he simply repeats the information without discussing the earlier analysis in relation to his own thesis. Chapters 2 through 4 present an improved treatment of their topics. In particular, the section on Christian anti-Muslim sentiment in chapter 2 displays more depth of discussion and the balanced view that while the proximity of Spanish Christians to Muslims prevented the hostile stereotyping found in Northern Europe, there is evidence of some hostility to Muslims in Spanish Christian sources. Yet Roth still tends to raise an issue only to drop it again with the brief comment that it is "obviously too vast for any kind of coherent discussion here" (p. 52). This is enormously frustrating to the reader who expects a reasonably thorough discussion of all aspects of the issue even within a synthetic study of the large topic of Jews, Visigoths, and Muslims in medieval Spain. Because of Roth's brief and often superficial focus on a succession of smaller points, there is no coherent movement from topic to topic and central issues are often ignored. This is apparent in the lack of true conclusions to chapters 1 through 3. The fourth chapter does present such a conclusion, which stands, in fact, as a conclusion to the first four chapters and clearly summarizes Roth's previous points, arguing that Visigothic persecution of Jews had little influence on the law of later medieval Christian Spain. Chapters 5 through 7, which concern specific aspects of Jewish-Christian- Muslim relations, and draw significantly on Roth's earlier research, comprise the strongest sections of the book. These chapters generally are much better organized and argued than the preceding. Roth's discussion of slavery in chapter 5 and of the courts in chapter 6 is particularly detailed. In chapter 7, he provides ample evidence and good close analysis in his discussion of Jewish anti-Muslim arguments in materials, such as midrash, that are not strictly polemical. This provides a useful service to scholars. The discussion of Maimonides as polemicist is especially strong, although Roth tends to devote more space to him than to the equally important figures of Muslim anti-Jewish polemic, Ibn Hazm and al-Maghribi. The overemphasis of one</page><page sequence="3">168 BOOK REVIEWS figure is also characteristic of earlier sections of the book; for example, the extensive discussion of the Ibn Naghrillah family in chapter 3 results in too narrow a focus in a chapter which is meant to discuss, in general, the status of Jews under the Umayyad and Taifa kingdoms. The superior argument of these last three chapters is marred by the same lack of conclusions that was symptomatic of the previous chapters. Indeed, the entire book ends with no real conclusion and so leaves the reader with no ultimate sense of the author's thesis. Roth is deeply concerned to provide a corrective to opinions voiced by other scholars that he holds to be erroneous. And, upon occasion, he succeeds in presenting his case. However, his depiction of the views of his colleagues as "perverse" (p. 10), "nonsense" (ibid.), "worse than useless" (p. 69), and "worthless" (p. 266 n. 27) strikes this reviewer as unnecessary and unprofessional. Generally, Roth is most effective when he uses his research into source materials to find contradictory evidence. His critique is weakest when he simply argues that another interpretation does not make sense. Roth's most unfair attack is directed at Ross Brann's otherwise-acclaimed work, The Compunctious Poet, which he dismisses as "a generally worthless book further marred by repeated plagiarism of my own translations of poems, articles, etc." (p. 303 n. 51). As evidence, Roth cites his review in the Journal of Semitic Studies 37 (1992): 335-337. But nowhere in that review does Roth mention plagiarism, much less provide evidence for it. Such an unsubstantiated attack on a scholar's character is misleading and irresponsible. The question of evidence raises another, more mechanical, issue. Roth often presents his evidence in notes rather than in the text, and frequently these only provide references to other works. Therefore, finding the evidence is contingent upon finding the works cited. Roth would do his readers a great service by presenting the evidence itself either in the text or the notes. Similarly, the bibliographical information is split among several specialized literature surveys scattered throughout the book as well as a general bibliog- raphy at the end. Even this general list does not include all the works cited in the notes. Hence, the reader must hunt for full citation in several places, including, most inconveniently, the notes. Stylistically, the book suffers from frequent instances of awkward syntax, one-sentence or disjointed paragraphs, and a style which on occasion devolves into mere outline. Unfortunately, the editor must share some responsibility for these problems, as well as for a number of errors in the text and index. Generally, the book gives the impression of work hastily done. Although</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 169 there is material of value here, as a comprehensive treatment of the topic of Jews, Visigoths, and Muslims in medieval Spain, Roth's study falls short of its mark.
