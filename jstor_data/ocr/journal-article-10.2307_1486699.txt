<plain_text><page sequence="1">DYBBUK AND MAGGID: TWO CULTURAL PATTERNED OF ALTERED CONSCIOUSNESS IN JUDAISM by YORAM BILU Introduction For many years scholars of Judaism were reluctant to employ the analytic tools distilled in anthropology for studying Jewish culture. One reason for this reluctance was that the classical ethnographic field, consisting of a small-scale tribal society with no written tradition, did not appear pertinent to the study of the text-informed "great tradition" of Judaism. In addition, the notion of comparative research implicit in most anthropological studies appeared dubious to many scholars of Judaism, who were alarmed by the sweeping, methodologically unfounded comparisons evident in the treatment of biblical material by such precursors of modem anthropology as Robertson Smith and Frazer.' This methodological consideration was augmented by an emotional unwillingness to equate the "primitive" religious systems of "savage" societies with concepts and rituals pertaining to the oldest monotheistic religion.2 1.

In anthropology, the comparative melange of nineteenth-century evolutionists was refined by in-depth investigations in bounded cultural settings. Sorting out the similarities and differences between "others" and "us" remained the tacit agenda of most (though definitely not all) anthropological research, even when it focused, as it usually did, on one particular cultural environment. But this comparative venture has become more contextualized and defensible methodologically. In addition, the settings studied, which in the formative years of ethnographic fieldwork were limited to remote, preliterate societies, were gradually broadened to include civilizations boasting "great traditions," like Buddhism and Islam. The "text-context" division that separated anthropology from most hu- manistic disciplines, including Judaic studies, came to be blurred as leading anthropologists began to turn to these disciplines for inspiration and guiding models. While the emphasis on context remained the trademark of modem ethnography, the metaphor of culture as text gained prominence in the anthropology of the 1970s. The practice of subsuming the ethnographic enterprise under titles like "reading," "translating," "deciphering," and "in- terpreting" cultural "scripts," "narratives," and "dramas" lucidly conveys this textual-hermeneutic turn.3 The new paradigm contested the formerly dominant mechanistic and organismic metaphors in anthropology and made its discourse more congenial to scholars of Judaic studies. A similar lowering of disciplinary thresholds has been noted in Judaic studies in the growing readiness of scholars to move from text to context. One recent example is the attempt by scholars of Jewish mysticism to augment the dominant philological-historical research paradigm by analyzing the phenomenological and behavioral layers of mystical phenomena.4 The present essay seeks to contribute to this line of research by examining the mystical phenomena of dybbuk (dibbuq) and maggid through analytic lenses cultivated in psychological anthropology. 3.

On the collective level, they seek to discern consistent group differences and to account for their origins, but at the same time they are also interested in delineating the psychological and cultural universals that underlie these differences. This dual perspective, seeking to illuminate group differences against the backdrop of human universals, is characteristic of the present study. Without underestimating the Jewish-specific contents of the dybbuk and maggid phenomena, my aim is to ponder them in the wider comparative context of altered consciousness, as representing the two major categories employed cross-culturally to articulate trance experiences. Cultural Patterns ofAltered Consciousness Altered states of consciousness are a natural field of study for psychologi- cal anthropologists. Emerging from a panhuman psychophysiological matrix, they manifest themselves in a multitude of cultural forms and contexts. In contrast with the aura of psychopathology associated with them in the West,7 in most societies altered states of consciousness appear as socially 5. Philip K.

One explanatory type, designated "possession trance," attributes altered states of consciousness to possession by spirit entities, while the other, "nonpossession trance," views them as resulting from an encounter with the spirit. This encounter may occur by sending one's soul on a spirit voyage or by having the spirits come to visit.10 It is against this bifurcation of altered states of consciousness proposed by Bourguignon that I would like to evaluate the phenomena of dybbuk and maggid. But before detailing the features of these Jewish variants of altered consciousness, a closer look at possession trance and nonpossession trance is in order. It would be erroneous to view the two forms of trance merely as ex- planatory models imposing divergent theories of causation on a common core of experiences and behaviors. Rather, they are cultural idioms through which experiences are articulated and behaviors are constructed so as to form culturally divergent configurations." In this sense, the terms "possession trance" and "nonpossession trance" are somewhat unfortunate, as they imply a separation between native theory ("possession") and behavior ("trance"). In addition, a critique may be launched against the very attempt to subsume the dazzling diversity of altered states of consciousness under two general categories. While possession trance and nonpossession trance take note of intracultural interpretive systems of altered states of consciousness, they are also the end-product of a cross-cultural endeavor to distill regulari- ties and uniformities from highly contextualized, culturally heterogeneous phenomena.12 8.

Following the two-path scheme suggested by Bourguignon inevitably entails some oversimplification, given the malleability of trance phenomena and the possibility of hybrid forms. Therefore, in applying Bourguignon's categorization to the Jewish variants of altered consciousness, I would like to use it as a heuristic device in the context of a preliminary exploration. Even if trance experiences are not so categorical, I believe that the divergent nature of the Jewish phenomena under study can be better understood through the prism of the two-path model. It is important to note that both possession trance and nonpossession trance may be positively or negatively defined, in accord with the moral qualities ascribed to the spirit." "Positive" cases, steeped in ritual and religious symbolism, are willfully sought, as the encounter with the spirit is believed to contribute to the well-being of the trancer or of others in his environs. "Negative," spontaneously emerging forms of altered states of consciousness are often evaluated as an affliction, and in consequence strict measures are taken to disengage the tormented trancer from the spirit (e.g., exorcism). In some societies, where special cultural avenues are available for domesticating the engaging spirit, involuntary disruptive states may be transformed into ecstatic, divinatory, or other religiously based dissociative behavior. It should be noted also that the two cultural categories under discussion may not involve altered consciousness at all. Possession, for example, may be used to explain a plethora of human conditions, from chronic illness to artistic inspiration, which do not necessarily entail a discernible shift in consciousness. While possession trance and nonpossession trance can be found in the same society, as the case under discussion will show, they seem to be in a relationship of structural inversion.'4 Indeed, the contrasts between posses- sion trance and nonpossession trance in terms of geographical distribution, societal and ecological variables, morphology (continuity/discontinuity in consciousness), modes of interaction, gender, and symbolism seem to fashion them into sharply distinct types of experiences. Geographically, nonpossession trance has been predominant in North and South America, while possession trance is positively correlated with 13. I. M.

This differential distribution is associated with two other related variables. Possession trance is more typical of societies with higher levels of societal complexity (indicated, for example, by class stratification and jurisdictional hierarchy) and subsistence economy (food production through agriculture and animal husbandry), while nonpos- session trance is overrepresented in simpler and more egalitarian societies of hunters and gatherers. How should these correlations be accounted for? The positive association between possession trance and societal complexity seems to be mediated by social rigidity. In hierarchical, stratified societies, where social boundaries are rigidly delineated, possession trance provides socially deprived individuals, mostly women, with a golden opportunity to assume the spirit's identity and temporarily escape, under the spirit's auspices, the confines of their social roles.'" Following various cross-cultural studies,16 Bourguignon suggests that the association between hunting and gathering and nonpossession trance may be mediated by socialization pressures toward self-reliance, independence, and individual achievement typical of societies relying on this mode of subsistence. The particular ways in which the encounter with the spirit is pursued and realized, especially in the Native American guardian spirit complex, seem to directly reflect these culturally commended personality traits. At the same time, the acquisition of a lifelong spiritual ally may compensate for the stress arising in these societies from unsatisfied dependency longings in childhood. Men's predominance in the cultural patterns of nonpossession trance is congruent with the fact that most of the socialization pressures toward self-reliance are exerted on them. In the same vein, it was found that societies heavily dependent for their subsistence on hunting, gathering, and fishing, where pressures for independence are great, are more likely to use dreams to seek and control supernatural powers."7 Phenomenologically, dreams are quite akin to nonpossession trance states, as both are private, internal experiences with a strong hallucinatory component. 15.

These personal- ity attributes are more strongly emphasized in the socialization of girls. It is not surprising, then, that women are overrepresented in possession trance, where the relationship between the invading spirit and the possessed appears to be strongly informed by these attributes. In addition, the penetration of the spirit into the host's body and its temporary residence there, strongly resonant with female-specific modes of experience (female sexuality, pregnancy), make the possession idiom particularly conducive to the articulation of female concerns.'" As a form of encounter with the spirit, nonpossession trance essentially is an interaction based on visual and auditory experiences. In contrast, possession trance is a performance in which the trancer becomes the spirit. Typically, nonpossession trance is a private experience, and in order to become a communicable cultural resource it has to be remembered. Possession trance, as a performance carried out in front of an audience, can be culturally registered and socially employed without the recollection of the individual trancer. Accordingly, episodes of possession trance are typically followed by amnesia. Nonpossession trance is likely to be induced by fasting (which produces dissociation-facilitating hypoglycemia and dehydration), sensory deprivation, and mortification, while possession trance is generally induced by drumming, singing, dancing, and crowd contagion. In terms of Ludwig's typology of means of trance induction,19 it seems that nonpossession trance is associated with the reduction of sensory stimulation and motor activity, while possession trance generally involves the increase of sensory stimulation, motor activity, and emotional arousal. Since nonpossession trance is basically an intrapsychic experience, the trancer often appears physically passive. Yet his interaction with the spirit is replete with active imagery congruent with the fact that he achieves mastery without loosing his identity and individuality. In contrast, the physically active possession trancer remains psychologically passive, since, in the process of obtaining the gift of the spirit (in positive possession trance), her own self 18.

These opposite patterns appear to be linked with the sex-typed distribution of possession trance and nonpossession trance. Having discussed the major differences between possession trance and nonpossession trance,20 we turn now to the Jewish variants of the altered states of consciousness under discussion. Dybbuk and Maggid in Judaism The term dybbuk (dibbuq) was used in Jewish mystical circles to designate a spirit of a dead person, a notorious sinner in his lifetime, that took temporary possession of a human being, usually a female, by inhabiting her body.21 The spirit announced his presence inside the victim in various ways. After striking her down and committing her to violent convulsions, the spirit's strange voice could be heard from the mouth of the possessed. His lewd and immoral character was indicated by the forbidden acts of libidinal, aggressive, and religiously subversive behavior that the possessed was compelled to commit. Given this repugnant display, it is not surprising that dybbuk possession was always conceived as an affliction or an illness and the possessing agent as a foreign, dangerous intruder that had to be expelled. The uniquely Jewish, culture-bound nature of the dybbuk was prominently expressed in the public exorcistic ritual. The exorcist was always a revered rabbi who confronted the spirit with various religiously informed measures used in a fixed, graded order. Often the exorcism was performed in the synagogue and involved the active employment of Jewish sacred paraphernalia by the congregants. During the highly structured sequence of steps of the ritual, the spirit was compelled to identify himself, to confess his transgressions during his lifetime and disclose the heavenly penalty inflicted on him in retribution, to specify his conditions for departure, to give his consent to leave through a minor organ (usually one of the big toes), and then to depart for good.22 20. See Bourguignon, Psychological Anthropology, pp. 233-269. 21. Since with only a few exceptions, the spirits belonged to male sinners, I use masculine pronouns in discussing them. Feminine pronouns are used to describe the possessed, given the predominance of females in this group. 22. See Bilu, "Taming of the Deviants," pp. 16-20; Gedalyah Nigal, Dybbuk Tales in Jewish Literature (Jerusalem: Rubin Mass, 1983) (Heb.).</page><page sequence="9">DYBBUK AND MAGGID 349 Judging from the reported cases, successful expulsion of the spirit was the outcome of most exorcistic rituals. Documented cases of dybbuk possession appear in Jewish sources from the mid-sixteenth century to the first decades of the twentieth century. Only mystically oriented communities, first Sephardic (in the Mediterranean basin) and then also Ashkenazi (in Hasidic Eastern Europe), were exposed to the phenomenon, and this selective distribution attests to the strong mystical basis of the dybbuk phenomenon. The major kabbalistic doctrine underlying dybbuk possession was that of gilgul, or the transmigration of souls, which emerged in the twelfth century. In the late thirteenth century the doctrine of transmigration was expanded to include the entry of a spirit into a living person after he was born. This addition, designated ibbur ("impregnation"), paved the way for the appearance of dybbuk possession. Specifically, it contended that dybbukim were spirits of the wicked who, in retribution for their mortal sins, were doomed to remain in limbo, exposed to ruthless persecution, without even being allowed to enter hell, where their sins could be eventually repented. The inhabitation of humans gave these tormented spirits a temporary shelter as well as an opportunity (realized through the intercession of the exorcist) to gain access to the world of the dead.23 The disappearance of the dybbuk in the first half of the twentieth century was apparently related to the disintegration of the Jewish traditional centers in Europe and the Middle East due to modernization, emigration, and physical extermination. In Jewish mysticism the term maggid was used to indicate a celestial entity, usually an angel, who delivered mystical secrets to a kabbalist. Unlike the relative uniformity of dybbuk possession episodes, the ways in which maggidim revealed themselves to mystics were quite varied. Dreams constituted a fertile ground for maggidic visitations, but no less common were wakeful apparitions in which the kabbalist saw the heavenly messenger or heard his voice, or both. Automatic speech and, to a lesser degree, automatic writing were also means of maggidic revelation. The maggid phenomenon could be seen as one chapter in a long-lasting chain of prophetic revelations in Judaism which were related to diverse celestial powers, from Ru 'ah Ha-Qodesh and the heavenly voice (bat-qol) to Elijah the Prophet and the archangel Metatron.24 Historically, revelations of 23.

Subsequently, the term came to be used mainly as a designation for sermonists or preachers, particularly in Hasidic communities, a meaning of maggid that also dated back to the sixteenth century. In this essay, however, the nonrevelatory designation of maggid will not be discussed, even though it is unlikely that the two meanings of the term were entirely unrelated. The figure of the maggid as an angelic messenger was apparently crys- tallized in the first decades of the sixteenth century in the circle of kabbalists around Rabbi Joseph Taytazak in Salonica.25 From him maggidic revelations spread to Safed in the Galilee, which at that time was emerging as a world center of Jewish mysticism. Some of the most renowned mystics of the era, Rabbi Solomon Alkabets, Rabbi Moses Cordovero, and even Rabbi Isaac Luria Ashkenazi, the prominent founder of the Lurianic school of Kabbalah, are known to have had maggidim, but the nature of their revelations remains virtually unknown. The most famous maggid of sixteenth-century Safed, and perhaps of all times, was that of Rabbi Joseph Karo, one of the greatest figures of rabbinic Judaism and the author of Shulhan Arukh.26 A talmudist by day and a kabbalist by night, Karo left a diary, Maggid Mesharim, recording the messages from his heavenly mentor, who was none other than the Shekhina embodied in the anthropomorphized figure of the Mishnah. Aside from interpretations of the Torah and mystical secrets, these messages included personal communications which moved from agonizing chastisement and harsh demands for self-mortification to aggrandizing praises and promises of the greatest achievements. Throughout the first half of the seventeenth century, maggidim kept appearing to mystically oriented rabbis in Italy and Poland, but the number grew with the rise of the messianic movement of Sabbatai Sevi around 1665--66, and the exuberant hopes for redemption that he stirred. Many of the Sabbatean "prophets," including Nathan of Gaza, the prime mover of the 25. According to various sources from the seventeenth century, Sefer ha-Meshiv ("The Book of the Responding [Entity]"), a famous mystical compilation of maggidic revelations and the techniques to obtain them, was written by Taytazak.

Maggidim played an important role in Sabbatean groups after the death of Sabbatai Sevi. Among other things, they served to reconcile the shocked believers to their Messiah's conversion to Islam followed by his imprisonment and exile, and then to his premature death. A particularly busy period of maggidic activity occurred in the religious academy of Rabbi Avraham Revigo in Italy. Another Sabbatean circle where maggidic revelations were prominent was that of Avraham Kardozo in Turkey.27 The maggidic epoch was sealed in the first half of the eighteenth century with the mystical revelations of Rabbi Moses Hayyim Luzzatto in Padua, Italy. The secret Messianic group that formed around this brilliant kabbalist and writer received its inspiration from the revelations of Luzzatto's maggid. However, the social and religious climate in the post-Sabbatean era was very inauspicious for maggidim. Luzzatto's messianic fervor was viewed by many of his contemporaries as nurtured by heretical Sabbatean sources. He was persecuted and excommunicated by the rabbinical authorities and was forced to forsake his mystical studies, not to mention his involvement with his maggid.28 Since Luzzatto's time, the steady flow of prophetic revelations reported from Hasidic and other mystically oriented circles has not included apparitions of maggidim. Dybbuk and Maggid as Culturally Patterned Altered States of Consciousness The obvious contrasts between dybbuk and maggid only seem to accen- tuate their affinity and common template. They emerged---or more precisely, appeared in written sources--at the same time and in the same area: in the first half of the sixteenth century in the Sephardic communities of the Mediterranean basin. Moreover, the two phenomena peculiarly converged in the life histories of some prominent mystics of that era. Thus, Rabbi Joseph Karo, whose heavenly mentor was the most well known in the history of maggidim, was recently identified as the exorcist in the first documented 27.

It was Rabbi Jacob Emden, one of the fiercest opponents of the Sabbatean movement, who described a Sabbatean prophet, Zaddok of Grodno, as "an ignorant rude man .. who in all probability was possessed by some dybbuk from the foreign [demonic] beings, like all his deranged friends."32 Another Sabbatean prophet, Rabbi Leib Prossnitz, who claimed to have enlisted Sabbatai Sevi and Rabbi Isaac Luria as his maggidim, was compelled to admit, after having been interrogated by the rabbinical authorities, that the source of his prophecies was none other than a dybbuk in the guise of dog.33 Thus, it appears that at a time of dispute, the boundaries between these seemingly contrasting phenomena could become blurred. Maggidic revelations and prophecies, a source of highly cherished mystical secrets and spiritual insights for the believer, could easily be defamed by opponents and relabeled as negative possession by a demon or a dybbuk. Scholars of Jewish mysticism could not fail to notice the parallelism between dybbuk and maggid. Scholem, who was not fond of psychological analysis of mystical phenomena, nevertheless stated that: From a psychological point of view, these maggidim were products of the unconscious level of the psyche, crystallizing on the conscious level of the kabbalists' minds into psychic entities. Maggidim, holy angels or the souls of departed saints, speaking either to the kabbalist or through his mouth ... often had their counterparts on the "other side" in the dibbuks, demons or evil souls 29.

Psychologically, the two phenomena have common roots.34 Idel has emphasized the historical concurrence of dybbuk and maggid as well as the "inverted affinity" between them."3 Some of the contrasts he highlighted will be discussed below. As stated before, I would like to make this inverted affinity meaningful by anchoring dybbuk and maggid in Bourguignon's worldwide typification of culturally patterned altered states of consciousness. The textual evidence indicating that these two phenomena indeed involved dissociation is ample. The reports on dybbuk possession and exorcism leave little doubt as to the profound shifts in consciousness that the possessed underwent once the spirit invaded her body. No less abrupt and dramatic was the return to normal consciousness upon the exit of the spirit. Where detailed reports of maggidic apparitions exist, behavioral and phenomenal manifestations of trance or dissociation can be easily recognized during the revelatory period. Yet there is room to assume that not all the cases subsumed under dybbuk and maggid can be defined as altered states of consciousness. In linking the two phenomena to Bourguignon's bifurcation, the asso- ciation of the dybbuk with possession trance appears self-evident on all relevant dimensions. The very essence of the dybbuk phenomenon was grounded in the idiom of possession, with the mystical doctrines of gilgul and ibbur as "natural models" for shaping the behavior of the possessed in a taken-for-granted manner. As a negative possession forced on the victim and deemed an affliction or an illness, it did not include religious rituals for summoning the spirits, so central in positive possession. Rituals came to the fore in the exorcistic phase, which was designed to put an end to the possession episode. As in other cultural forms of possession trance, the spirit took absolute control of the victim by temporarily obliterating her individual identity. In most of the cases the dissociative episode was followed by amnesia, and as a result the reports on the cases were never provided by the victims themselves. The public character of dybbuk possession, particularly salient in the dramatic exorcistic ritual, provided many eye-witnesses to document the cases. 34. Scholem, Sabbatai Sevi, p. 82.

One of the distinctive features of the male possessed was their significantly younger age. In fact, most of the possessed males were children and adolescents. Like other possession trance cases, dybbuk possession exhibited an inherent tension between active performance, replete with hypermotor and aggressive behaviors, and passive imagery emerging from the absolute loss of individuality and control vis- A-vis the spirit. Since dybbuk possession has never been transformed into a positive, willfully sought state, it altogether lacked induction rituals. Yet the spontaneously emerging factors underlying the possession attacks can be identified as emotional intensification or arousal. In terms of Ludwig's classification of induction techniques,36 these factors clearly belong to the category of stimulation increase, so typical of possession trance states. Whereas dybbuk possession appears as a clear-cut case of possession trance, the position of the maggid as an altered state of consciousness is more complicated and requires a thorough examination. Scholars of Jewish mysticism, while emphasizing the aforementioned inverted affinity between dybbuk and maggid, tended to place the contrasts between them within the domain of possession by designating the maggid as positive possession." In what follows, I propose a critical examination of this view by evaluating var- ious characteristics of maggidic revelation against Bourguignon's dichotomy of socially patterned altered states of consciousness. A strong support for viewing maggidic revelations as positive possession comes from the main mystical accounts of these phenomena. A pertinent example is the doctrine of prophetic revelation developed by Rabbi Moses Cordovero, one of the mystical luminaries of sixteenth-century Safed. For the holy spirit can rest upon man ... and this was the case with all prophets ... and the opposite is the case of Saul, where "an evil spirit troubled him." Similarly man can be entered by another soul-a holy or an evil one-and similarly we have seen demons or evil spirits entering men and troubling them. ... Similarly an angel may enter man and speak within him words of wisdom, and this is what is generally called maggid.38 36. Ludwig, "Altered States of Consciousness," pp. 12-14. 37.

It is interesting that even when he deals with the mystical revelations of Elijah the Prophet (gilluy Eliahu), which he described as an internally generated insight or illumination, Cordovero still sticks to an intellectual-abstract version of possession, apparently without trance at all: "Elijah entering the intellect of man and teaching him hidden things.""39 It seems that Cordovero was totally engulfed in the possession idiom, which he employed to account for a wide spectrum of prophetic revelations. It should be emphasized, however, that Cordovero presented a theory, or conceptual scheme, that was designed to account for empirical facts (prophetic revelations) but was not identical with them. True, the articulatory power of explanatory models like Cordovero's may have a significant bearing on the behavioral level. But in this case it is not at all clear whether Cordovero's esoteric doctrine stemmed from a widespread folk-model of maggidism or subsequently become one. At any rate, other doctrinal accounts of maggidim held by noted kabbalists were not necessarily linked to possession as the guiding idiom. Thus the maggidic theory of Rabbi Hayyim Vital, Luria's great disciple and the promulgator of his teachings, asserts that the study of the Law and dutiful performance of the commandments by the mystic bring about the creation of an angel who reveals himself to his creator and discloses mystical secrets to him. Vital's formulation leaves it entirely open whether we are dealing here with a nonpossession trance experience (i.e., a bounded encounter with the angel) or with a possession trance.40 If we move from the doctrinal-theoretical level to the phenomenological-behavioral one, the strongest support for defining the maggid as a case of positive possession is automatic speech, one of the most common paths of maggidic revelation. Many references in Maggid Mesharim, Karo's mystical diary, attest to the fact that his maggid revealed himself through automatic speech (e.g., "Behold the voice of my beloved knocketh in my mouth and the lyre sounded of itself').41 Alkabets, in his famous epistle, testified that "we heard the voice speaking in the mouth of the virtuous."42 Automatic speech was quite common among the Sabbatean prophets. One of them, Joseph Ben-Sur of Meknes in Morocco, 39. Ibid., p. 81. 40. Ibid., p. 79. 41. Ibid., p. 260. 42. Ibid., p. 21.</page><page sequence="16">356 YORAM BILU reported in amazement that "I do not know who speaks with me, and I neither see nor speak but my lips are speaking and I hear the voice that proceeds from them."43 The importance and central place of automatic speech in prophetic revelations was manifested in various religious commentaries in which it was argued that Moses and the other prophets used this method to communicate with heavenly forces.44 Some kabbalists left us vivid descriptions of the experience of automatic speech. Consider, for example, the excitement of the author of Sha 'arey Sedeq ("The Gates of Justice"), a mystical text of the thirteenth century, after he had experienced automatic speech: "And then, some utterances came out from my heart and reached my lips, forcing them to move. And I was worried lest this was a senseless spirit, but then I found out that the talk was sagacious. And I came to the conclusion that this was a wise-hearted spirit."45 Again, this self-testimony apparently constitutes strong evidence for the presence of the speaking force within the body of the mystic. It seems that the author's personal notion of automatic speech is consistent with Cordovero's maggid-as-possession theory. A similar notion appears in the doctrine of prophetic revelation of Nathan of Gaza, the prominent Sabbatean prophet and Sabbatai Sevi's harbinger: "And then he [the prophet] sees the speech [sic] of the prophecy in the form of letters protruding in front of him. ... after that, an angel is created [from these letters] and inhabits the body of the man who sees this vision. And [the angel] utters through his [the prophet's] mouth the letters that he had seen above him."46 Note that in this passage the phenomenology of prophecy and its inter- pretation are confounded. The prophetic sequence, according to Nathan of Gaza, begins with a visual message, more typical of nonpossession trance than of possession trance, and ends with automatic speech. The mediating link between these two sets of experience is a theory of possession. I believe that this separation between theory and subjective reality reflects an epistemological gap which is crucial for understanding the nature of the maggid as an altered state of consciousness. Before further elaborating on this 43. Scholem, Sabbatai Sevi, p. 897. 44. Idel, "Inquiries," pp. 220-221. 45. Ibid., p. 221. 46. Scholem, Sabbatai Sevi, p. 206. Seeing the speech is not a case of synesthesia (fusion of sense modalities). The prophet is imagined to see in a three-dimensional form the letters from which the words of the prophecy are composed.</page><page sequence="17">DYBBUK AND MAGGID 357 gap (but in line with the argument that unfolds presently), it should be noted that Rabbi Hayyim Vital contends in his Sha 'ar ha-Gilgulim ("The Gate of Transmigrations") that the spiritual voice of the Divine cannot be heard by the prophet because it lacks material dimensions. Hence, to be communicated it must be embodied in the corporeal voice of the prophet.47 Does the embodiment of the spiritual voice in the human voice of the prophet imply a possession trance state? The phenomenology of automatic speech, so lucidly demonstrated in the above-cited passage from Sha 'arey Sedeq, leads me to a negative answer. The reflexive awareness expressed here indicates that the individual identity of the kabbalist was far from abolished in the course of automatic speech. In many of the reports, the trancer's ability to be attentive to the utterances that his own lips generated and to process them correctly was taken for granted. Furthermore, the state of automatism did not involve dissociation strong enough to obliterate the recollection of the messages thus delivered, as many mystics were able to remember them long afterwards. Karo's ability to remember the messages that the maggid delivered to him on Friday night, the preferred time for revelations, was particularly impressive, since he could write them down only many hours later, after the holy Sabbath had ended. Thus, although maggidic revelations often involved automatic speech-after all, this was the only way to hear the spiritual message of the Divine according to influential kabbalists like Vital-and although the phenomenon of automatic speech was often explained in terms of possession, the boundaries between the trancer and his divine mentor were not dissolved. The association with the maggid generally took the form of an encounter in which the human and spiritual participants appeared as distinct entities. Karo's maggid demonstrated this point by stating, "I am talking to you as a man (would talk) to his friend."48 If we add to this dimension of clearly demarcated interaction during revelation the persistence of the cognitive attributes of reflexivity, attention, and memory, it seems that we cannot escape the conclusion that phenomenologically the maggid is closer to nonpossession trance than to possession trance. The association of the maggid with nonpossession trance gains further support when we examine other forms of maggidic revelation. Dreaming, a state of altered consciousness sharing many affinities with nonpossession 47. Werblowsky, Joseph Karo, pp. 78-79. 48. Ibid., p. 258.</page><page sequence="18">358 YORAM BILU trance, constituted a fertile matrix for germinating maggidim. In fact, the context in which the term maggid first emerged was that of she 'elat halom (dream query), a magical technique for inducing dream revelations.49 The wide variety of dream revelations led Werblowsky to argue that "all known forms and kinds of mystical experience could be doubled on the dream level."50 Indeed, the phrase "dreaming or awake" appears in many descriptions of maggidic revelation. That the dream precedes the waking state in this phrase is indicative of its perception as the "natural" setting for apparitions. In the mystical text Sefer ha-Meshiv mentioned above, the dream's primacy is stated quite explicitly: "[one can ask questions] first many times in the dream, then later in waking state."5' It is possible that maggidic apparitions in dreams are underrepresented in the texts because the dreaming and waking states are so often confounded in mystical experiences, particularly if the dream apparition underwent massive revision after the dreamer awakened. The fact that many maggidic visitations occurred at night lends support to this conjecture. In addition, many revelations took place in twilight states, just before falling asleep (hypnagogic states) or, more frequently, immediately after waking up (hypnopompic states). The first visitation of the maggid of Rabbi Moses Hayyim Luzzatto belonged to the second type: "And as I woke up, I heard a voice speaking." In another passage he stated that "I do all these things (incantations for summoning the maggid) when I fall down and I see all of the holy souls as if I am dreaming."52 The Sabbatean prophet Joseph Ben-Sur was frequented by his maggid in a twilight state, when he was "neither dreaming nor awake."53 He reported a clear-cut dissociative state ("all my senses are in abeyance, and I do not know whether I am in Heaven or on earth") of a hypnopompic nature ("and he wants to open his eyes and he cannot, as if they are covered with lead").54 As a private hallucinatory experience, the dream is akin to nonpossession trance. Indeed, the two tracks of visual and auditory sense modalities that were dominant in visitational dreams prevailed in waking revelations as well. The only difference is that the auditory mode, inferior to the visual mode in dream revelations, was more dominant in wakefulness. The double track of 49. Idel, "Inquiries," p. 222. 50.

The revelation here entailed a conjurer who was able to see the summoned angel, and a naive scribe who was called upon to write down the maggid's spoken communication but could not see him.60 Whether or not the voice that the scribe was supposed to hear was in fact the conjurer's (in the form of automatic speech) is left an open question. The auditory sense modality was salient in the maggidic revelations of Luzzatto, who, like Karo, could not see his heavenly mentor. However, Luzzatto's mystical experience apparently was not automatic speech, even though he explicitly stated that "I could hear his voice speaking in my mouth."''61 Based on the report of one of Luzzatto's students ("This angel speaks out of his mouth, though we, his disciples, do not hear anything"), Werblowsky cogently concludes that his was a case of endophasia (inner speech).62 A strong emphasis on the visual mode was typical of Kardozo's maggidic revelations. To a modem reader, his techniques appear to have been based on massive hypnotic suggestions (almost tantamount to guided imagery) designed to bring his disciples to see the maggidim. But in his mystical 55. Idel, "Inquiries," p. 189. 56. Ibid. 57. Ibid., p. 190. 58. Ibid. 59. Some mystical techniques for inducing prophecy included an elaborate multisensory system encompassing visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, and gustatory sensations.

Werblowsky, Joseph Karo, p. 23.</page><page sequence="20">360 YORAM BILU circle the latter could also be heard. To conclude, the sensory-perceptual ("hallucinatory") dimension, so prominent in maggidic revelation both in dreams and in wakefulness, once again situates the maggid in the category of nonpossession trance. A different kind of revelation, regarded by most mystics as superior to maggidism, was the revelation of Elijah (gilluy Eliahu). As mentioned before, some mystics believed that Elijah could impinge himself on the intellectual faculties of a sage and create an experience felt as an abrupt insight or inspiration. But the typical way in which he disclosed himself was in his figure, either in a dreams or in a waking state. The ideal revelation of Elijah, as depicted in Karo's Maggid Mesharim and in Sefer ha-Meshiv, was a private encounter, based on a clearly demarcated interaction, in which Elijah would reveal himself to the mystic and talk to him "mouth to mouth." Cordovero argued that before his earthly visitations Elijah incarnated in his material body and appeared to his mortal companion "in his body and soul."63 This notion, which highlights the nature of Elijah as a distinct "embodied" entity during apparitions, makes him, in fact, incapable of taking possession of humans. Like maggidic revelations, then, gilluy Eliahu appears to be firmly linked with nonpossession trance. Let us explore now the induction techniques for summoning maggidim. While these techniques were less rich and elaborate than those employed by mystics involved in ecstatic Kabbalah, like the thirteenth-century Spanish kabbalist Rabbi Avraham Abulafia and his circle,64 they were based on structured methods which had to be meticulously followed. These methods included the ceremonial recitation of appropriate scriptural verses, passages from the Mishnah, or Divine Names (yihudim). Sometimes specific incanta- tions were employed to summon the angel during sleep ("dream query") or in wakefulness.65 The serious preparations required for conjuring the maggid are evident in the case of Luzzatto, who "was compelled to prepare himself for three days ... by taking ritual baths and other things designed to appease the maggidic angel who was speaking to him."66 Beyond these techniques, seclusion, penance, and abstinence were also used to establish an auspicious background for summoning maggidim. The 63. Ibid., p. 270. 64. Idel, Abraham Abulafia, pp. 15-42. 65. Idel, "Inquiries," pp. 201-218. 66.

From Alkabets's epistle, it comes out that the dramatic revelations of the maggid of Karo during the vigil of Shavuot occurred in the context of two sleepless nights. Karo's maggid pursued the notion of asceticism to the extreme. He pushed Karo to ever-increasing self-inflicted suffering and castigated him harshly for the tiniest deviation from his Spartan demands. The ultimate reward he promised Karo for maintaining this penitential discipline was martyrdom on the stake ("I shall make thee worthy to be publicly burned in Palestine, to sanctify my name in public"), following the exemplary model of the messianic martyr Solomon Molkho, who was burned in Mantua in 1532.67 Against this ascetic lifestyle, Werblowsky's psychodynamic reading of the maggid as the product of Karo's demanding superego appears well-taken.68 The ascetic preparations for summoning maggidim may be psychologi- cally interpreted, then, as stemming from the unconscious need to appease tormenting internalized objects crystallized in a harsh superego. From the native mystical perspective, these activities were considered to be suitable means of purifying the soul before meeting with divine forces. The perspective espoused in this essay puts the main emphasis on yet another level of analysis, spanning the psychophysiological and the psychocultural: the preparatory in- ductions may have created physical and psychological conditions conducive to entering a culturally fashioned state of altered consciousness. It should be noted that even the apparition of Elijah, which according to Werblowsky "was not amenable to any mystico-magical coercion,"''69 was in fact facilitated by lengthy fasts. Karo's ascetically oriented maggid, who urged him to fast seven times for three consecutive days each, in order to see Elijah, only echoed an old tradition going back to the talmudic era.70 While the techniques for summoning maggidim were varied, most of them belong to the cluster of induction means based on the reduction of stimulation and motor activity. The abstinence and seclusion, together with the engrossment in nightly prayers and incantations, were likely to increase sensory deprivation. In addition, the lengthy fasts may have produced hypoglycemia and dehydration conducive to an altered state of consciousness. 67. Werblowsky, Joseph Karo, p. 98. 68. Ibid., p. 285. 69.

Possession trance, as mentioned above, is more likely to be induced by stimulation increase, either external or internal. Positive Possession Trance in Judaism If maggidic revelations are not instances of positive possession trance, as has been commonly assumed, where in Jewish mystical circles can we find positively evaluated manifestations of this type of dissociation? After review- ing many historical cases of prophetic revelation in Judaism, I would like to suggest that the group and individual revelations of entranced Sabbatean prophets bore significant resemblances to the behavioral manifestations of possession trance. The messianic fervor of 1666, the year of redemption according to Sabbatai Sevi, gave birth to a mass movement of prophets that encompassed men and women, children and adults. The ecstatic trance into which these prophets entered started with a comatose state and continued with violent convulsions, excessive foaming, and loud utterances of mystical formulae. It is important to note that these states were followed by amnesia: "Thereafter they would rise without remembering what they had done or said."7' This type of collective prophecy appears akin to dybbuk possession in terms of both the population involved (which included women, children, and the ignorant) and the behaviors exhibited (coma, convulsions, foaming, amnesia). As in the case of dybbukim, here too epilepsy ("falling sickness") was used as a common frame of reference. It is hard to determine the extent of female participation in Sabbatean prophecy, but in any case the strongly felt presence of women stood in sharp contrast to the near-absence of females with maggidim.72 The individual prophetic performances of Sabbatean mystics were also quite similar to possession trance. In the prophecies of Nathan of Gaza, for example, hypermotor excitation was part of the induction to the trance state. In one of the reports he is described as wobbling and dancing wildly 71. Scholem, Sabbatai Sevi, p. 420. 72. I have been able to locate only one case of a woman who had maggidic revelations. This woman, La Francesa, lived in Safed at the beginning of the seventeenth century, and amazed the town's sages by her ability to foretell the future. H. Z. Hirschberg, "The Author of Divrey Yosef and His Attitude Toward the Duty of Settling in Eretz Israel," in Sefer Shazar (Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society, 1971), pp. 132-137 (Heb.).</page><page sequence="23">DYBBUK AND MAGGID 363 in the room while taking his clothes off. Following a particularly frenetic movement, he collapsed into a comatose state so deep that a physician was called for and announced his death. Only then, to the surprise of all attendant, was his voice heard from underneath the sheet that covered him, uttering praises of Sabbatai Sevi.73 Another Sabbatean prophet, Rabbi Moses Suriel, entered a trance in a stimulus-loaded setting. And they [adherents of the Sabbatean movement] were sitting with him and singing songs of praises for Sabbatai Sevi, and they were playing the harp and other musical instruments. And in the midst of all that, Rabbi Moses would start dancing like a young man, and in the middle of the dance he would fall down as if he had contracted, heaven forbid, the falling sickness. After some agitation he would commence talking. And they put a handkerchief on his face ... and he would disclose secrets. ... And two scribes were sitting at his side, quickly writing down every utterance he made.74 Again, Rabbi Moses Suriel's prophetic behavior corresponds to the behavioral configuration of possession. The mobilization of the two scribes to write down his revelations at the moment they were uttered may be taken as an indication that Suriel was unable to recall them. Even though the association of Sabbatean ecstatic prophecy with posses- sion trance strikes me as quite sound, two reservations are appropriate here. First, this association is solely based on behavioral and phenomenological criteria. We do not know whether Sabbatean doctrine had any notion of prophecy-as-possession. In any case, note that my analysis of maggidim as nonpossession trance is based in part on the existence of some discrepancy or incongruence between native theory and behavior. Second, some of the literature on Sabbateanism was written by anti- Sabbatean rabbis after the fall of the false Messiah. In these sources the explanation for the salvo of prophecies in 1666 is often presented in terms of possession by evil spirits or demons. Interestingly one of these opponents, Rabbi Jacob Sasportas, suggested three possible ways of accounting for these prophecies-psychological ("their lust and desire aroused their imagination 73. Scholem, Sabbatai Sevi, p. 423. 74. Leib Ben Ozer, The Story of Sabbatai Sevi (Jerusalem: Zalman Shazar Center, 1978), pp. 59-60 (Heb.).</page><page sequence="24">364 YORAM BILU until they beheld visions"), medical ("falling sickness"), and demonologi- cal ("possibly the spirit also rested upon them accidentally, speaking and announcing various things, as does one who is possessed by a demon").7 Summary and Conclusions Dybbuk and maggid were portrayed as representing two contrasting paths of culturally shaped altered states of consciousness similar to the universal division of possession trance and nonpossession trance suggested by Bourguignon. Even though some mystical accounts of maggidim were based on the possession idiom, and even though the phenomenon of automatic speech apparently lends support to this association, most of the experiential attributes of maggidism were akin to nonpossession trance. If one looks for positive possession trance in Jewish mysticism, the ecstatic individual and collective prophecies prevalent in the Sabbatean movement offer an appropriate example. Let us summarize the differences between dybbuk and maggid. The dybbuk was a negative and involuntary possession phenomenon in which an evil spirit imposed himself on the victim, usually a woman or a child, and was eventually expelled after a public and dramatic exorcistic ritual. During the possession episode, the altered consciousness was clearly manifested in the realization of the identity of the invading spirit to the exclusion of the victim's self-identity. The episode was apparently precipitated by a strong emotional arousal and was followed by total or partial amnesia. The maggid was a positive and willfully sought encounter with an angel or another spiritual aide experienced mostly by male mystics. The maggid was summoned by various ritual inductions characterized by sensory deprivation and self-mortification, and his presence was experienced as an interaction based on visual or auditory sense modalities or both. The experience was typically private and "internal," and therefore had to be remembered. Since the association with the maggid was desirable, unlike the compelled presence of the dybbuk, we find summoning rituals in the instance of the former, as opposed to exorcistic rituals for the latter. The contrasts between the two Jewish variants of altered states of con- sciousness highlight the different social positions and cultural evaluations of the typical trancers in the two paths of altered consciousness-a mystically 75. Quoted in Scholem, Sabbatai Sevi, p. 423.</page><page sequence="25">DYBBUK AND MAGGID 365 oriented rabbi or sage on the one hand, an ignorant woman or a young lad on the other. The fact that the principal cultural option open to women in trance, unequivocally negative, was conceived as an illness is a gloomy reminder of female inferiority in Jewish traditional society. Note that in Judaism negative possession did not undergo a transformation into the ceremonial context of a possession cult, wherein possession is not stigmatized but socially approved.76 In Lewis's terms,77 the dybbuk spirits were amoral, and the peripherality of their carriers was objectified by the possession idiom. Moreover, dybbuk possession left the victim as a passive object, temporarily bereft of self-awareness and without self-control vis-a-vis two external authorities: the possessing spirit who deprived the possessed of her individual identity and the rabbi-exorcist who compelled the spirit to leave. In the maggidic experience the trancer maintained his identity, reflexivity, and individuality. Even if we espouse the possession theory of Cordovero and accept that the angel inhabited the mystic when he spoke through his mouth, we must concede that he did not eliminate his soul as in the dybbuk. From a psychological viewpoint, it might be argued that the extreme passivity of the possessed in dybbuk cases was nothing but a convenient guise for rebellious acting out, amply manifested in the aggressive, sexual, and grotesque behavior of the spirits. But this subversive aspect was confronted and effectively eliminated by the exorcistic ritual. In a dramatic series of movements, the spirits were overpowered by the exorcists, confessed their sins, and vividly reported the persecutions that were their lot in the afterlife. In doing all this, the rebellious spirits were transformed into conservative agents of the social order, promoting conformity and religious observance. Paradoxically it was the positively evaluated maggid that had the potential to become truly subversive, as the revelations initiated by him could facilitate mystical innovations and stir messianic expectations. The recognition of this subversive potential sometimes led rabbinic authorities to stigmatize such revelations and excommunicate the mystics who were involved with them, particularly in the post-Sabbatean era (e.g., Luzzatto). Finally, after discussing the points of similarity between maggid and nonpossession trance and between dybbuk and possession trance, I would like to risk a speculation regarding the ecological variable that differentiated the 76.

Lewis, Ecstatic Religion, p. 127.</page><page sequence="26">366 YORAM BILU two types of altered states of consciousness-hunting and gathering societies (associated with nonpossession trance) and agricultural societies (associated with possession trance). Needless to say, this distinction does not apply to traditional Jewish society. Yet it is worth asking whether the socialization pressures toward compliance, obedience, and conformity that were evident in agricultural societies were not also the fate of the Jewish female victims of dybbukim? And in this vein, is it not possible to metaphorically ponder the Jewish mystics as hunters, relentlessly propelled by the adventurous drive to find their own path to the Divine and to stalk mystical secrets? In this independent pursuit of esoteric knowledge, the maggid served as a kind of a guardian spirit or a spiritual ally, a chaperon and guide in the dangerous orchard of mystical enigmas, who helped to dispel doubt and insecurity among the kabbalists and suffused them with assurance in their calling.
