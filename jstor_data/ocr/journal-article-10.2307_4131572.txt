Jerusalem: Ben Zvi Institute for the Study of Jewish Communities in the East, 1999. xvii, 174 pp. (Hebrew). Stroumsa publishes the medieval Hebrew version of Ibn Shim'on's Silencing Epistle Concerning the Resurrection of the Dead alongside the epistle in the orig- inal Judeo-Arabic, a fine modern Hebrew translation of the latter, and profuse an- 141</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review notations to both versions. Both text and translation are published for the first time. The translation is highly readable and the author's notes very instructive. The work is a major contribution to our understanding of the intellectual climate and fervor of the Near Eastern Jewish world of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. This review takes issue with Stroumsa's assertion that Ibn Shim'on's Epistle "clarifies some hitherto obscure issues concerning the Maimonidean debate, and throws new light on it" (p. xii). Stroumsa is referring to the controversy sur- rounding Maimonides' Treatise on Resurrection; the putatively uncharacteristic na- ture of Maimonides' Treatise led a number of modem scholars to question his au- thorship (see her note 29 in the introduction for a full citation). Stroumsa argues that the Epistle "conclusively disprove[s]" (p. xiii) the forgery of Maimonides' Treatise on Resurrection by demonstrating that the Trea- tise is responding directly to his disciple's Epistle. I believe that the internal evidence, specifically the close correspondence with both Maimonides' theological views and his writing style, is a sufficient guar- antee of his authorship. The point under consideration, however, is whether Stroumsa's argument from external evidence is valid: I conclude that it is not. Some of Maimonides' followers, as indicated in his Treatise on Resurrection, had begun to deny bodily resurrection on the basis of inferences from his own work. Such conclusions were rebutted in correspondence with followers. The con- troversy, however, continued as charges of heresy spread. The prominent head of the Baghdad academy, referred to as the gaon, composed an essay sharply critical of Maimonides' views which demanded a response. It is at this point that Ibn Shim'on takes up the defense of his teacher, Maimonides. Ibn Shim'on's Epistle is both apologetic, in that he redefines some of Maimonides' words and concepts, and polemical, in that he attempts to counter the gaon 's arguments. Stroumsa spec- ulates that the epistle found its way to Maimonides and that it, rather than the gaon 's treatise itself, prompted Maimonides to respond in a lengthy and seemingly ram- bling essay, the aforementioned Treatise on Resurrection. Stroumsa posits that we can authenticate Maimonides' Treatise if we can demonstrate that it is responding directly to the Epistle of his highly esteemed dis- ciple (for whom he wrote the Guide of the Perplexed). She infers that Maimonides had in fact seen Ibn Shim'on's Epistle from a letter he sent Ibn Shim'on on the sub- ject of his dispute with the head of the Baghdad academy (Y. Shilat, "Iggerot ha- Rambam," Jerusalem, 1987). My reading of Stroumsa's reference (pp. 297-298 in the Judeo-Arabic version and pp. 309-310 in the Hebrew translation) does not in any way support this inference. There is absolutely no indication in the passage that Maimonides ever received his disciple's Epistle along with the gaon 's treatise: There is no mention of it, neither praise nor criticism. It is unlikely that Mai- monides would have passed up the opportunity to comment on his disciple's work if indeed he had received it. Interestingly, Stroumsa points to one instance where Ibn Shim'on displayed the same ignorance of philosophic principles ascribed to the gaon (comments to paragraph 8, pp. 128-129) and another instance where he clearly misread or misunderstood his mentor's writings (comments to paragraph 31, page 134). Yet Maimonides remains strangely silent. Moreover, Maimonides also fails to correct Ibn Shim'on's misapprehension-that the notion that resur- 142</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews rection is to occur in the messianic era can be inferred from a number of passages in the Mishneh Torah. The most plausible conclusion is that Maimonides never saw Ibn Shim'on's Epistle. Stroumsa supports her thesis that Maimonides was reacting to his disciple's Epistle, rather than directly to the gaon, with three pieces of evidence internal to the Treatise on Resurrection. The weakest internal evidence is the "bitter tone" found in Maimonides' words: "it discloses a certain disappointment with the close disciple, who having read the Guide, still remained, in a certain sense, perplexed" (pp. xii-xiv). There are, of course, a number of other explanations for this pre- sumed bitterness, as Stroumsa acknowledges (page xiv, note 36). Another suggestion-that Maimonides alludes to an expression found in the Epistle-is also unconvincing. In the Epistle, Ibn Shim'on quotes the gaon of the Baghdad academy responding to a question, "yes, indeed, there exists (some or someone) by us in Baghdad" (p. 108, par. 80; see comments on p. 147). In the Trea- tise, Maimonides mockingly refers to certain Arabic philosophical works com- posed "by them in Baghdad" (Shilat, p. 351). That Maimonides is alluding to the gaon 's expression is quite far-fetched. A third suggestion is that when Maimonides mentions that the gaon draws on the work of Avicenna, he is referring to the Epistle in which an almost exact paraphrase of Avicenna appears. Since we possess only fragments of the gaon 's treatise, this line of reasoning amounts to an argument from silence that the gaon did not refer to Avicenna elsewhere. More important, Maimonides states quite clearly that it is the gaon who drew from Avicenna's work, not Ibn Shim'on, while the Epistle makes it clear that Ibn Shim'on is the one who refers to Avicenna to re- but a claim made by the gaon (who had, he claims, self-servingly truncated a pas- sage from a philosophical work). There really is no reason to doubt Maimonides' explicit statement. In summary, the internal evidence that Stroumsa has gleaned does not sup- port the problematic inference from Maimonides' correspondence that he worked from his disciple's Silencing Epistle, which would by extension authenticate his own Treatise. While Stroumsa's contribution is extremely valuable, the Silencing Epistle by itself contributes nothing to resolving the age-old controversy regard- ing the authorship of the Treatise on Resurrection.
