Hanover and London: University Press of New England, 2002. xii, 232 pp. Baskin's book should be required reading, along with the works of Neusner, Boyarin, Wegner, Hauptman, Brooten, and Kraemer, for those interested in Jew- ish women in late antiquity.

Its limitations are a result of the char- acteristics of the rabbinic documents, notoriously difficult to use for a compre- hensive study on any topic; the vastness and variety of editorial styles of the rabbinic corpus virtually assure that one will both miss relevant data and confront an unmanageable variety of opinions on any given topic. Many have demonstrated that rabbinic Judaism is "male-centered." Baskin adroitly argues that this was the result of a deliberate decision by the rabbis, which led to the creation of women as "ancillary beings" (p. 1). She demonstrates that the rabbinic "insistence on female alterity and marginalization underlies and in- forms midrashic traditions concerning the 'second' sex" (p. 2). Baskin selected the midrashic and aggadic texts, terms she uses interchangeably, because in her view they "frequently preserve a more nuanced and complex view of women and their activities than the impersonal dictates of halakhic discourse" (p. 5), and they ap- pear to her as "more reflective of the complexities of actual human relationships as they are lived, while the halakhah appears to point toward an ideal, but not yet achieved, condition of order" (p. 7). In Chapter 1, Baskin collects and analyzes an array of passages that place women on the edges of rabbinic culture. She addresses works by Gruber, Neusner, and Boyarin that explain this phenomenon and juxtaposes them with the studies of Brooten and Kraemer. Baskin concludes that "in their desire to eliminate women from the sphere of communal authority, the rabbis were not simply sanctifying accepted traditions and norms of life but constructing a congenial reality of their own [based on] their vision of an ideal society, believed to conform to the divine will .. ." (p. 42). This conclusion underlies the rest of the study. Chapter 2, "Constructing Eve," maintains that within the covenantal rela- tionship between God and the People Israel, women and men are treated differ- ently. This disparity, Baskin argues, stems from the dissimilar ways in which God created Adam and Eve in Genesis 2. Chapter 3, "Eve's Curses," demonstrates that the "various disadvantages which were seen as part of the female condition ... were a consequence of women's inherent physical, emotional, and intellectual de- ficiencies" (p. 65). Among Baskin's more interesting insights is her argument that the three commandments given especially to women-niddah, hallah, and had- laqah-all center on separation (p. 73). While the rabbinic tradition does know some exceptionally talented and intelligent women-Beruriah and Yalta, for ex- ample-"rabbinic social policy required that even these extraordinary women be distanced from the actual exercise of such male prerogatives as communal study, public rituals, and worship, or the formation of the halakhah" (p. 87). In Chapter 4, "Fruitful Vines and Silent Partners," Baskin explores the rab- binic views of marriage, the woman's role as wife, and the placement of the female almost solely within the domestic sphere, "where they could provide for their hus- bands' needs and nurture children at the same time" (p. 89). Marriage is not a con- tract between equals (pp. 99-105), and rabbinic discussions of women's sexuality are primarily limited to ways of controlling it. Baskin demonstrates "a hermeneu- tics of suspicion informed all rabbinic ruminations on their other halves; the sup- posed sexual unreliability of women was never forgotten" (p. 118). Chapter 5 delves into the rabbinic discussions of the matriarchs, who were often barren for 353</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews a time, and these, in Baskin's words, "suggested that compassion and faith should prevail over dissolving a loving marriage" if there were no children (p. 119). How- ever, if individual women might be suspect at times, Chapter 6 explores the logi- cal conclusion that groups of women could pose a severe threat to males and their centrality within rabbinic culture. Baskin clearly illustrates the rabbinic image of woman as "other," as less per- fect/desirable than the male, and as a possible threat to the ideal world created by the male imagination. Her book accordingly contributes significantly to the cur- rent debate on Jewish women in late antiquity, a debate in which she actively par- ticipates. At the same time, while Baskin makes a good case for the importance of her view as the literature's prevalent picture, others will disagree. Determining the pervasiveness of the image she discerns throughout the entire rabbinic corpus is virtually impossible, especially as Baskin's study is itself limited to the non- halakhic sources. Even accepting the general accuracy of Baskin's approach, much remains to be done. The question of historical development is not asked here at all, and so we can't yet discern whether the rabbinic ideas changed over time, developed within a document, or the like. Similarly, while Baskin hints at differences between the attitudes in Babylonia and the land of Israel, she fails to use the geographical vari- ations as a starting point for further analysis. And, the question of the attitude of the halakhic corpus remains central. Still, even as these questions remain, we must appreciate what Baskin has provided us. The idea that the rabbinic culture is male-centered or that the rabbis treated women as "inferior, other, deficient, or whatever" is not new to anyone who has seriously dealt with the rabbinic corpus. However, what Baskin has done that no one else has done in English is to bring together a vast array of rabbinic passages which express and develop women's "otherness" and to argue persuasively that this resulted from the rabbis' conscious decision. Baskin has given us an excellent study of women in rabbinic Judaism and Jewish culture of late antiquity. Hers is a serious and well informed voice that must be engaged in any future conversation on this topic. Gary G. Porton University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Illinois</page></plain_text>
