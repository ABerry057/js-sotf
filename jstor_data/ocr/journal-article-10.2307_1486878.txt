<plain_text><page sequence="1">Idit Dobbs-Wettstein. Maimonides and St. Thomas on the Limits of Reason. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1995. x, 278 pp. Moses Maimonides (1135-1204) and Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) not only came from and indeed have since represented different religious com- munities, as Judaism and Christianity became over history, but also lived in quite different cultural worlds. We normally associate Aquinas with the thirteenth-century Aristotelian revival in Paris, while Maimonides was thoroughly assimilated into what Marshall Hogdson called "the Islamicate." So much so, indeed, that he could be classed among the practitioners of Islamic philosophy in a current anthology, for all of his reservations about much of it</page><page sequence="2">126 BOOK REVIEWS (shared by al-Ghazali, after all) and despite his being staunchly Jewish. Yet for all that, their distinctive goals of reconciling faith and reason coalesced on many a neuralgic point of medieval philosophical theology, as Aquinas was quick to acknowledge. This well-crafted study by Idit Dobbs-Wettstein, which traces its origins to the Pontifical Institute for Mediaeval Studies in Toronto, amply demonstrates how these two major medieval philosophical theologians illuminated each other, and can now serve to guide us in the crucial yet relatively uncharted area of comparative philosophical theology. In doing this, she offers a real assist to current thinkers attempting to respond to Karl Rahner's insistence (in his 1979 Weston lecture on "world-church") that Christianity now stands vis-iA-vis other global religions. Comparing the interpretations of Scripture of these two medieval thinkers, notably their respective commentaries on Job, exploring their intertwined treatments of creation, and their differing yet complementary exploration of human aspirations and the role of divine law in directing them, the author clearly and cogently summarizes their respective approaches in a form available to nonspecialist readers. As well, she advances the understanding of many who have studied one or another of them quite closely. Focusing on the "limits of reason" gives her a strategic way of showing how each of them cannily uses reason to delineate its own limitations in dealing with the One who is source-of-all, as well as to show the relative utility of the "parabolic" language of Scripture to speak of what must transcend straightforward philosophical assertion. Those more familiar with Aquinas will receive a reliable and thorough purview of Maimonides on these matters--no mean task, and also come to appreciate why Aquinas so often used him as a model for his inquiry. They will also discover a fresh Aquinas in the process-another signal achievement. Moreover, the author's concluding pages on their respective uses of Being and Good suggest a fruitful way of responding to some recent proposals on these matters by Jean-Luc Marion, a current French philosopher who has challenged some traditional readings. And her findings will not be without profit for political thinkers as well, so long as the role of practical reason in ordering the body politic remains a topic of debate. Finally, in the current climate of civilizational (or cultural) conflicts, this careful comparative study offers us a way of learning from the past to negotiate the present, by showing us how to retrieve a medieval tradition that was already interfaith, intercultural in perspective. It is perhaps this fruit of the study-one which transcends its careful analysis but clearly motivates it throughout-which recommends</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 127 it to comparative thinkers in any field. Idit Dobbs-Wettstein is scrupulously faithful to the text of each of her authors, and thoroughly cognizant of the relevant comparative studies published in Israel and France as well as in this country. Comparative assessment inevitably demands judicious reading which engages both writer and reader in a task of understanding. That the author is able to carry this off, again and again, in her inquiry testifies to the merit of the study. It proves in the end to be as rewarding as it is demanding. David B. Burrell University of Notre Dame Notre Dame, Ind. Yochanan Silman. Philosopher and Prophet: Judah Halevi, the "Kuzari, and the Evolution of His Thought. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1995. x, 370 pp. Yochanan Silman presents Judah Halevi's Kuzari "as an autobiographical work in which Halevi described the evolution of his thought, marked by vacillation and contradictions, which are expounded in the course of the dialogue that ties the book together" (p. viii). The Kuzari thus recapitulates, indeed in the very order in which speakers and positions are presented, Halevi's intellectual autobiography, and for Silman this journey proceeds through three distinct stages. The first and earliest of these is (strictly) philosophical, represented by the Aristotelian philosopher and his positions in the Kuzari, about which, according to Silman, "[Halevi] had reservations by the time he wrote the book" (p. 11). The second stage in Halevi's intellectual development is exemplified by his critique of Karaism. Here Halevi is committed to the essential harmony of Judaism and Aristotelian philosophy (p. 162), but the (rabbinic) critique of Karaism has the effect of slowly but surely calling into question that very harmonization of Judaism and philosophy. According to Silman, this second, intermediate stage in Halevi's intellectual development is presented in Kuzari III, 1.68-79, and II. 1-7. In agreement with D. H. Baneth, Silman views part III and the anti-Karaite critique as constituting the first edition of the Kuzari, the earliest stratum of what in time became the final text of the work we now have. (We should note that what emerges even at this point in Silman's schema is that the "autobiographicality" of the Kuzari, with its artful ordering of speakers and their respective positions, is out of sync with the actual order, the history, of its composition; that is, the [purported]</page></plain_text>
