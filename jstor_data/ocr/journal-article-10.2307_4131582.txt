In the past three decades several scholarly books were written about Mo- roccan Jewry highlighting the impact of modernization during the nineteenth cen- tury until the inauguration of the colonial era. These studies concentrate on mod- em secular education propagated by the Alliance Israelite Universelle (AIU 165</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review hereafter), the Anglo-Jewish Association, European consular schools, and the Al- liance Frangaise. They focus on French and other European acculturation, Muslim- Jewish relations, and social stratification.1 Most of these books mention briefly the oeuvre of the Franciscan Catholic and British or American Protestant missions. Few delve into the activities, agenda, and caliber of activists who managed their affairs,2 dismissing these as marginal in the overall daily picture of Jewish communal life. Eliezer Bashan's monograph on the Anglican Mission is the first attempt to lend some significance to the programs of its envoys among Moroccan Jews. It shows how in addition to their policies aiming at religious conversions, the mis- sionaries emerged as agents of modernization. While missionary activities attrib- uted to Catholics and Protestants were evident in parts of precolonial Morocco as far back as the early nineteenth century, important inroads became noticeable only since the 1870s. It was in 1875-1900 that schools, clinics, adult education, dis- semination of the New Testament, and communal work became essential features of missionary zeal. Only in the wake of the AIU's expansion, as well as subsequent initiatives of European Jewry to improve social conditions in the Moroccan com- munities, did the missionaries' efforts gradually come to nought. As Bashan demonstrates, the leading Protestant missions active in the Mo- roccan communities included the British and Foreign Bible Society, North African Mission, Southern Morocco Mission of Scotland, Mildway Mission to the Jew, Presbyterian Church of England, and London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews. Whereas the Anglican trend among the Protestant missions emerged as the dominant one, the Methodists and Presbyterians, too, enjoyed some measure of influence. The main bases of operations and the places where the pres- ence of the missionaries could be felt were the major cities of Essaouira, Rabat, and Casablanca on the Atlantic coast, Tangier near the Straits of Gibraltar, and in- land communities of Fez, Meknes, Sefrou, and Marrakesh. The London Society for the Promoting of Christianity amongst the Jews, with its headquarters in Es- saouira, is the focal point of Bashan's study. He is also highly informative about one of this Anglican Society's most controversial emissaries, James B. Ginsburg, who spent a total of eight years on the Moroccan Jewish scene. Though not a full British citizen, the Russian-born Ginsburg enjoyed British consular protection when he engaged at missionary endeavors in Algeria and Mo- rocco. Operating out of Essaouira beginning in 1875, Ginsburg extended his work to additional communities from the Atlantic coast to the Atlas Mountains. Like oth- er heads of Protestant missions in the Maghreb who had converted to Christianity, 1.

Although there were few converts to Christianity in the communities, the Jew- ish masses, in part, evinced some interest in the London Society's programs. The poor of Essaouira and nearby towns frequented its boys' and girls' schools and solicited its medical and social services. One of Bashan's interesting points revolves around the cordial rapport between ordinary Jews and the Society's staff. The former ap- preciated the services rendered by the missionaries at a time when communal insti- tutions and the affluent elite displayed indifference to their needs. On the other hand, most rabbis, albeit not all of them, sought to sabotage Ginsburg's efforts everywhere by fomenting anti-missionary activities that sometimes bordered on violence. Gins- burg himself was once expelled from Morocco owing to political pressure imposed on the British government by the local Muslim authorities and rabbis. It is true that the British Minister Plenipotentiary at Tangier as well as the British consuls in Essaouira and elsewhere interceded to impose sanctions on An- glican and Presbyterian emissaries who alienated local rabbis and Muslim ulama. Nevertheless, Bashan reveals that these consuls often facilitated the work of the missions by teaching English and other subjects at their schools. Just as the AIU schools promoted French cultural influence in the precolonial and colonial peri- ods, the same held true for the British missionary schools or the Franciscan mis- sions. The British expressed eagerness to spread the English language by all means among the indigenous populations while the Franciscans with the aid of Spain's consular services extolled Spanish. The work of the Anglican missionaries among Jews and Muslims reached its zenith at the beginning of the twentieth century before witnessing a precipitous de- cline. One of the reasons for rabbinical support of the AIU network had to do with the rabbis' concern over the missions' potential influence over the impoverished socioeconomic stratum. The rabbis were now inclined to tolerate girls' education at the AIU so long as the missionaries were prevented from placing them under their wings. As Morocco after 1900 was coming under French control, the AIU ac- quired a virtual monopoly over modern education in the communities. Notwith- standing, the missions will be remembered more as pioneering catalysts for mod- ernization and social service rather than as forces seeking religious conversions. This monograph is a vital contribution to the history of Middle Eastern and Maghrebi Jewry in the nineteenth century. Despite some unnecessary repeti- tiveness in contents and typographical errors, not to mention the erroneous claim on pp. 18-19 that Casablanca did not have a mellah (Jewish quarter), Bashan ex- ploited his primary sources well, mainly the records of the British Foreign Office and the Protestant societies' bulletins. Furthermore, it would have been helpful for the Hebrew reader to translate the documents on pp. 145-178 into Hebrew, instead of presenting them with brief Hebrew summaries. Michael M.
