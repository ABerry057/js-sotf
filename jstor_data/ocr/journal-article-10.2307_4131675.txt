<plain_text><page sequence="1">Saul M. Olyan. Biblical Mourning: Ritual and Social Dimensions. New York: Oxford University Press, 2004. x, 174 pp. In his new book, Saul Olyan shows the surprisingly broad range of contexts in which mourning rites figured in ancient Israel. Olyan's great contribution is to move beyond the consideration of single passages and particular types of mourn- ing to fix the reader's attention on the broader phenomenon of mourning in the Hebrew Bible. His account is compelling because, although he is familiar with the anthropological literature, Olyan grounds his argument in textual evidence. His style is clear, inviting the reader to accompany him as he tests the dimensions of biblical mourning. After reviewing the relevant anthropological literature in the introduction, Olyan presents his own view of ritual and its relationship to emotion. Ritual may generate emotion, but it can also exist apart from and in tension with it. Olyan emphasizes the strong social implications of ritual-how it can create and transform the social order. The first three chapters present a typology of mourning, distinguishing among its various contexts. Mourning rites for the dead (Chap. 1) awaken appro- priately strong emotions in the mourner and establish a distinct ritual space separ- ating the mourner from others. They also debase the mourner, facilitating identification with the dead and thereby ensuring the proper maintenance of the ancestor cult. Olyan proposes that comforting mourners is likewise a social prac- tice, one that affirms the comforter's ties to the mourner. Mourning also plays a role in petition (Chap. 2). In penitential contexts, the self-abasement induced by mourning communicates shame and repentance. In nonpenitential contexts, it seizes the deity's attention and placates him by having the petitioner relinquish honor, just as one who makes a vow gives up property. Some instances of mourning are neither for the dead nor for the sake of petition (Chap. 3). Rather, they serve to "enact and communicate their sorrow, shame, and personal or corporate diminish- ment as well as create, affirm, or modify social relationships" (98). For example, in mourning for destroyed cities, Olyan notes an element of shame that is absent in mourning for the dead. Finally, for one who suffers from skin disease, a fourth category of mourning, self-abasement effects his or her social isolation. Prohibitions against the mourning practices of laceration and shaving in the Holiness Code and Deuteronomy (Chap. 4) derive from a concern about mixing mourning and rejoicing: As symbols of mourning, permanent scars interfere 440</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews with future rejoicing. Such mixing only occurs during times of national cata- strophe (Chap. 5), when a breakdown in ritual order is natural. Olyan's analysis generally assumes a distinction between ritual on the one hand and emotional expression on the other. As a stylized behavior, mourning is seen as prescribed and learned-that is, as ritual-rather than as a natural outpour- ing of emotion. If the purpose of mourning is not simply the expression of grief, Olyan reasons, it must aim at a variety of pragmatic results. And for each of mourn- ing's contexts, Olyan suggests many possibilities, highlighting especially its poten- tial impact on social relations, as reflected in the foregoing summary. This focus on function ultimately leads Olyan to define mourning on the basis of these contexts (mouming for the dead, petitionary mourning, etc.), resulting in a classification scheme that emphasizes its divergent uses rather than a unifying explanation for the biblical phenomenon as a whole. Detached from emotion, ritual takes on a life of its own in Olyan's work and operates according to its own internal logic. Thus, concepts such as ritual space, ritual identification, and the problem of ritual admixture-central components of Olyan's account-do not serve natural, expressive purposes but rather are required by the internal dynamics of the rite. In the case of mourning, I wonder about the justification for separating emotion and ritual. Emotive responses are susceptible to cultural conditioning, just like ritual, and in the case of mourning, the physical actions that Olyan calls "rites" often seem to be tightly bound up with emotional experience. One could even ask whether mourning is a ritual performance in ancient Israel or whether it is presented as such. To put it differently, cannot emotion take on forms of physical expression without assuming the formal status of a "ritual?" In brief, I am uncomfortable with Olyan's view that there are four distinct types of mourning. Rather, they all seem to represent a common physical-emotional response to disaster, a manifestation of grief that suits a variety of contexts. To classify these contexts as representing different types of mourning is to deny their underlying emotional and expressive basis in favor of a functional and prescriptive view of mourning and, indeed, of ritual generally. The major difficulty in interpreting biblical mourning is to account for how the same set of behaviors can be used both as part of an appeal to forestall cata- strophe and as a response to death, an irreversible disaster that has already occurred. Throughout his discussion of the types of mourning, Olyan recognizes that mourning rites debase the mourner, a true and important insight. But Olyan maintains that the purpose of debasement differs depending on the particular context of the mourning. Rather than serving a social or other pragmatic function, debasement seems to me, first and foremost, to constitute a reaction to loss, whether threatened or real, reversible or irreversible. Mourning rites act out phys- ically and visibly the diminishment from which the individual or nation suffers or imagines it will suffer. In the case of mouming for the dead, this manifestation of distress reveals the attachment of the mourner to the deceased; the loss of one diminishes the other. In the context of petition, mourning proves effective because manifesting distress moves the deity to pity. (As we find reflected throughout legal, narrative, psalmic, and prophetic literature, the God of Israel hears the prayers of the poor and afflicted.) 441</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Thus, whether for the dead or leading up to petition, mourning accomplishes the same thing: The practitioner assumes the status of an afflicted person. So, too, there is little reason to distinguish, as Olyan does, between mourning in penitential and nonpenitential contexts. Why should debasement be taken as an expression of remorse in one case and as giving something up for God (one's honor) in another? The fact is that a unitary explanation of mourning as a manifestation of suffering fits the sources' self-representation much more readily than the complex and sometimes obscure explanations that Olyan adopts, which are often based on uncertain analogies. Where, for example, does the Bible give any indication that mourning is efficacious because it constitutes a renunciation of one's honor to appease the deity, based on analogy with the use of vows in biblical prayer? (Moreover, are vows efficacious because one gives something up or because one gives something to God?) I am not sure I see the need for such complexity in analyzing biblical rites of mourning. The elevation or calcification of mourning as ritual obscures its underlying expressive role. Olyan is to be applauded for raising a host of valuable questions regarding a central component of ancient Israelite religion. But his book shows the need for continued thought about the construction of the category of ritual in biblical studies, both its usefulness and its pitfalls. David A.
