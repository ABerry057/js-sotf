<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE COVENANT OF THE PROPHETS: MUSLIM TEXTS, JEWISH SUBTEXTS by JACOB LASSNER For several years I have been trying to analyze Muslim historical think- ing and the manner in which it affected perceptions of the Jewish past-a past which Muslims fully appropriated as part of their own historical experi- ences and world-view. Put somewhat differently, I have been trying to understand the process by which a heritage common to both monotheistic faiths could and did become a bone of contention as well as a basis of mutual understanding. This linkage between Muslim self-reflection and the creation of a larger monotheist historiography is crucial to the formation of Muslim attitudes toward "the other," the polemical discourse against Jews and Judaism, and, more generally, Muslim-Jewish relations throughout the Middle Ages. The present study is culled from a project on Muslim uses of the Jewish past.' 1. An earlier study derived from this larger project is my "Muslim Uses of the Jewish Past: Ancient Themes and the Formation of Attitudes Towards the People of the Book," which was presented to the American Academy of Jewish Research in 1987. 207</page><page sequence="2">208 JACOB LASSNER Concerning Texts and Readers What follows is the tale of an Arabic text and two communities of readers: one the medieval community of learned Muslims, the other, various persons knowledgeable in Jewish sources but not necessarily believing Jews. The study is also a tale of two interpretive efforts: the first locates in the text a subtle but sharp Muslim polemic against the People of the Book; the second suggests a Jewish subtext, that is, a reading informed by rabbinic as well as Muslim sources. The larger intention is to explore the polemical use of the Jewish past by Muslims; the possible reaction of Jews to this appro- priation of their own history; and finally, the complex links between ancient Jewish themes and medieval Muslim literature. The case in point is the account of the origins of Muhammad's mission, in particular, the version cited by Ibn Isahq, the foremost of his medieval biographers.2 A ranking scholar of traditions, Ibn Ishaq had been compelled to leave his native Medina. The quality of his scholarship, if not his ortho- doxy and public behavior, had been seriously questioned by his learned opponents, principally Malik b. Anas and Hisham b. 'Urwah. The former accused him of falsifying written history by tampering with historical tradi- tions, the latter of scandalizing the historical fraternity by falsely quoting a most knowledgeable female informant. The evidence in both instances seems to have been inconclusive, and in the case of the informant, who was coincidentally Ibn 'Urwah's wife, it was entirely circumstantial.3 Neverthe- less, Ibn Ishlq left the holy city in self-imposed exile and traveled about Iraq and Iran before seeking the patronage of the Abbasid caliphs in the 750s of the common era.4 Having obtained it, he sat at the court of the newly estab- 2.

In such fashion, a distant monotheistic past was integrated with more recent Islamic events to form a single sacred history. Moving backward through time, the Abbasid caliph, Muhammad, and the earlier prophets formed one chain; the Abbasid polity, the com- munity, or ummah, of Mubammad's age, and the Bana Isra'il, or ancient Israelites, formed another. Elements of the Strah thus became part of the wide-ranging discourse that linked closely the tolerated People of the Book and the political factions of a hegemonic Muslim community. The passages of the Strah that interest us here represent the segment on the origins of Muhammad's mission, an account which is roughly divided into three episodes: God's preparations for the mission; the actual moment of Mubammad's revelation; and the confirmation that Mubammad was indeed a Prophet in the long line of prophets sent by God to minister to the needs of His subjects. For the benefit of readers lacking access to the original sources, a combination of loose translation and summary is provided.7 Text [A.] When Muhammad, the Messenger of God, reached the age of forty, 5.

Note, however, the reservations of U. Rubin, who calls attention to the prominent position of 'All in the Strah. See his "Prophets and Progenitors in the Early Shi'a Tradition,"Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam 1 (1979): 41-65. The favorable rendering of 'Ali does not detract from the text's pro-'Abbdsid bias (see J.

He enjoined them to believe in Muhammad, affirm the truth [of his mission], and assist him against those who would [later] oppose him. Moreover, God required of them that they should transmit this [the substance of the agree- ment] to all those who would have faith in them and assert the truth [of their prophetic missions]. The ancient prophets then transmitted this as required of them. [Concerning this] God said to Muhammad (here the author quotes Qur'an 3:75): "Behold, God exacted an agreement from the prophets, say- ing, 'What I have given you is revealed in Book and wisdom. Afterward there will come unto you a messenger to confirm what you have previously received. You shall affirm your faith in him and assist him. (God said:) Do you accept and take upon yourselves the burden (iSr) I have charged you with (that is, the thiqal that I have imposed upon you)?' They said: 'We accept.' Whereupon God said: 'Swear and I shall bear witness.' " Ibn Ishaq then goes on to explain that in such fashion God made a covenant with all [the prophets] to affirm the truth of Muhammad['s mission] and assist him against those who would [later] oppose him. The prophets then transmitted this [the substance of the agreement] to all those who had faith in them and asserted the truth of their missions from among the people of the two [revealed] books, that is, the biblical community. The Sfrah then indicates9 [B.] that Mubammad first experienced his prophecy through true visions which came to him as he slept and [C.] when the angel Gabriel came to him with the gift of God (that is, prophetic voca- tion) while Muhammad was all by himself at [Mount] Hira''0 during the month of Ramadan. [D.1] Mubammad had gone to Hira' to pray in seclu- sion, as he was wont to do for one month of every year when he practiced the pre-Islamic religious devotions of tabannuth."I On this occasion Gabriel came to Muhammad as he slept, and, following an awesome experience, the 8.

Upon awakening, the Prophet walked about the mountain and heard voices call- ing out to him from every stone and bush, "O Muhammad, you are the Messenger and I am Gabriel." Muhammad then witnessed a second awe- some experience. After being overcome for some time, the Prophet finally came to his senses. Returning home, he related the dramatic story of Gabriel's visitation to his wife, Khadijah, who then went to her learned cousin Waraqah b. Nawfal, to ascertain the significance of what had occurred.12 [D.2] Waraqah had previously converted to Christianity and thus read scripture. Moreover, he studied [oral traditions] from those who followed the Torah and the Gospel. When Khadijah related to her kinsman what the Messenger had told her, that which he had seen and heard, Waraqah exclaimed, "Holy! Holy! By God, if you have told me the truth, O Kha- dijah, verily the great angel Gabriel [or revelation]'3 who [or that] used to come to Moses has come to Muhammad. Muhammad is indeed the Prophet of this religious community. So tell him to remain steadfast." [D.3] Having learned of Waraqah's comments, Muhammad returned to the center of Mecca. There he encountered his wife's kinsman and, at the latter's request, personally informed him of what had transpired, as if to make sure that this had indeed been the long-awaited moment. Waraqah then replied, "Indeed, you are the [expected] Prophet of this religious community," and, repeating what he had previously said to Khadijah, he exclaimed, "The great angel Gabriel [or revelation] who [or that] used to come to Moses has come to you. You will surely be called a liar, subjected to harm, expelled, and con- fronted on the field of battle"-this last comment an indication that not everyone would accept him. What did these passages signify for Muslim readers? The surface mean- ing seems clear enough. The story of Mubammad's call to prophethood and the measures previously initiated by God in support of his mission are intended to demonstrate the legitimacy of Muhammad's calling-this, by linking him directly with the great prophets of the past. A closer reading of the text indicates that the opening and closing passages also serve as a com- 12. Ibn Hisham, 1:222-223; also EI2, s.v.

Finally, after some reflection, the story told by Ibn Ishlq is recog- nizable as a polemic against the more current People of the Book, mono- theists who, unlike Waraqah, do not recognize the truth of Muhammad's mission, even though it was revealed to them by way of their own sacred traditions. That is, this truth was received by way of their own prophets, spiritual leaders who themselves learned of Muhammad and his mission directly from God. The substantive arguments and the rhetorical strategies of this polemic require elaboration. Explication Readers of the Strah would not have been surprised that the Almighty had singled out Muhammad and put a good deal of thought into his mission before sending him at the age of forty "out of compassion for all of man- kind." Those acquainted with Muslim scripture were well aware that Muhammad was to be the last of God's prophets; the last to reveal His word; the last chance to provide mankind with an effective universal mes- senger. Given the importance of this mission, Allah was not about to rely solely on Muhammad's persuasiveness (which could be taken for granted)14 nor on the good intentions of his audience (which could not). To ensure Muhlammad's future success, God thought it necessary to summon all the prophets that He intended to send before Muhammad and to request of them that they pave the way for the latter's prophethood in a binding cove- nant with God Himself, an act which foreshadowed Muhammad's universal appeal. The expression "all of mankind"" which appears in the very first phrase of Ibn Ishbq's account should have been sufficient to alert even the dullest reader that it was not God's ultimate intention to send Muhammad with a message that was limited to his own kinsmen among the Arabs of Quraysh, and that the geographical parameters of his assignment were not restricted 14. See, for example, Ibn Hishim, 2:90-91, where Muhammad's opponents reject a plan to exile him for fear that he will, by his eloquence, win over the tribesmen in whose midst he would be forced to dwell. 15. Kdfatan li'l-nds.</page><page sequence="7">MUSLEM TEXTS, JEWISH SUBTEXTS 213 to his native Mecca, or even the Arabian peninsula.16 The universal scope of Muhammad's mission, indicated by the words "all of mankind," explains the need for extensive preparations involving the whole range of prophets who preceded him. By revealing their faith in Muhammad's inevitable com- ing and by affirming the truth of his future revelation, Moses and the other prophets of the Bani Isra'il should have paved the way for his acceptance among the latter-day Jews (and Christians). Ibn Ishbq makes no such expli- cit claim, but most readers of this text, whether medieval or modern, Muslim or non-Muslim, would have concluded that this must have been God's intention when He enjoined the (Israelite) prophets to enter into a covenant with Him. Bearing the Jews in mind, the same readers would then have been left to ponder why the Jewish tribes of Arabia, unlike their ancient prophets, spurned Mubammad, rejected his mission, and in certain instances went so far as to betray him. Moreover, the Jews, however limited their subsequent capacity for political opposition, continued wherever and whenever to reject the legitimacy of the Prophet and his true revelation by clinging to current beliefs and attitudes. Given the thrust of this tradition in the Strah, its readers could not easily assume that the continued intransigence of the Jews was based entirely on an absence of knowledge or on some misconception inherited from the past. The Jews' own prophets, fulfilling a sacred oath to God, no less, had not only believed in the coming of Muhammad and the legitimacy of his revela- tion, but had actually transmitted these convictions to their coreligionists. If, indeed, the Jews continued to reject Mubammad, it was not likely to be ignorance which compelled them, it was intransigent hypocrisy-the same hypocrisy which had been manifesting itself among people of their faith since the time of Moses, who was himself subjected to malicious gossip and rejected by those who considered themselves believers. The opposition to Moses, a theme developed at length in both the Hebrew Bible and the Qur'an,'7 is an egregious case of a self-critical Jewish tradition being turned forcefully against the Jews by others. The Strah makes it clear, albeit in- directly, that the rejection of Muhammad was parallel to the well- documented rejection of Moses. Or put somewhat differently, the rejection 16. The question of Mulammad's changing intentions at the various stages of his career remains of vital importance. Later commentators ascribed to Muhammad a global mission from the outset. 17. For example, Qur'an 2:83, 20:85-89, 33:69, 61:5.</page><page sequence="8">214 JACOB LASSNER of Mubammad was the rejection of the prophetic faith, that is, the authentic faith which the faithful among the ancient Israelites had practiced -and which current Jews, emulating their hypocritical ancestors, claimed as their own but did not actually revere. Such was the nature of hypocrites in con- trast to their prophets." Some may feel that this broad-ranging explication represents a rather elastic reading of the SFrah, and that the suggested interpretation of the seg- ment on Muhammad's mission, namely, that it was a subtle polemic against the People of the Book, and, more particularly, against the Jews, is more than Ibn Ish.q's slight text is capable of yielding. However, the testimony of the Qur'an and its commentary supports the linkage between the Prophet and his predecessors, and it was this claimed linkage between monotheistic prophets and communities which gave rise to anti-Jewish (and also anti- Christian) polemics. Indeed, a wide variety of Muslim sources make it clear that, in the best of all worlds, the monotheists would be seen as a single com- munity with unifying traditions deeply rooted in an-ancient past. For the followers of Mubammad, Islam was not a new departure, an entirely new religion to be offered mankind. From the outset of prophecy there was only one true faith, albeit a faith revealed through different authentic revelations and in different languages. The faith of Moses, the Hebrew lawgiver, was the faith of Islam. Or, put somewhat differently, Moses and the faithful among the Israelites submitted themselves totally to God, in accordance with the wider meaning of the Arabic verb aslama and the verbal noun isldm. This distinction between Islam, meaning the system of beliefs and practices expounded by Mubammad, and a more broadly defined islam, practiced by earlier monotheists in accordance with the authentic revelation of their prophets, is suggested in the Qur'an and confirmed by a wide variety of texts that inform scripture, the Strah of Ibn Is1hq among them.'9 18. Note Ibn Hishdm, 2:125 ff., for a specific linkage between the Jews of Medina and the hypocrites (mundfiqan), former polytheists who paid lip-service to Muhammad and Islam. One might indeed argue that it was the political linkage between the hypocrites and the Jews that was of the greatest concern for the Prophet and as much as anything condemned the Jews to their faith: extermination or exile. A full reevaluation of the Prophet's political relations with the Jews is long overdue. 19. On the development of the term Islam, see EI2; also D. H.

For example, when Solomon, who is regarded in Muslim tradition as a prophet, completed the Temple in Jerusalem, he set off with his retinue to pay homage to God in the sacred land (arax al-haram).2' Lest one be confused, the reference is not to someplace in the Kingdom of Israel, but to Mecca-in Muslim eyes, the older and more venerated sanctuary.22 In Mecca, Solomon performed the required ritual practices.23 Then, in these most appropriate surroundings, he revealed to his people the glad tidings of Muhammad's future mission, informing them that Muhammad would be "the Lord and Seal of the Prophets," that is, the greatest and last of them. Moreover, he explained to his followers that proof of this future occurrence and of Muhammad's exalted status was already "fixed" in their holy scrip- ture.24 One could hardly have expected less of Solomon. If we are to believe the text of the Strah, he, as a monotheistic prophet, would have been obligated by the special covenant with God to support MuInammad's future mission; that is, Solomon was obliged to affirm Muhammad's legitimacy to his own Israelite followers. As if this were not ample proof of Solomon's isldm, then later on, when he sought to bring Bilqis, the non-Israelite Queen of Sheba, 20. This term is used by Muslim writers to cover the extended narratives and incidental commentary that complement summary information on biblical events and personages men- tioned in the Qur'an. It also refers to the didactic treatment of biblical events and personages not mentioned in Muslim scripture. Some of this material, if not a good part of it, was intro- duced in Islamic texts by way of Jewish sources. I am currently engaged in a study of this pro- cess of cultural transmission. For the pertinent secondary literature, see EI2, s.v. "Isrf'iliyyat" and "Banfi Isra'il"; the bibliography of W. M. Thackston, Jr., The Tales of the Prophets ofal- Kisd't (Boston, 1978); also F.

An anno- tated translation of the 'Ard'is is being readied by W. M. Brinner of the University of Califor- nia, Berkeley. 22. Although in later Mamlfik and Ottoman usage, the term al-Haramayn occasionally refers to Jerusalem and Hebron, there is no confusion here as to the author's intention.

(muthbat fi zabitrihim).</page><page sequence="10">216 JACOB LASSNER back to monotheism, he enjoined her to come to him as a Muslim in a letter whose salutation is identical to that later used by Mulhammad in his diplo- matic correspondence.25 There is, to be sure, a double-entendre in calling upon Bilqis to become a Muslim. It signifies the personal submission (islam) of the phallic Bilqis to Solomon the man, as well as her total submission to God. A woman, halfjinn and half human, Bilqis had previously decapitated her sleeping husband after getting him drunk on their wedding night.26 Dis- posing of him in this brutal fashion, she was able to seize his half of a divid- ed kingdom that she had been forced to share. Bilqis was not one to be trifled with, nor was she without considerable resources. She was, as the Qur'an puts it, "given something of everything."27 But as God's prophet, Solomon was more than her equal. Even her precious throne, the symbol of her temporal power and an object protected by the most elaborate security, was not safe from the prophet. With God's help it was delivered to him in the twinkling of an eye-this, according to some Muslim commentaries, so that he could take possession of it in accordance with Muslim law. For, once converted to Islam, or recognizing Muslim suzerainty, Bilqis would have been entitled to regain her property.28 Her ingenious ploys exhausted and her tactics proven useless, she realized that Solomon was the victor and capitulated. Accepting God through recognition of Solomon's prophetic vocation, she finally comes to the prophet and exclaims, "We have become Muslims."29 Keeping in mind a broadly defined islam widely shared by the earlier monotheists, we can now return to the story of Muhammad's mission in the Strah. After describing how God safeguarded Mulhammad's future by enjoining the earlier prophets to commit themselves on his behalf, the text turns to the moment of revelation, then to Khadijah's suspicion that her husband is, as she put it, "the prophet of this religious community," and ultimately to Waraqah's declarations confirming Muhlammad's newly revealed status. For Waraqah was quick to recognize that the angel Gabriel (or the revelation), who (or which) had previously come to Moses, had now 25. Ibid., p. 314.

So the narrative of the Strah leads us to believe; in any case this is what the author wants us to believe.30 The medieval reader who understood the broad meaning of the Cove- nant of the Prophets would not have had any difficulty understanding the intent of Waraqah's declaration to Khadijah and his later, almost identical statement to Muhammad. The specific mention of earlier visits by the angel to Moses, or of revelations previously received by Moses, is an obvious attempt to link Muhammad to the prophets of the past and to Moses in particular, thus uniting the opening and closing episodes of the larger tradi- tion while at the same time bringing the book on prophecy to a close. This was consistent with the Muslim view already expressed in the Qur'an that Muhammad was the Lord and Seal of the Prophets.3' That there should be a direct link between the two lawgivers, Moses, the first of God's prophets according to rabbinic tradition, and Muhammad, the last of God's prophets according to Muslim tradition, comes as no surprise. The two are juxta- posed time and again in the Arabic literature on the ancient Israelites. The Qur'an itself indicates, albeit somewhat indirectly, that the Prophet Muhammad regarded Moses as a predecessor who had foretold his (Mul.ammad's) future mission to the Israelites and had indicated that it was duly recorded in the sacred scripture of the Hebrew Bible.32 There is strong evidence to suggest that certain qur'anic passages are in large part the in- spiration for Ibn Ishq's discussion of the Prophet's mission, particularly the middle section of suirah 3, the segment of the Qur'an dealing with the family of Amram, Moses' father. As we have pointed out, one verse from this sfirah is, in fact, woven into the fabric of Ibn Islhiq's narrative, which then serves as a commentary on it. The verse on the covenant (3:75), which is repeated here, reads: Behold, God exacted an agreement from the prophets saying: What I have given you is revealed book and wisdom 30. Ibn Hishim, 1:322. 31. Arabic khatam al-nabfyrn and sayyid al-anbiyd'. This conception of Muhlammad's honored position among the monotheistic prophets is explicitly stated in the Qur'an and was, from the outset, part of Muslim religious thought. See Qur'an 33:40. 32. Qur'an 3:75 (81).</page><page sequence="12">218 JACOB LASSNER Afterward there will come unto you A messenger to confirm what you have previously received You shall affirm your faith in him [that is, in his coming] And [thus] assist him Do you accept and take upon yourselves the Burden I have charged you with? They said: We accept Whereupon God said: "Swear and I shall bear witness." The informed reader of the STrah undoubtedly knew scripture by heart; the medieval Muslim tradition of learning placed great emphasis on rote learn- ing. There would have been no problem for him to conjure up successive passages of the Qur'an, or for that matter the entire segment in which the relevant verse is found. The appearance of this verse in Ibn Ishq's tale would have triggered the reader's memory and supplied him with the larger context as a matter of course. Basing himself on a broad reading of the entire suirah and its commentaries, such a reader would surely have under- stood that it was Ibn Ishaq's intention to reaffirm what Mul.ammad, speak- ing God's word, had said concerning Jews (and Christians) elsewhere in that siurah and indeed in the other siurahs as well. That is, that they, meaning the hypocritical descendants of the ancient Israelites, resist public recognition of what they know in their hearts. For example, Qur'an 3:72 speaks of a faction that deliberately twists the Holy Text (Kitab) in order to confuse true believers who might reckon their false interpretation as part of scripture. "They say that it is God's [Word], but it is not God's. So they speak falsely of God while knowing better." Thus Jews in particular are accused of prefer- ring distorted scriptural interpretations (by the rabbis) to the authentic words of prophets. In any case, this is how the verses were understood by Muslim exegetes who singled out the Jews (Yahfd) of Arabia for blame. Specifically mentioned are Ka'b al-Ashraf and Huyyay b. Akhtab, well- known opponents of the Prophet who paid dearly for their opposition.33 To be sure, the argument against the People of the Book is not stated explicitly by Ibn IshIq. The author utilizes instead a strategy of indirect dis- course, wherein coded evidence is placed before the reader, who is then 33. For example, Tabari, Jami' (Cairo, 1984), 3:323-324; and more sharply in Rizi, Tafsrr (Cairo, 1985), 4:117-120. For Ka'b and HIuyayy, see the standard histories of the period.</page><page sequence="13">MUSLEM TEXTS, JEWISH SUBTEXTS 219 asked to sort it out and draw conclusions where none are specified. This was consistent with the manner in which medieval Muslims were obliged to interpret their own history, and, more generally, to read texts. Reading was an intricate game that encouraged combining historical and textual memory with strong powers of observation and reason. In such fashion, Muslims were able to discover the truth without the intrusive presence of the author. Sometimes the texts were so deliberately opaque that it required a major effort to decode the evidence, even for the most learned scholars. But upon discovering the truth after considerable effort, the reader, smugly satisfied with his intellectual triumph, was likely to defend it with tenacity. In time, such personal truths became conventional wisdom and were subsequently transmitted among generations of Muslims.34 Given the range of difficult traditions medieval readers could encounter, the story of Mulhammad's mission in the Strah seems at first fairly straight- forward. The argument against the People of the Book generated by Ibn Islhq's explication of Qur'an 3:75 is easily accessible even though the verse itself is highly problematic and subject to much discussion and conflicting interpretation. But various exegetes who may have understood the text as it is translated and explicated here may also have thought that the charge was not sufficiently wide. In any event, there are interpretations that make it possible to state more directly the case against the Jews (and Christians) for readers who might not fully grasp the indictment. Referring to the qur'anic verse, they contend that the Covenant of the Prophets referred not to the prophets or to the prophets alone, but to their followers. This interpreta- tion, that the followers of God's prophets were similarly asked to sign a binding oath, is shared by a number of authorities.35 However, it is rooted in a grammatical note that is without ideological focus. Thus, at first glance, the change occasioned by this interpretation may appear rather slight to those interested in polemics. But the qur'anic verse states only that the prophets took the pledge. It obviously implied that, having committed themselves to God, the prophets carried out their obligation. There is, however, no specific indication of this in the Qur'an itself. No wonder Ibn 34. The rhetorical strategies of medieval Muslim polemicists are described in Lassner, Islamic Revolution and Historical Memory, esp. pp. 1-33. 35.

However, even here there is uncertainty of blame, for it is not made absolutely clear that the Band Isra'il truly understood what was intended for them, only that they had heard it from their prophets. Despite the best of intentions, the prophets may have been lacking when they transmitted their message. The new interpretation, that the followers of the prophets also took the oath, renders these doubts superfluous. By mak- ing the Israelites a direct party to the covenant, the new interpretation eliminates any possibility of misunderstanding about Muhammad and his mission. God is, after all, the quintessential communicator. Seeking greater clarity regarding those taking this pledge, one of the exegetes contends that the expression "Covenant of the Prophets" should be read as "Covenant of the Children of the Prophets, meaning the Banu Isra'il," that is, the Children of Israel.36 Specified by name, on this occasion the Jews (and also Christians) are revealed as direct recipients of the truth concerning Mulhammad's sacred vocation ( a truth which they were obliged to affirm in a special oath of their own). Were there any doubt left as to the gist of these statements, the exegete cites still another view making it abso- lutely clear that the People of the Book consciously and maliciously distort- ed their revelation in order to deny Muh.ammad and the Muslims. For it is reported that the term "prophets" in the qur'anic verse is used mockingly (if not with a touch of sarcasm), and when properly understood, refers more broadly to the Israelites, who used to say, "We have a better claim to be prophets [i.e., to understand prophecy] than Muhammad, since we are the People of the Book and the prophets were from among us." Ibn Ishaq's account is consistent with this sense of broadened responsibility for the Banfi Isra'il. The basic thrust of his polemic was no doubt understood in this way by Muslim readers, so that, when necessary, this account of the Sirah and others like it could have been used as a weapon in the discourse against the Jews. Is There a Jewish Subtext? Might others have looked at this text somewhat differently? A second 36. Baydawi, Anwar (Leiden, 1846), p. 163. Perhaps the sharpest condemnation of the Jews that utilizes this verse is that of Rizi. See n. 35 above.</page><page sequence="15">MUSLEM TEXTS, JEWISH SUBTEXTS 221 and even closer reading of the material encourages us to consider a more complex and problematic literary history to the interpretation of Qur'an 3:75. The comments of the STrah and the exegetes seem to suggest a possible Hebrew subtext, that is, a reading of the STrah informed by rabbinic as well as Muslim literature. This line of inquiry presupposes possible connections between Hebrew and Arabic sources and raises several interesting, albeit difficult, questions about the transmission and integration of Jewish themes in early Islamic traditions,37 the identity and aims of possible transmitters, the specific identity of presumed communities of readers who would have known Jewish as well as Arabic sources, and finally, the nature of the dis- course that would have been suggested by the supposed "Jewish" readings. These are queries that can only give rise to highly speculative responses. Nevertheless, the discussion engendered by these broad-ranging questions is important to this and, indeed, any investigation of Muslim polemics, as well as to the larger subject of cultural borrowing among the Peoples of the Book. For the sake of argument, let us pursue at this point a line of inquiry which suggests that Jewish texts may have influenced the composition of Muslim sources. One might begin by asking what there is in the afore- mentioned Arabic accounts that reflects Jewish material. Absorbing the STrah's story of the origins of Muhammad's mission and, more specifically, the episode of God's covenant with the ancient prophets, a learned or perhaps even somewhat knowledgeable reader of Jewish sources would have been struck by the remarkable similarities in the careers of Moses and Muhlammad, great lawgivers whose lives were generally marked by many interesting if not intentional concurrences.38 In particular, the presumed subtext would have been highlighted by a statement that already appears in the first line of the account, namely, the reported age at which Muhammad began his prophetic vocation. Ibn Ishiq begins by telling us that Muhammad was forty when God sent him out of compassion for all of mankind. The statement would have recalled still another Muslim tradition, namely, that Moses was forty when he came upon the burning bush in the wilderness, the event that was to mark for him the beginning of God's calling. Thus, it is strongly suggested that reaching forty and accepting the responsibilities of prophecy go hand in 37. A theoretical paper on these considerations is in progress. 38. A comprehensive study of Moses in the Islamic tradition is worthy of the most serious attention. Indeed, it is rather astounding that such a study has not yet been undertaken.</page><page sequence="16">222 JACOB LASSNER hand.39 One should not assume, however, that either prophet was actually in his forty-first year when chosen by God. The age of forty is rather a symbol of full maturity. Forty should be more correctly rendered as "forty- ish" and understood in the cultural context of a time when accomplished men of that age earned the full respect of society (what used to be called middle age before changing life-styles rendered that category offensive to male and female sensibilities alike). Reflecting on life's cycle, the Qur'an, in another passage, speaks about the significance of reaching forty, when a man is most powerful and therefore fully able to appreciate God's benefi- cence. The passage strongly suggests a convergence of emotional maturity and physical prowess, qualities respected in those who aspire to leadership and the responsibilities that go with it. At least that is how the medieval exegetes seem to have understood the verse.40 Addressing the origins of this conception, a scholar recently proposed that the age of forty attributed to the Prophet was a topos recalling the clas- sical notion of akme.4' In selecting Mulhammad for prophethood at that age, God invoked an ancient and time-honored precedent, that of choosing a man at the perfect balance of his physical and intellectual powers; that balance which was for the Greeks and Romans the very essence of maturity. As a matter of course, one should respect the possibility of classical origins, for Greco-Roman culture had a strong residual influence in the Near East long after its champions lost political control of the region. But if the con- cept as it appears here is at all derived from a pre-Islamic topos, it could well have been absorbed more directly from a Semitic or, to be more precise, Jewish tradition, where forty is also generally understood to be the age of maturity. Among the many examples, a pithy maxim from the Babylonian Talmud suggests that it took Moses forty years to learn the mind of his Master, explaining thereby a previous failure to carry out a task for lack of understanding God's wish.42 Given the close relationship between Muhlammad and Moses in the 39.

Hence, several other traditions about these prophets and their respective life-cycles require consideration here. Elaborating on the biblical verse "And Moses was 120 years [i.e., at the time of his death],"43 the Sifre, an ancient rabbinic commentary, links the great lawgiver of the Hebrews with three talmudic sages, each of whom bore impeccable credentials for expounding Mosaic law.44 Like Moses, Hillel the Elder, Jochanan ben Zakkai, and Rabbi Akiba all died at 120, but, more pertinent to the current discussion, the Sifre indi- cates that in each case their life-cycles were divided into equal components of forty years. After emerging from Babylonia at the age of forty, Hillel reportedly studied forty years with scholars (of the law), and in the last seg- ment of his life, he maintained (the community of) Israel. Similarly, Jochanan ben Zakkai spent the last two periods of his life engaged, respec- tively, in study and in communal leadership, this after he had devoted the first forty years to practical concerns. And finally there was Akiba. Unlet- tered during the formative period of his life, he spent the next forty years in scholarship before capping his career as a leader of his people. The proto- type for these expounders of God's law was, of course, Moses himself. According to the text, he had spent forty years in Egypt, a similar time in Midian, and then, as did his learned successors, he devoted the final segment of his illustrious career to leading the people Israel. If it is correct to speak of a topos regarding the Arabic text, and if the topos was indeed derived from Jewish tradition, the likely significance of specifying Muhammad's age is not to provide random information, nor to suggest only that he was possessed by a disposition that fully integrated body and mind. Rather, the use of the Jewish topos would have served to legitimize the Prophet by juxtaposing him with Moses and linking their careers, a theme that pervades Islamic texts dealing with prophecy and, as we have seen, this segment of the Strah in particular. As Waraqah b. Nawfal put it: "The Great Angel [or revelation] that used to come to Moses has come to Muhammad." Muhammad, the last and greatest of God's prophets according to Islamic tradition, and Moses, the first and greatest according to Jewish sources, both embarked on major adventures upon reaching the 43. Deut. 34:7. 44. Sifre Deut. 429.</page><page sequence="18">224 JACOB LASSNER ripe age of forty. In each instance, the change constituted an irreversible break with an earlier environment. After slaying the Egyptian taskmaster, Moses was compelled to flee to the land of Midian, where he sojourned for another forty years away from family, home, and the comforts of the Pharaoh's household. Then, beginning a third cycle of forty years, he led a disparate band of people from Egypt and, upon receiving the revelation at Sinai, fashioned them into God's community. For Muhammad, reaching the age of forty marked the beginning of his mission and a difficult encounter with his Meccan kinsmen, the oligarchs of Quraysh, an encounter which led to his exodus and to the formation of an Islamic community under his leadership.45 At first glance, one might wish to dismiss these parallels as a coincidence in life-cycles generated by a familiar convention or topos. But it is precisely such coincidences that would have had special importance for readers famil- iar with both Hebrew and Arabic texts. Indeed, these traditions linking Moses and Muhammad might very well have given rise to other associations based on other comparable traditions in Muslim and Jewish sources, for example, accounts concerning the birth and death of MuIhammad and Moses, that is to say, the first and final moments of their life-cycles.46 Can it also be mere coincidence that the two great messengers were born and died on the same day of the same month according to rabbinic and Muslim tradi- tions respectively? To be sure, the traditions regarding the dates of birth and death are not directly suggested by the Strah's account of Muhlammad's mission; still, for a reader juxtaposing the life-cycles of the Muslim prophet and the great Hebrew lawgiver, they would surely have come to mind. Medieval readers who had committed a vast literature to memory were able to compare in detail all sorts of similar and disparate texts, and were, in addition, skilled at detecting the many nuances that these texts conveyed. Such a reader might be likened to a human computer. Once "life-cycle" entered his consciousness, the relevant traditions stored in his abundant memory came to light.47 45. Prior to the hijrah there was no discrete Muslim community, only individual Muslims who were identified by their tribal affiliations. The move to Medina created an Islamic ummah, or community, that theoretically transcended blood affiliations and replaced them with reli- gious ties. The ummah of Medina thus came to include diverse individuals and groups similar in certain respects to the heterogeneous community that followed Moses out of Egypt. 46. E.

Muhlammad's cir- cumstances were not coincidental, but were governed by a predetermined scheme-at least that is suggested by medieval Muslim scholars. They report that the Prophet himself revealed to his companion Bilal, "I was born on that day [Monday], was sent on my mission that day, and shall die [as fated] on that day."49 Speaking further of events in the life-cycle, Hebrew and Arabic sources indicate that both Moses and Muhlammad were born fully circumcised.50 The point of the Jewish tradition, if I understand it correctly, is not that Moses was born without a foreskin, as some infants are, but that he was born ritually clean. As a result, he did without the usual Jewish berith milah, a ceremony that traditionally takes place on the eighth day following birth, marking the entry of the child into the community of believers in accordance with a precedent established during Abraham's covenant (berith) with God.5" The emblematic use of circumcision, so central to Jewish identity, is critical to several stories of Moses' career. Placed beside the river in order to avoid the certain death that had been decreed for every newborn Hebrew male, Moses was subsequently discovered by Pharaoh's daughter. Accord- ing to the rabbis, the sign of the Abrahamic covenant on Moses' body, namely, the absence of a foreskin, immediately alerted her to the child's origins.52 Nevertheless, she brought him to her father's household, where he 48.

In all, thirteen were said to have been so born, including Balaam, by ARN, which provides a list and scriptural support for this contention.

When, on the eve of departing Egypt, the Israelites were instructed to partake of the paschal lamb, only the circumcised were allowed to do so. The circumcision of the Israelites is taken for granted, but not that of their household slaves and protected clients. Therefore, it was decreed that (uncircumcised) slaves and clients had to undergo the ritual.54 The collective body of those who were circumcised was then subjected to a single law, in effect forming the community that Moses was to lead out of Egypt, the very community that was later to receive the covenant at Sinai and whose descen- dants were to form the nucleus of the people and polity of Israel."5 In such fashion, a rite de passage practiced globally by the most disparate of peoples and reflecting universal concerns from the beginning of time was appro- priated and given specific Jewish meaning in historical accounts familiar to all Jews and those acquainted with Jewish tradition. As do Jews, Muslims date their ritual of circumcision to the time of Abraham,56 but, surprisingly enough, the Arabic legal term for circumci- sion, khitcn, does not appear in the Qur'an, nor is there any firm evidence in that text that the ritual was prescribed for the believers. Words stemming from the root kh-t-n are, of course, quite common in Classical Arabic;"5 indeed the medieval lexicons give kh-t-n the full semantic range that it receives in other Semitic languages, but in none of these other languages do words stemming from equivalent roots indicate circumcision. The root h-t-n does give rise to words signifying various forms of family associations or rituals, it indicates protection and clientage, but apparently not the ritual of removing the foreskin.58 The only text linking h-t-n with circumcision remains the enigmatic biblical story of Moses' return to Egypt, a journey he undertook in order to champion the cause of his people.59 Sent by God to threaten Pharaoh with the death of his firstborn son, lest 53.

When, inexplicably, God sought to kill his chosen emissary, Zipporah, Moses' wife, responded immediately to the dangerous course of events. Tak- ing a flint, she cut off the foreskin of her son and, touching his feet with it, exclaimed, "For you are my batan of blood." God then let Moses go, where- upon she said, "A batan of blood as regards circumcision." The meaning of these extremely difficult passages and of batan in this particular context has been the source of lengthy commentaries and tortuous explanations ever since ancient times.60 These include modern interpretations rooted in early anthropology. Accordingly, the circumcision of Moses' son was the equiva- lent of khitan among the Arabs, and both rites were said to stem from a fer- tility ritual performed at puberty by the most ancient Semites in preparation for connubium. The loss of the foreskin redeemed the life of the husband- to-be (Heb. hatan; Ar. khatan) from some demonic spirit or force, guaran- teeing thereby future reproductive powers leading to many offspring and, hopefully, many males. However appealing this interpretation may be to scholars still enamored of obscure Semitic origins, there is no direct evidence to support any of these connections. No new solution based on a bold etymological claim is suggested here; although those given to speculate free- ly may be inclined to cite this text if only to raise once again a possible tie, however remote, between a Muslim practice and an opaque Jewish text about Moses, who unlike his son, had the good fortune to be born fully cir- cumcised. More important to our discussion is the Arabic text which quotes Mulhammad as having said that he (too) was born fully circumcised "thanks to the grace of my Lord."6' We are prompted to ask what precise meaning this tradition suggested to Muslim readers, and what history, if any, informed this particular account. The absence of a qur'anic reference to khitan notwithstanding, it is likely, if not probable, that circumcision was practiced among the Meccans and other Arabs in the lifetime of the Proph- et. In any case, that was the perception of medieval Muslims.62 The earliest law codes discuss the ritual in great detail, some authorities declaring it to be 60. An excellent summary of the literature but a not very convincing explanation of the pas- sages can be found in J. Morgenstern, "The 'Bloody Husband' (?)

Current customs vary: young Muslim boys are ordinarily circumcised between the ages of seven and twelve, sometimes younger, sometimes older, but, in any event, the reference is to years, not days. As regards the circumcision of infants, some legal opinions of the Middle Ages allow, even recommend, but ultimately do not require that the ritual be performed eight days after birth. Others, less favor- ably inclined to infant circumcision, question the propriety of following a custom observed by the Jews. When all the evidence is weighed, there is no proof that infant circumcision was practiced among the early Muslims. Indeed, there is reason to surmise that in the formative years of Islam the ritual was conducted after the advent of puberty.63 In any case, Muslim chil- dren prepared to enter into a state of ritual purity, fully conscious and aware of what was about to take place, and no anticipated reward was likely to replace the enormous feelings of uneasiness leading up to the event. No doubt, disturbing memories of circumcision persisted through adult life. One might therefore conjecture that God's generosity in the Arabic account was occasioned by an author's desire to spare Muhlammad the psychic dis- comfort that he, the author, if not indeed all Muslim boys, felt during the ceremony-a trauma not consciously shared by week-old Jewish infants who are mildly sedated by wine. It is the Jewish father or grandfather who is likely to be most uncomfortable at the time of the ceremony. Clearly, circumcision was for Muslims not so emblematic a practice as it was for Jews, whose very identity as Jews was tied to it. Nor was it so informed by history, as in Jewish sources. And yet, even if one were to accept the highly conjectural psychoanalytic reading that is suggested here, the tradition of the Prophet's emergence from his mother's womb without a foreskin can still be informed by historically defined concerns-at least for highly literate Muslims. As with the immaculate circumcision of Moses, the Arabic text links purity and identity to legitimacy. Muslim sources indicate that this miracle was nothing less than a sign of prophetic calling and list a line of Messengers, including Moses, as having been, in this respect, re- cipients of God's grace. Mulhammand's birth sine proepution was no less than a dramatic statement affirming his place among God's chosen emis- 63. It is reported that 'Abdallah b. al-'Abbas claimed to have been circumcised at the time of the Prophet's death. Since Ibn 'Abbas was reportedly born three years before the hijrah, that would have made him thirteen at the time of his circumcision.</page><page sequence="23">MUSLEM TEXTS, JEWISH SUBTEXTS 229 saries, the monotheistic prophets.64 As in the Jewish sources previously cited, circumcision is linked in this Muslim tradition to specific events of his- torical, or, to be more correct, metahistorical importance. In this instance, a Muslim borrowing from the older Jewish tradition, even if it was an indirect borrowing, should be seriously considered. As a rule, one ought to be careful and draw distinctions in analyzing linkages that deal with experiences of the life-cycle. For example, one is less impressed that rabbinic and Muslim sources speak of easy pregnancies for Aminah, the mother of Mubammad, and Jochebed, the mother of Moses, and of a great luminescence that emanated from the lucky women either in pregnancy or at birth-these seem to be topoi of a universal nature, and many such comparisons could be cited.65 More generally, the imposition of symmetry on important events of the life-cycle is both familiar and time- honored. Some skeptics might therefore require additional evidence before considering, let alone conceding, a possible Jewish subtext tying Muham- mad, Moses, and the Covenant of the Prophets. Certainly, more evidence should be required of those wishing to argue that Jewish sources directly inform the text of the Strah, that is, that Jewish themes were deliberately recast here to serve the needs of Muslim claims that Mubammad was a legi- timate monotheistic prophet. There is the presumption of additional evidence-to argue for more would surely be pushing the text-in yet another well-known rabbinic tradi- tion. However indirectly, Ibn Isbaq's account of the Covenant of the Prophets recalls the role played by the Israelite prophets when the revelation was given by God to Moses at Sinai. The reference here is to a passage in the Midrash Tanhuma, a rabbinic tract that was compiled in Islamic times (it is even possible that the redactor of the Tanhuma was a contemporary of Ibn Ishaq).66 Despite the late date claimed by modern scholars for the recension 64. The biblical figures mentioned include: Adam, Seth, Noah, Shem, Jethro (Shu'ayb, who is elsewhere identified by Muslims as Jeremiah), Lot, Joseph, Solomon, the mysterious Idris (identified by Muslims with Enoch and also Elijah), Zechariah (probably identified by Muslims as the father of John the Baptist and not the Israelite king), and of course Moses-all figures from the Hebrew Bible. In addition, there are John (the Baptist) and, to be sure, Jesus. There are, all told, thirteen biblical figures, as in the rabbinic tradition of ARN. See above, n. 50. To these are added the Arab prophets: Hangalah, Salih, Hfid, and Muh.ammad. 65. For example, Ibn Hishdm, Strah, 1:146 ff.; BT Sotah 12a, 13a. These were, of course, understood as miraculous events legitimizing the future prophets. 66. Several texts fall under this loose rubric. See Encyclopaedia Judaica, s.v. "Tanhiuma Yelammedenu." The passages quoted here are from the Warsaw edition that was republished in Israel. The passages are not found in the body of Buber's edition.</page><page sequence="24">230 JACOB LASSNER of the Jewish text, it may contain, in this case as in others, echoes of more ancient Jewish sources that were known and presumably discussed among Jews in Islamic lands. One therefore ought to consider whether the midrash might have influenced readers of the Strah who were knowledgeable in Jewish sources, or, exercising license to speculate freely, even imagine that material from the Tanhuma might have informed directly the Arabic account of the Covenant of the Prophets. The midrash reports, "That which all the prophets were destined to prophesy [in each generation] they received at Mount Sinai."''67 Since readers of the Hebrew text might not have quite understood how prophets who were yet to grace this world could have received their revelations along with Moses, the source points out, "These are [not actually the prophets but] the souls (of the prophets) that will one day be created." After biblical proof- texts are cited in order to confirm this statement, the Tanhuma goes on to widen the group receiving direct authority at Sinai, as did various Muslim exegetes in widening the group that entered into the Covenant of the Prophets. As the author put it, "The prophets were not alone [in receiving their prophecy at Sinai]. Each [and every one] of the sages that was and was destined to be (also received his authority at Sinai). For it is written, 'These words the Lord spoke to all your assembly.' "68 In such fashion the Midrash Tanhuma validates the entire chain of religious personae that transmitted God's word in authoritative fashion from Moses down to the sages, that is, from Moses to the venerated rabbis of the Talmud. Were there any doubts about the authority of the rabbis and their teachings, what has been termed normative Judaism, the link between Moses' revelation at the mountain and what was concurrently revealed to his successors, or, if you prefer, the souls of his successors, should have been ample proof that the living tradition was legitimate. The mirror image of this account is well known and found in various rabbinic sources. Describing the revelation at Sinai, these texts indi- cate that, in addition to the written word, Moses received the Oral Law later propounded by the talmudic sages. In either case, the point is the same, namely, to validate an entire religious tradition and its recipients.69 In this 67. Tanhuma, 1:280. The bracketed words are added from the later version of Exodus Rab- bah 28:6. 68. Deut. 5:19. 69. The earliest formulation of this position central to rabbinic Judaism is perhaps PT Peah 2.6.</page><page sequence="25">MUSLEM TEXTS, JEWISH SUBTEXTS 231 sense, the Tanhuma (and other rabbinic sources) functions for Jews in the same manner as the text of the Strah and the exegesis to the qur'anic verse on the Covenant of the Prophets function for Muslims. As with the previous traditions linking Moses and Muhammad to events of their life-cycles, it is difficult, if not impossible, to claim a direct parallel between Jewish and Arabic sources. The accounts simply do not mesh clean- ly. Still, however vague, the similarities between the Hebrew and Arabic texts compel us to ask whether the commentary of Ibn Islhaq and the qur'an- ic exegetes on sfirah 3:75, writings that validate Muhammad as successor to the ancient monotheistic prophets, could have been informed by the loose- fitting statement of the Midrash Tanhuma, a text validating the authority of the rabbis as successors to Moses, and to the elders and the prophets of ancient Israel. To begin, one must ask whether the Arabic texts were based directly on the Tanhuma or, to be more precise, on some no longer extant traditions upon which the midrash was itself based. As regards the aforementioned passages of the Strah, the evidence of direct cultural borrowing the Jewish sources is so tenuous that one would be well advised not to make any such claim. We can find no basis for maintain- ing that the midrash directly influenced the composition of the Strah and other works giving explanation to Qur'an 3:75. An indirect link based on an unknown common source seems more likely, but in this case such a claim only serves to explain the obscure by the more obscure. However, in discuss- ing cultural influence more widely, proof of deliberate borrowing is not always crucial. The reader's perception that the Muslim text is related in some way to Jewish tradition can itself become a "fact" of importance, and it is this "Jewish reading" of the text that also occupies our concern. It could even be argued that the real question is not whether one could have recalled Jewish sources while reading Ibn Ish.q's account. This would certainly have been possible, if not probable, if one knew these sources. Rather, we are obliged to ask whether readers learned in Judaica might have been familiar with the Qur'an and the Strah. If so, who were they? And related to this question, what meaning would these readers have given to the Arabic texts? What would they have seen as the thrust of the Muslim accounts? There can be no doubt that, as regards the account of the Prophet's mis- sion, Muslims fully understood the anti-Jewish polemic of the Strah and the qur'anic passage around which this polemic was woven. It is nevertheless also apparent that the vast majority of Muslims would not have recognized, let alone understood, much, if anything, of the Jewish themes that might</page><page sequence="26">232 JACOB LASSNER have informed these traditions. One notes, for example, considerable discus- sion among Muslim authorities concerning the age at which the Prophet began his vocation. Suhayli's commentary on the Strah and the extensive footnotes that accompany al-Wakil's edition indicate that the debate was lively. Some scholars held, following the majority opinion of Ibn 'Abbas, that the Prophet's mission began on his fortieth birthday. Others, arguing against this generally accepted view, say that he was several months past forty, or even forty-two or forty-three.70 However, there is no direct refer- ence or even hint in this discussion to any link with Moses and the onset of his sojourn in Midian at the very same age. The subject of Muhammad's birth and death, previously discussed, is also raised here by Suhayli, albeit in a tangential comment concerning Muhammad's prophetic vocation. Again, there is not the slightest recognition of parallel rabbinic traditions concern- ing Moses. As regards the Covenant of the Prophets, Suhayli is even less forthcoming. Given the wide range of qur'anic exegesis available to him, he chooses to focus only on the grammatical issues suggested by 3:75. The medieval commentators are certainly aware of the ideological context of this very difficult verse, namely, its polemical thrust. Whatever difference marks their opinions, they all see Qur'an 3:75 as reflecting the legitimacy of Muhammad and his predecessors among the ancient prophets.71 There is, however, no trace in their extended discussion of a midrashic analogue. They do not cite here comparable stories of Moses or any other Hebrew prophet. If one thinks that the Arabic tradition might have been informed by Jewish sources, a troublesome question comes to mind. How does one ex- plain the failure of very learned Muslims to recognize even the most obvious echoes of a rabbinic subtext? Any reference linking the careers of Moses and Muhammad would surely have strengthened the very case that is in fact the rationale for Ibn Ishtq's account, for it would bring proof that Muhammad ends the authentic chain of prophecy in which Moses was considered a linchpin-a fact suggested ever so clearly by Waraqah b. Nawfal, a man who read scripture and was also familiar with the oral traditions of the People of the Book. Some might be inclined to view the omission of more specific refer- ences to Moses as a case of faded historical memory. Medieval Muslim 70. See above. n. 49. 71. See, for example. Tabari, Jdmi', 3:329 ff.</page><page sequence="27">MUSLEM TEXTS, JEWISH SUBTEXTS 233 chroniclers had occasional difficulties retrieving historical and even philo- logical interpretations. Indeed, this short segment of the Strah contains two glosses explaining terms that confused contemporary readers: the qur'anic iSr, which is glossed with thiqal, meaning "burden," and tahbannuth, a reli- gious observance of pre-Islamic times, which remained elusive despite several glosses and attempts by numerous authorities to explain it.72 However convenient, if not facile, an argument based on faded memory is not likely to convince many readers. For unlike the chroniclers, scholars of the religious sciences were apt to preserve the interpretive efforts of previous generations. One is forced to conclude that if there is in this case a Jewish subtext of any kind, Muslim readers lacking a Jewish background were oblivious to it. What might this absence of knowledge suggest to highly skeptical modern critics? That Muslim texts echo more ancient sources is beyond dis- pute, but in this case (deliberately chosen because it is so ambiguous), there may be scholars who will feel uncomfortable with the suggestion of a "Jewish" reading, let alone the direct borrowing by Muslims from a pre- Islamic source, be it the Midrash Tanhuma or any other rabbinic text. Given elusive accounts and loose-fitting analogues, it can be argued, and with con- siderable vigor, that too much is made here of hypothetical subtexts. Some scholars may indeed wish to argue that this interpretive effort based on a "Jewish" reading of the Strah reflects a tendentiousness that says more about modern authors than medieval texts. To be sure, there is always the possibility of reading too much into very problematic Islamic traditions. Often the ability to see through walls is required when analyzing opaque accounts. There is a danger, nevertheless, that ambitious and overly imagi- native readers will erect dense barriers where none exist in order to penetrate them in search of elegant truths. In sum, the wider interpretation which I have suggested may be forced. And yet, the rabbinic material is so sym- metrical with the structure of Ibn Ishlaq's account that readers knowledge- able in Judaica, medieval as well as modern, no doubt would have seen a subtext whether or not Hebrew and/or Aramaic parallels came to be im- bedded in the Strah and the exegesis to Qur'dn 3:75. Because readers are always partners in creating meaning, it is entirely proper to ask how this text might have spoken to those learned in the Jewish tradition, and related to that, who the likely readers were. 72.

These might have included learned Jewish converts; practicing Jews, directly or indirectly familiar with Muslim texts; perhaps some Christian converts who had some acquaintance with Jewish sources; and the most intriguing possibility of all, learned Jewish converts to Christianity who then converted to Islam, bring- ing with them both a strong knowledge of Jewish sources and elements of an anti-Jewish bias. Perhaps the strongest case for readers knowledgeable in both Jewish and Arabic sources can be made for learned Jews who converted to Islam. For the early converts, the familiar themes that had percolated into the Israd'rlyat, directly through the Qur'in, or indirectly through other sources, must have provided great comfort, especially for new Muslims who had residual sympathies for their former faith and brethren. For these former Jews, there was no need to feel guilt over abandoning the religion of their forefathers. Indeed, in accordance with Muslim thinking, they had reestab- lished the authentic link with the ancient Israelites. True, they gave up an abrogated Mosaic law for God's current (Islamic) legislation, but the very broad outlines of their ancient history were retained along with the venera- tion of its religious personae. Even the Hebrew scripture was regarded by some Muslims as authentic, subject of course to new interpretation. More- over, in many ways the religious institutions of Islam closely paralleled, at least structurally, those of Judaism-more so than was the case regarding Judaism and Christianity or Islam and Christianity. There can be no doubt that Muslims learned much about things Jewish from converts and others knowledgeable in ancient sources. Indeed, medieval Muslims discussed the deep penetration of Jewish scripture and postbiblical accounts in their own venerated tradition. There was a lively and spirited debate that at times encouraged the study of things Jewish, a debate which also involved the Prophet, who was made to say: "Narrate traditions about the Israelites. There is no harm in that."73 One wonders, however, whether Jewish themes may have also informed Muslim writings as part of a quieter enterprise, that is, an internal discourse 73. For an extensive summary of these issues, see M. J. Kister, "'lHadditha 'an bant isrd'ila wa-la Fharaja' A Study of an Early Tradition," Israel Oriental Studies 2 (1972): 215-239.</page><page sequence="29">MUSLEM TEXTS, JEWISH SUBTEXTS 235 among Jewish converts seeking reassurance and comfort in not yet familiar surroundings. For these converts the linking of MuIhammad and Moses with references to rabbinic sources, no matter how oblique, would not have been seen as a formal polemic against their former brethren, but as an attempted bridge between their new religious status and old familial and religious ties. Before pursuing this line of inquiry, a good deal more would have to be known about the social and intellectual dynamics of conversion, particularly during the ascendance of Islam. In any case, were there indeed sustained dis- cussions among early Jewish converts or, beyond that, a learned dialogue between them and their former religious compatriots, the discourse would not have been easily accessible to the larger Muslim community, even when it penetrated the mainstream of Muslim literature. If the Arabic passages previously discussed are a reflection of this sort of dialogue, and that is a sig- nificant if, it would hardly be surprising that the texts were read quite differ- ently by Jews or Jewish converts and by Muslims without Jewish learning. This may explain the references to Moses that are presumed missing in the learned commentary on the Strah. It may also explain the more positively identifiable gleanings from Jewish sources that abound in other Arabic texts but are, nevertheless, undetected or at least not commented upon by Muslim scholars. For most Muslims lacked the requisite linguistic, philological, and cultural background to acquire a working knowledge of most classical Jewish sources at first-hand. As a result, Muslims cited Jewish texts without reading them and made reference to Jewish sources without knowing that they had done so. To be sure, the very same Jewish themes that served the interests of Jewish converts could have bolstered Muslim polemics against those who would not abandon what they considered the true faith of their ancestors. For the inheritors of a proud past who remained Jewish, the message of the Isra'Fllydt was laden with potential danger. Stung by accusations that they had falsified their own holy writ, the spiritual descendants of the ancient Israelites no doubt worried that their denial of Muhammad's prophecy was given wide circulation in Muslim scripture and in the written and oral litera- ture that commented upon it. More specifically, they were likely to have been concerned lest the Isrd'lTyat and more formal treatises of a polemical nature adversely affect intercommunal relations and so disturb the general sense of stability that Jews derived from their protected status under Muslim law. Worse yet, in given circumstances, the Isrda'lryat might induce the fainthearted to abandon their faith in favor of Islam. Although a good deal has been written about polemics and a number of</page><page sequence="30">236 JACOB LASSNER treatises have been preserved, the larger picture of the Jewish response remains blurred.74 The extant documents, few and far between, are marked by a narrow geographical distribution. There is, for example, little if any hard evidence pertaining to the onset of Islamic hegemony in Syria- Palestine and Iraq, the time-honored regions of Jewish settlement in the Fertile Crescent. One thing appears likely, however. In dealing with Mus- lims, Jews would have been inclined to be circumspect. One could argue that, as a rule, Jewish responses to Muslim criticism, however shrill, were not a defense of the faith for the benefit of the hegemonic community, but more likely were intended for internal consumption.75 In any event, the fre- quent use of quotations in Hebrew and the writing of Arabic in Hebrew script must have deflected the impact of the ideological counterthrust when and if non-Jews were inclined to take interest. Given these linguistic con- straints, few, other than Jewish converts, had the capacity to comprehend fully and thus explain thoroughly how Jews reacted to Muslim views. There is no indication that learned Muslim scholars acquired the skills to absorb Jewish texts in the original, nor is there evidence that the Jews were inclined to hang all their linen in public. An exception is Sa'd b. Manfir b. Kammfinah, scientist, philosopher, and a leading pillar of the Jewish community in thirteenth-century Bagh- dad. Writing in Arabic, the author discusses in cool analytical fashion, and in order of their appearance on the stage of world history, Judaism, Chris- tianity, and Islam. Thus the title of his treatise: An Examination into the 74. In many respects, the most convenient point of departure remains the study of Muslim- Jewish polemics by M. Steinschneider: Polemische und apologetische Literatur in arabischer Sprache (Leipzig, 1877). The subject is certainly in need of a new and systematic review. For numerous studies that have appeared since Steinschneider's path-breaking work, see S. W. Baron, A Social and Religious History of the Jews (2nd ed.), 5:82-94, 326-338. See also the more recent summary of M. Perlmann, "The Medieval Polemics Between Islam and Judaism," in Religion in a Religious Age, ed. S. D. Goitein (Cambridge, Mass., 1973). The residual strength of medieval Muslim polemics against the Jews is truly impressive. It is a subject that is similarly in need of a critical study. 75. An exception can perhaps be made for Islamic Spain, where Jewish-Muslim relations were subject to somewhat different conditions. The elevated profile of Spanish Jewry may ex- plain the sharp and sustained Muslim attack on the Jews and Judaism and the Jewish response. For a survey of these developments, see M. Perlmann, "Eleventh-Century Andalusian Authors on the Jews of Granada," Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research 18 (1949): 269 ff.</page><page sequence="31">MUSLEM TEXTS, JEWISH SUBTEXTS 237 Inquiries of Three Faiths (Tanqih al-abhadth li'l-milal al-thaldth).76 In the fourth chapter of this truly remarkable work on comparative religion, Ibn Kammfinah takes on the Muslim claims that Jews (and Christians) had fal- sified their scripture in order to deny the legitimacy of Mu1hammad's pro- phetic vocation. Citing chapter and verse from the Qur'dn, and referring also to learned Muslim tomes and authors, he firmly rejects the Muslim position on tahriffand tabdil, that is, the falsification of sacred texts and their interpretation, an error for which Jews are particularly culpable. As a Jew from Baghdad, he is always respectful, whether he speaks of the Prophet, Islam, or Christianity. Nevertheless, his conclusions are clearly and forth- rightly stated. There is nothing in the revealed scripture of the Jews which foretells the coming of Muhlammad. Hence, the accusations against the author's coreligionists are groundless.76 To have stated this view would hardly have been remarkable. What is different about this work is that it seems intended also for a non-Jewish audience. That is clearly suggested by its tone and structure. One notes also in this respect that of five extant manuscripts, two are written in Arabic rather than Hebrew script. In any case, the TanqTh was not a document destined for Jewish eyes alone. However respectful the tone of Ibn KammCfnah's rejoinder, the frank discussion of Islamic beliefs, while invoking the Qur'an and other Muslim writings, created a stir among the Muslim mobs of Baghdad. The local authorities, religious and civil alike, were pressed to take action. In this instance, the rioting populace demanded no less than death. Reluctant to act, the chief Muslim judicial authority found himself prevented from taking his place at the mosque. The civil administrator of Baghdad, reading quite acurately the mood of his Muslim constituents, promised that Ibn Kam- mufnah would be silenced with death by fire. He had no intention, however, of carrying out the gruesome execution. Instead, he prepared a large leather crate in which he smuggled Ibn Kammfinah out of the city and then de- livered him safe and sound to al-Ijillah, where the learned rabbi's son 76. Sa'd b.

The sharp Muslim response to Ibn Kammfinah, if correctly reported, is particularly instructive; for the Mongol conquerors then ruling Baghdad were Buddhists who had not yet embraced Islam, and minorities continued to constitute a large segment of the city's populace. It was only in the years subsequent to the catastrophic Mongol invasion that the demographic balance in Baghdad reportedly tilted decisively in favor of the true faith. In the wake of the Mongol sack of Baghdad, an event likened by Muslims to Nebuchadnezzar's conquest of Jerusalem, Muslim concerns about the effi- cacy of their faith may have conflicted with the toleration usually shown to Jews.78 In these circumstances, Ibn Kammfinah's spirited and, more particu- larly, public defense of the People of the Book was seen as an affront to Muslim sensibilities and thus occasioned a highly charged response.
