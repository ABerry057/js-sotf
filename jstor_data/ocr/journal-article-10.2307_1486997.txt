<plain_text><page sequence="1">Maurice R. Hayoun. La Philosophie et la Theologie de Moi'se de Narbonne (1300-1362). Tiibingen: J. C. B. Mohr, 1989. xxi, 320 pp. This monograph, the only one of its kind, is the capstone to some twelve years of research devoted to Moses Narboni, the fourteenth century's most ardent and thoroughgoing Jewish Averroist. In approximately 1975, under the tutelage of Georges Vajda, Maurice R. Hayoun directed his attention to a single facet of Narboni's thought, the harmonization of kabbalistic Sephi- rot with philosophic celestial Intelligences. By 1982, Hayoun was envision- ing a full-scale, synthetic study of Narboni's theology and philosophy. The first publication in a series of "texts and studies" leading to that goal was an annotated French translation and Hebrew transcription of the only extant manuscript of Narboni's "Chapter on Free Will" accompanied by relevant extracts from Narboni's first work, the Commentary to Lamentations (Revue des Etudes Juives 141 [1982]: 139-167). The fourth installment in the series</page><page sequence="2">224 BOOK REVIEWS was an annotated French translation and critical Hebrew edition of a crucial passage in Narboni's Commentary to Ibn Tufayl's Hayy ibn Yaqzan. It too was enriched by numerous citations from the manuscripts of Narboni's other writings, especially the Commentary to Al-Ghazali's Intentions of the Philosophers (Jewish Quarterly Review 86 [1985]: 97-147). And in 1986, Hayoun published an annotated French translation and critical Hebrew edi- tion of Narboni's Commentary to Maimonides's Guide for the Perplexed 1:1-50. In all, Hayoun issued no less than ten such "texts and studies" prior to the publication of this monograph, and more are expected in the near future. Four characteristics distinguish all of Hayoun's publications: encyclo- pedic command of Narboni's oeuvre; profound intimacy with the textual monuments of Islamic and Jewish Aristotelianism; mastery of the secon- dary, scholarly literature; and a steady grip on the philosophic issues under discussion. The monograph itself appears to be structured along the plan of (in homage to?) Charles Touati's La Pensee Philosophique et Theologique de Gersonide (1973). There are six major sections and an epilogue. The first part sketches Jewish philosophy and mysticism in fourteenth-century Southern France, provides a brief biography of Narboni, and catalogues Narboni's various commentaries and treatises. The second part focuses thematically on God together with the problem of divine attributes. The third part deals with the question of the world's eternity or creation, and includes a comparison of Narboni's views to those of Maimonides, Albalag, and Gersonides. The fourth part treats the celestial, incorporeal Intelli- gences, including the Agent Intellect, and reviews Narboni's reinterpreta- tion of the Sephirot. The fifth part is given over to the related problems of human psychology, conjunction or union with the Agent Intellect, divine Providence, free will, and political philosophy. The sixth part examines Narboni's self-understanding as a Jew and analyzes the specifically Jewish doctrines and practices related to miracles, Scripture, commandments, and prayer. The epilogue tracks Narboni's place in Jewish history, including Abrabanel's scurrilous attacks, and concludes with the rediscovery of Nar- boni by the Haskalah and in modern scholarship. A bibliography and an index of proper names bring the monograph to a close. Hayoun's comprehensive guide to Narboni's Averroism deserves an honored and accessible place on the shelves of institutional and individual research libraries. Except for some minor editorial suggestions, it is my unqualified pleasure to confess a difficulty in imagining how to improve on</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 225 Hayoun's scholarship. An index to the abundance of passages cited and translated, especially to the works of Maimonides and Averroes, would have made the monograph more efficiently usable, as would have an index of subjects. The inevitable amount of repetition caused by the monograph's structure and the occasional need to consult the earlier "texts and studies" combine to make for a certain unwieldiness. Several of the topics are particularly well documented and instructive: Hayoun cautiously reconstructs Narboni's possible familiarity with the works of Gersonides. He reveals Narboni's long-lasting and complex ambivalence toward the Kabbalah and mystical experience. He traces the subtle shift in Narboni's attitude toward the Guide, at first crediting Mai- monides for secreting Averroistic doctrines behind an enigmatic prose, then blaming him unapologetically for being misled by the errors of Avicenna. At every turn, he exposes the tensions created by Narboni's total immersion in the intellectual world of Islamic Neo-Aristotelianism and his simultaneous, equally total identification with Judaism. Historians of medieval philosophy might profit from Hayoun's sharply etched portrayal of Narboni's skirmish in the age-old conflict between Neoplatonism and Neo-Aristotelianism. Historians might also be stimulat- ed to ponder a question unaddressed explicitly by Hayoun, but whose answer includes the literary and doctrinal data supplied by him: After situat- ing Narboni in the intellectual trends of the Jewish fourteenth century and tracking his peregrinations in Christian France and Spain, what can be said about the social significance of so profound an intellectual commitment to the past glories of Arabic philosophy, both Jewish and Islamic, as mediated through Hebrew translation (pp. 9-15)? Hayoun suggests that Narboni may be viewed as belonging to the dawn of modernity in Jewish life (p. 298). Hayoun's thesis may be persuasive: Narboni's philosophy anticipates some of the contours of modernity as we know it. Averroism tends to relativize religion by viewing it as an historically contingent political structure need- ed by the masses. But what did the heritage of an elitist Aristotelianism produced in the Islamic world mean to Narboni? Hayoun's data also sug- gest that Narboni's radical intellectualism and nostalgia were signs of resis- tance to his own more immediate cultural environment, as well as to the allure of mystical practice and belief.
