<plain_text><page sequence="1">Itzik N. Gottesman. Defining the Yiddish Nation: The Jewish Folklorists ofPoland. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 2003. xxiii, 247 pp. Itzik Gottesman's Defining the Yiddish Nation will be indispensable to any- one interested in the collection of Jewish ethnographic materials. Focusing on the early twentieth century in Poland, Gottesman discusses the underlying ideology, the methodology, and the practice of folklore study. Gottesman traces Jewish folklore studies back to the influence of J. G. Herder and nineteenth-century nationalism. He points out, however, that while the "folk" in other European cultures referred to the peasants, "the Jews had no peas- antry" (p. xiii). Moreover, Yiddishists did not follow the model of building a fu- ture on the distant historical past; for the most part, they were not adherents of Zionism. They had more in common with the "diaspora nationalism" of Shimon Dubnov, in whose view "the Jewish diaspora was the highest stage of development a nation could attain" (p. xvi). Instead of relying on a territorial approach, then, the Yiddish folklorists developed "a language-based nationalism" (p. xvii). Many scholars of Judaic Studies are aware of the ethnographic expeditions by I. L. Peretz (1890) and S. Ansky (1911-14). Gottesman places these well-known instances in their broader cultural context, showing the wide range of work that 403</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews was done by folklorists based in Warsaw and Vilne. He also shows how Peretz's neo-Hasidic tales and folktales-"a turning point in the interest in folklore by the Yiddish intelligentsia" (p. 106)-were part of a larger phenomenon. The three main sections of Defining the Yiddish Nation are devoted to the collectors in Warsaw, the collectors in Vilne, and the rise of the YIVO Ethnographic Commission. The collection of folk songs takes a prominent place, with the War- saw group representing more popular books such as those by Menakhem Kipnis, and the Vilne group developing more sophisticated scholarly methods. Some episodes described by Gottesman make clear how foreign the ethno- graphic enterprise seemed to common people. Once when Shmuel Lehman was collecting, early in World War I, he: heard a twelve-year-old girl sing a Yiddish love ballad and asked her to sing it for him. Since it was dark, she asked him inside a nearby apartment, which was not her home. When the landlady heard such words as "prison," shot," and "bride and groom," she chased them out. The girl led him to her home, in a broken-down building. By the time they arrived, a large crowd of grown-ups and children had gathered to see, "some kind of fool, a nut who has come to write down songs." ... When he finally was able to get up to leave, the whole gang mocked him with song and animal sounds. (p. 26) Lehman admired the "folk" from a distance. In one of the most interesting sections of the book, Gottesman portrays Shmuel Zaynvil Pipe, who was an active YIVO folklore collector in the 1930s. His views are summed up in this passage: "if I don't collect, I feel as if something is missing .... I feel impelled to record. Why should a Yiddish word, or song or a game be lost when it can be saved?" (p. 147). Pipes also raised worthwhile method- ological questions: Does folklore exist only among the lower classes? What makes a folk song "authentic"? This loving account of ethnographers in Eastern Europe is tinged by melan- choly. The section on Pipe, for example, ends: As Pipe prepared to return to Sanok, in August 1939, he wrote [his brother] Oyzer of his plan to marry Nekhame Epshteyn that winter. Only two more let- ters arrived from Pipe via Romania to his brothers in Israel. He was killed in the German extermination camp of Zaslaw, near Sanok, in 1943, at the age of thirty-six. He had an opportunity to escape, but would not leave his parents (p. 157). We are left with a sense of the tragic heroism of men and women who were col- lecting Jewish folklore while their own destruction was imminent.
