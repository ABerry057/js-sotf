<plain_text><page sequence="1">David Hartman. Conflicting Visions: Spiritual Possibilities of Modern Israel. New York: Schocken Books, 1990. xi, 292 pp. Following the dedication page of this highly edifying volume we find a famous talmudic passage: "The tablets and the broken fragments of the tablets were deposited in the Ark" (Berakhot 8b). The modem exegete Arnold Ehrlich, commenting on Moses's act of breaking the tablets, suggests that Moses, seeing the people showering adoration on a concrete image, realized in horror that he, too, was bringing them from on high material objects made of stone. In order to emphasize the immaterial transcendence of God, Moses took it upon himself to smash the tablets. It was, in other words, not an angry reaction to existent idolatry, but rather a calculated prophylactic against future idolatry.' The broken tablets themselves represent, on this view, Israel's eternal vigilance against the ever-present threat of idolatry. It is a struggle which animates much of what David Hartman presents to us in this collection of essays, all of which revolve, in one way or another, about the absolutes in political and religious visions which simultaneously generate vitality and invite degeneration and destruction. Primarily, this volume is the author's response to himself, an account of the discovery of the inconvenient complexities that mar the pristine passion and enthusiasm of the religious visionary. In the introduction, Hartman reminds us of the "dream and the romantic celebration of the unity of the Jewish people" (p. 6) which he felt following the war in 1967. But a "sober and responsible halakhic anthropology" (p. 19) is now the dominant counterpoint to his earlier enthusiasm for the possibility of reencountering God through contact with the Land of Israel. He has come to realize that "dramatic events can be catalysts, but that ultimately Jewish spiritual renewal will be made possible by the way in which we conduct our daily life" (p. 7). In other words, his mentor, the 1. Mikra Kifeshuto, Exod. 32:19.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 257 late Joseph Soloveitchik, whose influence on these writings is ubiquitous, was right. The peaks of extraordinary religious experience are the "diaspora" of Jewish spirituality; they give rise to all the deceptions and abnormalities characteristic of diasporas. The proper homeland of Jewish spirituality is rather the broad plateau of the ordinary. But there is a paradoxical twist to Hartman's now-dampened enthusiasm: ordinary history is available to Jews most fully in the Homeland! Here the plot thickens, for the author's real bate noire is the messianism which he has seen in too many places, and which he now sees as a threat to authentic Jewish religiosity, and perhaps to Jewish survival entirely. It is surely no coincidence that Hartman's earlier book, A Living Covenant (1986), in which he articulated most fully and eloquently his philosophy of Judaism, includes a pivotal chapter entitled "The Celebration of Finitude," and most significantly, bestows virtually no significance at all on the climactic third leg of the Rosenzweigian triad-redemption. Hartman has, over the years, become more and more fearful of what he terms the "resurgence of (biblical) immediacy" (p. 19). That mind-set, which was supposed to have been banished from the Jewish psyche by the triumph long ago of Rabbinic Judaism, has had a resurrection of sorts, and brings with it several threats. Among those are (1) the tendency to expect imminent action from a living God (Hartman believes that this causes both individuals and societies to live as manic-depressives), and (2) the temptation to view the Jewish people as the sole carrier of God's redemptive longing (Hartman notes that this leads inexorably to the denial of the political and cultural aspirations of other peoples). And Hartman's fear accounts for the palpable and pervasive presence in this volume of both Soloveitchik and Yeshayahu Leibowitz. Soloveitchik's "halakhic man," the persona who, as Hartman tells us, emphatically opposed his enthusiasm about Israel's role in the Jewish destiny after the Six-Day War, is an inhabitant of an a priori, not an historical universe. Halakhic man's world is devoid of transcendence because, in an almost Spinozistic sense, it just is, a formal eternal world. Indeed, Soloveitchik compared the space in which halakhic man lives to the a priori spaces of Lobachevskian and Riemannian geometry, allegedly unaffected by history or empirical observations.2 So committed was Soloveitchik to this ahistorical vision of the halakhic realm that he went so far as to interpret "action," in 2.

Hartman strays from his master's universe not, however, because of its circularity, but because of its closure. The late jurisprude Robert Cover wrote that the function of law is to hold off the Messiah, and the a priori realm of halakhic man does hold off the terror of the apocalypse. That is one of its attractions, and Hartman is drawn to it because of his fear of the fiery ends he sees foreshadowed by the forces of messianism surrounding him. But the a priori realm can eclipse other terrors as well, such as the terror of immorality. Soloveitchik never convincingly portrayed how the timeless halakhic man was to recognize the significance and the authority of the cries of the oppressed. Without a reentry into history from the a priori of the academy, Hartman fears that no meaningful address is possible to the injustices done to Jews, or those done by Jews. Yet that very reentry threatens a Jewish Endgame in which both morality and the timeless majesty of talmud torah would matter little. So Hartman broke away from his mentor's world, only to have to face Gershom Scholem's frightening question: "Whether or not Jewish history will be able to endure this entry into the concrete realm without perishing in the crisis of the Messianic claim which has virtually been conjured up-that is the question which out of his great and dangerous past the Jew of this age poses to his present and to his future."4 The commitment to the concrete realm also gives rise to the problem which Hartman has with Yeshayahu Leibowitz, whose colloquy with Hartman constitutes one of the most fascinating and compelling sections of the present book. Hartman is drawn, on the one hand, through his own rejection of biblical immediacy, to Leibowitz's rejection of attaching messianic, or indeed any theological, significance to the Jewish state. The "talmudic postponement of gratification" (p. 19) is more responsible and more authentic. Yet Hartman is repelled by the rejection in Leibowitz of the religious claims of any ethical concerns. One of Leibowitz's proof-texts here serves as a fulcrum for some genuinely interesting philosophic debate in this volume. For Leibowitz claims that when Maimonides, who vastly preferred the eternal, a priori realm of the pure divine essence, accepted the doctrine of creation derived from the plain 3. Ibid., p. 64. 4. Scholem, The Messianic Idea in Judaism (New York, 1971), p. 36.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 259 meaning of the biblical text, he did so solely out of "religious opportunism," i.e., a recognition of the pragmatic value of accepting what was, after all, strictly secondary to the eternal, ahistorical, and amoral essence of God. It is certainly correct that Maimonides was not above attributing certain features of Rabbinic Judaism to pragmatic concession. Yet I sense that Hartman is more correct when he takes Leibowitz to task on this issue, arguing convincingly (though not in precisely these terms) that an eternal necessity unbroken by an act of creation would reflect a self-sufficiency in God which would, in turn, be incompatible not only with creation itself, but also with revelation, and hence halakhah, and hence the human freedom which alone makes halakhah and morality intelligible. The converse is also true: positing a determination of the divine will to create undercuts any notion of complete self-sufficiency in heaven. No doubt that bothered Maimonides. But the idea of covenant is, after all, incompatible with complete self-sufficiency. And that is why Hartman tellingly refutes Leibowitz on this point of Maimonides exegesis when he says, "if the categories of freedom and spontaneity were not applicable to God, then covenantal Judaism would be undermined" (p. 99, emphasis added). As a collection of essays on a wide range of topics, the volume has the inevitable measure of stylistic unevenness and, occasionally, redundancy. On the other hand, there is much of philosophic and religious significance in this volume. Rather than simply complain about the Israeli religious monolith, for example, Hartman actually spells out for us what his vision for religious pluralism is, and what he believes the theological justification for it is. Against the common idea that "the human way to God is confined to the revealed word of God" (pp. 244-245), Hartman argues for an alternative understanding of the biblical theology of revelation: a perspective which grants mutuality an irreducible seriousness, is based on the primary religious value of human autonomy, and takes the religious quest to be not so much a discovery as an invention (taking "invention" in its musical sense as an elaboration of a given theme). Hartman justifies his preferred alternative this way: "Revelation in history is always fragmentary and incomplete. . . . revelation expresses God's willingness to meet human beings in their finitude, in their particular historical and social situation, and to speak to them in their own language" (p. 247). The last phrase just quoted will no doubt recall to many readers the famous aphorism of the second-century Rabbi Yishmael: "The Torah speaks in human language." Well it should. For what we have in Hartman's pressing</page><page sequence="5">260 BOOK REVIEWS his alternative view of biblical revelation is strikingly similar to what Heschel taught us about the ages-old struggle between the vision (associated with Rabbi Akiva) of discovering that which is latent in God's infinite Torah, and the alternate vision (associated with Rabbi Yishmael) of deducing and constructing. The latter elevates finite human reason to the level of partnership with God in creation and revelation. Perhaps that is the key to understanding Hartman's eschatology after all. Redemption also comes through the finite. Hartman in fact argues for the "redemptive significance of celebrating the partial and the incomplete" (p. 260). Human powers may be finite, but they are of irreducible importance in the quest for God's will and for redemption itself. Hartman can sound understandably conflicted and world-weary, but he here adds another passionate, eloquent, and ultimately optimistic voice to the quiet, but determined, Yishmaelian chorus.
