<plain_text><page sequence="1">118 BOOK REVIEWS David Polish. Give Us a King.- Legal-Religious Sources of Jewish Sovereign- ty. Hoboken, N.J.: Ktav, 1990. xix, 180 pp. At the end of Give Us a King, Rabbi David Polish indicates why his research is of moral interest. "Now that power has become Judaized, it pre- sents the Jewish world with inescapable dilemmas" (p. 176). Most specifical- ly, he is intimately concerned with the dangers that he perceives as threaten- ing "a new Judaism established on the principles of the Jewish democratic spirit" (p. 178). Hence, his study is an attempt to describe and analyze the issue of political sovereignty, especially the question of kingship, within the classical rabbinic sources and the exegetical tradition built upon them, a tradition actively extending into our own day. At the outset, he announces that his project is to deal with "the fundamental issue of the nature of Jewish nationhood" (p. x). The purpose of this description and analysis, then, is to uncover precedents for "the Jewish democratic spirit" (p. 176) to which he is so clearly committed. Ultimately, it would seem, he is arguing against the position of Rabbi Meir Kahane (and others less well known) who insist that there is no precedent at all for Western-type democracy in the Jewish tradition. Usually, such treatments are either historical or philosophical, that is, they either carefully examine sources but make no normative case of their own, or they make their own normative case but do not examine the sources, except in a superficial way. Polish's project is thus quite ambitious inasmuch as he attempts to combine both approaches. If successful, such a project would provide the current Jewish world with a true desideratum: a coherent Jewish political theory, one arguable on both philosophical and historical grounds. On historical grounds, there are indeed some strengths in Polish's treat- ment of the subject matter of sovereignty/kingship in this book. He does a good job of outlining the basic options the tradition provides. They turn out to be three. First, there is a decidedly pro-monarchic position, one most prominent- ly advocated by Maimonides in the twelfth century. He attempted to legally constitute the whole institution of Jewish monarch along with the legisla- tive-juridical institution of the Sanhedrin. Second, there is the theocratic position, most cogently argued by Nissim Gerondi in the fourteenth century, which in effect removes Jewish political power from the institution of kingship and places it in the institution of the</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 119 rabbinate. About this position, Polish curtly notes, "Power is thus trans- ferred from one absolutism to another" (p. 159). (Since Polish, as a Reform Zionist leader, has no doubt had to deal with the established rabbinate in Israel, this remark has a special poignancy.) Finally, there is the option of republicanism, advocated by Don Isaac Abravanel in the fifteenth century. Although republicanism (which, for Abravanel, was patterned on the Italian city-states of his time) is not the same thing as democracy, it is still the best premodern precedent for the type of modern constitutional polity that today is called democracy. Abravanel's arguments are important for two reasons. One, he had an impressive command of the classical rabbinic sources and was thus able to use them quite creatively and persuasively. Along these lines, Polish is convincing in arguing against the notion of Leo Strauss that Abravanel's anti-monarchism is atypical of Jewish thinkers. Polish is able to do so because his familiarity with rabbinic sources is far more extensive than that of Strauss. Secondly, Polish mentions "Abravanel's personal experience with monarchy" (p. 121). (Abravanel served three monarchs in three different states at the highest level of government.) The reader is, however, dis- appointed that the point about Abravanel's political experience was not developed further by Polish in the interest of arguing for his having greater political credibility than the advocates of the rival political theories. For unlike them, whose political experience was limited to the rather isolated Jewish community or to peripheral dealings with the host states of their respective Jewish communities, Abravanel's political experience was that of a major figure at the heart of the workings of powerful, fully sovereign states. As such, he provides the most credible model for the issues of Jewish sovereignty that have arisen in our own day. While Polish is insightful in outlining some of the basic options in Jewish political theory, his treatment of them is too sketchy. The scholarly aspect of the book suffers from an incomplete use of both primary and secondary sources, incomplete notes, as well as no index or bibliography. Better proof- reading would have eliminated the many typos. Philosophically, the book is even weaker. Polish is attempting to defend "democratic instruments and the ancient values that have animated them" (p. 177), which he sees as being in jeopardy in both Israel and the Diaspora. However, this requires a philosophical analysis of democracy along with a theological argument as to why "the ancient values," which when Jewish are</page><page sequence="3">120 BOOK REVIEWS inherently religious, can better ground democracy than modern secular ones, which tend to be areligious or antireligious. Without such philosophi- cal analysis and theological argument, Polish's whole position seems to be little more than a proclamation of his liberal Jewish ideology. Along these lines, he and other Jewish political theorists still have much to learn from the more philosophically sophisticated and more theologically cogent thought of such modern Christian defenders of democracy as Jacques Mari- tain, Reinhold Niebuhr, Yves R. Simon, John Courtney Murray, and Jacques Ellul. David Novak University of Virginia Charlottesville, Va.</page></plain_text>
