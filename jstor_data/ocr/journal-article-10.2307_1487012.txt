<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOSEPHUS' INTERPRETATION OF JONAH by LOUIS H. FELDMAN Introduction: Issues That Josephus has relatively little to say about the individual biblical prophets should not be surprising in view of the fact that he is writing a his- tory rather than a treatise on theology or ethics. Nevertheless, it is striking that certain prophets do claim his attention, notably two of the minor prophets, Jonah and Nahum. While there have been several studies dealing with Josephus' views on prophecy and prophets generally,' there have been I should like to express my sincere gratitude to Professor Christopher T. Begg for several helpful suggestions in connection with this essay. 1.

It is not merely that Josephus has drastically compressed the biblical account:3 we must also try to explain why he selects those aspects which he does and why he omits others. Moreover, though Josephus parallels the rabbinic tradition in a number of places, many noted by Rappaport, this does not occur in the Jonah pericope.4 The present study will address the following questions in particular: 1. What is the connection for Josephus between the prophet and the historian? 2. Why is Josephus particularly interested in Jonah when he neglects many of the other prophets? Why does he repeatedly refer to Jonah as a prophet, whereas in the biblical book Jonah is never referred to thus? 3. Why does Josephus reduce the role of God? 4. Why does he avoid indicating that God repented after the city of Nineveh had repented? 5. How does Josephus handle the miracles in the biblical narrative? 6. How does he resolve the dilemma of the universalism of the biblical book as against the implied particularism of Jonah and the Israelites? Why does he avoid indicating that the city of Nineveh repented? Why does he avoid stating that Jonah was displeased with God's repentance? 7. How does Josephus cope with the implication of the Book of Jonah that the sailors became proselytes or "God-fearers"? 8.

Indeed, in the proem to the Jewish War (1.18) Josephus declares that he will begin his work at the point where "the historians of these events [i.e., the biblical history] and our prophets conclude." According to Josephus (Against Apion 1:37), it is because the prophets alone are responsible for the Holy Scriptures that there is no discrepancy in what is written, their accuracy arising from the fact that their knowledge of ancient history was due to the inspiration which they received from God. In this connection, it is striking that Josephus, in his apologetic treatise Against Apion (1:37-43), does not refer to the biblical writings as sacred but rather stresses that they were written by prophets who were inspired. This interest in the prophets must have been heightened by the fact that the historical books of the Bible subsequent to the Penta- teuch are reckoned by Josephus (Against Apion 1:40), as they were by the rabbis, as prophetic books, even though the role of the prophets in several of them, notably Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles, is surely less important than that of the political leaders. Indeed, Josephus goes on to remark (Against Apion 1:41) that the reason why the historical works from the time of Artaxerxes in the mid-fifth century B.C.E. to his own time are less reliable is that they did not have the prophets to attend to them. The prophetic origin of the historical books of the Bible, then, guarantees their accuracy. In the case of Jonah (Antiquities' 9.208) he explains that he has included this account because he has promised to give an exact account of Jewish history (Tilv &amp;Kpiftav 7TV Trpa'yIcTw).6 Likewise, at the end of the pericope, Josephus (A 9.214) emphasizes that he has recorded the narrative accurately, "as I found it written down" (WvaygEypcauApAEl). That a prophet is concerned with recording the past may be seen from the fact that Moses (A 4.320), at the close of his life, "prophesies" to each of 5. Hereafter abbreviated A. 6. We may add that while it is true that Josephus, like the talmudic rabbis, regarded the sages as the true successors to the prophets, there are two prophetic functions which the sages could not and did not claim, namely, the inspiration to write books of Scripture and the author- ity to record history. The latter point will explain why the sages did not attempt to write a single work of history (the Seder Olam Rabbah, ascribed to the Palestinian rabbis Yose ben Halafta of the second century and Johanan of the third century, is merely a chronological compilation rather than an interpretative history) and why, among other reasons, they declined to include the Books of Maccabees in the biblical canon.</page><page sequence="4">4 LOUIS H. FELDMAN the tribes the things that are past ('yEv6gEva), whereupon the multitude, recalling these events, bursts into tears. Moreover, Josephus may well have seen a parallel between the role of the prophet in formulating and trans- lating divine utterances (Plutarch, De Defectu Oraculorum 51.438B), which, for Plato and the Stoics, is a rational technique,7 and the role of the his- torian in formulating and interpreting events into a rational pattern. The kinship of the prophet and the historian may perhaps also be seen in the fact that Josephus (A 1.240), quoting Alexander Polyhistor, refers to the his- torian Cleodemus Maichus as "the prophet."8 Moreover, Josephus (War 3.352-353) looks upon himself as not only learned in the prophecies in the sacred books but also as kind of prophet who is "inspired" (fvOovg) to read their meaning and to whom, indeed, God communicates (War 3.351) in nightly dreams the impending fate of the Jews and the destinies of the Roman sovereigns. In stressing this kinship, then, between prophet and historian, Josephus was, in effect, arguing for his craft as a historian. We may conjecture that Josephus saw a kinship between the prophet and the historian not only in that both deal with the past but also in that both seek to predict the future.9 One is reminded of the famous passage in Thu- cydides (1.22.4), one of Josephus' favorites,'0 that "whoever wishes to have a clear view of events which have happened and of those which will some day, in all human probability, happen again in the same or a similar way" will find his history useful. Thus the historian, like the prophet, functions both as a recorder of the past and as a predicter of the future. If, in his pericope about Daniel, Josephus (A 10.210) declares that he has not thought it proper to relate the meaning of the stone because "I am expected to write of what is past and done and not of what is to be," this is merely a good excuse, because he does not wish to offend his patrons, the Romans, to whose 7.

The Importance of Jonah to Josephus as a Historian As to the Book of Jonah, though it is reckoned among the twelve minor prophets, it is certainly for the Jews the best known of them.'2 Indeed, according to one rabbinic view (Numbers Rabbah 18:2 1), the Book of Jonah is a book by itself and is not to be viewed as part of the book of the twelve minor prophets. This is largely due to the fact that it is read in its entirety as the haftarah on the afternoon of the most sacred day in the Jewish calen- dar, the Day of Atonement." Its uniqueness, moreover, arises from the fact that it alone of the prophetic books deals not with Jews but with a heathen city and its repentance. There are indications in Josephus' introduction of the prophecy of Jonah that he is deliberately introducing a digression. He starts (A 9.208) with an apology, that since he had promised to give an exact account of Jewish history, he deems it necessary to report what is found in the Scriptures con- cerning Jonah. But when we consider how much of the biblical narrative Josephus has omitted in his paraphrase, this seems like a mere pretext for introducing material that he thought important. Moreover, though he promises to recount what he has found written in the Hebrew books (iv rat~ 'E3paLKals f3iP Xois) concerning this prophet, he actually is carefully selec- tive and, indeed, omits most of what is written in the Book of Jonah, includ- ing the main point of the story. The reason, then, for this digression would 11. See Ralph Marcus, ed., Josephus, vol. 6 (London: Heinemann [Loeb Classical Library], 1937), p. 275, note c. 12. At least the story of the big fish that swallowed Jonah was apparently well known even to pagan intellectuals, as we can see from Celsus (ap. Origen, Against Celsus 7:53). 13. It is so designated as the haftarah in the Talmud (Megillah 31a). That the institution of reading selections from the prophets was known in Josephus' time and that it goes back to at least the middle of the first century is clear from the reference in Luke 4:16-17, where we are told that Jesus, on the Sabbath day in the synagogue, was given the book of the prophet Isaiah from which to read. Furthermore, we read in Acts 13:15 that "after the reading of the law and the prophets" Paul was invited to speak in the synagogue. See Adolph Biichler, s.v. "Haf- tarah," Jewish Encyclopaedia (1907), 6:135-136.</page><page sequence="6">6 LOUIS H. FELDMAN appear to be that Jonah's prophecy concerning Nineveh is important for him as an historian. As an historian, Josephus is eager to give the impression of being precise. Thus, the Bible (Jon. 1:3) reports that Jonah found a ship going to Tar- shish, a city whose location is unknown; and one might well wonder whether the city is fictitious and whether the whole story is a mere parable. Not so in Josephus, who unambiguously identifies (A 9.208) the city as Tarsus in Cilicia.'4 Similarly, whereas the Bible (Jon. 2:11) states that the fish vomited out Jonah upon the dry land without indicating where this was, Josephus (A 9.213) is precise in identifying the place as the shore of the Euxine (Black) Sea, though such an identification is nowhere to be found in the rabbinic or any other tradition."5 Such precision gives the historian's narrative an air of reliablity, just as when Josephus (A 1.90) identifies the spot, namely Ar- menia, where Noah's ark landed and even shows further precision in noting (A 1.92) that the Armenians call that spot "Landing-Place" and show the relics there even in Josephus' own day. That, for Josephus, Jonah the prophet is to be viewed against his his- torical background is clear from the fact that he introduces him by citing his political role, as noted in 2 Kings 14:25, in prophesying to King Jeroboam II of Israel that he should make war on the Syrians and thus extend the borders of his kingdom, whereas most scholars agree that the protagonist of the Book of Jonah has only the loosest connection with the historical Jonah. It is a similar political role which is indicated by Josephus (A 9.208) when he declares that Jonah is instructed by God to preach in Nineveh that it would lose its power (&amp;pxiqv). Moreover, it is significant that whereas in the Book of Jonah there is not a single explicit reference to Jonah as a prophet, in Josephus, within a mere nine short paragraphs (A 9.206-214), Jonah is on four occasions referred to as a prophet or as prophesying, even though in the biblical book Jonah 14. Cf. Josephus, A 1.127, who, paraphrasing the Table of Nations found in Genesis, chapter 10, comments on the verse that gives the name of one of Japheth's sons as Tarshish (Gen. 10:4). Josephus there declares that Tarshish was the ancient name of Cilicia, as is proven by the fact that its principal and capital city was called Tarsus. It is perhaps tempting to see a connection between this identification of Tarshish as Tarsus and the fact that a contemporary of Josephus, the apostle Paul, was, like Jonah, involved in a shipwreck; but Josephus nowhere mentions Paul or his mission; and if the passage were interpolated by a Christian one would have expected a more precise reference to Paul as well as to the gospel which he preached. 15. This identification apparently results from Josephus' assumption that the Euxine (Black) Sea is the nearest sea to Nineveh. So Marcus, Josephus, p. 113, note c.</page><page sequence="7">JOSEPHUS' INTERPRETATION OF JONAH 7 presents only a single prophecy (3:4) and in only five words, the rest of the book being a story about Jonah.'6 To be sure, Josephus does have a biblical warrant for his designation, that is, the use of the term "prophet" of Jonah in 2 Kings 14:25. But Josephus has converted the narrative of the Book of Jonah into an account dealing with the profession of the prophet, whom he regards as the twin brother, so to speak, of the historian. To him the narra- tive is not a midrashic legend"' but a page of history. Josephus is careful, however, to avoid any hint of nationalism in his portrayal of Jonah. Hence, whereas in the biblical passage (Jon. 1:9) Jonah tells the sailors on board the ship "I am a Hebrew," in Josephus (A 9.211) Jonah says that he is a Hebrew by race (Tr ... -ybvo), the same expression that Josephus uses about himself (War 1:3), where the word y-vog refers not necessarily to nation but to origin or group or family in the etymological and broadest sense.'8 We may also suggest that it was similarly his desire to avoid any semb- lance of nationalism that may have led Josephus to avoid mention of the widespread tradition (cf. Midrash Tehillim 26:220) that Jonah was the son of 16. It is true that the Book of Jonah begins in a manner similar to that of several others of the minor prophets-Hosea, Joel, Micah, Zephaniah, Malachi-namely, "The word of the Lord [that] came to ... ," without mention of the word "prophet." It is clear in Jonah's case, as in that of the other prophets, that he is a prophet; his mission which he tries to flee is nothing if not prophetic, and the whole paradox of Jonah is that he is a prophet whose act of prophesying leads to a falsification of the prophecy, so that readers of the Book of Jonah in Hebrew were not particularly sensitive about the absence of the word "prophet" in the narrative. Yet, the signifi- cant point is that Josephus keeps emphasizing that he is a prophet, for the reason which we have suggested, namely, that he regards the prophet as the twin brother of the historian. 17. This is the classification given to the biblical narrative by Phyllis Lou Trible, "Studies in the Book of Jonah" (Ph.D. diss., Columbia University, 1967). 18. Cf. War 1.78: Judas was of Essene extraction ('Eaaafos g v yrvos), where the reference cannot be to a nation since the Essenes did not constitute a nation. Similarly, elsewhere with regard to the Essenes (War 2.113, 2.119; 13.3 11, 17.346). That the word yivos does not imply a nation is clear from the passage (War 2.308) in which we are told that the procurator Florus scourged and nailed to the cross men of equestrian rank who were Jews by birth (T6 yivos 'Iovoda0ov), where clearly neither Josephus nor Florus would grant that these equestrians were members of a Jewish nation. That the word yivos does not necessarily mean a nation in the political sense is clear from Josephus' statement (War 7.43) that the Jewish people (T6 ytp 'lov6aiwv yivos) are densely interspersed among the native populations of every portion of the world. Other instances where the word yivos cannot refer to a political entity are 2.78, referring to Joseph's rank by birth (yivovs); 2.179, referring to Leah's progeny (yCvos); and 2.216, refer- ring to the people (yivos) who will be delivered by Moses, in all of which cases the Jewish nation has obviously not yet been constituted; likewise in A 7.117 and 296 it refers not to the nation but to the family (yivous) of Saul, and in 8.232 and 270, where it refers to the family (yfvovs) of David.</page><page sequence="8">8 LOUIS H. FELDMAN the widow of Zarephath resuscitated by the prophet Elijah, who is said to be the Messiah of the tribe of Joseph.19 Similarly, we may note, Josephus avoids any allusion to David as the ancestor of the Messiah,20 since such a reference might well have been considered by the Romans as encouraging revolt, inasmuch as the Messiah was generally regarded as a political leader who would reestablish an independent Jewish state. Ironically, perhaps, Josephus, though dealing with a prophet, ignores the religious side of Jonah's conduct and mission and restricts himself to Jonah's political mission.2' We may here suggest that Josephus perhaps introduced the digression about Jonah in order to give him an opportunity to predict the overthrow of Assyria, which is located in precisely the area where the kingdom of Parthia, the great enemy of the Romans, was situated. Josephus, who depicts himself as a veritable prophet (War 3:351-353) and as a faithful lackey of the Romans, would have rejoiced at such a prospect. The Role of God in Josephus' Treatment of Jonah In the proem to the Antiquities Josephus (A 1:14) states that the main lesson to be derived from a study of his history is that God rewards those who obey His laws and punishes those who do not.22 And yet, as I have 19. Cf. Seder Eliyahu Rabbah 18.97-98; Jerome, introduction to Commentary on Jonah, who connects the name of Jonah's father, Amittai, with the word emet ("truth") in the state- ment of the widow of Zarephath to Elijah, "Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth." 20. Josephus (A 7.94) is content to say that David's house will be glorious and renowned. Whereas in the biblical text (2 Sam. 7:13, 1 Chron. 17:12), the prophet Nathan assures David that God will establish the throne of his kingdom forever, Josephus (7.94) says merely that David rejoiced greatly to know that the royal power would remain with his descendants, with no indication that this would be so forever. In contrast, Josephus' presumed contemporary Pseudo-Philo (Biblical Antiquities 59.2) remarks that the prophet Samuel, mistakenly thinking that Eliab, the oldest son of Jesse, was the one to be anointed king, declared, "Behold, the holy one, the anointed of the Lord [sanctus christus = meshiahl ha-qadosh]," clearly alluding to him as messiah, "anointed," whereas Josephus avoids the word Xpttrr6a. The rabbis likewise por- tray David, in the days to come (Sanhedrin 98b), as the viceroy of the Messiah, who also will be named David. 21. The point is made but not developed by Duval, Livre de Jonas, pp. 82-86. 22. Begg, "The 'Classical Prophets,"' p. 347, correctly notes that Josephus' version of the Jonah story lacks much of the theological depth and satiric bite of the original, but he does not develop the point further.</page><page sequence="9">JOSEPHUS' INTERPRETATION OF JONAH 9 noted elsewhere,23 Josephus has over and over again reduced the role of God in his paraphrase of the Bible, most notably in the cases of Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, and, above all, Ruth. Where he does not deemphasize the role of God, particularly in the case of Moses, it is because the Greeks believed that great leaders, such as Lycurgus, had to be divinely directed. Josephus knew that Moses, who was regarded by the pagans as the greatest Jewish leader and indeed the founder of the Jewish polity,24 would be compared with other lawgivers and formulators of constitutions actual or ideal; hence, he emphasizes that Moses was directed by God's providence. It is not that Josephus is uninterested in theology; indeed, he declares on several occa- sions (A 1.25, 1.192, 3.94, 3.243. 4.198, 20. 268) that he intends to deal with such matters as the reasons for the commandments and the Jewish belief concerning God and His essence in a separate work On Customs and Causes; and he is even precise in stating (A 20.268) that this work will consist of four books. But it is clear that Josephus regarded his history as an inappropriate place for a discussion of such matters, at least at any length. One might say that God Himself is the real hero of the biblical Book of Jonah and that the heart of the story is that, as Jonah admits in his prayer (Jon. 4:2), God is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love. This love, we may remark, extends both to non-Jews, that is, the people of Nineveh, and to the recalcitrant prophet Jonah. But Josephus is writing a history of men, not of God, and this detheologizing is evident in Josephus' paraphrase of the Book of Jonah. Thus, for example, at almost the very beginning of the narrative, the biblical account (Jon. 1:4) states that the Lord hured a great wind upon the sea; and the question naturally arises whether, if the storm was due solely to the presence of Jonah, other ships were able to avoid the storm.25 The rabbinic tradition (Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer 10), not reduced to writing until perhaps the eighth century, to be sure, has preserved an answer to this problem, namely that the story affected only the ship in which Jonah was aboard. But Josephus avoids the difficulty 23. Louis H.

FELDMAN altogether by omitting God from the equation and simply stating (A 9.209) that "a very severe storm came up." Again, in the biblical narrative, when the storm has overwhelmed the ship carrying Jonah and the sailors cry to their respective deities, the captain (Jon. 1:6) urges Jonah to call upon his God, in the desperate hope that per- haps his God will have pity on them. In Josephus' version (A 9.209), however, there is no such encounter; and hence, again, God is omitted from the picture. It is only after the lots have been drawn that we hear (A 9.211) that the sailors ask Jonah who he is; and he replies by declaring that he is a Hebrew by race and that he is a prophet of God. Even here, whereas the bib- lical book states that Jonah identifies himself as one who fears the Lord, the God of heaven, creator of sea and land, in Josephus (A 9.211) Jonah states merely that he is a prophet of the Most High God, with no explicit indica- tion, implied though it may be, that he is a God-fearing person or that God is the creator of land and sea. Likewise, in the biblical narrative (Jon. 1:10) we read that the sailors accuse Jonah: "What is this that you have done?" The matter is a theologi- cal issue, since we are informed that they have had a previous conversation in which he had told them that he was fleeing from the presence of God. In Josephus, on the other hand, there is no previous conversation, no indica- tion that the sailors have any knowledge of why Jonah is on board the ship, and no mention at all of God's role. Moreover, again the role of God is reduced, inasmuch as Josephus total- ly omits (A 9.214) the biblical statement (Jon. 3:1-2) that the Lord came to Jonah a second time, ordering him to go to Nineveh and proclaim the mes- sage that He will tell him. Instead, we read (A 9:214) that Jonah, having prayed to God to grant him forgiveness for his sins, went to Nineveh, with- out any explicit indication that it was God who ordered him to go there. Furthermore, there is no indication that the message that he proclaims, that Nineveh will soon lose its dominance over Asia, has been dictated by God. In addition, the problem of how and why God repented from punishing Nineveh (Jon. 3:10) is resolved by Josephus by the simple device of omitting God's repentance. And finally, the biblical book ends with God teaching Jonah an object lesson in commiseration for the inhabitants of Nineveh, and we are told nothing of what happens to Jonah, whereas God plays no role in the ending of Josephus' version. Instead, we are told that after delivering his message to the people of Nineveh, Jonah departed, presumably to his native city.</page><page sequence="11">JOSEPHUS' INTERPRETATION OF JONAH 1 1 The climax of the teaching in the Hebrew version is the lesson of the kikayon (Jon. 4:6-11). In the Hebrew version it is God who brings forth the kikayon (Jon. 4:6) and it is God who brings forth a worm to attack the ki- kayon and destroy it (Jon. 4:7), and it is God who brings forth a sultry east wind to beat upon Jonah so that he becomes so faint that he seeks to die (Jon. 4:8). It is all clearly a theological lesson and, in effect, is based on a fortiori reasoning: if Jonah found a mere plant, which was only a day old, too important to be destroyed, how should God not have pity on a huge city, which had existed for so long? Still another factor was instrumental in Nineveh's survival, namely, the degree of its repentance. One might say that God is trying to teach Jonah a cosmic lesson, namely, that the existence of a city such as Nineveh is as important for the scheme of creation as is that of a single kikayon. Josephus, however, has omitted the incident with the kika- yon altogether; and there is consequently no place for divine reasoning or for a moral to be drawn. The Problem of God's Repentance and the Truth of Jonah's Prophecy If we compare the Book of Jonah with Josephus' version26 we shall note that Josephus has omitted the passage (Jon. 4:1) which indicates that Jonah was exceedingly displeased that God had repented of the punishment which He had promised to inflict upon the people of Nineveh. In the biblical ver- sion we are told that Jonah was actually angry, presumably because God's action was completely contrary to what Jonah had been told to prophesy. Now, a key to prophecy in the sense of prediction is that it comes true. Thus, in an extrabiblical editorial (A 8.418), Josephus stresses that inasmuch as the prophecies spoken by Elijah and Micaiah came true, we ought to acknow- ledge the greatness of God and should not think that statements that flatter us are more worthy of belief than the truth, "but should acknowledge that nothing is more beneficial than prophecy and the foreknowledge which it 26. That Josephus knew the Hebrew text of Jonah is evident from the fact that he renders it literally in the passage where Jonah says that he is a Hebrew (1:9), whereas the Septuagint reads oOAXos Kvpiov, presumably based upon a Hebrew text that read 'eved y rather than 'ivri, where the letter resh was replaced by a daled. On the question of which text of the Bible-Hebrew, Septuagint, Targum, etc.-Josephus employed, see my "Use, Authority and Exegesis of Mikra in the Writings of Josephus," pp. 455-466.</page><page sequence="12">12 LOUIS H. FELDMAN gives." Similarly, though he does not mention the majority of the twelve minor prophets at all, he goes out of his way to present at length the pro- phecies of Nahum (A 9.239-242) in order to stress his conclusion (A 9.242) that everything that Nahum foretold concerning Nineveh actually came to pass after 115 years. Furthermore, the quality of Isaiah which Josephus singles out (A 10:35), in a kind of editorial about him, is that he was mar- velously possessed of truth and was confident of never having spoken false- ly. Indeed, the key to this aspect of prophecy is to be found in Josephus' editorializing (A 10.269) about Daniel, namely, that he (Daniel) made plain the accuracy and faithfulness to truth of his prophecies. This attribute of truthful prophecy, adds Josephus, is to be found not only in Isaiah but also in the twelve other prophets as well,2 including, of course, Jonah. Hence, we can understand why Josephus omitted God's repentance, since this could have been interpreted as an indication that Jonah's initial prophecy about Nineveh turned out to be actually false. Indeed, according to the rabbinic tradition (Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer 10, Tanhuma Vayikra 8, Midrash Jonah 96), Jonah had already gained a reputation among the Israel- ites as a false prophet, inasmuch as, because the inhabitants of Jerusalem had repented and because God had had mercy upon them, his prophecy that Jerusalem would be destroyed had not come to pass. Therefore, when he was sent to Nineveh to prophesy the downfall of the city, Jonah reflected that he would confirm his reputation of being a false prophet, inasmuch as he knew that the Ninevites would repent and therefore that the threatened punishment would not be executed. Consequently, Josephus protects him- self against the possible charge that he has misrepresented the Book of Jonah in that the biblical book has Jonah's prediction (Jon. 3:4) that Nine- veh would be overthrown within forty days (the Septuagint makes Josephus' case all the harder by reading three in place of forty). In Josephus (A 9:214) we have the carefully worded statement that Nineveh would be overthrown within "a very short time" (,urT' dXiyov 7racvv Xpdvov). By not being specific Jonah is protected against the charge that he is a false prophet. This will also help to explain why Josephus repeatedly, as we have noted, calls Jonah a prophet, namely, to counteract any doubts readers might have had-given the problem of Jonah's unfulfilled prediction-concerning Jonah's status. In this connection, we may note that Josephus' juxtaposition of the notice of 27. Presumably the reference is to the twelve prophetic books mentioned in Against Apion 1.40.</page><page sequence="13">JOSEPHUS' INTERPRETATION OF JONAH 13 Jonah's prediction of Jeroboam's successes and its fulfillment (A 9.206-207) with his version of the Book of Jonah is likewise intended to promote a view of Jonah as a true prophet, since the fulfillment of his Syrian prophecy induces the expectation that his prophecy concerning Nineveh will likewise be realized. To be sure, we may note that at the conclusion of his retelling of the Book of Jonah Josephus does not state that his word against Nineveh was realized. That it will be so, however, is effectively intimated by the "ful- fillment notice" on his earlier prediction to Jeroboam. Moreover, there is no possibility that a true prophet will be contradicted by another prophet. Thus Zedekiah, one of the false prophets, in attempting to undermine the authority of the prophets, declares (A 8.408), in an extra- bibilical detail, that Micaiah is lying, inasmuch as he apparently contradicts another prophet, Elijah, in stating that within three days King Ahab would meet his death. Similarly, in an addition to the biblical text, Josephus (A 10. 106-107) says that King Zedekiah disbelieved the prophecies of Jeremiah and Ezekiel inasmuch as they apparently contradicted one another, the first stating that the king would be taken captive by the Babylonians, and the lat- ter declaring that he would not see Babylon; nevertheless, as Josephus (A 10.241) remarks, both prophecies came true-the sine qua non of prophecy-since Zedekiah was blinded and was thus taken to Babylon. In the case of Jonah, Josephus (A 9.239-242) was aware that the entire Book of Nahum consisted of a prophecy of the overthrow of Nineveh. This would seem to contradict the fact that in the Book of Jonah the city of Nine- veh is spared by God because of the repentance of its people, though, of course, one might reconcile the two books by postulating that the people of Nineveh had repented at the time of Jonah's prophecy but that they later reverted to their evil ways and therefore became doomed once more. To the unwary reader, however, the two books would seem to be in contradiction to one another; and hence, we can understand why Josephus omits God's repentance and leaves us (A 9.214) with Jonah's renewed prophecy that Nineveh would lose its dominion over Asia. Indeed, Josephus' presumed contemporary, Pseudo-Philo, in his Homily on Jonah (6, 41, 48), obviously disturbed that Jonah should have fled from his mission, notes (6) that Jonah knows, by prophetic clairvoyance, that the city of Nineveh will be saved and attempts to justify his action by arguing that, being a prophet, he knew beforehand that his threats against Nineveh would not be fulfilled and that he would consequently be discredited as a false prophet. Likewise, in the scenario as presented by the rabbis (Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer 10, Tanhuma</page><page sequence="14">14 LOUIS H. FELDMAN Vayikra 9, Midrash Jonah 96). Jonah explains his anger by noting that now that his prophetic message had failed to materialize, the nations of the world would claim that he was a false prophet and, indeed, would discredit the whole institution of prophecy, thus bringing about the profanation of the name of God. Josephus might easily, then, have resolved the problem of the apparent contradiction between Jonah and Nahum or the apparent embar- rassment which would seem to be occasioned by the nonfulfillment of Jonah's prophecy by simply omitting the prophecies of Jonah and of Nahum, as he did so many other prophecies in the Bible.28 Josephus' Handling of the Miracles in the Book If, indeed, as we have indicated, Josephus was addressing a non-Jewish literate audience, perhaps the most difficult task confronting him was what to do with the various miracles in the book-the swallowing of Jonah by the big fish, Jonah's prayer from within the big fish, the episode of Jonah emerg- ing from the big fish, the conversion of the whole city of Nineveh, the plant that grew within one night, the destruction of the plant on the next day by a single worm, and the huge dimensions of Nineveh. On the whole, Josephus tends to downgrade miracles,29 as we see especially when we compare, for example, his view of Abraham and Moses as talented generals with the rab- binic portraits of these leaders as prevailing because of God's miraculous assistance. Josephus frequently (for example, A 1.108, 3.81, 4.158, 10.281) employs the time-honored formula, found not merely in Dionysius of Hali- carnassus (Roman Antiquities 1.48.1, 1.48.4, 2.40.3, 2.74.5, 3.36.5), Lucian (How to Write History 10), and Pliny (Natural History 9:18), but also earlier in Herodotus (2.123, 5.45) and Thucydides (6.2.1), allowing the reader to make up his mind, which, as Delling and McRae have remarked, is an 28. Begg, "The 'Classical Prophets,"' p. 348, says that Josephus' inclusion of Nahum's prophecy gave him an opportunity to confirm and reinforce the announcement about Nine- veh's overthrow. But the question still remains why Josephus should have wanted to emphasize Nineveh's overthrow instead of the point made by the Book of Jonah itself, namely the power of repentance. 29. See my critical bibliography on the subject in Josephus and Modern Scholarship (Berlin: de Gruyter, 1984), pp. 477-480.

Origen, Against Celsus 7:53), as we have noted, sarcastically declares that Christians should worship not Jesus but Jonah or Daniel, whose miracles outdo the resurrec- tion. Even three centuries later, to judge from Augustine (Epistulae 102.30), who quotes Porphyry's lost work Adversus Christianos, this incident was a source of ridicule among the pagans in general. Josephus might have omit- ted the story as being incredible (as he did the other miraculous events enumerated above), or he might have left it to the reader to decide, or he might have modified it to conform with the somewhat similar stories told about Heracles and Hermione and Perseus and Andromache, where the fish is maimed by the hero; but Josephus chose not to depart from the biblical version, perhaps because it was so well known, while dissociating himself from necessarily believing it. He does so by the device of stating that the story (0Adyo) has it that Jonah was swallowed by a huge fish, just as in a somewhat similar story, that of Arion, who was rescued by a dolphin, Herodotus (1:24) declares, without taking responsibility for the tale, that "they say" (X'yovut) that the dolphin took him on his back. Moreover, whereas the biblical narrative (Jon. 2:1-9) has Jonah miraculously address God while he is still in the big fish, Josephus has eliminated the miraculous element by having him do so after he has emerged from the fish. Further- more, in the Bible (Jon. 2:1-2) Jonah, praying from the belly of the fish, declares that God has answered him (Jon. 2:7), whereas it is clear that the deliverance has not yet taken place. The Septuagint version corrects this by having the optative, "May my prayer come to Thee." The Targum resolves the problem by referring the rescue to the future: "And it is revealed before You to raise my life from destruction." Josephus neatly resolves the matter by having Jonah pray (A 9.214) after emerging from the belly of the fish.3' 30.Gerhard Delling, "Josephus und das Wunderbare," Novum Testamentum 2 (1957-58): 291-309; George W.

So also Pseudo-Philo, Homily on Jonah 19-25, replaces the prayer with a more appro- priate supplication.

FELDMAN Furthermore, in the Hebrew version (Jon. 2:10) we read that the Lord spoke to the fish that had swallowed Jonah and that it vomited Jonah upon the dry land. Josephus (A 9.213), obviously sensitive to the charge of credu- lity, says nothing about God's action in speaking to the fish and instead resorts to the passive voice with the statement that after three days and as many nights Jonah was cast up on the shore of the Black Sea. Jew and Non-Jew. The Universalism of the Book of Jonah vs. the Particularism of Jonah and the Israelites One of the most vicious and most frequently recurring charges against Jews in pagan literature, as stated, for example, by Josephus' contemporary Tacitus (Histories 5:5.1), is that while Jews are extremely loyal to one another and ready to show compassion to their fellow-Jews, they feel only hate toward every other people. Another of Josephus' contemporaries, Juvenal (Satires 14.103-104), goes so far as to attack the Jews for not show- ing the way or a fountain spring to any but fellow-Jews. It is this mis- anthropy which is the source of the canard that the Jews annually slaught- ered a Greek, while swearing an oath of hostility to the Greeks (Apion, ap. Josephus, Against Apion 2.91-96; cf. Damocritus, ap. Suidas, s.v. AcaAd- KpLTro). Even Hecataeus (ca. 300 B.C.E.) (ap. Diodorus 40.3.4), who is other- wise well disposed toward the Jews, describes the Jewish way of life as "somewhat unsocial" (&amp;drdvOpwr6v Ttva) and hostile to foreigners (toa6WE- vov).32 Throughout the first half of the Antiquities, where he parallels the Bible, Josephus frequently modifies the narrative in order to answer these charges.33 In the Jonah pericope Josephus found himself in a dilemma. On the one hand, the biblical account stresses the universalistic attitude of Judaism in in the fish but from the fish and hence deduced that he prayed after he had emerged from the fish. 32.

See Feldman, "Use, Authority and Exegesis of Mikra," pp. 494-496.</page><page sequence="17">JOSEPHUS' INTERPRETATION OF JONAH 17 that God's mercy encompasses not only Israel but also the Gentiles;34 and this seems to be an effective answer to the charges of misanthropy noted above. Indeed, the fact that God shows mercy toward the people of Nine- veh, the very Assyrians who had been the bitterest enemies of the Israelites and had been responsible for the destruction of the Kingdom of Israel and the loss of ten of the twelve tribes of Israel, is a dramatic answer to these charges. This is reinforced by the fact that Nineveh is on three occasions in the biblical Book of Jonah termed a great city. And yet, the biblical narra- tive seems to reinforce the charge of misanthropy in that Jonah is angry with God for showing mercy toward the people of Nineveh; but, on the other hand, the Jews are cast in a relatively bad light in that it is the people of Nineveh who repent so sincerely. If Josephus were to praise the people of Nineveh this would show his broadmindedness; but if he were to do so, it might reflect badly, by comparison, on his fellow-Jews, who had not heeded the admonitions of the prophets.35 Indeed, such an unfavorable comparison is already to be found in the Gospels according to Matthew (12:41) and Luke (11:32); and it is just possible that Josephus was aware of this use made by the Christians of the story of Jonah and may have attempted to respond to it by, in effect, not praising the Ninevites.36 In this respect we may suggest 34. Duval, Livre de Jonas, p. 77, is astonished that Philo, whose universalism is not in doubt, never refers to the story of Jonah; but we may remark that it is only with relative rare- ness that Philo refers to books of the Bible other than the Pentateuch. In particular, he mentions only two of the twelve minor prophets and those in only three places (Hosea: De Plantatione 138, De Mutatione Nominum 139; and Zechariah: De Confusione Linguarum 62). 35. This is actually the view expressed in the Midrash on Lamentations, introduction, no. 31: "I sent one prophet to Nineveh, and he brought it to penitence and conversion. And these Israelites in Jerusalem-how many prophets have I sent to them!" 36. Etan Levine, The Aramaic Version of Jonah (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Academic Press, 1975), p. 14, remarks that several early Church Fathers (e.g., Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho 107; Jerome, Ad Jonas 1.3 and 4.1) used the motif of the Ninevites' sincere repentance in their anti-Jewish polemics to contrast it with the stubbornness of the Jews. We may also sug- gest that Josephus' omission of Jonah's statement that "It is better for me to die than to live" (Jon. 4:8) may be a response to Christian exegesis, which cited this verse with reference to the Christian view that death was better for Jesus than life, since while alive he could save only one nation but with his death he saved the whole world. See Robert H. Bowers, The Legend of Jonah (The Hague: Nijhoff, 1971), pp. 58-59, and Levine, Aramaic Version ofJonah, p. 14, who notes that the Targum has, by subtle paraphrase, altered the "proof-text" in Jonah through rendering it as: "It is better that I die than that I live." Cf. also Andre Paul, "Flavius Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews: An Anti-Christian Manifesto," New Testament Studies 31 (1985): 473-480, who suggests that Josephus' substitution (A 1.103) of the word iraOav ("truce") for</page><page sequence="18">18 LOUIS H. FELDMAN that Josephus is parallel to the Targum of Jonah (3:5), which counters the Christian claim wherein religious conversion and faith are at issue by stress- ing that the Ninevites believe in the message brought by Jonah rather than in God.37 We may also note that the rabbis, clearly seeking to protect the reputation of the Jews, have a tradition (Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer 10, Tanhuma Vayikra 8, Midrash Jonah 96) that the reason why Jonah boarded the ship was that he hoped that he would lose his life on the voyage and thus be spared the pain of seeing the heathen repent while the Jews failed to do so.3 The rabbinic tradition (Mishnah Sanhedrin 11:5) is well aware that a prophet who holds back his prophecy (as Jonah apparently did, according to the biblical version) is subject to the death penalty at the hands of Heaven. The rabbis, too, were confronted with the dilemma of the book's universalism as against the implied particularism of Jonah and the Israelites; and they note ( Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer 10, Tanhuma Vayikra 8, Midrash Jonah 96) that God conferred honor upon the inhabitants of Nineveh by sending the prophet to them-a distinction never before granted to the nations of the world.39 They explain the forgiveness granted by God to the the word berith (Gen. 9:9, Septuagint 6btaOKTV) is due to his desire to dissociate himself from the New Testament's emphasis on the doctrine of the "new covenant." But, as I have noted elsewhere ("The Portrait of Noah in Josephus, Philo, Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquities, and Rabbinic Midrashim," Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research 55 [ 1988]: 56, n. 30), if, indeed, Josephus is writing an anti-Christian manifesto, we would have expected him to be more open about it, since he had nothing to fear from the Christians at the time that he wrote the Antiquities, inasmuch as they were few in number and were hardly held in favor by the Emperor Domitian, during whose reign Josephus issued his work. Moreover, the fact that Josephus (A 20.198-200) is so highly laudatory of James the brother of Jesus (a passage whose authenticity has seldom been questioned) is not consistent with the view that he was carrying on a polemic against Christianity. 37. See Levine, Aramaic Version of Jonah, p. 13. On the other hand, whereas in the Hebrew text (1:9) and Josephus (A 9:211) Jonah identifies himself as a Hebrew, as do the Christian Church Fathers, the Targum identifies him as a Jew, the difference being important in polemics between Jews and Christians. 38.

Furthermore, there was a rabbinic tradition (Gittin 57b) that the sons of Sennacherib, the famous king of Assyria who unsuccessfully besieged Jerusalem (2 Kings 19:35), marched to Jerusalem, where they became proselytes, eventually becoming the ancestors of the famous scholars Shemaiah and Avtalyon of the first century B.C.E. (Gittin 57b, Sanhedrin 96b, Targum 2 Kings 19:35, 37). As to Nineveh, the rabbinic tradition paints in lurid colors the wicked- ness of the inhabitants, so that it emerges as a second Sodom.40 Indeed, Cyril of Alexandria (Patrologia Graeca 71,601), after asking why Jonah had been sent to faraway Nineveh rather than to Tyre or to some other heathen city, explains that this was because Nineveh was a veritable Sodom. Hence, it is most striking that the rabbis have traditions-though, admittedly, we do not know how ancient-indicating the tremendous degree of sincerity of the Ninevites in their repentance.41 But the rabbis were also concerned to protect the reputation of Jonah, who, after all, is part of the canon of the prophets; and they therefore ex- plain his refusal to go to Nineveh as due to his love of Israel, since he knew that the Ninevites would repent of their evil deeds and that this repentance, in turn, would lead God to compare the Israelites, who had not heeded the warnings of the prophets, unfavorably with them.42 Similarly, Pseudo-Philo (Homily on Jonah 6) indicates that Jonah knew by prophetic clairvoyance that the city of Nineveh would be saved. Inasmuch as the Shekhinah does 40. See the discussion by Bickerman, Four Strange Books, pp. 32-33. 41. We are told that the angel Gabriel installed Pharaoh as king of the great city of Nine- veh, and that it was Pharaoh who, seized by fear and terror, covered himself with sackcloth and published the decree that men and beasts should fast. The inhabitants of Nineveh are said to have become "God-fearers," and some are reported to have gone so far as to destroy their palaces in order to return a single brick to the rightful owner. Some, of their own accord, appeared before courts of justice in order to confess their secret crimes even though these crimes were subject to a death penalty. One case mentions a man who, in a building lot which he acquired from his neighbor, found a treasure which now both buyer and seller refused to accept (Midrash Jonah 100-102, Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer 43, Exodus Rabbah 45.1). Further- more, we are told (Targum on Jon. 1:16) that the sailors promised to make sacrifices to God upon their return to land. Indeed, the Midrash Jonah states that they went up to Jerusalem, were circumcised, and after the completion of their conversion to Judaism brought sacrifices. See Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews, 3.29-30 and 6.10-11, n. 54. 42. See Mekhilta Bo (Pisha) 2a. See also Jerome on Jon. 1:6.</page><page sequence="20">20 LOUIS H. FELDMAN not reveal itself outside of the Land of Israel, he hoped, by fleeing, to cease receiving communications from God to go to Nineveh (Mekhilta Bo lb-2a, Jerusalem Sanhedrin 11.30b).43 It is significant that in the Book of Jonah the name of Israel is not mentioned even once; and except for the fact that Jonah is a Hebrew (Jon. 1:9), the reader would see no connection with the Jews. In fact, in the Septuagint version even this is missing, and the passage reads, "I am a servant of the Lord."44 In Josephus, however, the Jewish con- nection of Jonah is clear both because he prophesies to King Jeroboam of Israel (A 9.206) and because Josephus remarks (A 9.208) that he thought it necessary to recount what he had found written in the Hebrew books con- cerning Jonah. Moreover, that Josephus' narrative is focused on Jonah rather than on the Ninevites may be seen in the fact that Josephus (A 9.214) adds the extrabiblical detail that after giving his prediction about Nineveh Jonah returned to his country (607rfrpEOE, "turned back"). Thus we see that the focus at the end of the pericope is on Jonah and on the land of Israel to which he returned, rather than on Nineveh. Josephus was clearly confronted with a dilemma as to how to handle Jonah's behavior in hiding on the ship, since this would seem to indicate an attempt to flee his duty and an indifference toward the Gentiles whom he was to warn. The Bible (Jon. 1:5) declares that Jonah had gone down into the inner part of the ship and had lain down and was fast asleep. The Septuagint presents an even more degrading picture, since it reads that Jonah was asleep and was snoring ('peyXE). Josephus' Jonah (A 9.209) has covered himself up (avyKaXL5iag) and prostrated himself (PiP3XnTro); there is no indication that he is asleep, let alone that he is snoring. Moreover, most importantly, Josephus gives a good reason why Jonah had absented himself, namely, that he did not wish to imitate any of the things (presumably an allusion to their pagan prayers) that he saw the sailors doing. Likewise, in passing over the exchange between Jonah and the captain of the ship (Jon. 1:6) Josephus is concerned with upholding the status of Jonah, so that it should not appear that Jonah the Jew is given lessons on his reli- gious obligations, as the biblical story has it, by a pagan. Indeed, Jonah's standing is further accentuated subsequently by Josephus (A 9:211) when he has him volunteer the advice that he be thrown overboard by the crew 43. Cited by Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews, 6.349, n. 27. 44. See above, n. 26.</page><page sequence="21">JOSEPHUS' INTERPRETATION OF JONAH 21 rather than give this counsel only in response to the question by the crew, as in Jonah 1:11-12. Furthermore, in his version of Jonah's prayer from the belly of the fish (A 9:214), Josephus, instead of emphasizing Jonah's distress, appeals to God to grant him "pardon for his sins" (avyy6t'uj1v . .. T7CV iaprB# iPT ), whereas the element of self-confession is absent in the much more extended prayer in the Bible (Jon. 2:1-9). This stress on Jonah's contrite repentance would doubtless raise his stature in the eyes of his readers. Moreover, the biblical statement (Jon. 4:1) indicating Jonah's extreme anger with God because He had forgiven the Ninevites after they had repented might well have been interpreted as chauvinism on the part of Jonah and, through him, of the Jewish people whom he represented. The Septuagint on this verse, we may note, softens Jonah's anger by reading that Jonah was very deeply grieved (iXv7r6Oel ... X ?rvY ya?cvkTu) and confound- ed (avvEX0LO7) rather than that he was displeased and angry. Josephus avoids the problem by omitting the passage completely. Remarkably, in contrast to the Bible (Jon. 1:2), there is no indication in Josephus that the people of Nineveh had sinned or that the city would be destroyed because of this; and there is no indication that the prediction of Jonah was not fulfilled. Moreover, in ignoring the repentance of the Nine- vites Josephus was risking antagonizing those pagan readers who, like Pseudo-Longinus (9.9), might have been acquainted with the Bible, and seems to be conveying a message that there is no possibility of repentance by pagans. On the other hand, Josephus shared the concern of the rabbis not to view the Israelites less favorably than the Gentiles. Moreover, as a historian rather than a theologian, he knew that the city of Nineveh did eventually fall; and so there is no discrepancy between what he says and the fact of the matter.45 Proselytes and "God-Fearers" in the Book ofJonah Perhaps the most sensitive implication of the Book of Jonah is that the sailors became proselytes or "sympathizers" with Judaism, since we read 45. In the apocryphal Book of Tobit (14:4) there is a reference to the prophecy of Jonah according to which Assyria and Nineveh would be destroyed. This is the reading of the major manuscripts; but Frank Zimmerman, ed., The Book of Tobit (New York: Harper, 1958), pp. 40-41, prefers to read Nahum in place of Jonah, though it would seem more likely that Tobit and Josephus reflect a common tradition.</page><page sequence="22">22 LOUIS H. FELDMAN (Jon. 1:16) that they "feared the Lord with great fear and offered sacrifices to the Lord and made vows." The Bible (Jon. 3:5) expands on their piety by remarking that the people of Nineveh believed in God and, in their sincere repentance, proclaimed a fast and, from the greatest to the smallest, put on sackcloth. Both of these statements are significantly missing in Josephus. A late midrash (Tanrhuma Vayikra 8 end; Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer 10.72-73; Midrash Jonah 97) indicates that, like the sons of Sennacherib, the Ninevites went to Jerusalem, were circumcised, and brought sacrifices, thus complet- ing their conversion. As the Romans saw a decline in religiosity (see, for example, the preface to Livy's history) they became more and more bitter about those who were trying to draw them away from their ancestral religion and values. The expulsion of 139 B.C.E. (Valerius Maximus 1.3.3.) and, apparently, that of 19 C.E. (Josephus, A 18.81-84); Tacitus, Annals 2.85; Suetonius, Tiberius 36; Dio Cassius 57.18.5a) had been connected with the alleged attempt of the Jews to convert non-Jews to Judaism;46 and we must note that such drastic action had taken place despite the generally favorable attitude of the Roman government toward the Jews. One would have thought that the destruction of the Temple in 70 C.E. and the tremendous loss of prestige of the Jews that must have accompanied it would have dealt the proselyting movement a blow from which it would not recover. And yet, as Graetz has shown, it was after this period that the movement was most successful in official circles in Rome, especially under Domitian,47 precisely the time when Josephus was writing the work, the Antiquities,48 containing the pericope about Jonah.49 Indeed, in the reign of 46. See Ernest L. Abel, "Were the Jews Banished from Rome in 19 A.D.?" Revue des Etudes juives 127 (1968): 383-386. Margaret H. Williams, "The Expulsion of the Jews from Rome in A.D. 19," Latomus 48 (1989): 765-784, argues that the expulsion of 19 was the conventional response of a beleaguered administration to a group which was deemed to be posing a threat to law and order, but her case is hardly convincing. 47.

Josephus (A 20.267) says that he completed his Antiquities in the thirteenth year of the reign of Domitan, that is, 93-94. 49. Undoubtedly the main reasons for the success of proselytism were political, social, and religious developments in Rome itself and, above all, the inherent appeal of Judaism. See my "Proselytism and Syncretism" [in Hebrew], in World History of the Jewish People, ed.

Perhaps this success was also, in part, due to admiration for the heroism which the Jews had shown in the great war against the</page><page sequence="23">JOSEPHUS' INTERPRETATION OF JONAH 23 Domitian (95 C.E.), we hear (Dio 67.14); cf. Suetonius, Domitian 15.1) that Flavius Clemens, the cousin of Domitian, and his wife, Flavia Domitilla, the emperor's niece, were charged, together with many others, with atheism and with having drifted (0oKiXXovrTE) into the practices of the Jews (r&amp; rTov 'Ioviiativ -07). In view of Dio's language, and especially the word "drifted," we cannot be sure that they were proselytes; and they may rather have been "sympathizers," who adopted certain Jewish practices.50 In any case, in a bitter attack, Juvenal (14.96-106) charges that sympathy with Jewish prac- tices in one generation leads in the next generation to full conversion to Judaism. Josephus, therefore, had to be extremely careful not to offend his Roman hosts by referring to the inroads that the Jews had made through proselytes into the Roman populace. Indeed, his aim in the Antiquities is to follow in the footsteps of Ptolemy Philadelphus, as he says in his proem (A 1.10), in seeking to make the Bible better known and consequently to gain respect for the Jews, rather than to convert the pagans. It is surely significant that in the Antiquities, aside from the passage (A 20.17-96) about the conversion of the royal family of Adiabene (which was, after all, under Parthian domination, and hence of no immediate concern to the Romans), Josephus nowhere propagandizes for proselytes. The picture of the non-Jewish sailors in the biblical book is that of pious men who shift from the worship of their own pagan gods (Jon. 1:5) to the worship of the Hebrew God. When the lot falls upon Jonah as the guilty one and Jonah asks to be thrown overboard, the sailors shudder to do so, since Romans. Thus, even Tacitus, though showing utter contempt for the Jews, grudgingly admits (Histories 5.13.3) that during the siege "both men and women showed the same determination, and if they were forced to change their home, they feared life more than death." Dio Cassius (66.5), in a detail omitted, one would guess, intentionally, by the pro-Roman Josephus, notes that a number of Roman soldiers defected to the Jews during the course of the siege, persuaded that the city was actually impregnable. We may further suggest that Josephus' extensive account (War 7.252-406) of the defenders of Masada, which was relatively unimportant from a military point of view, and of their grisly act of committing mutual suicide rather than submit- ting to the Romans, might have aroused the admiration of the Romans, as, indeed, it did of the Roman soldiers who entered Masada and were "incredulous of such amazing fortitude" ( War 7.405). 50. Christian tradition makes Clemens and Domitilla martyrs during Domitian's persecu- tion of the Christians; but by the time of Dio (150-235) the distinction between Jews and Chris- tians was probably clear to the Roman world, as Harry J. Leon (The Jews of Ancient Rome [Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1960], p. 252) remarks, though Dio himself never mentions the Christians by name.</page><page sequence="24">24 LOUIS H. FELDMAN they shrink from shedding innocent blood (Jon. 1:14), and, indeed invoke the name of the Lord twice within a single sentence (ibid.). In fact, we are told (Jon. 1:16) that they feared the Lord exceedingly and that they offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made vows. One is reminded of the mishnaic state- ment (Kiddushin 4:14) of the second-century Rabbi Judah in the name of his older contemporary Abba Gurion of Zadian, that most sailors are saintly. The picture in Josephus is very different. There is no indication in Josephus that the sailors were or were not Jews or that they prayed to their own in- dividual gods; instead (A 9.209) we are told very simply that the sailors began to pray, without being told to whom they were praying. While it is true (A 9.212) that the sailors regard it as an impious act to cast Jonah into the sea, their morality is based not upon the prohibition of shedding inno- cent blood but rather upon the ancient Greek sanction concerning hospital- ity toward strangers who have entrusted their lives to their hosts, a passage that a reader acquainted with Homer's Odyssey, with its emphasis on proper and improper hospitality (the Phaeacians and Polyphemus the Cyclops, respectively), would have especially appreciated.5 The rabbinic tradition (Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer 10, Tanhzuma Vayikra 8, Midrash Jonah 97)52 stresses the non-Jewish origin of the sailors by noting that on the vessel were representatives of the seventy nations of the world, each with his peculiar idols, and that they all resolved to entreat their gods for help, with the understanding that the god from whom help would come would be recognized and worshipped as the only one true God.53 When help came from none of the pagan gods, the captain showed his admiration for Judaism by stating that he had heard that the God of the Hebrews was most powerful and that if they would cry to Him perhaps He would perform miracles. Indeed, Pseudo-Philo (Homily on Jonah), on the basis of the bibli- cal statement that Nineveh was saved, conjectures that proselytism had already reached a high point where his homily was pronounced. The biblical statement that they feared the Lord with great fear is surely 51. Of course, the behavior of the sailors is not necessarily an indication of a Greek concept of hospitality, since such an attitude was prevalent in the Near East generally, as we see, for example, in the Bible's portrait of Abraham; but Josephus' Greek readers would most probably think of the Homeric reference. 52. See Ginzberg, 'Legends of the Jews, 4.247-248. 53. Cf. A 1.161, where, in Josephus' addition to the biblical text, Abraham shows a similar open-mindedness in declaring, upon his descent to Egypt, that he would adopt the doctrines of the Egyptians if he found them superior to his own, but that he would convert the Egyptians if he found his own doctrines superior to theirs.</page><page sequence="25">JOSEPHUS' INTERPRETATION OF JONAH 25 reminiscent of the "God-fearers," well known from the eleven passages in Acts (10:2, 22, 35; 13:16, 26, 43, 50; 16:14, 17:4, 17; 18:7) referring to opofoi- IEvot rTov OEov ("fearers of God") and oap361uvot rov Ef6v ("reverencers of God") and from the passage in Juvenal (14.96) referring to one who fears (metuentem) the Sabbath and who has a son who eventually becomes a full- fledged Jew. It is true that these terms, in and of themselves, do not neces- sarily refer to "sympathizers" and may, indeed, refer to pious Jews, as I have noted.54 But the new inscriptions from Aphrodisias make it more likely that these are, indeed, terms referring to "sympathizers," at least in the third century, the apparent date of the inscriptions.55 By the third century there can be no doubt that there was such a class, as is clear from a passage in the Jerusalem Talmud (Megillah 3.2.74a),56 which quotes Rabbi Eleazar, a third-century Palestinian rabbi, as saying that only Gentiles who had nothing to do with the Jews during their bitter past will not be permitted to convert to Judaism in the time of the Messiah, but that those "Heaven-fearers" (yirei shamayim) who had shared the tribulations of Israel would be accepted as full proselytes, with the Emperor Antoninus at their head.57 Finally, Josephus was, we may suggest, careful not to compliment the Ninevites, who were, geographically at any rate, as we have noted, the ancestors of the Parthians, the great national enemy of the Romans.58 Indeed, in Josephus (A 9.109) Jonah is depicted as covering himself up on board the ship and not imitating any of the things, presumably referring to the sailors' idol-worship, which he saw the others on the ship doing. More- over, in the biblical narrative (Jon. 1:9) there is no intimation, in the rebuke of the captain of the ship to Jonah, that he might be the cause of the storm; 54.

FELDMAN rather, he berates him merely for not praying to his God. In Josephus (A 9:210), on the other hand, there is no scene involving the captain and Jonah; rather, we read that the sailors began to suspect, "as is natural," that one of the passengers was the cause of the storm. "Hellenizations" in Josephus' Account That Josephus in his pericope is making an appeal to his Hellenized audience may be seen from the fact that he refers to Nineveh not by its usual name, such as is found in the Hebrew (Nineveh) or in the Septuagint (Ntvmvi) and elsewhere in Josephus (e.g., in the prophecy of Nahum, A 9.239-242),59 but rather as the kingdom of Ninos (A 9.209).60 By referring to the kingdom thus, Josephus is reminding the reader of the husband of the legendary great Assyrian queen Semiramis, the daughter of the fish-goddess Atargatis of Ascalon in Palestine, who created for her husband at Nineveh a tomb nine stadia high and ten in width and who succeeded him in the rule.6' By referring to Nineveh as Ninos, Josephus is, furthermore, recalling to the reader that Ninos, after completing great conquests, decided to found a city so great that it would not only be the largest city among all the cities of the inhabited world but so large that no later king would ever establish a larger one (Ctesias, ap. Diodorus 2.3). To be sure, Josephus avoids expatiating on the size of the city, as does the Hebrew version (Jon. 4:11); but that may be because he seeks to avoid the charge of exaggeration. The fact that it is to Joppa (modern Jaffa) that Jonah goes to find a ship (Jon. 1:3) supplies a further connection with Greek mythology, since it is 59. To be sure, in A 9.239, Josephus refers to the city by both names, Ninos and Nineveh; but elsewhere, in the prophecy of Nahum, the name is spelled "Ninos." The rule seems to be that when he refers to Nineveh by itself he calls it Nineveh. 60. While it is true that Josephus does sometimes vary the spelling of proper names, the variation is seldom of the order that we find here; and, in any case, it would seem to be more than a coincidence that the variant is a name that has such special significance as that of Ninos. 61. We may conjecture that the fact that Ninos is the son-in-law of the fish-goddess Atar- gatis may have occasioned the use of this name in place of Nineveh in the story of Jonah, whose most famous incident connects him with a fish. The very name Nineveh, according to a popular etymology, means "place of the fish," and the cuneiform pictogram for the city shows Nina, representing an enclosure with a fish inside (see Ephraim A. Speiser, e.v. "Nineveh," Inter- preters' Dictionary of the Bible, vol. 3 [Nashville: Abingdon, 1962], p. 552). In Hellenistic times a parallel was drawn with the Greek god Ninos, who was a fish-god.</page><page sequence="27">JOSEPHUS' INTERPRETATION OF JONAH 27 there that Andromeda was chained to a rock (Strabo 16.2.28), as Josephus (War 3.420) mentions elsewhere, whence she was rescued by the great hero Perseus, who, like Jonah, is connected with a fish, which, however, he fought against and wounded. As we have noted above, another touch which would surely have appealed to Josephus' Greek audience was his treatment of the scene in which the sailors cast Jonah into the sea. In the Hebrew (Jon. 1:13-14) the sailors try desperately to avoid throwing him into the sea because they do not want to have innocent blood on their hands through the impious act of murder. In Josephus the crime which they seek to avoid is not the religious one of murder but rather the crime of inhospitality (A 9.212), so such a con- cern to the Greeks, as we see particularly in Homer's Odyssey, since, in an extrabiblical addition, Jonah was a stranger (4ivov) who had entrusted his life to them. This Hellenizing touch would have been particularly effective because Josephus, in describing the storm which led the sailors to such desperate straits, uses a phrase (lirEpfta xoyvov TOO KacKov) taken directly from Thucydides' description of the plague (2.52.3) which beset Athens near the beginning of the Peloponnesian War and led the Athenians to give up the semblance of morality and respect for law (2.52-53)-the very opposite of the attitude of the sailors under duress. Finally, we may note the fact that Jonah (A 9.211) identifies himself as a prophet of "the most high God" (roo -iEyiLrTov 0EoO), rather than, as in the Bible (Jon. 1:9), as one who fears "the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land." Thus Josephus would appeal to his pagan audience, since it is such a God who is acknowledged by pagans as well as by Jews, as we see, for example, in the fact that when Cyrus, the king of Persia, sends his decree throughout his realm (Ezra 1:1-4) he declares, in Josephus' version (A 11.3),62 that it is the most high God (6 bOs 6 iEytaTros) who has appointed him king of the habitable world and that He is the god whom the Israelites also worship. It is this equation of the God of the Jews with the supreme God of the pagans that we find in another apologetic set- ting, namely, in the Letter of Aristeas (16), where the chief of the translators, at the symposium sponsored by King Ptolemy Philadelphus in their honor, explains to the king that the Jewish God is simply another name for Zeus, 62. In the Hebrew and Septuagint versions (Ezra 1:2) God is called "the Lord, the God of heaven."</page><page sequence="28">28 LOUIS H. FELDMAN thus seeking to diminish the theological differences between the Greeks and the Jews. Another way in which Josephus appeals to his Greek audience is through introducing dramatic motifs and language.63 We may see this in his dramatization of the storm which beset the ship in which Jonah found him- self. In the Bible (Jon. 1:5) we are told that the mariners were afraid, whereas Josephus (A 9.209) is more dramatic in declaring that as the vessel was in danger of sinking, not only the sailors, as in the Hebrew text, but also the pilots and even the shipmaster began to pray. The recapitulation in Jose- phus of this episode in considerable detail is all the more remarkable in- asmuch as he so drastically compresses the whole rest of the story. All the more does the question of the reason for Josephus' variation arise, since the storm episode does not appear to have any crucial bearing on Josephus' underlying concern with introducing the figure of Jonah in the first place, that is, to present him as one in a long line of true prophets whose predic- tions do come about as they are revealed. Moreover, in order not to subject himself to ridicule by his Greek audience, Josephus shuns the grotesque, as we see, for example, in his avoidance of such exaggerations in connection with Samson's strength.64 In the case of Jonah, the Bible (Jon. 3:3) states that Nineveh was an exceedingly great city, three days' journey in width; and the rabbinic tradition (Midrash Jonah 99-100) goes even further in asserting that the city covered forty square parasangs and contained a million and a half human beings,65 where- as the Bible (Jon. 4:11) gives the population as one hundred and twenty thousand. Josephus simply omits such data altogether. Similarly the Bible (Jon. 3:6-8) declares that the king of Nineveh decreed a public fast and ordered that beasts as well as men be clad in the sackcloth of mourning.66 A scene describing beasts clad in sackcloth would 63.

Summary Josephus has transformed what Bickerman has called a morality play, which, in the Bible, focuses upon the sinful people of Nineveh, their genuine repentance, and their forgiveness by God,67 into a historical episode center- ing upon the historical figure of Jonah, who, as a prophet, is closely akin to the historian, and upon his political mission. All the reasons why the book was chosen for the haftarah of the afternoon service of the most sacred day of the Jewish calendar, the Day of Atonement, namely, to emphasize that God is the God of all mankind, that it is impossible to flee from His pres- ence, and that He pities His creatures and forgives those who turn to Him in truth68-all these are conspicuously absent from Josephus' account. The biblical version is more an unfulfilled prophecy than a book about a prophet, whereas Josephus' is about a prophet and, via Nahum, of a fulfilled prophecy. In an effort to appeal to his non-Jewish audience, he has empha- sized the qualities of character of Jonah and muted the role of God. He has avoided taking responsibility for the central miracle of the book, the episode of Jonah in the big fish. Above all, in order not to offend his Roman hosts, who were very sensitive about proselytizing by Jews, he avoids subscribing to the biblical indications that the inhabitants of Nineveh had repented and had turned to Judaism, in whole or, at any rate, in part.
