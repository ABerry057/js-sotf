<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lionel Kochan. Jews, Idols and Messiahs: The Challenge from History. Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1990. 231 pp. Lionel Kochan, recently retired from the Bearsted Readership in Jewish History at the University of Warwick, has had a sustained interest in mes- sianism. In The Jew and His History (1977), he explored the proclivity of Jewish historical writers to use history with an eye to its culmination in the messianic future. Already in that book it was clear that Kochan viewed mes- sianism as a grave threat to Judaism and much preferred the "praxis" enjoined by Jewish law. In this volume the opposition of law and eschatol- ogy reappears within a different framework characterized by the tension between community and idolatry. It is typical of Kochan's writing in this book, as in his earlier one, that he shuttles back and forth between the roles of historian and religious ideolo- gist. Thus the first part of the volume is mostly devoted to an extended com- parative treatment of two Jewish communities during the period of their modernization: Berlin (1670-1800) and London (1650-1880). Indeed, at times it seems as if Kochan is presenting two rather detailed historical accounts for the sake of their own specific interest, especially when he</page><page sequence="2">368 BOOK REVIEWS includes matters unrelated to his underlying arguments. Moreover, although (with the exception of the minute books of the British Board of Deputies) he uses printed sources almost exclusively, his accounts of the two communities rest upon considerable research and possess independent value. As a historian, Kochan's purpose is to present Berlin and London as two sharply contrasting communities. For the former, modernity brought increased state interference in its affairs along with a diminution of legal autonomy. But membership in a unified Berlin community remained com- pulsory, with the state enforcing the community's taxes. London Jewry, by contrast, enjoyed much greater freedom in running its affairs but at the same time could not prevent Jews from leaving the synagogues, which in eighteenth-century London, in the absence of a single organized community and a sharp division between Ashkenazim and Sephardim, were the primary objects of Jewish identification. Members could be disciplined by synagogue authorities only as long as they chose to remain affiliated. And, of course, London Jews possessed far less interest in Jewish learning than did their German contemporaries. Kochan's comparisons are certainly welcome, even if here and there one could argue that they are overdrawn or obvious. But his ultimate aim in dis- cussing these communities lies beyond both description and comparison. Taken together, Berlin and London serve as examples of how, under differ- ent circumstances and however inadequately, Jews have organized to fulfill the requirements of Torah. It is these two communities' day-to-day endeavors to respond to Torah and thus to help "mend the world" that Kochan, the religious ideologist, holds up as the Jewish ideal. That ideal's champions are the rabbis, whose crown of Torah, as Kochan notes in an introductory chapter, is lamentably tarnished as lay prerogatives gain ascendancy over rabbinical ones begin- ning as early as the late Middle Ages. Their opponents, the parnasim, are not, however, the principal object of concern. Rather it is the messianists of every period who represent the chief danger to Torah. Unable to adjust to historical circumstances-as communities necessarily do-messianists resort to idolatry, by which Kochan means the anti-Jewish act of ascribing absolute importance to something less than God: "the stars, a charismatic individual, the nation-state and the soil." Put differently, avodah zarah (the term he prefers to use) is the attempt to substitute some other entity (images, nature, even words) for Torah "as the sole and true medium of communica- tion with God."</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 369 As Torah requires Jewish communities for its fulfillment, so does mes- sianism, in most of its forms, resort to avodah zarah. The messianic pretend- er assumes superhuman stature and mediates between the individual Jew and God. Somewhat apologetically, Kochan tries to reduce the onus of such messianism within historical Judaism by dwelling upon Maimonides' natur- alistic and intrahistorical messianic conception and by devoting more atten- tion to Jacob Sasportas's opposition to Shabbetai Zevi than to Sabbatian- ism itself. Coming down to the present, he laments that in the ideology of Gush Emunim "the cloven hoof of avodah zarah shows through the messian- ic garb," but here too there are fortunately still Jews, like British chief rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits and the Israeli thinker Isaiah Leibowitz, whose strin- gently halakhic stance resists the temptations of idolatrous messianism. Kochan is neither an anti-Zionist nor an unqualified anti-messianist. Rather this historical study is his argument for containing messianism with- in Jewish history: that is, within the ongoing process of communal response-whether in the diaspora or in Israel-to the commandments of Torah. It is an argument that deserves attention. Michael A. Meyer Hebrew Union College Cincinnati, Ohio</page></plain_text>
