Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London: University of California Press, 1999. xxii, 503 pp. Ever since the appearance of the fifth and final volume (to be supplemented by Paula Sanders' excellent and indispensable cumulative index volume in 1993) of Goitein's magisterial reconstruction of Jewish social and economic life in the medieval Islamic Mediterranean world, there has been a general recognition of the 135</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review need for an abridgement that would make the work more immediately accessible to the educated lay reader and could be a useful text for college students of Jew- ish, Islamic or even general medieval history. After all, such useful epitomes have been made-and remain popular-for such voluminous masterpieces as Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Toynbee's A Study of History, or Frazer's The Golden Bough. Jacob Lassner's skillful one-volume edited abridgement has in part filled the need that was so sorely felt. I say "in part," because the editor ex- plains in his engaging Foreword (pp. xi-xxii) that it was in his view insufficient merely to delete major segments of the original (as any such abridgement would require), nor was it enough to rearrange the order of the segments that he had se- lected (a perhaps debatable, but certainly justifiable editorial decision which this reviewer finds quite successful), but rather it was "deemed necessary" to go be- yond pruning Goitein's style and occasionally "to rewrite entire passages for the sake of clarity." This latter editorial decision is somewhat unsettling since an au- thor's voice, even when idiosyncratic or even flawed, is still his own. There is a slight echo offertaytsht unferbesert in such a tack. In this abridgement, the editor has decided to focus on Jewish communal or- ganization, family life and structure, and the interaction between the Jewish mi- nority and the Muslim majority on all levels. Essentially, then, this is the essence of volumes two and three. Lassner demonstrates a good sense of narrative, and there is such a smooth flow that the reader feels that this is a homogeneous, seam- less text. Having kept the abridgement uncluttered by Goitein's numerous techni- cal annotations, he has judiciously provided a necessary minimum of notes that identify works specifically mentioned in the text, refer the reader to materials in the original that are alluded to or touched upon tangentially in the abridgement, or clarify some point or discovery which Goitein himself had made elsewhere (as for example, in his extensive research on the India trade, the bulk of which has yet to be published). Lassner has provided a brief addendum on Geniza studies in the United States (spelled Genizah on the title and headers for this chapter afterword alone) and "Its Past and Future Links to Near Eastern Historiography" (pp. 469- 482) with the emphasis on the latter. There is a very detailed and useful general in- dex (pp. 483-501). Goitein would have been particularly pleased by that; one of his pet peeves was the inadequate indexing of many scholarly books. Jacob Lassner has made a very important contribution by bringing a part of Goitein's magnum opus to the wider audience it deserves. This abridgement will make a perfect text for college classes in medieval Jewish, Islamic, and Mediterra- nean history, anthropology, and sociology, as well as in adult education courses in the wider Jewish community. It is to be hoped that there may some day be an ad- ditional abridgement of the remaining volumes dealing with economic history, which has a vibrancy that demolishes any notion that the subject need be dull; with material-cultural history, which gives a palpable feel for the realia of everyday life in the same vein as, but with far finer detail than, the many books inspired by Car- copino's classic Daily Life in Ancient Rome; and with the analysis of the individ- ual in which Goitein with deep sensitivity and insight painted a composite portrait of"the Mediterranean personality of medieval culture which emerges from the let- ters and documents of the Cairo Geniza" (A Mediterranean Society 5:1). Such a 136</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews volume would be a perfect complement to Lassner's work and would bring before the wider public the full scope of Goitein's majestic historical vision.
