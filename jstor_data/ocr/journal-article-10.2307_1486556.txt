<plain_text><page sequence="1">258 BOOK REVIEWS Ehud Benor. Worship of the Heart: A Study in Maimonides' Philosophy of Religion. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1995. ix, 262 pp. The strengths of this wonderful book are manifold. Ehud Benor adds further and very convincing evidence in support of the thesis that Mai- monides' philosophical and religious commitments complemented rather than contradicted each other. Benor's book also serves as an important corrective to much recent writing on Maimonides which emphasizes either his halakhic work or his philosophic work, or the attempt to synthesize the two, while ignoring the fundamentally religious aspect of Maimonides the man, Maimonides the communal leader, Maimonides the halakhist, and Maimonides the philosopher. In all of these roles Maimonides was a person consumed by the desire to stand before God, and it is an awareness of that desire that informs Benor's entire discussion. Worship of the Heart is divided into three relatively independent chapters which can be profitably read in isolation but which together form a convincing and coherent whole, proving that Maimonides saw no conflict between a conception of prayer as dialogue with God (in which the human partner in the dialogue engages in praise, petition, and thanksgiving, in the hope that the prayer will be answered) and a conception of prayer as meditation. The first conception of prayer is often dismissed as naive and primitive, the second praised as sophisticated and philosophical. According to Benor's convincing exposition of Maimonides, the first type of prayer leads the devotee toward the second, while even the sophisticated philosopher engaged in meditative, contemplative prayer cannot do without dialogical prayer. Thanksgiving can become a pure act of worship when, "as a ritual obligation [it] brings into focus the true relation between humans and God." In making this argument, Benor takes issue with interpreters of Maimonides like Julius Guttmann and Marvin Fox, who thought that Maimonides held two incompatible conceptions of prayer, and interpreters like Alvin Reines, who, consistent with his vision of Maimonides as a heterodox thinker, understood him to hold a purely contemplative conception of prayer. It should be noted that the discussions with Guttmann, Fox, and Reines are only a small part of Benor's critical dialogue with medieval interlocutors and modem interpreters of Maimonides. Chapter 1, "Prayer and Human Perfection," seeks to establish the meaning of the contemplative ideal in Maimonides' thought. One of the central claims of the chapter is that "the concluding statement of The Guide should be understood as purporting to have solved the problem, which Aristotle</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 259 identified in the Nicomachean Ethics, of the relation between a life devoted primarily to contemplation and a life of practical excellence" (p. 23). It is in the concluding paragraph of the Guide of the Perplexed that Maimonides moves from a conception of the ideal life as purely contemplative to an ideal of imitatio Dei as the doing of "loving-kindness, righteousness, and judgment in the world." Many scholars (including the present reviewer) have written on this apparent change of heart by Maimonides. I cannot speak for others, but for my part, my study of the subject would have profited greatly had Benor's analysis been available to me when I wrote it. Benor's task in this chapter is "not to determine what Maimonides' 'true belief' concerning God was, but to examine if any of his various conceptions of God is a fitting object for the kind of contemplation that can be shown to have virtuous consequences" (p. 37). He tries "to see whether it is possible to identify in Maimonides' writings an understanding of theoretical excellence that somehow makes the contemplative philosopher aware of practical virtues and interested in virtuous action" (ibid.). Maimonides is shown to have interpreted Aristotle such that the intellectual and practical excellences are unified in the best life. Intellectual excellence for Maimonides, in Benor's sophisticated treatment, is morally transformative. Virtue and reason are unified by showing a "reciprocity and an interdependence between theoretical and practical wisdom" (p. 58). Benor shows Maimonides to have anticipated much of the most recent Aristotle scholarship on this issue. Among the many points to ponder in this chapter is Benor's interesting distinction between knowledge of God (strictly "circumscribed by Maimonides' conception of God as absolutely transcendent" [p. 63]) and thinking about God. Chapter 2, "Prayer as Worship," is devoted to determining what con- ception of prayer informs Maimonides' Laws of Prayer. It is Benor's task in this chapter to show that "Maimonides considered prayer a duty that does not depend upon a felt interest in praying ... [it is] not only an expression of religious-ethical consciousness but a vehicle for promoting one" (p. 61). It is Benor's insight that statutory prayer (praise, petition, and thanksgiving, the prayer of dialogue as opposed to the prayer of meditative contemplation) is essential, not only for the masses, but also for the elite. One worships God in prayer in order to achieve an awareness of being in the presence of God even in the midst of the concerns of daily life. Worshipful gratitude leads to unconditional love of God (love of God for Maimonides, of course, being equivalent to knowledge of God), which in turn leads to imitatio Dei. Understood in this context, petitionary prayer "is more an</page><page sequence="3">260 BOOK REVIEWS endeavor to present one's true needs before God than [simply] an attempt to communicate one's desires to God in order that God will satisfy them" (p. 129). Moreover, "passionate love of God, which completes the philosopher's contemplation of nature, is not purely theoretical, but involves an exercise of practical wisdom" (p. 56). In sum, Maimonidean prayer is not supplication or meditation, communication with God or contemplation of God, but both: the two worshipful attitudes complement each other, they do not exclude each other. Chapter 3, "Prayer and God's Knowledge," shows that Maimonides' "austere theology does [not] conflict with his halakhic idea of prayer" (p. 158). The chapter elucidates an interpretation by Maimonides of God's knowledge which makes possible the conception of prayerful worship ("that God is aware of our prayers and sometimes responds to them" [p. 130]) developed in the first two chapters. As a reader who never doubted that this was Maimonides' position, I shall not go into the details of Benor's exposition here. Benor's Maimonides is both the Rambam of the Mishneh Torah and the Maimonides of the Guide of the Perplexed. The Mishneh Torah is addressed to a community, the Guide of the Perplexed to individuals. Benor's Maimonides understands that his self-perfecting individual must exist in a community defined by ritual, including ritualized prayer. It is the great utility of Worship of the Heart that it shows how Maimonides attempted to merge the vita contemplativa with the vita activa, to the enrichment of both and the detriment of neither.
