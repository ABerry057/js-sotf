<plain_text><page sequence="1">Marc B. Shapiro. The Limits of Orthodox Theology: Maimonides'Thirteen Prin- ciples Reappraised. The Littman Library of Jewish Civilization. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. 221 pp. Marc Shapiro puts an explicit contemporary context on this remarkable col- lection of sources that disagreed with one part or other of Maimonides' Thirteen Principles-the beliefs Maimonides asserted were absolutely necessary to be con- sidered a believing Jew and to attain the World to Come. By showing the extent to which past authors disagreed with those Principles, Shapiro seeks to debunk as- sertions by contemporary writers that place those Principles at the core of Ortho- dox belief. 169</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews As a potpourri of ideas, the work is astonishing in its range. Shapiro uses his daunting bibliographical abilities and his considerable skill as a writer to present his material-well-known and obscure-cogently and entertainingly. To the read- er interested in the limits of the theological imagination of Jews, it is not likely to be soon rivaled. What he has not done is offer intellectual history or made a rele- vant theological argument. For history, Shapiro would have at least had to place each idea cited in the context of the time and place in which it developed. What we have instead is a large amount of undigested data, which would need much flesh- ing out to become history. Space considerations prevent critiquing that aspect of the work any further, since listing the problems in Shapiro's main endeavor-using his sources to sup- port a claim about Orthodox theology today-will take more than the rest of this review. First and most problematically, Shapiro explicitly assumes that consensus among Orthodox thinkers cannot render heretical a position once taken as legiti- mate by a traditional scholar (pp. 141-146). He cites three authors on this issue, two of whom agree with him-David Weiss Halivni and Chaim Rapoport. Prob- lematically, those two are not clearly adopting Orthodox positions. The Orthodox world does not generally recognize Weiss Halivni as one of theirs; regardless of his personal practice and beliefs, he provides little evidence of Orthodox theology. Rapoport, a practicing Orthodox rabbi, ratified Shapiro's view in a work written to support a belief that had but one or two sources to support it, so that his claim is already suspect. More, he assumed that view to defend those who believed that the late Lubavitcher Rebbe could still be the Messiah, which David Berger more convincingly showed is not an Orthodox view. Whatever one thinks of Rapoport in general, his views on the status of a lone source as a lasting part of Orthodox theology are suspect because of the context in which he offered them. Shapiro's other source, J. David Bleich-an unquestionably Orthodox thinker-assumes that consensus can in fact convert once-acceptable views to heresy. In a footnote, Shapiro notes several post-medieval rabbinic authorities who determined matters of faith in a proto-halakhic fashion, where consensus becomes normative. Whether Weiss Halivni and Rapoport's views on this matter can be consid- ered Orthodox is crucial because Shapiro is making an assertion about Orthodox theology. If Bleich's position correctly defines Orthodoxy, views from the past are only relevant if they remain plausible elements of the consensus today. Shapiro's claim that any view that was at one time non-heretical remains an option within Orthodoxy, for which he has no Orthodox support, explains why he cares about these sources when contemporary Orthodox thinkers need not. The specific sources Shapiro cites sometimes weaken his argument, also. Since he reads Maimonides as demanding agreement with all details of his Prin- ciples, he can use citations that accept the fundamental idea of the Principles but argue with a detail as proof that later Jews did not accept Maimonides' Principles as completely binding. Aside from the logical implausibility of this reading of Mai- monides-it leads to absurd positions such as Shapiro's assumption that Mai- monides would have labeled a heretic anyone who thought the Messiah could come from a different Davidic line than Solomon's--Shapiro himself offers plentiful ev- 170</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews idence that Maimonides held a more complicated view than he recorded in the Commentary on the Mishnah. As he notes, the content of the Principles appears in Maimonides' later works, but without the same emphasis or prominence. In addition, Shapiro shows us that Maimonides could not have accepted at least some of the Principles as he stated them (pp. 71-77 and pp. 115-117). Just as Maimonides simplified his true position for the audience of the Com- mentary, the Orthodox thinkers who aroused Shapiro's pique were simplifying a more complex reality as well. To pick an easy example, many of the disagreements that Shapiro finds stem from Kabbalah, a stream of thought well known to Orthodox thinkers. It is literally unbelievable that the writers Shapiro quotes meant to require adherence to the Principles to the exclusion of well-known Kabbalistic beliefs. What those writers meant was that the Principles conveniently encompass broad categories of belief. Within each category, sophisticated thinkers may adopt differing positions, differences not vital for the general populace to understand. Shapiro could have per- formed a real service had he clarified the kinds of differences that Orthodox thinkers today can tolerate as "within" the Principles, but he chose a less useful approach. Shapiro's reliance on otherwise unknown authors further limits the utility of the book. He includes any writer who self-identified with the traditional commu- nity and was "regarded as such by significant, if not overwhelming, segments of this community" (p. 28). That only shows that the writer thought of himself as Or- thodox and managed to convince his contemporaries of the same. Maimonides' whole point, though, was that sincerity or ritual fidelity does not create doctrinal acceptability. Before a source is useful in defining Orthodox belief, we would need to know not only that its author was traditional in his actions, but that his ideas were known and accepted as plausible by those qualified to judge. Even with these caveats, the book lays the groundwork for a really useful work defining the limits of Orthodox theology. Although Shapiro only proves what reasonably educated Jews already knew-that Orthodox theology has grown in size and complexity since Maimonides' time-he gives a wonderful head start to anyone choosing to write the more useful book buried within that would combine intellectual history with analysis of the state of belief today to define when, where, and on what issues current Orthodoxy allowed and allows disputing Maimonides.
