University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1993. 258 pp. Jungian analysis of literary texts usually focuses on a few key concepts related to the workings of the unconscious or to personality formation. Jung, as we know, regarded dreams and fantasies as manifestations of the unconscious, but also as creations derived from a universal store of "primordial images" transcending cultures and times. To Freud, dreams were distortions or displacements of repressed childhood experiences, mainly of an Oedipal nature. Jung believed that these images, or "archetypes," were born out of the "collective unconscious," so-called because it was "detached from anything personal and is common to all men."' Jungian critics such as Northrop Frye, the author of Anatomy of Criticism (Princeton, 1957), have been applying these concepts to literature with varying success. In this study, Avraham Balaban traces the Jungian elements in Amos Oz's work, beginning with his short stories published in the early sixties and continuing through the novels To Know a Woman and Fima. His comments on these two novels were added at a later stage and are treated as "supplementary material," since Between God and Beast was originally written in 1986, in Hebrew, before these two works appeared in print. These sections are not sufficiently integrated into Balaban's text. Also, one wonders how the author might have judged Oz's oeuvre if these two important works, along with the yet untranslated novel 'Al Tagidi Layla ("Don't Say Night"), had existed at the time of the original composition of this critical study. Following strictly Jungian lines, Balaban first focuses on the early short stories, then discusses religious aspects of Oz's novels; an analysis of water images and female characters in Oz's longer works follows, and the book ends with a chapter on the element of synthesis in them. Balaban's method of investigation is to focus on a central Jungian idea and see how it manifests itself in a particular work. While he is thorough and insightful, the moving back and forth caused by his dealing with select aspects of a novel at a time, frustrated this reader, who would have preferred a more unified analytical structure. To illustrate Balaban's approach, I will offer an example from his discus- sion of A Perfect Peace. It had been customary to view Yonatan's flight from 1.

A careful reading of the book, however, reveals a phalanx of archetypal images to suggest that Yonatan, alone in the desert, is undergoing the process that Jung calls "individuation." As Balaban explains, in Oz's scheme a person discovers that "hell exists not only in one's fellow man, but in total liberation from him. Life must be found between these two poles . .. the positive and negative-the dark that must be silenced at any price. Yonatan must lead his life according to the dictates of his true heart, even at the cost of breaking social taboos" (p. 127). In essence, Balaban perceives Yonatan's struggle as a typical example of psychological conflict, which, according to Jung, can only be resolved by a process of "synthesis." The technical term "Synthesis" is appropriately the title of Balaban's last chapter; it means the reconciliation of conflicting forces, of the "Godly" and the "Beastly," the "Apollonian" and the "Dionysian." As Balaban correctly points out, Oz's work shows a constant preoccupation with the darker side of the unconscious; his characters struggle to bring opposites into some kind of peaceful coexistence, harmony among competing components of the psyche. Using A Perfect Peace as his paradigm, the author of Between God and Beast concludes that "the struggle ends with discovery of the longed for unity of opposites, yet, because of the contradicting features of the forces that the protagonists try to unite, that unity can only be temporary, a springboard for renewed struggle and a new book" (p. 239). There are many virtues to Balaban's book, especially for the American reader, since Oz's work tends to be overly politicized and Judaicized outside Israel. It is the first such work in English, a perfect introduction to Oz's recurring themes and their development from the early short stories to the latest, longer narratives. While cognizant of the political and historical context of Oz's main heroes, Balaban invites a reading that goes beyond the obvious particulars and into the deeper, more universal layers of these characters' psyche. The dynamics of this psyche is governed primarily by forces in the unconscious, with religion, mysticism, and gender playing a much larger role than previously shown by critics.
