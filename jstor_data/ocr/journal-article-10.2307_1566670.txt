Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1998. xiv, 260 pp.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 143 Yiddish theater played a central role in the cultural life of the Jewish immigrants who came to New York in the years of mass immigration terminated by the National Origins Act of 1924. At its peak, the Yiddish theater in New York equaled Broadway in its commercial and artistic achievements. Edna Nahshon's book deals with a particular chapter in the history of the Yiddish theater, the leftist/communist theater or, as it became known by its acronym, Artef. The book gives us the necessary background for a basic understanding of the Jewish political make-up of New York in the years between the two world wars. Nahshon explains the links between the various Jewish parties and the different Yiddish theaters in New York at that time. When it comes to the analysis of the art of the Artef, however, the book leaves much to be desired. In its fifteen years, the Artef produces mostly theatrical failures. Nahshon does not emphasize enough the striking fact that the theater failed in the revolutionary plays for which it was created. She mentions their lack of success without point out their common denominator, which would be the ideological commitment that overrides theatrical viability. The communist heroes failed to appeal even to the devout communist audience. The Soviet imports and the socially engaged American plays failed. In other words, the proletarian theater failed when it tried to be proletarian. Success came with plays from the so-called classic Yiddish repertoire by artists such as Israel Axenfeld ("Recruits") or Sholem Aleichem ("200,000," known also as "The Jackpot"). This raises interesting questions for theater scholars and practitioners. Is a proletarian theater a contradiction in terms? Is every ideological theater doomed to failure? Why is it that another deeply ideological enterprise such as the medieval theater captured the minds and hearts of its audience in a way that the communist theater never did? Nahshon fails to raise such fundamental questions, let alone try to answer them. Nahshon's book also fails to deal with the theatrical aspect of her subject matter. She has trouble defining the nature of various productions and articulating their strengths and weaknesses; the tools for such an analysis are not evident in the book. Plays are never staged as written. A director, unlike a conductor, does not stick to the text in front of him. In fact, directors write a second text, known as a prompt book, and it is the prompt book that serves as the basis for the performance. I find it surprising that in her analysis of the various productions Nahshon never studied the prompt books of the Artef productions. Instead she relies on often questionable analysis done by others in their press reviews. Her own critical voice is curiously absent from the book.</page><page sequence="3">144 BOOK REVIEWS When she goes beyond the critics, her analysis is often unsatisfying. For instance, when writing about a certain Artef production, she refers to Richard Wagner who, she maintains, "aimed at liberating the stage from the supremacy of the spoken word" (p. 51). The opposite is true. Wagner believed in the supremacy of the German language and the German word. His very concept of Gesamtkunstwerk aimed at the fusion of the German word and German music. (This is also the reason why he advocated the elimination of the Jews as a non-Germanic element that stands in the way of such union.) Nahshon seems to ignore the meaning of basic theatrical terms. She refers to Benno Schneider's success in the direction of "200,000" ("The Jackpot") as a "directorial coup de theatre" (p. 160). A "coup de theatre," however, is a sudden and sensational turn in a play. Serious playwrights try to avoid it. The book contains a digest of press reviews that were part of the leftist theatrical scene in New York between the two World Wars. In that respect the book provides interesting information for readers who cannot read the Yiddish texts in the original. Edna Nahshon's book reminds them of the richness of the Yiddish theatrical world that once was. From that point of view it is certainly a welcome addition to the scholarly literature on the Jewish theater. Jacob Weitzner Hunter College New York, New York</page></plain_text>
