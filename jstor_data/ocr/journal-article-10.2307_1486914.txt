Albany: State University of New York Press, 1995. xiv, 257 pp. This is an excellent, important, and pioneering work. As Robert Eisen notes, "Gersonides is the only major medieval philosopher, aside from Saadia, who produces both a major philosophical work and a body of biblical com- mentaries" (p. 5). But, as he further notes, while students of Gersonides have devoted much energy to elucidating his philosophic classic, The Wars of the Lord, they have generally neglected to examine his biblical commentaries for the light they might shed on his thought.' And the light is considerable. For at the heart of Gersonides' philosophic project is his attempt to "recast all the major Biblical categories--such as creation, providence, prophecy, and miracles-in order to bring them into line" with his acceptance of an "Aristotelian conception of God ... [as] an 1. Eisen gives generous credit to the important studies of Gersonides' exegesis by Seymour Feldman, Menahem Kellner, and Charles Touati. Although he refers in passing to the essay of Amos Funkenstein, "Gersonides' Biblical Commentary: Science, History, and Providence," in Studies on Gersonides, ed. Gad Freudenthal (Leiden: Brill, 1992), pp. 306-315, it would seem the essay appeared too late for Eisen to make any use of it. A recent important essay which makes expert use of both the Wars and the biblical commentaries is Sara Klein-Braslavy, "Prophecy, Clairvoyance, and Dreams, and the Term Hitbodedut in Gersonides' Thought" [Hebrew], Daat 39 (Summer, 1997): 23-68.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 259 impersonal being ... who has limited knowledge of events in the world below, is unable to experience a change in will, and cannot interact directly with human affairs" (p. 2). But if Gersonides' reinterpretation of the above biblical categories is to be found in the Wars, his views on the biblical concept of the Chosen People, by contrast, are developed and set forth primarily in his biblical commentaries. And the concept of election, which appears to be premised on the existence of a special personal covenantal relationship between God and Israel, would seem to pose an especially difficult challenge to Gersonides' philosophic principles. Eisen has thus not only chosen both a philosopher and a theme that are of central importance in the history of Jewish thought, but his juxtaposition of philosopher and theme is particularly suited to illuminate such broader issues as the tension between Aristotelian meta- physics and the thought world of the Bible and the rabbis that so occupied the medieval philosophers, and the interaction between philosophical speculation and biblical interpretation in the course of which both this tension and the attempts to overcome it were amply displayed. Eisen's presentation is exceptionally full and lucid, if at the price of some slight repetitiousness, and his argumentation is firmly grounded upon an exact, penetrating, and philosophically sensitive reading of all the relevant texts in both the Wars and the biblical commentaries.2 Particularly admirable, he always takes care to accord a fair hearing to the views of other scholars and similarly to indicate when the primary sources allow for multiple interpretive possibilities or are simply too obscure for the reader to be able to determine their meaning with any degree of certainty. After an introductory chapter, Eisen begins his study in chapter 2 with a survey of the philosophic material in the Wars relevant to Gersonides' under- standing of covenant, focusing in particular on his view of divine providence. He then moves from the Wars to the biblical commentaries, for it is only in those writings that Gersonides fully develops his notion of the covenant idea. Chapters 3 and 4 are devoted to Gersonides' philosophical interpretation of the patriarchal covenant and its role up to the conquest of Canaan, chapters 5 and 6 to his understanding of the Sinaitic covenant, and chapters 7 and 8 to the role played by the patriarchal covenant in Jewish history from the conquest to the messianic era. In chapter 9 Eisen seeks to account for the apparently 2. One minor correction. Eisen's translation (p. 90) of Gersonides' comment on Deut. 29:28 as "God did not command us to obey the words of the Torah just with regard to that which is overt in them" is misleading. The correct translation is "God commanded us to obey the words of the Torah only with regard to that which is overt in them" (lo... raq = lo 'ela).</page><page sequence="3">260 BOOK REVIEWS personalistic language that Gersonides uses in the biblical commentaries in describing the workings of divine providence, while the final chapter is devoted to a general analysis and assessment of Gersonides on Jewish chosenness and concluding reflections on the place of the biblical commentaries in his phi- losophy. Also treated in the book are such substantive issues as Gersonides' views on Mosaic prophecy and the messianic era and such methodological questions as the presence or absence of esotericism in his thought.3 As the preceding overview makes clear, at the heart of the book is Gerson- ides' attempt to offer a philosophically acceptable interpretation of the Sinaitic and patriarchal covenants. Gersonides' view of the Sinaitic covenant is intimately bound up with his view of the purpose of the Torah. As Eisen indicates, the Torah, for Gersonides, functions primarily "as a [philosophic] guidebook for bringing the Israelites to moral and intellectual perfection so that they can experience individual provi- dence" (p. 73). This may seem very similar to Maimonides' view of the Torah, but, as Eisen points out, Gersonides invests the commandments with "greater philosophic sophistication and contemporary significance than Maimonides does" (p. 94). Indeed, Gersonides, through a liberal use of allegorization, seeks to show how the commandments "provide instruction in all issues in natural science and metaphysics" (p. 94). We can sharpen Eisen's contrast between Maimonides and Gersonides. For Maimonides, the commandments provide "welfare of the soul," which "consists in the multitude acquiring correct opinions corresponding to their respective capacity," a capacity which does not "suffice for apprehending that subject matter [of the opinions] as it is" (Guide 3:27). (It is worth noting that Maimonides does not allegorize the commandments.) For Gersonides, who, as Eisen notes, has a greater estima- tion of the multitude's capacity than does Maimonides, the commandments, precisely by providing instruction in natural science and metaphysics, provide not just welfare of the soul but also perfection of the soul.4 In light of Gersonides' view as to the purpose of the Torah, the Sinaitic covenant, Eisen concludes, "can be easily translated into philosophic terms" 3. A comparison of Eisen's reading of Gersonides' views on the messianic era and esoteri- cism with the very different reading of Dov Schwartz would prove enlightening, but must be left for another occasion. See Dov Schwartz, Messianism in Medieval Jewish Thought [Hebrew] (Ramat-Gan: Bar-Ilan University, 1997), pp. 184-186. 4. One should also mention that Gersonides requires a much lower threshold for achieving perfection of the soul than does Maimonides. See Warren Z. Harvey, "Crescas' Critique of the Theory of the Acquired Intellect" (Ph.D. diss., Columbia University, 1975).</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 261 (p. 95). The Israelites, by observing the Torah, achieve moral and intellectual perfection, and thereby attain to individual divine providence. But, as Gerson- ides explains in Book 4 of the Wars, individual divine providence is a product of impersonal laws. "Thus, at Mount Sinai the Israelites essentially forge a covenant with impersonal providential laws, not with a personal God" (p. 95). Occupying center stage in the book, however, is not the Sinaitic covenant, but the patriarchal, particularly the Abrahamic, covenant. How, from a philo- sophical standpoint, are we to understand God's unilateral promises to Abra- ham to protect his descendants? Precisely here, Eisen shows us the intricate interplay between the Wars and the biblical commentaries. The key to un- derstanding these divine promises is provided by the doctrine of inherited providence, a concept briefly introduced in the Wars in the course of Gerson- ides' discussion of miracles. A prophet is able to perform miracles, Gersonides explains, by activating a special series of impersonal laws in order to bring about a material or spiritual good or avert a material or spiritual harm. What Eisen calls inherited providence refers to Gersonides' apparent suggestion that the prophet performs miracles on behalf of his descendants through a (not very clearly explained) time-delayed activation of this impersonal series of laws. Moreover, in the Wars Gersonides goes on to suggest that God's promise to Abraham in the covenant between the pieces that He would perform miracles on behalf of his descendants is just an imaginative way of stating that Abraham himself, after he foresaw what the future held in store for his descendants, performed these miracles on their behalf by means of inherited providence. It is only through a careful study of the biblical commentaries that we can see exactly how, in Gersonides' view, the patriarchal covenant, in other words, inherited providence, functions on behalf of Abraham's descendants. Eisen sums up his careful study as follows: Inherited providence [in Egypt] had a clearly defined role. It served as an emergency measure to rescue the Israelites when they were threatened with physical destruction . . but were not deserving of providence in their own right. [Its] role ... was also temporary. In the course of rescuing the Israelites from slavery it provided the necessary conditions for the Israelites to regain the capacity for achieving providence on their own ... by bringing miracles that would convince them to acknowledge God's existence and allow them to achieve intellectual perfection. After the conquest of Canaan, inherited providence continues to perform a series of similar functions. It comes into play as a last resort to rescue the Jews when they have disobeyed God's commandments and are threatened with</page><page sequence="5">262 BOOK REVIEWS physical destruction.... It [also] produces providential punishments ... designed to convince the Jews to re-establish their connection with God so that they can once again be protected by their own providence. (pp. 144-145)5 Eisen's conclusion here that the role ascribed by Gersonides to inherited providence is modest and limited strikes me as being exactly right. Unfor- tunately, throughout most of the book he maintains, in a contrary vein, that Gersonides envisaged a much more expanded and far-reaching role for inher- ited providence. Thus he claims that in Gersonides' view inherited providence was responsible for the giving of the Torah (pp. 63, 73, 96, 170, and 173), was similarly "responsible for the miraculous quality of Moses' legislative capabilities" (pp. 81-82), and will even ensure the coming of the Messiah (pp. 151, 155, and 171). None of these claims can be sustained. With regard to the giving of the Torah, Gersonides states that the miracles in Egypt resulted from inherited providence and, in turn, provided the Israelites with the belief in God that made them worthy of receiving the Torah. But they received the Torah on account of their faith, not on account of inherited providence, which played only an indirect role. As for the miraculous quality of Moses' legislative capabilities, even Eisen admits that Gersonides nowhere attributes it to inherited providence. Finally, for Gersonides to say that Abra- ham foresaw the coming of the Messiah and provided inherited providence as a secondary and limited measure to help preserve his descendants' existence until that day is not to say that inherited providence will actually bring about the coming of the Messiah.6 In light of all this, we cannot agree with Eisen's position that "the covenant at Sinai is seen by Gersonides as an outgrowth of the ... covenant with the Pa- triarchs," and, consequently, that it is the "providence inherited from Abraham more than other factors in Gersonides' thinking [that] accounts for the chosen status of the Jewish people" (pp. 172-173). To the contrary. Since the Sinaitic covenant, for Gersonides, is independent of the patriarchal covenant, and since it is the Torah revealed at Sinai that provides the Jewish people with both moral and intellectual perfection, it follows, to cite the succinct formulation 5. Eisen, however, at times conflates Gersonides' views on the suffering resulting from inherited providence with his views on "sufferings of love" resulting from one's own providence. 6. Interestingly enough, since for Gersonides there will be no need for inherited providence in the messianic era, and it will consequently cease to function, in this respect the messianic era will be less miraculous than present times.</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 263 of Amos Funkenstein, that "the ... law (and its fulfillment) is Israel's special providence" and the mark of their election.' In this respect, then, Gersonides is in complete agreement with Maimonides, for whom the election of Israel means first and foremost that they were the recipients of the divine Mosaic law.8 We furthermore cannot accept Eisen's suggestion that "there are striking similarities between Gersonides' notion of inherited providence and Judah Halevi's amr ilahi (p. 174), even granting Herbert Davidson's interpretation of the amr ilahi "as an external aura that envelops the people or land of Israel" (p. 175), given the limited role Gersonides ascribes to inherited providence as opposed to the central role Halevi ascribes to the amr ilahi. It goes without saying that I am only able to offer these criticisms of Eisen's view of inherited providence and suggest an alternative reading thanks to Eisen's own scrupulous deployment of all the relevant texts of Gersonides bearing on this issue. Indeed, it may be fairly said that I have done little more than cite Eisen against Eisen and draw what I believe to be some appropriate conclusions. In a recent essay Amos Funkenstein describes Gersonides' biblical com- mentaries as "dry, schematic, repetitive, and dogmatic," as exuding a "slight boredom."' It is the mark of Eisen's impressive monograph that as we come to its end, we find his contrary judgment fully compelling. One should not be deceived by the unadorned quality of Gersonides' exegetical writing. It is in these works, more than in another portion of his corpus, that we see the integration of Gersonides' many talents as scientist, philosopher, rabbinic scholar and biblical commentator. Indeed, it is here that the complexity and originality of this remarkable medieval thinker most clearly emerges. (p. 183) Lawrence Kaplan McGill University Montreal, Que. 7.
