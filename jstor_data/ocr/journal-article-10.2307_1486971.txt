<plain_text><page sequence="1">Judith Friedlander. Vilna on the Seine: Jewish Intellectuals in France Since 1968. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1990. xv, 249 pp. The general topic of the revival of Jewish identity among youth over the past three decades is standard fare in scholarly discussions of contemporary Jewry. The search for "roots" by young French Jewish intellectuals in the 1970s and 1980s, however, presents distinctive problems and challenges that have been largely ignored by social scientists and historians. As Judith Friedlander suggests in her work under review, though mirroring many of the experiences of young American Jews of the period, including the redis- covery of eastern European Jewry and the trauma of the Six-Day War, lead- ers of the Jewish revival in France were by and large products of the student</page><page sequence="2">348 BOOK REVIEWS revolt of 1968. As a result, their search for Jewish expression precluded a Zionist commitment and instead sought to reinterpret Jewish tradition in the light of "progressive" ideals and values in France. In their attempt to fashion a new Jewish identity, the former soixante-huitards also had to struggle against the tradition of cultural monolithism that has characterized French society since the Revolution of 1789. It is Friedlander's contention that the distinctive nature of the French experience has led to the development of three tendencies among young Jewish intellectuals in the past two decades: minority nationalism, "reaf- firmed assimilationism," and ultra-Orthodoxy. Though differing markedly in approach, they are united by a common cultural heritage-Jewish Lith- uania, or Lite-which, the author claims, reflects, both in its distinctive tal- mudic analytical method and in its religious and secular thought, the multi- varied ways of expressing Jewish identity in the modern world. Whether consciously or unconsciously, young French Jewish activists after 1968 were-at least symbolically-recreating Vilna on the Seine. There is little question that the revival of ethnic and religious identity among young French Jewish activists is a subject worthy of serious examina- tion. Unfortunately, Friedlander has failed miserably in her attempt. The volume consists primarily of a series of "life-stories" of an "older genera- tion" of Jews who introduced the ideas and methodology of Vilna, so the author claims, to young French Jewish activists. As an anthropologist, Friedlander may feel that simple storytelling is sufficient to reveal deep insights into collective ideas and attitudes, but the general impact of her approach is one of confusion. A serious analysis of the phenomenon of the revival of Jewish identity in France would have required an objective assess- ment of the writings and oral testimony of the leading figures and a critical evaluation of the interaction with both Jewish and French society. Instead, Friedlander has chosen to write chapter after chapter of rambling personal anecdotes of generally obscure thinkers drawn from personal interviews and secondary sources that are sprinkled with vague synopses of their percep- tions on Jewish life. At times, fact mingles with fiction as Friedlander dutifully reproduces everything she has been told or has read. A number of the misstatements are humorous. In one revealing example, for instance, she quotes a teacher of philosophy in Paris who relates that his father attended the "Ecole rab- binique de Jean Jaures" (p. 122) without realizing that the interviewee's allu-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 349 sion is not to the parent's religious training but to his fervent belief in socialism! Others, however, have no place in a scholarly work. Speaking about one woman's insistence upon reading the popular press in the 1930s, for example, the author uncritically records her malicious comment that "if bourgeois Jews in the 1930s had followed her example and looked occasion- ally at what the tabloids were printing, they would not have been so poorly prepared for the turn of events" (p. 168). The fact that the author seems to have identified personally with a number of the individuals discussed and at times seems to see their distinctive quest for a modern Jewish identity as relevant to her own developing ethnic consciousness only compounds the confusion. Obsessed with chronicling the personal histories of the founders and their modern-day proponents, Friedlander almost totally ignores the French and Jewish contexts in which the various movements and tendencies arise. How exactly do diaspora nationalists like Robert Marienstras reflect the general questioning of cultural monolithism by ethnic minorities in France? Despite their attempts to distance themselves from the Jewish "establishment," might not "reaffirmed assimilationists" like Alain Fin- kielkraut actually mirror the historical concern of French Jewry to make Jewish tradition conform to the ideals of the Enlightenment? How does the revival of ultra-Orthodoxy among former political activists like Benny Levy parallel developments in America and Israel? Finally, though a number of the individuals discussed in the book are Sephardic Jews, one wonders about the impact of ideas and movements derived from eastern Europe upon the majority of French Jews who are North African in origin. In the end, one must even question the validity of Friedlander's use of Lite as a conceptual framework. Her attempt to find a common intellectual heritage that incorporates such disparate groups as hozrey be-tshuva at the Y6shiva des Etudiants in Strasbourg, who largely deny the outside world, and members of the Cercle Gaston Cr6mieux, who sought to develop a secu- lar Jewish consciousness tied to socialist and progressive ideals, is siinply unconvincing. Indeed, the author herself seems to have recognized the futi- lity of her effort, since she includes an appendix that lists dozens of intellec- tuals who have made a contribution to French Jewish intellectual life but who seem to have little or no connection to the traditions of Lite. Ultimate- ly, Friedlander is unable to offer any lasting insights from her research. In a concluding comment that could well serve as a general assessment of her</page><page sequence="4">350 BOOK REVIEWS work, the author writes that while "some books come naturally to an end ... others merely stop, leaving the questions they raise open for further debate" (p. 184).
