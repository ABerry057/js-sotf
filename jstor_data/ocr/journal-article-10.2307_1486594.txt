<plain_text><page sequence="1">Eugene B. Borowitz. Renewing the Covenant: A Theology for the Postmod- ern Jew. Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1991. 319 pp. The fact that honesty and modesty persuade Eugene B. Borowitz to provide a lengthy bibliographical note for "readers interested in seeing the continuity and change in my ideas over these decades" (p. 307) should not mislead the unwary into thinking of this book as an assortment of old material. While many passages strike a familiar chord to those who know Borowitz's earlier work, this new book has a coherence, comprehensiveness, and insight that make it the classic expression of his thought. This preeminence derives from two major differences between this book and previous ones like A New Jewish Theology in the Making (1968) or The Mask Jews Wear (2nd ed., 1980). The first lies in its comprehensiveness. The book does not focus on only a few selected modern Jewish thinkers (both Franz Rosenzweig and Ahad Ha-am, for example, receive much fuller treatment here than in any of Borowitz's previous work) and expands to</page><page sequence="2">324 BOOK REVIEWS consider some of the most important new voices in Jewish thought, such as David Hartman, Michael Wyschogrod, and David Novak. Secondly, while earlier works use a chronological structure (from early post-Enlightenment thinkers through Borowitz's covenant theology) or an episodic one (moving from one false self-understanding of American Jews to another), this book begins with an important methodological section, raises important questions about the nature of the deity in whom Jews believe, moves to a definition of that "Israel" which is Jewish identity, and concludes with an investigation of Torah as the revealed content of Jewish belief. While summarizing this argument loses the richness of Borowitz's nuanced meetings with both Jewish thinkers and the modem Jewish reality, it shows the seriousness with which Borowitz plays what he calls a "language game" that has "a certain limited usefulness" and which gives him "personal pleasure" but which he refuses to allow to structure his life (p. 272). At the heart of his argument is the conviction that the evolution of modem Jewish life creates an opportunity for a liberal faith that balances autonomy with a serious commitment to God's covenantal demands. The first section of the book traces that evolution from the first heady days of the Enlightenment through a confrontation with the Holocaust, the June 1967 Arab-Israeli war, and the postmodern intellectualism which, he thinks, has made his thought no longer only of interest to "that small minority of Jews interested in thinking about their religion" but to "the more general experience of less abstractly inclined Jews" (p. 52). With the rationale for this appeal to a broader spectrum of Jewish readers in place, Borowitz proceeds to analyze the most perplexing questions about the divinity: what can be meant by speaking of an Absolute, of the Transcendent, of the Ineffable? What makes a conception of God Jewish? To what can the idea of God refer? How can such a deity intervene in history? His procedure is often enlightening: his five paradigms for structuring Jewish belief (pp. 62-71) help clarify modem Jewish options. His decisions, following on his foundational analysis of the condition of Jewish belief, reflect his judgment on what a postmodern liberal can believe. Thus he must reject Abraham Joshua Heschel's paradigm based on the absolute power of revelation, since those who affirm their autonomy "will find Heschel's God overbearing" (p. 132). Finally, his efforts to break the silence about God end when he finds "my mind and imagination inadequate to saying the more that my heart tells me is true" (p. 150). Borowitz turns from God not directly to Torah but to the Jewish self</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 325 with whom God interacts. Here he shows clearly the double nature of that self-both an autonomous individual and a self intrinsically united with the corporate being of Israel. Once again he shows important insights into earlier thinkers. He realizes, correctly, that whatever Martin Buber's personal life may have been, his thought can well support a traditional Jewish existence. Therefore he critiques Buber "not because I do not think the relating God incapable of authorizing a rich life of Torah" (p. 131), but because he "remained a faithful child of the Enlightenment in demanding that the self exercise final authority" (p. 214). Borowitz sees Israel today as composed of individuals who limit their autonomy through accepting the guidance of tradition. He explores the implications of this stance in a valuable study of how, from this perspective, God can be both omnipresent and in a specific place (pp. 218-219). The final section of the book focuses on those actions which constitute Jewish duty, the content of Torah. All readers will benefit from the discussion of the Documentary Hypothesis, which he calls an "academic shambles," but which still questions the literalism of many Orthodoxies (pp. 237-238). He remarks provocatively that liberal religion would not have come into being had Orthodoxies not used their power badly (p. 240). He clearly knows the issues that one must address and does not avoid even the most problematic, such as feminism, clashes with Israeli policy, and social ethics. He recognizes the need to identify the sources by which a Jew can recognize God's revelation. While Borowitz addresses those who can see themselves in his experi- ence, many who study this book will not share either his point of departure or his existential commitments. These readers may prefer to start with universal reason, with the authority of revelation, or with the psychology of the independent self. Borowitz has provided a book that illustrates his own covenant theology in a compelling way; he does not, nor does he intend to, solve every reader's questions about the meaning of God, Jewish selfhood, or the Torah. Nevertheless, the book provides an object lesson on the hard questions that must be raised, the comprehensive scholarship required, and the personal investment inevitably given when seeking to answer these questions.
