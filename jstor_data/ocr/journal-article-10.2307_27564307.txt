New York: Fordham University Press, 2005. xxxi, 761 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000682 Early in 2006, it was announced that Elliot R. Wolfson's Language, Eros, Being: Kabbalistic Hermeneutics and Poetic Imagination had won the National Jewish Book Award for scholarship. Specialists in Jewish mysticism, aware of ongoing controversies in the field, might understandably construe the book and its award as vindications of Gershom Scholem against his critics. The vindications are twofold: One relates to gender bias, the other to lyrical imagery. In Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, published in 1941, Scholem declared "that both historically and metaphysically [Jewish mysticism] is a masculine doc trine, made for men and by men."1 Wolfson adopts and refines Scholem's soci ology (388). Summarizing arguments constructed with unsurpassed erudition and philosophic sophistication in the preceding 420 pages of text and 200 pages of notes, Wolfson concludes, [T]he kabbalists ... were [unable] to overcome the androcentric bias of med ieval rabbinic culture according to which man, and not woman, was upheld as the more perfect ideal of human existence, both somatically and psychically ... it should [therefore] be clear to the nonpartisan reader that the positive attri butes associated with Shekhinah entail her masculinization ... We are thus jus tified in concluding that the role assigned the feminine in the imaginai envisioning of the divine enhances rather than diminishes the androcentric nature of kabbalistic symbolism, falling far short of what we would consider a genuine celebration of the female. (373, 385) These conclusions are bracing. To reach them, Wolfson yields to the data while resisting the allures of "political correctness" (372). He refuses to impose his own exceptionally rigorous, egalitarian, feminist ethics on rabbinic culture (448 n. 122). The second vindication of Scholem is articulated in the preface to Language, Eros, Being, in which Wolfson poignantly acknowledges Scholem's inspiration and challenge "to crafting a poetics of kabbalah" (xi). Wolfson's commitment to poetics is pervasive throughout his scholarship and undergirds the entirety of the book. As he demonstrates powerfully, a critically informed theory of poetics 1. Gershom Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (New York: Schocken Books, 1941), 37. 391</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews is the necessary precondition for the scholarly analysis of any topic in kabbalistic lore. With the help of medieval authorities, including Abraham Abulafia and Mai monides, and modem theoreticians, including Martin Heidegger, Henri Corbin, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Wolfson articulates a fully developed, phenomenolo gically inflected "linguistic rum" in intellectual history that strictly operates on the proper assumption "that human cognition is intractably dependent on the imagina tive faculty" (236). This antipositivist, premodem epistemological premise, criti cally anchored in Romanticism, the linchpin of hermeneutical theory, seems to hold both for the kabbalists themselves and the modem scholars seeking to inter pret them. Because of the book's preoccupation with poetics and gender, its appeal is not restricted to specialists in Kabbalah studies. Neither is its appeal restricted to specialists in comparative mysticism who are sure to be fascinated by Wolfson's explorations of affinities between Kabbalah, Sufism, and Buddhism. Language, Eros, Being also abounds with masterful accounts of continental philosophy and comparative religion studies, including dazzling treatments of premodem asceti cism in Judaism and Christianity. Alone, the sustained expositions of the androgyne motif and "veil" imagery make this book indispensable. Partly because of the seam less integration of all of these topics and diverse methodologies, the book marks profound and salutary shifts in intellectual life, including Wolfson's rare staging of promising conversations between the humanities and the natural sciences (xxi). No less significantly, Language, Eros, Being and its National Jewish Book Award signal profound shifts in Jewish studies. In the late nineteenth century, as Wissenschaft des Judentums was reaching its classical apogee, Heinrich Graetz, always studious but occasionally irate, surveyed the entire historical landscape. He was appalled by the phenomenon of Jewish mysticism. Among his principal objections to Kabbalah were its displacement of philosophic rationality with "fantastic pictures and symbols," or "fantastic and even blasphemous chimeras," and its "constant use of coarse expressions, often verging on the sensual, in contra distinction to the chaste, pure spirit pervading Jewish literature."2 Despite his antagonism, Graetz often proved to be a reliable guide. Summarizing Moses de Leon's "absurd, sometimes even blasphemous and immoral" perversions, Graetz observed that, according to the Zohar, "all laws of the Torah are to be considered as parts and constituents of a higher world; they resolve themselves into the mys teries of the masculine and feminine principle (positive and negative). Only when both parts meet, does the higher unity arise. Consequently, whenever any one trans gresses one of the laws, he obscures the brilliant image of the higher world."3 Read against the backdrop of Graetz's opinions, Language, Eros, Being reveals the changes, constants, and work still to be done in scholarship. Today, after more than a hundred years of revolutionary developments in society and scholarly habits of mind, scholars no longer police "perversions," and Jewish 2.

Ibid., 4:15. 392</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews mysticism no longer appalls. Building on the foundations established by Gershom Scholem and Isaiah Tishby, leading historians such as Moshe Idel, Yehuda Liebes, and Elliot R. Wolfson have reversed Graetz's assumptions that Kabbalah is mar ginal to authentic Judaism, that poetic imagination is inferior to intellectual clarity, that earthy symbols are less dignified than abstract concepts, and that the poetics of embodied sensuality is both an embarrassment to refined morality and a subject unworthy of scholarly attention. On the other hand, almost all contemporary scho lars have retained Graetz's fascination with gender and sexuality despite their diverse reactions to his sexist affiliation of the positive with masculinity and the negative with femininity. That the erotic and the feminine continue to attract scho larly attention, long after Graetz's prudish sexism seems to have lost its bourgeois allure, is indicated by the long list of contemporary authorities who have addressed the issues. The list is conveniently assembled by Moshe Idel in a monograph pub lished in 2005, Kabbalah and Eros. After naming no fewer than twenty-three "of the most important and recent contributors on the topic of eros and sexuality in Kabbalah," Idel notes the "especially important [and] singular contributions of Yehuda Liebes, Charles Mopsik, and Elliot Wolfson."4 The timing did not allow Idel to include the appearance of Language, Eros, Being. The book, includ ing its 115 pages of thoroughly digested bibliography, is no exception to the rule of "especially important and singular." On this score, Idel is certainly correct. Wolfson, Mopsik, Liebes, and Idel have all produced prodigies of erudite scholarship in Kabbalah studies, especially in the interrelated subfields of gender, sexuality, imagination, hermeneutics, and poetics. Wolfson's contributions are nevertheless distinctive. In Language, Eros, Being, he persuasively insists that "the overtly feminine characteristics of the divine in kabbalistic texts do not in and of themselves instruct us about a positive valence imputed to the female gender by medieval mystics ... the feminine images must be seen as part of an androcentric, indeed phallocentric perspective whereby the female is conceived ontically (and this is a biological as well as a metaphysical assumption) as part of the masculine" (332). Also distinctive is Wolfson's at homeness in critical theory, feminist historiography, and comparative religion. His virtuosity calls to mind the words used by Scholem in dedicating Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism to Walter Benjamin: "whose genius unite[s] the insight of the Metaphysician, the interpretive power of the Critic and the erudition of the Scholar." One is also tempted to say that Wolfson's Language, Eros, Being is alchemical: Amazingly, it transforms the base metals of hermetically sealed Jewish studies into the gold of exoteric humanities.
