What is even more remark- able is that this process took a relatively short time to come to fruition: It is widely agreed that at the death of the Ba'al Shem Tov (who is often still regarded as the founder of the movement) in 1760, his circle numbered no more than a few dozen initiates, but by the 1820s, the movement had become dominant in the Jewish society of large swathes of eastern Europe, par- ticularly Ukraine and Galicia.' Many different explanations for this success have been proposed: Hasidism's attraction has been variously perceived as a result of its being a movement of religious revival and reform, a movement of social protest and class struggle, a movement popularizing elite Jewish mys- tical thought, and a movement of social reconstruction.2 In terms of social structure, all scholars agree that Hasidism's main innovation-and a major factor in its success-was the creation of the figure of the zaddik: a charismatic spiritual leader who acts as an intermediary between the individual hasid and God and provides answers to all problems, whether they are spiritual or 1.

In particular, I shall focus on the ways in which the new movement overcame the geographic barriers separating Jews in different parts of eastern Europe. The importance of geographic factors in the historical process is a concept that was emphasized most famously in the work of Fernand Braudel and the Annales school. In his study of the Mediterranean world during the age of Philip II, Braudel argued that the study of geography "helps us to rediscover the slow unfolding of structural realities in the long term ... it helps us to discover the almost imperceptible movement of history."5 This use of geography to under- stand the longue durte of historical progression was undoubtedly the most famous use Braudel made of the discipline in his research.6 But there was another way in which he saw geography as important to the historian. In his chapter dealing with the Mediterranean as a human unit, he wrote, "This human unit is not merely the result of nature ... the human Mediterranean only exists in so far as human inge- nuity, work, and effort continually re-create it ... [and it] has no unity but that created by the movements of men, the relationships they imply, and the routes they follow."7 What he was suggesting is that there is an interplay between human and geographic factors in history. Geographic factors certainly play a role in determining human behavior, but at the same time, it is only human activity that gives the geographic unit historical significance. Examining this interplay focused Braudel's vision on the shorter cycles of early modem Mediterranean history and allowed him to understand historical developments in the specific time and place in which he was interested. This second insight may lie at the heart of the important role geography has also played in the realm of cultural studies. In this field, geography is understood in terms of the way a given culture understands its geographic surroundings and 3.

Knopf, 1932). 7. Braudel, The Mediterranean, 276. 2</page><page sequence="3">Hasidism and the Challenge of Geography the meaning it gives to them. This idea is reiterated in the work of another French scholar, Pierre Nora, in his studies of lieux de memoire, in which he identified geography and geographic features as one of the French nation's repositories of memory.8 Following Nora, much research has focused on cultural constructions of geographic features.9 However, those interested in this kind of cultural history have paid little attention to geographic factors as such and the effects they might have had on the development of a given culture, focusing most atten- tion on the significance that humans have attached to place. This approach seems to embody the view that the only meaning geography has is that which culture gives it, and so it seems to have moved away from Braudel's description of the interplay between the geographic and the human in history.'0 Surprisingly enough, though Jewish history has a very broad geographic scope, the effects of geographic factors on the development of Jewish society and culture have remained largely unexamined until quite recently." Jews have been widely understood to have had a physical geography in terms of (among other things) demographic and settlement patterns and also acknowledged to have had a cultural geography where they created for themselves various, more or less distinct "cultural zones."12 Moreover, geographic displacement (whether by expulsion or migration) has often been understood as having been formative in the development of Jewish life.'3 Yet very little attention has been paid to the ways in which the geography of the places in which Jews settled might have 8.

It should, of course, be noted that for Nora, geographic phenomena were only one (and by no means the most important) lieu de memoire. 9. One such study that deals with the cultural significance of Polish geography, among other things, is Simon Schama, Landscape and Memory (New York: A. A. Knopf, 1996), 37-74. 10. In Schama's formulation, "Landscapes are culture before they are nature; constructs of the imagination projected onto wood and water and rock." Ibid., 61.

The one field of Jewish studies in which geographic research is extremely plentiful is the study of the historical geogra- phy of the Land of Israel. 12. See, for example, the work done on the different cultural zones of the Jewish world, particu- larly the Ashkenazic Jewish world, as part of Max Weinreich's work on Yiddish linguistic geography: "Ashkenaz in di general gerem fun der yiddisher velt," Di Goldene Keit 50 (1964): 172-82.

Two of the greatest Jewish historians of previous generations, Simon Dubnow and Ben-Zion Dinur, constructed complete schemes of Jewish history around geographic displacements and concepts of moving "Jewish centers."

It is certainly true that the vast majority of studies on Jewish historical geography deal in one way or another with the Land of Israel.16 With the development of cultural studies in recent years, this situation has begun to change. There has been much interest in the ways in which Jewish culture in the Diaspora developed through interaction with surrounding cultures-even in places where the connections there might have been between them are not obvious.17 In terms of geography, research has been done, for example, on cultural constructions of landscape and on the building of Jewish public memorials.'8 However, once again, the emphasis on cultural construction of geographic meaning has downplayed the effect of geography on Diaspora Jewish life. It should be noted, however, that geographic factors, though they varied from place to place, were a constant with which every Jewish society- like every other human society-had to deal. In terms of the interplay between geographic and human elements in cultural development, the Polish historian Antoni M4czak returned to something close to Braudel's concept in his 1989 paper "The Commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania in the Late Seventeenth Century: An Essay in Interpretation of Space."19 Focusing largely on the ways in which Poland-Lithuania's geographic structure affected Life and Colonization in Europe and the New World (16th-18th Centuries)," in Moreshet Sepharad: The Sephardi Legacy, ed. Haim Beinart II (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1992), 365-98. 14. A relatively new departure in this field is research on so-called Port Jews, whose social and cultural development is supposed to have been determined to a great extent by their life in the particular geographic setting of port cities. See Lois Dubin, The Port Jews ofHabsburg Trieste: Absolutist Politics and Enlightenment Culture (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1999); and David Cesarani, "Port Jews: Concepts, Cases, and Questions," Jewish Cultural History 4, no. 2 (2001): 1-11.

The main question I shall be asking, therefore, is to what extent the geographic con- ditions in which the hasidic movement came into being influenced the course of its development as a social movement.22 This means that the following discus- sion will not take the form of a discourse on historical geography as it is usually understood, but rather an analysis of the administrative and social deve- lopment of Hasidism in its geographical context. The particular focus will be the ways in which the new movement overcame the problems of communication posed by Polish geography to establish an administrative system that allowed its leaders (zaddikim, or "righteous ones") to extend their control over the masses of eastern European Jewry in the Ukraine, Galicia, Belorussia, and central Poland.23 METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES Research into the social structures of the early hasidic movement is marked by a significant methodological problem. Because the early hasidim seem to have regarded their movement in purely religious or theological terms, their writings deal extensively with issues drawn from the Jewish mystical tradition, whereas the construction of new social institutions was ignored. In addition, almost no 20. M4czak, "The Commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania in the Late Seventeenth Century," 18. 21.

This development is discussed in Rapoport-Albert's study on structural continuity and change in the hasidic movement after 1772 (see note 1) and in Glenn Dynner's recent doctoral disser- tation on the development of Hasidism at the turn of the nineteenth century: "'Men of Silk': The Hasidic Conquest of Polish Jewry, 1754-1830" (PhD diss., Brandeis University, 2002), I-II. 23. I shall not deal directly with the problems that the political boundaries in eastern European imposed on the transnational hasidic movement. In this context, it should be noted that the decentra- lized administrative strategy adopted by Hasidism was extremely helpful in allowing the movement to function in different political environments. 5</page><page sequence="6">Adam Teller hasidic archival materials documenting the activity of the early centers have been preserved.24 Thus, the main sources for understanding the social development of early Hasidism are those written by the movement's enemies-initially the mitnagdim, later the maskilim. These sources should always be read with an under- standing of the sometimes irrational hostility these groups felt toward Hasidism- a hostility that often colored their narratives.25 In addition, the nonexistence of hasidic administrative sources makes it extremely difficult to determine whether the development of the movement's social structures was the result of a consciously planned policy. Though the surviv- ing sources do permit a reconstruction of the ways the new movement dealt with the geographic challenges of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, they reveal little or nothing of any conscious organizational planning that may have gone into this process. Therefore, the question as to whether it was the result of carefully planned policy or improvisation must remain moot. Having said that, hasidic literature does deal with a number of key aspects of the hasidic social system-in particular, the figure of the zaddik, the pidyonot pay- ments made to him, and questions of pilgrimage. But it discusses them exclusively in terms of concepts drawn from the Jewish mystical tradition, ignoring their con- temporary social significance. This has led scholars to assume that the very deve- lopment of these phenomena was a result of theological factors alone.26 Research on social movements has warned, however, against drawing too close a connection between their ideologies and their structures and strategies.27 Following this line, 24.

A number of studies have explored the Jewish sources for the hasidic administrative system, particularly those by Ada Rapoport-Albert, Arthur Green, and Haviva Pedaya, in which the traditional Jewish sources for this system are identified and examined.

"New movements often arise in response to a crisis situation or a long history of more subtle grievances, and find themselves embroiled in action long before they develop elaborate concepts of where they want to go, let alone how to get there. Once an ideology begins to form, it may redirect the group's strategy, or it may merely confirm it. In either case there is not the simple linear relationship 6</page><page sequence="7">Hasidism and the Challenge of Geography I shall argue here that because the integration of patterns drawn from non-Jewish society with ideas from within the Jewish tradition has always been the way in which the Jewish world has renewed its social structures, it should come as no surprise that this is what happened in the hasidic movement, too. Jewish society traditionally explained its own development with a range of arguments drawn almost exclusively from within Judaism, but this contemporary bias should not cause us to ignore clear influences from the non-Jewish environment that acted on the Jewish world.28 Comparative examination of other mass social movements can show how those movements come to grips with the problems of mobilizing and retaining fol- lowers, and thus they allow at least some insight into the development of Hasidism even without the records of the movement's founders.29 Modern sociological research has argued that social movements often achieve great success and mobilize large numbers of followers by making use of social structures, strategies, and ideologies from their immediate environment.30 In fact, the way that such between ideology and strategy that is so often assumed."

Mayer N. Zald and John D. McCarthy (Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1988), 167. This perspective seems to warn against viewing the hasidic movement as just another development in the Jewish mystical tra- dition and explaining its appearance simply as the outcome of preceding concepts and ideas. Following Freeman, it would seem more convincing to argue that the characteristics of Hasidism as a social move- ment developed through the interplay of the needs of eighteenth-century Polish Jewish society, the organizational possibilities presented by its immediate environment, and the concepts provided by the Jewish mystical tradition. 28. David Biale, "Preface," in Cultures of the Jews, xvii-xxxiii. In the sociological literature, this process is termed framing, meaning "the conscious, strategic efforts of movement groups to fashion meaningful accounts of themselves and the issues at hand in order to motivate and legitimate their efforts." See Doug McAdam, "The Framing Function of Movement Tactics: Strategic Dramaturgy in the American Civil Rights Movement," in Comparative Perspectives on Social Movements: Political Opportunities, Mobilizing Structures, and Cultural Framings, ed. Doug McAdam et al. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), 338-55, here 339. 29. I have found the sociological literature dealing with the development of "new social move- ments" helpful in understanding some of the dynamics of the development of social movements. Though the movements discussed generally functioned during and after the 1960s, the scholarship on them provides a conceptual framework that is of value in trying to understand the development of a social movement such as Hasidism. See Craig Calhoun, "'New Social Movements' of the Early Nineteenth Century," Social Science History (1993): 385-427. Cf. Francois Guesnet, Polnische Juden im 19. Jahrhundert: Lebensbedingungen, Rechtsnormen und Organisation im Wandel (Koeln: Boehlau, 1998), 116. Of particular importance here are the concepts of "resource mobilization" and "framing" (for their use here, see below). In fact, as Oberschall has shown, the intellectual endeavor of trying to understand the development and functioning of social movements itself dates back to the eighteenth century; see Social Conflict and Social Movements (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1973), 1-29. 30.

THE HASIDIC MOVEMENT AND POLISH GEOGRAPHY Because the topic here is the interplay between geographic conditions and the development of the hasidic movement, it is important at the outset to take stock of Poland's geographic structure. During the period when Hasidism began to develop (before the first partition of Poland), the Polish-Lithuanian Common- wealth extended over a huge area of some 750,000 square kilometers stretching from the Oder River in the west to the Dnieper in the east and from the Baltic coast in the north to within a few hundred kilometers of the Black Sea in the south. Poland's major geographic formations largely followed an east-west axis: The Carpathian Mountains formed the country's southern border from Silesia in the west to Ukraine in the east, where they turn southward; after the Car- pathian foothills is the Subcarpathian depression, stretching from Krakow in the west to the eastern bank of the Dniester River in the east; to the north of this, the uplands of Little Poland, which form part of the Silesian heights, run into the Lublin heights, which are joined to the Podolian table land and the great Ukrai- nian steppe platform; finally, the great plains in the center of Poland form part of the zone of lowlands that cross the north of central Europe from end to end.32 These east-west formations were crossed by Poland-Lithuania's river system, which ran along a north-south axis: the Warta, Vistula, and Niemen rivers flow north into the Baltic, and the Dniester and Dnieper rivers flow south into the Black Sea. The San, a major tributary of the Vistula, flows into it from the east, rising in the Carpathian foothills not far from Przemysl, though it does not penetrate deeply into Ukraine.33 This situation made east-west communi- cations rather problematic because land travel, though possible, was difficult over long distances, and the rivers provided the best arteries of communication. This situation was felt particularly in Ukraine in the deep south-east of the kingdom, which was quite isolated from Poland's major social and cultural centers. 31.

Partly as a result of this geographic structure, power in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was largely decentralized. Even the central parliament, the Sejm, found it difficult to stamp its authority over the vast distances of the whole kingdom.38 In fact, in large measure, power lay in the hands of the great magnate landowners, who ran their estates like small kingdoms and brooked inter- ference from no one, least of all the monarch.39 It is noteworthy that the largest and most important of these estates were situated in the eastern regions of the common- wealth, particularly in Ukraine and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania-the very regions where Hasidism first developed. The Jews, too, had to deal with the problems posed by the huge extent of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Most communities adopted the same solution as the state administrative system they were a part of by adapting themselves to its decentralized power structure and basing their existence on community privileges granted by a noble with local authority.40 On the other hand, the communities in Poland's various regions did band together to form regional councils (in Hebrew, va 'adei galil), with the aim of dealing with the division of the tax burden and legi- slating on matters of regional significance. This seems to have been an attempt to overcome the distances separating the different communities in a single region by creating a single body to represent them all. Though these councils met at a central 34. Maria Bogucka and Henryk Samsonowicz, Dzieje miast i mieszczanistwa w Polsceprzedroz- biorowej (Warsaw-Wroclaw: Ossolineum, 1986). 35.

Communal leaders would travel to the fair, combining business with public service, but the decisions they made there only came into force when they were ratified by their home communities on their return.41 This was also the case with the central council of Polish Jews the so-called Council of Four Lands or Jewish Sejm-which met at the great fairs in Lublin and Jaroslaw.42 Although the prestige of these supracommunal bodies generally meant that individual communities accepted their rulings, they were never able to coerce recalcitrant communities. Thus, for all its successes in creating supracommunal bodies to represent the Jews in different communities, Polish Jewry (like the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth itself) did not find a way of uniting its far-flung communities into a properly cohesive framework. Not unsurprisingly, this problem was particularly felt in the vast expanses of Ukraine, with its large number of very small communities. Even the formation of a supracommunal council in this region met with serious difficulties.43 Nevertheless, it was precisely in this region that the hasidic movement began its development and so had to deal with the problems raised by creating an organizational structure to reach-and retain-followers spread over great dis- tances. Interestingly enough, its first attempts to do so were not undertaken by the figure usually credited as the founder of the movement-the Ba'al Shem Tov (also known by his acronym as "the Besht"). In his day, the hasidim had been a small, elite group, not much interested in attracting followers from outside their own social circle.44 Though the Besht traveled around his native Podolia as part of his trade as a popular healer, and on one occasion got as far as Stuck in Lithuania, there is no evidence that he was a particularly well-known figure during his life- time (or that he had any pretensions in that direction).45 In fact, the first hasidic leader to come to terms with the challenge posed by Poland's geography was Dov Ber, known as the Maggid of Mezhirech, perhaps the Besht' s most important pupil. Following his teacher's death and the development his own center of activity in Mezhirech, Dov Ber changed the way hasidic life was organized and thus radically altered the direction in which the movement developed. 41.

However, this immedi- ately confronted him with a problem of geography. How could he spread the word of the new movement outside his immediate environment? His first solution was to send representatives of various kinds to different regions of Poland, with the aim of attracting new followers.46 In his memoirs, Solomon Maimon describes his meeting with such a representative, who was traveling throughout Lithuania spreading the word about the new movement.47 The new ideas he heard so inspired him that he was moved to leave his family and travel for weeks to reach Dov Ber's court in Wolyn to meet the great man in person. Despite its success in attracting Maimon (and many others of his generation), this attempt to deal with the challenge of Polish geography did not present a model that would ensure the spread of the new idea and the attraction of new adherents over wide areas. With the benefit of hindsight, it seems clear that the movement's further growth would have been limited by the small number of emissaries avail- able to Dov Ber, the difficulties of communication between the various localities and Mezhirech itself, and the creation of a bottleneck at his home, where he received prospective hasidim from among the almost 1,000,000 Polish-Lithuanian Jews. During the next stage in the hasidic movement's geographic expansion, Dov Ber's disciples moved out of his immediate sphere to found their own courts throughout Ukraine and in Poland generally. This they did while Dov Ber was still alive, and all the more so after his death.48 By the turn of the nineteenth century, hasidic centers had sprung up in Berdyczew, Miqdzyb6z, Braclaw, Czernobyl, Zlocz6w, Lezajsk, Przysucha, Sochaczew, Lublin, Witebsk, Karlin- Piisk, and Liady, among other places-thus covering Ukraine, Galicia, central Poland, Belorussia, and Lithuania.49 Regardless of whether it was the result of con- scious planning, this development solved a number of the geographic issues men- tioned previously. Instead of one center, there was now a widespread network; the question of communication was solved by having centers closer than Mezhirech, to which adherents in different parts of the country could travel; and each court could, if necessary, appoint its own emissaries to attract followers.5? In time, these courts 46. Rapoport-Albert, "Hasidism after 1772," 94-101. 47. Solomon Maimon, Solomon Maimon: An Autobiography, trans. J. Clark Murray (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2001), 163-67. Maimon also mentions one of the hasidic leaders who "tra- velled in Poland as a missionary" (ibid., 170, n.). This individual is usually identified as Aharon of Karlin (the town where he would eventually settle and establish his base), one of the Maggid's disciples and himself a major hasidic leader.

Moreover, as the movement developed, some of these courts spawned new, filial courts, allowing for exponential growth. This success, however, aroused a number of geographic problems, most prominently, ensuring that the new adherents to the movement remained loyal to it following their return from a visit to the court, which could be many miles distant from their homes. Thus, Hasidism's "conquest" of Poland's geography was only completed with the creation of a stable administrative apparatus that ensured the connection between the zaddik in his court and his followers in the various communities where they lived and provided the hasidim with local institutions to which they could belong. The problems that the nascent hasidic movement faced in its attempt to deal with the huge geographic distances that separated its members and their leaders were by no means felt only by them. In fact, as they tried to come to terms with these problems, the early hasidim were able to see how other groups and institutions (both Jewish and non-Jewish) in their immediate environment had dealt with them.51 In the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, there were at least three major administrative apparatuses that worked over large geographic distances in the second half of the eighteenth century: that of the state itself, that of the magnates in their estates, and that of the church. Each dealt in its own way with the problem of controlling populations across vast spaces. Moreover, in geographic terms, these were overlapping systems- that is to say, any individual settlement was at one and the same time incorpor- ated into the state apparatus and a part of the church's geographic network and, if privately owned, also part of a noble estate. Therefore, all three would have been familiar to most inhabitants of Poland at that time. This being so, it comes as little surprise that the hasidic leaders made use of elements of all three systems when they began to create their own administrative apparatus aimed at strengthening their control over the vast spaces of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Therefore, the following discussion will examine and analyze the parallels between the administrative systems functioning in the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth in Hasidism's formative years and those the new movement developed for itself as it began to hold sway over the vast geographic regions of eastern Europe. The State Administrative System and the Jewish Community Of the three systems, the state administrative system probably had the least to offer the hasidic movement. By the second half of the eighteenth century, it was in 51. In addition, there were also historical examples of Jewish structures of authority that had functioned over large geographic distances-most prominently, the early medieval geonim. There is no evidence, however, that the hasidic movement was influenced by the example of the geonim. A rather closer example of a Jewish administrative network that covered large geographical distances was the Council of Four Lands in Poland. On its relevance for the development of the hasidic movement, see below. 12</page><page sequence="13">Hasidism and the Challenge of Geography deep crisis.52 Despite the best efforts of Poland's last king, the reformer Stanislaw August, the central organs of state power were not able to impose their will on the nobles who held the highest administrative posts (particularly the starostas and the wojewodas) in the various regions. Because these men were mostly scions of magnate families-and great estate owners in their own right-they tended to use their offices to further their own personal and family agendas. In addition, the local assemblies of nobles-the sejmiki-which enjoyed a measure of regional authority and went through something of a revival in this period, tended to be dominated by these same magnate families, often being reduced to little more than a tool for achieving their private goals.53 The central Sejm was almost totally paralyzed because of the liberum veto voting system it used, whereby one dissenting voice led to its dissolution.54 This form of organized anarchy was so widespread that a new proverb was invented to explain its importance: Polska nierzqdem stoi (Poland exists through disorganization). Even the improve- ments in Poland's political system that were adopted during the four-year Sejm from 1788 to 1792 and aimed at lessening the anarchy proved short-lived and came to nothing after the second and third partitions in 1793 and 1795, at which time the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ceased to exist.55 The Jewish communities, which generally served as part of Poland's admini- strative apparatus, also suffered from severe dysfunction during this period. As in the rest of the state apparatus, the communities' problems seem to have been caused by the transfer of authority from the communal institutions to the magnates or to the individuals and groups who had their support.56 The communities continued to function because the magnates and the upper nobility used them as part of their administrative network, but wealthier members could always bypass communal decisions that were not to their liking by turning directly to powerful local noblemen and arguing that their business would be adversely affected. The noblemen, fearing that their income might be harmed, would often support the individual against the community. The consequence was that, although they continued to exist, the Jewish autonomous bodies suffered an erosion of their authority over Jewish society. This problem was felt not only 52.

One of the most important of the reforms aimed at extending the geographic range of the state's power was the establishment of the so-called Komisje cywilno-wojskowe (civil military commis- sions) in various Polish regions in 1789. These commissions were supposed to set up a stable regional administrative apparatus on a local basis but functioned only until 1792.

Polish Jewry's organs of regional and national autonomy (the supracommu- nal bodies) were also in terminal decline, hard hit by the 1764 decision of the new Polish monarch to abolish the central council as part of his policy of overhauling Poland's tax system. The abolition of the central va'ad led to a major debt crisis for Polish Jewry, whose public institutions had borrowed heavily during the eighteenth century by taking long-term, low-interest loans, called widerkauf, which they did not expect to have to return in one lump. The demands for repay- ment, which came in the wake of the council's abolition, and the consequent loss of confidence in all Jewish autonomous bodies, led to a major financial crisis that overtook all the Jewish regional institutions.60 Though there are signs that these Jewish regional bodies continued to function to a certain degree after 1764, their loss of prestige meant that they ceased to be of much significance in Jews' daily lives. It was the local communities that, despite the diminution of their auth- ority, continued to play the major role in administering Jewish daily life.61 The paralysis of much of Poland's state apparatus probably meant that it did not provide a promising model for the hasidic leaders, and the Jewish communal system did little better. However, it is important to note that the hasidic movement did make use of existing communal institutions to create social frameworks on a local basis for their followers. This was not done in direct fashion, however. It usually began as a process of withdrawal, by which the hasidim set up their own separate institutions. Once they had gathered enough strength in their locality, 57.

The best-known example of this phenomenon is the issue of the slaughter of kosher meat. One of the movement's principles was the refusal of hasidim to eat meat slaughtered by those who did not identify with them.62 Though there was a clear religious basis for this stance, it had the social effect of establishing the hasidim as a separate group in society and allowing for a measure of group identi- fication. This grew stronger when the communal authorities attacked the separate hasidic slaughter because it undercut the communal monopoly on slaughtering. However, because income from the tax on kosher meat, called the kropka, was a crucial part of every community's budget, as the numbers of hasidim grew, separate slaughter eventually gave them important economic leverage over the community. Within a short time, their insistence on separate slaughter allowed them to negotiate their way into positions of power and influence within their local communities. As the maskil Joseph Perl put it in a memorandum to the Galician authorities in 1838, "It is through the slaughterers that the zaddikim have acquired power over the communities."63 Another means of gaining control of local communities, documented by the nineteenth-century Jewish memoirist and maskil. Avraham Ber Gottlober, was through the institutions of prayer. He described the process in the following terms: "When new, the hasidim did not manage to institute their new customs, including their ... confused form of prayer ... other than in their own, small prayer-houses, called 'kloiz'. Slowly, as they grew stronger, they brought their customs into the study hall; [though] it was only in the shtetlach ... that they managed to conquer the synagogue."64 Here, too, the hasidim started by with- drawing from the recognized communal institutions and establishing their own to pray according to their own rituals (and presumably also to coalesce as a 62.

"Durch die Schaechter gewinnen die Rabis [!] eine Machte ueber die Gemeinden." He even went so far as to claim that it was only a matter of time before all the Galician slaughterers would owe allegiance to the hasidic movement: "Ist in Galizien schon gegenwartig fast kein Schaechter zu finden, der nicht ein Mitgleid der Sekte oder doch wenigstens ihr gegeben seyn sollte, und bald wird kein ein- ziger mehr zu finden seyn, der nicht ganz der Sekte angehoeren sollte." Despite the obvious exagge- ration here, it does seem clear that control of the slaughterers was an important part of the hasidic "conquest of the communities."

This was the case in Radoszkowicze, where, in 1800, the local Society for the Study of the Talmud and the Mishnah forbade hasidim to join. However, by the end of the decade, the hasidim in the town had become so numerous that the ruling forbidding them to join the society had to be repealed. Thus, despite the initial ban, in the long run, the hasidim were able to infiltrate the local study society and thus ensure their recognition among the community's elite-those who used the communal study hall.67 Finally, by the turn of the nineteenth century, various hasidic leaders seem to have been making efforts to acquire rabbinic and other communal posts, if not for themselves, then for loyal followers. An early example of this phenomenon can been seen in Pifisk during the 1780s, when the hasidic leader Levi Yitzhak (later known as the "Berditchever") became community rabbi. In 1784, he was deposed and the virulently antihasidic Avigdor ben Haim was appointed in his place. Finally, the hasidim in the town succeeded in having Rabbi Avigdor removed and replaced in 1807 with what seems to have been a compromise can- didate who was acceptable to both sides.68 In other places, the zaddik entered into a formal agreement with the community-the so-called ktav maggidut--which enshrined his authority over communal institutions, allowing him, among other things, to appoint the rabbi.69 In his antihasidic satire, Joseph Perl poked fun at 65. The opponents of Hasidism during the 1820s tried to persuade the Polish authorities to outlaw Hasidism on the grounds that its proponents organized these separate prayer houses, also called shtiblech, thus withdrawing from the legally recognized Jewish communities. After some initial discussion, the authorities did not accept the argument and the hasidim were allowed to continue in this practice. See the sources in Mahler, Hahasidut vehahaskalah, 475-502; Guesnet, Polnische Juden, 264-69; and Wodzifiski, Oiwiecenie iydowskie, 91-95. 66. The separate prayer houses continued to exist as purely hasidic institutions-even in those communities where the hasidim had "conquered" the major communal institutions. 67. Halperin, Yehudim veyahadut bemizrah 'eiropah, 313-32. I use the term "elite" in the broadest sense of all those willing and able to devote time to study in the communal study hall. Within this group, there were many gradations, but it seems to me that all those with the knowledge and time to study (as well as the money to pay dues to a study society) made up the community's upper stratum. 68.

Zederbaum, Keter Kehuna, (Odessa: 1866): 134-35. 16</page><page sequence="17">Hasidism and the Challenge of Geography these kind of appointments: "So as to assign some rabbi to your community, our rebbe the zaddik said to accept Reb Shmerl, the son-in-law of Reb Yankev Leyb of your community. Our rebbe, he should live, said explicitly, 'Even though this Reb Shmerl has a few small shortcomings in matters of stealing and fornication, all the same he has a great and good soul and he'll be good for us.'"70 The Polish archival record confirms the existence of such appointments and thus suggests that Perl's satire may have had a serious undertone to it. The transfer of rabbinic appointments to the purview of the zaddik seems to have undermined the rabbi's authority over his community. Documents submitted by maskilim to the Komitet Starozakonnych in Warsaw during the mid-1820s described the poor status of the traditional rabbi in hasidic eyes: "Though they [the hasidim] have many people proficient in the Talmud, they really do not respect the regular rabbis at all, considering them hypocrites and lacking in piety."71 The maskil Abraham Gottlober went even further, claiming that "many [hasidim] have deviated from the ways of the Talmud and the rabbis and pay no heed to the words of the great poskim whenever even the least of the zaddikim disagrees with them."72 Despite the exaggeration here, it seems clear that the hasidic conquest of the communities had made the rabbi a figure of secondary importance, if that. True spiritual authority now resided outside the community-with the zaddik.73 The fact that the hasidic movement expended such time and energy infiltrat- ing community institutions and community life seems to be an indication that it continued to view these bodies as the basic administrative unit of Jewish society. This meant that it was not in the hasidic leaders' best interests to ignore them but rather to make use of them for their own ends. Thus, their goal was not to strengthen the institutions of Jewish autonomy but, because Jewish commu- nities existed wherever there were concentrations of Jews, to exploit them to help their movement take root over large areas.74 On Zederbaum's life and maskilic activity, particularly in the realm ofjournalism, see A.

Both groups used the communities as a tool to strengthen their control over the local Jewish population while at the same time ensuring that they themselves were an external source of authority, much more powerful than the communal institutions they were exploiting. Thus, neither the zaddikim nor the magnates tried to destroy the organs of Jewish autonomy but rather ensured that the office- holders were loyal to them and that individual Jews could, if they wanted, bypass the communities and turn directly to them to solve pressing problems. Estate Administration and the Hasidic Court Both the magnate in his estate and the zaddik among his followers faced the problem of having to control a large population spread out over wide tracts of ter- ritory. It should be stressed, however, that the basis of the authority wielded by the two was entirely different. The zaddik's power was based on his charisma (either personal or inherited) and was essentially spiritual in nature.75 The magnate, on the other hand, based his authority on his legal and political status, and his rule was absolute. Having said that, the geographic challenges both faced were remark- ably similar.76 The great magnate latifundia were rarely one tract of land; rather, they were composed of a range of different estates, often hundreds of miles apart from one another. In the same way, the zaddik generally did not rule over a single community or district but had followers spread over wide distances. Because the eastern regions of Poland-Lithuania, where Hasidism first grew and flourished, were the major setting for the magnate latifundia, it is not surpris- ing that the hasidic leaders adopted a number of measures from estate adminis- tration as they developed their own means of controlling their people. One of the most prominent of these was the establishment of central courts from which to rule. In fact, the very word court (in Hebrew, hazer), which came to be used to describe the zaddik's center in the nineteenth century, seems to have been a direct translation of the Polish word dwor, the term used for the estate owner's residence. In the case of the magnates, these courts were very often large and imposing buildings, akin to palaces, in which they lived in great luxury, together 246-43, esp. 241-42. For an approach closer to that adopted here, see Israel Bartal and David Assaf, "Shtadlanut ve'ortodoksiyah: Zadikei polin bemifgash 'im hazemanim hahadashim," in Zadikim ve'anshei ma 'aseh.: Mehkarim behasidut polin, ed. Rachel Elior et al. (Jerusalem: Mossad Bialik, 1994), 65-90. 75. See note 3. 76. It is worth noting here that many Jews serving as arendarze (leasers of noble estates or the incomes from them) were in frequent and direct contact with noble estate owners, and in some cases would even manage their estates for them and so knew the problems it entailed at firsthand. See Moshe Rosman, The Lords 'Jews. Magnate-Jewish Relations in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth during the 18th Century (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1990), 106-42; Adam Teller, "Hakhira klalit vehokher klali be'ahuzot beit radzhivil bame'ah hashmoneh-'esreh," in Yazamut yehudit ba'et hahadashah: Polin ve'erez yisra'el, ed.

Lesser noblemen lived in smaller manor houses, also called dwory.77 The Jews, of course, did not have the same economic standing as the magnates, which meant that they generally lived in smaller buildings. It seems to have been only with the appearance of the so- called regal zaddikim, such as Israel of Ruzhin, that their centers became like magnate palaces.78 However, a commonality of the noble court and the hasidic center (of whatever size) was the fact that both formed chancelleries that handled the administration of affairs in the geographic peripheries they controlled.79 The magnate regularly received in his chancellery noblemen, wealthy Jews, and burghers, all of whom served their patron in different ways and wanted his help and support in return. Jews (and not only Jews) very often had to bribe offi- cials in the magnate court, especially the burgrave, who ran the chancellery, to ensure that they would be able to present their case. In the hasidic court, many Jews came to meet the zaddik (though not always individually), and here, too, the gaba'im, who managed the zaddik's affairs, took money from visitors who wanted to approach him. The Maggid of Mezhirech seems to have been the first to move in this direc- tion, as may be seen from Solomon Maimon's description of his time at his court. He described his experience there as follows: At last I arrived at M[ezhirech], and ... went to the house of the zaddik ... [to] be introduced to him at once. I was told, however, that he could not speak to me at the time, but that I was invited to his table on Sabbath along with the other strangers who had come to visit him; that I should then have the happiness of seeing the saintly man face to face and of hearing the sublimest teachings out of his own mouth ... Accordingly on the Sabbath I went to this solemn meal and found there a large number of respectable men from ... various places. At length the great man appeared in his awe-inspiring form, clothed in white satin ... this being among the Kabbalists the color of grace ... We sat down to table and during the meal a solemn silence reigned. [Then] the zaddik struck up a solemn inspiring melody, held his hand for some time upon his brow and ... began to deliver a sermon ... It was extraordinary [that] every 77.

At this stage, the Maggid had succeeded in attracting many followers to his house-too many to be able to give each one a personal audience. He already had officials to instruct the visitors of the new customs of the place and had devel- oped a special means-the Sabbath afternoon meal and the sermon delivered thereat-to bring them into the fold.80 This form of organization seems to have served as the basis for later hasidic courts.81 Writing about 1815, more than 40 years after the Maggid's death, Joseph Perl gave his own, somewhat jaundiced description of the way the working of such a hasidic chancellery had developed: The zaddik's people keep guard on the door of the house ... All those who bring no gold to the zaddik or whose faces are unknown, are not allowed in. Such a one has to do something before he can come into the zaddik's room and see his holy countenance ... Bringing him money, status, a skill, or people [i.e. followers] as well as collecting presents for him are the only ways to secure a meeting with the zaddik. Many a zaddik's doorkeeper under- stands his post as managing the zaddik by himself and collecting nice sums of money to let people into the zaddik's room and see him, either in order to be able to bring him their petition and ask his advice or just to approach the Rebbe. It makes a beautiful sight to see the crowds in the zaddik's room. More than one of those thronging the entrance has to be soundly beaten by the zaddik's men for trying to force his way in. Some poor wretches, who have no money or standing, and are not brave enough to force their way in, have to make do with talking to the zaddik's coachman and looking upon his carriage and horses.82 80. The conspicuous consumption of great quantities of good food at meals and banquets was also a significant aspect of the noble lifestyle in this period. See Czapliniski and Dlugosz, Zycie codzienne magnaterii polskiej, 113-28; and Kuchowicz, Czlowiek polskiego baroku, 22-38. 81. In his autobiography, Maimon assumes that the Maggid of Mezhirech already had an elaborate system of gaba'im acting on his behalf as spies in the various communities of Poland and Lithuania and supplying him information about those traveling to his court, which would help him make an impression on them when they arrived. See Solomon Maimon: An Autobiography, 169. It does not seem likely that the Maggid had such a highly developed system as early as the 1760s. 82. "Zu Hause... halten des Zadiks Leute Wache an der Thuere.

By the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the custom had taken on the symbolic meaning of creating a mystical link between the individual hasid and the zaddik.84 In daily practice, however, it had largely become a routine payment made by a hasid who needed to gain the zaddik's atten- tion to help him in a time of need. Critics of Hasidism saw it as nothing more than a bribe-just like those that had to be made to the magnate to gain audience with him.85 Those who visited these courts had various motivations. The regulations concerning access to Shneur Zalman, zaddik of the Chabad sect, stated openly that many Jews wanted to visit him, not with personal petitions but to study with him or to hear his teachings. The magnate courts also served as centers of cultural or intellectual activity.86 On the other hand, while the so-called Liozna regulations devoted much space to regulations limiting the visits of hasidim to the court and establishing arrangements for putting them up in the local town, regulating the flow of visitors would not have concerned the magnate to such an extent.87 In addition to receiving petitioners at their courts, both the magnate and the zaddik would tour the regions under their control to see local conditions for them- selves (and in the case of the zaddik, to attract new followers).

Accusations of corruption in connection with the custom of giving pidyonot were common to both the mitnagdim and the maskilim. See Wodzil'ski, Oswiecenie iydowskie, 22, 98. In Keter Kehuna, 77-78, Zederbaum suggests that the use of the word pidyon was predicated on its vocal simi- larity to the Slavic words for religious gifts or tributes, hinting at a non-Jewish source for the custom: The claim that hasidic practices were based on non-Jewish customs was used quite systematically by maskilim during the nineteenth century as a means of discrediting the new movement. In light of the discussion here, it might be worthwhile to assess whether there was, in fact, any factual basis to these claims rather than simply to dismiss them out of hand as tendentious. See Etkes, "Magic and Miracle Workers," 113-27. 86.

There was perhaps a more direct similarity of motivation between Jews visiting a hasidic court and Catholics visiting a monastery. 87. See note 22. 21</page><page sequence="22">Adam Teller of these tours have survived. The following is a description of Prince Radziwill's entourage, made by a Lithuanian Jew who witnessed it during the late 1760s: On the morning of the appointed day, the train went forth. This had to be done with his usual suite and all the pomp of his court. First, marched his [private] army ... Then followed his bodyguard, strzelicy, consisting of volunteers from the poor nobility. After them came the kitchen wagons in which the Hungarian wine had not been forgotten. These were followed by the music of his janis- saries and other bands. Then came his coach, and last of all his satraps.88 This may be compared with a description of a tour made by the zaddik Israel of Ruzhin during the 1830s: He traveled with three carriages of his own, and the Jews flocked to see him in such crowds that more than 700 vehicles were upon the road, either accompa- nying or going to meet him. He slept at this inn on his way from Brody to Lemberg. The crowd of Jews that visited him was such that he could hardly get rest, and many came to look upon his face while he was sleeping. So great was the excitement, that the Austrian Government became alarmed and ordered him to leave the country in three days.89 The zaddik's visit roused the locals to such a height of hasidic fervor "that no Jew dare appear on the streets unless dressed entirely in the Jewish manner, for fear the hasidim should tear him to pieces."90 The zaddik's train included beadles, cantors, cooks, slaughterers, and servants carrying the zaddik's personal effects. There could even be a full band playing music the whole time.91 This clearly parallels the huge entourage that the Polish magnate took with him when he traveled. Of course, it was impossible for either magnate or zaddik to be on the road the whole time, so both needed a local administration to work on their behalf in the different localities under their control. As we have seen, both used the community structures to control Jewish life. But both also made use of a network of local offi- cials as an efficient means of dealing with day-to-day problems. The magnate lati- fundia, which could cover entire regions and contain tens of cities and hundreds of villages, demanded a highly complex administrative organization with governors, town administrators, farm managers, and local officials. It was their job to admini- ster the daily life and, most importantly, the economic activity of the estate to ensure that the magnate's income always remained at a satisfactory level.92 During its early years at least, the hasidic administration required much less sophistication.

In addition, the local treasurers of the Land of Israel fund were responsible for organizing visits by local hasidim to the central court. Finally, the zaddik would make use of special emissaries, whom he would send to individual communities or regions with instructions on how to deal with local issues.93 As the hasidic movement continued to grow and spread over time, however, the administrative apparatus became more sophisticated: Local gaba'im, commis- sioners, and other officials would administer hasidic affairs in the individual com- munities, sometimes even keeping censuses of the local hasidic population. In addition, there were centrally appointed tax collectors whose job it was to visit the different regions and collect taxes for the zaddik in his court.94 The flow of cash from periphery to center was clearly of great importance for both magnate and zaddik. Direct meetings were not the only means of bridging the huge geographic gap between the peripheral populations and the central figure of the magnate or zaddik. An equally important connection between the central court and the out- lying areas was written correspondence sent to the court by subjects or hasidim. Writing such letters allowed the individual to take the initiative into his own hands when he wanted to make a personal request of his master. They were often penned at times of great personal trouble and requested the magnate's or the zaddik's intervention to alleviate the distress, which was very often of a per- sonal or economic nature. In Polish, these requests were called supliki, and in the Yiddish of the hasidim, kvitlekh.95 However, on occasion, they were also called in Yiddish suplikes-a linguistic borrowing that clearly demonstrates the parallels between the two phenomena.96 It would seem, then, that the zaddik formed, like the magnate, a central figure of authority whose word was law for those under his authority. To administer his widespread population of followers, the zaddik used many of the magnate's methods: He ran a central chancellery, toured the various districts he ruled, 93. Etkes, "Darko shel R. Shne'ur Zalman," 347-53. 94. Ibid., 351. Assaf, "Money for Household Expenses," 37-44. 95. For a collection of supliki from peasants to their feudal lord, see Janina Leskiewicz and Jerzy Michalski, eds., Supliki chlopskie XVIII wieku (Warsaw: Ksiqzka i Wiedza, 1954). See particu- larly the introduction to the volume by Stanislaw Arnold. Just like other subjects, Jews, too, wrote supliki (in Polish) to the lords of their estates with various requests and petitions. There is a large collec- tion of such documents in Archiwum Gl6wne Akt Dawnych we Warszawie, Archiwum Radziwillows- kie, XXIII, 33. On the kvitlekh, see Aaron Wertheim, Law and Custom in Hasidism (Hoboken, NJ: Ktav, 1992), 233-36, 241-48. It should be noted that the spiritual connection between the hasidim and their zaddik meant that the kvitlekh might contain requests of a much more intimate nature than those included in the supliki to the magnate. 96. Cf. Joseph Perl's description in Megaleh Temirin, chap. 13, p. llb: 23</page><page sequence="24">Adam Teller maintained his own administrative apparatus, and especially exploited the Jewish communities to strengthen his rule over the large geographic regions that he con- trolled. This is not to say, of course, that the two administrative systems were iden- tical. Because the magnate was a feudal lord who ruled over the entire population of his estate, which he legally owned, whereas the zaddik was a spiritual leader whose influence covered only a part of the Jewish population in the various towns where he held sway (and in legal terms, his rule was entirely informal), the magnate's administrative system was generally more highly developed and sophisticated. The zaddik's administrative apparatus seems fragmentary in com- parison. In addition, the motivations of those approaching both courts were quite different and so could influence both the form and content of these contacts. None- theless, the similarities in the geographic problems faced by magnate and zaddik in dealing with the populations under their control, together with the very high pres- tige enjoyed by the magnate in Polish society, seem to have led the leaders of the developing hasidic movement to structure their administrative system very much along the lines of that used by the noble owners of the great latifundia. The Monastic Orders and the Hasidic Sects On the whole, the church administration does not seem to have presented Hasidism with a helpful model for its activities. There were apparent similarities between the figure of the bishop, a man of central religious authority who was responsible for the spiritual welfare of the population in his diocese, and that of the zaddik, who filled many of the same roles. The bishop, however, was only part of a larger church hierarchy and owed obedience to his superiors (most notably, the archbishop, the cardinals, and the pope), whereas the zaddik stood at the pinnacle of his own religious group and was supposed to be in direct contact with God. Moreover, though both the church and the hasidic court col- lected their own special taxes (the tithe for the church and ma 'amadot for the court), it is hard to find any formal similarity between the geographic and admini- strative structures of the church and those of the hasidic movement. The church divided the whole country into dioceses and parishes and appointed a hierarchy of clerics to be responsible for each locality and region, whereas the hasidic leaders made no formal division of the whole country, each having influence only where some of his followers were to be found. This sometimes led to over- lapping spheres of influence and even territorial disputes between hasidic leaders, but never to an attempt to divide up the whole country systematically.97 97. Maskilim, however, liked to portray the hasidic movement in dramatic terms, as if the leaders were indeed carving up the country between them. Cf. Perl, Uiber das Wesen, 90: "Das ganze Land wird unter die Rebis vertheilt, und sehr oft enstehet unter ihnen Zank und Streit, wenn es einem einfaellt, in das Gebieth eines andern zu kommen."

The parallel here is with the activities of the monastic orders, which laid great emphasis on founding monasteries throughout the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Members of the mendicant orders, of course, covered the country by foot, wandering from place to place, drumming up support and donations where they could, whereas other orders awaited an invitation to settle in a certain locality. By 1700, by a con- servative estimate, there were a total of 674 monasteries (not counting convents) in Crown Poland, Ruthenia, and Lithuania, and the number had reached 884 by 1773, a growth of more than 15% in less than a century.98 The institutions that the different orders established were supported by the donations they received from various local dignitaries (particularly nobles but also wealthy burghers).99 Each order had its own rule and way of life, and each practicing Catholic was free to choose the orientation that suited him or her (if, that is, he or she decided to join an order in the first place). In his description of Polish life during the eighteenth century, Jedrzej Kitowicz devoted a long discussion to the different types of monastic orders and their particular ways of life. He described, among others, the clean-shaven Franciscans in their black habits who would officiate in the magnates' private chapels, the German-speaking Capu- chins, who were often called on to pray for sick children, and the Trinitarians, who were renowned for their great efforts in redeeming Polish captive prisoners of war.100 The weakness of Poland's central authority meant that these orders enjoyed a relatively long period of unhindered prosperity for much of the eighteenth century and attracted many followers and adherents, proving a highly efficient means of spreading the monastic message across Poland- Lithuania's vast expanses.101 The Maggid of Mezhirech's pupils adopted precisely this means of spread- ing the hasidic message across Poland and Lithuania: Some wandered from place to place and settled wherever they found a body of followers, whereas others were invited to settle in localities where a number of hasidim already resided. In either case, once settled, the zaddikim supported themselves and their newly established centers with the donations they received, either directly or in the form of pidyonot 98.

This must have been a major factor in Hasidism's ability to attract such a wide audience for its message.'08 It should come as no surprise that the hasidic leadership was aware of the monasteries and the way they worked. Many of these institutions had invested financial assets in the Jewish communities for more than a century, so that there had been continuous contact between them and Jewish society for many years.109 In addition, as part of their activities in the realm of redeeming captives (i.e., Jews imprisoned for debts or other reasons), hasidic leaders may have come into contact with church leaders trying to convert Jews.110 Jewish society in general was not unaware of the tenets of the various Christian sects: The author of the mitnagdic tract Shever Posh'im, for example, compares the hasidim with Mennonite Christians."' Because the Mennonites made up only a very small group in Poland, it seems clear that there would have been enough contact between the Jews and the majority Polish Catholic world for the hasidic leadership to be able to adopt (consciously or unconsciously) aspects of the way the monas- teries worked and adapt them to their own needs. There were also a number of parallels between the functions fulfilled by the monasteries and those filled by the hasidic courts. The monasteries formed the base for a large number of social and cultural activities, including holding prayer services and giving sermons, visiting outlying areas, conducting edu- cational activities (including founding schools), and in times of war, even organiz- ing the redemption of captives (as mentioned previously, the Trinitarians were particularly active in this field). The typical monastery-in Polish, called a klasz- tor, which was paralleled by the Yiddish term for a hasidic study house, kloiz- was a busy place, full of guests and travelers breaking their journey.

Nonetheless, though weakened, the orders did not vanish, and the hasidic leaders who had witnessed their full range of activities in earlier years were still able to see a large number of highly active monasteries and other institutions throughout the country."14 After the third partition and Poland's full loss of independence, some of these monasteries even became centers of Polish underground activities."5 CONCLUSION It seems that the hasidic movement's need to come to terms with the chal- lenge posed by the geographic conditions of Poland-Lithuania arose when the Maggid of Mezhirech changed the elitist structure of the group that had formed around the Besht, opening the ranks of the movement to anyone who wanted to join. In the early stages of Hasidism's development as a social movement, particu- larly when the Maggid's students began to leave his circle to found their own centers, the leaders seem to have used strategies employed by the various monas- teries to disseminate their ideas over whole districts or regions. In the next stage of the movement's development-the institutionalization of the links between the zaddik in his central court and the outlying population of his adherents-the hasidic leaders made use of various administrative structures commonly found in the magnate estates, which had to deal with similar geographic problems. Finally, once the initial "conquest of space" was complete and the leadership needed to create a stable framework for their followers in their places of residence, they exploited the institutions of the existing Jewish communities while ensuring as far as possible that the ultimate source of authority in Jewish society was trans- ferred from the communal bodies to themselves. This, too, was a strategy employed by the magnates toward the Jewish communities on their estates. It is worth stating here that geography was not the only factor to influence the ways in which the hasidic movement developed. The movement's new reli- gious message and its leadership's ability to forge individual links with each hasid were just as crucial. Changes in the patterns of communal and rabbinic autho- rity in Jewish society, not to mention changes in forms of communal solidarity, were also of great importance, as was the development of print culture among eastern European Jews. In addition to this, the social policies of the state autho- rities on the Jewish question during the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries 113.

Kloczowski, Zarys dziejow Kosciola, 204. 28</page><page sequence="29">Hasidism and the Challenge of Geography were also highly influential.116 Nonetheless, finding solutions to the problems posed by the geography of the region was vital for the hasidic movement to be able to grow and develop as it did, for had it not done so, it would have remained a local phenomenon of only limited appeal. It is interesting that although the hasidic movement succeeded in developing a sophisticated and flexible system for controlling large populations spread out over wide areas, the mitnagdim did not develop a special system for dealing with the geographic challenge of opposing Hasidism. Instead, they preferred to make use solely of already existing communal institutions-though these were, as we have seen, without much authority in this period. This may well have played a part in their failure to halt the spread of the new movement. The maski- lim, too, failed to organize themselves into any coherent form of social move- ment.1.7 In addition, it is possible that part of the hasidic movement's success in winning so many adherents may be attributed to the fact that at the turn of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries-a time when the partitioning powers were putting a great deal of pressure on the Jewish communities as part of their policy of centralization-Hasidism offered a flexible system for self-government outside the communities that enabled Jewish society to preserve its internal integrity.118 Thus, it seems that M4czak's argument that the geography of the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth played an important role in determining the historical development of Polish-Lithuanian society holds true, too, for the development of the hasidic movement. In consequence, the hasidic movement as a whole-even during the postpartition period and when some hasidic leaders had settled in other geographical regions-should be viewed as a social movement whose struc- ture and functioning were deeply influenced by the Polish-Lithuanian environ- ment in which it developed. Beyond that, in dealing with the geographic conditions of the region, Hasidism adopted organizational and administrative patterns from the surrounding society, and so was also, despite its isolationist self-image, a movement that led to the development of a series of social and cultural phenomena that were common to both Jewish and non-Jewish society in eastern Europe.

This hypothesis is reminiscent of Raphael Mahler's argument that Hasidism played an important role as a focus for Jewish national sentiment during the first half of the nineteenth century. Mahler, Hahasidut vehahaskalah, 13-46. Though the use of the term national is probably anachronistic here, the idea that the hasidic court became a focus for Jewish resistance to the changes that the non-Jewish authorities were increasingly forcing on the communities should perhaps be given serious consideration, particularly in light of the fact that, as mentioned previously, some of the monastic institutions seem to have been involved in Polish nationalist activities at this time. 29</page></plain_text>
