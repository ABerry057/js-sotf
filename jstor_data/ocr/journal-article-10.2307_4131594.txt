Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 2000. xxvi, 203 pp. While each of these three books is about Jewish ethics, they take very dif- ferent approaches to the topic, serve different purposes, and speak to different au- diences. If nothing else, they-and a number of other books about Jewish ethics published in recent years-collectively demonstrate that Jews are paying serious attention not only to the theological, legal, historical, social, and cultural aspects of Jewish identity, but also to the Jewish tradition's moral import. In doing so, methodology has become a key underlying issue: How should we access the Jewish tradition for its moral application to our times? Answering that critically depends, in turn, on how one understands such subjects as revelation and the authority of Jewish law. Clearly, if one takes a Reform approach, for ex- ample, individual conscience and autonomy will play a much larger role than they will if one takes a Conservative or Orthodox approach, where Jewish law is con- sidered binding. Similarly, if one sees Jewish law as developing over time, as the Conservative Movement does, the substance of the law to which we are bound may well be different from what is construed to be the law in Orthodoxy. But the methodological problem goes beyond these familiar denominational differences, for even if you assume that we should follow God's will exactly as it has come down to us in the various codes and responsa-the Orthodox position- on many issues you will have a hard time discerning what God wants of us in our time because technological, social, and political changes have significantly changed our reality from that of our ancestors. Indeed, ancient and medieval sources did not even contemplate current realities, let alone deal with them. One must therefore be open to the possibility that the Jewish tradition may have nothing on point to say about a contemporary problem, although, with proper attention to methodology, sit- uations like that, I think, are rare. (For ten approaches to this methodological issue, see Contemporary Jewish Ethics and Morality: A Reader, Elliot N. Dorff and Louis E. Newman, eds., New York: Oxford, 1995, chpts. 6-15.) It is precisely the lack of attention to methodology that bothers me most about Aaron Levine's book, Case Studies in Jewish Business Ethics. Typical of Or- thodox writers, Levine pays no attention at all to the writings of people who come from the other movements in Judaism. At some point, I would hope, it may dawn on the Orthodox that they constitute less than ten percent of North American Jew- ry and that they at least need to consider the approaches of the other denomina- tions, even if only to disagree with them. One can even demand that their dis- agreements take the form of reasoned arguments. Who knows? Maybe Orthodox 198</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews writers who bother to read the other movements' materials may even learn from them! Moreover, Levine's methodology prevents him from considering whether Jewish law ought to be changed to meet the business conditions of our times. That is, he reports and applies Jewish law to specific cases-often deftly-but he nev- er asks whether modern conditions would suggest that Jewish law be changed al- together. So, for example, Levine describes how Jewish law forbidding Jews to charge other Jews interest can accommodate modern commercial conditions through adaptations of the sixteenth-century document that gives "permission to do busi- ness" (heter iska). But the prohibition applies only to Jews doing business with other Jews, which is now a rarity. The very case that Levine uses to illustrate this law involves an encyclopedia salesman by the name of Henry Blackwell and his potential clients, the Fishers. Is Blackwell Jewish? Is the company for which he works Jewish? Levine never deals with the fact that the vast majority of compa- nies these days are conglomerates, and even companies that used to be family- owned businesses have now generally "gone public," so that they are owned by members of the family and other stock holders. Minimally, I would have expected Levine to mention whether these laws apply at all to observant Jews engaging in business with such companies (including banks and stock brokerages). But even in the minority of cases in which Jews are dealing directly and solely with other Jews, can such business be conducted ignoring contemporary market assumptions and conditions? The very institution of the heter iska was intended to take into ac- count the new market conditions of its time, in which interest was just assumed, so that Jews would have permission to do business (the literal meaning of heter iska) in those times; now, when Jews are much more involved in the general market- place, and when that marketplace is truly global, one would expect that Jewish law might have to change yet again to accommodate the Torah's laws against charging interest. So, for example, perhaps the scope of those laws needs to be narrowed to apply only to transactions of very specific types so that observant Jews can indeed do business in our time. Such a possibility, and even the underlying problem, are not even mentioned. The first chapter, on moral education, is by far the least satisfying; Levine does much better when he gets to the area he really knows-namely, business. He describes a number of traits that it would be desirable to inculcate in our children and ourselves, but only once does he talk about how-specifically, that parents should not lie to children. A chapter entitled "Moral Education" demands a much more sophisticated understanding of the nature and methods of education general- ly and of moral education in particular. Carol Ingall's award-winning book on the subject, Transmission and Transformation: A Jewish Perspective on Moral Educa- tion (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1999) is a much better resource for a Jewish theory of, and practical guide for, moral education. Still, Levine's book has much to recommend it. Beginning each chapter with a specific case, like secular textbooks in business ethics, helps to focus and clari- fy the discussion even for those not accustomed to business terms and modes of 199</page><page sequence="3">AJS Review transaction. It would have been better, though, to list the issues of each chapter in the Table of Contents rather than the name of the case. Levine includes helpful glossaries of terms in American and Jewish law, and his summaries of, and com- parisons to, American law clarify where Judaism differs from contemporary as- sumptions and where it is similar. These comparisons also give the discussion a distinctly contemporary ring. Moreover, Levine clearly summarizes the relevant concepts and precedents of Jewish law-of which he clearly has encyclopedic knowledge-before applying them to the modem case. For all these reasons, this is a book worth reading. It is also a book worth using in classes on Jewish busi- ness ethics, provided that students are repeatedly warned about the Orthodox lim- itations of this book and exposed to other Jewish approaches to the same issues. The Jewish Moral Virtues, by Eugene Borowitz and Frances Schwartz, is, in contrast, quite clear about its methodological assumptions, describing them in the very first chapter. The authors tell us that they will call upon a plethora of Jewish sources, including not only Bible, Talmud, and Midrash, but medieval and modern writers, and even Yiddish, Ladino, and Iraqi Jewish epigrams spoken by ordinary people. They note the problem of selecting some virtues and not others, correctly saying that in a finite book "There is never a fully satisfactory response to that charge" (p. 7), and then explain that their selections are based on the twenty-four virtues discussed by the first author of a well-received book on Jewish virtues, the late-thirteenth-century Roman Jewish scribe, Yehiel b. Yekutiel b. Binyamin Harofe. One can surely argue whether that is a good basis for deciding which virtues to include or exclude, but at least the authors have revealed their method of selection and the grounds for it. They also note that while Yehiel could simply cite biblical verses for each virtue and presume that his audience would immedi- ately see the compelling nature of that virtue, biblical verses do not have that pow- er in our time, and so the authors have expanded on each virtue with more con- temporary arguments and applications. They are also clear about their organizational pattern. They note that through Chapter 19 they have grouped the virtues loosely into five sections and then "tack- le the difficult process of converting learning to doing" (p. 8) in chapters on Torah and observing the commandments, repentance, and prayer (chpts. 20-22). Final- ly, at the end of the book, they discuss God, "Our Ground, Our Guide, Our Goal." Thus they have gone from the concrete to the abstract in the way that people are likely to experience these virtues. The chapters on each virtue are written in a light, contemporary tone that be- lies the considerable research that went into writing this volume. It includes a de- lightful mix of ancient, medieval, and modern wisdom, including, in some cases, stories that come from the authors' own lives. Moreover, their suggestions for how we should live by these virtues are often poignant and even funny, especially in the chapter on common decency. They also balance the virtues against each other. So, for example, they argue for compassion withjustice, religious zeal but not zealotry. I have some quibbles about specific issues in the book, together with one dis- appointment. In their chapter on trustworthiness, I wish that Borowitz and Schwartz had spoken about its role in business, where it is absolutely critical. As a college student, I once accompanied my father, a civil engineer, to the lumberyard, where 200</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews he ordered lumber for a building he was constructing with just an oral agreement and a handshake. Given that both he and the salesman could lose a lot of money if either one of them reneged on the deal, I asked my father how they could do that. He shrugged his shoulders and then told me that even a detailed contract with a per- son you do not trust is not worth the paper it is written on, but people regularly do business with those they trust on the basis of oral agreements alone. Similarly, the chapter on embarrassment (boshet) has no reference to the important discussion in Bava Kamma 86b on the elements of embarrassment-a personal sense of shame, degradation in the eyes of others, and dishonor of one's family. On page 36, I have problems with two decisions that the authors claim demonstrate trustworthiness. In one, they endorse lying to a patient rather than scaring him or her with the doctor's grim diagnosis. There is some support for that approach within the Jewish tradition, but I frankly find it highly problematic. The family and patient dance around each other as they pretend that they do not both know that the prospects are bad. Under those circumstances, the patient cannot openly cry with those near and dear, express worry about what is to come, or gain comfort from them. Moreover, lying infantilizes the patient. Tact is obviously in order, and visitors should focus on what the patient can still hope to do in his or her life, but ultimately honesty enables far more effective caring. On that same page, the authors recommend keeping a promise to cremate a parent. Here the Jewish tradition actually gives the opposite instruction, maintain- ing that both parents and children have the duty to obey God and so Jewish law su- persedes what our parents may want (Sifra on Lev. 19:3; B. Yevamot 5b). At the least, I wish that the authors had explained their arguments against that logic. The least satisfying chapters in the book are the most theological ones at its end. The light style that works throughout the book does not work well when it comes to God, law, and prayer. Moreover, the topics require a much more thorough analysis than the one provided; I honestly felt cheated. I also wish that the authors had made the point that living by the virtues they describe is one of the Jewish tra- dition's paths to knowing God. Still, on balance, this book includes a wonderful discussion of a number of Jewish virtues and is well worth the read. It may even change some behavior! Byron Sherwin's Jewish Ethicsfor the Twenty-First Century consists of eight chapters unified by the theme of creation in the image of God, which Sherwin dis- cusses in the first chapter. The topics include health and healing, euthanasia, ge- netic engineering, parent-child relations, reproductive technologies and cloning, zedakah, and repentance. The truly special thing about Sherwin's treatment of sev- eral of these topics-especially genetic engineering and reproductive technolo- gies-is his use of the Golem legends in addition to other Jewish sources. Through- out his book Sherwin evidences not only mastery of the wealth of Jewish materials and ideas that can reasonably apply to modem issues, but also the analytic skills to identify important comparisons to American and Christian approaches and the cre- ativity to suggest new resolutions. So, for example, he makes a sharp distinction between Calvin's understanding of poverty as punishment and Judaism's view of poverty as tragedy. In what is bound to be a controversial chapter, he argues on the basis of Jewish sources for the permissibility of active euthanasia, thus challeng- 201</page><page sequence="5">AJS Review ing the mainstream position of the past and present. He also is scrupulously hon- est about the variety of approaches within Judaism to a number of topics-e.g., the moral status of the body and the identity of the image of God within us. In the end, the moral lesson of this book is that in an age of increasing technology, we must strive ever harder to become intensely human (e.g., p. 87). Sherwin finds genetic engineering for purposes of creating more fruitful plants and animals as well as life-saving pharmaceuticals unequivocally good, in- deed "both obligatory and desirable" (p. 122). I am currently serving on a federal commission to review and revise the government's guidelines on research on hu- man subjects, and much of our work is to insure that people do not suffer serious harm through such research. Some healthy volunteers have even died. And genet- ic engineering of plants and animals carries the risks of leaving only one species of tomato, for example. What happens when that species is decimated by some or- ganism? Biodiversity, in other words, is critical for human existence. In humans, animals, and plants, in other words, our enthusiasm for new genetic breakthroughs must be tempered with great caution. Still, Sherwin's judgments and arguments are, in general, sound, with clear attention to the methodological issues I raised at the outset, and his book, although not easy reading, is well worth the effort.
