A Cri- tical Edition from Original Manuscript Sources. Edited by Timothy Oelman. Rutherford, N.J.: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1986. 211 pp. Antonio Enriquez G6mez is one of the most arresting figures in the pan- theon of seventeenth-century Marrano writers that includes Joao (Mosseh) Pinto Delgado and Miguel de Barrios (Daniel Levi). Although Enriquez G6mez never attained the poetic laurel that graced contemporaneous talents-Lope de Vega, G6ngora, and Quevedo-his literary production is of adequate quality and his biography of sufficient interest to invite our con- sideration. Peripatetic both by circumstances and choice, Enriquez G6mez was born in Cuenca, Spain, in 1600, and departed for France in late 1635 or early 1636, where he resided first in Peyrehorade and then in Bordeaux. Some eight years later, he moved to Rouen, and finally returned to Spain in 1649, where he published copiously under the pseudonym Fernando de Zirate. In 1660, Enriquez G6mez was burned in effigy by the Seville Inquisi- tion, and he was subsequently arrested by the same institution. After his trial, at which he repented, he fell ill and, while awaiting sentence, died on 19 March 1663. Enriquez G6mez has been well-served by Oelman in this handsomely produced book. Indeed, much more than the critical edition mentioned in the subtitle awaits the reader. Part I contains wide-ranging studies on En- riquez G6mez's biography and religious attitudes, as well as particularly informative analyses of the Romance al div'n mdrtir. Oelman is at his best in discussing the historical-literary backdrop of the Romance, especially Enriquez G6mez's assiduous criticism of the Inquisition's policy toward conversos, or New Christians. The issue of Portuguese independence is woven together with Enriquez G6mez's overtly religious preoccupations to create a literary tapestry depicting the obligations of a just government.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 291 The focus of Oelman's edition and commentary is the Romance al divin mdrtir, Judd Creyente, which he considers "the cardinal work among Antonio Enriquez G6mez's writings, his Jewish testament, an outspoken expression of faith" (p. 98). The protagonist of the Romance is Don Lope de Vera y Alarc6n, an old Christian who was attracted to Judaism while study- ing Semitic languages at the University of Salamanca. He was first arrested by the Inquisition in 1639 on charges of proselytizing and, two years later, expressed his desire to convert to Judaism. He circumcised himself ("cual otro Abraham")-reputedly with a bone-and adopted the name "Judi Creyente." Although he ultimately abandoned all efforts to convert his interrogators, Enriquez G6mez sets forth his religious beliefs in some detail. In 1644 he was burned in Valladolid. In 550-line Romance, divided into two parts, incorporates the above his- torical details, but also introduces an abundance of purely literary and religious elements. The poem, for instance, contains a highly charged haran- gue directed at Lope de Vera y Alarbon's captors; a messianic prophecy, replete with apocalyptic references to the Book of Daniel; and even a mysti- cal interlude where the poet refers to hIis soul, soon to depart the body, as the bride of God ("Como 6sta es de Dios esposa" [line 369]). The predecessor of Oelman's book was his 1976 King's College disserta- tion. Unlike many such academic exercises that have metamorphosed into commercial life, Oelman's work has, for the most part, made that transition gracefully. Oelman has rendered a great service not only by providing a sub- stantial commentary on the Romance, but also by including paleographic and critical editions of the pertinent manuscripts, complete with exception- ally well produced facsimiles. The editions are preceded by competent lin- guistic and codicological studies. Unfortunately, a number of blemishes mar this otherwise exemplary piece of work. In the first instance, there is the annoying presence of ortho- graphic errors in English and Spanish (e.g., filologia [read filologia; Politica angblica and Etz Haim [both should be italicized] [p. 13]; auto def'fd vs. auto da f6 [p. 26]; Carro(!) Baroja [read Caro Baroja] [p. 28]). Of greater concern are the errors appearing in both the paleographic and critical editions, although they do not usually affect our understanding of the text (e.g., Title: "p[or]" [p. 142] vs. "p[o]r" [p. 155]--in fact, the word is simply abbreviated as "por" in the manuscript; line 21 of the paleographic edition has "Alma" [p. 142], while the critical edition reads "alms" [p. 156]; line 254 of the paleographic edition fails to indicate two manuscript corrections).
