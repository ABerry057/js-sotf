<plain_text><page sequence="1">Seth Schwartz. Josephus and Judaean Politics. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1990. xii, 257 pp. This revised Columbia University dissertation (1985) is very much in the tradition of R. Laqueur, who earlier in the century proposed that Josephus' development as a historian can be best appreciated once the differences be- tween War and his later works have been ascertained. Schwartz devotes whole chapters to Josephus' intellectual development, his treatment of the priesthood and of the Herodians after 70, and finally, the relationship of An- tiquities to the Pharisees and early rabbinic Judaism. Each of these chapters can stand as a distinct investigation of Josephus' historiographic approach; all are well argued, with many intriguing observations proffered along the way.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 113 These include: (1) Josephus was either ignorant of or unconcerned with biblical traditions when he wrote War. Those he alludes to often deviate considerably from the received biblical tradition. In contrast, Antiquities is more directly dependent upon the Tanakh. (2) Josephus was mostly un- acquainted with Greco-Jewish writings (exception: Aristeas) throughout his career. His knowledge of Greek literature, on the other hand, improved con- siderably by the time he wrote Antiquities. (3) The historian promotes the high priests in War, where they are truly peace-loving and secretly pro- Roman. In his later work he more faithfully recreates their factional involvements and thereby discredits the high priesthood. (4) Josephus is more consistent in his idealization of the "upper" priesthood, i.e., the wealthy and prominent priests who were not members of the high priestly families, in both War and Antiquities, both because he himself belonged to this class and because he believed that this group tended to be loyal and essential for good government. (5) War presents both Agrippa I and Agrip- pa II favorably and promotes the latter as a friend of the Romans and the Jews. Antiquities is not consistent in its approach to the Herodian rulers, but does include negative accounts and in general does not go out of its way to flatter them. (6) Whereas War does not propagandize "either for or against the Pharisees" (p. 172), their portrayal in Antiquities is inconsistent, with both anti-Pharisaic and laudatory accounts. (7) Antiquities advocates accur- ate adherence to the law, supporting leaders who furthered its observance and praising gentile rulers who allowed the Jews to keep it; after all, the Jews were known to have surrendered their lives for the law. Some of Schwartz's assertions warrant further substantiation. In partic- ular, his frequent claim that Josephus drew upon priestly traditions in form- ulating the biblical themes in War is not convincingly demonstrated.' More- over, Antiquities' greater knowledge and use of the Tanakh may, at least in part, be derived from its evident concern with Israel's past. Similarly, Jose- phus' "obsession" with the Temple and its cult in War may simply reflect the preoccupation of that work with the events leading to the destruction of Jer- usalem rather than an apologetic in favor of the high priesthood. On the other hand, Schwartz's determination to "mine" rabbinic litera- ture to confirm some of his impressions is productive. For example, once the 1. Cf. H. W.

Yohanan ben Zakkai and the surviving cultic leader- ship is considered (see M. Ketubot 13:1-2 and T. Parah 3:8), War's promo- tion of the high priests is more intelligible. The emergence of "priestly Rab- bis" after the rise of Rabban Gamaliel II in the 80s, the preservation of priestly material such as that found in M. Tamid, the reports of autonomous priestly courts (e.g., M. Rosh Ha-Shanah 1:7) and hints of priests "near the fringes" of rabbinism (cf. M. Sanhedrin 7:2) indeed point to the existence of an upper priesthood. Finally, the Agrippa traditions in talmudic literature tend to conflate the two kings by that name and are mostly positive, indicat- ing that the Herodian propaganda detected by Schwartz in War was effec- tive. Although it is difficult at times to discern where Schwartz's investiga- tions are leading, eventually his many insights are ingeniously brought together to revise the accepted view of post-70 Judea. Schwartz's recon- struction of the early Yavnean period serves as a corrective to the oft- repeated theory of his mentor, the late Morton Smith, that Antiquities pro- motes the Pharisees precisely because Josephus, supposedly a Pharisee him- self, wanted to convince the Romans of their worthiness. Indeed, Schwartz's appraisal of the Pharisees and the law in Antiquities is most provocative, as it leads to the assertion that Josephus "moved closer to Pharisaism without actually adhering to it" (p. 200). Accordingly, it is Josephus' constant emphasis on the necessity of "accurate observance" of the Law that makes it seem as though he is a supporter of the Pharisees. In reality, however, he was championing the cause of the rabbis "or some group much like the Rabbis" (p. 216). Schwartz finds support for his views in S. Cohen's important study, "The Significance of Yavneh: Pharisees, Rabbis, and the End of Jewish Sec- tarianism."2 Cohen postulated an ambiguous approach to the Pharisees on the part of the rabbis not unlike that which Schwartz believes Josephus and the leadership he promotes maintained. Moreover, Cohen's perception of Yavneh as a "grand coalition" of diverse groups allows for the inclusion of Schwartz's upper priests, some of whom were indeed rabbis. But Schwartz may be going too far. The fact of the matter is that all of the interpretations of Judaism represented at Yavneh were halakhah- centric, as was the case with the sectarian groups that are known from 2.

Glorification of the law may have taken different forms among these sects, but the emphasis was shared nonetheless. Indeed, S. Mason, in his Flavius Josephus on the Pharisees,3 similarly notes that Jose- phus harps on the fact that the Jews cherished their laws. Josephus regards the M6useos nomoi as the criterion of piety even if he sometimes departs from Mosaic law and includes later custom and convention in his under- standing of it. Mason concludes (pp. 330-331) that Josephus's use of nomoi in no way suggests that he was a Pharisee, something that Schwartz certainly would agree with. But it could be just as cogently argued that Josephus' per- ception of nomoi does not necessarily allow us to characterize the historian as a rabbinic sympathizer either. Schwartz's premise, that Josephus has in mind a particular group, could be incorrect; Antiquities, in encouraging "accurate observance" of Jewish law, may simply be advancing the cause of "Judaism." To prove Schwartz's assertion, the law in Antiquities must be compared to that of the rabbis, an approach Schwartz contends (pp. 170-171, n. 1) would yield little because of the limited amount of halakhah that can be defi- nitely assigned to Yavneh. Nevertheless, an inquiry into Josephan halakhah that considers the legislation of the rabbis and other known legal views and systems is likely to be beneficial. Similar studies of Qumran halakhah have been quite revealing inasmuch as they have aided our discussion of the iden- tity of the sect as well as our understanding of the development of particular rabbinic halakhot. Schwartz has certainly succeeded in shedding important light on Jose- phus' motivations and upon many aspects of politics and society in post-70 Judea. His bold historical reconstruction compels us not only to reconsider Yavneh, but also to appreciate how much Josephus really does reveal about a period that was not his ostensible concern. Stuart S.
