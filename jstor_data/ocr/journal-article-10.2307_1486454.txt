<plain_text><page sequence="1">A REEVALUATION OF A MEDIEVAL POLEMICAL MANUSCRIPT by JOEL E. REMBAUM University of Judaism In 1935 Ephraim E. Urbach, in his "Etudes sur la litterature polemique au moyen-age,"' provided the student of Jewish history with many valuable insights into the nature of medieval Jewish-Christian relations. The basis for Urbach's study, MS Or. 53 of the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale in Rome, is a collection of Jewish anti-Christian polemical material from thir- teenth century French and German sources. Urbach divides the manuscript into three main fragments, Al, A2 and B.2 Of the three, A2 is the smallest, consisting of five folios (21r-25v). In 1974 this text was published by the late Judah Rosenthal.3 Important conclusions have been drawn from these five pages, including the suggestion that they contain the record of a debate between a Jewish apostate, Paul Christian, and a French Jew, Menahem.4 There is reason to suggest that the material contained in this manuscript requires a reevaluation of certain of the conclusions heretofore presented. 1.

REMBAUM This study will offer a number of new textual comments demonstrating that the importance of A2 lies in factors different from those previously noted. The fragment begins with the following introduction: T'fl2 '12 IVI '1p 2fl~r '5K fl11 fVPu 121 3DI3lMZ5n5V Mltl1 5P .15l11 fl'lfln 'T flMZ 15'"I1? (Be diligent in studying Torah, and this is what you should respond to an 'epi- qoros. It is now 5029 (=-1269), and an apostate has come from Montpellier, revealing the secrets of the Torah and heretically interpreting the homilies of our Talmud. He has already held a disputation with Rabbi Moses ben Nahman before the king of Aragon in Barcelona.) This is a straightforward statement of a historical event: In 1269 the apos- tate who disputed with Nahmanides in Barcelona came from Montpellier to the writer's place of residence in France. The apostate was Paul Christian, an active missionizer among the Jews of Spain and France.6 The material that follows on fol. 21 of MS 53 is a series of arguments excerpted from Nahmanides' record of the 1263 Barcelona debate (the so-called Vikkuah ha-RaMbaN, the "Disputation of Nahmanides"), including additional points not found in the Nahmanides text.7 The first clause of this preface is adapted from Mishnah 'Avot 2:14. Its purpose here is to encourage the reader to prepare to respond to the chal- lenges of a Christian disputant. The arguments that follow are intended to provide the preparation for accomplishing this goal. This phrase is similarly employed by Joseph ben Nathan Official in his Sefer Yosef ha-meqanne (France, about 1250) and by the anonymous author of the Liber Nizzachon vetus (Germany, thirteenth century [?]).8 The additions found in the "Disputation" synopsis are of interest. They are clustered together on fol. 21 r of the manuscript9 and have these elements in common: 1) While they begin with questions raised by Paul, as noted in 5.

This didactic tenor is consistent with that of the preface and it is similar to the tone of a number of arguments noted on fols. 22r and 24r of fragment A2, in material from sources other than the "Disputation."' This usage differs from the past tense forms ('anah, heshiv, va-ya'an) generally used in the summaries of the Nahmanides material. Apparently, our compiler pre- ferred explanations of his own, or from other extant sources, to those of Nahmanides and did not hesitate to include them in his epitome. Certain of these editorial additions parallel traditions that can be traced to sources that antedate the 1260s. In the responses to the christological interpretation of Genesis 49:10 our writer argues that this verse does not predict Jesus' messiahship because the kingdom of Judah ended before Jesus' coming. While Nahmanides does make a similar point, it is not his primary argument." However, the argument that Jesus came many years after the end of the royal dynasty of Judah is a central issue for Joseph Kimhi in his Sefer ha-berit (Southern France, about 1170).12 Moreover, the author of A2 places Jesus' coming in the days of Queen Helena. This is a tradition extracted from the Toledot Yeshu sources. The spelling n,~,, found in our manuscript, appears in a number of Toledot Yeshu versions.' Rosenthal has noted the presence of a Toledot Yeshu notion in yet another of 10. R., pp. 65, 70. 11. Chavel, Kitvei, p. 304. 12.

Toledot yeshu elements are rarely incorporated into medieval Jewish anti-Christian polemics. The Jewish polemicists preferred to confront Christianity with arguments drawn from authentic Christian traditions. Some examples of this infrequent use of the Toledot yeshu in the polemics are: Vikkuab ha-RaDaQ, in S.H., p. 91; Nizzachon vetus, p. 239; Milbemet mievah of Meir ben Simeon of Narbonne, in MS 2749, Parma, Biblioteca Palatina, fols. 94r, 96v-97r, 139v.

REMBAUM our writer's interpolations.'4 Finally, in his criticism of the Christian claim that the "Suffering Servant" of Isaiah 53 is Jesus, the compiler argues: If Jesus were God, how could he be called a servant? This point was attributed to Joseph Bekhor Shor (twelfth century) in a comment on Isaiah 53 re- corded in the Sefer Yosefha-meqanne.'5 It appears that our writer was aware of extant polemical traditions which he used as the basis for his interpola- tions. The subject matter and style of the discussions on fols. 22r-25v of frag- ment A2'6 are considerably different from the content and format of the Nahmanides epitome. For example, in the second part there are no refer- ences to talmudic literature, the source for most of Paul's arguments and Rabbi Moses' responses. As opposed to the issue of Jesus' messiahship, the dominant theme of the "Disputation" summary, the notions of Jesus' divin- ity and saving powers come to the fore in the subsequent folios. In the course of these arguments an awareness of Christian theology and New Tes- tament traditions is in evidence. Moreover, the structure of the Paul- Nahmanides debate in the manuscript is consistently one of the min, the sectarian (Paul), asking and the Rabbi (Moses) answering. In the second part we find numerous passages in which a Jew initiates a discussion or raises a criticism. We have already seen that the usage of yesh le-hashiv is an anomaly in the first part of the manuscript and can be linked to the compiler's interpola- tions, whereas it fits better into the style of the second section. The same can be said for the term "pD. This root, which can be understood to mean "heretically interpret," is found in the preface to the manuscript'7 but does not appear in the selections from the "Disputation." It does occur in the second part of the manuscript, along with the term ino.'8 These words are found throughout the Sefer Yosefha-meqanne and the Nizzachon vetus, as is the phrase katuv lahem, which precedes the citations of New Testament traditions in our manuscript.'9 14.

This will become more clear in the analysis presented below. The only eclec- tic section in the epitome of the "Disputation" is the segment containing the compiler's additions. Rosenthal takes note of the fact that at the conclusion of the Nahman- ides material, on fol. 21v, there is a lacuna separating the body of the text from what follows on fol. 22r.20 Whether this represents an intentional demarcation by the scribe or an error on his part is not clear. Either way, it fortuitously creates an indication in the text that coincides with a conclusion that is tentatively suggested as a result of the analysis up to this point: Fragment A2 is a compilation of a number of literary sources, divided into two discrete sections. The first segment, fol. 21, is a synopsis of the "Dis- putation of Nahmanides," with interpolations, to be designated A2'. The second segment, fols. 22r-25v, is a compendium of polemical passages culled from a variety of sources, to be designated A22. Before resuming the examination of the text of our manuscript, the mat- ter of the identity of the writer should be briefly discussed. Such an identifi- cation is very difficult. Two names, Asher and Menahem, appear in the manuscript prefaced by the term ne'um; this word seems to designate the writer of the passage to which it is appended. Thus, Asher is associated with a discussion on fol. 22r2l relating to the issue of the Jewish exile. Similarly, Menahem is twice linked to a series of arguments on the subject of verus Israel, found on fol. 25v.22 The obvious problem is that it is all but impos- sible to determine how much more of the material preceding these names is to be associated with them. There are also references to Rabbi Nathan ben Joseph Official,23 to Rabbi Asher24 (probably the same Asher noted above) 43, 69 and passim; Nizzachon vetus, pp. 70, 81, 94, 98, 157, 174 and passim. On the use of 3inD on, see S. Y, pp. 125, 130-32 and passim; Nizzachon vetus, pp. 188, 221, 231, 235 and passim.

The only hint we can extract from these names is that the writer of A2 was a Jew from Northern France who was familiar with the Official family polemical tradition. We can make this assumption since three of the names mentioned were either members of or associated with that family.26 Moreover, the nature of the linguistic and stylistic elements of the manuscript would tend to reinforce this conclusion. The hypothesis that fragment A2 is a compilation of literary material can be conclusively demonstrated by an analysis of the arguments found in A22. This segment, like A2', contains material from polemical works written prior to the 1260s. At various points in the anti-Christian criticism pre- sented in A22 the author employs the debate format, a common feature of the genre of medieval literary polemics.27 In our source the disputants are designated the min, the sectarian - here referring to a Christian, and the ma'amin, the believer - a Jew. A comparison of the following passage, from fol. 22v of fragment A22, with a selection from Joseph Kimbi's Sefer ha-berit, demonstrates that the min-ma'amin format of our manuscript is purely a literary device, parts of which were taken from elsewhere. Thus, the association of the min with Paul and the ma'amin with a Jewish respondent, Menahem, as has heretofore been suggested,28 is unwarranted.

REMBAUM deeds all this is worthless, because faith is the total essence and deeds are secondary. The ma'amin said: I will now begin to establish that Jews practice good deeds, as is readily evident. Behold, the Jews, young and old alike, study Torah. They accustom their sons from youth to study and to go to synagogue. He removes obscenity from his mouth, accustoms him to proper language and warns him against swearing falsely. They guard their daughters from being wanton whores and [teach them] to hide themselves from men. There is no open un- chastity among them. They do not dig through walls to steal, and they do not rob people on the highways. But you, every one of you speaks obscenely. You swear by your deity, his head, his mouth, his hands, his feet, his eyes and all his body, even his nakedness and his shame. Your daughters are wanton, some of them dwelling in the "tent of whores." There are thieves and bandits among you. The Jews are pious in their actions and take pity on their brethren so that they do not have to go knocking on doors begging. They bring the poor into homes to feed them, to give them drink, to provide them with their tithes and to marry off their daughters. They redeem captives. They observe Sabbaths and festivals according to the law, but you do the opposite.) These Jews and Jewesses who are modest in all their deeds, raise their children, from the youngest to the oldest, in the study of Torah. If they hear a vile word from the mouth [of a child], they beat him and chastise him so that he would no longer swear with his lips. They train him too to pray every day. If they hear that he has become accustomed to swearing, they will keep him from [doing] so. Their daughters, with modesty, are not to be seen about nor found wanton like the daughters of the gentiles who go out every- where to streetcorners ... I tell you further that whenever a Jew stops at the home of his fellow for a day or two or [even] a year, he will take no payment for food from him. This is so with all the Jews in the world who act toward their brethren with com- passion. If they see their brother a captive, they ransom him; [if] naked, they clothe him and do not allow him to go about begging. They send him provisions in secret... No one can deny that all these good traits which I mentioned are found among the Jews and [that] their opposites [are found] among Christians. Fur- ther, the Jews keep their Sabbaths and festivals conscientiously . .)31 31. Talmage, Book of the Covenant, pp. 32-33.</page><page sequence="9">REEVALUATION OF A MEDIEVAL POLEMICAL MANUSCRIPT 89 Joseph Kimhi's work was written about 1170. Like our author, he in- tended his work to be an aid to Jews confronted by polemizing Christians. He, too, ostensibly wrote the piece in response to a request from a student,32 and, in employing the debate format, used the terms min and ma'amin to refer to the disputants. A comparison between these two passages from A22 and Sefer ha-berit reveals no less than fifteen common elements in the argumentation: 1) Both faith and acts are necessary in Judaism. 2) Jews do not steal. 3) Christians are known to be bandits. 4) Jews teach Torah to young and old alike. 5) Jewish children are strictly reprimanded if they engage in vile talk. 6) Jewish children regularly attend synagogue. 7) Jewish children are cau- tioned against taking false oaths. 8) Jewish girls are taught proper morals. 9) Christian girls are wanton. 10) Jews provide food and lodging for other Jews. 11) Jews provide charity to the poor, thereby 12) preventing them from having to knock on doors and beg for food and sustenance. 13) Jews redeem Jewish captives. 14) Jews observe the Sabbath and festivals; 15) Christians however, do not. A22's dependence on Sefer ha-berit for this passage is further demonstrated by similarities in terminology. Both works use, in similar contexts, terms such as: 'emunah nekhonah, hirgil le-hitpallel, melastim ha-beriyyot ba-derakhim, le-hahbziq be-yad ha-yehudim, .bozer (sho'el) 'al ha-petahbim. While it could be argued that such terminology simply represents traditional Hebrew usage, the extent of the linguistic similarity, when considered along with the thematic and contextual paral- lels, cannot be dismissed as coincidental. The "debate" in fragment A22 continues with the min raising the issue of Jewish money-lending and responding to the answer of the ma'amin with a reference to Christian hermits (w'~~,x-o1));33 the discussion then turns to the issue of Jesus' incarnation (fol. 23r). This sequence of themes, including a reference to hermits, is identical to the continuation of the text of Sefer ha- berit.34 Moreover, the respective discussions of the incarnation in the two sources display a similarity of both thought and language.

Note the parallels in theme: 1) The entering into a female's womb. 2) The physical filth associated with Jesus' birth. 3) Jesus' need for food and drink. 4) Jesus' passing water and excrements. 5) The diminution of God's glory. 6) A warning to those who believe in the incarnation.

While these types of arguments against the incarnation are common in Jewish polemical literature,38 the selection of these particular points, with their emphasis on the diminishing of God's glory and the resultant impend- ing doom, coupled with the similarity in language would again seem to rule out random coincidence.

REMBAUM (The minim heretically interpret ... and say to us: You gnaw at the bone, but we eat the meat and the marrow inside. For the biblical text taken literally is the body and the bone, but the allegory is the spirit and the marrow is figura. We interpret spiri- tually, according to allegory.) (The min said: You understand most of the Torah literally while we understand it figuratively. Your whole reading of the Bible is errone- ous for you resemble him who gnaws at the bone, while we [suck at] the marrow within.)41 Note the similarity in argumentation and terminology. In both sources the Jewish response that follows emphasizes that the prophets taught the law to Israel literally. The writers go on to explain that where the literal meaning of the Bible conforms to the dictates of reason, that meaning is to be accepted. When the literal meaning does not coincide with a rational understanding, then, and only then, can a figurative interpretation be sought. Both authors incorporate an example of a ship on the ocean to clarify their presentations. This exegetical approach, with its stress on the necessity of the reasonable- ness of the literal sense of the biblical text in combination with a qualified acceptance of figurative or allegorical interpretation, is typical of Provenqal Jewish exegesis.42 The Sefer ha-berit is a product of that tradition. There can be little doubt that the compiler of A22 had Sefer ha-berit material before him which he reworked and incorporated into his compilation. The suggestion that fragment A22 be viewed as a collection of arguments drawn from extant polemical literature is further reinforced by the presence 41. Talmage, Book of the Covenant, pp. 46-47. 42.

If you say that he prayed concerning the flesh, how did his prayer help him? And if he prayed concerning the divinity, divinity does not need to be saved.

However, if you say that he did not wish to be saved, [he was a fool, for] anyone who prays for something he does not want is a fool. I ask further: Did he pray for the salvation of his flesh or of his divinity? If you say the flesh, then his prayer was of no avail. If you say the divinity, divinity needs no salva- tion. I ask you further: When he was shouting for salvation, could he save himself or not? If you say that he could, he is to be considered a fool, for whoever can save himself does not shout for salvation by someone else. If he could not save himself and shouts, he is to be considered a weakling. Now, since you say that his divine nature united with the flesh, all of him [including] his divin- ity weakened.)46 The similarity between these two passages is clear, but it does not stop here. After a passage concerning the nature of Jesus' soul, the Vikkuahb proceeds to criticize the Christian interpretation of Psalms 2:8: "Ask of me, and I will make nations your heritage, and the world your possession." The question is raised as to whether this verse refers to Jesus' material nature or to his divine nature. If it alludes to the former then it could not be true since Jesus never ruled. If it is stated with regard to the latter it would also be untrue, since nothing could be given to God: i"vub x5 anwi K1xn , 1nan' Irn xin *ln  , ,in.im.r ,i n x vS an x Inx .47 The same argument, in somewhat different words, follows in A22 after the section discussing Psalms 22. It is worth not- ing that in both A2 and the Vikkuab the psalms are cited in the same order. There is a third section of A22 that has its parallel in the pseudo-Radaq source. A series of challenges to Jesus' Davidic lineage is raised, including an argument on the matter of inheriting a pedigree. 46. Talmage, "Hebrew Polemical Treatise," p. 338. 47.

One's lineage is traced only through his father, as it is said, "Every man by his own standard, under the banner of his patriarchal house." Similarly, the daughter of a priest married to a non-priest does not eat terumah, and her children are unfit for the priesthood.) (I shall demonstrate to you further that your words are nonsense. A man does not establish his lineage from his mother's tribe but from his father's. It is so stated in the verse "each with his standard, under the banner of his ancestral house." It is clear that if a daughter of a priest marry a nonpriest, she is not allowed to eat of the priestly offerings, nor are her sons eligible for the priest- hood.)50 In the course of these discussions of Mary's ties to the Davidic line the term n,' is used in both sources. Since our writer, in another context, uses the term aTgn when referring to Jesus' mother,51 his employing nKn' in this pas- sage is further evidence of a link to the traditions found in the Vikkuab. These parallels with the Vikkuahb ha-RaDaQ demonstrate, even more con- clusively, that fragment A22 is a composite work. It is difficult to ascertain if these A2 sections were adapted from the pseudo-Radaq piece itself or if the compilers of both works had a third source before them. Any definite conclusions regarding the dependence of A22 on the Vikkuab must be suspended pending a clarification of the iden- tity of the latter, which is itself a compilation of different sources.52 This 48.

REMBAUM caveat notwithstanding, it can hardly be suggested that the Vikkuab took its material from MS 53-A2, since our source, compiled during or after 1269, postdates the Vikkuab, which was probably written in the early 1200s.53 A22 also contains material that appears in the Nizzachon vetus.54 On fol. 22 of our manuscript are three arguments, employing passages from the New Testament, which criticize Jesus' messiahship and divinity. The first55 is a refutation of Jesus' Davidic genealogy, based on Matthew 1:1-16. This segment is almost identical to a critique noted on pp. 186-87 of the Nizza- chon.56 The second passage, citing Matthew 13:53-58, emphasizes that Jesus himself recognized his human origins in that he did not deny being the son of Joseph and having siblings.57 The parallel is found in the Nizzachon on pp. 202-4. It is also in fragment B of MS 53, on fol. 52. The third section challenges the legitimacy of the Trinitarian doctrine on the basis of Matthew 28:16-20 where Jesus states that he was given kingship over heaven and earth.58 The parallels are found in the Nizzachon, pp. 218-19, and in MS 53-B, fol. 56v. Since it is likely that MS B and the Nizzachon vetus are the works of German Jews and since a Germanic term, rnrimu (?), appears at the conclusion of this segment on fol. 22v59 one can suggest that our com- piler adapted this section from German polemical traditions. These tradi- 323-26, have raised questions regarding the authorship of the Vikkuah. Others, such as Baron, History, 5:339, n. 38, have accepted the notion that David Kimbi was involved in its compila- tion. 53. On the date of the Vikkuab, see the literature cited in n. 52, above. 54. The place of origin and date of the Nizzachon vetus has been the subject of considerable scholarly discussion; see Urbach, "Etudes," pp. 60, 72; H. H. Ben-Sasson, ed., A History of the Jewish People (Cambridge, Mass., 1976), pp. 555-58; Albert Ehrman, "Confession of Sin to a Priest in the Sefer Nitzabon Yashan Noshan," Journal of Jewish Studies 28 (1977): 194; Mor- dechai Breuer, Sefer nigfahon yashan (Ramat Gan, 1978), pp. 21-23; David Berger, The Jewish- Christian Debate in the High Middle Ages (Philadelphia, 1979), pp. 32-37. The many references to German settings and the many German terms throughout the work would tend to support the suggestion that the work comes from Germany. The same holds true for the material in MS 53-B, almost all of which appears in the Nizzachon; see Urbach, "Ltudes," p. 77. 55. R., p. 65. 56. The reader is reminded that pages noted are according to the Wagenseil edition of the Nizzachon; see nn. 7 and 8 above. 57. R., p. 66. 58. R., p. 67. 59. R., p. 67, especially n. 39. See n. 54 above on the German origins of this material. The parallel passages from the Nizzachon and MS 53 have not been included in this study, since the similarity between arguments found in the Nizzachon and in our manuscript has already been pointed out by Urbach, "etudes," passim, and by Rosenthal, R., passim. The parallels with the Sefer ha-berit and the Vikkuab ha-RaDaQ were included because the presence of such material in MS 53 has not heretofore been noted.</page><page sequence="17">REEVALUATION OF A MEDIEVAL POLEMICAL MANUSCRIPT 97 tions could have been taken from the Nizzachon itself or from a polemic that served as a source for the Nizzachon. We are again faced with a problem in determining dependence, this time resulting from questions regarding the date of the Nizzachon vetus. This issue is discussed in note 54, above, and we will not attempt to resolve it in this study. Still, it is clear that fragment A22 is a composite piece. Additionally, our manuscript provides further proof of the close association between the polemicists of Northern France and their counterparts in Germany, as noted by Urbach and Rosenthal.60 To summarize, we have rejected the theory that MS 53, fragment A2 is a record of a single live debate. Rather, we suggest that the manuscript is a literary work from Northern France comprised of two sections: A22, a com- pilation of polemical traditions, appended to A2', an edited epitome of the Nahmanides disputation. A22's being a compilation of various sources can be deduced from the presence within it of material from the Sefer ha-berit of Joseph Kimhi and the Vikkuahz ha-RaDaQ, both of which antedate the manuscript and the parallels to the Nizzachon vetus. It is likely that Paul Christian's visit to France in 1269 served as the impetus for the compilation of A2. It was intended as a manual for coping either with Paul's arguments or with the increase in Christian propaganda that surely followed in his wake. Robert Chazan has noted that Paul's activities in Northern France resulted in a variety of steps being taken against the Jews in the area, including the enforcement of "Jew Badge" legislation and the requiring of Jews to attend sermons delivered by Chris- tian preachers.61 In writing his tract, our author was conforming to a pattern that began with earlier Jewish polemical writers who similarly responded to increases in anti-Jewish pressure. This pattern continued throughout the Middle Ages, resulting in the creation of a corpus of Jewish literature that can be defined as a literary genre unto itself: the anti-Christian polemic. From a literary point of view fragment A2 is significant for a number of reasons. It shows us that the Sefer ha-berit was used in Northern Europe by writers outside the narrow circle of the Provenqal Kimhi family.62 Our manuscript also demonstrates that material heretofore found only in the Vikkuab ha-RaDaQ was employed in other anti-Christian polemics.

REMBAUM thermore, A2 adds to our awareness of the use of Official and Nizzachon vetus material in thirteenth century France, and our manuscript affords us new insights into the themes, style, terminology and composite nature that are characteristic of medieval Franco-German polemics.63 Fragment A2 is also valuable as evidence for the patterns of movement of Jewish culture in Western Europe during the Middle Ages. As we have seen, the manuscript contains Provenqal critiques of Christianity that flowed into the Northern European schools.64 It is important to note the role played by the Official family in this process of transmission of traditions. The compilers and inter- locutors cited in fragment A2 have been linked with this important family in the thirteenth century Northern French Jewish community, who emigrated from the South of France to the North and eventually became associated 63. On the composite nature of the Nizzachon vetus and the Sefer Yosef ha-meqanne see Urbach, "Ltudes," p. 77, and S. Y., pp. 13-15 (Hebrew). See, also, Rembaum, "Sefer Nestor Hakomer," p. 181, n. 110. 64. There are three additional arguments in A22 that are similar to points raised in Southern French polemics. In MS 53, fol. 23v, (R., p. 69), we read: "w innp: rnn t* =-n 1w ni'nomn pn 7 a5 ' ' n TxK axion m ain D iK' i~ x .nnffl. This compares with the following from Sefer ha-berit, S.H., p. 24: .7,j nx in r3ain n &amp; .,n tvinv nix nnx It ~v ornn ,o-a -r o n xn n1 Immediately following this passage in A22 the writer argues that Jesus could only bring salva- tion to Catholics, since Jews, Muslims and Albigensians do not accept the dogmas with regard to Jesus and are, accordingly, doomed. The references to Albigensians and Bougres in this argument allude to the Christian dualists of the late twelfth and thirteenth centuries, who were dominant in Southern France and were found scattered throughout Western Europe; see R., p. 69, n. 52. This point is somewhat akin to a criticism of Jesus' messiahship found in the Mil- bemet misvah. On fol. 42v the author attacks the Christian claim that Jesus is the messiah by arguing that the messiah will bring peace to the world; however, the followers of Jesus wage war, even among themselves. He goes on to say that the messiah is supposed to lead the world to a single belief in God; instead, there are religious disputes between Rome and Byzantium and between Catholics and "heretics," as well as those holding other beliefs, who are considered lost. The identity of the heretics is clarified by a reference to them (using the same term, WT1,'vKx) on fol. 215r, where they are described in these words: tnx1 m~v tnn nt mmx it ranut Here, too, we have a clear allusion to the Southern French dualists. The third parallel is also with the Milhemet misvah. In A22, fol. 25v, (R., pp. 73-74), the Christians' claim to be the new Israel is challenged with this argument: If they are Israel why did God dissociate them from the Hebrew language and alphabet, through which the world was created, prophecy was given and the word of God was written down? In the Milbemet miSvah, fol. 103r, we read: ,almn3 n r ox 'n inx " Ifn pv5: imnm "nm xinn pvwn P nny,o P:,7,x Wj x The similarity of these arguments is not precise enough to determine with certainty if any dependence exists. However, we may have here another indication of an interchange of polemi- cal ideas between Southern and Northern France which warrants further study.</page><page sequence="19">REEVALUATION OF A MEDIEVAL POLEMICAL MANUSCRIPT 99 with the Tosafistic circles, whose membership was comprised of scholastics from both the French and German Jewish communities.65 It is reasonable to propose that families such as the Officials, coming as they did from the South, were the purveyors of ProvenCal polemical arguments in Northern France. The introduction of such polemics into the scholarly circles of Northern Europe contributed to the sophistication of the Tosafists who, in the course of their attempts to define the relationship between the Jewish and Gentile communities, developed a considerable degree of familiarity with Christian civilization. 65.
