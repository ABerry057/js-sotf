<plain_text><page sequence="1">Raul Hilberg. The Politics ofMemory: The Journey ofa Holocaust Historian. Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, 1996. 208 pp. Raul Hilberg is one of the giants of contemporary scholarship. His Destruction of the European Jews, first published in 1961, remains the single most important work about the Holocaust. In my judgment, regarding books published in the past sixty years, only Gershom Scholem's Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism has had the influence of Hilberg's Destruction as a single volume relevant to an understanding of Jewish history. I know this is a large claim about which scholars can argue-and my reference to a single volume is consciously intended to exclude huge projects like Baron's History and Goitein's Mediterranean Society-but in making it I wish primarily to indicate the magnitude of Hilberg's achievement and influence. Hilberg the scholar consciously writes as a political scientist, and his main contributions, until late in his career, have concentrated on the study of the Nazi bureaucratic machinery that was central to the murder of European Jewry. In the course of his research he has entered only marginally into the areas of the psychological and ideological, preferring instead to focus on the structure of (primarily Nazi) organizations. He has been particularly unsympathetic to explanations of the Shoah that emphasize the role of Nazi ideology in the destruction of European Jewry. Now, in this brief, highly personal memoir, we get a glimpse of Hilberg the man as he struggles to become, and to be, Hilberg the Holocaust historian. We learn of his youth in Vienna, of his parents and their unhappy marital relationship, of the family's emigration to America just in time in 1940, made possible by the intervention of his mother's relatives in America. We also learn of his early rejection of religion: "I became a rebel. Already I was contrary minded, turning away from religion which at first became irrelevant to me and then an allergy" (p. 37); of his love for religious music; of his</page><page sequence="2">290 BOOK REVIEWS deep youthful interest in geography; of his response to the Nazi takeover of Austria; of his family's sailing to Havana, where they stayed for four months; and of their move to New York City, where he attended Abraham Lincoln High School and enrolled in Brooklyn College for two years in order to study chemistry before joining the U.S. Army in 1944. He tells this early part of his story clearly and with sufficient personal detail to make it an interesting and easy read. But the essence of the book, like the essence of the man, begins to unfold--to emerge-on his return to civilian life after the war. At this juncture he switched his studies from chemistry to political science and began the scholarly journey that would occupy the remainder of his life. After finishing his B.A. at Brooklyn College, he enrolled as a graduate student at Columbia. Here he studied history and political science and took a course in modern Jewish history with Salo Baron. Of his work with Baron he reports: I came away from Baron's course with an impression of Jewish apartness, of a long-lived self-contained community that had to cope with the new expectations of governments and that had become newly vulnerable as it emerged from the ghetto. Already I was thinking of Jewish defenselessness under the Nazi regime. (p. 61) Eventually he wrote his doctoral thesis under the supervision of the German 6migr6 scholar Franz Neumann, author of the classic study of the Nazi state, Behemoth. And it was this thesis on what Hilberg characterizes as the "German perpetrators" (p. 61) that eventually matured into The Destruction of the European Jews. In his thesis he adopted the methodological position that "the perpetrator's perspective was the primary path to be followed." Indeed, this approach "became a doctrine for me, which I never abandoned" (pp. 61-62). To work on such a topic in the late 1940s and early 1950s was as unusual as it was brave. Neumann, on hearing Hilberg's proposed thesis topic, replied: "It's your [academic] funeral" (p. 66). Hilberg now briefly describes the beginnings of his deep, years-long immersion in the Nazi documents dealing with the annihilation of European Jewry. Particularly important in this regard was his inclusion in the newly formed War Documentation Project of the U.S. Government. Of this labor and its influence he writes: In the gathering of my sources I have always remained a brute-force man. My watchwords have been comprehensiveness and quantity. The more agencies</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 291 whose materials I could examine, the better, and the more paper in the files, all the better. Because the destruction of the Jews was so decentralized, it required the participation of all those agencies that had the means to perform their share of the action at the moment when the need for their contribution arose. The spectrum of offices that were ultimately involved in the process is synonymous with the concept of German government or the whole of Germany's organized society. That is the reason I could not dispense with any agency collection, why nothing seemed too remote. (p. 76) While still a graduate student Hilberg also obtained his first teaching position, at Hunter College in New York City, and then in 1954 he taught for one year at the University of Mayaguez in Puerto Rico. In 1956 he was hired by the University of Vermont, and there he stayed, despite many invitations to move, for the remainder of his career, retiring in May 1991. Between 1956 and 1961 he struggled to publish the first edition of The Destruction of the European Jews. His efforts provide a sad tale of stupid publishers--especially at Columbia University Press and at the University of Oklahoma Press-and of foolish editors. But finally, with the financial aid of a refugee Jewish philanthropist, Frank Petschek, the work was published by a new Chicago publishing house, Quadrangle Books, and the rest is history. As Hilberg recounts this history of his extraordinary success and enormous influence, the tale is dominated by a profound sadness, even an unjustified, misplaced, sense of failure. As he tells it, the past thirty-five years have been filled with, even dominated by, scholarly quarrels (especially with Lucy Dawidowicz), academic jealousy, the plagiarism of his work by others (he singles out Nora Levin), and harsh reactions (led initially by Oscar Handlin) to his thesis regarding "the active role of the Jews in their own destruction" and the relative lack of Jewish resistance. These last two subjects have remained the focus of much controversy, especially with leading Israeli scholars. (See also my new introduction to the reissue of Isaiah Trunk's Judenrat [University of Nebraska Press, 1996].) Hilberg reminisces too about the pain caused by Hannah Arendt's use and misuse of his book and the personal unhappiness that has resulted as a consequence of the popular and scholarly linking of his work with her Eichmann in Jerusalem. Strongly distancing himself from Arendt, he says, in sharp criticism of her famous (or infamous) subtitle, "there was no 'banality' in this 'evil' " (p. 150). The one-sided scholarly relationship in which Arendt</page><page sequence="4">292 BOOK REVIEWS used and abused Hilberg's research, while privately heaping scorn on him in a letter to Karl Jaspers in which she refers to him as "pretty stupid and crazy" and disparages the opening chapter of Destruction, makes particularly grim reading. The last part of Hilberg's memoir deals with more recent experiences. It reflects on his second, 1985 edition of Destruction, and includes a description of a very unpleasant sabbatical spent in Israel, primarily at Yad Vashem, where, as he judges it, he was "persona non grata" (p. 165). It ruminates about his important editing of Adam Czerniakow's Diary, which once again involved complex and ultimately unhappy relations with Yad Vashem. It tells of his warm and sympathetic reception in Germany, and the publication, to a very mixed and limited reception, of his Perpetrators, Victims, Bystanders in 1996. He concludes by quoting a private letter dated May 6, 1962 from Hans G. Adler, a survivor of Theresienstadt and the author of a major study of that camp (the letter was not addressed to Hilberg but was discovered in an archive and brought to his attention). Adler praised the research and thoroughness of Destruction but concluded: "At the end nothing remains but despair and doubt about everything, because for Hilberg there is only recognition, perhaps also a grasp, but certainly no understanding" (p. 203). Hilberg is much too hard on himself. His is a monumental achievement despite the particular criticisms that can be legitimately directed at aspects of his, as at all, great scholarship. He, and we, can say of his life's scholarly efforts what can be said of the publications of few scholars: his work made a real difference. Steven T.
