Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997. vii, 87 pp., 16 plates. Since its discovery, the Genizah manuscripts collection has attracted a large number of scholars who have investigated and studied the materials primarily for their subject matter. However, the Genizah contains a wealth of information on other aspects of the documents, such as the three distinctive vocalisation systems that were in use during the Middle Ages. The Tiberian tradition of vocalization is the most famous, and it is no surprise that students of the Genizah gave so much attention to biblical texts with Tiberian notation. While the descriptibn and interpretation of the other two vowel representations in the Genizah texts were often put in the framework of scholarly discussions of the Tiberian system, a number of publications fully recognized these other systems as standing in their own right. Paul Kahle and his school published texts, biblical as well as poetic, in which superlinear vowel signs were used. Alongside the Tiberian tradition, Kahle also</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 119 introduced one standard major division into two specific sets of graphic signs of Palestinian and Babylonian origin. The texts with Babylonian vocalization reveal a strong internal development. Their classification into a number of groups and their relevance for an understanding of the medieval tradition of Hebrew language were explained by Israel Yeivin in his The Hebrew Language Tradition as Reflected in the Babylonian Vocalisation (Jerusalem, 1985). The texts with Palestinian vocalization show an even wider variety of individual characteristics with regard to the use of signs, and, given the scarcity of sources, the discussion of this vowel system involves strict analysis and interpretation of the details. Many scholars focus their attention on a small number of biblical texts, but Joseph Yahalom bases his insights upon a corpus of piyyutim found in some 150 fragments from the Cambridge Genizah collection and another thirty complementary fragments scattered throughout the Genizah collections of other libraries. In 1970 he published an article on the Palestinian vocalization in Hedwata's qedushtot (the name of the payyetan is nowadays read as Hadutahu), and in 1988, in Leshonenu 52, a comprehensive article in Hebrew on the state of research on the Palestinian vowel system. The English version of the latter article serves as a very useful introduction to the present book, describing and discussing the scholarly progress of studies in the history of this pointing system. Yahalom rightly observes that the complexity of Palestinian superlinear vocalization demands a standardized classification and analysis of the graphemes, analogous to what E. J. Revell presented in Hebrew Texts with Palestinian Vocalization (Toronto, 1970) and in Biblical Texts with Palestinian Pointing and Their Accents (Missoula, 1977). However, Yahalom ignores Revell's method of classification and selects a number of manuscripts of which at least two leaves have survived with consistent punctuation. These manuscripts are established by piecing fragments togther and arranging them chronologically according to Yahalom's dating of the vocalization (sigla A-L). Each member of this selection was carefully studied before its value as a representative of the Palestinian tradition could be fully assessed (pp. 28-50). Close analysis of twelve such major fragments reveals a distinction between two basic graphic systems in the Palestinian tradition: one with six signs, presumed by Yahalom to be the more ancient, and one with seven signs. Both systems can be understood as representing the same tradition of Hebrew pronunciation. Yahalom treats relevant characteristics of the signs and the distinctions in vowel qualities,</page><page sequence="3">120 BOOK REVIEWS demonstrating that manuscript A has only one sign for the Tiberian qamas and patah and one sign for the Tiberian sere and segol. Manuscript C already has two signs for the a vowels with no unequivocal distinction between Tiberian qamas and patah. Manuscript D is the first to exhibit an exclusive sign for shewa mobile alongside the regular six vowel signs. Only manuscripts K and L provide a new seventh sign which corresponds in most instances to Tiberian sere. The extent to which these signs tend to indicate a coherent pattern of vowel representation is systematically studied by Yahalom. Thus, he enables the reader to discern in the general grouping of the fragments the distribution of the vowel variants, showing that from the ninth to the eleventh century Palestinian vocalizers generally sought a way to denote the difference between long and reduced vowels. The study of several other categories, such as the low vowels, the back vowels, vocalizations in the environment of semi-vowels, and diacritical marks, is equally supportive of this thesis. All of Yahalom's observations can be easily compared to the detailed descriptions of the manuscripts, including eighty-one minor fragments with sporadic pointing (pp. 51-78), as well as to sixteen plates illustrative of the divergent uses of vowel signs. The reader who takes note of Yahalom's commentaries and conclusions can only affirm that scholarly research on Hebrew vowel systems will profit considerably from this masterful study.
