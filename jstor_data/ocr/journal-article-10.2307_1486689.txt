<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gertrude Schneider. Exile and Destruction: The Fate of Austrian Jews, 1938-1945. Westport, Conn.: Praeger, 1995. xi, 234 pp. The focus of Exile and Destruction is one to which we are accustomed for East European communities during the Holocaust: a painstaking, affectionate chronicle of one particular locality and its destruction at the hands of the Nazis. In her survey of Austrian Jewry, which numbered close to 200,000 when the country was absorbed by Nazi Germany in 1938, Gertrude Schneider focuses inevitably upon Vienna, where she lived as a schoolgirl during the Hitlerian era until her deportation to Riga, together with her parents and sister, in February 1942. Tracking the fate of this gifted and highly cultivated Jewish community, the author brings two distinct qualities to her subject-ground previously covered, in whole or in part, in works by Gerhard Botz, Jonny Moser, Herbert Rosenkranz, and others. First, Schneider sees the diverse experiences of Austrian Jews through the prism of personal acquaintances and especially her own large and closely-knit middle-class family-pictured at the beginning of her book in a sumptuous, formal wedding portrait, taken in 1909. (The photo credit is to "S. Weitzmann, photographer to Her Royal Highness Archduchess Maria Josepha.") Knowing the victims' backgrounds as well as their individual fates, Schneider reminds us that the Nazis destroyed not only a people, but particular individuals-her ever-optimistic father Pinkus, born in 1898 and died in Buchenwald; her</page><page sequence="2">216 BOOK REVIEWS uncle Joachim LeWinter, born in 1884, a highly decorated officer in the First World War, murdered in the Janowsksa camp near Lvov; aunt Chaya Merlin, born in 1864, who perished in the Maly Trostinec extermination camp, near Minsk; another aunt, Toni LeWinter, born in 1905 and killed in Auschwitz; Willi Zudener, husband of a cousin, born in 1885 and murdered in Nisko, Poland; and so on. Second, having lived through these terrible events herself, and having survived persecution in Vienna, deportation to Riga, several deadly camps in Latvia and Poland, as well as a death march at the end of the war, the author punctuates her narrative with bitter, and sometimes bittersweet, images and recollections. For the author, as they will for readers, the details count: the children's Chanukah production at the Zionist organization's Palamt in December 1941, featuring the beautiful, talented Bertha Wieselthier, then thirteen; the deportation from Vienna to Lodz of the author's best friend, Martha Zieg, after returning a book that she had borrowed; the Austrian Jews' visceral reaction on hearing the particularly cruel Austrian guards speaking German with the same accent they had: "Whenever we heard the well-remembered dialect," Schneider writes, "we did our best to become invisible" (p. 163). At the close of her book, Schneider presents a detailed accounting of the fate of Austrian Jewry, two-thirds of whom found refuge elsewhere, and one-third of whom were murdered in the maelstrom she describes. Drawing on the detailed records of the Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien, as well as Austrian and other archives, she supplements the work of previous researchers with interviews and a critical review of both official documentation and some earlier volumes. A devoted daughter of the Viennese community, she has appended to her text lists of survivors of particular convoys and camps. Like the postwar books on destroyed communities in Poland and Russia, Exile and Destruction is both an assessment and a memorial. Michael R.
