<plain_text><page sequence="1">Benjamin Uffenheimer. Early Prophecy in Israel. Publications of the Perry Foun- dation for Biblical Research. Jerusalem: The Magnes Press, 1999. 591 pp. In this book (a translation of a revised version of the second Hebrew edi- tion), the late Professor Benjamin Uffenheimer examines a variety of topics in the history of prophecy from the time of Moses until the time of Elisha. The book in- cludes extensive discussions of all the prophetic figures in this period, focussing on the relation between preclassical prophecy on the one hand and magic, divina- tion, and rationalistic or monotheistic trends on the other. Uffenheimer also de- votes a lengthy chapter to alleged parallels to Israel prophecy among ancient Egyp- tians, Mesopotamians, and Northwest Semites. Uffenheimer does not present one overarching thesis, but, rather, attends to particular issues and texts while returning to several central concerns. In particu- lar, he repeatedly challenges the judgments of older scholars such as Wellhausen and Holscher, the basis of whose work has been undermined by new perspectives and evidence from the ancient Near East. This critique is salutary, since the influ- ence of these olderjudgments has endured even though their foundations have fall- en away. Uffenheimer strongly rejects the notion that prophecy arose in Israel around the time of Samuel and Saul, instead dating the origins of the prophetic movement to the era of Moses. In each chapter, Uffenheimer carefully reviews- and usually rejects-conclusions by older scholars; the very detailed treatment of older secondary literature renders this book crucial to specialists writing on any aspect of preclassical prophecy or texts in which they appear. (Uffenheimer dis- cusses secondary literature not only pertaining directly to the history of prophecy itself but also regarding the composition and development of texts that mention preclassical prophets, especially in 1-2 Kings.) At the same time, these detailed treatments will make the book less interesting to readers who are looking for a his- torical overview of early prophecy. Of particular interest is Uffenheimer's discussion of ancient Near Eastern prophecy. He takes pains to undermine the notion that many of the texts from Mesopotamia and Egypt associated with this rubric are in fact comparable to the Israelite material. While his conclusions will strike many readers as overly con- servative (and, regarding Mari texts, even stretched), he raises important questions regarding the precise definition of prophecy in ancient Israel and the relationship between prophecy and divination. His analysis of so-called apocalyptic texts im- plies an appropriate warning against the facile discovery of parallels between Is- raelite culture and the cultures of Israel's neighbors. Also noteworthy is the last 120</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews chapter's description of the tension in early prophecy between a popular, magically- oriented substrate and a theologically rational trend. Uffenheimer shows that this tension exists both within the work of the prophets themselves and in the narra- tives which were passed down and recast by their followers and later tradents. Fi- nally, the last chapter touches briefly on the movement from early to classical prophecy. Uffenheimer identifies the violent excesses of militant prophetism in the age of Elisha as well as the inherent tension between popular and rational elements as impelling prophecy in a new direction that becomes evident from the time of Amos onwards. One hopes that this issue will receive even more attention in a forthcoming volume on classical prophecy which Uffenheimer was completing at the time of his death. The book contains very lengthy discussions of issues that do not strictly be- long to the history of preclassical prophecy. For example, the chapter on Moses contains only about ten pages dealing narrowly with Moses as prophet. The other hundred pages of this chapter include a detailed discussion of the origin of mon- otheism, the light shed on the dating of the Sinai covenant by ancient Near East- ern treaties, and the traditions describing the revelation at Sinai. Similarly, the chapter on the period of the Judges devotes considerable space to the ark of the covenant, the sabbatical year, the Jubilee. The book contains two appendices, one on the redaction of the Book of Judges and the other on term segullah. Most of these discussions should be of great interest to specialists in the various subfields they treat. Unfortunately, it is likely that most scholars working on these issues will be unaware of Uffenheimer's arguments and his insightful analysis of secondary literature. In fact, one almost wonders whether the book might have been struc- tured slightly differently and given a title like Studies in the Early History and Re- ligion of Israel, which might have been more descriptive of its contents. Any library with a biblical studies collection must buy this book, and re- searchers on a wide spectrum of issues not limited to prophecy will profit by ex- amining relevant sections. I am less sure that many people will want to read the book from start to finish in order to gain insight into the broad trajectories of ear- ly prophecy. The book might be described as encyclopedic in scope rather than ori- ented towards the development of a single idea. Benjamin D. Sommer Northwestern University Evanston, Illinois</page></plain_text>
