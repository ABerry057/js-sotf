<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review 29:1 (2005), 33-60 EXPOSED TO ALL THE CURRENTS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN-A SIXTEENTH-CENTURY VENETIAN RABBI ON MUSLIM HISTORY* by Martin Jacobs The Western perception of Islam as a belligerent religion owes many of its stereotypes not only to the Crusades, but also to the early modern rivalry between the Ottoman Empire and Christian Europe. Heated debates about the "Turkish menace" dominated European political discourse until the (second) Ottoman siege of Vienna in 1683, as documented by the innumerable Turcica that circulated both swiftly and widely thanks to revolutionary advances in printing. Sixteenth-centu- ry Christian authors provided their eager readers with constantly updated versions of Ottoman history, as did some of their Jewish contemporaries. Probably the first Jew to make the Ottomans the major subject matter of his work was Elijah Cap- sali of Candia in Venetian Crete, who in 1523 completed a Hebrew chronicle titled Seder 'Eliyahu Zuta ("Minor Order of Elijah").' There was little that was new in Capsali's way of writing history. Even though the Candiote rabbi occasionally makes use of contemporary rhetorical de- vices, his writing style has more in common with that of medieval Jewish chroni- cles, which ultimately go back to biblical and rabbinic literature, than with hu- manist historiography.2 What is unprecedented in this Jewish chronicler's work is *This article is an expanded version of a paper presented at the 36th annual conference of the Association for Jewish Studies, Chicago, December 19-21, 2004. I also reconsider and develop some of the ideas outlined in my shorter article, "Das ambivalente Islambild eines venezianischen Juden des 16. Jahrhunderts: Capsalis Osmanische Chronik," Judaica 58, no.1 (2002): 2-17. The translations of Biblical verses are based on TANAKH, A New Translation of the Holy Scriptures according to the Tra- ditional Hebrew Text (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1985), but are often modified to ac- commodate the way these quotes are used within the context of Capsali's work. All other translations are mine. 1. While the manuscripts have no headline, this title occurs toward the end of the prologue, see Seder 'Eliyahu Zuta (hereafter SEZ), according to the critical edition Seder 'Eliyahu zuta le-rabbi 'Eliyahu Qapsali, ed. Aryeh Shmuelevitz, Shlomo Simonsohn, and Meir Benayahu, 3 vols. (Jerusalem: Ben-Zvi Institute, 1975-83), 1:20. Capsali's title alludes to B. Ketuvot, 106a; it is also a captatio benev- olentiae, as it can be read too as "Order of the Minor Elijah." Not until three and a half centuries after the completion of the manuscript were excerpts of SEZ published by Moses Lattes, Likutim shonim mi- sefer divre 'Eliyahu (Padua, 1869). The first complete edition did not appear until 1975. 2. Sixteenth-century Jewish historiography in general has been the subject of lively scholarly debate. In a provocative and highly readable survey, Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi relates this literature to the expulsions from the Iberian Peninsula (gerush Sefarad), a traumatic experience which-according 33</page><page sequence="2">Martin Jacobs his subject matter, or to be more precise, the extent to which he writes on non-Jew- ish history. His lengthy and detailed account of Muslim history in general and Ot- toman history in particular have no parallel in earlier Jewish literature-and only a few among later Jewish historians.3 What is also striking about Seder 'Eliyahu Zuta is the contrast between the polemical tone of the introductory chapters on the early history of Islam and the idealized portrayal of the Ottomans, Venice's pri- mary Mediterranean rivals, in the chapters that follow. It is these ambivalences and juxtapositions-medieval writing style and early modern subject matter; distinc- tively Rabbinic worldviews and contemporary Venetian perspectives; polemical debates on the origins of Islam and idealized admiration of the current rulers of the Islamic world-that make Capsali such a fascinating figure of study. to him-gave rise to a renewed Jewish interest in history, thereby breaking with a centuries-old rab- binic disinterest in historiography. (Y.H. Yerushalmi, "Clio and the Jews: Reflections on Jewish Histo- riography in the Sixteenth Century," Proceedings ofthe American Academy ofJewish Research 46-47 [1979-80]: 607-38; idem, Zakhor: Jewish History and Jewish Memory [Seattle: University of Wash- ington, 1982], 60-75). However, Ivan Marcus (among others) strongly questions the notion that the trauma of 1492 served as a catalyst for Jews to abandon old traditions and open up to "modern" world- views in fields like historiography. (I.G. Marcus, "Beyond the Sephardic Mystique," Orim 1 [1985/86]: 35-53.) Probably the most outspoken critic of Yerushalmi's is Robert Bonfil, who questions whether there was any "rise" in Jewish historiography at all in the "early modern" period. As he points out, the literary models of the very few extant sixteenth-century Jewish books dealing with historical topics do not differ from that of medieval (Jewish or Christian) chronicles. It is for this reason that Bonfil refers to sixteenth-century Jewish historiography as the "swan song" of the Middle Ages." (Bonfil, "How Golden Was the Age of the Renaissance in Jewish Historiography?" in Essays in Jewish Historiogra- phy, ed. Ada Rapoport-Albert, 2nd ed.

Jahrhunderts (Tiibin- gen: Mohr Siebeck, 2004), 36-57. 3. Three decades later, in 1554, Joseph ha-Kohen (1496-after 1577) of Genoa would publish his Sefer divre ha-yamim le-malkhe Zarefat u-vet Otoman ha-Togar ("Chronicle of the Kings of France and of the Kings of the Dynasty of 'Othman the Turk"); for a recent study, see Martin Jacobs, "Joseph ha-Kohen, Paolo Giovio, and Sixteenth-Century Historiography," in Cultural Intermediaries: Jewish Intellectuals in Early-Modern Italy, ed.

Another Hebrew chronicle comparable to Capsali's is Yosef Sambari's Sefer divre Yosef ("Book of Joseph's Words"), written in Cairo in 1673; it contains a history of the Jews in Islamic lands, including an extensive framework on Muslim history; see the critical edition by Shi- mon Shtober, Sefer divre Yosefle-rabbi Yosefben rabbi Yizhaq Sambari (Jerusalem: Ben-Zvi Institute, 1994) (including an introduction); Jacob Lassner, The Middle East Remembered: Forged Identities, Competing Narratives, Contested Spaces (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 2000), 341-85; Ja- cobs, Islamische Geschichte, 109-27, 221-258; for Shtober's articles on Sambari, see below notes 88 and 105. 34</page><page sequence="3">Exposed to All the Currents of the Mediterranean CAPSALI'S CULTURAL BACKGROUND Elijah Capsali4 (c. 1485-1555) was born in Candia (present-day Iraklion), the capital of Crete, which in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade (1204) had been incorporated into the Venetian Empire (it would remain under the banner of St. Mark until the Ottoman conquest of 1669).5 By Capsali's time, Candia had become a thriving hub of Venetian trade and commerce in the eastern Mediterranean. Al- though the Jewish community in Candia profited greatly from this commercial prosperity, their legal status was, like that of the native Greek Orthodox popula- tion (regarded as schismatic by the Roman Catholics), far below that of the Venet- ian colonialists (to say the least). Unlike the Greeks, the Jews of Candia (and oth- er Cretan towns such as Chania) were confined to a segregated quarter of the city called Zudecca (i.e., Giudecca) in the Venetian dialect, and were forced to wear a yellow badge when in public. Despite these discriminatory restrictions, however, Jews had one significant advantage over other non-Latin local communities in the Venetian colonies: they enjoyed their own communal organization and institutions, the autonomy of which saw little interference by the authorities apart from the fact that the condestabulo (i.e., contestabile, "responsible"), the civil head of the Jew- ish community of Candia, had to be approved by the signoria. The reason for this was obvious: the Jewish representatives were "responsible" for the payment of the collective taxes. Up to the time of Capsali-to be exact, until 1541 -Venetian legislation of- ficially excluded Jews from participation in international trade. Still, they were not alone in being excluded since all foreigners, as well as most of the population of the Venetian Empire, were barred from the commerce flowing through the lagoon city; the Levant trade was regarded as the sole prerogative of Venetian patricians and upper-class citizens.6 Since the fourteenth century, however, there had been mention of Cretan Jews in the sources about the commercial intercourse between Venice and the eastern Mediterranean.7 This was because the legal status and eco- 4.

Moreover, they actively participated in the regional trade that was not considered the exclusive domain of Venetian citizens. The multilingual talents of the Cretan Jews, many of whom were equally fluent in Greek and Italian (as well as in Hebrew) made them ideal middlemen in the commercial exchange of the east- ern Mediterranean. In addition, they enjoyed preferential business relations with Jewish merchants living under Ottoman rule.11 Although Capsali's interest in Ottoman affairs was certainly a result of his living in one of the major port cities through which flowed much of the Levant trade, the multicultural atmosphere of a commercial hub does not fully explain why he wrote Seder 'Eliyahu Zuta. By composing a chronicle of the Ottomans he not only picked a fashionable topic but also a typical genre of contemporary Italian lit- erature. However, as he never mentions-or admits-to having read any non-Jew- ish literature (see following discussion),12 one may easily underestimate the extent to which he was acquainted with the Italian cultural trends of his time. Elijah Capsali was first exposed to Italian influences during his youth in Venetian-ruled Candia. His father, Rabbi Elkanah Capsali, served as condestabu- 8.

It was only in 1509 that Jews-in this case refugees from the armies of the League of Cam- brai-were admitted to Venice; the first, so-called "new" ghetto was established in 1516.

The admission of Ottoman Jewish traders to Venice in 1541 was intended to revive Venetian prospects in the Levantine trade, which had suffered significantly as a result of changing economic conditions and the Venetian- Ottoman war of 1537-40.

In 1508, he went to Padua where, like his father before him, he studied at the famous yeshivah of Judah Minz.'5 Nine years later, he would in- corporate some of his experiences in Padua into his first historical work, Sipure Venezia ("Stories of Venice"), also known as Divre ha-yamim le-malkhut Venezia ("Chronicle of the Venetian Empire"),16 a title that echoes Venetian municipal chronicles.17 In adapting an Italian genre of historiography to Jewish tradition, Caspali made a remarkable cultural transfer, which he was to repeat again in his Ottoman chronicle. Though Capsali was primarily concerned with chronicling the history of the yeshivot in Northern Italy,'8 he opened his Sipure Venezia with a sur- vey of Venetian history from its legendary origins to the year 1516. In so doing, he echoed the widespread "myth ofVenice," aspects of which were articulated by such sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Jewish intellectuals as Isaac Abravanel, David de Pomis, and, most notably, Simone Luzzatto.19 When in 1509 the League of Cambrai overran the Venetian mainland, Cap- sali fled Padua to Venice, which for the first time was allowing Jews to stay in the city.20 Not long afterwards, however, he returned to Candia where from 1518 he served as rabbi and was appointed several times as the civil representative-con- destabulo-of the Jews to the Venetian authorities, once again following in the 13.

During the plague of 1523 he was one of the officials in charge of the quarantine regulations. When the epidemic got completely out of control and the authorities imposed a curfew on the Zudecca,21 Capsali was con- fined to his house for more than three months. It was during this time that Capsali wrote his Ottoman chronicle "in order to expel the fear of the bitterness of death and to focus the mind on other things, 'that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become a waste' (Genesis 47:19)."22 Capsali's dramatic account of the circumstances in which he composed his chronicle, however, accords with contemporary literary conventions,23 and may have been intended primarily as an apologia auctoris for writing such a detailed account of non-Jewish history. In any case, Capsali seems to have felt the need to justify his choice of subject matter, since even as he writes about non-Jewish his- tory, he explicitly rejects "non-Jewish wisdom" (hokhmot nokhriyot).24 Although Capsali made use of certain themes and stylistic devices of contemporary Italian literature, he was no Jewish "Renaissance man." Unlike his elder relative, Elijah Delmedigo (c. 1460-97),25 Capsali rejected Aristotelian metaphysics and in so doing reflects the gradual shift among some Jewish thinkers from scholastic phi- losophy towards the study of the Kabbalah, the beginnings of which can be traced back in Candia to the second half of the fifteenth century.26 Nevertheless, in tack- ling a popular topic of Italian historiography, Capsali could not help but absorb a certain amount of "foreign wisdom." We come now to the central question posed by this study: Why and for what audience would a conservative-minded rabbi living in a Venetian colony compose a detailed chronicle of Muslim history? Given that he wrote his Seder 'Eliyahu Zuta in highly stylized Hebrew, interspersed with innumerable allusions to the Hebrew Bible and rabbinic literature, the work must have been intended for a traditionally trained Jewish audience. But what benefit could a pious Jew be expected to derive 21. SEZ, ch. 165, 2:107; see Benayahu, Qapsali, 121. 22. SEZ, ch. 166, 2:109. 23.

E. Bianchi, C. Salinari, and N. Spegno (Milano, Naples, n.d.), Novel- la 1, 7-9; for more details, see Jacobs, Islamische Geschichte, 79-80. 24. Capsali complains that "almost all of our contemporaries are inclined towards non-Jewish wisdom (hokhmat nokhriyot)," (see SEZ, chap. 138, 1:376) thereby alluding to the rabbinic advice not to teach ones son "Greek wisdom" (hokhmah yevanit, B. Sota, 49a). 25.

In a kind of a prologus de ratione operis (to use the contemporary Latin terminology) in which he outlines his authorial "intentions" (Hebrew: sibbot kavvanati), Capsali responds to just such anticipated objections and argues for the usefulness of his work.27 In prefac- ing his work with a detailed exposition of how and why he came to write it, which is, as Bonfil has noted, a common feature of medieval Christian chronicles,28 Cap- sali betrays the extent to which he has incorporated "foreign wisdom" into his thinking. Capsali informs us that the first ratio (i.e., Sibbah) of his work is: That man may learn wisdom and understanding in hearing the stories ... that we will tell of the kings of gentiles and the Turks (Togarmim), and especially of the wisdom of the great king, Sultan Selim, whose like has never been among the kings of the gentiles. Certainly, "The wise man, hearing them, will gain more wisdom; the discerning man will learn to be adroit" (Proverbs 1:5).29 The desire to teach his readers "wisdom and understanding" recalls the clas- sical definition of history as magistra vitae (Cicero). In depicting Sultan Selim I (1512-20), under whom the Ottoman Empire had vastly extended in size, as an unparalleled example of wise leadership, Capsali follows the common use in con- temporary non-Jewish historiography of the lives of certain "illustrious men" as moral exempla.30 In so doing, however, the rabbi of Candia was not expressing his agreement with the ideals of humanist historiography; Capsali had little in com- mon with the secular tendencies of contemporary Italian historians such as Paolo Giovio (1486-1552), to mention one of the most prominent names.31 That Cap- sali's understanding of history followed instead the "medieval" tradition is docu- mented by the way he articulates the second ratio of his work: The second reason is that "all the peoples of the earth shall know" (Joshua 4:24) "that the Lord alone is God" (Deuteronomy 4:35.39) and "that there is divine justice on earth" (Psalm 58:12). For whoever will read my stories, my 27. See Jacobs, Islamische Geschichte, 65-67. 28.

The humanist historian Paolo Giovio dealt with the Ottomans in two of his works, one of which was a "commentary" (Commentario de le cose de' turchi [Venice, 1531]) that, as can be seen in its dedication to Charles V, was intended as a short instruction in preparation of a possible war against the Ottomans. (See note 127 for more on the genre of the commentario). In addition, Giovio included extensive chapters on the Ottomans in his multivolume Historia Sui Temporis (Florence, 1550-52).

Then all this (Jewish) people will know that "the eyes of the Lord are scanning the whole earth" (Zachariah 4:10), "observing the bad and the good" (Proverbs 15:3), "so as to repay every man according to his ways, and with the proper fruit of his deeds" (Jeremiah 32:19), and that He watch- es (mashgiah) over the nations to overthrow one people and to raise another one.32 In the spirit of medieval historiography, both Christian and Jewish, Capsali regarded it the task of the historian to teach his readers to fear God and strength- en their belief in divine providence (hashgahah). According to Capsali, the histo- ry of non-Jewish peoples, their rulers and their wars, provided evidence for the claim "that there is divine justice on earth" (Psalm 58:12), and he interpreted this history according to Biblical patterns according to which the fall and rise of em- pires follows a divine master plan: Peruse the chapters of this book ... ,have a look at its stories, pay attention and see that in His wisdom and understanding the Lord ... has made these Turks a strong and mighty people, "He blessed their efforts and spread their possessions in the land" (cf. Job 1:10). The Lord brought them from a distant land and blessed them exceptionally. The Turk is the "rod of' His "anger" and the "staff of' His "fury" is in their (i.e., the Turks') "hand" (cf. Isaiah 10:5), so that he may strike with his hand the nations, people, and noble states, whose measure has been filled. "For the Lord is an all-knowing God; by Him actions are measured" (1 Samuel 2:3).33 For Capsali, the migration of the Turks and their rise to empire followed the biblical model of Isaiah 10:5-11: just as the rise of Assyria was a rebuke to the Biblical kingdom of Israel, so were the Turks empowered to punish Christianity. The fact that Capsali replaced "Israel" with Christendom hints at the Christian ori- gin of this typology: after the conquest of Constantinople by Mehemet II (1453), Christian exegetes often associated Isaiah 10:5 with the Turks, although the sin they regarded as having provoked this severe punishment differed depending on their particular religious affiliation. Roman Catholics, for example, saw the fall of Byzantium as a divine verdict on the Greek Orthodox "schismatics" and warned Protestant "heretics" of an even more severe punishment.34 Capsali translated this Christian interpretation into a Jewish context. In his view, the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople was Christianity's punishment for the injustice the Jews had suf- fered under its rule, just as the fall of the Byzantine Empire could be attributed to the persecution of Judaism by the malkhut Yavan, "the kingdom of Greece."

For, the measure of the wicked kingdom of Greece (malkhut Yavan) was full, because of all the evil they had inflicted on Judah and Israel since they (that is, the "Greeks") had become a people. Then the Lord spoke to Himself: . .. "I will blow upon" Constantinople, "with the fire of my wrath" (Ezekiel 21:36) and consume it. "I will march against it and set it on fire" (Isaiah 27:4). Because of the evil that the Greeks inflicted on my people, on my nation, I will give it (i.e., Constantinople) into the hand of the executor of my ban and will pour out my wrath over them.35 To further legitimate the historical mission he associated with the Turks, Capsali opens his account of Ottoman history with a dream ascribed to the epony- mous founder of the Ottoman dynasty, 'Othminn I (c. 1300-24):36 In those days, 'Othmdn had an important and powerful dream: The Lord let 'Othmdn see that from his head a small tree began to grow, and it became taller until finally it became a very tall and majestic tree that "produced branches and sent out boughs" (Ezekiel 17:6) .... In the morning, 'Othmin was agi- tated and sent for his friends, advisors, and relatives and told them his dream. They told him: This certainly means that an empire will arise from your loins and will ascend to heaven and to the stars.37 The dream vision recounted here echoes one of the famous founding legends of the Ottoman Empire, well known from official Ottoman chronicles, where it oc- curs in several versions.38 This legend projects the imperial ambitions of the sul- tans back into the time of their origins and depicts their rise as part of a divine plan that was already revealed to the dynasty's founder.

This discrepancy would suggest that the Jewish chronicler did not depend on an Ottoman source: apart from the fact that he probably could not read Turkish, his many historical errors39 indicate that Capsali did not make use of Ot- toman historiography.40 It is likely that Capsali was drawn to this well-known Ottoman founding leg- end because it employed literary motifs that could be also found in the Hebrew Bible: for example, Ezekiel 31:3-9, uses the tree metaphor for the Assyrian Em- pire, and in Daniel 4 Nebuchadnezzar's dream vision contains imagery that is very similar to that of the Ottoman foundation myth.41 In other words, this famous Ot- toman legend fit extremely well into Capsali's view of history, according to which all future historical events are already predicted, if indirectly, in the Hebrew Bible. The belief in the divine origin of monarchical power is certainly not unique, and can be found in many cultures and religions. Capsali, however, goes so far as to claim the divine investiture of the Ottomans for a specific historical mission. To strengthen his point, he even allows himself an excursus into the mythical domain with the description of a heavenly assembly on the New Year,42 at which God re- veals His plans for the Ottomans to the host of angels: And the angels and the entire heavenly host responded: Praised be the name of the Lord of the world, "who changes times and seasons, removes kings and installs kings" (Daniel 2:21). At the same time, "a voice came down from heaven: It has been decreed" (Daniel 4:28), 'Othmdn, that a strong, mighty and noble empire will be given to you, that will collect taxes on the land and divide the sea ... ; it "will be as 39. For example, Capsali reverses the order of Murdd I (1360-89) and Blyazid I (1389-1403), see Jacobs, Islamische Geschichte, 146-49. 40. It is also doubtful that Capsali was familiar with any Ottoman chronicle written in Hebrew, as his spelling of Turkish names usually follows the Italian rendering. In contrast, compare the text of the Oxford manuscript (Hebrew E 63) that gives quite an exact Hebrew transcription of the Ottoman- Turkish text (tevarFkh-i dl-i 'osmdn) of the so-called Anonymous Chronicles (Friedrich Giese [ed.], Die Altosmanischen Anonymen Chroniken [Breslau, 1922]). This ms. was first noted by Adolf Neubauer in his Catalogue of the Hebrew Manuscripts in the Bodleian Library (vol. 2 [Oxford, 1906], col. 357, no. 2866), and later identified by Franz Babinger, "Eine Altosmanische Anonyme Chronik in Hebrliischer Umschrift," Archiv Orientclni 4 (1932): 108-11 (including a facsimile). Babinger dates the Sephardic script of the ms. to the sixteenth century. 41. Daniel 4:7-9: "In the visions of my mind in bed I saw a tree of great height in the midst of the earth; the tree grew and became mighty; its top reached heaven, and it was visible to the ends of the earth. Its foliage was beautiful and its fruit abundant; there was food for all in it. Beneath it the beasts of the field found shade, and the birds of the sky dwelt on its branches; all creatures fed on it." It is probable that the Ottoman legend indirectly echoes the biblical motif.

Medieval Jewish and Christian ex- egetes alike often associated this "iron" kingdom with Rome or the rule of Chris- tendom. In identifying it with the Ottomans, Capsali was, however, following the precedent set by the twelfth-century Jewish exegete Abraham 'Ibn 'Ezra who, hav- ing lived under both Christian and Muslim rule, held that Christendom (malkhut 'Edom) was only the "third," that is, penultimate, empire44 and that the last king- dom of world history was the Islamic empire (malkhut Yishma'el).45 In 1523, the year Capsali completed his chronicle (almost four hundred years after 'Ibn 'Ezra), the Ottoman Empire would certainly seem to fit Daniel's de- scription of the "iron kingdom" extremely well: it had already conquered much of the Islamic world and expanded far into southeastern and central Europe. In fact, Capsali provides a detailed description in Seder 'Eliyahu Zuta of one of the most important Ottoman wars of expansion, the campaign of Selim I against the Mam- luks (1516-17) that subjected Syria, Palestine, and Egypt to the Sublime Porte.46 According to Capsali, it was God Himself who inspired Selim I to wage war against the Mamluk sultan Qansawh al-Ghawri (1501-16): In the year (5)276 (after the creation, i.e., 1516 CE), the Lord called Sellm, the king of kings ... and inspired him to destroy ... the kingdom of the sul- tan who rules the kingdom of Egypt (i.e., the Mamluk sultan). .. .47 And later, the text continues the same biblical style: And the Lord spoke to Himself: 'Behold, I summon my servant Selim to set up his throne in Egypt; "and he will gain control over treasures of gold and sil- ver and over all the precious things of Egypt" (Daniel 11:43).48 43. SEZ, ch. 6, 1:43. 44. In order to achieve this goal, 'Ibn 'Ezra had to unite "Greece" and "Rome" into one empire; see 'Ibn 'Ezra's commentary to Daniel 2:39, The Short Commentary on Daniel: A Critical Edition (He- brew), ed. A. Mondshine (M.A. Thesis, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, 1977), 12,7-9: "The third em- pire is a western empire, i.e., the empire of Greece (Yavan) and of the Kittim.

Capsali went much further than 'Ibn 'Ezra, who had simply identified the malkhut Yishmacel with the "fourth kingdom" without engaging in any specific his- torical detail. And unlike his predecessor, the sixteenth-century chronicler com- bined this exegesis with a promise of messianic redemption, as evidenced by his interpretation of Isaiah 19:1: "Mounted on a swift cloud, the Lord will come to Egypt; Egypt's idols shall tremble before Him." Reading this verse allegorically, Capsali equates the "swift cloud" with Selim I49 and then goes on to explain the second half of the biblical quote as follows: The meaning (kavvanah) herein is that after Sultan Selim has ruled in Egypt "the idols shall vanish completely" (Isaiah 2:18). The idols that are there (i.e., in Egypt) will be destroyed, and this will happen in the time of redemption; (... ) for soon, speedily, our true messiah will come .... Since the time of the expulsion from Spain (gerush Sefarad), the Lord has undoubtedly begun to ingather the exiles of Israel and he will ingather the dis- persed people of Judah from the four corners of the earth.50 For Capsali, Selim's I campaign against the Mamluks was a prelude to the ingathering of the exiles and the coming of the messiah. By making a connection between the Ottoman conquest of Syria-Palestine and the gerush Sefarad, he was able to interpret the expansion of Ottoman rule over the Middle East as the paving of the way for the repatriation of the Jews to the Land of Israel. Thus, he includes in his chapters on the reign of Bayazid II (1481-1512), the contemporary of the Spanish expulsion, a lengthy section on the history of the Jews of Spain (sippur Sefarad), and even claims to quote a "copy" (patshegen) of the original expulsion edict "signed with the name of the king and the queen,"5' that is, Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile. Capsali's quotation is so different from its known Spanish versions, however, that it is doubtful that he had access to any such offi- cial document.52 Rather, his information was based in part on the works of Abra- vanel,53 and in part on the oral histories of Sephardic refugees coming through 49. SEZ, ch. 134, 1:366. To this aim, he makes use of gimatria, arguing that the Hebrew word for "swift" (QL = 130) has the same numerical value as the name Selim. This, however, makes it nec- essary for him to claim that Sellm is spelled Samekh, Lamed, Mem (= 130) "in Turkish," while Cap- sali usually transcribes the name with the letters Sin, Lamed, Yud, Mem (= 380). 50.

By inserting the story of the expulsion of the Iberian Jews into his descrip- tion of Bayazid II's reign, Capsali creates the impression that the two were direct- ly related to each other. Actually, as Henry Kamen shows in his critical reassess- ment of the Sephardic migration,56 most Iberian exiles first went to geographically closer places of refuge such as Provence or Italy, and only when expelled from these places did they migrate to the East. Therefore there was often a gap of one or more generations between the Iberian expulsions and the arrival of the sefaradim in the realm of the sultans.57 Moreover, the account of Capsali according to which Bayazid II explicitly invited the Jews to settle in his reign cannot be substantiated by any extant docu- ment.58 Capsali's wording of this "invitation" is a literary creation made up of bib- lical allusions and modeled on the edict of Cyrus according to Ezra 1:1: "Had not the Lord of Hosts left us some survivors" (Isaiah 1:9), and let us find mercy with Sultan Biyazid, the king of Turkey,-so that he received the Jews with friendship and issued "a proclamation throughout his realm by word of mouth and in writing as follows" (Ezra 1:1): 'Whosoever wishes to dwell in My kingdom and My realm may gladly come and shall not delay'-(if that had not happened) "We should be like Sodom, another Gomorrah" (Isaiah 1:9).59 By linking the Iberian expulsion(s) with the reign of Bayazid II, Capsali gives the impression that there was a linear development from one to the other, a 54.

In his glorification of Selim I, by whose conquests the empire had been vast- ly increased in size, Capsali goes so far as to compare him with Alexander the Great and other world rulers of antiquity: If heaven had enabled him to live a little longer ... ,he would have ruled the world as did Cyrus, Darius, Alexander the Macedon, and other kings, who ruled from one end of the world to the other. But heaven did not help him, and in the prime of his life he left his army to others (to lead).60 In comparing Selim I to Alexander, Capsali is echoing contemporary Chris- tian authors such as Teodoro Spandugino, who often make the same analogy. In his collection of short biographies of the Ottoman sultans (Paris, 1519),61 which in many ways bears some similarity to Capsali's chronicle, Spandugino claims that the sultan "constantly read the works and deeds of Alexander the Macedon and as- pired to surpass him in fame and celebrity."62 As was typical in sixteenth-century historiography, Spandugino depicted the sultan as an educated monarch who stud- ied the ancient classics in order to derive from them exempla useful for his own political strategy. As Capsali stresses, it was only his premature death that prevented Selim I from ruling "from one end of the world to the other." But why then did "heaven not help" Selim I, given that his campaign against the Mamluks was for the divine purpose of enabling the ingathering of the exiled Jews? Capsali draws on theolog- ical arguments to explain this problem, arguing that because Selim had grown haughty and bloodthirsty as a result of his military successes, he was unfit to rule during the time of redemption. For this reason, the coming of the messiah had been postponed until the reign of Selim I's son Siileymdn I.63 This kind of argumenta- tion clearly echoes the narrative of the biblical Chronicles, according to which Solomon (the eponym of Siileyman) was allowed to build the Temple, an honor de- nied his father, David, who had become "a man of battles and bloodshed" (1 Chron- icles 28:3).64 As Capsali completed Seder 'Eliyahu Zuta in 1523, the last chapters of his chronicle only cover the first years of Siileyman I's (1520-66) reign: it concludes 60.

A closer look at this description can help us understand more fully his theological in- terpretation of history and his sources of information. Capsali describes the landing of the Ottoman troops on the island of Rhodes from the perspective of the Knights of St. John-whom he calls Rhodiani-there- by hinting at the source of his information: It happened on the 25th of Giugno 1522, on the holy day of the Rhodiani, the feast of San Giovanni-who among all the saints is the one whom the Rhodi- ani have elevated over themselves: they depicted him on their banner (which flew) above their troops. On the evening of the aforementioned feast, in the twentieth hour, the Rhodiani lifted up their eyes and, behold, they saw a con- voy of ships that filled the sea.66 Our chronicler calls attention to the fact that the Ottoman entry into the city of Rhodes, which had been evacuated by the Knights after a long siege, took place on the "feast of the Christians (goyim) called natale (N'ZL), which is the birthday of their god."67 That Capsali viewed Christianity as a form of idolatry is evidenced by his expressions of joy over the pillage of the Church of St. John: Then the Turks entered the prayer house of San Giovanni and smashed all the idols of the Christians (zalme ha-goyim) and crushed them. They also ex- humed all the corpses of the Grand Masters (of St. John) that were therein and dismembered them. They emptied the building of all that was in it, and took everything out, sparing neither gold nor silver. Then came the king (Siileymin), who stood in the city square, the afore- mentioned prayer house behind him, and prostrated before the God of Heav- en, who had given his enemies into his hands.68 The difference in Capsali's attitudes towards Christianity and Islam ex- pressed here is quite striking: while he regards the religious practices of the Order of St. John as idolatrous, he portrays the sultan as a pious man thanking the God of Heaven (that is, the God of the Jews) for granting him victory. The rabbi's par- tiality stands out even more when compared to another contemporary account, The War ofRhodes (La Guerra di Rhodi) by Jacques Fontaine (lacopo Fontano), which relates how after his victory, Siileyman converted the church of San Giovanni 65.

Like Capsali, Fontaine also reports that the sultan took away "the relics of the Saints" and ordered the Grand Masters' tombs to be opened. In contrast to the Jewish chronicler, who por- traits the Muslim ruler as a believer in the "God of Heaven," Fontaine betrays his ignorance of Islam when he claims that the sultan "prayed to Maometh, whom the barbarians believe to have been sent by God in Heaven as the most perfect prophet of all times."69 Capsali no doubt felt confirmed in his pro-Ottoman attitude by the fact that after their victory, the conquerors liberated Jews (and Turks) who had been en- slaved by the Knights on their Mediterranean raids: On this day, all the Turkish slaves on Rhodes were rescued, for the king (i.e., the sultan) had come to an agreement with the Rhodiani not to kill them (on their withdrawal). There were also many enslaved Jews on Rhodes who were saved by the Lord's compassion. Also all the Jews who had apostatized, whether voluntarily or forcibly, on occasion of (their) expulsion from Rhodes returned to their former religion. They reopened the synagogue that the Chris- tians (goyim) had closed, and entering it, gave thanks, praised the Lord and "sang hymns to the Lord the God of Israel" (Judges 5:3).70 In Fontaine's chronicle, there is also mention of the fact that the Ottomans allowed Jews who had been forcibly converted to Christianity to "return to the Law of Moses."7' For Capsali, this provided still more proof that the Ottoman conquest was in the interest of the Jews. He was aware, however, of the possible repercus- sions the fall of Rhodes might have on Venetian Crete. Thus he notes that the Knights of St. John had sent a ship (for which he uses the loanword fusta) to ask the help of Gabriele da Martinengo, who was in Candia executing a Venetian com- mission to strengthen the city's fortifications.72 He also knew that a Venetian fleet had sailed to Candia under the command of the capitagno general Domenico Trevezan to protect Crete against a possible Ottoman attack on the Venetian out- post.73 It may seem surprising that Capsali-who served as the Jewish represen- tative to the Venetian authorities-would not only criticize Martinengo for agree- ing to come to the aid of the Knights of St. John, but even more disturbingly, voice such enthusiasm over the fall of Rhodes. His jubilant tone is even more problem- atic given the fact that some of the Knights had brought the plague with them when they pulled out of Rhodes and took refuge in Candia.74 It is against this gloomy backdrop that Capsali dares to celebrate the fall of Rhodes in rhymed prose, com- 69.

Thus, at the beginning of his chapters on Siileymdn, he writes: He is the tenth king (sultan) of the Turks, and "the tenth one shall be holy to the Lord" (Leviticus 27:32). "In his days Judah shall be delivered and Israel (shall dwell secure" [Jeremiah 23:6]) "and a redeemer shall come to Zion" (Isaiah 59:20).76 Capsali's conviction that the coming of the messiah was imminent was based on the speculations of the Sephardic Kabbalist Abraham ben 'Eli'ezer ha-Levi, who had predicted that the messiah would appear in the Jewish year 5290 (1529/ 30).77 At the conclusion of his chronicle, Capsali even expresses the wish not only that he will be able to witness personally the redemption, but that he will also be in the position to make a written account of it (sic!): "One thing I ask of the Lord, only that do I seek" (Psalm 27:4): As we were allowed to write an account of these events, so we may be allowed to write about all the good (things to come), that the Lord has foretold through his ser- vants, the prophets, for the Lord has spoken good (tidings) for Israel.

As he neither updated his chronicle nor revised the computation of the year of redemption, one may assume the latter. CAPSALI AS A CHRONICLER OF MUSLIM HISTORY Seder 'Eliyahu Zuta does more than simply try to convince its readers that the Ottoman dynasty was raised by God to repatriate the Jews in the mid-sixteenth century. A closer look at the material assembled by Capsali leads to the conclusion that, notwithstanding its theologically motivated view on history (a standpoint 75.

His use of the stylistic de- vices of contemporary Italian writing on the Ottomans shows that his messianic expectations were not the sole reason behind his turn to historiography. Capsali, like Spandugino and other sixteenth-century Italian writers on the Ottomans,79 authored short biographical portraits of the sultans, from the epony- mous founder of the dynasty up to the sultan ruling at the time of his writing. Like other Italian writers of that genre, he enriched these biographical sketches with bat- tle accounts, descriptions of weapons,80 stories about dynastic intrigues and life in the harem, as well as many other details which he thought to be either informative or entertaining. Another indication of Capsali's historiographical ambitions is his decision to open his Ottoman chronicle with an historical overview of the origins of Islam. A close reading of these introductory chapters reveals that in his attempt to write a "serious" chronicle according to contemporary models, Capsali some- times ended up contradicting his own agenda, as exemplified by his chapters on early Islam. Capsali's knowledge of the origins of Islam was based on earlier Jewish and Christian polemical traditions. The Christian background of much of his material is best illustrated by the version of the life of Muhammad that he offers his readers: Many say that Muhammad8 was a Christian (goy), one of the important men or princes of Rome, one of the distinguished cardinals (GRDYNLY) of the Pope (papa). When the Romans saw that he was a courageous and successful war- rior, they sent him out to roam about and wander in the Land of the East in or- der to subject it to their rule (literally: "hands"). And they took an oath and swore that if he succeeded in this, they would make him Pope on his return.82 79. See VJ.

According to Shmuelevitz, Capsali acquired specific information in this field due to his contacts to Spanish-Jewish refugees. However, the impact of se- faradim on the Ottoman development of weapons has been largely overestimated. See S.O.T.

It was for this reason that Muhammad went back to the cities he had conquered in the East and became their ruler. This explanation of the origins of Islam can be traced back to widely circu- lated legends, according to which Muhammad was influenced by Christian teach- ers-legends that went so far as to suggest the fantastical idea that he had started out as an ambitious Catholic cardinal.83 The story first emerges at the end of the thirteenth and beginning of the fourteenth century in the Italian versions of Brunet- to Latini's Tesoro84 and in a collection of legends about Muhammad known under the title Liber Nicolay. 85 In depicting Islam as nothing more than a Christian apostasy, Capsali is echoing a viewpoint characteristic of medieval Western polemics against Islam. His interest in this version, however, was primarily that it questioned the revealed character of Islam. We see this as well in some of the other stories he tells about Muhammad being a charlatan and impostor: Muhammad decided to establish a new religion in the world in order to be seen as important by the uneducated masses ('am ha-'are;) and to abrogate the re- ligions that had been in existence prior to him. He was a very shrewd man who knew to deviously obtain the confidence of people: he was very cunning "and wherever he turned he worsted" (things) [1 Samuel 14:47]). In any event, he took a dove and "guided" it "in knowledge and showed" it "the path of wisdom" (Isaiah 40:14). When Muhammad was sitting in front of the people and the princes, the dove flew (to him) and came to whisper in his ears in the presence of all the people .... And all who saw it were stunned and asked him: "What is that?" And he replied to them: "(Word of him who hears God's speech), who beholds visions from the Almighty" (Numbers 24:4).86 According to this story, Muhammad had trained a dove to make it appear that it was whispering divine words into his ears. The legend questions the revealed character of Islam and is obviously using Christian imagery, where the dove serves as a symbol of the Holy Spirit. 83. This motif would appear to go back to the Christian legend, according to which one of Muhammad's advisors was a monk, who is often called Bahiri (on the Bahird legend, see notes 109, 112, and 113). In one version of this legend, it is said that Muhammad's advisor was a heretical hermit who wanted to become Patriarch of Alexandria but was rejected for his unorthodox views. This motif of the ambitious heretic is later transposed onto Muhammad himself who, in a Latin context, is repre- sented as a cardinal rather than a hermit. 84. According to both versions of the Tesoro, the original name of the cardinal was Pela(s)gio; see the quotes in Alessandro d'Ancona, "La leggenda di Maometto in occidente," in Studi di critica e storia letteraria di Alessandro d'Ancona2, vol. 2 (Bologna, 1912), 165-306, esp, 168-69. 85.

It is in this booklet that Vin- cent claims to have found the following version of the legend of the trained dove: As he (Muhammad) was speaking to the people, a dove that was nearby and that he had surreptitiously trained to this purpose, came and landed on his shoulder and, pecking at the grain that was hidden in (Muhammad's) ears, ap- peared to be prompting with him words of the Law.89 While Capsali's way of weaving his text out of biblical quotes and allusions tends to obscure the meaning, here, the alleged trick finds a kind of rationalistic explanation: the dove is pecking grains of wheat tucked away in Muhammad's ears. Whereas the above-quoted legends are of Christian origin, Capsali also drew from Jewish polemics against Islam. The following paragraph from Seder 'Eliyahu Zuta is based on Jacob of Venice's letter against the apostate Pablo Christiani90 (dating from the thirteenth century): "Muhammad did many things like this; but the miracles he performed were created (by) optical illusions, and he would perform these great wonders by means of deceit and trickery."91 In this way was most of the East deceived by his trickery ... ; and they believed that he was a prophet of God and His mes- senger and that he had been sent by the spirit of God and His power.92 Although it is difficult to pinpoint any one particular source for Capsali's polemical traditions of Christian origin, one can assume that these traditions would 87.

As the rise of Venice had been closely linked to the Crusades,93 and the Fourth Crusade served Venice as a welcome pretext to expand its commercial activities and colonies in the eastern Mediterranean, much of the Crusader tradition was preserved in the Venetian Empire. Even after the fall of the Crusader states in the Levant, Venice continued to provide for the transportation of Christian pilgrims to the Holy Land.94 Thus, much of the Christian polemics against Islam that had originated in partibus transmarinis, polemics such as the libellus de Machometifallacis quoted by Vincent of Beauvais, lived on in the parts of the eastern Mediterranean ruled by Venice. In this milieu, Capsali will have also learned of Christian traditions regard- ing the composition of the Qur'an, as we can see from the following story from the life of Muhammad that Capsali includes in the Seder 'Eliyahu Zuta: A) And he (Muhammad) ordered his friend 'All to write down his laws and instructions (torotav); he would dictate them and 'Ali would write them in a book with ink, while Turzemdn would be "standing at his right to admonish him (lesitno)" (Zechariah 3:1); "thereby daubing with plaster the flimsy wall that he was building" (Ezekiel 13:10). In this way was brought to completion the work produced by Muhammad that they call ilfur'an (i.e., al-Qur'an).95 B) In this book, he (i.e., Muhammad) proclaimed the unity of God in com- plete unity (yihed ha-'el be-takhlit ha-yihud). He collected from here and there all the verses that speak about the unity of God in the twenty-four books (of the Hebrew Bible) and transferred them into it (the Qur'an) in their (own) writing and their (own) language. C) However, this man Muhammad did not know how to write. And so, when he wanted to write something, he would not sign in his own handwriting but would dip his whole hand with its five fingers into ink and would make a print instead of his signature as a sign for the people of Ishmael.96 The tradition according to which Muhammad was illiterate is well known from Islamic sources, especially from the biographical (sfra) and exegetical liter- 93. Whereas during the First Crusade Genoa and Pisa supplied much of the naval power, later it was the Venetians who were the most successful in securing for themselves specific territorial and commercial grants; see L.B. Robert, "Venice and the Crusades," in A History of the Crusades, vol. 5: The Impact of the Crusades on the Near East, ed. Norman P Zacour and Harry W.

In contrast, Christian polemics used this tradition to question the originality of the Qur'an by depicting Muhammad as an ignoramus who plagiarized the Bible under the influence of Jewish or Christian advisers. Similarly, Capsali attributes leading roles in the composition of the Qur'an to two companions of Muhammad called cAli and Turzeman(i), whom he characterizes in the following way: D) He (Muhammad) was joined by two men, who were "clever at doing wrong, but unable to do right" (Jeremiah 4:22); one was called 'All and the other one Turzemdni. 'Al was very clever, and some say that he was (originally) a Jew who had been baptized98 .... 99 Already in the early Judeo-Arabic Qissat ashdb Muhammad ("Story of Muhammad's Friends") preserved in the Cairo Genizah there is mention often wise Jewish men who accepted Islam "to prevent evil from Israel" and composed the Qur'an on Muhammad's behalf; 100 however, this tradition was unknown to the Can- diote rabbi. That Capsali depended on Jewish traditions originating from Christian lands is substantiated by the fact that 'All ('Ibn "Abi T-alib, the cousin and son- in-law of the prophet) is here said to be a baptized Jew. According to this polemical tradition, 'All's (alleged) apostasy is the explanation for his bad influence on Mu- hammad. The second companion, Turzeman(i),'o is probably to be identified with cUthman bin al-'Affan, under whose caliphate (644-56 CE) the official version of the Qur'an was promulgated. This would explain Capsali's use of Zechariah 3:1, according to which Turzeman's job was to supervise 'All's writing, which is com- pared to a "flimsy wall" that needs to be plastered (A). Capsali, however, was not interested in a historical critique of the Qur'dn, but in making a polemical state- ment. As a closer look at the quoted verse reveals, the "admonitioner" mentioned in Zechariah 3:1 "standing at his right to admonish him (lesitno)" is none other but satan. In equating 'Uthmln with Satan, Capsali is declaring the Qur'dn to be Sa- tanic verses; and later in the text, he refers to Muhammad as the "companion of 97.

Capsali also retells a polemical version of the Bahira-legend,105 another tra- dition about the life of Muhammad that goes back to the classical biographical lit- erature (sira) of Islam and that had an extensive afterlife in Christian anti-Islamic polemics: A) In the chronicle (sefer divre ha-yamim) of Muhammad, the deceiver and companion of Ashmadai,'06 it is written, that Abfi Bakr and Hayya were among the supporters of Muhammad's covenant and religion and among those who observed his commandments and his teaching (torah). B) Abti Bakr was of Jewish origin, the son of the exilarch (rosh ha-golah). When he saw that Muhammad was rising higher and higher (in the ranks) he began to fear that (Muhammad) might come to hate him and remove him from his (own) high rank and "drag the dignity" of his office "in the dust" (Psalm 89:40). And so he took off his clean clothes and put on dirty ones, adopted the "conduct of sinful men" (Numbers 32:14), and joined Muhammad and his friends, going wherever (Muhammad) went and listening to his speeches. C) This man Hayya who was a Christian (nozri) became Muhammad's advi- sor and bosom companion, joining him in his bedroom and on his bed. Be- cause of this, Muhammad's friends became envious of him (... ) and plotted to slay him with the sword.107 The story goes on to relate how Muhammad's Christian friend arranges a banquet in the course of which everyone falls asleep except Abii Bakr, who takes 102.

The next morning, Muhammad wakes from a drunken sleep to discover that his friend has been murdered, and, seeing the blood on his own sword, believes that he himself was the one who killed him. Heartbro- ken, he then issues a decree prohibiting the drinking of alcohol. While it is correct that Abdi Bakr was among the first supporters of Muham- mad, nowhere in the Muslim tradition is he described as having been the son of an exilarch (rosh ha-golah, i.e., the representative of the Jews in Babylonia).8os The story that 'All and Abil Bakr were Jews who had converted to Islam, however, is to be found in the Judeo-Arabic tradition originating from the Lands of Islam'09 although, again, Capsali could not have been aware of this. Although he refers to a "chronicle (sefer divre ha-yamim) of Muhammad," the source of his banquet sto- ry is the polemical letter by Jacob of Venice mentioned above." 0 It is from this source as well that he took the name Hayya; ,' however, there is no question that this figure is to be identified with Bahira, about whom there are many legends in both Islamic and Christian sources. According to Muslim tradition, Bahira was a Christian monk who had recognized Mulhammad's future mission when the prophet was still a youth." 2 Whereas in Islamic tradition Bahird serves as a Chris- tian witness to the authenticity of Muhammad's prophethood, in Christian polem- ical literature he is a Christian heretic who exerts considerable influence on Muhammad and the composition of the Qur'dn." 13 The story that connects the Islamic prohibition of alcohol to the murder of Bahird can be traced back to the Crusader states of the Levant, from which it was brought to the West in the thirteenth century by William of Tripoli. 14 It would therefore have been familiar to Jacob of Venice, whose polemical letter, as we have 108.

Here again we get an idea how Outremer traditions be- came known to the author of Seder 'Eliyahu Zuta. Although (so far) it has not been possible to identify a specific non-Jewish source used by Capsali, the legends he included into his account on the origins of Islam point at Crusader traditions that were still accessible in the Venetian Empire of the sixteenth century. His depiction of Ottoman history, which to some extent resembles Spandugino's account, has to be understood in the context of the con- temporary Venetian-Ottoman rivalry. However, it is still an open question whether Capsali drew on written sources for his descriptions of the dynastic and military history of the Ottomans, given that he himself, like a good classical historian,115 firmly believed that oral sources constituted the most reliable material of histori- ography: Amongst the tribes of Israel, I firmly announced that my tongue will tell the truth: In all the stories I will tell, I will not take the path of liars. Behold, I have received the stories (sippurim) about the kings of Turkey from the mouth of venerable (zekenim) and knowledgeable Turks.'16 Like Spandugino, who claimed to have entered into conversation with "two gentlemen who were close to Bayazid II,5'117 Capsali, however, does not disclose the names of his informants, the "venerable and knowledgeable Turks"-a fact that may cause the modern reader to question his honesty."18 Yet, in the case of his ac- count of the Ottoman conquest of Egypt, Capsali does mention a specific eyewit- ness: For the stories of Egypt (sippure Mizrayim), I relied on the testimony of many beloved and honorable (people) who were there at that time, especially on the trustworthy and most courageous Rabbi Yizhaq al-Hakim who was there dur- ing the period of the war, from its inception until the end .... I wrote with ink in a book what he related to me ....119 Capsali also tells us that he learned about the "war of Constantinople" from his father's uncle, Moses Capsali.120 Born in Candia about 1410, Moses Capsali must have settled in Constantinople sometime around 1445, after which he served 115. According to Bonfil ("Jewish Attitudes," 19-20, and 30), Capsali made use of stories con- tained in written sources but purposefully attributed them to oral eyewitnesses, especially Jews, in or- der to "Judaize" his subject matter. However, Bonfil makes no suggestion which sources Capsali might have used. For a detailed discussion of this, see Jacobs, Islamische Geschichte, 72-80. 116. Prologue to SEZ, 1:11. 117.

SEZ, 1:11 n. 114), assumes that he was a physician (as suggested by his Arabic surname, al-Hakim) or merchant, who accompanied the sultan throughout his campaign through Syria, Palestine, and Egypt. Judging from Capsali's words, however, it seems more likely that, because of the war, he had to remain the whole time in Egypt. 120.

Given the generational gap, however, Elijah Capsali could only have learned about his great-uncle's life from his father, Elkanah. Family pride, more- over, led him to exaggerate Moses Capsali's standing at the Ottoman court, a fact that puts into questions the reliability of the relevant sections.121 In any case, Cap- sali's repeated reference to Doges and other Venetian dignitaries as well as his use of Italian loanwords122 would indicate that he probably drew on Venetian knowl- edge of Ottoman affairs. This is not surprising, given that Crete was one of the main hubs of Venetian-Ottoman intercourse. In Candia and other major centers of the eastern Mediterranean, the Mar- itime Republic maintained a network of permanent representatives (baili) and con- suls, all of whom reported back to and kept in constant touch with the government of the Serenissima.123 Capsali explicitly mentions the bailo Antonio Giustiniani, who in 1513 had traveled to Istanbul to renew Venetian-Ottoman agreements after Selim I's accession (1512). On his way back, Giustiniani stopped over in Candia where Capsali had the chance to listen to the bailo's report.'24 Capsali also refers to the Venetian emissary Marco Minio, who passed through Candia on his way to Constantinople where, after the fall of Belgrad (1521), he was sent to renew the peace agreement between the Ottomans and Venice.'25 Capsali's acquaintance with these diplomats can be explained by his position as condestabulo, which made it necessary for him to be in close contact with the Venetian authorities. Given that there are very few historical dates in Seder 'Eliyahu Zuta-the first date mentioned is that of the beginning of the siege of Constantinople'26-it is unlikely that he had access to any comprehensive account of Ottoman history. He may have read a short commentario on the origin of the Turks'27 (but if so, he omitted certain dates and other details in his own account) or a few of the battle descriptions (avvisi) that circulated widely in the form of leaflets. It seems much 121. On the basis of Seder 'Eliyahu Zuta, previous scholarship assumed that Moses Capsali was the first "Chief Rabbi" of the Ottoman Empire, a claim that can no longer be supported; see Joseph (R.) Hacker, "The Chief Rabbinate in the Ottoman Empire in the 15th and 16th Centuries" (Hebrew), Zion 49 (1984): 225-63; on Capsali's portrait of his great-uncle, see also Jacobs, Islamische Geschichte, 138, 156-57, 163-64. 122.

CONCLUSIONS As the previous discussion has shown, Capsali is a figure not easily catego- rized. Serving as a rabbi on the island of Crete, which was then a Venetian outpost in the eastern Mediterranean, he was exposed to multiple influences. By upbring- ing, he was both multilingual (fluent in Greek, Italian, and Hebrew at least) and multicultural (his family was of Romaniote origin, he studied at a famous Ashke- nazic yeshivah in Padua, and he corresponded with Sephardic rabbis in Egyptl'28). Perhaps the most puzzling aspect of his historical work is the fact that although Crete (as most of the Venetian overseas territories) lay within the area of Ottoman expansion, Capsali glorified the Ottoman conquests-an even bolder partisanship when keeping in mind that he was also serving as the representative of the Cretan Jews to the Venetian authorities. A closer look at Capsali's chronicle reveals that his work is full of contradictions and ambiguities. On the one hand, he was deeply rooted in the cultural and social world of the Venetian Empire; on the other, he wrote eulogies on the Ottomans, Venice's primary Mediterranean rival. This partisanship was certainly not without any risk given that Capsali com- posed his work after the fall of Rhodes (1522), when an Ottoman attack on Crete seemed to be imminent.129 Whereas Capsali had expressed his admiration for Venice in an earlier chronicle he had written, his later (intellectual) siding with the enemy may reflect the lack of integration Jews experienced under a government that subjected them to residential segregation and other restrictions.130 The de- mographic pressure created in the Jewish segregated area during the plague of 1523 had been disastrous, a fact that may well have contributed to Capsali's readi- ness to place all his hopes in the rival of the Maritime Republic. Despite his idealization of the sultans, however, Capsali did not hesitate to adopt polemical traditions about the rise of Islam that are of Christian origin and can be traced back to the Crusader states of the Levant. To some extent, this can be explained by his historiographical ambition: like certain Christian writers of his time, Capsali felt that it was necessary to introduce his chronicle of Ottoman his- tory with an account of the origins of Islam. This made even more sense to him 128. See Benayahu, Capsali, 88 n. 10; Haim H.

When the Ottoman fleet under Khayr al-Din Barbarossa threatened Candia in 1538, the Christian population accused the Jews of hiding Turks and the mob looted the Jewish quarter; see Joshua Starr, "Jewish Life in Crete under the Rule of Venice," Proceedings of the American Academy ofJewish Research 12 (1942): 59-114, esp. 111-12. 130.

The highly polemical tone of Capsali's chapters on early Islam is partly to be explained by the material he used. Moreover, a sixteenth-century rabbi could not be expected to take a sympathetic approach to Muhammad's prophetic claim. Last but not least, the Jewish chronicler did not have to adopt a positive attitude towards Islam-or to "turn Turk" as Christian polemicists would have put it- since his primary aim was to show that the Ottomans were being used by God to defeat Christendom. As we have seen, Capsali determined, on the basis of Isaiah 10:5-11, that although Assyria had been chosen as God's "rod of anger," there was nothing positive to say about Assyria's religion. In the same way, he interpreted the visions of Daniel as prophetic proof that the Ottomans were in fact the "fourth" empire, whose sole purpose was to overthrow the rule of Christianity and to set the stage for the return of the Jewish exiles to their land. Ambiguity marks not only Capsali's attitude towards Islam, but his historio- graphical approach as well. In choosing to write about the history of the Ottomans, he was selecting one of the most fashionable topics of sixteenth-century Italian his- toriography, a fact that in itself reflects the author's awareness of contemporary trends. In addition, his treatment of primarily non-Jewish history can be said to have opened up new horizons in Jewish literature. However, neither Capsali's views on history nor his writing style had very much in common with contemporary hu- manist historiography. Although he occasionally makes use of contemporary rhetor- ical devices, in most of his text, he models himself after medieval chronicles, which ultimately go back to biblical and rabbinic literary patterns. In his detailed accounts of the Ottoman conquests, he combines a keen interest in contemporary events with his rabbinic training in reading scriptures as a key to the understanding of history. However, it would be wrong to conclude that Capsali was unusual in his con- tinued reliance on the stylistic devices of religiously founded historiography. In fact, there were quite a few Christian chronicles composed in cinquecento-Italy that con- tinued in form and concept the medieval tradition.'31 When it came to descriptions of the Turks or Islam, there was a general tendency to reappropriate cliches going back to the time of the Crusades, and causal explanations for momentous events such as the fall of Constantinople quite frequently reverted to God's wrath. Like many of his Christian contemporaries, Capsali was obliged to a religion- defined worldview; yet, in expanding the historical horizon to include other peo- ples and cultures he followed an impulse characteristic of early modem times. Cap- sali's ambivalent attitude towards Islam-oscillating between polemics against the "false" prophet Muhammad and panegyrics to the Ottoman sultans-mirrors the ambiguous situation of a Jewish author living at an eastern outpost of the Christian world and facing the Muslim world on the other shore.
