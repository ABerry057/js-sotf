Arbeiten zur Geschichte des Antiken Judentums und des Urchristentums. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1998. xxx, 183 pp. Late-antique Israel enjoyed astonishing literary creativity and output in the form of the piyyut, which offered a poetic alternative to the standard liturgical lan- guage. The treasures from the Genizah have enriched our knowledge of the pay- tanim of this period, and important collections of the works of Yosi ben Yosi, Yan- nai, Shimon bar Megas, and Kallir have been compiled in recent years. But alongside these well-known paytanim were others, often anonymous but sometimes not, thanks to the use of name acrostics, a characteristic style of the piyyut. Nu- merous compositions identify a paytan whose name was Yehudah, and now his oeu- vre has been ably compiled by van Bekkum. Yehudah's compositions are of the kedushta genre, a series of piyyutim in- tricately related through the use of interconnecting alphabetical acrostics and in- terconnecting references to the Torah-reading selection for which the kedushta was composed. The first two piyyutim in each kedushta serve respectively as the first and second berakhot of the Amidah, and the following ones lead to the climax of the third berakhah, the Kedushah, which extols God's holy nature. Although schol- ars have been aware of Yehudah's works since Menahem Zulay's Zur Liturgie des babylonischen Juden (1933), little about the paytan himself could be said with cer- tainty, largely due to the fragmentary nature of what remains from his works. Now that van Bekkum has diligently gathered and organized all of the Genizah frag- ments that preserve Yehudah's compositions, he has made it possible, at the very least, for the reader to observe first-hand that Yehudah wrote with reference to a triennial Torah-reading cycle, confirming recent speculation about his provenance and context. His relationship to Yannai and Shimon bar Megas also becomes read- ily apparent, and this volume can only facilitate further pursuit of questions of in- fluence. Best of all, one can now read Yehudah on his own terms, appreciating not only his allegiance to classical techniques and forms, but also his individual styl- istic characteristics. Van Bekkum reviews both of these in his introduction, a se- ries of short chapters marked by clarity and brevity. This reader was especially pleased to find in the introduction an excellent explanation of the linguistic pecu- liarities of piyyutic language, again brief but remarkably clear. Students of piyyut will benefit greatly from this introductory material, which, both despite and be- cause of its brevity, offers the clearest introduction to piyyut available in English. The piyyutim themselves are accompanied by explanatory notes that this 367</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review reader found too sparse. Often the full midrashic allusion of a passage is left un- explained, and particularly difficult phrases are occasionally unannotated. But quibbles aside, the door to Yehudah's work has been opened, and the eager student of piyyut can now work with ease among Yehudah's compositions. We still do not know much about Yehudah, but we now have his beautiful, moralizing compositions published alongside those of his coevals. Such a publi- cation contributes immeasurably to our understanding and appreciation of classi- cal piyyut. Van Bekkum is to be commended for such fine work.
