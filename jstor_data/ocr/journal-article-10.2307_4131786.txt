Albany: SUNY Press, 2000. x, 277 pp. The academic study of medieval Jewish philosophy began in the nineteenth century with a comparisons of classical Jewish texts (e.g., Saadia Gaon's Beliefs 137</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews and Opinion, Judah Halevi's Kuzari; Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed; Ger- sonides' Wars of the Lord) with classical Islamic texts (especially those of the Aris- totelians al-Farabi, Avicenna, and Averroes; and the anti-Aristotelian al-Ghazali). The possibility that Jewish thinkers took their inspiration from, or should be seen in the context of, Islamic thinkers (such a Shi 'ites or sufis) and Christian philoso- phers (especially scholastics vis-a-vis late medieval Jewish thought) was rarely en- tertained, partially because of lack of availability of texts and partially because of preconceived notions. The last few decades have seen a reversal of this trend: as the chances fade of finding more parallels in the well researched Aristotelian texts, more attention has been paid to alternate contexts of Jewish philosophy. This ex- cellent book, a much revised and updated Harvard University dissertation (1995), is a very welcome addition to this growing tendency. Diana Lobel is not interested solely in the search for parallels between Ju- dah Halevi's Kuzari and Sufi (and other) texts. Rather, her study is intended to show the ongoing dialogue in the Kuzari between Halevi's Jewish spirituality and that of his Islamic contemporaries, both the philosopher (who is mentioned ex- plicitly in the text) and the mystic (whose presence is solely implicit). Lobel ac- complishes this by concentrating on key Arabic terms, many of them used both by the Aristotelians and the Sufis, which were undoubtedly well known to Halevi's Arabic speaking Jewish audience. Assuming that the poet Halevi's choice of lan- guage was not arbitrary, Lobel demonstrates how Halevi repeated central terms in differing contexts in order to employ them in an ongoing, but subtle, debate with Sufism, which parallels his unambiguous criticism of philosophy, Islam and Chris- tianity (parts of which are also analyzed here). Lobel's study, which is not solely philological but also literary, placing the terminological parallels inside a larger context (cf. p. 10), is particularly welcome since it shows the indispensability of using the original text of the Kuzari. No current Hebrew (or English) translations of the Kuzari consistently render the underlying Arabic terms, and, since termino- logical exactitude is so important for understanding Halevi's thought, these trans- lations are quite misleading to readers who rely solely upon them. The terms at the center of Lobel's study are those concerning relationship (connection or union); human striving; perception; prophecy; and intimacy, long- ing, and love. Lobel ably demonstrates that all of these topics were of concern to Halevi's Islamic sources, especially the Sufi ones, and that a full understanding of Halevi's philosophy requires comparison with Islamic precedents. Also of inter- est is Lobel's demonstration that Halevi often gives the familiar terms new nuances as part of his ongoing dialogue with competing Islamic models. One example of Lobel's exposition of Halevi's methodology will have to suffice: Although one does not need the original Arabic to know that the experi- ential truth of prophecy is a central theme of the Kuzari, by analyzing the Arabic terminology, Lobel explicates both the experiential and prophetic aspects of Hale- vi's thought. Halevi's term for the collective experienced of Israel at Sinai is mushihada, or witnessing, a common Sufi term for religious experience. For the Sufi, however, witnessing is a result of much psychic preparation and is an indi- vidual, not a group, phenomenon. By constantly using the term mushahada and many of its cognates, Halevi emphasized that the collective Sinaitic experience, 138</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews for which Israel did not need special preparation, is a much more reliable source of truth than Sufi mysticism (or philosophy, which assumed that prophecy needs intellectual preparation). Furthermore, Halevi's contrast of Israel's mushdhada with the philosopher's use of logical deduction (qiyds) is intended to emphasize that unmediated witnessing can be trusted more than logic. In terms of prophecy itself, Lobel demonstrates how Halevi is careful to distinguish between different levels of prophetic experience by his use of distinct Arabic terms. Thus, the theopha- ny at Mt. Sinai was perceived by all Israelites as an act of wahy (real prophecy), and not ilhdm (inspiration) or ta'yid (divine assistance). By focusing on the re- peated use of various Arabic terms in the Kuzari, Lobel convincingly argues that Ha- levi was responding to specific Islamic views that were current in twelfth-century Spain. If one has any methodological bone to pick with the author it will concern the question of Halevi's consistency. Previous readers have pointed out possible contradictions between different passages in the Kuzari and have offered varied ex- planations of this phenomenon, such as developments in Halevi's thought through the years of the Kuzari 's composition; the dialectical nature of the work, or a gen- eral lack of consistency. By dealing with the Kuzari as a seamless whole, even when a war of possible contradictions ("Ha-Levi is thus far from systemically con- sistent" [p.47]), Lobel risks reading more into the terminology than there actually is. If Halevi was not always concerned with reconciling different passages in the Kuzari for whatever reason, how can one be sure that he used his Arabic termi- nology consistently? Thus, while the term qiyds (logical analogy) generally has negative connotations, this is not always the case. Similarly, sometimes the author uses qiyds to mean rational proof; in other passages the term seems to be istidldl (logical demonstration; see, e.g., pp. 73-74, 81-82). Is this terminological change purposeful, or does it perhaps have another reason, such as the different stages of composition of the Kuzari? As noted, while Lobel's terminological exegeses are generally convincing, at least the possibility of inconsistency should be taken into account. One can also quibble concerning some of Lobel's interpretations. She is un- derstandably uncomfortable with what is anachronistically referred to as Halevi's racism (notice her paraphrase: "Every Israelite of pure heart" [p. 20], when the original refers to native-born [or pure, sarih] Israelites, to the exclusion of con- verts; but cf. p. 194, n. 61). Further, Lobel's distinction between nature and nur- ture is a valuable one, and her non-racist explanation of Kuzari 1:27 (pp. 35-37, and notes) is convincing. Nevertheless, her understanding of safiva (chosen, elect) as non-genetic because of the Shi'ite use of the term, and her statement that "Ha- Levi appears to deliberately leave the precise nature of Israel's status as safwa ambiguous" (p. 38), ignore the many statements in the Kuzari about the relatively inferior status of the proselyte and the intrinsic nature of native-born Jewish su- periority. Even if Halevi's sources did not use safiva in a biological/genetic man- ner, this is no proof that Halevi's understanding was similar. After all, the central focus of Lobel's book is Halevi's appropriation of pre-existing Arabic "vocabu- lary of religious experience" by "creatively adapting [it] to the Jewish experience" (p. 159)! 139</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews Despite these caveats, there is no doubt that Lobel's study is the most im- portant book on Judah Halevi's philosophy currently available and deserves both a wide audience and close attention. It is indispensable for all future discussions of the Islamic context of medieval Jewish philosophy in general and of Judah Halevi's thought in particular. Daniel J.
