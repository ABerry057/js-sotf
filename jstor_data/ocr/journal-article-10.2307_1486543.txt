Joel Shatzky and Michael Taub's stimulating sourcebook suggests an answer in the case of sixty-three contemporary writers, from Walter Abish to Herman Wouk. Shatzky and Taub limit their selections chiefly to writers whose major works appeared after the Second World War. In so doing, this volume comple- ments such earlier reference works as Lewis Fried's Handbook ofAmerican- Jewish Literature, Hana Wirth-Nescher's What Is Jewish Literature?, and Dan Walden's Dictionary of Literary Biography volume Twentieth-Century American-Jewish Fiction Writers. We have come a long way from Lionel Trilling's assessment in the 1940s that no writer in English has added to his stature by "realizing his Jewishness" or Alfred Kazin's similarly dated inability to find much to admire in American Jewish culture or among Jewish writers in America generally. For Saul Bellow, as Sanford Marovitz reminds us in a tightly compact though comprehensive introduction, Jewish literature goes back to the Scrip- tures, which emphasize the worth of the individual, while for writers such as Cynthia Ozick it is marked by a more communal voice. Marovitz argues that Jewish-American fiction reached its peak in the two and a half decades following the war and has remained at that high level ever since. Part of this achievement Marovitz attributes to the emergence of Jewish-American women, nineteen of whom are treated in essays in this volume. The entries are structured into sections on biography, major works and themes, and critical reception, and contain useful bibliographies of works both by and about the authors. Particularly incisive are the essays in which Sanford Pinsker examines Bernard Malamud's uneasiness about being labeled as an American Jewish writer, Mark Shechner looks at the fantastic element of "riff artist" Steve Stem, and Suzanne Klingenstein analyzes the conflict of art and Jewish law in the work of Cynthia Ozick. The historical development of Jewish themes follows the struggle of an immigrant population to assimilate, the dislocation that accompanied increasing secularization and acculturation (with a sense of freedom and opportunity and a corresponding sense of loss), the emergence of the State of Israel (which altered the conventional opposition of the physical world and the world of ideas), the difficulty of coming to terms with the Shoah, and the recent recovery of a Jewish heritage. Within these developments is a continuing concern for suffering and redemption and for the moral questions that define what we think it means to</page><page sequence="3">180 BOOK REVIEWS be human. A more parochial issue raised in these essays is the relation between an author's life and work. Carolyn Sofia, for example, finds that Daphne Merkin's sensitivity to gender is embedded in her early experience, Myrna Goldenberg identifies the oral quality in Faye Moskowitz's autobiographical writing, while Thomas Frank notes the social purpose that informs Grace Paley's work in her acknowledgment that her language and subject matter come from the neighbors, the street, and her family. Yet it is not always easy to find a uniform principle of inclusion for this volume. Though devoted to Jewish-American novelists, its essays include Canadian humorist Mordecai Richler as well as Norman Mailer and Joseph Heller, whose writings, at times, seem deliberately to avoid any connection to Jewish themes. Jerome Charyn, Leslie Fiedler, J. D. Salinger, Irwin Shaw, and Michael Chabon are just some of those left out, while the selections on Mark Helprin and Wallace Markfield by Shatzky and Taub do little more than list the authors' publications. The necessarily compact nature of these entries limits their use as a scholarly resource. If not for the high cost, this readable survey might find a wider audience in the rapidly expanding cultural phenomenon of book clubs, whose numbers are undoubtedly swelled by Jews but hardly confined to them.
