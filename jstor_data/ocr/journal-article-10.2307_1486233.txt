ROSKIES What could be more obvious for a writer who called himself How-Do- You-Do than to place folklore and folk-speech at the center of his work? After all, it was his childhood friend Shmulik who had inducted him into the world of storytelling; ever since then, the celebrated author could have mined the treasures of Jewish myth and legend as his natural legacy. But Shmulik's formative role in From the Fair was as much a fiction as the name Sholem Aleichem itself, which masked the true beginnings of a typical Russian-Jewish maskil named Rabinovitsh.' Everything in the program of the Haskalah, as in Sholem Rabinovitsh's early career, militated against the discovery of folklore: the overwhelming antipathy of the Jewish Enlighten- ment to fantasy, superstition, and folk custom;2 Rabinovitsh's concern for fostering a highbrow literary culture in Yiddish based on the realistic por- 1.

ROSKIES trayal of poverty, on social satire and stylistic discipline;3 and, perhaps most importantly, the young writer's adulation for the arch-maskil Abramovitsh- Mendele, who embodied this new critical standard.4 When, along with other of his contemporaries, Sholem Aleichem finally overcame these formidable obstacles and negotiated his way back to the folk, readers were so taken by his reinvention of Jewish folklore that they mistook it for the real thing. In the heyday of maskilic rationalism, the fledgling group of secular East European Jewish writers had striven for a negotiated settlement with the sources of fantasy. Miracles in the Bible, especially such epoch-making events as the Splitting of the Sea of Reeds, were still to be credited, but the purveyors of contemporary miracle tales-the Hasidim-were to be laughed off the stage of history.5 The dichotomy in Abraham Mapu's fiction between biblical romance (Ahavat Zion, 1853) and social satire ('Ayyit Zavu'a, 1857) epitomized this divide-and-conquer strategy. According to Abramovitsh, writing in 1860, fantasy was legitimate in works of fiction so long as it was governed by logic, morality, and the laws of grammar.6 In general, fantasy was best relegated to dreams or prophetic visions, and even then, was best understood in an allegorical vein. By the time the young Sholem Aleichem entered the literary scene, a new period of Jewish self-determination had begun, ushered in by Leo Pinsker's Auto-Emancipation (1882). Answering Pinsker's call, intellectuals were now expected to serve the "folk" by depicting its socioeconomic life in a critical, realistic manner.7 The main measure of change, however, was in the treat- ment of the past; a sense of a common past, the argument went, would 3.

History, heretofore seen as the realm of mad- ness (most notably, in Abramovitsh's Di klyatshe / Susati, 1873), was now rehabilitated as a source of national pride. Midrash, which the maskilim had viewed as the repository of canonized falsehood, was selectively reclaimed as a legitimate source of postbiblical fantasy. Dreams and nightly visions pro- liferated, especially in Hebrew narrative poetry. Still, history, midrash, and hallucination were hardly the stuff of every- day life. The problem for Sholem Aleichem, as for all the other lapsed positivists, was finding a believable this-worldly setting for fantasy. The shtetl, or East European Jewish market town, while ideally situated to pro- vide the requisite social panorama, had long since been discredited among the maskilim as a hotbed of superstition and exaggerated response.8 True son of the Haskalah, and a loyal disciple of Abramovitsh, Sholem Aleichem, too, wrote comic expos6s of shtetl foibles in the requisite satiric style-a pastiche of biblical Hebrew.9 To be sure, if one went back far enough in the East European Jewish past, one could find a marvelous tale or two. Why, even Ayzik-Meyer Dik, that died-in-the-wool Litvak, had allowed for legendary exploits in the Vilna and Poland of old.'0 Everything was possible before the partitions of Poland. In the dreary, industrialized present, however, with Jews flocking en masse to the big cities, or farther still, where it was every man and woman for themselves-from this rocky terrain no marvelous waters could flow. In 1897, the inchoate yearnings of the 1880s coalesced into the two great political movements of Jewish eastern Europe-Zionism and the Bund. This politization process freed the creative writers-as opposed to the journalists and ideologues-to steer an independent course, to look inward and to more fully explore the internal resources of their culture. The first point on the unexplored map of Jewish culture was the world of fantasy that was 8.

ROSKIES situated in the heder, in the house of study bein minhzah le-ma'ariv, in the hasidic shtibl, or closer still-in the realm of the human conscious. So close, and yet, so far. it was easier, in fact, for this generation of moderns to drain swamps in Palestine or to organize tallith weavers into a labor union than to turn folklore and fantasy into the substance of their art. No wonder, then, that two writers who successfully remade themselves into modern Jewish storytellers became canonical figures on the strength of their stylized fic- tions. As different as Zionism was from the Bund, that is how differently Peretz and Sholem Aleichem negotiated the perilous terrain of Jewish fantasy. Peretz, who quickly emerged as a chief exponent of Jewish neoromanti- cism, used every trick in the book to bracket the experience and expression of the folk: in particular, through his choice of setting and speakers, and through a strict separation between fact and fancy. As the maskilim had done before him, Peretz continued to relegate folklore and fantasy to the legendary past. "There once dwelt in Safed a Jew of great wealth and good fortune," began his most perfect romance, Mesires-nefesh ("Devotion With- out End"), "who traded in jewels, diamonds, and other precious stones. He was truly a man of great wealth, not like the upstarts of our day."''" To such marvelous settings as Safed and Prague, the old stand-bys of the magical itinerary, Peretz now added the shtetl-a prelapsarian shtetl of his own making, where every water carrier was a hidden saint and every traveling magician could be Elijah in disguise. Just as the shtetl was close enough to be believable and far enough to allow free rein to fantasy, so the speakers in these stories had to combine faith and a certain level of sophistication. For if Peretz didn't believe in the miracle himself, he had to keep inventing narrators who did. In his celebrat- ed hasidic monologues, the miracle existed only in the eyes of the beholder. To narrate the romances and folktales, Peretz created a slightly bookish, slightly playful voice, modulating between them as the occasion required. Finally, by an elaborate use of supernatural props, Peretz preserved the distinction between illusion and reality. Through a bureaucratic heaven where even the Devil was subject to protocol, Peretz made it perfectly clear that his real subject was the world of human strivings and human failings.'2 11.

Throughout his career, he stuck to observable reality and drew, wherever possible, on firsthand experience. Fortunately, during the period of his debut, a simple technique was introduced into Hebrew literature that allowed for a recreated-but safely distanced-world of fantasy. All one needed was to conjure up the experience of a child, for whom, presumably, marvelous things were an everyday occurrence.'3 For Sholem Aleichem, the experiment proved that recreating the myth from a child's point of view was as difficult as from a Hasid's. Dos meserl ("The Penknife," subtitled "A Foolish But a Sad Story from My Childhood") was Sholem Aleichem's first little masterpiece.14 It tells the story of a Jewish boy from a "good home" who has a passion for penknives that ultimately leads him to an act of theft. First written in 1886, the story suffered from two conflicting agenda: an expos6 of the heder and its debili- tating effect on the body and soul of Jewish boys, and a universal tale of ini- tiation. To achieve the first, Sholem Aleichem addressed his adult male readers (mayne lezer, mayne brider) in a modern European diction, complete with Russian proverbs. At the same time, through dramatic vignettes, he tried to vivify the child's world from within. The story turns mythic when, on a midsummer's night, the moon intrudes upon the hero as he fondles his stolen treasure. Suddenly, images of hellfire crowd his mind, destroying the idyllic mood. Then, the next day in heder he has to witness a poverty- stricken boy being brought to trial for stealing money from a charity-box. This is enough to unhinge our hero completely and he falls into a delirium. Upon awakening, the hero's mother tells him what actually happened. vi azoy me hot mikh oyfgehoybn fun der erd kimat a toytn; vi azoy ikh bin gelegn tsvey vokhn keseyder in a helish fayer un hob nor gekvaket, vi a zhabe, un epes keseyder geredt fun shmits un fun meserlekh ... me hot shoyn ge- rekhnt, az ikh bin shoyn kholile geshtorbn... un nokh dem, plutsem, hob ikh a nis gegebn zibn mol, mamesh fun toyt lebedik gevorn... sipporet ha-'ivrit 1880-1970, vol. 1 (Israel, 1977), pp. 140-160; David G.

ROSKIES how they picked me up from the floor half-dead; how I lay in bed for two weeks on end croaking like a frog, and kept on babbling something about lashes and penknives ... people thought that I was already dead, God forbid ... and then, suddenly, I sneezed seven times, and came to, as if arisen from the dead... (p. 16) Through the seven-fold sneeze, the hero's fate is linked to that of the Shunammite woman's only son whom Elisha miraculously resusitates in 2 Kings 4. Though there is no Man of God to effect the birth and rebirth of the son, the courageous and God-fearing Shunammite woman is implicitly figured in the hero's mother. Thus, Sholem Aleichem superimposed two complementary layers of myth-one emanating from the child, the other from the adult (the hero's mother and the adult male reader). It is one thing for a child to translate his naive conception of reward and punishment into mythic terms, but quite another when life itself replays one of the most poig- nant scenes in the Bible. The child's myth of good and evil is reinforced by the adult myth of death and resurrection. Were it not for the young Sholem Aleichem's overriding need to be use- ful, to press for educational reform, to tell rather than to show, he might have been able to exploit this myth of death and resurrection-so subtly played out on a realistic plane-by allowing for some catharsis, some recon- ciliation between the son and the adult world. (That catharsis is precisely what resolves the second version of the story, written in 1901-3, for chil- dren.) In the 1880s, the time had not yet come for rehabilitating the experi- ence of childhood for its own sake or for properly integrating the mythic component into one's fictional world. Nevertheless, with this modest begin- ning Sholem Aleichem had already laid the groundwork for a particular use of myth. Myth, for Sholem Aleichem, came to mean two different but comple- mentary things. (1)It was the belief system of the Jews, the stories they actually lived by, that structured their perceptions of reality. As he later developed it, that myth was accessible to all Jews, inasmuch as every Jew had once been a child, celebrated some festival or other in one way or another, and knew how to talk. Myth was the source of hope and of tran- scendence. (2) Myth was also the deep structure of Jewish experience, a fixed number of archetypal plots that were embedded not in one's individual psychology but in Jewish history itself. Myth was fate and it was in- escapable.</page><page sequence="7">SHOLEM ALEICHEM 33 When, to return to our exercise in Jewish literary history, the rediscovery of myth and fantasy in the last decade of the nineteenth century irrevocably changed the form and content of Jewish writing in Eastern Europe, Sholem Aleichem had already crossed the threshold on his own terms. The most innovative writers-Peretz and Berdichewsky in prose, Bialik and Tcherni- chowsky in poetry-began to seek the sources of renewal not horizontally, in the latest developments in European culture, but vertically, in the medie- val, ancient, and folk strata of Jewish and (in Tchernichowsky's case) pagan culture.'" Though Sholem Aleichem, too, embarked on a period of internal renewal, the Bible and midrashim, the medieval romance, the stories of Nahman of Bratslav and of Shivihei ha-Besht exerted no special attraction for him. He did not cultivate them as the buds of Jewish efflorescence.'6 What captured his imagination instead were the contemporary, often secu- lar, forms of Jewish folk expression: how young lovers in the shtetl re- enacted the Song of Songs; how the Jewish holidays brought momentary relief to an otherwise unbearable existence; how the folksong idiom was updated to comment on current affairs. At a time when Jewish students at the Moscow Conservatory went slum- ming in the small towns to collect authentic Jewish folksongs,'7 Sholem Aleichem was doing the lecture circuit with his own local find-a lawyer and amateur songwriter from Kiev, Mark Warshawski.'8 Sholem Aleichem maintained that these newly composed songs, often set to well-known Slavic melodies or dance tunes, could legitimately be called Yiddish folksongs. "Folksongs," he instructed Joel Engel, the pioneer of Jewish ethnomusico- logy in Eastern Europe, were "all songs written in the simple Jewish folk language [proster yidisherfolksshprakhe] . . . that are put out for the sake of the folk."'9 As proof that the function of a cultural artifact was more impor- 15.

ROSKIES tant than its origins, Sholem Aleichem pointed to his own song on the mass immigration to America, Shlofmayn kind ("Sleep, My Child"). Published in 1892, it was already incorporated as a traditional lullaby in the Ginsburg- Marek collection of 1901.20 While Sholem Aleichem certainly did not dis- parage the work of retrieving and preserving the Yiddish folk heritage,2' his own concern was for the varied manifestations of Jewish popular culture- those hybrid forms that were being adapted by and for the folk in the here- and-now of everyday life. This dynamic approach to the materials of the folk turned Sholem Aleichem's oeuvre into the source of a new popular cul- ture. Some 200,000 copies of his stories were to circulate in chapbook form; on the eve of World War I, they would be available on newsstands from Warsaw to New York.22 The neoromantic writers in Yiddish and Hebrew could appropriate folk- lore, fantasy, and storytelling only as something bracketed in time, some- thing removed from the industrial present by virtue of its style, simplicity, marvelous occurrences, dualistic schemes, and heroic struggles. All these bespoke an act of noblesse oblige on the part of the sophisticated minds that worked so hard to adopt a "lower" form of literature and raise it to the status of Western art. Only Sholem Aleichem achieved a true synthesis of storytelling and contemporary life: something so subtly stylized that it didn't sound like "literature" at all; something so spontaneous and real that it all but covered its anecdotal and mythic tracks; something so normative and commonplace that it appealed to every kind of reader-except the highbrow intellectual. In the typical dialectic of literary evolution, Sholem Aleichem sought to carry out his new agenda by looking to the "periphery" of the Jewish liter- ary "system," that is, to those genres that he and the other innovators had heretofore considered hackneyed, conservative, and outdated.23 Unlike the others, however, Sholem Aleichem went back only one generation, to the 20.

In contrast, the feuilleton and novel genres that he had just spent a decade trying to 24. This is an adaptation of Dov Sadan's thesis outlined in his seminal essay "Three Foundations [Sholem Aleichem and the Yiddish Literary Tradition]" (1959), trans. in Prooftexts 6 (1986): 55-63. 25. The precise genealogy of Sholem Aleichem's monologues has never been established. Sadan (ibid.) argues for a direct link with the "naive" and "satiric" monologues of the Galician Haskalah. Victor Erlich implies a connection to the Russian skaz in "A Note on the Monolo- gue as a Literary Form: Sholem Aleichem's 'Monolgn'-A Test Case," in For Max Weinreich on His Seventieth Birthday.: Studies in Jewish Languages, Literature, and Society, ed.

In "Magidishe maskes fun Markuze biz Mendele" (Paper read at the Second International Conference on Research in Yiddish Language and Literature, Oxford, July 11, 1983), I first suggested that the Tevye monologues be read in the context of "maggidic masks" in Yiddish Haskalah literature. 26.

ROSKIES master were "open" forms in which an omniscient narrator was expected to use a modern, fluid diction to represent the linear course of life in its social causality. Though Sholem Aleichem continued writing feuilletons and novels for the rest of his life, this retrieval of very old-fashioned genres was to finally unlock the source of his genius. In the maggidic monologue, the letter-writer, and the chapbook, Sholem Aleichem discovered an objective correlative for an alternate approach to human existence itself. These closed narrative forms would not serve him merely as a naive folk vehicle which he could then subvert or allegorize to his heart's content, the way Peretz and Berdichewsky creatively betrayed the hasidic tale and monologue. Like Gogol, his new literary idol, Sholem Alei- chem discovered a natural affinity between his own imagination and that of the folk. The patterns of experience that he drew from his own psyche he found to be identical to those of Jewish folklife.29 By appropriating the literary genres most recently rendered obsolete, he could now explore for the first time the interplay of stasis and change, fate and free will, myth and the mundane. And that exploration would corroborate the experience of the folk from below and from within. Few works in Sholem Aleichem's oeuvre stand in such glorious isolation as "A Tale Without an End."30 Though originally conceived as one in a series of endless tales, only one other, Oylem-habe ("Eternal Life," 1902), was ever written, and that story, narrated in a leisurely style in the first per- son, moved realistically from innocence to experience. In contrast, the tale of the frenetic tailor rushing to and from the neighboring town in search of the she-goat his wife sends him out to buy is a self-consuming artifact. It stands alone because fantasy goes berserk here. The myth remains unchecked and unmediated. It is as if, in this one-time experiment in stylized folk narrative, Sholem Aleichem let fantasy loose and watched it 29.

(1) Through its famous opening line, Ish hoyo beZlodievke, with its comic allusion to Job and its friendly jab at Ayzik-Meyer Dik, he signaled to the reader that the story was a foregone conclusion, that the hapless hero would never be able to escape his tragicomic fate. (2) He then proceeded to situate the hero within a charmed circle of like-sounding towns: "there was a man in Zlodeyevke, a shtetl near Mazepevke, not far from Khaplapovitsh and Kozodoyevke, between Yampoli and Strishtsh, just on the way from Pishi-Yabede to Petshi-Khvost to Tetrevits and from there to Yehupets." This was a fictional geography redolent with legends (of Mazepa, the Robin Hood of Russia), with he-goats (kozes) and scoundrels (zlodeyi), with Slavic sounds and Slavic humor. (3) For all the hero's confidence that his voice would finally be heard, whence his nickname, Shimen-Elye Shma Koleynu, Sholem Aleichem endowed him and everyone around him with repetitive, parasitic speech patterns, the product of limited minds that could not cope with the slightest change, let alone with the inscrutable forces conspiring against them. (4) Then, at the center of this grotesque little world, our storybook narrator introduced a she-goat, the symbol of desire, the mythic creature that was supposed to mediate the polarities between husband and wife, rich and poor, town and country, but would, through its constant transformations, turn the hero into a scapegoat and drive him mad. (5) Finally, the most difficult part of Sholem Aleichem's exercise was figuring out how it should end, since, by definition, it was a story never destined to end. At first, as Uri Eisenzweig argued in a brilliant exposition of the story,3' Sholem Aleichem tried to resolve the plot on the plane of his- tory: the workers of Zlodeyevke take up Shimen-Elye's cause and set out in protest for the neighboring town. But in the final version of 1909-11, Sholem Aleichem introduced the storyteller himself as a deus ex machina who alone could rescue the narrative from its subversive indeterminacy and, by extension, save the world from its inevitable fate. Laid bare, as the formalists would say, in this one-of-a-kind stylized chapbook, were the main elements of Sholem Aleichem's storytelling art: the reuse of anecdotes or well-worn plots that allowed for few structural changes; a self-contained symbolic landscape that was both nurturing and 31.

The chapbook format allowed Sholem Aleichem to play with the stylistic and structural conventions of Yiddish popular fiction in such a way as to underline-and undermine-the workings of myth and fantasy. Stylistically, one of two choices was open to him: either to write in daytshmerish, the Ger- manic syntax and vocabulary used to situate a Yiddish narrative in the European romance tradition, or to adopt a more learned, Hebrew-Aramaic style that situated a work within a canon of Jewish sacred legends. (Ayzik- Meyer Dik, the great Yiddish popularizer of the 1850s and 1860s, had cul- tivated both styles, depending on his subject matter.) In "A Tale Without an End," Sholem Aleichem brilliantly exploited the latter possibility by playing two different Hebrew-Aramaic styles off one another: that of the storybook narrator and that of the central male characters.32 Mythic and mock-mythic allusions abounded in their language, beginning, as we have already seen, in the opening sentence of the story. The problem with Shimen-Elye, however, is that his pastiche of Scrip- ture, liturgy, and life is the ossified product of a mind that cannot generate anything new.33 Like Major Kovaliov, the collegiate assessor who wakes up one morning in St. Petersburg to find himself without a nose, Shimen-Elye is a man of limited psychological resources who is trapped by the world of experience.34 Which is too bad, because Shimen-Elye's favorite slogans- hayom haras oylem, "today the world was created," and undzer folk sher un ayzn-amkho, "steam-iron and shears, our people Israel!"-bespeak an optimistic outlook on life and a concern with the commonweal. Among his own-the other laborers and guildsmen of town-Shimen Elye is looked upon as something of a scholar, but his verbal skills carry little weight with 32. On this, see Dov Sadan, "Kmo shekosuv: araynfir-bamerkn tsu Tevye dem milkhikers toyres," in Tsvishn vayt un noent: eseyen, shtudyes, briv (Tel Aviv, 1982), pp. 9-23. 33. The satiric use of parasitic speech patterns in nineteenth-century Yiddish fiction and drama has occupied all of the major scholars in the field. For the most seminal statements, some of which have a direct bearing on Sholem Aleichem, see Meyer Wiener, "Di rol fun shprakh-folkor in der yidisher literature," Shriftn (Kiev) 1 (1928): 73-129; Miron, A Traveler Disguised, esp. pp. 169-179; and Benjamin Hrushovski, "Dekonstruktsiah shel dibbur: Shalom Aleichem veha-semiotika shel ha-folklor ha-yehudi," afterword to his trans. of Tevye hahal- ban ve-monologim (Tel Aviv, 1983), pp. 195-212. 34.

All he can offer in defense on that score is the biblical prooftext hu yimshol bakh, "he shall rule over thee" (Gen. 4:16). Would that it were so! Now when myth functions properly, according to Levi-Strauss, its pur- pose is to mediate the binary oppositions of life and death, heaven and earth, purity and pollution.35 Precisely because Shimen-Elye's world is structured in so binary a fashion-husbands vs. wives, rich vs. poor, town vs. countryside-his failure to see the discrepancy between the ideal and the real, the sacred text and actual experience, is that much more apparent. For Shimen-Elye is a man hemmed in on all sides: tyrannized by a super- regimented, emasculating, and impoverished society and trapped by meta- physical forces outside of his control. On one occasion alone, when released into the great outdoors for the first and only time in his life (the beginning of chapter 2), does he use the liturgy to express the ironic distance between the biblical promise and shtetl reality. Immediately thereafter, buoyed up by his newfound sense of autonomy, he locks horns with his great adversary, Dodi the Innkeeper. And that is Shimen-Elye's undoing. Dodi is the very embodiment of myth. He is the lord of enchantment, "a hairy, thickset Jew with a big belly and a potato nose and the voice of a wild ox," i.e., an ogre. Dodi is the perfect foil to our curly black-haired hero Shimen-Elye with his goatee and flattened nose and groove down his lower lip, all of which make him look like a goat even before his trials begin. And the setting for this battle between ogre and man-goat is equally fantastical: an enchanted inn situated midway between the poles of desire. This en- chanted setting is what characterized both of Sholem Aleichem's "Tales Without an End" and would later resurface in many different guises.36 Just as Dodi's Oak Tavern exerts an ambiguous pull on all travelers- whether for good or for evil is still uncertain-the goal of Shimen-Elye's expedition is a town of appearances. How, for instance, can one expect to find a she-goat in a town called He-Goatsville, where peasant women in the market confuse a rooster with a hen, and where people's nicknames mask what they really are: Khayim-Khone the Wise is anything but, and his wife, 35.

ROSKIES Teme-Gitl the Silent, never shuts up? Indeed, what Shimen-Elye discovers in Khayim-Khone the melamed is his exact counterpart-another hen- pecked husband who operates with a fixed repertoire of religious formu- lae.37 No chance to redeem one's manhood here! The selfsame Khayim-Khone, however, first calls attention to the goat as a multidetermined mythic figure. Through his discussion of the Gemara which Shimen-Elye happens to walk in on, the reader is warned that goats beget sorrow, because as symbols of human desire they are bound to incur double damages. Az der shnayder iz arayngekumen tsu reb Khayim-Khone dem klugn, hot er im getrofn bay der arbet, vu er iz gezesn ... iber der gemore un gelernt mit di talmidim mit a nign af koley-koyles di gemore Bove kame: "Hahu barkho di dozike tsig, vos zi hot derzen a min esnvarg fun oybn afn fesl, hot zikh di tsig tsugekhapt tsum esnvarg.... Khayvo Rovo, hot Rovo gepasknt, az zi darf batsoln farn esnvarg un farn fesl dem gantsn hezek..." When the tailor entered the house of Reb Khayim-Khone the Wise, he found him at work ... bent over the Gemara, leading his pupils at the tops of their voices through the Talmud passage "On Damages": "Now that goat, when it saw that there was food on the top of the barrel, that same goat leaped toward that same food... Rabbah said 'Guilty,' and set it down that she must pay for the fodder and the barrel that was damaged." (Y 14-15, 16; E 14, 15) Hebrew-Aramaic, the language of Jewish learning and rational dis- course, becomes instead the main repository of the myth, at least for the male members of shtetl society. It is more than these hapless henpecked hus- bands can bear. Whereas Shimen-Elye uses ineffectual mantras lifted from the liturgy, Khayim-Khone the melamed drills his unfortunate charges in a seemingly irrelevant passage from the Talmud. But the tailor's mythic quest for the nurturing she-goat seems to have disturbed the status quo and endowed all the goat-texts with a power of their own that cannot be domes- ticated by traditional means. Henceforth, many voices try to interpret the role of the goat-as goblin, as gilgul, as the kid of the Khad Gadya-but none dares verbalize its true 37. Eisenzweig, "Le Chtettl," p. 149.</page><page sequence="15">SHOLEM ALEICHEM 41 mythic function: Having failed to reconcile the polarities of life, the goat should serve as biblical scapegoat and be cast into the wilderness, thus expiating the failings of a very flawed society. Instead, in the story's ultimate transformation, Shimen-Elye himself becomes the sacrificial victim, while the goat runs wild and disappears. In this way Sholem Aleichem introduced a Jewish mythic component as a tragic subtext to a comic folktale plot. In the parodic folktale, the hero's back-and-forth movement between two essentially identical towns could conceivably go on forever, gaining in comic momentum as more people are drawn into the act. But through the biblical-talmudic-haggadic goat, Sholem Aleichem injected the fatalistic themes of thwarted desire, victimiza- tion, and vicarious sacrifice. The goat that was to provide the milk for Shimen-Elye's starving family causes his blood to be spilt instead.38 On every conceivable level, then, the "Tale Without an End" tells of failed mediation: of a traditional society that could not even resolve the petty rivalry between two neighboring towns; of a traditional language that did more to obfuscate and mystify reality than to break it down into man- ageable parts; of a mythic force let loose by the tailor's innocent quest that destroys him, his family, and the equilibrium of his town. Never before had a stylized Jewish folktale been used to expose so much dissolution. Never would Sholem Aleichem use this genre to do so again. Instead, there emerged out of the crucible of the "Tale Without an End" a new, normative mythology such as Jewish literature had not seen before, a humanistic myth that was both profoundly consolational and deeply ironic. On the simplest level, what made it normative was that Sholem Aleichem conjured up a world of mainstream, proto-misnagdic, East European Judaism: Hasidism, Kabbalah, demonology, heaven and hell-the stock-in- trade of Jewish neoromanticism-figured in these stories hardly at all. Dodi the innkeeper, who keeps switching the goats on poor Shimen-Elye, is the most demonic character in Sholem Aleichem's storytelling corpus, just as the motif of the gilgul is about the closest that Sholem Aleichem ever came to Kabbalah. Even the Sabbath, so central to Heine, Bialik, and Asch, 38. Cf. the following in Stith Thompson's Motif-Index of Folk Literature, rev. ed., 6 vols. (Bloomington and London, 1966): man transformed into a goat (D 134), goat's milk is in- exhaustible (D 1652.3.2), revenant as goat (E 423.1.9), the devil in the form of a goat (G 303.3.3.1.6), and esp. tailor associated with a goat (X 222).</page><page sequence="16">42 DAVID G. ROSKIES played no role in Sholem Aleichem's search for Jewish myth. (According to Berkovitsh, Sholem Aleichem probably remembered the Sabbath as a time of boredom and intolerable restrictions.39) Rather, it was material culture, in the main, that mediated the myth. Sholem Aleichem understood that the folk apprehended the great myths of creation, revelation, and redemption through ritual objects and local custom. In particular, it was the holiday cycle-building a sukkah, buying an esrog, dancing with a flag on Simkhes Torah, leading the children through hakofes, lighting candles and playing cards on Hanukkah, deliver- ing shalekhmones on Purim or putting on a purim-shpil, and above all, preparing for and celebrating the seder-it was on these communal and familial occasions that the ordinary Jew, rich or poor, male or female, ex- perienced the transcendent power of Jewish myth. It was the time, to use Bakhtin's now-famous term, that the carnival aspect of life broke through the everyday routine. (To be sure, the Jewish "carnival" was a far cry from the Bacchanalia, or even from Breughel; still, in the relative asceticism of the shtetl, a few good drinks could go a long way!) Through his emphasis on material culture and the carnival, Sholem Alei- chem expressed his egalitarian and humanistic bias. This was a Judaism equally accessible to all and not limited to the formal religious institutions. Though Shimen-Elye, the liturgical voice of the shtetl artisans, fails to use his modicum of learning to achieve a balance between myth and reality, other nonclerical figures in Sholem Aleichem's stories succeed. By making creative use of Jewish sacred texts they form a kind of folk aristocracy: Tevye the dairyman, Fishl the melamed, Berl Vinegar, Yankl Yunever, and more. Thus the myth could also be mediated by a certain type of folk hero who was situated outside the synagogue, the studyhouse, and the yeshiva, and got his hands dirty in the mud and muddle of everyday life. To a greater or lesser degree these characters had their own ironic sense of the discrepancy between the real and the ideal. Through them, as through the celebration of the holidays, the myth was invoked as a foil to reality. Nowhere was the gap between present reality and future promise drawn so precisely and so poignantly as in the holiday stories that Sholem Alei- chem began writing in earnest after 1900. What made them so poignant- 39. Undzere rishoynim, 2:73.</page><page sequence="17">SHOLEM ALEICHEM 43 and so true to the folk conception of life-was that they showed how fleeting was the moment of transcendence, if achieved at all.40 For the plot of these stories, such as it was, presented one of two alternatives: either the King- for-a-day motif or the Marred Holiday (der farshterter yontef). In either event, whether Yuzik the Orphan becomes king of the seder or Leybl bites off the pitom of the coveted esrog before it can be used, the celebrant has to return to the grind, to a life that is unredeemed. "My heart is shattered," says the child-narrator at the end of "The Guest," the story of an exotic visitor who absconds with the family silver, jewelry, and maid.4' nisht af di zilberne koyses mit di zilberne lefl, goplen un mesers, vos zenen nem gevorn, un nisht af der mames tsirung, un nisht afn mezumen gelt, un nisht af Rikl di moyd-khapt zi der ruekh!-nor af dem gliklekhn-gliklekhn land, vos se valgern zikh dortn brilyantn, perlen, dimentn, un af dem beys- amigdesh, mit di kehanim, mit di leviyim, mitn orgl, mitn mizbeyakh, mit di korbones un mit di ale iberike gute zakhn, vos me hot bay mir avekgeroybt, tsugenumen, tsugenumen, tsugenumen. But not on account of the loss of our goblets and silverware or of my mother's scanty jewelry and the money. Not on account of Rickel the maid-the devil taker her! But because now I will never see that happy, happy land where precious stones lie carelessly about in the streets, where there is a holy temple with priests, Levites, an organ, and an ancient altar with sacrifices. All these marvelous things cruelly, wantonly stolen from me... Here, unlike "The Penknife," the child is transported into the world of myth as a matter of course; yet even so normative a dream cannot be sus- tained for more than a few hours. That is because the myth in Sholem Aleichem's stories now functioned as an ironic foil even when it was ostensibly most potent. Sometimes the glass was half-full and sometimes it was half-empty, but never was a state of permanent fullness held out as a realistic possibility. One way, then, that the great myths operated in Sholem Aleichem's 40. These are collected in the following volumes of Ale verk in the Folksfond ed.: Fun pey- sekh biz peysekh (vol. 2); Lekoved yontef (vols. 22-23), as well as in many of the Mayses far yidishe kinder (Vols. 8-9) which also double as holiday tales. 41.

ROSKIES stories was through the actual behavior and speech of very ordinary Jews. On the one hand, myth allowed them a momentary reprieve from the pain and drugery of life, and on the other, it underlined the unbridgeable gap between transcendence and life's inherent constraints. In the folklore of the nations, the operative myth was heroic; it was a tale of conquest and happy endings. Among Jews, the best that could be hoped for was a tale of averted disaster. In contemporary Jewish folklore Sholem Aleichem found the one recurrent plot that confirmed his innermost sense of life: "Ale yidishe mayses," he wrote in 1903, "ale umglikn bay undz heybn zikh on fun a kleynikayt" ("all Jewish tales, all disasters among us begin with a trivial occurrence"). And as for the endings: "Yidishe mayses lozn zikh oys, tsum maynstn, troyerik" ("Jewish stories end, for the most part, on a sad note").42 As a writer of sentimental novels, as a so-called realist, Sholem Aleichem always bowed to convention by ending his well-made plots on a more-or-less happy note. As a storyteller, Sholem Aleichem tried as best he could to mitigate the tragic ending that all Jewish stories had to end with.43 He did it most boldly in the final version of "A Tale Without an End." The new ending deserves to be quoted in full even though everyone has heard parts of it before. Un der hayoytsey lonu mize? Un der may-ko-mashmo-lon fun der mayse?- vet fregn der lezer.

The second is from "Di fon" (1900), Felitonen (Tel Aviv, 1976), p. 25. 43. Here I take issue with David Neal Miller, who argued: "the logic of fiction insists upon unhappy endings, the vocation of the storyteller upon happy ones." See "'Don't Force Me to Tell You the Ending': Closure in the Short Fiction of Sh. Rabinovitsh (Sholem-Aleykhem)," Neophilologus (Amsterdam) 66 (1982): 106.</page><page sequence="19">SHOLEM ALEICHEM 45 "What is the moral of this tale?" the reader will ask. Don't press me, friends. It was not a good ending. The tale began cheerfully enough, and it ended as most such happy stories do-badly. And since you know the author of the story-that he is not naturally a gloomy fellow and hates to complain and prefers cheerful stories-and you know that he hates insisting on a story's "moral," and that moralizing is not his manner. . . . Then let the maker of the tale take his leave of you smiling, and let him wish you, Jews-and all mankind-more laughter than tears. Laughter is good for you. Doctors pre- scribe laughter. This statement could not have been written in 1901, for then, at the beginning of his career as master storyteller, Sholem Aleichem was still looking to history to provide him with an ending. Now, in 1909-11, it was after the failed revolution of 1905; after his permanent exodus from Russia; after his near-fatal attack of tuberculosis in the midst of a triumphal return visit; after years of recuperation in this spa and that; and after he had com- posed the bulk of his major story-cycles, none of which, as yet, had actually ended.44 It was also during this period of enforced exile that Sholem Alei- chem returned repeatedly to the figure of Shmulik the orphan, ever enhanc- ing his status in the author's fictional autobiography so as to portray the Sholem Aleichem persona as a traditional storyteller.45 As opposed to the comic Hebrew-Yiddish glosses with which the story began, this author's finale was written in a weighty, repetitive, heavily Hebraized style, suggesting the importance the author himself attached to these thoughts. It was the closest he ever came to an explication of his story- telling art. The "closed" form of the story, he might have been saying, in anticipation of Umberto Eco, was addressed to Everyman ("Jews-and all mankind"), and therefore could yield as many potential meanings as there were readers. Unlike the novels that he was forced to write at the behest of his newspaper bosses, stories did not require of an Ideal Reader to respond in a prescribed way; and so, the "moral" be damned. 44. In a letter of 1 May 1909 to his Yiddish publisher Y. Lidsky, Sholem Aleichem wrote: "Neither you nor I should publicize the 'Tale Without an End,' because what you have is the revised copy ('The Haunted Tailor')." Two years later he instructed his son-in-law Berkovitsh to publish the story with its new ending (letters of 10 and 24 March 1911, in Russian). I am indebted to Dr. Abraham Novershtern for this information. As mentioned earlier, this new ending did not appear in print until 1913. 45. Roskies, "Unfinished Business," pp. 73-74.</page><page sequence="20">46 DAVID G. ROSKIES Secondly, the storyteller was the doctor of the soul. He alone knew the diagnosis, having laid bare the recurrent pattern underlying the vagaries of life. He alone could describe the myth as actually lived-truncated, ironic, tragic. He alone could piece it back together again by playing the different forces off one another: language against life, stasis against historical change, fate against free will. In the end, it was the story itself that kept hope alive, or more precisely, the ability of Jews to reconstitute themselves wherever they were into a com- munity of listeners-whether as third-class passengers on a Russian train or on board a ship bound for America or even as a one-time audience to hear the famous Sholem Aleichem himself read aloud from his works. And the story they heard, as told to them by a master raconteur, an expert in Jewish life and lore, was a story that could happen to anyone precisely because ver- sions of it had already happened countless times before: in the home of a Shunammite woman, in the land of Uz, or in some enchanted forest.
