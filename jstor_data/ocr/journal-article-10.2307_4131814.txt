Despite the focus by the popular media on the revival of Jewish instrumen- tal klezmer music during the past decades, surprisingly little of a scholarly nature has been written until recently about either the klezmer tradition or its revival. Since 1999 a relatively large number of new book publications of both a scholar- ly and a popular nature have appeared. Besides the four volumes under review here, they include books by Rita Ottens and Joel Rubin, Moshe Beregovski, Seth Ro- govoy, Mark Slobin, Zinovij Stoljar, and Yale Strom.2 It is hoped that the publica- 1.

Rubin tion of these four works (and the other recent works not reviewed here) will open a broader discussion of the complex of issues surrounding klezmer and hasidic mu- sic and stimulate further research in these areas. The publications discussed here span several interrelated topics, most promi- nently hasidic musical traditions and klezmer music. As the mostly hereditary so- cioeconomic group of professional instrumentalists within Yiddish-speaking, Eastern European Jewry, klezmorim performed a ritual and entertainment function at weddings and other celebratory events. In this capacity they functioned, among other things, as mediators between the various hasidic courts and between hasidic and non-hasidic Jews. A number of well-known klezmorim were hasidim or had been raised in hasidic families, including the popular New York immigrant clar- inetists Naftule Brandwein (1884-1963) and Dave Tarras (1895-1989), whose music has been canonized by the klezmer revival.3 Within the scope of this inter- action, klezmer music has been considered by some to be a subset of hasidic mu- sic (i.e., comprising the instrumental repertoire associated primarily with the events surrounding the traditional wedding); others interpret hasidic dance tunes (nigunim) as a subset of klezmer music (i.e., as constituting a portion of the total repertoire of klezmorim). Ellen Koskoff's Music in Lubavitcher Life is the first monograph in English dealing with hasidic musical traditions, and the first in any language to focus on music within a single American court-that of the Lubavitcher or Chabad hasidim. It is based on field work carried out intensively from 1973-1976 and on and off through 1995 in three Lubavitcher communities in the United States: Crown Heights in Brooklyn, Pittsburgh, and St. Paul, although the primary focus is on musical life in the group's spiritual and administrative center in Crown Heights. Many readers interested in Jewish life may not realize how central a role music plays in Hasidism. In fact, one could argue that Hasidism cannot be understood without it. Building on previous writings on hasidic music, in particular by Yaakov Mazor and Andre Hajdu,4 Koskoff looks at the relationship between Chabad phi- losophy and its performance through music, as well as at societal changes that have occurred in the United States during the past several decades and the Lubavitcher response to them. These include the "back to the roots" movement (as evidenced by the absorption of non-hasidic returnees or ba'alei teshuvah), the women's move- Avant-Garde (Chapel Hill: Algonquin Books, 2000); Mark Slobin, ed., American Klezmer: Its Roots and Offshoots (Berkeley/Los Angeles/London: University of California Press, 2002); Zinovij Stoljar, A yiddishe Doyne: Jiidische Volksmusik in Osteuropa.

At the same time, it is a work of what Koskoff terms "self-reflexive ethnography." Following the current trend in an- thropological and ethnomusicological writing, she includes herself in the dis- course, bringing in her own changing attitudes as a secular Jew and feminist to- wards Orthodox Judaism and her process of personal growth. In this extremely well-organized study, Koskoff systematically builds her case, moving from the general to the specific. It first sets the scene with a de- scription of afarbrengen (hasidic gathering) with the now-deceased Lubavitcher Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson and his followers in the early 1970s (chap. 1), followed by a short analytical framework (chap. 2). Here, Koskoff places her- self within the anthropological tradition of Anglo-American ethnomusicology founded by Alan Merriam in the 1960s; at the same time she has been influenced by the more recent postmodernist writings of the 1990s. Within the studies of Jew- ish musical traditions, she has also adopted Mark Slobin's work on the music of American Jewish immigrants as a model for the present study, "because it attempts to integrate musical sound with social structure and religious ideology." She also aligns herself with recent studies (such as the work of William Shaffir and Janet Belcove-Shalin) concerned with the hasidic response to modernization, secular- ization and assimilation. In addition, Koskoff draws upon current streams of schol- arly thought on gender and performance theory. Koskoff elaborates on the context of her study by reviewing first the histo- ry and philosophy of Chabad Hasidism (chap. 3) and then surveying contempo- rary life among the Lubavitcher hasidim in Brooklyn (chap. 4). Chapter 5 looks at Lubavitcher conceptions of music and melody. In it, she introduces the concepts of "music as process" (72-74) and "musical tikkun." By music as process, she means that Lubavitchers view music as "inherently neutral." It is through the process of performing that the individual is pulled toward the divine soul or toward the animal soul (both of which reside in every individual). Musical tikkun refers to the four-stage transformation made to melodies borrowed from outside of the Lubavitcher or hasidic sphere-the primary form of Lubavitcher musical compo- sition (77)-from the identification of a "holy spark" hidden within the melody to its release and return to its proper (i.e., holy) place. Such melodies "had to under- go a considerable spiritual transformation. They had to be removed from their non- Jewish performance contexts, changed significantly, and reinterpreted within a Lubavitcher context to take on their new form as nigun" (93). The chapter con- cludes with an analysis of the Sefer Ha-Nigunim, the codification of core Luba- vitcher repertoire compiled by Rabbi Samuel Zalmanoff.5 Chapter 6 looks at musical structures, first in terms of traditional Eastern European Jewish music in general ("Jewish musical codes"), and then in the core Chabad nigun repertoire, focusing in particular on the ten pieces attributed to R. Schneur Zalman (incorrectly cited by Koskoff as comprising thirteen pieces). It is here that Koskoff's book is least convincing. It does not sufficiently differentiate between the musical characteristics of Eastern European Jewish music, hasidic music as a subset thereof, and Lubavitcher music as one stream within hasidic mu- 5.

This is likely due to the fact that there have been too few detailed area studies of Eastern European Jewish musical traditions up until now with which Lubav- itcher style could be compared and contrasted, and because Lubavitcher music was first documented in print only in 1948 and in recorded form in 1960-some 150 years after the creation of the style and a number of its melodies. Two important points that tie Lubavitcher musical structures to Chabad philosophy are brought out: (i) that the number four (an important number in many aspects of Chabad thought) appears to play an important role at the level of the length and number of individual musical phrases and sections of compositions; and (ii) that many of the nigunim follow a kind of "rising pattern" in which "each stanza either extends its range upward or is placed at a higher range," which corresponds to the "upward trajectory of the process of devekut and resonates with the core Lubavitcher metaphor of movement from the heart ... to the head" (93). Furthermore, Koskoff establishes that the vocables used in textless nigunim, which have often been assumed to consist of "nonsense" syllables, are "phonemically consistent with He- brew, Russian, and Yiddish, the languages spoken by a majority of Eastern Euro- pean hasidim," and, further, that the vocables "carry much meaning for Lu- bavitchers" and "are believed to symbolize the four letters of God's name." Chapters 7-10 move on to actual case studies of music as it is performed in contemporary Lubavitcher life and how the performance of music serves in the performance of various aspects of Lubavitcher identity. Chapter 7 examines mu- sic-making at the farbrengens and on Lubavitcher recordings ("Performing the Past in Music"), emphasizing the core Lubavitcher belief that "true spirituality is irrevocably linked to the past" (105). Chapter 8 deals with gender issues in con- temporary Lubavitcher life, containing a detailed account and analysis of the var- ious interpretations of the dictum kol 'isha cervah ("a woman's voice is a sexual in- citement"). One response to the prohibition of males' hearing the singing of women has been the creation of occasions, such as women'sfarbrengens (chap. 9) and conventions (chap. 10), during which women perform music with and for women only. Chapter 9 looks at "performing lineage in music," dealing with the spiritual hierarchy in the Lubavitcher community from the standpoint of the rela- tionship to music-making of the different groups, from the Rebbe through the peo- ple born into the Lubavitcher community on down to the various levels of ba'alei teshuvah. Chapter 10 examines differing musical responses to modernity within the Lubavitcher community. One of the great strengths of this book is that it manages to show the many internal tensions and different layers within Lubavitcher society and music-mak- ing without ever losing sight of the core concepts and the core music that tie Lubav- itcher society together. These are "a basic conceptualization of music, a stable hi- erarchy of musical genres, a strict adherence to correct performance contexts and behaviors, and a solid bedrock of religious and social structures on which to hang the flexible and always changing musical choices made in real life" (194). Like any focused study, Music in Lubavitcher Life raises perhaps as many questions as it answers. The reader might want to know, for example, what the role of music is in other important Lubavitcher contexts such as in the Chabad liturgy at weddings and holidays. Koskoff also does not look at the interaction, musical or 148</page><page sequence="5">Review Essay otherwise, of Chabad with other hasidic groups. It is not clear-other than the core of the songs attributed to the five Lubavitcher Rebbes and their court musicians- what exactly differentiates Chabad music from other hasidic music. One final point, and this was apparently the publisher's decision: this major work could have been greatly enhanced by the inclusion of an accompanying compact disc, espe- cially since much of the music Koskoff discusses is based on her own field record- ings or is not widely available commercially. Music in Lubavitcher Life is a pro- found work that should be required reading for anyone interested not only in Judaic studies, but also in ethnomusicology, anthropology, and American studies, as well. Yaakov Mazor's short monograph The Klezmer Tradition in the Land of Is- rael is the result of thirty years of research and fieldwork on hasidic musical tra- ditions in Israel. It, too, is the first monograph on its subject, and is additionally the only one of the four publications under review to deal with the interrelation- ship between hasidic and klezmer music. Mazor's approach tends to be more his- torically and musicologically oriented than Koskoff's. The adoption of a more self- reflexive approach could have benefited the present work, as Mazor was raised as a hasid and knows the hasidic world intimately from the inside. The Klezmer Tra- dition in the Land of Israel is organized thematically, beginning with short histo- ries of the klezmer tradition in Jerusalem and Galilee, and in Jaffa and the south- ern moshavot. The information is based primarily upon oral histories conducted by Mazor and others, as well as accounts from the memoir literature. As Mazor points out, knowledge of the Israeli klezmer tradition is "highly fragmentary" (15)-in- deed, beyond two musical generations, not much is known about it. The discussion beginning in Chapter 2 ("Historical Background") reveals a number of differences between the klezmer tradition as it developed in Israel and the more familiar traditions in Eastern Europe and North America.6 It may there- fore make sense to consider the klezmer traditions as they developed in Eastern Europe, North America, and the Land of Israel from the mid- to late-nineteenth century and later to be related traditions, which had points of contact but which also developed to a large extent separately from one another. For example, the klezmer tradition as it evolved in Eastern Europe and as it continued in the United States was a professional tradition; in Israel, there are no accounts of fully professional musicians prior to the 1990s. This appears to have been the result of poor economic conditions as well as the Ashkenazic rabbinical ban on instrumental music in Jerusalem, which has been in effect since the 1860s (18-19). The instrumentation of the ensembles in the Land of Israel developed along different lines than Europe or America. While the turn-of-the-century en- sembles in Europe consisted of seven to twenty instrumentalists using various 6.

Rubin string, woodwind, brass, and percussion instruments, the typical Israeli ensemble comprised only two to three instruments, usually clarinet and percussion, less fre- quently with the addition of trumpet or violin. In Eastern Europe, it was tradition- al for klezmorim to accompany numerous rituals and celebrations associated with the Jewish wedding with instrumental music, from the ceremonial signing of the tnoim (engagement contract), to escorting the bride to the mikvah on the eve of the wedding, to nocturnal processions through the streets after the various festive meals. In Israel, the performance of instrumental music at such occasions contin- ued into the 1920s, whereas, in the United States, the role of klezmer music ap- pears to have been largely limited to performances in the wedding hall itself on the day of the wedding ceremony from the very beginning of immigration in the late 1800s. In addition to continuing to accompany the same rituals as had been done in Europe, new contexts arose in Israel for the performance of klezmer music, in par- ticular the annual hillulot (folk festivals) of Lag Ba-Omer and the 7th of Adar- both of which involve pilgrimages to Mount Meron, near Safed. In the Land of Is- rael, klezmorim were (and still are) "deeply observant people who obeyed the rab- bis without question" (20), and klezmer music was strictly the provenience of the people known today as haredim. The Israeli repertoire comprised primarily what Mazor terms "Romanian-Wallachian melodies" or Eastern European klezmer tunes (22), instrumental versions of Yiddish songs, Turkish tunes from the Turkish army orchestra, and Arab-derived tunes. The latter two parts of the Israeli reper- toire were completely unknown to both European and American klezmorim. Perhaps the most significant difference between the klezmer tradition as it developed in the Land of Israel and its American variant is that the Israeli tradition is today almost exclusively the product of traditional Judaism. Other than a few commercial events such as the annual International Klezmer Festival in Safed, klezmer music simply does not exist outside of haredi society and, more peripher- ally, the National Religious movement. In America, on the other hand, klezmer mu- sic enjoyed a brief period of more secular development, especially between ap- proximately 1910-1950. The second part of Mazor's work (chaps. 3 and 4) consists of case studies of the two most influential Israeli clarinetists of the past seventy years: Abraham Se- gal (1908-1993) and his protege, Moshe "Musa" Berlin (b. 1938), who served a diverse clientele of hasidim, mitnagedim, and members of the National Religious movement. These studies are based largely upon interviews with Berlin and with Segal's surviving relatives. While the European klezmorim consisted almost en- tirely of families of musicians, in which the tradition was handed down from fa- ther to son over the course of at least several generations, the evidence that Segal and the other musicians stemmed from such musical dynasties is scant. Berlin, at least, did not. They learned rather from diverse sources: in the early years directly from musicians and participants at weddings and other celebrations, and later from radio and recordings, as well. In Europe, America, and Israel, many talented and musically literate klezmorim and especially their children began to leave the klezmer milieu and enter the musical mainstream, either in the classical or enter- tainment music fields, or sometimes both. Yet a limited number of members of 150</page><page sequence="7">Review Essay klezmer families emigrated to Israel during the interwar years or as survivors of the Shoah and continued to perform klezmer music there in the postwar period. Because of the sacred-secular split in postwar Israeli society, their more "world- ly" form of klezmer music, which included popular Polish and Russian tangos, was largely not accepted by haredi society, and non-haredi society was not interested in klezmer musicians with their-from a Zionist perspective-"negative 'Diaspo- ra' image" (33). It is unfortunate that these musicians have not been included in the present study. The remaining chapters deal with musical-technical aspects, including reper- toire (chap. 5), "genres" (chap. 6), "musical morphology" (chap. 7), "klezmorim as creative musicians" (chap. 8), and the meticulous annotation of the transcriptions of the 73 pieces included from the Israeli klezmer repertoire. Again, the text brings out important distinctions between the Israeli and the other two main klezmer tra- ditions. It appears, for example, that unlike their European and American col- leagues, who were known for being both composers and performers, Israeli klez- morim did not and do not compose new pieces. They are known, rather, for being compilers and arrangers of existing melodies. This is not to say that the Israeli klez- morim are not creative musicians. One interesting process brought out by Mazor is the adaptation of traditional melodies from Eastern Europe to new functions in Is- rael. For example, so-called gas nigunim (street processionals), which in Europe had served to accompany important wedding guests through the streets, were adopt- ed for the procession with the Torah scroll as part of the Lag Ba-Omer festival. Mazor's monograph is a substantial contribution to the literature on klezmer music and fills important gaps in our knowledge of how this tradition developed and continues to develop in Israel. It serves two main functions: it provides a his- tory of klezmer music in pre-Israeli Palestine in the period prior to the mid-1930s, and it offers case studies of the two most prominent Israeli klezmorim of recent memory. What it does not do is look at the changes taking place in Israeli klezmer music today. This is partly because the work was ten years in the making. Musa Berlin is today 67 years old, and there are two or three generations of hasidic in- strumentalists who began their careers after he did and have played or are today playing important roles in haredi musical life.' It would have been fascinating to include these younger generations of musicians into the study, but perhaps that would have been beyond the scope of the present work. In addition, it would have been very interesting for the readers to learn what differences, if any, exist between the music peformed in hasidic, mitnagedic, National Religious, and even secular contexts, as well as how the music of klezmorim such as Berlin differs from that of the singer-drummers who perform at haredi weddings within Jerusalem, where the playing of instruments is still forbidden by Ashkenazim today. Also interesting would be more about the meaning of the music for both the musicians and their various audiences, including more contextualization of the position of the klezmer in contemporary Israeli society. 7.

Rubin Mark Slobin's Fiddler on the Move is the culmination of many years of thought on the klezmer revival and Euro-American revival movements in general. In his introductory chapter, Slobin points out what he sees as the essential Amer- ican-ness of the early klezmer revival and places it within the overall sphere of the new multiculturalism, which arose in the wake of the bicentennial celebrations of 1976 in the United States. An early observer of the klezmer revival, Slobin ana- lyzes here the unpredictable development of the revival from a relatively small group ofAmerican Jews in the late 1970s and early 1980s to an international move- ment with thousands of followers by the late 1990s. The fieldwork that forms the basis of this book was carried out mostly in 1997-1998, and this book is best un- derstood as a snapshot of the transatlantic klezmer revival at that time. In a con- tinuation of his thoughts on subcultural music-making,8 the present work is based largely on an ethnomusicological adaptation of cultural theory and is most con- cerned with developing a loose but comprehensive theoretical framework for the understanding of what has proven to be a very elusive topic. As Slobin remarks, "Things were so molten in the mid-1990s that it was hard to find my methodolog- ical footing." He found himself faced with the challenge of "how to study a con- stantly morphing and expanding musical system with no surviving homeland, as played by insiders with outsider mentalities and outsiders with uncanny intuitions about how the music works" (5). Whereas historically, klezmorim formed a com- munity in the literal sense, a "continuous chain of overlapping musical and fami- ly links in a spread-out system of town-based musical professionalism" (67), the complexities of community life in the klezmer revival require "different theoreti- cal models than classic ethnography ...." (72). Based largely on interviews-the book focuses in particular on the experi- ences of four female violinist-informants as case studies-but also on his own par- ticipation in the klezmer movement as a violin student, Slobin spins his theory around a set of key concepts: klezmer as a heritage music (chap. 2: "music that has been singled out for preservation, protection, enshrinement, and revival");9 klezmer as an urge (chap. 3: "what moves musicians and excites audiences to em- brace klezmer?" [5]); klezmer as community (chap. 4); klezmer style as statement (chap. 5); and, finally, issues of identity (chap. 6). Slobin weaves a shifting matrix of terms onto these basic concepts, which he spends considerable space defining and expanding upon. Slobin sees a "klezmer core" at the center of all of these overlapping matrices, which "remains untouched by comparativism. The overlaps provide bridges to the core that both outsiders and insiders traverse in search of nostalgia or novelty, tradi- tion or trade" (35). Yet he also points out the significant level of diversity within the "klezmer umbrella." Slobin sees what he terms "nostalgic diasporism" (i.e., ex- pressing nostalgia for Yiddish language and culture [29]) as being the primary set- ting for the music of the klezmer revival, a tendency inherited from the legacy of Fid- dler on the Roof-which had for the first time "provided a safe place for visiting the 8.

At the same time, he identifies the klezmer movement as part of the "general drive for reaffiliation with Jewishness that has snowballed since the 1960s to become the most important trend in Jewish-American life" (30). In Chapter 3, Slobin brings the experiences of his four informants into the discussion. Here it becomes particularly clear that this is not a comprehensive treatment of the klezmer revival (which it does not claim to be), but rather a set of interlocking essays centered around these four case studies. Based upon the dif- fering experiences of these four musicians and his other interview partners, Slobin sums up thus: "'Klezmer,' a shifting, multilayered assemblage of contexts and items, exists because many people have a stake in it for a huge variety of reasons, often several at once" (64). Chapter 4 includes a discussion of the problematic klezmer revival in con- temporary Central and Eastern Europe (83-90). Chapter 5 looks at certain stylis- tic aspects of the "core" repertoire of the American klezmer revivalists, in partic- ular the "canon" of the two American immigrant clarinetists Brandwein and Tarras as it is being reinterpreted by the current generation of musicians. He uses a com- parative approach, taking three tunes as case studies, which he combines with the comments of his informants to "illuminate three questions: How do modern play- ers understand the older repertoire that has now become a modern canon? How do they conceptualize their technique? How do they arrive at personal style?" (94).10 Finally, in Chapter 6, Slobin tackles issues of identity, the "knotted central term that has been noticeably absent throughout" his discussion (133). It is clear that identity is at the core of the klezmer revival movement. This has been expressed in the numerous interviews in Slobin's book, and independently in articles by Bar- bara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, Alicia Svigals, and Frank London,I' among others- and is corroborated by my own experiences both as a participant in and observer of the klezmer revival movement. That participation in the revival is so close to the heart of many participants-be they American, German, or Polish-is evident, for example, in the vehemence of the ongoing debates carried out on the Internet dis- cussion list "World music from a Jewish slant."'2 The debate about the future of klezmer music represents nothing less in the eyes of the participants than the fu- ture of Judaism, or the formation of a new German or Central European national identity. Fiddler on the Move is an extremely compact and dense extended essay, and it has been possible to touch on only a few of the issues raised in it. It presents the complex intersection of conflicting approaches present in the klezmer revival in its many facets. Its very complexity may leave the reader more confused than before, but will ideally lead to a contemplation of the many contradictions shown and to 10.

Rubin a broader understanding of the motivations of the various types of people drawn to participation in klezmer. One problem with such an all-inclusive theory as the one developed here by Slobin is that it can tend to obscure fundamental sets of oppositions, such as dif- ferences between the klezmer tradition as it developed in Europe (and later in America) over the course of several centuries and the music performed by klezmer revivalists of all stripes;13 differences between the American participants in the klezmer revival, who are predominantly Jewish and for whom it may generally be said that the creation of a new American Jewish identity is the core issue in- volved, 14 and the almost exclusively non-Jewish participants in the German klez- mer movement, for whom the klezmer repertoire serves as a forum for so-called Vergangenheitsbewdltigung and the building of a new German identity;'" and dif- ferences between contemporary Israeli klezmer musicians, who are predominant- ly haredi, and non-Israeli participants in the klezmer revival, who are virtually all non-Orthodox.16 In this sense, perhaps it would make more sense to look at the klezmer revival as a set of mini-revivals, as argued by Julia Phillips Randel with regard to the revival of Sephardic song.17 Furthermore, placing the klezmer movement within the larger discourse of the Yiddish-language movement since the 1960s and the current Jewish Renewal movement (as exemplified by Lisa Schiffman's Generation J) would show its cen- trality as an indicator at the popular culture level of much of what is going on in contemporary American Jewish society.'8 One should also place the klezmer dis- 13.

In a parallel to klezmer as a possible response to Haim Soloveitchik's "end of self-evident Jewishness" postulated by Kirshenblatt-GimblettI9-the other possible response being contemporary haredi life-the klezmer urge could be seen as one possible secular way of mourning the Shoah (i.e., the loss of Yiddish language and culture), the other end of the spec- trum being represented by the Bobover hasidim piremshpiyl as described by Shifra Epstein.20 Fiddler on the Move provides an excellent foundation for the study of the klezmer revival. What is needed now more are concentrated area studies, such as Abigail Wood's recently completed dissertation on the Yiddish song revival in North America and the one in progress by Rita Ottens on the klezmer and Yiddish music movement in Berlin.21 Henry Sapoznik's Klezmer! Jewish Music from Old World to Our World does not live up to its promised title. Sapoznik is a well-known activist who has played a key role in the popularization of American-Yiddish popular music culture through his organization of the performing group Kapelye, the Yiddish Folk Arts Program ("KlezKamp," originally sponsored by the YIVO Institute for Jewish Re- search), and the Yiddish Radio Project, among others. This does not necessarily give him the requisite tools to produce an authoritative history of klezmorim and their music, however. The book may be divided into three sections. The first sec- tion (chap. 1) comprises a short history of klezmer music in Central and Eastern Europe-surprising in its brevity given the many centuries of development the klezmer tradition underwent on European soil before it was brought to the United States in the immigration wave beginning in the 1880s. Yet the subheading of Chapter 1, "The European Roots of Klezmer Music," shows its intentionally Amer- ican orientation, as if everything that happened before emigration were a kind of prehistory to the brief flowering the music now known as "klezmer" experienced in America. The second section (chaps. 2-5) covers American-Yiddish popular music-of which klezmer actually occupies/forms a small subsection-from the beginning of emigration until approximately 1960. The final section (chaps. 6-9) deals with the revival of interest in Yiddish and klezmer music since the mid- I 970s, focusing on the career and accomplishments of the author himself. 19.

"The Bobover, who do not have their own commemorative events for the Holocaust, have combined in a folk drama in Yiddish elements of Purim and Yom Kippur to create a ritual transcend- ing the Holocaust .... Through a series of inversions and reversals, from the frivolous to the serious and vice versa, the piremshpiyl provides them with the opportunity to confront and come to terms with the abyss, their own experience with the Holocaust" (Shifra Epstein, "The Bobover Hasidim Piremsh- piyl," in New World Hasidim.

Rubin The book contains numerous factual errors, and, more important, many his- torical misinterpretations, only a few of which can be pointed out here. These are exacerbated by its casual, journalistic patter, which makes it additionally difficult to accept Sapoznik as a reliable source. With regard to the flute and xylophone vir- tuoso Yosef-Michel Guzikov, for example, Sapoznik writes: "Having honed his parlor skills in the provinces he crashed the big time and, with the help of some sophisticated advance advertising perked up the otherwise dull 1836 Viennese summer season in which everyone who was anyone was elsewhere" (3). The "provinces" to which he appears to be referring are Cracow, Lemberg (Lviv), Kiev, and Odessa; the "sophisticated advance advertising" refers to an article in the Wiener Theaterzeitung by the theater critic and humorist Moritz Gottlieb Saphir. Contrary to the information on page 5, Guzikov did perform in Paris in the winter of 1836-1837, and he did not die-as the legend will have it-on the stage in Aachen, but several months later.22 By most accounts, Guzikov does not appear to have been the "friendly, deracinated Jew, amenable to the genteel" (3), but a hasid who traveled and resided with other orthodox Jews. His role as the leading klezmer in the Belorussion region of Mogilev is not mentioned, and the many questions re- garding the music he performed-which included many of the popular classical works of his day-and its relation, if any, to the klezmer tradition, are not raised. Sapoznik credits Guzikov with having "popularized" a "domesticated" form of klezmer music (5), yet the nature of his klezmer performance remains a mystery until today, as none of his instrumental klezmer compositions appear to have been notated or otherwise preserved. Sapoznik credits the influential violin teacher Leopold Auer with having helped Mischa Elman, Jascha Heifetz, and Efrem Zim- balist "make the transition from shtetl to stage" (25), despite the fact that Heifetz's birthplace was Vilna and Zimbalist's, Rostow-hardly justifying the use of the term shtetl. Even the section on Yiddish-American music, which is more familiar terri- tory for the author, is replete with errors. On page 31, the clarinetist Dave Tarras is credited with having arrived in the United States in 1923, whereas he arrived by his own account in 1921; the singer Sophie Tucker's given name was Abuza, not Kalish (35); the Dora Cherniavsky referred to on page 54 was named Lara Cher- niavsky; page 103 identifies the clarinetist Naftule Brandwein's birthplace as Prze- mysl, although he came from Przemyslany, a different town southeast of Lemberg in Austro-Hungarian East Galicia; the Jim Pankower mentioned on page 163 refers to the Bar-Ilan Tanakh professor and former saxophonist Jordan Penkower-to mention but a few. As well, the cellist, composer, and conductor Joseph Cherni- avsky (1894-1975)-who stemmed from one of the most important Ukrainian klezmer families, trained at the St. Petersburg and Leipzig conservatories, and was an important figure in the New York Yiddish theater and, later, in Hollywood-is reduced to being "a failed playwright" (110). Cherniavsky was reputed to be the grandson of the legendary Berdichev violinist Yosele Druker (1822-1879), who 22.

He thus incorporated in one person many of the diverse strands in the lives of klezmorim in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth cen- turies, from playing weddings in the Russian Ukraine to studying at a Czarist music academy, to writing, performing, and recording music for the Yiddish- American popular theater and vaudeville, to Hollywood. More disturbing than the numerous errors and misinterpretations is the us- age of unattributed quotes from unpublished interviews. For example, the quote of clarinetist Max Epstein on pages 119-20 ("I quit my job and bought myself a sax- ophone .. .") is taken virtually word-for-word from an interview I carried out with Epstein in Plantation, Florida on January 17, 1991; an interview with Dave Tarras from September 11, 1975 carried out by Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett and Janet Elias (Cassel) is quoted on several occasions (see, e.g., 113-114) and is either not properly attributed or cited as "interview with author, fall 1975" (306; only once, on page 303, is it properly cited); and quotes from an interview made by Peter Sokolow with the drummer Irving Gratz on April 4, 1988 are also not attributed (153). The autobiographic material, particularly in Chapters 6-9, is in the nature of a self-hagiography. Sapoznik's apparent need to have the klezmer revival move- ment center around his own person leads him to a most unfortunate revisionism. This is foreshadowed in the foreword, in which he claims: "what began as a per- sonal quest blossomed into an international movement" (ix), which leads the read- er to believe that his personal quest led to klezmer music becoming an international movement. Yet Sapoznik's first recordings from 1981 were predated by those of Giora Feidman (as early as 1971), the Berkeley group, The Klezmorim (1977; 1978), and Andy Statman and Zev Feldman (1979), as well as a documentary recording of Dave Tarras himself (1979), and were contemporaneous with the first recording by the Klezmer Conservatory Band. Despite having been contacted di- rectly by someone representing himself as Schirmer's fact checker, my own work documenting the music and career of Max Epstein has been changed to make it appear that I first met him in December 1991 at the YIVO and Sapoznik's KlezKamp: "After years of Sokolow's coaxing Max Epstein to come to KlezKamp, the veteran clarinetist finally attended as a teacher in 1991. There clarinetist Joel Rubin, also on staff, met Epstein for the first time .. ." (278). In fact, I had begun my fieldwork with Epstein one year earlier and independently of Sapoznik or KlezKamp. Similarly, the late Mira Rafalowicz is described as having founded Amsterdam's International Yiddish Festival after having attended KlezKamp for the first time in 1995. In fact, she founded the festival in 1991. 23.

Rubin While the kinds of inaccuracies and unsubstantiated opinions made here may be typical of Hollywood autobiographies, they have no place in a purported work of scholarship. It is therefore surprising that Schirmer Books allowed the book to be published in its present form, and all the more surprising that it received an award from the Association for Recorded Sound Collections in 2000. As very lit- tle original scholarship on klezmer music was published before the mid-1990s, it was possible for lay people and journalists to establish themselves and dominate the field up until that point. Sapoznik is at his best when treating the subjects closest to his heart, such as Yiddish-American recordings, radio broadcasts, and novelty numbers-all of which are actually peripheral to the central issue, that of klezmer musicians and their music-yet even here one questions whether the ba- sic facts are reliable. The accompanying CD of the same name contains no docu- mentation on the artists or discographical information; only the titles, years of is- sue, and the names of the artists are given. Most of the twenty-two pieces are culled from Sapoznik's other previously issued reissue recordings. Klezmer! Jewish Music from Old World to Our World is lacking in any of the methodologies current in Judaic studies, historiography, or ethnomusicology. Too many key works by such writers as Moshe Beregovski, Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gim- blett, and Mark Slobin24 are missing from the bibliography-to mention but three. In addition, Sapoznik's book contains little reflection regarding important ques- tions, such as why Guzikov was such an important figure in European concert life in the mid-1930s, what factors led to the Americanization of the traditional Jew- ish wedding and how that may have affected the musicians and their music, or what did the fact that Yiddish-American culture was "in a tail-spin" after World War II (154) mean for the American Jewish community. The misinformation in such a work has the potential to be recycled and passed on by other journalists and by scholars as well. This is the kind of journalistic mythologizing-which garbles facts and cannot differentiate fact from fiction-against which historians, Judaic studies scholars, ethnomusicologists, folklorists, and others will have to struggle in order to get to the core of the world and the music of the klezmorim.
