Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2000. xii, 416 pp. In The Sinner and the Amnesiac, Alan Goshen-Gottstein returns to the ques- tion of rabbinic biography with a comprehensive study of all traditions about Eli- sha ben Abuya, also known as Aher, "the Other." (One chapter is devoted to the few traditions of R. Eleazar b. Arakh, a sage who reportedly forgot all his knowl- edge of Torah.) Goshen-Gottstein also provides a thorough summary of the sec- ondary literature on Elisha, whom scholars variously have portrayed as a mystic, gnostic, apostate, philosophical atheist, and heretic. He appends a complete He- brew version of the main Bavli story of Elisha including all manuscript variants. This book is both frustrating and brilliant. It is frustrating because Goshen- Gottstein's ultimate goal is to probe behind the rabbinic traditions in order to re- cover the historical Elisha b. Abuya. Goshen-Gottstein is well aware of the contri- butions of Jacob Neusner, William Scott Green, Yonah Fraenkel, and others who have convincingly shown that rabbinic narratives are didactic tales better approached as fictional literature than history-he begins with a superb methodological in- troduction summarizing this scholarship and the current state of the question.' Nevertheless, Goshen-Gottstein examines each source in order to determine to what extent the historical kernel can be separated from literary, ideological and hermeneutical factors. Over and again, Goshen-Gottstein finds that very little his- tory can be recovered (pp. 47, 75, 132, 139, 177, 191, 198 etc.). He identifies but one or two authentic testimonies (pp. 38-39), which do not tell us much, and con- 1.

William Scott Green (Mis- soula, Montana: Scholars Press, 1978), pp. 77-96; Yonah Fraenkel, "Hermeneutic Problems in the Study of Aggadic Narrative," Tarbiz 47 (1978), pp. 139-172 (Hebrew). Readers should be aware that the reviewer is author of a study of Elisha ben Abuya: "Elisha ben Abuya: Torah and the Sinful Sage," Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy 7 (1998), pp. 141-222, revised and expanded in Talmudic Stories: Narrative Art, Composition, and Culture (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999), pp. 64-104. 117</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews cludes that the later traditions are completely unreliable: the Amoraic traditions "are devoid of historical worth" (p. 199). While this conclusion is surely correct, it is exactly what we would expect, and hardly warrants almost three hundred pages of analysis. Goshen-Gottstein tries to justify his project by arguing that Elisha b. Abuya was "outside the collective," hence "his teachings and tradition may there- fore not be shaped in accordance with collective concerns" (p. 13). But this ex- planation is insufficient. Why should traditions of outsiders be preserved more re- liably? If anything, we should assume the opposite-that storytellers could take more liberties in embellishing the stories of "outsiders" as their audience would be less likely to know the "truth," much as we find with Romans, Christians, and other non-rabbis. In any case, the current thinking is that to excavate rabbinic sto- ries for historical information in this way is to mistake the genre, and that the genre is the same regardless of whether the characters are leading sages or outsiders. In sum, Goshen-Gottstein's conclusion should have been his point of departure, and the literary analysis should have been pursued for its own sake, not to isolate the historical core. However, if Goshen-Gottstein beats a dead horse, it must be said that he beats it well. This book has value for anyone not absolutely convinced that the pur- suit of the historical or biographical kernel of rabbinic stories is futile. Goshen- Gottstein systematically treats each passage, cogently demonstrating how every twist and turn in the plot is motivated by other factors. He does not reject the his- toricity of stories on the grounds of general skepticism, or using simplistic argu- ments that the lack of possible verification renders historical conclusions inher- ently suspect. Here is a scholar aware of every methodological consideration, one who has mastered the secondary literature, who even attempts to develop new cri- teria by which the historicity of traditions can be evaluated (pp. 34-36)-and who nevertheless comes up empty-handed. For those already convinced of the futility of isolating a historical core, the repeated assessment after treating each passage that this source, too, yields no historical information is distracting. The book is brilliant because Goshen-Gottstein is an extremely sensitive reader. His careful analysis of the sources constitutes a major breakthrough in the scholarship on the Elisha traditions that all future scholars must take into account. Goshen-Gottstein shows, for example, that many of the Bavli and Yerushalmi sto- ries of Elisha (yHag 2:1, 77b-c; bHag 15a-b) are generated through exegesis of the "Pardes passage" of Tosefta Hagiga 2:3. Thus the Tosefta's cryptic statement that Elisha "cut the shoots" is interpreted by the Yerushalmi in terms of Elisha killing young students of Torah and by the Bavli as Elisha plucking the radish which he presents to the harlot (pp. 81-88, 93); the "mistake" and the "angel" mentioned in the verse applied to Elisha in the Tosefta (Eccles 5:5) generate Elisha's mistaken utterance before the angel Metatron in the Bavli (pp. 90-91); and so forth. Goshen-Gottstein has identified the motivation for the strange scenarios described in both Talmuds. It turns out that the Amorite storytellers were as perplexed by the Toseftan passage as modern readers and spun out their stories, in part, to interpret that tradition. Exegesis, not history, produces biography. Yet Goshen-Gottstein is not satisfied with an explanation of the origin of the stories' elements. He continues with extremely compelling literary analyses of the 118</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews stories as coherent wholes, always sensitive to the use of motifs, stock phrases, and common rabbinic themes. Goshen-Gottstein suggests that both stories address fun- damental problems of rabbinic ideology. The Bavli story wrestles with the ques- tion of sonship: can a Jew cease being considered one of God's children (bneiyis- rael) due to sin? The heavenly voice, "Return O backsliding children, except for Aher," excludes Elisha from this status. In the continuation of the story, how- ever, his merits accrued through Torah study and the efforts of his disciples save him from perdition. The main Yerushalmi story focuses on the identity of Elisha as a master of Torah by exploring his relationship with his disciple R. Meir. De- spite his sins and rejection by the voice heard from the Holy of Holies, Elisha retains this identity and R. Meir retains his obligations toward his master. Both sto- ries testify to the power and indestructible merit of Torah in the storytellers' ideology. These analyses are a delight, and replete with penetrating insights. They are essential reading for anyone interested in the workings of Talmudic narra- tives. The one weakness of the literary dimension of Goshen-Gottstein's work is the lack of perspective on the general narrative techniques of the Bavli and Yerushalmi (though there is copious and excellent use of parallels and thorough awareness of rabbinic forms). This leads to several errors, in my opinion, in Chap- ter Seven, which compares the versions of the two Talmuds and attempts to re- construct the history of the tradition. Goshen-Gottstein argues, for example, that the main Yerushalmi story postdates the Bavli's version. His evidence includes the observation that the heavenly voice appears twice in the Bavli story but only once in the Yerushalmi, which suggests that the Yerushalmi has conflated two voices into one, and therefore comes later (p. 208). A broader view of Bavli stories reveals that the Bavli frequently doubles an element of its source.2 This observation sug- gests rather that the Bavli is the later version and has duplicated an element of its source. Goshen-Gottstein also attributes the Bavli story to the students of R. Yohanan on the grounds that R. Yohanan appears in a favorable light in the Bavli, though not in the Yerushalmi (p. 215). However, R. Yohanan is a general hero of Bavli narratives and the protagonist of numerous (fictional) stories, and there is no evidence that these stories should be attributed to his students, at least not in their current forms. These conclusions are not persuasive without a broader view of narrative in both Talmuds. Goshen-Gottstein's concluding chapter, "Collective Torah culture and indi- vidual rabbinic biography," offers interesting and significant reflections on the na- ture of rabbinic biography (pp. 267-276). He points out that in collective works such as the Talmuds, the individuality of any sage tends to lose significance in re- lation to the ideological concerns of the group. Torah, the primary concern of the rabbis, is the true hero of rabbinic biographical tales. As with the midrashic re- casting of biblical figures, rabbinic storytellers freely used rabbinic figures to ex- press their own attitudes and ideological interests. And like midrash, rabbinic bi- ographical traditions are shaped by the continued exegesis of earlier stories in the face of changing ideological needs. In The Sinner and the Amnesiac, Goshen- 2.
