Westport, Conn.: Praeger, 1997. viii, 188 pp. Mark A. Raider. The Emergence ofAmerican Zionism. New York: New York University Press, 1998. xvii, 296 pp. Some years ago, when I was conducting research in the field of American Zionism, I had occasion to submit some essays I had written for possible publication in a number of important scholarly journals. At that time, one periodical contacted me, indicating that the editorial staff liked the research and inquiring whether I was a student of Ben Halpern's. I replied that I wasn't, but the whole incident made me chuckle. I realized that the discipline I was in was small enough to allow comparisons with its pioneer founder, and for that I was grateful. Actually, "pioneer founder" is the perfect approach one should take to the two books under discussion here, Rafael Medoff's Zionism and the Arabs: An American Jewish Dilemma, 1898-1948 and Mark Raider's The Emergence of American Zionism. To tell the truth, the field is still relatively small and select, so we welcome these two scholars. The questions they ask and answer really cut to the core of what diaspora Judaism is. and perhaps therein lies the importance of these monographs. Both historians make it clear that to be an American Zionist is not quite the same as being a European Zionist or a Palestinian/Israeli Zionist. The common denominator, AJS Review 24/1 (1999): 337-341 337</page><page sequence="2">338 STUART KNEE of course, is "Zionism," but its manifestation depends on the descriptive adjective preceding the term. Medoff and Raider caution that scholars had best pay attention to the distinctions, since the economic, political, and social well-being of the historic Yishuv depended upon an understanding of diverse constituencies and their motivations. Medoff presents us with a predicament faced by American Zionists during World War I and at the Paris Peace Conference: how does a people legitimize the concept of a return to a national homeland where, in terms of current population but not in terms of ancient history, desire, or need, the returning group is a numerical minority? Put another way, how does one realize a nineteenth-century national vision in a twentieth-century world? The opportunity presented itself at Versailles, and Zionists from all concerned regions prioritized different political and social models. For the Americans, a true national home would somehow conform to liberalism, which, for supporters of the Balfour Declaration, meant constitutions, the ballot box, competitive economic structures, and, in general, a commitment to the Western Enlightenment. Zionism, then, was an optimistic philosophy but possibly anachronistic even in 1919, given the realities of trench warfare, the Russian civil war, millions dead, and, in Palestine, a nascent Arab nationalism. While life's contradictions rarely fazed European Zionists resident in London, Kiev, or Minsk, Americans liked consistency. They really believed they could reconcile divergent Arab-Jewish attitudes in Palestine in a manner that would ultimately benefit both populations, and for a while they sought to do just this. It was a task for Don Quixote, but it needed to be done, not just for Zion, but for the sake of validating one's self-worth in the American milieu. As Medoff indicates, quite correctly, leading Zionists of the American Jewish establishment like Louis Brandeis, Julian Mack, Stephen Wise, and Henrietta Szold "were confronted with an identity crisis: how to balance traditional Jewish ideas . . . with the desire to gain acceptance in a country where conflicting values ... were an integral part of the ... political culture" (p. 5). So, while grappling with mentalities that appeared to be far distant from Arab-Jewish realities in the Middle East, American Zionists set themselves on a developmental path for 1920s Palestine that included experimentation with and implementation of certain Progressive economic and social beliefs. It was widely held that Arabs would end their opposition to the presence of the growing number of Jewish settlers if the latter demonstrated that they were there to serve and not diminish humanity. And serve they did, by creating the Hebrew University, the Hadassah Medical Organization, and a host of</page><page sequence="3">PRAGMATIC IDEALISTS: ZIONISM IN AMERICA 339 enterprises designed to be both attractive and utilitarian. Maybe all this would allay Arab fears, so that opponents of Jewish settlement would cease to take a sanguinary path, as they had done on Easter Sunday, 1920, and at Jaffa the following year. But there were two realities American Zionists could not alter: first, that Jewish settlers were still a minority and would probably continue to be in the foreseeable future; second, that traditional, liberal, democratic panaceas would not prevent opposition to Zionism, because Arab hostility was rooted in millennial religio-political competition "that economic progress could not change" (p. 43). "Jobs and an increased standard of living" (p. 43) were gifts tendered to Arabs by Americans who knew they were playing for time in which to build a majoritarian democracy, but time ran out in the Hitler era as conciliation gave way to Realpolitik. Zionists continued to debate the merits of hiring all labor equally, including Arab, flirted with binationalism, and hosted eminent historians with informed points of view, among them Salo Baron, Hans Kohn, and Oscar Janowsky. In the end, however, the proposed solution of Arab population transfers to Iraq or Transjordan seemed compelling, especially when millions of Jewish lives were at risk. Although the transfer idea failed, the Medoff book demonstrates Amer- ican Jewish pragmatism in the face of insoluble difficulties. Understanding American Jews as pragmatists in the tradition of William James is also the key theme of Mark Raider, who attempts, with much success, to place Labor Zionism at the heart of American Jewish comprehension of self. Raider is an effective narrator and, like Medoff, employs a wide variety of archival, monographic, and periodical sources. But he need not be so insistent about his theme, which sometimes becomes a chant, that Labor Zionism had a salubrious, even transforming, effect on American Zionism and American Judaism. It is a point well taken and recognized by major historians such as Walter Laqueur and Howard M. Sachar. Whether Labor Zionists in America and Palestine lacked Zionist "star quality" is important to Raider, since the American Zionist "titans" (p. 171) have garnered more historical notoriety than their less glamorous compatriots. Not to worry: persuasive ideas and magnetic spokespersons are equally important; sometimes, the more magnetic the spokesperson, the better for the ideas! Labor Zionism's focus was nonideological and nondoctrinaire; it held to certain ecumenical principles but entertained no particular dogma. In short, one could be a Labor Zionist and also be either Marxist or anti-Marxist; by the same token, one could hold with communal or collective labor,</page><page sequence="4">340 STUART KNEE traditional private enterprise, or a combination of the two. There were only two principles that bound the Labor Zionists, both of which are beautifully captured in Raider's chapter 3 pictorial: first, a belief in the legitimacy of "the worker," and second, that Jews should emigrate to and settle in Palestine. The major strength of Labor Zionism lay in an adaptability that rendered the movement entirely amenable to American cultural cues. At its American inception in the 1880s, its direction seemed hard to predict, since its Eastern European component was steering and shaping it. However, its role in the formation of the American Jewish Congress in 1918, the compelling nature of the Ahad Ha'am cultural philosophy as projected by Horace Kallen, and the entry of interpretive Hebrew-language materials into school curricula dispelled any public doubts as to the direction in which Labor Zionism was headed. The founding of Pioneer Women as an alternative to Hadassah and the National Council of Jewish Women, and the location of common ground with Jewish and mainstream American labor unions indicated an American approach to constructing a Zionist consensus. By the mid-1930s, the Labor Zionist version of the halutz, or "pioneer," was successfully conveyed to cognizant American Jews. It was not a moment too soon, since fascism, international antisemitism, immigration restrictions, and quota laws created immediate needs for potential and actual refugees of persecution. The movement itself, very much like European Jews themselves, was at a crossroads. A misstep for America Labor Zionists in the interpretation of an heroic Jewish future wouldn't mean much to them personally, since they, as the saying goes, would live to fight another day. On the other hand, there were millions whose survival might be compromised if the fundamental notion of the "ideal" Jewish worker was not refashioned and expanded. It was, and its tangible expression manifested itself in the 1942 Biltmore Program. The worker for Palestine and his labor were valued as they had always been. Both were central to Labor Zionism's ideology, but as everyone at the Biltmore Hotel knew, the image of the worker was under renovation. At this time, it probably would not include young Americans even if they danced, sang, spoke some Hebrew, subscribed to the Jewish Frontier, sat around bonfires in brotherhood, and joined Habonim. Youth in the United States needed direction but not a ticket out: their lives would continue in safety, thus excluding them from massive aliyah. As for the millions caught in Europe, they might one day arrive in Palestine, but the overwhelming majority of them were not in love with and barely understood Zionism's call to the "hearty worker" and "free, yeoman farmer." In a timely fashion, over</page><page sequence="5">PRAGMATIC IDEALISTS: ZIONISM IN AMERICA 341 the course of a decade and more preceding World War II, a suitable image had been forged inclusive of refugees. Zionists in general had learned from Labor Zionists in particular that Jewish survival depended upon optimistic propaganda that could accommodate unanticipated arrivals in the present as well as it had accommodated smaller, more ideologically committed groups in the past. Since Zionism was never a majoritarian movement in the United States and, as a matter of fact, would best be described as winning the hearts and minds of a minuscule proportion of America's Jews prior to 1948, what is the purpose of the books written by Medoff and Raider, which emphasize the pre-state era? All they seem to do is perpetuate the angst of a few within an impressive ethnic population. Perhaps the answer is part of a larger truth: that in troubled times, a socially conscious, activist, flexible minority, or more correctly a minority within a minority, shaped the course of Jewish history and, indeed, may do so again as the century turns.
