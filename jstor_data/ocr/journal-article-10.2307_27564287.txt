<plain_text><page sequence="1">CWlBk Coming in July 2007... The Origins of Judaism From Canaan to the Rise of Islam Robert Goldenberg The Origins of Judaism provides a clear, straightforward account of the development of ancient Judaism in both the Judean homeland and the Diaspora. Beginning with the Bible and ending with the rise of Islam, the text depicts the emergence of a religion that would be recognized today as Judaism, from customs and conceptions quite different from any that now exist. Special attention is given to the early rabbis' contribution to this histori cal process. Together with the main narrative, the book provides substantial quotations from primary texts (biblical, rabbinic and other) along with extended treatments of important themes, a glossary, short biographies of leading early rabbis, a chronology of important dates and suggestions for further reading. $70.00*: Hb: 978-0-521-60628-8: c.310 pp. $22.99*: Pb: 978-0-521-84453-6 Prices subject to change. www.cambridge.org/us I 1-800-872-7423 Cambridge UNIVERSITY PRESS</page><page sequence="2">Cambridge CAMBRIDGE COMPANIONS coming in Spring...
