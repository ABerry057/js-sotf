<plain_text><page sequence="1">Leonard Dinnerstein. Antisemitism in America. New York: Oxford University Press, 1994. xxviii, 369 pp. As we reach the final years of this century, some historians of American Judaism involve themselves in issues of ethnic reevaluation, contextualization, and closure. Of course, this sort of writing has been done before, and it is likely that it will be done again, but somehow there is a greater urgency to ask a certain question-"Is it safe now?-five years before the turn of a millennium. How do Jews get along with Christians generally and Protestants particularly? Are relations likely to change? Is history a resource which, if properly employed, enlightens laypeople and scholars as to trends and patterns? What promise does such study hold for the future? Is it possible that swords will be beaten into plowshares, or is the world much less dramatic? It could be that Leonard Dinnerstein is on the right track when he observes in the prologue to Antisemitism in America that "ancestral Christian obsessions with Jews ... have. .. become an irrevocable part of the American heritage" (p. xxviii), but he is really more sanguine than this quotation would indicate. He feels that antisemitism is currently at a low ebb and, with no center or focus, is probably going to decline even further. Actually, Antisemitism in America reminds me of two books on similar themes which have been published recently, Egal Feldman's Dual Destinies: The Jewish Encounter with Protestant America (Urbana, Ill., 1990), and Frederic Cople Jaher's A Scapegoat in the New Wilderness: The Origin and Rise of Antisemitism in America (Cambridge, Mass., 1994). But Dinnerstein extends Jaher's story and takes Feldman's in a somewhat altered direction, and therein lies the difference. He places most weight on postbellum America, a correct emphasis, I think, since there were only 150,000 Jews in the United States before the Civil War. Although an authentic Jewish "culture" did not exist in 1860, Jews kept a low political and social profile anyway. Nevertheless, a tendency persisted among Protestants to missionize and portray mythic, unpalatable Jews in their literature. Seemingly good relations</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 205 between Christians and Jews were a product, then, of the Jewish minority's willingness to submerge rather than the host culture's commitment to its revolutionary rhetoric. Economic stereotypes of the Jew as profiteer and Shylock achieved greater currency after the Civil War, as a history of political exclusion shifted into the social sphere during the Gilded Age and the Progressive period. This shift was facilitated by tensions wrought of consolidation, the rise of labor unionism, strikes, urban crises, and an overwhelming immigrant flow from the Mediterranean and Eastern Europe. Racism and antisemitism grew apace as Victorian leaders in Washington proved unequal to the reformist task; urban managers on the order of Theodore Roosevelt perpetuated racism by ignoring issues of prejudice, believing the latter would dissipate once stability and security replaced chaos in the American business community. But that was not to be. Two world wars, the Red Scare, the McCarthy era, a driving conformity extant as an undercurrent in American culture, and even the Holocaust erected formidable barriers blocking interethnic understanding. At first, the Jewish response to Catholic animosity and the "Old Stock Panic" of the interwar period was tepid, much like that of the NAACP. One might even contend, with much justification, that under the leadership of Louis Marshall, the American Jewish Committee, American Jewry's key organization, involved itself only in winnable litigation. Antisemitism peaked between 1938 and 1945, as isolationists, fundamentalists, political extrem- ists, and racists combined with notable and respected liberals to underplay genocide and misinterpret historic American values. Dinnerstein's treatment of this period might have benefited from the inclusion of Robert Abzug's excellent study Inside the Vicious Heart: Americans and the Liberation of Nazi Concentration Camps (New York, 1985). With certain notable exceptions, anti-Jewish prejudice has steadily de- clined in the past fifty years. Postwar prosperity, a desire for Americans to dissociate themselves from Nazi atrocities, and a general revulsion at past racist policies may be good reasons for the decline, but a better one, according to the author, was the establishment of effective ethnic defense agencies which eventually delegitimized prejudice among American policymakers and the American public. Only among black Americans has antisemitism increased, and their story provides Dinnerstein with an opportunity to revise and better understand a long record of strained relations and ambivalent contacts. Evidence is brought to bear from 1830-1992 that black antipathy toward Jews has been endemic. Since the Age of Jackson, blacks absorbed the</page><page sequence="3">206 BOOK REVIEWS religious and cultural stereotypes of a host culture that either enslaved or demeaned them; when Jewish aid was proffered-and it has been consid- erable-blacks interpreted the generosity as tainted by paternalism; finally, there may be a desire among blacks, as a vulnerable ethnic group, to hurt white Christians vicariously, through an acceptable channel, without fear of recrimination. In any event, this situation is not likely to change, despite the more positive visions of Jesse Jackson, Henry Lewis Gates, and Cornel West. Dinnerstein's bibliography is comprehensive but might be improved, especially for the South, by the inclusion of Eli Evans's Judah P. Benjamin: The Jewish Confederate (New York, 1988) and James Hagy's This Happy Land: The Jews of Colonial and Antebellum Charleston (Tuscaloosa, Ala., 1993). Also, minor errors of fact and typos galore-I counted a dozen at random-were annoying and distracting. Haymarket occurred in 1886, not 1885 (p. 43), Forward is misspelled on p. 63 but corrected on p. 95; on p. 98, 11,000 has one zero too many, and on p. 199, "warriors" has one s too few. Both author and publisher should pay closer attention to presentation in subsequent editions of Antisenitism in America. Stuart E. Knee University of Charleston Charleston, S.C.</page></plain_text>
