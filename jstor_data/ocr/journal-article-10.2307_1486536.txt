Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996. xiv, 158 pp. This is a fascinating excursus into memory, ethnography, and the flow of interactive time and space. Jodlle Bahloul has written extensively in French about culture and symbolism among Algerian Jews in France. This study is largely a translation of La maison de memoire, first published in 1992, with some new material. The author, a cultural anthropologist, attempts to convey something of the existence of an Algerian "household"--a two-story dwelling with many apartments surrounding a courtyard: the downstairs inhabited by Muslims, and the upstairs by Jews--prior to Jewish emigration in 1962. Because the household is remembered in two cultures by two long-separated populations with overlapping yet distinctive views of their earlier coexistence, Bahloul appropriately proposes to use the opportunity to explore the contextualization of memory as well as the culture-histories they produce. The strengths of this study are readily apparent. The narrative is well written and quite engaging. The focus is unusual, i.e., a kind of diachronic ethnography of a complex household (Dar-Refayil) of Jews and Muslims in the Algerian town of Setif. According to the author, the joint Jewish-Muslim housing complex was not unusual, but to date very little has been written about it. Data-collection relied heavily on interviews-reconstructing a time and location far removed from most informants--participation, and observation in the remnants of Dar-Refayil group culture, i.e., of the author's family, still</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 161 alive, and finally, observation at the subject site of discussion and interviews of its present-day inhabitants. Throughout the description and narrative are interpretations; this an unabashedly interpretive ethnography, rich in symbolism and insight into the thought processes producing the behavior analyzed. The elegance and real beauty of the work is specially marked, sometimes reading as if the narrative were poetry, a text lending itself to myriad interpretations. This is, however, also a source of potential difficulty. Whose interpreta- tions are we being exposed to? Do they belong to the informants, or are they those of the researcher? Bahloul often fails to clue the reader as to the source of the interpretations. She seems intertwined with her informants, presenting interpretations that are confident and assured, but rarely attributed. Justifi- cation and/or supporting evidence for the interpretations are not generally given. The primary focus is the Senoussi family, in transition from a traditional Jewish past to a modem French future. The period described is 1937-1962, and Setif's Jews are striving for acceptance by the French, who viewed them as "indigenous" and, during World War II, seemed in sympathy with the Nazi inclination to eliminate them. Jews were actually far closer to their Arab neighbors, but while sympathizing with the latter's nationalist sentiments, they identified themselves as French or with their own ethnic nationalism, Zionism. How personal and political events affected the residents of Dar-Refayil is thoroughly examined, but much of the basic ethnography of Setif Jewry is sadly overlooked. There is little sense of what goes on outside the house complex. What is the neighborhood about? How is the Jewish community organized? What livelihoods did Jews depend on? What was their standard of living overall in comparison with non-Jews? Bahloul tells us a bit about religious ceremonies, such as Bar Mitzvah, but what Judaism meant to S6tif Jewry generally, and Dar-Refayil in particular, is largely unexplored. Men and women went to synagogue, but how often, why, and what did they do there? Family relationships within the household are scrutinized, but without much reference to broader kinship networks. Women's lives and concerns are amply discussed, but deliberation about men's lives is sterile by comparison. Photographs would have helped measurably in binding the description and analysis. Dar-Refayil and its inhabitants are the organizing framework of this study, so do not expect a broad, rich ethnography of Algerian Jewry here. Bahloul's</page><page sequence="3">162 BOOK REVIEWS study views a microcosm of Algerian Jewish life, and is very personalized and subjective. Possible shortcomings due to microscale, breadth limitations, and unexplained interpretative comments are compensated for by the intimacy of the narrative she presents, compelling the reader to engage with the personalities and situations described. As a result of the reflexive style, the author's motives and dilemmas in writing this study combine well with lasting impressions about the waning years of Jewish community life in Algeria. In the concluding chapter, the author visits the recent efforts of Jewish scholars to explore social memory. Bahloul uses the results of her study to make a good case for exploring such memories not as timeless entities, but as tightly connected to incidents and events within a framed spatial context. In this case, the domestic sphere evokes a warm symbolic glow that tightly binds the present society to a past that is estranged in location as well as in time. Bahloul finally opines that "memory establishes an operative link between the practice of the social order and its symbolic representation" (p. 136). Laurence D.
