Vol. 3, 925 pp.; vol. 4, 952 pp. Jacob Rader Marcus, the author of more than a dozen books on American and European Jewish history, began writing in 1916, and many of his works have become indispensable classics. No student of early American Jewish history can neglect, for example, Marcus's three-volume The Colonial American Jew (1970), his two-volume Early American Jews (1951-55), or</page><page sequence="2">442 BOOK REVIEWS his Studies in American Jewish History (1969). For more than three-quarters of a century, Marcus has been an outstanding teacher and scholar. And now, with volumes 3 and 4 of United States Jewr); 1776-1985, this prodigious and apparently inexhaustible pioneer in American Jewish studies has completed an outstanding history of the Jewish experience in America. The promise of the first two volumes has been fulfilled: the set, encyclopedic in scope, is undoubtedly the most comprehensive account of the Jewish people in the United States written by a single author. Employing a wide variety of sources, from largely unused primary materials (many in his own considerable collection) to research papers done by students at Hebrew Union College, Marcus focuses on the cultural, political, and economic life of Jewish Americans from 1860 to 1920, with an extended epilogue for the period 1921-1985. And although one of the author's central conclusions continues to be that the Jews in the United States eventually relinquished traditional Judaism-though not Jewishness-much of his attention, again with telling effect, is devoted to religious behavior and institutions. Throughout, Marcus demonstrates that Jewish immigrants, whether "German" or "Russian," acculturated rapidly, but often on their own terms. They became Americans and made important contributions to American life, but they retained and reshaped their distinctive Jewish and even Judaic characteristics. In short, Marcus argues convincingly, Jews and Judaism changed, but they did not "melt." Despite the seemingly contrary fact that currently no more than 40 percent of Jewish Americans are synagogue members, Marcus insists that well more than half, perhaps as many as 75 percent, continue to identify with one or another of the four Jewish religious denominations. And de- spite his own evidence on the general decline of the synagogue-centered community throughout American history, Marcus, ignoring or dismissing the work of Jonathan Woocher, goes so far as to say that the "synagog [sic] is still more important than the charity federation" (vol. 4, p. 782), and is perhaps still the most important institution in Jewish American life.' Marcus, uncharacteristically, is not entirely persuasive here, partly because a great deal of his own impressive evidence in many sections, including 1. Jonathan Woocher, Sacred Survival (Bloomington, Ind., 1986), provides good evidence for his conclusion that the philanthropic federation movement is the most important defining element of the "civil religion" of the American Jewish community.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 443 "Americanization," "Zionism," "Socialism and the Jew," and "Jews and Culture," strongly suggests that large numbers of Jewish Americans have for a long time defined themselves as Jews through philanthropic endeavors, social and political liberalism, and concern for Israel, and not through active participation in synagogues. In his discussions of the denominations Marcus also misses some recent developments-the growing God imagery and mysticism, for example, within the Reconstructionist movement, which, until the last decade or so, heavily emphasized rationalism and completely rejected supernaturalism, and, for another, a new burst of growth in Orthodoxy and neo-Orthodoxy, including the return to the traditional fold of increasing numbers of women.2 He does, however, write clearly, concisely, and even-handedly about the varieties of Judaism, and using the indexes of all four volumes, one could get a very fine introduction to the history and current nature of Judaism's respective branches. After reading these volumes, one also gets a sense, clearly intended by the author, that America has not destroyed the possibilities for a Jewish religion here, but instead has given birth to a "new Judaism," and will again. It is in these volumes, too, that Marcus pays great attention to the arrival of the Eastern European Jews, and to their achievement of hegemony in the American Jewish community. He recognizes that the integration of the "Russians" was made easier by the presence of a small but fairly well established German-Jewish elite, and unlike some practitioners in the field of American Jewish history, including Sherry Gorelick and Selma Berrol, he recognizes that many activities of the Germans, although part of patrician philanthropy, somehow went beyond mere charity, even if never reaching Gemiltlichkeit.3 Marcus does, however, overstate part of the conventional interpretation when he writes that, "Despite the ongoing Americanization of 2.

The class position of many "established" German Jews was different from that of many arriving Eastern European Jews; but it is also true, as historian Hasia Diner has demonstrated, that many of the people who made up American Jewry on the eve of the great exodus from Eastern Europe had only been in the United States anywhere from five years to fifty years, thus representing many stages of the process of mobility and "Americanization." Moreover, like their Eastern European counterparts after them, the German Jews, too, started out near the bottom of the economic and social hierarchy. The Germans also mirrored the future behavior and values of their Russian coreligionists in retaining, even as they transformed, a distinctive, ethnically Jewish culture. And both groups viewed themselves as bound up in a common global history.4 Throughout Marcus makes it clear that the integration of both the Eastern European Jews and the German Jews was facilitated by important confluences of Jewish and American values and institutions. The liberal values of the modern democratic republic, themselves partly founded on biblical precepts, meshed well with the Hebraic tradition of covenant and the prophetic emphasis on the pursuit of justice; the American idea of progress was compatible with the Jewish injunction to repair and perfect the world in an ongoing partnership with God; and the rational, secular American pursuit of individual happiness within an orderly community complemented modern Jewish this-worldliness and aspiration for personal achievement and communal fulfillment. Integration was also made easier by the absence of a virulent antisemitism. American liberal constitutionalism protected Jews. So did the separation of church and state. So did the fact that America, in Tocqueville's phrase, having been "born free," escaped the wounds and embittered memories of emancipation politics that so marked Europe. Jews were protected too by the presence of other targets of animosity, blacks and Catholics, for example. There were, however, a significant number of antisemitic incidents in American history from 1860 to 1945. Marcus unmitigated paternalists who persistently tried to remake their embarrassing Russian "cousins" by muting their Orthodoxy, their Yiddish, and their socialism. 4. Hasia Diner, "A Time for Gathering: The Second Migration," American Jewish History 81, no. 1 (Autumn 1993): 22-33.</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 445 adroitly reviews these episodes without making the mistake of equating them to Europe's persistently violent and state-sponsored persecutions of Jews, persuasively demonstrating once again that as far as the children of Israel are concerned, "America is different." There are, however, a number of minor problems in the sections on antisemitism. The Leo Frank affair (1913-1915), for example, is treated prior to the Joseph Seligman incident (1877), and both are discussed as if they could be conflated, or analyzed in the same category. The snub of Seligman at the Grand Union Hotel in Saratoga, New York, was an example of the social discrimination German Jews suffered in the post-Civil War scramble for status in mobile America. Leo Frank, on the other hand, was unjustly and wrongly convicted of murder, and later lynched. Moreover, though both cases involved class resentments, these resentments came from different directions. Seligman, not atypically, was rebuffed from above; Frank, portentously, was killed from below. Also, Marcus's description of the 1890s Populists as "not specifically anti-Semitic" (vol. 3, p. 165) suggests that he is either unfamiliar with or discounts the work of Irwin Unger, Naomi Cohen, and Leonard Dinnerstein.5 While most Populists were not antisemites, several important representative figures like Tom Watson and Ignatius Donnelly clearly disliked foreigners and Jews. Moreover, although antisemitic stereotypes portraying Jews as "non-producers," mere manipulators of money, and sinister representatives of international finance had circulated in the United States well before the turn of the century and the rise of the Populist Party, Populist political rhetoric resembled those stereotypes very closely. And it is good to remember Richard Hofstadter's point that although "it would be easy to misstate the character of Populist anti-Semitism . . . the Greenback-Populist tradition activated most of what we have of modern popular anti-Semitism in the United States."6 Ultimately, however, Marcus, in his usual forceful and persuasive style, makes the case that antisemitism was never a real menace to the well-being of the Jewish masses in the United States. 5.

In fact American pluralism, which was partly shaped by Jewish thinkers, including Horace Kallen and Louis Brandeis, came to imply a positive obligation on the part of groups to participate fully in society so that society might derive benefit from their diverse contributions. And indeed, as Marcus demonstrates so brilliantly throughout these volumes, Jews and America did enrich each other. As important, the Jews in the period from 1860 to 1920 nurtured a linkage between American and Jewish ideals and identities. The synthesis, in all its varieties, was powerful; its accomplishments in culture (literature, journalism, film, and music, for example) and social thought and action (law, democratic socialism, cultural pluralism, and philanthropy, for example) reverberated not only in the second generation but, as Marcus's epilogue for the period 1921-1985 shows, even into the late twentieth century, continuing to inform American as well as Jewish American values. While Marcus also shows that "most American Jews . . maintain ... some relationship to their people and their faith" (vol. 4, p. 810), he does not show, curiously, that the Jewish community is shrinking, and that its leaders are fretful. Intermarriage (approximately 52 percent in the early 1990s) and its consequences are mentioned only cursorily in volume 3, and only up to 1912, and not at all in volume 4. Attention to this subject would have challenged Marcus's conclusion that the Jewish American "faces the future with trust, with confidence, with dogged faith" (vol. 4, p. 812). It is refreshing to watch Marcus identify those facets of context, behavior, and value that strengthen identification with Jews and Judaism, but it is difficult to avoid the sense that he is overly optimistic. The four volumes, constituting more than 2,500 pages, eighty-two chap- ters, and uncountable subheadings in chapters, are not quite designed for reading from cover to cover. But the texts, together with their 270 pages of bibliography and notes, are very valuable reference tools. They constitute a stunning, extraordinary achievement. And the ninety-seven-year-old Marcus, unflagging in his dedication to work, his students, and his reading public, is now in the process of compressing all of this into a manageable single volume. The grand stature of Marcus, scholar, teacher, and the founder and director of the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati for fifty years, is widely recognized.
