<plain_text><page sequence="1">Alan L. Mittleman. The Politics of Torah: The Jewish Political Tradition and the Founding ofAgudat Israel. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1996. 200 pp. The political history of modem Israel and its antecedents in premodem Judaism remains a vibrant part of the broad scholarly interest in modem Judaism. Its continued relevance may be due in large part to the ever changing nature and fabric of contemporary Israel both vis-a-vis the world and, more interestingly, vis-a-vis itself. Alan Mittleman's The Politics of Torah traces the cultural, political, and ideological origins of Agudat Israel, one of the more intricate and fascinating chapters of modem Jewish political theory. As Mittleman consistently and correctly points out, the phenomenon of Agudat Israel extends far beyond the spectrum of politics; it reflects a profound struggle between tradition and modernity presented as a counterideology to conventional Zionism and the quickly acculturating trend in German Orthodoxy in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Mittleman's study of Agudat Israel is an important contribution to the more general study of modem Jewish political theory for various reasons. First, his introductory chapter presents a useful methodological framework in which he proceeds to discuss his topic. He does not fall prey to the general academic tendency to overtheorize, nor does he succumb to the commonplace</page><page sequence="2">316 BOOK REVIEWS tendency in Jewish Studies to work within a complex methodological system without explicitly tracing its roots. Emile Durkheim and Max Weber are as present in the body of the text (and not just the footnotes) as are Leo Strauss and Samuel Eisenstadt. Hence, the introductory chapter does not address the subject so much as introduce the reader to the way in which the author will proceed to do his work. In many ways, the introduction reflects the classical genre of hakdamot literature where the legalist or philosopher will state his purpose and method before addressing substance. Mittleman then proceeds to survey traditional notions of political theory from Maimonides to Spinoza, concluding with a fresh and insightful comparative analysis of Leo Strauss's political writings, Samuel Eisenstadt's Continuity and Polity, and David Biale's Power and Powerlessness, all of which enables him to proceed to analyze the emergence, impact, and influence of Agudat Israel in the twentieth century, a subject which is not the focus of the other studies mentioned. The reader will find it difficult to categorize Mittleman's essay. Is it cultural and political history? The history of ideas? Jewish sociology? In fact, the essay is none of the above and all of the above, which makes it a pleasure to read. Mittleman weaves a very careful historical analysis without ever abandoning the larger questions he raises in the introduction and his first two survey chapters. Therefore, the initial impatience one may feel when reading the first part of the book (the introduction, chaps. 1 and 2) is not an indication of the tangential nature of his historical survey but only the result of Mittleman's commitment to the elucidation of theory as an important if not essential academic exercise. One of the more striking dimensions of Mittleman's essay is the way in which he presents the severe and largely irreparable distinctions between the exponents of Western Orthodoxy, Samson Raphael Hirsch, Solomon Breuer (whose thought was primarily expressed through the work of his son Isaac Breuer), and Jacob Rosenheim (the true founder of Agudat Israel in Germany), and their Eastern European counterparts in Poland and Hungary, most of whom had little patience with the German call for a Politics of Torah. Mittleman exhibits the extent to which it was the German modernist program of Breuer and Rosenheim and not the ultra-Orthodox agenda of Eastern European ideologues which served as the backbone of the Agudah at its inception. The Politics of Torah program, an alternative but not unequivocal rejection of Zionism, had no real foundation in the ultra-traditionalist communities of Poland and Hungary. This point is particularly significant in light of the fact that the second half of the twentieth century has witnessed the eclipse of</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 317 the German branch of Agudat Israel in the shadow of its Eastern European counterpart. As Mittleman convincingly argues, however, Agudat Israel, which began almost simultaneously in Poland and Germany, was an important bridge between these two worlds in their valiant attempt to ward off the heretical challenge of political and cultural Zionism in the first decades of the twentieth century. The fact that the German and Eastern European participants had radically different agendas is an important point which Mittleman develops in various ways. The Kattowitz Conference (October 1911 to May 1912) served as the womb in which East and West joined arms, however reluctantly, to birth Agudat Israel. Mittleman sums up the tension and ambiguity well when he says, "While Eastern Jews sought to ward off modernity, even at the cost of grasping a double-edged sword, the German Jews sought to recover from modernity the Jewishness they had lost through a century of adaptations. They wanted to move beyond a synthesis of Judaism and modernity into a totalistic assertion of Jewish being" (p. 18). Mittleman's point is that the German and Polish Jews worked together to found and develop Agudat Israel, but the two communities had separate agendas which made the relationship tenuous at best. This phenomenon was further problematized by the ultra-Orthodox Hungarian contingent, some of whom reluctantly joined so as not to be entirely excluded from the innovative political process. Another important part of this historical analysis is the way in which Mittleman traces the development of the separatist Frankfurt community begun by Hirsch into an Erez Yisrael-based ideology by Hirsch's son-in- law Isaac Breuer. In this regard The Politics of Torah is an addendum to Mittleman's book on Isaac Breuer, Between Kant and Kabbalah (Albany, N.Y., 1990). He would have benefited readers by more explicitly integrating his earlier study with the present one. Many of the more theoretical discussions on Breuer's thought are relevant to the Politics of Torah ideology developed here. In any event, the shift from Orthodox autonomy (Hirsch/Frankfurt) to Erez Yisrael separatism (Tel Aviv/Breuer) was pivotal in that it made Agudat Israel an anti-Zionistic Zionism, the consequences of which we are now seeing as the century draws to a close. Alan Mittleman's The Politics of Torah is an important, useful, and readable essay in the history of modem Judaism. His research is thorough, his methodological position well argued, and his findings are both informative and substantive. I only wish he had been willing to draw more daring</page><page sequence="4">318 BOOK REVIEWS conclusions from his research, conclusions which, I believe, are embedded in his essay but can only be brought to the surface by a careful and thoughtful reader.
