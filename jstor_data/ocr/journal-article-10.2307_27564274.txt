Ramat-Gan: Bar-Ilan University Press, 2005. 653 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000360 This volume is a sequel to Yaakov Shmuel Spiegel's earlier study, Chapters in the History of the Jewish Book: Scholars and Their Annotations (1996; here after Chapters I), also published by Bar-Ilan University Press. Like its predeces sor, the current volume, Chapters in the History of the Jewish Book: Writing and Transmission (hereafter Chapters IT), is slightly mistitled. Spiegel's purview is properly the "rabbinic-halakhic" book, and indeed, the vast majority of the works discussed here are authored by rabbinic intellectuals writing broadly on 190</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews issues of halakhic import in their capacity as communal spokespersons or leaders from the tenth to the sixteenth century. The major exceptions?treatments of the scribal shaping of the biblical canon (16-24, for which the author adduces the Mosaic writing of the Covenant Tablets and the first Sefer Torah as the earliest evidence) and the early rabbinic classics (e.g., the Mishnah; see 482-97)?are included here insofar as the medieval transmission of these works as literary arti facts draws them within the larger arc of medieval rabbinic literary-cultural history despite their Second Temple or pre-Islamic literary genealogies. Indeed, at least from the perspective of chronological scope, Chapters II is a kind of "prequel" to its predecessor. Chapters I tracked the practice of textual emendation and its transformation from the age of the manuscript until well into the age of print. The more recent volume, by contrast, focuses almost entirely on the composition and textual dissemination of the halakhically oriented book in the rabbinic chirographic cultures of medieval Ashkenaz and Sefarad. Relatively little is said about the transformations that the technology of the press introduced into these processes of composition and distribution of the finished book during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Although the occasional philosophic or speculative work makes an appearance in these pages (e.g., a solitary reference to the Zohar in the context of a broader discussion of the medieval convention of incorporating an author's name into a work's title; see 406 n. 104), the primary focus is halakhic lit erature in the form of digests, codes, commentaries, and responsa, with special atten tion devoted to codicological and literary-historical matters pursuant to the latter in particular (228-306). All this is simply to stress that before us is not a "history of the Jewish book" in the middle ages (which might include a literary history of the enigmatic Sefer Yezirah), nor even a "history of medieval rabbinic books" (which might have qua lified bona fide rabbinic classics such as the Zohar for extended discussion), but a "history of medieval halakhic books." This is itself, as Spiegel amply demon strates, a fascinating topic on which he effortlessly, and with impressive literary style, fills out more than 600 pages of his narrative. A gracious review?which this fully intends to be?should not criticize what an author does not claim to do but rather should assess the work in light of the author's own intentions. There fore, I am delighted to admit that within the limits set by the author, the present study must be regarded as a definitive?if not culminating?contribution to the technical history of the composition, transmission, and criticism of the elite literary tradition of medieval and early modem halakhic literature. Spiegel's strategy is to focus on the process of a book's composition as it passes through a number of crucial milestones: several revisions by the author toward the creation of the author's autograph copy; the processes of copying and dissemination that constituted "publication" in the chirographic era; the cri teria by which various "revised editions" were produced; and the role of disciples as editors-cww-authors in the circulation of books after authors' deaths. Attention is also drawn to such often-overlooked matters as the role of authors' signatures in authenticating copies; the conventions for including (or suppressing) authors' names in the titles of works; methods of organizing literary material by theme, topic, or literary form; the logic of internal divisions into chapters and subunits; 191</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews and the provision of materials, such as tables of contents and indexes, designed as interpretive guides. Spiegel's method is scrupulously empirical, and this accounts in large measure for both the size of the volume and its genuine interest. The author is a master of the stray detail, providing extensive quotations from medieval authors that illustrate, document, or otherwise testify to their own methodologies of compo sition and editing, as well as the standards they expected from their peers. Chapter after chapter offers remarkably clear glimpses into the medieval rabbinic author's study?the matrix of the new ideal of individual literary creativity that distinguished the authored halakhic writings of the Middle Ages from the collectively performed/ transmitted/composed compilations that became the literary sources of the codifiers, exegetes, and jurists whose works are discussed here. It is precisely in appreciation of Spiegel's main achievement that I feel his work suffers a major flaw. This work of rabbinic cultural history proceeds with barely a reference to the larger history of the book in the Christian and Islamic lands within which nearly every rabbinic author conceived and executed his literary projects. Thus, despite appearing at the dawn of the twenty-first century, Chapter II has the feel of a work written at the dawn of academic Jewish studies, when the main task of the historian was to document and celebrate Jewish cultural achievement rather than to inquire how such achievement may have resulted from, been enabled by, or even challenged the fecund cultures within with Judaic rabbinic culture flowered. Unfortunately, even after reading this massive and illuminating treatment of the history of the rabbinic book, this reader, at least, remains hungry for a study that will now contextualize all that Spiegel has provided us.
