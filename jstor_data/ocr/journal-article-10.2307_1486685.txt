<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sharman Kadish. Bolsheviks and British Jews: The Anglo-Jewish Community, Britain and the Russian Revolution. London: Frank Cass, 1992. xiv, 298 pp. Both Britain and the United States of America were swept by a "Red Scare" in the years after World War I. A feature of this anti-Communist witchhunt was the equation of Jews with Bolsheviks, particularly in the case of recent Russian-Jewish immigrants. Hundreds of left-wing Jews in Britain and the United States had their civil rights violated in the cause of the anti-Bolshevik crusade. Many were imprisoned and deported under traumatic circumstances. The Bolshevik Revolution thus helped to weaken the authority and influence of these Jewish communities, with tragic results. In this solid study Sharman Kadish traces how the myth of Jewish Bolshevism was created in Russia by counterrevolutionary and antisemitic forces and fed into British political life via diplomats and military advisors working with the White armies. She cites a string of prominent British journalists covering the war of intervention who spread the fable that the</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 207 Jews were behind the revolution and the murder of the tsar. They made antisemitism respectable in Britain. The fantasy of Jewish power, blended with Jewish conspiracy theories, was so contagious that it was taken seriously by the prime minister, Lloyd George, and by Winston Churchill. As secretary of state for war, Churchill promoted Zionism as an antidote to Bolshevism and warned Jews that they had to choose between these two "Jewish" ideologies. Kadish underlines the pioneering work in this area by Leon Poliakov, Colin Holmes, and Gizela Lebzelter, but also adds to our understanding of the density and breadth of the anti-Jewish currents in postwar Britain. A weakness of her analysis lies in her construction of the "liberal tradition" in British politics as the antithesis to, and nemesis of, antisemitism. Kadish concludes that the equation of Jews with Bolsheviks "fueled" antisemitism, "nourished" fascism, and "sowed the seeds" of 1930s Mosleyite activism. At the same time, she claims that by 1921 adherence to this set of beliefs was confined to the "lunatic fringe" of right-wing British politics. Yet throughout the interwar years mainstream political figures and the press sustained an anti-alien rhetoric directed largely at immigrant Jews. Press and parliamentary attacks on Zionism from 1920 to 1924 were larded with myths of Jewish power and claimed there was a connection between Jews and Bolshevism. Jews continued to be deported from Britain for left-wing political activities well into the 1920s. None of this is attributable to the "lunatic fringe." In a fascinating chapter Kadish illustrates the role of Jewish propagandists in disseminating the myth of Jewish Bolshevism. Both Chaim Weizmann and Lucien Wolf used the prominence of Jews in the ranks of the revolutionaries to gain leverage with British politicians. Weizmann argued that Zionism was the sole alternative to Bolshevism, and only British patronage of a Jewish homeland would staunch the flow of Jews to the left. Wolf threatened that unless the British encouraged constitutional reform and Jewish emancipation in Russia, Jews would remain loyal to the Reds if only on pragmatic grounds. This was playing with fire, and some of the credence paid to the Jewish-Bolshevik myth must be laid at the feet of these Jewish statesmen. Turning to Jewish responses to the revolution, Kadish shows that British Jewish leaders were faced by the dilemma of dual loyalty. They wanted to publicly condemn the White armies for instigating pogroms, but since the anti-Bolshevik forces were supported by Britain, they feared that this would appear to run counter to British national interests. Instead, the Jewish leaders resorted to the traditional devices of philanthropy and shtadlanut to aid Russian Jews. Only a few brave spirits and natural dissidents, such as</page><page sequence="3">208 BOOK REVIEWS Israel Zangwill and Leopold Greenberg, editor of the Jewish Chronicle, dared defend Bolshevism and criticize the counterrevolutionaries. Through imaginative use of oral history and the Yiddish press, Kadish builds up a finely nuanced account of the reaction of East End Jews to the events in Russia. The Yiddish press was jubilant about the February Revolution, but cool toward the Bolsheviks. Although it opposed the war of intervention and hailed the resumption of trade links between Britain and Russia, its support for Lenin's regime was predicated on abhorrence of tsarism and loathing for the atrocities perpetrated by the counterrevolutionary forces. Kadish deals sensitively with the charged question of how far Jews really were pro-Bolshevik. After a period of initial euphoria, British Jews and the immigrants surveyed events in Russia pragmatically and cautiously. Support for the revolution mingled with resistance to the conscription of Russian Jews living in London. From 1914 to 1917, thousands of Russian-born Jews in Britain had evaded military service because they were not British subjects. Their stand embarrassed British Jews, some of whom supported Draconian plans to deport them to Russia to fight there. British Jews felt that the fall of tsarism removed any objection that Russian-born Jews could have against military service. In fact, only an ideologically committed few returned to Russia voluntarily. Most left-wing immigrants opposed the war on principle, and eventually the British and Russian governments had to devise a complex arrangement whereby Russian nationals could be conscripted into the British forces or sent back to Russia. Kadish estimates that 3,000 Russian Jews returned to Russia. Most of them arrived too late to take any part in the war and were swallowed up in the chaos of the revolution. Hundreds tried to return to Britain, but found their way barred by a vindicated Home Office. Kadish concludes that the Russian Revolution exposed the shakiness of the "liberal compromise" which facilitated Jewish life in modem Britain. It raised the dilemma of dual loyalty and added to the varieties of anti-Jewish discourse. By 1924, Jewish opinion was mainly critical of Lenin's regime. But by that time the damage had been done in both Russia and Britain, where Jews remained tarred with the brush of Bolshevism.
