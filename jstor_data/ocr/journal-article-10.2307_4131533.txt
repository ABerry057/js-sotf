Albany: State Uni- versity of New York Press, 2002. x, 235 pp. Menachem Lorberbaum. Politics and the Limits ofLaw: Secularizing the Political in Medieval Jewish Thought. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. xii, 216 PP. The two books before us expand the horizons of Maimonidean studies, on the divergent planes of literature and politics. James Diamond's study of Mai- monides' use of the Bible and midrash is a tour de force of literary analysis, while Menachem Lorberbaum offers in part a view of Maimonides' attitude to political authority of considerable relevance today. The title of Diamond's book is very apt, in that Maimonides' hermeneutical 361</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews practices are often keyed towards concealing his true views on the nature of the Deity and His relation to the world. It does not help that much to have Maimonides confess in the introduction to the Guide that he will be crafty and deceptive, for which of his often apparently conflicting positions is the one he really holds? The scriptural and midrashic sources that Maimonides brings in alleged support of a given claim can often strengthen a contrary position, vehamevin yavin, only the wise will understand. This is the dimension of Maimonides' work, the ubiquitous presence in it of traditional proof texts, that James Diamond addresses, and his im- pressive treatment of these sources assists in making all of us wiser. Diamond is concerned primarily with Maimonides' handling of the issue of Divine Providence, and focuses primarily on Maimonides' treatment in Guide I: 15 of the biblical tale of Jacob's ladder. The chapters in the Guide that lead up to this, as discussed in Chapter 4 of Diamond's book, and the "seven units" of images and terms associated with the ladder that constitute Chapter 5, are the heart of this study. They offer a highly persuasive reading of Maimonides' utilization of sources, showing his interpretive boldness and creativity. As Diamond remarks, "Maimonides' use of midrash can be described as the allegorization of allegory" (p. 3). Diamond understands correctly that Maimonides' view of Divine Unity pre- cludes change and affect in God, removing Him from personal relationships with mankind. Divine Providence accordingly is expressed for Maimonides in the work- ings of the natural world, knowledge of which he regards as equivalent to recep- tion of that providence. Diamond's achievement lies in showing how Maimonides construes the bible and rabbinic sources, which treat God in personal and human terms, to support a deistic interpretation. For all his impressive interpretation and marshalling of sources, Diamond attempts to avoid taking sides philosophically on the many issues that are con- nected to this understanding of Divine Providence. He explicitly excuses himself from "entering the debates" over Maimonides' positions on creation and the sta- tus of ethics (pp. 98, 196). When given, philosophical explanations are mostly pre- sented summarily. His distinction, for example, on page 189, note 50, between God's relation to eternity a parte ante and a parte post requires considerable qual- ification. This, then, is not a work of philosophical argument so much as it is one of literary support of such argument. This support can never be conclusive in its own right, though it does make a powerful case for believing it reveals the true Mai- monides. Diamond is writing for an educated audience, some of whom will wince at the uninformed transliteration of Hebrew words that appear in the book (midah for middah, r'osh for ro'sh, malkhiyot for malchuyot, etc.). Diamond is not an Ara- bist (this is particularly evident in the manner in which he consults only secondary texts for a particular reading at p. 183, n. 10), and his Hebrew may need work. He does, however, have full control of the midrashic and commentary literature that are at the heart of his book, and cracks the code resoundingly. Menachem Lorberbaum has written a book that "explores the emergence and elaboration of the fundamental political concepts of medieval Jewish thought, pri- marily concepts related to political agency, political life as a distinct domain ofhu- 362</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews man activity, and constitutional politics" (p. xi). This may come as something of a surprise to those who are more accustomed to viewing medieval Jewish thought as opposed to such attitudes. Lorberbaum, however, establishes a significant en- gagement with these issues, exemplified through analysis of attitudes towards monarchy and the law. The monarchy and law in question are Jewish, but the entailments of the po- sitions taken bear upon the Jewish attitude towards gentile rulers and the larger non-Jewish polity in which Jews have lived. Though Lorberbaum eschews dis- cussing the present political situation in Israel, much of his analysis has contem- porary significance for the crisis in the relation of politics and religion there. As Lorberbaum points out in his introduction, the biblical view of political rule legitimates monarchy but places God above the mortal sovereign as the true king of a theocratic state. The failings of and disappointments with the Hasmonean kings undoubtedly led the rabbis to distance themselves and the law from theo- cratic and monarchic models of leadership while at the same time recognizing the practical necessity of according a king extrajuridical status. Medieval Jewish thinkers sharpened the implicit dichotomization of rabbinic attitudes towards the political scope of Jewish law, acknowledging the authority of extra-halakhic, or as Lorberbaum calls them, "secular" norms. Maimonides in the twelfth century is seen as attempting to balance competing normative and ideal at- titudes towards political agency, while R. Nissim Gerondi (the RaN) in the four- teenth century is presented as a culminating voice of extreme secularization, explicitly advocating a dual legal system. Lorberbaum considers the views of Gerondi and his predecessors, Nah- manides and Solomon b. Abraham ibn Adret (RaSHBA), as providing the theoret- ical justification for the consolidation of a Jewish communal self-government independent of rabbinic authority. In a final chapter, Lorberbaum considers Abra- vanel's rejection of these views and Spinoza's extreme adoption of them. Maimonides, Lorberbaum demonstrates, explicitly recognizes the limita- tions of legal precepts, always geared to theoretically typical instances, providing means therefore to suit the general to the specific case. One such means is the abil- ity of jurists to invoke "temporary decisions," hora'at sha'ah, whereby the miti- gating conditions of contingency come to the fore (p. 39). Kings, too, enjoy such discretionary powers, Maimonides acknowledges, a view borne in upon him by his convictions regarding the role of monarchy in assuring a stable society. Thus the king, however respectful he ought to be of the law and the Sanhedrin, can act out- side of their purview when he judges it necessary. In Lorberbaum's view, Maimonides distinguishes between commands that govern ritual behavior and those that govern civil behavior, the king given latitude with the latter. This latitude is extended to the right of kings to prescribe royal laws in fiscal and other matters, as well as in criminal cases. This establishes a dual and potentially competing legal system with that of the Sanhedrin/rabbinate, Lorber- baum asserts. He regards this as a failing in Maimonides' political theory that is only partially resolved by his messianic doctrine. Lorberbaum presents Gerondi within the context of changing halakhic atti- tudes to communal legislation in Christian Spain in the thirteenth and fourteenth 363</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews centuries; changes that increasingly empowered townspeople (benei ha-cir) to de- cree and enforce statutes, creating eventually a new legal domain, that of public law (p. 95). Utilizing examples from all areas of life, Lorberbaum contends that the kahal was treated as a distinct legal persona, with the right to enact and enforce takkanot (ordinances). Lorberbaum traces this process through the writings of Nachmanides and Adret as well as Gerondi, delineating a progressively more explicit division of le- gal authority and political leadership. The preservation of social order is the pri- mary concern for these men, which under the prevailing conditions renders the civil and criminal laws of the Torah inoperative and opens the door, in the name of tikkun ha-medinah, to communal government (p. 122). Gerondi's political views are elicited from the collection of sermons known as Derashot ha-Ran, particularly the eleventh sermon. Neither a kabbalist nor a philosopher, Gerondi subscribes to a traditional religious worldview, one that re- gards God's will as the primary cause of all events in the universe. Yet Gerondi, in Lorberbaum's opinion, also distinguishes between Torah law and temporal law, recognizing politics as an autonomous domain of action (p. 130). Gerondi's idealization of the sacral character of Torah law is far removed from Maimonides' utilitarian treatment of that law, and Lorberbaum regards it as problematic for a political philosophy. He sees Gerondi as implicitly conceding that society cannot be run by Torah law. This book thus presents two models of medieval Jewish political thought that offer precedents for distinguishing between theocratic and secular law. Lorber- baum writes clearly and persuasively, and one only regrets that the second part of the book, dealing with Gerondi and his predecessors, quotes from sources that are for the most part available only in their original Hebrew. Analysis has here pre- ceded full translation, a task that ought to be addressed soon. Alfred Ivry New York University New York, New York</page></plain_text>
