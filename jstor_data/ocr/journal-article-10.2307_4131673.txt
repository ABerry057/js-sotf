Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005. xiii, 253 pp. Pamela Barmash's Homicide in the Biblical World is a valuable study developed from a Harvard doctorate. The author provides an overview of bib- lical sources (legal and narrative) and consistently compares them with sources from the ancient Near East (going well beyond the "law collections"). She sees the biblical traditions as largely independent of each other and stresses the diversity to be found within the ancient Near East. She is skeptical of devel- opmental interpretations of the relationship among the principal homicide passages in the Covenant Code (Exodus 21: 12-14), Deuteronomy 19, and Numbers 35 and stresses differences in theological outlook, particularly between the latter two. An introduction summarizes the author's approach and theses. The first chapter sets the scene by discussing the case of Cain and Abel, which "both concurs with and diverges from the treatment of homicide as described in the rest of the Bible." The burden of the argument is carried out in four chapters: "Blood Feud and State Control" (Chap. 2), "The Development of Places of Refuge in the Bible" (Chap. 3), "Pollution and Homicide" (Chap. 4) and "Typologies of Homicide" (Chap. 5). The book concludes with chapters devoted to the lex talionis and homicide of a foreign citizen (as found in ancient Near Eastern documents). An appendix provides publi- cation data on the forty-seven cuneiform sources on homicide discussed in the book. Although Barmash is concerned with the details of the presentation of homi- cide in biblical laws and narratives and provides a comparison with what is found in documentary sources from the ancient Near East, she usefully locates the problems within the more general relationship between biblical and ancient Near Eastern law. In particular, she engages with earlier debates regarding the uniqueness of biblical law in this area and attempts to compare the underlying values of the two cultures. What emerges is a nuanced account: on one hand, a distinction is drawn between those areas involving homicide in which there is a close literary connection between biblical and ancient Near Eastern provisions and other areas in which practice appears to have been very different; on the other hand, she observes significant diversity within the cultures of the ancient Near East themselves. The precise nature of these genres, however, remains a moot point, and I would not follow Barmash in her understanding of the biblical law codes (and certainly not the Covenant Code) as "statutes" reflecting the dilemmas of an actual court. Nor would I agree that for cuneiform law, "justice is abstract: It is articulated in conventional cases that shy away from complexity" (10). 435</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews The cases in the Mishpatim that (for Barmash) are most closely connected to the Mesopotamian scribal tradition-namely, the goring ox and the pregnant woman caught up in a brawl-show, particularly in their biblical forms, signs of scholarly elaboration (but still in an entirely concrete mode of think- ing). More importantly, Barmash accepts that, although these biblical pro- visions "are part of the ancient Near Eastern literary tradition of writing formal law," this does not exclude authors from composing their own vari- ations: "a scribe would show his legal flair and even test his larger assump- tions about the world" (146). She is also less dogmatic than some with regard to the (lack of) relationship between Babylonian literary tradition and practice, nicely rebutting Finkelstein's argument from the silence of the legal records about goring oxen. The basic differences between the biblical and ancient Near Eastern approaches to homicide are viewed as reflecting societal factors. Whereas in Mesopotamia "a central government exerted control over the legal process ... a social system based on kinship ties persisted in ancient Israel" (8), where the "legal system reflects the singular role of the family in ancient Israel's social structure" (26). She stresses the "social, political, and economic differences between Israel and Mesopotamia. A pivotal characteristic of Mesopotamian society was urbanism, embodying a social organisation that was centralized, bureaucratic, and specialised, whereas constituent parts of the Bible reflect a decentralised, unspecialised, mildly bureaucratic, rural society ... one of the characteristics of urbanism is the substitution of a society organised politically on territorial principles from one based on ties of kinship" (44f). She does not quite elevate kinship ties, the role of the family, and "communal solidar- ity" to the status of religious values but rather implies that their survival late into the monarchy (and in some respects beyond) reflects such a conscious positive evaluation. In other respects, however, religious values are shown to generate important differences in the homicide sources: In particular, different conceptions of pollution operate both within the Hebrew Bible (where D attributes it to the people, P to the land) and in comparison with the ancient Near East (where pollution caused by homicide is generally ignored). Naturally, there are issues on which views will differ, though Barmash's arguments deserve full consideration. Of particular interest are her account of altar asylum in Exodus 21:13-14 and its relationship to the cities-of-refuge tra- ditions; her attempt to distinguish negligent from accidental homicide; her claim that damim is a technical legal term for responsibility for homicide; and her interpretation of the provisions of Deuteronomy 19 (very different, as she shows, in both presuppositions and procedures, from Numbers 35) as entailing both a trial in absentia and a form of communal responsibility (rather than another round of blood feud) if the go'el hadam kills an unpremeditated killer before the latter reaches a city of refuge.
