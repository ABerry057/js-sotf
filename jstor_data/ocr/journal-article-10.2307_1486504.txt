Jacob Rader Marcus, an indefatigable and prolific pioneer in American Jewish studies, has produced a history of the Jews in the United States that will eventually fill four large volumes, and will be the most comprehensive chronicle of the Jewish people in America written by one person. Marcus began writing about the Jewish experience in America in 1916, and his earlier works have already become monumental in every sense of the word. Anyone who labors in the field of early American Jewish history is aware of having to start with Marcus's three-volume The Colonial American Jew (1970), his two-volume Early American Jews (1951-55), and his Studies in American Jewish History (1969). For more than seventy-five years Marcus has been an outstanding teacher and scholar. He is also the founder, and for nearly fifty years has been the director, of the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati. A reviewer, therefore, comes to the four new books of Marcus with almost as much awe as to the five books of Moses. Employing largely unused primary sources, Jacob Rader Marcus for the bulk of these first two volumes focuses on the cultural, political, and</page><page sequence="2">230 BOOK REVIEWS economic life of American Jews from 1776 to 1860. And although one of the author's central conclusions is that the Jews eventually relinquished tradi- tional Judaism-though not Jewishness-nearly one-third of his attention is, with telling effect, devoted to religious behavior and institutions. From their arrival in the 1650s and throughout the Jewish American experience to 1860 (and presumably beyond), Jews in the New World were involved in two organically related dialectical dances-one between the Jewish individual and the Jewish community, and another between the Jewish community and the evolving American culture. Jews in America almost immediately established synagogues, cemeteries, schools, and a system of charities. And the community thus constituted, Marcus argues, contained a component of compulsion. Not joining could mean ostracism in life and even, with no Jewish burial rights, in death. On the other hand, synagogue and community leadership, "though autocratic in intent, was permissive in practice" (vol. 1, p. 38). For every Jew was needed, often desperately, for a minyan. Not having a religious quorum meant no services; no services meant no Judaism; and no Judaism meant no survival of a Jewish community. Congregations had to make concessions in order to hold members. There were compromises on the dietary laws, circumcision, and the Sabbath, from New York to New Orleans. And in Baltimore the intermarried could remain in the congregation, but without a vote. Compromises were necessary because of the increasing temptations of the secularizing American culture. After all, even among Christians in 1800, less than 7 percent of Americans were church-affiliated. Moreover, despite a great deal of antisemitism, the evidence for which is masterfully organized and discussed by Marcus, Jews were ultimately "accepted" by their new countrymen. The relatively high incidence of intermarriage-estimates range from more than 20 percent for the United States generally to 50 percent for wide-open boom towns like New Orleans-is partial testimony to this. Jewish community and synagogue leaders were convinced that intermarriage threatened the very existence of the American Jewish world. Their worry was not without a rational foundation, for "when Jews married Gentiles, very few lived as Jews. The overwhelming majority adopted the Christian way of life" (vol. 1, p. 608). Intermarriage, however, at least until 1860, Marcus assures us, did not destroy the Jewish community, it merely "diluted" it. If Jews refused to be</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 231 observant, they were just as stubborn in refusing to convert to Christianity. In addition, the push toward assimilation was counteracted by the residue of political and social rejection, and economic discrimination, to which Jews were subjected. Even in free and open America, with its constitutional guarantees and ideological promises, its separation of church and state, and the presence of other targets of antipathy--e.g., blacks, Indians, Catholics, Mormons-there was enough antisemitism to retard full equality for Jews in many spheres of social life. Furthermore, as Marcus demonstrates throughout the two volumes, there were positive reasons which moved Jews to resist assimilation, including the many substantial advantages of social-welfare security as well as the "comforting psychological haven" of Jewish identification. Although the author tells us at the very start of volume 1 that he is primarily interested in Jews as Jews, and less in Jews as citizens, he does give us a good deal of material and insight about Jews as an integral part of the larger American community. Indeed Marcus goes so far as to say at several points that Jewish commerce, with its intercolonial dimensions, and later its interstate and interregional character, assisted in creating a common American culture, which prepared the way for the American Revolution, and for a nationalism in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries that transcended sectional diversity. Also without being overly present-minded, Marcus, apparently aware of current controversies and the abuse of history for political purposes, pays some attention to Jews and slavery. Although he does not cite David Brion Davis, Marcus agrees with his argument that the Jewish part in the slave trade was small.' "Where traffic in blacks was concerned, Jews were always on the periphery," Marcus writes. And the slave sales of "all Jewish traders lumped together did not equal that of the one Gentile firm dominant in the business." In his usual judicious fashion, Marcus concludes that "If Jews in large numbers were absent from the traffic, it was not necessarily because of scruples. . . . Most Jews lacked the capital to pursue what was after all, a hazardous, speculative business" (vol. 1, pp. 156-157). And "very few Jews . .. protested against chattel slavery on moral grounds," but "the freeing of slaves by Jews was by no means unusual" (vol. 1, pp. 585-586). 1.

As late as 1840, five states, four in the northeast, had not yet accorded Jews full political equality. This, however, was less significant, Marcus argues persuasively, than the religious equality inherent in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. Moreover, the principles embodied in the Federal Constitution, which prohibited Congress from interfering with the free exercise of religion and from making laws respecting the establishment of religion, and which prohibited religious tests as a qualification for holding national office, ultimately made Americans the people who for the first time in Christian history dared to give Jews equal privileges and immunities. The Jews gained most of their liberties by hitching a ride on the coattails of Christian dissenters, but leaders of the Jewish community like Isaac Mayer Wise and Isaac Leeser recognized, too, that libertarian principles applied to Jews only insofar as Jews were willing and able to unite in their own defense. Marcus's discussion in volume 2 of the campaign to remove the anti-Jewish restrictions imposed in the Swiss-United States commercial conventions of 1850 is a good example of how he handles this general theme. He effectively brings together a wealth of details and encases them in a sophisticated analysis sensitive to the complexities and multiple variables of ethnic politics, economics, and international relations. American Jews won the right to trade and settle in the Helvetian Republic, but the greatest benefit of the Swiss affair, Marcus argues, was the growth of Jewish homogeneity. At the end of this campaign for Jewish rights, there still was no national organization tying Jews together, but Jewish unity was growing. That unity would be seriously challenged beginning in the 1880s with the mass migration of Eastern European Jews to the United States, but we will have to wait for volumes 3 and 4 to learn what Marcus makes of the modern era. In the meantime he has once again added immensely to our knowledge with his even-handed yet committed new work. There are some weaknesses. He says in one place, for example, that Jews, reinforced by American tendencies, were individualistically inclined and "could not work together as a group to secure political emancipation" (vol. 1, p. 115), and in another that the Jewish community nourished "unity and cohesion which made for a strong sense of loyalty," and that "virtually all Jews held to the concept</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 233 of Kelal Yisrael, the Oneness of the Jewish people" (vol. 1, p. 220). These may not be mutually exclusive statements, but we need to be told why not. The same is true when we juxtapose the claims that "no congregation ever fell apart because of factionalism" (vol. 1, p. 38) and that "an Ashkenazic congregation came into being in Charleston" because "there was a quarrel and a resultant secession from the original congregation" (vol. 1, p. 221). Marcus also informs us that the Jews who began to be elected to Congress for the first time in the 1840s were invariably men with no interest in Judaism, but that by the 1850s most Jews going to Congress had some ties to the religion of their ancestors. This is very interesting, but we are offered nothing in the way of explanation of this seemingly important change. There are also occasional lapses, especially in terms of general American history, as when Marcus suggests that the American Revolution was not supported by the masses, or, neglecting the Fourteenth Amendment, that states were not forbidden to tamper with First Amendment rights until 1937.2 He also says somewhat misleadingly that in the mid-nineteenth century, American Catholics had a monolithic church, and that the United States was not interested in collecting religious statistics of any sort.3 Marcus also, surprisingly and unfortunately, given his general interpretive thrust, occasionally uses "assimilation" and "acculturation" interchangeably.4 And in regard to readability, too often we get a phrase like "a religiosocial pious association built on a charitative base" (vol. 2, p. 36). Despite these complaints, these volumes, written with wit and wisdom, constitute an intriguing and compelling historical survey explaining and illustrating several significant Jewish themes: the dominance of the laity over the clergy; the emphasis on this-worldliness and rationalism over mysticism and emotion; the modification of religious belief and observance; 2.
