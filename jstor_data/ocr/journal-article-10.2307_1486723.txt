Hanover, N.H.: Brandeis University Press, 1994. xiv, 298 pp. Once again certain American policymakers are championing the revival of orphanages as institutions capable of solving some of America's social problems. Perhaps not coincidentally, several histories of orphan asylums, in- cluding Jewish orphanages, have recently appeared. In The Luckiest Orphans: xyz. The most recently published volume, Anna Jurova and Pavel Salamun, eds., Kosice a deportacia zidov v roku 1944 [Ko'ice and the deportation of Jews in the year 1944], tells of many Magyar and Slovak clerics of various denominations who rescued Jews, as well as others who assisted the persecutors.</page><page sequence="2">430 BOOK REVIEWS A History of the Hebrew Orphan Asylum of New York (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1992), Hyman Bogen, who spent part of his childhood there, examined the largest Jewish institution of its kind in the world. In Inside Looking Out: The Cleveland Jewish Orphan Asylum, 1868-1924 (Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1990), Gary Polster did the same for this midwestern institution. Now, in These Are Our Children: Jewish Orphanages in the United States, 1880-1925, Reena Sigman Friedman goes beyond the study of a single asylum to write the first comparative history of Jewish orphanages in their heyday. Surprisingly, her bibliography fails to include Bogen's book and cites Polster's 1984 dissertation rather than his 1990 book. Yet, despite these startling lacunae, Friedman has written an important book. She focuses largely on three major Jewish orphanages: New York's Hebrew Orphan Asylum, established in 1860; the Jewish Foster Home of Philadelphia, a smaller, and thus somewhat less rigid, institution; and the Cleveland Jewish Orphan Asylum, which housed children from throughout the Midwest and the South. In comparing and contrasting the founding of these institutions-and, when appropriate, other, generally smaller asylums-their relations to their urban settings, and the lives of their superintendents and the children entrusted to their care, she has drawn a full picture of this sphere of American Jewish social welfare. Friedman's comparative approach allows larger historical patterns to emerge. For example, she does a fine job setting the growth of Jewish orphanages in the context of the emergence of similar childcare institutions in both American urban settings and European Jewish communities in the second half of the nineteenth century. Setting these organizations in the matrix of Jewish philanthropy in their respective cities, she delineates, for example, the impact of the Federation movement on the orphanages. Most importantly she reveals how changing attitudes toward children and childhood in the early twentieth century set the stage for institutional liberalization. The picture Friedman paints of the "depersonalized procedures, routinized schedules, and harsh discipline" (p. 36) of nineteenth-century Jewish orphanages is indeed bleak, scarcely a step removed from Charles Dickens's Oliver Twist. Orphanage "inmates" shivered in ice cold baths, did without overcoats even in winter, and were stunted from poor diet. While corporal punishment was prohibited, superintendents, matrons, and monitors beat and bullied children for bedwetting, stealing food, and running away. Yet, after the 1909 White House Conference on the Care of Dependent and</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 431 Neglected Children, and after the first generation of orphanage superintendents retired, new leaders, many of them graduates of the orphanages, gradually began restructuring institutional life. They added clubs and birthday parties, allowed for privacy in dormitories and bathrooms, and no longer restricted family visits to once every few months. Her comparative approach also allows Friedman to observe how major themes of the American Jewish experience played out in the orphanages. With vocational training, civics education, and postgraduate supervision, the orphanages became agencies of Americanization for both their wards and the immigrant families they occasionally returned to. Not unexpectedly, tensions surfaced between the "uptown" Jews, who supported the asylums, and the "downtown" East European Jewish immigrants and their children, whom they served. These were exacerbated by the orphanages' preference for Reform Judaism. Orphanage children knew their Hebrew prayers, but they worshipped with uncovered heads and ate in "kosher-style" kitchens. In the twentieth century, when the downtown newcomers challenged the hegemony of the uptowners, one sign of their success was the kashering of those kitchens. As with the best of the new social history, Friedman has carefully integrated American Jewish women's history. Gerda Lerner has observed that nineteenth-century women founded and managed social welfare institutions, only to find themselves replaced, as these agencies grew, by male leaders. Friedman confirms that Lerner's finding holds true for American Jewry too. And she also writes of the anguish of widowed and deserted mothers forced to split their families apart, for the majority of the children in Jewish orphanages were in reality half-orphans, and the majority of these were committed by mothers unable to earn enough to keep all their children at home. Friedman is largely uninterested in putting names and faces on the asylum graduates. Thus we never learn which of the orphanage boys went on to become president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. Nor would we know from These Are Our Children that the Hebrew Orphan Asylum's most famous alumnus, Art Buchwald, quipped that it was easier to get into Princeton than to get into the HOA.xyz Yet Friedman's compar- ative study supplies a wealth of detail about the evolution of a nationwide network of Jewish orphanages, their internal developments, and the ways in which they confronted some of the issues challenging American Jewry. xyz.
