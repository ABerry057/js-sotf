<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ESSAY 'OLAM KE-MINHA GO NOHEG by HAYM SOLOVEITCHIK Yishaq (Eric) Zimmer. 'Olam ke-Minhago Noheg. Jerusalem: Mercaz Zalman Shazar, 1996. 327 pp. This two-pronged study is a work of sound and sober scholarship and of sterling honesty. The first section comprises a study of the course and fate of ten religious requirements or customs. Among those addressed is the history of the male head covering (yarmulke or kippah), a topic previously subjected to all types of tendentious studies, which receives here its first objective and comprehensive presentation. A second study is that of pe'ot (earlocks) and its fate over the course of two thousand years of Jewish history. Next, comes a fascinating history of prayer gestures--bowing or prostration, closed or open eyes, clasped, folded or outstretched hands, immobile or swaying body (shokln, in Yiddish). All these stances were adopted by one community or another over the course of the past two millennia, and in a pathbreaking study, Zimmer provides us with a comprehensive survey of the Jewish postures of prayer. Certain strange practices in some communities on the afternoon of the Ninth of Av are then investigated, as is the fate of a number of variants in the prayerbook. Eating indoors, rather than in the sukkah, on Shemini Azeret, a practice we associate with Hasidic groups, is traced, in all its vicissitudes, back to a family in the eleventh-century Rhineland. The section concludes with an enlightening study of the disappearance in European Jewry of one of the standard requirements of mourning, 'atifat ha-rosh. The second section of the book addresses the issue of cultural cleav- age-the rift in many areas of religious practice that occurred in the late AJS Review 23/2 (1998): 223-234 223</page><page sequence="2">224 HAYM SOLOVEITCHIK Middle Ages between western and eastern Germany, known as Minhag Rheinus and Minhag Ostreich. This split continued until the Holocaust, as Poland adopted early on the "Rite of Ostreich," while Germany west of the Magdburg-Regensburg line, which included such famed communities as Mainz, Worms and Frankfurt (a. M.), remained true to the old Rhineland traditions. The differences between the rites are many and seem to form no pattern. Zimmer makes the first systematic study of nine of these different practices, from menstrual and postnatal sexual abstinence to the order of lighting Hanukkah lights (left to right or right to left) and seeks to come up with some common denominator. Zimmer cautiously suggests an idea or two, but candidly admits that they remain unproved and that no clear explanation has been found for this cultural rift, nor has any pattern been discovered in the strange and manifold ways that this fissure expressed itself. Not surprisingly, as cultural cleavages and boundary formations are among the most baffling problems in history, and in their final forms they often combine the most central with the seemingly trivial. That the geographic line that linguistically divided northern and southern France into the lands of langue d'oc and langue d'oil should roughly coincide with that which separates Romanesque from Gothic architecture seems to us, if not explicable, at least credible. That both should coincide with the geographic line separating sharply sloped roofs made of flat tiles from gently sloped ones made of curved tile seems somewhat ridiculous. Or take a more analogous example, one drawn from law. France in the Middle Ages was divided not only linguistically but also legally; it housed two differing legal systems. The famed Klimrath line which divides pays de droit &amp;crit (country of Roman law) from pays de droit coutumier (country of Germanic law) is almost identical with the one separating the zones using different terms for a mare (cavale or jument). (No disagreement, mind you, about what one called male horses--or dogs or cats, or any other animal for that matter-just about the word used for female horses.) And when one adds to the problem of cultural cleavage that of the diffusion of legal customaries-such disseminations often hinge on the origins of the early settlers, marriage alliances among elites who made or interpreted the laws and enforced the practices, zones of shared culture as reflected by common dialect and pronunciation-it seems naive to expect that an initial survey, seeking to trace for the first time the origins and course of nine such differences, should yield the whys and wherefores of the complex cultural cleavage that occurred during one of the least (internally)</page><page sequence="3">'OLAM KE-MINHAGO NOHEG 225 documented periods in central European Jewish history, in the harrowing 150 years that followed the Black Plague. Zimmer draws attention to six forces that had a significant impact on religious praxis: Palestinian traditions, which were especially active in the Ashkenazic culture in the High Middle Ages; German Pietism, which shaped the formation of the Austrian and Polish rite (Minhag Ostreich) in the late middle ages; Safedic mysticism, which often generated new rituals or swung the balance in favor of one competing practice over another in the course of the late sixteenth and the seventeenth century; cultural milieu, such as that which led to the abandonment of 'atifat ha-rosh in mourning; physical environment, as in the instance of the colder climate in Poland leading to the abandonment in many circles of eating in the sukkah on Shemini Azeret; and finally, the pervasive presence of the "ritual instinct," popular intuition as to what was or was not religiously appropriate, that has been so carefully detailed by Jacob Katz in The Shabbat Goy. The scholarship manifested throughout the study is meticulous, and the integrity in acknowledging the help of others and the circumspection in drawing conclusions simply admirable. There is little that this reviewer can do except make a correction or register a demurrer here and there, and then to share some thoughts about some of Zimmer's larger conclusions. If I caution about a number of Zimmer's inferences, it is not because he has expressed them incautiously-far from it, he is the very soul of caution-but because of the strange alchemy of grammatical mood that occurs in scholarly citation. Conclusions stated by an author in the subjunctive mood often emerge in the writings of others in the indicative one. First, to some addenda, corrigenda and demurrals: Pp. 72-113. This chapter on prayer gestures would be enhanced if placed alongside of Rudolph Suntrup's Die Bedeutung der liturgischen Gebaerden und Bewegungen in lateinischen und deutschen Auslegungen des 9 bis 13 Jahrhunderts (Munich, 1978). Jews may well have consciously avoided commonality with Christian religious gestures; they would, however, have shared the common gestures of the surrounding society, much as we, for example, show approval by clapping. For this reason, Suntrup's study should be complemented by Frangois Gamier's Le langue de l'image au moyen age, vol. II, Grammaire des gestes (Paris, 1982), a veritable encyclopedia of what each gesture and body position then meant. Pp. 83-84. One should add the outspread hands described by R. Mosheh of Coucy, the author of the Semag, in the prayer published by Y. Gilat in</page><page sequence="4">226 HAYM SOLOVEITCHIK Tarbiz 27 (1958/9): 56. This source, in turn, would be illumined by Heinz Demisch, Erhobene Haende: Geschichte einer Gebaerde in der bildenden Kunst (Stuttgart, 1984). P. 129. Spanish influence on the rites of fourteenth-century Bohemia seems to me implausible. P. 136. The author of the Commentary on Tamid is not R. Baruch of Worms, who authored the Sefer ha-Terumah. Urbach's arguments (Ba 'alei ha-Tosafot, rev. ed., vol. 1, pp. 354-360) on the matter are convincing. He is, however, a pupil of R. Samuel he-Hasid, which is yet more to Zimmer's point. Nevertheless, I fail to see what evidence there is that Hasidei Ashkenaz were instrumental in the desuetude of the daily priestly blessings (nesi'at kappayyim). If they demanded tevilat ba'alei qeryyin for prayer and, a fortiori, by Zimmer's conjecture, for nesi'at kappayyim, they obviously met that requirement regularly, for they certainly prayed daily. Why then should they not have had priestly blessings daily? If Zimmer wishes to attribute to Hasidei Ashkenaz the strange doctrine of the Sefer Miqsa 'ot, why then did they bless on holidays? Do menstrual cycles cease on yamim tovim? Pp. 163-74. In his treatment of sukkah on Shemini Azeret, our author has omitted the characteristically original position of R. Judah ben Kalonymus in his Yihusei Tannaim ve-Amoraim (ed. Y. L. Maimon), pp. 329-330. It deserves wider currency, as it is the most cogent argument ever made for eating indoors on Shemini Azeret. Pp. 194-195. Zimmer's bibliographical references to medieval dress are adequate but somewhat dated; e.g., H. Weiss, Kostumekunde (Stuttgart, 1876). He might consider updating them in a subsequent edition, using the bibliography found in Joachim Bumke, Hoefische Kultur (Munich, 1982) II, pp. 821-823. P. 216. The geographic divide between Minhag Rheinus and Minhag Ostreich presented by Zimmer, based, I assume, on the information contained in the discussion of suet (pp. 250-261), is practically identical with the line between Ashkenaz and Kenaan drawn by Max Weinreich in his History of the Yiddish Language (p. 46). Weinreich's discussion of the origins of the "Knaanite" settlement (pp. 79-91 and passim), while certainly open to question, is directly relevant to the problem that Zimmer addresses (e.g., pp. 234-235), and use of Weinreich's work on this issue, not to speak of his discussion of Lotter (pp. 330 ff.), and the relationship between eastern Yiddish and east-central German (pp. 448 ff.), would have enriched Zimmer's argument. One cannot overemphasize the fact that while the differences</page><page sequence="5">'OLAM KE-MINHAGO NOHEG 227 between Ostreich and Rheinus express themselves in halakhah and liturgy, the divide itself is cultural, and such cultural determinants as language and demographic origins need play a large role in any analysis of these fissures. Pp. 233-235. The attribution to Hasidei Ashkenaz of the growing tendency in eastern Germany to abstain from sexual relations during the entire postnatal period (yemei .tohar, 40 days after the birth of a son, 80 days after that of a daughter) seems to me forced. An ambiguous line in a manuscript of the Pane'ah Raza seems somewhat thin evidence in the absence of any corroboration in either Sefer Hasidim or the writings of Rokeah. Indeed, R. El'azar Rokeah explicitly permits sexual congress during this period (p. 234). HIasidei Ashkenaz were very stringent with regard to contact between a menstruant woman and any sancta-sacred objects (sifrei torah), places (syn- agogue), and acts (prayer). Full distance (harhakah) between spouses during the menstrual period was also advocated to best avoid sexual temptation, a human failing of which Hasidei Ashkenaz were only too well aware. However, to the best of my knowledge, there is no evidence that the German Pietists advocated sexual abstinence over and above what the law demanded. For all its asceticism in other matters, Sefer Hiasidim manifests an ample, almost lusty endorsement of marital sex. If the widespread practice of postnatal abstinence obtained, Hasidei Ashkenaz might well have gone along, but I have difficulty envisioning them initiating such protracted continence. I would also caution him on citing Auerbach's edition of the Eshkol (pp. 31, 221, 226, 244, 253). The early years of the twentieth century witnessed a bitter conflict over its authenticity. Shalom Albeck, the editor of a second, and much smaller, text of the Eshkol, launched a vituperative attack on Auerbach after his death, attacking not only Auerbach's judgment, but also his integrity and that of his widow. Not surprisingly, some leading scholars sprung to the defense of Auerbach's good name and published a pamphlet entitled Sidqat ha-Saddiq. Upon its appearance, Auerbach appeared vindicated. With all respect to the good will of these truly distinguished scholars, the pamphlet is long on encomia and short on argument. Seen now, from a perspective of some three-quarters of a century, Auerbach's Eshkol appears as a clear forgery, incorporating arguments found in sixteenth-, seventeenth-, and even eighteenth-century writings. This is not to say that Auerbach himself forged the manuscript. He may well have been duped. When he began working on it, in the mid-nineteenth century, manuscript publication of medieval halakhic works was in its infancy, and little was then known of the state of halakhic thinking in mid-twelfth-century Provence. Be that as it may, the work remains</page><page sequence="6">228 HAYM SOLOVEITCHIK a forgery and should not be used for historical purposes. I should, perhaps, add that Zimmer's citations of Auerbach's Eshkol are never crucial to his argument. Their elimination in no way alters the portrait he has drawn. And now to the larger conclusions: I would take exception to Zimmer's occasional penchant for explaining an inexplicable development by attributing it to "Palestinian influence." For example, I do not see the evidence for the Palestinian origins of swaying, shaking bodily gestures in prayer (pp. 211-212). A reference or two (pp. 100-101) to the literature of the yordei merkavah, the Palestinian visionaries of ecstatic ascent, seems an inadequate support. Ecstatic visionaries may well have trembled in prayer, but have we any evidence whatsoever, from the midrashim or the Talmud Yerushalmi, that ordinary Palestinian Jews swayed and "shokld" in their prayers? (Truth to tell, we cannot even find the putative reference in the hekhalot literature [ibid., n. 164].) There is, indeed, a Palestinian substratum to many Ashkenazic practices. This was pointed out in the earliest days of Wissenschaft des Judentums, and has been emphasized, perhaps overemphasized, in recent years. However, unless a Palestinian origin can be shown, adducing it without proof is, to my mind, to proffer a panacea rather than a solution. In fairness one should add that on the several occasions that Zimmer does tender this solution, he cautiously tags it with a "perhaps." Zimmer attributes to the colder climes of Poland the desuetude, in many Hasidic circles, of sitting in the sukkah on Shemini Azeret. If climate were a sufficient explanation, there should have been a disappearance of sitting in the sukkah on Sukkot itself. Climate, then, is a necessary but scarcely sufficient condition for this deviation from the norm. I would suggest that sukkah-sitting on Shemini Azeret was established on an original fault line, and its observance ultimately cracked under the joint pressure of colder climate and the change in religious calendar that occurred in eastern Europe as the Safedian kabbalah made ever greater inroads, especially among Hasidim. Allow me to explain. The Talmud (Shabbat 23a), when discussing the second day of yom tov (yom tov sheni shel galuyyot), states that, strictly speaking, one should not recite a blessing on the commandments performed that day, as, for example, the second night of the seder. However, were the rabbis to have instituted the second seder, for example, without the appropriate blessings over matzah and maror, people would not take the second-day ceremonies seriously (de-lo 'le-zilzulei bah). They made one exception to this policy, sukkah on Shemini Azeret-where they instituted sitting without the blessing, and, in the fullness of time, the exception proved the wisdom of the rule. It did</page><page sequence="7">'OLAM KE-MINHAGO NOHEG 229 not have to happen, and in most lands, indeed, it did not happen. In Poland, however, the frequently, bitter autumn cold made sukkah-sitting a genuine burden. Jews had sacrificed much for their religion, and no one dreamed that severe chills suspended the demands of religion, and Jews dutifully sat in sukkot throughout the Sukkot holiday. Shemini Azeret, however, was a different matter. Sukkah-eating on that day was clearly a second-class commandment. Evidence--it did not even merit a blessing, unlike all other second-day misvot. And by the 1640s, the laxity in sukkah-sitting on Shemini Azeret was widespread in Poland, as the remarks of the super-commentators on the Tur and the Shulhan Arukh clearly indicate (pp. 168-169). Common though it was, it was not yet characteristic of any group. In the course of the next century, the growing influence of Safedic kabbalah transformed Hoshanah Rabbah into a day equal to-indeed, greater in its momentous irreversibility than-Yom Kippur. On this day, the final and irrevocable judgment on every individual was rendered. The tension of Judgment Day stretched now, not from the first of Ellul (when selihot began) to Yom Kippur, but some fifty-two days-all the way to Hoshanah Rabbah. Just as mos 'ei Yom Kippur in Temple times became an occasion of celebration, as the accumulated tensions of that awesome day found release, so mos'ei Hoshanah Rabbah, the night of Shemini Azeret, became an eve of Hasidic celebration. Haqqafot were shifted from Simhat Torah, and the festivities of Shemini Azeret far exceeded those of its sister holiday. Such celebrations could scarcely be held outside in the cold October nights, and the festive eating and drinking could take place in the sukkah only with difficulty And so sukkah-eating on Shemini Azeret fell into desuetude among large bodies of Hasidim. The northern climate, indeed, played a role in this disuse, but without the original fault line of "no-berakhah" and the shift in date of the religious climax of the year, the sharp autumn cold, by itself, I would suggest, would have been insufficient to effect any large-scale change. Zimmer draws upon Ta-Shema's important article on the presence of numerous pupils of R. Judah he-Hasid in Slavic countries. Ta-Shema con- jectured that R. Judah he-Hasid moved from Speyer to Regensburg because of the opposition that he encountered in the old Rhineland city to his radical program and sought out the "frontier" zone as being more receptive to his innovative ideas. Similarly, pupils of his settled in the East precisely because in the new settlements there was a greater chance of instituting Hasidic doctrines. Adopting this line of thought, Zimmmer sees in German Pietism a major force in shaping the rite of Ostreich and Poland. It is an</page><page sequence="8">230 HAYM SOLOVEITCHIK interesting thesis and certainly worth pursuing. It should be noted, however, that Regensburg in the twelfth century was a burgeoning commercial center. Situated on the Danube, it was a gateway city to trade with southeastern Europe and the lands of Islam, and quite possibly was also already playing a central role in financing the Ostsiedlung. And Jewish settlement in medieval times often followed commercial opportunity. To ask why R. Judah he-Hasid settled there is to equally ask why other prominent Tosafists, such as R. Isaac ben Mordecai (Rivam), R. Isaac ben Jacob (Ri ha-Lavan), R. Ephraim, R. Baruch, and R. Shemaryah had all made their new homes in Regensburg. Moreover, Regensburg, while considerably east of the Rhineland, was no tabula rasa, waiting for the imprint of some distinguished emigre. It housed a distinguished line of German Tosafists, who antedated R. Judah in residence by a half century. More significantly, it was the seat of one of the most venerable Jewish communities in Germany, whose recorded history stretched back as far as that of the Rhineland cities. It is customary to picture the expansion of the German Jewish community as radiating eastward from the settlements on the Rhine. The written record, however, documents the simul- taneous emergence in the tenth century of Jewish communities both along the Rhineland and in the trading centers near and along the eastern borders of the Empire-Regensburg, Magdburg, Merseburg, and Prague. True, the oldest academies were in Mainz and Worms, but the other ancient communities were scarcely deferential about their local customs and practices. R. Isaac Or Zarua-who numbered R. Judah he-Hasid among his teachers-juxtaposes, with no sense of inferiority, the traditions of his native Bohemia with those of the Rhineland. As to the alleged influence of German Pietism on the Eastern Rite, we would do well to remember two things. First, rich and important as Ta-Shema's article is in the new information that it provides about little-known medieval Polish erudites, the connections between these scholars and Hasidei Ashkenaz remain, nevertheless, conjectural. For example, that the scholar R. Ya'akov ha-Kohen belonged to the circle of German Pietists is based on the assumption that the Ya'akov ha-Kohen (not a very rare or distinctive name) mentioned in the halakhic sources is one and the same person as the Ya'akov ha-Kohen mentioned in a now-lost kabbalistic manuscript. All that we know for certain is that R. Judah he-Hasid had Slavic pupils in his Bible classes. There is no evidence that these eastern students were scholars of any standing or that they exercised any authority in their homeland. Second, and more generally, we should be open to the presence of French influence on the eastern border</page><page sequence="9">'OLAM KE-MINHAGO NOHEG 231 of the Empire, a notion not as surprising as it may first sound. In the latter half of the twelfth century, some German scholars traveled to France to study under Rabbenu Tam, and in the thirteenth century this westward student migration became widespread. Indeed there is scarcely a single thirteenth-century German scholar of note who did not spend considerable time in French academies).' This means that German and French scholars not only formed one intellectual circle, but also experienced school-bonding; and friendships formed from living and studying together in adolescence and early manhood have proven to be one of the firmest bases of future contacts. French halakhic culture, moreover, was continuously rising in prestige, as German students flocked to France, while few French students, if any, studied in Germany. In mid-thirteenth century, Magdburg, on the eastern periphery, referred a question to Normandy, to R. Samuel of Falaise, who, sick at the time, asked his pupil, the future R. Meir of Rothenburg, to copy out his response;2 and in 1291, a plaintiff in Goslar wanted his case judged by "French rabbis."3 The fortunes of French Jewry declined steadily under Louis IX and Philip the Fair, and many people looked about for other lands of opportunity. We know of a steady stream southward; is it unreasonable to think of a migration, at least of the elite, eastward? The new German settlements needed men of learning, and the "old school network" was in place, a skein of friendships thickening here and there into nodes of influence, that could ease the placement of past comrades and colleagues, the would-be French emigres. Not surprisingly, then, does R. Hayyim Paltiel become the rabbi of Magdburg.4 His Sefer ha-Minhagim may well underlie that of R. Abraham Klausner, which played so decisive a role in the formation of the Minhag Ostreich. If correct, we would be faced with a major French component in the Eastern Rite.5 And let us not forget the settlement in Regensburg in the course 1. See AJS Review 1 (1976): 349. 2. Teshubot R. Meir ofRothenburg, ed. Lemberg, no. 386 3. Ibid., no. 476. 4. Cf. Henri Gross, Gallia Judaica, p. 482. 5. A half century ago, Daniel Goldschmidt established that the Sefer ha-Minhagim of R. Abraham Klausner was based heavily on that of R. Hayyim Paltiel, which he discovered and published (Kiryat Sefer, 23 [1947/48]: 73-83). Recently, Simhah Emanuel has contended that the Sefer ha-Minhagim of Hayyim Paltiel is itself based on a prior one of R. Hezekiah of Magdeburg found in a Bodley manuscript (Neubauer, 1150). If so, the influential rite of R. Klausner would be entirely German. As Emanuel analyzed the provenance of the Bodley manuscript rather than its contents--are the practices there mandated of French or German</page><page sequence="10">232 HAYM SOLOVEITCHIK of the twelfth century of the prominent German Tosafists, noted before, most of whom were pupils, in one form or another, of Rabbenu Tam and kept up an active correspondence with him.6 A beachhead may have been established, an opening wedge created, even at that early date, for French influence. It is too early to speak with any confidence of these matters, but it illustrates how complex a process was at work. The spread of swaying in prayer (shokln) in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries is attributed by Zimmer to Hasidei Ashkenaz (p. 101), though it seems more a French practice than a German one. In a similar vein, the famed, perplexing abstention from eating legumes (qitniyyot) on Passover, universally accepted in eastern Europe, is a French usage and not a German one.7 This Gallic custom then found endorsement at the eastern perimeter of the Empire, by one of the architects of the reconstruction of Jewish life after the Black Plague, R. Shalom of Neustadt, and by dint of his influence and that of his pupil, the famed R. Jacob Moellin, the enjoinment spread both eastward into Poland and westward back to the cities of the Rhineland. Again the pattern is: France to eastern Germany and then on to the plains of Poland. It is good to point out the possible influence of R. Judah he-Hasid on the Eastern Rite, but one has equally to note other forces that may have been no less formative. Much of the purported influence of the German Pietists, in Zimmer's analysis, revolves around their bent for stringency, for humra. However, not every tendency to humra need be attributed to Hasidei Ashkenaz. The impulse for a thickening of the heavenly yoke, a divine discontent with the common standard, and the sense of the inadequacy of the received norms to summon up the full measure of the believer's devotion are recurring features of all religions and spring from quite varied sources, most of which are unrelated usage?--only the publication of the manuscript will settle the issue. (Simhah Emanuel, "The Lost Books of the Tosafists" [Hebrew], Ph.D. diss., Hebrew University, 1993, pp. 263-264.) 6. See now the fine M.A. thesis of Rami Reiner (written under the direction ofY. Ta-Shema), "Rabbenu Tam: His Teachers and German Pupils" (Hebrew), Hebrew University, 1997, pp. 82-98. 7. R. Samson of Falaise and R. Peres of Corbeil (d. 1297-99) are the first writers to mention the practice, though it clearly antedates their compositions. Both R. Mordecai ben Hillel (Pesahim, 588) and R. Meir ha-Cohen (Haggahot Maimuniyyot [Constantinople, 1509] Hilkhot Hames u-Masah 5:1) know of it through the work of R. Peres, which they cite. The writings of R. Meir of Rothenburg and R. Asher (Rosh) make no mention of it, and it is equally absent from the code of R. Alexander Susslein, the Sefer ha-Agudah, the last German work written before the Plague.</page><page sequence="11">'OLAM KE-MINHAGO NOHEG 233 to any pietistic movement in the Rhineland. One may have little use for notions of the reson ha-bor'e or for the Pietists' radical social program, yet, for one's own reasons, share their aspirations of maximizing religious compliance. Even explicit statements made at much later dates, such as that of R. Joel Sirkes,8 should be carefully assessed. For time had passed and the more radical bent of the medieval Pietists had been long forgotten. Little now remained of the Pietists' legacy in the collective memory of pre-Chmielnicki Poland other than sensitivity in human relations, personal humility, rites of penance and an inclination toward humra. A new culture finding its voice (as Poland did then) is often in search of distinguished antecedents, and, in this case, a claim was easily made for descent from the venerated Hasidei Ashkenaz. Such assertions, however, may be more in the nature of acquired heraldry than actual lineage, or, if that be too harsh a metaphor, more a pious self-image than a fact. In specific instances, moreover, the impulse toward stringency may well come from wholly different sources. Zimmer himself has pointed out that the atmosphere of sexual abstinence that obtained in Germany in the century following the Black Plague had its influence upon Jewish practice, espe- cially with regard to postnatal sexual relations (p. 235). In sexual matters, furthermore, what appears to us as a humra, and undoubtedly is one from a legal point of view, may well have been a birth control measure instituted by women, who via issur niddah and yemei toharah ultimately controlled their sexual availability. Halakhically, the woman has full credibility as to the issur niddah and may announce at any time that she has experienced a minute flow, and women's mode of counting shiv'ah neqiyyim, regardless of how protracted, is legally binding, as evidenced by taqqanat Rav Ze 'ira in talmudic times and the four- to seven-day medieval extensions. Sexual subordination of the woman in principle, but frequent control of sexual congress in practice, is a central, if unnoticed, feature of Jewish domestic relations. And, one may add, the future historian who would essay to write its history (as Zimmer does not) would do well to pay heed to this fact. Finally, I would suggest that any treatment of the menstruation injunction, especially practices for which one is hard pressed to find any normative justification, involve, some use of anthropology. The taboo is nigh universal, and certain recurring patterns in human conduct may hold out as much enlightenment as possible filiations with Karaism or with some long-lost 8.

Admittedly, anthropology has no magic wand, and its current fashionability among historians is, indeed, a bit much; nevertheless, it may have much to offer the student of Jewish family life of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, a period in general history that is sometimes known as the "waning of the middle ages," but in Jewish history is no less than the crucible of Eastern European culture. These are some of the thoughts elicited by this rich, sober and scrupulous work. Zimmer's clearly written study is not always easy going, but it more than amply repays a close reading.
