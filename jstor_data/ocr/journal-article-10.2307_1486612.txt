<plain_text><page sequence="1">M. Mitchell Serels. A History of the Jews of Tangier in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries. Brooklyn: Sepher-Hermon Press, 1991. 324 pp. As the once-thriving Jewish communities of Morocco dissolve into history, preserving something of their past occupies not only those left behind (there are still about 5,000 Jews in Morocco) but also a greater circle of scholars in Israel, Europe, and the Americas. This movement of cultural preservation</page><page sequence="2">100 BOOK REVIEWS has taken on a variety of forms; recent years have seen an upsurge in books, personal memoirs, exhibitions of material objects, and the in situ preservation of sites such as synagogues and cemeteries. The business of transmuting Moroccan Jewish history into a memory is a thriving one, taking on many shapes and attitudes, of which this study of Tangier's Jewish community is a part. Mitchell Serels's effort must be seen against the background of other recent writing on Moroccan Jewish society and history. Generally speaking, this subject has drawn an international group of scholars producing a corpus of exceptional quality despite the scanty documentation. The Moroccan- French scholar Haim Zafrani has exploited literary and liturgical material to recreate a richly textured portrait of social and religious life from the late medieval period onward, representing with special poignancy the Moroccan Jewish imaginaire-that elusive yet distinctive way Moroccan Jews had of discerning meanings in the world around them. American scholars using cross-disciplinary methodologies in history and cultural anthropology have combined archival research with fieldwork to create nuanced images of Jewish life in specific locales. Kenneth Brown's People of Sald: Tradition and Change in a Moroccan City, 1830-1930 (Cambridge, Mass., 1976) and Daniel Schroeter's (Merchants of Essouira (Cambridge, Eng., 1983) stress social adaptation and the central role Jews played in economic life. The Israeli scholar Michel Abitbol has used the archives of the Jewish Corcos family of Marrakech to show how Muslims and Jews were bound together at every economic level. Finally, a group of Moroccan Muslim historians led by Germain Ayache have tried to reintegrate Jewish communal history into the broader sweep of Moroccan history by using locally generated Arabic sources. Historians of Jewish Morocco have available to them a variety of innovative models characterized by (1) the use of a range of sources both internal and external to Morocco; (2) a concern for Jewish culture as a human, lived experience; (3) a reverence for the particularity of place and the virtues of local knowledge; and (4) a sensitivity to the broader national, regional, and East-West contexts that profoundly affected the Jewish situation. This growing body of literature provides a point of reference for assessing Serels's book about Tangier. Certainly his choice of subject is a good one, for an informed study of the Jews of Tangier is long overdue. Tangier was Morocco's principal port and diplomatic capital in the late nineteenth century; after World War I, it became an international city where artists, adventurers,</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 101 and refugees sought safety and tranquillity among a mixed population of Christians, Muslims, and Jews. Despite its small demographic size (about 45,000 at the turn of the century, 10,000 of whom were Jews), Tangier was a commercial and cultural entrepOt of regional importance. The period under discussion is that of Tangier's glory, when it was the main portal of Western influence and its Jews were the primary carriers of European ideas and tastes to the rest of Moroccan society. Change came to Tangier long before it reached the inland population centers of Fes and Marrakech, giving the people of Tangier a clear sense of ascendance over Moroccan communities of the "interior." This attitude of superiority was especially pronounced among its Jewish population. A spirit of progress coupled with a deeply ingrained awareness of their "pure" Sephardic heritage were the bases for a feeling of cultural supremacy that persists even today. Serels does little in this book to question, objectify, or nuance this widely held communal myth; rather, he proves to be a willing accomplice in perpetuating it. He is only incidentally interested in the historical relations between Tangier's Jews and the rest of Moroccan Jewry, while Moroccan Muslims are seen mainly through the optic of their role as oppressors. Unlike most of the works mentioned above, this is not a finely textured study which explores the complicated strands connecting Jews to the wider Islamic society; rather, it is inward-looking and focused on the community itself. Nor does it treat the community as a whole, but rather concentrates on a narrow stratum at the top, the "grandees" who ran the local Junta, or community council. Here we have Jewish history of an older style, converging on elites rather than on the mass, largely ignoring diverse groups that make up the social fabric, such as women, the weak, or the dispossessed, and more concerned with memorializing than with sharp critical analysis. Examples of this approach abound. Opening his discussion of twentieth- century Tangier, Serels makes the following statement: "Tangier at the turn of the century was an amalgam of many people. Most of the Europeans were poor Spaniards who fled the economic crises of Spain. They earned their living by smuggling, running bars and cafes, and raising pigs. Many were alcoholics" (p. 76). No mention here of the elegant and educated Spanish families like the Abrines, who ran the first mechanical printing press in Tangier, producing books in Hebrew and Arabic as well as European languages, and who were friends and business associates to many Jews; no mention of the Spanish intellectuals who appear in the archives of the Alliance Isra61ite Universelle</page><page sequence="4">102 BOOK REVIEWS (AIU) in Paris, and who sought political refuge in Tangier and sent their children to Jewish schools; no discussion of the Jewish families who sent their children to Spanish schools as early as the 1880s. Evidence of close intercommunal ties, of which there are countless examples in the sources, is for the most part left out. Rather, we are left with an image of Spanish decadence that simply belies the truth. It is not only Spanish tangerinos who come in for malediction; Moroccan Muslims too are held at arm's length. The state is depicted as the antagonist and the Jews as innocent victims of a rapacious regime. The annual tax imposed on them by Koranic law was collected in a humiliating fashion, according to Serels, accompanied by "the traditional and compulsory slap on the face" (pp. 13, 14, and 191 n. 3), an observation repeated several times without mention of a specific source. To be sure, Muslim-Jewish relations in Tangier were complicated, sometimes tense, and occasionally even violent; but to recount stereotypes without supporting facts does not serve the cause of objective historiography. One must also remember that each Moroccan community differed from the other, and what may have been common practice in Fes was not necessarily known in Tangier. Hence the need to cite precise texts and contexts when making such allegations. Serels's sympathy for a broader, more cosmopolitan perspective on these issues might have been enhanced had he delved deeper into the archives. He must be credited for making use of the Actas, or "minutes," of the local Jewish community council of Tangier, an unpublished source of rare worth. Tangier was unique among Jewish communities in Morocco in having a local self-governing community council from the mid-nineteenth century. In the pages of the Actas one finds important information on charitable institutions, educational reform, changes in leadership, and fluctuations in economic conditions. But these notes do not constitute a complete record of communal affairs. The were severely edited, so that the conflicts forming the warp and woof of social relations were for the most part left out. Moreover, the record is filled with temporal gaps and topical omissions. These methodological difficulties might have been overcome by a parallel reading in other primary sources, such as the European diplomatic archives, or the enormously fertile archives of the AIU; inexplicably, these sources were not consulted. As a result, this study is flawed by its reliance on a narrow base of documentation that does not give us a full sense of the complexity and the complementarity of intercommunal relations.</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 103 One final criticism is that Serels does not provide us with the interpretive framework needed to assimilate this rich material and give it historical meaning, Instead, we are left with a mass of undigested information taken directly from the Actas and unmediated by structure or thematic development. The Actas document the ongoing problem in the community regarding the availability of kosher meat and its exorbitant price-a matter of great concern to Jews at every economic level. He tells us, for example, that in 1860 "there were constant problems between the Junta and the supervisor [mashgiach], on the one hand, and the growing number of Jewish butchers among the immigrant Jews. ... In May 1861, the butcher Rahamim Benlisha complained about the attitude and activities of the butcher's supervisor" (p. 17). This was undoubtedly a stirring controversy that echoed throughout the community, but its broader implications are unexplicated. Was the illicit sale of nonkosher meat a means for poor migrants from the countryside to earn a living in a difficult local economy? Why migrate to Tangier if jobs were scarce and conditions difficult? What was the general tenor of relations between local Tangier Jews and their migrant brothers and sisters from elsewhere? The larger meaning of the event is left to the imagination of the reader. All in all, Serels's book leaves us with a curiosity to learn more about this community: how personalities and events actually interelated, how individual lives fitted into a larger multi-ethnic cultural framework, how complicated and finely calibrated social mechanisms operated and evolved over time. The interplay of competitions and alliances among individuals and groups, and the influence of place, cultural context, and historical milieu on behavior are legitimate topics for the social historian. There are hints and suggestions of this sort of dynamic give-and-take in Serels's account, but they do not provide sufficient sustenance for the inquiring mind. With its well-intentioned but occluded perspective, this book represents a strong attachment to an idealized Jewish past, offering a gloss on a far more intricate reality.
