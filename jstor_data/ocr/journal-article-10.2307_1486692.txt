Lanham, Md.: University Presses of America, 1994. 367 pp. Eliezer Schweid is an Israeli-born philosopher-theologian. A product of the Palmach, a graduate from and later a professor at the Hebrew University, he is native to the soil, shaped by the institutions of prestate Palestine, not prewar Europe. He has fought in Israel's wars and is responsive to its hopes and fears. Schweid is sensitive to religious experience, mindful of tradition, yet open to non-Orthodox forms of Judaism, and to the power of secular thought and its religious implications. Most of his work is in Hebrew and therefore inaccessible to an English-reading audience that would be the</page><page sequence="2">222 BOOK REVIEWS natural constituency for his thought; the few works that have been translated give us a rare and well-needed insight into Israeli religious thinking and its encounters with the Zionist enterprise and contemporary history. Wrestling Until Day-Break is a fine example of Schweid's thinking, its depth, its gift, its limitations as well. The title reflects the work with problematic accuracy, for Schweid searches for meaning in the thinking on the Holocaust and not in the Event itself. He is one step removed from the Shoah; and remains one step at a distance. Part of this attitude reflects his respect for the experience of those who were there, but part also is a choice of the safety of distance. Perhaps if he had drawn closer, the work would have been more piercing, more penetrating. Schweid encounters diverse thinkers of very different backgrounds: lib- eral Jews like Leo Baeck, seemingly secular psychoanalysts like Viktor Frankl, seemingly secular Zionists like Shimshon Dregner; religious Zionists like Emil Fackenheim and Irving Greenberg; ultra-Orthodox Zionists like Rabbi Issachar Shlomo Teichthal. Where he agrees-and especially where he disagrees-he treats all of the thinkers with profound respect, seeking to learn what has shaped their thought, the religious questions that perplex them. Still, he often remains at a distance; except for Teichthal, the thought is disembodied, less an existential response to an earth-shattering Event and more an ontological search necessitated by the history they have lived. The books lacks drama; it is at once dry and controlled, yet objective and scrupulously fair. Sometimes distance from the Event falsifies thinking. For example, Schweid writes with confidence that those with faith were able to sustain themselves morally unblemished even in the death camps. Yet Primo Levi has argued that "survival without renunciation of any part of one's own moral world-apart from powerful and direct interventions by fortune-was conceded only to very few superior individuals made of the stuff of martyrs and saints."' Elie Wiesel concurs. "Saints are those who die before the end of the story. The others . . . no longer dare look at themselves in the mirror, afraid they may see their inner image."2 And Lawrence Langer, author of Holocaust Testimonies: The Ruins of Memory, who has reviewed more survivor testimonies than anyone else, speaks of anguished memory, humiliated memory, tainted memory, and unheroic memory.

The closer one comes to the Event, the more difficult the confidence. Wrestling with that darkness is required, is obligatory, to enter the kingdom of night and emerge at dawn. Schweid is most instructive when dealing with ultra-Orthodox thought, whose nuances he covers clearly without the complexity and complications of the descriptions in Gershon Greenberg's scholarly essays. He is most persuasive when speaking of religious Zionism, which sees the State of Israel as more than a consolation but as a manifestation of the Divine Presence in the aftermath, requiring a new and more active understanding of the role of the Jewish people in the encounter between God and Israel. He restates the Zionist critique of exile. After the Holocaust exile is no longer possible. The Jew must return home. Here he discovers his roots and stands firm. One wishes that Schweid had grappled here, as he has done elsewhere, with the messianism of the post-Holocaust era, which ranges from the fascination of the Hasidim of Lubavitch with their Rebbe as Messiah, to Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook and his disciples, who perceive the return to the land not as the dawn of redemption but in apocalyptic terms. But that must await other works, other translations, surely soon to come. Schweid concludes, as does Eliezer Berkovits (whose name is consistently misspelled by the translator), with faith in the loneliness of the believer before a hiding God. Those who wrestle with these issues and read Schweid seriously will discover that with him they may be alone together-and thus less alone, and more together.
