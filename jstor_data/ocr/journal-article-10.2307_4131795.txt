<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sidra DeKoven Ezrahi. Booking Passage: Exile and Homecoming in the Modern Jewish Imagination. Contraversions. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000. xii, 358 pp. The post-Zionist perspective is a commonplace in political and social dis- course these days, and with this book it seeks to ensconce itself in the literary do- main. Sidra Ezrahi, who teaches at the Hebrew University, situates herself here in an existential stance antipodal to Yehuda Halevy's: her heart is in the West even as she sits at the edge of the East. Manifestly Ezrahi, in readings of nine writers and poets, has constructed a literary triptych that seeks to rationalize the post-Zionist moment and narrative. What it boils down to is a book that is essentially a detailed gloss, in literary terms, on one of the seminal articulations of Diasporism as the anodyne to the moral ambiguities of political Zionism: George Steiner's 1985 es- say "Our Homeland, the Text." The basic question out of which the book proceeds is "how the reacquisition of the spatial dimension has affected the Jewish literary imagination in the twen- tieth century... " (p. 19) What Ezrahi means is: What happens when secular Zion- ism precipitates an apparent Jewish eschalon by re-establishing Jewish sovereign- ty in the ancestral homeland, and a place that over the millennia was idealized and romanticized becomes an accessible, conflict-ridden reality? Ezrahi studies this question in literary terms, examining it under the twin rubrics of "Jewish journeys" and "Jewish geographies." Jewish journeys, i.e., fictional travel narratives, are treated longitudinally. Four are discussed. Though poetry and not prose, Halevy's "Songs of Zion" con- stitute for Ezrahi "the earliest and most enduring model" of "the tensions between desire and fulfillment as they begin to play themselves out in a poetics of exile and return" (p. 38). Mendele's Travels of Benjamin the Third, a latter day Jewish Don Quixote, parodies, in Ezrahi's reading, the Zionist project of repatriation. Ben- 157</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews jamin's "ultimate return to his point of origin thus is as much a return to the logo- centric culture of the European Diaspora as it is an eschewal of political activism or religious messianism" (p. 66). Agnon's In The Heart of the Seas becomes, by default, the ur-text of which Benjamin the Third is the parody, or the epic that the earlier work mocks" (p. 89). "It does more than explicitly perform the master nar- rative of the Zionist century, for it proceeds by incorporating and superseding its own subversive subtexts" (p. 102). Sholem Aleichem's Motl the Cantor 's Son ex- emplifies a permutation of the Jewish travel narrative into a "third, non-epic mod- el" where the journey arrives not in Zion or Galut but, quite simply, in Diaspora (p. 103). Ezrahi insightfully connects this narrative to such seemingly disparate works as Kafka's Amerika and Kazin's A Walker in the City. In "Jewish geographies" Ezrahi reprises her long-standing engagement with the Holocaust by studying modalities of literary responses to the destruction of the East European Jewish cultural homeland. Here she proceeds latitudinally, noting that "over the last fifty years, what was destroyed has become an authentic origi- nal that can be represented but not recovered" (p. 138). And so we see in the late- twentieth-century writers she studies-Celan, Pagis, Appelfeld, I.B. Singer, and Philip Roth-the same process of disengagement and separation from the holy sites, and then of sub- stitution, reinvention, and mimesis, that evolved in the centuries following the destruction of ancient Jerusalem. Although the streets of Lodz are not sanc- tified in collective memory as were the hills of Zion, they became accessible to pilgrimages real and imagined, ritual and literary, as an unredeemable and indestructible ruin (p. 139). Space prevents me from outlining the details of the readings. Suffice it to say that in doing them, Ezrahi makes good on the warning she issues in the very first sentence of her introduction: "This book ... has a tendency ... to wander off." The discussions pick up and incorporate a diffuse surfeit of issues, narrato- logical and cultural, and everywhere show that Ezrahi is not only at home in the various western Jewish literary traditions, but that she has read enormously on each of the figures and subjects she treats. If anything, she has read too much, or she has used too much of what she has read. At times supporting material from other critics and sources tends to overwhelm and drown out her own voice. Stylistically the writing is often given to turgid abstractions, as in: What Philip Roth's late fiction suggests is less a cultural revolution than a re- configuration, from within the American purview, of the dichotomy between 'original' and 'imitative' space-between place designated as real, and therefore nonnegotiable, and places designated as spots on blueprints that are infinitely ne- gotiable. It is Diaspora as polemic option and aesthetic process rather than as a cultural canon or a 'way of life' that I want to consider here (p. 222-223). Come again? There are, however, more fundamental problems. To really appreciate what 158</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Ezrahi is trying to do with a given writer the reader would have to have read all the works she discusses, and in the original, even though the texts are cited in her En- glish renderings. Further, I question her method of showcasing one work from an author's corpus that is congenial to her larger thesis rather than seeing that work in the context of the whole corpus, especially when the corpus in its totality serves to qualify and even subvert what she is holding up from the one work.1 The effect is to place the works and writers she discusses into a Procrustean bed. The selec- tion of writers discussed fosters the impression that it is arbitrary, in the service of what is essentially a private canon. Celan is fine examplar of literary Diasporism, but why not Jabes? Roth fits too, but what about Malamud? And what about writ- ers and works that would call her notions of Diaspora into question, like Kafka and The Castle? And, most tellingly, why not treat some Israeli writers who contend fictively with the quotidian reality of the unrealized promises of the Promised Land from out of their lived Israeli experience? These and other conceptual and theoretical problems abound, and they have been pointed out elsewhere (see Prooftexts 20:3 [Autumn 2000]). They combine to make this a book of prodigious research and limited utility. James S. Diamond Princeton University Princeton, New Jersey 1. This is particularly true of Ezrahi's treatment of Agnon and Philip Roth. In the case of Agnon she is aware that works like Temol Shilshom subvert the implications of Bilvav Yamim but she veers away from the implications of this fact, probably for fear of damaging her claim for the latter. And though she has read much, she seems not to have taken into account Barukh Kurzweil's seminal treat- ment of shivah me'uheret (late return) and how he reads Bilvav Yamim. Kurzweil notes that there are many kinds of "return" in Agnon, certainly more than Ezrahi observes, and the conclusion to his study of the journey in Agnon bears citing here: "Any attempt to reduce [or confine, JSD] the topos of 'de- parture/arrival' and 'home' in Agnon's fiction to the sphere of religious tradition is testimony to a to- tal misunderstanding of Agnon's epic enterprise" (Masot cal sippurei shai 'agnon, Tel Aviv, 4th enlarged edition, 1975, 228.)</page></plain_text>
