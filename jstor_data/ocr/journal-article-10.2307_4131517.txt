<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review 28:1 (2004), 205-212 FROM MYTH TO HISTORY* by A. B. Yehoshua If we were to unravel the foundation of Jewish identity into its primary com- ponents, we would discover that beyond the religious commandments, beyond the various national sentiments, beyond the sense of belonging and connection to the Land of Israel and the Hebrew language, beyond certain historical and family memories that uniquely determine the Jewish identity of each individual, the com- mon basis of all Jewish identities, in their various dosages and strengths, comprises several fundamental stories-stories that have shed any clear indicia of historical time and place and have become myths, metastories, which can no longer be changed, only interpreted. These myths, such as the binding of Isaac (the akedah), the story of the exodus and other bible stories, the stories of the destruction of the Temple (and recently, in a certain sense, the Holocaust), have become the infra- structural components of Jewish consciousness and identity, both religious and secular. They have served for millennia as effective ingredients in the preservation of the identity of many Jews, scattered among various lands and continents, in the midst of various peoples and religions and assorted civilizations, and for centuries without being specifically dependent on the clear historical context of a defined territory or language. These myths are the most primary basis for the existence of diaspora Jewish identity, which makes possible the preservation of Jewish identi- ty "outside history," in the famous phrase of Gershon Scholem, notwithstanding the terrible toll that this existence has taken on the Jewish people in the end. The power of these myths lies in the fact that one's connection to them can be imme- diate, in all places and at all times, and beyond their original linguistic form; this connection finds succinct expression in the sentence, "In every generation, a per- son is obligated to regard himself as if he himself left Egypt." Zionism is defined as a return to history, a long, slow attempt to exchange gradually Jewish/Israeli consciousness for a consciousness that is historical, in the ordinary sense of the word; in other words, for a consciousness that is tied to the flow of true chronological time; a consciousness that is tied to a defined place and to a unique linguistic expression; a historical consciousness that also recognizes the histories of other peoples, compares itself to them, and examines itself practi- cally and morally with this yardstick; a consciousness that subjects itself to criti- cism and examination in the interest of extrication from a sense of fatefulness, and of a return to real historical activity that leads to change and progress. In this process, we must struggle with the very powerful myths that control * Translated by Harvey N. Bock ? 2002 205</page><page sequence="2">A. B. Yehoshua our lives and try to confront them critically, expose their moral quality, and un- cover their problematic meaning regarding the shaping of our consciousness and life. I wish to provide an example of this type of confrontation through an exam- ination of the story of the akedah, which is one of the most important myths in Jewish consciousness-a fundamental and formative myth in all senses. I would be so bold as to say that this myth is more important to Jewish identity than the crucifixion myth is for Christians; for while the myth of Jesus' crucifixion is fun- damental only to the religious identity of Christians, the akedah is of great impor- tance and meaning for both the religious and the national identity of Jews. This myth has been the subject of a great deal of commentary and discussion. Many de- tailed academic deliberations have dealt with both its sources and the many ways that Jews and non-Jews have interpreted it over the generations. In this context, I do not intend even to touch upon the vast body of interpretive material-histori- cal, theological, philological and literary-dealing with this myth; not because I do not greatly value this interpretive material, but precisely because of the classi- cal nature of the story, which permits each of us to approach it directly and freely, as does any classical composition. When we bestow upon a composition the hon- orific "classical," we mean that above and beyond the circumstances of its com- position in a particular period and historical and cultural context, it has transcended its time and also taken on great meaning, urgency, and relevance for those of us living in a different period and within completely different cultural and value codes-as if it had been composed only now. Thus, for example, we label as clas- sic Greek tragedies that were composed more than 2,500 years ago. We attend and thrill to the compositions of Shakespeare, Dante, and Cervantes and feel that they say something meaningful and important concerning our current lives, hundreds of years after these authors' deaths. None of the vast changes that have occurred over these years in human thought, understanding of the world, and moral values has rendered these compositions irrelevant to us. On the contrary, we find deep meaning in these compositions precisely when we come to absorb and interpret them in the context of our current, modern world-view. Someone may come and tell me, for example, that the source of the akedah story is a Babylonian tale that has undergone a Jewish transformation, or that in a particular period the Rabbis tried to interpret it in some way or other. This is well and good, but it does not prevent me from approaching the akedah story as if it had just been composed, and as if I were reading it for the first time and were called upon to interpret it in accordance with my best intellectual and emotional under- standing. For this story has been at the core of Jewish consciousness for thousands of years. It is an extremely important part of Jewish prayer, connected to the religious ritual of Rosh Hashanah and to the shofar blowing that stands at its center. In the Middle Ages, during the Crusades and collective acts of suicide by Jews, this story was very important in lifting the Jews' spirit. Many poems and stories of the early Zionists referred to it. The akedah story is what gives Mount Moriah its extreme holiness, connecting it to the First and Second Temples. Thus, it intensifies the holiness of a place that from a polit- ical standpoint serves today (because of the Al-Aqsa mosque) as an element of the 206</page><page sequence="3">From Myth to History terrible, bloody dispute with our neighbors. The Jewish akedah story is connected to the theological tension with Islam, through Islam's replacement of Isaac with Ishmael. The akedah story is connected to the "covenant between the parts," in Genesis; with the national patriarch, Abraham; and with other important aspects of Jewish existence. Accordingly, when I set out to analyze this multi-layered sto- ry-first, by understanding its plain meaning, and then, by determining what con- clusions can be drawn from it-I do so not only out of intellectual curiosity, but also out of a deep concern for the construction of the Jewish identity that all of us maintain within ourselves as Jews. The story of the akedah, in Genesis 22, is well known. The first detail that strikes the reader concerns the blessing given at the end of the drama. "I will ... make your descendants as numerous as the stars of heav- en and the sands on the seashore." Abraham's simple and obedient faith in God, which had him willing to slaughter his son without any reasonable explanation, was, according to the story, supposed to bring him and his descendants a great blessing of fertility and numerical fortification. But this blessing and hope have evidently not been realized. The Jewish people's numbers have remained extremely low among the nations. Considering the Jews' great antiquity, this blessing may have been fulfilled in their survival, but it was not fulfilled in their numbers. This is a minor detail that does not go to the heart of the story. However, it gives an indication of the type of dialogue and the nature of its strength and effec- tiveness in the real world. If the criterion of great fertility and numerousness is an ethical criterion as well, then at least according to the biblical storyteller, Abra- ham's successful trial seems not to have brought the hoped-for reward-but its op- posite, perhaps. Now I wish to address the heart of the story, which raises serious moral dif- ficulties-as I am hardly the first to observe. If I were a religious person-that is, if I believed in individual divine providence, and in the existence of a God who ac- tually spoke to Abraham-the akedah story would be very damaging to my reli- gious faith from a moral standpoint, presuming that it is a fundamental assumption of all religious faith that God is not only the source of life but also the source of morality and justice. In general, of course, no religious faith depends solely on morality; and once such a faith comes into existence, it is generally able to over- come moral obstacles. I could say, with irony, "thank God" I am not a religious person and I am consequently exempt from having to justify religiously this im- moral story. However, I must confess that even if religious stories were unim- peachably moral, and God spoke only with the voice of the prophet Isaiah, or even with the voice of the world's greatest moralists, I still would not believe in the ex- istence of divine providence. I might respect such a religion more, but I would not believe in it. I know that it makes believers uncomfortable to hear a secular person de- clare that he does not believe in the existence of God, and that he regards God as only a human concept, which different people employ as a means of expression. I must emphasize, however, that my disbelief stems from reservations not about Ju- daism but about religion in general, from an inability to believe that there is in fact an objective, divine system that maintains a religious connection with mankind. 207</page><page sequence="4">A. B. Yehoshua Had I been born to a Christian, Moslem, or Hindu family, I would apparently still find myself in the same position of disbelief. I find disbelief natural and logical, and faith unnatural. That is why a believer must summon special mental resources to believe something that is difficult to grasp on the basis of common sense and real facts. The fundamental, key word that serves religion is not knowledge, but faith, and, philologically, faith is not something objective, but subjective. It never leaves that domain. So, let us return to the akedah story. In my opinion, it presents extremely se- rious moral problems for any religious person who believes in God and thinks that God is also the source of morality and justice. Abraham's behavior is morally trou- blesome. It is true that the opening sentence, "God put Abraham to the test," soft- ens God's cruelty, as it indicates that from the outset there was no intention to carry out the unfathomable slaughter of Isaac; this was just a practical experiment to test Abraham's faith. A God who carries out this type of experiment is, of course, still subject to criticism. When you perform an experiment, you intend to place the sub- ject in a real situation; otherwise, the experiment is worthless. Had Abraham known in advance, based on his knowledge of God, that this was merely a trial, and that God did not seriously intend that the slaughter of Isaac be carried out, all of the experiment's force and value would have been lost at the outset. There must be some real dimension to this trial. Abraham was supposed to believe that God seriously intended what he said. And, since this was about Abra- ham's son Isaac, a minor whom Abraham knew had committed no sin, the very possibility that the boy would be slaughtered, unjustly and for no reason, theolog- ically expands the range of God's wickedness. God clearly signals here that he can be categorically unjust. Without addressing Abraham's reaction, the mere readi- ness of God to subject him to such a trial is extremely flawed from a moral stand- point; even after it has become clear that this was just a trial, its very possibility signals that there can be other, real, immoral trials. The theory that the trial was conducted in order to teach Abraham that there is no human sacrifice in Judaism is incorrect. First, human sacrifice is not men- tioned anywhere in this story; second, Abraham is praised for his readiness to sac- rifice Isaac and is in no way chastised for his readiness to slaughter his son at God's command. Abraham's moral flaw is greater than God's. Without argument, ques- tion, or plea, Abraham is prepared to carry out the unfathomable and absolutely unjust divine edict. To prove the magnitude of his faith and confidence in God, he is ready to abandon his reason and his sense of justice and to engage in the mur- der of an innocent. Here, there is no doubt that Abraham knows very well that Isaac is innocent. Abraham's readiness and absolute obedience to the divine edict have inspired many horrible acts performed in the name of divine edicts. From a reli- gious standpoint, Abraham provides an absolutely immoral model for future gen- erations, and in so doing, he casts a dark shadow over the fighter for justice whom we saw in his argument with God over the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, with his just argument, "Will You sweep away the innocent along with the guilty?" and "Shall not the Judge of all the earth deal justly?" It is therefore no wonder that such a morally dubious story went unmen- tioned in the prophetic books, and that Christianity, which was aware of the sug- 208</page><page sequence="5">From Myth to History gestive force of this story of slaughter, made a moral correction to it in the story of Jesus' crucifixion. Jesus is ready to sacrifice himself for his faith in God. Here, despite a certain moral difficulty, there is a difference. A person sacrifices himself (even though he regards himself as innocent), but he does not arrogate the right to harm someone else. It is therefore no wonder that the crucifixion story, which from an anthropological standpoint was perhaps built on the akedah myth, has resonat- ed so widely. Are we then left with an absolute moral negation of this myth, which we must categorically reject? It seems to me that this story can be partially morally "res- cued" when examined from a clearly secular position that holds that there is no God and that Abraham acted with complete autonomy, on the basis of his own con- siderations and his own will. Abraham left his father's house as an adult, for the sake of his new faith. He severed his family/tribal ties, left his homeland and his father's house, turned his back on his ancestral faith, and went to a foreign land to establish a new faith. Now, as his days wane, and after his wife, Sarah, has at long last borne him a son, he may certainly speculate that his son is liable to do to him what he did to his own father, that is, leave his faith in the one God, and turn to other gods and, perhaps, another land. His son, Isaac, could on the basis of his own independent thinking do what his father, Abraham, did to his grandfather in Haran. How can Abraham ensure that nothing like this happens with his son? In- stead of turning to the residents of Canaan and convincing them of the righteous- ness and truth of the new faith, he chooses the easy way to ensure its continuity, by pouring it into the generational chain that will emerge from his offspring. Ac- cordingly, he stages a play through which he tries to ensure his faith's continuity in his son Isaac, as well. So he takes Isaac up to one of the mountains, builds an altar, ties the boy up, lifts the knife-as if to say, "For my part, I can, and perhaps am even ready to, kill you. As much as I love you, I am also prepared to kill you, perhaps, because of the mere possibility of your changing, and to do to you what my father, Terah, failed to do to me to bind me to his faith." Then, at the last minute, he stages a sort of recoil, as if he has just heard God's voice through the voice of an angel, telling him, "Do not raise your hand against the boy, or do anything to him." In other words, the message to Isaac is: "For my part, I was prepared to kill you. But the God in whom I believe had compassion for you and did not permit me to kill you. Henceforth, know, Isaac, that you owe your life not to me, your father and prog- enitor, but to the God who rescued you." In other words, he wants to implant in Isaac the continuity of his faith in a single God not only intellectually, but also existentially. Thus, he says in effect, "Whether you like this God of mine or not, whether this faith appeals to you or not, you must continue it and accept it, because your entire existence and life are yours thanks to him. If you do not believe in my faith, you are doomed to extinc- tion." This dramatic move was carried out by Abraham on the day of the akedah, with all of its props: altar, branches, raised knife, and purported "rescue" by the 209</page><page sequence="6">A. B. Yehoshua voice of an unseen God; it is entirely the autonomous, manipulative activity of Abraham, with God's voice only an internal voice, as always found in every reli- gion and faith. According to this secular interpretation, from the outset Abraham did not in- tend to kill Isaac, but rather to threaten and frighten him. He is therefore innocent of the charge of murder, or of blind obedience to a "divine" order to commit mur- der. He is not innocent, however, of frightening Isaac. Indeed, "Isaac's fear" is a dominant concept that arose in the akedah story and appears in prayer and liturgi- cal poetry. Chaim Guri expressed it well in his famous poem, "Heritage." He writes in the last stanza of the poem: Isaac, as we are told, was not sacrificed. He lived many years, Saw good things, until his eyes dimmed. But he bequeathed that moment to his descendants. They are born With a knife in their hearts. On Mount Moriah began the Jewish people's distinctive linkage, which in my view is a very problematic tie between Jewish religion and Jewish nationality, still in its embryonic, family form. This special connection is recreated anew by a forced repetition of the akedah ritual. Abraham's descendants bring themselves to situations of conflict with their surroundings, in which they are threatened with ex- termination and destruction,1 with the knife waving overhead, and at the last minute they are rescued, or are supposed to be rescued, by God's voice. Such a link- age, in which religion is connected to a specific familial religion, to "seed" in the biological sense, is created by Abraham to repair his own break in the biological chain through his abandonment of his father's house and family. He decided that this would not happen to his descendants, and he tied them with the double bond of religion and nationality. This connection was fortified once again at Mount Sinai, when a first na- tional group, a group of "rabble" in a primordial state, as yet without territory and almost certainly without a unifying language, was linked to a new faith in the desert. And, at each instance where the people threaten to rebel against the new faith that it has been given, such as the golden calf or the controversy regarding Moses' authority, the Bible raises once more the possibility that God will cause the destruction of the rebellious people and replace it with another. In other words, the existence of the faith comes first, and it exceeds national existence in importance. A recurring aphorism expresses this nicely: "Israel exists only in its Torah." When this linkage was greatly weakened during the First Temple period, this melding of religion and nationality was fortified anew during the first Babylonian exile, where diaspora existence in a non-Jewish environment serves to reconcile the two differ- ent codes. Thus, by means of a hostile environment around the Jews, whose exis- tence is in danger of extermination, the principle is once again fortified. In the end, 1.
