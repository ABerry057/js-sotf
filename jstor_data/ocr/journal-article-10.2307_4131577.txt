<plain_text><page sequence="1">Keith H. Pickus. Constructing Modern Identities: Jewish University Students in Germany, 1815-1914. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1999. 222 pp. Given the centrality of education for all programs to transform Jewish soci- ety and ready the Jews for civic integration in Europe, the disproportionate use modernizing Jews actually made of non-Jewish education, and the particular zeal of German Jews for Bildung, Keith Pickus' book treats an important theme: the identity of Jewish students in German universities. It sets out to explore how young adults constructed a sense of self when loosed from familial moorings and grouped with non-Jewish peers in an era of unprecedented openness as well as continu- ing hostility, an important question in itself that is also significant because the university-educated elite were disproportionately likely to lead or speak for the German Jewish community in its main defense organization (the Central Verein, led overwhelmingly by men trained in law) in the rabbinate, in welfare institutions and in political groups. Pickus uses some important archival sources: student publications and mem- oirs (particularly the holdings of the Leo Baeck Institute, New York). He makes a number of valuable observations: that organized anti-Jewish activity in German universities faced opposition, and not only from Jews; that despite the widespread hostility Jewish students faced, those who founded and joined Jewish student or- ganizations were not simply responding defensively to Jew-hatred but were part of a broader, affirmative struggle to create a German-Jewish identity in this era. He looks at students who joined or founded a wide range or organizations, from dueling societies to academic ones, Jewish and nondenominational, and rightly grounds the impetus of Jews-men, and once they were admitted to universities, women-to found or join such organizations in the German proclivity, in and out- side the university, in a desire for "active associational life" (p. 87, see too p. 145). Thus, even the founding of Jewish associations, far from demonstrating simple de- fensiveness or separateness, was an expression of acculturation, of "German- ness"-at the same time, Pickus insists, that it was a venue for asserting Jewish- ness. In this, he usefully applies categories of analysis developed by Shulamit Bolkov and David Sorkin. The book as a whole has a number of problems. For most of it, we lack a sense of who Pickus' subjects are. He writes of many organizations without telling us about their founders or joiners: where they were from; what disciplines they studied; their religious affiliations, if any; or how, if at all, their student activism 155</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review carried over into their later lives. Except for the photograph that adorns the book, the groups largely lack a human face; the book is less about students and their iden- tities than about organizations and their positions, treated in rather mechanistic progression. The lack of certain quantitative data is a persistent frustration: How many members did the various student groups have (especially the Jewish or Jewish-dominated groups, e.g., Kartell Convent, Kadimah, Young Israel, Jewish National Association)? Pickus provides some tables for years and associations in which the number of Jewish university students was minuscule but does not pro- vide them for the main years and organizations of his study. One wonders what per- centage of Jewish university students (per university, overall) joined Jewish or oth- er associations, and how this compared with the membership rates of Catholics or Protestants or religiously unaffiliated students. Pickus tells us (p. 113) that more than fifty percent of the total student body remained "unaffiliated," yet he does not tell us if the same statistic held true for Jewish students, explicitly avoiding the im- portant question of whether Jews tended to affiliate more, less, or in the same pro- portion as non-Jewish students (p. 188, n. 1). Moreover, he tells us that Jewish stu- dents who did not join "Jewish fraternal" organizations tended to join "a scholarly association" (p. 128), leading this reader to wonder whether the distinction be- tween type of organization was less important than the act of joining or creating some form of association. There is a narrowness of focus that borders on the pedantic. Pickus discuss- es some student groups that had a heavy east European Jewish component and notes that "Jewish students from eastern Europe greatly contributed to the creation of the first national Jewish student association in Germany" (p. 104). Yet, aston- ishingly for a period when east European Jewish influence on German Jewish cul- ture was so important, he ignores the eastern students-who were, after all, "Jew- ish University Students in Germany," too-and proceeds to write about only the German-born ones (or, in the case of the Association of Russian Jewish Acade- mics, one). He tells us that one student group in Berlin founded by east European Jewish students eventually became indigenous, but he does not explore why and how this passage came about. He mentions the important Biennese Jewish student organization, Kadimah, yet he does not study it as a parallel phenomenon or mod- el. All this is an overly narrow approach to the question of German Jewish identi- ty in the Wilhelminian era, which, despite the book's announced timeline, is in fact about the Wilhelminian years. The memoirs he uses are analyzed consecutively in the fashion of explication de texte, rather than treated thematically or integrated into his narrative about the organizations, which might thereby have been humanized. Pickus makes a number of assertions that his analysis has not supported and misses crucial connections. He repeatedly states that various student groups pro- moted Jewish identity, yet he himself illustrates how vacuous a sense of "Jewish- ness" many of these groups had. Indeed, the struggle to identity the content of Jew- ishness was much of what this era was about, for Germans as for all modernizing Jews. Rather than protest overmuch for his subjects by asserting that they had a clearer vision than they in fact possessed (or is, perhaps, fair to expect at that point), Pickus should have acknowledged and problematized this question and contextualized it in the larger struggles of modern German Jewish culture. Pickus 156</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews says (pp. 95-96) that the members of a Jewish student group in Breslau adum- brated a definition of dual German and Jewish identity that would later become the credo of the Central Verein, yet he does not elaborate on the significance of this connection. It is not even clear he is claiming there was one: Were the founders of the CV aware of and did they draw upon this precedent, or had this kind of think- ing about German Jewish identity become broad currency in German Jewry by the time this student group as well as the CV were formed? Pickus does not even tell readers what the CV was. He notes but does not explore the similarity between the arguments of two student organizations about Jewish national identity and the split on this same question between the CV and the German Zionist Organization, there- by missing another opportunity to have shown the larger implications of his sub- ject. Pickus' writing is clear, although there are some hackneyed images that should have been cut. He asserts that "a social history of German Jewry is still lacking," (p. 108) a curious statement given the work of Jacob Toury, Monika Richarz, Steven Lowenstein, and Marion Kaplan, among others, as well as the re- cent multivolume series edited by Michael Meyer, which pays serious attention to social history. In sum, there is value in this work and, at the same time, a need for its broad- er implications to be drawn so that we may come away not just with facts about Jewish university students but with new knowledge about German Jewry and Jew- ish modernity.
