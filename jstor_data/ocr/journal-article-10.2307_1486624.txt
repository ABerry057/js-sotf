<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Raphael Patai. Robert Graves and the Hebrew Myths: A Collaboration. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1992. 468 pp. This is not a book in the usual sense of the word. There has been no shaping or selection in its production. Everything but the kitchen sink has been thrown into it. Raphael Patai is an original and very distinguished scholar, but we do not need to know about trips he did not make or how much his Mercedes cost. Furthermore, much of what is interesting and important is repeated ad nauseam. All of this makes the book hard to get through. However, the story and the central themes are so fascinating that it is well worthwhile. Late in 1947 Robert Graves wrote a "fan letter" on the latter's Man and Temple in Ancient Jewish Myth and Ritual. From then until 1975 the two men corresponded with varying intensity and collaborated in writing Hebrew Myths: The Book of Genesis. Both men began their collaboration with the conviction that behind what they saw as the rationalizations and suppressions of the Bible lay a great store of myth and ritual. Although they clearly saw a relationship between the two, they were not "ritualists" in the sense that they saw ritual as the sole source of myth. They also agreed that a great deal of concern with femininity had been purged from the Israelite tradition. Patai did not go along with all of Graves's poetic fantasies, such as that of the patriarchal Indo-European cattle herders dominating the earlier matriarchies for whom the symbol was the queen bee (p. 202). In general, the collaboration between the enormously erudite poet and the broad and imaginative scholar was very profitable, and they produced a number of exciting and stimulating hypotheses. Although they were essentially interested in the background to the Bible and in the parallels and relationships between the Israelite tradition and what for Graves always remained "real," i.e., Greek mythology, the two writers placed more emphasis on later Jewish traditions rather than on the common background of Canaan and the Aegean in the Bronze Age. The most intense period of their collaboration was during the later 1950s. By this time not only 237</page><page sequence="2">238 BOOK REVIEWS were the Ugaritic religious texts available, already providing a bridge between ancient Israel and Homeric epic, but Cyrus H. Gordon's monograph Homer and the Bible, largely based on these, had published in Hebrew Union College Annual 26 (1955). The Ugaritic texts are mentioned peripherally three times in the book's 468 pages, and Gordon-who is a friend of Patai's-only once. Through repetitive and sometimes confused, Robert Graves and the Hebrew Myths: A Collaboration is a treasure house of useful information and fascinating speculation. It deserves to be read by both specialists and enthusiasts. Martin Benal Cornell University Ithaca, N.Y.</page></plain_text>
