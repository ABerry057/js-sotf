<plain_text><page sequence="1">GUENZBURG, LILIENBLUM, AND THE SHAPE OF HASKALAH AUTOBIOGRAPHY by ALAN MINTZ Columbia University I Haskalah autobiography, as S. Werses has surveyed it, is a wide field which includes such well known figures as I. S. Reggio, S. D. Luzzatto, M. H. Letteris, A. Gottlober, S. Y. Fuenn, J. L. Gordon, M. A. Guenzburg, and M. L. Lilienblum.' The fact that these names are well known-and known to us from works other than their autobiographies-is significant. Most of these works are accounts of the author's literary and cultural acti- vity, and they interest us now, if they do at all, as portals to a more complete comprehension of that activity. Reggio, for example, describes his call to Jewish learning and the progress of his career as a scholar; in provoking detail in the pages of Ha-maggid, Luzzatto gives an authorized version of the canon of his works; Letteris and Fuenn offer not so much portraits of themselves as reminiscences of such famous figures from the milieu in which they worked as Rappaport and Krochmal; and Gottlober deflects attention from himself in another way by confining himself to an ethnographic ac- count of the Volhynia and Podolia of his youth. In contrast to this concep- 1.

These two works are concerned with what might be crudely called the personal life independent of, or intermixed with, the public career; as texts, these autobiographies ask to be taken seriously for the intrinsic truth of the experience they portray rather than for their association with the famous, or not so famous, authors who wrote them. And so it is: we now honor Guenzburg more for 'Avi'ezer and less for his Devir and his historical works, and we honor Lilienblum's publicistic acti- vity because of the existential authority given it by .Hattot ne'urim. To sharpen the distinction between 'A vi'ezer and .Hattot ne'urim and the other autobiographies, we can profitably use Guenzburg's own terms in the methodological preface to his book. For Guenzburg there are two ideal types, biography and autobiography, which are distinguished not so much by the point-of-view (whether one is writing about oneself or about another) but by the nature of the subject. Biographies are written about men who have become famous because of their great spiritual powers or because of the outstanding events of their lives; it is the task of the biographer, according to Guenzburg, "to choose with wisdom and discrimination all that is lofty and precious in their life histories, as well as the spirit that urged them on to accomplish their wonderful deeds"2-in other words, to select from among a multiplicity of personal attributes those special ones that conduce to greatness. The autobiographer, in contrast, is positively for- bidden selectivity. He need not be a great man; what he needs instead of achievements is comprehensive self-knowledge and a commitment to truth so unflinching that there will be no hesitation in confessing any sin or short- coming. Of the biography type, Guenzburg says there are many examples in Hebrew-Nahmanides and Naphtali Herz Wessely, for instance (and, we would add, the self-told biographies of Reggio, Luzzatto, and others); of true autobiography, there have been very few, or more precisely, none in modern times until 'Avi'ezer. These categories, it need hardly be said, are not original with Guenz- burg; the mention of confessing should give away his indebtedness to the climate of assumptions concerning the genre created by Rousseau, the father of modern autobiography, whose ideas entered Jewish literature through the conduit of Solomon Maimon's autobiography. It is to Rousseau's simple 2. Mordecai Aaron Guenzberg, 'Avi'ezer (Tel Aviv, 1967, photoreproduction of Ist ed., Vilna, 1864), pp. 1-2.

Rousseau's primary influence was, of course, in identifying the autobiographical act with confession and sincerity-what our writers would call "the love of truth"-and in creating a literary norm that requires revealing what is indiscreet, foolish, and shameful in a life as well as what is noble, and that further requires that no dimension of the personal life remain above or beneath scrutiny. There are, however, two other conditions of Rousseauean autobiography which Hebrew writers had much more difficulty in assimilating. One is Rousseau's assertion, trum- peted in the famous opening lines of The Confessions, of the absolute origi- nality and unrepeatability of his experience and the literary account of it. "I have resolved on an enterprise which has no precedent, and which, once complete, will have no imitator."3 One need only mention the Haskalah writer's belief in reason, reform, and the correctibility of human behavior to know that he had a greater interest in stressing the typicality of his experience than its originality. It is the actual content of the Rousseauean confession which presented the most difficulties for the Haskalah auto- biographer. What is being confessed are the passions of the heart, the search for love, the continual attempts to satisfy a need for total intimate compan- ionship which includes physical union but goes far beyond it. In the face of confessions such as these, our autobiographers, Lithuanian scholars married at the threshold of puberty, must stand with empty hands: there was simply nothing in their experience which answered to Rousseau's preoccupation with passionate intimacy. In contrast to the novel, whose melodramatic conventions were satisfied by the most stylized and stereotyped portrayal of male-female relations, the conventions of autobiography required realism, a demand which meant in this case confessing the inability to participate fully in this central aspect of modern experience. In this way, the experimental representation of absence, insufficiency, and frustration in matters of love and intimacy in such later works of fiction as "Ha-Siddah," "Ba-boref," and "'Orva parab" is a direct legacy of autobiography. Just as the problem of Jewish autobiography was how to confess to sins that had not been com- mitted, so the problem of the novel would later be how to write a novel without romance. It is in Lilienblum's .Hattot ne'urim that this set of problems receives its 3. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, The Confessions, trans. J. M. Cohen (Baltimore, 1975), p. 17.</page><page sequence="4">74 ALAN MINTZ fullest articulation, and it can be said with some certainty that of all works of Haskalah literature it was .Hallot ne'urim-and perhaps it alone-that was returned to by the modernists as a living and inspiriting text. Precisely because Lilienblum is so important, Guenzburg becomes crucial, for had it not been for 'Avi'ezer, Hattot ne'urim would have been, if not impossible, then at least a very different book, for in the opening chapters Lilienblum explicitly cedes to that earlier autobiography authoritative coverage of childhood and early adolescence and on that basis takes leave to begin his story with the years of youth. For this reason and for its very considerable accomplishments in its own right, I wish first to discuss 'Avi'ezer and then proceed to its successor. II Mordecai Aaron Guenzburg (1795-1846) was born in Salant, Lithuania and earned a living as an itinerant tutor until he settled permanently in Vilna, where with the poet Solomon Salkind he founded a modern Jewish school and became one of the leading spokesmen for the Vilna Haskalah. In addition to 'Avi'ezer and Devir, a miscellany of translated letters and travel accounts, Guenzburg was best known for a popular and stylistically influen- tial series of histories of contemporary Europe, which included Toledot benei 'adam, 'Ittotei Rusya, and Ha-Sarefatim be-Rusya. 'Avi'ezer, which was begun in 1828 and published posthumously in 1864, is a statement about the ineluctable connection between impotence and apostasy. Impotence is viewed in part figuratively, as the enforced passivity inherent in the heder system of rote learning and in the enforced dependence on superstition and pilpul in matters of dogma and belief. But impotence is also taken very literally: as the sexual dysfunction resulting from the prema- ture confrontation with sexuality enforced by the system of arranged early marriage. The cumulative effect of these varieties of impotence, Guenzburg argues, was to deny him the inner strength necessary to stand up before the onslaught of metaphysical questions which assailed him upon reaching maturity and which brought him to the verge of apostasy, of which he was finally cured, together with his sexual impotence, by an outside agency in the person of an aging apostate doctor. This thesis is realized in the book's four part structure: three sections devoted to different aspects of impotence and a fourth presenting the cure and the philosophical affirmations it made possible. In its proportions the book is laid out as follows: section one, chapters 1-16: the heder and the formal education; section two. chapters</page><page sequence="5">GUENZBURG, LILIENBLUM, AND HASKALAH AUTOBIOGRAPHY 75 17-37: marriage and domestic politics; section three, chapters 38-41: faith and apostasy; section four, chapters 42-54: the cure. If 'Avi'ezer was concerned only with the figurative aspects of impotence it would hardly be distinguished from other didactic literature of the Has- kalah; but the depiction of real impotence, bearing a burden of humiliation that is intensely and inescapably personal, indicates the presence here of a subjective dimension that is strikingly new. As a literary work 'A vi'ezer con- tains two intentions or functions: one didactic and one confessional, the two representing the older and the newer autobiographical norms. The didactic intention is evinced in the use of the experience of the individual as an illus- tration of the larger abuses of the community; the function of discourse here is to move the reader, who is palpably apostrophized, to corrective action, and the rhetorical mode is neoclassical in its use of parable, generalization, and example. The confessional intention, on the other hand, is not to expose but to express; the function of discourse in this mode is to effect release from a burden of private distress and to gain sympathy for the history of a par- ticular individual; the rhetorical mode is protoromantic: since the purpose is to tell the story of a life, emphasis is placed on the production of a contin- uous narrative, to which such static elements as digressions and examples are subordinated. What is impressive about Guenzburg in 'Avi'ezer is his ability to manage both intentions, making them function together to pro- duce a transition work of high importance. The didactic intention is understandably most in force in the examina- tion of the heder years in the first section of 'A vi'ezer. The fact that this sec- tion consists largely of critical descriptions of the pedagogical methods of his several melamdim is very much in keeping with Guenzburg's eighteenth- century assumptions about education. After Locke Guenzburg believed, simply, that a child's mind is a clean slate that registers whatever associa- tions are impressed upon it. The immense formative powers accorded teachers and parents by this theory put the child in a much greater danger of victimization than any romantic theory that would have the natural self of the child struggling to emerge on its own. The kind of educational victimiza- tion Guenzburg describes-in addition to the unrelenting exposure to the caprices of adult will and to such idiosyncrasies as one melamed's obvious manic depression-involves the systematic denial of cognitive freedom and autonomy. As to method, the teacher can show the child how to make some- thing his own by understanding and reasoning it from within or he can give him a cheap sense of mastery through memorizing and copying, the path Guenzburg calls "living by theft" (p. 26). As to exegesis, the teacher can</page><page sequence="6">76 ALAN MINTZ demonstrate the use of reason in extracting religious truth from figurative and aggadic material or he can handicap the child's mind by leaving it for- ever chained to fancy and superstition. And as to curriculum, the teacher can nourish the soul with a mixed course of Bible, language, and Talmud, or he can leave the soul impoverished with an exclusive regime of Talmud study. When teachers refuse, as Guenzburg claims most of his did, to show the path to the true acquisition of knowledge and to its rational interpreta- tion and thus relegate the student to imitation and superstition, the child is unmanned and reduced to unremitting dependence. To give legitimacy to his pronouncements-and to the audacity of the autobiographical act itself-Guenzburg frequently uses in this section some of the conventions of the Hebrew ethical will (the ?avva'ah). The presence of a hypostasized son or student to whom the work is addressed makes it a dramatic act of communication in the present as well as a narra- tive of events in the past. It justifies Guenzburg's interrupting the narrative to address to his reader-beneficiary advice for the future in the form of les- sons reaped from the past and reflections on the enduring effects of early education.4 The narrative itself is of a certain kind which does not take on a continuous movement from the past toward the present. Rather, each chapter contains a generalized statement about one stage in life and then offers a dramatized illustration of it. In addition, each chapter contains a parable-usually an animal parable very much after the fashion of such writers as Erter-which expresses the truth of the chapter in compressed figurative form, as if to say that it is insufficient to rely upon statement and example alone to do the work of explanation. In concert these features con- stitute the very model of a neoclassical argument; first, a short parable whose relevance is at first not clear; second, the decoding of the parable in the form of a general statement of the subject's situation at a certain stage of childhood; third, a situational example; and fourth, a return to the present of the writing in which the author makes the reader-listener the recipient of the cautionary wisdom of his experience. Behind the story of marriage and impotence in the second section of 'A vi'ezer is the grand indictment of Eastern European society for collapsing the distance between childhood and adulthood and refusing to acknowledge the claims of adolescence. Guenzburg feels that by being asked to become a man overnight he was cheated of his youth, which survived only in occa- 4. Digressions, such as those on Christians and heretics (p. 44), class differences (p. 50), and marriage (p. 52), would seem to be modeled on Maimon's practice in the Autobiography.</page><page sequence="7">GUENZBURG, LILIENBLUM, AND HASKALAH AUTOBIOGRAPHY 77 sional acts of petty rebellion and theft by which he symbolically repossessed what was taken from him. With a fine eye Guenzburg describes the work- ings of the marriage system as a set of transactions in which each family tries to maximize its three basic sources of "capital": learning, ancestry, and money. In Guenzburg's case, his father prided himself overmuch on the value of the family's ancestry and in his son's fame as a scholar, and while he bided his time in search of a stunning match, the position of the family was greatly shaken by the shame brought on it by the conversion to Islam of a relative of the father. As a consequence, the boy was sold into bondage to a family of wealthy but vulgar tailors. Being traded like chattel is disabling enough, but in this section Guenzburg's powerlessness takes on the addi- tional quality of forced feminization. His transfer from the wise and bene- volent supervision of his father and his deliverance into the collusive society of his new wife and mother-in-law are sealed by his inability to perform his duties as a man. The ordeal of humiliation comes to a climax when, in a per- verse version of the solah ritual, he becomes dangerously ill after being forced by the women to drink a potion to restore his virility. He is finally rescued by his father, who sends for him to return to Salant. It is clear that what interests Guenzburg in these events is not the play of love and feeling, but the play of power and powerlessness to which human relations are reduced in the absence of other sentiments. Even the eventual reconciliation between the boy and his young wife is really a restoration of a balance of power which has nothing to do with romance. These scenes, highly dramatic and wonderfully executed, are, to the best of my knowledge, the first sustained treatment in Hebrew literature of the politics of domestic relations. Whether because of the dramatic interaction of these scenes, or because of the deep personal humiliation they explore, or simply because of the fact that there is a story pressing to be told, the effect is that the para- phernalia of neoclassical statement are swept away by the strong current of historical narrative. The conventions of the Savva'ah form with the frequent addresses to a son or student are conspicuously absent, as is the need to make generalizations and provide examples. A few parables do remain but they are used in a special way to control the flow of the story by heightening suspense at critical points. Later on in 'A vi'ezer Guenzburg recounts how the experience of reading the Josippon engendered a passion for history and a desire to make the writing of history his vocation. "And that is the only aspiration from all my youthful hopes," he writes with pathos, "that ever truly came to fruition" (p. 129). Guenzburg did indeed go on to become the writer who, more than</page><page sequence="8">78 ALAN MINTZ any other in the Haskalah, gave the Hebrew reader access to the drama of European history. Guenzburg's real contribution, however, was not as a his- torian but as a writer of history. The substance of his historiography is decidedly derivative, but his winnowing of the elevated diction of the middle Haskalah to make Hebrew a vigorous narrative instrument for dealing with war and political conflict was an immense achievement. What is exciting in reading the central sections of 'Avi'ezer is the sense that we are watching Guenzburg, under the pressure of describing the turbulent conflicts of his own history, forging that language which he will later use so effectively to describe the affairs of nations. The portrayal of apostasy in the fourth section is the most conventional: pilpul as a set of empty dialectics, Judaism's evasion of philosophical formu- lations, the stream of doubts that enter the mind once the first question is asked. What remains important here is the insistent analogy between this and the preceding section: just as the denial of feeling had led to dysfunction in the sexual sphere, so too the denial of spiritual nourishment has led to a breakdown in the sphere of faith. It is entirely uncoincidental that the man who cures one dysfunction should cure the other too. The author is put into the hands of a mysterious aged doctor, a convert from Judaism and a possible crypto-Sabbatean, who is well versed in modern medicine as well as in the alchemical sciences. The young Guenzburg is finally cured of his impotence, ending a long cycle in the book and causing great rejoicing in his household. But the spiritual cure takes much longer. It is a kind of talking cure, presented in a series of recon- structed Socratic dialogues in which Guenzburg is set on the right path con- cerning God and immortality in terms derived from Mendelssohn's Phaedon. The purpose of the dialogues is to relieve the metaphysical impo- tence of skepticism into which Guenzburg has fallen in his questioning of revelation and tradition. The aged doctor accomplishes his task by demon- strating that a belief in God and immortality can be secured through reason alone, and by understanding this the lad can become one of the enlightened, who know inner strength rather than emasculating dependence on received traditions. But to his credit Guenzburg realized that for his condition there is no full recovery. Just as he admits that his relationship with his wife will always be complicated and that he will always have to conserve his sexual energy, so he admits that the doctor's teaching has raised more questions than it has resolved and that his teaching will have to remain only a partial answer to be used alongside the tradition, which itself has not ceased to be compromised.</page><page sequence="9">GUENZBURG, LILIENBLUM, AND HASKALAH AUTOBIOGRAPHY 79 III As a text Hattlot ne'urim5 begins by presenting itself as the completion of another text. Of the genre of autobiography, in which the story of a life gets told because of its intrinsic significance rather than its association (as in bio- graphy) with the name of a great man, Lilienblum holds that there is only one genuine example in Hebrew literature: Guenzburg's 'A vi'ezer. 'A vi'ezer was exemplary and exhaustive in its analysis of the years of the heder and the years of betrothal in the life of a Lithuanian boy, but its account had stopped short of the trial of experience which follows in the years of man- hood and accomplishment. Now, fifty years later, as if there was to be told the story of a single collective life, another Lithuanian boy who has grown to a kind of maturity is prepared to complete the task. In a dozen pages, enough space to supply the relevant differentia of family background, Lilienblum dispatches the first fifteen years of his life- the span of years to which 'A vi'ezer was devoted entirely. The ground has been ceded to Guenzburg; what is relevant was said by him. Even in the first period of life to receive serious treatment in Hattot ne'urim, the ages between fifteen and twenty-three (1858-1866), one finds the same thematics of insuf- ficiency that preoccupied Guenzburg. Here too is the story of a young 'illui (talmudic prodigy) who is sold like chattel to a domineering and ambitious mother-in-law. Here too is the story of a mind which, parched by the aridity of Talmud study and strained by the extravagance of legend and lore, is forced to make its way from Maimonides to the more radical rationalists to the Haskalah writers and finally to apostasy. Here too the domestic theme and the educational theme are brought together in the figure of nocturnal emission. As the inevitability of apostasy becomes apparent, doubts are pushed back with redoubled piety; the young man attempts to rid himself of polluting thoughts so as not to endanger himself on the night of Yom Kippur, when a nocturnal emission is said to be a harbinger of early death. But on the morning of the holiest of days Lilienblum awakes to find that the dread event has taken place, a symbol for the eruption of irrepressible forces of both doubt and need. The 'A vi'ezer elements, however, are quickly left behind. A look at the disposition of the materials of Hattot ne'urim, expressed in terms of the ratio 5.

Section Number of Years Number of Pages Days of Confusion 15 15 Days of Darkness and the Beginning of the Transition 8 (to age 23) 40 Days of Apostasy 3 (to age 26) 80 Days of Crisis and 4 (to age 30) 130 Renunciation The Way Back 9 55 For Lilienblum, religious crisis is clearly no longer the central issue of auto- biography. The loss of faith, which takes place in the "Days of Darkness" section, came to fruition over eight years, which are dispatched in forty pages, while the new life after heresy, spreading over roughly the same num- ber of years, requires a treatment of two hundred pages. That a young man of active imagination and intelligence will, given certain circumstances, lose his faith is a fact altogether taken for granted; it is for some an event not nearly so catastrophic as it once was. The present question is the nature of experience in the aftermath of crisis and in the newly opened space of apos- tasy. Lilienblum calls this new space the 'olam ha-ma'aseh, the world of praxis and practicality; at issue is the passage from learning to doing and from religious mystification to acting in the world. The distinction between these two domains is rendered by Lillienblum's statement at the end of the work (2: 128ff.) that his life could be summarized by reference to four sins or failures. (The subtitle of Hatlot ne'urim is Viddui ha-gadol [The Great Confession].) Two were committed by his father: forced early marriage and a useless, impractical education. Two were committed by Lilienblum himself: uncritical devotion to the romantic Haskalah and a pointless involvement with a young woman. The domain of 'A vi'ezer is con- stituted entirely by the first two sins, and in as much as these are sins of the fathers against the sons the autobiographical discourse of 'Avi'ezer had to remain within the limitations of the Rousseauean ethic of sincerity. Rous- seau was willing to confess his frailties and humiliations, but only the better to excoriate the society that had inflicted them and to defend his version of</page><page sequence="11">GUENZBURG, LILIENBLUM, AND HASKALAH AUTOBIOGRAPHY 81 the essential self that had been thereby trodden down. In this version of autobiography confession and complaint are not exclusive. Similarly, we are persuaded by the sincerity of Guenzburg's story without ceasing to feel that this is sincerity for a purpose. The disclosure of impotence, in all its mani- festations, is surely an act of sensitivity and courage, but it is also an act which, beyond any self-therapeutic function, serves to point the finger of guilt away from the speaking subject toward those who he feels bear final responsibility: through parents to Jewish society as a whole. Guenzburg's decision to end his narrative with adolescence allows him to remain within the protective innocence of childhood. In contrast, Lilien- blum's determination to extend the autobiographical project into the years of moral autonomy, in which the consequences of the sins of the fathers persist but do not determine, offers no such cover. Because he acknowledges freedom over his own life, he must also accept accountability for it. In exchange for this burden it was given to Lilienblum to eclipse the older con- fessional ethic and produce a work that is an act of genuine self-confron- tation.6 For Lilienblum the achievement of such authenticity means the accep- tance of his failure to realize his freedom. He yielded to the blandishments of the Haskalah: he misspent his emotions in a confused attachment which was never consummated; he became obsessed with a fruitless fantasy of univer- sity study. In allttot ne'urim Lilienblum intends us to see the unfolding of a path along which these delusions are recognized as such and discarded, until a point of existential purity is reached at which expectation is finally renounced. Like all autobiographies, the form of Hallttot ne'urim is generated by the convergence of two axes of self: (a) the present self, which from a position of achieved knowledge, writes the text before us and creates (b) a series of past selves which change until they merge with the present of the writing. (That the time of the writing of the text is itself a duration during which the act of narration may alter the identity of the writing self is an actual possibility in Hattot ne'urim, one which will be returned to later.) Because in auto- biography the present self has the authority to arrange the past and valorize 6. In Sincerity and Authenticity (Cambridge, Mass., 1971), Lionel Trilling describes the French conception of sincerity as "telling the truth about oneself to oneself and to others; by truth is meant a recognition of such of one's own traits or actions as are morally or socially discreditable and, in conventional course, concealed" (p. 58). See also, Henri Peyre, Literature and Sincerity (New Haven, 1963). I use "authenticity" here in the Sartrian sense of acceptance of responsibility for one's liberty through avoidance of bad faith.</page><page sequence="12">82 ALAN MINTZ it according to its priorities-to assume, in effect, a sovereign retrospective point of view-it is crucial to be sure of the identity of the finished self. In the case of Hallot ne'urim, knowing who Lilienblum is at the end of the work is complicated by the fact that there is more than one ending. In 1876 Lilienblum published a book called Hatlot ne'urim, which brought his life through his thirtieth year (1873). The retrospective voice is that of a man whose life has ended and who surveys a vast cycle of self-deception and renunciation from a point of view from which no further development can be expected. However, in the early nineties Lilienblum wrote another auto- biographical document (published in 1899) which reopened the account of his life he had so dramatically closed many years before. This narrative, called Derekh teshuvah (The Way Back), picks up at age thirty and tells the story of how during the next eight years Lilienblum did indeed manage to pursue his secular studies in preparation for the university, only to have this enterprise undercut by the pogroms of 1881 and the new national con- sciousness they forced upon him. Derekh teshuvah ends with a resurrection to life; Lilienblum has been quickened from the slumber of alienation and renunciation and given a vocation of leadership in the life of the people, which has itself been reinspirited with an idea of renewed possibility. The complications arise from the fact that Lilienblum did not allow Derekh teshuvah to stand on its own but called it in a subtitle "Part Three of the Book Hallot ne'urim," the work he had published twenty-three years earlier. Thus for generations of readers the whole work in its expanded form could be read as a story with a "happy ending," a story tracing a passage from negation to affirmation, which was an adumbration in miniature of the future direction of Hebrew literature and the national experience. At this point, however, complication can become confusion. It is not overly rigorous to point out that the ending of Derekh teshuvah constitutes a retro- spective point of view for that composition alone. In light of this later know- ledge Lilienblum could have revised Hallot ne'urim proper, but he did not, and therefore that composition of 1876 remains an integral work to which Derekh teshuvah has the force of an addition but not a reorganization. We are therefore required to deal with .Hattot ne'urim in its own terms and then go on to its sequel. IV For some young men the onset of religious crisis resulting in apostasy must have been like the discovery of a dread disease which leaves nothing to</page><page sequence="13">GUENZBURG, LILIENBLUM, AND HASKALAH AUTOBIOGRAPHY 83 look forward to but the fatal spread of infection; for Lilienblum it was like being born again. In the substantial section, "Days of Apostasy," which deals with his life between the ages of twenty-three and twenty-six (1866-1869), Lilienblum demonstrates how successfully the Haskalah could function, for a time, as a substitute religion. The Haskalah gave Lilienblum a new set of dogmas in the tenets of rationalism, a new body of scripture in the writings of Mendelssohn, Krochmal, and the late maskilim, a new escha- tology in a vision of a society of enlightened manners and productive activity, in addition to a framework of social explanation which provided a comprehensive critique of Jewish society. Like socialism, positivism, aesthe- ticism, and many other nineteenth-century ideologies that were in fact secularized religions, the Haskalah made it possible for Lilienblum's apos- tasy to be experienced after a certain point as an arrival instead of a fall-a kind of successful deconversion. The Haskalah additionally gave Lilienblum something that a prospec- tive career as a fixture in the local beit midrash could not match: an arena for the dramatization of self. In the society of Vilkomir-the Lithuanian town of his inlaws in which his adolescence was spent--Lilienblum assumes the romantic role of both rebel and martyr: the rebel, purchasing suspect books, forming subversive societies, rallying the enlightened youth, and the martyr, insulted and persecuted, bravely enduring all the afflictions of ostra- cism, even to the point of being informed against to the Russian authorities and risking arrest. Even more significantly, the Haskalah encouraged Lilienblum to become a writer. For him the new pantheon was made up of writers and the new means of transcendence was writing. It was as a way of using his privileged individual talents in defending himself against his detractors that Lilienblum first took up writing, and it was the writing life which provided him with an alternative dimension of being which, though not remaining unaffected by the vicissitudes of the social life, would con- tinue to provide Lilienblum with a measure of transcendence. In the Hebrew periodical press, in which his name began to be well known, Lilienblum had achieved a kind of power and presence he never attained in his life. The subject of Lilienblum's writing in those years was religious reform, the question, as he put it, of the "joining of religion and life." Like other conservative unbelievers elsewhere in the late nineteenth century, Matthew Arnold among them, Lilienblum knew that the capacity for belief had been permanently impaired by modernity; at the same time he was deeply shocked at the prospective consequences for the preservation of culture if disbelief was allowed to run unchecked. His solution was to argue that if the</page><page sequence="14">84 ALAN MINTZ demands of religious observance could be lightened by removing the layers of rabbinic interdictions heaped upon the original biblical commandments, then observance could be rationalized and the wholesale abandonment of religion forestalled. For the purpose of his autobiography, the important burden of Lilien- blum's writing at this time was the implication that the correctability of institutions extended to the correctability of individual lives, and specifically to his life. Lilienblum was intoxicated with the possibility of his own per- fectibility. He trusted in the hope of undoing the effects of the education his father had imposed on him by following the career of the maskil, that is, by acquiring the rudiments of a gymnasium education, studying as an extern, and becoming a merchant or entering one of the useful professions. Such a career would require leaving his family and his shtetl and going off alone to the big city; far from being pained at this prospect, Lilienblum was eager to be translated to a great center of enlightenment like Odessa and to consummate the role of rebel and martyr by becoming an exile. Just before he was about to leave Vilkomir, at a time when the entire town had righteously cut off relations with him, Lilienblum found a source of sympathy and confirmation in the person of a young woman named Feyge Novakhovitch (referred to throughout as "N"). He was attracted to her company because she had maskilic leanings and was the only person in the town who was prepared to regard him as the persecuted hero he regarded himself, and also because in his eyes her existence was touched with an aura of romantic love and romantic independence. To a man of twenty-five who had been married from the age of fifteen and had the burden of three child- ren, the idea that someone like Feyge could fall in love was moving and inspiring, all the more so because she had survived being disappointed in love, remained single, and retained her sense of self-worth within shtetl society. It was to her room that he repaired during the days of his persecu- tion to sit with her and read together Mapu's 'Ahavat Siyyon and 'Ashmat Shomeron, and it was to her that he addressed an ode of gratitude and praise on the eve of his departure for Odessa (1: 207-10) . It is important to stress that the portrait of the writer as a young heretic- martyr is a reconstruction of Lilienblum's experience of himself during his last years in Vilkomir. At the time of the writing of Hallot ne'urim four to six years later, however, after the existential baptism of the Odessa experience, Lilienblum came to repudiate completely the person he had been during the days of apostasy and to view this earlier self as saturated with self-intoxi- cation and false consciousness. The problem of writing the autobiography</page><page sequence="15">GUENZBURG, LILIENBLUM, AND HASKALAH AUTOBIOGRAPHY 85 then became the problem of how to evoke the full poignancy of that self and its dramatizing ambitions and at the same time pass judgment on them and show the distance traveled to the present standpoint of achieved understand- ing; how, in other words, both to evoke and evaluate the past without losing the force of the disparity. If Lilienblum had chosen the conventional means of retrospective narration-the kind of story that inevitably reduces the past to variations of the sentence, "I mistakenly believed at the time that .. "-he would have granted the present the power and moral authority to vitiate the past even before it had been recalled to being. If, on the other hand, Lilienblum had bowed to the imaginative integrity of the past by allowing it to speak in its own voice dramatically through documents re- printed from that time, the opportunity for judgment would then have been lost. As a way out of this dilemma, Lilienblum chose to mix narrative and documentation, and the special disposition of these materials he arrived at served him well on several counts. Lilienblum, to begin with, was able to achieve a striking embodiment in language of his various selves by making maximum use of the stylistic gulf between the swelling voice of the young maskil and the illusionless voice of the mature autobiographer. A long letter dated Av 12, 1866 describes Lilienblum's attempt to establish a society for the collection of maskilic literature and his various persecutions for his efforts. He addresses his correspondent as follows: Now you will ask me, dear brother, in what way this society seemed worthy in my eyes? Incline thy ear, dear friend, to the utterances of thy beloved com- panion, who has been subjected to the insults of the upholders-of-vain-super- stitions, to the apostate, for whom the Torah of Moses has been a girdle for his hips and the Talmud a girdle for his loins. Let thy ears attend that they may hear his reply. (1: 138) It is hard not to be overwhelmed by the maskilic inflation of biblical diction here, especially in the use of locution instead of direct description ("Incline thy ear"), epithet instead of direct naming ("the upholders-of-vain-super- stitions"), and redundant parallelism ("girdle for his hips"/"girdle for his loins"). The passage is particularly resonant of the invocations to the great biblical songs of Moses, Balaam, and Deborah, and establishes an epic height that signals the recitation of heroic exploits or the delivery of a prophecy. Hardly noticed in such grandiloquence is the fact that it is being</page><page sequence="16">86 ALAN MINTZ mobilized for a purpose which in its essence is entirely apologetic. When the narrative comment, written in the mid-1870s, picks up after the letter has been quoted, Lilienblum observes: This letter, which I have presented with all the vanity and hideous expressions as I in my innocence used to write them, will clearly indicate everything that happened to me during that summer. Besides the uproar concerning me all over town, I was much pained to see my wife crying constantly over my having become an apostate and I was greatly concerned for the welfare of my youngest son, who at the time was still nursing at the breast, lest he should fall ill from his mother's milk, which may have been poisoned by the intensity of her anguish. (1: 151) The syntax of the passage is the linear syntax of historical explanation, not the posturing of epic reiteration. The sentences perform the function of elucidating circumstances, making judgments, communicating emotion; in general, the coefficient of feeling to statement is much closer to the bone. The language is conspicuously free of mediations and ornamental tropes and determines a kind of plain diction which provides for the expression of such unheroic emotions as anxiety and pain and for the mentioning of such homely details as nursing babies. In addition to making an explicit judgment of the discourse of the text it is commenting on, Lilienblum's retrospective narrative is radically revisionary in that it offers a substitute or supplemental account of the events described in the letter, an account that reveals the affective, existential dimensions previously denied or unreported. At other times the need for explicit judgment and revision is obviated by the simple proximate coexistence of the two styles, a juxtaposition that casts a light of irony and often bathos on what was once intended in earnest. A second method for mediating the relationship between past and pre- sent selves is control of the rhythm and the variety of the epistolary materials themselves. Having established the angle of judgment, about a third of the way through the apostasy section Lilienblum lets go of retro- spective narration altogether and gives himself to the reconstruction through letters of the miniature epic of the young Lilienblum's near crucifi- xion. The correspondence is with several older, established maskilim in the capital city of Kovno who are outraged by the young writer's plight. Lilien- blum describes how gossip and petty annoyances quickly grew into con- spiratorial meetings, which issued broadsides against him, calling for him to desist from writing for Ha-melis, stripping him of his pupils, and threat-</page><page sequence="17">GUENZBURG, LILIENBLUM, AND HASKALAH AUTOBIOGRAPHY 87 ening banishment and excommunication. For a crucial few pages when Lilienblum's fate hangs in the balance, Lilienblum himself disappears as a correspondent (1: 172-77). The drama of intercession on his behalf unfolds first through a frenzied exchange of telegrams, then two grave and rotund appeals to the chief rabbis of Vilkomir by a committee of supporters in Kovno, another telegram, and then a summarizing letter by Lilienblum supplying from his point of view a continuous account of the events that had been ominously hinted at by the more official communications. After the immediate danger subsides, there follows a series of letters to his supporters in which Lilienblum describes his apprehension over a new round of con- fabulations and threats (1: 182-88), and interwoven here for the first time are references to the young woman "N" that are all the more significant because they signal the first instance of diary entries rather than letters in .Hattot ne'urim. The drama is brought to a ringing climax when Lilienblum is informed against and hauled before the local police to explain the incite- ment caused by his articles; demonstrating to the Russian magistrate that the true message of the Hebrew articles is an appeal for the discarding of religious superstition among the Jews, he gains the admiration of the authorities and wins the day. Just how disingenuous is Lilienblum's telling of his story becomes evi- dent in the canny manipulations of pacing and point of view. (For the time remaining before his departure from Vilkomir the story is carried forward mostly in diary entries, with retrospective comment being formally paren- thesized in two specially titled concluding sections.) The cumulative effect is to recast Lilienblum's experience in dramatic, even melodramatic terms, complete with a courageous, persecuted hero who comes close to being thrashed by the enemies of reason but who triumphs in the end and becomes a romantic exile. In short, a kind of Enlightenment Purim spiel, with its classic reversal "from mourning to festivity." Now, it should be remembered that in the general prologue to Hattot ne'urim (1: 98-99), Lilienblum, like Guenzburg, argues that Hebrew autobiography should differ from biography in its commitment to tell the story of a subject who may have no great achievements to his credit but whose life experience is truly representative of the "Hebrew drama" of con- temporary life. The drama of other cultures may unfold in grand passions and strong feelings but the drama of Jewish life, Lilienblum contends, has no strong effects to show other than trouble and wretchedness. Its ruling humor is stupidity and it is built out of mistakes and folly. To believe that the cir- cuit of experience, crisis, and self-realization that the young Jew must go</page><page sequence="18">88 ALAN MINTZ through can yield anything other than the knowledge of the essential absence at the bottom of the "Hebrew drama" is simply to live in a world of illusion and bad faith. And what is this if not a monitory description of precisely the fool's paradise Lilienblum inhabited during his career as an apostate in Vilkomir: he staged a theatrical invention of heroic persecution and resis- tance; he believed there was high drama when in reality there was only the spectacle of stupidity. It is Lilienblum's method of composition not to tell us about his folly from the vantage point of later disillusionment but to recreate this specious sense of drama through the orchestration of contem- porary documents. V In the fall of 1869 at the age of twenty-six Lilienblum arrived in Odessa with all the fantasies of success that young men in literature have tradition- ally carried with them in their journeys from the provinces to the big city. Lilienblum saw himself sitting and learning European languages without worries or impediments; he saw himself completing a course of studies at an institution of higher learning; he saw himself returning home after several years crowned with good fortune, learning, happiness and fame; he saw himself achieving a life of gentility and reason, tranquility and peace of mind (2: 14). As in the case of other young heroes, the city did not yield graciously to his expectations. Although grateful to be released from the "fanatical" society of Vilkomir, Lilienblum was dismayed to find Odessa a city of mer- chants who paid lip service to culture but who had little real interest in it and who could be counted on to make Lilienblum feel suitably abashed when he appeared in their office to peddle copies of his writings. The small initial stipend provided him by his Kovno supporters soon ran out, and letters of recommendation to potential employers proved ineffectual; to meet his obligation to send some support to his family in Vilkomir Lilien- blum had to take on pupils as the only kind of work available to him. The result was that Lilienblum could make no progress in the elementary secular studies that were requisite for any higher learning. Lilienblum conspired with circumstance by persisting in giving over whatever intellectual atten- tion that remained to writing further articles on religious reformist themes for the Hebrew periodical press. Lilienblum's energies were additionally sapped by despondency over the monotony and dreariness of urban life; this was an anomic, faceless existence far removed from the flamboyant drama of which he had so recently placed himself at the center.</page><page sequence="19">GUENZBURG, LILIENBLUM, AND HASKALAH AUTOBIOGRAPHY 89 The conditions of Lilienblum's life did not change substantially during the remaining four years that filled out the time covered by the original ver- sion of Hallot ne'urim. There was a brief economic reprieve when Lilien- blum obtained a job as a subeditor of a Yiddish newspaper and there were worse times when his wife visited him in Odessa, but all in all the sum of Lilienblum's troubles remained constant throughout. The end result was that Lilienblum came no closer to acquiring the limited rudimentary educa- tion-not to mention the more ambitious achievement-he had dreamed of. Simply put, he failed. Hallot ne'urim, however, is not entirely a record of failure. Running across the grain of the account of arrested formal education is the story of a second kind of education, one that is concerned with the sustained "working through" of Lilienblum's response to his failure. Confronted with his own inadequacies and with the intransigence of the world, Lilienblum strove to understand the mechanism of illusion that had encouraged his own compli- city in his fate and to determine an existential stance to his suffering to which he might adhere with increasing force of will. The representation of Lilienblum's ordeal belongs in a sense to the category of existential literature in its nineteenth-century Russian variety because it is not concerned merely with a series of cognitive denials and affirmations-though Hallot ne'urim has been rifled for its "ideas" often enough-but rather with the reluctance of the self to do what it is told. Lilienblum proliferates theories of experience to explain and control the vicissitudes of his life, while at the same time he relapses into states of expectation and nostalgia that vitiate his intentions. These two aspects of the self create the troubled polyphony of this last, major section of the original Hallot ne'urim; the conclusion of the book finally succeeds in striking a note of unitary consciousness, though the costs and incompleteness of this achievement are everywhere apparent. The first illusion to be renounced was the belief that in his courageous leap from the beit midrash to the Haskalah Lilienblum had crossed the great threshold of life and arrived at a new state of being. Under the indirect in- fluence of new positivist-materialist currents in Russian intellectual life, Lilienblum soon realized that the threshold he imagined was there was illu- sory, and that he had never in truth stepped outside the same spiritual edifice; sitting in his seat in the old study house or wielding his pen for the Hebrew periodical press-what difference did it really make? It had been from the accomplished possession of this truth in later years-and with the full complement or irony it permitted-that Lilienblum told the story of his apostasy in the previous section; here in the account of</page><page sequence="20">90 ALAN MINTZ his first year in Odessa Lilienblum describes with moving immediacy the suddenness with which the enormity of his false consciousness had dawned on him. A letter to a supporter, Ezra Cohen, from December, 1869, demon- strates how total and unrelenting was Lilienblum's judgment of the essential continuities in his life: " . . . formerly, I was enamored of the Tosafists, the Tur, the Beit Yosef the Shakh, the Noda' bi-Yehudah, R. Akiba Eger, and others, and now I am enamored of Mendelssohn, Levinsohn, Krochmal, and the like; formerly I strove to comprehend the Talmud and its commen- taries and now I toil to comprehend the works of the new literature; for- merly I spoke against the Karaites, who did not observe the Talmud, and today I speak against charlatans and practicers of superstition; formerly I used to weep over the exile of the Shekhinah and today I weep over the per- secutions of our people; formerly I strove to disseminate the religion [dat] of the Talmud and today I strive to disseminate the opinions [de'ot] that are according to my lights" (2: 20). Lilienblum is particularly modern in his self-diagnosis. Contemporaries might have looked on the experience of breaking with the tradition in cataclysmic terms, either as revolutionary liberation or as a cosmic rent in the order of being-in either case the great dividing line in a man's life. Lilienblum saw what sociologists of religion and students of romantic literature now see in nineteenth-century conversions: not discontinuity but the displacement and reembodiment of varieties of the religious impulse. The reembodiment Lilienblum discloses had two aspects. The passage above is based on the claim that the new identity is homologous with the old; that is to say, there exists a continuity of function in the way in which persisting needs are fulfilled and the way in which they organized his present life. More significant is the claim that the nature and content of Lilienblum's activity as a Talmud student and as a maskil partook of the same essential realm of human experience. Lilienblum calls this the realm of 'iyyun, which he opposes to ma'aseh. Ma'aseh connotes materiality, practical accom- plishment, the exact sciences, and productive occupations. This last is the world of doctors, engineers, merchants, industrialists, the world of the good men in Kovno who saved him from his persecutors in Vilkomir and who alone believed in him and took an interest in his fate in Odessa. Gaining entry into the world of ma'aseh became Lilienblum's professed goal, though the barriers which separated him from it-Russian, Latin, German, mathe- matics, geography, as well as his own secret unwillingness-must have made the distance seem vast. Measured against this goal, Lilienblum's prolonged dalliance with the Haskalah not only counted for nothing but immeasurably</page><page sequence="21">GUENZBURG, LILIENBLUM, AND HASKALAH AUTOBIOGRAPHY 91 debilitated his capacity to separate himself from the world of books and ideas. One of the most dispiriting consequences of the crisis was Lilienblum's changed valuation of his identity as a writer. According to the Haskalah faith, the Hebrew writer was the successor to the great biblical singers, and as a practitioner of the reasonable and the beautiful, he was thought to occupy a kind of priestly role superior in moral authority to political or religious leaders. Though young Lilienblum's gifts may not have been of the sublime sort, he was a figure to reckon with in the small world of Hebrew literature, and it was his pride in his membership in that world which allowed him to survive his ostracism in Vilkomir and which won him the support and respect necessary to establish himself in Odessa. With his loss of faith in the Haskalah, he denied himself this last means of transcendence; the only thing he was good at and was rewarded for became a conspicuous form of 'iyyun. He continued for a time to write, but he knew his perse- verance was, according to the new goals, mere perseveration. Abetted by his despair over the condition of Russian Jewry and by the temporary absence of hospitable periodicals, Lilienblum's literary enterprise eventually ground to a halt. Lilienblum's rejection of ideologies and substitute religions was clearly produced not only from within his own experience. Advanced thought in Russian intellectual life in the 1860s, especially that associated with N. G. Chernychevski, demanded a "realism" that would expose and call into ques- tion the cult of art and abstract thought and any other form of transcenden- talism or "illusionism."7 The new realism was based on an abandoned belief in the truthfulness of empiricism and the scientific point of view and in the conviction that every certainty or fact, however much it is opposed by fan- tastic imaginings, must be accepted in their place.8 The most radical critic of the sixties was Dmitri I. Pisarev, whose brief career laid down the principles of nihilism: admiration for materialism and the natural sciences, historio- sophic optimism, radical individualism, the reduction of human motives to egotism, and the assault on aesthetics and "pure art."9 Pisarev saw his ideal of the critically thinking individual nowhere more evident than in the depic- 7.

To him the ideals that young people thrill to are so much romanticism and nonsense. He "feels a natural, un- definable aversion to phrase making, to waste of words, to sweet thoughts, to sentimental aspirations, and in general to all pretensions not based on real tangible forces.""' Though he loves no one, he is not a misanthrope; if people choose to attach themselves to him he does not drive them away, though he never relaxes his skeptical attitude toward human motives. He is, finally, possessed of the courage to live without the false comfort of tran- scendental beliefs-and to die without them, too. After jettisoning the surrogate religion of Haskalah romanticism, Lilien- blum aspired toward a reduction and steeling of the self along the lines of Pisarev's picture of Bazarov. But whereas Bazarov enters the novel with his enviably practical and self-sufficient character fully formed, Lilienblum enters this phase of his life history woefully unprepared for the pursuit of such aggressive autonomy. Caught in the toils of his profuse hopes and ambitions, Lilienblum, in fact, is just the kind of person Bazarov views with disdain, one of those "people who dream of love and useful activity, of the happiness of the whole human race, and yet are not capable of lifting a fin- ger to improve even a little, whether he be a doctor, artisan, pedagogue, or even a writer."'2 In his isolation from people Bazarov is protected from boredom, need and despair by the fullness of thought and by his work as a biologist: "observations and experiments on living nature, observations and experiments on living people fill for him the emptiness of his life."" Suffering through a purgatory of need and despair, Lilienblum in Odessa is entirely unprotected. Yet the same kind of emotional self-reliance and prac- tical activity become the goal of Lilienblum's efforts at reconstructing his life-a goal seen from across an infinite distance. Lilienblum in the end could never fully become Bazarov. Cognitively, Lilienblum did manage to achieve a nihilistic comprehension of the world, 10.

Ibid., p. 211.</page><page sequence="23">GUENZBURG, LILIENBLUM, AND HASKALAH AUTOBIOGRAPHY 93 and emotionally, he succeeded in overcoming his relation of need to other people. But when it came to central tasks of practical doing in the world there could be no success. It is the thesis of Hallot ne'urim that by their nature the conditions of Jewish life deny the individual the possibility of such fulfillment. Lilienblum arrived in Odessa in 1869 suffused with desire for the things of life he could not have; the autobiography is the story of the gradual narcotizing and eventual deadening of desire. The real ordeal of experience in Hallot ne'urim arises not out of the loss of faith in religion and its substitutes but out of the necessity to be reconciled in their aftermath to the reality of absence. Of the four years in Odessa (1869-73) the first is called by Lilienblum "the year of the great crisis" (he uses the German in Latin characters, "Krisis," as well as the new Hebrew coinage 'et ma'avar [2: 46]); the treatment of this year spreads over sixty pages, more than any other in the work. During this tormented season Lilienblum was tossed unrelentingly between the poles of desire and despair. His repeated ordeal took the shape of a fated circle of disillusionment. The circle begins with an uncontrollable profusion of fantasies and hopes about future success and happiness (associated with a cluster of terms: dimyon, tiqvah, hefe5); the impossibility of these fantasies brings on a wave of tearful self-pity (dema'ot and regesh), which finally issues in wretchedness, despair, and resentment (ye'ush) and then finally lapses back into fantasy. "I hope," writes Lilienblum, "I build imaginary, airy chambers and in my fancy fly to the heavens" (2: 40). "I desire, I seek, but I don't know what; I quest for the goal but I don't know what to call it" (2: 54). In the emptiness left by the excision of religion Lilienblum's soul is flooded with the kind of engulfing, blank desire which, released from its generating conditions, becomes its own substitute meta- physical presence. Given the miserable actualities of Lilienblum's life in Odessa, the flight of desire would abruptly collapse of its own weight. Lilienblum would come crashing to the ground, there to be assailed by swarms of unanswerable questions and overcome by nausea: "I loathed my family life, I loathed my loneliness, I loathed the new city [Odessa]. .... " Essential to the account of each breakdown is the mention of uncontrollable weeping. Tears are a sign of feeling (regesh) and Lilienblum uses them as a kind of metonymical marker of the critical stages in his effort to liberate himself from bondage to emotion. Weeping would give way to desperation and withdrawal into moods of black hopelessness in which Lilienblum would persevere until an onrush of desire would begin the cycle anew.</page><page sequence="24">94 ALAN MINTZ VI Lilienblum's second year in Odessa so reinforced the conviction of failure that the faculty of hope could never quite function in the same way. During this time Lilienblum hit on the idea of leaving Odessa and making a fresh start at a university in Germany. He won the support of his bene- factors in Kovno, who put him in touch with a potential sponsor in Ger- many, who in turn informed Lilienblum that he would be expected to know German and to undergo an entrance examination in ancient languages and in science (2: 87). Exhausted from working to keep body and soul together and from trying to strengthen his shaky hold on the Russian language, Lilienblum found these demands so beyond his capacities that the idea that he might never proceed beyond his present condition began slowly to be accepted. The growing despair over his own conditions was paralleled by a pessimism concerning the fortunes of the Jewish people as a whole. For years he and others had been enunciating the new ideas on the basis of which the life of the people should be rebuilt (2: 74-79). No one had listened; there had been few responses to his articles, and the conditions of the nation had not changed. Lilienblum had little reason to believe that his people were any more educable than he himself was. Finally, Lilienblum was coming to realize during this time that his relationship to the young woman "N" was impossible and had drained him of enormous reserves of feeling which could never be replenished. He was spent and he had nothing-and would never have anything-to show for it. Such a mass of disappointments had to have some effect on the tor- mented cycle of desire and despair. In the face of reality, it became increas- ingly difficult to conjure up fantasies of alternative futures. The frequent repetition of the words from the end of Job (41:1), "my hope has been shown in vain" (tobalti nikhzevah), indicates a degree of recognition of the purposelessness of striving for inaccessible goals. Lilienblum's liberation becomes possible finally only by the death of the heart. Throughout the great year of crisis Lilienblum longed for the time when his susceptibility to painful disillusionment would be dulled and when the seemingly unstinting flood of tears would abate. With each new trial or recollection of the past Lilienblum would measure the intensity of his weeping, reporting with relief at one point during that year that "the day is near when my heart will be a void within me" (2: 86). By the end of the fourth year in Odessa he was able to record in his journal (with exquisite autobiographical self-consciousness) for August 23, 1875: "Today marks a full year from the day on which I last</page><page sequence="25">GUENZBURG, LILIENBLUM, AND HASKALAH AUTOBIOGRAPHY 95 shed tears. This has been the first year of the death (lit. "freezing") of my emotions" (qefl'at rigshotai) (2: 123). The goal of Lilienblum's development in these years became the achieving of a stonelike state of complete renunci- ation (ye'ush mublat) (2: 96). The idea of ye'ush which once referred to the wretchedness, despair, and embitterment that were the inevitable results of his encounters with reality in his first years in Odessa, was now redefined to designate the new existential ideal: victory over expectation and the dread of future (pahad he-'atid). Along the path toward renunciation the question of the other could not be ignored. It would have been convenient if Lilienblum had been endowed with Bazorov's easy aloofness from human entanglements, but instead Lilienblum-though never in fact very entangled-inhabited an emotional world of extreme need. Having voluntarily rejected Vilkomir society, he had hoped to flourish within the admiring company of the enlightened in Odessa, only to find himself forced deeper into exile in a city that was in reality a commercial center whose inhabitants took nothing more than a polite interest in Lilienblum and the great issues he wrote on. He felt his deprivation keenly and shed his compromising tears over it. As Lilienblum's project of attempting to annihilate hope and need took shape, it became clear that he must strive to transform his wretched loneliness into sanguine aloneness, and that to do so would require a divesting of emotional ties and responsibilities, a virtual elimination of the transitive extensions of the self. Responsibility begins with the family. Lilienblum had been married for ten years and had several children when he was at the height of his heretical rebellion in Vilkomir at the age of twenty-five. Hallot ne'urim records the fondness he felt for his children and his unceasing efforts while alone in Odessa to provide support for the family he had left behind-deserted?-in Vilkomir. These signs of solicitude aside, the principal function of the family in Lilienblum's life was as an encumbrance.'4 Its support, in addition to his own, usually made it impossible to pursue any of his plans, and at the rare times that Lilienblum was free, he lived in constant dread of his family visit- ing him in Odessa and destroying the few scraps of independence he had gathered (2: 115). The felt exclusion of his wife's voice (or even name) from the text is a reminder not only of the autobiographer's autocratic control over his narrative but also of the truth of Brenner's observation that Lilien- 14. What could be more pathetic than Lilienblum's writing a long poem on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of his marriage called "A Prisoner's Lament" ('Enqat 'asir, 2: 196-203)?</page><page sequence="26">96 ALAN MINTZ blum's illusionless knowledge of himself did not mean that he was capable of knowing anyone else.'" In a letter of August, 1871 Lilienblum addressed to his wife his grave denunciation of Jewish marriage (2: 89-95). He prefaces his remarks with the pathetic observation that this letter marks the first time in their twelve- year marriage that their conversation will rise in the substance above the level of such domestic exchanges as "Is dinner ready? Are the children asleep?" In Jewish life, according to Lilienblum a man needs a wife to fulfill three functions: to relieve sexual desire, to give birth to sons, and to keep house. For a Jew a son is only a "kaddish" and for Lilienblum the recitation of the kaddish is as efficacious for the dead as the recitation of tebinnot for the living. If a man has children, he cares for them and grieves for them if they die. But to want children in the first place can only be narcissistic. The other two functions of Jewish marriage, sex and housekeeping, Lilienblum says very simply can be bought elsewhere. Because for Jewish men women are commonly no more than this-servants and chamber pots ('avit shel shofokhin)-they are interchangeable and mourned over no more than a bathhouse that burns down. There is potentially one role for which the services of a woman cannot be hired: the role of a helpmeet, the 'ezer ke-negdo. What a man needs most in life is a partner, a companion with whom to share the joys and burdens of a life. The success of such a partnership, like any similar arrangement in the business world, is predicated on a pooling of equal resources by both parties. In his own case, Lilienblum argues, not only typically from the beginning was his marriage never understood as an emotional partnership but from the first days of his heresy there began to be created in him an inner world of experience which was literally unimaginable to his wife, naturally taboo and emotionally turbulent. It was not just the subversive content of Lilienblum's experience that was the problem; the fact of the very existence of a space of differentiated individuality created a margin of subjectivity which existing social arrangements could not adequately handle.'6 It was within this space that Lilienblum's curious affair with Feyge Novakhovitch, the elusive "Maiden N," unfolded. The facts of the relation- ship are simple enough: during his embattled last six months in Vilkomir, Lilienblum drew on Feyge's sympathetic reassurance, and upon relocation 15. Kol kitvei fH. Y.

What the meaning of this relationship was for the development of Lilienblum's self as presented in ffallot ne'urim is unclear. On the one hand Feyge seems to have been Lilienblum's grand passion, the subject of grand poetry, the "conqueror of his heart," and he the lover who had fallen into the "snare of love" (2: 128); on the other hand is the startling fact that the relationship had no existence other than an epistolary one: during all the years in Odessa-according to Lilienblum's account-he never saw Feyge nor did he take steps to effect a meeting or even suggest one." As far as Feyge was concerned this was not enough. She was passionately devoted to Lilienblum and wrote to him urging marriage. The series of reasons Lilien- blum gave for backing away from the idea casts light on the role that this act played in the larger drama of renunciation. Marriage, to begin with, meant the assuming once again of family responsibility, and this was precisely what Lilienblum was trying to disentangle himself from in order properly to set about his studies. The goal of freedom could not be served by new encum- brances (2: 68-71). Although he admits that in his last days in Vilkomir he had grown to love Feyge desperately, he was incapable of disclosing his feelings because as a typical product of the world of the beit midrash, an innocent kloyzner, he could not deal with the shame of telling a girl he loved her and because, given the ideas about romance he had picked up from books, he considered it impossible that a woman like Feyge, whose heart had been broken by another man, could ever love again (2: 104-5). By the second year in Odessa, Lilienblum realized that his feelings for Feyge were an essential part of the prisonhouse of emotion and fantasy (regesh and dimyon) he was trying so painfully to escape from; he indeed needed to maintain contact with her, but in their letters he was prepared to reveal only the story of his intellectual-spiritual struggles but not the more intimate secrets of his heart, where every expression would stir old yearnings and deflect him from his necessary course (2: 70). And when that course was realized in the death of feeling and expectation toward the end of the Odessa years, dead also was the capacity for the "poesy of love" and any thought of a future connection between them. The meaning of Lilienblum's relationship with Feyge Novakhovitch 17.

Drawn by their mutual misery, the possibility of their love was first rendered imaginable and then catalyzed by reading together Mapu's 'Ahavat Siyyon and 'Ashmat Shomeron. Within this literary network of pastoral-platonic sentiments, their own unacknowledged affections took their identity. It was natural that what had begun in mutual communion over a text should be continued-and have its only reality-in the exchange of written documents and that no effort should be made to turn the literary into the real-at least on Lilienblum's part. The sharing and companionship aspects of marriage were not simply the most important functions of marriage for Lilienblum: they were the only ones he was willing and capable of accepting. To make the word flesh, to join companionship with sexuality, would have created a matrix of emo- tional demand before which the kloyzner could only be impotent. The mixture of confidence and distance in a purely epistolary relationship enabled Lilienblum to isolate the helpmeet function of the new idea of marriage while escaping from its more intimate and engulfing exigencies. VII The last year of the narrative (1872-1873) is treated in a scant eleven pages, which are concerned entirely with documenting the suppression and disappearance of the last vestiges of fancy and emotionalism. This meant writing in its various guises: Lilienblum's vicarious love affair through letters and his vicarious public career through articles. Each was seen as a flight from the world of practical, productive activity into a sickly imagi- nary realm. The correspondence with Feyge ended by Lilienblum's driving her away. As she came to realize that Lilienblum had no intention of ever being anything more than epistolary in his attentions, Feyge's letters became increasingly desperate and effusive. Lilienblum saw in the abandoned ex- pressiveness of the language of her letters symptoms of the same illness from which he had so recently recovered. He accused her of "emotional agitation that derives from naivete and purple phrases which, together with all sorts of other fantasies, are outside reality and the world of action" (2: 120). Faced with such treatment, Feyge chose not to respond, and the correspondence, which had been an abiding presence in Lilienblum's years of crisis, was terminated.I8 18. This seems to be the case for all intents and purposes, though once again Lilienblum plays with the possibility of persistence when he begins the first two letters of Derekh teshuvah,</page><page sequence="29">GUENZBURG, LILIENBLUM, AND HASKALAH AUTOBIOGRAPHY 99 Surveying his seven years as a Hebrew writer, Lilienblum concluded that there is something in the very nature of the writing life which is corrupting. The condemnation of the ignorant and the adulation of the enlightened, the passion for controversy and the dread of obscurity-all the sentiments determining the writer's emotional milieu-derive from and conduce to states of fantasy ridden agitation. Lilienblum's nihilism also left little to write about. Topics of religious reform were now out of the question, and more secular issues concerning the state of Jewish society, which would naturally then have become Lilienblum's subject, were in turn disqualified on the grounds that the idea of the Jewish people, collectively considered, was a mystified, transcendental concept which violated a truly empirical understanding of reality (2: 125). Only the individual and his experience are real. In exchange for these numerous renunciations, for having system- atically stripped himself of the consolations of love, religion and imagina- tion, it would have been hoped that Lilienblum would have been granted some sense of existential achievement. It was not so. What am I now? A poor ignoramus ['am ha-'ares], who denies every kind of fancy and consoling belief! I don't even know the rudiments of the exact sciences-so what do I know? My knowledge of Hebrew theology in my eyes counts for nothing because it is fanciful, transcendental knowledge that is not grounded in nature-so what do I know? Neither European languages, nor mathematics, nor geometry, nor astronomy, nor physics, nor chemistry, nor engineering, and the like-so what do I know? I know how to criticize foolish doctrines, yet by negation alone man's spirit cannot be fulfilled. (2: 124) Lodged between the successful annihilation of an unworthy past and the unsuccessful appropriation of the desired future, Lilienblum judged the final balance of his life to be null. Hallot ne'urim is, in the end, a self-told obituary. Looking back from 1873, his thirty-first year, Lilienblum concluded that his life was over-life in any sense that still holds out hope for change. He had renounced expecta- tion and hope of "resurrection," and had passed from the company of the "living dead" of the beit midrash to the ranks of the "dead living" of modern addressing his correspondent in the feminine as "Yedidati," without giving anything away in the letters themselves (2: 154, 156).</page><page sequence="30">100 ALAN MINTZ life, and it was this consciousness of closure that gave him the authority at the age of thirty to write an account of his life: not the story of a life in pro- gress but the definitive autobiography of a life that struggled, withered, and once and for all died. This is not even death with a flourish. In the preface to Hattot ne'urim, Lilienblum had said that the tale of his life would be a kind of representative Hebrew drama because it was characterized by absence rather than incident or affect (1: 95-96). Lilienblum returns to this notion at the close of the narrative when he apologizes to the reader for not supplying at least a suicide, the de rigueur ending in modern literature to a story of ordeal and disillusionment. But Hebrew writing cannot even provide that satisfaction because its subjects continue to live even though their life has expired (2: 126-27). As a testament of the dead, then, the autobiography is free to revisit and to parody the conventions of the savva'ah form which were so important in such an early work as 'A vi'ezer. Whereas in a traditional Savva'ah a patriarch would summarize the fruits of his wisdom and be- queath to his children guidelines along the path of tradition, Lilienblum testifies to the failure of his experience and counsels against walking in his ways. The drama that does exist in Hattot ne'urim, it was said, is produced by watching the gap close between the successive stages of the autobiographer's earlier self, as embodied in quoted documents from past years, and the achieved knowledge at the present time of the writing, as embodied in retro- spective commentaries on those documents. There is knowledge in Hallot ne'urim. Although in terms of accomplishment in the world Lilienblum judged his life to be a failure, he nevertheless succeeded in understanding the reasons for his failure, those assigned to society and to himself. Such illu- sionless consciousness would seem to be the work's consummate moment, hinted at in the ironic distance between commentary and document earlier in the text and steadily approached as the past converges on the present. The final irony of Hattot ne'urim is that even this consummation is never fully authorized; it is undermined by the deconstructive forces of nostalgia. A gross conception of autobiographical form would see the documentary axis of the work as moving in time through the past toward the stationary axis of retrospective knowledge. The fact is that this second axis also has a temporal duration, however microscopic in comparison to the expanse of years in the narrative itself. This is the time that elapses during the writing itself; though the writer may begin with a finished conviction of knowledge, that conviction must be exposed to the vicissitudes of reevoking the past. In Lilienblum's case this meant reexperiencing both the intoxication of his</page><page sequence="31">GUENZBURG, LILIENBLUM, AND HASKALAH AUTOBIOGRAPHY 101 years of heretical rebellion in Vilkomir and the emotional anguish of his "deeducation" in Odessa; and although over time he managed to renounce the first and to wean himself from the second, reliving these experiences through writing about them seems to have weakened Lilienblum's resolve. The epilogue to Ualtot ne'urim, "The Last Sigh," lingers with special poignancy on the ecstatic agony of his persecutions in Vilkomir (2: 134-35). Lilienblum knows that he was benighted and deluded then, his rebellion an empty palace revolution, but that knowledge does not prevent him from feeling the glow of those years: the radiant sense of self-worth, the exhilarat- ing possession of positive doctrines, the fearless confidence of the writer who knows that the truth of his experience is worth generalizing from. These were all the wrong feelings, but their vibrancy forms such a contrast to the burnt out disillusionment of the present that the final, monumental nega- tions of .Hattot ne'urim cannot help being shaken. VIII Some of the compositional differences between Haltot ne'urim proper and the new work Derekh teshuvah are instructive. Whereas Ilatot ne'urim brought the narrative of Lilienblum's life to within three years of the date of publication (1876), in the case of Derekh teshuvah the interval is significantly greater. Derekh teshuvah, which covers the years 1873-1881, was published only in 1899. Also, whereas the second section of Hattlot ne'urim ("The Days of Crisis and Renunciation") took 135 pages to cover four years, Derekh teshuvah manages to get through eight years in 55 pages. And where the texture of Hattot ne'vrim is heavy with tortured existential strivings, through the texture of Derekh teshuvah breathes the light air of a clear and steady intention. From the vantage point of the nineties many things became clear to Lilienblum. The "great idea" with which Derekh teshuvah closes, the idea of Hibbat Siyyon, had not only firmly established itself by this time but had already become tied to the great engines of political Zionism. By then, too, Lilienblum's identification with this idea and his commitment to its practi- cal realization were complete in their passion and tested in their duration. Hatllot ne'urim, to be sure, was narrated from a position of achieved self- hood, but that final state of triumphant renunciation had been qualified by the very negativity of its identity and by a failure of nerve in the form of nostalgia. The retrospective point of departure in Derekh teshuvah is utterly self-assured in its positive program, in its absorption in a transcendent non-</page><page sequence="32">102 ALAN MINTZ subjective idea, and in its security from regret and reservation. This convic- tion allowed Lilienblum to attempt a kind of compression and linearity in the reconstructive presentation of self in these eight years. Despite the apparent reversal that took place in 1881, Lilienblum saw these years as forming essentially one continuous, if not fully conscious, movement, and this unidirectional pressure and relative lack of complexity eliminated the need for elaboration. More than any of the earlier autobiographical writ- ings, Derekh teshuvah displays a desire to evade false starts and regressions and to make the past an image of an ineluctable, teleological movement toward the present. Although the years 1873-1876 saw no change in Lilienblum's state of material privation and spiritual exhaustion, in the next year circumstances combined to create a dramatic change in Lilienblum's life. Until this time Lilienblum's family had been living with him in Odessa and their presence made it impossible for Lilienblum to do anything but eke out a day-to-day existence. The threat of a Turkish invasion in April 1876 caused the inhabi- tants of Odessa to seek temporary refuge in the towns and villages of the interior, and Lilienblum used this opportunity to relocate his family in Vilkomir, while he returned, alone and disencumbered, to Odessa. Hallttot ne'urim had just been published and the proceeds from the sales-its reveal- ing, autobiographical content made it sell briskly in the enlightened city of Odessa-and the small income it brought enabled Lilienblum to cut down on the number of tutorial hours he was forced to give. In possession for the first time of a modicum of independence, Lilienblum dared to resuscitate the old dream of a university education. Though he was thirty-three years old and a father of adolescent children, Lilienblum figured that he could cover the gymnasium curriculum in two years and then be within reach of the university. "Congratulate me," wrote Lilienblum to a correspondent on June 18, 1877, "wish me en bonne heure. Congratulate me on having valiantly reached my goal and attained a happy end. For yesterday I began to study" (2: 154). The result of finally overcoming the great disappointment in his life was an exhilaration that carried him undaunted through what turned out to be many years of patient application. The important thing was to have made a beginning. For so long Lilienblum had self-punishingly dreamed of the future while in reality being pushed farther and farther back from taking a first step in its direction. Now since he was completely absorbed in studies he could safely turn his fantasies into a source of propulsive motivation to keep him on the track. The preparatory course took four years instead of</page><page sequence="33">GUENZBURG, LILIENBLUM, AND HASKALAH AUTOBIOGRAPHY 103 two, each day of it minutely calibrated into hours for geometry, Latin, and geography, into time for individual study and for tutoring by former Heb- rew students who had gone on to university. No matter how tedious and exacting his studies, Lilienblum's will was not deflected from his plan. Nor for that matter would Lilienblum yield to the blandishment of certain kinds of patronage. Judah Leib Gordon had secured a German benefactor who was willing to underwrite Lilienblum's education if he would commit him- self in advance to training as an orientalist. But having journeyed so far into the realm of practical actuality, the thought of retreating into the world of dead languages, yet another version of talmudism, was unthinkable. This display of will indicated a fundamental change of identity. At the end of section two of Halltot ne'urim, summing up the years of despair and resignation, Lilienblum signed his name with the pseudonymous acronym "The Wretched One" ('umlal ba-'ares = 'Ani Moshe Leib Lilienblum Ben 'A vi Rabbi Sevi). Writing to his wife to plead that she stay in Vilkomir and leave him to his work, Lilienblum announced that now he should be known by another name: "The Stubborn One" (qesheh 'ore]) (2: 165). He reminds her, rather threateningly, of the time in his early twenties when he was the heretical rebel of Vilkomir. No threats from parents, rabbis, the autho- rities-or from her-could shake the fierce disputant's will to pursue his goals. And so now, after the long night of remission, the via negativa of self- denial and renunciation has been put behind him and his spirit returned to the vigilant assertiveness which several years before had been recalled only as a temptation to nostalgia. A new era has been ushered in: hardships and distraction remain but in place of tortuous self-questioning a sense of self- possession and security (shalvat nefesh, qorat ruab) pervade the text. Whence this sudden and great renewal? Could it be traced back to the threat of the Turkish invasion which Lilienblum playfully suggests gave him freedom by removing his family from Odessa? Was it on account of the slight independence provided by the sales of Hattot ne'urim? The triviality of these reasons are patent. Derekh teshuvah is in the end not concerned with origins and explanations. Lilienblum was preoccupied instead with creating a revisionary myth of his self in which the deep running continuity is shown to be the will to action, conceived of as a pressure that is bound to surface when circumstances allow. Alternatively, Lilienblum's new life of accom- plishment was pictured as a resurrection, a restoration to something that had once flourished but had in the meantime been suppressed. The reader of the second part of Hattot ne'urim, that reader who followed Lilienblum as he suffered and struggled gradually to achieve freedom from the terror of his</page><page sequence="34">104 ALAN MINTZ disappointments and who assented to the authenticity of those struggles, must be forgiven if he is less than convinced by the effortlessness of Lilien- blum's rebirth and if he is vexed by Lilienblum's evasion of the task of expli- cating the origins of this change. As I have suggested above, it is possible that, having met and seized the great cause of his life, Lilienblum had so become another person by the late nineties that the person who he had been in the early seventies was no longer recognizable or admissible, and hence the unanswerableness of the question of how a sense of self so secured and empowered emerged from an impasse of negation and exhaustion. If it had not been for his conversion to Zionism, Lilienblum's career might have been assigned to a dim footnote in the subsequently ascendent historiography of nationalism. But because his journey from belief to en- lightenment and nihilism was capped in the end by an embrace of Hibbat Siyyon, Lilienblum was transmuted in the annals of Hebrew literature into a mythic figure: the great truth teller whose quest for truth could finally not resist the logic of Jewish history. Derekh teshuvah has thus been read as the story of Lilienblum's conversion, a story that comes to its climax at the con- clusion of the book when the pogroms of 1881 burst into his life, sweep aside the playthings of learning and enlightenment, and press Lilienblum into communion with the fate of the People. The actual text of Derekh teshuvah in fact urges a reading of considerably more complexity. There are two great moments of breakthrough in Derekh teshuvah, one at the beginning of the work and one at the end, and between these movements there obtains a relationship of dialectical continuity. The first concerns Lilienblum's return to studies. In an important sense, as I have tried to argue, this event constituted a greater discontinuity with Lilienblum's past than the concluding embrace of nationalism. The return to studies represented a breaking out of the cul-de-sac of resignation and a successful reentry into the world of praxis. Both the fact of Lilienblum's individual rebirth and the fact that it was a rebirth into practical accom- plishment had of necessity to precede an awareness of the logic of national rebirth, which likewise was to come in the form of a reawakening to the need for the taking of practical, material measures. The individual foreshadowed the collective; as Lilienblum had learned to save his own life, so might the People learn also. The via negativa had been put behind and then it became a question of new life finding its fitting object. To use another metaphor; it is as if Lilienblum's life was like a lifeless firehose, which at the beginning of Derekh teshuvah is suddenly and mysteriously connected to a powerful</page><page sequence="35">GUENZBURG, LILIENBLUM, AND HASKALAH AUTOBIOGRAPHY 105 source of water, and which, though misdirected for a time, at the end finds its proper target. The final conversion was additionally prepared for by glimmerings of renewed interest in the affairs of Russian Jewry. These concerns form a minor theme in Derekh teshuvah, which receives a more insistent articulation as the work progresses. As early as 1876 the abortive scheme of English philanthropists to buy Palestine from the Sultan provoked in Lilienblum a "stirring of the imagination" (2: 148). In July 1878, Lilienblum mentioned with enthusiasm reports of the plans of the Alliance Israel1ite to purchase large tracts of Russian land to be colonized by impoverished Jews from the Pale (2: 180). After 1879 Lilienblum began to be extremely concerned by the growing assimilation of young Russian Jews and wrote on the evils of it in the Russian-Jewish press (2: 182). An article of his in Ha-meli4 (1879, nos. 41, 44; 1880, nos. 1, 2) gratified him greatly by the controversy it aroused. The claim of continuity should not be stressed overmuch. The great arrival was the more powerfully realized for having been adequately pre- pared for. The pogroms that swept through southern Russia in the spring of 1881 (the Jews of Odessa were attacked in the first week of May) were given poignant expression in Derekh teshuvah in a series of pained elliptical diary entries; the real turning point in Lilienblum's situation, however, followed by several months and is presented in four journal entries, for Elul 28 and Tishri 4, 6, 7 entries whose superscription, it should be noted, is given for the first time according to the Hebrew calendar. In these entries Lilienblum made the significant and brilliant choice not to present his crisis of identity in directly discursive psychological or ideological terms. He created an astonishing effect by instead presenting a kind of battle of the books: combat by textual proxy. In each entry Lilienblum juxtaposed a lesson from his gymnasium studies with another text, and simply by the progress of these unexplicated juxtapositions he managed to indicate the course of his con- version. The first entry, for Elul 28, begins with a Latin exercise. The text is from Cicero: "The virtuous man will desire no reward for his labors and hard- ships other than praise and honor." Lilienblum first notices the grammatical peculiarities of the sentence, then transposes its syntax, and translates into Hebrew-all this as if the matter of the text were arbitrary, a moment in the exertions of an aspiring externe. Lilienblum pauses to wonder bemusedly at these old Roman sages who regarded praise and honor as sufficient motives for civic virtue, and then he leaves the exercise. Without comment there fol-</page><page sequence="36">106 ALAN MINTZ lows an excerpt from an official Russian state communique urging the documentation of Jewish crimes against Russian society: ". . . to gather and submit to the proper location precise information together with presump- tions of guilt on the question: which aspects of the economic activity of the Jews cause injury to the lives of the principal inhabitants . . . " (2: 192). On this text Lilienblum does comment, drawing out instead the implication that in the economic world every group or individual prospers at the expense of others and that in Russia the Jews will always be regarded as the party giv- ing injury. The irony of the juxtaposition of Cicero and a document of offi- cial Russian antisemitism cuts in two ways; though the venality of Russian society is judged by contrast to an entirely different norm of human beha- vior in a polity, the very loftiness of the Ciceronian civic ideal proves itself utterly and dangerously irrelevant to an understanding of the political actu- alities of the Jewish question. The entry for Tishri 4 (no mention is made of the intervening holiday of Rosh Hashana) juxtaposes a series of mathematical problems with a passage from Jeremiah. The problems and their solutions, which graphically seize the reader by pouring an extravagant display of numbers and symbols over the Hebrew page, are concerned with logarithms and algebraic equations and together describe an ideal language of rationality. Logarithms are a device for abridging calculation by transposing complex operations into simple steps of addition and subtraction. Algebraic equations are sets of artificially manipulated equivalences that are transformed and balanced by agreed upon rules. The biblical text is Jeremiah 45:4-5: "Behold, that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land. And thou seekest great things for thyself? Seek them not!" The context is a short prophecy given to Baruch ben Neriah at the conclusion of his narrative of Jeremiah's life and prophecies. Exhausted and depressed by the visions he has recorded, Baruch complains that he has been given no rest or consolation. Traditional exegesis, especially Kimhi, interprets Baruch's complaint as a request for the mantle of prophecy, which was often given to a prophet's disciple, after the example of Elijah and Elisha; modern criticism understands the complaint as a request simply for the kind of power to which important scribes often acceded. In any case, Baruch is told by God not to seek such grandiose attainments. His reward will be more modest but not insignificant: in the general catastrophe that will soon engulf Judah, Baruch will be allowed to escape with his life. The application to Lilienblum's situation is clear. Lilienblum is a latter day Baruch, a scribe rather than an original visionary, who has been over-</page><page sequence="37">GUENZBURG, LILIENBLUM, AND HASKALAH AUTOBIOGRAPHY 107 reaching in his search for personal achievement and greatness, while his people are condemned to destruction, of which the recent pogroms were but a small adumbration. A text from the real world of historical catastrophe stands next to a text from the artificially elegant world of mathematics. In an equation nothing is ever lost: what is taken from one term of the equivalence or done to it must be given to the other term so that the symmetry not be violated; the verse from Jeremiah, however, describes a judgment of irre- coverable devastation in which what was built and planted will be forever torn down and uprooted. The diary entry for Tishri 4 concludes: "I put down my book and papers and went out into the awesome destruction... " (2: 194). The Jeremiah verse is used again as the countertext in the third and fourth journal entries (Tishri 6, 7); with each repetition the authority of the verse increases in proportion to the insipid irrelevancy of the gymnasium lesson text. The first text is an excerpt from a geography book describing mineral deposits in a certain region of Russia and their discovery by merchants and explorers. The text runs consecutively for several lines before phrases begin to repeat in a jumble of sentence fragments, as if a distracted student kept forcing his mind back to the page and as if self-possession of the text was foundering on the bedrock of the Jeremiah verse, which immediately follows it. The matter of the passage is again not arbitrary. For a Jew to force himself to learn by rote the features and resources of a land which is not his and which does not want him is absurd and humiliating. Additionally painful is the obvious contrast between the firm substantiality of rich mineral deposits and the vulnerable precariousness of Jewish exis- tence in that land. The last diary entry, a passage in Latin and Hebrew from Ovid's The Metamorphosis, is a lushly pastoral description of the coming of night to the mouth of a grotto, as Nox sprinkles a flowery soporific on the scene. The exquisitely artificial tranquility of the tableau is of course the antithesis of the atrocities that had so recently taken place on the street outside as "fore- told" by the Jeremiah prophecy of wrath. In the more local context of struc- ture of Derekh teshuvah, the passage closes the climactic cycle of diary entries by returning to the starting point of a Latin exercise and by creating a setting of charmed sleepfulness in which the resisting, enterprising will of the individual fades and is forever put to rest. The death of the will prepares the way for resurrection of the self. Late on the night of Tishri 12 Lilienblum draws the conclusions that had been cryptically implied in the pastiche of passages: the Jews are ultimately and</page><page sequence="38">108 ALAN MINTZ unchangeably alien to European society and rather than emigrating to other countries in which the sad tale will repeat itself, let them go to their ancestral homeland and once again make it their own. The nation may yet transform itself; for Lilienblum his own transformation has happened already. The great stone that had pressed down on my heart for such a long time fell off in a moment, my eyes opened, my soul exalted, and I became another person. The dew of resurrection fell anew upon me and melted the "great glacier" that had covered my heart these many years. (2: 198) The reawakening of the will, which had taken place at the beginning of Derekh teshuvah, yet which had not affected the longstanding paralysis of emotion, is now canceled and fulfilled by the reawakening of the spirit. The price to be paid for Lilienblum's rebirth is the end of autobio- graphical writing. When Lilienblum ceased seeking "great things" for him- self, his will became entirely identified with the larger enterprise into which he had been reborn. Lilienblum thenceforth became an institution and his further autobiographical writings, such as Derekh la-'avor ge'ulim (A Way for the Redeemed to Pass Over). became institutional history. The space between self and society within which the authentic autobiographical im- pulse arises was closed forever. IX Though with the publication of Derekh teshuvah the career of Haskalah autobiography came to a formal close, the role of its posthumous influence should not be underestimated. To conclude this study, I wish briefly to make the case for the importance of this genre in the breakthrough to literary modernism in the first decade of the century in the narrative prose fiction of Berdyczewski (the Berdyczewski of Mabanayim and 'Orva parab), Brenner, and Gnessin. The opening of a new space of existential subjectivity, the method of psychological realism, the awareness of the tragic limits of human action, the obsessive concern with a single consciousness, the deflationary precision of language-these characteristics of the new literature can be explained in part by reference to the European novel and in part by reference internally to the earlier development of the Hebrew novel. But only in part. The immediate legacy of the novel genre in Hebrew-with all its machinery of</page><page sequence="39">GUENZBURG, LILIENBLUM, AND HASKALAH AUTOBIOGRAPHY 109 melodrama, caricature, didactic intrusion, multiplicity of characters, and geographical dispersion-constituted a substantial and oppressive edifice, and it may well be said that it was only by finding some way of bypassing these conventions that new directions could be taken. As far as internal explanations go, then, the more proper question might well be how such a writer as Brenner managed to write what he did despite the Haskalah novel. Take, for example, this passage from Brenner's Breakdown and Bereave- ment (1920). But stop your struggling-because there is no one to rescue you either. Resign yourself-and live as best you can. It would all have had to end someday any- how, just as your life too will someday have to end. Oblivion is waiting for you, waiting. Try to live each minute with what other feelings you have: live as the crushed fly lives with its wings pulled off or as the blind mangy dog. Noth- ing will ever change, resign yourself once and for all. Accept what comes your way-and be still!'9 At the center of the novel after Yehezkel Hefetz has been released from the hospital, he exhorts himself to leave off living in a constant state of feverish desire and to resign himself to a present existence that expects no salvation from the future. The kind of struggle Hefetz's desire condemns him to is hardly related to the tortures of religious doubt in the literature of the pre- vious century; it is a kind of metaphysical anguish anchored to a deep sense of sexual humiliation. Hefetz is profoundly divided against himself and hence his characteristic form of consciousness is the reflexiveness of interior monologue. The complexity of the text rests on this kind of division. The exhortations sweep forward toward the promise of a sweet oblivion at the end of willing and striving; but the only concrete images embedded in a decidedly unpictorial passage-the wingless crushed fly and the blind mangy dog-make Hefetz's pleading all the more desperate by revealing what he really imagines a state of resignation to be like. Now, I believe it would be difficult to find in the fiction of Abramovitch, Smolenskin, or Broides a passage whose rhetorical complexity derives from a similar combination of philosophical and psychological awareness. But consider these lines from a journal entry in Moses Leib Lilienblum's auto- biography flattot ne'urim (1876). Lilienblum is addressing his emotions, which have been stirred by the image of an impossible love. 19. Breakdown and Bereavement, trans.

When you next bring before me fantasies to indulge myself in, your labor will be in vain, for resignation will seize those fantasies by the neck and shake them and will not permit me the slightest pleasure. .... Nor shall I seek any longer to know what my future will be, for resignation has already taken care of that question in a few words. .... (2: 109) There are differences here, to be sure. The agon between involuntary feelings and mandated resignation is almost comically externalized, and no concrete images of debilitation check the flow of rhetorical suasion. The continuities are clear nonetheless, and they indicate a kind of language of the self that is different from the language of the novels of the time and that we can easily imagine as being generative of the later, more troubled fictions of a writer like Brenner. Here too is a divided consciousness caught in a tenuous act of self-exhortation. Here too is an attempt to lay to rest the strivings of desire which continually betray dependence on the surrogate gratifications of fan- tasy, and an attempt to attain to a similar kind of resignation in which the dread of the future will forever pass away. Lilienblum was, of course, not a novelist. What separated him from the generation of Brenner was, in Brenner's words, the fact that Lilienblum "knew only himself and did not know others. Psychological penetration regarding other people was foreign to him." As practitioner of autobio- graphy, the dimension of intersubjectivity was absent. But it is the fact of that penetration on Lilienblum's part, no matter how narrowly applied, that Brenner acknowledges as the great link between the two literary genera- tions: "the hatred of illusion, fantasy, and imaginary constructions."20 There existed, in sum, an alternative tradition of imaginative writing from which the modernists could derive nourishment, both thematically and formally, and to which they could cling for safe passage around the colos- sus of the novels. As a genre autobiography required focusing on the inner experience of a single individual, authorized writing about such private areas as sex and domestic relations that were not proper elsewhere, prided itself in the realistic correspondence between experienced reality and the written record of it, and, finally, encouraged the use of a flexible low diction suitable to the "fallen" reality of contemporary individual existence. The achievement of autobiography in its own right is considerable; its legacy may be more considerable still. 20. Kol kitvei U. Y. Brenner, 3: 109. See also 2: 292-93.
