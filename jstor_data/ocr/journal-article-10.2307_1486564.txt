Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995. 280 pp. Jeffrey Lesser belongs to the small group of historians whose studies of Jewish immigration to Latin America concentrate on only one country, in this case, Brazil.' As is suggested by its title, Welcoming the Undesirables: Brazil and the Jewish Question, this book analyzes the reasons why Jewish 1.

The situation worsened, with tragic consequences, between 1933 and 1941, the years in which those hounded by the Nazi and Fascist regimes, and in imminent danger of extermination, desperately sought a country that would offer a refuge. In his book, Lesser explains the origins of Brazil's immigration policy and the reasons why it continually set obstacles before Jews seeking to enter the land. The initial legislation, enacted in 1924, was not directed against Jews but against prospective immigrants who were poor, and even affected Portuguese laborers and farmers, who previously had been able to settle in Brazil without any problem. The terms of this regulation required that new immigrants have a certain amount of capital, to be deposited in Brazilian banks. This requisite later posed a serious difficulty for escapees from Nazism who had been obliged to abandon their countries of origin almost without any financial means because their fortunes had been confiscated before they were allowed to leave. Although the Jewish population of Brazil around 1925 was no more than 20,000, it was stereotyped, especially among intellectuals and politicians, as made up of poor, nonproductive exploiters of foreign origin. This prejudiced image was reinforced by Nazi Germany's growing antisemitic propaganda, which found easy acceptance in Brazil's military and higher governing circles. It was not by chance, therefore, that the first Portuguese translation of the antisemitic Protocols of the Elders of Zion was printed in Brazil in 1933, thereafter circulating rapidly and extensively. As Lesser shows, opposition to the immigration of Jewish refugees was also due to antisemitism among Brazilian diplomats in Europe. As early as 1934, Nabuco Gouv6a, a diplomat in Bucharest, wrote that "Jews are the worst possible immigrants." To this must be added the belief, widely held in Brazil's highest governing circles and also in public opinion, that "the most active European communists operating in Brazil" were almost all Jews. Although Jewish immigration was already restricted by bureaucratic obstacles and by the requirement for "capitalist" visas, Getulio Vargas's government issued a Secret Circular (No. 1127) in 1937 prohibiting the granting of visas to people of "semitic origin," which in this case included both Jews and Arabs. As a result of this policy, Jewish immigration was reduced by 75 percent; of a total of 1,315 Jews of German descent, this figure</page><page sequence="3">282 BOOK REVIEWS was reduced in 1938 to only 445 persons. At the same time, all immigrants who had entered the country illegally on tourist visas were threatened with deportation to their countries of origin. It was only due to strong diplomatic pressure by the United States that several thousand Jewish refugees were saved from the application of this extreme measure. Only a year later, the Brazilian government modified its immigration policy, mainly in order to give Brazil an anti-Nazi/anti-Fascist image. There was also a change in the stereotype about Jews. The exploitative petty trader now became a Jewish millionaire who was trying to escape from Europe. A new Secret Circular (No. 1249) no longer mentions "Semites" but refers to the "entry of Israelites into national territory." To further promote a better international image for Brazil, a group of refugee intellectuals and writers was allowed to enter the country. Among them was Stefan Zweig. According to Lesser, "the granting of a lifesaving visa to Zweig may well have influenced his decision to write the propagandistic 'Brazil: Land of the Future' " (p. 124). Mainly in the years 1938-39, the immigration laws in force were relaxed. Evidence of this is the fact that on August 14, 1939, only two weeks before the outbreak of the war, the Brazilian consul in Hamburg was authorized to grant 800 visas "for semites and nonsemites." Yet in January of 1941, a new order to Brazil's consulates suspended all visas except those for artists and capitalists. Despite these restrictive measures, around 4,000 Jews managed to enter Brazil between 1940 and 1941. The inhuman character of Brazil's restrictive immigration policy caused an international outcry in 1941, when the Spanish ship Cabo de Hornos arrived at Rio de Janeiro with about 95 Jewish refugees, whose visas, already expired, had been renewed by the Brazilian consul in Cadiz, on the orders of Douza Dantas, the ambassador to the Vichy French government and one of the few Brazilian diplomats willing to help Jewish refugees. As the refugees were about to land, the port authorities denied admission to them, on the grounds that higher orders had invalidated their visas. Neither U.S. diplomatic pressure nor the pleas of the Spanish, French, and Italian ambassadors succeeded in persuading the Vargas government to rescind this inhuman decision. The refugees were only saved from having to return to Europe when, at the last moment, the Dutch authorities in Curagao gave them permission to land. Lesser does not mention the activities of Hermann Matthias GOrgen, a German journalist who, it seems, has been forgotten, just as Oskar Schindler was forgotten before his life was made known in a film. In 1940 Gorgen began</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 283 to assemble a group of emigrants threatened with deportation to Switzerland and France and others who were still living in Germany. With the help of the Czechoslovakian government-in-exile in London, Gorgen was able to obtain fake passports and proofs that the refugees were Aryan. He also was able to persuade the Brazilian consul in Geneva to give them visas. In 1993, one year before his death, G6rgen was honored with the "Righteousness Award," the Holocaust Medal of Justice. An extensive chapter of Lesser's book discusses non-Aryan Catholics, who were accepted as full members of the Church by the Vatican, but nonetheless had to seek a refuge due to Nazi Germany's racial policies. Cardinal Faulhaber, the archbishop of Munich, tried to obtain Brazilian visas for them with the help of the Brazilian consul in Hamburg, the poet Joao Guimaraes Rosa, who had already helped victims of Nazism, and who was imprisoned by the Nazis when Brazil entered the war against Germany. However, although the members of this group were Catholics, their applicatons had been registered under "Jewish Immigration." For eight months the Vatican tried to get Brazil to change its position. Archbishop Wilhelm Berning of OsnabrUck accused the Brazilian government of ignoring the Vatican's applications. Brazil finally came to an agreement with the Vatican to issue 3,000 visas to Catholic non-Aryans if the applicants could deposit the sum of $2,000 per person, later adding the additional condition of their having been baptized before 1933. It was only possible to make use of 15 to 30 percent of these 3,000 visas. For the rest, all kinds of obstacles were raised, as in the case of two persons with baptismal certificates issued by the pope whose applications were denied in January of 1940 because, "in spite of saying they are Catholic, their surname reveals semitic origin" (p. 167). After 1941, Jewish immigration to Brazil ceased in practice. Betweeen 1942 and 1945 only 245 refugees were able to enter the country legally. At the end of the book, Lesser conludes that Brazil's immigration policy had two components, one which was antisemitic on the German Nazi model, and another which was racial, based on a stereotype that regarded Jews as non-white, non-European, and likely to be harmful to Brazil's development, and therefore to be denied immigration rights. Welcoming the Undesirables is a very valuable contribution to the history of Jewish immigration to Brazil, and it is highly commended for having used extensive documentation and sources that until now were unpublished. We would recommend for a future edition the use of the official German</page><page sequence="5">284 BOOK REVIEWS documents of the time concerning Jewish immigration to Brazil and the reports that German diplomats sent from Brazil to the Chancellery in Berlin. It would also be advisable to revise the tables and the appendix which provide statistics related to Jewish immigration to Brazil. The figures are, in some cases, contradictory, and some of the tables are repeated unnecessarily (Table 2.2 and Appendix 7). Gtinter Bchm University of Chile Santiago, Chile</page></plain_text>
