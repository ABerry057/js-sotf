It was an act of resistance, as Haman, the great enemy of the Jews, was a transparent reference to Hitler, but within and beyond that, it continued a project that had absorbed many Eastern European Jews since the second half of the nineteenth century. Rabbinic tradition, they felt, was dying. It was urgent to discover a new source of inspiration for the Jewish people. In 1944-45, when Sloves and other Jewish survivors returned to Paris, where they had immigrated years before the war, the task of rebuilding seemed more urgent still. To continue to search for a new, secular mode of expression was intimately tied to the very revival of the Jewish people. Between 1945 and 1949, Eomens mapole, considerably shortened and somewhat modified, played to resounding acclaim not only in Paris but also in several cities across three continents.x To point out the formal elements of the new culture that Sloves wished to perpetuate is relatively easy. Following I. L. Peretz, the great turn-of-the-century writer who inspired much of modern Yiddish literature, he constructed the play out of biblical text, Jewish folklore, and European tradition, addressing himself throughout to the contemporary problems facing the Jewish people.2 But to try to locate what actually changed in this mix is another matter. The operating assumption 1. Documentation is most abundant for the chief site of its success, Paris, in the years 1946-49, but there is also evidence for its performance in New York, Los Angeles, Wroclaw, Brussels, Rio de Janeiro, and Buenos Aires. The last city was host to it in 1957, when the Parisian director moved to Argentina. Archival material is available at the YIVO library in New York and at the Medem library in Paris. Sloves, in "Ha-tarbut ha-yehudit be-Zarfat," Frei Yisroel, August 10, 1952, also claimed that Homens mapole was performed in Romania and South Africa. We did not have access to any archi val material on those performances. 2. For Peretz's own writings, see The Three Great Classics of Modern Yiddish Literature, vol. 3, Selected Works of I. L Peretz, ed. Marvin Zuckerman and Marion Herbst (Malibu, CA: Pangloss Press, 1996); Sloves himself devoted an essay to Peretz, "Der Brenendiker dorn," in his collection In un arum (New York: Yidish Kultur Farband, 1970).

Proceeding in this manner places our analysis of Sloves's play within a certain scholarly discussion of secularization.3 An earlier view presented secularization as synonymous with the advent of a totally new and final form of human achievement, a change unlike other changes in that, for the first time, human beings supposedly severed all links to a transcendent realm. By contrast, in the later discussion to which this essay belongs, the secular is merely the change in one's own historical period, which both displaces and keeps in place prior references to the transcendent. One should not minimize that change, but neither should one aggrandize it to a meta physical claim about the absence of all transcendent referents. The task of the histor ian is to detect both the movement away from established religious symbols and the symbol-making process in which the sacred reappears. Our interpretation of Sloves's Homens mapole also fits into another view of secularization, although in a more peripheral way. In this latter discussion, the accent is placed on its link with Western imperialism.4 It is, in fact, the ideological face of Western expansion. Secularization?that is, the modern Western notions of the state, the individual, reason, the body, and so on, viewed as the final word of history?is imposed on the rest of the world, which still operates according to religious assumptions from which it needs to be liberated. We do not present Homens mapole as either the object or the agent of Western imperialism. Yet the play reveals what we would like to call the centrality of the myth of Europe, the taken-for-granted assumption that Europe is the world. No secular modernity, either of the colonizers or the colonized, could do without this myth. But the Jewish version expressed in this play anticipated, although certainly not consciously, the breakup of the myth of Europe that our latest discussions about secularization reveal to be taking place as we speak. A play is an ephemeral thing, on the stage for a brief period and then usually forgotten. This is all the more the case with Homens mapole, not because of any artistic unworthiness but because the language in which it was written disappeared within two decades of its performance as the chief language of the vast majority of Jews. Nonetheless, it provides us with a good entryway into the dialectic of secular and sacred. In the first place, Haim Sloves, its author, devoted his entire life to the 3. We are inspired primarily by Kees Bolle 's essay "Secularization as a Problem in the Study of Religion," Comparative Studies in Society and History 12, no. 3 (1970): 242-59, and, more recently, by Claude Lefort's essay "The Permanence of the Theologico-Political?" in Democracy and Political Theory (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1988), 214-55. More recently still, Jean Claude Monot, La Querelle de la s?cularisation (Paris: Vrin, 2002), traces the uses of the term "secu larization" in modern philosophical and sociological inquiries, noting the tension between a prior view that posited a clean rupture and a more recent view that sees continuity despite the rupture. The question remains whether that continuity is merely structural or more fundamental. 4.

He helped found institutions for its promotion and organized a number of important international congresses devoted to it both before and after the war.5 In the 1950s and 1960s, he fought relentlessly for the reestablishment of Yiddish culture in the Soviet Union.6 This is not to mention his own creative endeavors as a Yiddish playwright and essayist.7 In short, Eomens mapole was not merely a momentary response to the war but a con scious attempt to create what was modern and secular. This does not mean, of course, that Sloves's artistic and political choices were representative of Yiddish secular culture at large. The play was performed as avant-garde theater. Sloves had been a communist since his youth in his native Bialystok.8 This was but one strand in the varied landscape of Yiddish modernity. Typical of Yiddish secular culture, however, was a certain tension between rupture and continuity with the rabbinic tradition. This tension was very much reproduced in Sloves's play, exacerbated by the fact that it was a purimshpil. A popular theatrical genre whose essence is parody, it was very well suited to revealing the displacement of authority that Yiddish secular culture wished to embody. Rupture and Continuity?A nation like other Nations? For someone wishing to break with the rabbinic tradition, the book of Esther, upon which Eomens mapole is based, is a very good choice. As is well known, it makes no reference to Jewish religious practices at all, and it is the only book in the Bible in which the name of God does not appear. It was accepted late into the biblical canon, after some disputes. When the rabbis of the classical period did decide to include it, they made sure to impose a theological framework upon it by means of exegesis. The absence of any reference to God, for instance, did not mean for them that the world operates by mere chance but that Providence 5. He helped found the Yidish Kultur Farband, which included a publishing house and a literary magazine, Yidishe kultur, founded in 1938, that, for many decades, was one of the chief organs for the dissemination of works in Yiddish sympathetic to the communist cause published outside the Soviet Union. It operated from New York. He also helped organize a large Congress for Yiddish Culture in 1937 and a Congress on Jewish Culture in Europe in 1948. He was the keynote speaker at both. He helped found the journal Oyfsnay and a publishing house of the same name in Paris in 1947, and in 1958, he became the editor of Domaine yidich, ajournai of Yiddish literature in French translation. 6. See Annette Aronowicz, "Haim Sloves, the Jewish People, and a Jewish Communist's Allegiances," Jewish Social Studies 9, no. 1 (2002): 95-142. 7. Six of Sloves's Yiddish plays were published in book form, five of which were performed onstage as well. He wrote many essays about Yiddish literature and theater, some of which were pub lished in one book as In un arum. He also wrote one of the first studies of the failed Soviet attempt to create a Jewish state in the Siberian province of Birobidjan, Sovetishe yidishe melukehshkayt (Paris: Haim Sloves, 1979). His final work, published three years before his death, was a memoir about the intersection of his communist and Jewish commitments, A Shlikhes keyn moskve (New York: Yidish Kultur Farband, 1985). More specifically, it detailed his fight to restore Yiddish culture in the Soviet Union after it was suppressed, from 1948 onward. In it, he translated the memoranda he had written to the French Communist Party secretary, Maurice Thorez, and his successor, Waldeck Rochet, from the original French into Yiddish. 8. For Sloves's description of how he joined the communist cause and, more generally, of his youth in Bialystok, see "Vegn zikh un vegn mein shafh," in In un arum, 299-311. 371</page><page sequence="4">Annette Aronowicz is hidden, undetectable until a later time. In many details of their commentaries, the covenantal relationship between God and the Jews becomes central to the text. The reason the Jews suffered near extinction at the hand of Haman was that they had broken away from the commandments. When, at the end of the book, they accept the decree to commemorate the events they have just lived through (what became the holiday of Purim), rabbinic commentary explains it as the Jewish people's renewed commitment to the commandments.9 All Sloves had to do, therefore, to uncover the secular meaning of the text was to stay clear of rabbinic exegesis. To a degree, he does just that. His plot sticks closely to the original national epic. The innovations he does introduce are merely attempts to accentuate its this worldly aspects, stressing, for instance, the courage and ingenuity of human beings, independent of any outside force, and, most especially, presenting the Jews as a people just like other people. He introduces a subplot in which Haman, the real power in the vast Persian Empire, second in command to King Ahasuerus, decides to conquer Greece as a step to yet more conquests. Given the huge number of soldiers deployed in this war effort, the subplot allows for frequent references to the suffering of people other than the Jews. Court officials complain about the large number of Persian soldiers killed.10 Wives complain about the absence of their husbands.11 At the end of the play, artisans and workers march on the king's palace, demanding that Haman, the hated instigator of the war, be hung.12 In short, everyone, not only the Jews, is affected. In another departure from the biblical text, Sloves makes Haman fall madly in love with Esther, the young (secretly Jewish) wife of the king. He asks Mordecai, the Jewish hero, to arrange a tryst and, when the latter refuses, flies into a murder ous rage against all Jews.13 This displaces the central motif of the story, which in the rabbinic reading is Mordecai's refusal to bow down to Haman, interpreted by many rabbis as his refusal of idolatry.14 In Sloves's version, Haman does require Mordecai to bow down, but his real anger stems from being foiled in his desire to meet Esther, not from Mordecai's refusal to bow. Nopurimshpil could do without the scene in which Mordecai refuses to bow down, of course, and he does so in Sloves's version as well. But his playful retort to Haman's command gives no sign that he is motivated by his desire to serve God and to shirk idolatry.15 The secularizing impulse in Sloves's innovations can be read as his effort to displace the notion of the Jews as the chosen people, as a nation unlike other 9. See Midrash Esther Rabba for a compilation of rabbinic readings of the book of Esther. Emmanuel Levinas, in Nine Talmudic Readings by Emmanuel Levinas (Bloomington: University of Indiana, 1990), 39, comments on the significance in Tractate Shabbat 88b of the rabbis' reading of Esther 9:27 as the acceptance of the commandments. 10.

Sloves, Homens mapole, 56. 372</page><page sequence="5">The Downfall of Haman nations. In Homens mapole, the Jews suffer, but so do other people, and it seems to be for the same reason, a brutal tyrant. There is no metaphysical explanation for the Jews' plight. But the play bears traces of the older rabbinic conception as well. These traces are all the more significant in that they involve deliberate inser tions of religious vocabulary into a biblical account from which they are missing. The most important of these insertions occurs when the king's three counselors urge him to become the leader of the opposition to Haman. When Mordecai finally accepts, Memoukhan, one of the king's counselors, worries, "Ai, ai, ai, if only God would want to help!" Mordecai replies, "He will help. He must help. What then? He will let his Chosen People be killed? Not to worry! I rely on the Lord's help, Blessed Be He {hashem yisborakh 's hilf), as if upon an iron bridge and you, colleagues, can rely on me."16 In an earlier passage, we find an echo of the same sentiment. Morde cai taunts Haman in a speech contest between them: "How long will you order our lives and our belongings around? We have, thank God, a father in heaven {a tatn in himmel) and he will soon have you buried deep in the earth."17 It is possible to see these passages about chosenness merely as another example of folkshtimlikhkayt, of the popular style. Colloquial speech was traditionally filled with all sorts of references to God. In Homens mapole, self consciously a folk play, Sloves wished to reproduce such speech patterns. As even the non-Jewish characters use them, they add an element of humor. For instance, Haman, in a speech in which he claims to be greater than any conqueror in history, also claims to be greater than "Columbus, who will one day discover, God willing ?im yirzeh hashem) new islands."18 It would be totally missing the point to derive any theological meaning from such remarks. In inserting these religious expressions, Sloves was both imitating popular speech and poking fun at it. In short, he followed the purimshpil tradition of parody. Yet the passages that refer to the Jews as the chosen people have a different ring. In them, the reference to God is not merely a stock phrase thrown into the conversation automatically but part of an argument. When Mordecai tells the counselors that they can rely on God because he will not let his chosen people be destroyed, his choice of words is deliberate. When he tells them that they can rely on him, he has a serious intent. Does he not also mean it when he says that he relies on God as if upon an iron bridge? In any case, even if one chooses to read these passages as one more example of folkshtimlikhkayt, whose reference to chosenness and trust in God cannot be taken literally, the fact remains that the rabbinic tradition is carried along by the play. There may be several explanations as to why Sloves chose to add religious vocabulary to a text he was also trying to rid of its religious connotations. One is the very proximity of the war. Jews often saw the fact that they had survived such an onslaught as a sign of their exceptional destiny as a people. In the words of the rabbi and philosopher Steven Schwartzchild, if they had survived this, they could 16. Ibid., 73. 17. Ibid., 49. 18. Ibid., 30. 373</page><page sequence="6">Annette Aronowicz survive anything.19 Perhaps only the old vocabulary of chosenness and trust (bitokhn) could fully convey this realization. Also, in this immediate postwar period, as in prewar times, Jewish religious vocabulary was the most potent symbol of the nation as a whole. The rifts and enmities between religious and secular factions were, for a short moment, irrelevant. Third, even a nation that is like all other nations needs a mystique or produces one. The notion of chosen ness would thus sanctify the particularity of this nation, independent of any act of religious observance in the rabbinic sense. Regardless of the reasons behind Mordecai's references to trust in God, Sloves felt that the modern secular understanding of trust (bitokhn) was different from what it had been in earlier times. In an article written shortly after the war, he spoke with admiration of the Jewish man of the people's trust in the future, his trust in the destiny of the Jews. He saw in the writer Sholem Aleichem's character Tevye an embodiment of that age-old trust. But Tevye, although he shows some signs of modernity, still passively waits for the world to change and resigns himself to conditions in the meantime. The truly modern man of the people, by contrast, Sloves insisted, fights to bring about change. He is the resistance fighter in the ghetto.20 In this willingness to engage in political activity, even military action, the earlier trust finally finds its full true expression. In Eomens mapole, Mordecai does exhibit the new kind of trust. He accepts the leadership of the court's opposition to Haman, now willing to confront the great enemy directly at the risk of his life. "Tamos nafshi impeleshtim (Let me die with the Philistines)," he declaims, quoting from the biblical hero Samson, who physically destroys the enemy of the Israelites, the Philistines, killing himself in the process.21 The reference to the iron bridge in the quote about trusting God is also an allusion to the means given to the nations of the world. In Jewish legend, when the Messiah comes, non-Jews will walk to Heaven on an iron bridge, while the Jews will walk on a paper bridge.22 Iron carries the association of force and arms. In the play, the Jews, in the person of Mordecai, are willing to use arms. At the very end of the play, he becomes the most highly placed minister in the state, wielding the power usually associated with the nations. Despite this, much of Mordecai's energy in the first two acts involves dodging power rather than confronting it. A scene in which he and Haman compete to see who has the most powerful voice provides an illustration. Haman has just 19. The Jewish Writings of Steven Schwartzchild, ed.

Unfortunately, I was not able to find this in Ginzburg's Legends of the Jews or Bialik's Book of Legends. I checked back to Hellerstein's footnotes, but in none does she explain the provenance. I have come across this legend before, and it is also used in Moshe Leib Halpern's poetry; see, for example, Moyshe Leib Halpern, In New York?A Selection, trans, and ed. Kathryn Hellerstein (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1982), 96-97. 374</page><page sequence="7">The Downfall of Haman proclaimed that the secret to all his conquests lies in his voice. He has only to open his mouth and entire peoples willingly submit to his rule. He challenges Mordecai to do as much. Mordecai accepts and imitates the modulations of Haman's voice so well that the latter is shaken. He is also the clear winner in the cursing department.23 In this contest between the powerful and the lowly, the hero is the spicy Yiddish language. But no people lay down their arms as a result. Mordecai remains as exposed to Haman's whims as before. While it is true that the more clownish aspects of the character are more promi nent in the first half and the more heroic in the second half, there is a fair amount of both throughout the play. In certain scenes, they seem inseparable from each other, as in the duel that Haman and Mordecai fight in the fourth act. Haman has just thrown himself on Esther and is discovered in this compromising position by Mordecai and Ahasuerus. When the villain sees Mordecai, he hurls himself upon him with a sword.24 In the French staging, Mordecai fights back with an umbrella.25 The two pro tagonists cross weapons in the style of gentlemen defending their honor. But the nature of Mordecai's weapon, an umbrella, deflates the heroic mode. His is the weapon of the little man, who does not have the accoutrements of power, who does the best he can. Haman's murderous impulse is met by playfulness, successfully deflecting it. The coexistence in Eomens mapole of the heroic mode associated with physical combat, and, let us call it the exilic mode, the mode of the one who, powerless, has to rely on his wit, replays the tension between the nation that is like other nations and the nation unlike other nations. In the former mode, the Jew fights with the weapons of all national heroes, arms. In the latter, the Jew manages to survive by relying on inner resources and not on arms. Within the play, then, the new understanding of the Jewish people?it is not chosen?coexists with the old?it is chosen. We are left with a question: Does Eomens mapole preserve rabbinic authority, or does it merely preserve rabbinic words, whose meaning departs significantly from that of authority? That is, do we have a Jewish people under God or a Jewish people who fend for themselves? The play is sufficiently ambiguous to allow for both readings. We would claim that all of Jewish secular modernity lives within this ambiguity. Rupture and Continuity?Is the Theater a Stage or an Altar? In the previous section, we treated Eomens mapole as literature, examining its language and structure. But it is a play, and a play that was performed. The very fact that it was theater, modern Yiddish theater at that, signals the secularization of the Jewish tradition in several different ways. In the first place, modern Yiddish theater broke through the confines imposed on theater by the rabbis, who restricted it to amateur performances on 23. Sloves, Homens mapole, 47-49. It is possible that this scene was inspired by the contest between hazanim often present in traditional purimshpiln. See Khone Shmeruk, "Ha-demut ha-komit," in Mahazot mikra'iyim be-yidish 1697-1750 (Jerusalem: Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, 1979), 52. 24. Sloves, Homens mapole, 94?95. 25.

Second, by stressing the visual, the plastic arts in general, it chal lenged the primacy the rabbis gave to abstract reasoning and to the word. It made possible a sensual expression that was otherwise absent. It expressed the moder nizes' thirst for a vitality and a breadth they felt lacking in the rabbinic tradition. Sloves put it thus: "Our 'people of the bookness' has developed in us a kind of fetishism of the word, an idolization of formal thinking.... We simultaneously lack an understanding of image thinking, which is the basis of every art."27 Theater's break with the rabbinic tradition also lay in the fact that, at least potentially, it was a mass phenomenon. Thousands, even hundreds of thousands, could see a performance over time. It could thus make available a set of ideals or aspirations that the rabbinic tradition, with its stress on talmudic reasoning, by definition an elite enterprise, could never do. Of course, the besmedresh, the rabbinic house of study and prayer, had exposed Jews all over the world and at all times to a common set of gestures and words. But for the modernizers, the death knell had tolled for religious institutions. The besmedresh was emptying out. Theater could take its place, becoming the communal gathering place, the point of transmission of the new/old tradition. "The Jewish public," Sloves said, "wandered from the besmedresh to the theater, and it is potentially, although not yet actually, the new sacred space {makom hakodesh)."2S In this view, we can detect the long-standing tension between bimah and bamah. In Hebrew, bimah is the word for "stage" and bamah the word for "altar." The philo sopher Shmuel Trigano noted that already in the Bible, the term bamah was associated with idols, foreign gods.29 Subsequent rabbinic commentary equated the theater, bamah, with idolatry as well. We even find one rabbinic speculation that in the mes sianic era, theaters would all be transformed into houses of study.30 For modernizers such as Sloves, it was the reverse. Houses of study would turn into theaters, by which they meant houses of study in another mode. Theater, in the modernizing outlook, was not false but true service. It gave individuals access to the truth about their condition, renewed their bonds to each other and even to life itself. To be modern was to recog nize the bamah, stage, as the new potential bimah, altar. 26. Homens mapole was not performed by professional actors, although the stage director, the musical director, and set designer for the French performance were professionals. So were the stage directors of all the other performances. The play was almost two hours long, involving approximately thirty to forty actors. This was quite a difference in scale from the makeshift amateur theater of the traditional purimshpiln, and even though it was not literally professional, it had the scale and structure of professional theater. 27.

The herald introduces the characters as though they were receiving an 'aliyah, that is, as though they were being called to the altar to say a blessing over the Torah. He uses the expression ya'amod, "so and so will stand."31 Once again, we need to remember that this language is meant to reflect standard formulas of the purimshpil. To draw from it a serious intention either to make the stage sacred or to make the altar secular would be to miss the obvious lightness of the tone, its parodie nature. It means to play with the original, to temporarily escape its authority, but not to replace it. Nonetheless, the play does introduce a tension between stage and altar. Is the altar demoted to being a stage, leaving only popular entertainment in its stead? Or is the stage elevated to the status of an altar, itself becoming the site of a connection unavailable elsewhere? In a later section of the play, it would indeed seem to be the latter. Esther tells Mordecai that she will go to Ahasuerus to plead for the life of her people, even if it means giving up her own. Mordecai replies that a time will come after the memory of Haman will have been blotted out, in which "Jewish playwrights will compose plays about Haman's defeat and Jewish actors will perform the wonderful story of Esther the Queen and Mordecai the Righteous."32 The stage itself becomes the commem orative site of these events rather than the recitation of the book of Esther in the synagogue, as instituted by the rabbis. In his championship of the stage, Sloves certainly did not intend to include all theater production. Jewish theater meant art theater, which he, along with many other Jewish intellectuals, distinguished from shund, vulgar entertainment. Art theater had nothing to do with lewd clowning or with mere song and dance. It was the vehicle for conveying the people's destiny and its life-affirming spirit, its bitokhn. This could be done in a humorous vein and with song and dance, as Homens mapole testifies. It could, however, never appeal to the lower instincts and be a diversion for its own sake. Its task was to elevate, to show a greater reality, unavailable in the humdrum of daily existence. The irony was that the great majority of Jewish spectators flocked to shund rather than to the art theater.33 Sloves blamed this preference on the rabbis, who, by associating all theater with moshav letzim, with ridiculous and lewd behavior, had accustomed the people to expect this. This antitheatrical prejudice prevented them from seeking in the bamah, stage, what they had previously sought in the bimah, altar. "We are far from our fathers and grandfathers," Sloves wrote, "but the ban on idolatry, on filthy clowning, still persists in our unconscious. The old hatred [for theater] has disappeared but a kind of contempt, a not taking it 31. Sloves, Homens mapole, 9?11. 32. Ibid., 75. 33. Michael C. Steinlauf, "Jewish Theater in Poland," Polin: Journal of Polish Jewish History 16 (November 2003): 85. He says that five Yiddish theaters in Warsaw were offering shund in the early 1930s at the same time the only Yiddish art theater closed down. This was a phenomenon repeated in most centers of Jewish population, most especially in the United States. See Nahma Sandrow, Vagabond Stars (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1977), 110: "Shund is the sort of art that most cultures and most people like best." 377</page><page sequence="10">Annette Aronowicz seriously, has remained." One can appreciate Eomens mapole as Sloves's attempt to reverse this tendency. In the face of opposition from both the classical rabbinic tradition and a large portion of the Jewish public, he and many other mod ernizers wanted to give the stage a religious meaning. If we take a step back, we see that in many respects the tension between bimah and bamah revolved around one central issue: the location and nature of transcen dence. The modernizers claimed that the visual and the corporal?in short, the sensual?needed to replace the word?too abstract a medium?in order to convey the transcendent spirit holding the people together. In the classical tradition, not only was the transcendent not accessible through images, it also was not meant to be the glue binding the people together. It was infinitely higher than them and meant to be served rather than experienced. But if we see a pull away from the rabbis, we also see that rabbinic terminology marks the distance. The theater was the new besmedresh. Introducing oneself on stage was tantamount to receiving an ally ah, that is, to going up to the Torah. We see from this language that theater, prop erly purged of its vulgar elements, was seen as a kind of holy activity. This makes one thing very clear. We do not have to do with a simple opposition of secular and religious. Perhaps the rabbis' opposition to theater lay precisely in the fact that it represented not the absence of religion but rather an alternative one. But within Eomens mapole, the stage, as different as it was from an altar, still derived its sanc tity from the language of Jewish prayer. It symbolized an access to transcendence both like and unlike prayer. Rupture and Continuity?The Myth of Europe Modern Yiddish theater had another symbolic resonance, related to but inde pendent of its status as a potential altar. It represented the presence of Europe, as theater was not an inherently Jewish form but one borrowed from the surrounding culture. The presence of Europe, on the one hand, symbolized the move toward the world, away from what was felt to be the stultifying rabbinic tradition. On the other hand, Europe also needed to be kept at bay because the new secular culture could not simply be European tout court. It had to remain Jewish and separate. Only by going in both directions at once was one true to an authentically Jewish tradition. The secularizing move within the movement toward Europe is obvious. But a new sacred dimension, as we shall see, coexisted with the movement inwardly and outwardly as well. Eomens mapole symbolized this dialectic in its own way. True to the spirit of the purimshpil, which reflects the German and Italian popular theaters present at its inception in the sixteenth century, Sloves borrowed freely from the theater of his time.35 Most especially visible was the mark of the Russian and German 34.

Many reviews mention the traces of Vsevolod Meyerhold, Evgenii Vakhtangov, Alexander Granovsky, or Bertolt Brecht in the staging of the play.36 In fact, each of the major directors of Homens mapole had been a student, often directly, of these great masters.37 Ironically, perhaps, Homens mapole, &amp; play con veying a small minority's collective destiny in a Jewish language, stood at the center of the newest European theater currents of its time. Given that Brecht remained unknown in France until the mid-1950s, and that the first work of Meyerhold was translated into French only in 1963, one could claim that it was a bridge not only between the Jewish tradition and Europe but also between various currents within the European tradition itself.38 Oscar Fessier, the talented director of the French and Belgian productions, gave an interview shortly after the first performance of Homens mapole in Paris in which he discussed some of the details of this avant-garde European pedigree. In keeping with the general movement of all twentieth-century avant-garde theater away from the word, he emphasized the importance of all the arts. Theater is lit erature, he said, but also "mime, rhythmical movement, light, color," all of which must work together to produce an over all harmony. In line with many modernizers who insisted that theater must reveal rather than hide its conventions, Fessier spoke of the actors presenting themselves as actors, of changing the decorations in front of an open stage, of having one prop serve different functions. He empha sized stylized movement, indicated the importance of the visual and drew attention to the ensemble acting of the cast. His many references to the commedia dell'arte signaled the presence of the European avant-garde, as it had become the source of inspiration of so much twentieth-century theater.39 Mahazot mikra 'iyim be-yidish, the first half of which is devoted to the history and origin of'the purimsh pil.

When Fessier spoke of theater as a kind of holy day in the grayness of the week, elevating and inspiring people beyond the humdrum of daily existence, one can hear echoes, for instance, of Vakhtangov's notion of the "purifying, elating role of art," of the necessity of bringing joy on earth.40 For many other modernists, theater was also to be a kind of sacred festival, suspending the ordinary rules of life.41 This was closely tied to a political and social program. Modern theater would mean the ascendance of a popular culture, long repressed. Precisely in expressing popular sentiment, and in being a mass spectacle, it would reflect the challenge to the bourgeoisie, who reigned in nineteenth-century theater.42 It would be more than a reflection, though. It would transform people from spectators into actors in their own lives by showing them the malleable nature of social conditions and by making them aware of conflicts and contradictions.43 Any number of these ideas could be found both in the writings of the general European avant-garde and in those of Sloves and his circle. Homens mapole, embodying the staging techniques and the philosophy typical of the avant-garde, had thus made ample room for Europe. But the countermovement was needed as well in order to make modern Jewish culture authentic. The artist needed to discover something that was genu inely Jewish. Sloves insisted in his forward to the play and elsewhere that Yiddish culture had to find a specifically Jewish style.44 This style had been lost in the late nineteenth century, when Avraham Goldfadn, the founder of modern Yiddish theater, and Jacob Gordin, one of its most important early playwrights and direc tors, had indiscriminatingly turned to Europe without attempting to integrate its influence into a preexisting Jewish framework.45 This explains the difficulties the Yiddish theater was then facing, according to Sloves. It had not established its own distinctive voice but, as he put it, had gotten stuck "in the smoke and fumes of a foreign mystique."46 In bringing back the purimshpil, the only 40.

But the dialectic of inside and outside also operated on another level. From the words of Sloves and Fessier, one might conclude that Europe meant strictly cultural creations?its literature, theater, and languages. Europe, however, was much more than that. It appears not so much as a specific area of the world but as the world. It is not a geographic location but a mythological site, the image of the all-encompassing, of what truly is, but because it is not yet empirically present everywhere, it is also the location of a hope. At once associated with a specific space and time, it is also dissociated from being just this space and this time. In the praises bestowed upon Homens mapole as a European spectacle, one can overhear echoes of this mythological dimension.47 The Jews, without ceasing to be Jews, nonetheless stop being a parochial group with parochial inter ests. They coincide with the universal, with what is always and everywhere. This view of Europe was hardly unique to modernizing Jews. It was, in fact, a sign of their secularization because it was so widely shared by the world at large, both European and non-European. Yet it did not go unchallenged among some Jewish modernizers. From a certain angle, the Zionists posed a challenge to it. They had been arguing from the later nineteenth century that a divorce was needed between the Jews and Europe. Europe's very universalism could only lead to assimilation or to physical destruction. The Jews needed to establish sover eignty, either political or cultural, outside its geographic boundaries. Of course, most Zionists accepted many of the same assumptions about Europe as those who wanted to stay in it, but especially in the aftermath of the Second World War, their arguments about the unsuitability of Europe as a site for Jewish life had special cogency.48 We see from various writings of Sloves and others in his circle that they felt a need to respond to this challenge. The Yiddish monthly Oifsnai (Renewal) was inau gurated in Paris in 1947. Its editors declared in the first issue: Let the name "Oifsnai' be a symbol of our stubborn will to go on living and creating."49 Sloves, in his 47.

One only has to read Theodor Herzl to see how much of European culture he wanted to transplant to the new Jewish society.

The congress fully confirms the bankruptcy of the idea of 'yetsiat Europe,' (the Exodus from Europe) that Jewish culture in Europe is done for and not worth investing in."51 The refusal to give up on Europe had two bases. It was, in the first place, understood as an act of resistance against the forces that had tried to eliminate the Jewish presence there. "Du shtey ikh un du vel ikh shteyen (Here I stand, and here will I remain)," says Mordecai to the palace guard when the latter asks him to get out.52 The context of this line is best understood as a reaction to the persecution of the war. But this attitude continued after the war. To leave would be ceding, after the fact, to the murderous forces. To rebuild is to continue to resist to all who had wanted to annihilate the Jewish presence from the world, and Europe, as we said earlier, was the world. The second reason for staying, although related, was also different. Europe was an idea that the Second World War could not destroy. It could still be realized?more than that, it would be realized?if Jews linked their destiny to the Soviet Union and to the struggle of the working classes all over the world. For Sloves and many others in the aftermath of the war, communism represented the core progressive idea, the future of Europe and thus of the world. Several state ments made in preparation for and during the culture congress of 1948 indicated this attitude. "European Jewry," said Sloves, "has not yet reached its equilibrium but neither had it reached it before the war. It has hope. It has aligned itself with the fate ofthat world to which tomorrow belongs."53 The last few words are a trans parent reference to the Soviet Union. In an earlier article, he had asked rhetorically, "Only three years after the war, is it still possible to speak about a European Jewry?" The answer is obviously yes, even if that Jewry is much diminished phys ically and spiritually. He added, "Those who fail to recognize this are the same as those whose hatred of the Soviet Union blinds them to its heroism and to the Jewish accomplishments there."54 In short, those who fail to recognize the signs of a viable Jewish life in Europe do so because they fail to see the hope that the Soviet Union represents for Jews. In Sloves's view, the Soviet Union made possible a political solution in which Jews could both share power with non-Jews and retain their cultural distinc tiveness as a people. The great feat of the October Revolution had been to grant 50. "Der Feierlekhe derefenung-zitsung," Oyfsnay 6-7, nos. 13-14 (July-August 1948): 4, Mus?e d'art et d'histoire du judaisme. 51. A.

This was the true Europe he envisioned inhabiting. At this moment, the Soviet model had not yet been accepted in the wider world, but the victory of the Soviets against the forces of fascism was a harbinger of further victories to come. It would liberate the world and, along with it, the Jews. We are not claiming that his equation of the idea of Europe and communism is characteristic of Jewish modernity. Very common, however, is the idea of Europe as something worth fighting for, something worth realizing. The great Russian Jewish historian, Simon Dubnow, for instance, expressed much the same thing, although his vision did not include communism at all. In 1939, he wrote, "Now, at the time of the most terrible counter-revolution, we celebrate the 150th anniversary of the great French Revolution, which established a new epoch in world history_We stand or fall with the progress or regress of mankind as a whole, and not with a few of its degenerate parts."56 In his words, Europe is the idea of the French Revolution, which is meant for the world as a whole, and the Jews must stand with the whole world to fight for this idea, against those within Europe who want to defeat what Europe really is. Much later, in the work of the great French Jewish philosopher Emmanuel Levinas, admittedly of a different intellectual milieu, we nonetheless find the same expression of the special affinity of the Jews and Europe.57 In the context, he, too, was speaking primarily not of geography but of an idea. But, as we mentioned earlier, not all modernizers accepted this symbiosis. The Zionists were joined by those who argued not so much for a political entity outside the geographic boundaries of Europe as for a sharp cultural divorce. The famous poem of the great modernist poet Yankev Glatshteyn, "Good Night, World," written in 1938, comes to mind. It is worth reproducing in part: Good night, wide world, big stinking world Not you but I slam shut the gate. 55. This is the position he argued again and again in his many attempts to convince Soviet offi cials to reinstate Yiddish culture.

The connection between the Jews and Europe is, in a sense, everywhere in Levinas's work, as one of the ways he understood his task was as a translator of the Jewish notion of the universal into the philosophical language of the West, in order to challenge its hegemony from within. For some specific references to this connection, see Levinas, "La traduction de l'?criture," in Israel, judaisme et l'Europe (Paris: Gallimard, 1984), 361, 368, where he identifies Europe with the universal.

Not only is Europe the world, but also it is associated with what is wide, broad, and all-encompassing: "Good night, wide world." It is also light, artificially light, perhaps, but contrasted to the faintly lit, autumnal Jewish ghetto. All the references to going back to the Jewish world identify it with a cramped, dusty, crooked space. That space is clearly rabbinic, indicating that Glatshtein, despite the joy he proclaims in returning to it, continues to associate it with a shutting out of the world. His ambi guity toward both the world and the rabbis is palpable. The world might stink, but it is also wide. Jewish life might be blessed, but it is hunchbacked and the leaves are not yet green on the withered tree. The divorce the poet calls for is the only act of sovereignty Jews have left?"Not you but I slam the gate"?in a murderous or indif ferent Europe. But it does not eliminate the secret attraction for "the world," which the poem expresses at the same time as it condemns it. Sloves's rebuttal to this attitude can be found in an essay he wrote in 1954 about the Yiddish writer of note, Joseph Opatoshu. He admired his erudition: "Opatoshu's intellectual baggage is unusually rich. There isn't a field of Jewish knowledge with which he is unfamiliar: history, cultural history, philosophy, litera ture. He is expert (baki) in Talmud, in rabbinic literature, in kabbalah, in musar literature and in Hasidism."59 He also praised the writer's outstanding knowledge of the Hebrew and Yiddish literatures of all eras. In addition, of course, Sloves mentioned that he was equally comfortable in world literature.60 The bulk of his essay illustrates how, in his literary achievements, this extraordinary learning combined with Opatoshu's commitment to the Jewish people. But then, regrettably, something shifted after the Second World War. Opatoshu, in his latest collection of short stories, turned to Hasidism and declared modern Yiddish culture a spent coin, an insufficient basis for the true Yiddish way, yidishkayt. For him, "the spark of Jewishness, is to be found only in the Gerer Hasidic prayerbook," Sloves summarized.61 Cut to the quick, he fired back. This kind of attitude, he claimed, was to turn one's back on history. It was to hold up a historical anachronism as the sole basis for a tradition. It was "to shut one's eyes to the future and proclaim a yesterday that is forever gone."62 It was, in short, to be completely mistaken about the course of events. The real source of his impassioned opposition, however, was that Opatoshu had chosen that part of the rabbinic tradition, the hasidic one, which had most definitively shut its doors against the world, had most refused contact and exchange with the nations of the world. This is not merely going back to the past. It is to refuse the true heritage of the Jewish tradition, which is to be in and for the world, although also refusing to blend with it. This criticism came out most clearly in the comments he made about one of Opatoshu's essays, reprinted after the war, "What is Yidishkayt?" In the earlier version, he 59.

Ibid., 228. 385</page><page sequence="18">Annette Aronowicz had listed as constitutive elements of "Jewishness" the prophets, Maimonides, Moses Hess, Spinoza, Karl Marx, and I. L. Peretz.63 In the 1949 reprint, however, he took out the name of Marx. Sloves was appalled and asked rhetori cally, "Who knows, if in a later version of the essay, after taking out the name of Karl Marx, he would not take out the name of Spinoza?"64 Who were Marx and Spinoza for Sloves? Marx was the symbol of the struggle of the working classes of all nations for a better world. Spinoza, as the play that Sloves wrote about him in 1955-56 testifies, was the great proponent of the secular way of being.65 He was the fighter for an open world, in which Jew meets non-Jew in a common struggle for truth and justice, independent of religious auth ority. Sloves was perfectly well aware that neither Marx nor Spinoza wanted to share in the destiny of the Jewish people. Both, in fact, were no longer part of the Jewish people. But despite this, the world identified them as Jews and, in Sloves's view, for good reason. Their ideas breathed with the idea of one mankind that Sloves identified with the prophetic tradition.66 In a way, they were all the more Jewish for being recognized as European as well. It signified the breakdown of ghetto walls that mod ernizers hoped for as the fulfillment of both the European and the Jewish tradition. They thus stand at the opposite end of the spectrum from the Gerer rebbe's besme dresh, prayer house and house of study. They embrace what he shuts out. All of Sloves's writings attest to his conviction that yidishkayt can never be based exclusively on Marx and Spinoza. We saw earlier that he even admired Opatoshu's knowledge of rabbinic sources, which he himself did not have. He could not bear, however, the idea of a complete separation of the Jews from the world. Marx and Spinoza were the Europe he identified with the world. One could perhaps turn the formulation around and claim that the Europe he recognized coincided with a secularized Judaism, one that advocated for "one world," a neutral public space freed from religious authority, one identified not with remaining a people apart but with the fight for social justice.67 The line between that Judaism and 63. Ibid., 226. 64. Ibid., 228. 65. Sloves, Baruchfun Amsterdam (New York: Yidish Kultur Farband, 1956). For a discussion of what it means to be a secular Jew in the play, see Annette Aronowicz, "Spinoza Among the Jewish Communists," Modern Judaism 24, no. 1 (February 2004): 1-35. 66. In Baruch, 80, Spinoza asks the rabbi whether there can be any contradiction between mentschlikhkayt and yidishkayt. In this context, he is asking rhetorically whether concern for all of mankind can be in contradiction with concern for the Jews. He says the rabbi himself had taught him this connection (ibid., 54). 67. In an essay that he wrote in 1960 titled "Secularism and the Thought of Israel," Levinas argues that the secular political space made possible by modernity is a fulfillment of the Jewish tra dition's notion of justice: "The idea of a society putting religion between parentheses in the name of religion itself is concretized in the idea of the foreigner, the 'ger'" (in Unforeseen History, trans. Nidra Poller [Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2004], 114). "The idea that human society stands on relations independent of religion in the ecclesiastical or clerical sense of the term is carried by the Jewish religion itself (ibid., 124). Sloves would never have formulated matters in the same language, but he certainly fully shared the sense that a secularized Europe, in which one could stand in a public space neither Jewish nor Christian, and the Jewish tradition, implied one another. 386</page><page sequence="19">The Downfall of Haman that Europe blurs. Is it irrelevant that Marx and Spinoza were both of Jewish origin? To answer both yes and no was to be a truly modem Jew. There was a natural con vergence. We come back to Europe being both inside and outside the Jewish tradition. The authority of the rabbis was most undermined here. Not only was the line between Jewish and not Jewish no longer drawn on the basis of observance to the commandments, but also that line could no longer be fixed at all. For the moder nizers, it was always redrawing itself on the basis of a double contact?with Jewish sources and with the European tradition. It was defined by its fluidity. Only two constants were required to maintain a specifically Jewish identity. The first was the very desire to perpetuate it, which required knowledge of both Jewish and European sources. The second was a social conscience. Rejected out of hand was the observance of the commandments as applied to daily life, Jewish law, as the defining core of that identity. In this turn toward Europe, the secularizing move, the move toward the world was very clear. But the symbolic pointing to the sacred that accompanies it was equally clear. The Europe toward which secular Jews of Sloves's type moved stood outside ordinary historical pro cesses and geographic limits. It functioned on another plane. It both already was and only merely foreshadowed the ideal pattern of life for all mankind. At the present moment, sixty years after Homens mapole, a large number of people are probably just on the other side of the cusp of discovering that Europe is not the world. It is becoming possible to see how much of a sacred status it had acquired in the imagination, not just of Jews but also of millions of others. It might seem farfetched to say that the myth is only now being displaced, when the colonial empires have broken up, in some cases for over half a century, and when the continent of Europe has lost its predominant place in world affairs. But Europe was never either merely a geographic entity or even its political power, although the myth of Europe could not have arisen without it. It was an idea, a specific kind of universalism, a way of organizing life and thought. It is to this idea that was more than an idea that the Yiddish modernists subscribed. To give this kind of symbolic valence to Europe is not a particularly Jewish. Yet within the turn to Europe, the Yiddishists clung fiercely to the preservation of Jewish peoplehood. Their Europe was not the Europe of individuals liberated from the chains of local identities, finally entering the universal. It was the space that made collective Jewish life possible, without the prior oppression. The whole project of Yiddish modernity was linked to perpetuating a people, in the face of what was perceived as imminent decline and decay. To the Yiddish modernizers, to be Jewish was, first and foremost, to share in a collective destiny that one could accept after the fact but not choose. The challenge was to live in this collective and to enter into the larger world at the same time. Homens mapole attempted, on the aesthetic level, to respond to this challenge. It was a play about the salvation of the group, aimed at an audience familiar enough with particular Jewish practice and speech to recognize its parodie elements. But in incorporating avant-garde European theater, it became European itself, part of the world at large. We come back to the sacred function of theater, in this case as the symbol of a non Jewish culture entering into a Jewish world and of a Jewish world existing 387</page><page sequence="20">Annette Aronowicz within a non-Jewish space. It became the paradigmatic site of an interweaving that both reflected ordinary life and aspired beyond it. In expressing the hope for a symbiosis between the Jewish tradition and Europe, the Yiddishists rejected, at least in part, one aspect of European modernity, the premium placed on a universal, which required for its accomplishment the destruction of local, corporate identities. Yiddish modernists struggled to articulate a different kind of universal. As such, they join many such struggles, originally of marginalized nationalities, and now, ironically, of the European peoples them selves, in the face of free market globalization. The struggle to preserve particular peoples as nonnegotiable parts of reality, while not giving up on the idea of inter secting with the world, might, with some distance, prove to be one of the signifi cant religious struggles of our era, both during the flowering of the "myth of Europe" and in its decline. Eomens mapole was not consciously engaged in this struggle. It wanted to express harmony. Nonetheless, in championing a particular people's singular culture and yet embodying its desire to reflect the world, to express the universal, it points to a religious structure in its own humble way. Conclusion Modern Yiddish theater, at least in its highest aspirations as demonstrated in Eomens mapole, was a symbolic condensation of perennial Jewish concerns?the nature of the Jewish people, the proper access to the sacred, and the tension between particular and universal. In giving shape to these key problems, it moved back and forth between rabbinic and nonrabbinic understandings. This kind of secularization is not so much a break with a specific religious tradition as it is a sign that it has encountered a strong external current. Would an analysis such as the one attempted here have any relevance to Jews who claim either to be secular or to be observant of the rabbinic tradition? An Orthodox or hasidic Jew would see in a play like Eomens mapole not conti nuity but rupture masquerading as continuity. The Jewish people are no longer driven by the service to God in the way dictated by the tradition. What sense could calling it chosen possibly have? For very similar reasons, a secular Jew would see it as rupture as well. What does the kind of transport and inspiration given by theater really have to do with prayer? This essay does not wish to paper over the change. Yet we would maintain that the kind of Yiddish culture represented here still held opposites together. The two sides still shared a key vocabulary, and the new meanings did not eliminate the older ones. Can we speak of Jewish secularization when that is no longer the case?

Perets and the Canonization of Yiddish Theater,' 'Jewish Social Studies 1, no. 3 (Spring 1995): 56: "For what does it finally mean for a Jew to act, to play someone else, if not to let the Ultimate Other, the non-Jew, inside?" 388</page></plain_text>
