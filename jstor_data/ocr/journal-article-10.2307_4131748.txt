<plain_text><page sequence="1">Christopher R. Browning. The Origins of the Final Solution: The Evolution ofNazi Jewish Policy, September 1939-March 1942, with contributions by Jiirgen Matthius. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, and Jerusalem: Yad Vashem, 2004. xii, 615 pp. Christopher Browning is perhaps most widely known for his seminal study of the motives of the "ordinary men" who perpetrated the systematic murder of European Jewry at the behest of the Third Reich. Nevertheless, in the past two decades he has devoted much of his attention to studying the processes and deci- sions that led the Reich to make systematic mass murder its official policy and to provide the impetus and means for its implementation. Now he has brought his em- pirical findings and interpretations together in a single volume that provides the most rigorous, cogent, and lucid analysis currently available of this crucial prob- lem in the history of the encounter between Nazi Germany and the Jews. 380</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews The book was commissioned in the early 1 980s as part of Yad Vashem's com- prehensive history of the Holocaust. It was envisioned as the second of three vol- umes examining the evolution of Nazi Jewish policy, following one devoted to the interval between the establishment of the Third Reich in 1933 and Germany's in- vasion of Poland six years later and preceding one surveying the so-called final so- lution's actual execution. These three works, in turn, were to provide a backdrop for a series of country-focused studies concentrated largely on victims and by- standers. Only some of the country-focused studies have been completed, and they have been published only in Hebrew. Browning's is the first of the three perpetra- tor-focused volumes to appear in any language. To understand the book's scope and argument, this context must be kept in mind. Indeed, some readers may be disturbed by the title's seeming suggestion that "the origins of the final solution" are to be found no earlier than September 1939. Browning has worked around this editorially imposed difficulty by construing the notion "final solution" strictly and delimiting his focus accordingly. Because the term appeared in Nazi documents only after that date, in the context of plans for mass expulsion of Polish and other Jews to a territory beyond areas designated for German settlement, the book's first task must be to determine the connection be- tween the conquest of Poland and Nazi thinking about how to eliminate the osten- sible Jewish danger once and for all. And because the sense of the term was eventually transmuted from expulsion to systematic total killing, the course and causes of the transmutation must be the book's central theme. Hence the book does not purport to explain the entire complex of phenomena commonly grouped to- gether as "the Holocaust" but only the thinking and actions of the Nazi regime's leaders and agents during the interval when they themselves spoke of finally solv- ing the Jewish question. Much has changed during the twenty years of the book's gestation in the way historians approach that subject. When Browning began his study, the intentional- ist-functionalist debate was at its height. Browning was an early critic of both po- sitions: unlike the functionalists he believed that the total murder of European Jewry was always a possible outcome of Hitler's world view, but he also rejected the intentionalist notion that the Nazi regime aimed with systematic deliberation at that outcome from the start. Today most historians have joined Browning in maintaining that by late 1941 Nazi leaders had moved from a Hitler-inspired de- termination to solve the Jewish problem one way or another to the conviction, sim- ilarly encouraged by Hitler, that the only acceptable way to accomplish this goal was to kill every Jewish man, woman, and child within the regime's reach. Most also agree that that movement occurred gradually and in stages, with changing con- ditions on the eastern front serving as a principal catalyst for the testing and elim- ination of alternative approaches. What remains at issue (in a voluminous literature of which Browning is a master) is the set of contexts that gave rise to increasing radicalization and ultimately induced the regime to pursue mass murder. Brown- ing argues that the matrix for radicalization was "the euphoria of victory." Indeed, he states, "the vision of the [ultimate] Final Solution ... crystallized in the minds of the Nazi leadership" between mid-September and late October 1941, at a time when the German army was advancing against Leningrad, Moscow, and Kiev, and 381</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Hitler anticipated imminent Soviet collapse (424, cf. 327). In this heady atmo- sphere, he suggests, Nazi leaders believed they could remake Europe however they wished, including realizing Hitler's prophecy of a continent cleansed of Jews. The "euphoria of victory" thesis remains hotly contested. Browning mar- shals much evidence for his position while noting different interpretations. In the end, as he admits, some speculation must enter the debate, because the paper trail is not complete. His case is strong but hardly airtight. For example, the dating to October 1941 of the notion that mass killing was the preferred way to deal with Jews throughout Europe seems persuasive, but Browning notes that at that time it remained unclear whether systematic killing would begin the following spring or after the war. The decision to begin even before spring 1942 must then have been taken subsequently, and something other than victory euphoria, which dissipated during November 1941, must have brought it on. Browning does not offer a way out of this problem. Other points can be debated as well. Some recent research has indicated that mass killings of Jews perpetrated by groups of Romanians, Croats, Ukrainians, Balts, and Poles during the first weeks after Germany's June 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union may have started some Nazi officials thinking about making total murder their own policy. Browning does not consider this argument (although Jiir- gen Matthiius, whom Browning invited to contribute a chapter parallel to his on the evolution of Nazi policy in the wake of the Soviet invasion, gives it some guard- ed credence). Also, although Browning engages suggestions in the literature that decisive pressure to adopt systematic killing as Reich policy may have come up the chain of command from military and civilian personnel in the east, he still prefers a top-down analysis and does not fully rebut some seemingly telling pieces of evidence pointing to a greater role for local officials. These quibbles, however, are minor compared to the book's surpassing achievement as a work of incisive analysis, intelligent synthesis, and clear expli- cation.
