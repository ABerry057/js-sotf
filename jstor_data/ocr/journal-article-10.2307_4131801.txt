Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2000. viii, 340 pp. This is a book about the junction of European modernity, Jewish life, and new forms of social knowledge. Illuminating the intellectual history of Jewish so- cial science primarily in Central Europe from 1880, but especially after the turn of the century, to the threshold of catastrophe in the waning moments of Weimar, So- 173</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews cial Sciences and the Politics of Modern Jewish Identity offers a keenly researched, thoughtful study both of the social consequences of Emancipation and the man- ner in which these consequences were assessed by Jewish social scientists trained in modern tools of statistics, anthropology, public health, and sociology. Astute in its selection of institutions (including the Vereinfiirjiidische Statistik); key schol- ars (including Arthur Ruppin, Hugo Hoppe, and Leo Motzkin); and subjects (pop- ulation, health, physical anthropology, and economic issues), the study invites at- tention to vexing issues for students of Jewish life and history and, more broadly, the development of the social sciences. The uneven process by which Jews gained entry after the French Revolution into political, social, and economic Europe without having to undergo Christian conversion posed unprecedented questions about assimilation and identity; popu- lation trends and health; normalcy and exceptionalism; race and nation. As it turned out, in this period, unparalleled Jewish heterogeneity in the West, as well as trauma and emigration in the East and the extension of world Jewry in space and imagination to the United States and Palestine, coincided with the growth and de- velopment of new forms of academic social inquiry. Putatively objective, neutral, and scientific, discipline-based tools in anthropology, sociology, demography, and public health offered a cohort of urbane and well-trained Jewish scholars the means to know and represent more accurately the Jewish condition in the heart of modern Europe and to deploy systematic evidence to ask whether Jewish life in the Diaspora could thrive in the long-term under conditions of emancipation. Breaking with insular and elite-focused historiographical traditions, these social scientists, Hart shows, did more than record key features and patterns in post-Emancipation Jewish life. Their studies of physiology, marriage patterns, crime, morbidity and mortality, schooling, and work, among other subjects, also recast Jewish identity by answering such questions as: Who are the Jews? What marks their coherence and cohesion as a people? Which traits and abilities mark their distinct orientations and capacities? What defines the boundary between nor- mal and pathological? How can a plethora of trends in Jewish life be arrayed to shape coherent analytical narratives of social change? Social Science and the Politics of Jewish Identity thoroughly surveys a wide range of empirical studies and conceptual debates conducted by the first genera- tion of secular Jewish scholars to take possession of methodical social studies of their people. Two themes dominate the book. The first highlights the split between the regenerative and nationalist impulses of Zionists, who utilized the new social science to demonstrate that integration of Jews into the West threatened Jewish de- generation as much as did oppression and poverty in the East, and a diverse group of scholars Hart calls "diasporists," who believed in the possibility of a decent and normal future for Jews outside Palestine. Focusing mainly on Zionist social sci- ence, Hart persuasively demonstrates affinities linking their purposes, research, findings, and advocacy. This portrait of Zionist hegemony may be disproportion- ate. What was the actual balance between the two tendencies within the Jewish so- cial science community? This weighing-up is a bit elusive in the text. Where, more- over, shall we place the many scholars who sought to transcend these options via "scientific neutrality"? 174</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews The second central theme concerns the mutual constitution of Jewish and general social science. In a perceptive sociology of knowledge, Hart focuses on the deeply contradictory position of the Jewish social scientists. Their disciplines, concepts, research language, and broad orientation to social inquiry were drawn from general European social science. They utilized sources of data and key ideas that originated outside their Jewish milieu. Though modern and cosmopolitan, they were embedded, nonetheless, within the Jewish world by choice and necessity. In charting patterns of conversion and intermarriage; writing counter-narratives to combat dominant visions of Jewishness and disease; measuring the anthropolog- ical distinctiveness of Jews; and assaying their affinity for capitalism, Jewish so- cial scientists produced questions, designs, and strategies for the dissemination of knowledge geared to affect Jewish choices and possibilities. In pursuing these goals, general social science proved liberating. It facili- tated fresh, even unprecedented, modes of inquiry. Even today, data and analyses generated by Jewish social scientists in the early-twentieth century are still used (often credibly, Hart reminds us). But the utilization of the period's general so- cial science by Jewish scholars also imprisoned them within unfortunate debates, categories, and conceptions, especially dealing with key issues in biology and physical anthropology. Often, Jewish scholars found themselves uncomfortably reinforcing widespread prejudices about Jewish distinctiveness, even pathology, differing only in the spin they put on this information. Hart is to be applauded for not writing a history of his actors and their pe- riod that imposes on them what we know about their eventual fate. His stance is prospective, seeing choices and possibilities from the perspective of the actors on the basis of the information they possessed. His decision to frame the book in terms of quite recent discussions in the United States concerning intermarriage as measured by Jewish Federation-sponsored sample surveys introduces a slight- ly jarring quest for relevance. These extraneous pages do not detract, however, from this compelling treatise. Ira Katznelson Columbia University New York, New York</page></plain_text>
