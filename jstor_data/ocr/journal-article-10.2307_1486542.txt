<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stuart A. Cohen. The Scroll or the Sword? Dilemmas ofReligion and Military Service in Israel. Amsterdam: Harwood Academic Publishers, 1997. xii, 98 pp. In this slim volume, a Bar-Ilan political scientist traces the oft-times com- plex, controversial, and still evolving relationship between Israel's military and its religious (read Orthodox) community. Cohen first surveys traditional rabbinic thought on military questions, from Maimonides' familiar distinction between milhemet mitzvah (obligatory war) and milhemet reshut (optional war) to the views of more recent thinkers. Such writings, however, were purely theoretical and largely passive during the 2,000-year exile. All this changed with the rise of modem political Zionism and the establishment of the State of Israel. Suddenly these issues took on a</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 177 more real and urgent quality, forcing Orthodoxy to come to grips with the demands of military service. As I have discussed elsewhere, Orthodoxy's response to the challenges of modernity was bifurcated. Those who affirmed Zionism and all its implications gravitated toward the Mizrahi (now National Religious or Mafdal) party and its sundry offshoots. For Religious Zionists and their seminal thinkers, most notably Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, military service was seen as more than a mere civic duty. Rather, it was a religious obligation, part of the overall process of redemption inherent in the Zionist enterprise. The response to the same challenges by the haredim (ultra-Orthodox), associated mainly with Agudat Yisrael and its various outgrowths, was negative. As non- or anti-Zionists, haredim viewed the Zionist undertaking, at best, as just another secular government imposing on their religious lifestyle, and at worst, as an illegitimate attempt of a rogue Jewish government to force God's hand. Military service for males was deemed bitul Torah (a waste of time), with talmudic study being equated with military service in assuring Jewish survival. For women, service in the military was simply anathema. Due to these strident objections-and their political implications--he state, from the very outset, granted concessions. Deferments and/or exemp- tions were given for yeshiva students, whose numbers swelled over the years from several hundred to tens of thousands. Virtually automatic exemptions were instituted for haredi women, too. This blanket release from one of society's most serious and onerous obligations remains a sore point in the already-strained relationship between secular and religious in Israel. Even in the Religious Zionist camp, where military service for males and alternative service for females has long been the norm, some accommodations had to be made. An extensive chaplaincy service was established to provide the basic religious needs for full participation in military life. A network of hesder yeshivot was set up, enabling yeshiva students to combine periods of study with stints of military duty, despite the Israel Defense Forces' long-standing opposition to separate units of any kind. Concessions notwithstanding, the National Religious contingent has acquitted itself with great distinction in the IDF. Thus far Cohen covers familiar ground. His contribution lies in his discussion of the changes that have befallen both the IDF and the National Religious camp over the last two decades, fundamentally altering their historical relationship. While the IDF is still arguably Israel's most widely respected public institution, its star has dimmed appreciably in recent years,</page><page sequence="3">178 BOOK REVIEWS beginning with the 1973 Yom Kippur War, followed by the Lebanon incursion, the Intifada, and the on-again, off-again peace process. The de-ideologization and Westernization (Americanization?) of Israeli society has, as in most Western countries, resulted in a sharp decline in the status of the military. In the National Religious sector, equally profound changes have occurred. For one, the "haredization" of much of the community in recent years has led to far less enthusiasm for military service. Further, much of the National Religious community identifies strongly with the settler movement, which has a disparaging view of the IDF and its ability and/or willingness to defend settlers against Arab violence. Many leading religious lights of the community have issued decrees prohibiting soldiers from obeying orders to withdraw from the territories. Ironically, the same religious ideology that once motivated Mafdalniks into devoted military service may now propel them toward conscientious objection, insubordination, mutiny, or worse. While Cohen thinks that these are unlikely outcomes, I am not so sure. Rabin assassin Yigal Amir was not only a Bar-Ilan student, he was also a hesder yeshiva graduate, as were many of those involved in various underground violent plots uncovered in recent years. While the criminal activities of a handful of individuals should not be attributed to an entire group, the attitudes and mind-set reflected in such behavior are by no means confined to those few individuals. Increasingly, Israel's once-moderate National Religious community and its secular majority and government appear to be on a collision course. If and when substantial territorial withdrawals loom imminent, we may witness the kind of civil conflict that would make the Yamit episode pale into insignificance. In Cohen's own words, "Dilemmas between religious beliefs and military service ... now constitute a major item on the Israeli national agenda.... Instead of being a 'nation builder,' military service in the IDF now threatens to become a great 'nation divider'." Gary S. Schiff Baltimore Hebrew University Baltimore, Md.</page></plain_text>
