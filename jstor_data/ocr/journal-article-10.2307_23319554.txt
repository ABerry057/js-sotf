This troubled you so greatly that you decreed that all her descendants, all women, must suffer..."1 This interdisciplinaiy study of gender in Avot de Rabbi Natan,2 using a theoretical frame from cultural anthropology, is an enterprise of feminist historiography.3 Focusing on ARNB's singular formulation of aggadic accounts of Eve's sin, it A less developed version of this paper was presented at the Association for Jewish Studies Con ference 2008, Washington D.C., December 21-23, 2008 under the title: "Patriarchal Stewardship: Women and Gender Relations in Avot de Rabbi Natan. A and B." I warmly thank Dr. Jonathan Schofer for his suggestion that I consider Avot de Rabbi Natan from the perspectives of women and gender and the anonymous reviewers for their careful reading and improving suggestions. 1.

Polzer proposes a possible historical trajectory of Jewish women's experience and how that experience was perceived, manipulated and/or negotiated by the Jewish men who were the formulators and transmitters of rabbinic tradition. Generally speaking, traditions about women and gender in ARN demonstrate a stance on the natural, religious and social subordination of women to men, which I will des ignate "patriarchal stewardship." Yet the Eve traditions, especially those in ARNB, go beyond articulating this androcentric stance on gender differentiation and social hierarchy; they negotiate a cognitive, religious problem: why do women, and women alone, suffer and die in the process of biological reproduction if "be fruitful and multiply" is a divine imperative in Genesis 1:28? According to Tal Ilan, one of the most important tasks of the feminist study of rabbinic texts is to investigate their history of textual transmission to show "... how editing and copying worked in a specific direction—to belittle, denigrate and silence women."4 Indeed, previous feminist scholarship has devoted substantial discussion to the Eve traditions in ARN and parallels, viewing them, to different extents, as unambiguous illustrations of the rabbinic view of the inherent natural inferiority of women and their corresponding social subordination.5 Charlotte Fonrobert goes so far as to assert that ARN has "... a Tendenz in... [its] redac tion... which makes it one of the more misogynist texts in rabbinic literature."6 Certainly arguing whether one rabbinic text is more or less misogynist than another serves no real critical purpose; all such texts were composed and trans mitted by men and for men and, thus, are all androcentric, if not to some degree misogynist. However, it is useful to identify and distinguish the particular nuances of androcentrism/misogyny evident in different texts. I hope to offer con vincing evidence that the process of transmission and redaction was not always, so to speak, a one-way street. Indeed, a close examination of the Eve traditions in 4.

Fonrobert, Menstrual Purity, 229, n. 41, viewing ARNB as especially misogynist. However, the tradition she cites as from ARNB:9 (Menstrual Purity, 31) is actually the (probably) later Tanhuma parallel (Tanhuma Buber, Noah 1:14b). ARNB's formulation exhibits a significantly different reading. Although individual traditions in ARN are discussed in many publications on women and gender in rabbinic literature, no one has focused on the place of women and gender relations specifically in ARN. Jonathan Schofer makes some brief remarks about women and gender in his discussion of ARN's historical context in his recent monograph: The Making of a Sage: A Study in Rabbinic Ethics (Madison, WI: The University of Wisconsin Press, 2005), 37-38. Without a detailed study of the comparative material, he seems to have followed Fonrobert's assessment of ARN, especially ARNB, as especially misogynist: "...While much of this material has parallels in other rabbinic sources, Rabbi Nathan B has a misogynist bent that is notable" Schofer, Sage, 37, 200, n. 51. 208</page><page sequence="3">Misogyny Revisited Avot de-Rabbi Natan reveals a case where the redaction process developed in the direction of according women increased status and ritual agency through the per formance of their three commandments. The theological problem addressed by the Eve traditions in ARNB requires a theoretical frame that addresses both the cognitive and the ritual functions of religious tradition. Privileging the social function of rabbinic aggadah, Joshua Levinson recently remarked that when "cultures feel threatened they often begin to tell tales," tales which are "fictions of identity," through which "continued dominance" is achieved so that "...the community [can] guard its borders and defines for itself who is inside, who is outside, and why."7 In the case of the Eve traditions, the threat is theodicean, rather than social, disrupting the received understanding of how God works in the cosmos at large, prompting a specifically cognitive religious response. Cultural anthropologist Clifford Geertz's theory of religion is used as a theor etical model in which to frame the textual analysis, precisely because Geertz sees reli gion as first and foremost a cognitive human enterprise. I am well aware that Geertz's theory of religion and other theories of religion originating in schools of cultural and/or structural anthropology8 are now considered out of date, arguably because they are interested in the cognitive aspects of religion rather than its role as a discursive system of power and control. However, I strongly believe that good theory does not go out of date. Defining "good theory" as that which enables the critical analysis of phenomena so that they remain coherent and true to the dictates of their own enterprise, I feel that such theory remains relevant as long as the human phenomena it renders coherent remain pertinent. Indeed, other recent scholarship on rabbinic narrative and ritual employs Geertz's anthropological theories and methods to advantage.9 In line with methodologies of reading and textual analysis of the school loosely designated "literary approaches to the study of aggadah,"10 this study assumes that ARN evidences a type of aesthetic redactional poetics, "poetics" understood as how the particular forms and structures of a literary artifact generate meaning. Indeed, the poetics specific to the genres of exegetical midrash, 1 aggadic12 and halakhic13 narrative and sugyot of the Bavli14 have received 7.

Polzer substantial recent critical attention. This analysis assumes that, in places, ARN's redactional impulse is driven by a poetics peculiar to a redacted, composite text, in which the juxtaposition of textual units generates coherent meaning well beyond the sum of its parts. While previous literary study of aggadah has implicitly assumed this type of poetics as an aesthetic feature,15 Joshua Levinson has recently described it in detail.16 Following Michael Roberts' comparative work on poetics in Late Antiquity,17 Levinson deems this poetics as a "jeweled" or "mosaic" style, in which fragments of earlier materials "...are manipulated and juxtaposed in striking new combinations, often exploiting the contrast with the previous text in sense, situation or setting."18 This poetics generates meaning structurally, so that an individual literary unit contributes to the signifi cance of a larger redacted composition not simply by virtue of its surface content, but also by how that content, as well as its generic form, are juxtaposed with other individual units, whether proximate or distant.19 According to my reading, this poetic phenomenon is evident in certain sections of ARN, the Adam and Eve traditions under close analysis here a case in point.20 If so, the sig nificance of the individual traditions can only be fully appreciated by explicating their position in the overarching structure of the redactional unit. Given the current difficulties of assigning a date and provenance to either version of ARN (to be dis cussed below), this particular study will focus on the aesthetic and the ideological/ theological aspects of the texts under analysis, leaving a detailed exploration of a compatible historical/cultural context for ARN's views about women and gender for another study. Feminist historiography finds the reconstruction of historical trajectories of Jewish women's experience especially problematic, in that the historical evidence in Creation and Composition: the Contribution of the Bavli Redactors (Stammaim) to the Aggada, ed. Jeffrey L. Rubenstein (Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2005). 15. Although their analyses are not explicitly informed by such a poetics, it is assumed in the literary analyses of sugyot of the Bavli in Rubenstein, Talmudic Stories, and in many of the collected essays in Rubenstein, Creation and Composition, also in Wimpfheimer, Narrating the Law, and expli citly in David Rraemer, Reading the Rabbis: The Talmud as Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996). 16.

That is, lists, maxims, or narratives may be read together even if separated by a significant amount of text if prompts to do so are embedded in the units. Dvora Steinmetz's work implicitly assumes this type of redactional poetics in "Agada Unbound: Inter-Agadic Characterization of Sages in the Bavli and Implications for Reading Agada," in Rubenstein, Creation and Composition, 293 337; and in "Distancing and Bringing Near: A New Look at Mishnah Tractates Eduyyot and Avot," HUCA 73 (2003): 49-96. 20. Also, for instance, the composite narrative of the Destruction of Jerusalem in ARNA:4/. ARNB:6-9. 210</page><page sequence="5">Misogyny Revisited is almost exclusively textual, composed by and for men.21 Thus, care must be taken to distinguish methodologically between evidence of actual women's reli gious practices preserved in the texts, and discursive practices involving women. The former constitutes what women actually did to participate in their religious tradition in any given place and time, and hence, can be assumed to have been experienced as normatively valid and meaningful by practicing women themselves; the latter designates the way in which women are represented in the religious textual traditions and how that representation attempts to ideologi cally define and/or control various aspects of women's lives as lived, including how men should think about women and how both should interact with each other.22 Gender-focused study of rabbinic literary tradition has explored how its discursive practices have imagined and controlled Jewish women, their lives and bodies, both through theological constructs modeling the essential nature of womanhood,23 and, in halakhic texts, by legal mandates directing women's behav ior and gender relations, often informed by those theological constructs or by internal issues of authority.24 As recently remarked by Daniel Boyarin in his analy sis of a Babylonian talmudic narrative (B. Nedarim 20a-b) involving appropriate positions during sexual intercourse, such traditions should not be considered pri marily as evidence of what women were actually doing and thinking, but as dis course invoked . .in the struggle for rabbinic authority, .. .an instrument.. .which is, of course, against other men."25 If women's "discursive bodies," rather than their actual bodily practices, have been the focus of feminist scholarship in the 21. Little archaeological evidence is available to reconstruct the everyday lives of Jews, let alone Jewish women, during the rabbinic period, especially in the geographical region of ancient Babylonia where there has been no major excavation of a site showing Jewish occupancy since the mid-19th century. Dr. St. John Simpson, the chief curator of the Ancient Near Eastern collection at the British Museum, is currently working on archaeological evidence and the Babylonian Talmud (per sonal electronic communications, July 2010). For a classic study of archaeological evidence relating to the position of Jewish women in Palestine, see Bernadette J. Brooten, Women Leaders in the Ancient Synagogue: Inscriptional Evidence and Issues (Chico, CA: Scholars Press, 1982). 22. Chava Weissler, Voices of the Matriarchs: Listening to the Prayers of Early Modern Jewish Women (Boston: Beacon Press, 1998), 36-37, discusses this methodological distinction, here and in the rest of Ch. 3. 23. This literature is too vast to summarize here. Relating directly to the topic at hand, Judith Baskin's work exemplifies this approach: Baskin, Midrashic Women; and " 'She Extinguished the Light of the World.' " 24. Such scholarship attempts to reveal the ideological constructs implicit in halakhic rulings concerning women. For classic examples see Daniel Boyarin's pioneering deconstructionist analysis of rabbinic ideologies of gender and sexuality: Carnal Israel; and, Fonrobert, Menstrual Purity. And for different but equally interdisciplinary theoretical frames, see the work of Cynthia Baker, Rebuilding the House of Israel: Architectures of Gender in Jewish Antiquity (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2002) and Gail Labovitz, Marriage and Metaphor: Constructions of Gender in Rabbinic Litera ture (New York: Lexington Books, 2009). 25. Daniel Boyarin, Socrates and the Fat Rabbis (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009), 158. Boyarin reads the narrative primarily as a discursive strategy to assert rabbinic control over com peting cultural practices rather than reflecting actual women's practices, "[g]iven the paucity of evi dence for actual women's power" in the world in which the Talmud was composed. 211</page><page sequence="6">Natalie C. Polzer area of rabbinic Judaism, it has not been for want of awareness of the critical place of actual women's practice, but due to the lack of evidence. However, despite the insurmountable difficulties in reconstructing women's actual practices in ancient Judaism for the purposes of analysis, it is important to keep in mind that they existed independently from rabbinic discursive practices. While not going so far as to view the narrative in B. Nedarim 20a b as evi dence of actual women's experience, Boyarin claims it reflects a cultural climate in which Jewish women's authority challenged rabbinic control.26 Generally speak ing, contemporary feminist analysis of women in traditional Judaism and its lit erary production assumes three stances: (1) critique of an inherent, systemic structural and ideological oppression of women in rabbinic social and religious culture;27 (2) the same critique, with the caveat that the rabbis attempted to ame liorate women's status through halakhic development;28 and, (3) a focus on how Jewish women assumed a stance of challenge and/or resistance to male authority as well as to discursive, ideological control.29 An analytical stance other than obvious critique or assumption of resistance risks being labeled as apologist for essentialist ideologies/theologies of women and gender roles in contemporary tra ditional Judaism. Let it be clear at the onset that apology for rabbinic androcentr ism and misogyny is scarcely the intention here, but rather, a literary exploration of their unique nuances evident in ARN's Eve traditions. Certainly, Jewish women did not always resist androcentric, even what we may well deem misogynist, rabbinic discursive practices. A case in point is the eventual incorporation into popular women's religious practice of the mishnaic set of three women's commandments, neglect of which the Mishnah deems so serious as to warrant the sentence of death in a manner unique to women: "For three transgressions women die in childbirth: if they are not meticulous in the per formance of niddah, the dough offering (hallah) and the kindling of Sabbath lights" (M. Shabbat 2:6). This version of the set, presumably its earliest extant 26. According to Boyarin, Socrates, 159, Jewish women wished to restrict the freedom of their husbands to engage in any position in sexual intercourse other than the "missionary" position, due to a popular "Jewish pietistic practice of sexual hygiene," for fear of endangering the fetus. Whatever the cultural/historical reality behind this tradition, Boyarin fails to note that here women are essentialized as more modest and prudish than men. 27. Some examples include: Judith Romney Wegner, Chattel or Person; the Status of Women in the Mishnah (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988); Baskin, Midrashic Women; Labovitz, Mar riage and Metaphor. 28.

Also, Rachel Elior's feminist analysis of the historical records of the phenomenon of spirit possession in Jewish communities in early modern Europe: Rachel Elior, Dybbuks and Jewish Women in Social History, Mysticism and Folklore (New York: Urim Publications, 2008). 212</page><page sequence="7">Misogyny Revisited formulation, lacks a rationale for the singularly deadly power accorded such neglect.30 However, the aggadic expansions of this mishnah stipulate a causal con nection between women's obligation to perform these three commandments and Eve's primordial sin. In many of these sources, their performance atones for the sin of Eve, who brought death into the world through her disobedience, by enabling Jewish women to be efficient vehicles of bringing life into the world. For, through their performance, individual Jewish women can prevent the punish ment imposed in Eve's curse from being visited upon themselves: "In pain you shall bring forth children" (Genesis 3:16).31 While the historical trajectory of development remains obscure, the performance of the three women's commandments and their ritual efficacy as protection from danger in childbirth eventually assumed a central place in European Jewish women's ritual practice and, we can safely assume, their subjective spiritual experience, judging from their prominent place in the litur gical corpus known as the Tehinos, popular collections of prayers in the 30. Chaya Halberstam, Law and Truth in Biblical and Rabbinic Literature (Bloomington, [N: Indiana University Press, 2010), 127-129, has recently viewed this tradition as a tannaitic expression of the problematic way in which divine justice works in the world, noting the lack of proportion between the sin and the punishment in its formulation: "[T]he mishnah essentially sentences the woman to death... [S]he has merely, out of inattention, created a situation in which she might lead someone to sin unknowingly. And while casualness regarding divine ritual prohibitions need not be tol erated, it is difficult to imagine that they call for capital punishment." Halberstam does not, however, recognize the mishnaic tradition's theodicean potential, perhaps because she did not consider its interpret ative trajectory in later sources. Hence, while the mishnaic tradition read alone can clearly be understood as punitive, Halberstam may have missed the point; neither the mishnah, nor its rabbinic formulators, have the power to "sentence women to death" or to impose extreme suffering during childbirth. It is simply, then as now, a fact of nature that women suffer disproportionately in relation to men in the process of biological reproduction. Perhaps, rather than being unambiguously punitive, the mishnah is drawing attention to an inherently unjust world and rationalizing it with a halakhic solution, a rationalization devel oped in more depth by the later aggadic sources. Baskin, Midrashic Women, 72-73, notes, but does not elaborate on, the theodicean problem inherent in this mishnah. See also: David Kraemer, Responses to Suffering in Classical Rabbinic Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995), 56. 31. The traditions of the three women's commandments assume a Jewish version of original sin; the guilt burden incurred by Eve's disobedience is inherited and must be expiated by subsequent gen erations of women to ensure successful biological reproduction. Further analysis of this gendered version of the doctrine of original sin is intriguing, but beyond the scope of this article. For more on the rabbinic sources illustrating this doctrine see Boyarin, Carnal Israel, 82-84. More recently, see Burt Visotzky, "Will and Grace: Aspects of Judaising in Pelagianism in Light of Rabbinic and Patristic Exegesis of Genesis," in The Exegetical Encounter between Jews and Christians in Late Antiquity, ed. Emmanouela Grypeou and Helen Spurling (Leiden: Brill, 2009), 43-62. Visotzky (56) cites ARN's Eve traditions to show the distinctiveness of the rabbinic view of primordial sin, considering it closer to the heretical Christian Pelagian, than the orthodox Augustinian, Christian doctrine. The ever present possi bility for repentance distinguishes rabbinic doctrine from the Augustinian. 32. The most important scholarly study of the Tehinos is Chava Weissler's monograph, Voices of the Matriarchs: Listening to the Prayers of Early Modern Jewish Women (Boston: Beacon Press, 1998). In an exemplary work of critical feminist historiography, Weissler situates the Tehinos in general, and their treatment of the three women's commandments in particular, in the historical context of the early modern period, comparing their manifestation in different traditional genres of religious literature in 213</page><page sequence="8">Natalie C. Polzer vernacular33 composed, in part, by34 and for the exclusive use of Jewish women. The Tehinos, which appeared and quickly proliferated in the late med ieval and early modern periods in Eastern and Western Europe,35 clearly evi dence the assimilation of the three women's commandments into women's normative ritual practice.36 Not only do the anthologies of Techinos include Eastern and Western Europe. Many collections of Tehinos have been edited, translated and published/ republished in the past 20 years. For study of the early Tehinos and musar literature see Edward Framm, My Dear Daughter: Rabbi Benjamin Slonik and the Education of Jewish Women in Sixteenth Century Poland (Cincinnati, OH: Hebrew Union College Press, 2007). Other studies and/or anthologies of Tehinos are aimed at a popular rather than an academic audience, often targeting distinct denomina tional audiences. Of the following selective list, only Devra Kay's anthology has a thorough scholarly introduction: Nina Beth Cardin, ed. and trans., Out of the Depths I Call to You: A Book of Prayers for the Married Jewish Woman (Northvale, NJ: Jason Aronson, 1992); Kay, Seyder Tkines; Tracy Klirs, ed. and trans., The Merit of Our Mothers: A Bilingual Anthology of Jewish Women's Prayers (Cincinnati, OH: Hebrew Union College Press, 1992); Norman Tamor, ed. and trans., A Book of Jewish Women's Prayers: Translations from the Yiddish (Northvale, NJ: Jason Aronson, 1995); Rivka Zakutinsky, ed. and trans., Techinas: A Voice From the Heart: As Only a Woman Can Pray (Brooklyn, NY: Aura Press, 1992). For a critical discussion of the recent interest in the Tehinos in North America, see Weiss ler, Voices of the Matriarchs, 149-171. 33. Most extant collections are in Yiddish; however, the 18th century Italian Tehinos published by Cardin, Out of the Depths, renders the prayers in Hebrew while the directions are in Italian, perhaps showing a higher rate of Hebrew literacy among Italian Jewish women at that time. 34. While some of the prayers in the Tehinos collections are vernacular translations of tra ditional Hebrew prayers corresponding to the prayers in the Siddur, many are original liturgical com positions, reflecting women's specific needs and life experiences. Whether they were authored by men or women is an unresolved question. In general, while some of these prayers were written by men, con sensus holds that some, if not most, of them, were written by women, whose names, in some cases, have been preserved. For a discussion of the issues involving gender and authorship, see Framm, My Dear Daughter, 66-69; Kay, Seyder Tkines, 10-11; Klirs, The Merit of Our Mothers, 3^1, 9; and, especially, Weissler, Voices of the Matriarchs, 9-10, 22, 24-28, 110-133. Weissler (127) directly challenges the view of older critical scholarship that none of the Tehinos were written by women, but were male-authored, maskilic fabrications. 35. Edward Framm, My Dear Daughter, vi, 66-68, succinctly and lucidly describes this process in his recent translation of Seder Mitzvot ha-Nashim, a 16,h century halakhic handbook of the three women's commandments, accompanied by a detailed and balanced historical overview of its printing and audience reception in early modern Poland and Italy. Describing the emergence of halakhic and liturgical literature aimed at a female, Jewish audience in the 16th and early 17th centuries, he remarks a shift in the attitude of Jewish authorities to women, in which education, rather than halakhic legislation, became the preferred way to teach women correct modes of Jewish observance. Framm acknowledges the limitations of his sources for reconstructing women's history in that almost all of the sources used for his study were written by men; indeed, he considers most, if not all, of the early Tehinos to have been written by men, lacking specifically female concerns (by contrast to the later Tehinos, which he feels unambiguously do so), although "...contemporary women seem to have embraced such prayers" as meaningful (Framm, 68, n. 158). Framm (69) implies a critique of Weissler's feminist historiographical approach when he says: "It may be expecting too much to find expressions of a women's personal ambitions in prayers written for women by men." 36. For general discussion of the three women's commandments in the Tehinos liturgy, see: Kay, Seyder Tkines, 22, 24; Klirs, Merit of Our Mothers, 6; Weissler, Voices of the Matriarchs, 6, 31-35, 99 35, 66-75. 214</page><page sequence="9">Misogyny Revisited special prayers of supplication to accompany their quotidian performance, but also they are organized in a distinct liturgical unit often designated by an offi cial title, "The Three Gates." 7 Moreover, the liturgical texts accompanying the three women's commandments, as well as those recommended for supplication during pregnancy and childbirth, often refer to the sin of Eve and the ritual means of preventing its bitter consequences.38 Certainly, the time gap is very great between the formulations of the traditions in Avot de-Rabbi Natan under discussion here and the appearance of the first manuscripts of Tehinos in the 15th century, let alone the heyday of their popularity in print in the 18th and 19th centuries. However, the Tehinos liturgy may well be viewed as a later stage in a trajectory of development of a living, women's tradition, into which, at some point, the aggadic traditions connecting the women's com mandments with the sin of Eve were assimilated into women's ritual practice and experienced as religiously meaningful by Jewish women themselves. 37.

In Weissler's example, The Tkhine of the Three Gates by Sarah the daughter of Mordechai, dating from the late 17th or early 18th century, the three women's com mandments are only one of the three gates; the other two gates are liturgy for the observance of Rosh Hodesh and Days of Awe. 38.

The precise connection between the per formance of the three women's commandments and Eve's sin and its consequences varies substantially, from general statements about the events in the Garden of Eden to a very explicit connection. An expli cit connection between the two, in which the performance of the commandments is a means of personal atonement for Eve's sin, is found in a Tehina for a pregnant woman about to give birth cited by Klirs (126): "May the merits of the three mitsves which You have commanded every woman to keep—nide, khale, and hadlokes nyeres—protect me, that I may not—kholile—be punished for khave's sin, and may I not—kholile—suffer any great pain." Weissler (73) also cites a passage from the Tsena-Urena, a scrip tural commentary in Yiddish aimed at a female audience first published in the seventeenth century, in which reference to Eve's sin and women's consequent death in childbed is recited in a charm to get pregnant, while eating the tip of the Etrog. Interestingly, here the liturgy explicitly dissociates the prac titioner from Eve's sin: "...And they pray to God to be protected from the sufferings of bearing the children they are carrying, that they may give birth easily. Had Eve not eaten from the Tree of Knowl edge, each woman would give birth as easily as a hen lays an egg, without pain. The woman should pray and should say, 'Lord of the world, because Eve ate of the apple, all of us women must suffer such great pangs as to die. Had I been there, I would not have derived any enjoyment (material benefit) from [it]. Just so, now I have not wanted to make the etrog [ritually] unfit during the whole seven days when it was used for a mitzvah. But now on Hoshanah Rabbah the commandment is no longer applicable....'" See also the recent popular discussion of this source in Morris M. Faierstein, "When Eve Ate the Etrog: A Passage from Tsena-Urena," Jewish Review of Books 1:3 (2010), 49. Sig nificantly for the study of gendered cultural production in pre-modern Europe, the Tehina which most closely reflects the aggadic traditions to be discussed in this article (attributed to a Yankev ben Elyohu, cited in Kay, Seyder Tkines, 234) was written by a man, who probably was aware of the literary tradition in ARN or in the Tanhuma: "God has said the same. The sin of Eve must be atoned. Therefore women go to the ritual bath, and light two candles or more, and separate the Khale dough; because women have precipitated death they must be punished and suffer hardship." For Weissler's ambiguous evaluation of the connection between Eve's sin and the Tehinos liturgy, see below, n. 40. 215</page><page sequence="10">Natalie C. Polzer From a contemporary feminist perspective it may be disturbing, to consider that Jewish women themselves valorized a ritual tradition we consider so obviously misogynist, indeed, possibly a Jewish version of "original sin," accord ing a special burden of guilt to Eve and by extension to all women after her.39 Perhaps Chava Weissler's ambiguous evaluation of the relationship between Eve's sin and the three women's commandments in the Tehinos is motivated by a discomfort with this valorization.40 Weissler claims such Tehinos take a theodi cean position, implying a divine injustice by "...rais[ing] the question of the relationship between women's present suffering and Eve's sin," yet accept "... the punishment with resignation."41 Yet again, part of our difficulty with these tra ditions may be due to our failure to consider them empathetically, with "imagina tive displacement," that is, placing ourselves in the cosmos42 in which actual women of the past lived their inner and outer lives. Clearly, this cosmos is alien to us, a cosmos in which women ritually experience what we consider patently misogynist traditions as not only rationally coherent, but as eminently reasonable and deeply spiritually meaningful. However, in this case there is a very real reason for the popularity of such ritual, a reason, it seems, it is difficult for us to acknowl edge. A persistent anxiety pervades the liturgy of the Tehinos, an anxiety not only over the certain physical pain, but also over the threat of impending death of women during pregnancy and childbirth.43 While scholarly consensus recognizes 39. Discomfort with these traditions may also be informed by a pervasive apologetic agenda of modern forms of normative Judaism to distinguish themselves from Christianity. One proud distinction is that Judaism neither holds a doctrine of original sin nor holds Adam and Eve, and by extension all humans after them, to be inherently sinful. For an example of this type of apology, see Ephraim Urbach, The Sages: Their Concepts and Beliefs, trans. Israel Abrahams, (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1987), 421-429. Urbach rejects any idea of original sin in early Judaism without offering an exhaustive treatment of the matter, as noted by Framm, Dear Daughter, 44, n. 33. For discussion of Eve's distinctively sinful nature and Christian doctrine of original sin, see Pamela Norris, Eve: a Bio graphy (New York: New York University Press, 1999), Ch. 6, esp. 190-194, and, John A. Phillips, Eve: the History of an Idea (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1984), Ch. 2, 3 and 6. For comparative discus sion, see Boyarin, Carnal Israel, Ch. 3, esp. 82-84, and more recently Visotzky, "Will and Grace." 40. Weissler's evaluation of their connection is unclear and self-contradicting. Comparing the Tehinos to strictly male authored musar literature, she maintains (Voice of the Matriarchs, 71), "I have yet to discover a tkhine that links that three women's mitzvot to Eve's sin." However, she immedi ately cites examples of Tehinos that do, in fact, evoke Eve's sin (72). 41. Again, an ambiguous evaluation, since she holds (Voice of the Matriarchs, 71) they "... accept their punishment." She notes that the theme of Eve's sin in the Tehinos is theodicean, by contrast to the musar literature, in which it is understood as purely punitive. Overall, claims Weissler (71), the Tehinos connect "...the observance of the three women's commandments... to fertility, rather than to penance." 42.1 am using the term "cosmos" to designate all of the factors making up an individual's sub jective life experience, both material, ideal and affective: her material and social environments, her world as imagined and as experienced emotionally and cognitively, and the obscure but nevertheless real interface between the two. 43. Amply demonstrated by Weissler, Voice of the Matriarchs, 46, 74 and all of Ch. 4. The Italian Tehinos are particularly anxious, meriting study in their particular cultural-historical context: Cardin, Out of the Depths, 54, 68—110. 216</page><page sequence="11">Misogyny Revisited this fact, it is often articulated with a positive turn, that is, the Tehinos are deemed to be about promoting fertility, rather than preventing death.44 Our difficulty with imaginative displacement in this particular case may have to do with the repression of a latent, primal fear that, for some of us, thankfully, is no longer so immediate. For, excluding us who live in 21 st-century developed countries and have access to adequate medical services, it is, and has been, an observable, brute fact of life that unlike human males, and unlike the females of most other animal species, the human female is especially prone to pain, suffering and death in the process of bio logical reproduction.45 Eve's curse in Genesis 3:16 is but a very ancient, parochial, theological rationalization of this basic biological fact.46 Given the unequivocal reality of women's pain and biological vulnerability, and historically speaking, their frequent debilitation and/or death during pregnancy and childbed, the aggadic traditions of Eve's sin and punishment can be seen not as misogynist ideo logical rationalizations of women's subjugation, but, like their eventual formu lations in the Tehinos, as evidence that for the rabbis the unequal burden of women in sexual reproduction was theologically problematic and required expla nation and/or rationalization 47 44. For instance, Weissler, Voice of the Matriarchs, 72. 45. Indeed, perhaps such a repression is evident even in the early rabbinic material. Considering the size and scope of the two Talmuds, perhaps it is significant how few times women dying or experi encing pain in childbed are mentioned. Discursively speaking, the rabbis are far more concerned with women as objects of sexual temptation, than with female mortality due to the divine imperative to be fruitful and multiply, for which women are used as vessels for the fulfillment of a specifically male com mandment. Talmudic sources which contrast the obligation to procreate for men and women include: B. Yevamot 65b, B. Gittin 43 b, Y. Megillah 1:4 70c, and Y. Yevamot 6:6 7b. In fact, to my knowledge, only one aggadic Talmudic tradition explicitly connects the pain and danger women suffer in childbed with . the exemption of women from the commandment to procreate, the story of the wife of R. Hiyya in B. Yevamot 65b. A theodicean rationale for women's exemption from the commandment to procreate is notably absent. That is, how could God command women to procreate if in doing so they risk their lives? Obviously, arguments from silence are critically invalid; however, I venture that a process of repression of the brute biological fact of women's biological vulnerability in the process of reproduction is taking place. Perhaps the fact that women are put in the position of enduring great pain and risking their lives to enable Jewish men to fulfill their exclusively male covenantal obligation strengthens this repression. At any rate, a comprehensive study of death and extreme suffering in childbed and infant mortality in rabbinic halakhah and aggadah is a much recommended project. 46. To my knowledge, no research has been done comparing the theological rationalizations for women's pain and death in childbirth in Genesis with other ancient Near Eastern mythologies, or world mythologies for that matter. Certainly, in Genesis women's unequal burden in sexual reproduction is a theological problem and needs justification, hence the severity of God's curse. Tikva Frymer-Kensky, In the Wake of the Goddesses: Women, Culture and the Biblical Transformation of Pagan Myth (New York: Free Press, 1992), 129, concurs, although she is particularly interested in women's social subordination within a biblical, patriarchal hierarchy. 47. Judith Baskin's discussion of the Eve traditions and the three women's commandments in ARNB and parallels (Midrashic Women, 74) recognizes their basic theodicean motivation, but ulti mately judges them to be irredeemably misogynistic, since "...we do not see a similar construction of male obligations as burdens or punishments." While I scarcely question the misogyny inherent in these traditions, their underlying stimulus is the vast disparity between the biological investment of men and women in the process of procreation, rather than a repressive legal or discursive problem 217</page><page sequence="12">Natalie C. Polzer The core text of both versions of ARN is considered the earliest commentary on the Mishnah tractate Pirke Avot (henceforward, M. Avot) albeit a shorter and earlier version than the one extant in our Mishnah.48 ARN evolved into two dis tinct versions, usually identified as ARNA and ARNB following Solomon Schechter's designation in his critical edition, which, with revisions and updates, is still the edition most commonly in use.49 ARNA and ARNB share a basic structure (a running commentary on M. Avot) and a substantial amount of parallel content; they are distinguished as two distinct versions, rather than two recensions of the same text, by virtue of distinctive redactional and textual devel opment, distinct manuscript traditions and unique contents and stylistic features. ARNA circulated more widely than ARNB through a long transmission process evidencing ARN's continuous popularity,50 and eventually became the "official" version of the text when it was printed as one of the so called "extra-canonical" tractates of the Bavli in the 16th century as a sort of gemara on M. Avot.51 Until the end of the last century, almost unanimous scholarly consensus con sidered ARN to have a Palestinian tannaitic core,52 viewing it primarily as a ped agogical text used to teach the values and hierarchical order of a community of rabbis and rabbis in training in the context of a tannaitic Palestinian rabbinic school.53 However, Menahem Kister's recent painstaking textual work has of rabbinic origin. The rabbis may be rationalizing this disparity in a misogynist cultural discursive and legal idiom, but the latter are hardly the cause of human female biological vulnerability during preg nancy and childbirth. 48.

Louis Finkelstein, Mavo' le-massekhtot 'avot ve- 'avot de-rabbi natan (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1950), 4-5, even assumed that the received versions of ARN pre served authentic pre-70 oral materials. Other scholars who stress ARN's tannaitic core include Lerner, "External Tractates," 376; Anthony Saldarini, Scholastic Rabbinism (Chico, CA: Scholars Press, 1982), 38-142; ARN, ed. Schechter, xxv-xxvi; Schofer, Making of a Sage, 7, 27-29 (with qualifications). Goldin, The Fathers, xxi, places the entire text no later than the early 5th century based upon the internal evidence. However, Jacob Neusner, The Development of a Legend: Studies on the Traditions Concern ing Yohanan ben Zakkai (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1970), 226, 274-275, recognized a later date for ARN's core more than forty years ago. 53. Following Schechter and the work of Judah Goldin, two of the three monographs devoted to the text over the past 30 years assume that the core of ARN is a more or less accurate picture of early rabbinic values and social relations within the context of a rabbinic school. Although their work is very different, both Saldarini (Scholastic Rabbinism) and Schofer (The Making of a Sage, 30-41) concur. Menahem Kister's 'Iyunim focuses on ARN's redaction history and does not deal with its original Sitz im Leben. For Goldin's view that ARN reflects the Sitz im Leben of a rabbinic school, see Judah Goldin, "A Philosophical Session in a Tannaite Academy," Studies in Ancient and Medieval History, Thought and Religion 21 (1965), 1-22 and "Several Sidelights of a Torah Education in 218</page><page sequence="13">Misogyny Revisited established that substantial portions of both versions are so late that the received versions of ARN cannot be considered amoraic, let alone tannaitic, and may even be geonic.54 Although Schechter's judgment that ARNB has undergone a shorter transmission process than ARNA still stands,55 Kister's work demonstrates that it is impossible to designate one version, or even one manuscript of a version, as representing a more original or more accurate text tradition. In Kister's view, since both versions exhibit uneven development, valid statements about its redac tion and transmission history are limited to its discrete parts, and nothing conclu sive can be said about either version of the text as a whole.56 If Kister's evaluation is correct, the attempt to fix any of ARN's traditions in a pre-medieval cultural historical context are fraught with uncertainty. Scholarly consensus, past and present, has considered ARN a singular rabbinic document;57 however, precisely what constitutes this singularity has never been satisfactorily clarified. In my opinion, part of its idiosyncrasy is an overall unevenness in the redactional artistry evident in both versions, no doubt a sign of the uneven textual development pro posed by Kister. The two versions of ARN contain parallel traditions of the three women's commandments, located in larger, roughly parallel units about Adam and Eve: their creation, life experience in Eden, act of disobedience and subsequent punish ment.58 While Fonrobert correctly identifies ARN's, especially ARNB's, framing Tannaite and Early Amorical Times," in Ex Orbe Religionum Part I— Studia Geo.

"The origins of ADRN apparently lie in the end of the tannaitic period, but its extant ver sions could hardly be dated before the end of the amoraic period (at the very earliest!).

Polzer of the practice of niddah as extreme compared with the parallels in other sources,59 she has misjudged the significance of its extremity. Indeed, ARNB's peculiar redactional structure positions the three women's commandments as positive illus trations of the M. Avot maxim of Shimon the Righteous: "The world stands on three things: on the Torah, on the Temple service and on acts of loving kindness" (Schechter, 18). Only ARNB presents the three women's commandments as gender-specific practices performed by women required for the perpetuation of "the world," complementary to the three commandments performed by men: Torah, Temple service and acts of loving kindness. Only here, in the light of rab binic beliefs about the prophylactic power of the performance of command ments,60 are women considered fully halakhically empowered to defy the consequences of the curse of Eve. Since rabbinic documents evidence women's religious experience and prac tice through a discursive filter written by men, feminist scholarship must be resour ceful and innovative. Elizabeth Shanks Alexander has recently called for methods, especially modes of literary analysis which can be used to stabilize "...the unruly, uncontainable quality of rabbinic literature.. .for interpretation."61 Three distinct modes of analysis will be used to stabilize hermeneutic frames for ARN's Eve tra ditions: (1) theoretical contextualization; (2) an ideological/theological frame, and (3) literary analysis, both of discrete traditions and of their position in the greater, commentary context. A theoretical frame informing the peculiar cognitive role of ritual in religious practice is critical here, since the aggadot rationalizing the guilt of Eve provide a ritual solution to the cognitive negotiation of the dispropor tionate nature of women's experience of suffering and mortality in the process of biological reproduction. The theoretical frame for my analysis is that of cultural anthropologist Clif ford Geertz, whose innovative cognitive theories of religious experience and ritual were popular from the 1970's-1990's,62 after which deconstructionist theoretical 59.

Examples include his classic "Deep Play: Notes on the Balinese Cockfight," in The Interpretation of Cultures: Selected Essays by Clifford Geertz (U.S.: Basic Books, 1973), 412^453, first published in 1972 and based on field work conducted in 1958, and his 220</page><page sequence="15">Misogyny Revisited frames became de rigueur across the Humanities and the Social Sciences. Even when not explicitly articulated, most recent studies of women's ritual practice in Judaism assume a deconstructionist stance, assuming ritual to be ..first and fore most, a strategy for the construction of certain types of power relationship effective within particular social organizations."63 Undeniably, the development of the cat egory of the three women's commandments and the rituals associated with them show how rabbinic male authorities have deployed ritual to exert control over women and to privilege the male rabbinic class. However, this fact in and of itself helps us understand neither the nuances of the traditions' trajectory of devel opment, nor the cognitive function of the religious practices associated with them. If religious experience has been, and still is, a coherent part of human cognitive, as well as social, experience, theoretical frames based in cultural anthropology remain useful. That Geertz's theoretical work has maintained critical relevance is shown in some of the scholarship cited in this article. As we shall see, Geertz maintains that the prime function of religious experience and ritual is the cognitive negotiation of two human realities: the ideal way in which life is imagined, and day-to-day life as actually lived. Chava Weissler's analysis of the religious function of the Tehinos implicitly assumes this theoretical frame. Says Weissler, "The voices one hears in the tkhines speak to a fundamental reality of the religious life..., [t]he disparity between day-to-day experience and spiritual ideals.... [T]he tkines are grounded in routine realities even as they exist in tension with them."64 More recently, Barry Wimpfheimer's study of the peculiarities of halakhic narrative in the Bavli expli citly adopts some of Geertz's modes of analysis.65 Geertz considers religious experience an inherently and uniquely human cog nitive process; its primary function is to mediate between the world of nature (i.e., that which is not organized, imagined and/or tangibly created by humans comparative analysis of Islamic structures of religious authority in Morocco and Java entitled Islam Observed: Religious Development in Morocco and Indonesia (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1968). 63. Catherine Bell, Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992), 197. Bell's thorough and sophisticated theorization and classification of religious ritual and its scholarly treatment is, perhaps, the best example of a deconstructionist theory of religious ritual focusing on its function as an instrument of the reification and negotiation of power relationships within social hierar chies. The basic power relationship assumed by the deconstructionist approach to ritual is how . .ritua lization empowers those who control or regulate ritual practices" (Bell, 211). See also Bell, Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997). Baskin's discussion of the three women's commandments (Midrashic Women, 70-87) and the Eve traditions assumes this theor etical frame. 64. Weissler, Voices of the Matriarchs, 34. While Weissler (66-75) assumes a deconstructionist theoretical frame, showing how authoritative male religious control of women was maintained and/or negotiated through the publication and dissemination of the Tehinos and musar literature composed for women, she also assumes that religious ritual has a specific cognitive function informing how the three women's commandments were religiously meaningful to the women who performed them. 65. Wimpfheimer, Narrating the Law, 16, 20 22, 85-86, 89, 92.

Polzer themselves) and the world of culture (i.e., all that which is organized, imagined and/ or tangibly created by humans). Religious behaviors "work," that is, appear mean ingful and reasonable to human cognition, because they effect the integration of human natural and cultural environments through the interplay between actual human experience and its subjective, cognitive processing. In effect, religion enables humans to experience their lives as actually lived as fully integrated with their lives as they imagine they should be, as they strive to make their cosmos a cognitively integrated, coherent system. Thus, according to Geertz, cosmological "...conceptions of a general order of existence" become clothed "...with such an aura of factuality that... [they] seem uniquely realistic."66 Religious practice is, thus, both a response to the real world, and a way of making the real world reflect imagined, culturally specific, conceptualizations of cosmological order.67 Geertz identifies three cognitive problems he considers basic to all religions, the first two of which are relevant here: the problem of suffering, the problem of moral order and the problem of knowledge.68 Human life as lived is always, to a greater or lesser extent, undeservedly painful and full of suffering when considered in light of projected cosmological systems of moral order. According to Geertz, religion provides cognitive, rather than material, solutions to this fact, by making "...physical pain, personal loss, worldly defeat, or the helpless contemplation of others' agony something bearable, supportable—something, as we say, suffer able."69 Religious ritual has a critical function in Geertz's phenomenology of reli gious experience; for cognitive solutions to the problems of suffering and moral uncertainty can only be experienced holistically by the believer as real and true through ritual performance. The only way religious truth can be rendered fully ver idical to the believer as a whole person, in mind and in body (i.e., life as imagined and life as lived), is when the cognitive solutions in the realm of the imagination are externalized and thus formally, if ephemerally, enacted by practitioners as part of the world of real life. In Geertz's words, ritual enactment, causes "...the world as lived and the world as imagined, [to become] fused under the agency of a single set of symbolic forms, [and thus] turn out to be the same world."70 66. Clifford Geertz, "Religion as a Cultural System," in Interpretation of Cultures, 87-125; 90, and subsequent elucidation. 67. In Geertz's famous, seemingly simplistic, theoretical statement ("Cultural System," 93), religion is both a "model of' and a "model for" human reality. Geertz's cognitive model for the function of ritual includes, but does not isolate, its social functions, such as the maintenance and negotiation of internal and external hierarchies, for social hierarchies must be experienced as a coherent part of cos mological order for them to be maintained in a religious society. If they are not experienced as such, they will be transformed unless imposed strongly by external force. The transformation of the status of women and gays in liberal forms of Christianity and Judaism in our day is a case in point. 68. The absence of any interest in the problem of knowledge in our traditions is remarkable since the disobedience of Eve involved eating from the tree of knowledge. Perhaps its absence is due to the fact that God's curses in Genesis 3 all relate to the physical and social state of human and serpentine realities, not with the issue of their access to knowledge. 69. Geertz, "Cultural System," 104. 70. Geertz, "Cultural System," 112. Indeed, for Geertz, religious experience, whether individual or social, cannot exist without ritual enactment: "...[W]hatever role divine intervention may or may not 222</page><page sequence="17">Misogyny Revisited Geertz's notion of the function of ritual is a useful frame for the traditions of the three women's commandments, since they offer a ritual solution to a specific problem involving suffering and moral order: women suffer pain and tend to die in the process of biological reproduction, while men do not. According to the rabbi nic traditions in ARN and parallels, this is because individual women bear the guilt for a sin they themselves did not actually commit;71 consequently, they are pun ished disproportionately in comparison to men. The three commandments, niddah, the dough offering, and kindling the Sabbath lights, become the ritual sol utions to this problem, simultaneously rationalizing Eve's sin and the immense guilt debt it generated in the "real world" (causing disproportionate suffering to women) as well as offering each individual Jewish woman the possibility of atone ment, and hence, safe childbirth, in the theological economy of the covenantal system.72 The rabbinic hierarchy of covenantal status informs the theological frame for my analysis. The vertical lines of hierarchical status in rabbinic covenantal theology are determined by the level of obligation to perform the commandments; the more one is obligated to perform, the higher one's status. Paradoxically, the more commandments one is obligated to perform, the more potential one has to sin; thus, there is a positive correlation between one's potential to sin and one's hierarchical status. By extension, the more one sins, the more opportunities one has to atone for one's sin, a commandment in its own right. Jewish women play in the creation of faith... it is, primarily at least, out of concrete acts of religious observance that religious conviction emerges on the human plane" (112-113). 71. But not all of the rabbinic traditions about the three women's commandments connect them with punishment or atonement. A long sugya in B. Shabbat 32a-b develops M. Shabbat 2:6 by stressing an alternative rationale for women's pain and death in childbed. Rather than connecting them with Eve's sin, the sugya understands them to be gender-specific modes of punishment for women, comp lementary to modes of punishment for men for sins specific to the life experience of each (such as chan ging diapers inappropriately on the Sabbath, in the case of women). Through a series of folk proverbs, a common sense, naturalistic explanation is given, assuming that punishment for gender-specific sins is likely to occur in gender-specific dangerous real life situations, for instance, childbirth for women and the dangers of the road for men. This sugya does not see theodicy as a problem, nor appear to be both ered by the fact that women, and not men, suffer and die to replenish the human species. See discussion in Fonrobert, Menstrual Purity, 32-35. 72. However, the rabbinic ritual solution to women's death in childbed is quite different from Geertz's model in one critical respect. One of Geertz's goals as a contemporary anthropologist is to make a clear theoretical distinction between religious solutions and scientific and/or medical solutions to real life problems. Hence, he holds that. .as a religious problem, the problem of suffering is, para doxically, not how to avoid suffering," but how to deal with it cognitively (Geertz, "Cultural System," 104). He thus is able to distinguish between the cultural function of religion and that of medical science, the primary goal of which is arguably practical, namely, preventing or curing human suffering, rather than rendering it cognitively coherent. Obviously, the pre-modem rabbinic world view of covenantal theology does not make this distinction. Arguably, pre-modern Jewish cosmologies consider the per formance of religious ritual, indeed the observance of all of the commandments, to have a practical, positive, even prophylactic, effect on the conditions of actual human life as lived, since divine punish ment is averted by enacting required rituals. 223</page><page sequence="18">Natalie C. Polzer have a liminal status in the rabbinic theological hierarchy since they are clearly fully Jewish theologically speaking, being included in the covenant,73 but argu ably, not fully Jewish halakhically speaking, due to their exemption from quoti dian, positive time-bound commandments.74 Certainly, women stand lower in the covenantal hierarchy than men since they are obligated to perform fewer com mandments, and by extension, have less potential to sin and, hence, fewer reasons to repent. Arguably, the Eve traditions, especially those in ARNB, raise women's hierarchical status in the covenant by increasing women's level of obligation (the guilt debt of the sin of Eve), potential to sin (by not performing the three com mandments meticulously) and the ability to atone for sin (through ritual performance). Finally, assuming that literary artistry can be manifest on the level of redac tion, the ARN traditions are evaluated in light of their position in their greater com mentary context. The redactors of the two versions of ARN adapted traditions of the creation and Eden experience of Adam and Eve from their original textual con texts and positioned them75to illustrate two M. Avot maxims having, in them selves, nothing whatsoever to do with the creation story: the maxim of the Men of the Great Assembly "Make a fence around the Torah" (ARNA:1/ARNB:1, ed. Schechter, 4-8) and that of Shimon the Righteous "The world stands on three things" (ARNA:4/ARNB:8-9, ed. Schechter, 21—25).76 While literary 73. Although some feminists would disagree, namely, Judith Plaskow, Standing Again at Sinai, 25-28, and throughout. In Plaskow's extreme view of the exclusion of women from the covenant, ritual reenactment of the giving of the Torah is, for women, a ritual reenactment of their exclusion (26). For an inclusive view, see Shaye Cohen's recent article surveying talmudic traditions about the paradoxical status of women within the covenant: Shaye J.D. Cohen, "Are Women in the Covenant?" in A Feminist Commentary on the Babylonian Talmud: Introduction and Studies, ed. Tal Ilan (Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2007), 25 42. Cohen concludes (42): "In the eyes of the sages Jewish women are included in the covenant of God with Israel, even if they are not exactly 'Israel,' and not exactly 'Us.'" 74. For recent work on women's exemption from positive time bound commandments, see Elizabeth Shanks Alexander, "From Whence the Phrase 'Timebound, Positive Commandments'?"

While a full tradition-historical analysis of the sources is recommended, it is beyond the scope and immediate goals of this paper. Such an analysis may allow us to place sections of ARNA and ARNB in a more firm cultural-historical context, as their treatment of themes concerning women and gender might be shown to correspond to Zoroastrian, early Islamic or medieval Christian milieux. The scriptural narrative has probably been adopted from exegetical midrashim such as Bereshit Rabbah; the tradition of the three women's commandments, from Bereshit Rabbah and the Yerushalmi, see n. 59 above. For a full list of sources see Schechter's notes and Saldarini, The Fathers, 76, n.10. For redaction historical remarks on the ARN material and its sources see the work of Menahem Kister 'Iyyunim, 82-83 (comments on the traditions in ARN:1), and his detailed article on ARN's traditions of the destruction of Jerusalem and the founding of Yavneh in Bi 'urim be- 'aggadot ha-hurban be-Avot de rabbi natan, Tarbiz 67 (1998), 483-529, in which he explores the redactional process of ARNA:4/ ARNB: 8-9. 224</page><page sequence="19">Misogyny Revisited interpretation is always subjective to some degree, concrete textual evidence sup ports the position that in this particular section of ARN, the redactional process has deployed the Adam and Eve traditions to explore a specific theme involving human suffering, namely, the human response to cataclysmic ruptures in human history, and in doing so, has enhanced the status of women and their special role in maintaining the continuity of Jewish and human life. The remarkable textual attention both versions of ARN pay to Eve must be contextualized in its overall treatment of women and gender relations. Since M. Avot pays women and gender issues scant attention, correspondingly, ARN exhi bits relatively little interest in either women or gender relations. Only two M. Avot sayings present teachings relevant to women and/or gender relations:77 "Don't talk to your wife any more than necessary" (attributed to Yosi ben Yohanan of Jerusalem, M. Avot 1.5); and the maxim, "The more wives the more witchcraft, the more maidservants, the more licentiousness" (attributed to Hillel, M. Avot 2.7).78 While the two versions of ARN show distinctive patterns in their incorporation of content concerning women and gender relations,79 neither pay them substantial attention.80 Such content as there is appears as an accessory to the moral pedagogy aimed at the male target audience, usually part of an incidental narrative background. ARN's lack of interest in women and gender relations is scarcely surprising when considered in light of its merely aggadic authority. The absence of any halakhic imperative to address real life situations, which would necessitate halakhic discussion and or mediation in issues concerning women and/or gender relations, allows both M. Avot and 77. I am excluding incidental mention of women in the enumerated lists, such as "No woman ever miscarried [in the Temple] due to the smell of the meat" (M. Avot 5.5). 78. Significantly, the latter maxim does not appear in ARNA (perhaps edited out), and while it is cited in ARNB:31 (ed. Schechter, 67), it has attracted no commentary, illustrating ARNA's tendency to omit materials concerning women and gender relations in the direct commentary, as described in n. 79 below. While the entire chapter of ARNB: 15 is devoted to "Don't talk to your wife more than necess ary," with three distinct units of commentary specifically involving women, the ARNA:7 parallel has a truncated version with only one unit of commentary. 79. While Schofer, The Making of a Sage, 37—38, notes different tendencies of the two versions regarding gender, reiterating Fonrobert's assertion that ARNB is especially misogynist, he does not execute a comparative study of the relevant materials. These distinctive patterns were presented in a paper delivered at the 2008 AJS Conference in Washington D. C. ("Patriarchal Stewardship: Women and Gender Relations in Avot de-Rabbi Natan Versions A and B"). While a detailed presentation of the data is impossible here, the following list summarizes provisional conclusions: (1) ARNA seems to have undergone a later editorial process, in which content concerning women and gender relations was suppressed from the sections of direct commentary on M. Avot, yet expanded in the many narra tives it assimilated in the process of transmission, both rabbinic exempla and folk tales; (2) ARNB con tains more content concerning women and gender relations in its direct commentary on M. Avot, both in the form of practical teaching about gender relations, as well as ideologically essentialist constructs; (3) there is far greater attention in ARNA to sexual anxiety and the dangers of sexual temptation. Common patterns discernible in both versions are:(1) a tendency to transform or suppress content con cerning women and gender relations when incorporating traditions found in other sources; and (2) an overall ideological framework of an all-male system of cultural (as opposed to biological) reproduction. 80. Also noted by Schofer, The Making of a Sage, 37. 225</page><page sequence="20">Natalie C. Polzer ARN (although to a lesser extent) to project an androcentric, ideologically intact "rabbinic community of the imagination,"81 a cosmos in which women are largely irrelevant except as accessories to appropriate male behavior in a hierarch ical social system built on discursive structures of rabbinic knowledge and the social process of its acquisition in an all-male rabbinic community.82 Signifi cantly, despite ARN's neglect of women and gender issues, Eve is not only the female personage given the most attention, but her textual presence rivals that of most key male figures; only Adam, Moses, Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai, Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus have more textual space devoted to them than to Eve. Thus, whatever function the Eve traditions fulfill for ARN's redactors, they must have been important. Apart from Eve, women intrude only occasionally into ARN's textual content as conventional, undistinguished, usually unnamed, stereotypical charac ters, most often lacking moral and/or narrative agency, whose presence facilitates ethical pedagogy aimed at males. Throughout, women (whether they are intended to be understood as real women or as metaphorical and/or theological constructs)83 are presented as vulnerable, sometimes (but rarely) as sexual distractions, and always in need of male protection and/or moral control. The male target audience is advised to be masters in their home by maintaining an appropriate moral climate therein, which necessitates treating the women for whom they are responsible as physically and morally vulnerable dependents, who should intrude on the activi ties of the male community as little as possible. I designate this construct of women and gender relations "patriarchal stewardship" (my phrase, appearing nowhere in the text). Given ARN's overall lack of focus on women and gender 81. For recent scholarship assuming "the world making power" of a rabbinic text, reading the Mishnah as a projection of an "imaginative narrative world," see Moshe Simon-Shoshan, "Between Philology and Foucault: New Syntheses in Contemporary Mishnah Studies," AJS Review 32:2 (2008): 251-262, especially 261. The notion that the Mishnah reflects an ideal rabbinic world, rather than an actual historical context, goes back to Jacob Neusner, for instance Ancient Israel after Catastrophe: the Religious World View of the Mishnah (Charlottesville, VA: University of Virginia Press, 1983). 82. Indeed, according to Schofer, ARN's main concern is the maintenance and perpetuation of appropriate social and interpersonal relations of men with men, within a community organized around the ritual practice and ideologies of Torah study. He locates this community in an imprecise, but actual, historical context in antiquity: "Sages prescribe intense relationships among those inside the commu nity: both horizontal relations among peers and vertical relations between students and their teachers. These relationships occur within a community that separates itself from a variety of others. This com bination of internal fellowship and external exclusion conditions the distinct piety and ethics articulated in Rabbi Nathan for a particular movement of male religious elites among a nation colonized by a larger empire" (The Making of a Sage, 40). He identifies these "male religious elites" as actual rabbis,. .men with expertise in a particular way of speaking and writing who gradually attained religious and judicial leadership of Jewish communities" (18). My reading of ARN as a projection of a rabbinic community of the imagination radically changes its social function and target audience. Communal, and even indi vidual, study of ARN would allow Jewish males who lacked the requirements of advanced rabbinic education to participate vicariously in this world. 83. Such as the women who represent the fall of the virgin Israel, i.e., the destruction of the Temple, in the three stories in ARNA: 17 (ed. Schechter, 65-66). 226</page><page sequence="21">Misogyny Revisited relations, the concept of patriarchal stewardship is usually implied, and is rarely articulated as part of the explicit teaching.84 The concept of patriarchal stewardship is, however, clearly illustrated in the two long sections of traditions about Adam and Eve in both versions of ARN. The first section is part of ARN's commentary on the first maxim in the Chain of Tra dition transmitted in the name of the Men of the Great Assembly, "Make a fence around the Torah" (ARNA:1/ARNB:1, ed. Schechter, 4-8). Long enough to be considered a multi-genre anthology, especially expanded in ARNB, the unit is comprised of scriptural narrative, scriptural commentary, parables, direct com mentary on M. Avot and enumeration lists, relating, in the haphazard manner usual in such anthologies of midrashic material, the story of Adam and Eve's cre ation, their Eden experience, their act of disobedience and its consequences. The second section comprises part of the commentary on the maxim of Shimon the Righteous: "The world stands on three things, on Torah, on Temple service and 84. A comparison of how the concept is manifest in the two versions would make an interesting study of the cultural production of the rabbinic representation of women and gender. Moreover, such a study might help place the two versions of ARN in a more firm cultural/historical context if their ten dencies reflect, for instance, early Muslim or Christian milieux. However, this project is beyond the scope and immediate goals of the present study. Here two examples must suffice: (1) In the direct com mentary on the M. Avot maxim of Yosi ben Yohanan of Jerusalem, "Don't talk with your wife any more than necessary" (ARNA:7/ARNB:15. ed. Schechter, 33-35), the male head of household is exhorted to be responsible for maintaining his own moral integrity, and that of his wife and his rabbinic community, by avoiding unnecessary conversation, primarily with his wife, and by extension, with other women. The ARNB parallel includes the wife as meriting special didactic attention (showing its tendency to include more practical instruction relating to women and gender relations than ARNA); its didactic message, however, is not about gender relations but about maintaining moral order between male peers, namely, study companions. The male head of household is urged to maintain a separation between the realm of the all-male house of study and the domestic realm, co-inhabited by males and females, through careful speech. By contrast, ARNA:7's condensed, single unit of commentary does not dictate controlling a wife's behavior in the domestic realm; it does, however indicate that a wife will suffer the social consequences of her husband's inappropriate behavior in the all-male house of study: "If a man came to the house of study and was not treated with honor or if he fell out with his companion...[He] disgraces himself, his wife and his companion" (ed. Schechter, 35). (2) In ARNB's direct commentary on the maxim of Yosef ben Yohanan of Jerusalem, "May the poor be members of your household" (ARNA:7/ARNB:14, ed. Schechter, 33-34), the mood and consequent behavior of a man's wife, here within the home rather than without, is shown to be critical to a hus band's ability to offer hospitality, and thus, to meet the maxim's ethical imperative. Here ARNA's com mentary displays no content whatsoever concerning women, consistent with that version's tendency to omit materials concerning women and gender relations from its direct commentary. However, ARNB not only requires the male head of household to create an appropriate mood of mild comportment within the home, but explicitly includes the wife, and indeed, the entire household down to the family dog, in the ethical imperative to exhibit mild mannered, receptive behavior. Despite explicit attention to the domestic sphere, an androcentric emphasis is maintained by the focus on hospitality shown to male guests. Arguably, ARNB reflects the concerns of a cultural context in which the religious life of men was not monastic, while social relationships between men were of prime religious significance and had to be negotiated with domestic responsibilities to be maintained appropriately, perhaps reflect ing an early Islamic cultural milieu. 227</page><page sequence="22">Natalie C. Polzer on acts of loving kindness" (ARNA:4/ARNB: 8—9, ed. Schechter, 21-25). Here, the Adam and Eve traditions are situated immediately after another multi-genre anthology describing the destruction of Jerusalem, the flight of Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai and the founding of Yavneh, which I designate the "Destruc tion Cluster," which is much longer in ARNB than in ARNA.85 Both versions of the anthology present Adam and Eve's experiences as archetypal models of and for human behavior, however, unsurprisingly, their qualities as paradigmatic, natural humans conform to stereotypical rabbinic ethical and cultural norms. Especially in the sections of scriptural narrative, Adam as the paradigmatic "patri archal steward," is responsible for the moral integrity of his household, namely, Eve.86 While Eve's actions are condemned, Adam is held to be ultimately accoun table for Eve's vulnerability to the serpent because he misled her by not transmit ting God's prohibition to her verbatim: "Adam did not wish to speak to Eve the way the Holy One, blessed be He, had spoken to him. Rather, this is what he said to her.... What led to Eve touching the tree? It was the hedge that Adam put around his words" (ARNA:1, ed. Schechter, 4); and: "Now from the words of Eve we learn that Adam hedged her in" (ARNB:1, ed. Schechter, 4).87 Two sophisticated parables follow in both versions to emphasize the force of Adam's ultimate responsibility for Eve's disobedience, both of which reiterate the concept of patriarchal stewardship in their narrative content.88 85. A comparative tradition-historical analysis of this anthology, taking into account the parallel sources, shows an especially complex redaction process. Clearly ARNA's Destruction Cluster has been shortened and substantially reorganized, to the point where its hermeneutical stance towards the maxim is very different from that of ARNB. See the comparative analysis of this material in my unpublished PhD thesis: Natalie C. Polzer, Interpreting the Fathers: A Literary-Structural Analysis of Parallel Nar ratives in Avot de Rabbi Natan, Versions A and B. PhD thesis, Cambridge University, 1991, 68-97. For a detailed technical discussion of the redaction and transmission history of the Destruction Cluster, see Kister, "Bi'urimFor historical studies of the anthology and parallels, see below n. 119. 86. Boyarin, Carnal Israel, 88, concurs about Adam's ultimate responsibility: "She got pun ished for her curiosity, but he alone is responsible for his malfeasance." 87. The "hedge" Adam puts around his words is a negative, rather than a positive, illustration of the maxim, since it led Eve to sin. Thus, "hedging" your words is not always a commendable thing to do. 88. Unlike the Eve traditions relating to the three women's commandments, the parables place the burden of the blame for Eve's sin upon Adam, rather than Eve. In the first parable (attributed to Rabbi Shimon ben Eleazar) a man marries a proselyte but fails to teach her the precepts of Judaism, thus rendering her prone to sin. The second parable (attributed to Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai in ARNA and to Rabbi in ARNB) is a well known rabbinic parallel to the Greek myth of Pandora's Box. Here a man deliberately tempts his wife to disobedience by an arbitrary commandment: "He said to her, 'Everything I have in my house is in your hands, except for this jar, which you must not touch at all" (ARNA:1, ed. Schechter, 6). See Boyarin's discussion, Carnal Israel, 80-88. For discus sion of the parallel Greek sources, see Saul Lieberman, Hellenism in Jewish Palestine (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1950), 136, n. 86. See also discussion in Saldarini, The Fathers, 36-37, n. 49 and n. 50. It has been suggested to me that the shift in blame from Eve to Adam may reflect early Islamic cultural influence; however the two parables appear to have a pre Islamic, Palestinian provenance according to scholarly consensus, thus the question must be examined in more depth than possible here. 228</page><page sequence="23">Misogyny Revisited Compared with ARNA, ARNB not only has much more material about Eve, including a substantial number of traditions not in ARNA,89 but also presents her as a significantly more proactive and morally independent character, and by cor relation, more responsible for the ultimate consequences of her sin. Eve's presence is diminished in ARNA's shorter unit, in which she is rendered a passive character with a non-speaking role.90 This pattern is illustrated in the two parables men tioned above. Although both versions of the parables illustrate the negative consequences of a "patriarchal steward's" inadequate or deficient instructions to his wife, ARNB's introductory formula designates the parable as being about Eve ("To what was Eve likened at that time?...") (ARNB:1, ed. Schechter, 7); by contrast, ARNA's introductory formula identifies the parable as being about Adam: "Let me compare with a parable, to what may Adam be likened?" (ARNA:1, ed. Schechter, 6). Moreover, the largely parallel sequence of scriptural narratives illustrating "the fence" that Adam put around his words (ARNA:1) further illustrates ARNA's tendency to diminish content concerning women and gender relations. Its much shorter version of Eve's seduction by the serpent presents her as a silent, passive character, engaging in internal dialogue, rather than speaking out: "What did Eve say in her heart? All of the things which my master commanded me from the outset are but lies" (ARNA:1, ed. 89. ARNB's greater attention to Eve is noted by Schofer (The Making of a Sage, 37), who inter prets its greater attention to women as evidence of its relatively greater misogynistic stance: "The most explicitly disparaging remarks about women appear in Rabbi Nathan B and not in Rabbi Nathan A." Illustrating its characteristic pattern, some of ARNB's independent traditions focus on practical aspects of gender behavior and relations, for instance the long list of characteristics distinguishing men and women, both cultural and biological, attributed to woman's creation from Adam's bone, presented as Scriptural commentary on Genesis 2:23, "bone of my bone": "Why does a woman adorn herself and man not adorn himself?... Why does a woman's voice travel and not a man's voice... Why does the man deposit something with the woman and not the woman deposit something with the man?" (ARNB:9, ed. Schechter, 24). This tradition and its parallel in Bereshit Rabbah 17 (Theodor and Albeck, Vol. I, 158-159) are discussed by Boyarin, Carnal Israel, 88-89. A possible early Islamic parallel is significant for further study that might attempt to place the two versions of ARN in a compatible cultural-historical context. While not precisely parallel, six ahadith reported in the name of the notoriously misogynist (at least, according to the Moroccan feminist Fatima Mernissi) companion of Muhammed, Abu Huraira, similarly connect essentialist aspects of a woman's moral nature to her being created out of Adam's bone. Here, this "fact" establishes the responsibility of the male to control female behavior, as well as to treat women kindly, typical directives of patriarchal stew ardship. For the ahadith, see M. M. Kahn, ed. and trans., Sahih Al-Bukhari (Lahore: Kazi Publications, 1971), 80, 81, 346, and: A. H. Siddiqui, ed. and trans., Sahih Muslim Vol. 2 (Lahore: Shaikh Muham mad Ashraf, 1972), 752-753, cited in Riffat Hassan, "Feminism in Islam," in Feminism and World Reli gions, eds. Arvind Sharma and Katherine K. Young (Albany, NY: SUNY Press, 1999), 255-256. For Abu Huraira's reputed misogyny, see Fatima Memissi, The Veil and the Male Elite: A Feminist Interpretation of Women's Rights in Islam, trans. Maiy Jo Lakeland (Cambridge, MA: Perseus Books, 1991), 70-73, 78-81. 90. While many of ARNB's Eve traditions have no parallel in ARN A, the reverse is true in only one instance. Eve appears in ARNA (but not in ARNB) as an item in a list of the events that occurred in the first 12 hours of Adam's life: "During the eighth hour he was coupled with Eve" (ARNA:1, ed. Schechter, 5). The ARNB parallel reads: "During the eighth hour he was commanded" (ARNB:42, Schechter, 116). 229</page><page sequence="24">Natalie C. Polzer Schechter, 4).91 By contrast, ARNB's Eve is a proactive, speaking character, who not only carries on a direct conversation with the serpent, but whose speaking role is singled out: "It is from the words of Eve herself that we learn about the fence with which the first human male encircled her" (ARNB:1, ed. Schechter, 4).92 Not only is Eve allotted more textual presence in ARNB, she is held to be more responsible for her actions; indeed, it is precisely these traditions which accord her more responsibility and liability for sin which have been regarded as evidence of ARNB's extremely misogynistic stance. The consequences of the sins of Adam, Eve and the serpent appear in six enumeration lists, two in ARNA and four in ARNB, although ARNA's two lists have been assimilated to the genre of scriptural narrative by placing them in the exegetical framework of Genesis 3:15 ("In pain you shall bring forth children"). The texts appear below, along with the parallels in Bereshit Rabbah and the Yerushalmi,93 in Hebrew and in English, followed by a comparative analysis:94 ARNA: 1 (Schechter 7) ms "?y nnatf mibi -in: "pa nnn 'a yitfsm mm 'i mn nas nwsn Vs naxatf -pnm -piaxy mix mm "itzpN "7Si D'n 'f?n axya ,-p sim (Genesis 3:15) ,-pmi -piaxy ms nam nsn nu;sntt&gt; lata nam nu?p nnoi n^nna nrm m ARNA: 1 (Schechter 4) mn rfftpra niV^p -itzro ny© nmsa nas nwsn bs -ibsie? linm -piaay nans nam "7si ana asm ■q b\nw sim iripwn (Genesis 3:15) nran Tiiff f?s ma nyx m rins m ,n,l?ina nys m nnsi nayn mx nr -prim ARNBA2 (Schechter 117) by rim niTn mit?y mn by mtoi...ms nmaa numn ma m nns n^yaa nsip:i mVntf n"3iz?n -r'a to np'iatf mti&gt;il?$n ©Tin na cftiw n^yaw myam s1?© n1? s^pa rrtf'ann ms bi ny mm ma rapta s^ntf n* Continued 91. A manuscript variant reads "in her mind" (nnsro) for "in her heart" ('212). In either case, Eve's articulation is presented as internal, not as conversational, discourse. See Becker, Synoptische Edition, 16-17. 92. In ARNB's scriptural narratives, Eve speaks openly thrice. She speaks to the serpent: "She said to him, 'We may eat fruit from all of the trees of the garden, but from the tree which is in the center of the garden we may not eat'" (ARNB:1, ed. Schechter, 5); and twice she voices rhetorical remarks to the world at large about her plight: . .After she had eaten the fruit of the tree she saw that she was as if uninjured and she said, 'All of the things that my master commanded me are but lies...;' " "...She saw the angel of death coming towards her. She said, 'I am like one who is departing from the world. Another woman may be created for Adam in my place. What should 1 do? I will make him eat the fruit with me'" (ARNB:1, ed. Schechter, 6). 93. Interestingly, the Yerushalmi version is assimilated to exegetical narrative and hence, is closer to ARNA; the Bereshit Rabbah tradition, which would be expected to have the generic features of exegetical narrative, does not and hence, is closer to ARNB. 94.1 have included the Bereshit Rabbah and the Yerushalmi parallels for the purposes of com parison.

Generically speaking, all six ARN traditions above are enumeration lists, although only three are explicitly introduced as such (the lists of the three decrees and ten curses in ARNA:1 and the list of the ten decrees in ARNB:42). ARNA:Ps list of Eve's ten curses, which itemizes only three, not ten, examples prompted by scriptural citations,95 appears to be a synthesis of the other two lists, exhibiting the exegetical structure of ARNA:l's list of the three decrees (as well as parallel content) and the numerical organizing principle of the list of ten decrees in ARNB:42, which does itemize ten examples. The exegesis in ARNA:l's list of ten curses reflects a normative rabbinic anthropology of female desire, specifically, its passive character, compared with a man's active sexual impulse.96All of the lists essentialize the consequences of Eve's sin, both biological (menstruation, childbearing, the breaking of the hymen, aging quickly, menopause) and cultural (sexual passivity, leading the funeral proces sion), thus Eve's punishments become a paradigmatic discursive model for 95. A discrepancy between the number organizing the list and the actual number of items it con tains is a not uncommon feature of the enumeration list genre. See Wayne Sibley Towner, The Rabbinic Enumeration of Scriptural Examples: A Study of a Rabbinic Pattern of Discourse with Special Refer ence to Mekhilta d'RabbiIshmael (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1973) and Saldarini, The Fathers, 219-220, n. 37. 96. As articulated by Rachel Biale, Women in Jewish Law: The Essential Texts, Their Literary History and Their Relevance for Today (New York: Schocken Books, 1995 [1984]) 125: "The curse on Eve may be understood as a symbolic formulation of the rabbis' view of female sexuality. Women were thought to have powerful sexual drives but to be temperamentally inhibited in initiating sex. Men do not share this inhibition and thus are commanded to initiate sex on their wives' behalf."

Unlike ARNA, which has assimilated its lists into an exegetical framework,99 ARNB's three lists retain a precise list form while exhibiting signs of redactional reworking.100 All three lists are obvious interpretive expansions of the mishnaic tradition of the three women's com mandments (M. Shabbat 2:6); indeed, the two shorter lists cite M. Shabbat 2:6 explicitly as a formal conclusion, thus presenting the preceding scriptural allu sions to the story of Eve as the basis for its production: "Due to this our Sages said..." (ARNB:42, Schechter, 117); "Based on this the Sages said..." (ARNB:9, Schechter, 25). These two shorter lists are virtually identical, with only slightly different readings. The second, more developed, tradition in ARNB:9 also cites the mishnaic source more or less verbatim in a formal introduc tory unit, however, with no explicit reference to its source. This tradition has been expanded to contain not only the introduction paraphrasing M. Shabbat 2:6, but also a clear tripartite structure, each part itemizing what the rabbinic view con sidered an essential difference between men and women and the relation of this difference to each of the three women's commandments. Moreover, idiosyncratic, parallel formulaic introductions and conclusions appear in each of its three parts.101 97. Weissler, Voices of the Matriarchs, 68-70, notes a similar "mythical" use of Eve as a uni versalized, archetypal model in the musar literature on the three women's commandments, a feature she deems absent in the actual Tehinos themselves, especially those authored by women. 98. A long unit of chapters devoted to enumeration lists of noteworthy phenomena, scriptural and otherwise, is comprised by ARNA:31-41 and ARNB:36^48. 99. Both of ARNA's lists (the three decrees against Eve; the ten curses with which Eve was cursed) have been formally assimilated into an exegetical context, namely, the anthology of scriptural narrative in ARNA:1 illustrating the fence that Adam made around his words. While they are formally organized as a list of three, each illustrating item is generated by the exegesis of Genesis 3:15, for example: '"I will greatly increase your pain in childbearing' (Genesis 3:15). When a woman experi ences the first blood flow of her menstrual period, she feels pain" (ARNA:1, ed. Schechter, 7). Here ARNA's redactional impulse was to create scriptural narrative, assimilating the list genre into exegetical commentary by adding narrative formulae such as "at that time" (ARNA:1, ed. Schechter, 4). 100. In fact, ARNB's traditions show features of two distinct list genres: lists enumerating scrip tural examples (all three), and lists distinguishing the differences between men and women (the longer, more developed list in ARNB:9 as well as the parallel in Bereshit Rabbah 17). For a recent discussion of the list genre illustrating the differences between men and women, see Alexander, "How Tefillin Became a Non-Timebound, Positive Commandment," 62. Alexander remarks that this genre usually "...includesfs] language which specifically asks 'what are the differences between a man and a woman?"' See Alexander, n. 4 for other examples of this genre. 101. Each part is introduced by a formulaic rhetorical question ("Why was the commandment of niddah given to women and not to men?"; "Why was the commandment of the dough offering given to women and not to men?....") and ends with a statement of the power of the performance of each com mandment to atone for Eve's sin ("The commandment of niddah was given to her in order that she atone for the blood she spilled."). 239</page><page sequence="34">Natalie C. Polzer Significantly, while the parallel tradition in Bereshit Rabbah 17 is very close to the longer, developed tradition in ARNB:9 as far as its content is concerned,102 it is not in the form of an enumeration list and it neither cites nor paraphrases the Mishnah.103 In her detailed comparison of the consequences of Eve's sin in midrashic sources specifically concerning menstruation, Charlotte Fonrobert locates the extreme misogyny of the ARNB traditions in what she regards as their especially punitive force: "Obviously, these preceding versions are highly problematic, not only as to their view of women's mythological role in the origin of human civiliza tion, but also as to their punitive framing of the rabbinic ritualization of menstrua tion."104 Judith Baskin also regards the ARN traditions, especially those in ARNB, as particularly misogynist compared with the parallels, illustrating . .the essential components of rabbinic Judaism's [negative] conception of women."105 True, these traditions reflect what we deem an essentialist, androcentric, if not misogy nistic and exclusionary stance towards women and their life experience. However, it is also true that the performance of the three women's commandments associated with the sin of Eve and its consequences was later assimilated into women's reli gious practice, hence, eventually experienced by women as ritually effective and spiritually meaningful. We could simply assume that, unlike ourselves, the gener ations of Jewish women informing their ritual practice with reference to the sins of Eve were colluding with their hegemonic oppression, but I think there is more to it than that. Indeed, while M. Shabbat 2:6 and some of the traditions expanding it can certainly be viewed as punitive,106 ARNB's version suggests that some rabbinic 102. Theodor and Albeck, Bereshit Rabbah 17, Vol. I, 158-160. Indeed, there are such close parallels between the sequence of traditions comprising ARNB:8-9 and this section of Bereshit Rabbah that it is reasonable to assume that the whole sequence of traditions was adapted from the latter and placed in ARNB as an entire unit. 103. Although assimilated into a narrative frame, the Bereshit Rabbah parallel belongs to the genre of lists itemizing essential differences between men and women (see n. 100 above); it is placed at the conclusion of a list of questions, here posed to Rabbi Joshua by his students, about what are understood as natural differences (many of which we would view as cultural) between men and women, each prefaced by "Why?". 104. Fonrobert, Menstrual Purity, 33. 105. Which include "...the belated and secondary nature of female creation and its negative results, ...women's inherent physical and moral disabilities, the divine punishments under which they labor, and the 'curses' that characterize their lot...." Baskin, '"She Extinguished the Light of the World,"' 277-278. Baskin (278, n. 2) is not aware of the recent scholarship on ARN's date, hence considers it a "formative Palestinian text" of early composition. 106. Halberstam, Law and Truth, 127-129, views the mishnaic tradition as purely punitive; see n. 30 above. Likewise, Jonathan Klawans, Impurity and Sin in Ancient Judaism (Oxford: Oxford Uni versity Press, 2000), 109, claims: "M Shabbat 2:6 threatens women who violate the menstrual impur ity, claiming that they could suffer death in childbirth." In my opinion, while the Mishnah may well be punitive, the aggadic traditions based upon it under discussion here are not necessarily so. It is nature that "unfairly sentences" women to suffering and death in childbed; the aggadic traditions, to different degrees, problematize this fact. However, while the Yerushalmi and the enumeration lists in ARNA present women's suffering and death in childbirth as difficult, they do not go so far as to consider 240</page><page sequence="35">Misogyny Revisited formulators considered the punitive nature of the Mishnah theologically proble matic.107 Moreover, some of the ARN traditions, most notably the "extreme" version in ARNB, have formulated the consequences of Eve's sin so as to enhance, not to diminish, women's halakhic status and ritual empowerment. This enhancement is achieved discursively by articulating the performance of the three women's commandments in explicit language of the covenantal economy of obligation, sin, punishment and atonement, and, in the case of the longer, more developed tradition in ARNB:9, by a hyperbolic exaggeration of Eve's culpability. Even a superficial comparison shows how very differently the consequences of Eve's sin are presented in the exegetical and enumeration lists (ARNA:1/ ARNB:42), compared with ARNB's three traditions enumerating the three women's commandments based upon M. Shabbat 2:6 (ARNB:9/ARNB:42). All of the former identify these consequences as generalized, stereotypical natural and/or cultural events in what the rabbis considered to be women's "natural" life experience, listed in a conventionalized chronological sequence of a woman's lifespan. While some may be deemed biological and some cultural, none of these life experiences are peculiarly Jewish; conventionally speaking, at any rate, they were probably assumed to befall all women living in a patriarchal society in antiquity.108 In keeping with their universal purview, here female biology is destiny; neither halakhic obligations nor ritual performances are pre sented as remedies for the consequences of Eve's sin. By contrast, ARNB's three traditions (as well as the parallels in Bereshit Rabbah' 17 and Y. Shabbat 2:6) identify only one natural consequence of Eve's sin, death in childbed; the three remedial consequences, the three women's commandments, are halakhic them a theodicean problem. Interestingly, some of the traditions in B. Shabbat 32a-b developing M. Shabbat 2:6 are misogynistic and punitive, without citing Eve's sin as a rationale! For instance, one view holds that women are punished with death in childbed for cleaning their babies' excrement (i.e. changing diapers!) on the Sabbath and for calling the Torah Ark by the wrong term. This shows that women's death in childbed can be rationalized in a misogynistic way in the rabbinic sources, without any theological or religious connection. See above n. 71. 107. Baskin, Midrashic Women, 72-73, notes the theodicean drive behind the ARN traditions, but focuses almost exclusively on their essentializing misogyny, rather than their theological function: "A closer look at these texts also makes clear that they belong to a larger body of rabbinic theological specu lation which attempts to demonstrate that divine justice is fully operative in the world..Weissler, Voices of the Matriarchs, 72, notes that the Tehinos referring to Eve's sin are always concerned with theodicy, ".. .troubled by the relationship between Eve's sin and later women's suffering." Rather than accepting death and suffering in childbed as a fact of destiny due to Eve's sin, the Tehinos present them as conse quences that can be avoided by halakhic observance and appropriate behavior ( Weissler, 73-75). 108. The lists read as follows: menstruation, pregnancy, breast feeding, her husband rules over her, her husband is jealous if she speaks to another man (she is restricted socially), she ages quickly, she experiences menopause, she stays at home and doesn't earn a living, she covers her head in public, and finally, if she is righteous her husband will bury her (the enumeration list in ARNB:42); menstruation, the breaking of the hymen, the pain of pregnancy, a woman's ugliness during pregnancy, the pain of childbirth, her inability to show desire for her husband openly, her passivity before her husband's sexual demands (the two exegetical traditions in ARNA:1). 241</page><page sequence="36">Natalie C. Polzer and ritual, thus specifically Jewish, rather than universal. Moreover, both Eve's actions and the halakhic ritual remedies, the three women's commandments, are situated in an explicit theological framework of sin and punishment with a middah ke-neged middah109 ("measure for measure") correspondence between the two.110 Hence, the two groups of traditions show a radical shift from a univer sal, natural, ideology in which biology is destiny, to a Jewish halakhic paradigm, in which destiny can be "trumped" through ritual means of atonement.1'1 A comparison between the traditions in Bereshit Rabbah, the Yerushalmi and ARNB shows the latter's enhancement of Eve's sin and, paradoxically, the corresponding enhancement of her covenantal status. In both of the fonner, Eve commits only one severe sin, bringing death into the world, expressed synecdochi cally as the murder of Adam; each of the three women's commandments is shown to be a consequence of this primordial murder through metaphoric or exegetical correspondence."2 While a theological rationale for the three commandments unique to women is assumed, there is little explicit language denoting the cove nantal framework of a system of sin and punishment beyond the word "command ment" itself. Moreover, the Bereshit Rabbah version makes no explicit mention of women's death in childbed, nor any connection between it and the performance of the three women's commandments. By contrast, all of the ARNB traditions, especially the long tradition in ARNB:9, place the three women's commandments in an explicit overarching theo logical framework of sin, punishment and covenantal obligation. Indeed, the obli gation of Jewish women is rendered explicitly by the verb "to incur an obligation" (nrrnm), repeated three times in each tradition. Moreover, each of ARNB's tra ditions makes an explicit middah ke-neged middah correspondence between Eve's sin and Jewish women's obligation to perfonn their three commandments as a factor causing/avoiding death in childbed. Significantly, the most extreme statement of Eve's guilt in ARNB:9 evidences the most, and the most explicit, 109. For a recent discussion of the law of retribution (talion), designated as middah ke-neged middah in rabbinic sources, in the context of biblical and rabbinic concepts of divine justice, see Hal berstam. Law and Truth, 123-131. 110. The fact that Eve is "judaized," represented, in a sense, as a primordial Jewish matriarch here is remarkable, but beyond the scope of this paper to explore. Adam, as well, is "judaized" in an exegetical list unique to ARNA which stipulates that he, along with other significant male biblical figures, was "born circumcised" (ARNA:2). 111. Visotzky, "Will and Grace," 56, points out that in normative rabbinic theology, the conse quences of the human propensity to sin can be averted through repentance and atonement, distinguish ing it from the Christian Augustinian formulation of original sin. 112. In Bereshit Rabbah, three distinct metaphors represent Eve's one sin, the murder of Adam: "spilling his blood," corresponding to the commandment of niddak, "spoiling the dough" (causing the body to putrefy), corresponding to the commandment of hallah\ and, "extinguishing the light of the soul," corresponding to the commandment of the Sabbath lights. This is noted by Saldarini, The Fathers, S3, n. 11. The version in the Yerushalmi is primarily exegetical, rather than metaphoric, citing verses to support the identification of Adam as "blood of the world" and the "pure dough of the world." Here Eve's act of murder is explicit and not metaphoric; "Eve caused him to die" is repeated three times after each of the women's commandments. 242</page><page sequence="37">Misogyny Revisited covenantal language. Here, not only is Eve explicitly identified as having incurred obligation, but the term "commandment" and "atonement" (iDOrr©) also appear three times, once in each of its three parts. Thus, a transgenerational narrative of the economy of covenantal salvation, highlighting proactive female agency, is fully developed in the ARNB:9 tradition alone. Arguably, ARNB:9's unique for mulation enhances, rather than diminishes, Jewish women's covenantal status, not only through the explicit covenantal language, but, paradoxically, through its extreme rendition of Eve's sins, and hence, Jewish women's liability. While the versions in Bereshit Rabbah and the Yerushalmi hold Eve guilty of only one sin, Adam's death, ARNB deems her guilty of three, which correspond to the three "cardinal sins" of Judaism, the worst sins a Jew could ever commit, the sins one must allow oneself to die for before committing: murder, sexual immor ality (gilui 'arayot) and idolatry."3 ARNB's unique formulation appears to have been motivated by a very precise application of the logic of middah ke-neged middah, which dictated that if, in fact, Jewish women were given three unique commandments to atone for Eve's sin, Eve must have committed three distinct sins. Each of the three women's commandments is identified, either explicitly or by extension, both as a consequence of, and a means of atonement for, one of the three rabbinic "cardinal" sins. The sin of murder is explicit in the text: "Adam was the blood of the Holy One, blessed be He. Eve came and spilled it/ him" (ARNB:9, Schechter, 25). The severe sin of sexual immorality is less expli cit, but clearly implied, as Eve is deemed to have contaminated Adam with men strual impurity (inxanm), one of the prohibitions of gilui 'arayot in Leviticus 18:19. Eve's third sin, extinguishing God's light in the world, does not correspond to idolatry in its strict sense. However, there is substantial evidence of a process of the ideological and halakhic conflation of the sins of idolatry and Hillul ha-Shem, the desecration or literal obliteration of God's name, beginning in the rabbinic period and fully developed in medieval sources."4 113. See: B. Sanhedrin 74a for an early formulation of this list, stipulating that, in contrast to the performance of other commandments which may be violated to save life, one should die rather than violate these three. Schofer, The Making of a Sage, 219, n. 1, lists other rabbinic sources and secondary literature. 114. For a discussion of the conflation of the sins of idolatry and hillul ha-shem in aggadic, homiletical rabbinic sources, see Urbach, The Sages, 355-57. An attributed saying in the Yerushalmi (Y. Nedarim 3:11 [37c]; Sussman, Talmud Yerushalmi, 1024) goes so far as to claim that desecration of God's name is a sin worse than idolatiy: "Idol worship is the most severe sin.. ..Said Rabbi Judah bar Pazi, Hillul ha-Shem is the most severe sin of them all...A study of the process of the assimilation of Hillul ha-Shem with the prohibition of idolatry in rabbinic and medieval aggadic and halakhic sources is recommended. For our purposes here, by the time of Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, a degree of assim ilation between the sins of idolatry and Hillul ha-Shem is evident. See Maimonides' discussion of the three cardinal sins and kiddushlhillul ha-Shem in Moses Maimonides, Mishneh Torah: The Book of Knowledge, ed. and trans. Moses Hyamson, new corrected edition (New York: Feldheim, 1981), Chapter V, 40a - 41b. Here Maimonides understands Hillul ha-Shem in three ways, all of which des ignate a process of obliterating the presence of God in the world: (1) Ch. 5 - Sections V. 1-5 (40a-40b) deal with denial of God's name in the circumstances when a Jew is forced to violate commandments, whether in public or in private, both under normal circumstances and in times of persecution; (2) Ch. 5 - 243</page><page sequence="38">Natalie C. Polzer The ARNB:9 tradition may well be an aggadic example of a step in this process of conflation. Here, a complicated metaphor designates Adam as the "light of God," rather than the more usual metaphoric understanding of "light" as a human soul.1'5 Adam's "light" here appears to represent the potential for divine revelation itself, for "the first man is the light of the world, with which the Holy One, blessed be He, used to illuminate all of creation." Eve's sin oblit erates this divine light, a sin immense, even cosmic, in its magnitude, for by mur dering Adam she stood to extinguish God's future potential to make His presence known to all created creatures, thus, in a sense, she threatened to obliterate God's presence itself from the world. Indeed, the metaphor is so extreme that it borders on blasphemy, certainly holding Eve guilty, if not of idolatry proper, of the viola tion of Hillul ha-Shem, desecration of God's name, which, as we have seen, became associated with idolatry.116 Undoubtedly, the extreme scope of Eve's sins in ARNB is both androcentric and misogynist, simultaneously condemning Eve and aggrandizing the male Adam as the sole repository of the divine light in the world; yet, with paradoxical logic, it enhances the power and status of Eve and Jewish women after her, for the greater Eve's sins, the greater agency each and every Jewish woman is imagined to have to atone for them, to the point of becoming active agents in restoring divine light to the world through light ing the Sabbath lights. The point is, whether or not the formulation of these ARNB traditions was motivated by an especially virulent misogynist impulse, their discursive energy is not directed at the social subjugation of women, as in the enumeration lists, but at the theodicean problem of women being punished disproportionately, hence at the fact of women being prone to death in childbed being at odds with the efficiency and justice of the divine imperative to procreate."7 The ARNB traditions show a Sections IX and XI (41a) define Hillul ha-Shem as inappropriate behavior outside the strict line of legal prohibition on the part of an individual known to be especially pious and learned, who "obliterates God from the world" by the bad public impression of Jews he creates; and (3) Ch. 6 - Section I (41 b) defines the term as the physical obliterating, or erasing, of God's written name. Regarding the latter Maimo nides makes explicit the overlap between the biblical prohibition of idolatry and the physical oblitera tion of a written name of God: "Whoever destroys any one of the holy and pure Names by which the Holy One, blessed be He, is called incurs according to scriptural enactment the punishment for idol worship, as it says, 'And you shall destroy their names from this place. But thus you shall not do to the Lord your God' (Deut. 12:3-4)." 115. As it clearly does in the Yerushalmi parallel, through the citation of Proverbs 27:2, "The light of God is the soul of man." 116. See above n. 114; also Saldarini, The Fathers, 83, n. 11. While Saldarini does not identify Eve as having committed the three most severe sins, he notes that ARNB:9 renders Eve's sin extreme in that she is pictured as having, in some way, killed God Himself by extinguishing His light. This is com municated by the ambiguity of the referent of the pronominal suffix "him" ("she shed his blood," "she extinguished him"). Saldarini notes that Eve could have murdered ("extinguished") God Himself, by killing the first person created in his image. 117. As Fonrobert observes, Menstrual Purity, 32. In fact, the connection between the biological fact of women's disproportionate suffering during reproduction and the fact that men, and not women, are halakhically obligated to procreate, needs further exploration. Indeed, a minority opinion in the 244</page><page sequence="39">Misogyny Revisited point in time (when and where remains highly uncertain) when three halakhically stipulated ritual actions, already being routinely performed by Jewish women, were categorized as a unit and located in the covenantal economy of sin and pun ishment in a discursive exploration of the problem of theodicy. Thus, the punitive energy behind the category of the three women's commandments in M. Shabbat 2:6 and perhaps the Yerushalmi is problematized. Certainly, the ARNB traditions highlight the extremely disproportionate tragedy of women being prone to suffer ing and death in the process of biological reproduction, in comparison with men, by assuming that only very severe sins could account for such an extreme punishment. Geertz's phenomenology of ritual practice is key here, namely, that through ritual practice, life as lived (women suffer and die in childbed) and life as imagined (God is a just God) are integrated as reasonable and coherent in the minds of prac titioners. For I believe it is reasonable to assume that not only were the three women's ritual practices performed by women as part of a regular domestic routine from the rabbinic period onwards, but, moreover they were witnessed, directly or indirectly, by the men and children of Jewish households. The daily (the taking of the dough offering), weekly (the kindling of Sabbath lights) and monthly (niddah) normative cycles of a Jewish woman's life in the domestic sphere are transformed into an ongoing, lifelong process of atonement to rectify the threat of death in another, less predictable, domestic routine, childbed. Living as most of my readers probably do, in a time and place in which childbirth has been pathologized and institutionalized, with the vast majority of births taking place in hospitals or ancillary locations, it is easy to forget that until the 20th century women gave birth at home, often within the earshot, if not the eyesight, of other family members. One might go so far as to say that the framing of childbirth by the three women's commandments ritualizes, hence elevates, the biological act of giving birth. Now that death or severe physical incapacity resulting from childbed is no longer a realistic expectation of every confinement (at least in the developed, affluent West), it is difficult to assess the relative misogyny of these traditions.118 name of Rabbi Yohanan ben Beroka holding women obligated to procreate on the basis of Genesis 1:28 is cited and rejected in M. Yevamot 6:6, B. Shabbat 11 la, B. Yevamot 65b, B. Gittin 43b, B. Kiddushin 35a, Y. Megillah 1:5.4 (70c) and Y. Yevamot 6:40.6 (7b). The narrative of the wife of Rabbi Hiyya, (B. Yevamot 65b-66a) who imbibes a sterilizing poison rather than suffer through a second pregnancy and childbed, connects the theme of women's pain and danger during childbirth with their exemption from the obligation to procreate, but does not explore the theo dicean theme. Generally speaking, the theodicean problem would be more severe if women were hala khically obligated to place themselves in physical danger in the process of procreation since this obligation is contrary to the spirit of the rabbinic understanding of "[you] ...shall live by them" (Levi ticus 18:5). For the latter, see, for instance, T. Shabbat 16:17, B. Yoma 85b, B. Sanhedrin 74a, B. Avodah Zarah 54a. 118. It was recently pointed out to me by a Chabad rabbi that Menachem Schneerson, the late Lubavitcher Rebbe, put great stress on the three women's commandments but with no connection what soever to Eve's sin or to avoiding death or pain in childbirth, focusing instead on what he held to be Jewish women's unique role in actualizing the messianic age (Rabbi Avrohom Litvin, oral 245</page><page sequence="40">Natalie C. Polzer A conventional feminist reading demands that, due to their connection with Eve's sin, the ritual performance of the three women's commandments must needs be a negative, diminishing experience, through which women internalize their destiny of perpetual guilt and probable death in childbed as valid and deserved. While some women may well have felt this way, the later evidence of the Tehinos shows otherwise, namely, that their performance was experienced by Jewish women as ritually empowering and theologically meaningful, in part due to their perceived prophylactic agency against death in childbed and related anxieties. Moving from an examination of the traditions themselves to their redacted context, the underlying poetics of ARNB:9's unique redactional structure reveals further enhancement of women's status due to the placement of the traditions at the very end of a long unit of commentary on the maxim of Shimon the Righteous: "The world stands on three things, on the Torah, on Temple service and on acts of loving kindness" (ARNB:5-9). The unit begins with the citation of the maxim, and ends with the two versions of the three women's commandments, which are placed in a parallel position with the maxim and which, thus, function structurally as a thematic resolution to the previous five chapters. An extended composite narrative (a multi-genre anthology of traditions forming a coherent nar rative sequence), these five chapters are divided into four distinct units, presented as commentary on the three parts of the maxim. "On the Torah" (ARNB:5) is fol lowed by a list of scriptural examples and exegetical traditions about the cause of the destruction of the First Temple. The commentary on "on Temple service" (ARNB:5-7) is largely made up of the Destruction Cluster, a composite rabbinic narrative telling the story of the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple."9 The commentary on the third part of the maxim, "on acts of loving kindness" (ARNB:8-9), is largely composed of the anthology of traditions communication, Louisville, KY, March 15, 2011). The transformation of the rationale for the perform ance of the three women's commandments in the 20th century after the medicalization of pregnancy and childbirth in developed countries would make an interesting study. Hypothetically speaking, once preg nancy and childbirth are annexed under the practical and discursive control of medical science, rather than theology, one would expect a corresponding discursive shift in their theological weight in male-authored, traditional religious discourse. 119. Kister, Bi'urim, presents a detailed analysis of the redaction and transmission history of these materials. There are many historical studies of the traditions in ARN's Destruction Cluster, since it is one of the main sources for the events of the destruction of the Second Temple, including the much discussed story of the flight of Yohanan ben Zakkai and the establishment of Yavneh. Among others, see Peter Schafer, "Die Fliicht Johanan ben Zakkais aus Jerusalem und die Grunding des 'Lehrhauses' in Jabne," in Aufsteig und Niedergang der Romischen Welt, Principat Religion 11.19.2, eds.

While parallels to the traditions making up ARN's Destruction Cluster appear in other sources,120 ARNB's is unique (even compared with its parallel in ARNA) in that, to my knowledge, it is the only sustained sequence of traditions describing the destruction of the Second Temple redacted in juxtaposition with a sustained sequence of traditions about the creation and sin of Adam and Eve.121 Reading ARN's redactional artistry as a poetics in which juxtaposition generates meaning, this arrangement is significant. Ironically, despite ARNB's graphic, pathetic detailed description of the destruction of the Temple, its Destruction Cluster is positioned as a positive illustration of how the world "stands" or endures, not of how the world was destroyed.122 ARNB's unique juxtaposition of the Destruction Cluster with the Adam and Eve anthology compares, and eventually proposes halakhic remedies for, two events of cataclysmic proportions, which effected ruptures in natural and/or historical order and which, hence, severely threatened the continuity of human and/ or Jewish life: the disobedience of Adam and Eve at the beginning of time and the destruction of the Second Temple at the hand of Titus. Complementary, gendered ritual solutions are proposed to remedy the threat of discontinuity posed by each of the two cataclysmic events. Placed at the very end of the unit, the ritual solution to the disobedience of Adam and Eve is the performance of the three women's com mandments, which ensure the perpetuation of both the Jewish people and the entire human species by preventing death in childbed. The ritual solution to the destruction of the Temple are commandments performed by men, the study of Torah and the practices categorized as "acts of loving kindness," presented immediately following the Destruction Cluster at the beginning of ARNB:8. The Destruction Cluster sections of both ARNA and ARNB stress ultimate Jewish continuity despite the threatening historical rupture caused by the 120. Two other rabbinic sources evidence sustained units of Destruction traditions, many of which are parallel to units in ARN: B. Gittin 56a-b; Midrash Eikhah Rabbati 1:5 (Vilna 1.31) ed. S. Buber (Tel Aviv: photocopy, n.d. [Vilna: Romm, 1899]), 65-66. 121. To my knowledge, the only otherplace evidencing a similar juxtaposition is in theAvodah service in the Musaf of Yom Kippur, where the juxtaposition is between the creation and sins of Adam and Eve and the Temple service. While the Avodah liturgy assumes the Temple to have been destroyed, the fact of its destruction is rarely explicitly articulated, and certainly not described in detail, as in ARN. See High Holiday Prayer Book: Yom Kippur, ed. and trans. Philip Birnbaum (New York: Hebrew Pub lishing Company, 1980), 528-546. 122. It is well beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the literary and thematic complexity of ARN's Destruction Cluster. A comparative analysis of the literary structure and hermeneutical strategies of its two versions is found in my unpublished PhD thesis. Interpreting the Fathers, Ch. 3, where it is argued (97) that the position of the Destruction Cluster as commentary on the maxim of Shimon the Right eous implies a conscious contrast between "the workings of history behind the veil of eternity" on the part of the redactional impulse. That is, although Shimon's saying is not directly challenged by the commentary, the marked ironic juxtaposition of the unchanging, eternal reality presented in the maxim, and the cata strophic flux of history, presented in the Destruction Cluster, problematizes the static world view presented in the maxim itself. Ultimately, as shown here, historical continuity triumphs over catastrophic disruption, yet "the world" is only able to endure through ritual flexibility. 247</page><page sequence="42">Natalie C. Polzer destruction of the Temple.123 The two ritual solutions to historical rupture to be performed by men, Torah study and acts of loving kindness, are presented as substitutes for Temple sacrifice, enabling the perpetuation of divine service in the Temple's absence, insofar as the ability to atone for sin is concerned.124 However, only ARNB presents an explicit structural correspondence between the three women's commandments and the study of Torah and acts of loving kindness, prompting their interpretation as parallel, gender-specific, ritual sol utions to situations of abrupt, catastrophic historical discontinuity. Their comp lementary equivalence is communicated through their redactional arrangement, the former positioned as conclusion to the Adam and Eve anthology, the latter positioned as a sort of coda to the Destruction Cluster proper,125 as well as through explicit linguistic parallels found in the list in ARNB:9 and in other parts of the commentary. Thus, ARNB but not ARNA elevates the status of the three women's commandments, making them analogous to men's perform ance of Torah study and acts of loving kindness in terms of their impact on the continuity of the world. Torah study and acts of loving kindness, the ritual substitutions for Temple sacrifice effective for atonement to be performed by men, appear immediately fol lowing the citation of the third part of the maxim "on acts of loving kindness" (ARNB:8). First, a section of scriptural commentary derives the maxim exegeti cally from the word "loving kindness" (70n) in Hosea 6:6: "For I desire loving kindness and not sacrifice." The substitution of Torah study and acts of loving kindness for Temple sacrifice posited in the scriptural commentary is reinforced through the rabbinic authority of Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai in a story that 123. A detailed comparison of the composition of the Destruction Cluster in the two versions of ARN would show a correlation with their different patterns in issues concerning women and gender relations. Similar to the way in which explicit commentary concerning women and gender is absent in ARNA (see above n. 79), the anxious, urgent tone of ARNB's Destruction Cluster is absent in ARNA's much shorter redactional arrangement. ARNB's version is not only much longer, with additional narrative detail (such as the story of Titus' punishment for destroying the Temple by means of a mosquito consuming his brain from within, in ARNB:7), but also preserves a chronological narrative sequence, with the solution to the problem of the destruction of the Temple situated after the destruction and its consequences; by contrast, ARNA does not arrange its traditions chronologically. See below n. 125. The rhetorical result of these redactional differences is that ARNA's version engen ders much less suspense and theological difficulty than ARNB's. See Polzer, Interpreting the Fathers, Ch. 3. 124. While this source is often read as showing the rabbis felt that sacrifice was superseded by other commandments such as prayer, Jonathan Klawans has recently challenged this assumption: "... [T]hese sources do not unquestionably claim that sacrifice has been superseded.. ..[This].. .can be seen first and foremost by context... [in] Avot de Rabbi Natan..." Jonathan Klawans, Purity, Sacrifice, and the Temple: Symbolism and Supercessionism in the Study of Ancient Judaism (Oxford: Oxford Univer sity Press, 2006), 209. 125. The traditions are situated in different positions in the two versions. ARNA proposes the two ritual solutions at the very beginning of the unit, in its commentary on the first part of Shimon's saying, "on the Torah," before its version of the Destruction Cluster, while ARNB positions the tra dition after the Destruction Cluster, following the chronological sequence of the event it describes in the commentary on the third part of the saying, "on acts of loving kindness." 248</page><page sequence="43">Misogyny Revisited follows.

Thus, ritualized involvement in the social world of human joy and sorrow is made an ethical imperative for Jewish men (as in ILa, II.b and III.a above).130 The function of ARNB's anthology of Adam and Eve traditions, follow ing hard after the story of Yohanan ben Zakkai (I.b above), is not immediately obvious; indeed, it is usually viewed as an irrelevant, lengthy interpolation.131 126.

This affective participation in someone else's performance of a social commandment is presented as a mode of imitation of God, as seen in the tradition attributed to Rabbi Shimon Menasia, where God's role in the marriage of Adam and Eve is the model for performing similar acts of loving kindness (Ill.a above). 131. Scholarly consensus assumes the long series of Adam and Eve traditions in ARNB:8-9 to be mostly irrelevant to their commentary context, inserted as a whole from another source, probably Bereshit Rabbah. See Saldarini, The Fathers, 76, n. 9; Kister, 'Iyyiinim, 82-83. 250</page><page sequence="45">Misogyny Revisited However, the Adam and Eve materials are not superfluous if considered in light of the theme of the role of ritual in effecting human continuity and thereby mending catastrophic rupture. A thematic correspondence is effected between the repair of the rupture caused by the destruction of the Temple and that caused by the disobedience of Adam and Eve by their structural jux taposition, and also by explicit language shared by the story of Yohanan ben Zakkai and the tradition of the three women's commandments at the end of ARNB:9 (Ill.i and j above). To facilitate illustration, the story is cited in full below: A story is told about Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai who was walking along the road when Rabbi Joshua ran after him and said to him, "Woe unto us, for the house of our life has been destroyed, the place in which we used to atone for our sins!" He said to him, "Do not fear. We have another means of atonement to take its place." He asked, "What is it?" Yohanan answered, "For I desire loving kindness and not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6). Bearing in mind that the only version of the tradition of the three women's com mandments with explicit language of atonement (repeated three times) is the longer list at the end of ARNB:9, it is significant that explicit language of atone ment also appears in the story of Yohanan ben Zakkai (~iDDQ\n~inx msD), situated in the coda to the Destruction Cluster. This repetition of the language of atonement effects a correspondence between the two traditions, drawing attention to the two complementary, gender specific, modes of ritual atonement prescribed in each. Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai assures Rabbi Joshua that Torah study and acts of loving kindness substitute for the atoning efficacy of sacrifice, ensuring the per petuation of the covenantal relationship between God and Israel; by correlation, women's performance of their three commandments becomes a kind of expiatory "sacrifice," warding off death in childbed and thus perpetuating the Jewish people through biological reproduction.132 Further evidence of the complementary role ARNB posits for women in Jewish continuity is suggested by Rabbi Joshua's most unusual designation for the Temple, suggesting a homology between it and the female reproductive body. Instead of ARN's usual term, "the house of the sanctuary," normatively translated "the Temple" (uftpan rrn), Rabbi Joshua uses the unusual designation "the house of our life" (HPT! rrn).133 Metaphorically resonant, "the house of our life" bears a range of associations, denoting the center, the matrix, not only the 132. Fonrobert, Menstrual Purity, 229, n. 40, notes the expiatory, as opposed to the punitive, function of the three women's commandments assumed by the ARNB tradition. The identification of menstruation as a kind of an expiatory blood sacrifice is very provocative, both theoretically and theologically speaking, but its ramifications cannot be pursued here. 133. Appearing, to my knowledge, only seven times in rabbinic literature, according to a search on the Bar Ilan database. Three of the seven attestations of the term are connected with the prac tice of niddah.

Polzer critical place of Temple service to the continuity of the Jewish people and their covenantal relationship with God, but also the "center" of the female body, the source of human life. Recent feminist studies of the rabbinic discursive articulation of the female body have explored the multi-layered, interwoven historical and halakhic nuances of the metaphor "woman as house."134 Indeed, the word "house" in rabbinic usage may designate both woman and/or wife, as well as the female genitalia.135 More over, according to this scholarship, the rabbinic discursive field implicated in the "woman as house" metaphor designates the specifically female reproductive capacity.136 ARNB's unique trope of woman/Temple as the "house of life" has a scriptural resonance with female biological reproduction, for "our life" ("irTl) and the name "Eve" (mn) share the same root, reflected in the etiological verse: "And Adam called the woman Eve, for she was the mother of all life" (Genesis 3:20). The unusual designation for the Temple, along with the parallel positions of the story of Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai and the tradition of the three women's commandments (both placed at the very end of their respective anthol ogical units) effects a homological correspondence between Eve (and by exten sion, Jewish women after her) and the Temple. The female womb and the altar are thus, in very different ways, analogized as sites of mediation and divine atone ment. The logical progression of this homology creates a further correspondence between the destruction of the Temple and the death of women in childbed,137 134. Most notably.

Bodies, Houses, and Rabbis in Ancient Galiliee," Ch. 2 in Rebuilding the House of Israel, 34-76; Fonrobert, "The Woman as House," Ch. 2 in Menstrual Purity, 40-6; and, more recently, Labovitz, "My Wife I Called 'My House': Elaborating the Metaphor of Women as Property," Ch. 3 in Marriage and Metaphor, 97-146. 135.

Fonrobert, Menstrual Purity, 48-60, documents the conventional representation of female reproductive organs in rabbinic sources as the architectural plan of a house, with vestibule, hallway and inner room. Significantly, Baker, Rebuilding the House, 56, 59-60, notes that the house metaphor is never used in rabbinic sources to designate the virginal female body, but, rather, designates the wife's reproductive capacity under her husband's control. Labovitz, Marriage and Metaphor, 99, 116—117, also notes the intrinsic connection between the metaphoric representation of "woman as house" and her reproductive capacities, halakhically acquired by purchase and controlled by her husband. 137. While an association between a Jewish women's performance of the three women's com mandments and the High Priest's ritual functions in the Temple is a trope familiar in the Tehinos, ARNB's association between the Temple and the female reproductive body is unique. For the former, see Weissler, Voices of the Matriarchs, 60—61. A few traditional sources do stipulate a parallel between the death of a wife and the destruction of the Temple. For instance, a baraita in B. Sanhedrin 22a hyperbolically likens the death of a man's first wife to the destruction of the Temple, in terms of the sorrow experienced by the bereaved husband. Citing this source in his early 17th-century commentary, Kli Yakar, Ephraim of Lundshitz interprets Abraham's unusual mode of mourning Sarah's death in Genesis 23:2, as indicating his observance of ritualized mourning for the Temple (Sefer Kli Yakar ha-Shalem [Jerusalem: Orot Hayyim, 1961), Vol. I, 101. Neither source specifically concerns the death of a wife in childbed. 252</page><page sequence="47">Misogyny Revisited highlighting women's critical place in the continuity of Jewish life and tradition.138 This unusual homological correspondence between Eve and the Temple is supported by more textual evidence, namely, the repetition of the term "in its place" or "in its stead" (rrnnn), which refers both to Temple worship in the story of Yohanan ben Zakkai (I.b) and to the creation of Eve (in scripture itself, as well as in the two parables in the Adam and Eve anthology - III.e,f). In the former, Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai uses the term to inform Rabbi Joshua that acts of loving kindness are a substitution for the atoning power of sacrifice thus: "...we have another means of atonement in its place (rrnnn)." The biblical account of Eve's creation also employs the term: "He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place (mnnn)" (Genesis 2:21). Echoing scripture, the same term appears in ARNB:9 in a pair of polemical parables illustrating the cre ation of Eve: "The king got up at night, removed a brick of clay and put in its place (rrnnn) a brick of gold;" "He said to the butcher, 'Take this bone and give me some meat in its place (rnnn).... Thus did the Holy One blessed be He with the first man. He took a bone from him and gave him flesh in its place (rnnn)" (ARNB:9, Schechter, 23-24). The parables reveal the substituted gold brick and the meat to be far superior to the inferior clay brick and bone; correspondingly Eve, and all women after her, are a superior substitution for a man's rib, and further, acts of loving kindness (and by implication Torah study) are a superior substitution for Temple sacrifice. Pushing the logical trajectory of the Temple/ Eve homology just a bit further, Eve's female Jewish descendants can be under stood to be a superior substitution for Eve herself, since unlike her, they are able to avoid the consequences of her sin by atoning through the performance of the three covenantal commandments peculiar to them.139 My premise that a redactional impulse in this portion of ARNB enhances, rather than diminishes, the status of Jewish women by homologizing their role in Jewish continuity to that of the Temple itself, has been supported by the textual evidence. ARNB's Destruction Cluster and anthology of Adam and Eve traditions are juxtaposed in such a way as to propose two sets of gender-specific, 138. Typical of its overall pattern regarding reference to issues concerning women, ARNA's parallel unit evidences no homology between the Temple and Eve. First, its version of the story of Rabbi Yohanan calls the Temple by its usual designation, ttnpan rra. Second, none of the long string of traditions about Adam and Eve in ARNB:8-9 appear in ARNA; hence, there is no juxtaposition of the destruction of the Temple with the consequences of Eve's sin. Notably, the more androcentric ARNA:1 contains a tradition in which the Temple is homologized to Adam, rather than to Eve, in line with ARNA's general tendency to diminish textual references to women: "Another interpretation of 'And you have placed your hand upon me' (Psalms 139:5): When he [Adam] sinned, the Holy One, blessed be He, removed one [of the two faces he was originally created with]. From this we learn that both Adam and the Temple (ttapan rra) were created with God's own two hands..." (ARNA:1, ed. Schechter, 8). 139. Visotzky, "Will and Grace," 56, notes that according to the typical rabbinic view the poten tial for atonement renders Jews superior to Adam and Eve, who had no process of atonement in place. For an example of an early modern Tehina in which women felt themselves at a moral advantage over Eve, see Weissler, Voices of the Matriarchs, 73, 179-180. 253</page><page sequence="48">Natalie C. Polzer ritual solutions to theodicean problems of human life as lived, both historical and cosmic, which threaten rupture in the continuity of Jewish life.140 Certainly, the complementary ritual solutions accorded to men and to women embody essentia lizing, binary conceptions of gender positioned along the nature/culture axis, so that while the designated men's commandments are specifically cultural, the women's commandments, cultural activities in and of themselves, are related to biological reproduction. However, ARNB clearly considers both Jewish men and women necessary in the perpetuation of the "Jewish species," (to concoct a Levi-Straussian term synthesizing nature and culture). Men must study Torah and participate in acts of loving kindness, many of which force them to be active, empathetic witnesses to the normative human life cycle; women must perform the three women's commandments, niddah, the dough offering and kind ling the Sabbath lights, hence ensuring effective biological reproduction.14' It is noteworthy, although beyond immediate discussion here, that the Jewish male role in biological reproduction is not identified as required for the continuity of Jewish survival. This may be due to the fact that Jewish male reproduction is a halakhic obligation, while women's biological role in childbearing is not so,142 perhaps identifying the latter as a supreme example of "acts of loving kindness" beyond the strict line of the law on the part of Jewish women. While women clearly are essentialized as more essentially natural agents in the perpetuation of Jewish continuity, ARNB's traditions accord Jewish women agency, in the form of both halakhic responsibility and spiritual empowerment, thus placing their performance of the three women's commandments in a critical place in the cosmic scheme of things. This position is certainly essentialist, highly binary and gendered, but, I think, hardly expresses extreme misogyny. Let us reconsider the maxim of Shimon the Righteous: "The world stands on three things: on the Torah, on Temple service and on acts of loving kindness." While the M. Avot maxim lists three commandments primarily directed at men, 140.1 am assuming that the redactor of this section of ARNB lived well after the destruction of the Temple. The historical event of the destruction of the Temple, as well as its perceived threat to con tinuity, is being imaginatively reconstructed and imaginatively defused, through the valorization of acts of loving kindness and Torah study, which are transformed into a ritual solution to the absence of the Temple cult. 141. For recent work on women's contribution to salvation through the process of biological reproduction in the Bavli, see Dorothea M. Salzer, "Women's World in Massekhet Rosh ha-Shannah: Women and Creation in bRosh ha-Shanah 10b—1 lb," in A Feminist Commentary on the Babylonian Talmud, 197-215. Salzer (213) bases her conclusions on a careful literary analysis of the content and structure of a long unit of associated traditions: "According to our sugya, pregnancy and mother hood are part of the ongoing process of creation.... This is clearly recognizable in the structuring of the text linking the topic of creation to the topics of conception and birth. Because of the formal pattern of our sugya, conception and birth are both parts of salvation." However, Gwynn Kessler's recent study of the discursive representation of the fetus in rabbinic homiletical texts shows a different pattern; in the texts she examines, women disappear as active, significant agents in human reproduction. God Himself is the only active agent in the development of the fetus.

Thus, reading creatively, but I think not perversely, ARNB accords Jewish women a critical place in the perpetuation of the cultural world of Jewish men, according them covenantal status, halakhic responsibility and ritual power, certainly more so than M. Avot or ARNA. Indeed, ARNB's formulation of these traditions may be viewed as an implicit critique of the much more androcentric M. Avot and its static world view,143 which lacks virtually any reference to women and/ or gender relations. While my reading of ARNB's Eve traditions still excludes women from a place in cultural reproduction of Torah study, it deems them central to its continuity. Natalie C.
