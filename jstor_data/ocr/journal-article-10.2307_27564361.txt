Jassen It has long been axiomatic in the study of postbiblical Judaism that prophecy had become a dormant institution. For scholars studying Judaism in its many ancient manifestations, prophecy was a phenomenon closely related to the heritage of biblical Israel. It disappeared as biblical Israel gave way to Judaism in the after math of the Babylonian exile.2 This scholarly assumption has found support in several texts from ancient Judaism that indeed espouse such a position. In recent years, the dominance of this consensus has begun to wither away as schol ars have become both more fully aware of the diverse forms of Judaism in the Second Temple and rabbinic periods and more sensitive to the multiple modes of religious piety in ancient Judaism. In this article, I would like to extend the contours of this conversation by mapping out some methodological rubrics for the study of prophecy in ancient Judaism and discuss one context for the appli cation of this methodology?the Qumran community. I. Prophecy After "The Prophets" Defining prophecy We must, of course, begin this discussion by generating a working definition of the term "prophecy" and distinguishing between the way in which the term is 1. This article is based on some of the methods employed and conclusions reached in Alex P. Jassen, Mediating the Divine: Prophecy and Revelation in the Dead Sea Scrolls and Second Temple Judaism (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 2007). Thank you to the publisher for permission to reprint some overlap ping content. Earlier versions of portions of this article were presented at the 2005 and 2006 annual meetings of the Association for Jewish Studies. Thank you to all those in attendance for their helpful feedback. All Hebrew Bible translations follow NJPS unless otherwise noted. 2. See, for example, the entry by Shalom Paul, S. David Sperling, Louis Rabinowitz, Ralph Lerner, Howard Kreisel, and Walter W?rzburger, "Prophets and Prophecy," in the Encyclopaedia Judaica, 2nd ed., ed. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik (Detroit: Macmillan Reference, 2007), 16:566-86. The section on ancient prophecy surveys many of the common issues addressed in standard discussions of prophecy in the Hebrew Bible and ancient Israel. The following section treats prophecy in the Talmud. Here, the brief discussion focuses on the rabbinic view of Moses' prophetic status and the rabbinic rejection of prophetic legal innovation. Absent from either of these treatments is any dis cussion of ongoing prophetic activity in ancient Judaism or the reception and conceptualization of prophecy in Second Temple and rabbinic literature. 299</page><page sequence="2">Alex R Jassen employed in biblical and postbiblical contexts. The phenomenon that we generally identify as prophecy has recently been defined as the "transmission of allegedly divine messages by a human intermediary to a third party."3 I cite this definition because it accurately identifies several critical elements of the prophetic experi ence. Prophecy is marked by an individual's claim to be the recipient of divine rev elation and thus privy to a divine message.4 Prophecy, however, is not a solitary human-divine interaction. Rather, what distinguishes a prophet from any other alleged recipient of divine revelation is his or her status as a spokesperson to a larger body of people.5 Thus, the prophet is expected to share the divine message with a larger audience.6 The prophet also commonly functions as an intercessor with God on behalf of the community.7 Moreover, prophecy involves social interaction with an audience. The individual's claim to possess the authentic divine word must be validated by the intended audience.8 The character of the prophetic message likely changes based on this 3. Martti Nissinen, preface to Prophecy in Its Ancient Near Eastern Context: Mesopotamian, Biblical and Arabian Perspectives, ed. M. Nissinen (Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2000), vii; see also the article by David L. Petersen in the same volume, "Defining Prophecy and Prophetic Literature," 33-^46. By emphasizing the importance of prophecy as the transmission of a divine message, Nissinen's definition is adaptable to different social and religious contexts, while at the same time resists labeling all human-divine communication as prophecy. See also the complementary definition of a "prophet" found in James L. Kugel, How to Read the Bible: A Guide to Scripture Then and Now (New York: Free Press, 2007), 439: "a messenger sent by God to speak on His behalf." 4. On prophetic revelation, see Gerhard von Rad, Old Testament Theology, vol. 2, The Theology of Israel's Prophetic Traditions (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1960), 59-63; and Lester L. Grabbe, Priests, Prophets, Diviners, Sages: A Socio-Historical Study of Religious Specialists in Ancient Israel (Valley Forge: Trinity, 1995), 107-12. 5. Thus, Kugel 's definition (see n. 3 herein) emphasizes the prophet as a divine messenger. This role is generally understood as divinely mandated, though it is sometimes also self-sanctioned or deter mined by the people. This understanding of prophecy comports with the commonly understood etymol ogy of the Hebrew title xm. Scholars trace this word to the Semitic cognate nab? (to name, invoke) and the ?T33 is therefore "one who is called by God"?a divine spokesperson. See William F. Albright, From the Stone Age to Christianity: Monotheism and the Historical Process (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1946), 231-32; and Klaus Koch, The Prophets, vol. 1, The Assyrian Period (Philadelphia, PA: Fortress Press, 1983), 16. See also the recent challenge to this hypothesis in Daniel E. Fleming, "The Etymological Origins of the Hebrew n?b? ': The One Who Invokes God," Catholic Biblical Quar terly 55 (1993): 217-24; and further defense of the traditional understanding in John Huehnegard, "On the Etymology and Meaning of Hebrew nab?T Eretz-lsrael 26 (1999): 88*-93*. 6. This aspect rules out other modes of religious piety that are only interested in the immediate human?divine exchange (e.g., mysticism) (cf. n. 3 herein). On the content of the divine message and its prophetic articulation, see the foundational work of Claus Westermann, Basic Forms of Prophetic Speech (Cambridge: Lutterworth; Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 1991). 7. On this function, see Yochanan Muffs, "VvTio Will Stand in the Breach? A Study of Prophetic Intercession," in Love and Joy: Law, Language and Religion in Ancient Israel (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1992), 9-48. On further roles of the prophet, see Kugel, How to Read the Bible, 440. 8. The validation of one's prophetic claims by an audience thus creates a subclassification of prophecy as either "true" or "false." These value judgments are placed on the prophecy not as objective criteria for access to the divine. Rather, the audience may deem a prophetic message to be incommen surate with the divine word and will and thus "false." Yet in many cases, the experience is still identified 300</page><page sequence="3">Prophets and Prophecy in the Qumran Community social interaction.9 In the Hebrew Bible, individuals engaged in this type of activity are identified by various technical terminology: WH (prophet), nm (visionary), ron (seer), DT^xn wx (man of God), and *ny (servant).10 The end of prophecy? Much biblical scholarship has assumed that the phenomenon of prophecy as defined here ceased at some point in the early post-exilic period.11 These scholars with the terminological rubric "prophecy." See further discussion in James L. Crenshaw, Prophetic Conflict: Its Effect upon Israelite Religion (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1971), 1-4; cf. Jassen, Mediating the Divine, 289-90. Indeed, as we shall see later, the Qumran texts identify their opponents as "lying prophets" (lQHa 12). This designation, following biblical precedent, retains the classification of "prophets," while simultaneously maligning their prophetic character as "lying" and thus identifying them as illegitimate prophets. 9. On this characteristic of the prophetic experience, see Thomas W. Overholt, Channels of Prophecy: The Social Dynamics of Prophetic Activity (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press, 1989); and, more recently, William Doan and Terry Giles, Prophets, Performances, and Power: Performance Criti cism of the Hebrew Bible (New York: T. &amp; T. Clark, 2005). For a more comprehensive treatment of the social context of prophecy, see Robert R. Wilson, Prophecy and Society in Ancient Israel (Philadelphia, PA: Fortress Press, 1980). 10. Namely, the biblical authors identify such individuals as prophets using these termini techni. Individuals engaging in this activity do not always claim for themselves such prophetic status or employ these titles as self-designations. See, for example, Amos's rejection of any prophetic preten sions (Amos 7:14). 11.

For a fuller discussion of the various 301</page><page sequence="4">Alex R Jas s en are often guided by two features. First, the sum of Second Temple-period literary evidence indicates that prophecy as it appears in the Hebrew Bible was not nearly as ubiquitous in the Second Temple period. Second, several documents from the Second Temple period advance the claim that prophecy had long since ceased.12 The appearance of such negative claims suggests that at least some seg ments of Second Temple Judaism questioned the continued viability of prophecy after the biblical period.13 Despite the claim made by these passages, other scholars point to several sources from the Second Temple period that seem to indicate the continued vitality of prophetic phenomena that claim continuity with biblical models.14 Josephus is one of the more important of the corpora in this theories offered to explain the end of prophecy, see Jassen, Mediating the Divine, 12-13 n. 26. My earlier discussion should now be supplemented by Kugel, How to Read the Bible, 440. Kugel follows earlier scholars (e.g., Talmon) in viewing the prominence of prophecy as directly related to the existence of the monarchy Kugel explains this correspondence by identifying the institution of prophecy as a system of checks and balances for the monarchy. With the disappearance of the latter during the Babylonian exile, prophecy lost its primary purpose. 12. See Psalm 74:9; 1 Maccabees 9:27,4:46, 14:41; Josephus, Against Apion 1.41;Baruch 1:21; Prayer of Azariah 15; 2 Baruch 85:1; as well as several statements in later rabbinic literature: M.

Scholars on both sides of this argument have at their disposal a corpus of support ing material. Ultimately, it must be assumed that Second Temple Jewish social groups held several different viewpoints on the question of ongoing prophetic activity in their own time. One issue still remains, however. The description of active prophets and pro phecy is limited in Second Temple-period literature. Indeed, even those scholars who argue for ongoing prophecy only marshal a small amount of unequivocal references to contemporary prophetic activity. Moreover, when prophecy does seem to appear in Second Temple documents, it only rarely resembles its biblical antecedents. Rather, prophecy appears in forms either unknown or not emphasized in the biblical record. This situation underscores a basic assumption about prophecy and the so-called classical age of prophecy: Prophecy and prophetic phenomena persist in some segments of Second Temple Judaism, though in a modified manner. Accordingly, terms such as "cessation" or "disappearance" are inap propriate. At the same time, it is incorrect to consider Israel's biblical prophetic heritage in the same context as Second Temple-period prophecy. Both a real and an assumed distinction exist. The "real" distinction is apparent from careful analysis of the relevant literature in which contemporary prophecy looks significantly different from biblical prophecy. This distinction is reinforced by the new language of prophecy that emerges in the Second Temple period. Individuals who mediate the divine word are rarely identified with classical biblical prophetic epithets. The "assumed" distinction can be found in the numerous ancient witnesses to the transformed character of postbiblical prophecy. The evidence provided by Josephus furnishes a useful template for thinking about prophecy in Second Temple Judaism.17 With rare exceptions, Josephus 15. See, for example, the description of Judah the Essene in War 1.78-80 (discussed later). On contemporary prophecy in Josephus, see Meyer, "Prophecy and Prophets," 6:823-27; Joseph Blenkin sopp, "Prophecy and Priesthood in Josephus," Journal of Jewish Studies 25 (1974): 239-62; Louis H.

Grabbe, "Thus Spake the Prophet Josephus...: The Jewish Histor ian on Prophets and Prophecy," in Floyd and Haak, Prophets, Prophecy, and Prophetic Texts, 240-47. 16. See, for example, the prophetic identity applied to Jesus in Matthew 21:10-11. The most thorough treatment of prophecy in early Christianity is Aune, Prophecy in Early Christianity and the Ancient Mediterranean World. 17. It is well known that evidence from Josephus is notoriously difficult to use in order to recon struct Jewish society in the Second Temple period (see, e.g., the treatment of Josephus's presentation of 303</page><page sequence="6">Alex R Jas s en introduces the biblical prophets with the term 7Cpo(pr)xr|? (prophet), while contem porary prophets are distinguished by the title jkxvti? (mantic).18 For example, when Josephus recounts Judah the Essene's prediction of the murder of Antigonus (War 1.78-80), he identifies Judah with the latter terminology (xov u?vnv).19 Moreover, Judah's predictions are identified as 7ipoppn9?vT(ov (predictions) and u?vT?D|ia (oracles), but never with the terminological designation "prophecies." At the same time, the activity of Judah the Essene comports with Josephus's more general understanding of the predictive role of prophets and prophecy.20 While Judah's actions are prophetic, Josephus carefully refrains from identifying him as a prophet. In light of this phenomenon, Josephus's claim in Against Apion (1.41) that the "exact succession of prophets" had ended during the period of Artaxerxes can be better understood. This passage is often understood as evidence that Josephus maintained that prophecy had ceased in the early post-exilic period.21 On the con trary, he merely marks a distinction between contemporary prophets and those belonging to Israel's biblical heritage. While prophecy does not cease, it is trans formed to such an extent that later prophetic writings are unfit for inclusion into the sacred history.22 Prophecy as it was performed and perceived in the pre exilic period had come to an end at some point in the early post-exilic period. contemporary views on life after death in C. D. Elledge, Life after Death in Early Judaism: The Evi dence of Josephus [T?bingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2006]). My use of Josephan prophetic terminology here is therefore aware of the possible pitfalls of translating Josephus's literary presentation into a statement of social reality. At the same time, there does not seem to be any indication that Josephus is reformatting prophecy and prophetic terminology in Second Temple Jewish society to comport with the language of his Hellenistic audience or to craft a positive portrait of Judaism. Rather, I am suggesting that Josephus, as a participant in Second Temple Judaism, witnesses the various Second Temple period transform ations of biblical prophecy. He is acutely aware of the modified character of prophecy in his own time and therefore deliberately employs distinct terminology to mark this change. 18. This feature has been well documented in the scholarly literature. See Jannes Reiling, "The Use of ^EYAOnPOOHTHZ in the Septuagint, Philo and Josephus," Novem Testamentum 13 (1971): 156; Blenkinsopp, "Prophecy and Priesthood," 240, 262; and Gray, Prophetic Figures, 23-26. Two exceptions are treated in David E. Aune, "The Use of nPOOHTHX in Josephus," Journal of Biblical Literature 101 (1982): 419-21. An additional exception where the verb 7cpo(prrt??av {War 1.68) is employed in reference to John Hyrcanus is observed by Sommer, "Did Prophecy Cease?" 40 n. 36. 19. On Judah the Essene in Josephus, see in general, Gray, Prophetic Figures, 92-95. 20. On the predictive character of prophecy in Josephus, see Blenkinsopp, "Prophecy and Priesthood," 242-46; Feldman, "Prophets and Prophecy," 227-30; and Gray, Prophetic Figures, 30 34. 21. See, for example, H. St. J. Thakeray, Josephus: The Man and the Historian (New York: Ktav, 1968), 79; Blenkinsopp, "Prophecy and Priesthood," 240; and Roger Beckwith, The Old Testa ment Canon of the New Testament Church and its Background in Early Judaism (London: SPCK, 1985), 371-72. 22. See Sid Z. Leiman, "Josephus and the Canon of the Bible," in Josephus, the Bible, and History, ed. L. H. Feldman and G. Hata (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1989), 56. A similar argument is advanced in Blenkinsopp, "Prophecy and Priesthood," 241; Gray, Prophetic Figures, 23-26; and Gnuse, Dreams and Dream Reports, 23. 304</page><page sequence="7">Prophets and Prophecy in the Qumran Community At the same time, new prophetic models emerged that performed similar mediating functions.23 Identifying prophecy in the Second Temple period If prophecy never really ceases in the Second Temple period but is dramati cally transformed, how can we begin to study postbiblical prophecy? As is readily apparent, restricting oneself to texts in which individuals are introduced with bib lical prophetic titles would yield a very short list; indeed, it would exclude most of Josephus's evidence. Furthermore, one cannot merely treat all references to indi viduals who claim to have some intimate knowledge of the divine word. Such an approach would widen the scope of prophecy to include a host of other modes of religious piety, such as apocalypticism or mysticism, which do not always them selves claim a prophetic consciousness. This latter point is especially critical to the study of prophecy in the Second Temple period. Prophets in the Hebrew Bible often deny their own prophetic status?for example, Amos's statement that he is neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet (Amos 7:14). Prophets in the Second Temple period, in contrast, consciously view themselves as heirs to the ancient prophets and their own activity as the contemporary realization of the ancient prophetic experience. The identification of this prophetic conscious ness distinguishes Second Temple prophets from individuals or groups who merely claim to be the recipients of divine revelation and/or locate themselves in continuity with the ancient prophets. I propose that there are two primary approaches that can be taken in order to locate prophecy in its Second Temple-period context. First, and perhaps relatively simple, is to look for explicit prophetic language. It should be clear by now that this type of language is not as widespread in Second Temple literature as we would hope. However, it is present?for example, in the identification of Jesus as a prophet (6 7tpo(pf|Tri?) in Matthew 21:11?and functions as a very straight forward tool for locating prophecy. We must, however, display flexibility in this approach. For example, Josephus's consistent use of uavii? for contemporary pro phets should be understood as a modified prophetic designation. The second approach that I suggest is aimed at identifying the transformed language of postbiblical prophecy and the modified context of its application. In the foregoing discussion of Josephus, I noted that the foretelling of the future is a hallmark of Josephus's understanding of prophecy. As such, individuals in the Second Temple period whom Josephus describes as engaging in this activity are often understood by him to be prophets. How do we know, however, that this pre dictive activity represents Josephus's new model of prophets and prophecy? The answer to this question can be found in Josephus's systematic representation of the 23. See further similar treatment of these general questions in David L. Petersen, "Rethinking the End of Prophecy," in W?nschent Jerusalem Frieden: Collected Communications to the Xllth Con gress of the International Organization for the Study of the Old Testament, Jerusalem 1986, ed. M. Augustin and K. D. Schunck (Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang, 1988), 65-71; and Kugel, How to Read the Bible, 633. 305</page><page sequence="8">Alex P. Jas s en classical prophets from Israel's biblical heritage together with more general treat ment of the nature of prophecy. Among the many roles and functions associated with prophecy, Josephus identifies prophets as foretellers of the future.24 More over, for Josephus, they are also historians and closely related to the institution of the priesthood.25 Thus, Josephus's more general reconfiguration of prophecy provides us with the tools necessary to identify his conceptualization of prophets and prophecy in his own time. In some respects, his portrait of prophecy is con ditioned by his personal ideological agenda; thus, the prophet as historian legiti mizes his own history writing project as "prophetic" and provides it with divine approbation.26 At the same time, we can imagine that much of the new language of prophecy espoused by Josephus is drawn from more general attitudes and assumptions regarding prophets and prophecy in the Second Temple period. The general framework I have identified for Josephus can be applied to different social groups and literary corpora in Second Temple Judaism. I suggest that the new rubrics of prophecy can be found in the systematic re-presentation of the ancient prophets in the various literary corpora from Second Temple Judaism. This literature is replete with material that recontextualizes and reconceptualizes the prophetic experience of the classical biblical prophets, presumably in light of con temporary notions of prophets and prophecy. This material therefore provides a fra mework for beginning to map out the modified modes of prophecy operating in Second Temple Judaism.27 II. PROPHECY AT QUMRAN! THE STATE OF THE QUESTION Let me now discuss in greater detail one context in which my suggested method can be applied?the Qumran community.28 By this designation, I mean 24. See n. 20 herein. 25. See Blenkinsopp, "Prophecy and Priesthood"; and Feldman, "Prophets and Prophecy." 26. On Josephus's self-identification as a prophet, see discussion in Gray, Prophetic Figures, 35-39; and Gnuse, Dreams and Dream Reports, 21-33. 27. A similar method has been applied in varying degrees to several different literary corpora. See, for example, William M. Schniedewind's study of prophecy in Chronicles, The Word of God in Transition: From Prophet to Exegete in the Second Temple Period (Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1995). As Schniedewind asserts, Chronicles is "on the one hand, an interpretation of ancient prophecy and, on the other hand, a reflection of post-exilic prophecy itself (22). See also the study of Ben Sira's por trait of the ancient prophets in his "Hymn to the Fathers" (44:1-50:24) in Helge Stadelmann, Ben Sira als Schriftgelehrter: Eine Untersuchung zum Berufsbild des vor-makkab?ischen Sofer unter Ber?ck sichtigung seines Verh?ltnisses zu Priester-, Propheten- und Weisheitslehrertum (T?bingen: Mohr Siebeck, 1980).

Qumran scholarship has recognized that the community that produced and preserved the Dead Sea Scrolls underwent various stages in its historical and ideological development. Numerous documents are identified as representative of early formative stages of the community. Likewise, some sectarian documents such as the Damascus Document may indicate different parts of a parent movement to which the Qumran community belonged. Furthermore, redaction-critical approaches to the numerous manuscripts of the Rule of the Community and the Damascus Document have demon strated that these texts underwent several compositional stages. In all likelihood, several of these com positional layers reflect historical and ideological developments within the sectarian community. Thus, the term "Qumran community" ultimately refers to a movement in a fairly constant state of historical and religious development. See the discussion in Philip R. Davies, The Damascus Covenant: An Interpretation of the "Damascus Document" (Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1983); more recently, Gabriele Boccaccini, Beyond the Essene Hypothesis: The Parting of the Ways between Qumran and Enochic Judaism (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1998); John J. Collins, "Forms of Community in the Dead Sea Scrolls," in Emanuel: Studies in the Hebrew Bible, Septuagint and Dead Sea Scrolls in Honor ofEmanuel Tov, ed. S. M. Paul et al. (Leiden: E. J.

Brill, 2006), 81-96. Some of the discussion of prophecy in the community is informed by these considerations. For example, my study of law and prophecy at Qumran (Alex P. Jassen, "The Presentation of the Ancient Prophets as Lawgivers at Qumran," Journal of Biblical Literature 127 [2008]: 307-37) treats some modifications in sectarian attitudes as evinced by redactional developments in several keys texts. 307</page><page sequence="10">Alex R Jas s en texts that represent the larger eclectic literary production of Second Temple Judaism.30 Our knowledge of this community derives from its own writ ings as found among this larger library of biblical and Second Temple-period literature.31 Many scholars have argued that prophecy was active at Qumran.32 They furthermore identify the Teacher of Righteousness as a prophet on account of his status as an inspired interpreter of ancient prophetic 30. On the contents of the Qumran library and its classificatory divisions, see Devorah Dimant, "The Qumran Manuscripts: Contents and Significance," in Time to Prepare the Way in the Wilderness: Papers on the Qumran Scrolls by Fellows of the Institute for Advanced Studies of the Hebrew Univer sity, Jerusalem, 1989-1990, ed.

For a discussion of methodological rubrics for distinguishing between sectarian and nonsectarian manuscripts, see Carol A. Newsom, '"Sectually Explicit' Literature from Qumran," in The Hebrew Bible and Its Interpreters, ed. W. H. Propp, B. Halpern, and D. N. Freed man (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1990), 167-87. On the distinction between sectarian and non sectarian texts, see later discussion. 31. The sectarian community of the Dead Sea Scrolls is commonly identified by scholars as the Essenes based on numerous parallels between the community as described in the scrolls and the Essenes as known from classical sources (see Todd S. Beall, Josephus ' Description of the Essenes Illus trated by the Dead Sea Scrolls [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988]). WTiile this community may very well be Essenes or some closely related group, my interest here is primarily in what we can determine about the community based on the material from the Dead Sea Scrolls. The harmonization of information about the Essenes from Josephus and Philo with the description of the sectarian community in the scrolls is problematic and should be avoided. See the discussion in Albert I. Baumgarten, "The Rule of the Martian as Applied to Qumran," Israel Oriental Studies 14 (1994): 121-42. This is especially true with regard to the study of prophecy. Josephus often discusses prophecy among the Essenes and identifies specific Essenes as prophets (see Gray, Prophetic Figures, 80-111). Very little in this description comports with the evidence regarding prophecy in the community of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The most often discussed parallel between the Essene prophets in Josephus and the Dead Sea Scrolls is Josephus's report that the Essenes predicted the future with the aid of scripture (War 2.159). Scholars have long suggested that this is identical to the inspired interpretation of scripture espoused in the Qumran Pesharim (see, e.g., Blenkinsopp, "Prophecy and Priesthood," 247; and Aune, Prophecy in Early Christianity and the Ancient Mediterranean World, 133-34). More careful analysis of these questions, however, has convincingly demonstrated that, notwithstanding superficial simi larities, these two phenomena are in fact quite different. See, in particular, Gray, Prophetic Figures, 105-107; see also Rotem, "Ha-nevu'ah," 68-73; and Barstad, "Prophecy at Qumran?" 120. 32. A.

At the same time, as other scholars have observed, no text among the Dead Sea Scrolls explicitly applies classical prophetic terminology to the Teacher of Righteousness or any communal activity.34 If biblical terminol ogy and definitions of prophecy are applied to the Qumran corpus, then prophecy is not a feature at Qumran. All of these approaches are partially correct. It is true that the Teacher of Righteousness is an inspired interpreter of ancient scripture. But the more impor tant question is, did the Qumran community conceive of this act as a prophetic experience? It is likewise true that no explicit prophetic language is employed to describe any member of the community. At the same time, are we being too rigid with our prophetic terminology by attempting to apply to Qumran a foreign set of prophetic models and language?35 Following the method outlined here, analysis of these questions must begin with the sectarian writings and the portrait they present of the community's con ceptualization of prophecy and revelation. The Qumran sectarians recontextu alized the classical biblical prophets in the mold of their own conception of prophets and prophecy. The same can be said for the nonsectarian literature that is equally representative of the larger literary heritage of Second Temple Jewish society. These re-presentations of ancient prophets expand considerably the clas sical biblical portrait of prophecy and revelation and therefore provide a frame work for identifying the modified modes of divine mediation operating at Qumran and in related segments of Second Temple Judaism.36 The phenomena that I discuss here can all be classified under the general definition of prophecy presented earlier. For the Qumran community, biblical conceptions of prophecy and prophets are adapted to a new social setting.37 33.

Indeed, it is this precise method that compels Barstad, in "Prophecy at Qumran?" to con clude that prophecy was not a live phenomenon at Qumran. Barstad reaches this conclusion through careful analysis of explicit prophetic terminology in the Qumran corpus (i.e., tra). The exclusive reliance on biblical prophetic terminology ultimately misses a much wider and variegated world of prophecy in the Dead Sea Scrolls. 36. For a similar application of this methodological approach, see Brooke, "Prophecy and Prophets." Brooke correctly observes that any discussion of prophecy at Qumran must expand beyond biblical notions of prophecy. He therefore examines several phenomena that he argues were regarded as prophetic by the Qumran community. The most important of these phenomena is the inspired interpretation and rewriting of scripture. Indeed, my analysis of scriptural interpretation in the Dead Sea Scrolls yields a similar understanding of the prophetic context for this activity. 37. See further Nissinen's recent treatment of prophecy in the Dead Sea Scrolls, "Transmitting Divine Mysteries," esp. 515-17. In addressing the terminological issue, Nissinen argues that we must 309</page><page sequence="12">Alex P Jas s en In what follows, I examine several sets of texts that illustrate the phenom enon I am describing. Section III treats the question of explicit prophetic language in the Dead Sea Scrolls as applied to the members and leader(s) of the Qumran community. Here, I focus on one particular passage from the Hodayot. Sections IV and V apply my second methodological consideration?examination of the modified language of prophecy at Qumran. I similarly draw on representative examples to illustrate the several ways that prophecy is reconfigured in the Dead Sea Scrolls and the implications of this reconfiguration for understanding how prophecy was conceptualized in the Qumran community. In searching for this modified language of prophecy, I examine two ways in which the ancient prophets and their prophetic experience are re-presented in the Qumran corpus: the prophetic framework for the inspired exegesis of scripture (revelatory exegesis) and the cultivation of divine wisdom (sapiential revelation). One additional methodological point must be made before proceeding with analysis of the textual material. My primary interest in this study is prophecy in the sectarian community that inhabited Qumran, not in the entire corpus of Dead Sea Scrolls. My discussion of prophecy at Qumran, however, necessarily moves between the sectarian and nonsectarian texts. The former attest directly to the worldview of the community. The latter, however, are also critical to understand ing the community. Foremost, they provide a glimpse into the larger literary and religious context in which the community was formed and developed. More specific to my present interest in prophecy, these nonsectarian texts evince various ways in which Second Temple Judaism recognized the transformative character of prophecy in its own time. This is especially central to my second methodological rubric. Thus, in sections IV and V, my treatment of the modified character of prophecy begins with an examination of nonsectarian Second Temple-period texts and then moves to the sectarian material. This approach demonstrates how the analysis of the sectarian material can be enriched by recog nizing its larger literary and social context, and, at the same time, indicates that the understanding of prophecy in the sectarian texts was part of much wider currents in Second Temple Judaism.38 be flexible in our understanding of both the language of prophecy and the scholarly construct of its social features. My approach here follows Nissinen's emphasis on human transmission of divine mes sages as the central feature of prophetic activity (see n. 3 herein). Much material in the Dead Sea Scrolls purports to reflect an encounter with the divine. In order to label such phenomena as prophecy, however, we must be able to demonstrate that the community viewed this activity as the human trans mission of the word of God and that this activity was regarded as continuing the prophetic activity of ancient Israelite prophecy 38. Space, unfortunately, does not permit a full exploration of all the textual evidence that sup ports my arguments. I have selected several illustrative examples that I see as foundational to the com munity's prophetic character and therefore to my argument. For a fuller discussion of each of these texts, as well as treatment of additional examples, see Jassen, Mediating the Divine. I will indicate the specific references in the appropriate place in the notes. One area not treated here is the prophetic framework for the formation of law in the Qumran community. Elsewhere, I argue that the community 310</page><page sequence="13">Prophets and Prophecy in the Qumran Community III. Looking for Explicit Prophetic Language in the Dead Sea Scrolls I noted earlier that many scholars have correctly observed that explicit prophetic terminology of biblical origins is never applied to the community or its leaders. Biblical prophetic terminology is reserved for the ancient prophets and the prophet(s) expected at the end of days.39 Moreover, communal activity is never represented through the use of standard biblical prophetic language (i.e., the root Km). In light of the nonexistent evidence of explicit prophetic language, we might assume that my first methodological rubric cannot be applied to the Qumran corpus. As I suggested, however, we must be flexible in our search for prophetic language because such language is very mal leable in the Second Temple-period texts.40 Though the Dead Sea Scrolls never employ prophetic language in reference to sectarian leaders or communal activity, such language curiously appears in several places in descriptions of the community's opponents.41 The avoidance of prophetic language for the community and its members and the application of such explicit language to outsiders, as we shall see, is undoubtedly a deliberate technique in the communal writings. As such, the places where prophetic language is employed for outsiders is pregnant with implications regarding sectarian relations with nonsectarians and competing conceptions of prophecy and access to the divine. In this section, I analyze one particular text in which explicit prophetic language is applied to sectarian opponents?the hymnic unit that appears in column 12 of the Hodayot.42 The larger hymn in column 12 is generally identified viewed its legislative process as a prophetic experience and as commensurate with what it conceptual ized as the prophetic lawgiving of the ancient prophets. See Jassen, "Ancient Prophets as Lawgivers." 39. For a f?ll discussion of the textual evidence, see Jassen, Mediating the Divine, 25-131 (ancient prophets), 157-96 (eschatological prophet). See also Nissinen, "Transmitting Divine Mys teries," 517-25. 40. See similar remarks in Nissinen, "Transmitting Divine Mysteries," 517. 41. Here, I am referring specifically to sectarian documents. Prophetic language also appears in several nonsectarian texts. Such texts are helpful for ascertaining larger conceptions of prophecy in the Second Temple period. For example, several of these texts treat issues dealing with false and illegiti mate prophets (4Q339, List of False Prophets; 4Q375, Moses Apocryphon; 11Q19 54:8-18, Temple Scroll). Foremost, these texts indicate that prophecy was active in wider segments of Second Temple Judaism (see Brooke, "Prophecy and Prophets," 158-60). They further point to larger concerns with false and illegitimate prophecy in Second Temple Judaism. The extant Qumran texts provide some indication of the various individual and institutional responses. The presence of such texts at Qumran suggests that the Qumran community shared some of these concerns. For a full discussion of the sig nificance of these texts, see Jassen, Mediating the Divine, 299-306. 42. I am following the reordering of the columns advocated by Stegemann and Puech. Follow ing Sukenik's ordering, this hymn is lQHa 4:5-17. For a recent edition and translation, see Michael Wise, Martin Abegg, and Edward Cook, with Nechamia Gordon, in The Dead Sea Scrolls Reader: Po etical and Liturgical Texts, ed. D. W. Parry and E. Tov (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 2005), 26-27 (the trans lations here follow this edition, unless otherwise noted). The Cave 4 Hodayot manuscripts preserve some fragmentary text parallel to the Cave 1 material (4Q430 1 //lQHa 12:13-19; 4Q432 8 1//1QH3 12:10). See Eileen Schuller, in Discoveries in the Judaean DesertXXIX: Qumran Cave 4.XX: Poetical 311</page><page sequence="14">Alex R Jas s en as encompassing lQHa 12:5-13:4. The first section (12:5-9) of this hymn maps out in extremely polemical language a bitter dispute between the leader of the community?likely the Teacher of Righteousness43?and his opponents.44 The hymn focuses on the enemies of the sect and their misdirected attempts at changing the law (11. 9-11) and at justifying this behavior by asserting divine sanc tion for their actions (11. 13-16). Throughout the hymn, the enemies are described with prophetic terminology; they are "visionaries of deceit and error" (n*m Tin and myn Tin?11. 10,20) and consult with prophets, more specifically "lying prophets" (ntD "W^J?1. 16).45 Never, however, are the hymnist or the community identified in opposition as "true prophets" or even merely "prophets." As suggested earlier, however, this careful use of prophetic language is likely intentional. The deliberate construction of this hymn and its use and avoidance of explicit prophetic language informs our understanding both of the hymnist's attitude toward his opponents' prophetic claims, as well as his own prophetic consciousness. The relative use and Liturgical Texts, Part 2, ed. B. Nitzan et al. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1999), 197 (4Q430), 224 (4Q432). Only one possible variant exists among the manuscripts (4Q430 1 7//lQHa 12:18). Extended discussion of this hymn can be found in Jacob Licht, Megillat ha-hodayot: me-megillot midbar yehudah (Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1957), 90-91; Svend Holm-Nielsen, Hodayot: Psalms from Qumran (Aargus: Universitetsforlaget, 1960), 79, 89-90; Michael C.

See also the earlier (and less useful) study in Isaac Sonne, "A Hymn against Heretics in the Newly Discovered Scrolls and its Gnostic Background," Hebrew Union College Annual 23 (1950-51): 275-313. 43. Scholarly treatment of the authorship and Sitz im Leben of the Hodayot has generated a number of different models (see Douglas, "Power and Praise in the Hodayot," 1:1-76, for a recent thorough treatment of these issues). Here I am following the model originally presented by Jeremias and modified in varying degrees by later scholars. Jeremias observed that certain generic and literary features indicate the existence of two distinct literary units in the Hodayot. He designated one group the Teacher hymns (columns 10-17) on account of numerous overlaps between the hymnist's personal statements and the biographical information supplied about the Teacher of Righteousness in other sec tarian literature such as the pesharim. The surrounding community hymns were seen as the product of the more general Qumran community (see Douglas, ibid., for a recent defense and augmentation of Jer emias's proposal). Based on this understanding, the hymn in column 12 represents a personal statement of the Teacher of Righteousness that attests both to his personal experience of rejection and his indi vidual claims to divine revelation. Even if the hymn is not composed entirely by the Teacher, the author of this hymn was clearly an influential leader of the community (I therefore refer to the author of this hymn merely as the hymnist). Accordingly, this hymn offers unique insight into the rev elatory claims of the community's leadership. 44. The second half (12:29-13:4) represents an independent section that describes the failings of human beings and the resultant shortcomings of the individual. On the division of the two sections, see the discussion in Hughes, Scriptural Allusions and Exegesis, 103-104. My interest here is only in the first section. 45. On the possible prophetic nuances of r^a (If 7, 9), see Holm-Nielsen, Hodayot, 161 n. 29; Hughes, Scriptural Allusions and Exegesis, 107; and Nissinen, "Transmitting Divine Mysteries," 531. See also 4Q171 (4QpPsa) 1-10 i 27. 312</page><page sequence="15">Prophets and Prophecy in the Qumran Community of prophetic language in this hymn generates an oppositional relationship that is intended to represent the sectarian community and its leaders as the only legitimate mediators of the divine word, in contrast to the so-called prophets among the sec tanan opponents. The hymn opens with the hymnists' affirmation that he alone has received God's revelation: "as [perfe]ct light (D[in ]llXi7), you have revealed yourself (nnyDin) to me." The two key words in this opening affirmation serve to emphasize the hymnist's unmediated access to the divine. As several scholars have noted, D[in ]~)M? is likely intended as a singular form of the Urim and Thummim, which served an oracular purpose.47 This language therefore further emphasizes the hymnist's access to divine word and will.48 The second key word (nni7Din) uses explicit revelatory language to describe the nature of the hymnist's relationship with God.49 The revelatory affirmation that opens the hymn is found as well later in line 23 and therefore forms an inclusio for this part of the hymn (single underlining) as outlined in Figure l.50 The concluding portion of the inclusio likewise contains a description of the enemies' rejection of the hymnist notwithstanding his status as a conduit for divine strength. This forms an additional inclusio with material from the opening portions of the hymn in line 8 (double underlining) as further outlined in Figure 1. The implications of this double inclusio are clear. The hymnist's claim of revelation is intended to be understood implicitly throughout the intervening portion of the hymn. The rejection of this claim by the opponents becomes the second dominant theme of the intervening portion of the hymn. Throughout, the hymn employs parallel oppositional language to draw a comparison 46. The presence of contemporary prophetic activity in this hymn is noted in Barstad, "Proph ecy at Qumran?" 116-17. The limited purview of Barstad's study (see n. 35 herein), however, prevents any examination of its larger significance for understanding the wider context of prophecy in the Qumran corpus. 47. The suggestion was first made by Eliezer L. Sukenik, Megillot genuzot: sekira sheniyah (Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1950), 43, and has since been repeated by several scholars: Menachem Mansoor, The Thanksgiving Hymns: Translated and Annotated with an Introduction (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1961), 122-23; and Hughes, Scriptural Allusions and Exegesis, 80; cf. Licht, Megillat ha hodayot, 91. On the restoration, see discussion in Mansoor and Jassen, Mediating the Divine, 370 n. 30. 48. See also Holm-Nielsen, Hodayot, 80, who understands this expression as a "technical term for the perfect revelation which the members have shared." 49. To be sure, the root w is less common as a designation for revelation compared to the root r?y. See Deuteronomy 33:2; and Psalm 50:2, 80:2, 94:1. The root also appears in lQHa 17:31, 23:5-7. See further Holm-Nielsen, Hodayot, 80-81; and Hughes, Scriptural Allusions and Exegesis, 106. 50. This similarity is noted by Licht, Megillat ha-hodayot, 91; Douglas, "Power and Praise in the Hodayot," 1:105; and Hughes, Scriptural Allusions and Exegesis, 104. Note as well that the elements of the inclusio appear in a chiastic structure. Hughes (following Brownlee and De Vries) further observes that the language of illuminating the face of the hymnist may be a "subtle typological allusion" to the description of Moses as he descended from Sinai (Exodus 34:39). See Hughes, Scrip tural Allusions and Exegesis, 105. The alignment with Moses and Sinai may be an additional attempt to assert the hymnist's intimate relationship with God. 313</page><page sequence="16">Alex R Jas s en 1QH* 12:5-6, 8 ]?ai romn1? md nmTxn K,3 ^nx hdtix v&gt;? nnysnn o [m jiix*? 7133 "inra rDr?nT7X[ ] (5) vacitf I give thanks to you, O Lord, for you have made my face shine by your covenant, and [ ] (6) [ ] I seek you, and as an enduring dawning, as [perfe]ct light, you have revealed yourself to me.

Instead they drove me out from my land (9) as a bird from its nest. And all my friends and acquaintances have been driven away from me; they esteem me as a ruined vessel. In lines 9-13, we get a better idea of the specific misdeeds of the opponents. Here as well, the hymnist outlines the relationship between himself and his enemies in extremely polarizing language. The hymnist's implicit assertion of divine reve lation is contrasted with the use of explicit prophetic language to describe his enemies. Of course, his is a true revelation and theirs is not: But they are mediators of (10) a lie and visionaries of deceit (rr?"i Tim).

This is intended, however, to mirror the repeated use of the word to describe the opponents. For further discussion of this and other keywords in the hymn, see Douglas, "Power and Praise in the Hodayot," 1:109; and Hughes, Scriptural Allusions and Exegesis, 107. 56.

Jassen spoke distinctively in my heart (^2b2 nnuttf 1WN), for smooth things (mp^m) (11) directed to your people. The enemies are castigated for attempting to alter the law on behalf of the general public?to "exchange" the law "for smooth things" (mp^m). This latter term is often regarded as a pun on the Pharisaic term halakhot and contains an implicit condemnation of the Pharisaic exegetical approach.57 In particular, it highlights the sectarian community's understanding of the Pharisees as "false interpreters of the Torah who derive incorrect legal rulings from their exegesis."58 In contrast, this very same law is described in line 10 as that which God implanted in the heart of the hymnist. Not only is the proper understanding of the Torah and its appli cation the hymnist's sole prerogative, this derives from an intimate encounter with the divine.59 After outlining the main goals of the oppositional group, the hymn continues by articulating how this group proceeded to lead astray the nation with their erro neous teachings (11. 11-13). The hymn frames the oppositional relationship between the sect and its enemies within the context of the appeal to divine sanction (11. 12-16). The hymnist reaffirms his complete confidence in God that the enemies will eventually falter (12-13): But you O God, reject every plan (13) of Belial, and your counsel alone shall stand, and the plan of your heart shall remain forever. The hymn balances this presentation of the hymnist's divine access by relating how the opponents also seek divine sanction for their actions. Thus, the hymn con tinues by relating a number of methods by which the enemies of the sect attempt to mediate the divine word and gain divine approval of the application of their interpretation of the Torah, all of which are categorically condemned by the 57.

Some have objected that the term halakhot cannot be positively identified with Pharisaic legal practices and thus one should not immediately assume that the mp^n ,t^"m are the Pharisees. See, for example, John P. Meier, "Is There Halaka (the Noun) at Qumran," Journal of Biblical Literature 122 (2003): 150-55; and Newsom, Self as Symbolic Space, 308-309 (see further, Doudna, 4Q Pesher Nahum, 491-511).

This theme of the legal activity of the community and its leaders as a divinely sanctioned prophetic experience is drawn out more fully in several other sectarian texts (see 1QS 5:8-9, 8:15-16, 9:13-14). For a full discussion of these texts and the phenomenon, see Jassen "Ancient Prophets as Lawgivers," esp. 319-22, 329-34. 316</page><page sequence="19">Prophets and Prophecy in the Qumran Community hymnist. The primary strategy of the opponents is to consult God through the agency of illegitimate prophets (1. 16): They are pretenders; they hatch the plots of Belial, (14) they seek you with a double heart, and are not found in your truth. A root producing poison and worm wood is in their scheming. (15) With a willful heart they look about and seek you in idols. They have set the stumbling block of their iniquity before themselves, and they come (16) to seek you through the words of lying prophets corrupted by error (ran TilDtt nn WH). With mo[c]king lips and a strange tongue they speak to your people. (17) So as to make a mockery of all their works by deceit. In what follows, the hymnist offers an additional articulation of the divine recom pense that awaits the enemies. In this passage, the enemies are further identified as those "who have turned away from your covenant" (npmna mn iwx, 1. 19). This characterization contrasts with the initial affirmation at the beginning of the hymn that God has made the hymnist's "face shine by your covenant" (MD nmTNn ^D n3rp-Q*7, 1. 5). The unit then concludes with the hymnist reaffirming the just reward that awaits the righteous and concomitantly the need to remain stalwart in the face of the present opposition. He then rearticulates how the enemies reject him notwithstanding his status as a recipient of divine revelation. This clause, as noted earlier, parallels the revelatory claims in lines 5-6 and therefore forms a "revelatory" inclusio for the entire hymnic unit. The theme of illumination (root Tix) is found once more in the remainder of the hymn and generates another "revelatory" inclusio with material from the opening portion of the hymn as outlined in Figure 2. This final inclusio transforms the hymnist from an individual recipient of revelation to a prophetic messenger. In line 5, the hymnist exclaims that God lQHa 12:5 lQHa 12:27 nDrinn1? -&gt;&amp; nniTun 8,o ^nx ronx rrm ^s nmTxn ^m I give thanks to you, O Lord, for you have But by me you have illumined the face of made my face shine by your covenant many (or the general membership) Figure 2.

As made clear by the ensuing content (cited earlier), the hymnist refers here to his receipt of revelation. In line 27, the same language and imagery is employed. However, instead of the face of the hymnist being illumined, it is the face of the "many."61 The preposition ^n identifies the hymnist as the agent of this divine illumination. The hymnist can only serve in this mediating capacity on account of his personal illumination as recounted in line 5. This entire revel atory inclusio (11. 5 and 27) encloses the previous inclusio discussed earlier (11. 5-6 and 22-23). The latter identifies the individual revelation of the hymnist, while the former marks the transformation of this revelation from personal to public. In doing so, the hymnist is not merely one who has unmediated access to God; he is now entrusted with the responsibility to mediate the divine word and will to a larger audience. Throughout this hymn, the opponents of the sect are characterized with expli cit prophetic language, while the hymnist and the sectarian community are curiously identified without any such language. The oppositional language frames the entire passage as the hymnist's explicit claim of revelation and a rejection of the competing claims of his opponents.62 The hymnist is entirely confident that he has knowledge of the divine will and enjoys divine favor. Implicit in this claim, and indicated by the oppositional literary structure, is the accusation that the prophets do not possess either of these features. This is reinforced by the negative prophetic assessments that accompany the description of the opponents?they are visionaries of deceit and error and consult lying prophets. The hymnist deliberately refrains from refer ring to himself with prophetic terminology similar to that of his opponents. The enemies merely claim to possess prophetic revelation. Neither they, nor do the would-be prophets who attempt to prophesy on their behalf, possess such access. The hymnist, by contrast, establishes his word as the explicit divine voice and sees himself as the legitimate mediator of the divine word. IV. Scripture, Exegesis, and Prophecy in the Dead Sea Scrolls Let me now turn to the application of my second methodological approach. As argued earlier, in order to penetrate the presumed prophetic character of the Qumran community, we must identify the new language of prophecy advocated by the community. In this section, I discuss one of these modified modes of proph ecy in the Dead Sea Scrolls and the context of its application at Qumran?re velatory exegesis. This term refers to the conceptualization of the reading, 61. The term D^m here may merely designate a larger audience. Alternatively, it may be understood in its narrowly sectarian sense as the "members of the community" (1QS 6:7-21). See the similar expression D^l ^D THr^l, "to illuminate the face of the Many," in lQSb 4:27. 62. Cf. James R. Davila, "Heavenly Ascents in the Dead Sea Scrolls," in VanderKam and Flint, Dead Sea Scrolls after Fifty Years, 2:477-78; and George W. E. Nickelsburg, Ancient Judaism and Christian Origins: Diversity, Continuity, and Transformation (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press, 2003), 97. 318</page><page sequence="21">Prophets and Prophecy in the Qumran Community interpretation, and reconfiguration of ancient prophetic scripture as a prophetic experience.63 Already in the later stages of the Hebrew Bible, several prophets appear whose prophetic experience is marked not by traditional modes of revelation but by the inspired reading and reformulation of earlier prophetic scripture. For these individuals, the older prophecies serve as ancient divine communiqu?s now preserved in literary form. Guided by divine inspiration, these individuals reawaken the divine speech and decipher the contemporary application of the ancient prophetic word. This experience is identified as equivalent to classical modes of prophetic communication and its practitioners are singled out for their prophetic capabilities. In the Hebrew Bible, revelatory exegesis is especially present in Daniel's rereading of Jeremiah's seventy weeks prophecy (Daniel 9) and is symbolically represented in Ezekiel's act of swallowing a scroll (Ezekiel 3:l-3).64 The transition from prophet to scribe to exegete, to paraphrase William Schnie dewind's title for this phenomenon in Chronicles, has long been recognized and dis cussed in the context of Second Temple Judaism.65 Evidence throughout the Second Temple period testifies to the emerging understanding of the prophet not merely as one who receives the oral word of God but rather as one whose prophetic character is thoroughly literary. Divine revelation for such a "prophet" is experienced through 63. For a general discussion of this phenomenon, see Joseph Blenkinsopp, Prophecy and Canon: A Contribution to the Study of Jewish Origins (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1977), 128-32; David E. Aune, "Charismatic Exegesis in Early Judaism and Early Christianity," in The Pseudepigrapha and Early Biblical Interpretation, ed. J. H. Charlesworth and C. A. Evans (Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1993), 126-50. The phenomenon I refer to is described by different scholars with a variety of terminology?for example, "literary prophecy" or "charismatic exegesis." My avoid ance of the term "prophecy" is deliberate and intended to indicate that the Second Temple writers clearly distinguished between biblical prophetic revelatory models and those of their own time. In addition, while many individuals engaged in this activity can be described as having a charismatic or pneumatic experience, this is not necessarily universal. Thus, my use of "exegesis" is intended to emphasize that this process involves the reading and interpretation of scripture, while "revelatory" indi cates that this act was considered as a viable means of mediating the divine word and commensurate with the revelatory models in which the ancient prophets received the word of God (see further, Jassen, Mediating the Divine, 203-207). 64.

As inspired readers of scripture, these later interpreters are not merely asserting that they possess a "correct" understand ing of the earlier traditions. Rather, as inspired interpreters, they contend that they are presenting the "true" meaning of these ancient prophecies as they relate to the present circumstances. This secondary exegetical process is now understood as an equally viable?sometimes the only viable?realization of the prophetic experience.66 The Qumran community was heir to this widespread biblical and postbibli cal reality. Moreover, the community further contributed to its promotion with its own reconfiguration of ancient prophecy and its contemporary application?in pesher literature. I will first examine one example of revelatory exegesis in the community's inherited literary tradition?Daniel 9?before turning to analysis of pesher exegesis and its prophetic framework. Daniel and the new language of prophetic revelation61 Among the wealth of literature held in high esteem by the Qumran commu nity are several Daniel texts, both canonical and apocryphal.68 The large number 66. Blenkinsopp, Prophecy and Canon, 132; and Aune, "Charismatic Exegesis," 128-29. 67. For consideration of space, I limit my discussion to Daniel 9. The phenomenon I am describ ing here can be found in several additional biblical and parabiblical texts among the Dead Sea Scrolls. In particular, several of the apocryphal Daniel texts in the Qumran corpus (4Q243-245), though often prohibitively fragmentary, seem to evince similar features as those that I am describing in Daniel 9. See full discussion in Jassen, Mediating the Divine, 221-25. See also the discussion of the related phenom enon in 4QApocryphon of Jeremiah C in ibid., 225-30. 68. My use of the terms "canonical" and "apocryphal" is intended to reflect our current classi fication of the works. It is very likely that many of the Daniel texts were considered scripturally sacred in the Qumran community in varying degrees (though only the canonical Daniel is cited authoritatively; see n. 80 herein).

Apocryphal material related to Daniel includes the 4QPrayer of Nabonidus (4Q242), 4QPseudo-Daniefb (4Q243-244), 4QPseudo-Danielc (4Q245), 4QApocryphon of Daniel (4Q246), 4QFour Kingdomsab (4Q552-553), and 4QDaniel-Susanna?

At the beginning of the chapter, Daniel is presented as consulting "the books concerning the number of years that, according to the word of the Lord that had come to Jeremiah the prophet, were to be the term of Jerusalem's desolation?seventy years" (Daniel 9:2). In its original context, Jeremiah's prophecy refers to the devastation of Jer usalem at the hands of the Babylonians in the sixth century BCE. For the second-century BCE author of Daniel, however, this "desolation" refers not to the Babylonian devastation but rather to the desolation suffered by Jerusalem in the second century BCE by the Seleucids. Daniel's initial recontextualization of Jeremiah's word is reinforced when the angel Gabriel provides him with further exegetical assistance. Gabriel asserts that Jeremiah's seventy years actually refer to seventy weeks of years and thus 490 years (Daniel 9:24). This new chronologi cal sequence locates the end of Jeremiah's "seventy years" and the attendant res toration around the second century BCE. Thus, Jeremiah's prediction of hope and restoration for the Babylonian exiles is in actuality a message of imminent redemption for those suffering under the Seleucid oppression. At first glance, the interpretation of Jeremiah's prophecy and its application to the circumstances of the second century BCE appears to be common exegetical technique. Indeed, Jewish and Christian biblical interpretation regularly asserts that scripture has meaning beyond its original context and can be expounded accordingly. Daniel's reapplication of Jeremiah's prophecy to a different historical time frame and Gabriel's reformulation of the precise meaning of its words, however, is understood by the author of Daniel as more than mere exegesis. Several elements in this chapter indicate that the reading and interpretation of Jer emiah's older prophetic word was considered commensurate with the other reve latory means employed throughout the book of Daniel. The prophetic revelatory framework of this exegetical activity is emphasized from the very beginning of the chapter. As in the chapters that describe Daniel's revelatory dreams and visions, chapter 9 opens with a superscription that recounts the regnal year in which the experience occurred.71 Immediately following this notice, we are informed that Daniel consulted with the scriptural writings (v. 2). This passage must be understood within the context of the other revelatory experi ences ascribed to Daniel in the latter half of the book. Each vision or dream is pre faced by a statement found at the beginning of the respective chapter affirming 69. On Daniel in general at Qumran, see John J. Collins, Apocalypticism in the Dead Sea Scrolls (London: Routledge, 1997), 12-18. 70. See, for example, Meyer, "Prophecy and Prophets," 6:819-20; Hengel, Zealots, 234-35; and Barton, Oracles of God, 180-81. 71. See Daniel 7:1, 8:1, 10:1, 11:1. 321</page><page sequence="24">Alex R Jas s en how this revelation is experienced. Daniel, with angelic assistance, then pro ceeds to interpret properly the meaning of the dream or vision. This model is retained in chapter 9, though the respective elements are dramatically different. Rather than alluding to a vision or dream he has experienced, Daniel here claims that he "consulted the writings." As with the dreams and visions encoun tered in other chapters, Daniel's consultation of the prophetic writings is concep tualized as a revelatory experience.73 The root employed here ("pn) is found elsewhere in the book to describe Daniel's receipt of revelation through visions and dreams.74 The prophetic revelatory framework of Daniel 9 is further emphasized when Gabriel is introduced. In verse 23, Gabriel announces to Daniel that "a word (127) went forth as you began your plea, and I have come to tell it, for you are precious." The "word" is Gabriel's interpretation of Jeremiah's prophecy as articulated in verses 24-27.75 The application of the term 121 here to Gabriel's revelatory interpretation serves to link this interpretation with the original "word of the Lord" (mm 121) that came to Jeremiah the prophet in verse 2 (cf. 9:25). Like Jeremiah's experience, Gabriel's revelatory exegesis is further conceptualized as the word of God.76 Gabriel explains to Daniel that he has come to tell him this "word." This declaration assumes that Daniel's previous understanding of Jeremiah's "word" is somehow deficient. Gabriel has appeared in order to elucidate its full meaning. He then exhorts Daniel, "so comprehend the word (mm "pm) and understand the vision (r\xim pm)" (Daniel 9:23). Here, im should be understood in the same context as its earlier usage in this verse. Furthermore, the same verbal root is used here ("pn), which Daniel earlier applied to his own reading of scripture (and other dreams and visions). Thus, Daniel is charged by Gabriel to understand Jeremiah's original prophetic "word" through the interpre tive prism of Gabriel's revelatory "word." This demand is balanced by a comp lementary directive to "understand the vision." The vision refers to Gabriel's words that follow in verses 24-27. The "word" and "vision" in Gabriel's instruc tion are presented as complementary terms, a parallelism strengthened by the iden tical verbal root employed for both ("pn). As in the first half of the verse, Gabriel's new reading of Jeremiah's original oracle is an equally accurate representation of the revealed divine word. 72. 7:1?"Daniel saw a dream and a vision of his mind on his bed"; 8:1-2?"A vision appeared to me, to me, Daniel, after the one that had appeared to me earlier. I saw a vision..."; 10:1?"An oracle was revealed to Daniel, who was called Beltshazzar. The oracle was true, but it was a great task to understand the prophecy; understanding came to him through a vision." 73. This point is generally recognized within scholarship on this chapter. See John E. Goldin gay, Daniel (Waco, TX: Word, 1989), 231; Collins, "Jewish Apocalypticism," 70. 74. 1:17, 8:5, 9:23, 10:11; cf. 8:27. The use of this verbal root also underscores the sapiential character of Daniel's activity. See section V herein. 75. See John J. Collins, Daniel: A Commentary on the Book of Daniel (Minneapolis, MN: For tress Press, 1993), 352. 76. See also the Septuagint on 9:23, which further qualifies the "word" as the "command of the Lord." 322</page><page sequence="25">Prophets and Prophecy in the Qumran Community The interpretive approaches attributed to Daniel and Gabriel in Daniel 9 each assume that Jeremiah's ancient prophecies lack meaning in their original context and are properly applied to the reality of a later time. For each, the process of reading and interpreting Jeremiah's prophetic word is itself a revelatory experience. Daniel's appropriation of Jeremiah's prophecy is described in the same manner as his other visions and dreams. Likewise, the entire interpretation of Gabriel is cast as a visionary experience. Scripture is understood as a medium of divine revelation equal to that of the other visions and dreams experienced by Daniel. The roots of this method stem from the understanding that Jeremiah's orig inal prophetic pronouncement represents the word of God. The full meaning of this divine revelation, however, is not readily apparent from a superficial reading of the scriptural text. Rather, this process requires an interpretive guide, a role fulfilled by Gabriel. The careful interpretation and reapplication of the scrip tural record actualizes the original divine communication. Accordingly, contem porary reading of scripture is nothing more than uncovering the original divine voice within the prophetic word.77 Daniel reached its final form in the second century BCE and enjoyed widespread popularity and influence in the Qumran community and wider segments of Second Temple Judaism.78 Accordingly, its presentation of shifting conceptualizations of prophecy and revelation provides an instructive tool for understanding the reconfiguration of prophecy in the late Second Temple period and at Qumran.79 Daniel testifies to a new sensibility regarding pro phecy, in which the receipt of the word of God took place through the inspired interpretation of older prophetic scripture and the reawakening of the embedded divine word. This newly deciphered divine word could then be understood as pertaining to contemporary circumstances in much the same way that the classical prophets applied their own received divine message to their larger social situation. For the author of Daniel and much of Second Temple Judaism?including Qumran?this represented one of the new mechanics of prophecy.80 77. Cf. Michael Fishbane, Biblical Interpretation in Ancient Israel (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1985), 484. 78. On the date of Daniel, see discussion in Collins, Daniel, 24-38. 79. To be sure, Daniel 9 is only partially preserved in the Qumran biblical scrolls (4Q116 [4QDane] = Daniel 9:12-17). There is little reason to suggest, however, that the entirety of this chapter (and indeed all of Daniel) was not known to the community in its present final form (save for textual variants). 80. This therefore accounts for the identification of Daniel as a prophet in the Dead Sea Scrolls (4Q174 1-3 ii 3; cf. 11Q13 2:18) as well as in other segments of Second Temple Judaism (Josephus, Ant., 10.245-^16, 249, 267-76). For a fuller discussion of Daniel's prophetic status, see Klaus Koch, "Is Daniel Also among the Prophets?" in Interpreting the Prophets, ed. J. L. Mays and P. J. Achtemeier (Philadelphia, PA: Fortress Press, 1987), 237-48; and Barton, Oracles of God, 35-37. 323</page><page sequence="26">Alex P Jassen Pesher and prophecy One of the most distinctive elements of Qumran literature is the prominence o? pesher exegesis. In pesher exegesis, the ancient prophetic word is interpreted as referring exclusively to the present and future history of the Qumran community and its position in the larger world. Qumran scholarship has often emphasized the distinction that exists between the pesher mode of scriptural exegesis and earlier and later models of Jewish biblical interpretation and commentary.81 Indeed, schol ars have offered a wide range of suggestions for the literary and ideological basis of this type of exegesis, with very little consensus reached.82 Without discounting the importance of these various approaches, I would like to suggest here that the precise mechanics of pesher exegesis and its ideological foundations are to be found in the emerging prominence of revelatory exegesis in Second Temple Judaism. Like Daniel 9 and other examples of revelatory exegesis, pesher litera ture is predicated on the assumption that the word of God is now transmitted through the scriptural text. The process of reading and interpreting this text is therefore conceptualized as a viable realization of the prophetic experience. Pesher literature, unlike nearly all Second Temple exegetical literature, con tains several self-conscious statements that allow us to penetrate the inner world of pesher exegesis and its ideological and literary foundations. The two programma tic statements on pesher exegesis in Pesher Habakkuk 2:5-10 and 7:1-5 are foun dational for understanding the community's promotion of revelatory exegesis and its insistence that its own inspired interpreters of ancient prophetic scripture engage in this very encounter:83 Col. 2: (5) And likewise vacate) the interpretation of the passage [concerns the trai]tors at the end of (6) days. They are the violator[s of the cove]nant who will not believe (7) when they hear all that is going to c[ome up]on the last generation from the mouth of (8) the priest, to whom God placed into [his heart discernme]nt to interpret all (9) the words of his servants the prophets [whom] through them God enumerated (10) all that is going to come upon his people and up [on ] 81. See, for example, Naphtali Wieder, "The Dead Sea Scrolls Type of Biblical Exegesis among the Karaites," in Between East and West: Essays Dedicated in Memory of Beta Horovitz, ed. A. Altman (London: East and West Library, 1958), 75, who remarks that the pesher method is sui generis in the history of Jewish biblical interpretation. See also Burrows, "Prophecy and the Prophets at Qumran," 227; and Lawrence H. Schiffman, Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls: The History of Judaism, the Back ground of Christianity, the Lost Library of Qumran (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1995), 223-25.

(3) vacat And when it says, "So that he can run who reads it" (Habakkuk 2:2), (4) its interpretation concerns the Teacher of Righteousness, to whom God made known (wnn) (5) all the mysteries of the words of his servants the prophets. The fundamental basis of pesher exegesis, as outlined in these two passages, is that the ancient prophecies found in scripture do not actually speak about the historical context of the prophet to whom they are attributed. Rather, they imagine contem porary circumstances, in particular the events surrounding the origins and escha tological realization of the Qumran community. Furthermore, as claimed in 7:2, the full meaning of these ancient oracles was not even known to the prophets who pronounced them. Only the contemporary inspired exegete, by virtue of this status, is equipped with the tools to decode the message. The Qumran commu nity acknowledged the Teacher of Righteousness as one such inspired exegete and therefore located him in a long line of similar inspired interpreters of scripture. For the community, however, he was not merely a brilliant exegete. Rather, his inspired exegesis of scripture was understood as an application of one of the new rubrics of prophecy. The portrait of the Teacher and his activity in these two passages under scores this understanding. Column 2, lines 2-3 identify the Teacher as one who speaks from the "mouth of God." The identification of the Teacher as a divine spokesman is reinforced in line 8, where we are informed that God provided the Teacher with "discernment" (or another word of cognition based on other recon structions),84 by which he is able to decipher the encoded prophetic words. Similar revelatory language appears in the description of the Teacher in column 7, though here we are informed more about the precise nature of the prophetic revelatory experience. In column 7, the presentation of the Teacher's knowledge in lines 4-5 must be understood in opposition to the seemingly unintelligible nature of the prophetic oracles as articulated in line 2. To the ancient prophet (here Habakkuk), God did not make known (1. 2, ismn tff?) the full understanding of the divine oracles. By contrast, God now makes known (1. 4, WTin) to the Teacher of Righteousness the meaning of the prophetic word.85 That which God did not divulge to the ancient prophet (1. 2, fpn im) is now revealed to the Teacher of Righteousness (1. 5, D^n^n vmv nm ti Vd).86 How exactly does God reveal this knowledge to the Teacher? As commen tators have observed, the biblical expression, "pIT, "he can run," has been 84. For a discussion of the suggested restoration, see Bilha Nitzan, Megillat pesher habakkuk (Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1986), 152. 85. The similarity in language is likewise noted by Nitzan, Pesher habakkuk, 171. 86. On this proposed equivalency, see William H. Brownlee, The Midrash Pesher of Habakkuk (Missoula, MT: Scholars Press, 1979), 112. 325</page><page sequence="28">Alex P. Jassen understood in the pesher as an allusion to "interpretation" or "explanation." Based on the pesher section, it is clear that this interpretive process focuses on the words of the ancient prophets. The nature of this interpretation is clarified by the second half of the biblical verse, "Q Kllpn, "who reads it." The understanding of the prophetic word is actualized through a process of reading, here strengthened by divine guidance?the divine bestowal of "discernment" identified in column 2. This divinely directed process is reserved exclusively for the Teacher of Righteousness, who is the "reader" assumed in the biblical passage.88 The corpus of pesher texts found at Qumran provides important evidence for the phenomenon of revelatory exegesis in Second Temple Judaism and its contin ued prophetic context. Scholars have correctly observed that the formal literary and exegetical features of pesher likely have their roots in the practice of dream interpretation in Jewish and non-Jewish contexts.89 These formal characteristics have been adapted from the framework of dream interpretation and applied to the process of deciphering a written text. This connection closely resembles the relationship between Daniel 9 and the other visions and dreams in the biblical book. In Daniel 9, the mechanics of interpreting dreams and visions throughout the book of Daniel are applied to the written word of the prophet Jeremiah. This interpretive process is equated with the other revelatory media found in the biblical book and identified as a viable mode for the transmission of the divine word. In Pesher Habakkuk, the Teacher of Righteousness appears as a latter-day Daniel, applying the mechanics of dream (and vision) interpretation to the process of reading prophetic scripture. According to Pesher Habakkuk, the Teacher reads scripture with divine gui dance and is therefore able to decipher properly the meaning of the ancient proph etic oracles. Moreover, the Teacher is identified in Pesher Habakkuk as the only one who properly understands Habakkuk's words. In this sense, he both carries 87. The precise exegetical basis for this understanding is debated. It is generally agreed that the pesher has ignored the contextual meaning of the biblical root (to run) in favor of an alternate root that could also fit the morphological form of the biblical word. Lou H. Silberman points to the talmudic interpretation of Jeremiah 23:29, in which the verbal root f?D, "crush, shatter," is understood as the interpretation of a text (B. Sanh?drin 31a; "Unriddling the Riddle: A Study in the Structure and Language of the Habakkuk Pesher," Revue de Qumran 3 [1961]: 344^15). He suggests that the root of flT here may be treated as ysr\9 meaning "to crush, shatter," providing a parallel phenomenon to the talmudic interpretation. Silberman's second suggestion is the Aramaic root fin, meaning "to make level," though with the sense of "to interpret" (B. Yevamot llb-12a). See also Brownlee, Midrash Pesher, 111, who proposes the root nxi in the hiph'il, which would mean "to arrange subjects for debate, to discourse." As Brownlee notes, however, this would require the form f rT. 88. This explains the presence of a definite article in NTipn (not in the Masoretic Text). According to the pesher, the biblical verse has in mind one particular reader?the Teacher of Righteousness. 89.

Revealed Wisdom and Prophecy in the Dead Sea Scrolls The Dead Sea Scrolls contain evidence for an additional modified mode of revelation that was viewed by the Qumran community and related segments of Second Temple Judaism as commensurate with prophecy. In this model, the gap between the divine and human realms is bridged by the transmission of knowl edge from God to certain humans?what I term "sapiential revelation."91 The cul tivation of divine wisdom is commonplace in the Hebrew Bible. With some exception, however, this sapiential encounter is never a mark of the biblical proph ets.92 The presence of this revelatory encounter with the divine, however, becomes increasingly important as the standard prophetic revelatory models begin to wane in the Second Temple period.93 Sapiential revelation is removed from its exclusive wisdom context and provided with a new prophetic framework. The receipt of divine knowledge is now conceptualized as a prophetic process and its prac titioners as prophetic figures. In this section, I will first treat the portrait of David as a prophet that appears in the prose addition to the Cave 11 Psalms Scroll. This passage reconfigures the prophetic experience of David by infusing it with sapiential character and equating 90. The prophetic revelatory character of pesher exegesis is observed in varying degrees in scholarly treatments. See Devorah Dimant, "Qumran Sectarian Literature," in Jewish Writings of the Second Temple Period, ed. M. E. Stone (Assen: Van Gorcum; Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1984), 508; John J. Collins, "Prophecy and Fulfillment in the Qumran Scrolls," 303; Shani L. Benin, "Qumran Pesharim," in Biblical Interpretation at Qumran, ed. M. Henze (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerd mans, 2005), 123-26; Nissinen, "Transmitting Divine Mysteries," 528-29. I have not treated here the prophetic context for the third component of revelatory exegesis?the rewriting of the ancient pro phetic word. Like the process of interpretation, rewriting was often conceptualized as a means to appro priate the original prophetic voice and thereby reawaken the ancient divine word and enliven it for the present circumstances. This process, however, is far more prevalent in nonsectarian literature and is therefore not addressed in this article. See further discussion in Jassen, Mediating the Divine, 230 37,353-61. 91. To be sure, there is overlap in the prophetic phenomena of sapiential revelation and revel atory exegesis (e.g., the Teacher's knowledge of the "mysteries" of the prophetic oracles in lQpHab 7:5; cf. 7:8). My treatment seeks to identify and classify the broad framework in which these two pro phetic phenomena appear in the Qumran corpus. For an attempt to outline the merging of the sapiential and exegetical prophetic elements, see Nissinen, "Transmitting Divine Mysteries." 92. Biblical wisdom literature identifies three primary media for the transmission of divine knowledge: (1) teachings from elders, (2) human intellectual activity, and (3) direct divine transmission (though not identified as prophetic). See a full discussion with references and bibliography in Jassen, Mediating the Divine, lAl-A'i. See further my discussion of the fusing of prophetic and sapiential elements in the biblical portrait of Balaam in Numbers 24:4, 16 (ibid., 243-45). 93. This transition is briefly noted in Kugel, How to Read the Bible, 634. See also Nissinen, "Transmitting Divine Mysteries," esp. 527-31. 327</page><page sequence="30">Alex P. Jassen David's receipt of divine wisdom with his prophetic encounter.94 Following my method, I suggest that this passage (and others like it not discussed here) is repre sentative of larger developments in the conceptualization of prophecy and its rev elatory media in the Second Temple period and at Qumran. This treatment serves as a backdrop to the examination of the phenomenon of sapiential revelation among the leadership and members of the Qumran community. For this, I revisit the hymn in column 12 of the Hodayot. Building on my earlier analysis of its prophetic undertones, I discuss the presentation of revealed wisdom in this hymn and its relationship to the larger prophetic claims of the hymn. David and prophecy in the Psalms Scroll Column 27 of the Cave 11 Psalms Scroll contains an otherwise unknown prose narrative listing David's prolific literary output. This brief passage, entitled "David's Compositions" in the editio princeps, identifies prophecy as the inspira tional source for David's vast literary accomplishments:95 (2) And David, the son of Jesse, was wise (D3n), and a light like the light of the sun (W?wn 11X3 TIKI), and literate (iDlo), (3) and discerning (prui) and perfect in all his ways before God and men. And the Lord gave (4) him a discerning and enlightened spirit (rmxi mu rm **\*&lt;&lt;r t&gt; im). And he wrote (5) 3,600 psalms; and songs to sing before the altar over the whole-burnt (6) perpetual offering every day, for all the days of the year, 364; (7) and for the offering of the Sabbath, 52 songs; and for the offering of the New (8) Moons and for all the Solemn Assemblies and for the Day of Atonement, 30 songs. (9) And all the songs that he spoke were 446, and songs (10) for making the music over the stricken, 4. And the total was 4,050. (11) All these he composed through prophecy which was given to him from before the Most High (}vbvn -&gt;2*bn t&gt; iru -iwx nxirm -q-t n^x Vd). Though there is no lack of scholarly bibliography on this passage, less attention has been directed at locating it within the larger framework of prophecy in the Second Temple period. The notice in line 11 that David composed his psalmic oeuvre under prophetic inspiration represents one of several texts from the Second Temple period that highlights David's prophetic capabilities.96 The 94. The overwhelmingly positive portrait of David in the Psalms Scroll must be contrasted with the negative image of David in CD 5:2-3. In the former, David is enlightened with a prophetic spirit. In the latter, he is not even aware of the law. I do not, however, view these two presentations as incompa tible. The Psalms Scroll provides a model for understanding prophecy and wisdom, not David specifi cally Moreover, the Damascus Document is interested in neglect of the law, not in maligning the character of David. Indeed, the epilogue to 4QMMT (4Q398 14-17 ii 1) clearly presents a positive por trait of David and the community actively awaited the arrival of the messianic son of David (e.g., 4Q285). 95.

(Acts 2:30)," Catholic Biblical Quarterly 328</page><page sequence="31">Prophets and Prophecy in the Qumran Community larger passage, however, also contains more precise information regarding the nature of David's prophecy. Much of the language employed in the depiction of David locates him as a paradigmatic sage at home within Israel's wisdom circles. Thus, he is "wise" (D3n), "a light like the light of the sun" (W?wn 11X3 tiki) "literate" (1D1D),97 and "discerning" (TD3). Most importantly, God provided David with "a discerning and enlightened spirit" (miNl mim nn). By virtue of having this discerning and enlightened spirit, David was able to compose the 4,050 psalms and songs as described in the following lines. Based on the text as presented up to here, David is portrayed a sage par excellence.98 Were the text to conclude here, David's literary output would appear to be the direct result of his sapiential acumen. The text, however, continues, adding one additional line that fully contextualizes the portrait of David provided in lines 2-3. After enumerating the full list of psalms composed by David, the text states that "All these he composed through prophecy which was given to him from before the Most High" (Trtyn ^??n t&gt; inn -wx nNirun mi rf?x Vd).99 This passage is intended to form an inclusio with the clause that immediately precedes the list of psalms: miNl mm mi ^*M^r f? im (1. 4). Each claims some divine gift to David using similar language (root "?m). Each identifies the immediate source of inspiration. Line 11 asserts that David composed the psalms with prophetic gui dance. This notice is intended to qualify and be qualified by the description of David as a sage in lines 2-3. This correspondence is reinforced by the apparent wordplay between nxim and mini David's prophetic capabilities as identified in line 11 are the direct result of the sapiential revelation granted to him in line 3.100 34 (1972): 332-39; Reinhold Then, "Gibt es denn keinen mehr unter den Propheten? ": Zum Fortgang der alttestamentlichen Proph?tie in fr?hjudischer Zeit (Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang, 1990), 189? 225; Peter W. Flint, "The Prophet David at Qumran," in Henze, Biblical Interpretation at Qumran, 158-67; Nissinen, "Transmitting Divine Mysteries," 514-15. 2 Chronicles 29:25 could also be under stood as highlighting David's prophetic status (see Jassen, Mediating the Divine, 112-13). 97. I am following Sanders's original translation. This word is more generally understood as a "scribe." The sapiential context is implied by both translations. 98. The sapiential portrait of David is likely part of a larger comparison with Solomon found throughout this passage. Scholars have long noted that the number of David's psalms (4,050) is intended to supersede that of Solomon, who, according to 1 Kings 5:12, composed 3,000 proverbs and 1,005 songs. See Sanders, Psalms Scroll, 92. According to the Greek tradition, however, Solomon actually composed 5,000 songs in addition to the 3,000 proverbs (see LXX on 1 Kings 4:32). 99. I am rendering p3 here as a niph 'al third person, masculine, singular, perfect or participle form {nittan or nitt?n), with 7\Kni as the antecedent subject. Note, however, that that this understanding requires the feminine noun to be the subject of a masculine verb. The most likely explanation for this phenomenon is that it is mistake?either scribal or merely bad grammar. Alternatively, one could vo calize p3 as a pa 'al perfect form {n?tan). This, however, creates another problem because the preposition ^d^? seems to indicate that p^y is the agent of a passive verb. 100. The blending of sapiential and prophetic elements is often glossed over by commentators or missed entirely (see, e.g., Schniedewind, Word of God, 242). See, however, James C. VanderKam, who notes that the psalms "are introduced by words praising David's sublime wisdom and concluded 329</page><page sequence="32">Alex P. Jassen The presentation of David in the Psalms Scroll is one of several Second Temple-period texts that underscore the merger of sapiential and prophetic activity in the Second Temple period. The receipt of wisdom, once the exclusive domain of the sage, emerges as a viable medium for the transmission of divine re velation in a prophetic context. As such, various segments of Second Temple Judaism?including Qumran?viewed the sapiential revelatory experience as a further realization of the ancient prophetic task and therefore a mark of contempor ary prophetic activity. The example of "David's Compositions" further underscores a point I have emphasized several times already. While David is described as receiving prophetic inspiration, he is never identified with the technical designation of "prophet."101 In the previous section, I noted the constant tension between the classification of rev elatory exegesis as a mode of divine revelation and the identification of its prac titioners as prophets. Similarly, sapiential revelation is a new form of divine revelation that gains prominence in the Second Temple period. Its practitioners are identified as inspired individuals who mediate the divine word. Indeed, several classical prophets are identified as recipients of sapiential revelation. At the same time, a clear distinction is present between classical Israelite prophecy and revelation encountered through the receipt of revealed wisdom.102 Sapiential revelation in the Hodayot The reconfiguration of David's prophetic character and its recasting as a sapiential experience indicates that at least some segments of Second Temple Judaism embraced this new model of prophecy. Indeed, several examples can by a line that claims prophetic inspiration for his works...to enhance the status of David in areas? wisdom and prophecy?that were not sufficiently documented or detailed in the biblical portraits of the king" ("Studies on 'David's Compositions' (HQPsa 27:2-11)," Eretz-Israel 26 [1999]: 218*). 101. See, however, Nissinen, "Transmitting Divine Mysteries," 520, who suggests that the use of the preposition 3 with HN133 could "be understood both as the state of being possessed by the spirit or as the quality of being a prophet?which again, ultimately, mean the same thing." The evidence dis cussed in this study, however, indicates that the harmonization of prophetic activity and the technical designation "prophet" is often avoided in the Dead Sea Scrolls and related Second Temple literature (see n. 102 herein). It is also possible that the word commonly rendered as "through prophecy" (?1X1333) would be radically altered if the proposition 3 were deciphered instead as D (a possible suggestion based on the photographs of this manuscript). Following this reading, David would have composed the psalms "like prophecy" (HK1323). See a similar twofold way of understanding Ben Sira's prophetic consciousness as attested by the Greek and Syriac text (Sirach 24:31 with discussion in Jassen, Mediating the Divine, 312-13). The literary alignment of 1 lQPsa 27:2-11 still indicates that David's "prophecy-like" psalms are the direct result of his sapiential revelation. At the same time, this reading moves David's activities further from the classical prophecy of Israel's biblical heritage. 102. Another good example of this feature is Enoch. Throughout 1 Enoch, Enoch and his sapiential revelatory experiences are aligned with Moses, Balaam, and the classical prophets in general. Yet neither 1 Enoch nor related Second Temple literature identify Enoch as a "prophet." Even Jude 14-15, which cites 1 Enoch 1:9 as Enoch's "prophecy," does not introduce Enoch as a prophet. See a full discussion in Jassen, Mediating the Divine, 263-72. 330</page><page sequence="33">Prophets and Prophecy in the Qumran Community be adduced of individuals or social groups that espouse this model. What about the Qumran community? The Dead Sea Scrolls contain a vast corpus of wisdom literature, attesting to the community's intense interest in sapiential matters.104 Did the community likewise embrace the model of sapiential revelation assigned to David and other ancient prophetic figures? Several passages in the Hodayot, as well as a few in the Damascus Document and the Rule of the Community, indicate that the Qumran community envisioned for itself an active role for sapiential revelation. These texts testify to the sectarian belief in the continued occurrence of revelation through the receipt of divine wisdom. Moreover, some of these texts preserve evidence of specific individuals who were the beneficiaries of this sapiential revelation. In this section, I will focus on one par ticular passage in the Hodayot?the same hymn examined earlier in section III.105 The Hodayot are written in a style that accentuates the divine favor bestowed on the hymnist. Much of the presentation of this relationship focuses on the hymnist's acknowledgment that the sum of his understanding of the world emerges from the receipt of divinely revealed wisdom. Indeed, the Hodayot constantly emphasize that all knowledge is divine in origin and that the hymnist is the most common beneficiary of this divine wisdom.106 The ub iquity of divine wisdom in the Hodayot and its relationship to biblical antecedents and other Qumran texts has been observed in Qumran scholarship and has received significant treatment.107 The sapiential context of the Hodayot goes beyond the portrait of wisdom in other related Qumran texts. The Hodayot repeatedly emphasize the revelatory framework of the transmission of divine knowledge.108 The hymnist does more than merely acknowledge the divine origin of this knowledge. Rather, his receipt of divine wisdom is conceptualized as a revelatory experience.109 103.

The first half of the hymn, as discussed earlier, recounts a bitter conflict between the leader of the Qumran community and the sect's opponents. Earlier analysis of the hymn focused on the nature of the opposition between the sect and its enemies. This con flict centered on opposing understandings of the Torah and its application. The enemies of the sect are condemned for attempting to impose their illegitimate interpretation of the Torah. The hymnist contends that the enemies appealed to divine sanction in order to reinforce this program. The portrait of the enemies turning to prophets in order to authorize their legislative activity is balanced in the hymn by the hymnist's own claims to divine revelation. The hymnist repeat edly emphasizes that only he, and not the enemies, enjoys access to the divine and is the only legitimate divine mediator. More precise information concerning the character of the hymnist's rev elation and its relationship to his opponents' claim is provided by many of the struc turing elements of the first half of the hymn, in particular the opening and closing units. These elements identify the sapiential character of the revelatory claims.110 At the beginning of the hymn, the hymnist exclaims, "I seek you (nrwiTTN) and as an enduring dawning, as [perfe]ct light,111 you have revealed yourself to me O1? nriyDin)"112 (1. 6). The root tzm is applied to the activities of the enemies three times in the hymn in order to express their attempts to access divine rev elation (11. 14-16). By employing the same root, the hymnist affirms his own suc cessful revelatory claims. The manner in which the hymnist denounces his opponents throughout the hymn provides some insight into the nature of his own revelation. Throughout, the hymnist condemns the enemies with sapiential language. Thus, according to the hymnist, his enemies are "without knowledge" (nrn X*?n) (1. 7), and the leaders withhold from their followers the "drink of knowledge" (nsn np^ft) (1. II).113 In the face of their flagrant opposition, God's counsel (ronxsn) remains everlasting (1. 13). In particular, the enemies reject the "vision of knowl edge" (nin "pm) (1. 18). Following Delcor, this expression signifies the status of the hymnist as the exclusive beneficiary of revealed wisdom.114 The first half of the hymn closes with the hymnist outlining the nature of his relationship with God. The hymnist returns to the revelatory language with which he began the hymn: "You. . .revealed yourself to me in your strength as perfect light" (mrmtf? nDiran ^ yoim) (1. 23). The hymn concludes with the hymnist's most explicit claim concerning the nature of this revelatory experience. Unlike 110. See, however, Tanzer, "Sages at Qumran," 115, who classifies this hymn as one in which the presence of wisdom is limited. 111. On this translation, see n. 47 herein. 112.

The hymnist affirms that he has been the beneficiary of divinely revealed wisdom, which is represented as a revelatory experience that far surpasses the would-be prophetic character of his opponents. VI. Conclusion Let me now return to where I started with the discussion of prophecy at Qumran. The wide variation in scholarship on this issue is ultimately the result of applying to the Dead Sea Scrolls a foreign set of prophetic rubrics?namely, prophecy as it is understood in the Hebrew Bible. We must address the question by attempting to ascertain how the community conceptualized prophecy and what it considered prophetic. The two approaches I have suggested?analysis of explicit prophetic language and the identification of modified modes of divine mediation?are aimed at identifying prophecy as it was understood by the commu nity. In applying this method, I have argued that prophecy was very much a live phenomenon at Qumran. By moving beyond the terminological obstacles, we can seek to identify and describe prophecy as it was understood and applied. For the Qumran community, as with many segments of Second Temple Judaism, prophecy never ceased. Prophecy as it was known and practiced in former times, however, had indeed come to an end. In its place emerged new prophetic patterns and re velatory models that were identified as continuing the ancient prophetic task and renewing it for the present.116 The recognition of this shift is likely the reason for the absence of the application of explicit prophetic terminology to the "proph etic" figures and activity in the Qumran community. This same phenomenon has 115. Cf. Delcor, Hymnes, 147; and Mansoor, Thanksgiving Hymns, 67. 116. See the similar observations regarding the "end" of prophecy in Kugel, How to Read the Bible, 633-34. Kugel notes that late biblical literature (e.g., Chronicles) generally downplays the importance of prophecy, while simultaneously highlighting other modes of human-divine communi cation. He suggests that this phenomenon should be associated with a growing realization that prophecy was no longer the only way to communicate with God. As Kugel further observes, individuals associ ated with the alternative modes of divine mediation are aligned with the prophetic tradition. Kugel traces this shift in the primacy of prophecy to the emergence of scriptural traditions. Scripture was regarded as the written record of the word of God and its very existence therefore reduced the need for a human intermediary (see also Nissinen, "Transmitting Divine Mysteries," 516-17, 526-27). As Kugel himself indicates, however, this new situation required the presence of an interpreter who is able to decipher the meaning of scripture. The rise of scripture and its interpretation therefore created a new class of divine mediators. Indeed, I have argued above that inspired interpreters of scrip ture in Second Temple Judaism were often regarded as part of the prophetic tradition and their exege tical activity as commensurate with ancient prophetic practice. 333</page><page sequence="36">Alex R Jassen already been identified in several related Second Temple-period texts treated earlier.117 The study of prophecy in postbiblical Judaism?after "The Prophets"?has long been neglected. Much of this neglect is clearly attributable to the long-held schol arly assumption that prophecy ended in the early Second Temple period. The ancient canonical creation of a distinct corpus of "Prophets" and the chronological frame work it engendered among modem scholars further contributed to the disinterest in studying prophecy outside of this canonical category.118 As noted at the beginning of this article, this trend is shifting.119 The present article has attempted to remedy the scholarly lacuna specifically with regard to the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Qumran community. At the same time, I have attempted to lay out some methodo logical rubrics for the further study of prophecy in postbiblical Judaism. While scho larship has begun to consider very seriously the pervasiveness of prophecy in Second Temple Judaism, very little attention has been directed to later forms of Judaism.120 In many respects, this is conditioned by the canonical creation of a defined chronologi cal timeframe for prophecy, the explicit statements in rabbinic literature that prophecy had long since ceased, and the pervasiveness of terminological difficulties in address ing prophetic continuity in later Jewish texts.121 It is my hope that some of the meth odological rubrics and models employed here in the analysis of the Dead Sea Scrolls can be further cultivated in the study of later forms of Judaism and thereby provide a fuller picture of the history of prophecy in Judaism.

The avoidance of explicit prophetic terminology may also be related to the growing distrust and suspicion regarding prophets and their revelatory claims that emerged in the early Second Temple period and was also present in varying degrees in the late Second Temple period. On the early period, see Petersen, Late Israelite Prophecy, 27-38, esp. 37-38). On the later period, see Meyer, "Prophecy and Prophets," 6:812-13; Blenkinsopp, "Prophecy and Priesthood," 259-60; Aune, Prophecy in Early Christianity and the Ancient Mediterranean World, 127-28, 137-38. 118. The Wellhausian model of the prophetic spirit as the apex of ancient Israelite culture and religion and its disappearance and replacement in postbiblical Judaism with the law further contributed to this scholarly disinterest. Indeed, this model assumes that the ancient prophetic spirit only reemerges with Christianity. Thus, from Malachi to Matthew, prophecy is dormant. 119.
