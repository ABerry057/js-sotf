Albany: State University of New York Press, 1995. 213 pp. For those of us, and there are many, who are serious readers of the twentieth-century Jewish theologian and scholar Abraham Joshua Heschel, the appearance of a new study of his thought will always arouse interest and anticipation. This is largely because Heschel's theological writings are often so poetic and subtle that any help in elucidating and unpacking his opaque discourse would be immediately received as a blessing. In the present study by Edward K. Kaplan, Holiness in Words, we are privy to a unique and often illuminating presentation of Heschel's thought from a fresh perspective. Most of the previous studies on Heschel were composed either by Jewish Studies specialists or by Protestant theologians. Kaplan, a professor of French literature and translator of Baudelaire's poetry, has a command of literary theory and analysis that makes his presentation both original and helpful. Kaplan does not hide his love for the author he is presenting. His unabashed honesty about considering himself a disciple of Heschel, having studied with him while a student at Columbia University in New York, is both admirable and courageous for an academician. This reverence adds unusual passion to his discourse but sometimes results in an overly cautious attitude about critically evaluating Heschel's writings. The subtle Rebbe-disciple relationship felt throughout this study has both positive and negative results. A fair evaluation of any serious piece of scholarship must begin with fair expectations. If readers of Kaplan's essay expect scrupulous analysis of Heschel's sources, wide knowledge of his cultural background both in Poland and Germany, or a profound understanding of the philosophical underpinnings of his theology, they will be disappointed. Although Kaplan is in the final stages of completing a thorough biography of Heschel to be published by Yale University Press, this is not what he sets out to accomplish in this book. What he does intend to accomplish, and what he succeeds in contributing, is a careful reading of Heschel's theology, paying close attention to the nature and nuance of his narrative in order to clarify crucial ambiguities in Heschel's major English-language studies. Kaplan's underlying assumption is that the passage of entry into He- schel's theological narrative necessitates familiarity with his complex maze of language. Sections like "How to Read Heschel" (p. 20) make extremely helpful suggestions as to how one could approach a modem theological text buried in calculated ambiguity. Kaplan states that "from the very beginning,</page><page sequence="2">142 BOOK REVIEWS Heschel was a committed writer. Words become his most effective weapon against hostile political and cultural forces" (p. 8). Susannah Heschel reiterates Kaplan's claim by noting that her father, using kabbalistic parlance, often told her that "words create worlds."' When Kaplan astutely notes that Heschel's discourse "conducts insight, as would an electric wire" (p. 21), he is setting an agenda for himself which other readers of Heschel have surely recognized but may not have had the literary skills to implement. As to the critical claim that Heschel is "just a poet," Kaplan responds that "Heschel's metaphors enrich the content of his discourse by evoking analogies that speak simultaneously to imagination, senses, and judgment" (p. 24). For Kaplan, Heschel must be read the way Heschel read the Bible. "The words of the Bible are sources of spirit. They carry fire to the soul and evoke our lost dignity out of our hidden origins. Illumined, we suddenly remember, we suddenly recover the strength of endless longing to sense eternity in time."2 Kaplan thus reads Heschel as a sacred text. Its sacredness lies not in its infinite meaning but in its infinite ability to inspire its reader. Yet even after Kaplan's literary analysis, which almost always helps us, we are finally left with the necessary ambiguity that Heschel may have intended. If so, the critical echoes of Heschel as "only a poet" again begin to chime in. Kaplan is aware of this and responds in true Heschelean fashion. "Heschel's discourse can be poetically seductive, but he recognizes finally that darkness can be overcome only by demolishing intellectual arrogance" (p. 142). We would have all benefited if Kaplan had developed this methodological statement further rather than leaving the reader wondering whether this is the voice of the "sacred text" or of its interpreter. I am convinced that Kaplan was working on a far more sophisticated level than he lets on. Perhaps he too gets seduced by the misty spell of Heschelean ambiguity, even in his attempt to unpack it. Heschel himself informed his readers of the power of language, usually focusing on the poetics of prayer. Kaplan takes him at his word and subjects Heschel's theological discourse to the same scrutiny that Heschel used to decipher classical Jewish literature. For Kaplan, Heschel's theological writings gain entry into the sacred canon of interpretation. He introduces us to his method of literary analysis by analyzing Heschel's own linguistic technique as it emerged in his study of prayer and the biblical narrative. For example, Kaplan tells us that, for 1. Moral Grandeur and Spiritual Audacity (New York, 1996), p. viii. 2. From God in Search of Man (New York, 1955), p. 253, quoted by Kaplan, p. 147.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 143 Heschel, "the Bible is holiness in words [his emphasis]."3 He then interprets this to mean that "language as hyphen between human and divine implies a formal connection between the two. An intuition of God's presence fills that contact" (p. 55). This sensitive poetic interpretation of Heschel's understand- ing of the Bible as poetry finally does not make either the Bible or Heschel any more accessible. In numerous instances in this book, Heschel's ambiguity is perpetuated rather than explicated. While Kaplan is often successful in his endeavor to unlock dimensions of Heschel's poetics and thereby present his discourse in a more reader-friendly manner, his reading sometimes falls short-intentionally or not--of full disclosure. Perhaps following Heschel's lead in his reading of the liturgy and the Bible, Kaplan as the interpreter of Heschel is intent on leaving dimensions of his text concealed so as not to destroy the poetic dimension which is the essence of its sacredness. Although I admire the interpreter who ensures that his reading never reveals so much as to profane the text, I was sometimes left unfulfilled, believing that Kaplan could have accomplished more. The next underlying theme in Kaplan's study is the attempt to view Heschel's theological writings within the context of his biography. This is an important issue for numerous reasons. First and foremost is the unique life that Heschel lived. Spending his early childhood in the prewar Hasidic court of Novominsk, a suburb of Warsaw (his mother's twin brother Rabbi Alter Israel Shimon Perlow [1874-1933] was the Grand Rabbi of Novominsk), he left Warsaw as a teenager to join the Jewish literary circles in Vilna. Following the wave of Eastern European Jewish migration from Poland to Germany after the First World War, he received rabbinical ordination and a doctorate while in Berlin. Barely escaping the Nazis, he spent a short time in England before emigrating to America. Continuing to write in Yiddish and German (as well as in English) decades after settling in America, Heschel was perhaps the prototypical "transition figure," having absorbed American culture yet remaining bound intellectually and spiritually to his roots in Hasidic Warsaw and interbellum Germany. Kaplan weaves Heschel's startling biography in order to present Heschel as a "prophetic missionary" for twentieth-century American Jewry. He is presented as spokesperson for a unique blend of a pious Judaism of faith coupled with the intellectual tolerance of pluralism, equally critical of the laxity in observance among liberal Jews and the dogmatic rigidity of Jewish fundamentalism. Having grown up in Hasidic Warsaw and 3. God in Search of Man, p. 244, cited in Kaplan, p. 2.</page><page sequence="4">144 BOOK REVIEWS educated at the liberal seminary in Berlin, Kaplan argues by implication, Heschel understood both communities intimately and thus could serve as the prophetic voice of inspiration for both worlds. Although this claim indeed has some validity and should not be over- looked, I believe that Kaplan overstates his case and ignores some very pertinent questions. His implicit comparison of Heschel to Maimonides is overblown, even though he is correct that Heschel's early biography of Maimonides (first published as Maimonides: Eine Biographie, 1935) is at least nominally intended as autobiography (p. 137). To present Heschel as the prophet of twentieth-century American Jewry is, in my view unsubstantiated, and diverts attention away from the profound contribution he did make to twentieth-century American Judaism. Maimonides was, of course, a monu- mental figure whose influence reached and affected every corner of medieval and modern Jewry. For reasons unknown to me, Heschel's influence was far more limited. It is curious, for example, that a recent article by the Israeli scholar Eliezer Schweid, entitled "Prophetic Mysticism in 20th Century Jewish Thought,"4 ignores Heschel completely! The relevant question which Kaplan never addresses is, "Which communities, if any, were profoundly influenced by Heschel's thinking?" Although many individuals spanning the spectrum of American Jewry (and Protestant Christianity) were inspired by Heschel, moved by his inspirational words and ideas of a thoroughly modem Judaism that rubs against the grain of modernity, his influence has sadly not been as profound as Kaplan implies, especially during his lifetime. The Hasidic world in which he was reared (and with which he remained in close contact throughout his life) had little interest in his writings. His work has not yet become the subject of sustained in-depth analysis in the scholarly world, as have the works of Hermann Cohen, Franz Rosenzweig, and Martin Buber. His "mystical piety" never perked the attention of Gershom Scholem or other scholars of Jewish mysticism. His ideology never initiated a movement, as did that of his onetime colleague at the Jewish Theological Seminary, Mordecai Kaplan. Finally (and perhaps most curiously), his major works never had a serious impact on Israeli religious or scholarly society. These are important points to address if one wants to present Heschel the way in which he is presented by Kaplan. On this particular issue I think that Kaplan's deep devotion to his master, a devotion which we all can envy, has blurred his otherwise keen scholarly vision. 4. Modern Judaism 14 (1994): 139-174.</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 145 Perhaps the most ingenious contribution of this study is its convincing claim that the conspicuous absence of the Holocaust in Heschel's writings is really an illusion. Kaplan shows again and again that while Heschel did not devote any single study to the Holocaust, this event is the subtext of all of his theological writings, from his early Man Is Not Alone (1951) to his final essay Who Is Man? (1965). Kaplan states, "Now he did not place in the Shoah-our century's major catastrophe-a source of Jewish energy, as did most post-war thinkers. Heschel's theology represents a passionate alternative to Judaism redefined by the Holocaust and the State of Israel. It implies that Jewish survival does not require us to see ourselves, even triumphally, as victims" (p. 10). Heschel's premeditated silence is brilliantly presented by Kaplan in various places, including a section aptly called "No Holocaust Theology" (pp. 129-131). As a maestro of language, Heschel knew how to use silence as a powerful communicative tool. Kaplan, among his closest readers, makes us aware of the message of this silence. He argues that the lacuna in Heschel's discourse about the Holocaust is calculated to avoid the trap of a theology of victimization. In this sense, while Heschel was definitely not a Holocaust theologian, he may have been the prototypic post-Holocaust theologian. In a particularly acute way he felt the constant personal and collective pain of the Shoah but refused to allow that pain to prevent him from continuing to look ahead toward the future. Silence sometimes communicates more than words. Another possible component in Heschel's calculated silence that Kaplan does not address is the factor of guilt. Heschel returned to Warsaw after his initial stay in Germany and remained there until right before the war. He was able to narrowly escape the fate of European Jewry but left behind his mother, his sister, and the remainder of his immediate family. It is hard to imagine that surviving in the shadow of loved ones who perished would not illicit feelings of guilt. Studies of those who narrowly escape disaster often find the guilt of survival as a strong impulse in the survivor personality. Heschel's narrow escape, which he described as being "plucked from the embers," coupled with his highly sensitive and passionate personality and his love for the romantic piety of Eastern European Jewry would suggest, in my view, that the "guilt of survival" played a substantive role in his silence. Be that as it may, after reading Kaplan's convincing analysis of this issue we all can benefit from a rereading of Heschel's major theological writings. As I stated at the outset, one should read Kaplan's essay with fair expectations. The definitive study of Heschel's entire oeuvre remains to be written, if indeed it can be written. Kaplan's contribution has made that</page><page sequence="6">146 BOOK REVIEWS possibility all the more realistic. He has simultaneously given us essential keys to unlock the poetics of Heschel and the necessary warnings against overreading and de facto desanctifying Heschel's poetics. Kaplan walks the fine line between fire and ice, between critical scholar and disciple. This is a daunting task that deserves both our praise and our respect.
