According to scholarly consensus these longer narratives in the Bavli were formulated more or less while the Bavli as a whole was being redacted and, as Jeffrey Rubenstein has argued, reflect later Babylonian rabbinic culture.1 Regarding the building blocks of these stories, literary analysis at times indicates that what the historian once believed to be primitive exaggeration is in fact the earliest element of the story. With this in mind, Shamma Friedman coined the term "literary kernel" to replace the former "historical kernel."2 The advantage of the term "literary kernel" is that it can be defined in a fairly objective way as the common storyline A preliminary version of this article was presented as a paper at the 42nd Annual Conference of the Association of Jewish Studies in Boston (December 2010). I would like to thank Professor Jeffrey Rubenstein for his comments on an earlier version of this paper. 1. See Jeffrey Rubenstein, Talmudic Stories: Narrative Art, Composition, and Culture (Balti more: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999), 3-33; Rubenstein, The Culture of the Babylonian Talmud (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003), 2-13; and, most recently, Rubenstein, Stories of the Babylonian Talmud (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010), 7-19. Richard Kalmin has registered a different opinion, arguing: "The anonymous editors of the Talmud are very unlikely candidates for authorship of the Talmud's brilliantly artistic, dramatically gripping, and ethi cally and theologically ambiguous narratives" (Steven T. Katz, ed., The Cambridge History of Judaism [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006], 4:846). The most recent assessment of Rubenstein's contribution can be found in Isaiah Gafni's review of his three books on rabbinic stories: "Rethinking Talmudic History: The Challenge of Literary and Redaction Criticism," Jewish History 25, nos. 3-4 (2011): 355-75. 2. See Shamma Friedman, "La 'aggadah ha-historit ba-talmud ha-bavli," in Saul Lieberman Memorial Volume, ed. Shamma Friedman, New York and Jerusalem: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1993), 119-64. According to Friedman, only the material identified as the "literary kernel" of the story can be used to reconstruct historical data. More importantly, that identification can be used to dismiss elements in the story that are not part of the literary kernel and are therefore secondary and clearly nonhistorical (122).

When a clear Palestinian literary parallel for a Babylonian story exists, its value for understanding how the story was composed and adapted in Babylonia is unquestionable. But what about stories without Palestinian parallels? What methods can be used to understand how a story in the Bavli was created and to date it? While turning to non-Jewish sources is certainly a productive direction, they offer some inherent problems: it is rarely possible to find clear sources in the surrounding cultures; these stories are themselves not always easy to date; and elements from outside sources may be later additions rather than the kernel of the story. In the present study, dedicated to a fascinating narrative in B. Hullin 11 Oa- b featuring an enigmatic second-generation Babylonian Amora named Rami bar Dikulei, I would like to turn inward, to halakhic sources within the Bavli itself, and demonstrate how we can use these sources to date a talmudic narrative and show exactly how the storyteller went about creating it. Unlike aggadic traditions, halakhic sources were carefully preserved and transmitted. Though textual var iants do of course exist in both halakhah and aggadah, there are far fewer var iants—in both content and attributions—in halakhic statements than in aggadic passages. Because halakhic memrot are usually preserved almost word for word, halakhic sources can be of great value for dating narratives when we can prove that the storyteller used them. Our narrative is found in the midst of a discussion on the kashrut of the cow udder in B. Hullin 1 lOa-b; it has no clear parallel in Palestinian sources, and no strikingly similar story exists in Babylonian sources. Mishnah Hullin 8:3 rules that in order to to be eaten, an udder should be cut open and emptied: Concerning the udder pnsn], one tears it open prior to its preparation and extracts its milk. If he did not tear it open but rather prepared it as is, he does not transgress on account of it. The adjacent sugya (B. Hullin 109b) goes on to discuss how the udder is torn open: How does one tear it [the udder] open? Rav Yehudah says, "He tears it vertically and horizontally and presses it 3. Even when a Palestinian parallel is found, we do not always have clear criteria for dating the story—we can only surmise that the Palestinian source has some relationship to it, and usually the Palestinian source is thought to represent the earlier form of the tradition, making it easier to see which elements were added later. On the tendency in scholarship to regard the Palestinian story as orig inal, see Joshua Efron, Studies in the Hasmonean Period (Leiden: Brill, 1987), 145-47; Friedman, "Historical Aggadah," 121 n. 6; Rubenstein, Talmudic Stories, 25-26; Catherine Hezser, Form, Func tion, and Historical Significance of the Rabbinic Story in Yerushalmi Neziqin, Texte und Studien zum antiken Judentum 37 (Tubingen: Mohr, 1993), 349-57. However, this is not always the case; see Moshe Benovitz, Perek shevuot shetaim batra, Bavli Shevuot perek shelishi (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 2003), 456-61. 188</page><page sequence="3">The "Halakhic Kernel" as a Criterion for Dating Babylonian Aggadah against the wall." Rabbi Elazar said to his servant, "Tear for me [the udder], and I shall eat it." The editor of the sugya infers from Rabbi Elazar's command to his servant that he believes it is enough to tear open the udder in one direction and there is no need to press it against the wall. It is in the context of Rav Yehudah's ruling that our story appears: Introduction Amoraic tradition about diver ging customs Part 1 Rami's "sin" Part 2A Arrest and first line of question ing, regarding "sin" itself Part 2B Further questioning regarding "sin" itself Part 2C Final question regarding "sin" itself In Sura the udder was forbidden for con sumption; in Pumbedita it was permitted. Rami the son of Tamarei, also known as Rami the son of Dikulei of Pumbedita, visited the city of Sura on the eve of Yom Kippur. Everyone [in the city] took all the udders [of the animals] and threw them away; he [Rami] immediately went and collected them and ate them. He was then brought before Rav Hisda, and they bound him. He [Rav Hisda] said to him, "Why did you do it?" He [Rami] replied, "I come from the place of Rav Yehudah, who permits it [the udder] to be eaten." He said to him, "But do you not accept the rule: we impose upon him the stringen cies of the place that he came from and the stringencies of the place he has arrived at?" He replied, "I ate them outside the [city's] boundary." "And with what did you roast them?" He [Rami] replied: "With grape pits." "Perhaps they were grape pits of wine used for idolatrous purposes!" He [Rami] replied: "They had been lying there more than twelve months." "Perhaps they were stolen goods!" He [Rami] replied: "The owners must have certainly abandoned all rights to them for sprouts were growing on them." 189</page><page sequence="4">Aaron Amit Part 3A Second line of questioning: Rami's attire Part 3B Further questioning regarding attire Part 4A The tables are turned Part 4B Rav Hisda's surrender He [Rav Hisda] noticed that he [Rami] was not wearing teflllin. He said to him, "Why are you not wearing tefillin?" He replied, "I am suffering from a stomach ailment, and Rav Yehudah said: One who suffers from a stomach ailment is exempt from wearing tefillin." He [Rav Hisda] saw that he was not wearing fringes [i.e., tzitzit]. He [Rav Hisda] said, "Why are you not wearing fringes?" He [Rami] replied, "I am wearing a bor rowed garment, and Rav Yehudah said a borrowed garment is, for the first thirty days, exempt from the tzitzit." While this was going on, they brought [to the court] a man who had not honored his father and mother. They bound him [in order to administer lashes]. He [Rami] said to them, "Leave him alone! For it has been taught: Every positive commandment that has its reward [men tioned] together with it does not fall within the jurisdiction of the human court." He [Rav Hisda] said to him, "I see that you are very sharp!" He replied, "If only you would come to Rav Yehudah's school, I would show you true sharpness!" (emphasis mine) Reading the story as a whole, one is immediately struck by the narrator's anti-Suran tone. The poor rabbinic scholar from Pumbedita is being neglected by the people of Sura—not only do they refrain from inviting him to dine on Erev Yom Kippur,4 but they leave him to dig in the garbage, and he is forced to 4. This motif is reminiscent of the story of Polemo (in B. Kiddushin Bla-b), who was shamed into inviting Satan to dine on Erev Yom Kippur. While there is no evidence of a direct relationship between the stories, that story makes clear to the contemporary reader just how objectionable a lack of hospitality on Erev Yom Kippur was considered to be. While one could argue that the story contains no internal proof concerning the behavior of "the people" of Sura, the fact that it contrasts "everyone [in the city]," who are careful to throw the udders away, with Rami, who "immediately went and collected them and ate them," is surely meant to reflect poorly on the people of the city. The collective (Ktirs 'Vd) 190</page><page sequence="5">The "Halakhic Kernel" as a Criterion for Dating Babylonian Aggadah eat his se 'udah mafseket (pre-fast meal) outside the city. Adding insult to injury, they put him on trial, and he barely escapes lashing by displaying his sound legal reasoning, which puts Rav Hisda, Sura's greatest sage, to shame.5 The setting of the story on Erev Yom Kippur—a day that is supposed to be dedicated to reconciliation with those wronged—serves as a further indictment of the com munity in Sura.6 Sura is a place concerned with the rule of law, but the people of Sura ignore the pain and poverty of a fellow Jew.7 The four-part story is introduced and is to a large extent inspired by an amoraic tradition that in Sura they did not eat the udder, while in Pumbedita they did. Following the statement of this tradition is the introduction of the Pum beditan sage Rami bar Tamarei or Dikulei, a man with two names, who is said to have arrived in Sura on the eve of Yom Kippur. Rami violates Suran custom by collecting and eating the discarded udders. The next two sections of the story (parts 2 and 3) go on to describe how Rami bar Dikulei was arrested and ques tioned about his violation of Suran practice and subsequently challenged about his personal observance of the commandments. Rami is brought to the beit din of Rav Hisda, where he is tied up.8 The first part of the questioning (part 2) can be divided into three parts (marked A-C). First, Rav Hisda challenges Rami by quoting M. Pesahim 4:1: "A person who travels from a place of legal leniency of Sura is scrupulous about getting rid of the udders but not about the commandment of receiving guests, even on the eve of Yom Kippur. 5. See Richard Kalmin, "Talmudic Portrayals of Relationships between Rabbis: Amoraic or Pseudepigraphic?" AJS Review 17 (1992): 165-97. Kalmin theorized that this story "in which a student of Yehudah, Rami bar Tamari, demonstrates Hisda's inferiority to Yehudah, might be an effec tive means by which late Pumbeditan storytellers propagandize in favor of their city and attack contem porary Suran foes" (172-73). 6. See M. Yoma 8:9; SrSaAharei Mot 5:8 (ed. Weiss, p. 83a-b); B. Yoma 87a-b; and B. Eruvin 54a (similar to B. Nedarim 55a). B. Yoma 87a describes how Rav went to appease a butcher on Erev Yom Kippur, and how the butcher's refusal to forgive Rav resulted in the butcher's premature death. 7. In his recent book, Socrates and the Fat Rabbis (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009), Daniel Boyarin argues for the influence of what he terms "Menippean satire" on the Bavli. Boyarin defines Menippean satire as "a kind of spoofing in which the heroes of an intellectual commu nity are the spoofed heroes, at least in formal part via a yoking together of the serious and comical genres into single texts that observe no generic decorum, as was recognized already in antiquity. Since the force of this genre is to call into question the very seriousness and authority of the practice of the intellectuals themselves, this is also, I argue, an important avenue for understanding talmudic ideology" (26). Boyarin does not mention our story as an example of "Menippean satire"; however, using his model, one might be tempted to argue that Rav Hisda is comically "spoofed" by the udder eating Rami bar Tamari. While I agree that Rav Hisda is indeed "spoofed," I do not think it has anything to do with Menippean satire. It is more along the traditional lines of satire defined by Boyarin in the same context as "that which makes fan of a literary tradition or sociocultural formation." In this case the author from Pumbedita criticizes the leaders of Sura (see below). For a detailed critique of Boy arin's thesis, see Reuven Kiperwasser, "Daniel Boyarin: Socrates and the Fat Rabbis," Jewish History 25, nos. 3^1 (2011): 377-97. 8. This is in accordance with MSS Hamburg 169, Vatican 121, Vatican 122, and Munich 95. In the printed editions the word kaftei/kaftuhu does not appear. This was likely an apologetic deletion based on sensitivity to the criticism of Rav Hisda in our story. 191</page><page sequence="6">Aaron Amit to a place of legal stringency is obligated to accept the stringencies of the place [where] he has arrived"—in this case the stringencies of Sura. Rami answers Rav Hisda that he ate the udders outside the city limits. Rav Hisda then challenges Rami on the method he used to fuel the fire for roasting the udders (2B). Rami answers that he used grape pits—-'EniD—a rather unusual word in rabbinic litera ture.9 Rav Hisda objects on the basis of the laws of idolatrous wine. Rami answers that the grape pits were over twelve months old and therefore free from any con nection to idolatrous wine. Rav Hisda then challenges Rami by arguing that perhaps the grape pits belonged to someone and therefore were stolen property. Rami answers that the owners surely had abandoned their rights to the pits since sprouts were growing on them. Failing to convict Rami in his first line of questioning, Rav Hisda moves on to attack Rami's personal performance of the commandments (part 3). First he asks him why he is not wearing tefillin.10 Rami responds with the words of his teacher, Rav Yehudah: "One who suffers from a stomach ailment is exempt from wearing tefillin." This humorous answer is surely intentional on the part of the story teller—after collecting food from the garbage and roasting it with sprout-ridden grape pits, no wonder he is having some digestive issues! Rav Hisda then attacks Rami for not wearing tzitzit. Rami again responds by quoting his teacher, Rav Yehudah, who states that a borrowed garment is exempt from tzitzit for thirty days. After failing to find any reason to administer lashes to the poor Pumbeditan disciple of Rav Yehudah, the story moves into its final section (part 4). A new pris oner is brought11 to the beit din of Rav Hisda who is accused of not fulfilling the commandment of honoring his parents. Rami demands that they free the prisoner, quoting a tannaitic source according to which an earthly beit din has no authority to punish a person for not honoring his or her parents. The story closes with Rav Hisda praising Rami for his legal acumen and Rami answering him that it is nothing com pared to that of his teacher, Rav Yehudah. Interestingly the praise for Rami and his teacher is couched in the language of "place" (atra). When he is first attacked, Rami defends himself by saying that he comes from the place (atra) of Rav Yehudah, and in the end Rami claims that if Rav Hisda would come to the place of Rav Yehudah he would see pure brilliance. This emphasis on place by our story teller shows his agenda—he seeks to show the superiority of Pumbedita over Sura. 9. The word appears in three sugvot in the Bavli: Berakhot 38a, Pesahim 42b, and Avodah Zarah 34b. See Michael Sokoloff, A Dictionary of Jewish Babylonian Aramaic (Ramat Gan and Balti more: Bar-llan University Press and Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002), 893, who defines it as: "stone or kernel of fruit (esp. grapes [..In Syriac Rrans is defined by J. Payne Smith as "a grape stone, pomegranate seed; a raisin" (A Compendious Syriac Dictionary [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1903], 464). For a discussion of the meaning of the word, see Moshe Benovitz, Talmud ha-'Igud, Berakhot VI, Sugya 16, n. 14 [forthcoming]. 10. In MSS Hamburg 169 and Vatican 121 the order is switched; Rav Hisda first queries Rami about his lack of tzitzit, then about his lack of tefillin. For a discussion of this change in order, see below. 11. Here we have another hint about the collective of Sura. They—the people of Sura—bring in (mn"N) another prisoner and thereby show their partnership and agreement with Rav Hisda in the search for additional "transgressors." 192</page><page sequence="7">The "Halakhic Kernel" as a Criterion for Dating Babylonian Aggadah An approximate date for this narrative can be proposed on the basis of the numerous legal sources that lie behind its formulation, beginning with the legal source that is the point of departure for the story: "In Sura the udder was forbidden for consumption; in Pumbedita it was permitted." The formulation here is similar to a number of traditions in the Bavli that contrast Pumbeditan halakhah with that of Sura.12 Moreover, in quite a few sugyot in the Bavli we find divergent traditions of Sura and Pumbedita taught with the terminology "In Sura they teach thus, and in Pumbedita they teach thus."13 The fact that references to this style of teaching are found in other anonymous amoraic sources implies that this tradition stems from the later generations of the Amoraim when the two centers of learning were well established. It makes less sense that this tradition was in existence at the time of Rav Yehudah and Rav Hisda, since at that time the two centers of learn ing were in their early stages of development. Even according to Isaiah Gafni, who argues for the existence of the yeshiva in amoraic times in Babylonia,14 Sura and Pumbedita could hardly be considered "centers" at this time—and it would have made little sense for someone to contrast their divergent customs and teachings.15 Indeed it would seem that part of our storyteller's agenda is to denigrate the back ground, knowledge, and observance of the people of Sura. Just before our story, in the same passage (B. Hullin 110a), there is a story about the Amora Rav. Arriving in Tatlafush (which seems to be close to Sura), he "found an open space and erected a [metaphorical] fence around it" and then witnessed a woman asking her neighbor, "How much milk is required to cook a riba of meat?" Concerned about the halakhic observance of such ignorant persons Rav declared the udder forbidden for consumption in the area of Sura. This story of Rav in Tatlafush suggests that the stringent custom of Sura, of which its people are so proud in our story, is actually overcompensation for ignorance. Our storyteller clearly had a low opinion of this Suran custom and set out to show Pumbedita's superiority in legal reasoning. To do so, he used literary legal 12. See B. Pesahim 117b and B. Ketubot 55a (in the latter source the distinction is between Pumbedita and Mata Mehasya, which bordered Sura). For a brief discussion of the talmudic evidence of divergent customs in Sura and Pumbedita and a wider discussion of the differences in customs between the two centers in the geonic period, see Simhah Asaf, Tekufat ha-ge'onim ve-sifrutah (Jeru salem, Mosad Harav Kook, 1967), 261-78; Victor Aptowitzer, Sefer ha-Ra 'aviah vol. 3, Hosafotve'Ti kunim (Jerusalem, Harry Fischel Institute, 1964), 743. Contrast Robert Brady's critique of Asaf's conclusions, The Geonim of Babylonia and the Shaping of Medieval Jewish Culture (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1998), 149. 13. See, e.g., B. Megillah 18b, B. Bava Batra 142b, B. Bava Batra 152b, B. Avodah Zarah 38a, B. Avodah Zarah 75a, B. Hu'lin 37b, and B. Bekhorot 36b. 14. See Isaiah Gaftii. "Yeshivah u-metivta," Zion 43 (1978): 12-37. In Gafni's discussion of the pirka (a public discourse combining the study of halakhah and aggadah) he demonstrates that the term is used by third-generation Amoraim and onward (Yehudei Bavel be-tekufat ha-Talmud [Jerusalem: Zalman Shazar Center for Jewish History, 1990], 210-11). 15. This is certainly the case for David Goodblatt (Rabbinic Instruction in Sasanian Babylonia [Leiden: Brill, 1975]), who sees the academies as the product of the geonic period. For a discussion of their theories, see Jeffrey Rubenstein, "The Rise of the Babylonian Rabbinic Academy: A Reexamina tion of the Talmudic Evidence," Jewish Studies Internet Journal 1 (2002): 55-68. 193</page><page sequence="8">Aaron Amit sources from other parts of the Bavli, which will be delineated below. Determining the relationship between these legal sources and our narrative, establishes a termi nus post quem no earlier than the fifth generation of the Amoraim and closer to the time of the sugya's editor. As argued above, the backbone of the story comes from the amoraic tradition about the divergent customs of Sura and Pumbedita. The author wanted to create a narrative in which a Pumbeditan sage violated Suran law and then defended himself brilliantly. The first question to tackle is why the author chose the figures Rami bar Dikulei, Rav Hisda, and Rav Yehudah. The answer can be found in two literary sources.16 First, B. Sanhedrin 17b contains a developed list of the dominant sages of the various rabbinic centers, for example, "Our teachers in Babylonia—Rav and Shmuel; our teachers in the Land of Israel—Rabbi Abba." The text then reads: The elders of Sura—Rav Huna and Rav Hisda; the elders of Pumbedita— Rav Yehudah and Rav Eina; the brilliant ones of Pumbedita—Eifa and Avimi, the sons of Rahava. (emphasis mine) Note that the parallel structure used to speak of "our teachers" and of "the elders" does not repeat itself with regard to the brilliant sages (harifei), who are mentioned only with regard to Pumbedita and not Sura.17 Our storyteller most likely was influenced by this source in choosing to concentrate on Rav Hisda and Rav Yehudah, the leaders of Sura and Pumbedita respectively, mentioned side by side in this list.18 An additional reason for choosing Rav Yehudah is that, as men tioned above, he is the same sage who gives detailed instructions for preparing the udder for consumption in the same sugya in Bavli Hullin, ruling that it should be torn vertically and horizontally and pressed against the wall. However, instead of describing a direct conflict between Rav Hisda and Rav Yehudah, the storyteller chooses to strengthen the argument for Pumbeditan dominance by having an obscure Pumbeditan student represent his teacher. The sage "Rami bar Tamarei also known as Rami bar Dikulei" with both names given,19 appears in only one other source in the Bavli—an instructive story in B. Menahot 29b: ] 6. I use the term "literary sources" to mean redacted sources (either in oral or written form) that were at the disposal of our storyteller at the time of the story's creation. As we shall see below, the storyteller copied and molded redacted sources in order to create this story. 17. Two traditions are attributed in the Bavli to the brilliant ones of Pumbedita: B. Kiddushin 39a and B. Menahot 17a. In B. Berakhot 59b the sages of Mehoza are described as being "sharp" due to their consumption of the water of the Tigris River. 18. Moreover, in the next line of B. Sanhedrin 17b the term harifei (brilliant ones) appears again. The idea of brilliance is central to our story. One might ask: if this is so, why did the author of our story not use one of the "brilliant ones," Eifa or Avimi, as the central character in the story in place of Rami? The answer to this question is clear: by using the little-known Rami, our storyteller demonstrates how even the most insignificant student of Rav Yehudah was imbued with his Torah and could defeat the greatest sage of Sura. 19. In B. Yevamot 80a there is a statement attributed to "Rami bar Dikulei in the name of Shmuel." None of the textual witnesses in B. Yevamot 80a add the name Rami bar Tamarei. Nonethe less, it is likely that this refers to the same sage and that the uncertainty (second tradition) regarding his 194</page><page sequence="9">The "Halakhic Kernel" as a Criterion for Dating Babylonian Aggadah Rami bar Tamarei, also known as Rami bar Dikulei,20 [found that] the vav in the word va-yaharog21 was perforated. He came to Rabbi Zeira, who said, "Go, bring a child that is neither too clever nor too foolish; if he reads the vav of va-yaharog, it is valid; otherwise the word is yaharog, and it is invalid." In this short halakhic story the figure who queries Rabbi Zeira is so obscure that we are uncertain of the name of his father—it could be Tamarei or it could be Dikulei—with both names obviously coming from the realm of the date and palm trade. Moreover, it is safe to assume that Rami is imagined as being poor since he cannot even afford a parchment for his tefdlin that does not have a hole in it! Therefore, the figure of Rami served the purposes of our storyteller for three reasons: first, he is connected to Rabbi Zeira, who is widely known as a talmid muvhak (close disciple) of Rav Yehudah, establishing Pumbeditan location; second, he is pictured as a poor sage (who would have to use a parchment with a hole in it for his tefillin, if validated by the child); and third, he is so obscure that he is given two names.22 Having chosen the main characters, our storyteller used three additional halakhic sources to create the first part of the confrontation between Rav Hisda and Rami. He borrows the legal arguments in these sources and casts them as direct dialogue between Rav Hisda and Rami.23 The first part of the dispute (part 2A) is modeled on B. Hullin 18b: When Rabbi Zeira went up to the Land of Israel, he ate there mugremet24 [forbidden] by Rav and Shmuel. They said to him, "Are you not from the place of Rav and Shmuel?" He replied, "Who said it [i.e., that in fact this halakhah was taught in the name of Rav and Shmuel]? It was Yosef bar name was added to the amoraie tradition in B. Menahot 29b to emphasize his anonymity and poverty. In the printed editions of B. Berakhot 56a, Bar Hadaya, who interpreted dreams based on how much he was paid, interpreted Abaye and Rava's identical dream (they saw "a wine cask in a dikla [palm tree]") in opposite directions. Bar Hadaya told Abaye: "your business shall flourish like the dikla [palm tree]," while he told Rava that "your business shall be sick/sweet like tamarei [dates]." Accordingly, dikla would symbolize a profitable business and tamarei, a failed business. However most of the manuscripts do not have the words dikla and tamarei in Bar Hadaya's interpretations: they read either "your business shall flourish" or "your business shall fail." 20. This is the reading in MSS Munich 95, Vatican 118, and Vatican 120. In the printed editions we find the erroneous reading: "Rami bar Tamarei also known as the father-in-law (man Kirn) of Rami bar Dikulei." This is the result of a dittography. 21. The word in question is the Hebrew word for "slew" in the verse "the Lord slew every first bom in the land of Egypt" found in the second passage of the Tefillin (Exodus 13:15). 22. See below for the additional significance of the two names in connection with Rav Yehudah. 23. These correspond as follows (according to our division above): Part 2A: B. Hullin 18b; 2B: B. Avodah Zarah 34a-b; 2C: B. Bava Mezia' 23a. We will demonstrate how the author of our story molded the halakhic material of each sugya into the dialogue between Rav Hisda and Rami. 24. A type of deflected cut in which the trachea is not cut straight but at a slant. For the earliest mention of this term, see T. Hullin 1:10. 195</page><page sequence="10">Aaron Amit Hiyya, and Yosef bar Hiyya takes traditions from anyone. Rav Yosef [bar Hiyya] heard and was angry. He said, "I take traditions from anyone? I take traditions from Rav Yehudah, who is careful even to register doubtful attributions.... But does not Rabbi Zeira accept the rule that we impose upon him the strin gencies of the place that he came from and the stringencies of the place that he has arrived at? Abaye said.... In this sugya Rabbi Zeira, the very same student of Rav Yehudah whom Rami consulted with regard to his tefillin in B. Menahot 29b, arrives in the Land of Israel and eats meat that was slaughtered in a manner called mugremet, which Babylonian halakhah deemed inappropriate.25 Despite the fact that the meat was considered permissible by the locals, they criticize Rabbi Zeira for violating his home ruling and ask: "Aren't you from the place (iTinx) of Rav and Shmuel?" Rabbi ■ Zeira defends himself by arguing that Rav and Shmuel never taught the mugremet tradition, and that the person responsible for the mistaken attribution was Rav Yosef bar Hiyya. Angry, Rav Yosef defends himself by saying that he learned the mugremet tradition from Rav Yehudah himself, who is known for his exactitude in reporting all versions of disputed attributions.26 This emphasis on Rav Yehudah's exactitude is illustrated in Rami's "double name"—it is as if Rami's very name exemplifies the type of attri bution that is said to be a characteristic of Rav Yehudah. Rabbi Zeira's behavior is then challenged from M. Pesahim 4:1 and that challenge is subsequently dismissed by Abaye and Rav Ashi. Comparing B. Hullin 18b and our story in B. Hullin 110a, we see a striking number of common elements: 1. Both texts concern a stringency of not eating a certain kind of meat. 2. In both stories a rabbi with a connection to Rav Yehudah violates custom —Rabbi Zeira violates Babylonian custom in the Land of Israel, and Rami violates Suran custom in Sura. 3. Each of the protagonists is challenged on the basis of the same Mishnah in Pesahim. 4. Both sources use the term ...7 sins, "the place of," in similar ways. 5. The words mirr m and N3N are used together in both: in B. Hullin 18b Rav Yosef defends himself with the words xrm mi"1 ma S3K (I learned it from Rav Yehudah!) and likewise Rami defends himself initially from the attack of Rav Hisda, saying, N3X "71"' 317 N"iriN?3 (I am from the place of Rav Yehudah where it is eaten). 25. Although clearly Rabbi Zeira did not agree with this position. Later in the same sugya Rabbi Zeira brings a statement in the name of Rav Nahman arguing that mugremet is in fact permissible. 26.

It is less reasonable to argue that the story in B. Hullin 18b—a brief description of a well-known divergence between the Babylonian halakhah and that of the Land of Israel, which has its own antecedents and authentic amoraic parallels—is based upon our story.27 In the second part of his attack (part 2), Rav Hisda asks Rami how he roasted the udders and tries to entrap Rami on a charge of illegal use of gentile grape products. This line of questioning is based on a sugya in B. Avodah Zarah 34a- -b:28 Grape pits and [grape] skins of gentiles are forbidden.29 Which are considered moist and which are considered dry? Rav Yehudah said in the name of Shmuel: they are considered moist during the first twelve months, and they are dry after twelve months [...] Rav Zevid said that dregs of wine (Win (C«m) of Arameans are permitted after twelve months. Rav Aha the son of Rava said grape pits ('jxns) of Arameans are permitted after a twelve-month period, (emphasis mine) In this sugya Rav Yehudah defines in the name of Shmuel the difference between wet grape pits and skins, which are forbidden and given the status of idolatrous wine, and dry pits and skins, which are permissible even to eat. According to Rav Yehudah permissibility is defined by time—the kind of grape products that are diy, and thus permitted for use, are those that are twelve months old or more. Rav Yehudah's opinion is confirmed by two amoraic statements in Aramaic. The second of these statements is attributed in the manuscripts to Rav Aha the son of Rava,30 a contemporary of Rav Ashi,31 and reads: '"uxno 27. For a discussion of the textual history of the amoraic material in B. Hullin 18b and its relationship to B. Pesahim 51a, see Aaron Amit, Talmud ha-'igud, makom she-nahagu: Pesahim perek revi'i min ha-Talmud ha-Bavli (Jerusalem: Society for the Interpretation of the Talmud, 2009), 85-91. Although parts of the sugya in B. Hullin 18b were transferred from B. Pesahim 51a, the discus sion of Rabbi Zeira's position on the permissibility of eating mugremet that is parallel to our story is original in B. Hullin. 28. The translation that follows is based on MS JTS 44830 (Rab. 15). 29. In the JTS manuscript these words are clearly designated by the scribe as a piska from M. Avodah Zarah 2:4. So also in MS Paris 1337, where the same tannaiticpiska is clearly designated '3no. In the printed editions, however, the tannaitic passage that opens the discussion is treated as a Baraita' and introduced with the term pui m 30. In MS New York JTS Rab. 15, Paris 1337, and Munich 95. The printed editions read here Rav Aha the son of Rav Ika (a fifth-generation Babylonian Amora). 31.

Clearly our storyteller used the material in this sugya in B. Avodah Zarah to create the dialogue between Rav Hisda and Rami. Rav Hisda asks what Rami used to roast the udders, and Rami answers directly from the statement of Rav Aha the son of Rava, "MXTfi." Rav Hisda then asks how he knows they were not from grapes used to make gentile wine, and Rami answers, mostly in Hebrew, "11" Iffin "WS DME? "into." It is interesting to note that the storyteller could have used the pure Aramaic sentence of Rav Aha, "nn xnw TIT "ic-in "ira," but instead prefers the Hebrew words of Rav Yehudah mentioned earlier in the sugya. This is an intentional move on the part of the story teller—he seeks to demonstrate the extent to which Rami is imbued with the wisdom of his teacher Rav Yehudah! The fact that the TiTD pits were mentioned only by the sixth-generation sage Rav Aha clearly demonstrates that our storyteller used the edited sugya that had both the words of Rav Yehudah and the words of Rav Aha.32 This means that the earliest possible date for our story would be at the end of the amoraic period. The third part of Rav Hisda's attack (part 2C) is drawn from a sugya in B. Bava Mezia' 23b. It is the only one of the three sugyot used in this section by the storyteller that has no direct reference to Rav Yehudah:33 A certain man found pitch at the winepress. He came in front of Rav [to ask if he could take it for himself]. Rav said to him, "Go and take it for yourself." Rav saw that the man was hesitating. He said to him, "Go and split it with my son Hiyya." Does this imply that Rav believes that place is not a sign [to be used for return of lost items]? Rabbi Abba said, "[Rav's ruling] is because of the abandonment of owner ship, for he saw that sprouts were growing on it." la-Talmudim (Tel Aviv: Dvir, 1987), 440, argues that in all likelihood Rav Aha the son of Rava and Rav Aha the son of Rav are the same sage. However, Cohen demonstrates in detail the problems with Albeck's thesis (Cohen, 221-32). 32. One could try to make the argument that the sugya in B. Avodah Zarah 34a-b borrowed the nxns from our story, attributing the use of the word to Rav Aha the son of Rava. However this is extre mely unlikely for a number of reasons: 1. Why, in a halakhic discussion with other Amoraim, would an editor deliberately attribute to Rav Aha the son of Rava a fictitious opinion that is based on our story? If indeed that were the case, the opinion ought to have been attributed to Rami bar Dikulei in B. Avodah Zarah! 2. The question of the status of grape pits makes abundant sense in the sugya in B. Avodah Zarah; however the use of grape pits as a fuel source for cooking udders seems quite problematic. 3. The author of our story actually combines the words of Rav Yehudah and Rav Aha the son of Rava in the statement he attributes to Rami, which strengthens the case for the direction of borrowing being B. Avodah Zarah to B. Hullin. 33. Although Rav Yehudah is mentioned immediately afterward in B. Bava Mezia. 198</page><page sequence="13">The "Halakhic Kernel" as a Criterion for Dating Babylonian Aggadah This sugya tells the story of a person who found pitch in a winepress. Rav rules that the pitch belongs to the finder and tells him to split his find with Rav's son Hiyya—to reassure the man that he has rights to the pitch. The editor of the sugya then suggests that according to Rav location is not a telltale sign of owner ship; because the pitch was found at a clear location, the winepress, it could have been used to determine the validity of the claim on the lost item, but Rav chose not to do so. This position is rejected by an amoraic statement, attributed in most of the textual witnesses to Rabbi Abba34 and in others to Rabbah or Rava;35 it reads: ",D17,n TO Tnj?7 srm m ran crtm im' awn" ([Rav's ruling is] because of the aban donment of ownership since he saw that sprouts36 were growing on it). We should notice here that the statement is composed of a Hebrew kernel, TO3 0'7-n DUPS m, accompanied by an Aramaic explanatory gloss, "'-DTO TO Ti7?7 NTm. The edi torial history of this statement is complicated by the fact that the words nura m TO] crtsn BfiK1"" appear three times in the Bavli: here in B. Bava Mezia' 23b, in B. Bava Batra 87b, and in B. Mo'ed Katan 5b. The question arises: in which context did this amoraic statement originate? After analysis of the parallel sugyot, it is clear that the original context of the statement regarding D'~&gt;V2 WIN1 (abandonment of ownership) in the Bavli is B. Bava Batra 87b and from there it was transferred to the two other sugyot?1 Not only does the theme of abandonment of ownership fit best in B. Bava Batra 87b, but an almost identical amoraic statement about abandonment of ownership regarding the same tannaitic sources appears in a parallel sugya in Y. Terumah: B. Bava Batra 87b Y. Terumah 11:8 (48a) If he tilted [the measuring cup] and There we have taught: "If he tilted drained it out, [the remainder] [the measuring cup] and drained it belongs to the seller.38 34.

"ND^n," definition no. 3, 456. 37. It is important to identify the source of the statement about WW because it makes a signifi cant difference in dating our storyteller's use of the statement. If the statement in the name of Rabbi Abba in B. Bava Mezia 23a is deemed original and authentic, our storyteller could have used this material, created by third-generation Babylonian Amoraim. However, as we shall see, the statement was in fact transferred from B. Bava Batra 87a-b and then augmented with an Aramaic gloss by the editor of the sugya in B. Bava Mezia'. The statement is also clearly secondary in B. Mo'ed Katan 5b, where it is used to refer metaphorically to the abandonment of family "ownership" of body parts fallen off a corpse. 38. This is apiska from M. Bava Batra 5:8. The halakhah is that a seller who uses a measuring cup to transfer oil or wine to the buyer's vessel is required to let the liquid drip three times into the buyer's vessel. This line states that once the vessel has been tilted again and more liquid drains— that liquid belongs to the seller. This contradicts a similar ruling in M. Terumah 11:8—which describes the exact same case with regard to measuring out terumah oil or wine being given to a priest and rules 199</page><page sequence="14">Aaron Amit B. Bava Batra 87b Y. Terumah 11:8 (48a) When Rabbi Elazar went up [to the Land of Israel], he found Ze'iri and said to him: "Who is the Tanna to whom Rav taught [the laws of] measuring?" [Ze'iri] pointed to Rabbi Yizhak the son of Avdimi. [Rabbi Yizhak the son of Avdimi] said to [Rabbi Elazar], "What is your difficulty?" [Rabbi Elazar said,] "We have taught [in the Mishnah]: 'If he tilted [the measuring cup] and drained it out, [the remainder] belongs to the seller.'

He [Rabbi Yizhak the son of Avdimi] said to him, behold it was stated with regard to that source [M. Bava Batra 5:8] in the name of Rabbi Abahu: it is because of the aban donment of ownership that they applied this law. Rabbi Yizhak the son of Elazar said [there—M. Bava Batra 5:8]it is because of the abandonment of ownership. And the same should be true of con secrated food! Rabbi Abahu said in the name of Rabbi Yohanan—it is the same for consecrated food, (emphasis mine) that the remaining liquid is considered terumah and belongs to the priest and not to the Israelite; this suggests that, according to the same logic, in M. Bava Batra the liquid should belong to the buyer and not the seller. 39. M. Bava Batra 5:8. 40. M. Terumot 11:8. 41.

Both sugyot raise a difficulty between the contradictory rulings in M. Bava Batra 5:8 and M. Terumah 11:8 regarding the remainder of a liquid poured out of a measuring vessel. 2. In both sugyot the ruling cited in M. Bava Batra awarding the leftover liquid to the seller is explained on the basis of aw (abandonment) on the part of the buyer.42 3. In both sugyot the sage who offers the explanation is a Rabbi Yizhak.43 The existence of a Yerushalmi parallel to the B. Bava Batra 87b passage with a clear relationship to that passage demonstrates that the statement attributed to Rabbi Yizhak in the Yerushalmi and to Rabbi Abahu in the Bavli is original in this context, and not in B. Bava Mezia' 23a and B. Mo'ed Katan 5b. Thus in B. Bava Mezia' 23a the statement is secondary and was transferred at a much later stage.44 In fact, the transfer was prob ably done in two stages. In the first stage the statement of Rabbi Abahu was transferred; in the second, an Aramaic gloss was added to explain how Rav knew there was abandonment of ownership. Given the source of the statement in B. Bava Batra and the nature of the quo tation in B. Bava Mezia', we can conclude that our storyteller used the final edited sugya of Bava Mezia' to form this part of his stoiy. It is only in that final edited format that the Hebrew statement "m TO3 D^sn ii'lts"1 mra" is accompanied by an Aramaic explanatory gloss "^D'Tn ,T3 Tnp7 srm." That gloss belongs to the editor of the sugya in B. Bava Mezia', who either transferred the simple Hebrew statement from B. Bava Batra 87b and added the gloss or augmented the simple Hebrew statement that was already there (from the transfer of an earlier editor) with an Aramaic gloss explaining how Rav knew the pitch to be abandoned. Our storyteller used the finished product of B. Bava Mezia' 23b, which contained both the Hebrew statement and the Aramaic gloss. This means that the terminus post quem for our story is even later than the fifth generation of Amoraim, probably after the Bava Mezia' sugya achieved final redaction. After failing to convict Rami on the illicit consumption of udders, Rav Hisda moves on to attack Rami's level of personal observance, suddenly noticing his lack of tzitzit and tefillin. Rami responds to each attack by quoting a statement of his 42. In the Yerushalmi an alternative explanation is cited in the name of Rabbi Yohanan. Accord ing to Rabbi Yohanan, M. Bava Batra should be emended to accord with M. Terumah 11:8. See Leib Moscovitz, Haterminologia shel hayerushalmi: hamunahim ha 'ikari 'im, Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 2009), 354, example 1 and n. 378. 43. Note, however, that in Y. Terumah it is Rabbi Yizhak the son of Elazar and in B. Bava Batra it is Rabbi Yizhak the son of Avdimi, with the added difference that in B. Bava Batra Rabbi Yizhak attributes the statement to Rabbi Abahu. Despite these differences, the similarity of the names is additional proof that these sugyot stem from one source. 44. See David Halivni, introduction to Mekorot u-mesorot. masekhet Bava Batra (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 2007), 127-32. 201</page><page sequence="16">Aaron Amit teacher, Rav Yehudah:45 first, "one who suffers from a stomach ailment is exempt from wearing tefillin" and then, "a borrowed garment for the first thirty days is exempt from the tzitzit." Given the storyteller's propensity for drawing his material from edited sugyot, we would expect to find both of these statements in other passages in the Bavli. However, only the second statement concerning tzitzit is found in the Bavli—in B. Menahot 44a and B. Hullin 135a. Rav Yehu dah's statement is original in B. Menahot 44a, where it appears at the end of the main talmudic discussion of the laws of tzitzit, the most logical context for that statement.46 Moreover in B. Hullin 135a the statement is introduced with the term "rmm an naina1?" (like that which was said), implying that its source is elsewhere.47 From where then did the storyteller draw the first statement of Rav Yehudah, about tefillin? One possibility is that the statement represents an authentic tradition of Rav Yehudah that has not reached us through any other channel. A statement similar to that of Rav Yehudah does appear in the Bavli. In both B. Shabbat 49a and B. Shabbat 130a there is a statement of Rabbi Yannai that tefillin require a "V3 in," literally a "clean body," which is interpreted by Babylonian Amoraim to refer to physical cleanliness. It could be that Rav Yehudah's statement was taught in that context as well but did not survive in the final edited form of those sugyot. Another possibility, which is more likely, is that the storyteller created Rav Yehudah's statement on tefillin on the basis of his authentic statement regarding tzitzit. Given that our storyteller chose to focus on the figure of Rami bar Dikulei, in part on the basis of the passage in B. Menahot 29b where Rami queries Rabbi Zeira about the perforated vav of his tefillin, it is likely that this same story teller created the statement regarding stomach ailments and tefillin and attributed it to Rami. The B. Menahot source implies that Rami was poor and had to use a text with a hole in it instead of buying a new one; in it the themes of poverty and tefillin merge: the fact that poor people would often suffer from digestive illnesses due to poor nutrition can thus account in our story for Rami's lack of tefillin due to a 45. As noted above (see n. 10), there is a split in the textual witnesses regarding the order. According to the printed editions of the Bavli, as well as MS Munich 95 and MS Vatican 122, Rav Hisda first notes Rami's lack of tefillin then his lack of tzitzit, while in MSS Hamburg 169 and Vatican 121 the order is reversed. 46. Further support for B. Menahot 44a being the original location of Rav Yehudah's statement is the fact that all the textual witnesses there preserve the same internal order: "a borrowed garment is exempt from tzitzit for the first thirty days." However, in our sugya the textual witnesses are split; the printed editions and MS Hamburg 169 read "a borrowed garment for the first thirty days is exempt from tzitzit," while MS Vatican 121 reads like B. Menahot 44a, with the temporal clause at the end of the sentence. In MSS Munich 95 and Vatican 122 we find corruptions of the original reading: MS Vatican 122 reads "a borrowed garment is rrtios [disqualified] from the tzitzit for the first thirty days"; and Munich 95 reads "a borrowed garment is HOD [exempt] for thirty days." Clearly the scribe of Munich 95 copied from a text that had the original order but accidently skipped over the middle section. Subsequently the same scribe or another scribe added the word "HOB." 47. All the textual witnesses in B. Hullin 136a read like the textual witnesses in B. Menahot 44a, except for MS Vatican 121, which reads: "a borrowed garment for the first thirty days is exempt from tzitzit." 202</page><page sequence="17">The "Halakhic Kernel" as a Criterion for Dating Babylonian Aggadah stomach ailment. Given Rami's poverty and given that the storyteller had an auth entic statement of Rav Yehudah about tzitzit, he decided to cast Rami as appearing before Rav Hisda for judgment without any symbols of Jewish identity. The dou bling of Rav Hisda's attack, citing Rami's lack ofboth tefillin and tzitzit, serves to emphasize and demonstrate the problematic nature of the community of Sura. They are consumed with symbols and how things look on the outside, seeking to institute a rule of law without internalizing the real meaning of the command ments. Therefore on Erev Yom Kippur they are concerned about a person collect ing udders from the garbage—because udders cannot be eaten; however, they ignore the fact that the person's extreme poverty, combined with their own lack of hospitality, has forced him to collect food from the garbage on Erev Yom Kippur. Rami's lack of tzitzit and tefillin identify him as suspicious in Sura, and the Surans are not able to imagine what is going on inside Rami—i.e., that he has a stomach ailment and is so poor that he has to wear borrowed clothing. The storyteller creates a statement about tefillin based on the Babylonian amoraic concern with bodily cleanliness when donning tefillin, which mirrors Rav Yehudah's authentic statement regarding borrowed tzitzit.48 The story closes with further criticism of the rule of law in Sura. When a person suspected of not honoring his parents is bound and brought into the beit din of Rav Hisda, Rami demands that Rav Hisda release the prisoner, based on a Baraita' that states: "Every positive commandment that has its reward [men tioned] together with it does not fall within the jurisdiction of the human court." This tannaitic source appears nowhere else in the Bavli,49 and refers to the penta teuchal connection between the commandment of honoring one's parents and longevity: "Honor your father and your mother, that you may long endure on the land" (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16).50 The source of this Baraita' is likely the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael:51 48. This would also explain nicely the reversal of the order in some of the manuscripts as men tioned above (nn. 10 and 45). The original version of the story most likely opened with the authentic statement of Rav Yehudah regarding tzitzit from B. Menahot 44a and was followed by the statement about tefillin. Another possible explanation could be that the differing order reflects two ways that tzitzit and tefillin tend to be listed in rabbinic literature; e.g., in the Yerushalmi some lists have tzitzit before tefillin (Y. Peah 1:1 [15b]; see also Vayikra Rabba, Aharei Mot, par. 22, to Leviticus 17:3 [ed. Margaliot, 2:296] and others have tefillin before tzitzit (Y. Peah 1:1 [15d] = Y. Kiddushin 1:7 [61b]). In B. Kiddushin 33b-34a the textual witnesses are split on this very point; the printed edi tions have tzitzit before tefillin while MS Oxford 367 has tefillin before tzitzit (in MS Vatican 111 the word "tzitzit" was added in a second hand in the margin, and in MS Munich 95 tzitzit are not on the list at all). 49. Y. Bava Batra 5:9 (15a) has an almost exact parallel, which will be discussed below. 50. B. Kiddushin 39b in a Baraita' attributed to the Tanna Rabbi Ya'akov, addresses two com mandments that promise longevity upon their fulfillment: honoring parents and sending forth the mother bird. However, there the point of the homily is not that the earthly beit din has no jurisdiction, but that these two commandments both refer to a portion in the World to Come (compare parallel source in T. Hullin 10:16, ed. Zuckermandel, 512). 51. Mesekhta de-ba-hodesh, piska 8, ed.

Hence they said,52 "Every commandment that has its reward [mentioned] together with it does not fall within the jurisdiction of the human court." The Baraita' in our story is identical almost word for word with the quotation in the Mekhilta,53 and Rami's quotation of the Baraita' in the context of a person who has failed to fulfill the commandment of honoring his parents demonstrates that it was from this context that the storyteller had knowledge of the Baraita'.54 More over, given that our storyteller drew his sources from edited works, this may indi cate that the editor of our story was familiar with the redacted Mekhilta itself. On the other hand, it is also possible that our storyteller received this source through a separate chain of tradition. A Baraita' very similar to the one cited by Rami is quoted in the context of the commandment to use fair measures55 in Y. Bava Batra 5:9 (15a): It is written: "You shall have an honest balance, honest weights" (Leviticus 19:36). Hence the sages said, "Every commandment that has its reward written together with it does not fall within the jurisdiction of the human court. [...]" Rabbi Bon the son of Hiyya taught the Baraita' (matnita) thus: "Every commandment that has its reward written together with it, [the perpe trator] cannot be punished by the human court." In this sugya two versions of the Baraita' are taught in connection with the com mandment to use fair measures. According to the first, the human court does not have jurisdiction: "pinna V"? iT3 "X," while according to the version quoted by Rabbi Bon the son of Hiyya, the human court cannot punish the perpetrator: "IT1?!? "ptrrsJ "7 rra "px." The first version seems to be the original version that 52. On the term "nas lion" in the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, see J. N. Epstein, Mavo la 'nusah hamishnah, (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 2000, reprint), 736-38; E. Z. Melamed, Pirkei mavo la'sifrut hatalmudit, (Jerusalem, Galor Press, 1973), 249-53. Menahem Kahana, The Literature of the Sages, part 2, ed. Shmuel Safrai, Ze'ev Safrai, Joshua Schwartz, Peter Tomson (The Netherlands: Royal Van Gorcum and Fortress Press, 2006), 56, adopts Epstein's thesis (introduction, 733), writing: "In MekRY and SifNum (Yishmaelian) on the other hand, nan p'S, 'Hence they said,' is not so common, and when the Mishna is cited, this is not done in its actual language but rather by way of paraphrase and abbreviation. Nor do these works contain many quotations of baraitot and of Tosefta passages introduced with 'Hence they said.'" 53. There are two minor differences. First, the version in our story reads "every positive com mandment" instead of the Mekhilta's "every commandment" and the version in our story adds "earthly" (noa'?»). 54. This point is identical with the one made by Rami in our sugya, unlike the similar tradition of Rabbi Ya'akov in B. Kiddushin 39b, which does not expressly rule out trial in an earthly court (see n. 48). 55. See Deuteronomy 25:15, where the commandment is connected with longevity: "You must have completely honest weights and completely honest measures, if you are to endure long on the soil that the Lord your God is giving you." 204</page><page sequence="19">The "Halakhic Kernel" as a Criterion for Dating Babylonian Aggadah was known in the Land of Israel, and this is matched by the quotation in the Mekhilta and in our story. The quotation of the Baraita' in Y. Bava Batra shows that it was transmitted in the rabbinic academies and could have been known by our storyteller as well. The story closes with Rav Hisda recognizing the brilliance of Rami bar Dikulei: "I see that you are very sharp!"56 Rami replies that "if only you [=Rav Hisda] would come to Rav Yehudah's school, I would show you true brilliance!" 57 As argued above, the storyteller drew the theme of sharpness/brilliance from B. Sanhedrin 17b and its juxtaposition of Rav Yehudah and Rav Hisda as the sages of Sura and Pumbedita with the "brilliant ones of Pumbedita." However, sharpness can also be seen as a negative attribute. In B. Bava Mezia' 38b Rav Sheshet accuses the Pumbeditan sage Rav Amram of using a forced argument in his interpretation of a Baraita', saying, "Perhaps you are from Pumbedita where they put an elephant in the eye of a needle!" Rav Hisda could certainly share Rav Sheshet's appraisal of the Pumbeditan sage Rami bar Dikulei. However, even if Rav Hisda's description of Rami as sharp or brilliant is sarcastic, the overall tone of the end of the story implies a resounding victory for Rami. He is given the last word, and his invitation to Rav Hisda to come to Pumbedita demon strates the storyteller's perspective that the smallest student of Rav Yehudah has succeeded in defeating the greatest sage of Sura. In conclusion, we have seen, through careful analysis of the parallel sources, how the author of our story used "halakhic kernels" found in redacted halakhic texts to create the dialogue between Rav Hisda and Rami bar Dikulei in our story, thus demonstrating that halakhic sources can be of great value in dating tal mudic narratives and reconstructing their mode of composition. According to the foregoing analysis, this narrative is most likely a post-amoraic creation that makes use of the figures of Rav Hisda and Rami bar Dikulei. Obviously, our argument should caution against attempts to use these narratives to reconstruct the historical reality of Sura or Pumbedita at the beginning of the third century, when Rav Hisda flourished. It is clear that the narrative can be dated no earlier than the end of the fourth century and represents the work of a creative late-Babylonian storyteller. Aaron Amit Bar Ilan University Ramat-Gan, Israel 56. The storyteller is surely aware of two possible understandings of "sharpness;" one positive, in the sense of brilliance, and one negative, in the sense of one who uses forced arguments. It could be that Rav Hisda is being sarcastic and means to say that all Rami has done is to use forced arguments. See immediately below the reference to B. Bava Mezia' 38b. As we mentioned above (see n. 17), the sages of Mehoza were also described as being "sharp" in B. Berakhot 59b due to their drinking the water of the Tigris River. 57. Here the textual witnesses read "1KSlin" or ""Dun." Some translations understand this to mean "my sharpness/brilliance." However, in my opinion, more likely we have a plural noun form of "xsnn." 205</page></plain_text>
