Living Letters of the Law examines adaptations to the "hermeneutical Jew"-the putative, ahistorical Jew created by Augustinian theology-as the cul- tural horizons of the medieval Latin world broadened. Cohen traces the contours of the "hermeneutical Jew" from Augustine through Gregory the Great, Isidore of Seville, and Agobard of Lyons before he turns to the twelfth century. Because he now finds more persuasive Amos Funkenstein's contention that twelfth-century anti-Jewish polemics signal an important shift in medieval perceptions of Judaism, here Cohen pays much more attention to twelfth-century authors (e.g. Anselm of Canterbury, Gilbert Crispin, Odo of Cambrai, Guibert of Nogent, Peter Alfonsi, Peter the Venerable, and Bernard of Clairvaux) than he had done in The Friars and the Jews, and considerably less to thirteenth-century mendicants. Indeed, Cohen explains that "reactions to my thesis on the significance of the friars [in The Fri- ars and the Jews] ... quickly convinced me that a fair assessment of later medieval Christian ideas of the Jew demanded a more conscientious investigation of their antecedents. The present study constitutes my attempt to move backward ..." (p. 314). Thanks to this move backward Cohen now proposes that the roots for the most dramatic modifications to Augustine's model of Jewish witness, which had established a theological basis for toleration of Jewish communities in Christen- dom, appear in the twelfth century. But for Cohen these roots stem especially from Christendom's encounter with Islam, an encounter that is responsible for new fea- tures in the polemical tradition. For example, it was largely this encounter with Is- lam, he avows, that necessitated Christian polemics sola ratione. An unanticipat- ed outcome of the engagement with Islam, however, was that "the Jew ceased to function in Christian thought as the sole or even predominant 'other"' (p. 156). Many churchmen reclassified Jews as a subset of a larger group of theological en- emies alongside Muslims and heretics, which served "to disempower the hermeneutically crafted Jew of patristic theology, depriving him of that singularity which distinguished him and underlay his worth" (p. 159). As Cohen argued previ- ously in "The Muslim Connection or On the Changing Role of the Jew in High Medieval Theology," the traumatic encounter with Islam both altered traditional perceptions of Jews and also formed Christian views of Islam according to the im- age and likeness of Judaism.' At the same time, the Jews' rejection of dialectical "proofs" of fundamental Christian doctrines raised disturbing questions of the Jews' rationality (or even of their humanity) while a growing awareness in the twelfth century of the impor- tance of the Talmud in Jewish religious life raised doubts about the Jews' role as faithful witnesses to biblical religion. For Cohen these trends intensify during the 1. From Witness to Witchcraft: Jews and Judaism in Medieval Christian Thought, ed.

Repeated attacks in the thirteenth century on the Talmud (consigned to the flames in Paris in 1242 by ecclesiastical decree, for example) or efforts to censor the Talmud by expung- ing from it anti-Christian sentiments, reflect the harvest of seeds planted in the twelfth century. Throughout this work, Cohen engages in a reasoned dialogue with his crit- ics, most notably Robert Chazan, who has repeatedly challenged his claim that a fundamental shift occurred in perceptions of Jews following the Christian "dis- covery" of talmudic Judaism. Although he acknowledges the ambiguity of some of the evidence, Cohen reaffirms that "As Christendom had come to scrutinize the Jews alongside other infidels and Christian heretics, churchmen in the thirteenth century voiced the conviction that Jewish behavior no longer comported with the construction of the Jew whom Augustine had intended to preserve. Belief in the oral torah was a Jewish heresy" (p. 333). Qua heresy, it could no longer be toler- ated within the boundaries of Christendom, initiating a series of attacks-often en- couraged or at least administered by the new mendicant orders-that demanded the conversion of Jews and culminated in the well-known expulsion of many European Jewish communities from the late thirteenth through fifteenth centuries. In many ways, this study reiterates Cohen's earlier findings. However, in this volume Cohen provides evidence that significant challenges to the Augustinian "hermeneutical Jew" appear already in the eleventh and twelfth centuries-even if these challenges became widespread and a genuine threat only after the appear- ance of the mendicant orders in the thirteenth century. The change may be subtle, but it helps fashion Cohen's response to his critics while delineating more sharply the lines of the debate over the evolution of anti-Jewish doctrines of the high Mid- dle Ages. Living Letters of the Law reveals a scholar in dialogue with contempo- raries and, whatever shortcomings one may find in the work, the process is itself illuminating. Irven M.
