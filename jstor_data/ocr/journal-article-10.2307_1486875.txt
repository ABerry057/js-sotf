Rubenstein's The History of Sukkot in the Second Temple and Rabbinic Periods is not only an example of quality scholarship, but it</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 117 presents the reader with a method and message about how contemporary critical scholarship is to be done. Unlike Baruch Bokser's The Origins of the Seder, which focused only upon the literary form of the Seder, Rubenstein integrates all the relevant information into a full portrayal of the Sukkot festival. Rejecting the paths defined by earlier rabbinic scholars, both the approach of explaining what the rabbis wrote about this or that, and Bokser's "history of the tradition" reconstruction of the theological underpinning of his materials, Rubenstein applies several methodologies, as well as any information that he can bring to bear, in order to explain how the Sukkot festival was understood in ancient Judaism. To accomplish this end, Rubenstein examines the sources regarding Sukkot with the academic tradition, methods, and orientation of Bible scholarship, which focuses upon words, ideas, documents, and any and all sources that define historical settings. Rubenstein begins and concludes his monograph by affirming the popular scholarly view that the popular Sukkot traditions of J and E coalesced into D and were edited into a final Torah document by P; his summary of the materials in Exodus, Deuteronomy, and Leviticus, in that order, reflects this view. Consequently, the Ezra-Nehemiah report, which for Rubenstein reflects the ideological worldview of P, "is not a description of a Sukkot celebration but that of a community that hears the laws and obeys" (p. 35). Rubenstein shows that this account requires the dwelling in sukkot, which presupposes the existence of the "Holiness Code." He argues that by Nehemiah's time the Torah document was complete. It should be noted that this summary adds nothing to Rubenstein's findings. One gets the impression that Rubenstein is laying the polemical groundwork for the methodological redirection in which he believes rabbinic scholarship ought to move. Just as students of Christian Scripture build on the findings of Hebrew Scripture criticism, Rubenstein's monograph applies the same method to rabbinic literature and institutions, and because so many more data are extant than with the biblical materials, the findings are so much more fertile. Rubenstein correctly observes that a phenomenological understanding of the Sukkot festival cannot be defined on the basis of the Pentateuchal record alone. For the purpose of his monograph, it would have been sufficient to outline the Pentateuchal materials extant in the time of the Second Temple period, for early Judaism was responding to a Torah book. Rubenstein's introduction and comments regarding the Torah's authorship are not, at first glance, relevant to the texts on which he focuses. In point of fact,</page><page sequence="3">118 BOOK REVIEWS Rubenstein reads the rabbinic materials as a "scripture," or religious "canon," in its own right. And unlike the situation regarding biblical Israel, the canonical, extracanonical, and epigraphic records are sufficiently abundant to justify significant reconstructions. When relying upon his own judgments, Rubenstein is thorough, careful, and judicious in his evaluations as well as in his conclusions. Ever the careful empirical scholar of the textual record, Rubenstein avoids theories and conjectures which cannot be justified on the basis of his data. After analyzing the materials in Ezra and Nehemiah, Rubenstein turns to Zechariah 14, which he assigns to the Hellenistic period, for a confirmation that the ancient joyous festival retained some of its ancient Israelite flavor in the impoverished Persian province of Yahud. Due attention is given to the Sukkot of Jubilees, which projects upon Israel's patriarchs the concerns of their day, according to which Abraham observes the festival with great joy, builds the booth, circles the altar, and wears a wreath on his head. This last practice reflects Roman victory celebrations, not the usages of Israel's antiquity. In light of Zechariah, which sees Sukkot as the occasion for the eschatological victory of the Lord over the unfaithful, Rubenstein demonstrates how Jewish folk religion and rabbinic religion understood the Sukkot festival. Rubenstein proceeds to show how, in Second Commonwealth times, Sukkot was seen as the festival of renewing the sacred space of the sanctuary. He also shows how, in Qumran, the very word lulav was used and individuals made their own sukkot, indicating that the festival enjoyed a popular as well as a public character. While Philo does not mention the lulav and etrog, note is made of the practice of Egyptian Jewry to dwell in sukkot in Second Temple times. Josephus adds that the lulav was used only in processions, as a cultic wand, paralleling the Greek usage. Although not so stated by Rubenstein, this phenomenon may explain why rabbinic legislation ordained the benediction of the four species on the most visible of the fruits, the lulav, because it was taken to be a cultic wand. When showing how the rain motif of Sukkot appears both in Zechariah and in Christian Scripture, Rubenstein demonstrates that on a folk-religion level, Sukkot was the time when Israel accepted God as king during the assembly and asked for life-giving rain. Duly noted is the fact that Jesus is taken to have recited Hosanna (M. Sukkah 3:19!) and Hallel (Psalm 118), which have remained part of traditional Jewish liturgy to this day. He concludes that Sukkot was the most widely observed festival in Jewish</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 119 antiquity, and that the lulav and its bundle/bouquet were observed, at this time, only in the Temple precincts. His painstaking study of the Mishnah confirms the findings of Raphael Patai, who argues that the shaking of the lulav symbolizes joy and fertility, the green altar represents the fertility of plant life, and the encircling ritual portrays a plea for fertility and rainmaking. The Water Libation festival is taken to be an expression of the touching of the cosmic waters with the human waters, so that through cult the waters at the earth's epicenter would be moved to gush forth and fructify the world, giving thereby life and fertility to the world's inhabitants. By the time of the tannaim, the motifs found in Zechariah and in writings outside of Judaism's canon point to a discrete worldview. With the destruction of the Temple, Judaism had to be redefined so that the Temple, and its epicenter, or axis mundi, could be replaced. Without a systematic theology and with a historical impulse, the popular fertility myth resurfaced. By appropriating the popular mythology which had grown from antiquity, the rabbis exhibited continuity with the past in a time of the radical discontinuity of destruction. Rubenstein notes with approval that the rabbis restored the lifegiving joy of the festival, which reflects a personal rather than an academic response. Rubenstein is at his best when he traces the Sukkot rituals through tannaitic materials, always focusing upon a careful reading of the best textual witnesses. He shows how the Sukkot season was seen as part of a New Year renewal, and demonstrates from Zechariah 14 how the mishnaic concern for rain reflects the abiding concerns of Second Temple Judaism. He finds in the post-destruction Sukkot rituals an attempt to preserve what had been lost in the destruction, and to enable Judaism to function after the loss of its central shrine. Rubenstein's tracing of the lulav rite through the tannaitic generations is analytically painstaking and convincingly concludes that a folk practice was first standardized and then, at the end of the tannaitic period, refined. He argues that the literary orderliness of the concerns testifies to the accuracy of attribution, in contradistinction to Jacob Neusner's methodologically cynical view that all attributions must be suspect until proven otherwise. The conclusion of Rubenstein's analysis of the rabbinic aggadah provides a masterful corroboration of his findings regarding the rabbinic halakhah. The symbolism of the sukkah provides a manifestation of God's glory, divine protection, intimacy, and love, and he shows how the same cultural values that are embodied in the halakhah are explicated in the aggadah. For example, one must sleep in a sukkah in which the shade cast by the covering sekhakh is greater than the light, so that one is symbolically dwelling under divine</page><page sequence="5">120 BOOK REVIEWS providential care. And it is this shade, taken from plant life that is no longer alive, and not from bricks, plaster, trees, or blankets, that is acceptable. The motifs of Zechariah 14 resonate in both aggadah and halakhah. For Rubenstein, Sukkot was, in its historical origin, a Temple-centered cultic festival, as deduced from canonical sources (biblical as well as rabbinic) and external sources. The presentation of the fruits represented the rebirth of nature, but without the pagan mythological overtones. Rubenstein concedes that the biblical legal texts do not provide any hints as to the life-situation origins of the festival rituals. However, in talmudic literature, Sukkot is connected with rain and rebirth, and is associated with the judgment season of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, and with the Temple's destruction and the apparent absence of the Divine Presence-a season construed to be anticipatory of an eschatological Sukkot. According to Rubenstein's reconstruction of this implied rabbinic myth, the Sukkot rituals in the Temple stirred the axis mundi, which would excite the primordial waters to come forth and fructify the world. This hypothesis is presented forcefully and, for the most part, convincingly. Rubenstein concludes his study with the hope that his monograph will provide a model and method for tracing the development of Judaism from Second Commonwealth times to rabbinic Judaism. Since Rubenstein casts Bokser's work on the Seder as his foil, a method- ological observation is in order. Bokser and Rubenstein are doing different things in their scholarship. Bokser focused on the literary evolution of a ritual and based himself only upon literary materials. Rubenstein is an historian of religion and employs the methods and concerns appropriate to the discipline. He also exploits the rich data that are available to him. The real test of Rubenstein's methodology would come in a study of Passover paralleling his study of Sukkot, especially if he were to revise Bokser's results or significantly expand the field of inquiry in a fashion that would yield significant new understandings of the assembled data. The one area of canon/culture scholarship that Rubenstein did not fully exploit is philology. His transliterations of Hebrew/Aramaic reflect the popular Israeli dialect, and he does not pay consistent attention to shewa 'im or geminate letters, as is the practice in philological scholarship. Jeffrey Rubenstein has made a very significant contribution to rabbinic scholarship as well as to the history of religion. His careful literary studies reveal a folk-religion worldview that has, to date, gone unnoticed by scholars, and the methodology he suggests, which is the comparative literary approach</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 121 common to Bible scholarship, is a very fertile avenue because the available literary data in this area are much more extensive than in biblical studies.
