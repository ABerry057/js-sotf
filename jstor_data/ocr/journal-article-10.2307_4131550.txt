<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shimon Redlich. Together and Apart in Brzezany: Poles, Jews, and Ukrainians, 1919-1945. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2002. xi, 202 pp. Rosa Lehman. Symbiosis and Ambivalence: Poles and Jews in a Small Galician Town. New York: Berghahn Books, 2001. xxii, 217 pp. The books under review deal with two towns in Galicia, territory that was part of the Habsburg Empire from 1772 until 1918. The first town, Brzezany, is lo- cated today in the Ukraine; the second, Jasliska, a small town, is now in Poland. Despite different starting points, both books attempt to solve the riddle of the past and present relations between Jews and their neighbors, relations that are noted for their ambivalence and complexity. For Shimon Redlich, a historian and native of Brzezany, the return home is not merely part of a larger research project, but first and foremost an attempt to re- vive childhood memories that have long been suppressed. Redlich's book is arranged chronologically, with each chapter commencing with personal and fam- ily memories, then continuing with a description of the historical events, and con- cluding with the testimonies of the inhabitants: Jews, Poles, and Ukrainians. In the 406</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews relevant chapters, Redlich even makes an effort to include testimonies of Germans from the period of German occupation, with the help of documents from German archives. The story of Brzezany that emerges from the book is in fact the story of the complex system of relations between Poles, Jews, and Ukrainians, who lived side-by-side in the town. During the Habsburg period, which appears in the book merely as background, the members of the different groups lived in relative har- mony, "together and apart," according to the book's title. But relations deteriorat- ed after the period of the First World War, with the radicalization of the different nationalist movements and the frequent regime changes. After the split-up of the Habsburg Empire and the reconstitution of an inde- pendent Poland, Brzezany became once again a Polish town. The Western Ukrai- nian Republic, which existed for eight months during 1918, fanned the hopes for national independence among the Brzezany Ukrainians, but these faded after the Ukrainians were defeated by the Poles. The failure left indelible marks that would turn to hope whenever Poland was in danger of being conquered. Redlich labels the period between 1919 and 1939, when Bzezany was under Polish political framework, "the good years." The Jews who had undergone a process of Polish ac- culturation during the last years of the Habsburg regime attended Polish gymnasia and maintained friendly relations with the Poles. Although there was Polish anti- Semitism during the period, most of the Jewish survivors whose testimony Redlich collected did not experience personal discrimination or resentment; on the con- trary, they describe their childhood in glowing terms. Religious and communal life flourished, as well as Jewish politics and culture. The middle class dressed well, spent summers on holiday, and generally lived a comfortable life. There were still restrictions in higher education and anti-Semitic incidents, but the atmosphere was not of catastrophe, nor could people foresee what lay in store. Relations between Ukrainians and Poles were not so bad at the outset of the Polish period, but tensions sharply rose after the death of Josef Pilsudsky and the radicalization of Polish nationalism. Brzezany's Poles remember fondly the inter- war period as one in which they constituted the city's elite, obtained the most de- sirable positions, and, above all, felt pride at their national independence and the city's Polishness. Redlich was four years old when the Soviets occupied the city in 1931. The two years of Soviet rule (1939-41) witnessed a reversal of fortunes for the city's main eth- nic groups. The Poles were filled with fear, the Ukrainians rejoiced at the prospect of an improvement in status, and the Jews were ambivalent, with the elders apprehen- sive and the communist youth viewing the Soviet takeover as the realization of their dream. In the city all the Polish symbols were destroyed; the Soviet educational sys- tem replaced the Polish, the language of instruction changed, and Soviet parades filled the streets. At first, new opportunities in the universities and in employment led the Jews and Ukrainians to be optimistic about their futures. But Soviet surveillance, arrests, and exiles produced an atmosphere of fear and suspicion, and the Polish accusation of Jewish collaboration with the Soviets fanned insecurities. With the German occupation of the town (1941-1944) matters went from bad to worse for the Jews. (Redlich survived the war hiding in a Ukrainian woman's attic.) Traumatic memories of the Soviet occupation, bolstered by German accu- 407</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews sations of Jewish Bolshevism, led some Ukrainians to carry out pogroms against Jewish targets. Polish anti-Semitism was less prominent in this region than in oth- ers. The city itself became German, with German street names. Life was better un- der German than under Soviet rule for the Poles, many of whom were familiar with German language and culture from the period of Habsburg rule. The Ukrainians, for their part, viewed the Germans as liberators and hoped that Hitler would es- tablish a free Ukraine. Both Poles and Ukrainians relate in their testimonies that they were aware of the mass murders committed against the Jews and saddened by them, but they could do little since they were occupied in their own struggle for survival. The Ukrainian testimonies do not mention the pogroms; on the contrary, they empha- sized the sympathy they felt for the Jews. Only around 2% of the Jewish popula- tion of Brzezany survived. The next chapter describes the transition of East Galicia to Russian control (1944-1945). During this period the relations between Poles and Ukrainians de- teriorated even further, and many Poles left. The demographics of East Galicia changed completely, with only 5% of the original inhabitants remaining. In the last chapter of the book Redlich describes his return to Brzezany, which he views as part of the universal trend of returning to one's birthplace. Poles and Ukrainians also return to visit in Brzezany, but every one returns to his own past and memories-to his own Brzezany. Redlich's story is not only a historical tale and analysis of a quarter-century of the history of Brzezany, but an attempt to offer an explanation of the animosity between local residents who had lived side by side in the past. It appears that with the aid of the healing that he seeks and finds for himself, through the reconstruction of his childhood memories, he attempts to remove a bit of the great shadow of the Holocaust from the history of East Euro- peans and to show how, once, Poles, Ukrainians, and Jews lived together in rela- tive harmony. He does not withhold his empathy from any group, as he describes how the fickle history of Brzezany turned its inhabitants into pawns of larger forces, despite the fact that he takes care to place the tragedy and loss that the Jews experienced in its unique place. Rosa Lehman's book is very different from Redlich's. Her choice of Jasliska does not stem from a personal or family connection, but from her declared aim of focusing on a small town as the subject of her research. Lehman claims that the study of Polish Jewry has been based hitherto upon their position in the large cities. She seeks to balance this picture by taking the story of one small town and treat- ing it as a case study that will provide a broader perspective. Lehman employs what she calls "the framework of patron-client relations" to explain the complicated sys- tem of relations between Poles and Jews. She realizes, of course, that the frame- work relates historically only to the relations under feudalism, but she feels that it continued to influence through the creation of stereotypes. As a historian, I am not competent to pass judgment on the sociological or anthropological theories un- derlying Lehman's decision, or on the benefit of employing theoretical constructs, at least from the reader's point of view, to analyze fluctuating relations. I am likewise not competent to evaluate the professional ethics of Lehman's decision not to disclose to her Polish interviewees and translators that her main re- 408</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews search interest was the Jewish past of the town. Instead, she presented herself as a sociologist interested in the history of the town and its families (p. 17). She writes: "The reason why I did not make the research topic explicit was that I expected it to be a sensitive one . . . All in all, I was positively surprised by the enthusiasm with which the informants engaged in storytelling about the Jewish past of their community." Professional ethics aside, this lack of full disclosure strikes me as questionable at best. Lehman uses a good deal of archival documentation and historical research to reconstruct the early history of the town as well as the beginning of Jewish settle- ment there. She cites statistical data, provides a map of Jewish residential areas, and weaves together testimonies and oral traditions. After this historical reconstruction she devotes several chapters to the system of Polish-Jewish relations, arranging them thematically, for example, "Spatial Integration," "Economic Relations," "The Social Boundary and the Image of the Jew," and so forth. She examines the gap between the "facts" and the positive and negative stereotypes held by adults and youths, and she shows how these "facts" and stereotypes continued to persist side by side. Stereo- types served, in her opinion, to protect the ethnic boundaries between Jews and Poles. An especially interesting chapter is devoted to the story of the conversion of a local Jewish woman to Catholicism, and includes an interview with the convert and her daughter. Although at first glance in this case it appears that the lines be- tween Jews and Poles were blurred, Lehman considers the fact that these women continued to be called "converts" a sign that the ethnic boundaries were still in- tact, despite everything. Another chapter is devoted to the destruction of the Jewish community not only during the German period but also during the communist and post-commu- nist periods, as well. As for guilt feelings and the acceptance of responsibility for at least some of the horrors of the Holocaust, Lehman claims, on the basis of stud- ies that she cites, that responsibility is understood differently in the West than in Poland (p. 184): Whereas in the West everybody bears responsibility for what hap- pened to the Jews of Europe, in Poland moral guilt requires a sense of direct, per- sonal involvement. The claim seems rather strange to me. There are several factual errors; for example, on page 97 we are informed that during the Austrian period "education was not compulsory and the official lan- guage was German" whereas in fact education had been compulsory dejure since 1869, and Polish was an official language in Galicia since the Ausgleich of 1867. On pages 32 and 33, the first partition of Poland is said to have taken place in 1773, but in footnote 20 of the same chapter the correct date is given--1772. To sum up: Lehman succeeds in convincing the reader of the ambivalent na- ture of the relations between Jews and Poles. But her introduction of sociological and anthropological constructs places an unnecessary burden on the reader. Rachel Manekin Hebrew University Jerusalem, Israel 409</page></plain_text>
