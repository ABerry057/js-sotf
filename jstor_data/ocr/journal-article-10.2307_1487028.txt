Albany: State University of New York Press, 1989. xvi, 264 pp. One of the most rapidly evolving and changing fields in Jewish studies is that of Jewish mysticism. While isolated scholars in the nineteenth century had already begun to turn their attention to the corpus of mystical texts within Judaism, it was Gershom Scholem in this century who established</page><page sequence="2">124 BOOK REVIEWS Kabbalah as an autonomous discipline within the curriculum of Jewish studies. Scholem's voluminous writings have provided the textual-historical framework within which all academic research on Jewish mysticism pro- ceeds. In recent times the number of "reapers of the field"-to borrow one of the Zohar's idioms for those engaged in kabbalistic speculation-has grown considerably. This growth is to be measured not only in size but in quality as well. Most importantly, some of the leading philological, his- torical, and textual assumptions of Scholem have been challenged by the outstanding minds of the new generation of scholars. Inevitably, some of the finer points of Scholem's oeuvre are being tested and refined in the crucible of ongoing critical scholarship. There is yet another sense in which the study of Jewish mysticism is advancing. Having the advantage of the general contours of the field laid out clearly before us, we are just beginning to apply methodologies from other disciplines, such as mythology, religious studies, literary criticism, and hermeneutics, to the primary texts, composed mainly in Hebrew and Ara- maic. Motif analysis in a phenomenological vein, begun by Scholem himself, has emerged of late as a major preoccupation for scholars of Jewish mysti- cism. Elliot Ginsburg's The Sabbath in the Classical Kabbalah is a model example of just such a study. Ginsburg has succeeded in creating a synthesis between the rigorous textual tradition of the Scholemian school and concern with the broader issues of comparative religious studies. Let me begin my review of Ginsburg's books by addressing the use of the term "classical Kabbalah" in the title of the first book, for a discussion of this term will enable me to assess the historical-textual range of Ginsburg's work. By the latter term Ginsburg intends the development of theosophic Kabbalah, i.e., the kabbalistic tradition concerned principally with the description of the Godhead in terms of the emanation or unfolding of the ten gradations (sefirot), from the twelfth century to the dawn of Lurianic Kabbalah in the sixteenth. In point of fact, however, Ginsburg's book focuses on the kabbalistic treatments of the Sabbath from the Sefer ha- Bahir, the first text fully dedicated to theosophic Kabbalah, which appeared in the twelfth century, presumably in Provence, to the Tiqqune Zohar and Ra'aya' Mehemna', composed by an anonymous Spanish kabbalist in the last decade of the thirteenth century or the first decades of the fourteenth. To be sure, in the notes to this volume, Ginsburg draws extensively from kabbalistic sources up until the period of Safedian Kabbalah. Moreover, the second volume, Sod Ha-Shabbat: The Mystery of the Sabbath, is an annotat- ed translation of the kabbalistic treatise on the Sabbath which appears in the</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 125 Tola'at Ya'aqov of Meir ibn Gabbai, completed in 1507. Yet, as Ginsburg himself notes (Sod Ha-Shabbat, pp. 4-5), ibn Gabbai's treatment of the Sabbath is heavily influenced by the zoharic tradition. For all intents and purposes, therefore, Ginsburg has provided us with a thorough examination of the mystical interpretations of the Sabbath in the golden period of kabba- listic literary activity, from the late twelfth to the early fourteenth century. For the most part the basic historical and conceptual framework assumed by Ginsburg in The Sabbath in the Classical Kabbalah is derived from the research of Scholem. This is especially evident in the historical overview of the various trends of Kabbalah in the classical period (twelfth-thirteenth century), encompassing both the theosophic and ecstatic Kabbalah, with which Ginsburg begins his book, an introduction written, as the author notes in the preface (p. x),to introduce the nonspecialist into the complex world of kabbalistic symbolism centered on the sefirotic pleroma. It will be noted, parenthetically, that Ginsburg has filled a scholarly vacuum by providing one of the most lucid and readable introductions in English to the classical forms of medieval Jewish mysticism, which will greatly benefit the novice. On the other hand, there are occasions in the body of his work when Ginsburg makes suggestions which go beyond the standard historio- graphical positions adopted by followers of Scholem, as can be seen par- ticularly with respect to the relationship between Judah ben Yaqar and the German Pietists (see pp. 168, n. 183; 169, n. 189; 175-176, n. 231). These passing insights, to be elaborated in more detail by the author in future research, are extremely important for a reassessment of the historical con- tours of kabbalistic speculation in medieval Europe. In his understanding of kabbalistic ritual and its relationship to rabbinic precursors, Ginsburg also seems to follow the Scholemian approach. Thus, even though he calls for the need to reevaluate Scholem's view of rabbinic ritual as being devoid of myth, basing himself primarily on the work of Jacob Neusner and Moshe Idel, he continues to speak of Kabbalah as a "mythic re-reading" or "mythopoaeic revision" of rabbinic ritual (see pp. 187-188). Furthermore, Ginsburg is quick to point out that it is only in the Kabbalah that the isolated mythical elements are integrated into a mythic system. Additionally, as the author notes, two of the major conceptual inno- vations of the kabbalists, the view of Sabbath observance as a theurgical act affecting the divine and the hypostatization of the Sabbath as one of the attributes of God, are lacking in rabbinic literature (see pp. 68-69). In the final analysis, therefore, Ginsburg is in line with the viewpoint of Scholem that Kabbalah represents a rereading or revision of the rabbinic</page><page sequence="4">126 BOOK REVIEWS ritual and legend, though he would readily admit a mythical matrix for the latter. From his presentation it would appear that he tries to walk a middle path between Scholem and Idel, the former tending to emphasize the radical disjuncture between rabbinic Judaism and Kabbalah (at least on the ques- tion of the appropriateness of myth as a theological category) and the latter stressing the theosophical-mythical elements in rabbinic texts which are to be understood by the latter kabbalistic elaborations. Although Ginsburg cites Idel's position (p. 206, n. 9), I see no evidence from his own work that he would assent fully to the counter-position of Idel. On the contrary, Gins- burg's readings of rabbinic and kabbalistic materials are extremely careful and historically sophisticated, heeding the subtle transformations and trans- mutations that go on in traditional literature. This sensitivity to creative shifts in religious texts is apparent in several of Ginsburg's discussions of Sabbath motifs as developed in early rabbinic sources, pre-kabbalistic mys- tical or midrashic texts, and the Kabbalah proper. Here I will mention two outstanding examples: (1) Sabbath as hieros gamos (see pp. 101-12 1) and (2) the notion of the Sabbath-soul, the neshamah yeterah (pp. 121-136). In sum, it may be said that Ginsburg's analysis is strong on two fronts, the his- torical and the phenomenological. He has managed with great success to present the intricate world of theosophic Kabbalah in terms that will be appreciated by historians of religious thought and anthropology. Specifical- ly, he has appreciably advanced scholarly discussion of kabbalistic ritual, which will have an impact upon our understanding of the religious culture of medieval Jewry. In the second volume, Sod Ha-Shabbat: The Mystery of the Sabbath, Ginsburg has provided a model translation of a medieval kabbalistic text, rendering it in intelligible, readable prose while still preserving the richness and fluidity of the original Hebrew. Special note should be taken of the criti- cal commentary on the text provided by Ginsburg, which is a rich treasure of important sources (many translated into English for the first time) that will serve the needs of the student of Jewish mysticism in particular as well as the more general reader. In both volumes Ginsburg has demonstrated his erudition in several genres of traditional Jewish literature as well as his capa- city to translate that knowledge into contemporary categories of academic discourse.
