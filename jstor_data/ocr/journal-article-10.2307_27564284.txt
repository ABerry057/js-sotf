Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2002. xxii, 240pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000463 This meticulously researched and superbly written book offers a fascinating view into the life of a member of the Moroccan Jewish mercantile elite during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Were it only a biography of the colorful life of Meir Macnin, a scion of a prominent family from Marrakesh and a commercial agent and diplomatic representative of the cAlawid sultans Mawl?y Sulaym?n and Mawl?y cAbd al-Rahm?n, it already would have been a valuable contribution to Jewish and Maghrebi social history. To his credit, however, Daniel J. Schroeter provides a more ambitious and richly textured panorama of wider world events in an axial period of transition when international economic and politi cal balances were shifting, when traditional social structures in both Europe and the Islamic world were being transformed (albeit at radically different tempos), and when relations between Jews and Gentiles and among Jews were being altered. Meir Macnin, who was bom probably in the 1760s and died in 1835, belonged to the elite class of Moroccan Jewish courtier merchants known as the tujj?r al-sult?n (the sultan's merchants). Much scholarly interest has been focused on this group in recent decades, but none of the earlier studies have dealt with a single individual in depth.1 At the height of his career in the 1820s, Macnin was the most important of all the sultan's Jewish agents: He was granted the grandiose title of "Consul and Ambassador to all the Christian Nations" and had the authority to appoint representatives in the European states. As the eighteenth-century Jewish adventurer and poet Samuel Romanelli, who lived in Morocco from 1787 to 1790 and was intimately acquainted with the Jewish merchant courtiers, dramatically pointed out, to be a member of this elite was a mixed and precarious blessing.2 Schroeter offers his own 1.

They never really acted as free agents. Funded by royal loans in cash and kind, living in homes leased by the Makhzan (the Moroccan state), they were subject to the vagaries of the mler's commercial policies, whims, and frequent need for cash. Confiscation of their properly, imprisonment, torture, and execution hung over their heads like a sword of Damocles. The Jewish royal merchants were doubly vulnerable because they were ahl al-dhimma, toler ated minority prot?g?s of the Muslim mler, who often referred to such agents as "Our Jews." Schroeter rightly wams the reader that this appellation should not be taken to mean that they were the sultan's chattel; rather, it was indicative of the personal relationship and mutual bond of responsibility. Like the Jewish factors of the European nobility in the Middle Ages and the court Jews of eighteenth-century central Europe, they were a convenient lightening rod for popular animus during times of social unrest. Using documents from the Macnin family archive, as well as Moroccan and European consular archival records, Schroeter provides a detailed insight into the actual working relationship between the Jewish factotum and his royal master. He also reflects on the broader nature of Judeo-Islamic relations in the Moroccan context, a subject over which a great deal of scholarly ink (and not a little bile) has been spilled. Eschewing simplistic, highly generalized models, Schroeter emphasizes what he dubs the "ambivalence" of Muslim-Jewish relations. Though the relationship was one of dominance and subordination, at the same time, it was one of interdependence. The first chapter of the book provides a good and up-to-date summary of the main lines of this historiographie debate. This book also deals with other interrelationships, including the relationship between Morocco and western Europe and between Moroccan Jewry and the greater Sephardi world. Macnin was not only an intermediary between these worlds (not an unusual role for a member of the non-Muslim minority) but also a cultural commuter who moved between them. From 1800 to about 1817, he resided mainly in England and thereafter in the Moroccan port of Essaouira (Mogador), which was the country's principal outlet for trade with Europe at that time. He continued to travel back and forth between Morocco and Europe until his death in 1835. Macnin began his career when there still was a trans national Sephardi "nation" connected by ties of trade, culture, and marriage. Thus, he was readily accepted into London Sephardi society and was even appointed an officer of the Bevis Marks Synagogue, although he never learned to speak English well and had a rather unsavory reputation for his business prac tices and debts among British Gentiles. Schroeter provides informative vignettes and cameo portraits of other members of the Sephardi mercantile class in England and Morocco and illumi nates the ties that bound them together. Macnin operated within a Sephardi social and economic network that had hubs in London, Amsterdam, Marseilles, Gibraltar, Leghorn, the commercial entrep?ts of North Africa, and the Levant, as well as the New World. However, this Sephardi world order was in decline by the end of Macnin's life.

These very same European Jews, like their Gentile fellow citizens, came to view the Jews of the Muslim world not merely as fellow members of the Sephardi Nation but as "Orientals" who, though still their coreligionists, were not their compatriots. In later generations, they would look on their Oriental brethren as being in need of their philanthropic assistance and guidance to emancipation and regeneration rather than as potential partners for marital and business relations. In Schroeter's view, not only was the traditional transnational relationship between Western and Oriental Sephardim lost, but eventually the traditional relations between Maghrebi Jews and Muslims would be irrevocably altered, too. As European power and ascendancy over Morocco and the greater Islamic world grew, members of the mercantile elite, and then other Jews as well, began turning toward the European nations and their emanci pated Jewries for protection and other benefits. In doing so, Schroeter argues, they actually marginalized themselves even further than under the traditional Islamic social system. Though this is essentially a correct judgment, it requires more clar ification and contexrualization because, stated simply as such, it obscures no less than it clarifies. Perhaps Schroeter will take up this issue in a future study. This book is an important contribution to both Jewish and general history. It is important not merely for students of Sephardi and Islamicate Jewry but to all who study modem Jewish history because it deals alternate paths to Jewish mod ernity than those given preeminence in much of Jewish historiographie narrative.
