Lanham, Md.: University Press of America, 1994. xxvi, 159 pp. This monograph surveys the thought of Rabbi Haim Hirschensohn (1857-1935), a Safed-born theoretician of religious Zionism who served for the last three decades of his life as the rabbi of an Orthodox community in Hoboken, New Jersey. In 1885, Hirschensohn visited relatives in Russia and Germany and came into contact with Wissenschaft des Judentums, an encounter that influenced him for the rest of his life. Upon his return to Eretz Israel, Hirschensohn collaborated with Eliezer Ben-Yehudah and others in reviving Hebrew as a spoken language. In 1901 he left Jerusalem, possibly because he experienced the spiritual atmosphere there as constrictive. In 1903 he settled in the United States, where he combined his rabbinic duties with a literary career that produced over twenty volumes of Hebrew writings in which he combined rabbinic scholarship with original Jewish thought.</page><page sequence="2">438 BOOK REVIEWS Hirschensohn, as portrayed by Eliezer Schweid, was a traditional Ortho- dox rabbi who was not reluctant to engage the issues posed by the emergent Zionist movement or, more generally, the broader challenges to Judaism posed by modernity. As Hirschensohn saw it, Judaism was a national religion which could not survive very long without a communal structure of authority based on the Torah. Prior to the emancipation, this structure was provided by the kahal, through which the community exercised a certain autonomy and bestowed legitimacy on Jewish leadership, lay and.rabbinic. With the disintegration of the kahal structure in modem times, the Zionist enterprise became the necessary substitute. Zionism was the only hope for the survival of communitarian Judaism in the modem period. The Mizrachi, as the Torah-observant presence in the Zionist movement, became Hirschensohn's spiritual home. He apparently did not find it necessary to apologize for his continuing residence in Hoboken. Hirschensohn found it particularly necessary to reconcile the Torah system with the democratic state. The former assumes a people ruled by God, whose authority is not derived from the consent of the governed, while the latter looks to the people as the source of all legitimate authority. How can these two be reconciled? Hirschensohn understood that Zionism was committed to a democratic form of governance and that religious Zionists accepted the principle of majority rule when they chose to enter the Zionist movement. Most Zionists were not Torah observant, but in the light of his deep commitment to the national dimension of Judaism, Hirschensohn believed that the unity of the Jewish people would be gravely threatened by an Orthodox withdrawal into Torah-observant ghettos. So loyalty to Torah had to be combined with respect for the democratic ideal. Hirschensohn found the solution in covenantal theology. "It is one of the basics of our faith," he wrote (quoted by Schweid on p. 49), "that the Holy One, Blessed be He, did not set Himself up as a tyrant over His creatures, and just as He does not want one man to rule over another except for his good, so He would not want to force anyone to observe the commandments against his will nor to enter the Covenant at Sinai ... unless these commandments were accepted willingly." The consent of the governed is therefore not missing in the Torah system. It follows from this that the interpreters of halakhah must take into account the receptivity of the people to their rulings. "The legislator," writes Schweid (p. 72), "may not rule in such a way that most of the people will be unable to accept the ruling and, as noted, Rabbi Hirschensohn went so far as to support the abolition of many prohibitions</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 439 which represented limitations because of the ambience popular in the modem era." Unfortunately, Schweid does not detail the prohibitions to which he is referring. Since the devil is in the details, greater specificity would have been most useful. While the question of Torah and democracy was perhaps Hirschensohn's deepest interest, he devoted himself to a host of other issues as well. He tried to deal with biblical criticism, Torah and secular life, socialism, and the conscience of the individual. Referring to Spinoza (p. 24), Hirschensohn insisted that he ought not to be considered a transgressor because he wrote what was true in his eyes. An error is not a sin if it is made from commitment to the search for truth. We are all entitled to view the truth as we do because beliefs are not voluntarily chosen. Prior to reading this book, I had never heard of Hirschensohn. Eliezer Schweid has rendered us a signal service by introducing the man and his work, particularly now, when significant strains are imposed on the democratic structure of the Jewish state. It would be naive to think that Hirschensohn had the answers to all questions, but it is remarkable that there was an Orthodox Jew who, before his death in 1935, laid out many of the problems that will agitate us for a long time to come. Without endorsing the details of his positions, I am moved by his respect for the opinions of others and his attempt to formulate a Torah position that combines the search for truth with respect for fellow Jews. It is an attitude we need to foster. Michael Wyschogrod University of Houston Houston, Tex.</page></plain_text>
