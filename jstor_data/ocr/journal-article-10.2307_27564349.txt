Haifa: Haifa University Press, 2006. 582 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001189 Gershon Shaked (1929-2006) was among those who shaped the scholarship of modern Hebrew literature in the past forty years. As a professor at Hebrew Univer sity, his influence on his students was formative, and as a scholar, he had a leading role in literary theory and interpretation, introducing into literary analysis new trends and directions. He was a recipient of the Bialik Prize (1986), the Israel Prize for literary scholarship (1992), and the Bahat Award for nonfiction (2004) for the manuscript that was later published as Zehut (Identity). He began his interpre tive writings on leading Hebrew authors and poets by introducing the principles of New Criticism into the critical discourse of the scholarship of modern Hebrew litera ture. But in his five-volume history of modern Hebrew literature, Ha-sipporet ha-'ivrit (Hebrew Narrative Fiction, 1977-98), he broadened his analytical frame work and considered literature in its historical and sociological dimensions as well. Zehut, the last book written by Shaked, represents this shift as he examines the layers of cultural, ethnic, and psychological manifestations in the identity of Jewish authors as they appear in their works. In this book he turns from Hebrew literature to Jewish literature written in European languages, by Jewish authors mostly in central Europe and America. Shaked searches in their texts for the specific features of Jewish literature and the ways in which these writers carved their Jewish identity into their works. A basic assumption in the book is that the primary tendency of Jewish authors who write in non-Jewish languages in exile is assimilation and denial of their Jewish identity. However, facing 211</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews personal and social obstacles, they are driven back to their ethnic roots. Even in America, a more accepting and pluralistic society than Europe, Jewish writers con tinue to deal with subjects central to the Jewish European literature written in German, such as persecution. Zehut, therefore, is a statement about the inescapable ambiguity of Jewish identity in exile. Although this assumption serves Shaked as a general guideline, he recog nizes the complexity of human identity. Addressing the ambiguities of Jewish identity and dealing with a broad range of authors, Shaked formulates a system of categories, divisions, and subdivisions that is not consistent at all times, nor logical, exposing the inability to harness human identity into a single mold. Shaked bases his definition of Jewish literature on the respective author's self-awareness: "Jewish literature is any literature in any language written by authors who were aware of being Jewish" (27). He initially classifies Jewish litera ture into three groups: A. Literature written in a Jewish language (Hebrew, Yiddish) by European Jewish writers, such as S. J. Agnon, and Sholem Aleichem. B. Literature in other languages about Jewish subjects written by European and American Jewish authors such as Cynthia Ozick, Philip Roth and Imre Kertesz. C. Universal literature, written by Jewish writers who transcended their eth nicity to become universal writers, dealing with general human themes, without excluding Jewish subjects and protagonists, such as Franz Kafka and Saul Bellow. But then this division is insufficient and does not embrace the diversity of Jewish literature. Literary history seems to play havoc with any such categorical consideration. In order to accommodate the vicissitudes of time and society, Shaked supplements the first three sections with two more: D. Holocaust literature by Jewish authors who write in Hebrew and Euro pean languages. Among them are Naomi Frankel, Primo Levi, Aharon Appelfeld, Jurek Becker, Ida Fink, and David Grossman. Shaked subdi vides this section into conventional literature which adopts the model of Holocaust myths of the victims perceived as tragic rebels or martyrs, with narratives of redemption, rebellion and revival. And the less con ventional works where the writers deal with complicated issues such as denial of reality by the victims or representation of a grotesque reality by literary means. Yet these authors too, are still trapped in the trauma of the Holocaust experience, unable to work it through with their texts. E. Deviating from the professed goal of the book, Shaked adds four German authors who dealt with the post-Holocaust image of the Jew in Germany as the "other". These writers are Gregor von Rezzori, Ingeborg Day, Bernard Schlink and W. G. Sebald. 212</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Within the first four broad divisions, Shaked delineates the themes, charac ters, cultural dimensions, discourses, and historical events that shape the identity of Jewish literature. Common themes in Jewish literature are Hurban, Holocaust, Diaspora, redemption, and Zionism. These themes occur either in realistic or in symbolic modes. Similarly, the blood libel, persecution, guilt, and the breakdown of traditional Jewish family life are the backbone of Jewish novels and short stories. Shaked analyzes these themes in the writings of S. J. Agnon, Jacob Was serman, Bernard Malamud, Philip Roth, Cynthia Ozick, Sholem Aleichem, and others. At the center of Jewish narratives are typical Jewish characters such as the immigrant, the refugee, the survivor, the biblical Job, and the reliable wife with the adventurous husband. At times, these typical characters are not identified as Jewish. According to Shaked, the character of K in Kafka's The Castle represents with an ironic twist "the chosen" Jewish people with no legal rights in the world. Jewish literature is permeated with descriptions of Jewish life: rituals and prayers, customs, foodways and dietary laws, the synagogue and its liturgy, and religious objects. For Jewish writers, these serve as readymade features that ident ify the culture of their protagonists. In order to bridge the information gap between the authors and the readers, some, such as Joseph Roth, even go so far as to provide a running commentary and notes to assist the German or the assimilated Jewish reader in understanding the significance of these cultural symbols. A hidden dimension in Jewish literature written in European languages is its intertexruality. The authors draw on Jewish speech, such Yiddish proverbs, bibli cal narratives and myths, and talmudic legends and figures that are part and parcel of Jewish daily discourse. Shaked examines these literary dimensions in the German writings of Joseph Roth and the American writings of Henry Roth. Finally, an important aspect providing identity to Jewish literature is Jewish history. The persecutions, the blood libel, and the Holocaust shaped Jewish litera ture as much as they shaped Jewish historical destiny. Writers such as Heinrich Heine, Wasserman, and Malamud used or alluded to blood libels. As a people living in the Diaspora, the relations between European Jewish com munities and the rulers of their countries have played a major part in the lives of Jewish writers and their texts. Agnon, Kafka and Joseph Roth were born in the Habsburg empire under Emperor Franz Josef, who was seen by many Jews as a paternal figure and pro tector. Shaked examines the effects of this similar background on all three writers. The themes, the characters, the mythic patterns, culture, and history become the identifying features of Jewish literature. They recur, as Shaked demonstrates, even in the works of those universal writers who have transcended their ethnic boundaries. For example, Kafka's The Castle is built on the classical Sisyphus myth of doomed, repeated failure. But Shaked interprets the story as the Jewish repeated historical failure to be accepted in the Gentile world of exile. Reversely, in her novel The Shawl, Ozick tells a Holocaust trauma story but extends it into a universal narrative of the individual solution that is intimacy or love. Zehut can be perceived as a counterstory and a complementary to the Zionist narrative in Hebrew literature, in the sense that it focuses on writers who did not adopt the Zionist solution to the Jewish conditions in the Diaspora, as Avner 213</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews Holtzman suggests.1 But it is so in a limited sense. In the final analysis, Shaked remains fully committed to the Zionist story. The ambiguities and conflicts that he perceives in Jewish literature in European languages are analytical observations that could be made only from a perspective on Israel as the ultimate and exclusive place of Jewish culture and identity formation.
