Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1998. 262 pp. Fields such as Jewish cultural history and women's studies, where interest in nineteenth-century Berlin Jewish literary salon society continues to grow, con- verge at the emblematic example of Rahel Levin Varnhagen. Heidi Thomann Tewarson's new biography, Rahel Levin Varnhagen: The Life and Work of a Ger- man Jewish Intellectual, is the first to address the English reader since Hannah Arendt's recently reissued Rahel Varnhagen: The Life of a Jewess, originally pub- lished in 1957. As such, Tewarson has incorporated the most up-to-date research on this figure and period, otherwise available almost solely in German. Arendt's work has traditionally been read as part biography and part autobiography-as much about identification and coming to terms with Jewish identity as a German Jewish woman intellectual in 1930s Berlin as it is about the salon period. Tewar- son has taken a different tack. Rather than focusing on the life of a Jewess per se, Tewarson is interested in the work of an intellectual. What constitutes the legiti- mate, creative work of an intellectual? And can the term itself be gender-free? These questions, though necessarily tied to Rahel's place outside the literary and cultural mainstream, serve as the main thrust of the book. Born in 1771, Rahel Varnhagen was a Jewish salon hostess in Berlin at the turn of the nineteenth century, a specialist in what she called the art of sociability. Founder of the cult of Goethe, she also befriended early Romantics like the Schlegel brothers and "Young Germans" like Heine. The first three volumes of her letters appeared posthumously in 1834 and were read by many of her contempo- raries, both in Germany and abroad. Her correspondence, published selectively throughout the nineteenth century, ultimately reached ten volumes' when the 1980 discovery of her unpublished letters and diaries, thought to be lost in World War II,2 stimulated even more interest and new publications. Tewarson makes a strong case for the expansion of the literary canon to in- 1. This collection, which reprints the initial three volumes and the nineteenth-century publica- tions together, is called Rahel-Bibliothek. Rahel Varnhagen, Gesammelte Werke.

The crux of the matter rests on whether Rahel ever intended to publish her collected letters (she only published letters infrequently and anonymously during her lifetime). Rahel's collected works comprise her volumes of dialogic correspondences, diaries, and aphorisms. These are the recorded places where she attempted to capture the ephemeral moment of social conversation, which she viewed as her chief artistic endeavor. Though gener- ic categories cannot contain her writings-epistolary exchanges, autobiographi- cal essays, current arts and letters reviews, and philosophical observations-one nevertheless wonders at the latitude accorded other generic innovators (such as Schlegel) and denied her. If authority and legitimacy could simply not be claimed by a Jewish woman at that time, this would intriguingly suggest that a revision of Rahel's literary contribution and canonical status is at long last possible. Tewarson aims to show explicitly that "Rahel thought of herself as an author, that she was intent on having her writings published, and that she held very specific views with regard to the form these publications should take" (p. 9). By raising the issue of a self-aware, self-reflective author, concerned for the character she creates in her self-presentations and conscious that these moments of writing and dialogue will and are intended to go beyond the sphere of private communication, Tewarson ral- lies to the defense of Rahel's oeuvre as literary. In addition to confirming Rahel's authorship, this helps dispel the myth that her husband, K. A. Varnhagen, was the primary force behind Rahel: Ein Buch des Andenkensfiir ihre Freunde, which ap- peared a scant four months after her death. Tewarson's organization of material is largely chronological. She begins by describing the Berlin Jewish community of the 1770s through the 1790s and situ- ating Rahel's personal commitment to Bildung within the context of the general education of Jewish women of the period. She then proceeds through the first sa- lon, presenting Rahel's youthful correspondence with Davit Veit, Gustav von Brinkmann, and Friedrich Gentz, along with more general discussions of love let- ters and correspondence with women friends; moves on to the Napoleonic period of rupture; follows with the dreary, reactionary period of 1814-19, which culmi- nates in the "Hep! Hep!" riots; and concludes with Rahel's second salon. Along the way, Tewarson provides both extensive citation and thoughtful analysis. The section on the Napoleonic era offers an interpretive tour-de-force, featuring quotations appearing for the first time in translation from Rahel's previ- ously unpublished dream diary of 1812.3 Tewarson shows that "Rahel's ideal con- sisted of a vision oriented toward life, joy, and harmonious human interaction rather than an objectified, autonomous work of art" (p. 136). Interpreting Rahel's second dream, Tewarson argues that "life and art appear inextricably linked: the artists are the works of art, and the ideal is symbolized by the dancing couple rather than the motionless and somewhat reluctant model on a pedestal. ... The art of so- ciability, represented in the dream by the dancing couple, appears not as the sub- terfuge of a talented woman restricted by virtue of being female but as open and equal in significance to any artist's oeuvre" (p. 136). 3.

There, in view of her completed sketch of Rahel's career and life, Tewarson rewardingly synthesizes Ra- hel's views on a range of subjects that preoccupied her throughout her lifetime, which Tewarson groups under such suggestive subheadings as "Gender and Writ- ing," "The Life of the Mind," "The Woman Question," "Jewish Matters," and "The Perfectibility of the World." Heidi Thomann Tewarson's new biography of Rahel Levin Varnhagen will appeal to scholars of European, Jewish, and women's history as well as to those closest to Rahel in spirit: literary connoisseurs, history buffs, and enlightened read- ers. It is a well-written, well-rounded, compelling, and ultimately essential place to begin a study of this exemplary personage and period. Judith M.
