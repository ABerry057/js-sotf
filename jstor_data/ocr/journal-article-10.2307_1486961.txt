<plain_text><page sequence="1">Samuel Romanelli. Travail in an Arab Land. Translated from Hebrew %ith an Introduction and Notes by Yedida K. Stillman and Norman A. Stillman. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1989. xiii, 222 pp. In the late 1970s, while researching the Jewish communities of eight- eenth and nineteenth-century Morocco, I came across a bibliographical reference to a translation, by Solomon Schiller-Szinessy, of Romanerli's noted Hebrew account of his four-year stay in Morocco in the late eigh- teenth century, Massd' Ba'arav. Schiller-Szinessy had published an edition of Romanelli's book in Cambridge in 1886, and planned to publish an Eng-</page><page sequence="2">322 BOOK REVIEWS lish translation, which was scheduled to appear in 1887 as the sequel to the Hebrew volume. On a trip to Cambridge in search of the translation, it soon became apparent that an English edition had in fact never been published. Unbeknownst to me at the time, Professors Yedida and Norman Stillman had also ascertained that a translation had never been done, and themselves decided to undertake the painstaking task, Their translation reads remark- ably well, especially considering the intricacies of the classical Hebrew text, which is interspersed with words and phrases from colloquial Moroccan Arabic. The Stillmans' work not only reflects their nuanced understanding of Romanelli's Hebrew style, but shows their intimate knowledge of the lan- guage and culture of Moroccan Jewry. The edition is richly annotated, drawing from the Stillmans' previous studies on Morocco, as well as some of their personal experiences in the country. Throughout the text, Romanelli makes constant scriptural and literary allusions. Many of these were annotated by J. H. Schirmann in his 1968 edi- tion of Massd' Ba'arav (found in his collection of Romanelli's writings, Ketdvfm Nivbdarim). The Stillmans' work, however, supersedes Schirmann's in its accuracy, and its many annotations offer new insights on Moroccan culture that are not found in Schirmann's edition. A few misprints of dates which might confuse the reader should be not- ed: Schiller-Szinessy's edition of Massd' Ba'arav appeared in 1886 and not in 1866 (p. x); and Mazagan was abandoned by the Portuguese in 1769 and not in 1739 (pp. 193-194, n. 12). I would like to make a few additional com- ments on the already excellent annotations provided by the Stillmans. Regarding Romanelli's description of coins (p. 71), the silver and gold mith- qdl were disappearing in the late eighteenth century, and term mithqdl was increasingly being used exclusively as a unit of account. Romanelli refers to another coin, the zalfb, which I would suggest is colloquial for the zaldght (pl. zawdligh, tdzaldgh in Tamazight, the Middle Atlas Berber dialect),' a bronze coin worth one-twelfth of a fils (the suggestion that Romanelli was referring to the qirdt [p. 181, n. 21] seems less plausible). On comments regarding 'dr (p. 198, n. 43), E. Westermarck was mistaken when he referred to 'dr as meaning "curse."2 1.

As an accomplished poet, translator, and linguist, Romanelli was able to travel and live in numerous European countries, finding patrons and employers wherever he went. Travail in an Arab Land begins in 1786, when Romanelli traveled from Gibraltar to Morocco, accompanying a local merchant on a business trip. Through his resourcefulness he was able to make a living in Morocco as a Spanish teacher and a preacher, and he also found employment with a number of influential Jewish merchants, spending periods of time in Tangier, Tetuan, Meknes, Marrakesh, and Mogador (which is today called Essaouira, according to its Arabic name). Romanelli describes his numerous adventures--each time that he courts danger, he is able, through his wit and considerable cunning, to extricate himself from a precarious position. The period of Sultan Mawlay Yazid, following the death of Sultan Sidi Muh.ammad b. 'Abdallah in 1790, was marked by a gen- eral breakdown in order, and the Jews in particular were subject to persecu- tion. Romanelli was in Mogador when news reached the town of the pillag- ing of the Jewish quarter of Tetuan, and he was able to escape Morocco at this time. The reader is invited to experience the tense unfolding of events as the author recounts his various close calls. In many respects, Romanelli's book is typical of a genre of travelogues about the Maghreb by Europeans in the eighteenth century. It reflects the way in which an "enlightened" Europe viewed what it saw as a much less civilized region. His perceptions of the indigenous inhabitants are almost always negative and disparaging. The Jews of Morocco are also seen as being less civilized, obscurantist, and affected, as it were, by the environ- ment. Romanelli has a condescending attitude toward Moroccan Jewish culture, in many ways not dissimilar to that of contemporary European observers. But at the same time, Romanelli's account is distinct from Euro- pean travelogues. More than other travelers and foreign residents who wrote about their experiences, Romanelli was able to penetrate the Moroc- can Jewish cultural milieu as a kind of participant. His text contains intri- cate details of the customs of Morocco and the Moroccan Jewish communi- ties in particular. Descriptions of dress, marriage customs, religious rituals, superstitions, architecture, markets, the Moroccan dialect, etc., are among the best available for the eighteenth century. What is especially unique in his account is his critical portait of members of the Jewish courtier class and merchant elite, which gives an insiders' picture of a world which is nowhere else, to my knowledge, described so incisively.</page><page sequence="4">324 BOOK REVIEWS Romanelli's account of Morocco paints an extremely dismal picture of the position of Jews in Moroccan society. Not only were the Jews subject to some of the humiliating proscriptions imposed on the dhimmi, but they were also forced to do corv6e labor. The final part of the book describes in lurid detail the violent persecution of the Jews during the interregnum. At the conclusion of his book, Romanelli tells the reader: "If anyone tells you bad things about events in Morocco, multiply what you have heard, and you will not go wrong. If what you are told is good, do not believe it unless you can see it with your own eyes!" (p. 150). Romanelli's disparaging view of Morocco and Moroccan Jewish culture can also be understood as expressing the attitude of a westernized European Jewish scholar steeped in the rationalist culture of the Haskalah. He mea- sures his own cultural standards against the culture of Moroccan Jews and is critical of their customs, superstitions, and level of learning. Despite his harsh criticism, there is a richness of ethnographic detail which, through the help of the Stillmans' annotations, opens a window on the world of Moroc- can Jewry. Massd' Ba'ardv is also of intrinsic interest for its innovative use of the Hebrew language, and is perhaps unprecedented in its lucid descriptive style. This highly successful translation gives the reader a sense of the flow- ing narration of the original Hebrew text. It not only provides invaluable information on Moroccan Jewry in the late eighteenth century, but contri- butes to our understanding of the first period of the Hebrew Haskalah in Europe. Daniel J.
