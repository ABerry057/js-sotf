<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON THE ORIGINS OF THE OFFICE OF HEAD OF THE JEWS IN THE FATIMID EMPIRE by MARK R. COHEN Princeton University I Students of medieval Near Eastern Jewish history have long recognized the immediate relevance of Islamic legal sources delineating the status of dhimmis (i.e., all non-Muslim protected peoples) to understanding the posi- tion of Jews in Islamic domains.' Jews are rarely singled out in the sources NOTE: This paper was read at the Association for Jewish Studies Regional Conference on "Aspects of Jewish Life under Islam" held at Ohio State University, May 16-17, 1976 and made possible by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The research reported in it was partly supported by grants from the National Foundation for Jewish Culture and the Princeton University Committee on Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences. 1.

For instance, the extant versions of the so-called Pact of 'Umar, the document which spells out the obligations and privileges of the dhimmr communities, specify Chris- tians as the recipients. Hence inferences about the position of the Jews in Islamic law have perforce had to be drawn from records referring to dhimmis in general, or to Christians in particular. In a similar vein, attention has properly been paid to the fact that such documents as the important Cali- phal charter for a twelfth-century Nestorian Catholicos, head of the princi- pal Christian denomination in the eastern Islamic lands, shed light on the administrative relationship between the Islamic state and the Jewish minority.2 On the other hand, little consideration has been given to the comparative value of sources relating to the inner life of the Christian communities living in the medieval Muslim orbit. To a large degree, this is because Jewish his- torians, rightly convinced of the essential autochthony of Jewish communal institutions, have not deemed Oriental Christianity directly pertinent to their concerns. Perhaps, too, the knowledge that in medieval Europe Judaism was subjugated by the Church has obscured the fact that, in the medieval Islamic world, Jews and Christians were brethren in their minority status, enduring identical statutory disabilities, suffering equally from periodic oppressive enforcement of these measures, and living in self- governing communities which constituted something like minority states within a state. It should be noted, too, that historians of Eastern Christian- ity, being primarily interested in questions of doctrine, faith, and liturgy, have not produced a significant literature on the internal politics of the Oriental denominations from which Jewish historians might have gained some comparative insight. In fact, the broad autonomy which Muslim rulers conceded to the pro- tected minorities encouraged the growth of complex systems of Jewish and Christian self-government with many parallel institutional features.3 There is good reason, therefore, to expect the comparative study of non-Muslim communities to yield fruitful results in selected areas. 2.

Under Islam, the government recognized the Patriarch of Alexan- dria, whose office went back to early Christian times, as the head of the Egyptian-Christian, or Coptic, minority. His Jewish counterpart from some time in the Fatimid period (969-1171) until the Ottoman conquest of Egypt at the beginning of the sixteenth century was a dignitary known in Arabic as the Ra'is al-Yahfid, "Head of the Jews." Controversy shrouds the origins of the office of Head of the Jews because scholars have tended to confuse the institution with the Hebrew title of Nagid, "Prince," by which the Heads were consistently known after the Fatimid period, and because the Jewish sources which shed light on the genesis of the office are contradictory. The principal historical account of the origins of the "Nagidate" is found in the Hebrew chronicle of the seventeenth-century Egyptian- Jewish historian, Joseph b. Isaac Sambari.4 A somewhat shorter version of the same event exists in a legal responsum issued by the chief rabbi of Cairo in the first half of the sixteenth century, R. David Ibn Abi Zimra.5 This fanciful and stereotypic story attributes the installation of the first Egyptian Nagid to a request by an Abbasid princess, the new bride of a Fatimid Caliph of Egypt, that her husband import from Iraq a Jew of Davidic de- scent to rule over the Jews of Egypt in the manner of the Babylonian Exilarch, that scion of the house of King David whom the Abbasids recog- nized as the chief of Jewry in their realm.6 The tradition preserved in these late sources finds apparent support in the description of Paltiel b. Shepha- tiah, the trusted retainer of the Fatimid conqueror of Egypt, al-Mu'izz, which is found in the famous Megilla, or Chronicle, of Ah.imaaS (completed in 1054). This hagiographic portrait of Abimaa?'s ancestor characterizes 4. Adolph Neubauer, ed., Mediaeval Jewish Chronicles, 2 vols. (Oxford, 1887-95), 1: 115-17. 5. David b.

The legendary character of Sambari's story was convincingly demonstrated by David Neustadt (Ayalon), "Some Problems concerning the 'Negidut' in Egypt during the Middle Ages" [Hebrew], Zion 4 (1938-39): 126-34. The motif of a Jewish noble summoned by a gentile ruler and invested with authority over a Jewish community in his realm appears in other medieval Jewish "religious foundation stories"; see Abraham Ibn Daud, Sefer ha-Qabbalah, ed. and trans.

COHEN Paltiel as the leader of Fatimid Jewry and associates the title "Nagid" with his name in three places.7 The hitherto prevalent hypothesis about the origins of the Nagidic office, as characteristically formulated by Jacob Mann over a half century ago, rests on the Sambari-Ibn Abi Zimra narrative and on the memorial pane- gyric to Paltiel. It states that the Fatimids founded the institution shortly after conquering Egypt in 969 as part of their well-known anti-Abbasid foreign policy. From his new capital of Cairo, the Fatimid sovereign decided to appoint a chief over the local Jewish minority who would receive the homage formerly paid to the Exilarch in Abbasid Baghdad.8 Voluminous data on Jewish self-government in Fatimid Egypt is avail- able in the documents and letters emanating from the Cairo Geniza-that precious hoard of discarded papers which has been so profitably exploited by Jewish scholars since its retrieval from a medieval synagogue in Old Cairo at the end of the nineteenth century. Information on the office of Head of the Jews in these records contradicts the prevalent hypothesis. As S. D. Goitein has shown, prior to the emergence of the prominent court physician and Nagid Judah b. Saadya in the 1060s, fully a century after the Fatimid conquest, neither the title of Nagid nor a person exercising his powers appears in the Geniza records for Egypt. In addition to this reveal- ing silence, positive Geniza evidence proves that originally the Fatimids recognized the Gaon, or head, of the Jerusalem yeshiva as chief of the Jews in their empire. In the light of these findings, Goitein has argued that the office of Head of the Jews did not come into being until the final third of the eleventh century and that it arose, not to serve the interests of the Fatimid state, but rather to replace the Palestinian Gaonate, which entered a precipi- tous decline in the seventh decade of the eleventh century.9 7.

Certainly that is one of the reasons why, persuasive as the theory is, especially with regard to its compelling chronological findings, it has met with resistance among adherents of the older hypothesis, who, clinging tenaciously to a "kernel of truth" in the Sambari saga, have continued to defend the admittedly plausible reconstruc- tion which places initiative squarely in the hands of the Fatimid conquerors of Egypt in the middle of the tenth century.'0 Reconciliation between these conflicting approaches to the problem of the origins of the office of Head of the Jews might be achieved by consider- ing Fatimid political history during the latter part of the eleventh century and the early years of the twelfth. Islamic sources reveal that the very decades which witnessed the erosion of the Palestinian academy and the rise of the Headship of the Jews saw dramatic changes in the Fatimid setting-a decade and a half of economic hardship (including a debilitating seven-year long famine), political anarchy, and imperial attrition in the 1060s and early 1070s, followed by a dictatorship of the strong-armed military viziers, Badr al-Jamali (1074-94), and his son, al-Afdal (1094-1121)." It is not unlikely that external events and the attitude of the rulers of Egypt had some effect on the central administration of Jewish affairs. For instance, as is well known, when the conquering Seljuk Turks ended the nominal Fatimid con- trol over the province of Syria-Palestine in 1071, the leadership of the Pales- tinian yeshiva was compelled to flee from Jerusalem to Tyre. In this con- nection, it has not been previously noted that a year earlier the important commercial port of Tyre had successfully divested itself of Fatimid domina- tion. Indeed, from 1071 until 1089, under the rule of a local family of qadis, 10. See Eliyahu Ashtor, "Some Features of the Jewish Communities in Medieval Egypt" [Hebrew], Zion 30 (1965): 141-47; H. Z.

"Nagid": "Most scholars accept the view that the first nagid of Egyptian Jewry was Paltiel, an Italian Jew who was brought to Egypt by al-Mu'izz, the Fati- mid conqueror of Egypt (969), and was part of the ruler's officialdom .. .; it stands to reason that the Shi'ite Fatimids, who decreed themselves caliphs, did not wish to depend in any way upon the Sunnite Abbasid caliphs, preferring to appoint a separate head for the Jews under their ruler, rather than have them acknowledge the authority of the Babylonian exilarch, an official who was part of the Abbasid hierarchy." 11.

COHEN the seacoast town maintained its independence from Cairo while paying tribute to the occupying Seljuk rulers.12 Presumably the removal of the Palestinian Gaonate to rebellious Tyre had some effect on Fatimid thinking about the location and structure of Jewish central government. III We are in a somewhat better position to assess the impact of current events on minority self-government during this period thanks to the availa- bility of an extremely valuable source pertaining to the Egyptian-Christian community: the Christian-Arabic chronicle of the lives of the Coptic Patriarchs, Ta'rtkh baldrika al-kanmsa al-migriyya, the History of the Patriarchs of the Egyptian Church.'3 Begun in the late tenth century by the prolific bishop of Ashmunayn, Sawirus (Severus) Ibn al-Muqaffa' (d. between 979 and 1003), who traced the history of the Patriarchal office down to the year 880, the work was resumed by continuators in the eleventh century.'14 Information for the second half of the eleventh and the first three decades of the twelfth centuries is particularly rich and reliable. The com- piler of the vitae of Patriarchs Christodulos (1074-77) and Cyril II (1078-92) was a contemporary of theirs, an Alexandrian deacon named Mawhfib Ibn Manfir. Mawhfib was a retainer of Christodulos'5 and also had reliable informants for both his and Cyril's reigns.'6 For the period 1092 to 1128, comprising the Patriarchates of Michael IV (1092-1102) and Macarius II (1102-28), we have the words of another eyewitness, John Ibn Sa'id al-Qulzumi, who was intimately involved in church politics of the 12.

Ibn al-Qulzumi, who had also been close to Patriarchs Christo- dulos and Cyril II, even glossed the "history" of Mawhob Ibn ManSar in a few places, adding supplementary direct testimony to certain events." Data from these contemporary accounts of the vicissitudes of the Coptic Patri- archate in the last part of the eleventh and the beginning of the twelfth cen- turies offer valuable clues as to the external circumstances surrounding the establishment of the new office of Head of the Jews and, at the same time, provide indirect corroboration of the late eleventh century dating of the origins of this institution."' Through the eyes of Mawhob Ibn Manfir and John Ibn $S'id we learn that the decades between about 1050 and 1130 witnessed an historic trans- formation in the ruling institution of the Coptic church. External and internal factors precipitated the change. Until the middle of the eleventh century, the Patriarch governed the Egyptian church from his ancient seat in Alexandria, the center of Egyptian Christianity. In the reign of Christo- dulos, however, the Patriarch abandoned Alexandria for Cairo as a result of a concatenation of crises. Early in his reign, Christodulos fled from Alexandria to Damrfi, a city in the Delta, following an unsuccessful coup by some bishops.'9 During the 1050s, deteriorating relations with the Fatimid vizier al-Ydaziri (1050-58) created a new set of problems for the head of the Coptic minority. Accused of ordering the King of Nubia, a country under his ecumenical sway, to suspend tribute payments to the Fatimid Caliph, the Patriarch was for a time imprisoned.20 Then, in 1057, a general persecution of Copts erupted when a vindictive qadi libeled the Patriarch before the vizier, claiming that the new Coptic capital in Damri constituted an osten- tatious affront to Islam.21 Yazfiri's passage from the scene in 1058 did not lessen Christodulos's tribulations. During the Fatimid crisis of the 1060s, law and order broke down in the Egyptian Delta under the weight of raids by marauding Lewiti 17. Ibid., pp. 369-70; 31: 12; cf. below n. 42.

In the absence of a substantial modern treatment of the political vicissitudes of the Coptic minority under the Fatimid Caliphs, the narrative presented below has had to be recon- structed directly from the primary source. Reflecting in 1968 on the state of Coptic historical scholarship, Aziz S. Atiya (A History of Eastern Christianity [London, 1968], pp. 14-15) com- mented: "On the whole, it may be said at this juncture that the definitive and comprehensive history of the Coptic church is still pending. Its source material is only partly published, and Coptic archaeological research is in its infancy." 19. Patriarchs, 23: 260-62. 20. Ibid., pp. 263-64. 21. Ibid., pp. 267-71, 303-4.

The large Coptic population of the Lower Egyptian countryside-the Rif-suffered particularly severely. Their farmlands were plundered, Coptic monasteries were pillaged, and monks were ruthlessly massacred.22 Patriarch Christodulos himself was kidnapped and cruelly tortured.23 Instilled with an understandable sense of insecurity, the Patriarch abandoned Damri for the relative safety of the Egyptian capital.24 His move took place around 1070, as we are able to infer on the basis of allusions to datable Islamic events.2s Though this change of venue would appear to have been intended only as a temporary expedient, it was soon converted into permanent reality as a result of outside pressures. At the close of 1073, not long after Christodulos had arrived in Old Cairo, Badr al-Jamili was summoned to the Fatimid capital from his post as military governor of Acre in Palestine to restore order to the tottering Fatimid Caliphate. After swiftly liquidating the sources of anarchy, Badr held on to the reins of power and ruled autocratically but effectively until his death in 1094.26 The Coptic hierarchy was deeply affected by the authoritarian regime of 22.

The History of the Patriarchs (23: 312-13) describes an attempted coup against Patriarch Christodulos which was perpetrated by a monk named Jacob. The latter is said to have solicited and obtained the support of NdSir al-Dawla Ibn Iamddn, the strong-armed commander-in-chief of the Turkish regiment in the Fatimid army who virtually ruled in the Egyptian capital beginning in 1067. In 1069 internecine conflict within the Turkish ranks forced NaSir al-Dawla to flee to Alexandria, where he openly rebelled against the Caliphate; see al-Maqrizi, Itti'd; al-bunafd', ed. Jamil al-Din al-Shayydl, 3 vols. (Cairo, 1967-73), 2: 275-76, 278-97, 302-3; Ibn Muyassar, Akhbdr Migr (Annales d'Egypte), ed. Henri Mass6 (Cairo, 1919), pp. 17-20. According to our Egyptian-Christian source, the would-be usurper, the monk Jacob, died in Alexandria while awaiting the arrival of NaSir al-Dawla Ibn H.amddn "so that he [i.e., Ndsir] might do for him [i.e., Jacob] what he had promised him" (Patriarchs, 23: 313). Shortly thereafter the Muslim general reached Alexandria, where "his position became so great that he was addressed as our lord al-Nasir" (ibid.), an allusion to his open rebellion in 1069 in the port city. Two paragraphs later the Coptic chronicler returns to his main subject: "As regards the father Christodulos, he went, after the death of Abba Jacob, the monk, to [Old] Cairo and remained there a long time until the honored Amir al-Juyfish [i.e., Badr al-Jamili] arrived in Egypt from Acre" (ibid., p. 314). Since Badr-al-Jamali reached Egypt at the end of 1073 (Ibn Muyassar, pp. 22-23), we may confidently fix the date of Patriarch Christodulos's arrival in the Egyptian capital around 1070. 26.

A startling instance of Fatimid intervention in inner ecclesi- astical affairs occurred in 1086. Responding to a petition to resolve a fac- tional dispute in the church, Badr commanded the Patriarch and the Egyptian bishops to assemble in the capital. The resulting conclave had the appearance of a veritable synod. The vizier summoned the delegates to his residence outside the capital and upbraided them for quarreling among themselves. He then ordered them to prepare canons for his perusal, evi- dently meaning to use them in adjudicating the conflict. Each of the rival factions dutifully withdrew to formulate its precepts. However, when they reconvened at the vizier's residence, Badr, apparently no longer interested in the details of their dissension, dismissed them with a curt exhortation to make peace and to abide by the canons they had just compiled.27 In fact, the set of ordinances drawn up by the Patriarch Cyril at Badr al-Jamali's insti- gation was subsequently incorporated into Coptic Canon Law.28 Foreign difficulties provided added pretext for Badr al-Jamali's invasion of the preserve of Coptic self-government. During his administration, Egypt was faced with anti-Muslim aggression in the tributary kingdoms of Nubia and Abyssinia, Monophysite lands ruled ecclesiastically by the Coptic Patriarch. In 1076, for example, Badr received word that the Metropolitan of the Nubian church, an appointee of Christodulos, had destroyed a mosque. In retaliation, the vizier had the Patriarch incarcerated and only released him when the charge was shortly thereafter proven false.29 Evidently anticipating, or perhaps responding to, rebelliousness in Christian Abyssinia, Badr once pressured Christodulos's succesor, Cyril II, to consecrate as Metropolitan of the Ethiopian church a candidate named Severus, who had promised the vizier that he would maintain a flow of gifts to the Fatimid court and encourage the Abyssinian king to be loyal to Cairo.30 Subsequently, the brother of Metropolitan Severus arrived in Cairo with a present which failed to satisfy the vizier. Badr swiftly sum- moned Patriarch Cyril and held him accountable for this breach of good faith, notwithstanding the protestations of the Patriarch's ecclesiastical sec- retary that the incumbent Metropolitan had been appointed by command of 27.

Another problem in the south, reported attacks on Egyp- tian merchants traveling through the Ethiopian realm, particularly dis- turbed the vizier. Accordingly, he demanded that the Patriarch use his influence to put an end to such hostile acts.3' Badr al-Jamali's interventionist relationship toward the Coptic Patriarch derived in part from principles inherent in general Islamic policy toward the dhimmts. Respectful conduct toward Muslims and Islam was one of the key obligations which the Pact of 'Umar imposed upon the protected peoples.32 Indeed, long before Badr al-Jamali arrived on the scene, the Fatimid authorities had translated this requirement into a responsibility of the Gaon of Jerusalem, one written into his governmental letter of appoint- ment.33 At the same time, however, Badr's unusually direct intervention in ecclesiastical affairs doubtless had an immediate, pragmatic motivation. Following more than a decade of domestic anarchy and foreign crisis, the man who single-handedly had restored order out of chaos was naturally anxious to exploit every opportunity to discourage discord at home, even among his Christian subjects, and to exploit the ecumenical power of the Coptic Patriarchate to check anti-Muslim sentiments abroad. A by-product of the vizier's pragmatic politics was the permanent estab- lishment of the Coptic Patriarchate in the Egyptian capital. Mawhib Ibn Manfir relates the following about Patriarch Cyril II: "He used to long to live in the Rif [i.e., the lower Egyptian countryside] but was not able [to do so] on account of the many messengers traveling to and from the lands of Abyssinia and Nubia, and because the Sultan [i.e., Badr al-Jamali] required that he should present himself to him at all times."34 Elsewhere, MawhCib records that, before leaving the Egyptian capital to consecrate new churches in the Rif, Cyril had first to obtain the permission (istidhdn) of the vizier.35 Mawhib's reliable testimony indicates that the permanent emplacement of the Patriarchate in Cairo had its roots in Fatimid policy and, at the same 31.

"Sultan" is used explicitly of the vizier Badr al-Jamili, e.g., ibid., p. 337 (cf. p. 33). This Coptic usage provides additional support to D. S. Richards's con- tention that the title "Sultan" in a petition to the Fatimids from the monks of St. Catherine's monastery in the Sinai peninsula refers to the vizier, rather than to the Caliph, reflecting popular parlance; D.

After arriving in Cairo around 1070, ecumeni- cal contracts between the Coptic Patriarch and his Monophysite daughter churches to the south increased. Badr al-Jamili encouraged this growth in diplomatic activity in the interests of Fatimid foreign policy. Evidently wish- ing to institutionalize this new-found procedure for negotiating with Nubia and Abyssinia, the vizier made the Coptic Patriarch a regular member of the Fatimid court and, thereby, forced him to take up his permanent abode in Cairo. As a result, the Patriarchal office became dissociated from provincial Alexandria and increasingly tied to the center of Egyptian government. Under Badr al-Jamili's son and successor, al-Af4al, the Patriarchate became irreversibly wedded to its new domicile. The viceroy took steps to assure this development. In 1102, the newly-chosen Patriarch Macarius II was about to depart from Cairo for Alexandria to participate in the tradi- tional consecration ceremony in the ancient Patriarchal See. He appeared before al-Af4al in the company of a prominent Coptic government official who, pleading poverty on behalf of the Patriarch, received from the vizier an exemption for the holy father from the taxes traditionally collected by the governor of Alexandria from each new Patriarch.36 Obviously, Macarius felt entitled to this relief since he no longer resided in the port city. For his part, al-Af4al was doubtless inclined to grant the petitioner his request out of the same pragmatic considerations that had motivated his father to wean the Patriarch away from his ancient seat. Like his father, al-Af4al, too, intervened in ecclesiastical affairs where Fatimid foreign policy was at stake. In 1101, when the King of Abyssinia dispatched an emissary to al-Af4al requesting that a new Metropolitan over the Ethiopian church be designated, the viceroy summoned Patriarch Michael IV and directed him to comply at once. When, shortly thereafter, the newly installed prelate fell into disgrace over some indiscretion and was sent back to Egypt by the Ethiopian King, al-Af4al summarily threw the man into prison.37 We may imagine that al-Af4al took this action in order to cool the anger of the Abyssinian ruler and prevent the kind of anti- Egyptian outbursts which had plagued the reign of Badr al-Jamali and which certainly hovered before the eyes of the latter's son. To judge from the History of the Patriarchs, the heads of the Coptic church offered little resistance to the radical alteration in their lives and to 36. Ibid., 3': 4-6. 37.

The Nestorian Catholicos and the Jewish Exilarch had unquestion- ably moved their respective seats of government from the Sassanian capital of Ctesiphon to the new Abbasid capital of Baghdad with these very consi- derations in mind.38 Similar strategy probably induced the head of the yeshiva of Pumbedita to imitate their example at the end of the ninth cen- tury when the Abbasid Caliphs returned to Baghdad after their half-century long sojourn in Samarra.39 So, too, with the Coptic Patriarchs. At a time when Fatimid central government was being restored to vigor following years of impotence, the heads of the Coptic church could hardly resist the invitation to become associated with the architects of Cairo's resurgence. As the relationship between the Patriarch and the Fatimid viziers grew closer, a significant restructuring of political power within the See of Cairo unfolded. Because the Patriarch had always resided in Alexandria, the task of representing Coptic ecclesiastical interests before the Muslim authorities had traditionally been shared by the bishop of Cairo and the Coptic Kitibs (civil servants). As a result, the bishop of Cairo boasted an exalted position within the episcopal ranks. In a letter to the Patriarch defending their special status among ecclesiastical districts, the Copts of Cairo protested: "this See does not follow the same course as the other southern and northern Sees, because in it are the archons of Cairo and its leaders and the Coptic notables and chiefs [ru'asd;] who are the scribes of the state [kuttdb al-dawla] and the servants of the kingdom. In addition, their bishop must at all times be pre- sent in attendance on the reigning king."'40 Once the Patriarch became ensconced in the capital, however, and as- sumed his new role as guarantor of Christian loyalty to the Fatimid state at home and abroad, it was inevitable that the bishop of Cairo should lose his former prestige. Indeed, John Ibn Sa'id al-Qulzumi describes from first- 38. Baron, Social and Religious History of the Jews, 2d ed., 5: 7. 39. This suggestion about the return from Samarra is made by Heribert Busse, Chalifund Grossk6nig: Die Buyiden in Iraq (945-1055) (Beirut, 1969), p. 485, in his chapter on the Jews, noting that the head of the Nestorian church moved to Baghdad at that time (cf. also p. 455). As his source for the relocation of Pumbedita, Busse cites Jacob Mann, "The Last Geonim of Sura," Jewish Quarterly Review, n.s. 11 (1920-21): 420 and idem, "Addenda to 'The Responsa of the Babylonian Geonim as a Source of Jewish History,' " ibid., p. 435, wherein Mann com- ments only that "the reason for this change of residence is not known." Busse's plausible pro- posal demonstrates the usefulness of the comparative approach to non-Muslim communal history. 40.

During his reign, Patriarch Michael IV (1092-1102) forced the bishop of Cairo into political exile at least twice and even attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, to subvert the bishop's time-honored prerogative to be the patron of the venerable Church of St. Sergius in Fustat.4' Upon the death of the incumbent bishop of Cairo in May, 1117, Patriarch Macarius actually delayed designating a successor for a year, rightly generating suspicions that he intended to abolish the bishop- ric altogether.42 Though he was finally pressured into consecrating John son of Sanhuit as Cairene bishop in 1118, the appointment had little practical significance. By the time of the reign of Macarius, the bishop of Cairo had forfeited to the Patriarch all the trappings of office which had once ren- dered his position special. Symbolically, it was the Patriarch and not the bishop who joined the Coptic katibs in paying homage to al-Aft1al's succes- sor as vizier in 1122.43 If, as appears to be the case, no voices of opposition were heard in 1134 when Patriarch Gabriel Ibn Turaik failed to install a new bishop for Cairo upon the death of John son of Sanhit in that year,44 it was undoubtedly because by then the Patriarch had thoroughly supplanted him. IV The history of the establishment of the Coptic Patriarchate in the Fati- mid capital during the latter third of the eleventh century presents a remark- able parallel to the contemporaneous shift of Jewish self-government from Jerusalem to Cairo. It is difficult to imagine that these two events are not related in some manner. To be sure, the initial stimulus for the transference of central Jewish administration from Palestine to Egypt came from within. With the decline 41. Ibid., 23: 385-88, 395-97.

The correspondence between the Patriarch and the Cairenes concerning this matter, from which the passage quoted above was taken, has been preserved in the History of the Patriarchs of the Egyptian Church (3': 11-32). This is thanks to the happy coincidence that the compiler of Macarius's vita, John Ibn Sa'id al-Qulzumi, was also the scribe who wrote the epistles on behalf of the Cairenes and received (and preserved) the Patriarch's replies. Together, these letters provide a fascinating glimpse of inner church politics, one which is thoroughly reminiscent of the quarrels depicted in so many Geniza letters. Their data further attest to the possibilities inherent in the comparative approach to non-Muslim communal history. 43. Ibn Muyassar, p. 62 (top). 44.

COHEN of the Jerusalem academy in the 1060s, its exile to Tyre in the wake of the Seljuk invasion of 1071, and the immigration of large numbers of Palestinian Jews to Egypt during and after the Seljuk onslaught, Egyptian Jewry natu- rally began to assert its independence. When Badr al-Jamili took power in Cairo in 1074, Egypt already had its first Nagid in the person of the court physician Judah b. Saadya. Neverthe- less, it is not at all certain that Judah b. Saadya held the Fatimid title Ra'is al-Yahfid.45 This claim can, however, be made with confidence for Judah's brother, Mevorakh b. Saadya, who succeeded him around 1078.46 In fact, it is unlikely that an officially recognized new office, replacing the Palestinian 45. The earliest dated reference in an Islamic source to the title rats al-yahad known to me is the above-mentioned (n. 43) passage in Ibn Muyassar's chronicle depicting the inaugural reception for al-AftIal's successor as vizier in 1122. The ra'Ts al-yahad and the Jewish kitibs followed immediately behind their Coptic counterparts in the procession of well-wishers. The only extant formulary for the appointment of a ra'Fs al-yahtid bearing an indication of date is from the Ayyubid period (cf. C. E. Bosworth, "Christian and Jewish Religious Dignitaries in Mamluk Egypt and Syria: Qalqa'shandi's Information on their Hierarchy, Titulature, and Appointment," International Journal of Middle East Studies 3 [1972]: 211-14). In the Geniza documents, the holders of many offices and leadership positions are designated ra'ts, reflecting the extreme flexibility of the term in Islamic society. Problematically, the Heads of the Jews in Egypt are almost always called in the Geniza by the nebulous shorthand, ra'Ts (or, as it is usually spelled, rayyis), which could allude to their official Fatimid title, to their leadership status in general, or to any one of a number of titles or categories with which ra'Ts was associ- ated. In all the Geniza documents known to me to bear a reference to Judah b. Saadya, the title rats (rayyis) occurs only twice. The first instance dates from the period prior to his receiving the Hebrew title of Nagid and evidently alludes either to his Babylonian honorific, Rosh Kallah ("Head of the Kallah"), or to his status as a court physician; TS (Taylor Schechter Collection, University Library, Cambridge, England) 13 J 9, fol. 3r. The second occurrence is a docket on the back of an undated letter recording its receipt at the majlis (audience hall) of "our lord [Arabic: sayyidnd] the illustrious Rayyis Abfi Zikri [Judah's honorific byname, or kunya] son of lord Saadya . . . may God perpetuate his strength and increase the splendor of his power"; TS Box K 6, fol. 36v. Here Judah is obviously in a position of high authority, though we still can- not say for certain that the "Rayyis" in his name represents the Fatimid investiture as ra'is al-yahad. 46. In a Geniza letter alluding to Mevorakh's return to power in 1094, after some twelve years of political exile, the writer speaks of "the restoration of the riydsa (Headship) to him"; MS Bodl. Heb. d 66, fol. 79v, line 3 (no. 31 in Murad A. Michael, "The Archive of Nahrai ben Nissim: Businessman and Public Figure in Egypt in the I Ith Century" [Hebrew] (Ph.D. diss., Hebrew University, 1963). Furthermore, another Geniza document mentions a governmental decree interdicting prayers in the name of the deposed Rayyis, which was promulgated during the reign of Mevorakh's rival, the Nasi David b. Daniel (r. ca. 1082-94); TS 12.657, trans. S. D. Goitein, Letters of Medieval Jewish Traders (Princeton, 1973), pp. 173-74. Since it is difficult to imagine that the Fatimid authorities would have appointed Mevorakh raTs al-yahad during his political exile, he must have achieved this dignity during his first (albeit short) term, following his brother Judah's death in ca. 1078.</page><page sequence="15">HEAD OF THE JEWS IN FATIMID EMPIRE 41 Gaonate, could have taken root in the Fatimid bureaucracy prior to the restoration of political stability under Badr al-Jamili. Possibly the defection of the Gaon to Tyre in 1071 put Badr al-Jamali into a mood receptive to a transformation in the Jewish community which happened to fit neatly into his scheme for centralizing minority leadership in the Fatimid capital. For their part, the Egyptian Jews would have needed some precedent to which they could defer when requesting such an innovation from the government. Very likely, it was the centralization of Coptic leadership in Cairo in the 1070s which provided the necessary pretext. Jews in government had daily contact with their Coptic colleagues and certainly heard of the momentous innovation in the Coptic community. Quite conceivably, the Jewish katibs, along with Jews outside the halls of government, concluded that it was essential to have their own titular and administrative chief located in the Fatimid court, next to his Christian counterpart. A fascinating Geniza letter from the beginning of the twelfth century proves the Jews kept abreast of privileges accorded the Christians of Egypt and made every effort through Jewish government functionaries to duplicate Coptic successes.47 At the very minimum, it seems reasonable to assume that at a time when the ruler of Egypt was pressing the head of the Egyptian-Christian minority to present himself regularly at court, his Jewish counterpart would have been subject to the same demand and for similar reasons. V This venture into the field of comparative history of non-Muslim minor- ities would appear, therefore, to have borne fruit. Through the close study of the chronicle of the lives of the Coptic Patriarchs we have been able to arrive at an awareness of Fatimid policy toward the chiefs of the non-Muslim communities during a crucial transitional period in the structure of Jewish self-government in the Fatimid state. Quite likely, Badr al-Jamali and al- Afdal, whose patronage of the Coptic Patriarchate emerges so plainly from our Christian-Arabic source, helped accelerate the evolution of the office of Head of the Jews as well. If upheld, our finding would appear to provide an additional explanation for why the office of Head of the Jews emerged in 47.
