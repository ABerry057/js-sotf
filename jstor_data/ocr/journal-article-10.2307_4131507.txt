<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review 28:1 (2004), 3-10 INTRODUCTION: RECREATING THE CANON by Nehama Aschkenasy In the articles gathered here, scholars of Hebrew revisit modem literary works and cultural documents through the prism of their continuing discourse with the Hebraic master narrative, the Bible. These scholars identify twin patterns in modem Hebrew texts: one is of embedding biblical prototypes, dramatic or se- mantic, in modern writings, while often questioning, challenging, and reversing the ancient models; the other is recreating and foregrounding specific biblical characters, scenes, or images, yet endowing them with a contemporary con- sciousness or placing them within the current cultural attitudes or mindset. Sever- al contemporary scholars understand this two-pronged pattern, revolutionary and deconstructive as it might seem, within the time-hallowed tradition of midrash. Some find the midrashic mode helpful in interpreting such texts as well as in pro- viding a methodological framework to the critical discourse. Thus, Gershon Shaked suggests in his article that all modern texts displaying this pattern may be viewed as modem midrashim.' The ancient Judaic midrash paved the way for a certain type of biblical hermeneutics while also using the master pre-Text as a pretext for creating a new tale. The midrash is the prototype of creative exegesis, exhibiting a singular com- bination of literary criticism and literary creativity. The creators of midrash re- leased the dramatic and epic potential of the sparse and elliptical biblical tale in their own retelling of it. To them, the canonical script was the primary text from which all written words flowed, the major document one should read and reread, interpret and reinterpret, tell and retell. But the Scriptural story seemed to bring out in the ancient interpreters their own artistic powers, thus they often used the ancient story as a launching pad for a new story.2 The midrashic hermeneutic elasticity illuminated for future generations pos- 1.

We might say that it is midrashic exegesis that opened up the long tradition of a dia- logic encounter with the biblical text and defined some of the modes by which this dialogue may be carried out. Moving away from the pedagogic task of sheer illu- mination of the Holy Writ, the ancient rabbis told new stories with contemporary or universal applications. Imaginative retelling of biblical stories or implanting biblical paradigms in modern stories has not been a practice exclusive to Hebraic writers. The powerful presence of the Bible in the history of European, English, and American writings is undeniable. Milton's "Paradise Lost" and Thomas Mann's solemn recreation of the saga of Joseph and his brothers may be seen as midrashim, as well as those works of the Western world and Judaic tradition where the biblical material is not in the foreground but, rather, is detected as a support- ing structure or as echoes producing an underlying discursive energy between the modern and the ancient.3 Thus Northrop Frye has defined Kafka's writings as "a series of commentaries on the Book of Job."4 Another path into the discourse between the biblical text and the modem sto- ry may be carved by extending Mikhail Bakhtin's theory of the "polyphonic text," which manifests a dialogic interchange between different styles, "the internal dif- ferentiation, the stratification characteristic of any language," that is at the heart of prose fiction." Bakhtin saw the role of the "sacred word" in medieval and early Renaissance works mainly as enhancing the spirit of parody and carnival, when the high style is brought down to the mundane and vulgar, as is often the case in the works of Rabelais.6 As to the presence of the Bible in later European works, such as in Tolstoy's novels, Bakhtin argued that the iconic stature of the biblical word did not serve to animate the modern but, rather, maintained an inert stature within the modern text.' Generally, he found the "authoritative discourse," which, we might say, describes biblical language, as dead, stilted, and calcified.8 Never- theless, Bakhtin's concept of "inter-animation," produced by multiple discourses, which he sees at the very core of the novel,9 can be amply illustrated precisely in the presence of the biblical voice or paradigms in a later work, creating a multivo- cal text in which the modem is measured against the sacred (not only for parody- ing or vulgarizing purposes), and at the same time it comments on the ancient script. Thus the stature of Yolek, Amos Oz's protagonist in A Perfect Peace, as a reincarnation of King Saul, and that of the cowardly, lying Azaria as that of David serve a parodic purpose, yet at the same time they animate Oz's novel by the sheer 3.

The same is true of the Abraham-like stature of Shimshon Sheinbaum in Oz's "The Way of the Wind"; while enhancing the grand standing of Oz's hypo- critical protagonist, it also gives a new shade to the author's condemning view of the biblical Abraham. And, while the biblical story of the Akedah is degraded in this modern tale, the biblical title of the story (removed from its syntactic context in the Bible and therefore provocative by itself) pays homage to the very language and spirit of Ecclesiastes and directs us to the multiplicity of meanings in which the word "ruach," or wind, is employed in the original text, in effect encapsualting the central images of the modern story: the actual wind that thrusts the young pro- tagonist to his tragic end,, spirit, vanity, pride, mystery, emptiness, and death. In fact, the energy and complexity, the interanimation, and the "polyglossia" that Bakhtin claimed gave rise to "novelistic discourse" in Europe'0 are richly exhib- ited in the variety of discourses with the Bible explored in the present volume, tes- tifying, perhaps, that the ultimate dialogic encounter in the Bakhtinian sense is between the Hebrew Bible and its later recreators. The status of the Bible as a reservoir of basic human prototypes and cosmic myths opens another methodological window into the modem discourse with the sacred text. The search for myth as an organizing structure is part of the modem scholarly and critical impetus to look for unity, integrity, and "the key design" of literary works and to evoke the Jungian collective unconscious and archetypes. I Northrop Frye has defined the Bible as "the myth of concern," an "imperialistic," all-enveloping "world construct,"12 and contrasted it with the ancient Greek liter- ary forms, which celebrated the cyclical life of nature, tragedy being "the myth of winter" and comedy "the myth of spring." In this respect, the Bible is seen as the primary monomyth offering the modern writer a repository of prototypical human situations and archetypal configurations, deep-seated in the collective Western mind. Harold Fisch has pointed out the limitation of Frye's theory by citing the Bible's multifunctional discourses, yet in his own studies Fisch has seen the bibli- cal text as encasing a mono-story of "salvation history."'3 The major biblical myth that has driven and inspired modern Hebrew writ- ers and Zionist thinkers, however, is undoubtedly the myth of the return of the ex- iles, coupled with the redemption of the land. Wresting the myth of return and redemption from its religious connotations, these writers focused on the stirrings of nationalist sentiments and hopes and the actual geopolitical return of the nation to its land, rather than on the age-old spiritual or metaphoric meanings of"return." 10.

To accomplish this, the early Zionist writers needed to acquire a new sys- tem of collective signs and symbols, radically different from the rabbinic tradition of Ghetto Judaism. This new system needed to foreground the revolutionary idea of Jewish nationality, but at the same time it had to draw on the cultural resources of Judaism. Thus, it converted the Bible into the Hebrew national epic, akin to other European national epics that inspired the people to fight for their political inde- pendence. The Bible provided Hebrew writers with larger-than-life, mythic mod- els of glory and might, which they juxtaposed with the image of victim associated with the Diaspora Jew. Further, the biblical moorings of modern Hebrew literature and culture-se- mantically, ideologically, and geopolitically-postulate a special relationship with the master text, surpassing in its intensity and intimacy any other culture's dis- course with it. Michael Walzer has seen in the story of Exodus the archetype of political-secular liberation that has underscored the major liberation movements in Western history.14 By virtue of the revived ancient language and the return of the same people to the biblical land itself, however, the biblical myth of national liberation is more closely bound with the Zionist idea than it had been with any other Western rhetoric of political freedom. The search for explanatory myths and archetypes is only one aspect of the modernist temper. The response to authority or to a prime textual master or mas- terwork has been seen as part of the cluster of cultural trends that we identify as modernism.'5 Freud's Oedipal model and Harold Bloom's "anxiety of influence," which posit a struggle with a dominant, overshadowing precursor, are examples. The poet, says Bloom, must always "misinterpret the father by the crucial act of misprision, which is the rewriting of the father."16 In this context, the modern writ- ers' dialogue with the Bible can be viewed as grounded in response to, and rebel- lion against, the authoritative text, the "Father" of all texts. The struggle with the Father is part of the rebellion of modernist aesthetics against the cohesive worldview of the past, resulting as well in the fragmentation of the self, the shift from the realistic representation of the world to the logic of subjectivity, the primacy of the inward voice, and the existential loneliness and alienation of the self. These features characterize much of the works of the Hebrew practitioners of modernism (such as Amos Oz, A. B. Yehoshua, and David Gross- man in fiction and Nissim Aloni and Hanokh Levin in drama, to name a few). Fol- lowing Strindberg, Kafka, Joyce, Beckett, and Faulkner, among others, they reversed traditional forms by introducing the "anti-hero," the dehumanization of the protagonist, the parodic reduction of authority, the "theatre of the absurd," and the fractured narrative that simulates the stream of consciousness. In their secu- 14. Exodus and Revolution (New York: Basic Books, 1985). 15.

But in the particular case of Israeli writers and poets of the past three or four decades, one form of reversing traditional modes has taken the shape of an angry, combative dialogue with the Bible. Biblical au- thority is battled with, negated, and reversed by these writers, especially after the 1967 war, when the Bible became increasingly more politicized in Israel, identi- fied with the drive to reclaim the glory of the ancient past and with the sense of exclusive entitlement to the land. In addition to the midrashic, Bakhtinian, mythic, and modernist theories, the nexus of premises associated with postmodernism also provides a framework for understanding some of the current Hebrew writers' encounter with the Bible and their deliberate practices of emptying the language from its biblical echoes. The postmodern disposition is antagonistic towards "totality" and its manifestation, termed "metanarratives" by Jean-Francois Lyotard.'7 Metanarratives purport to explain all manner of phenomena in terms of basic laws, such as Marxism, which views history in terms of the class struggle. For Lyotard, the Western canon is mod- eled on the Judeo-Christian theologies of history, refashioned into a secular grand narrative by the Enlightenment and nineteenth-century theories of evolution and progress. The postmodern, on the other hand, possesses a counter-Enlightenment drift and proposes to replace the grand myth of "universal history" with "local nar- ratives" of the hitherto repressed and silenced."8 In this context, the biblical mon- omyth, as well as the Zionist metanarrative which assimilated the biblical grand tale and combined it with other modern myths, such as nationalism and socialism, must now be cut down to size and viewed as one story among many, neither priv- ileged in any way nor bestowing any special privileges on a particular group. Fur- ther, the postmodern tendency to flatten character and experience and to deflate language stands in contradiction to previous practices, which sought to use the bib- lical undergirding of the modern narratives to create multivocal discourses. Yet, given the very nature of the Hebrew language and its long roots reaching to bibli- cal language, Hebrew writers of the postmodern temper are faced with the dilem- ma of using a language saturated with biblical echoes and at the same time producing emaciated, thin semantic signifiers to reflect their protagonists' shrunk- en universe. The articles included in this volume cover only a few examples of the whole spectrum of imaginative recreations of biblical models and of the intertextual ac- tivity in modern Hebrew works. For example, A. B. Yehoshua's Mr. Mani, un- doubtedly one of the most intricate revisitings of several paradigmatic Genesis stories (the akedah, the Hagar tale, Judah and Tamar, the Joseph story) is discussed 17.

It is, therefore appropriate that the author of this major contem- porary novel share with us his reflections of the biblical tale of the akedah, which he finds the most disturbing paradigm in Judaic lore and thought. Several of the articles offer a wide scope, tracing the evolvement of Hebrew writers' discourse with the Bible from Haskalah and early Zionism to contempo- rary Israel. Anita Shapira's historical overview, which opens the volume, careful- ly excavates cultural documents, articles, and public speeches to map out the dramatic permutations in the status of the Bible in Zionist and Israeli culture. The most telling confirmation of the Bible's "rise and fall as the hallmark of Israel's canonical identity" are the school trips that have shifted their destination from pop- ular Israeli archaeological digs, which verified and concretized the biblical stories for the school-age students, to the European sites of concentration camps and oth- er testimonies to the holocaust. Gershon Shaked also offers a broad canvass, surveying writings from Haskalah to modern Israel, which often give a secular, even subversive, interpre- tation of the Bible, naming them "modern midrash." He contends that the new cul- ture attempts to give legitimacy to the revolutionary present by grounding itself in the myths of the ancient canonical literature while at the same time interpreting and adapting the ancient models to the ideo-mythologic needs of the present. Shaked displays this trend in numerous ways, most strikingly in representations of King Saul by three modern poets: In Tchernichovsky's poems, Saul is noble and tragic, representing the Zionist generation of heroic warriors; in Alterman's poet- ic rendering, Saul's death is removed from the canvass, which in turn is dominat- ed by his strong mother who stands for the invincible motherland; and in Amichai's "subversive and revolutionary" midrash, Saul's heroism only accentuates the fa- tigue and diminished stature of the non-heroic, war-weary present generation. Glenda Abramson charts the evolving uses of biblical material in Israeli dra- ma through the journey the latter has taken from idealism to political protest. In modern Israeli drama, the biblical tales filled the role of classical myth in Euro- pean drama, thus allying Jewish culture with a new artistic form, aiming to boost the morale of the new society. Later, biblical drama became political allegories in which the dramatists discussed current social and political issues of corruption in government and leadership and warned Israelis about the moral and ethical ero- sion resulting from materialism and ultra-nationalism. Other articles apply the critic's magnifying glasses to a narrower canvass. Yael Feldman examines the works of three women fiction writers and their wrestling with the male-gendered Judaic linguistic and mythic tradition, charting these writers' evolving treatment of biblical paradigms from mere appropriation to subversion of the original male-intoned models. In her reading of Agnon's com- plex master novel, Temol Shilshom, Sidra DeKoven Ezrahi shifts her insightful crit- ical eye from the biblical tale of the akedah, which clearly undergirds the adventures of the novel's hapless protagonist, Isaac, to another biblical paradigm, the talking ass in parashat Balak, which here finds its counterpart in the thinking dog Balak. My own article focuses on short stories by writers representing three distinctly different trends in modern Hebrew literature: Agnon, who bridged the gap between the traditionalism of the East European Jewish experience and the 8</page><page sequence="7">Introduction: Recreating the Canon secularism of modern Jewish and Israeli life; Amos Oz, the Israeli writer of the "new wave" (the designation offered by Gershon Shaked); and Aharon Appelfeld, of Oz's generation chronologically, yet a writer whose imaginative landscape is that of the holocaust, not of the Israeli reality. Malka Shaked follows the peregrinations of the figure of Moses in Hebrew poetry, while Chaya Shacham looks at the transformations of the biblical figure of Jacob in the works of Benjamin Tammuz and Meir Shalev, which signal the shift- ing identities and self-definitions of the modern Israeli. Leading us to the au courant postmodern trend, Avraham Balaban points out the various methods of confronting the biblical material exhibited by contemporary writers who are com- mitted to the flattening of the self and of language. This volume takes us through the turbulent, fascinating journey of ideas and cultural currents from pre-statehood to the contemporary post-Zionist phase in Is- raeli history by following the shifting trail of the biblical paradigms embedded in literature and other written documents. Anita Shapira has clearly demonstrated that the national sentiments and psychological identification have shifted from an ex- clusive focus on the ancient epic, tied to the land of Israel, to the Jewish historical odyssey on the European terrain which culminated in the tragedy of the holocaust. Nevertheless, the modern language is still inseparable from its biblical roots, and the tenacious, complex claim to this particular land, under assault politically and ethically, perceives the biblical narrative as indispensable. The deliberate empty- ing of the Hebrew vocabulary from its biblical echoes, practiced by some of the postmodern writers, often serves, paradoxically, as a reminder of the biblical foun- dation of the language and the culture. The non-presence thus becomes a gaping hole, a telling lacuna. And given that the writers of the postmodern temper still find it impossible to vacate totally the language of their represented and imagina- tive universe from its biblical shadings, we may conclude that even in the current post-Zionist and postmodern climate, the Bible, removed from the precinct of the sacred, argued with and challenged, has not lost its power as the primary canoni- cal document in much of contemporary Hebrew literature and culture.
