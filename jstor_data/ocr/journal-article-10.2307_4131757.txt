Leiden: Brill, 2001. xvi, 306 pp. Alfonso de la Torre (ca.1417-60), a person of somewhat obscure back- ground, wrote Visi6n delectable de lafilosofla artes liberales, metafisica yfilosofia 397</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews moral (or Visi6n deleytable as Gir6n-Negr6n insists) ca. 1440 at the urging of the prior of Navarre, who was close to the crown prince Carlos de Viana. An unusual philosophical work for a Christian author, it does not conform to standard Scholas- tic doctrine, but is clearly dependent to a very great extent on the Guide for the Perplexed (Moreh nevukhim) of Maimonides. As such, the work, and this detailed analysis of it, is of particular interest to students of Jewish philosophy. At the out- set, let it be said that Gir6n-Negr6n has done a thorough and brilliant job in this book, a revision of his doctoral dissertation. He was aided by Jewish advisors in understanding and translating Hebrew texts, but one assumes that, as is the case with many Spanish scholars, his knowledge of Arabic is his own. He also has done an extensive amount of reading in secondary Jewish literature. (There are some er- rors, nevertheless; e.g., the philosopher Abraham Bivagch, not "Bibago," did not engage in a "philosophical discussion" with Juan II of Arag6n; rather, it was with an unnamed Christian "sage," and it was a polemical debate, not a philosophical discussion.) Gir6n-Negr6n devotes the first chapter to background and possible sources, including a discussion of Scholasticism in fifteenth-century Spain. He discusses briefly (17-18) the scholarly consensus that the author is identical with a student from Burgos who had earned his degree in theology at the University of Salaman- ca, and presumably moved to Navarre where he wrote his work, probably in 1440. Of particular interest is the question of his possible converso background (19 ff.). For some inexplicable reason, however, the author sides with the view of Marcel Bataillon that Alfonso was not the same as the "Bachiller de la Torre" of Burgos, as a result of alleged "aragonisms" (use of some Aragonese terms) in his work, ar- guing that the fact that he knew little Hebrew, if at all, suggests a second-genera- tion converso background (21). Yet he himself admits that the "aragonisms" can easily be explained on other grounds. It is a great leap of logic to assume, also, that merely because he seems not to have known Hebrew he had to be a "second-gen- eration" converso, for in the fifteenth century a great many Spanish Jews, much less conversos, did not know Hebrew or knew it very poorly. The issue of whether a converso could have studied at the particular college of Salamanca that the "bachiller" attended, because of a supposed prohibition on persons of "Jewish blood" studying there (the limpieza de sangre statutes), is dismissed (22) by sid- ing with Sicroff and attacking the contrary views of Asensio; however, it is by no means so simple. Nor is it correct (n.75) that the distinguished scholar Dominguez Ortiz "also sides with Sicroff"; he did not (see on this my Conversos, Inquisition, and the Expulsion of the Jews from Spain [University of Wisconsin Press, 1995; revised paper ed., 2002], p. 230 and n. 72, and also elsewhere there for informa- tion about Alfonso de la Torre; it is unfortunate that the author did not use this book). Nor, contra Salinas Espinosa, cited in the same note, do we have any evi- dence of Jews or conversos who studied at Salamanca at this time. Gir6n-Negr6n makes an interesting suggestion that, in addition to Mai- monides, the polemical treatise of Hasdai Crescas, Bitul cikarei ha-nozrim, which was originally written in Catalan, was known to Alfonso (27). In addition to the possibility of the influence of the Spanish Muslim philosopher Ibn Tufayl (that Carreras y Artau referred to him as "Jewish" was no doubt a slip of the pen, or 398</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews editorial error), and the possibility of a Spanish version of his work should not be overlooked-a work by Bartolomeo Fazzio (d. 1457), "Dialogues defelicitate vi- tae" (unpublished, manuscript at Madrid B.N.) ought to be considered (he is not mentioned by Gir6n-Negr6n). The lengthy second chapter details the author's religious philosophy, also in connection with possible Jewish influences, including speculation on Kabbalah. This is also not without some errors. Enrique de Villena said nothing about "kab- balistic" amulets attributed to various Jewish scholars (153; he misread his source), Ibn Adret most definitely did not "espouse talismanic magic ... as an efficacious means of astral manipulation" (155; cf. Responsa of Ibn Adret II, No. 281). Yet these are minor faults in what otherwise is an exceptional tour deforce in correct- ly demonstrating for the first time the extent of Alfonso's dependence on Mai- monides, a dependence, which was almost total. Alfonso, of course, used the Spanish translation by the converso Pedro (Diaz) de Toledo (available now in a crit- ical edition by Moshe Lazar, 1989; see also I. Bar-Lewaw, "Pedro de Toledo," in Homenaje a Antonio Rodriguez Moniino [Madrid, 1966] 1:57-64; an important ar- ticle not cited by Gir6n-Negr6n; nor was Pedro's other translation, Plato's Phaedo [Libro llamdo "Fedr6n," ed. Nicholas G. Round, 1993], consulted; could it be demonstrated that Alfonso knew this work?). There are some minor editorial problems, such as the failure to correct some understandable (for one whose first language is not English) grammatical errors, and the misprint of the letter nun for gimmel throughout in the quotation from Shevet Yehudah (219). This book should be of great interest to those who wish to see the influence of medieval Jewish philosophy on Christian thought, and its apparent continued influence on at least some converso circles. In that respect, it should be noted (as the author does not) that Carlos de Viana, the prince for whom Alfonso wrote the work, was himself of Jewish descent.
