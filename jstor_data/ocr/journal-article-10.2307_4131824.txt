Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 2003. viii, 331 pp. This book searchingly reexamines and sheds much new light on subjects that might already seem to have received more than enough scholarly attention. Ronald Schechter succeeds in offering an intriguing new account of the attitude of the thinkers of the French Enlightenment, some of their heirs, and some of their ene- mies toward the Jews. He also presents a challenging, if less than fully convinc- 1. In Moshe Z. Sokol, ed., Engaging Modernity: Rabbinic Leaders and the Challenge of the Twentieth Century (Northvale, NJ: J.

Unlike Arthur Hertzberg, with whom he almost never bothers to take issue, Schechter draws no sharp line of demarcation between friendly thinkers like Mon- tesquieu and enemies of the Jews like Voltaire. Instead, he highlights the similari- ties between these two men and others who condemned past mistreatment of the Jews and deplored various aspects of their tradition and current condition but still believed in the possibility of their successful rehabilitation in the future. If many of these men's narratives and hopes "resemble one another, it is because they all took as their model (no doubt unconsciously) the three-act biblical drama of Par- adise, Paradise Lost, and Paradise Regained" (p. 107). Not the heritage of classi- cal antiquity but notions unwittingly derived from Christianity constitute the pri- mary roots of many early modern thinkers' aspirations to bring about "what they revealingly called the regeneration of the Jews" (p. 108). This does not mean that they continued to ascribe any special theological or metaphysical significance to the Jewish people. But they did come to think of it as a sort of test case for mea- suring the limits of human perfectibility. If the Jews, "the most recalcitrant, obsti- nate people could improve, then all peoples could improve" (p. 105). Those who denied that the Jews were corrigible were in Schechter's opinion by no means heirs of the Enlightenment. In his sole explicit disagreement with Arthur Hertzberg, he flatly rejects his characterization of Francois Hell, the insti- gator of the "false receipts" affair in Alsace, as a pupil of Voltaire. "Even the most cursory reading" of his anti-Semitic writings, he observes, "reveals a set of con- victions and a narrative style that are entirely at odds with those of the philosophe" (p. 68). Following his own careful and insightful analysis of Hell's essentially un- enlightened outlook, Schechter similarly shows how incorrect it is to regard a harsh critic of the Jews named Latour-Foissac, another key figure in Hertzberg's famous genealogy of modem anti-Semitism, as an heir of Voltaire. In the part of his book devoted to the Jews' post-revolutionary response to the new estimations of their history and their potential for improvement, Schechter seeks to demonstrate that they were anything but putty in the hands of those who wished to refashion them. On the basis of extensive analysis of apologetic writ- ings, patriotic prayers, poems, early Jewish journalism, the record of the Paris San- hedrin, and other sources, he concludes that the "Jews were not assimilated by the dominant culture, despite the proclaimed intentions of most Gentile regenera- tionists. They assimilated that culture into their own. That is to say, they recognized its values as their own without undergoing a fundamental transformation of iden- tity" (p. 179). Unfortunately, Schechter arrives at this broad conclusion without giving due consideration to the worldviews of men like the Jewish leader of the revolutionary era, Berr Isaac Berr, whose eagerness to see the Jews immerse themselves in Gen- tile culture seems to have greatly exceeded their attachment to their own heritage. Nor does he weigh the full implications of something that he himself notes: many Jews seem to have recognized as their own whatever happened to be the dominant culture's values at any given moment. In the early 1790s, for instance, M6ise En- sheim, a Hebrew poet living in Metz, affirmed that "the revolutionary values of 178</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews equality and justice were Jewish values revealed by God and enshrined in the high- est of all laws: the Torah" (p. 188). A mere decade later, other French Jewish po- ets celebrated Napoleon as their father, likening him to the messiah and even to God. Such a shift makes it difficult to affirm, along with Schechter, that the evi- dence "suggests that the Jews were assimilating la grande nation far more than they were being assimilated to it" (p. 233). But even if he is not entirely convinc- ing on this score, Schechter succeeds in elucidating self-affirming aspects of the French Jewish response to the Enlightenment and Emancipation that many previ- ous historians have tended to overlook. This is not the least of his book's very con- siderable merits. Allan Arkush Binghamton University Binghamton, New York</page></plain_text>
