<plain_text><page sequence="1">CORRIGENDA In AJS Review 25:1 the following dedication and acknowledgments were accidentally deleted from the article by Yosef Salmon. The dedication should have appeared in the upper left hand corner of the first page; the acknowledgments before the first numbered footnote. We regret these deletions. In addition, we regret the numerous instances in which the He- brew letters failed to materialize properly. The author is in no way re- sponsible for any of these errors, and we sincerely apologize to him for them.
