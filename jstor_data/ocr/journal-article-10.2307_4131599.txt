Jewish Identity in Modern Art History. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999. x, 239 pp. The study of art in Judaism now takes center stage, as works of considerable intellectual ambition appear from year to year. The ones before us, a topical an- thology and a coherent collection of essays, some of them groundbreaking, and all of them remarkably fresh and interesting, signal the advent of a new field within Jewish studies. The books complement one another, the one illuminating, the oth- er argumentative, and both of them exceedingly interesting. Jewish Texts on the Visual Arts assembles fifty items, divided among seven basic subjects, each given an introduction and set into context, then given in trans- lation, with notes, bibliography, and index. On the basis of a collection of prima- ry sources, ancient, medieval, and modern, a course on art in Judaism can be of- fered. Professor Vivian Mann, of The Jewish Museum and the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, has established herself as a principal voice in the study of Jewish art and the art of Judaism. Her most recent major article, "Art and material culture of Judaism: medieval through modem times," in the Encyclopedia of Ju- daism (Leiden, 1999: E. J. Brill), 1: 1-13, with sixteen figures, impressed many as a model of concision and mastery of the subject. Here she has collected a vari- ety of texts pertinent to the same matter and presented them in translation; the translations of Rabbinic texts by Dr. Eliezer Diamond, Professor of Talmud at the Jewish Theological Seminary, are clumsy and not very accurate, scarcely reaching the level of scholarly reliability set by Dr. Mann herself. The texts begin with passages of Scripture, proceed to the Mishnah and Tal- muds, medieval authorities, and on to modern times. Each unit of the book then takes up a topic that is presented in the same temporal order, ancient, medieval, and modern. Mann's collection deals with seven subjects: iconoclasm, the art of the oth- er (meaning, Jews' use of art produced by gentiles), the synagogue and its decora- tion, Jewish ceremonial arts, artists and their practices, and collecting Jewish art. Iconoclasm takes up a passage of Scripture, another of the Mishnah, an essay of 211</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review Maimonides ("which images are permitted?"), and statements of Don Guzman and Rabbi Moses Arragel, Joseph Caro, Moses Sofer, and Abraham Isaac Hakohen Kook. The art of the other starts with a passage of Tosefot to Bavli Abodah Zarah, a responsum of Ephraim of Regensburg, another of Meir of Rothenburg, Asher ben Jehiel, Judah ben Asher and David Amado, Joseph Karo, David ibn Abi Zimra, Samuel Aboab, Jair Hayyim Bacharach, Ezekiel Katzenellenbogen, and Joseph Saul Nathanson; and so throughout. The movement from ancient to modem times tracks the changes in the situa- tion of the Jews over time. For example, the ancient and medieval issue of using gen- tile art for Judaism raises the question of prayer rugs; for modem times, the issue is, "may a church building become a synagogue?" So too, Jewish ceremonial art begins with "lists of silver and precious textiles belonging to the synagogues of Old Cairo in the eleventh and twelfth centuries" and ends with Moshe Feinstein, "the star of David in the mid-twentieth century: is it a Zionist symbol?" When it comes to artists and their practices, the modem predominates: Buber, Roditi, Rosenberg, and Don- ald Kuspit "identity in modem art." Nearly all the chapters on collecting art deal with modem and contemporary figures. Apart from the wooden translations by Professor Diamond, the book is consistently engaging, start to finish. Jewish Identity in Modern Art History succeeds in proving what many doubt: that one can investigate Jewish-ethnic traits of mind and do so rigorously, not mere- ly subjectively. Such traits can be alleged to respond to a situation common to Jews and different from that experienced by others. That is the thesis argued in the es- says on how modem art critics, collectors, and artists worked out the experience of Jewishness through the media of art. Many assume what these essays rigorous- ly argue, and that makes this collection a huge step forward in Jewish studies, the mark of the coming age of a new venture in the field. Beginning at a session of the College Art Association in 1996, the book of essays edited by Professor Catherine M. Soussloff, University of California, San- ta Cruz, proposes to "introduce Jewish identity to art history": the meaning of anti- Semitism for art history, the significance of Jewish 6migr6 art historians to the dis- cipline, above all, the effects of Jewish ethnicity on the interpretation of art. Art historians have "wanted to avoid the notion that their religion or ethnicity had any- thing to do with their art criticism," let alone establish the possibility of "a histo- riography of Jewish identity in art history." But that is precisely Soussloff's intent, and the book accomplishes her goal. The essays divide into two parts. Some adopt a postmodemist language, e.g., requiring "that the multiple subjectives of the interpreter be considered in histori- cal critique." Others work within the familiar frame of art-historical study. Sous- sloff, in her Introduction, bridges the gap between the two distinct modes of dis- course; she makes the book work as a whole, not just as a collection of essays. She even makes postmodernist jargon plausible, intelligible, and necessary-a truly remarkable achievement of clarity and lapidary thinking. The descriptive-analytical essays of an essentially historical character prove uniformly compelling. In that category are Margaret Olin, "From Bezalel to Max Liebermann: Jewish art in nineteenth-century art-historical texts," Kalman P. 212</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Bland, "Anti-Semitism and aniconism: the Germanophone requiem for Jewish vi- sual art," a brilliant essay, one of unusual power of persuasion; Lisa Saltzman, "To figure or not to figure: the iconoclastic proscription and its theoretical legacy," de- voted to Theodor Adorno and others; Larry Silver, "Jewish identity in art and his- tory: Maurycy Gottlieb as early Jewish artist;" Robin Reisenfeld, "Collecting and collective memory: German Jewish identity, and the emigration of iconology;" Louis Kaplan, "Reframing the self-criticism: Clement Greenberg's 'Modernist painting' in light of Jewish identity;" and Charlotte Schoell-Glass, "Aby Warburg: forced identity and 'cultural science'." The post-modernist modes of discourse predominate in Lisa Bloom, "Ethnic motions and feminist strategies of the 1970s: some work by Judy Chicago and Eleanor Antin;" and Donald Kuspit, "Meyer Schapiro's Jewish unconscious." The latter works well with the more conventional papers; I cannot say I understand how the former fits into the book, except in a fairly general way. The two essays of a post- modernist character tend to a certain subjectivity, but both illuminate their subject. These essays do cohere, and reading them in sequence shows the unfolding of a continuous line of thought and argument through illustrative cases. Soussloff accomplished that in her editing and spells it out in her introduction. This brief ac- count conveys little of the intellectual vitality of the essays. It suffices to say I learned from all of them and can agree with the editor that she has pointed to a new field of learning, one which promises more than merely subjective results: how Jewish ethnicity enters into aesthetics. With these two books, a new standard is set, and the promise of their sub- jects begins to be kept. Jacob Neusner Bard College Annandale-on-Hudson, New York</page></plain_text>
