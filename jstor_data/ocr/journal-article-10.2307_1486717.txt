<plain_text><page sequence="1">Alan Silverstein, Alternatives to Assimilation: The Response of Reform Judaism to American culture 1840-1930. Hanover Brandeis University Press, 1994. 275 pp. How did Reform Judaism respond to the pressures emanating from the general American environment, to demographic and generational changes, and to the challenge of trying to instill religiosity in an increasingly secu- larized population? Alan Silverstein's social and institutional history offers an unambivalently positive assessment. By adopting to these pressures, Reform not only continued to meet the needs of its adherents, but set the organizational standard for Conservative and Orthodox Judaism as well. Emphatically a bottom-up approach, Silverstein balances the necessary discussions of flagship organizations and leaders with a bird's eye view of four important urban congregations (Philadelphia's Keneseth Israel, San Francisco's Emanu-El, New Orleans's Temple Sinai, Cincinnati's Kehillah K'doshah B'nai Yeshurun). The author's own rabbinic experience clearly enhances his discussions of the myriad of programs and initiatives attempted by these congregations. Silverstein's work reflects the growing consensus 1) that Judaism as a reli- gion must be described with the American and American religious landscape,' 1. See, for instance, Jack Wertheimer's A People Divided (1993).</page><page sequence="2">414 BOOK REVIEWS and 2) that local pressures differentiate religious practices and may cut across denominational issues. The author delivers on the introduction's promise to offer a more chronologically nuanced understanding of "Americanization," although for readers better versed in Judaica than in American history, terms such as "American Corporate culture" deserved more than a two-paragraph definition (pp. 147-148). The tripartite division of the work along chronological and cultural lines reflects the book's most obvious revision. Namely, silverstein finds a significant shift from the period of 1840-1880 to 1880-1900. In the earlier period, despite the demographic emergence of Central European, German-speaking Jews, an Anglo-American model prevailed. Citing the tutelage system of early calsses at Hebrew Union College, the democratic electoral system of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, and the growing sense of denominationalism at large, the aurthor contends that American Jews, like American Christians, looked to England for religious models. Church-based, all-day religious schools proliferated in this period; Jewish day schools existed in Cincinnati and elsewhere, only to disappear with rise of public schooling in the post-Civil War era. Silverstein's hyphenate Anglo-American needs scrutiny. The portrayal seems more "American" than "Anglo," especially when one consideres that voluntarism and plummeting church membership. an essential devolopment in America's postcolonial history, have no analogues in the Church of England system. According to Silverstein, German models profoundly influenced Jewish life only during the brief efflorescence of German influence on American cul- ture. This period followed Germany's unification and the apex of its prestige as a country of higher learning. In turn, the Germanic phase was superseded by an "American Corporate Culture." The latter began to predominate at the turn of the century, fueled by America's imperial and mercantile successes, and a renewed sense of America's unique qualities. Yet one may protest--using Silverstein's own data--that in 1900, the year that the German influence ostensibly gave way to the American Corporate, 19 of 25 serving Ph. D's serving the Central Constence of American Rabbis received their doctorates in Germany, and Kaufmann Kohler's patently Germanic curricular reforms only began to be implemented at Hebrew Union College. While his chronological revision may be questioned, Silverstein demon- strates that in every period American Jewish life took its cues from the American environment. Although he notes exclusively Jewish concerns (p. 205), the Jews' position as a "classic minority," to use Salo Baron's phrase,</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 415 suggests a more jaundiced consideration of specific ethnic analogies. To take one example: American Christians of German descent "intensified efforts to retain the loyalties of their young adults, by 'inventing' a German-American ethnic identity, including ethnic churches. German Jews in America of the 1880s emulated this innovation by forging ethnic German temples, the logical usccessors of national-origin synagogues" (pp. 74-75). While a greater degree of standardization was achieved in Reform in the 1880-1900 period, typeical of other ethnic churches, was this not as much a product of responding to the arrival of masses of Eastern European Jews as an attempt to rescue second-generation loyalties? The demographic features of immigration were different for Jews differed than German-Americans and Irish-Americans, who did not confort a second wave of immigrants that threatened to cast doubt on their own acculuration. The failure of David Einhorn's plea to retain the German-language is well known. Silverstein himself tells us in that 1890 (the mid-year of the "German Period") Joseph Krauskopf spoke eloquently on the need to eliminate German-language sermons (p. 150). Thus even in America, it seems, German Jews did not feel safe doing everything German Lutherans did. At this period in American Judaism, anxiety over integration, not survival, remains the more important factor. Finally, the title, which suggests that Reform Judaism presents a success story, deserves comment. Viewing it as an organization which innovated at the local and national levels, and which offered a battery of programs to meet changing needs, the author more than proves his point. But clearly the success of Reform Judaism must be partly measured by examining those who preferred assimilation to Reform's alternatives. By limiting his study to congregational material, with the exception of brief allusions to Felix Adler's Ethical Culture Society, Silverstein places anyone who considered assimilation as a serious alternative to Reform Judaism beyond the pale of his investigation. Without reference to how many American Jews excluded themselves from any denominational affiliation, how can we consider American Judaism successful exactly the point Mordeai Kaplan started making in the 1920s? The author lauds a religious movement that "redefined the nature of emple life" rather than "directly confront the lace of piety of each successive younger generation"(p. 207) One need not be a haredi to find something problematic in this formulation. These reservations notwithstanding, Silverstein has succeeded in inter- preting Reform in a broad social and cultural context, delivered on his promise to provide a more nuanced understanding of "Americanization," and</page><page sequence="4">416 BOOK REVIEWS offered us a model analysis of Jewish institutional life.
