His life and achievements are described in detail in the writings of Flavius Josephus and have been explored in numerous historical studies.1 In rabbinic literature, however, mention of Herod's image and achievements is scarce.2 The few sources that do exist are very brief, with the exception of one significant source in the Babylonian Talmud (henceforth: BT), which will be discussed in this article. The opening chapter of tractate Bava Batra in the BT contains a relatively lengthy Aggadah about Herod (3b- 4a; henceforth: the Aggadah). The direct and immediate context of this Aggadah is a halakhic discussion (3b, line 18 and onward) about the prohibition to destroy or take apart a synagogue, even if it is done with the intention of rebuilding it. On this background, the Talmud asks how the scholar Baba b. Buta advised Herod to destroy the Temple in Jerusalem and reconstruct it. After offering two possible answers to the questions, the text presents the Aggadah:3 This article is an adaptation of a chapter in my master's thesis: Yonatan Feintuch, "Tales of the Sages and the Surrounding Sugyot in Bavli Bava-Batra, Ch. 1-3" (Master's thesis, Bar-Ilan University, 2004). I would like thank the Kolatch Graduate Program in Talmudic Studies at Bar-Ilan University for its support of this research, and professors Leib Moscovitz and Jeffrey Rubenstein for their helpful comments. 1 . For historical sources and scholarship, especially in the context of the story that this article discusses, see below, note 16. 2. In rabbinic literature, Herod is mentioned almost invariably in the context of the rebuilding of the Second Temple (for rabbinical sources and additional ancient Jewish sources, see Daniel R. Schwartz, "Hordos ba-mekorot ha-Yehudiyim," in Ha-melekh Hordos utekufato , ed. Mordekhai Naor [Jerusalem: Yad Itzhak Ben-Zvi, 1985], 38-42). It should be noted that in tannaitic sources the construction of the Temple is said to have occurred in Herod's days, albeit without any mention of his involvement (see Sifra, Behukotai, par. 1:1, to Leviticus 26:4 [ed. Weiss, p. llOd] and parallels in Vayikra Rabba, Behu- kotai, par. 35, to Leviticus 26:3 [ed. Margaliyot, 4:828] and B. Ta'anit 23a). The identification of the Temple as "Herod's Building" is only in amoraic sources (see B. Sukkah 51b and a partial parallel in the Aggadah that will be discussed below, B. Bava Batra 4a). According to Schwartz (esp. 38, 42) Herod himself is hardly mentioned in rabbinic literature because as a "secular" king, who generally avoided contact with the "religious" world, his relevance to this literature is minimal. 3. The Aggadah is presented here and translated according to text of the Vilna printed edition. In the footnotes, I note textual variants significant to the literary analysis, according to the following 85</page><page sequence="2">Yonatan Feintuch Translation (including the sentences that precede the story, linking it to the preceding Halakhic discussion): . . . But how could Baba b. Buta have advised Herod to take apart the old Temple for the purpose of building a new one? Hasn't R. Hisda declared: "One must not take apart a synagogue until a new one has been erected"? If you wish, you may say he saw cracks in the old one; and if you wish, it may be said it is different with a king, who does not retract from his word, as Samuel said: If the king should say, "I will uproot mountains," he will uproot them and not go back on his word. A 1 . Herod was a servant of the Hasmoneans, 2. there was a girl among them upon whom he cast his eyes. 3. One day he heard a voice saying: a servant who should rebel now would succeed. 4.

They sent him the message: "If you have not as yet taken it apart, do not take apart; if you have already taken it apart, do not rebuild; 38. and if you have already taken it apart and also rebuilt, such is the custom of bad servants: they consult after the thing is already done. 39. Though your weapon is on you, your genealogical record, how- ever, is here in our archives, in which it can be seen that you are not a king [rekha], nor a des- cendant of a king. 40.

And if you wish, you may con- clude: [Genesis 41:43] 'and they cried before him, 'Abrek' [avrekh].'" Appendix A It was said that he who had not seen the Temple of Herod had never, in all his life, seen a fine building. With what material did he build it? Rabbah said: "With ornamented marble colored white and green," and some say, "colored blue, white, and green," the stones being not in a straight line, but alternately projecting and receding, the gaps being intended to receive the lime. He intended to cover it with gold, but the rabbis advised him: let it be, for as it is it has the appearance of the waves of the sea. ,-nnon *7X nmno ^ irfw nmno qki innsn inn xtzpa nay ,mm nmno dki ^ana ,x:n "in ^ ,ixd -pDO irn dn .Toyna wfrp [inny] oimn :ittd7 ?xm .■fra mw&amp;i -p nvn ■ojk .TDK ns1? ucip*! :ion» n^a "w n*n ^7 ,ovmn pan nxi xbv :rax .[vwn] nx: -pan ?n"an •'Koa .xizrai mrw •saxa :nm n&amp;K .x-izrai wry ,K*?mD mva :raxi kd'n .XTO Vapn ^n ,nDW Wi nsw P^DK »"? -QO ■»rna7 ,**90 tdw ,n,,p^ ."pm n,l7 rax .Kan NmrPK 90</page><page sequence="7">External Appearance versus Internal Truth - - i - 1 Appendix B But why did Baba give Herod such advice? Did not R. Yehudah in the name of Rav, or in the name of Yehoshua b. Levi, say that Daniel was punished for giving good advice to Nebukhadnezzar, as it is written [Daniel 4:24]: "Therefore, O king, may my advice be accep- table to you: Redeem your sins by beneficence," etc.? With the Tem- ple it was different, for except by a king, it could not be rebuilt at all. And whence do we know that Daniel was punished? "He was thrown into the lions' den [Daniel 4:6]." The characters and the historical background The characters of the story include historical figures from the time of Herod, who appear in the house of the Hasmoneans and the Romans. The story itself is not, most probably, a precise historical account; indeed, that is not its purpose. Instead, it is an Aggadah that has a historical kernel16 with which its creators 16. Regarding the various parts of the story in comparison with historical sources: On the story in general, see A. A. Halevy, Sha'arei ha 'aggadah (Tel Aviv: Gottenberg Press, 1982), 1 83- 88. On Herod and the Hasmonean girl, see Flavius Josephus, Jewish War , 1, 22, 1-5, ed. Loeb (London: Heinemann, 1927), 205-1 1; Avraham Shalit, Hordos ha-melekh - ha- 'ish u-fa 'olo (Jerusa- lem: Mossad Bialik, 1964), 40-43, 276-86. On the identity of the Hasmonean girl in the Aggadah, see also Ben-Zion Lurie, "Demuyot mi-zman kibbush Yerushalayim bi-yedey Sossius," Proceedings of the 4th World Congress for Jewish Studies (Jerusalem, 1969), 1:97, and, in contrast, Louis H. Feldman, Josephus and Modern Scholarship (Berlin: W. de Gruyter, 1984), 282. On part B of the Aggadah (the killing of the scholars), see Shalit, Hordos ha-melekh , 60-61 (and his footnotes, especially n. 10); on the building of the Temple, see ibid., 194ff. On Herod's personality, see Aryeh Kasher and Eliezer Witztum, King Herod: A Persecuted Persecutor: A Case Study in Psycho- history and Psychobiography, trans. Karen Gold (Berlin and New York: W. de Gruyter, 2007). At the forty-first annual conference of the Association for Jewish Studies (Los Angeles, December 2009), Jeffrey L. Rubenstein presented a paper titled "King Herod in Ardashir's Court: The Bavli Story of Herod (Bava Batra 3b-4a) in Light of Sasanian Sources." In this intriguing paper, Rubenstein demon- strated that the story of Herod discussed here was influenced not only by Josephus but also largely by several Sasanian traditions. Thus, it seems that previous scholarly rulings with respect to the histori- cal and literary kernels of the Herod story need to be reexamined. The idea that the Aggadah in Bava Batra is not a historical account, but rather a literary text based on a historical kernel, is supported by the fact that Part B of the story, dealing with the confrontation between Herod and the scholars, has several thematic parallels in the Talmud, which are very similar to the present story in their plot; they 91</page><page sequence="8">Yonatan Feintuch took the freedom to formulate and convey their message without being bound by precise historical facts.17 deal, however, with different characters. See B. Berakhot 48a; B. Sotah 47a (B. Sanhedrin 107b); B. Kiddushin 66b; B. Sanhedrin 19a. We find another tradition about King Yannai being brought before the Sanhedrin on account of his servant who committed murder, an event that ended with the death of all the Sanhedrin's scholars except for Shimon b. Shatah. This tradition parallels Josephus' account of Herod being brought before the Sanhedrin for killing thieves in the Galilee without a trial, and silen- cing the judges with his belligerent appearance, with the exception of one rabbi (possibly Shammai the Elder; see Shalit, Hordos ha-melekh, 33 and n. 151; concerning the relationship between the stories about Yannai and Herod, see also nn. 152-53), who threatened the reticent judges with punish- ment from heaven (Josephus Flavius, Jewish Antiquities , 14, 9, 4 [ed. Loeb, 539-43]). The relation between the characters of Herod and Yannai finds its expression also in the scholium of Megillat Ta'anit, in the passage that relates to the second of Shevat (ed. Noam, 109-110, MS F; cf. also 122): "The second of Shevat. . . . Mourning is forbidden . . . and why do they differ? On the first it is not written that mourning is forbidden as on the second. On the first, Herod had died and on this, King Yannai. . . ." Further on it is recounted that Yannai attempted to bring about the killing of all the scholars on the day of his death, but the attempt was thwarted by his wife. According to Schwartz (above, note 2), the phenomenon that part of the Herod stories were "transferred" in rab- binic literature to Yannai is related to the sparse contact between Herod and the religious world, in contrast with Yannai, who as a High Priest and a Hasmonean spurred more interest among the rabbis. Thus, for example, the story in B. Sanhedrin 19a about Yannai is actually the story about Herod, but Yannai 's name was inserted as the wicked king, and subsequently, Shimon b. Shatah 's character was also inserted. 17. About this issue, see, e.g., Moshe D. Herr, "Tefisat ha-historyah 'etzel-hazal," Proceedings of the Sixth World Congress for Jewish Studies (Jerusalem, 1977), 3:129-42; Jonah Fraenkel, Darkhei ha-'aggadah ve-hamidrash (Givatayim: Yad la-Talmud [Massada], 1991), 235-38, esp. 238; Shamma Y. Friedman, "La-'aggadah ha-historit ba-Talmud ha-Bavli," in Saul Lieberman Memorial Volume , ed. Shamma Y. Friedman (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1993), 1 19-63; Jeffrey L. Rubenstein, Talmudic Stories, Narrative Art, Composition, and Culture (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999), 3-8; Isaiah M. Gafni, "Tekufat ha-Mishnah ve-ha-Talmud: heker shenot dor - hesegim u-tehiyot," Cathedra 100 (2001), 215-26. Another general issue in the background of stories like that of the Herod story is the relationship between rabbinic literature and the writings of Flavius Jose- phus. This topic has already been the elaborated on by scholars, from many different angles. For example, Neusner (Jacob Neusner, The Rabbinic Traditions about the Pharisees before 70 [Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1999], 1:58-59; 387-88) points to parallels between the sages and Josephus, yet emphasizes the differences in the details between them. S. R. Isenberg (S. R. Isenberg, "Power through Temple and Torah in Greco-Roman Palestine," in Christianity, Judaism and Other Greco-Roman Cults: Studies for Morton Smith at Sixty, ed. Jacob Neusner [Leiden: Brill, 1975], 2:24- 52), conversely, agrees with Neusner that indeed there are sometimes differences in details between Josephus and rabbinic literature, yet he claims that it still appears that both sources lean on a common tradition, so that the differences do not express a real contradiction between the sources. Shaye J. D. Cohen, in "Parallel Historical Tradition in Josephus and Rabbinic Literature," Proceedings of the Ninth World Congress for Jewish Studies , BI [1986] 7-14) addresses several examples and claims that parallels in Josephus to rabbinic stories can be used as controls, through which one can learn about the historical precision and the modes of formulating stories by the rabbis. For additional references, see Feldman (note 16 above), 296. See also C. Milikowsky, "Josephus between Rabbinic Culture and Hel- lenistic Historiography," in Shem in the Tents of Japhet: Essays on the Encounter of Judaism and Hel- lenism, ed. Jacob L. Kugel (Leiden: Brill, 2002), esp. 181-90. 92</page><page sequence="9">External Appearance versus Internal Truth Another character is Baba b. Buta, a disciple of Shammai the Elder.18 Rab- binic literature alludes to several stories that attest to Baba's wisdom, piety, humi- lity, and honesty.19 Here, too, it is difficult to ascertain the historical reliability of the details, yet it seems fitting that Baba's character appears here beside Herod, because of the historical period as well as the character's traits.20 Literary analysis21 Form The Aggadah is composed mostly in Babylonian Aramaic and includes a story and two "appendices." The continuity is interrupted occasionally by alterna- tive traditions; these adopt the linguistic form of "some say" (lines 8-11, 32-33), and contain interpretive comments (lines 41-42). The story falls into four sections: A. Herod and the Hasmonean girl B. The killing of the scholars C. The conversation with Baba b. Buta, which may also be divided into the following parts: 1. Herod disguising himself and the "test" he gives Baba b. Buta 2. Herod's "revelation" and Baba b. Buta's advice D. The renovation of the Temple and Rome's reaction The two "appendices" consist of the following: A. The beauty and splendor of Herod's building22 B. A discussion about the legitimacy of Baba b. Buta's advice to a non- Jewish king with a short discussion about the biblical character of Daniel Each part, especially A and B, constitutes a story in itself. Nonetheless, they are woven into a single narrative framework in a fashion that creates literary unity in both content and structure: In both parts Herod murders an entire group whom 18. See T. Hagigah 2:1 1 (ed. Lieberman, 385); B. Beizah 20a; and cf. Yisrael Ben-Shalom, Beit Shammai u-ma'avak ha-kanna'im neged Roma (Jerusalem: Yad Izhaq Ben Zvi, 1994), 104-107. 19. See M. Keretot 6:3; B. Nedarim 66a; B. Gittin 57a. In B. Beizah 21a it is recounted that despite the fact that he belonged to the house of Shammai, he supported a ruling of the house of Hillel when he knew that this was the true ruling. See also Aaron Heiman, Toldot tann'aim ve-'amora'im (Jerusalem: Kirya Ne'emana, 1964), 1:261-62. 20. For the historical basis of Herod's and Baba b. Buta s meeting, see Flavius Josephus, Jewish Antiquities , 15, 7, 10; 15, 10, 4 (ed. Loeb, 123-27; 177-81); Ben-Shalom, Beit Shammai, 106. 21. For a comparison of various parts, expressions, and motifs in this story to parallels in Ancient Greek literature, see Halevy, Sha'arei ha' aggadah, 180-88. 22. Although in content this "appendix" constitutes a continuation of the story by discussing the renovation of the Temple, it is separated from the story by the opening term nttX" ("it was said"), and by the appearance of questions and answers, unlike the story that precedes it. 93</page><page sequence="10">Yonatan Feintuch he fears, and leaves one person who is useful to him. The comparison is empha- sized in the structure (lines: 4-5; 15-16 in the story text, above) ?"f7B t*?37 Dnzm ym nnpa tzm nax-r ra Kinn vm 7n nbv ,im ,rf7X&amp; xnwn Tnzn *ony *73 ,"pm inbiD1? inrbttp ap rrnna irrtns*? lna^ttp ap KtDin p am1?

Npi xripir frrnnnm ^ . . . m&amp; nw The repetition of the structure in the first two parts highlights the repeti- tive nature of Herod's actions, emphasizing a pattern that characterizes his personality: Herod is a paranoid, murderous tyrant who is willing to kill anyone standing in his way; he spares only those few who do not pose a threat for him and may be of use later on. The use of wordplay further draws the reader's attention to the similar purpose of sparing both the girl and the sage; such wordplay is apparent in the majority of the textual witnesses, between the word mora1? - to marry - with respect to the girl, and the expression no ra1? - to take advice - with reference to the sage. Central themes Two central themes are evident throughout the story and are stressed in recurrent vocabulary that serves as keywords:24 A. Servant versus king ("f?tt-"ny)25 B. Building versus destroying (HTno - mn) Each of these two themes relies on the tension that exists between two opposites, as we shall explore below. 23. This line does not appear in the textual witnesses M, F (see above, note 5); therefore, the comparison to the parallel sentence is only according to E, P, V. However, the content-related compari- son is obvious even according to M, F, as well as in the use of the Hebrew root n.0 J (in all the manu- scripts) with regard to the Hasmonean girl: 203 ra "'DTI "0. In general, it seems that the author of the story or the redactor made intentional use of the root 3.0.3, and thus it seems that the versions that include this root are preferable to those that contain an alternative such as 24. On keywords ( Leitwdrter ) see, e.g., Robert Alter, The Art of Biblical Narrative (New York: Basic Books, 1981) 88-113; Shimon Bar-Efrat, Ha-'itzuv ha-'omanuti shel ha-sippur ba-mikra (Tel Aviv: Sifriyat Po'alim, 1984), 22-23; and Rubenstein, Talmudic Stories , 251-53. Avraham Walfish, "Shitat ha-'arikha ha-sifrutit ba-Mishnah 'al-pi masekhet Rosh Hashanah" (PhD Diss., Hebrew Univer- sity of Jerusalem, 2001), 19, addresses rabbinic literature, and adds several additional criteria. 25. Secondary to this theme is that of rabbis versus kings in the second part of the story. In this part, Herod kills the rabbis and confronts Baba b. Buta, and it is possible that this implies the question about who a true king is, by way of the saying in B. Gittin 62a: "and they said: How do we know that rabbis are called kings? ... as it is written -By me kings reign etc.'" 94</page><page sequence="11">External Appearance versus Internal Truth A. Servant versus King A central theme in the Aggadah takes note of the roles of servant versus king (henceforth: servant-king). The Hebrew root T3.S7, meaning "servant," appears in the story six times (lines 1, 3, 6, 17, 38, 40) and occurs once more in Appendix B.26 The Hebrew root meaning "kingdom," appears seven times (five times in the story itself, in lines 11, 12, 20, 21, 34, and twice in an interpretive parenthetical clause, at line 41). The lines preceding the story contain two additional appearances, while Appendix B includes three.27 The servant-king theme is central to the content of the story as well. Herod is originally a servant (line 1) aspiring kingship. When the chance presents itself, he usurps the kingship by force and wipes out the royal family. Subsequently, tension follows with regard to the question of Herod's legitimate status as a king; issues remain about whether as a usurper he is still a servant or, indeed, a king. This tension about his status is expressed by several peripheral circles: the Hasmonean girl, the rabbis, and the Romans. The Hasmonean girl, in a dramatic proclamation, undermines the status of Herod and his house (line 6); then, by committing suicide, she prevents his marriage with the legitimate royal family. The rabbis threaten Herod's status by expounding the following verse: "From the midst of thy brethren shalt thou set up a king . . ." (line 12), thus denouncing the appointment of a king who is not officially of Jewish lineage.28 Finally, the "true" existing monarchy, the Roman Empire (termed in the story and its appendices as just xmrte ("the kingdom"), attenuates Herod's status as a king with the scorning sentence: "such is the custom of bad servants: they consult after the thing is already done . . . your genealogical record, however, is here in our archives, in which it can be seen that you are not a king (rekha), nor a descendant of kings" (line 39). They thus they declare that even if Herod in practice rules Judea and operates indepen- dently against their will, in their eyes he is still but a servant. The Roman Empire, because of its external status on the one hand and its undisputed rule on the other, constitutes a sort of mirror, reflecting the truth beyond all disguises and illusions. However, the external environment's attenuation of Herod's status does so no more than Herod does himself. His lack of confidence in his own status leads to his unsuccessful, repetitive attempts to reinforce it. Herod attempts to marry the king's daughter, a step that might provide official legitimacy to his reign. However, when his attempt fails, he tries (at least according to one 26. The root "7.3.S7 appears four additional times with a different meaning: "doing" (lines 17, 18, 36, 40). 27. The verse from Daniel, where the root appears twice consecutively, was counted as one appearance. The root appears one more time in line 38, meaning "consulting." 28. See Shalit, Hordos , 42, 60 (and n. 1 there), and cf. M. Sotah 7:8, the opposite attitude toward Agrippa regarding the same biblical verse (on the identity of this Agrippa, see Saul Lieberman, Tosefta ki-fshutah, Sotah, 638). However, cf. in T. Sotah 7:16 (ed. Lieberman, 196) there is criticism in the name of R. Natan of the attitude described in the Mishnah. On both sources, see Daniel R. Schwartz, Agrippas ha-rishon: melekh Yehudah ha-'aharon (Jerusalem: Zalman Shazar Center for Jewish History, 1987), 173-76. 95</page><page sequence="12">Yonatan Feintuch opinion)29 to create a superficial impression of marriage to the royal family by conserving the Hasmonean girl's body in honey and pretending that she remains alive. The biblical verse questioning the legitimacy of his rule, which Herod attributes to the rabbis, is described in the story as a thought passing through his mind; indeed, it is unclear whether the rabbis had actually threatened his rule. At any rate, he murders them. Herod continues to fear the only remaining rabbi and consequently blinds him. The story describes, with considerable irony, how Herod places a garland of lizards ('^H N^D') on Baba b. Buta's head.30 Within that plot, Herod intends to mock the rabbi,31 yet the narrator actually directs the irony back at Herod himself, as this act expresses, once again, Herod's lack of confidence in his own reign. Herod's dialogue with Baba b. Buta also reveals his self-doubt. Herod's act of disguising himself expresses the king's insecurity about his subject's loyalty, which leads to a desire to discover Baba b. Buta's true feelings toward him. To test Baba b. Buta's loyalty, Herod attempts in the dialogue to make claims against his own status as a king. Obviously, such a dialogue serves the function of expressing Herod's internal doubts. During the dialogue with Baba b. Buta, the latter employs various verses to support his decision not to be tempted to curse Herod. With the exception of the verse "nor put a curse upon a chieftain among your people" (Exodus 22:29), 32 the 29. The two versions in the Talmud (lines 8-11) express two opinions that had probably existed among the rabbis about Herod's motive for marrying the Hasmonean girl. (In actuality, both opinions find expression in the duality that exists at the beginning of the story: line 2 states that Herod "cast his eyes" upon the girl, as an introduction to the story and as a motive for the events that follow. In line 3, however, there is a description of a voice that promises success to the servant who rebels, which implies that the desire to rule is at the center of his motives.) These two aspects of Herod's actions are the basis for Shalit's discussion (above, n. 1 6) on the question of whether Herod's marriage to Miriam derived from his desire to strengthen the legitimacy of his rule or from his desire for her. 30. Concerning the meaning of the expression 'tft'W is a crown or garland, "" is interpreted by Marcus Jastrow (A Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerush- almi and the Midrashic Literature [New York: Judaica Press, 1985], 576) as "hedgehogs," while Sokol- off ( Dictionary , 533) translates it as "lizards." With regard to our issue, Jastrow writes: "Herod put around Baba's head a garland made of skin of hedgehogs which pricked his eyes out." In his interpret- ation of the entire sentence, Jastrow follows in the footsteps of Rashi, who interprets (beginning at the words IT1? nnx): is a vermin whose hair is hard as needles and he made a garland from its skin around his eyes." According to these interpretations, the garland itself served to blind the rabbi. However, it seems that the garland serves two separate purposes in the story: 1. "Crowning" the rabbi with a thorny crown (as a means of ridicule, which is ironically directed by the narrator at Herod himself as part of the theme of servant-king). Possibly an ironic metaphoric use is made here of a motif from the stories of the New Testament of a garland of thorns the Romans had placed on Jesus' head. 2. Blinding the rabbi, in order to weaken him and, simplify Herod's exploitation of him. 3 1 . See the previous note. 32. See above, note 12, about these lines being based on the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, as well as several Babylonian sources. In light of the fact that the use of this verse interrupts the sequence of the three parts of the verse from Ecclesiastes, it is possible that originally there had been three parts to Herod's persuading attempt and that the three had been answered by part of the verse from Ecclesiastes. At a later stage, the discussion about the verse from Exodus was transferred into the story because of the 96</page><page sequence="13">External Appearance versus Internal Truth three other verses consist of different parts of the same verse, Ecclesiastes 10:20: "Don't revile a king even among your intimates. Don't revile a rich man even in your bedchamber. For a bird of the air may carry the utterance, and a winged crea- ture may report the word." Analysis of Ecclesiastes 10 reveals that the connection between the chapter and the Aggadah about Herod is not limited to this verse alone. Several verses in the chapter, if read in the context of the Aggadah, contrib- ute significantly to the theme of servant-king. For example (verse 7): "I have seen slaves on horseback, and nobles walking on the ground like slaves" is a statement that matches the theme which, we assume, is central to the story. Likewise, verse 17: "Happy are you, O land whose king is a master (lit., a free man). . . ." It is unreasonable to ignore the silent cry of the narrator when he alludes to this chapter. Again, the verse cited by Baba b. Buta is but a link to the statements of Ecclesiastes 10, which add a valuable interpretation to the story.33 At the end of the dialogue, Herod explicitly reveals his insecurity by responding to Baba b. Buta's suggestion. Herod states, "I fear the Kingdom." Here the text contains an expression that parallels the words of Baba b. Buta, who had said, with regard to Herod (line 25), "I fear him." Herod is thus again presented in an ironic manner, being compared to the blind rabbi who fears him. Herod reveals that deep inside he is still a servant and that the only absolute reign is that of "the Kingdom" - the Roman Empire. In general, Herod's attempts to stabilize his status as a king, some of which are grotesque (e.g., conserving the body in honey) or just plainly pathetic, are unsuccessful, and the picture that emerges is ironic, as these attempts express his lack of self-confidence. Another literary device demonstrating the tension of the servant-king theme is found in the sophisticated wordplay in a message the Romans send to Herod: pnsn "inn xtzra nny. The simple literal translation of the sentence is thus: "Bad servants consult only after the deed is done." The Romans criticize Herod for rebuilding the Temple and then consulting his superiors (although to the reader this may allude also to Herod's slaying of all the rabbis and his sub- sequent consulting of Baba b. Buta on ways to correct the mistake). Yet the use of the Hebrew roots 1.2.V (servant) and (king) is not incidental, but rather creates an ambiguity related to the theme. The sentence may be read: xwn H3S? - bad servants, innsn "in - after being servants, p^Bna - attempt to become kings. Yet, as far as the Romans are concerned, such a move is meaningless: A servant remains a servant. relation to the content of the dialogue. This assumption, however, has no support in the textual witnesses. 33. I thank Assaf Englard for pointing out this connection to me. It is possible that there is a connection to additional verses in chapter 10. For example, verses 9-10, "... he who breaches a stone fence will be bitten by a snake. He who quarries stones will be hurt by them; he who splits wood will be hurt by it" might be interpreted, in the context of the story, as criticism regarding the destruction of the Temple and its renovation by Herod. Verse 12, "A wise man's talk brings him favor, but a fool's lips are his undoing," is an appropriate description of the dialogue between Herod and Baba b. Buta. 97</page><page sequence="14">Yonatan Feintuch The theme of servant-king is thus constructed on the gap, or tension, between the impression that Herod tries to create as a king and the internal, inevi- table truth, which exist both in the external environment and inside Herod himself, causing a constant questioning of the legitimacy of his moves. This tension is intensified in the story by another pair of keywords: eye/sight - voice/hearing: The Hebrew root (eye) appears in the story four times (at lines 2, 15, 32, 33); n.K.l/M.n (to see) appears twice in the story (5, 17) and three times in appen- dix A. These words emerge at key points, as shall be seen hereinafter. The story begins with Herod "casting his eyes"34 upon the Hasmonean girl, and from there his rebellion progresses. The episode of the Hasmonean girl ends with Herod conserving her body in honey for seven years. Here, indeed, the key words "pyor rPX"iare not mentioned. However, it is clear that the issue is creating a sort of visual illusion: an attempt to take someone who has died and pretend she is alive. The aim, at least according to one version (line 11), is to deceive the public by attempting to give Herod's kingship artificial legitimacy through the illusion of a marriage to the official dynasty. According to the second version, however, the assumption is that Herod's intention was to have intercourse with her; here the issue is to create a (self-) illusion, even if it is not necessarily visual. In a sense, the killing of the rabbis follows the same pattern. What troubles Herod is the verse "Be sure to set as king over yourself one of your own people." 34. There is an interesting parallel, which combines a motif related to eyes and the reversal of the status between a man and his master (B. Gittin 58a): "Rab Judah said in the name of Rab: What is signified by the verse, 'And they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage?' A certain man once cast his eyes upon the wife of his master, he being a carpenter's apprentice. Once, his master wanted to borrow some money from him. He said to him: Send your wife to me and I will lend her the money. So he sent his wife to him and she stayed three days with him. The master then came to him. Where is my wife whom I sent to you? he asked. He replied: I sent her away at once, but I heard that the youngsters played with her on the road. What shall I do? He said: If you listen to my advice, he replied, divorce her. But, he said, she has a large marriage settlement ( ketubah ). Said the other: I will lend you the money for her ketubah. So he went and divorced her and the other went and married her. When the time for payment arrived and he was not able to pay him, he said: Come and work off your debt with me. So they used to sit and eat and drink while he waited on them and tears used to fall from his eyes and drop into their cups. From that hour the doom was sealed. . , ." This Aggadah, like that of Herod, opens with the expression "cast his eyes upon . . ." and the casting of the eyes is upon the master's wife. At the end of the story, the tables have turned and the previously married master is now a servant without a wife serving his former apprentice, who is married to his wife. The story also concludes with the motif of the eyes: "and tears used to fall from his eyes" - the harm to the master is shaped in the story as being expressed by the eyes, giving the story a closed structure. Another story, in which Baba b. Buta also appears, opens with a man who "has cast his eyes" (B. Gittin 48b): "There was a man who cast his eyes upon his wife to divorce her, but hesitated because she had a big marriage settlement. He accordingly invited his friend and gave them a good feast and made them drunk and put them in one bed. He then brought the white of an egg and scattered it among them and brought wit- nesses and appealed to the court. There was a certain elder there of the disciples of Shammai the Elder, named Baba b. Buta, who said: This is what I have been taught by Shammai the Elder, that the white of an egg contracts when brought near the fire, but semen becomes faint from the fire. They tested it and found that it was so, and they brought the man to the court and flogged him, and made him pay her ketubah 98</page><page sequence="15">External Appearance versus Internal Truth Herod believes that in physically killing the rabbis he will abolish their doctrine and destroy the truth they express. The encounter between Herod and Baba b. Buta relies, to a large extent, on the symbolism of eyesight: Herod, who has blinded Baba b. Buta, approaches him, assuming that the latter is at a disadvantageous position. The story emphasizes the irony by phrasing Herod's opening sentence with the word see : "Let the master see what the bad servant Herod has done."35 It seems that Herod is trying to scorn the blind rabbi and emphasize his inferiority. Yet soon the tables are turned and it is the rabbi who has the upper hand. It is difficult to determine whether Baba b. Buta knew to whom he was speaking. One way or the other, however, he controls the conversation in an ironic and unexpected manner. All of Herod's attempts to thwart him are in vain. The story thus presents the issue of eyesight, whose absence in the rabbi not only does not harm him but possibly even contributes to his triumph. Since eyesight has a misleading and deceiving potential, sometimes the blind, who act without it, "see" the precise truth.36 Herod then admits his mistake and asks for advice on how to correct it. Baba b. Buta's response emphasizes the issue of eyesight (line 39 on): "You have blinded the eye of the world." The word eye here has double meaning: It is metaphorical, in the sense of rabbis being the eye of the world, but it also has the simple literal significance of Baba b. Buta's eye, which had been blinded. Here, the story again implies that true sight is not necessarily the sight of the eye, but is something deeper. "The eye of the world" means the rabbis, who represent Torah and wisdom, which are independent of external eyesight. The path of repentance suggested to Herod is also phrased in terms relating to eyesight. The expression "the eye of the world" (or its equivalent in the alterna- tive version, "the light of the world") has double meaning: It holds an obvious metaphorical connotation - the Temple, which like the rabbis, constitutes "the eye of the world" because of the Torah that emanates from it. There is also a more physical meaning, since Herod's reform is related to the external aspect of beautifying the appearance of the building: a positive occupation with the outward appearance of things in place of a negative one. In the appendix, we learn that Herod intended to cover the building with gold. It is possible that this statement parallels the idea of Herod's covering the Hasmonean girl with "golden" honey. The consistency of his actions is emphasized: Herod, even when he makes amends, acts like Herod, through external appearances. 35. This sentence contains the previous motif as well: Herod calls himself a servant and with Baba b. Buta's answer n,l7 T3S7X the story plays on the words between them. 36. In worldwide literature, use is made of the motif of the blind person seeing the truth better than those who can see, cf. Jonah Fraenkel, Sippur ha- 'agada: 'ahdutshel tokhen ve-zura (Tel Aviv: ha-Kibbutz Ha-Meuhad, 2001), 302-303 and n. 30 there, and 21 1 n. 50, and his reference to Sophocles' stories. See also B. Berakhot 58a: "The blind R. Sheshet . . ." - the blind rabbi "sees" better than the seeing heretic. At the end of the story, the heretic is blinded according to one version, and according to the other is killed by R. Sheshet, with an ironic use of the expression "cast his eyes upon." 99</page><page sequence="16">Yonatan Feintuch In his actions toward the Romans, Herod repeats the pattern of attempting to delude and deceive.37 The Romans, however, expose his intentions in a clear and scathing manner; their harsh response emphasizes the gap between Herod's ambi- tions and their realization. Eyesight versus hearing. The limits of eyesight are shown through a contrast to the sense of hearing. The sense of hearing is real and not an illusion. The story opens with a voice,38 according to which a servant who should rebel "now" would succeed. Indeed, Herod seizes the opportunity and his rebellion succeeds, com- pleted through the killing of all his masters' descendants. The next use of the sense of hearing (or in this case, voicing) is in the words of the Hasmonean girl (line 6). The story emphasizes that she raises her voice and orally expresses the inner truth that is interwoven in the whole story. She reveals that both the servant who had become a king and his descendants rule illegitimately; their real status remains that of servants. In the discussion of Herod with Baba b. Buta, the power of sounds and voices in uncovering the truth is also emphasized: Baba b. Buta answers Herod's claim about their being alone with the following claim: "for a bird of the air may carry the utterance . . (line 27). Unlike eyesight, which has a limited focus onto those who are present, and from which one can hide visual things, sounds are not limited or blocked by screens (physical nor metapho- rical). What is said will eventually be discovered.39 Eyesight is thus exhibited by the story as an inferior sense with many limitations. This sense is often misleading or deceiving, whether done intentionally or without intention. This idea intensifies in light of what was said previously, that Herod is a servant attempting to rule, and succeeds in doing so in certain external senses, yet fails in other, more essential, ones. To a large extent, Herod's success in achieving royal status depends on various visual illusions. The sense of eyesight is presented as a possible means for creating an external illusion that lacks real truth behind it. B. Building versus Destroying This theme appears in the story in a more limited manner than the previous one, at least in a literal sense. The terms building and destroying occur mainly in the last part. All in all, the Hebrew root l.n.O (destroy) appears five times, and the root n.m (build) three times. Herod, according to Baba b. Buta's advice, destroys the existing building of the Temple in order to build another one in its place. But in a sense beyond the literal, the theme exists in other places in the story as well. In fact, Herod "destroys" a whole layer of rabbis and is advised to "build" something parallel, the Temple, to correct what he had destroyed. The story also begins with 37. About the three years of the messenger to Rome cf. M. Baba Batra 3:2 and M. Yoma 6:8, regarding the sign according to which the scapegoat has reached its destination. 38. Indeed, in the printed editions the expression "Divine voice" appears, but in most manu- scripts the expression does not occur (see above, note 4). 39. The evaluation of eyesight mentioned in this paragraph (and its opposite regarding hearing) is, of course, quite radical. In practice, of course, the sense of eyesight can also reveal the truth, just as the sense of hearing has its own limitations. In the story, the purpose is to highlight the disadvantages of the sense of eyesight, in order to emphasize its potential dangers. 100</page><page sequence="17">External Appearance versus Internal Truth Herod "destroying" the house of the Hasmoneans. This destruction, however, does not find its correction in the story. The links between the Aggadah and the talmudic sugya within which IT IS INTEGRATED The Aggadah of Herod appears after a talmudic discussion about the first section of the Mishnah (Baba Batra 1:1), consisting of the following two statements: If two jointholders agreed to make a partition in a courtyard, they must build a wall in the middle. Wherever it is the local custom to build with untrimmed stones, [or with] hewn stones, [or with] half-bricks, [or with] bricks - so they must build it. . . . The talmudic discussions preceding the Aggadah relate to these two statements in the Mishnah: 1 . There is a discussion about the law of damage of "sight," presented through an interpretive discussion about the concept of "partition" in the Mishnah. 2. There is a discussion about the possible building materials of the partition, which includes three parts: a. An interpretive discussion about the words ,rrtt (untrimmed stones, hewn stones, half-bricks, bricks) that appear in the Mishnah. b. A discussion about building materials, following the examples in the Mishnah. c. A discussion about destroying a synagogue and rebuilding it. At the end of this discussion appears the Aggadah about Herod. As men- tioned, this Aggadah is simply part of the discussion about the ruling of R. Hisda, which forbids the destruction and rebuilding of a synagogue. With this prohibition in the background, the Talmud ques- tions the advice Baba b. Buta had given Herod to destroy the Temple and rebuild it. Indeed, the theme of destroying and building is impor- tant, as demonstrated above. However, it is unclear why the entire unit, which opens with the discus- sion on R. Hisda's ruling and ends with the Aggadah about Herod, was placed in its present location in the BT. This unit does not relate directly to the Mishnah nor to the talmudic segment before it, which deals, following the Mishnah, with various building materials. Seemingly, the natural location of R. Hisda's ruling about destroying a synagogue and then rebuilding would be in the fourth chapter of tractate Megillah (26a-b), where a discussion about pre- cisely this matter - destroying a synagogue - is found. Indeed, R. Hisda's ruling appears there. However, the rest of the discussion about R. Hisda's ruling, which appears in Bava Batra, does not appear in the Megillah sugya , although its 101</page><page sequence="18">Yonatan Feintuch insertion there would be more natural. Since we are not dealing with the Megil- lah tractate, we shall not go into detail about its discussion. Nevertheless, an attempt should be made to understand the appearance of the discussion about destroying and building and the story of Herod in Bava Batra, assuming that the lines from "and R. Hisda said" until the end of the story about Herod form one unit. Theoretically, the integration of this unit into its present context may be explained in several ways: A. A link to the previous talmudic section: the section that precedes the dis- cussion about destroying and building deals, following the Mishnah, with the various building materials with which the partners build the partition between them. The discussion about the building materials develops into one about 'pop'io HEN - the partition that had existed in the Temple and separated the outer sanctum from the inner. In this context, the difference between the First and Second Temples is mentioned. One difference between the two is expressed in the proclamation "great shall be this second house," which states that the advantage of the Second Temple over the First is in its magnificence. To this we may tie the story about Herod and its discussion about the Temple's splendor after Herod's reno- vation. It is plausible that the whole unit dealing with the building of a synagogue and its destruction has been presented in this context. This link seems to be the most direct and therefore the most reasonable expla- nation for inserting the unit into its present location. B. The link between the Aggadah about Herod and the first talmudic section on the Mishnah, which deals with "damage of sight." This type of damage is caused by one's ability to gaze intrusively into a neighbor's private area. The Talmud discusses the question of whether "damage of sight is considered damage."40 In the Aggadah about Herod, as we have seen, a central motif relates to the sense of eyesight. The story deals intensively with the evaluation of this sense, mainly from a negative perspective. The Aggadah about Herod, however, does not explicitly mention the concept of damage of sight. Yet the story begins with the words, "Herod was a servant of the Hasmoneans. There was a girl among them upon whom he cast his eyes ." The expression "cast his eyes," at the very least, implies damage of sight in the sense of gazing 40. This discussion is not directly related to the Mishnah. Its natural context is the last section of the third chapter, which discusses cases of damage of sight. The redactors of the tractate had chosen, in a somewhat artificial manner (by a connection to an interpretive question about the word partition in the Mishnah), to place this discussion at the beginning of the tractate, probably because the discussion, by the way it progresses, surveys many of the tannaitic sources that deal with the laws of neighbors, which is the subject of the first chapter. On saboraic discussions of such kind, which are placed at the begin- ning of the tractate, see Abraham Weiss, ha-Yezirah shel hasavora 'im (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1913), 8 and onward; Yehudah Brandes, "Ha-Messukha ha-rishona," in: 'Al derekh ha- 'Avot, ed. Amnon Bazak, Shmuel Vigoda, and Meir Munitz (Alon Shevut: Tevunot, 2001), 33-47. 102</page><page sequence="19">External Appearance versus Internal Truth at something that does not belong to oneself, the royal family obviously being out of limits for the servant Herod.41 We have seen that a central point in the story concerns Herod's action on the external-visual plane, whether in an attempt to deceive or in order to redeem himself. It might thus be said that the desire to present the story of Herod in rela- tive proximity to the discussion of damage of sight had influenced, at least as an additional secondary consideration, the integration of the whole unit about destroying and rebuilding synagogues into the chapter. Alternatively, it is possible that after its integration, the relative proximity of the Aggadah about Herod to the discussion about damage of sight had influenced the content and design of the Aggadah. At the very least, it could be said that reading the story in the context of the discussion about damage of sight, which, in a sense, precedes the story though it is not adjacent to it, might draw the reader's attention to the issues related to eyesight in the story and the ethical views expressed in it.42 The precise circumstances of the integration of the Aggadah about Herod into its present context at the beginning of the first chapter of Baba Batra are not entirely clear 43 The story in itself is the only source in rabbinic literature that deals with the character of this tyrant, whose reign undoubtedly had a great impact, positively and negatively, on the final hundred years of the Second 41 . It may be argued that Herod's casting his eyes at the girl is not precisely identical to gazing into a private domain in the sense indicated in the formal damage of sight. However, Herod's deed is, in the least, one type of usage of eyesight (whether physical or metaphorical; it seems, in this case, to be both) in a negative, intrusive manner. See, e.g., negative uses of the expression "cast his eyes" in T. Ketuvot 12:2 (ed. Lieberman, 95); B. Gittin 58a (above, note 34); and B. Sotah 9a. 42. Conversely, it is possible that the story adds an ideological point of view to the discussion. The discussion about damage of sight, which is halakhic-legal in nature, typical of the laws of torts, explores the halakhic-legal question of whether damage of sight is legally defined as damage. The dis- cussion does not contain moral and ethical questions, which deviate from the domain of conviction or exemption, and even the legal question had not been decided upon in the discussion. The story, however, does not deal with the legal domain, but rather, the ethical one. It does not deal specifically with damage of sight, but in a more comprehensive manner, with the sense of eyesight in general. This occupation with the sense of eyesight expresses a certain ethical view of this sense and its limitations: It is presented by the story, as shown above, as limited in the best of cases and as misleading and deceiv- ing in the worst. Herod uses the appearance of things in order to deceive others, whereas the blind rabbi, who cannot use this sense, penetrates through Herod's "disguise" and overcomes the king with his words. 43. For a general discussion on the redactional setting of stories in the BT, see Rubenstein, Tal- mudic Stories , esp. 15-24, 32, 255-67; Feintuch, diss., esp. 19-28. In the latter, I have demonstrated the existence of substantial thematic and literary links between the majority of the stories in the tractate Nezikin and their halakhic contexts. In such cases, I have shown, new light is shed on the both the halakhic and the aggadic parts of the sugya as a result of reading the Aggadah in its wider halakhic context. Thus, both halakhah and Aggadah benefit from their juxtaposition in one context. However, the Herod story is one of the exceptions in the tractate Nezikin. As shown above, the links between this story and its wider halakhic context are vague, and thus it is difficult to point to any specific new light that is shed on the story as a result of reading it in its BT context. 103</page><page sequence="20">Yonatan Feintuch Temple, and had left its architectural mark on the Land of Israel. By means of the rich and sophisticated literary design of this story, the Talmud has succeeded in drawing the paranoid and internally torn character of Herod. It appears that the story, which describes also Herod's desire to correct some of his wrong deeds and attributes to him the significant enterprise of the renovation and expansion of the Second Temple, reflects a complex and somewhat ambivalent attitude, at least of the redactors of the BT, toward the man and his eminent architectural project. Yet at the same time, the creators of the story express a profound world- view about the relationship between what the eye can see and the inner truth that often underlies the appearance of things.
