The fragment describes a debate con cerningcerning the identity of Elijah and his connection to the zealous act of of Phineas. The debate, which probably took place in the early thirteenth thirteenth century in Fustat, occurred in reaction to a synagogue performance performance of Havdalah liturgical poetry. The arguments for and and against the poems were based on aggadic traditions. A survey survey of relevant piyyutim reveals that this debated motif was indeed indeed subject to variations and alterations. A similar development can can be traced in the evolution of another Havdalah piyyut com posed posed by Rabbi Yehudah Ha-Levi. The fluidity of the poetic texts likely likely reflects the same literary hierarchy presented in the events recorded recorded in the Genizah fragment (and at the same time reinforced by by them): a growing appreciation of the authority of aggadic midrash,midrash, alongside the perception of the Havdalah piyyut as as creative performance, and not as an authoritative source of knowledge. Introduction "A literary canon is always the product of a social process, of continuous and dynamic interaction between the author, the audience, and the work itself... all those agents that unconsciously or intentionally publish, purchase, preserve, hold, present, quote, translate, mention, imitate or perform a literary work re-establish its cultural value.,'י Hence, the study of the reception and canoniza tion of literary genres and works in the communities of the Genizah demands the incorporation of data that was previously discussed in separate academic fields. It has to cross the common boundaries between the "Documentary Genizah" and the "Literary Genizah.,,2 The unique nature of the Cairo 1.

The Genizah preserved not only the remnants of the lit erature itself and inventory lists of books,3 but also vivid pictures of the auth ority attributed to different works and genres, as reflected in private notes and in records of public events. The relation between piyyut and midrash was of significant concern to Jewish scholars in Christian Europe, where a vast literature of commentaries examining the aggadic sources of piyyut was written.4 Examination of a particular Genizah text will reveal some rare evidence for an Eastern perspective on the topic. An overlooked Judeo-Arabic Genizah fragment, ENA 637.4-5, testifies to interesting events that took place one Saturday evening in a certain synagogue, perhaps the Babylonian synagogue in Fustat,5 probably in the early thirteenth century.6 The text recounts two incidents in which cantors recited Havdalah 171-271.

On the basis of the finding presented here one should add the two additional fragments to the one already listed by Sklare (ENA 3240.28). The text mentions Rabbi Shmariah Ha-Cohen—probably a late eleventh to early twelfth century scholar—whose name and literary work is preserved only in the Genizah, and again, was not known after the classical Genizah period, and not beyond eastern geo-cultural circles.

And he was asked: Why are you saying so? And he answered: For years we were of the opinion that Elijah is Phineas, until one day, a cantor came by our place, and stood up for prayer, reciting liturgical poetry, and said: "... Elijah the son of Yeroham". When he concluded his prayer I told him: How dare you say that Elijah is the son of Yeroham? Behold, he is the son of Eleazar! And he answered me: No, O Rabbi, Elijah is not Phineas, he is the son of Yeroham of the tribe of Benjamin, as seen in Chronicles.... I asked him: But what is your evidence that this [identifi cation] is true? He told me: You may find it explicitly in Bereshit Rabbah: . .and he [Elijah] came and stood in front of [them, and he said to them, My masters, why are yo]u debating about me. I [am from the descendants of Rachel".7 And] when I considered this statement...in Bereshit Rabbah in Parashat Va-yezeVa-yeze Ya'akov, I was convinced by this view, namely that Elijah is from the sons of Benjamin, and he is not Phineas, as people think. In the first event presented in the text, a cantor recites the alphabetical piyyut איש אזור איזור עור במותניו (A man, girt with a girdle of leather around his loins).8 When the cantor concludes his prayer, he is criticized by a member of the congregation, who insists that one line in the poem, איש טען רומח בידו (a man, who held a spear in his hand) wrongly identifies Elijah with Phineas. This person backs up his criti cism by relating an account of a previous incident in which another cantor was forced to justify the wording of a Havdalah piyyut. In this previous case, the cantor in question performed a piyyut that assumed the descent of Elijah from the tribe of Benjamin, including the words שלח מבשר לעם מורחם / אליהו בן ירוחם (Send a herald to a beloved (/pitied) people / Elijah the son of Yeroham, from the piyyut יה חזקי, (God, my strength)).9 The recitation of this piyyut provoked criti cism from the congregation, as this statement contradicted the prevailing view that identified Elijah with Phineas the son of Eleazar, the priest. The cantor justified himself by quoting 1 Chronicles 8:27 ("Jaareshiah, Elijah, and Zichri were the sons of Yeroham".), but the biblical verse was not considered sufficient support for the deviating view. The cantor, was asked for evidence (?ומא דלילך אן דאך), 7. Bereshit Rabbah, Va-yeze Ya'akov, par. 71:9, to Genesis 30:11 (ed. Albeck, 3:833-835). 8.

Yeroham of the tribe of Benjamin in 1 Chronicles. This argument succeeded in convincing the nar rator of this story of Elijah's Benjaminite descent. As such, he now objects to litur gical poetry that identifies Elijah with Phineas. Canonization in the Public Arena: an Analysis of the Events The events described here are an example of the social location of non institutionalized aspects of literary canonization.11 Institutionalized canonization implies an official and normative definition of a literary corpus as the canon. It establishes the boundaries of the canon, defining which works are included and which are excluded. In many cases it also secures the stabilization of the text, as it defines various mechanisms for that purpose. Institutional canonization is frequently accompanied by a foundational narrative about the origin of the canon, either by presenting its legendary, sacred, or revelatory source or by doc umenting its (imaginary) public affirmation by recognized bodies or key historical figures. However, the process of canonization is not only of an official nature. It also involves various means through which the canonical status of a work is mani fested, performed, and mediated to the public. Canonical works are subject to a continuous process of interpretation that ensures their relevance for society; their importance is marked in public by various means, such as the physical appearance of the books. These works are generally discussed in a manner that informs people about their importance. Their content is frequently mediated through public performance or educational means, as these works are taught, translated, dramatized, and interpreted. Similar forces and social dynamics also act to establish the cultural value of literary corpora or works that are not subject to full and institutionalized cano nization, yet enjoy certain cultural importance. Aggadic midrash is a good example, being subject to some aspects of canonization, but not granted the same canonical status of the Hebrew Bible, or even the Mishnah or the Babylo nian Talmud. The events presented in our fragment both reflect the role and status of aggadic midrash and take part in establishing its canonicity. First, we learn that the people involved in this process considered aggadic midrash to be an authoritative source. In the first event an argument from the midrash was accorded authority. It was used to justify the content of the piyyut, and was accepted by the individuals involved. It is important to notice the two stages in the dialogue between the cantor and his opponent. First, the opponent 10. Ed. Albeck, 3:833^835. 11. 11. For further reading on the approach applied here see Moshe Halbertal, People of the Book: Canon,Canon, Meaning, and Authority (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1997); Margalit Finkel berg and Guy Stroumsa, Homer, the Bible and Beyond: Litera/y and Religious Canons in the Ancient World (Leiden: Brill, 2003); Ha-kanon ha-samuv min ha- 'ayin, ed. M. Ben-Sasson et al. 288</page><page sequence="5">Literary Canonization at Work challenged the cantor for not identifying Elijah with Phineas. The cantor defended this view by referring to the biblical verse in 1 Chronicles. The answer did not satisfy the opponent—the biblical verse was not considered by the protagonist to provide sufficient support. It was at this moment that the cantor suggested the sources in Bereshit Rabbah. The rabbinic source was accepted as evidence. This short dialogue is emblematic of the complicated relationship between the biblical and rabbinic canons. On the one hand the Bible is considered the primary canon and holy text; on the other hand the rabbinic tradition is the authoritative source for biblical interpretation. This creates an interesting situ ation. The biblical text is the primary canon of rabbinic Judaism. Its authority and importance are manifested in many ways, including by rabbinic interpret ations. At the same time the biblical text is also dependent on its rabbinic interpretation. It is only through the rabbinic tradition that the meaning of the bib lical text can be established. To that extent, the rabbinic interpretation holds greater authority than the biblical text per se. In Halbertal's discussion of the tension between the two corpora in the curriculum he quotes a late reflection on the topic: Bible study does not cause anyone to be pious, because we cannot understand the foundations of our sacred Torah which is the written Torah, except through the oral Torah which is its interpretation. And even a little Talmud is enough to bring more fear of God than much learning of other subjects.12 This sort of dynamic might be manifested in the events documented in our Genizah fragment. The biblical verse can be established only on the basis of its rabbinic interpretation. Halbertal's discussion justly focuses on the Babylonian Talmud as the most canonical rabbinic work. In the events documented in our frag ment the authoritative rabbinic text derives from the aggadic corpus—Bereshit Rabbah— and not from the Babylonian Talmud. The aggadic text is granted auth ority usually ascribed to the Talmud. A slightly different rhetoric of authority is implied in the detailed discussion of sources that follows the narrative portion of the fragment. Here we find clues pointing to the common hierarchy between the Babylonian Talmud and other rab binic texts, according to which their authority is dependent on the verification of their view in the Babylonian Talmud, as stated by Amram bar Sheshna Gaon: "Every baraita which the Amoraic rabbis do not contest in the Talmud—the hala khah follows them".13 In the first stage of the discussion the author announces that the text from Bereshit Rabbah persuades him that Elijah is not Phineas, and this opinion is further established for him when he finds a support for it in the Talmud (ENA 637.4b, lines 6-7). Just as Rav Amram bar Sheshna asserts 12. 12. Shlomoh ben Mordekhai, Mizbah ha-zahav (Basel, 1604), 12a, quoted by Halbertal, The People People of the Book, 99. 13.

The language used by our author here echoes geonic discussions that question the reliability of aggadah. Our text reads ותאכד ענדי דלק מן קולהום פי תלמוד (and this view became established for me on the basis of their statement in the Talmud ...);14 a similar expression is found in regard to the authority of aggadah in a statement by Sherira Gaon: והנכון מהם מה שמתחזק מן השכל ומן המקרא (and the true [statements] among them [the aggadic statements] are those that can be validated on the basis of logic or on the basis of the Bible).15 These state ments are examples of the cultural work of the language of canonization. The same mechanism is at work in both statements. The authority of aggadic literature as a body of knowledge and traditions is dependent on one's ability to validate it on the basis of another source of knowledge. Sherira Gaon dictated that the validating bodies of knowledge are the Bible and logic; the author of our text turns to the Talmud. We should also note that cognate words are used here to mark the relations between the different bodies of knowledge (the fragment: תאכד [became established]; Sherira: מתחזק [can be validated]).16 To a certain extent we can see the relationship between aggadah and the Talmud as a merger of the two geonic principles quoted above. The three state ments follow the same pattern: the authority of an external, less canonical body of knowledge is subject to validation by a higher body of knowledge. Yet, there is an interesting shift. The field The external source The canonical source of knowledge of knowledge Sherira aggadah aggadic midrash Bible / Logic Amram b. halakhah baraitas (i.e Tosefta) The Talmud Sheshna Our Genizah text aggadah aggadic midrash The Talmud As we shall see below, our text is later than the geonic texts. It reflects an interesting process in which a model that was used for establishing the authority of the Babylonian Talmud over external materials in the context of halakhah is now exercised for marking the superiority of aggadic traditions in the Talmud. As such it demonstrates the process by which the cultural stance of the Babylonian Talmud was expanded from its initial role as a normative canon to its later function also as a formative canon, as brilliantly explained by Moshe Halbertal.17 This process is not only an expression of the greater importance granted to the 14.

Blau, Dictionary, 96. 290</page><page sequence="7">Literary Canonization at Work Talmud, but also of the increased importance of aggadic materials in this Egyptian milieu. In that sense, when the author of our text applies the model of examining an external text against the Babylonian Talmud, previously invoked only for halakhic texts, he raises the degree of importance of the aggadah, bringing it closer to that of the halakhah. So far we have noticed three different reflections of canonicity in our frag ment: first, the establishment of rabbinic authority over that of the plain meaning of the text. This was shown in the presentation of the aggadic midrash as evidence, while the biblical text alone was not accepted as a sufficient proof text. Second, rabbinic authority was granted to a work of aggadic midrash in a manner that seems to equate its importance with that of the Babylonian Talmud. Last, we ana lyzed in detail the mechanism that preserves the hierarchy between talmudic and aggadic sources, reflected in the need to support the aggadah with a text from the Talmud. The importance of the incidents documented here goes beyond the docu mentation of common perceptions about the canonical relations among the various works. What we see here is not only how people rated the different literary corpora involved, but also an example of the social context within which these hierarchies were communicated.18 These events demonstrate how literary prefer ences are encoded in and disseminated through public behavior. The events took place in the synagogue, in a public arena. It is quite possible that other people lis tened to the conversation between the cantor and his opponent. They heard the cantor basing his argument on biblical verses; they heard that his opponent (who was possibly his rabbi; the cantor addressed him with the title "יא רבי," [oh, rabbi]) was not satisfied with it; they heard the name of the work Bereshit Rabbah, so even if they were laymen who never studied the work, at least they became aware of the existence of the book; they heard the opponent accept the argument that was based on the midrash. Such incidents are part of a wider means through which agents of the canon spread their canonical preferences among the public.19 After being persuaded by the aggadic text, the opponent, who is also the narrator of our text, brings it again into the public arena, in the second event. According to the narrator, he challenged a different cantor who per formed a piyyut expressing the common view that Elijah is Phineas. He uses this event as an opportunity to recall the earlier incident. The second event became another moment of social interaction that enabled the public dissemination of the hierarchical relationship between the various texts. 18.1 refer here to the account of the events as a reliable report. Even if the text is fictional, we should assume that it portrays common social interactions that may have happened in its time and place. 19. The idea of canon agents is based on the concept of canon makers, suggested by Donna Bennet, "Conflicted Vision: A Consideration of Canon and Genre in English-Canadian Literature," in Canadian Cations: Essays in Literary Values, ed. Robert Lecker (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1991), 131-149. For another application of this model in a similar context see Moshe Lavee, "'Sefer haggadot yihiye le-fi ha-seder ha-'aharon: ma'amad ha-midrash ve-ha-'aggadah be-reshimot ha-sefarim shel Rav Yosef Rosh Ha-Seder," in Ha-kanon ha-samuy min ha- 'ayin, ed. Ben Sasson et al., 38-87. 291</page><page sequence="8">MosheMoshe Lavee In that sense, it is important to note that the quotations of the Bible and the midrash, and the acceptance of the midrash, are presented in the account of the event itself, while the further support from the Talmud is presented later on in the text, as part of the scholastic discussion that follows. Here the author addresses the audience with his written piece, and offers further arguments in favor of the view that he accepted in public. The social impact of a written text is not the same as that of an event in the synagogue. In these events we can see the cantor and his opponent as agents of the canon, and the events as social opportu nities in which they communicate to the wider public the sets of literary prefer ences they hold and the different cultural values they ascribe to the various texts involved. The following analysis will use this theoretical framework to assess the canonical relationship of midrash and piyyut demonstrated in the events discussed above. Havdalah liturgical poetry is not perceived in our text as an authoritative source of knowledge. Rather, it is seen as promoting a view expressed by the indi vidual cantors. The cantors are asked to defend and justify the claims hinted at in the texts they performed. The midrash, on the contrary, is understood as the source of correct knowledge. It is important to recall that a similar relationship between midrash and piyyut piyyut is also found in the literary genre of piyyut commentary. Here too, aggadic texts are perceived as the sources of knowledge performed in liturgical poetry.20 In that sense these commentaries propound the same hierarchy implied in the events presented in our fragment. However, there are two significant differ ences between the appearance of this kind of argument in our fragment and in the commentaries, apart from the different geo-cultural and historical contexts in which they appear. The first difference refers to the social setting. Commentaries on piyyutim were written works, part of a wider intellectual project of the scholarly elite. The role of the midrash as the source for the piyyut was presented here only to scholars. The Genizah fragment presents events, and as such it documents the communication of this model to the wider public. Second, when this argument is presented as part of a commentary on the piyyut, it also functions as another canonical mechanism, one that marks the importance of piyyut. Commentaries are written on canonical works; even the physical appearance of the texts on manu scripts might mark the importance of the text commented upon, in its large, square font and punctuation, in comparison to the smaller, cursive font of the commen tary. The existence of the genre of commentaries to piyyut groups this literary form with the Bible and the Talmud; while the aggadic midrash is quoted here as the source of the knowledge, the context marks it as secondary, as a supportive means for the interpreted piyyut. The use of the same model of argumentation in the public event in the synagogue in order to either defend or challenge the text of the piyyut is different from the use of this model in written commentaries. 20. Urbach, 'Arugat ha-bosem 4:155 and introduction; Grossman, Hakhmei Zarfal, 507-38; and Hollender, Piyyut Commentaries, 89-107. 292</page><page sequence="9">Literary Canonization at Work It is also important to note that the piyyut discussed in our fragment was composed in the period of the Genizah, and would have had only a relatively mar ginal place in the liturgy. Such recent compositions were constantly being com posed and brought to synagogues by hazzanim; the congregants likely felt free to critique these new compositions in a way they wouldn't have done with more ancient texts. In contrast, the scholarly commentaries discussed previously explicated piyyutim whose creation was more or less coeval with that of the midrash, such as Yannai's piyyutim from the Byzantine era. It is possible that, unlike more contemporary compositions, Yannai's works were perceived as being as authoritative as the classical midrashic works. The analysis of the events quoted above demonstrates how social inter actions play a role in the establishment of the canonicity of the various literary works and genres involved in them. The events recorded in the Genizah fragment reflect a growth in the cultural value ascribed to aggadic midrash, here exercised in a manner that marks it as more authoritative than piyyut. We shall now turn to two additional discussions that will help us to further establish the nature of these events as emblematic of the growing importance granted to aggadic midrash and to the lack of authority of Havdalah poetry. First, identifying the literary and historical context of the events recounted in our fragment will help us to locate them at the moment of a change in the perception of aggadic midrash in the East. Second, a survey of Havdalah poetry will demonstrate the lack of stab ilityility of these texts at the time, and will suggest that this textual instability was also motivated by the very same issue that was raised in the events: the identification of Elijah with Phineas and his presentation as the zealot who killed the adulterous couple. Textual stability is another aspect of the canonical status of a literary piece. The instability of Havdalah poetry and its susceptibility to changes inspired by aggadic traditions is another field in which the canonical relations between the two genres are exercised, manifested, and established. The Literary and Historical Background of the Events Let us turn to the historical and literary setting of these interesting incidents. At the core of the events is the debate about the identification of Elijah with Phineas. Where did the different views on this question come from, and where and when were they held? What is the historical context in which a cantor may arrive at a synagogue and perform a piyyut that included the view that Elijah is not Phineas, against the view that was commonly held by the audience? The identification of Elijah with Phineas might have its roots in early rabbinic tra ditions,21 as hinted at in patristic literature and in pseudo-Philo, and also reflected 221. For surveys of the views concerning the identification of Elijah and Phineas see Louis Ginz burg, The Legends of the Jews, vol. 4 (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1954), 195-97 and vol. 6:316-317 n. 3; Theodor Albecks's comments to Bereshit Rabbah 71:9, to Genesis 30:11 (ed.

It is repeated in Midrash Tanhuma, and in Seder' Eliyahu, and is also quoted by the Tosafists from an unknown geonic responsa.26 In addition, these views are 22. See Hayward, "Phinehas-The Same as Elijah," Feldraan, "The Portrayal of Phineas"; Alex ander Zeron, "The Martyrdom of Elijah-Phineas," Journal of Biblical Literature 98 (1979): 99-100; John C. Poirier, "The End Time Return of Elijah and Moses at Qumran," Dead Sea Discoveries 10 (2003): 221-42. Note the careful phrasing of Poirier: "The account of Phineas in Pseudo-Philo (Bib. Ant. 48:1-2) is filled with allusions to Elijah's ministry, making this our oldest source containing the Phineas-Elijah complex" (233). 23. See YalkutShim 'oni, Phineas 771 (ed.

This view was spread further by its place in the liturgy, as it prevailed in piyyutim for Havdalah; it also appears in Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, which was probably a conduit for wider distribution of midrashic traditions.28 This literary mapping is an important clue for the historical setting of the events recounted in our Genizah fragment. It explains the surprise provoked by the identification of Elijah with the tribe of Benjamin in the Judeo-Arabic-speaking community. Despite the presence of this view in known texts it was not common knowledge nor part of the collective memory in the East. The cantor who provoked the first debate was a stranger ("came to our city") and he performed an imported piyyut. The piyyut presented a view that was not current in the cultural milieu of the audience: Elijah is not Phineas. We can trace the journey of this view: we can identify its Palestinian origins in Bere shit Rabbah; its continuous vitality is demonstrated in quotations in the late genre of midrashic anthologies/commentaries. This implies that it was known in Byzan tium and Italy. These works are an important link in the chain of tradition from the Palestinian rabbinic milieu, through the Byzantine and Italian bridges to Ashke naz, France, and Provence. Therefore it is likely that they played a role in estab lishing familiarity with the view that Elijah is not Phineas in these Jewish communities under the Christian domain.29 The next stage in the diffusion of this opinion was its move from the limited academic context of written commentaries to the public sphere of weekly perform ance of the piyyut. The evidence shows that this happened in Christian Europe. Other than the citation in our Genizah fragment, there is no documentation of the piyyut יה חזקי (God, my strength), which includes the identification of Elijah with the tribe of Benjamin in the Genizah source. Neither have I found any reference to it in other Eastern manuscripts and texts. The piyyut's style and content represent strong grounds for arguing that the piyyut is of Provencal or French origin. Furthermore, the piyyut is found in the later additions to Mahzor 27. See Lekah Toy (ed. Buber) 76a; Sekhel Tov, Genesis 30:11 (ed. Buber, 138). Both sources present a survey of all the views regarding the identity of Elijah. The descent of Elijah from Gad is quoted in Midrash Aggadah, Genesis 30:11 (ed. Buber, 78); Aggadat Bereshit 83:1 (ed. Buber 1903, 162). The descent of Elijah from Benjamin: Midrash Aggadah, Deuteronomy 12:13, (ed. Buber, 190). 28. See Targum Yonatan, Exodus 6:18, Numbers 25:12. This is a late targumic tradition, prob ably inspired by Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer. See Robert Hayward, "Phinehas." As for the piyyutim, six out of the eight different variations of the sub-genre of alphabetical piyyut for Havdalah starting with איש found in the Genizah identify Elijah with Phineas, including the two most popular variations. 29.

Another clue to the literary and geo-cultural background of the events is found in the works of the French Tosafists. The strophe quoted in our Genizah fragment was also quoted by Rabbi Samson of Sens, in the name of R. Jacob (Rabbenu Tam). As in our Genizah fragment, Rabbenu Tam identifies Elijah with the tribe of Benjamin on the basis of the text in Bereshit Rabbah.31 Not only did the cantor present an imported piyyut, of French or Provencal origins, he also defended the content of the piyyut with an argument that was previously known in French contexts. As already stated, after the presentation of events, the Genizah fragment includes a long discussion about the identity of Elijah. An explicit Provencal context of the identification of Elijah with Phineas is also evident in the fragment: the text quotes a certain "R. Isaac of Narbonne of blessed memory" who also refuted the identification of Elijah with Phineas.32 His view is preferred over that of one "Shmariah Fla-Kohen of blessed memory", who was probably a local rabbi.33 The fragment also presents an argument against the identification 30. It is documented in only two manuscripts. See Mahzor Vitry 209 (ed. S. Horowitz), 186; MahzorMahzor Vitry 209 (ed. A Goldschmidt, vol. 2), 312. MS London 655, the basis for this edition, has many additions, including the two piyyutim referred to in our Genizah fragment. The dating of the addition of piyyutim was not sufficiently discussed.

We should mention a few pos sibilities: (1) Isaac b. Maru'an Ha-Levi of Narbonne (2) Isaac b. Shmu'el of Narbonne, who is mentioned in the commentary on Chronicles wrongly attributed to Rashi.

Moses who is, according to the acrostic, the poet of the piyyut discussed in the Genizah frag ment (4) Isaac b. Abraham Carcassonne, a student of Nahmanides, whose talmudic commentaries are also documented in the Genizah. This would postdate the events to the late thirteenth century or even later.

According to our fragment he is the author of a commentary to the Book of Ruth. His signature is found on docu mentsments up to 1124(T-S 16.133,T-SNS 184.68). He died before 1137, as his son signed a document and he is mentioned with the blessing of the dead (T-S 10J 28.7, T-S 13J 2.19). One Genizah fragment attributed to Shmariah Ha-Kohen is a section from Kitab al-tufaha (Yevr.-Arab. I 3032). The homily for Phineas in this work contains the same view attributed to Shmariah in our fragment and there is a partial similarity between the aggadic texts quoted in both texts (see MS Oxford 115, 198-202). 296</page><page sequence="13">Literary Canonization at Work of Elijah and Phineas that was common in Ashkenazic and French circles.34 If this is indeed the literary and historical context of the events presented in our Genizah fragment,35 it sheds light on the growing importance attributed to aggadic midrash. It was not only specific traditions that were imported from the Jewish communities of the Christian West to a synagogue in the Arabic-speaking East. The fragment also reflects the importation of cultural values, namely the greater importance that was granted to aggadic tradition by Western scholars. The Adaptation of Piyyutim The series of debates about the identity of Elijah provides us with a context in which to understand the development of several Havdalah piyyutim known to us from the Genizah. The first piyyut quoted in our fragment belongs to a wider group of Havdalah piyyutim. A survey shows the instability of these texts, and especially their relation to the question of the identity of Elijah. The same issue that was at the core of the debates in our fragment was also subject to changes and variations. Sur prisingly, there is another Havdalah piyyut that refers to the same biblical event in exactly the same place in the alphabetical acrostic. It too suffered from textual instability at a specific point in the poem. The textual development of this piyyut,piyyut, אותותינו התמהמהו (The signs of our [redemption] are delayed) by Rabbi Yehudah Ha-Levi, is presented below.36 A—The genre of Havdalah piyyutim which begin with איש (a man) The other piyyut mentioned in our story, איש אזור אזור עור (a man, girt with a girdle of leather), is well attested both in the European and the Eastern milieus. The piyyut piyyut exists in numerous versions. Before presenting the conclusions of the survey of these piyyutim, we should consider the liturgical context in which they were com monly found. Havdalah piyyutim such as these were one component in a wider liturgical category of compositions for the Havdalah service in the synagogue,37 34. The claim is that a baraita in B. Baba Batra 121b assumes that Phineas is not Elijah. It is mentioned by R. Shmu'el b. Me'ir, the Tosafot, and in Shma'aiah's commentary for piyyut quoted by Avraham Grossman, Hakhmei Zarfat ha-rishonim, 355-356. 35. In a paper due to be published in Pe'amim, I intend to suggest that our fragment should be considered as a small but significant item of evidence for the influence of French rabbis who emigrated to the land of Israel and Egypt during the early thirteenth century. See Yosef Braslavi, "Kit'ei genizah 'al hakhamim mi-Zarfat ve-'ashkenaz be-'Erez Yisra'el u-ve-mizrayim," 'Erez-Yisra 'el 4 (1956): 156 60; Elhanan Reiner, '"Aliyah ve-'aliyah la-regel le-'Erez Yisra'el 1099-1517," (PhD Diss., The Hebrew University, 1988), 50-69; Ephraim Kanarfogel, "The Aliyah of 'Three Hundred Rabbis' in 1211: 1211: Tosafist Attitudes Toward Settling in the Land of Israel," JQR 76 (1985): 191-215; Alexandra Cuffel, "Call and Response: European Jewish Emigration to Egypt and Palestine in the Middle Ages Ages ,,'JQR 90 (1999): 61-101; Israel Ta-Shma, Keneset Mehkarim, vol. 4 (Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 2010), ch. 5, esp. 45^49. 36.

The study of Havdalah focused on the blessing itself or the Havdalah during the Amidah and not on the Havdalah system as a holistic unit. 297</page><page sequence="14">MosheMoshe Lavee a genre that has not been sufficiently studied.38 We do not have any early documen tation of these compositions. Fleischer already noted that there is no reference to Havdalah in the early Palestinian siddur found in the Genizah, which he published.39 It is probable that the Havdalah compositions developed only around the turn of the millennium, as a replacement for earlier models of public poetical marking of the Havdalah in the synagogue, including poetic Shema blessings known from Sa'adiah's siddur, rare Genizah fragments, and shiv'atot havdalah for the Amidah, performed when moza 'ei shabbat falls on the eve of festivals.40 The wider liturgical unit of Havdalah developed into a complex structure. In addition to the main benedictions defined in classical rabbinic works, Havdalah liturgy includes verses of comfort and salvation, blessings and petitions, magical formulas, and piyyutim, most of which relate to Elijah.41 These Havdalah liturgies vary significantly both in terms of structure and content. This testifies to a long period in which these liturgies were not fixed. It is in this grouping that we find the piyyut discussed in our Genizah fragment, and as we shall see, it shares the textual instability common to Havdalah piyyutim in general. Our piyyut, איש אזור איזור עור (a man girt with a girdle of leather), also belongs to a sub-genre of Havdalah piyyutim that share a common form and present aspects of the figure of Elijah. Each stich begins with the word איש (a man) followed by a word that contributes to an alphabetical acrostic: איש אזור אזור עור / איש בעל שיער נקרא / איש גש ויכפר. .. (A man, girt with a girdle of leather / A man called "hairy" / A man who came near and brought atonement ...) 38.

Mosseri v. 138.1 might also belong to this type. 41.1 will mention a few fragments including Havdalah liturgies: T-S 8H.15 (in a siddur(?)), T-S NS 229.15-16, T-S NS 159.69, T-S NS 235.192.

These piyyutim are anonymous, given the alphabetical acrostic. Indeed, it is doubtful whether the very concept of "author" is relevant here, as the distinction between an adaptation and an indepen dent work is hardly possible in this case.43 Each line in the piyyut refers to an event or phrase related to the figure of Elijah. The reference is usually to the biblical account of Elijah, though it occasionally draws on rabbinic literature as well. Among these we find allusions to the figure of Phineas as well as references to Malakhi 3. Though the order and exact phrasings of these allusions vary, in most cases the piyyutim seem to be based on a pre-existent pool of allusions and phrases. For example, piyyutim 1 and 3 in the appendix share at least eleven motifs. In some cases the shared motifs are merely allusions to the same biblical reference but in many cases they are phrased in an approximate manner, implying direct borrowing from one variation to another, or the use of a common source, or at least an echo of the same tradition. Some of those piyyutim were extremely popular and as such they are preserved in many manuscripts and fragments. The variants of these piyyutim illustrate some trends and preferences in the portrayal of the figure of Elijah. In a few cases they reflect an effort to avoid the presentation of the harsh and zealous aspects of Elijah: Piyyut Line Harsh variant Softened variant (1) Het a man who hastened and a man who hastened and vowed to prevent the hea vowed in the name of venly rain. God. (1) Tet A man who held the dew and A man who brought dew the rain for three years. and rain after a break of three years.

The form is also used inpiyyutim about Mordekhai who is also called איש (Esther 3:1). See for example איש יהודי אתוי מיהודה, T-S NS 235.136 f.5. 43. The adaptation, quotation, imitation, echo, and so forth in the field of piyyut is a vast field that demands a thorough treatment. See Shulamit Elizur, '"Ibudey piyyutim ba-genizah ha-Kahirit," Pe'amim 78 (1999), 100-127. 299</page><page sequence="16">MosheMoshe Lavee It is very plausible that different perceptions of Elijah were at work here. The identification of Elijah with Phineas, and especially the portrayal of Elijah-Phineas as killing the adulterous couple, amplify the representation of Elijah as a zealot. The effort to minimize the zealous aspects of Elijah's personality may have been a factor in the shaping of the two unique piyyutim that avoid the portrayal of Phineas's killing of Cozbi and Zimri (piyyutim 3 and 6 in the appendix). One piyyutpiyyut uses an ambiguous expression that either implies the killing of the prophets or that of the couple, or intentionally implies both (5 in the appendix). Of special importance in that context are two rare versions of this text. T-S NS 107.28 (4 in the appendix) is a unique variation of the piyyut איש אזור (a man girt) that provoked the debate in our fragment. Not only does this version avoid the portrayal of the killing of the adulterous couple, it also lacks any reference to Phineas, except for the last line, where it mentions the covenant of peace, pointing out an opposite aspect of both figures. ENA 586.7 is another unique piyyut of this genre, and it avoids any reference to the figure of Phineas. It is possible that this unique version was inspired by the very same issue that provoked the debate documented in our Genizah fragment: the wish to avoid the identification of Elijah with Phineas, and especially the portrayal of the killing. We have seen that Havdalah piyyutim of the איש (a man) genre, such as the ones we have just examined, were very popular. Many piyyutim were written in this form, differing from each other, yet drawing upon a shared reservoir of motifs. Different motivations may have contributed to this development. It may have been necessary to present new materials to the audience, a motivation that was viewed by Fleischer as one of the main influences in the development of Hebrew liturgical poetry.44 In other cases we may assume that stylistic constraints were at work: the need to simplify a piyyut that was used in such a common litur gical event as the Havdalah ceremony, the move from blank verse to rhyme, or from strophes of three lines to a fixed rhyme covering all lines of the poem, and so on. We should also take into account that conceptual motivations were at work here. Some liturgical changes might be related to the community's reluctance to portray Elijah as a zealot. It is possible that the same motivation influenced the identification of Elijah with Phineas, and especially the explicit portrayal of the act of killing the adulterous couple. This might be the reason for the choice of another event for the letter tet, especially in the case of the version documented in T-S NS 107.28, that hints at Phineas only by referring to the covenant of peace. More important is the case of ENA 586.7, איש אשר היה מלאך מעיקרא (a man who was an angel from the very beginning), which leaves no traces of the figure of Phineas. If indeed this assessment is correct, and the identification of Elijah with Phineas did play a role in shaping the different versions of the piyyut, then the present survey provides another angle on the debates documented in the 44.44. Ezra Fleischer, Shirat ha-kodesh ha- 'ivrit bi-yemey ha-beynayim (Jerusalem: Keter, 1975), 49-51. 300</page><page sequence="17">Literary Canonization at Work Genizah fragment. This is not to suggest an simplistic cause-effect relation, namely that the events documented in the fragment shaped the perceptions regard ing Elijah, and that the poems were changed accordingly. The debate about the identity of Elijah was much wider than the events presented here, as we saw in the survey above. As indicated above, the debate dates back to early rabbinic works and contemporaneous non-rabbinic works. The polemical nature of this dis cussion is prominent in later midrashic collections in which rabbis5 targets were probably Karaites or Samaritans.45 It is further developed in medieval biblical commentaries46 and the borderline genre of midrashic anthologies and biblical commentaries. What we have here are probably two different attestations of the debate: one is a documentation of vivid events in a synagogue; the other is the influence of the debate on the versions of piyyutim. For the student of the reception of literary genres, the significance of the connection between these two distinct sets of evidence goes well beyond the spe cifics of the debate about Elijah. The narrative of the events presented in the Genizah fragments teaches us that midrashic works were considered to be primary biblical sources, while piyyutim had no authoritative value. A similar per ception of the status of piyyutim is implied by their textual instability. The degree of a text's stability is also a measure of its canonical role: authoritative texts enjoy a higher degree of stability. The instability of Havdalah piyyutim demonstrates no sense of authorship, or of importance ascribed to a specific text. The text of the piyyutpiyyut was open to improvisation and manipulation, possibly on the basis of differ ent views in the midrash. B—The textual evolution of אותותינו התמהמהו (The signs of our [redemption] are delayed) by Rabbi Yehudah Ha-Levi The findings of this survey of איש אזור (a man girded) piyyutim are not suffi cient in and of themselves to demonstrate that the specific instability around the letter tet is related to the question of Elijah's identity. Since all components of the poem were subject to improvisation we cannot dismiss the possibility that the motivation for the variations in the letter tet was not the specific question of the identity of Elijah, but rather stylistic considerations or the wish to avoid depicting him as zealous. However, the textual evolution of another Havdalah piyyut,piyyut, אותותינו התמהמהו (The signs of our [redemption] are delayed) by Rabbi Yehudah Ha-Levi, supplies us with a better case for claiming that the identity of Elijah, and especially the portrayal of Phineas's zealous killing, was a source of unease and anxiety, which played a role in the development of new versions. Recently Binyamin Bar-Tikva has pointed out that this alphabetical piyyut is commonly preserved in a shortened version, up to the letters zayin-het (see also 45. Abram Spiro, "The Ascension of Phinehas," Publications of the American Academy for Jewish Jewish Research 22 (1953): 103 n. 27. 46. Ibn Ezra, Numbers 25:12; R. Levi B. Gershom, Judges 5:35, 6:21; R. David Kimhi, Judges 20:28, 1 Kings 17:1, 19:4, Malakhi 2:4, 1 Chronicles 9:23. 301</page><page sequence="18">MosheMoshe Lavee Davidson Aleph 20 77).47 He has also described three full versions that contain the rest of the alphabet: (1) a version found in a Genizah fragment, in which the first eight letters of the acrostic were in one hand, and the letters following tet were com pleted with another hand; (2) a version documented in Yemenite manuscripts; (3) a late completion of the abridged version by Rabbi Shmu'el Ha-Rofe. Bar-Tikva discusses the authenticity of the three full versions and points out the quality of the Yemenite version in terms of its style and language. However, the late date of the Yemenite manuscripts leads him to prefer the Genizah fragment as the authentic text. Of particular significance for our purposes is the fact that the shortened version stops just short of the letter tet, the same letter that provoked the debate in our Genizah fragment. The reason for this may be connected to the contents of the tet strophe in the unabridged versions of the story. They appear as follows: Yemenite manuscripts טבל רומח עת כי צפה / יד עם קדש למאוד רפה / ותעצר המגפה / הכל פעל למענהו He has immersed the spear as he had seen / how weak was the hand of the Holy People / and the plague was stayed / everything he did was for His sake. TS N-S 242.16, from line 8 in another hand טרם קרא לאלוהיהו / יעץ עצה על שונאהו / קראו גדול כי ישן הוא / ויהתל בהם אליהו Even before he called to his God / he gave counsel against His enemies: / Call loudly as he is asleep / and Elijah has mocked them. Shmu'el Ha-Rofe טופלי שקר וכחשים / ארבע מאות וחמישים / קיבץ מלך מכל ראשים / ויגש אליהו The inventors of lies and untruth / four hundred and fifty / the king gathered from among the people / and Elijah came near. Here, again, the Yemenite version uses the letter tet to allude to the zealous act of Phineas, while this reference is missing in the two other versions. The Genizah version, as well as that of Shmu'el Ha-Rofe, does not include any allusion to Phineas and therefore avoids the identification of the two figures. It is possible that in the abridged versions the same mechanism was at work: the original version was that of the Yemenite manuscripts, which portrayed the zealous act of killing the adulterous couple. The poem was shortened before the letter tet, because of 47. Binyamin Bar-Tikva, "'Eliyahu ha-navi be-piyutey havdalah," in Le- 'ot zikaron: mehkarim ba-shirahba-shirah ha- 'ivrit u-ve-moreshet Yisra 'el, ed. Ephraim Hazan and Joseph Yahalom (Ramat-Gan: Bar Ilan University Press, 2006), 239-80. 302</page><page sequence="19">Literary Canonization at Work reluctance to present the identification of Elijah with Phineas, and especially to portray Elijah as performing the killing. The argument for the antiquity of the Yemenite version is based on some textual observations that should be added to Bar-Tikva's helpful survey: The version of the Yemenite manuscript is also found in Mahzor' Aram Zova, as recently noted by Shulamit Elizur,48 as well as in one Genizah fragment, Mosseri V 138.1. Now, since this version has much earlier documentation than the seventeenth-century Yemenite manuscripts, the main argument raised against its authenticity is undermined. It is much more reasonable to assume that this version is indeed the original version of Ha-Levi, as reflected in its style.49 Now we can suggest that Ha-Levi wrote his poetry on the basis of the common and prevailing view in his time and place that identified Elijah with Phineas, using a motif already documented in earlier Havdalah poetry, such as the work of his predecessor Ibn Gabirol.50 The text was then shortened so that it ended right before the letter tet. The abbreviated version did not include this por trayal of Elijah as Phineas. Later poets completed the shortened version producing new versions that avoided the identification of Elijah with Phineas. If indeed the debate about the identity of Elijah was a factor here, it might testify to an earlier influence of the debate on Havdalah poetry, as the shortened version was docu mented in the early Diwan of Rabbi Yehudah Ha-Levi, redacted by Hiyya in the eleventh century (assuming that the text of the Diwan is an authentic reflection of the first redaction. One should also consider that the poem was shortened by a later scribe who copied the Diwan).51 The contribution of these findings concerning Ha-Levi's poem is twofold. First, they offer a model for understanding similar evolutions of Havdalah poetry. The text of the piyyut was changed exactly at letter tet, the point at which Elijah was identified with Phineas and was portrayed as slaying the adulter ous couple. As such, it strengthens the suggestion that the issue of the identifi cation of Elijah and his zeal was at work in both cases. Second, it further demonstrates the instability of the texts of piyyut and their susceptibility to modi fication. Here we find a process of revision in a text of a highly celebrated poet. His text was not considered authoritative by those who were involved in the trans mission of his poem, and was thus subject to modification. 48. See Shulamit Elizur, "Ha-piyyutim be-mahzor 'Aram Zova," in Mevo 'ot le-mahzor 'Aram ZovaZova (Jerusalem: Yad Ha-Rav Nissim, 2008), 46 n. 38. 49. There is also another witness for the Genizah version: Another Geniza fragment, T-S NS 131.29 presents the poem on one page, up to the letter yod. The letter het is missing and after it we find טרם ק, with a sign of deletion above the letters, and then יעץ עיצה, and this is, unfortunately, the end of the fragment. The combination of the lack of the letter het, and the mark of deletion on the few letters of the strophe tet imply a lack of stability of the text in this place. 50.

The Genizah fragment in ENA 637.4-5 contains unequivocal evidence for this concern, documenting an actual debate in a synago gue in response to a pivyut. The two sets of Havdalah piyyuutim provide further implicit evidence for this phenomenon: both sets show changes in the tet line of the poem, which suggests a tendency to exclude references to Elijah/Phineas's bloody deed. These findings were analyzed in the wider context of the study of the recep tion of literary works and canonization. In addition to the explicit issue at hand— who was Elijah?—the narrative documented in the Genizah fragment also uncovers implicit cultural messages regarding the relative status of midrash and piyyutpiyyut in the communities of the Genizah. Midrash was perceived as the authori tative source of knowledge, as the basis for the "true" reconstruction of the biblical past. Piyyut, on the other hand, was seen as a non-authoritative text. The cantor had to justify himself and defend the text he performed with good evidence, and provide citations for the midrashim. The authority of a text is strongly related to its stability. Sanctified texts are carefully preserved, while less authoritative texts are unstable and open to changes and variations. Accordingly, the Havdalah piyyutim were not perceived at that stage as fixed texts, and we can see a wide range of variation within a single family of piyyutim, as well as minute variations between different versions of the same text.52 Even the authority of as revered a poet as Rabbi Yehudah Ha-Levi did not shield his poem from being tampered with by later copyists. In this case we were able to point to a conceptual concern that influenced the motif of Elijah-Phineas as the slayer of the adulterers in the Havdalah poetry. The conceptual debate may have been the background for the specific changes in the piyyutim, and the authority of aggadic midrash supplied the arguments for the debate. The debate in the synagogue was not only a mere reflection of an already fixed and well-established perception of the literary genres involved. It also had a role in the ongoing process of establishing the relative cultural value attributed to piyyut and midrash. It enabled the distribution of these cultural values as held by the key players in the events. The events recalled in the Genizah fragment took place in the public domain. The members of the community who witnessed the debate between the rabbi and cantor received implied messages. They learned that one cannot accept the content of the piyyut as a teaching, and that the content of the piyyut must be supported by an authoritative midrash; they heard a quotation of Bereshit Rabbah, and even if unlearned and illiterate, they were exposed to the very existence of the work and to its status among the leaders of 52.52. Such variations are also found in the text of midrashic works. The correlation of the wider instability of late midrashic texts and their status can be discussed in the same terms. 304</page><page sequence="21">Literary Canonization at Work the community. Maybe they even noticed that the biblical text per se was not con sidered sufficient evidence for the lives of the biblical heroes. Such public events contributed to future perceptions of midrash and piyyut, and added to the atmosphere that made the text of the piyyut unstable and open to changes and variations on the basis of views and information documented in aggadic midrash.

Similar affinities are also found between other variations of this text. While some common motifs simply reflect the effort to mention similar biblical refer ences (i.e. the reference to Elijah in 1 Kings 18), the phrasing of others is almost identical, implying direct borrowing of motifs, the use of a common source, or at least an echo of the same tradition. The identification of Elijah with Phineas is found in the opening lines of the piyyut,piyyut, beginning first with the motif of zeal, common to both figures, and moving on to a reference to Phineas in the second line based on Numbers 25:2: "A man who received the message of peace from Yekutiel (Moses)."57 However, this piyyut makes no reference to Phineas's slaughter of the adulterers. Instead we 57. According to the midrash, Yekutiel is one of the names of Moses. See Va-yikra Rabbah, Va-yikra 1:3 to Leviticus 1:1 (ed.

Some Genizah fragments testify to a different version, probably in an effort to further minimize Elijah's biblical harshness: איש טל ומטר הביא/היריד(!) אחר עוצר שלוש שנים (A man who brought dew and rain after a break of three years).58 A few versions demonstrate instability of the text in the letter zadi or kuf.59 Textual instability is also noticed around the letter het, once again in relation to the por trayal of Elijah as zealous. Here we find איש חש ונשבע מהיות גשמי מעונים (a man who hastened and vowed to prevent the heavenly rain).60 Other versions omit the reference to the zealous act: ...איש חש ונשבע באלוהי האלוהים (a man who has tened and vowed in the name of God....)61 A rare and difficult version, and hence probably an original one is איש חר מהיות גשמי מעונים (a man who angered, preventing the rains of heaven). (The verb חר [angered] probably derives from 62.(חרי אף Another related variation is in the letter mem: איש מוסריו הקשיבו כמהים (a man whose rebukes were heard by the yearning people),63 versus the more frequent version איש מופתיו ראו (עם) כמהים (a man whose miracles were seen by a yearning people).64 This would suggest another motive for removing references to Elijah as Phineas, a desire to present Elijah as a figure of comfort and hope.

The late nature of this version is seen from the inclusion of the petitions in the alphabetical poem (איש תזכינו על ידו בתורה—a man by whom You shall merit us with the [study of the] Torah etc.). In earlier Havdalah liturgies the petitions and the piyyut were two distinct units, even if in some cases they were attached to each other. The alphabetical piyyut was only used for describing Elijah. Here we find a petition included in the alphabetical piyyut, which probably hints at a later development. The line for tet begins איש טרף חוב (a man who collected the debt...). Elijah is identified as a priest—איש כהן ונביא קיים (a man who was both a priest and a prophet), and his relation to Phineas is hinted at: ויכפר על בני ישראל (and brought atonement on the people of Israel), referring to Numbers 25:13. In any case, this version does not explicitly portray Elijah as Phineas slaughtering the couple. Another version of the piyyut begins with the variant איש אשר קנא לאלוהיו ויכפר (a man who was zealous for his God and brought atonement). The line for tet tet has a unique variant, which refers to the motif of rain and not to the act of slaughtering: איש טל קשר65 התיר והשיב ביילד רוח אל (a man who untied the knot [pre venting] the dew, and brought the spirit of God back to the child). The identifi cation of Elijah with Phineas is assumed in the opening line quoted above, as well as in other lines: ברית שלום לכן ניתנה לו... גורלו בכהונה עולמית, (hence the cove nant of peace was granted to him... eternal high priesthood is his fate), referring to Numbers 25:12. (3) איש אזור איזור עור (A Man Girt with a Girdle of Leather)—Common Version The piyyut mentioned in the events recorded in our Genizah fragment is also well attested in the Genizah collections.66 In addition, this piyyut was known in Europe, as it is documented in the late additions of Mahzor Vitry. As presented above, the identification with Phineas is found in the letter tet. The version in Mahzor Mahzor Vitry and in one Genizah fragment also includes a reference to priesthood in the letter tav.61 From the letter kuf onward the text is less stable, and some 65. T-S NS 274.4f. The image of untying a knot as a symbol for rain might be rooted in the act of untying a knot for releasing liquids from skins: see for example Va-yikra Rabbah 12:1 (ed. Margulies, 140-141): חמא זיקא... שרא יתיה... שרי שחיה (he saw a skin... he untied it... he began to drink.) The reading is doubtful. קטר is also a possible reading, giving the same meaning on the basis of a loan from the Aramaic. The line implies the rabbinic (and biblical) motif of dew as giving life. 66.

An odd version is found in T-S AS 116.387. This is a small and torn fragment, in a nice square hand, partially preserving only bits from the first nine lines of the pivyut: [א]זור עור במתניו איש בעל שער [אי]ש הנקרא מתושבי גלעד איש וי האלמנה איש טעם טעם רומ[ח] This is probably a scribal error influenced by the line שלא טעם טעם מיתה. At any case this can be counted as another piece of evidence for the instability of the letter tet. 309</page><page sequence="26">MosheMoshe Lavee versions have more than one line for each letter.68 This might reflect different ver sions that bring together texts from various piyyutim in the same form. As such it further demonstrates the fluidity of the piyyut and the extent to which it was not considered a fixed text. There is one variation that deserves attention, as it sheds light on one minor detail in the events presented in our Genizah fragment. The Genizah version of the piyyut piyyut does not include the line איש תתה לו ברית כהונה (a man, to whom You granted the covenant of priesthood).69 This line is found in the European version preserved in Mahzor Vitry.7" In the story recorded in our fragment it is declared that the piyyut piyyut is entirely true, except for the line of the letter tet, in which Elijah is ident ified as Phineas. This implies that the version of the piyyut read in the synagogue did not include another reference to the identification of Elijah with Phineas. The reference to priesthood in the Vitry version also hints at identification with Phineas. Hence, it is probable that the version of the piyyut described in the Genizah fragment as having been recited in the synagogue on the night of the debate is indeed the one that is found in the Genizah, and is not the one known to us from Vitry. (4) איש א[ז]ור [עו]ר אזור (A Man Girt with a Girdle of Leather)—The Rare Version In one Genizah fragment we find a piyyut with a similar opening, beginning איש א[ז]ור [עו]ר אזור, but departing from the common version from the letter dalet to the letter nun (in addition to some other minor differences). The letter tet reads איש טל ומטר היה בדברו (a man for whom rain and dew came as he spoke). This is clearly a variation on the text איש טל ומטר עצר (a man who stopped the dew and rain), yet one that emphasizes the returning of the rain, rather than the act that led to its ces sation. A similar change was already noticed in the variation of איש אשר קנא (a man who was zealous). The positive reference to rain and dew in this yet unpublished version is of particular importance, as it might imply an intentional effort to avoid identifying Elijah as Phineas, or establishing the status of both as zealous people: T-S NS 107.28 Side a, last three lines איש א[ז]ור [עו]ר אזור אליהו הל הל איש בעל שי[ע]ר נקרא אליהו הל איש גש [כ]עלות ה[מנהה] אליהו הל A man girt with a girdle of leather.

(5) איש אוזוי מגזע אהרון הלוי—(A Man Who Came from the Branch of Aaron the Levite) This piyyut is documented in three Genizah fragments.71 The piyyut is distinc tive in terms of its style and content. The entire text is rhymed with the syllable בי (vi), and it has fewer common motifs and similar phrasings than other variations.

Later on the text reads איש שחט רודפי/דורסי תעתוע כזבי. The translation of this line and its relation to Elijah or Phineas depends on the meaning of the word כזבי. One option is that the word is an adjective of תעתוע, and the line should be translated: "a man who has slaughtered the chasers of the false illusion," referring to the slaughtering of the prophets of the Ba'al, who are the followers of a spurious god. In this reading the line alludes to the word שחט (slaughtered) in 1 Kings 18:40. Alternatively the line may be understood as referring to the biblical personage named כזבי (Cozby), who was killed by Phineas for her sins. According to this reading the line should be translated: "A man who slaughtered the chasers of the illusion of Cozby," alluding to Numbers 25:18. In the letter kuf we find a variation in the Cambridge fragment, reading איש קרא כי בקשו קחת נפש שבי (a man who proclaimed "that they have asked to take my soul"), instead of איש קנוא קנאתי נם ויבקשו קחת נפש שבי (a man who proclaimed "I have been very zealous and they have asked to take my soul"). This is another case of an omission of the motif of zeal. However, the text does present acts of zeal in the letter shin, as presented above. (6) איש אימץ בני בכפלים (A Man Who Twice Gave Strength to My Sons) This rare and difficult variant of the piyyut was preserved only in the frag ment Strassbourg 4078.146.5 and only up to the letter samekh. The text is original, as it hardly has any verbal affinities to or echoes of other piyvutim of this kind. This is seen, for example, in the unique allusion to the identification of Elijah with Phineas and the presentation of his act. It is found in the letter samekh, the last letter preserved in our text (it is located at the end of the page, and the next page is missing.): איש סלה מנאפים ברומח פיותיים (a man who executed the adulterous couple with a double-edged spear).72 (7) ...איש אלהי—(A Man of God...) One fragment in the Mosseri collection might record parts of another piyyut rhymed with the syllable בי (vi). The text is very badly preserved, but based on the scattered words that remain it is clear that the text belongs to our sub-genre: ונקרא ,בבוא כוכבי ,איש אלהי[ם. The words וכפר חובי might imply the zealous act of Phineas, hinting at Numbers 25:13, as already explained. (8) איש אשר היה מלאך מעיקרא—(A Man Who was an Angel from the Very Beginning) This is another piyyut preserved only in one fragment—ENA 586.7. We should notice the rhymes מעיקרא, דרא ודרא, that might imply a pseudo-Aramaic style inspired by the later systemized spelling in late manuscripts and printed edi tions of the Babylonian Talmud. This may also hint at a framework inspired by the 72. The use of סלה to portray the act of execution might be a borrowed use of the word in the sense of paving the road as in Isaiah 57:14. See also Sa'adiah's poem אשנבי חרך שקפת presented in the Ma'agarim website on the basis of Genizah Fragment Oxford heb. c.20 f. 7-8. It might also derive from מסוללות (B.
