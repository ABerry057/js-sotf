<plain_text><page sequence="1">JEWISH RELIGIOUS THOUGHT IN EARLY VICTORIAN LONDON by STEVEN SINGER Religious thought and observance almost never exist in a self-contained vacuum but are rather influenced, to a greater or lesser extent, by their social and ideological surroundings. A study of the spiritual life of early Vic- torian Jewry provides a good example of this law of history and shows how a Jewish community's religious beliefs and actions can be shaped and even dominated by the influence of its Gentile host society. An analysis of early Victorian Judaism is really an investigation into the social dynamics of the London community and a study of how the endeavors of its various factions to adapt to the mid-nineteenth-century English world affected its religious life. The nineteenth century was one of great turmoil for the Jews of Western Europe. Old institutions and ways of living were abandoned while new ones took their place. The Jewish communities in this part of the world were thrust into a radical process of transformation, and they emerged very dif- ferent from what they had been like only a short time before. The old legal and social barriers which had effectively isolated most Jews from the non- Jewish world began to crumble, and the Jew emerged, recognized as a free and equal human being, with the full right of participating in secular Euro- pean society. The basic problem which arose as a result of this process was the need for the Jew to find a way through which he could define his religious and ethnic identity, so that he could be accepted in the modern secular world and yet retain his specific Jewish orientation. The old concept of the Jews, as a people in exile among the Gentiles with little interest in the world outside 181</page><page sequence="2">182 STEVEN SINGER of their own community, was no longer satisfactory for individuals who wanted very much to enter the secular world and play a role in it. The various attempts made during the nineteenth century to reform Jewish wor- ship and theology and to develop scientific Judaic studies were all really endeavors to solve the question of how one could leave medieval Judaism behind and still remain a Jew in the modern world. In discussing this basic theme of nineteenth-century Jewish history, it is necessary to remember that the transformation of Western European Jewry was not a uniform process which was the same for all communities and for all economic and social classes. There were great differences in the speed and direction of the trend toward acculturation and modernization among the different segments of Western European Jewry. For example, rich Jews from urban areas, who had high social and economic ambitions, reacted to the demands of the new age quite differently than did the rural poor or the lower classes in the cities. It is very misleading to take the adaptation process experienced at this time by the wealthy Jews of such German cities as Berlin and Hamburg, typified by the Haskalah and the beginnings of Reform Judaism, as a model for the modernization of the entire Western Jewish world. The latter process was actually far more complex and intricate.' While it is inaccurate to take the acculturation undergone by one ele- ment of a specific Jewish community and automatically apply it to all segments of that group, it is perhaps even more incorrect to extend, without full investigation, all the details of the modernization process experienced by the Jews of one country to those of another. It should be obvious that the different national Jewish communities were affected by quite varied demands and pressures and often did not react in the same way to the dic- tates of the nineteenth century. Despite this truism, historians who have dealt with the religious life of early Victorian Anglo-Jewry have exhibited a definite tendency of trying to force that community's pattern of thought and practice into the mold of what was happening at the same time on the Con- tinent, without attempting to see if such a communal portrait was in accord with the facts. In a vain search for historical consistency, they have, by and large, tried to define the spiritual life of the London community in terms that 1. A discussion of the many variations involved in this modernization process can be found in Todd M.

In Germany at this time, and to some extent elsewhere on the Continent as well, Reform Judaism was increasingly being embraced by the Jewish upper and middle classes. These well-off groups were influenced by various factors in their decision to reject Orthodoxy. These reasons included an often unexpressed desire to make Judaism conform to the model of the dominant Christian faith and a feeling that the traditional Jewish lifestyle was incongruous with the nineteenth-century Western world. One of the major determinants for this behavior pattern was the fact that the wealthier German Jews were absorbed in a fervent struggle for emancipation and full acceptance throughout these years. To convince their governments and Gentile neighbors that they were worthy of these privileges, these indi- viduals felt it necessary to advocate the abandonment of the ritual and nationalistic parts of Judaism which set them apart from their fellow citizens. Orthodoxy remained, to a large extent, the faith of the poorer, often rural elements within the Jewish community.2 Scholars writing on the religious life of early Victorian London, in which a Reform congregation was begun by a small wealthy group in 1840, have described that community's characteristics in similar terms. Lucien Wolf claims that the struggle for full enfranchisement made it necessary for wealthy London Jews to abandon Orthodoxy and remove the nationalistic and irrational elements of Judaism from their faith. He argues that there was 2. Reform Judaism on the Continent was not confined exclusively to the upper classes. It contained sizable elements of the middle classes as well. Michael A. Meyer, "Hakamoto shel ha-Hekal be-Hamburg," in Perakim be-Toledot ha-flebrah ha-Yehudit, ed. E. Atkes and Y. Shulman (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1980), pp. 218-224, makes the point that most of the founders of the Hamburg Temple were either middle class or upper middle class. It is certain, however, that by the end of the century the majority of Orthodoxy's following was found among the poorer rural Jews of Germany. Most historians argue that an important cause in the spread of Reform was a desire to prove that the Jews were worthy of emancipation. For example, see Howard Morley Sachar, The Course of Modern Jewish History (New York: Dell, 1958), pp. 148-149. Michael A. Meyer, German Political Pressure and Jewish Religious Response in the Nineteenth Century (New York: Leo Baeck Institute, 1981), pp. 11-14, argues that Jewish leaders in the struggle for emancipation repeatedly and publicly declared their unwillingness to change religious beliefs or rituals in order to secure political rights. These pronouncements may have been made in order to preserve Jewish self-respect, but Meyer brings no proof that such unexpressed desires did not play a role in the spread of Reform dur- ing this period.</page><page sequence="4">184 STEVEN SINGER actually a direct link between events in Germany and those in London, stat- ing that "the new departure in destructive reform preached by Geiger, in Germany, in 1838 ... gave the cue to the unrest of the English Reformers."3 Lipman agrees with this thesis and maintains that the revolt against Ortho- doxy in London at this time was caused by the desire for emancipation joined with the imported ideas of the Mendelssohnian Haskalah and Ger- man Reform.4 Other historians have generally followed this interpretation.5 The truth, however, is quite different. A close study reveals that there was little similarity between the course of religious developments in mid- nineteenth-century Germany and those in London. On the contrary, England provided a completely alternative model of secularization and modernization to the one being created in Germany. The aspect of the Ger- man Jewish experience in which the great majority of the upper class advo- cated Reform Judaism was not at all characteristic of London. In England, the bulk of the wealthy within the Jewish community found ways of reacting to the pressures exerted by the nineteenth century while still remaining with- in the Orthodox fold. Indeed, this pattern of religiosity may have been more typical of general developments within the entire Western Jewish world than the one heretofore depicted by most historians for Germany.6 3.

Vivian David Lipman, "The Age of Emancipation," in Three Centuries of Anglo-Jewish History, ed. Vivian David Lipman (Cambridge: Jewish Historical Society of England, 1961), pp. 82-84. 5. For example, David Philipson, The Reform Movement in Judaism (New York: Mac- millan, 1931), p. 92, is completely unaware of any differences between the pressure for religious change in Germany and England, stating that "the influence of the movement for reform in Germany ... was of moment in the agitation for religious reform in England." Israel Finestein, A Short History ofA nglo-Jewry (London: Lincolns-Prager, 1957), p. 99, similarly notes that "it was inevitable that Anglo-Jewry should feel the impact of the changes which followed the life's work of Moses Mendelssohn," and that Reform Judaism "appeared to some, not only in Ger- many, to be natural and proper advances in an enlightened age." 6. There definitely was a socioeconomic cleavage along religious lines in contemporary German Jewry, with the upper class favoring Reform and the less wealthy backing Orthodoxy. However, Orthodoxy survived among all classes in Germany to a much greater extent than is usually realized. See Jacob Toury, "'Deutsche Juden' im Vormfirz," Bulletin des Leo Baeck Instituts 8 (1965): 65-82, and Steven M. Lowenstein, "The Pace of Modernisation of German Jewry," Leo Baeck Institute Yearbook 21 (1976): 41-54. Nineteenth-century France certainly provides somewhat of an exception to the pattern usually depicted for all the Western com- munities. Although the wealthy there were generally nonobservant and in favor of ritual change, to an extent much greater than in England, they still did not consider themselves Reform Jews or formally break their links with Orthodox Judaism. See Phyllis Cohen Albert,</page><page sequence="5">JEWISH RELIGIOUS THOUGHT IN EARLY VICTORIAN LONDON 185 Orthodox Judaism remained the creed of the overwhelming majority of the London community during these years, including the sizable prepon- derance of the Anglo-Jewish upper class, who were also simultaneously striving for emancipation and full acceptance into Gentile society. The London Reform congregation only attracted the support of a minority of the wealthy throughout this period and never succeeded, as Reform Judaism did on the Continent and in America, in becoming the representative of the acculturated and modernized segment of the community. Men of the stature of Salomons, Montefiore, and the Rothschilds remained within the Ortho- dox fold and did not feel that their loyalty to this version of their faith inhibited their social or political advancement in Gentile society. In this connection it should be noted that even the London reformers, who had officially left Orthodoxy, had little in common with the followers of the Continental movement bearing the same name. They were far more moder- ate and closer to Orthodoxy than reformers were elsewhere. It was this acceptance of Orthodoxy and the lack of a desire for Reform by the most acculturated and modernized class in the community which set London apart as a unique example of Jewish life in the nineteenth century. This is not to say that London was a bastion of traditional Orthodox belief and practice during this period. A large portion of the community, including most of the upper-class group, had drifted quite far from true Orthodox ideas and observances, retaining an outward loyalty to that creed which was often not consistent with their personal beliefs and actions. How- ever, they did not advocate the acceptance of Reform Judaism as a result of their own lack of conformity to tradition, but rather formed a party which remained within the Orthodox community, while it was, in reality, no longer Orthodox in many important ways. The religiously involved mid-nineteenth-century Orthodox London community can be divided into two distinct factions. One was the party of the old-style traditionalists, who were roughly comparable in their beliefs The Modernization of French Jewry (Hanover, N.H.: Brandeis University Press, 1977), pp. 50-54. There has been little research done on actual religious practice in the United States during these years, but here, too, the great majority of the community seems to have been nominally Orthodox, at least until 1870. See Leon A. Jick, The Americanization of the Syna- gogue, 1820-1870 (Hanover, N.H.: Brandeis University Press, 1976), pp. 174-194. Of course England differed from other Western communities in the depth to which traditionalism sur- vived there, but the sweeping pattern of Reform coming to control the Western world by the middle of the nineteenth century does not seem to be incontestably true.</page><page sequence="6">186 STEVEN SINGER and practices to those groups in other Western countries who remained loyal to Orthodox Judaism. The second faction was composed of the wealthy upper class, who remained within the Orthodox community despite their rejection of that faith in many aspects of their lives. For lack of a better term the first group can be referred to as traditionalists and the second as progressives, although they themselves did not use these labels. It should be noted that many, perhaps the majority of the Jews of London, did not belong to either of these two parties, since they were simply not interested or motivated enough to take a stand on religious matters.' Nevertheless, it is only by a study of these two factions, who were the active forces in the com- munity's religious life, that a clear picture can be gained of Judaism in mid- nineteenth-century London. The ideological position of the London traditionalists is quite easy to understand. These Jews were believers in Orthodox Judaism, not only in name but in reality as well. Their ideas and beliefs did not differ significantly from those held by Orthodox contemporaries elsewhere in the Jewish world. Basically their creed was identical with the traditional interpretation of Orthodoxy that had been handed down through the ages. Many traditional- ists seem to have accepted the adaptation of certain elements of Judaism to the English environment, when this modernization was confined to minor matters, such as the outward appearance of the synagogue and the titles of its functionaries.8 However, their willingness to accept this relatively un- 7. For example, John Mills, in his contemporary survey of the community and its religious life, noted that there were numerous Jews "to whom ... many of the facts recorded in the fol- lowing pages are as strange as to the Christian reader." John Mills, The British Jews (London: Houlston &amp; Stoneman, 1853), p. vi. A magazine article similarly observed that most Jewish youth were "equally free from the superstitions of their own sect and disinclined to take upon their necks the yoke of any other," while a contemporary novel described a wealthy Jew, undoubtedly typical of many, who, "solicitous to see his people relieved from the pressure of civil disabilities," had educated his son "in a large school, where all religious differences were smoothed down." See "The Jews of Western Europe," Westminster Review, April 1863, p. 246, and Charlotte Elizabeth [Mrs. Tonna], Judah's Lion (New York: M. W. Dodd, 1843), pp. 5-6, respectively. The best indication that this group was substantial is provided by Jewish Chroni- cle, 1 June 1855, which claimed that there were 3,692 Orthodox synagogue seats in London at a time that the Jewish community numbered between 20,000 and 25,000. While this figure is defi- nitely too low, since it ignores the many bevrot, as well as the poor who could not afford syna- gogue seats, it is still indicative of this situation. 8. The trend toward the Anglicization of these relatively minor parts of the community's religious life is discussed in Israel Finestein, "Anglo-Jewish Opinion During the Struggle for Emancipation," Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society of England 20 (1964): 124, and Vivian David Lipman, "The Anglo-Jewish Community in Victorian Society," in Folklore</page><page sequence="7">JEWISH RELIGIOUS THOUGHT IN EARLY VICTORIAN LONDON 187 important degree of Anglicization was not symptomatic of any change in their theoretical position. In their ideology the traditionalists remained firm- ly grounded in the doctrines of classical Orthodoxy without any significant change. The progressives, in contrast, had developed a totally original view of Jewish belief and practice. While they maintained an outward loyalty to Orthodoxy and the Orthodox community, much of this allegiance was ostensible rather than real. In actuality this group had arrived at a unique understanding of Judaism, peculiar to early Victorian London, which con- stituted a dramatic break with traditional Orthodox Judaism. The extent to which this revolt by the progressives against Orthodoxy was a totally original development has not been appreciated by previous historians. These writers have portrayed the intellectual movement away from Orthodoxy in London as a parallel trend to the drift from traditional belief and thought occurring in Germany at this time.9 The truth, however, is quite the opposite. There was little similarity between the ideology moti- vating the London upper class in their rebellion against tradition and the ideas inspiring their German coreligionists. The beliefs and doctrines of German Reform found little popular acceptance across the Channel and had almost no effect on Jewish thought in early Victorian London. The lack of any connection between the ideas of the progressives and those advocated by the German reformers is quite evident from the critical reception given by the intellectual leaders of the London group to the mea- sures adopted by their Continental brethren. For example, the Jewish Research Center Studies, vol. 5, ed. Dov Noy and Issachar Ben Ami (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1975), p. 158. It is quite significant that there is relatively little mention in the records of the period of opposition by traditionalists toward these developments. Some members of this faction, especially the recent immigrants, were uncomfortable with this trend and did show their unhappiness by leaving the large "English" synagogues for the newly emerbing bevrot during this period. However, many traditionalists, perhaps even the majority of the faction, remained in the congregations exhibiting such minor signs of Anglicization, which, it seems, they were able to accept with equanimity. This was particularly true of the native-born or -bred upper-class members of this group. 9. Both Finestein and Lipman in their surveys of this period describe the community's growing disloyalty to tradition without noting that, at least on the part of the progressives, there was an original ideological basis for this departure from Orthodoxy. Indeed, they seem to be unaware of the existence of such an ideological group within the community. See Finestein, Short History, pp. 126-128, and Vivian David Lipman, Social History of the Jews in England 1850-1950 (London: Watts, 1954), pp. 34-40. The ideas of German Reform are the only intel- lectual influences on the early Victorian community which are noted by these historians. For example, see Finestein, Short History, p. 99, and Lipman, "Age of Emancipation," pp. 82-84.</page><page sequence="8">188 STEVEN SINGER Chronicle, the leading progressive voice in the community, noted that the conference of Reform rabbis held at Frankfurt in 1845, which had permitted public prayer in the vernacular and accepted the introduction of the organ, had "gone so far" that English Jews could not support its conclusions.'0 Similarly, in 1855 the Chronicle observed that some congregations in Ger- many had instituted prayers in the vernacular, but that "we, however, con- sider such an innovation as unnecessary, fraught with mischief, and likely to deprive Jews of a certain aptitude which we should deplore as a real loss."" Marcus Breslau, editor of the Chronicle, probably summed up the feelings of his party about the most extreme German reformers when he denounced them as "infidels, who have thrown off the burden of all religion, who discard the oral and adopt only a few of the written laws which suit their convenience."'2 The London progressives arrived at their original view of Judaism by advocating a neo-Karaite exposition of their faith. In accordance with this concept they accepted all the biblical laws as divine and binding while reject- ing the entire interpretative body of rabbinic tradition embodied in the Talmud. Unlike the German reformers they did not deny the authority of the ceremonial requirements of the Bible, but rather maintained that all such biblical laws were fully incumbent on the modern Jew. The progressives' break with Orthodoxy was caused by their rejection, in a remarkable re- enactment of the Karaite controversy of a millennium before, of the Oral Law and the rabbinic tradition. There was, of course, no direct link between the medieval Karaites and these nineteenth-century rebels against Ortho- doxy, but the similarity in their views is most striking. This neo-Karaite view of Judaism was not confined to the progressives but was accepted by the London Reform congregation as well. Indeed, that group espoused this philosophy to a far greater and more open degree than did the progressives. This was because the latter, as nominal members of the Orthodox community, were unable to express their opinions as clearly and 10. Jewish Chronicle, 17 October 1845.

Neo-Karaism, on the part of many pro- gressives, was often not a clearly stated position, but rather an unexpressed assumption which underlay their actions. As far as the London reformers were concerned, however, such ideas were the openly stated beliefs of their faith. In practical terms, though, the views of both groups were almost iden- tical. They only differed in the extent to which they had developed their ideas and publicly given expression to them. The writings of Grace Aguilar, a leading Anglo-Jewish author of this period, provide a good example of how neo-Karaite thinking was adopted by the progressives. Aguilar, who was born in 1816 to an old London Sephardic family, was raised in a remote area of Devonshire, where she came into close contact with the strong Protestant climate of rural England. Alarmed by Christian attempts to convert her brethren, she was moved to write a series of books in order to explain Judaism to English-speaking Jews and give Jewish youth pride in their religious heritage.'3 Aguilar had no con- nection with the London reformers, being rather a progressive whose father and brother were active in Bevis Marks, and her works provide a mine of information for the religious views of the faction with which she was associ- ated.'4 In her writings Aguilar continually placed the Bible on a pedestal of unquestioned authority and simultaneously downgraded the Oral Law as having little importance. For example, she declared that "the Bible and reason are the only guides to which the child of Israel can look in security. The laws for which we can find no foundation in one, and which will not stand the test of the other ... are wanderings from the true and only law, the inventions of man and not the words of God." She then concluded this argument by stating that "those observances . .. for which no reason can be assigned save the ideas of our ancient fathers, cannot be compared in weight 13. A study of her life and work can be found in Beth-Zion L. Abrahams, "Grace Aguilar," Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society of England 16 (1952): 137-148. 14. The fact that Aguilar forwarded a copy of her book The Jewish Faith to Chief Rabbi Adler for review is a clear indication of her at least nominal loyalty to Orthodoxy. A notation of a letter from Adler to Aguilar, dated 22 November 1846, in which the chief rabbi returned her book "with thanks," is listed in Index, vol. 84, Records of the Office of the Chief Rabbi. However, nothing more than this is recorded about the contents of the letter. Acceptance of her views by the progressives is indicated in James Picciotto, Sketches ofAnglo-Jewish History, 2d ed., edited by Israel Finestein (London: Soncino Press, 1956), p. 355, where the author, a defi- nite progressive, noted that Aguilar in her works "displays signs of no mean acquaintance with Jewish and Christian philosophers and divines."</page><page sequence="10">190 STEVEN SINGER and consequence to the piety of the heart, which but too often they super- sede."'5 Again she criticized Jews who, "earnest in the cause, yet mistaken in the means, search and believe the writings of the Rabbis, take as divine truths all they have suggested, and neglect the Bible as not to be compared with such learned dissertations."'6 In another connection Aguilar empha- sized the importance of teaching the Bible to Jewish children, since it would cause them "to rise superior to the superstitions of tradition and prejudice, which have shackled them so long, and to look to their Bibles alone for support."'7 As a nominally Orthodox Jew, Aguilar did not openly reject the Oral Law but rather downplayed its importance. In one passage she called the talmudic rabbis "holy and good men," but went on to argue that they never intended their enactments to remain for all time. "Circumstances," she asserted, "demand the modification, even the alteration, of some of these Rabbinical statutes; and could the wise and pious originators have been consulted on the subject, they would have unhesitatingly adopted those measures."'8 On another occasion she attempted to avoid the entire ques- tion of the Oral Law by noting that "we allude not to the Oral Law, nor would we enter into the wild labyrinth of pros and cons, with which this question is now agitating the whole Jewish nation. Our aim is simply to explain the words of the Bible."''1 Again she observed that "of the delivery or non-delivery by the Eternal of an oral law, we write not at all. . . . we are ready and willing to submit our opinions on all points to the wisdom and piety of our venerable sages," provided that "the Bible . . . be the key to both laws, and so perfect in itself."20 15. Grace Aguilar, The Spirit of Judaism, ed. Isaac Leeser (Philadelphia: C. Sherman, 1842), p. 228. This work was edited by Leeser, a traditional Orthodox Jew, who often took issue with Aguilar's views in his footnotes to the text. 16. Ibid., p. 51. Her concept of the Bible is clear from her statement that "the Bible must not be considered, as it unfortunately too often is, synonymous with the Pentateuch. The same Almighty . .. who inspired Moses to write those five books, inspired other holy men. ... One part is quite as holy and quite as binding as the other." Grace Aguilar, The Jewish Faith (Phila- delphia: L. Johnson, 1864), p. 66. This was again a departure from traditional Orthodoxy, which, in contrast to Christianity and Karaism, always accepted the greater authority of the Pentateuch. 17. Aguilar, Spirit of Judaism, p. 103.

Aguilar's tendency toward neo-Karaism was noted by</page><page sequence="11">JEWISH RELIGIOUS THOUGHT IN EARLY VICTORIAN LONDON 191 The views expressed by Aguilar were characteristic of the thinking of other progressives as well. For example, Aguilar developed the idea of a "scriptural Judaism" that would be faithful to the Bible rather than the Oral Law.2' This same concept was expressed by Moses Angel, headmaster of the Jews' Free School and a leading progressive, who stated that he wanted to "preserve only principles and scriptural ceremonies . . . because they alone are eternal."22 In another passage Angel again criticized rabbinic tradition, noting that "the religion of Moses is not attacked, for no system can be more pure or more perfect," but that "what suited admirably the exposition of Judaism before the world in 1 100, is by no means adapted to represent it in the nineteenth century."23 London reformers had also used the term "scriptural" to express their revolt against the Oral Law, claiming that "the adoption of a more simple and scriptural book of prayers"'24 had been one of the reasons for their break with Orthodoxy. A striking illustration of the extent to which neo-Karaite ideas had pene- trated the progressive community is provided by the controversy at this time over the introduction of civil divorce for Anglo-Jewry. Until 1857 the chief rabbi and the bet din were the only authorities recognized by the government as possessing the right to dissolve Jewish marriages. In that year, however, a bill was introduced in Parliament to deprive the bet din of this right and make Jews subject to the secular in divorce matters. This caused Chief Rabbi Adler to send a letter to the Board of Deputies, which was the recog- nized community spokesman, urging that body to oppose the bill. During the board's discussion of the question a speaker attempted to support Adler's position by noting that with this bill "a distinct law of Moses, which they were all bound to obey, would be set aside. It was not tradition, it was the written law which would be violated." An opponent of the letter then responded that it was untrue that the proposed measure would contradict the Bible, since "the Biblical law spoke of a letter of divorcement . . . but makes no mention whatever of the interposition of an ecclesiastical court."25 a contemporary who wrote that she had "bent the combined energies of a life of love and hope towards disassociating the synagogue from tradition, and leading it back to the Old Testa- ment."

Even the speaker who defended the get argued for it as "a law of Moses ... the written law," undoubtedly in response to the well-known views of his progressive colleagues. Such a dis- cussion would have been impossible elsewhere in the Orthodox Jewish world and was a clear revelation of the neo-Karaite views which were domi- nant in some London circles. A novel by an anonymous Jewish writer of this period similarly reflects these ideas. One of this book's characters is a member of the Orthodox com- munity described as "a reformer in everything but name," who "admired the institutions and the new method of carrying out the Jewish religion,"26 obviously a phenomenon common to many progressives who officially remained within the Orthodox fold. The thinking of such Jews is clearly revealed by an argument in the story between this character and his tradi- tionalist nephew, in which the uncle indignantly demands to know why the Sabbath is prolonged "from twenty-four to nearly twenty-eight hours ... when it is distinctly ordained that the Sabbath shall continue from 'sunset to sunset'?" When the nephew answers that the rabbis had lengthened it, the. uncle responds by asking: "What right have they to make new laws?"27 It was clearly this popular neo-Karaite approach to Judaism which Chief Rabbi Adler meant to attack when he spoke at the Western Syna- gogue in 1856 about "the false views . . entertained by many of our breth- ren" and explained that he was referring to "false notions about the authority of our sages."28 Again the chief rabbi undoubtedly had the pro- gressives in mind when in 1854 he denounced "some within our own pale who will believe in the divinity of the written law, and who yet deny the divinity of the oral law ... like the Sadducees . . . and the Karaites."29 A similar response was made to this group by a traditionalist work of the time, which observed that the Oral Law "has been made the subject of much 26.

Adler probably picked this congregation for such a warn- ing just because of its pronounced progressive leanings. It was probably the place in London that, in his view, most required such a sermon. 29. Nathan Marcus Adler, Solomon's Judgement: A Picture of Israel (London: J.

The progressives, having placed so much emphasis on the words of the Bible, obviously could not call for the abolition of institutions which were clearly prescribed in that book. For example, Aguilar defended the dietary laws, "which are generally seized upon by nominal religionists, and declared to relate solely to the Eastern natiQns," since "we have the evidence of the whole Pentateuch ... to convince us that the same infinite Mercy framed these, comparatively trivial as they are, as every other which His book con- tains."3' In a similar vein she urged the wearing of phylacteries and fringes as the "adoption of the ancient dress in the hours of prayer," given "to aid and strengthen the spirit of piety."32 However, despite this nominal alle- giance to the ceremonial laws, there was a clear tendency on the part of the progressives to emphasize the greater importance of the ethical ideas of Judaism. Aguilar expressed this concept by writing that "ritual observances ... cannot be compared in weight and consequence to the piety of the heart, which but too often, they supersede,"33 while Angel noted that "in the zeal with which orthodoxy has clung to the shell it has lost the kernel."34 This trend actually constituted one of the few similarities between the ideas of the London group and those of their Continental coreligionists rebelling against Orthdoxy at this time. As mentioned earlier, the London reformers espoused a view of Judaism that was basically identical with that of the progressives. Indeed, the former were even more vigorously neo-Karaite in their beliefs than the latter. This is a point which has been unappreciated by most historians, who usually describe the London reformers as an English branch of the Reform move- ment developing in Germany at this time. The truth, however, is that there 30. Miriam Mendes Belisario, Sabbath Evenings at Home (London: S. Joel, 1856), p. 136. 31. Aguilar, Spirit of Judaism, p. 237.

For example, the prayerbook used by this group was far more conservative than anything advocated by Ger- man Reform at this time. Both the musaf service, with its mention of the restoration of the sacrificial cult, as well as the prayers for the return to Zion and the coming of the Messiah were retained unabridged by the London congregation, at a time when German Reform was united in opposition to those parts of the liturgy.36 In addition, the laws of the London congregation required that all prayers be recited exclusively in Hebrew, something which would have been completely unacceptable to reformers elsewhere.37 Even the structure of the group's sanctuary conformed, during its early years, to Orthodox practice, with the reader's platform being placed at the rear of the synagogue rather than at its front, which was something not done in any Continental Reform synagogue.38 Furthermore, the London congregation 35. Philipson, Reform Movement, p. 92, claims that English Reform was a direct result of the German movement, as do Finestein, Short History, p. 99, and Lipman, "Age of Emancipa- tion," pp. 82-84. Two recent historians are, however, aware that there was a difference between the English movement and its German namesake. See Jakob J. Petuchowski, Prayerbook Reform in Europe (New York: World Union for Progressive Judaism, 1968), p. 66, and Robert Liberles, "The Origins of the Jewish Reform Movement in England," AJS Review 1 (1976): 135-137. However, neither of these two writers sufficiently emphasizes the huge gulf which separated the two movements. It should be noted that in the contemporary Manchester com- munity, ideas imported from Germany did play a major role in the development of a Reform congregation. See Bill Williams, The Making of Manchester Jewry, 1740-1875 (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1976), pp. 259-260. The Manchester congregation was domi- nated by recently arrived German immigrants, unlike the group in London, which was com- posed of native English families with a majority of Sephardim. 36. Philipson, Reform Movement, p. 101, and Petuchowski, Prayerbook Reform, pp. 66-68. There was debate within German Reform as to whether the musaf service should be totally omitted or whether it should be retained with the elimination of references to the sacrifices; however, no group within that movement favored the retention of this service without any change. The same was true of the petitions for the return to Zion and the coming of the Messiah. Petuchowski, Prayerbook Reform, pp. 240-246 and 277-297. 37.

The removal of the bimah to the front of the synagogue was a point of major conflict between Reform and Orthodox groups on the Continent. See</page><page sequence="15">JEWISH RELIGIOUS THOUGHT IN EARLY VICTORIAN LONDON 195 continued to advocate the observance of ceremonial laws, such as phylac- teries and kashrut, which were being attacked or deemphasized by German Reform.39 An interesting illustration of how far loyalty to the ceremonial laws went on the part of some of the London reformers is provided by Frederic David Mocatta, the son of a founder of the congregation and later one of its leaders, who observed the Sabbath so strictly that he never would ride in a carriage on that day.40 The London reformers openly stated that neo-Karaism was at the root of their ideology. David Marks, the minister of the congregation, expressed this clearly when he proclaimed during a sermon that his party "solemnly deny, that a belief in the divinity of the traditions contained in the Mishna, and the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmud, is of equal obligation to the Israelite with the faith in the divinity of the Law of Moses."41 A work of the time similarly observed, after describing the Orthodox belief in the Oral Law, that "the Caraites and some of the Jews of the present day, known by Encyclopaedia Judaica, s.v. "Bimah." In the London congregation the platform was at the rear and not the center, in accordance with traditional Sephardic rather than Ashkenazic practice. Furthermore, this synagogue did not introduce an organ, which was everywhere the major dividing line between the Orthodox and the reformers, until 1859, almost twenty years after its founding. Philipson, Reform Movement, p. 106. 39. Voice of Jacob, 4 March 1842, noted that phylacteries were worn at this synagogue on Purim. Albert M. Hyamson, The London Board for Shechita 1804-1954 (London: By the Board, 1954), p. 24, describes how the congregation, after its formation in 1840, established a poulterer for whom its sexton, a licensed shobet, killed fowl. This fact was also noted by Beli- sario, Sabbath Evenings, p. 139, who stated that the reformers' meat was "provided only by Jewish butchers ... they will not eat it killed otherwise than according to our laws." Both phylacteries and the dietary laws were attacked by German Reform Judaism. See Jewish Encyclopedia, s.v. "Phylacteries," and Encyclopaedia Judaica, s.v. "Dietary Laws." 40.

Petuchowski, "Karaite Tendencies in an Early Reform Haggadah," Hebrew Union College Annual 31 (1960): 223-249, mentions the unique neo-Karaism of the London reformers. He notes that the retention of the traditional musaf and lack of an organ are indications of how different their ideas were from German Reform. However, Petuchowski makes no complete survey of the London congregation's prac- tices and theology, and how fully they accorded with the Karaite view. For example, he does not link the London group's retention of Hebrew prayers and the traditional petitions for the return to Zion and restoration of sacrifices to this faction's neo-Karaite scriptural theology. He similarly states that, aside from abolishing the second days of festivals, the congregation made no active efforts to repudiate rabbinic Judaism. No mention is made of the group's attitude and practices in regard to ceremonials and rituals of biblical origin. 41. David Woolf Marks, Sermons, 3 vols. (London: R. Groombridge, 1851-84), 1:7. Marks concluded this statement with the comment that "for Israelites, there is but One immutable Law-the sacred volume of the Scriptures."</page><page sequence="16">196 STEVEN SINGER the name of 'Reformed Israelites' do not subscribe to this doctrine. They profess a belief in the divinity of the written Law only."42 It is striking that this contemporary writer was aware of the almost identical view of Judaism shared by these early Victorian Jews and the medieval Karaites. The creed and practices of the secessionist London congregation were completely in accordance with this neo-Karaite way of thinking. Their tra- ditional stance on questions such as the observance of the ceremonial laws, the restoration of sacrifices, the return to Zion, and the use of Hebrew in prayer was due, at least in an intellectual way, to the fact that all these requirements had solid biblical backing. It would have been extremely diffi- cult for the reformers, given their reverence for the Written Law, to oppose such measures logically. On the other hand, they strongly advocated the abolition of the second days of festivals, which was a proposal found to be too radical by some German reformers of the time.43 Their support of such a revolutionary move, so out of keeping with their moderation on the other issues, can only be understood as having been due, at least in a theoretical sense, to the second days' providing a clear example of a rabbinic ordinance which had supplanted an earlier biblical requirement.44 No better issue could have been chosen by the neo-Karaites of London with which to show their rebellion against the Oral Law than this case, in which the rabbinic tradition actually seemed to contradict the Bible itself. Of course, there may have been socioeconomic factors which were also responsible for the sup- port of these positions by the English reformers, but the theoretical justifica- tion for their actions was definitely provided by neo-Karaism.45 42. Moritz Davidsohn, Moral and Religious Guide (London: Houlston &amp; Stoneman, 1855), p. 8. It has proven impossible to obtain any information about this author. 43. The observance of the second days of festivals was abolished by the London Reform congregation from its very inception. This practice was striking considering that body's moder- ation on other religious issues. This was indeed pointed out by an anonymous letter in Jewish Chronicle, 20 December 1844, which noted that the only real difference separating the reformers from Orthodoxy was their rejection of the second days. In Germany, on the other hand, much opposition to such an abolition was expressed at the Breslau Reform conference of 1846. Indeed, the conclusion of the conference was that the days should be retained in those communities where they were desired by the masses. Philipson, Reform Movement, pp. 214-215. 44. The origin of the second days and the relation of this observance to earlier biblical prac- tice is described in Encyclopaedia Judaica, s.v. "Festivals." 45.

This can most clearly be seen from a study of the progressives' observance of the Sabbath. Cessation of labor on the Sab- bath was openly demanded by the Bible, but it was the Oral Law which spelled out specifically what activities were to be included in the prohibition. The progressives, who implicitly rejected the authority or at least the pri- macy of the Oral Law, developed their own guidelines, not necessarily iden- tical with those of rabbinic tradition, regarding what was to be considered forbidden labor on the Sabbath. They seem to have interpreted this prohibi- tion as demanding a break from one's activity in earning a living, but not a cessation from other actions forbidden by rabbinic tradition, although not done in seeking a livelihood. According to this view, an individual who absented himself from his business on Saturday could be considered a Sab- bath observer, even though he might not attend synagogue on that day or refrain from smoking, handling money, or any of the other Orthodox Sab- bath prohibitions. The prevalence of such beliefs and actions in progressive circles is indi- cated by a sermon given at the Western Synagogue by Henry A. Henry, that congregation's preacher. In a speech on Sabbath observance, Henry strongly condemned those who thought that they fulfilled this duty "by con- sulting our own ease-by indulging in our own pride ... in a manner suita- ble only to our own feelings and our own dispositions."46 In a clear allusion to the neo-Karaite ideas found among his audience, he noted that "we hal- this issue. One of the charges often made at the time to deny Jews the right to hold public office was that their religion would interfere with their work due to the many holidays on which they were prohibited to labor. To counteract such a perception, he argues, the London reformers advocated the abolition of the second days, thereby attempting to reduce by half the number of festivals on which work was proscribed. This explanation probably has some truth in it, but the neo-Karaism of the reformers was certainly just as important in influencing their position. The group's traditional stands on Hebrew prayer and the return to Zion were also undoubtedly influenced by the reverence for such ideas current in early Victorian Christian society and not only by the reformers' neo-Karaite beliefs. These influences are more fully described at the end of this paper. 46. Henry A. Henry, Six Discourses on the Principles of the Religious Belief of Israel (London: By the Author, 1845), p. 124. Henry was born in London and educated at the Jews' Free School. He served as preacher and bazzan of the Western Synagogue from 1841 until 1849, when he left London for the United States. Though he was minister of a strongly progressive congregation, he espoused traditionalist beliefs in his sermons.

Thus the schoolmaster ... would be interdicted from affording instruction on the Sabbath ... but might be per- mitted to carry a load, as that to him would not be a labour, but perhaps an agreeable change."48 Indeed, Charlotte Montefiore, a Reform writer, openly stated in 1853 that "each individual must shape his own Sabbath, for it should realize a good to himself, and must therefore harmonize with the general tone of his mind."49 The actual Sabbath observance of many London Jews was quite consis- tent with this concept of Sabbath rest. A considerable part of the community who did not go to their jobs on Saturday, nevertheless, spent the Sabbath hours at theaters, music halls, and other places of public entertainment, since after all they were resting from their daily labors. A contemporary noted this situation by stating that on the Sabbath "the warehouse is closed and the exchange is deserted; but still amongst many, nothing holy or solemn takes the place of their weekly avocations. . . . open shops, galleries, exhibitions, public places of resort, are constant allurements, and help to fill up the weariness of an empty day."50 Henry similarly asked, when discussing popular observance of the Sabbath, whether there was "one human vanity, but what is meant on that day to be chiefly indulged! one human appetite, which shall not be sought to be pampered; one human passion but shall on 47. Ibid., p. 121.

The progressives' concept of Sabbath observance influenced their response to the charge that Jews should not be admitted to Parliament because they would not be able to attend there on the Sabbath and festivals. In 1848 the Jewish Chronicle responded to this argument by noting that David Salomons, in discharging all his duties as alderman of London on the Sabbath, "felt he was acting in accordance with the spirit of the Jewish reli- gion . . . because he was not there to serve any personal interest of his own, but to promote measures for the public good."54 This periodical used the same reasoning in appealing to the community to vote in the parliamentary elections of 1857, which were held on Saturday, stating that "the Sabbath is hallowed not desecrated, by the protest against the violation of the sacred principle of civil and religious liberty."55 An interesting indication of how far removed the progressives' concept of the Sabbath was from traditional Jewish thought is provided by Angel's comment that the Bible prohibits cooking on that day in order to limit the material enjoyment and to promote the spirituality of the Sabbath. The Jew, he wrote, "by confining himself to uninviting or cold and therefore unstimu- lating food ... prevented any corruptive influence from alienating his soul from the duties entailed by the Sabbath."56 This idea was the antithesis of 51. Henry, Six Discourses, pp. 118-119. 52. "A Few Words on the Sabbath," Jewish Sabbath Journal, 3 February 1855.

Angel was probably unaware of the historical background of this issue, but it was this very point that had been a major subject of conflict between the medieval Karaites and Rabbanites, with the Karaites espousing the same view presented here by Angel. This entire complex of neo-Karaite ideas was, as noted earlier, a unique development within the English community, with no parallels elsewhere in the contemporary Jewish world. The roots of the ideology, shared to a great extent by the London progressives and reformers, must therefore be found within Gentile English society and the currents of thought present there, rather than be considered the local result of a philosophical movement agitating the entire Western Jewish world. A major element in British Protestant thought from the Reformation onwards was a strong trend toward Bibliocentrism, whereby the Bible was placed on a pedestal as the final and unchallengeable authority in all matters of religion. This emphasis given to the Scriptures and the extreme veneration given their every word was far more characteristic of Protestantism in Eng- land than it was of that faith elsewhere in Europe. Through the constant stress on the Bible the English people became more familiar with its contents than any other nation in the Christian world, and in a number of subtle sub- conscious ways began to view themselves as the chosen people of God and the Scriptures as the story of their own national heritage. This trend of thought had its roots in the work of John Wycliff and the Lollard movement in medieval times and was greatly strengthened during the Reformation, as the various successive English translations of the Bible made that book the possession of every Englishman able to read.57 Bibliocentrism reached its extreme point of development with the Puri- tans, who were persecuted by the established church just because they refused to accept any religious authority aside from the Scriptures.58 After the Restoration, this trend, along with all other expressions of religious fer- vor, went into eclipse, as the aristocracy became oriented toward rational- 57. The best description of the origins of Bibliocentrism and its strong effects on English culture and thought can be found in Barbara W. Tuchman, Bible and Sword (New York: New York University Press, 1956). The medieval origins of this trend and its further development during the sixteenth century are discussed in this work on pp. 52-56. 58. Tuchman accurately describes this situation by writing that "the essence of the Puritan faith was the right of every man to interpret God's law, as embodied in the Bible and only in the Bible, directly to himself." Ibid., p. 80.</page><page sequence="21">JEWISH RELIGIOUS THOUGHT IN EARLY VICTORIAN LONDON 201 ism and deism. However, primarily as a result of the French Revolution, the nineteenth century was the time of a great religious resurgence, known as the Evangelical Revival, which brought back traditional English Protestantism and its Bibliocentric approach to a dominant position in society." The Evangelical Revival's great influence was typified in the person of Anthony Cooper, the seventh earl of Shaftesbury, a leading intellectual figure of the early Victorian period, for whom the Bible was "'God's word written' from the very first syllable down to the very last and from the last back to the first." 60 The same approach was expressed by many other figures of the time as well. For example, when The Pentateuch Critically Examined, the first English work of biblical criticism, was published in 1862, it was violently attacked by the bishop of Manchester, who wrote: "The very foundations of our faith, the very basis of our hopes, the very nearest and dearest of our consolations are taken from us when one line in that Sacred Volume on which we base everything is declared to be unfaithful or untrustworthy."61 Josias Wilson, a contemporary preacher, had similarly stated in 1846 that "the Bible, the Bible only, is the religion of Protestants. Long may it be the boast and foundation of our religion."62 In short, early Victorian England was militantly Bibliocentric, to an extent unknown probably since the Puri- tan era of Cromwell.63 This emphasis on the Bible also helped reinforce anti-Catholicism, which was another important trend in early Victorian thought. Hatred of the Catholic church had complex roots in popular English culture, going back to that church's opposition to Queen Elizabeth in the sixteenth century and its association with the tyranny of James II in the seventeenth century. This prejudice was based on a whole group of emotions, including religious differences, political uneasiness, and the identification of Rome with those 59. Ibid., pp. 95-116. 60. Ibid., p. 113. 61.

That faith was thus regarded as a perversion of the truth and an enemy of the Scriptures as well as of the British people.65 It can easily be seen how these important motifs in English thought encouraged the growth of neo-Karaism within the wealthy progressive circles. The poor or middle-class traditionalists were mostly recent immi- grants possessing little knowledge of or interest in the ideology of British Protestantism. Even the more Anglicized individuals among them were pre- dominantly middle class with limited social and political ambitions. As a result they did not feel pressured to bring their religious ideas more in accord with those of Gentile society. It was the acculturated upper class who came into close contact with Gentile views, and they, especially given their strong desire for achieving full emancipation and integration into British society, could not help but be affected by those ideas. These wealthy Jews were subtly led, more often unintentionally than intentionally, to a redefini- tion of their own Judaism, giving it a biblical rather than a rabbinic orienta- tion to make it more acceptable in the eyes of the Gentile world. This was especially true because the tenets of Orthodox Judaism and the Talmud were specifically being attacked in British thinking at this time for their lack of faithfulness to the Bible. For example, in 1851 the Family Herald of London, after criticizing Catholic scholasticism as a falsification of true religion, went on to note that "the parentage of this science . . may be traced to the Jewish Rabbis and the principles of Jewish Casuistry may be found in the Talmud." It then concluded approvingly, obviously in reference to the London Reform congregation, that "a considerable secession had of late taken place amongst the Jews ... into Talmudists and anti-Talmudists, 64. In the words of one historian: "The Roman Church was a complex of such associations, all of them unpleasant. It was the living embodiment of every un-English vice, the national anti-type which defined all manner of native virtue, and as such was loathed ... by Englishmen of all shades of theological opinion." Sheridan Gilley, "Protestant London, No-Popery and the Irish Poor 1830-60," Recusant History 10 (January 1970): 213. A good study of this attitude can be found in G. F. A. Best, "Popular Protestantism in Victorian Britain," in Ideas and Insti- tutions of Victorian Britain, ed. Robert Robson (London: G. Bell &amp; Sons, 1967), pp. 115-142. 65. Best, "Popular Protestantism," pp. 122-123, discusses this situation and notes that "the relative unimportance in the Roman scheme of religious education, of Bible study" was an important element in Victorian anti-Catholicism.</page><page sequence="23">JEWISH RELIGIOUS THOUGHT IN EARLY VICTORIAN LONDON 203 a division corresponding pretty nearly to that of Catholic and Protestant."66 This same unfavorable identification of rabbinic Judaism with Catholicism was made by a contemporary preacher, who devoted an entire lecture to proving that these two religions "bear a most striking and wonderful resem- blance ... both these churches give the Word of God an inferior position."67 The prestigious Times illustrated how far anti-talmudism had penetrated Victorian thought when it argued, in response to those opposing Jewish emancipation, that the upper-class Jews likely to be elected to Parliament were not "remarkable for an obstinate credulity in all the fables of the Tal- mud," and hence were deserving of political equality.68 The prevailing negative attitude toward the Talmud and the feeling that it had subverted the meaning of the Bible and corrupted true religion among the Jews is evident on a popular level from several novels of the time. For example, Osborn Heighway, the author of a book about a Jew who converts to Protestantism, observed at the start of his story that the Jews "have intro- duced an enormous rival to divine revelation, under the pretence that it is a comment upon the Law of Moses. This they call the Mishna, or oral law."69 Later this same tale introduces a Jewish character who explains that he has lost his faith "through reading the Old Testament and comparing it with the Talmud."70 A similar comment was made by Heighway in another novel, in which he stated that his Jewish heroine regarded "the Talmud and all its foolish fripperies with intense disgust."7" In a third work Heighway again described a Jewish character who was "a strict Talmudist" and violently objected to having his son read from the Bible.72 The missionary efforts directed at the Jews during this period used these same arguments.

For example, in one passage McCaul criticized the rabbis for demanding that "the written law of God is to have only half as much attention as the traditions of men,"77 while in another, he condemned the rabbinic system of legislation as "an invasion of what is considered a Divine command."78 Most interesting is his strong attack on the observance of the second days of festivals as "altogether a human institution," of which "the original object ... has long since ceased."79 The rabbis' "utter want of consideration for the poor," wrote McCaul, "is most strikingly displayed in the institution and exaction of a second holy day, where God has required the observance of only one, as the Rabbis themselves acknowledged."80 In McCaul's case the influence of the Bibliocentrism of the Evangelical Revival in forming his attitude toward Judaism is quite clear, as McCaul was led 73.

McCaul's book in particular seems to have been familiar to the community, as indicated by the fact that The Paths of Truth, a refutation of his work, was published by London Jews in 1847.82 An anonymous pamphlet which appeared at this time, entitled Jewish Emancipation, was also obviously writ- ten under the influence of these ideas. This work argued that the Oral Law had to be abolished, since "political enfranchisement is but a limited part of emancipation. .... no chains are so heavy as those that shackle the mind."83 An example of how Bibliocentrism and the thinking of the Evangelical Revival had begun to influence assimilated Jews even earlier is provided by The Genius of Judaism, a book published anonymously in 1833 by Isaac D'Israeli, father of the famous Benjamin Disraeli. In this work D'Israeli stated that his express purpose was to show that "the institutes of Moses are not in reality the laws of the Jews. . .. two human codes have superseded the code delivered from heaven; the one originates in imposture-that of their traditions; the other is founded on tyranny-that of their customs."84 D'Israeli went on to attack the Oral Law savagely and to praise the Karaites remaining in the Eastern Jewish communities, by writing that "the most rational Jews would of course constitute a very small minority ... these Jewish Protestants are supposed not to exceed three or four thousand."85 Although by the time he published this work D'Israeli was totally alienated 81. Tuchman, Bible and Sword, p. 119. 82. According to its title page, this book was written by a Rabbi Judah Middleman of Warsaw in Hebrew and then translated into English by Marcus Breslau of the Jewish Chronicle. Nothing more is, however, known of Rabbi Middleman. Jewish Encyclopedia, s.v. "McCaul, Alexander," also states that McCaul's book "created considerable interest among Jews." Petu- chowski, "Karaite Tendencies," pp. 228-229, mentions McCaul's work as an influence on the development of neo-Karaite ideas among the London reformers. However, he makes no men- tion of Middleman's work as evidence of McCaul's influence. Aside from citing McCaul, Petuchowski does not refer to the whole complex of English Protestant thought with its strong Bibliocentrism and bias against the Oral Law. It was this ideology and the various works produced by it, rather than just McCaul's book, which encouraged neo-Karaite thought among London Jewry. 83.

In light of the Evangelical trend identifying rabbinic Judaism with Catho- licism, D'Israeli's statement gains much added significance. In an earlier passage he similarly</page><page sequence="26">206 STEVEN SINGER from the Jewish community, it was still natural that his book should have been read by his coreligionists and must have played a role in influencing the thoughts of at least some of them.86 While the sources for Victorian neo-Karaism can now be understood, the problem still remains of explaining why the progressives, whose view of Judaism was basically identical with that of the London reformers, did not join those reformers in their openly neo-Karaite synagogue, but rather remained within the Orthodox community, which was nominally loyal to rabbinic Judaism. The only explanation suggested for this situation has been given by Robert Liberles, who argues that the reformers represented the old Anglo-Jewish aristocracy, such as the Goldsmids and Mocattas, who had been displaced from their dominance of the community by a group of nouveau riche families, including the Rothschilds and Salomons. Out of a desire to reassert their influence, the older families formed the Reform con- gregation as a new community, distinct from the existing one. Naturally then, the nouveau riche progressives remained at the helm of the established Orthodox community rather than joining the Reform synagogue led by their social rivals.87 There may be some truth to this thesis, although Liberles does not really offer any proof for it from contemporary sources. There was, however, another factor, whose existence is clearly documented during this era, which was undoubtedly responsible to a great extent for this situation. England was a very traditional society with a pronounced preference for slow, organic change rather than violent revolution, and the progressives, who had in most respects absorbed English patterns of thought, shared in this observed that the Oral Law had "immersed the Hebrews in a mass of ritual ordinances ... hardly equalled by their subsequent mimics of the papistry." Ibid., pp. 77-78. 86. D'Israeli, although a freethinker, maintained his official connection with the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue until 1817, when he left the community and had his childen bap- tized. He himself, however, never converted. His biography can be found in Encyclopaedia Judaica, s.v. "D'Israeli, Isaac." The influence of The Genius of Judaism on the later anonymous pamphlet Jewish Emancipation is apparent from a number of instances. For example, the latter work claimed that since "the laws concerning the food we may eat... are at all times binding," the rabbis had no right to allow the sick to eat nonkosher food. This unusual argument was a restatement of the earlier work's comment that according to the rabbis, "a prescription of the physician is allowed to suspend the law of Moses." See Jewish Emancipation, p. 24, and Genius of Judaism, p. 167, respectively. It is unlikely that such a strange charge was originated by the later author on his own. 87.

They desired certain religious changes in both doctrine and practice, but they wanted those alterations to come in an evolutionary manner rather than in one which would violently destroy the ancient usages of the Orthodox community. They shrank back in horror from the developments in Germany, where the reformers had loudly and dramatically rejected the traditions of the past, and were equally unwilling to accept the considerably more moderate actions of the London reformers, if subscribing to those measures meant officially and openly rebelling against the Orthodoxy of the past. It was not the results of such a revolution which the progressives opposed, but the revolution itself. A corollary to their conviction that religious change could be obtained in an evolutionary way was the progressives' often expressed belief that the religious authori- ties, and more specifically the chief rabbi, had the power to make such alterations effective just by authorizing them. Through their absorption of the concepts of Gentile society, the progressives had come to look on the chief rabbi, not as a traditional rabbinic scholar with the power to interpret the law, but rather as an Anglican bishop, possessing the right to grant dis- pensations from the observances required by Halakhah. A straightforward statement of this frame of mind was made by the Voice ofJacob in 1846, when it wrote that "however necessary, and however salutary certain alterations may be, of such unauthorized alterations, we take the same view that a loyal Englishman would take.. . of the usurpation of a Cromwell ... it being not so much the acts which we condemned as the spirit of usurpation which had dictated them."88 Again in 1851 the Chronicle made the same point when it stated that "if the necessity of reform in our liturgical establishment is established, let a board be constituted, with a duly authorized ecclesiastic at their head . . . but a congregation on its own self- constituted authority, cannot be considered competent."89 The progressives' belief that the chief rabbi did, indeed, have the power to abolish various observances was severely criticized by a traditionalist scholar, Moshe Hassan, who visited London during these years. After mentioning demands for the rabbis to approve religious changes, Hassan concluded by telling his readers not to "fondly imagine that the election of one Chief Rabbi may 88.

I am bound to tell him that no Chief Rabbi is invested with such power."90 Support for only "duly authorized" reforms continued to be an impor- tant theme in the writings of the progressives throughout the period. In 1852 the Chronicle, after calling for changes it considered necessary, observed that its "opposition to unauthorized and reckless innovations is as firm and unflinching as at any period of our existence,"9' while in 1858 it called on the chief rabbi to approve a confirmation ceremony, writing that there were many in the community "who are yet willing to bow to ecclesiastical author- ity."'92 Moses Angel similarly called on Orthodoxy to "assume its legitimate function, and under the direction of recognized spiritual leaders, to purify the system of Judaism,"93 while in another passage he noted that many observances were regarded "as inalienable, because those who might act, decline to take the initiative, or to go further than their ancestors went."94 A second element in the thinking of the progressives, responsible for keeping them within the Orthodox fold, was also taken over by them from Gentile British attitudes. A dominant motif in the socioeconomic dynamics of Christianity in the Victorian community was the identification of the established and historically sanctioned Anglican church with the upper classes, while the dissenting movements were associated with the lower middle class and the poor. Social status was in a very real sense conferred by membership in the established church.95 It can easily be understood that the progressives, who wanted most eagerly to be accepted as English gentlemen, were motivated by that desire to conform to the Christian religious pattern follbwed by the social caste they aspired to join. The Reform congregation was perceived by them, using their acculturated frame of reference, as a dis- senters' chapel, and it certainly did not add to the social status and prestige 90. Moshe Israel Hassan, Words of Peace and Truth (London: Samuel Meldola, 1845), p. 10. The author, who identified himself as "dajan at Jerusalem now on a mission in London," ended by asking: "What authority has a Chief Rabbi of the present time to oppose the decision of the ancients?" 91.

Paradoxically the very acceptance by the progressives of the religious thinking of their Christian host society caused them to remain loyal to age-old Orthodoxy rather than to support the new Reform movement, which was closer to their own beliefs. It is quite clear that many in the Jewish community regarded the Orthodox-Reform split in these typically English terms. A good example of this trend of thought is provided by the discussion at the Board of Deputies over the Marriage and Registration Act passed by Parliament in 1856. This law empowered the Reform synagogue to appoint a secretary to register with the government marriages performed by that congregation's ministers. Prior to this act, the Orthodox board had refused to certify the Reform con- gregation to the authorities as a place of Jewish worship, with the right to perform weddings recognized by English law. The new act got around this difficulty by defining the reformers as an independent Jewish sect entitled to its own marriage secretary.96 During the board's consideration of this proposed measure, a number of speakers emphasized the point that even strict Orthodoxy could not oppose the new law, since it clearly defined the reformers as dissenters from the established Jewish faith. For example, one member declared that the act could be supported by the entire Orthodox community, since in the proposed law the reformers were being "inserted as dissenters from the synagogue,""97 while another observed that this was true because "the members of the Margaret-street congregation were now char- acterized as a distinct sect."98 The relationship of these speakers' ideas to those held by their Protestant compatriots is quite obvious here. The progressives' concept of Judaism must, thus, be understood as resulting from the strong influence exerted by the ideas of British society on the more acculturated circles of London Jewry. It was specifically due to this influence that the striking religious and ideological configuration of early Victorian Jewry was created. If an example is needed to prove the well- 96. According to British law, synagogue marriages were given full legal validity, without a secular ceremony being necessary, if the congregation involved had such an officially recog- nized secretary. The full story of this episode is found in Henry Straus Henriques, Jewish Mar- riage and the English Law (London: Bibliophile Press, 1909), pp. 34-37. 97. Jewish Chronicle, 22 June 1855. Another speaker at this meeting noted that the reformers "admitted themselves they were dissenters," and should, therefore, be granted a marriage secretary. 98.

The religious thinking and ideas of at least the Anglicized portion of early Vic- torian Jewry were quite clearly the products of the strong influence exerted by the early English Victorian world on the community.
