<plain_text><page sequence="1">PERCEPTION AND RECEPTION OF REPENTANT APOSTATES IN MEDIEVAL ASHKENAZ AND PREMODERN POLAND by EDWARD FRAM Converts to the faith have often been perceived as somewhat problematic by Judaism; apostates even more so.' This was especially true in medieval Christian Europe, where the adversarial relationship between Christianity and Judaism made apostasy, particularly apostasy by choice, more than mere defection; it cast aspersions on the rejected religion. Perceptions of those who left the faith were no different among Christians. Already in the early fifth century the Theodosian Code ruled that "it is graver than death and crueler than massacre when someone abjures the Christian faith and becomes polluted with the Jewish incredulity"2 The notion of This paper was originally presented in a much different form to the Columbia University Center for Israel and Jewish Studies Seminar. It has benefited from the wisdom of members of the seminar as well as the comments of Professors Gerald Blidstein, Elisheva Carlebach, and Haym Soloveitchik. The shortcomings that remain are obviously but a reflection of the author's own deficiencies. 1. Regarding converts, see, for example, the famous quip of Rabbi Helbo, B.T., Yebamot 47b, that converts are like a scab to Israel. The tanna Rabbi Isaac, for one, was willing to posit that apostates were the enemy referred to in Exodus 23:4, "If you meet your enemy's ox or donkey going astray, you must return it to him" (Mikilta' de-Rabbi Yishma "el, H. Horovitz and I. Rabin, eds., 2d ed. [Jerusalem: Bamberger &amp; Wahrman, 1960], Mishpatim 20, p. 324). 2.

To protect the faithful and punish the heretic, severe penalties, including loss of property, banishment, and death, were decreed against Christians who joined the Jewish faith as well as for "the instigators of the deed with their accomplices."3 The warning against leaving the Church applied not only to those born into the faith but also to Jews who had been splashed with the baptismal waters and later demurred and tried to return to Judaism. Catholics believed that baptism was ineffaceable. Over the centuries there were suggestions among Christian thinkers that Jews who had been baptized but secretly clung to various aspects of Judaism should not be considered Christians. Such an argument was advanced at the Second Council of Nicaea (787) but failed to receive papal approval from Adrian I (r. 772-795).4 From the perspective of Jewish jurists, the apostate's status as a Jew was somewhat dubious. Naturnai ben Hil'ai, head of the rabbinic academy at Sura, Babylonia (853-858), as well as a number of his successors, regarded the apostate as having left Judaism: "because he apostatized he has left the sanctity of Israel and the sanctity of his father"' Yet Naturnai limited the practical application of this ruling to matters of inheritance; with respect to personal status, Jewish law took a stringent position and continued to Church as an authoritative source of canon law (Linder, p. 33). Linder points out that "general prohibitions against conversion" of Christians to Judaism existed from the fourth century (p. 81). 3. Linder, pp. 258 and 261, nn. 7, 9. 4.

Rabbi Gershom ben Judah of Mainz (d. 1028) ordained, perhaps with unusual harshness and without apparent concern for the circumstances of the apostasy, that no one may insult a repentant Jew.7 Presumably R. Gershom wanted to encourage apostates to return to Judaism by limiting the potential shame that could be heaped upon them by unkind coreligionists, as well as to try and ensure that embarrassment would not cause a repenter to leaving the fold again. Jews must have insulted repentant apostates as a matter of course, otherwise there would have been no need for the ordinance or the apparent harshness of tone.8 It was left to Rabbi Solomon ben Isaac (d. 1105; known by the acronym Rashi) to refute in halakhic terms the commonly accepted notion that baptism indeed cut one off from the Jewish community. According to Jacob Katz, this was precisely the motivation behind Rashi's reinterpretation of the talmudic phrase "Israel, even though [it] has sinned, remains Israel" from a reference to the group to a reference to the individual Jew; "Israel [i.e., a Jew], even 6.

The "mey ha-shemad" referred to by Rashi in his responsum (see Teshubot hakmey Zarfat u-Lotir, Joel MUller, ed. [1881; reprint, Jerusalem: n.p., 1967], p. 11 b, no. 21), cited by Finkelstein and Grossman, may best be translated as "the waters of baptism." On such a meaning of the word shemad, see Eliezer Ben Yehuda, Millon ha-lashon ha-'ibrit, N. Tur-Sinai, ed. (New York: Thomas Yoseloff, 1959), s.v. shamad, second definition and the sources cited. 8. Also see Grossman, H.akmey Ashkenaz ha-ri' ohnim, p. 406. There were limits to R. Gershom's permissive attitude toward repentant apostates. While R. Gershom generally allowed repentant apostates to perform the priestly blessing in the synagogue, he would not allow a Jew who had apostatized of his own volition and become a Christian teacher (priest?) to bless the community. R. Eleazar ben Isaac, a younger contemporary, did not concur with R. Gershom's view. See Shlomo Eidelberg, "Teshubah lo' noda'at me-Rabbeynu Gershom me'or ha-golah," Talpiot 6.1-2 (March 1953): 153-155.</page><page sequence="4">302 EDWARD FRAM though [he/she] has sinned, remains Israel [a Jew]."9 Rashi's interpretation meant that despite behavior to the contrary, according to Jewish law the baptized Jew had never apostatized.'0 While Rashi's view flew in the face of the official Church doctrine that one who voluntarily accepted baptism could not escape it," his stand posed little threat to contemporary Franco-German Jewry.12 In practice the Church-with the notable exception of Visigothic Spain--generally did not aggressively seek to bring relapsed Jews back into the Christian fold.13 After the First Crusade, Rabbi Moses of Speyer was said to have sought permission for German Jews who had been forcibly baptized to return to Judaism. 9.

As Katz points out, from the Jewish perspective, Rashi's position left an ongoing burden of repentance on the Jew who had tried to leave the fold. 11. The tenet that baptism must be voluntary appeared already in the late fourth century in a law barring the acceptance into the Church of Jews who wished to convert to escape their debts or prosecution for crimes that they might have committed (Linder, Jews in Roman Imperial Legislation, pp. 199-200). In 416 the Church permitted converts who were lax in their observance of Christianity to return to Judaism if their conversions were known to have been motivated by something other than devotion to the Christian faith (Linder, pp. 275-276), but this was not repeated in Alaric II's Breviarium (promulgated 506), nor was it accepted by the Fourth Council of Toledo in 633, whose position was endorsed by Adrian I (see Jean Juster, "The Legal Condition of the Jews under the Visigothic Kings," translated and annotated by Alfredo M. Rabello, Israel Law Review 11 [July 1976]: 409-410, and Solomon Grayzel, The Church and the Jews in the XIIIth Century, vol. 1, 2d ed. [New York: Hermon, 1966], p. 15, n. 14). 12.

(Jerusalem: Zalman Shazar Center, 1992), p. 125, has argued that apostasy was one of the central legal issues of the eleventh and twelfth centuries for Franco-German Jewry. Also see Jacob Katz, Exclusiveness and Tolerance (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1961), pp. 68, 73. The scope of the problem is difficult, if not impossible, to gauge (see Katz, pp. 67-68). Clearly, apostasy/martyrdom was the significant legal problem for Jews during the Crusades. Prior to and after the Crusades, the matter is less certain. One does not get the impression from the sources that in the pre- and post-Crusade era in Franco-Germany apostasies ever reached the proportions that they did in England in the 1240s and 1250s where there were concerted efforts at converting the Jews and perhaps up to ten percent of the Jewish population of 3,000 apostatized (see Robert Stacey, "The Conversion of Jews to Christianity in Thirteenth Century England," Speculum 67, no. 2 [April 1992]: p 269). 13.

Consequently, rabbinic leaders continued to demonstrate an open view toward returning apostates during the course of the twelfth century regardless of whether the apostasy had occurred under duress or by the convert's free will." Rabbi Jacob ben Me'ir Tam (1100-1170), for example, made lenient overtures toward those who wanted to return to Judaism. In the case of a married woman who had apostatized and had sexual relations with a non-Jew, then returned to Judaism and was divorced by her husband, R. Jacob allowed her to marry the non-Jew with whom she had had adulterous relations and who had subsequently also embraced Judaism.'8 According to one tradition, Century, vol. 2, Kenneth Stow, ed.

According to one version, those who had been forcibly apostatized during the First Crusade had never acknowledged Christianity and had tried to observe the commandments to the best of their abilities while within the reach of the Church. For this the chronicler Solomon ben Simon deemed them praiseworthy and said that "he who speaks evil of them, it is as if he speaks [against] the Holy Presence" (Habermann, Sefer gezerot Ashkenaz u-Zarfat, p. 57). 18.

Returning to share in the fate of the minority religion in the Diaspora and reciting its creed twice daily were proof enough of complete repentance.'9 Despite some distrust and disrespect of the apostate, Franco-German Jewry, or at least its rabbinic spokesmen, generally approved of apostates returning to Judaism.20 In the twelfth century, Christians jurists expanded the definition of who was a Christian. While Calixtus II (r. 1119-1124) reaffirmed in his bull Sicut Judeis that no Jew should be converted by force, but that those who had been forcibly converted were not allowed to leave the faith.21 The outstanding Christian legalist of the century, John Gratian (fl. ca. 1140), whose Decretum became the standard reference manual of canon law in the Western Church, wrote, Those, however, who had already been compelled--as happened in the days of the very religious prince, Sisebut-inasmuch as by accepting the grace of baptism they had become associated with the divine sacraments ... it is only 19. See Urbach, Ba'aley ha-tosafot, p. 407, a citation of Rabbi Eleazar ben Judah of Worms's prescriptions by Rabbi Isaac ben Abraham. However, Yedidya Dinari, Hakmey Ashkenaz be-shalhey yemey ha-beynayim (Jerusalem: Mossad Bialik, 1984), p. 86, n. 74, has noted that in R. Eleazar of Worms's own writings there are long penances for the repentant apostate.

Eleazar, where some form of penance is expected of the returning apostate. 20.

Nevertheless, in at least one case, German communities made efforts to bring repentant apostates back into the community (see, for example, Hayyim ben Isaac, Sefer she 'elot u-teshubot moreynu ha-rab Hayyim or zaru'a [Leipzig, 1865], no. 103, a case of a voluntary apostate who was extricated from Christian society by the Jewish community and who was allowed to return to her husband). 21. For the text (with English translation), background to, and significance of Sicut Judeis, see Solomon Grayzel, "The Papal Bull Sicut Judeis," reprinted in Essential Papers on Judaism and Christianity in Conflict, Jeremy Cohen, ed. (New York: New York University Press, 1991), pp. 231-259. Grayzel suggests the possibility that Sicut Judeis was connected with the episodes of forced conversion of Jews during the First Crusade (pp. 233, 235-236).</page><page sequence="7">REPENTANT APOSTATES IN MEDIEVAL ASHKENAZ AND PREMODERN POLAND 305 proper that they be compelled to retain the faith they had accepted, whether by force or necessity, lest the name of the Lord be blasphemed and the faith they had assumed be considered vile and contemptible.22 In 1201 Innocent III expanded the meaning of "voluntary" baptism to include those who were "drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and received the sacrament of baptism in order to avoid loss." Such converts expressed what Innocent termed conditionaliter volens, "though, absolutely speaking, he [i.e., the convert] was unwilling" to convert (licet absolute non velit).23 "Short of dying when threatened with apostasy, there was little that a Jew could do to convince the Church of his unwillingness to be baptized. By the late twelfth or early thirteenth century, not only was the Church seeking to compel those who had been baptized to retain the Christian faith, but some communities in Germany, without any known papal pronouncement or established legal interpretations to support their actions, threatened to punish, or indeed did-or at least led the Jews to fear that they would---punish anyone who aided relapsed converts escape the Christian community. This led to a change in attitude among Jews, or at least among members of Hasidey Ashkenaz, a partially disenfranchised pietistic group within the Jewish community, with respect to how to deal with apostates, presumably willing apostates, who wanted to return to Judaism.24 22. Cited and translated in Grayzel, "Popes, Jews, and Inquisition," p. 7. Even churchmen could falter in observing Gratian's statute. When, on the day after his baptism in September 1189, the badly wounded Benedict of York stood before Richard I and was asked to identify himself, he responded, "Ego sum Benedictus Judaeus tuus de Eboraco." Incensed, the archbishop of Canterbury lashed back, "Ille Christianus esse non vult,(homo Diaboli sit," seemingly giving Benedict leave to return to Judaism. According to Roger of Howden, Benedict died soon thereafter. The Jewish community, however, would not accept his body for burial because he had apostatized. See Chronica Magistri Rogeri de Houedene, William Stubbs, ed., vol. 3 (1870; reprint, Wiesbaden: Kraus, 1964), pp. 12-13, as well as R. B.

The position was repeated by Nicholas III in 1277 and incorporated into canon law by the end of the century (see Solomon Grayzel, "The Confession of a Medieval Jewish Convert," Historia Judaica 17, no. 2 [October 1955] 92-93). 24. Concerning the place, or lack thereof, of Hasidey Ashkenaz in the German Jewish community of the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, see Haym Soloveitchik, "Three Themes in the Sefer Hiasidim," AJS Review 1 (1976): 336-338.</page><page sequence="8">306 EDWARD FRAM The pietistic author of section 200 of Sefer hasidim described the following case: And these [questions] were also [asked] of the [pietistic] sages: Someone apostatized and after some time inquired of the Jews, saying that he wanted to return to being a Jew but had very little money. [Since] the non-Jews trusted him, he would like to take [money] from them and afterwards flee with all the money to become a Jew. One [sage] said, "Since you want to repent, do not take [from them] and do not steal." A [second] sage said, "Since he only apostatized because he did not have the desires of his heart, it is better that he should take from the non-Jews and flee and not eat pork or profane the Sabbath. And if they catch him and kill him, his death will be a penance for all his sins." The third sage said, "Know that it is best that you do not instruct him and tell him what to do, because we will cause evil [since] he will immediately tell the non-Jews that the Jews advised him on this matter and it will be a danger [to the Jewish community], therefore do not speak to him." And so it happened. He told the non-Jews and they almost killed the Jews, [and the Jews] gave much money [i.e., fines, bribes] over this.25 Whether the story be true or hypothetical, the author was not against the notion of an apostate returning to Judaism; however, he did not want to become involved with an apostate whose actions might imperil the Jewish community, particularly one was thought to have ulterior motives. The very next passage in Sefer hasidim reinforced this idea. And if there is an apostate and it is known to the important people in the town and the sages in the town that he is willing to repent, but if he flees there will be a danger to the people [i.e., Jews] of the town because [the Christians] will say that the Jews caused him to flee, then he can fool the non-Jews and say that he wants to go on a pilgrimage [prt I]. And he should take upon him the cross until he leaves the place where people know him and [then] remove [the cross] and there will be no complaints against the Jews.26 25.

The hasid assumed that local Christians would not suspect that a convert leaving town carrying the cross on a pilgrimage had no intention of bearing the Christian faith to his destination. However, when the potential repenter represented a possible threat to the community, as in the former case, the hasid abjured any contact with him. Even advising him not to steal was too risky. It was better to have nothing to do with such a person.27 Despite the risks, subsequent generations of German Jewry continued to demonstrate a tolerant attitude toward repentant apostates, but the reception that they accorded them was influenced by the apostates' behavior. Although the vast majority of Jews in Frankfurt, more than 150 people (over 75 percent of the local Jewish population), died martyrs' deaths in the wake of the May 1241 persecutions, a number of girls (one said to have been less than twelve years old) were possibly raped and then forcibly converted.28 These girls refused to accept life as Christians and made numerous unsuccessful attempts to flee, both on their own and with the help of Christians, before finally escaping with the aid of the Jewish community.29 Although the girls had failed to die a martyr's death when forcibly converted, they redeemed themselves in the eyes of contemporary Jews through their defiant commitment to Judaism in the face of great pressure from their Christian captors. A number of contemporary rabbis even viewed the girls as something of heroines. Rabbi Isaac ben Moses of Vienna (ca. 1180-ca. 1250) wrote regarding them, 27. While the apostate remained in the Christian community, the .hasid called on Jews to insult him (Sefer hasidim, no. 192), although the hasid did allow Jews to pray that God would lighten the punishment of an apostate who did good things for Jews (no. 1571). The hasid was not just reticent about helping apostates who physically endangered the Jewish community; spiritual danger was also a concern (no. 183). 28. The attack was ostensibly the result of local Jews not allowing a boy to apostatize (see I. Kracauer, Geschichte der Juden in Frankfurt a.M., vol 1 [Frankfurt: I. Kauffmann, 1925], p. 7). On the number of martyrs and the size of the community, see Germania Judaica, Zvi Avneri, ed., vol. 2.1 (Ttibingen: J. C. B. Mohr [Paul Siebeck], 1968), p. 239 and the sources cited in n. 6. 29.

R. Asher viewed married women who had apostatized to save their lives and later repented and returned to the Jewish community as nothing less than deserters. They had not only abandoned their God but had compounded their treachery by doing so publicly.31 The women's subsequent escape from the Christian community was not a public declaration of Jewish faith comparable to martyrdom, or even to the efforts of the girls of Frankfurt in 1241, that it might atone for their offense. Nevertheless, R. Asher, like almost all other Ashkenazic authorities, was willing to accept such women back into the community and allow them to return to their husbands.32 While German Jewry may not have renounced contact with repentant apostates, it continued to be cautious in dealing with them. One of the students of the pietist Rabbi Judah he-hasid, R. Isaac ben Moses of Vienna, was asked to decide a dispute concerning a woman who had converted to Judaism and served as a handmaid for a certain Jew.33 At some point, her Jewish owner suspected her of stealing from him and, likely sensing his 30.

Judah ben Moses of Friedberg, R. Meshulam ben David, and R. David ben Sha'alti'el in Hayyim ben Isaac, Responsa, nos. 103, 221. Blidstein, "Ma'amadan ha-ishi shel nashim shebuyot," p. 92, correctly notes, however, that R. Isaac's acclaim of the girls did not match his praise of the martyrs. 31. Asher ben Yehi'el, She'elot u-teshubot ha-R 'osh (1881; reprint, n.p., n.d.), no. 32.8, wrote, "it is true that they did something terrible and they must be remorseful and repent and accept sufferings more than those who apostatized in peaceful times because they apostatized in public." 32. See Blidstein, "Ma'amadan ha-ishi shel nashim shebuyot," pp. 98-99, regarding the general trend to allow these women to return to their husbands. If, however, the women lingered in the Christian community when they had the opportunity to escape, rabbis were quite willing to prohibit them from returning to their conjugal relationships. See the opinion of Rabbi Abraham Katz cited in Jacob Mollin, She 'elot u-teshubot Maharil, Yitzchok Satz, ed. (Jerusalem: Machon Yerushalayim, 1979), no. 72, p. 92 and the sources cited in n. 35. 33.

Whether he feared for his own life if he were to be caught harboring a lapsed Christian, or whether the community prevented him from keeping her because it feared the ramifications, remains unclear.34 The owner sent her off (according to the other litigant, she fled of her own accord without ever returning to the owner) to the Hungarian village of Irek, where she was unknown and could hide more easily.35 All including R. Isaac, assumed that if she had been caught she would have been killed. The ineffaceable nature of baptism in canon law meant that from the Church's perspective a forcibly converted Jew could not legally return to Judaism. Canon law called for the punishment not only of relapsed converts but of those who assisted them. This was made explicit in the papal bull Turbato corde issued by Clement IV on July 27, 1267 which equated relapse into Judaism with heresy and called for appropriate legal proceedings against Christians whom you shall have discovered to have committed such things [i.e., joined the Jewish faith] in the same ways as against heretics; Jews, however, whom you shall have discovered inducing Christians of either sex into their execrable rite, before this, or in the future, these you are to punish with due penalty, curbing by ecclesiastical censure those who contradict this, appeal being denied, and the help of the secular arm, if need be, invoked for this purpose.36 The few born-Christians who converted to Judaism in the thirteenth century were likely only a secondary concern of Turbato corde; its primary discussion, R. Isaac cites Pesiqta' rabbati 22, "do not trust a convert until the twenty-second generation," and adds of his own accord, "and all the more so a convert who has apostatized." 34.

Relapsed converts and those who aided them fell under the jurisdiction of the courts of the Inquisition as well as the state.39 Accordingly, the influential legal code of southern Germany, the Schwabenspiegel (ca. 1275), followed the papacy's lead and authorized secular powers to join with ecclesiastical authorities in uprooting the perceived scourge of relapsed converts.40 Yet the Inquisition was never able to establish itself as a significant force in German society, where many people did not view heresy as an urgent problem.41 Thus, for the most part, the threats of canon law remained precisely that, threats. In southwestern Europe, however, where 37. See Joseph Shatzmiller, "L'inquisition et les juifs de Provence au XIIIe s.," Provence Historique 93-94 (1973): 328.

The Third Lateran Council (March 1179) approved the use of secular power against heretics. Innocent III went further by threatening nobles who did not help in the battle against heresy with excommunication and interdictions. Previously there was little occasion for the collaboration of church and state against religious dissenters, since there was no consensus on how to deal with such people.

Henry C. Lea, in his classic A History of the Inquisition of the Middle Ages (1888; reprint, New York: Russell and Russell, 1955), argued that local German authorities opposed the Inquisition on political grounds and therefore prevented it from establishing itself (vol. 1, p. 332; vol. 2, p. 388). When Charles IV finally supported the Inquisition in 1369, its activities were aimed at beghards and beguines but even these limited efforts elicited local opposition (vol. 2, pp . 393-395). Richard Kieckhefer, Repression of Heresy in Medieval Germany (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1979), challenged Lea's contentions and suggested that the reason for the Inquisition's weakness in Germany lay in its own institutional structure. Inquisitors lacked the institutional mechanisms for interregional cooperation and, unlike their</page><page sequence="13">REPENTANT APOSTATES IN MEDIEVAL ASHKENAZ AND PREMODERN POLAND 311 the fear of heresy provoked a strong and effective response by inquisitors, relapsed converts faced the specter of punishment and, in addition, endanger, those who harbored them. Yet not only did apostates in the region continue to return to Judaism, they were often encouraged to do so by local Jews. In 1284 Abraham de Grasse and his wife Rosa, of Manosque, Provence, were accused and later charged by the Inquisition with encouraging, aiding, and harboring Rosa's daughter, who had been a Christian for more than five years, in her return to Judaism.42 In southern Italy in early 1290, where Jews had the support of the Angevin king, Charles II, a Jew was "merely" fined for bringing a relapsed apostate back into the fold, although without doubt the Inquisition would have liked to impose a harsher punishment.43 To the northwest, in Aragon, there were a small number of Jews in 1307 and 1308 who had apostatized in the midst of the expulsion of Jews from France and wanted to return to Judaism.44 These French Jews, who had apostatized when faced with expulsion, not death, and were therefore considered by Jewish law to be voluntary apostates, had come to Aragon specifically to return to Judaism. They were able to locate members of the local Jewish populace who, in many cases, would not only harbor them but help them undergo a process of both "dechristianization" and "rejudaization." Although such rituals were not required by Jewish law, they were popular attempts to remove the stain of baptism from the Jewish body and soul and restore the apostate to religious purity.45 However, these efforts put the local Jews counterparts in southern Europe, inquisitors in Germany were appointed over regions too large to administer effectively (p. 26). 42.

Nevertheless, Jewish communities continued to grant apostates sanctuary.47 By 1311 the Inquisition in Aragon had begun an investigation of the efforts being extended by Jews to relapsi.48 Just four years later, the atmosphere was so tense that rumors that the Jews of Majorca were assisting the return of apostates return to Judaism were enough to endanger the community.49 The efforts of Jews in Aragon to help apostates return to Judaism endured despite threats and interdictions. In 1320 and 1321, many Jews who had converted to Christianity during the Pastoureoux uprising entered Aragon and openly returned to Judaism, some with the support of local Jews.5o In 1326 (ulema de Quatorze of Calatayud and his son were condemned for encouraging and helping forced converts from France to abandon Christianity and return to Judaism. Their efforts were not unusual. Local Jews encouraged apostates to return to Judaism, apparently willing to suffer the harassment of the Inquisition as well as possible condemnation.5 The Inquisition did not carefully single out fautors and relapsed converts for punishment but exploited its jurisdiction over relapsi and those who harbored them to harass entire Jewish communities.52 Ultimately, the wrath of the Inquisition contributed to the pauperization and even ruin of the important Jewish center in Saragossa.53 Nevertheless, more than a century later, in the 1460s, Jewish communities in Aragon continued to provide refuge for conversos fleeing Castile in order return to Judaism. The leaders of the Jewish communities in Huesca who had accepted such conversos back Christian community.

The repentant apostate who came to the German pietist clearly faced risks in leaving Christianity but could reduce the danger to himself and others by fleeing to another region, an option that the pietist exploited. It is unclear that the Jews of Aragon had such options. The relapsi had already fled the region where they had lived as Christians and now looked to Jews in their new surroundings to help them. Certainly they could not be sent off to Germany, which during the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries was hardly a haven for any Jew, let alone returning apostates. In the wake of the Rindfleish persecutions, Jews were fleeing the German lands for the relative safety of Spain and Italy. Jews in Aragon were faced with a challenge that they could not escape: endanger themselves by helping apostates, many of whom had been forcibly baptized and now were willing to put themselves in grave danger by returning to Judaism, or leave them to a life of sin as Christians. Apostates could not return to Jewish life without a Jewish community. Aragonese Jewry often choose to help such apostates even in the face of the Inquisition. The German pietists did not have to face the fallout from large-scale conversions, whether forced or voluntary, and so were not compelled to confront the problem. Historical events did not challenge their belief that the welfare of the Jewish community outweighed the spiritual welfare of individual apostates. The Jews of Aragon did not have this luxury. Despite the concerns of the German pietists and the ruling of the Schwabenspiegel, there were Jewish apostates in thirteenth-century Germany who returned to the Jewish community. In some cases, however, their contrition was dubious at best and they drifted back and forth between the Jewish and Christian communities. In the second half of the thirteenth century, Rabbi Me'ir ben Baruch of Rothenburg complained that some "empty people" (t',in), who had even undergone ritual immersion as part of the rites of "rejudaizing," went from town to town, sometimes appearing as Jews and in other instances as Christians. R. Me'ir, for one, did not accept them as 54.

The phenomenon was not unknown in neighboring France. Rabbi Solomon ben Abraham Adret (ca. 1235-ca. 1310) reported that his teacher, Rabbi Jonah ben Abraham Gerondi (ca. 1200-ca. 1263), who in his youth had studied in France, had conveyed to him a ruling that he had heard from French scholars concerning Jews who wandered from town to town, posing as Christians to Christians and as Jews when entering the homes of Jews.56 Nor did the problem of such vagrants end with the thirteenth century. Rabbi Israel Isserlein (1390-1460), who served as rabbi in Marburg and later in Wiener Neustadt, also complained of derelicts (tn~pi) who sometimes returned to Judaism with less than complete contrition.57 In 1475 such an apostate was caught stealing by the authorities in Regensburg. The Jew Isaac, then Reichart of Mospach, told his interrogators how he had wandered from place to place, feigning to be a Jew here and a Christian there, having accepted baptism--and in at least one instance in Holland, the vil gulden that went with it--three times. He admitted to having married several women in different places and to stealing from Christian and Jew alike. Of greater significance to the Jewish community, he also had accused Jews from Krautheim and Bamberg of having bought and extracted blood from the host.58 Little wonder that such people were 55.

Me'ir of Rothenburg's responsum appears in Mordecai ben Hillel, Ketubbot 306. The text seems to indicate that R. Me'ir thought that these people would steal and fulfill their base desires while feigning to be Jews. A late-fourteenth-century Jewish vagrant in France did exactly that, exploiting hospitality to steal from his Jewish hosts (see Esther Cohen, "Posh'im Yehudim be-Zarfat be-shalhey ha-me'ah ha-14," Zion 46, no. 2 [1981]: 151-152). 56.

In Isserlein's case the "waffling" apostate seems to have tried to avoid Jews who might have recognized him, running from a town when he found out that people who knew him were coming.

Me'ir of Rothenburg's student and the out- standing jurist of his age, R. Asher ben Yehi'el. R. Asher was asked regarding a dispute concerning the inheritance of a man, his father, and his grandfather, who had been murdered together. In the course of accusations regarding who had been killed first, the defendant's guardian rejected the plaintiff's use of repentant apostates as witnesses to testify about what they had seen while they were apostates. The defense charged that "we have not seen sufficient ['m '9mi] repentance from them that they should be allowed to testify." With no objective criteria on exactly how much repentance was necessary, the defense attempted to exploit lingering doubts about returning apostates to their advantage. That someone trying to hold on to assets would grasp for a plausible argument to disqualify opposing evidence is to be expected; that R. Asher too entertained doubts about returning apostates is much more revealing about just how they were viewed by the Jewish community. While R. Asher offered a concerted legal effort to extend the parameters for accepting testimony from returning apostates, he closed his legal argument with a note of wariness. However, it is necessary to be very careful with testimony intended to transfer money from one party to another because there are many forced apostates who, even before the decrees [that resulted in their apostasy] were suspect. And moreover, inheritances cause them to change their minds and the mind of their Creator [i.e., to sin] in monetary matters [i.e., they believed that they could profit personally from their testimony], and it is enough that they [the rabbis] were lenient about accepting their testimony [i.e., that of returned apostates] by R. Po-chia Hsia, The Myth of Ritual Murder (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988), p. 70. 59. The Jewish element among the vagrant population was not insignificant. It influenced the language of the vagrants and thieves both in Germany (Rotwelsch) and France (see the fifteenth-century Liber Vagatorum [Strasbourg, 1858], glossary, pp. 55-57; my thanks to Professor Esther Cohen for bringing the work to my attention).</page><page sequence="18">316 EDWARD FRAM with respect to abandoned wives, but with regard to transferring money one must check and one must investigate.60 R. Asher, who had led German Jewry before fleeing to Spain in 1303 in his mid-fifties, was not alone in believing that many of those who apostatized, even under coercion, were of dubious integrity.61 An unknown questioner addressing Rabbi Yedidyah ben Samuel of Nuremberg (d. early 14 cent.) rejected the notion of accepting testimony in a monetary matter from people who had failed to die a martyr's death, something that even "derelicts [04p4'] among us" do. "And also the world considers them [i.e., those who apostatized instead of being martyred and who later returned to the community] to be awful and they do not marry them or their relatives, [even] more so than other sinners."62 Ashkenazic Jewry viewed these people as traitors, a stain that tainted even innocent relatives. Given the doubts about the integrity of apostates, it is unclear whether the Jews of fifteenth-century Germany actively sought to persuade apostates to return to Judaism. Even if they did not, there is nothing to suggest that they discouraged those who wanted to return. Like others before him, Rabbi Jacob Mollin (ca. 1360-1427; Austria) believed that sexual desire sometimes led apostates to embrace Christianity without accepting its religious tenets. Mollin believed that those who had apostatized for such reasons would 60. Asher ben Yehi'el, Responsa, no. 54.1. The final phrase, "p~ lly7' ," is a double entendre. Not only does the case require investigation, but the legal permissibility of accepting their testimony in this regard does as well. 61. R. Asher was willing to accept the testimony of repentant apostates with respect to whether women could remarry (i.e., were their husbands dead). Concluding a responsum R. Asher noted, "and his testimony appears to me to be valid because he repented. And so we did in Germany at the time of the decrees (nnmTa n mvn), we allowed women [to remarry] based on the testimony of those who repented and I wrote a lengthy responsum on this" (no. 54.5). As for the lengthy responsum, like many of R. Asher's responsa written in Germany, it has, to the best of my knowledge, yet to be located (see Israel Ta-Shema, "Rabbenu Asher u-beno R. Ya'aqob ba'al ha-Turim: beyn Ashkenaz le-Sefarad," Pe'amim 46-47 [Spring 1991]: 80-82, 88). 62. Teshubot ba'aley ha-tosafot, Irving Agus, ed. (New York: Talpioth, 1954), p. 238, a source kindly brought to my attention by Professor Blidstein. There is no doubt that these observations were made in the course of a prejudiced response. If the testimony under question was disqualified, the money at issue would be used to redeem children taken by the Christians and forcibly converted. However, R. Yedidyah's social comments, even if somewhat exaggerated, remain indicative of common perceptions.</page><page sequence="19">REPENTANT APOSTATES IN MEDIEVAL ASHKENAZ AND PREMODERN POLAND 317 indubitably return to Judaism when they had the opportunity, apparently with his blessing.63 After the Edict of Vienna (1420-1421), some Jews who had been forcibly apostatized immediately returned to Judaism, encountering no official op- position from the Jewish community.64 Perhaps like Jewish communities in Aragon, it felt obliged to help forced apostates to return; perhaps, more importantly, the Church had given the forced converts its tacit permission to return to Judaism. Thus there was less danger for the Jewish community in accepting.65 That the Church allowed forced converts to return to Judaism did not mean that it would not punish relapsi if they fell into Christian hands. In a responsum Isserlein related the following case that took place sometime after 1421. A group of men and women and many souls went from one town to another to celebrate a wedding, and they passed through the town of a wicked ruler, all of whose servants were wicked. And they falsely accused the Jews in order to condemn them to death and murder [them]. And they captured all [the Jews], and the burghers divided [and held] them in their homes throughout the city, each man and each woman alone. And they tortured them with severe holds and other tortures and also always tempted them; everything in order that they might convert and then they would release their bodies and money. And they 63. Jacob Mollin, Responsa, no. 100, pp. 192-193. Mollin believed that since some of these apostates were "merciful" (i.e., essentially good husbands), it may have been better for a Jewish woman to have remained married to such an apostate in the hope that he might return than be divorced and free of him. 64. See Isserlein, Terumat ha-deshen, Responsa, no. 241. Also Mollin, Responsa, no. 72, pp. 89-104. Even R. Asher had found the pious who had been forcibly converted and who returned as soon as possible quite acceptable (Asher ben Yehi'el, Responsa, no. 54.1). 65. On the Edict of Vienna in general, see Samuel Krauss, Die Wiener Geserah vom Jahre 1421 (Vienna: Wilhelm Braumuller, 1920). Krauss asserts that Martin V's bull, "Licet Judaeorum omnium" issued on December 23, 1420, which threatened to excommunicate anyone baptizing Jewish children under the age of twelve against their parents' wishes, was issued to the Jews of Austria and the Venetian territories in response to the Edict of Vienna (p. 107). R. Jacob Mollin certainly believed that the papal response was aimed at head of the Viennese community (Responsa, p. 102, no. 72). One is left with the impression that Krauss believed that Martin V would have allowed all forced converts to return to Judaism dejure but, bound by Christian theology, could not do so, so the Church simply turned a blind eye. The dating of "Licet Judaeorum," however, remains problematic. See Vernet, "Le Pape Martin V," p. 422, no. 81.</page><page sequence="20">318 EDWARD FRAM remained held for some time, husband and wife. And it happened that after they had been tortured for some time, a minority of the men apostatized, as well as some of the women, some with their husbands and some without. And another minority escaped from being held [while remaining] Jews. And all those who apostatized returned to the true religion [i.e., Judaism] except that some of them delayed fleeing, among them women who had already apostatized once before and had [previously] returned to the true religion. And this was told [to their captors], and the Christians who had captured them recognized them and added an accusation against these women because of this. And the majority [of those captured] withstood the test and were killed, sanctifying God's name, may He be praised.66 In his responsum, Isserlein tacitly acknowledged that repentant apostates could have been indicted by the Christians for relapsing back into Judaism; that they were not was due to a legal technicality.67 The other Jews being held were not accused of harboring relapsi in their midst. In a period when apprehensions about heresy were declining in Germany, as were activities against it, fifteenth-century Ashkenazic halakhic literature evidenced no hint of concern that the fautors of relapsi might be punished.68 When asked whether a repenter could be shaved on the intermediate days of the festival in preparation for his ritual immersion, Isserlein permitted the shaving and urged that the immersion take place as soon as possible so that the repenter could begin to fulfill all the commandments.69 Surely, if there had been a danger to the Jewish community, Isserlein would have moved to prohibit a folk custom instead of trying to find a biblical source for it. As an ideal, Isserlein himself followed in the tradition of lenience in penances for apostates, afraid that too arduous a penance would prevent the return of an individual whose very nature he believed to be evil [Yi r1o] and who 66. Isserlein, Responsa, no. 241, was asked about the permissibility of these women to their husbands. 67. Isserlein believed that the women could not be charged because they had originally been detained on other pretenses. Whether Isserlein's assumption was correct or not remains unclear. 68. On the decline of heresy in fifteenth-century Germany, see Kieckhefer, Repression of Heresy, p. 83. 69. Isserlein, Responsa, no. 86, notes that while according to the letter of the law the repenter could fully participate in Jewish life without immersion, the "custom of our fathers" demanded ritual immersion before a male repenter could be included in a quorum or any "holy matter."</page><page sequence="21">REPENTANT APOSTATES IN MEDIEVAL ASHKENAZ AND PREMODERN POLAND 319 was used to doing "as his heart desired" among the Christians. Leaving the security and pleasures of the Christian world for life among the Jews was punishment enough.70 If Isserlein, like R. Gershom of Mainz, Rashi, and R. Jacob Tam before him, indeed favored encouraging apostates to return to the Jewish community by making their "rejudaization" easier, his approach did not leave an indelible impression on the spiritual heirs of medieval Germany, the Jewish community in Poland. Historically Poland had been quite tolerant of Jews, and the privileges extended to Polish Jewry by monarchs during the Middle Ages generally protected Jews from forced conversions.71 Over the course of the mainly peaceful sixteenth and most of the first half of the seventeenth century, there were relatively few apostates in Poland.72 Those who did apostatize usually became Catholics,73 some for personal gain, others to escape punishment at the hands of Jewish or state authorities, and still others undoubtedly for altruistic reasons.74 In one of Lublin's major churches, The Archangel Saint Michael, the almost 3,500 pages of baptismal records spanning the years 70.

(Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1986), pp. 64-65.

In the second half of the seventeenth century, a number of condemned Jewish criminals who withstood the temptation to convert were considered martyrs by the Jewish community (see Chone Shmeruk, "Ha-qadosh R. Shakna', Qera'qa' 1682-rishum be-pinqas shel ha-hebrah qaddisha' le-'umat 'Shir histori,"' Gal-Ed 7-8 [1985]: 63 and the source cited in n. 15). 75.

There were sixty-nine Jewish homes in the Jewish suburb of Lublin in 1570, which, according to Bella Mandelsberg-Schildkraut, Mehqarim le-toledot Yehudey Lublin (Tel Aviv: Circle of Friends of the Late Bella Mandelsberg-Schildkraut, 1965), p. 66, represented about 1,035 Jews.

Joel Sirkes, Bayit hadash (Cracow, 1635), Yoreh de'ah 268, wrote that "everyone now knows that most apostates convert only so that their appetites may be satiated, to allow them to steal, to have illicit sexual relationships, and to eat forbidden foods in public without having the rabbinic court of the Jews chastise them for it" (also see 340 [end]). Sirkes's view was not surprising considering that he believed that it was the "way of most apostates that all their actions are to trouble and irritate" the Jewish community (She'elot u-teshubot ha-bayit</page><page sequence="23">REPENTANT APOSTATES IN MEDIEVAL ASHKENAZ AND PREMODERN POLAND 321 When apostasy did take place, it did not always cut off familial feelings and ties, and efforts to entice the apostate back were not unknown.80 Rabbi Solomon Luria (d. 1574) noted that in his youth a father (or perhaps other relative) came to the local rabbinic authorities asking that the court obtain a bill of divorce from the husband of his apostatized daughter in the hope that, if freed from her husband, she might return to Judaism. The community was sympathetic to the father's efforts and, to the best of Luria's recollection, forced the husband to give the bill of divorce.8' Yet even if the family succeeded in persuading the Jewess to return to her old faith, it is unclear that she could have remained in Poland. Jews believed that it was both physically and spiritually dangerous for repentant apostates to stay in Poland, and so they encouraged them to leave for the Ottoman Empire, where they could abandon Christianity and openly return to Judaism.82 The Jewish printer Samuel Halicz of Cracow, for example, converted to Catholicism together with his two brothers in 1537. As an apostate, Paul Halicz published a number of works, including a Judeo-German translation of the New Testament (1541), intended to entice more Jews to the baptismal font; by mid-century, Samuel Halicz was a repentant Jew openly practicing Judaism in Constantinople, where he printed Hebrew books.83 Halicz's flight to the Ottoman Empire was hardly unique. According to a sixteenth-century German apostate, Victor von Karben, the hadash [Frankfurt, 1697], no. 102). Sirkes's contention that apostates were seeking physical pleasures reflects a much earlier tradition (see Luria, Yam shel Shelomoh, Yebamot [Altona, 1740], chap. 1, no. 6) as well as Judah Rosenthal, "Marcin Czechowic and Jacob of Belyce Arian-Jewish Encounters in 16th Century Poland," Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research 34 [1966]: 87. 80. Even the German pietist was faced with parents who wanted to bribe their apostate son to return to the Jewish community (Sefer hasidim, no. 183). 81. Luria, Yam shel Shelomoh, Yebamot, chap.1, no. 6. 82. According to a number of Muslim legalists, dimmTs could only convert from Christianity or Judaism to Islam.

Writing about life in the immediate aftermath of the destruction, Hanover said, In those days, the king, may his glory increase, issued an ordinance throughout the states of his kingdom that whomever had been forced to change his faith might return to his former faith. And all the forced apostates returned to Judaism, and they lived in all the cities where they had been apostatized, and they publicly became Jews in all [those] places where Jews lived. And in the places where the Cossacks resided, where Jews did not live at that time according to the decree of the king upon them, the forced apostates fled from there. And the [Jewish] women whom the Cossacks married [by force] also fled to the cities where Jews lived. And a few hundred forced apostates became Jews [again].85 That king Jan Kazimierz assented to the petition of the Jewish community and decreed that Jews "forced into the Ruthenian faith, partly through various torments and partly out of fear for their well-being," must be allowed to return to Judaism can only mean that he accepted the premise that converts required royal protection to safeguard their rejoining the Jewish community.86 In describing his travels through Turkey in 1553-55, Hans Dernschwamm, an agent of the Fugger bank, reported meeting Samuel from Cracow, who, he said, had left Poland for the Ottoman Empire after converting to Judaism (cited in Mateusz Mieses, "Judaizanci we wschodniej Europie," Miesiqcznik 2ydowski 4 [1934]: 157, 254). Dernschwamm described Samuel as an apprentice, but, given the small number of converts, one wonders whether the convert he met was none other than Samuel Halicz. 84.

While rabbis lamented this course of action, there is nothing to suggest that such Jews were not received back into the community as anything less than full members.87 Rabbi Menahem Mendel Krochmal (d. 1661), a Cracow native who studied and taught in Polish talmudic academies before becoming rabbi of Mikulov (Nikolsburg) and other towns in Moravia, was anxious for apostate Jews to return to Judaism in the wake of 1648-49. Writing in late December 1649, Krochmal refused to allow a man whose wife was rumored to have been forcibly converted in 1648 to give a bill of divorce to an agent of the court (that would have accepted it on the woman's behalf). Krochmal believed that if the woman had apostatized, she would return to Jewish life as soon as the danger had passed, and that she would be accepted back by her husband and community.88 If, however, she or any other forced apostate, failed to flee when given the opportunity, she would be considered a willing 1648: Their Massacre and Loyalty Oath to the Cossacks," Harvard Ukrainian Studies 8, nos. 3-4 (December 1984): 394-395. The king's pronouncement must have emboldened Jews, for Hanover continued, "And in all the places where killings took place there remained a few hundred young children and babies who had [been] apostatized. And the Jews took them back by force from the hands of the Gentiles" (p. 10b). 87. Jacob Katz, "Beyn TaTN"U le-Ta"H-Ta"T," reprinted in his Halakah ve-qabbalah, pp. 313-317, 326, argued that there was no expectation of martyrdom in 1648 and therefore no disappointment when Jews failed to die a martyr's death. See, however, Joseph of Zaslaw, Sefer rekeb Eliyyahu (Cracow, 1638), p. 14b, who maintained the demand for martyrdom and wrote "and when the evil inclination rises up one should think that if it was a time of religious persecution he would be killed on a small matter of observance, even on changing a shoe strap" (see B.T., Sanhedrin 74a-b). Also see the implied dissatisfaction of R. Hanoch the Preacher with Jews who converted rather than died during the Swedish invasions in Great Poland in 1656 (in She 'elot u-teshubot harerey qedem, I. Herskovitz, ed. [Brooklyn: n.p., 1988], no. 95, pp. 407-408). 88. Menahem Mendel Krochmal, She 'elot u-teshubot zemah zedeq (Amsterdam, 1675), no. 70. Soon after writing his responsum Krochmal was informed that the woman was alive and well, had indeed never apostatized, had been held as a prisoner, redeemed in Constantinople, and had returned to Lublin from where she made contact with her husband and joyously rejoined him.</page><page sequence="26">324 EDWARD FRAM apostate.89 The halakhah takes no notice of any circumstances in this matter beyond physical duress.90 In the wake of the catastrophe there was great confusion regarding both marital status and inheritances. Who had been killed first in the massacres, the husband or the wife?91 Among the few available witnesses who had survived the carnage and could testify to such matters were Jews who had apostatized and then returned to Judaism. Litigants quickly accepted former apostates back into the fold, at least when it was in their own interests to do so.92 Yet not all contemporary rabbinic authorities were ready to let such people simply return to the community. Rabbi Hanoch the Preacher, who during his career served as head of rabbinic courts in a number of Polish communities, wrote in 1656, during the Swedish invasions of Poland, "when the killing was great, because of our numerous sins, in the land of Great Poland," that duress was no excuse for failing to die a martyr's death.93 The very nature of martyrdom demanded that one give up one's life under duress. Those who failed to do so violated two biblical precepts: "And you will not profane My Holy Name," and, "and I will be sanctified among the children of Israel" (Lev. 22:32). R. Hanoch would only accept back those who had apostatized under duress when they underwent penances for violating these commandments. 89. According to one mid-fifteenth-century German halakhist, if a child was forcibly converted but failed to repent when it reached the age of legal majority, his status changed to that of a willing apostate. See Shelomoh Spitzer, "Teshubah me'et Rabbeynu Natan Igra' be-din meshumad im yoresh et abiyv," Moriah 7, no. 1 (Fall 1977): 6. 90. See Isserles, Shulhan 'aruk, Yoreh de'ah 157.1. Also see the comments of Yosef Yerushalmi, From Spanish Court to Italian Ghetto (New York: Columbia University Press, 1971), p. 28. 91. If, for example, the husband had been murdered first, then the wife's father would inherit her instead of the husband's family. 92. The question of whether a repentant apostate could give testimony on events seen while an apostate was addressed by Moses Isserles, Shulhan 'aruk, Eben ha-'ezer 17.6, with respect to testimony that might allow a woman, the fate of whose husband was unknown, to remarry. In his supercommentary on this passage, David ben Samuel ha-Levi expanded Isserles's phrase "m =2x n itV in" (David ben Samuel cites Isserles's phrase as "n'rar nr ayinv in") beyond its original intent (see also Asher ben Yehi'el, Responsa, no. 54.1) to allow forced apostates who returned to Judaism to testify not only about what they had seen at the time of their apostasy when they were under duress but also during their apostasy (Turey zahab, n. 4). 93.

While Polish Jewry may have been willing to accept back those who had been converted by force during the Chmielnicki uprising and the Swedish invasions, the attitude toward apostates who apostatized of their own volition in more peaceful times was markedly different. In the mid-seventeenth century, in a fit of anger, an unnamed Ruthenian Jew vowed to convert to Christianity (perhaps Greek Orthodoxy). In preparation for his apostasy, and unbeknown to the Jewish community, he stayed with local priests for a few weeks. He later maintained, however, that he had changed his mind and had fled without apostatizing, fearing that if he were caught by the Christians he would face death by torture, an assumption accepted by the author of a responsum dealing with his legal status, Rabbi Samson Bachrach (d. 1670).94 Seeking a way to repent, the Jew claimed to have sought the advice of a rabbi "in another land," who gave him a few penances that he carried with him. A long time thereafter, the Jew began to wander, eventually arriving in Worms, probably in 1647. The Jew in question was not an ignoramus. He was familiar with the Hebrew liturgy and an expert Torah reader. In a poor community like Worms that could neither afford the expense of bringing a cantor from afar nor offer an attractive salary, these skills, together with a pleasant voice, soon brought the Ruthenian Jew, who closely guarded the secrets of his past, the job of cantor. A few days after they appointed the new cantor, the community in Worms found out about his past; they could hardly contain their outrage. Arguing that according to the halakhah, thinking of idol worship is tantamount to idol worship, the townspeople charged the Ruthenian Jew with committing a severe sin. They accused him of eating non-kosher and disgusting foods, profaning the Sabbath, and other such things while living with the priests. Aghast, they summarily fired him. Bachrach, who would serve as rabbi of Worms from 1650 until his death, was asked to consider the matter. Admittedly struggling to find a single compelling legal argument to allow the penitent to serve as permanent cantor, Bachrach mustered a litany of reasons to accept the man back. By his own admission, Bachrach was following the lead of R. Gershom ben Judah of Mainz, whom he understood to have ruled that one should 94. Sefer hut ha-shani, Ya'ir Bachrach, ed. (Frankfurt, 1679), no. 75.</page><page sequence="28">326 EDWARD FRAM always try to justify a repentant Jew's previous actions. Bachrach interpreted this as a general directive to accept repentant Jews, including apostates, back into the fold and not to reject them out of hand, as he claimed some unnamed people did.95 So strongly did Bachrach believe in the principle of accepting back repentant sinners that he reinterpreted the verse "All the sins that he committed will not be remembered against him: he will live on in his righteousness" (Ezekiel 18:22) to mean that through repentance, all of the sinner's sins would be transformed and considered merits.96 With a twist of interpretation, the former apostate was metamorphosed from the epitome of evil, an idol worshipei, into someone who might just have a more favorable docket in the heavenly court than the very householder who wanted to dismiss him. Following the view of Isserlein, who contended that abandoning the pleasures of life among the non-Jews and accepting the restrictions imposed by Judaism were punishment enough for the repentant Jew, Bachrach asserted that if the Ruthenian Jew could substantiate his claims that he had indeed performed the penances asked of him, the community, which did not believe that he had ever done penance, must accept him back as a repentant Jew. The miseries and embarrassment that he had endured, Bachrach suggested, were atonement enough for his sins. The community must ease his return to Judaism in order not to prevent others from repenting. Bachrach's view was clearly opposed to the public opinion that not only had rejected the man as the community's representative in prayer but had forced the man, whose claims Bachrach initially believed, to flee the town. Bachrach must have realized that his ruling would gall the community, yet before he was able to sign the responsum two witnesses came and told a somewhat different story about the Ruthenian Jew. According to their account, had indeed apostatized but had been an unsuccessful apostate. Disliked by Christians, he tried to return to the Jewish community.97 The witnesses claimed that he had sought penances but had never fulfilled them. 95. Bachrach was certainly not unique in following in the tradition of leniency. Rabbi Mordecai Jaffe, one of the important Polish halakhists of the late sixteenth century, ruled that one must be lenient with an apostate who comes to repent (Sefer 'ateret zahab [1825; reprint, New York: Gross Brothers, n.d.], 158.2). 96. A similar notion appears in Midrash Rabbah (Exodus) 31.1, but based on a verse in Ezekiel 33, not this particular verse. 97. Discussing the Italian milieu, Kenneth Stow, "A Tale of Uncertainties: Converts in the Roman Ghetto," in Sholomo Simonsohn Jubilee Volume, Ahron Oppenheimer et al., eds. (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv University, 1993), pp. 258-259, notes that the Christian world trusted converts</page><page sequence="29">REPENTANT APOSTATES IN MEDIEVAL ASHKENAZ AND PREMODERN POLAND 327 Bachrach was further informed that after about two weeks in Worms the man, who had feigned to be the paradigm of a repentant Jew had begun to act frivolously, swear, and get drunk regularly. Bachrach banished him from the region. Saved great anguish, Bachrach nevertheless concluded his responsum by reaffirming that he believed his position to be legally correct if a repentant was truly contrite. Bachrach went to great lengths to try and ease the way for repentant apostates, but clearly there were contemporary Jews, as he himself alluded to, who wanted nothing to do with such people. The efforts of R. Gershom and Rashi in the eleventh century and many other subsequent Ashkenazic authorities to encourage the return of apostates and to change public attitudes toward them were ultimately unsuccessful. R. Solomon Luria, writing in mid-sixteenth-century Poland, observed that R. Gershom's ordinance that no one insult a repentant Jew "did not spread to all these lands.""9 One might conjecture that this was because it never really took hold among the general Ashkenazic population. Rabbinic efforts and the tears of some family members notwithstanding, the Jewish community would not readily accept those who had apostatized of their own volition back into the community. As a religious minority some Jews most certainly rejected apostates as traitors who had shirked the travails of Jewish belief and identity, and who could never be welcomed back into the community. Others must have seen them as permanently tainted by the stain of idolatry and other sins associated by Jews with life among the Christians (e.g., forbidden foods, sexual promiscuity). Ashkenazic Jews had traditionally cursed such people; their return to Judaism would not quickly erase such feelings." Yet Polish Jewry of the mid-seventeenth century had a much more immediate concern little more than the Jews did, often abandoning them financially once they had been baptized. Frankel-Goldschmidt, "Be-shuley ha-hebrah ha-yehudit," pp. 635-637, adds that the Jewish apostate was an object of derision in sixteenth-century Germany, perhaps no less than the Jew himself. In seventeenth-century France, an anonymous poet reminded a descendant of Marranos that he still reeked of the foetor iudaicus (see Gilbert Dahan, "Contre un Juif," Archives Juives 16, no. 1 [1980]: 6, 7).

Between the years 1642 and 1648, Rabbi Nathan Kahana of Ostrog (d. after 1650) was asked about a Jew who had willingly apostatized, later regretted his decision and decided to repent, and then secretly fled the Christian community.'" The Christians noted his absence and accused the Jews of enticing him and stealing him away. They fettered members of the local Jewish community, promising to release them only when the Christian neophyte was safely returned.'0t If he was not returned it, seems that a Jew would be killed.102 Having no idea of his whereabouts, the Jews began a search for the individual. After numerous inquiries they found him wandering "in a field like a lost sheep ...in a distant land" with sackcloth on his head, repenting his past deeds. Kahana, an authority of some stature in his own day,103 was asked whether the Jewish community could legally return the repentant Jew to the Christians.Y?4 (Jerusalem: Zalman Shazar Center, 1992), p. 151, n. 9, draws attention to the fact that the curses so commonly heaped on apostates in the Ashkenazic world were not pervasive in the Muslim world. 100. Nathan Kahana, She'elot u-teshubot dibrey renanah, I. Herskovitz, ed. (Brooklyn, N.Y.: n.p., 1984), no. 54. Some biographical information on Kahana is provided in the first few pages of Herskovitz's unpaginated introduction. 101. On the meaning of Kahana's phrase "~rt'r irva rv 7ty own t) i "n1'1n31" see Psalms 105:18. 102. The question, reformulated by Kahana, states that many Jews were held. In his response Kahana refers to a Jew being killed if the repentant runaway was not returned to the Christian community. 103. When Rabbi Shabbetai ha-Kohen published his commentary on a portion of Joseph Karo's Shulhan 'aruk (Cracow, 1646), he badly needed the approbations of contemporary rabbinic authorities to assure both the publication and purchase of the work of such a young scholar. Kahana was the third signatory, after the rabbi and rabbinic judge of Cracow, among the eighteen to sign. 104. Herskovitz's transcription is faulty on a crucial word in the question addressed to Kahana. The text as printed suggests that the Jewish community did not want to return the repenter (1nim 5P~r v's 1i0ob5 'lV t). However, Bodleian Hebrew Manuscript Neubauer 833 (Herskovitz's labeling as 388 is simply a typographical error; Opp. 75) fol. 174b, clearly reads ini na 'n T b i oln v'v "if they [sic] may be turned over to their hands against his will." Since the responsum only discusses the surrender of the apostate, I have assumed that the third-person masculine plural ending of the word ino~nb is simply a mistake and should be a third person masculine singular ending.</page><page sequence="31">REPENTANT APOSTATES IN MEDIEVAL ASHKENAZ AND PREMODERN POLAND 329 Kahana formulated his position by drawing on a number of talmudic sources, the most important of which was the following. A group of people were walking on the way and encountered non-Jews who said to them, "Give us one of you and we will kill him, and if [you do] not we will kill all of you." They must all be killed, and they should not give over one Jewish soul. If they singled out one of them, like Sheva ben Bikri, they should turn him over and not be killed. Reish Laqish said, And that is only if he deserves the death penalty like Sheva ben Bikri, and Rabbi Yohanan said, Even though he does not deserve the death penalty like Sheva ben Bikri.o05 Generally, rabbinic authorities followed R. Yohanan in disputes with Reish Laqish, but in this case Rabbi Moses Maimonides (1135-1204) had concluded that the law was as Reish Laqish said, and ruled that if the non-Jews specified an individual who was not deserving of death (i.e., was not guilty of a capital crime), then "they should all die and not give them one soul from Israel."'6 While some Ashkenazic (and Sephardic) authorities followed R. Yohanan, R. Me'ir of Rothenburg accepted Maimonides' view and thus helped make it the normative opinion in Ashkenazic legal thought.107 The halakhah appeared to demand that the Jewish community protect the repentant Jew and bear the consequences, but this was a conclusion that Kahana could not endure. He immediately tried to limit the talmudic case to a situation where the person singled out by the non-Jews would certainly be killed by his captors. According to Kahana, even Reish Laqish would agree that in any other instance Jews could simply hand over the person who had been requested by the non-Jews.

Kahana was well aware that a Jew was required to die before becoming an idolater, but that, he argued, was the ideal. If someone was forced to become an idolater and succumbed rather than allowing himself to be killed, he would not be subject to punishment, human or divine, because he had sinned under duress, and that, Kahana, argued, was no different than violating any other prohibition under duress.'" Yet idolatry under duress was the very offense that Ashkenazic Jews throughout the Middle Ages had died rather transgress! However, the weight of history did not have a discernible impact on Kahana. Idolatry and idolatry under duress were legally separate matters, and he fully exploited the difference. He even added that the situation was not so dire, far as time passed, the repentant Jew might be able to escape from the Christian world and return to Judaism; if a hostage was killed, he would never be able to fulfill the commandments again--a fate much worse than almost any sin. Kahana's working assumption was that the repentant Jew would not be killed if he was returned to the Christian community. Yet Kahana acknowl- edged that according to canon law an apostate could be killed even if he agreed to return to Christianity. If so, there was a legal loophole to close so that no one could argue that returning the repentant Jew to the Christian community was essentially giving him over to death. Kahana again returned to the Jerusalem Talmud, singling out Reish Laqish's phrase, "and that is only if he deserves the death penalty like Sheva ben Bikri." Was it not obvious, Kahana asked, that a man condemned to death, who would ultimately be executed by the rabbinic court, could be turned over to be killed to save a group of innocent Jews? He was going to die at any rate. If so, Kahana continued, what was Reish Laqish's point? Kahana suggested that when Reish Laqish said that the individual must be deserving of death, he meant that he must be deserving of death in non-Jewish society even if totally innocent in Jewish society. So rendered, the case before Kahana fit Reish Laqish's paradigm perfectly. The repentant Jew did not deserve the penalty in a Jewish court; quite the contrary, he had done what the halakhah 108. Aware that his reinterpretation of the case in the Jerusalem Talmud could simply be labeled a textual "quick fix" by critics, Kahana attempted to show that his explanation solved other textual problems not connected to the case under consideration. 109. See Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Yesodey ha-Torah 5.4.</page><page sequence="33">REPENTANT APOSTATES IN MEDIEVAL ASHKENAZ AND PREMODERN POLAND 331 demanded and repented. According to canon law, however, as a relapsed convert he was deserving of death, and as such the Jewish community could hand the man over in clear conscience. Forced to exclude all possibilities that might be raised in the repentant apostate's defense, Kahana offered a number of other arguments as to why he should be returned to the Christian community, among them that the apostate had brought about his own predicament. Kahana had little mercy for someone who had endangered himself and the Jewish community through voluntary apostasy. Still not satisfied, Kahana tried to undermine the repentant Jew's position even further. Noting that it was the custom of Christians to take another Jew for a lapsed convert, Kahana declared the repentant Jew was a rodef (someone who threatened the life of a fellow Jew and who, according to Jewish law, may, if necessary, be killed by either the intended victim in self-defense or by bystanders). It was therefore permitted to turn him over to the Christians even if it meant that he would certainly be killed.10 This rather subjective definition of the repentant Jew only highlighted Kahana's efforts to overcome the halakhic requirement that the Jewish community protect the repentant Jew. Kahana resisted this demand with all the halakhic arguments he could muster. He even addressed the religious sensibilities of the hostage(s), unequivocally stating that anyone who allowed himself to be killed to save the repentant Jew would be guilty of suicide and would lose his portion in the world to come. Kahana was not the only authority of the time to deal with the issue of turning Jews over to the Christian authorities. Rabbi David ben Samuel ha- Levi, writing at about the same time as Kahana, ruled in his supercommentary to Karo's Shulhan 'aruk that one could only hand over a person requested by the non-Jews if he was indeed deserving of death like Sheva ben Bikri." Yet R. David enjoyed a luxury that Kahana did not have; he was writing a commentary on a code of law. He could write what he believed to be the 110. On the rabbinic understanding of the biblical rationale for killing a rodef see B.T., Sanhedrin 73a. 111. Even if, based on the Jerusalem Talmud, the Jew demanded by the non-Jews was deserving of death, R. David ben Samuel ha-Levi did not believe that a sage should become involved but should simply let the masses do as they please, which he believed would be to save themselves by turning over the individual. See David ben Samuel ha-Levi, Turey zahab, Yoreh de'ah 157, n. 7.</page><page sequence="34">332 EDWARD FRAM ideal; he was not pressured to reexamine the parameters of the law by a case that involved the sufferings of real human beings.112 What happened to the hostage(s) and the repentant Jew that Kahana dealt with remains unknown. Yet there was a troubling legal implication to Kahana's views. If the Christians were ever to demand that the Jewish community turn over an innocent Jew to be forcibly converted or else the entire community (or another individual) would be killed, the community would have to give over the innocent person. This was not a hypothetical issue. Kahana concluded with a chilling observation. He himself had seen Christians come to the Jewish community in Cracow and demand that they give them a particular innocent Jewish child from the school for "idolatry." The child was given to the Christians."'3 The problem of dealing with repentant apostates who had endangered Jews persisted. In the second half of the seventeenth century, a certain Jewess swore to convert to Christianity. The woman, who apparently had informed the Christians but not her fellow Jews of her designs, was whisked away by her relatives "because of the shame" once they heard about her machinations.114 Their actions, however, provoked the ire of the local ruler."' Demanding the return of a potential convert, the ruler of the unnamed (Lithuanian?) town 112. In 1620, Rabbi Joel Sirkes, R. David ben Samuel ha-Levi's father-in-law, was faced with a case in which the king's ministers ruled that the Jewish community must turn over the sexton of Kalisz to stand trial before the wojewoda court on charges connected to a host. If the sexton was not surrendered, the leaders of the Jewish community would stand trial in his place. See Joel Sirkes, She'elot u-teshubot ha-bayit ha-hadash (Frankfurt, 1697), no. 43, an English translation and commentary of which has been prepared by Elijah Schochet, A Responsum of Surrender (Los Angeles: University of Judaism Press, 1973), as well as Sirkes's Bayit hadash, Yoreh de'ah 157. Although some of Sirkes's rationales anticipated those proposed by Kahana, Kahana quotes neither of Sirkes's works. 113. Although the church had already in the thirteenth century prohibited the involuntary baptism of Jewish children as a violation of Jewish parental rights as well as the belief that baptism must be accepted voluntarily, the legal debate among canonists and theologians over the issue continued well into the fifteenth century (see Walter Pakter, Medieval Canon Law and the Jews [Ebelsbach: Rolf Gremer, 1988], pp. 322-330, and R. Po-chia Hsia, The Myth of Ritual Murder, pp. 112-118). 114. According to information added by R. Isaac ben Abraham of Poznan, the source of the community's information about the woman's oath and intentions came from the Christians. See Isaac ben Abraham of Poznan, She'elot u-teshubot Rabbeynu Y.haq me-Pozna', Ya'aqob Aharonfeld, et al., eds. (Jerusalem: Machon Yerushalayim, 1982), no. 38, p. 56. 115. Whether the ruler was himself aggravated by the actions of the Jews or whether he was prodded into action by the local clergy is not specified in the responsum.</page><page sequence="35">REPENTANT APOSTATES IN MEDIEVAL ASHKENAZ AND PREMODERN POLAND 333 jailed the communal leaders and the local rabbi, a certain Samuel, torturing them until they finally agreed to relinquish the woman."' Once released, R. Samuel wrote to an unnamed rabbi from Sielec asking him to confirm his decision to turn over the woman. Arguing that the woman had brought her problems upon herself, R. Samuel maintained that since she had accepted idolatry, she was deserving of death like Sheva ben Bikri and could therefore be surrendered even if it meant certain death."' The case before him was legally simplified by the local ruler's promise to give her the option of remaining a Jew before he dealt with her. Her relatives (and everyone else, it seems) feared that she would not be able to withstand the temptation of the bribes that would invariably be offered to draw her into the Christian faith. This, R. Samuel maintained, was her problem. Individuals in the community should not be endangered to shield her from temptation. To R. Samuel's chagrin, the rabbi from Sielec refused to concur with his position. Moreover, R. Samuel learned that one of the outstanding authorities of the day, Rabbi Isaac ben Abraham of Poznan (d. 1685), also opposed his actions (others said that R. Isaac endorsed them). Concerned, R. Samuel sent his responsum to R. Isaac, asking him to remove the "shame from his head" as well as to try and establish legal precedent. R. Isaac of Poznan responded by rejecting part of R. Samuel's legal argument but accepting his practical conclusion."11 Relying on Rabbi Joel Sirkes's (d. 1640, Cracow) opinion that the community need not protect someone who had brought her problems upon herself, R. Isaac ruled that the community could turn the woman over to the noble. It was her responsibility to withstand any enticement that might be offered her to apostatize. R. Isaac believed that contemporary Christians could not force Jews to apostatize and therefore did not believe that he was sending the woman to certain apostasy. Since the noble had promised to ask her if she wanted to remain a Jew first, there was a chance that she might indeed withstand the ordeal and remain a Jew, but that was her responsibility. R. Isaac was not directly bringing about either her apostasy or her death. 116. Isaac ben Abraham of Poznan, Responsa, no. 37, p. 53.

See B.T., Sanhedrin 60b. 118. Isaac ben Abraham, Responsa,, no. 38, pp. 55-59.</page><page sequence="36">334 EDWARD FRAM The need to protect the community led R. Isaac to declare that anyone whose actions caused others to threaten the Jewish community was a rodef even if the individual acted without any intention of bringing harm to the community. Once labeled a rodef, everyone had the right, indeed the duty, to do whatever was necessary, even killing the woman, to remove the threat that she posed."9 Such a ruling clashed with one of the classic talmudic cases of rodef a child whose birth threatens the mother's life. In the talmudic case, so long as the child's head has not emerged from the womb, its life must be sacrificed to save the mother's.-20 However, once the child's head has emerged from the womb, the child cannot be harmed. According to R. Isaac's distinction, the child, albeit unintentionally, threatened the mother's life even when its head had emerged and thus should be killed. R. Isaac rejected interpretation and explained that the Talmud specifically brought the case of childbirth because it is an exception. The child is but the agent of a heavenly decree against the mother, and therefore one may not interfere. However, R. Isaac reasoned, in any other case when someone's actions unintentionally threaten a Jew, even though the person is not actively threatening anyone, he is categorized as a rodef and one may kill him. R. Isaac did not believe that he was being innovative. He had heard from his teacher, Rabbi Jacob Schor, perhaps the leading rabbinic authority in Lithuania in the mid-seventeenth century, that there had once been a case in Jaroslaw in which a small child (Qp nn ) had apostatized and had later, following the demands of Jewish law, returned to Judaism.'21 The Christians came to the community demanding the child; the Jews had surrendered him without any record of a fuss. 119. The rodefdefense is not simply a legal excuse for the victim (or bystanders) to kill the aggressor but is legally required of them if stopping the aggressor by some other means (e.g., wounding) is not possible. For a brief discussion of this particular aspect of the laws of rodef in the parlance of American jurisprudence, see Marilyn Finkelman, "Self-Defense and Defense of Others in Jewish Law: The Rodef Defense," Wayne Law Review 33 (1987): 1262-1263. 120. Ohalot 7.6 reads the "majority" of the child had left the womb; B.T., Sanhedrin 72b reads "his head" had emerged. I have followed R. Isaac in citing the Babylonian Talmud's version. 121. It is not clear whether the case occurred in Jaroslaw, which hosted a very small Jewish population prior to the mid-seventeenth century (see Mojzesz Steinberg, Zydzi w Jaroslawiu od czasdw najdawniejszych do polowy XIX wieku [Jaroslaw: Littman, 1933], pp. 9, 10, 12), or whether Schor was referring to a case that had taken place elsewhere and was discussed by the Polish rabbinic leadership during their regular gatherings at the Jaroslaw fair.</page><page sequence="37">REPENTANT APOSTATES IN MEDIEVAL ASHKENAZ AND PREMODERN POLAND 335 Schor left his student with no (convincing?) rationale for what had happened. R. Isaac argued that the community had surrendered the child because in following the demands of the halakhah and returning to the Jewish community the child had unwittingly caused others to threaten the Jewish community. While totally well intentioned and laudable from the Jewish standpoint, the boy was halakhically a rodef! As such, R. Isaac argued, the community was well within its rights to surrender him to the Christians.'22 While R. Isaac's definition of rodefwas an expansion of the parameters of the talmudic definition that demanded that someone be currently and personally threatening an innocent individual, it was in well in keeping with Ashkenazic tradition. Already in the thirteenth century, Rabbi Hayyim, son of R. Isaac ben Moses of Vienna, had ruled that anyone who deals in forged coins or similar items or anything else that might cause harm to the community, if the community warned him not to do so and he did not listen, they may tell the non-Jews that X deals in these horrible things. And if he did it only once and stopped, then it is certainly prohibited to inform on him. Therefore, if the community was endangered by this, even if one person was endangered by this because the non-Jews believe that he did this [as in a case where] it is known to the them [i.e., the non-Jews] with certainty that one Jew did so, but they do not know who did it and they come and accuse one Jew, [saying] "you did it," it is permissible for him to tell the non-Jews that X did it and not me. And even if he who did the deed did not intend harm but rather to perform a mitzvah, such as the case of our master Isaac, who circumcised converts and because of this the community was endangered .. .123 Jacob Schor was a prominent signatory to decrees of the Lithuanian rabbinic leadership from at least 1649 to 1662. See Pinqas ha-medinah, Simon Dubnow, ed. (Berlin: Ajanoth, 1925), person index, s.v. Ya'aqob ben Efrayim Zalman Schor. 122. R. Isaac's conclusion smacks of the necessity defense (i.e., the choice of the lesser evil in cases of conflicting values), a defense not usually admitted in halakhah. George Fletcher, "Self-Defense as a Justification for Punishment," Cardozo Law Review 12 (1991): 863, has correctly noticed that "Absent a general theory of necessity, Jewish law has revealed certain tendencies to expand the law of 'pursuit' well beyond the core cases of aggression analyzed in the Talmud." 123. Hayyim ben Isaac, Responsa, no. 142. J. Wellesz, "Hayyim b. Isaac Or Zaroua," Revue des etudesjuives 53 (1907): 77, n. 2, maintained this to be a responsum of R. Me'ir of Rothenburg, but the conclusion of this responsum, "and the case is written in Or zaru 'a and I have already written about it," points to a work that postdates R. Isaac ben Moses of Vienna</page><page sequence="38">336 EDWARD FRAM While R. Hayyim did not specifically categorize the person who endan- gered the community as a rodef in the context of his discussion he compared unrepentant perpetrators of violent acts against members of the community to a rodef R. Hayyim feared that if not checked, like violent persons who could return to torment their victims and perhaps kill them, those engaged in illegal activities could ultimately threaten the community. Individuals had the right to inform the non-Jewish authorities about such people-even if only one individual was threatened, and even if the accused was not currently engaged in such activities--knowing full well that there could be frightful consequences for them (i.e., loss of all assets-capital punishment is not suggested). R. Hayyim's ruling may have had its antecedents in the work of R. Me'ir of Rothenburg. In a responsum dealing with appealing to the non-Jewish authorities, R. Me'ir cited the Talmud's interpretation of Isaiah 51:20, "Your children have fainted, they lie at the beginning of every street as an antelope in a net" Focusing on the biblical phrase "as an antelope in a net" the Talmud explained, "Just as this antelope fell into the net and they have no mercy on it, so too the money of Israel, when it falls into the hands of the non-Jews they have no mercy on it."24 R. Me'ir expanded, "That is to say, when Israel falls into their hands with regard to anything, they [i.e., the non-Jews] falsely accuse him [Israel] so much that it often results in mortal danger." Jews in thirteenth-century Germany not only did not want the non-Jewish authorities to interfere in their internal affairs; they feared the ramifications of such intervention. The halakhah, however, offered no clear method of dealing with individuals who might give the non-Jews cause to intrude into Jewish life. R. Me'ir was so fearful of the potential harm that such interference might wreak on the community that he was willing to expand talmudic definitions and brand anyone who might bring it about a rodef. Since according to the halakhah a rodef must be stopped by all possible means, even if it means killing him, R. Me'ir had effectively found a legal rubric that freed the and certainly R. Me'ir. I have been unable to locate any such reference either in Or zaru 'a or in R. Hayyim's own work. 124.

That R. Hayyim labeled people dealing in forged coins dangerous people who could be surrendered to the authorities was quite in keeping with R. Me'ir's views. Undoubtedly, there were other precedents in Ashkenazic exegetical and legal thought that contributed to R. Hayyim's ruling. Rabbi Joseph Kara (11 cent.) may have been of the opinion that Sheva ben Bikri was killed by the people of Abel because he had endangered others, not necessarily because he was guilty.'25 Sefer hasidim ruled that if a Jew persisted in endangering the community even after having being warned to desist, he could be turned over to the non-Jewish community, seemingly because he had brought it upon himself.126 Yet these sources did not make the connection between someone who unwittingly endangered the community and a rodef R. Me'ir did. R. Hayyim's ruling did not go unnoticed. Rabbi Menahem of Merseburg (fi. 14th cent.) copied R. Hayyim's opinion into his own work, a work that Rabbi Jacob Weil declared was the basis of all customs in Saxony.127 From there it found its way into Rabbi Moses Isserles's (d. 1572) authoritative glosses on Shulhan 'aruk. Isserles ruled, "Whoever endangers many people, such as someone who deals in forgeries in a place where the governments are strict [about this matter], his status is like a rodef and he may be turned over to the government.""'28 Categorizing such people "like a rodef' and invoking the idea of self-defense was the only halakhic means of purging the perceived aggressor. 129 Ashkenazic Jewry undoubtedly faced numerous attempts at forced conver- sion over the centuries, yet in the two major instances of coerced conversion, in 1096 and 1648, the community received permission for those who had 125.

If, during any other instance of forced apostatism of Jews in Ashkenaz in the Middle Ages, Ashkenazic communities were ever willing to endanger themselves by trying to bring forced apostates back into the fold against the will of Church and monarch, not only did they leave no record of such valiant efforts, but they left no imprint of such an attitude in the minds of subsequent generations. When R. Me'ir of Rothenburg expressed his fear of non-Jews interfering in Jewish affairs, he likely only formally acknowledged what was already well established. The community feared giving Christians, be it the Church or lay authorities, any pretense for becoming involved in Jewish affairs. At times, in order to maintain communal order, it could not be helped, but generally there was a working assumption: keep Christians out of Jewish communal affairs. Rabbinic attitudes toward accepting repentant apostates were not based upon objective judicial considerations of the person's legal status. If they were, almost every repentant apostate would have been accepted regardless of the consequences. Few were deserving of death in Jewish law like Sheva ben Bikri, and so, according to the Mishnah, Jews should have sacrificed their own lives to protect them. However, the overarching concern of Polish rabbinic authorities was communal welfare, not individual salvation. If rabbis sympathized with apostates who wanted to return to Judaism, they did not dare let such feelings sway them. This was not new. Halakhic authorities who weighed the status of con- versos who had taken the daring step of fleeing the Christian community and returning to Judaism almost always concentrated on how the return of the converso would affect their local community.130 There were, of course, limits to such considerations. An Algerian Jew (himself a former apostate from the Iberian peninsula) objected to accepting such people back into the community on the basis of the economic harm that it would cause, a position rejected in no uncertain terms by Rabbi Isaac ben Sheshet (1326-1408).131 Economic issues were not sufficient cause to reject a returning apostate. However, in many instances Spanish Jewry as well as Jews in Muslim lands were willing to endanger their own lives and communities to help Jews return to Judaism.132 No such idea had wide currency among Polish Jewry.
