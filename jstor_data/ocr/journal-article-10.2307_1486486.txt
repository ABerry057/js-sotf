<plain_text><page sequence="1">176 BOOK REVIEWS Richard Fenn. The Death of Herod: An Essay in the Sociology of Religion. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992. x, 200 pp. The thesis of this book is the following (I quote from the epilogue, pp. 182-183): In order to reproduce itself any society must ensure that the next generation knows the language of the community. . . . I have been suggesting that in Herod's reign and demise we can find the reasons why the nation [of Israel] could not reproduce itself from one generation to the next. Those reasons have to do partly with the rivalry of sons with fathers and of brothers with each other. That rivalry, however, was both the result and the cause of a widening gap between language and reality .... the breach between language and reality made it virtually impossible for the nation to construe individual actions. Whether this is novel and perceptive sociology or (as I fear) a string of vacuous generalizations and rhetorical commonplaces, I leave for others to determine. I am not a sociologist but a historian. In this review I would like to explain why the book is useless for the historian of Jewish antiquity. The jacket informs us that Richard Fenn, the Upson Professor of Chris- tianity and Society at Princeton Theological Seminary, is also the author, inter alia, of The Secularization of Sin and The Dream of the Perfect Act. He is not a historian and knows nothing of historical criticism and historical scholarship. Here is a book nominally about the death of Herod that nowhere mentions the name of A. Schalit (author of the standard modem biography of Herod, in German), M. Stern (author of numerous Hebrew articles on Herod, Herodian society, and Josephus), or, indeed, of any scholar who writes in a language other than English. Much of the book is based on the view that Herod ruled by terror and fear and therefore was widely feared and hated by his Jewish subjects; Fenn explicitly draws an analogy with Stalin and Hitler (pp. 98, 134). Never, however, does it occur to him to ask whether this characterization of Herod is true or false (it almost occurs to him on pp. 56-57, but the flash of light quickly dims and is soon forgotten); nowhere does he observe that this characterization of Herod is found only in the Jewish Antiquities of Josephus, that it is completely absent from the same author's Jewish War, and that this contradiction is part of a whole series of contradictions and contrasts between the two works that require analysis. The depths of the author's ignorance of ancient Judaism are revealed throughout the book: the Hasmoneans brought</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 177 the Edomites into the kingdom of Judaea "two and a half centuries before Herod" (p. 6); a colleague is credited with the "fascinating observation" that the entrances to (many) Galilean synagogues face south toward Jerusalem, a fact mentioned and discussed in virtually every handbook on the history of the synagogue (p. 25); there is no awareness of the historical distance between the Pharisees of Hasmonean times and the rabbis of Roman times (p. 29, n. 14); "relatively few Jews" lived in Tiberias (p. 41, n. 5, an error that resulted from the author's misreading of the one history book that he did read); the governor of Syria is called the "president" of Syria (pp. 113, 117); etc., etc. Perhaps the most serious historical flaw is the assumption that Herodian succession and Jewish society are somehow synonymous, so that a crisis in the former indicates a crisis in the latter. The social setting of the Herodian monarchy-its supporters, its opponents, its propaganda, its infrastructure, its ideology, its relationship to other vassal kings in the Roman east, its relationship to other institutionalized and noninstitutionalized expressions of Judaism (the former including the Temple, the priesthood, and the scribes[?], the latter including prophets, holy men, teachers, Pharisees[?], Qumran[?], etc.)-is never investigated. Fenn blithely assumes that a crisis in the Herodian monarchy must have been a crisis in religion and society generally, as if the place of the Herodian monarchy in the cosmic order were akin to that of the Davidic monarchy centuries before. He further assumes that Herod's disastrous relations with his sons somehow are symptomatic of problems in the society at large. This is not only poor history; it is poor sociology. A Christian perspective is sometimes evident in the book. Fenn speaks of "the forces that ultimately destroyed Israel" in 70 C.E., even though Israel was not destroyed in 70 C.E. This is (old-fashioned, politically incorrect) Christian theology speaking (pp. 5, 15). Numerous remarks throughout the book show that the author's real interest is the early Christian movement and the communities behind the gospels; Jewish history is a kind of praeparatio evangelica (see esp. p. 82 and the epilogue). Indeed, the entire focus of the book seems to be Christian in conception. As a sociologist Fenn claims that he is studying social forces that are not bound by the specifics of time or place, but surely it is not accidental that the example he has chosen of a society unable to reproduce itself is the Jewish society of the late first century B.C.E. and first century C.E. From the Christian perspective this was a society unable to reproduce itself, for it was this society that spawned a movement</page><page sequence="3">178 BOOK REVIEWS that would eventually claim to be the sole authentic expression of Judaism and the sole authentic heir of the status of Israel. In Fenn's mind the death of Herod prefigures the death of Christ, for the circumstances of each death show how Israel was unable to reproduce itself. How could this book have been salvaged? Had the author really studied the period he was nominally treating; had he abandoned, or at least made explicit, his Christian perspective; had he shown how sociological theory is able to make clear points that otherwise are obscure; had he first attempted to understand ancient Jewish society as a whole and the role of the Herodian monarchy within it-had he done these things, perhaps the result would have been a useful book. As it stands, however, the book says nothing to the historian. What this book shows most of all is that in our frenzied times even a respected publisher can publish a work not ready for publication.
