<plain_text><page sequence="1">Daniel Boyarin. A Radical Jew: Paul and the Politics of Identity. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994. xi, 366 pp. In this book, which announces its postmodernism on the first page, the apostle Paul is a "cultural critic" whose critique of Jewish particularism from the inside is of value for Jews and others even today. The best recent scholarship on Paul has abandoned the long-held Christian view that Paul rejected Judaism because of its desiccated legalism. But if Judaism was a vital and attractive force and the commandments of the Torah a source of joy rather than of anxiety, what led Paul to reject the observance of the law? Daniel Boyarin's answer to this question is that Paul was deeply worried about the status of gentiles in God's plan for salvation, and he argues that the writings of Paul should be read as directed at this problem. In Boyarin's view, it was the dualism Paul shared with so many of his contemporaries that gave him the tools to provide a consistent and thorough answer to this problem. The dualism that came to him from the widely diffused, popular Platonism of the day was both anthropological and hermeneutical. Just as the body is inferior to the soul, the literal meaning of the text of the Torah is inferior to its spiritual meaning. Thus the true Israel consists not of the physical descendants of Abraham, the Jews, but of the spiritual descendants, the Christians, and the true fulfillment of the Torah is</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 149 not the performance of physical prescriptions like circumcision and the laws of kashrut, but rather the achievement of the spiritual states that these laws point to. Similarly, Paul and the Platonic tradition on which he draws favor the universal over the particular. Thus in Christ Paul sees the differences that have defined humanity overcome. The central text in the Pauline corpus in Boyarin's reading is Galatians 3:28, "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus." Boyarin develops this reading of Paul in relation to several important passages from the letters. Yet despite Boyarin's claims, the reader may be forgiven for feeling that the picture I have just sketched, with Paul representing universalism, and Judaism, particularism, sounds more nineteenth-century than postmodern. Boyarin himself notes how close his reading of Paul is to that of Ferdinand Christian Baur, the founder of the Ttibingen school of New Testament scholarship in the middle of the nineteenth century. Yet, as anyone with a passing familiarity with postmodernism will recognize, the privileged terms in Paul's dualism, "spirit" over "body" and "letter," "universal" over "particular," have fallen into ill repute, as indeed has dualism itself. While for Baur, a Hegelian, Paul's universalism is a higher stage of development than Jewish particularism, for Boyarin, particularism, like the body, has much to recommend it. Indeed, it will emerge that the real good guys of Boyarin's story are the rabbis, or at least the rabbis properly understood, that is, as Boyarin understands them. Still Boyarin cannot be accused of failing to take the Paul he and Baur read seriously and sympathetically. Boyarin's picture of first-century Judaism is crucial for his understand- ing of Paul as cultural critic, and here I find Boyarin's affinity for Baur rather more worrisome than Boyarin does. Baur's reading of Paul's place in early Christianity rests on essentialist views of Judaism and Hellenism as contrasting entities, a view that Boyarin nuances but ultimately shares. Although Boyarin bows in the direction of recent scholarship, which has insisted that Hellenistic culture influenced not only the Jews of the diaspora but also the Jews of Palestine, his depiction of Hellenistic Judaism allows for maximum contrast with the Judaism of the rabbis. For Boyarin, Hellenism is roughly equivalent to Platonism. Boyarin's debt to the century of scholarship after Baur is to transfer the characteristics once associated with Hellenism to Hellenistic Judaism: the Judaism of Greek-speaking Jews is a Jewish version of Platonism; other than Paul, its chief representative is Philo. Let me offer one example of what is at stake in this definition of Hellenistic</page><page sequence="3">150 BOOK REVIEWS Judaism. In 1 Corinthians 15:44, Paul tells his followers that they will be provided with "spiritual bodies" at the resurrection. Boyarin tries hard to claim this most unpromising category for Platonism on the grounds that it represents a thorough working out of the belief that "everything physical has a spiritual counterpart-i.e., some version of platonism" (p. 62). But the Judaism of Greek-speaking Jews was far more diverse than Boyarin's emphasis on Platonism suggests. A Hellenistic Judaism that included 2 Enoch, an apocalypse probably written in Egypt in Greek in the first century, as well as related apocalypses, would have suggested a different, and, I believe, more persuasive, background for spiritual bodies, the transformation of the body of the hero as he stands before the divine throne. Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Boyarin's picture of first-century Judaism, and indeed of Paul himself, is his extreme deemphasis of eschatology. For example, Boyarin manages to leave the Dead Sea Scrolls, perhaps the most striking evidence for the intensity of eschatological expectation among some first-century Jews, virtually unmentioned. Many scholars have read Paul's rejection of difference in the light of such expectations: "neither Jew nor Greek . . . no male and female . . . in Christ Jesus." Boyarin himself admits that Paul did not expect to see his radical program of the elimination of gender differences realized in the present. But eschatology is bad for Boyarin's reading of Paul for the same reason it is bad for many Christian theologians: a Paul who lived expecting the end, soon, was offering not a critique of Judaism or a theory of Christian life, but temporary solutions for a temporary condition, life in this world. Without the final chapters A Radical Jew would be an interesting instance of postmodernism rediscovering the nineteenth century. But Boyarin has advertised Paul as a cultural critic with something to say to us today, and what that is he tells us in the last two chapters of the book. Paul's concern for gentiles' place in God's plan is admirable. The problem with Paul's universalism is that it leaves no room for the particular. Jewish practices may be tolerated-Paul calls them a matter of indifference-but they can hardly be honored given his view of the spirit and the letter of the law. Judaism, the Judaism of the rabbis, respects difference; it does not insist that gentiles become Jews. But precisely its embrace of difference puts it in danger of ignoring those others and even of holding them in contempt. Here Paul's critique of Judaism is of value. But what is really on Boyarin's mind is Zionism. The tone of the discussion can be conveyed by his comment that the Natorei Karta's use of</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 151 PLO visas when visiting the Western Wall "has much to teach us" (p. 258). (He immediately reassures the reader: "This is not to be taken, of course, as an uncritical affirmation of all aspects of Natorei Karta society, specifically their gender practices" [p. 337, n. 45]). In the penultimate chapter of the book, Boyarin carefully examines recent German theological antisemitism and its relation to the Nazis. Yet in his last chapter Boyarin insists, "In order . .. to preserve the positive ethical, political value of Jewish genealogy as a mode of identity, Jews must preserve their subaltern status" (p. 242). Here he invokes the rabbis as models who "renounced [the land] until the final Redemption, because in an unredeemed world, temporal dominion and ethnic particularity are ... impossibly compromised" (p. 256). I find this astonishing. To claim that the rabbis voluntarily renounced the land out of anxiety about the results of power and ethnic particularism is historically wrongheaded; to insist at this point in the twentieth century that the best course for Jews is powerlessness is nothing less than morally irresponsible.
