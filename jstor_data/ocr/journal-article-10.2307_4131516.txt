<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review 28:1 (2004), 189-204 BIBLICAL ALLUSIONS IN MODERN AND POSTMODERN HEBREW LITERATURE by Avraham Balaban Hebrew authors of the 1960s and 1970s used the biblical context to hint at their protagonists' religious yearnings, to invest their texts with additional levels of meaning, and to amplify the significance of their plots. In the Hebrew "post- modernist" fiction of the late 1980s and the 1990s, however, biblical allusions are less commonly found, and their functions have fundamentally changed.' To ex- amine these different functions, let us first juxtapose two novels, Avram Heffner's Allelim [Alleles],2 a typical example of the "postmodernist" trend, and Amos Oz's Menuha Nekhona [A Perfect Peace],3 a representative novel of the Israeli "mod- ernist" school. Allelim is written in colloquial Hebrew, and its narrator and other characters rarely refer to the Bible. On the rare occasions when they do, those references are typically given in quotes. Here are two examples: The main protagonist, Michael, is undergoing a crisis, which will eventual- 1. For an account of the emergence of this school, see note [17] below. There are some funda- mental similarities between "postmodernist" Hebrew writers and Western and South American "post- modernist" writers, even though most Hebrew authors did not adopt all the basic assumptions and practices of their Western counterparts. In my book Gal aher basiporet ha'ivrit-Siporet ivrit post- modernistit [A Different Wave in Israeli Fiction-Postmodernist Israeli Fiction] Jerusalem: Keter, 1995) 1 discuss the similarities and differences between this school of Hebrew fiction and Western "postmodernism." In order to stay within the scope of this paper, I draw a comparison only between the "Postmodernist" writers and their predecessors in the "New Wave" (Amalia Kahana-Carmon, Oz, Ap- pelfeld, and others). Hebrew "postmodernist" writers clearly react to their predecessors and not to ear- lier generations of writers. The terms modernism and postmodernism appear in quotes in this article, following Richard J. Bernstein sound practice: "Throughout I have placed 'modernity/postmodernity' in scare quotes to sig- nal that it must be used with extreme caution. Anyone with even the most superficial acquaintance with recent debates can scarcely avoid noticing that the term 'modernity' and 'postmodernity' are slippery, vague, and ambiguous... .There is no consensus or agreement about the multiple meanings of these treacherous terms. . . .1 think it is best to use the expression 'modernity/postmodernity' to signify what Heidegger calls a Stimmung, a mood-one which is amorphous, protean, and shifting but which nev- ertheless exerts a powerful influence on the ways in which we think, act and experience."

His best friend, Emanuel (Ulie) is trying to help him but is at a loss about what he can do. Emanuel chides himself for "sitting like an idiot" at his friend's side, and wonders if his presence there is, in fact, helpful. He knows that "this is not help; it is just 'a palliative, the balm of Gilead,' no medicine, no real cure."4 The biblical Hebrew to which Emanuel resorts here (cf. Jeremiah 8:22, 46:11) suggests both his exasperation and his self-irony. His attempts to help his friend have all failed, and he feels helpless, impotent, and superfluous, just like the antiquated, obsolete vocabulary of biblical Hebrew. The elevated, high-flown bib- lical Hebrew stands out in this novel, whose narrator consistently uses the infor- mal vernacular of his characters. In fact, to underline that this is not Emanuel's authentic expression, the words "palliative, the balm of Gilead" are placed inside quotation marks. Emanuel also wonders whether he is offering his friend "spiritu- al succor"; this also is placed inside quotation marks to indicate that it is a bor- rowed, conventional phrase and not Emanuel's own linguistic style. Michael and Emanuel speak the Hebrew of native speakers, which is marked by a paucity of vocabulary and numerous grammatical errors. Yet, both like to strew their speech with highfalutin, euphuistic expressions as a means of display- ing wit and esprit. Thus, for example, Michael tells Emanuel that he knows that his upcoming marriage to Orit is "such incredible foolishness. So much so that I could declare dramatically that 'the world has never seen its parallel,"'5 echoing Job 41:25. Before resorting to Job's idiom, Michael warns his friend that he is about to use lofty, bathetic language, and the words "the world has never seen its parallel" are presented in quotation marks, as was Emanuel's biblical reference ear- lier. In both cases, the use of the biblical allusion is not typical. True, Michael and Emanuel make use of biblical Hebrew, but the specific biblical contexts of this lan- guage are not relevant to the text at hand. What is relevant is the fact that the char- acters use florid expressions, which are not part and parcel of their natural speech. The embedded biblical expressions are vestiges of obsolete language that has lost its vitality and can now be used only in quotes, as is attested by the punctuation. Allelim contains few biblical allusions; it does, however, abound in allusions to children's poetry familiar to the protagonists from their early years, to authors they have read (Joyce, Borges, Musil, Faulkner, and others), and to movies. There is also a tribute to Amos Oz's A Perfect Peace.6 In order to appreciate the differ- ence between the use Heffner makes of biblical allusions and that of Hebrew writ- ers of earlier generations, let us examine briefly the function of allusions in Oz's novel. Yonatan, the protagonist of A Perfect Peace, leaves his native kibbutz and goes on a journey to the ancient city of Petra in Jordan. When he gets up in the morning after his first night in the desert, Yonatan experiences exuberance and gratitude. "The dawn chill was sharp and bracing. Yonatan put on his jacket, wrapped himself in the blanket with the solemnity of a Jew donning a prayer shawl, 4. Ibid., p. 265. 5. Ibid., p. 261. 6. Ibid., p. 188. 190</page><page sequence="3">Biblical Allusions in Modem and Postmodern Hebrew Literature and raised his eyes to the mountains in the east."' That Yonatan should wrap him- self as if in a prayer shawl, face eastward-the direction of Jerusalem-and lift his eyes to the mountains is rather curious. It brings to mind the Psalmist seeking God's help: "I will lift up mine eyes unto the mountains whence cometh my help" (Psalms 121:1). Unlike Heffner's Allelim, here the biblical allusion is an integral element of the scene. Standing before the open expanses, Yonatan is filled with a sense of belonging ("Here, praise be, I've come home at last") and gratitude ("Thank you for all this beauty. For Michal. Thank you for every breath"), as well as with a desire to kneel "or make a deep bow." The description of sunrise that fol- lows also contains strong religious overtones. Furthermore, the allusion to Psalms in this passage is part of a rich fabric of biblical allusions that characterizes this novel as a whole. Thus, for example, Yonatan's wish to give thanks for "every breath" (in Hebrew: kol neshima) echoes his father, Yolek, who feels that nature it- self pities "all the soul" (in Hebrew: kol haneshama). Walking in the kibbutz yard at night, Yolek experiences a renewed contact with the cosmos, and the depiction of the night sky, from his point of view, abounds in religious connotations. The re- ligious nature of his experience finds expression in these lines: "Nature itself, as it were, cares for all the soul and gives a certain number of mother years even to a bad-hearted intellectual."8 The expression "all the soul" stands out as an unusual locution (in this context one would expect to find "every soul" or "all souls"), and in the mind of a man with religious upbringing such as Yolek, there can be no doubt that the phrase refers to the last verse in the book of Psalms, "Let all the soul (usu- ally rendered "everything that has breath") praise the Lord." As I will argue below, this religious experience, which is typical of Oz's work, is not connected at all to institutionalized Jewish faith, but, rather, to a spiritual quest that appeared in He- brew literature in the late 1950s and the 1960s. The numerous biblical references included in the novel have two main functions. First, Oz, like Agnon before him, regards traditional texts (mainly Jewish sources, but also Christian ones, as well as Greek mythology) as a reser- voir of themes and symbols that can be used to enhance the text and invest it with additional layers of meaning. Thus, A Perfect Peace clearly encourages the read- er to draw an analogy between the triad of Yolek, his son Yonatan, and the out- sider Azariah and the biblical triad of Saul, his son Jonathan, and David. This analogy gives the father-son relationships portrayed in the novel a broader sig- nificance. Second, the biblical references are an integral aspect of the theme of the nov- el: Yonatan's journey to Petra turns out to be a religious quest. Half a dozen times throughout the novel Yonatan repeats the verse, "But their hearts were not true," deriving from Psalms 78, wherein the poet describes people who only pretend to believe in God. Having abandoned his plan to reach Petra, Yonatan remains in the desert where he reflects: "I'm now beginning to understand. And my heart is get- 7.

The scriptural allusions fit right in with the religious yearning that char- acterized the writing of many of these authors. The source of this yearning constitutes one of the main differences between the literary works of the 1940s, on the one hand, and the late 1950s and the 1960s on the other. In the forties, the struggle for the establishment of the state of Israel invest- ed life in then-Palestine with a special meaning and created a sense of existential plenitude: the ubiquitous "togetherness" of youth movements, settlement units, military service, and the kibbutz fostered identification with the country and its society. This identification conferred upon the writers of the "Palmach generation" a sense of belonging and closeness that shielded them from existential experiences such as a confrontation with an indifferent or hostile world, loneliness, and fears of mortality. The predominant Israeli Labor movement provided these authors with a solid ethical code, which, while allowing for occasional doubts and soul-search- ing, was at the same time the very framework within which those doubts could be discussed and thrashed out. This situation underwent a radical change soon after the War of Indepen- dence. The fifties saw a decrease in the previously prevalent sense of existential plenitude, and with it a disintegration of the ethical structure that had sustained the earlier decade.'I For a whole group of writers (who, chronologically, belong to the younger of the "Palmach generation"), the emerging void led to a search for the meaning and justification of life. A quest for lost harmony-on personal, social, and metaphysical levels-became a major feature of the new Hebrew fiction. Re- ligious yearnings first emerged in the works of writers born in the mid-twenties (Pinhas Sade, Amalia Kahana-Carmon, David Shahar, Yitzhak Orpaz, and Yoram Kaniuk), who started publishing their fiction in the late 1950's. At the beginning of the sixties, these yearnings resurfaced in the main themes of Oz and Appelfeld. A. B. Yehoshua was the only one among the "New Wave" writers who immediate- ly recognized the force of this trend and who criticized it obliquely in his early sto- ries and later in his critical essays.'2 9.

I dealt with this trend in my article "Secularity and Religiosity in Contemporary Hebrew Literature," Middle Eastern Literatures 1 (2002): 63-82. 192</page><page sequence="5">Biblical Allusions in Modem and Postmodern Hebrew Literature One has to bear in mind that Agnon's influence on Hebrew fiction was at its peak when the "New Wave" writers began publishing their stories.'3 Agnon's work is characterized by highly-literary, rich Hebrew: a language that has no direct or necessary connection to spoken Hebrew. In Chomsky's well-known terms, this per- ception of the language of literature assumes no connection between linguistic competence and linguistic performance. In fact, in the texts of the writers of the sixties, we find a distinct separation between the language of the narrators and the language of the characters. The language used in dialogues is closer to colloquial Hebrew, whereas the language of the narrators is usually a highly stylized, literary Hebrew that bears little resemblance to the spoken idiom. Moreover, Agnon's lit- erary practices taught the younger writers that a literary text should be as dense and packed with meaning as possible; in other words, a desired literary work is a multilayered text that does not lend itself to easy interpretation, but, rather, calls for an elaborate act of decoding. The use of biblical allusions was one of the means of achieving this goal. In the examples from A Perfect Peace cited above, we not- ed that the simple act of raising one's eyes to the mountains links the protagonist to the Psalmist seeking assistance from God, and uttering words of thanks "for every breath" connects him to the concluding verse of the book of Psalms. The same process can be found in the works of Kahana-Carmon and Appelfeld. Just as the title of Oz's novel, Menuha Nehona, is a reference to Jewish prayer, so the ti- tle of Kahana-Carmon's first novel is a reference to a biblical verse.14 The protag- onists of Kahana-Carmon's early stories often relate to biblical contexts. Thus, for example, in the climactic scene of her most famous story "Ne'ima Sasson Kotevet Shirim" ("Neima Sasson Writes Poems"), the protagonist hears God's answer to Job (38:4-19), and some of the biblical text is interwoven throughout the story. 15 Appelfeld also uses biblical phrases for the titles of his novels (see, for example, 'Al Kol Peshacim [For Every Sin, cf. Proverbs 10: 12] and Mikhvat Ha'or [The Burn- ing Light, cf. Leviticus 25:24]). 6 Appelfeld's narratives are replete with references to Jewish sources (mainly Kaballistic and Hassidic, not necessarily biblical.)'7 III One can conclude, then, that biblical allusions fit in well with the religious quest that engaged the writers of the "New Wave."'8 Furthermore, the allusions 13. The affinity of the "New Wave" writers for Agnon is amply demonstrated in the style of their early works. It is no accident that the few critical studies they published include extensive dis- cussions of Agnon's work. 14.

Yehoshua is a conspicuous exception in this regard; Biblical al- lusions in his stories and novels are usually related to the societal and political themes of the works. 193</page><page sequence="6">Avraham Balaban enabled those writers to create literary texts that were rich in texture and packed with layers of meanings. This was achieved, in part, through the discrepancy be- tween the language of the narrators and the language of the characters. "Postmodernist" Hebrew fiction, however, is markedly different from the "New Wave" in all three aspects previously mentioned.19 Here we have a literature that emphasizes its secular nature and does not accede to demands that the literary text be rich, compact, and rife with meaning. The diction of the narrators in this fiction is identical to that of their characters. A brief examination of the novel Reshimotav hanistarot shel Sgani [The Se- cret Notes of My Deputy],20 by Haim Lapid, one of the harbingers of the "post- modernist" wave, can shed light on the transition that took place in Hebrew fiction in the mid-eighties. The novel portrays the anxieties of the narrator when he real- izes that he has no solid foundation for determining which of two conflicting in- terpretations of reality is true and valid and which is false and erroneous. There is a hint in the novel that the Christian faith of one of the central characters may be the missing foundation, but this faith itself is presented as one manifestation of an ontological crisis, not as a remedy. In fact, an important distinguishing mark com- mon to the numerous works published a few years after Lapid's novel is their bla- tantly secular nature. Three examples will suffice to illustrate this point. In Heffner's latest nov- els, the author repeatedly asserts that religious belief is nothing but a child's fairy tale, a refuge for people who refuse to confront a reality, which is, by nature, mon- strous and horrifying. The reality depicted in these novels is mostly fragmented, chaotic, arbitrary, and devoid of meaning, logic, or purpose. What do the protag- onists believe in? Here is an example: I believe that there is no God. One. I believe that history has no meaning, none whatsoever. Two. I don't believe in the existence of any higher purpose that mankind is supposed to attain, not in the triumph of Light over Darkness, nor in any other form of utopia.21 The desire to understand reality is presented in these novels as a primal force, as a thirst or passion, but the protagonists find themselves facing a chaotic, meaning- 19. As a major trend in Hebrew literature, "postmodernism" seems to have emerged in the mid- eighties with the publication of works such as Haim Lapid's Reshimotav hanistarot shel sgani [The Se- cret Notes of My Deputy] (Tel Aviv: Sifriat Poalim, 1983), David Grossman's "A'yen erekh ahava [See Under Love] (Tel Aviv: Hakibbutz Hameuchad, 1986), Anton Shamas's Arabeskot [Arabesques] (Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 1986), Orly Castel-Bloom's Lo rahok mimerkaz ha'ir [Not Far From the Center of Town] (Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 1987), Avram Heffner's Kolel Hakol [Including Everything] (Jerusalem: Keter, 1988), Yoel Hoffmann's Sefer Yoseph [The Book ofJoseph] (Jerusalem: Keter:, 1988), and Meir Shalev's Roman Russi [The Blue Mountain] (Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 1988) . The subsequent works of most of these authors (Grossman is a noticeable exception) continued to exhibit the "postmodernist" char- acteristics of the new trend. The movement grew in number and strength when a new wave of young and not so young authors joined in, among them Yuval Shimoni, Etgar Keret, Leah Ayalon, Yitzhak Laor, Avner Shatz, Nurit Zarhi, Aner Shalev, and many others. 20.

They realize that science, too, cannot properly explain reality, and that scientific truths are no more valid than religious truths: Then science and art (scientists and artists) came to the rescue: We're heroes! We'll save you! Don't cry, children. We're here. We're better than God Al- mighty ... This is humbug of the same magnitude as 'I am your Lord, King of the universe.' It is just as true as the other one, and both of them .. .are fraud, a false promise to those who cannot face the bitter truth, i.e., that we are or- phans, that we were hurled. . .into a meaningless, orderless universe.22 The protagonists of Orly Castel-Bloom's stories are not given to philosoph- ical ruminations like Heffner's characters are, but they are beset by the same ques- tions. Let us take, for example, the title story in Lo rahok mi-merkaz ha'ir [Not Far From the Center of Town].23 At first glance, it is a story about marital crisis: Avishai and Dahlia are newlyweds taking their first steps as a married couple: painting their apartment, arranging the furniture, settling into their shared life, and fighting. But behind this simple plot, the author examines every possible source of meaning, and rejects them one by one. The possible religious solution is developed gradually throughout the story. The narrator describes Avishai as an atheist, and yet, twice in the story, he is seen turning to God for help. First, having found the sky boring and the cosmos indifferent, he goes outside and starts walking towards a nearby syna- gogue. He stares at it, trying "to get something out of the synagogue, but does not feel anything."24 Later he turns to the synagogue as to a refuge, and this time he is not motivated by a sense of meaningless void, but by a pressing need: a cancer rid- den neighbor is dying, and the medics are reluctant to help her. When her son starts crying, Avishai is overwhelmed by the sight, and dashes out into the street. The only salvation the street can offer him is the synagogue, which "stood there like the only solution."25 Avishai asks the congregation to pray for the dying neighbor, but when he gets back to the sick woman's apartment, he finds out that she has passed away while the congregants were praying for her recovery. Castel-Bloom cuts off her protagonist from any source of meaningful exis- tence. He is alienated from himself, from his family (both parents and wife), and from his immediate surroundings, as well as from the vast expanses of the cosmos. His desperate appeal to God remains equally unanswered. The author annihilates the protagonist's self-identity and denies him any chance of finding salvation in love, nature, or God. All he is left with at the end is a cumbersome, restless exis- tence, the fear of death, and the final gnawing realization that his life "is ruined, simply ruined."26 Dan Miron captured Castel-Bloom's world succinctly: "Orly Castel-Bloom rejects any illusion of depth-in language, culture, human experience, the psyche, society, tradition, the past. She sees only a thin, shallow, insipid and lifeless reali- 22. Allelim, p. 269. 23. Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 1987. 24. Ibid., p. 27. 25. Ibid., p. 38. 26. Ibid., p. 38. 195</page><page sequence="8">Avraham Balaban ty, consisting of automatic existence with an abyss of chaos lurking underneath."27 This is an apt and accurate description of the works of many of the authors men- tioned earlier.28 Here is one last example. One of the few references to the Bible in Laor's Am, ma'akhal melakhim [The People, food fit for a King] changes the biblical text and replaces the divine presence with that of a human being. Echoing Jacob's re- alization that "Surely, the Lord is in this place" (Genesis 28:16), Laor's narrator declares on the second page of the novel that "Surely, there is a man in this place."29 The replacement of "God" with "man" is well connected to the antireligious theme that is expressed throughout the novel. It is also strongly linked to the anger that is directed at the army commanders, who despise and revile their subordinates, and to the narrator's conviction regarding the paramount importance of human life. The texts of Heffner and Castel-Bloom make it clear that the flattening of the characters and their experiential world is integrally associated with the flat- tening of the language: the dense, multifaceted, suggestive language of the sixties was supplanted by a loose, emaciated, single-layered language that does not, how- ever, eschew redundancy and self-explanatory descriptions.30 In Castel-Bloom's aforementioned story, one finds many seemingly redundant details and descrip- tions that do not shed new light on the character or the theme. "It was a friend of Dahlia's from the Intensive Care Unit who called to ask her what if felt like to be a married woman, and to chat a little. Dahlia chatted with her. Avishai, in the mean- time, turned on the television"31; "She asked Avishai to hug her. Avishai hugged her. Her body was warm and in some places damp, because she was sweating"32 "The door creaked, and Dahlia said she was going, and was gone."33 The infor- mation contained in phrases such as "Dahlia chatted with her," "Avishai hugged her," or, in the final verb of the last example-"and was gone"-is redundant and self explanatory, precisely the kind of information the "New Wave" writers took pains to eschew. The importance of the above-quoted details is precisely in their redundancy, which underscores the vague, indefinite, almost automatic existence that the characters are leading. By and large, most "New Wave" fiction is told by an omniscient narrator.34 27. Dan Miron "Mashehu al Orly Castel-Bloom" [Something about Orly Castel-Bloom], Al Hamishmar, June 16, 1989. 28. Miron's insights call to mind some of Fredric Jameson's arguments in his famous article, "Postmodernism, or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism" (New Left Review 146, 1984:53-93). Ac- cording to Jameson, postmodernist discourse rejects out of hand the five basic models of depth: the hermeneutic model of inside or outside, the dialectic model of essence and appearance, the Freudian model of latent and manifest, the existential model of authenticity and unauthenticity, and the semiotic opposition of signifier and signified. 29.

The language of the omniscient narrator was, for the most part, rich literary Hebrew that made use of the various strata of the language, mining its abundant lodes to fashion the desired vocabulary; they re- garded those deposits as a treasure house of allusions and nuances, whereas the language of the characters was much closer to spoken Hebrew.35 An examination of the works of the "postmodernist" writers, however, reveals an entirely different kind of narrator. The sense of living in a chaotic reality, devoid of meaning or cer- tainty, has led to the disappearance of the omniscient narrator. Instead, most nov- els and stories are told by first-person narrators who readily proclaim their limitations; their narrow, distorted angle of vision: What is reality, Brava scoffed to himself. .. .What is it but one person telling you something, then saying, 'Listen, that was a lie,' retracting what he has just said; then, a few moments later, he says to you again, 'Listen, that was a lie too,' retracting what he has just said, and then apologizes and says, 'Sorry, that was a lie too,' and so it goes, on and on, indefinitely, until you no longer know what to think.36 Even when the narratives are recounted in the third person-these are most- ly short stories (by Orly Castel-Bloom, Etgar Keret, Nurit Zarhi)-the narrator's point of view is hardly wider than that of the characters. Most importantly, the lan- guage of the narrator is the language of the characters. Here, the cinematic educa- tion of most of these writers comes to the fore: the Hebrew they use appeals to the ear; it does not strive for richness or complexity, but rather for accuracy and au- thenticity. Let us look at one typical example. In colloquial Hebrew, the expression "vehakol" ("and everything") serves as a short way to sum up information known to both the speaker and the listener. In Avram Heffner's Allelim, one of the char- acters, Schwartz, tells Emanuel about a scene he saw on television "with the beat- ings and everything."37 Similarly, the narrator describes Michael watching the movie Blade Runner as "tense and everything,"38 and Emanuel finishing "to take a shower and everything."39 The vocabulary of the narrator and the characters be- long to the same register; they make the same grammatical mistakes and use the same grammatical structures, typical of contemporary native speakers of Hebrew. Naturally, "postmodernist" fiction is not uniform. The above-mentioned general- ization applies to a large segment of "postmodernist" Hebrew fiction, but not to all of it. Writers such as Yuval Shimoni, Yitzhak Laor, and Itamar Levi use rich, highly literary language. harim [Late Divorce] (Tel Aviv: Hakibbutz Hameuchad, 1982] and Mar Mani [Mr. Mani] (Tel Aviv: Hakibbutz Hameuchad, 1990), is not exploited for the creation of a world of partial, relative truths. This is discussed in detail in my study Mar Molkho [Mr. Molkho] (Tel Aviv: Hakibbutz Hameuchad, 1991). 35. This tendency is discussed in Shaked's studies mentioned above in n. 11. 36.

Ibid., p. 176. 197</page><page sequence="10">Avraham Balaban There is a fundamental difference between the "postmodernist" writers' use of familiar texts and the allusions that their predecessors incorporated in their texts. As we noted in the example from Oz's work, the earlier generation regarded tradi- tional texts as a reservoir of themes and symbols that could be used to amplify the text and broaden its meaning. The new authors, on the other hand, refer their read- ers to modem texts, and make use of colloquial expressions and phrases that are taken from popular media in order to stress the "textuality" of their characters and as a means of flattening the language and the reality it reflects. Thus, one does not find biblical allusions here; only biblical quotations, which do not intensify the lan- guage, but, rather, flatten it, exposing it as a second-hand expression. Time and again, the "postmodernist" authors emphasize the importance of language in shap- ing their characters.40 At the same time, they underscore the important role images of popular culture (cinema and television movies, commercials, video clips) have in molding the protagonists' world. IV To sum up, then, "postmodernist" Hebrew fiction depicts protagonists for whom the Bible, its language and its characters, form no part of their experience and Weltanschauung. Yet, the Bible has not completely disappeared from post- modern Hebrew literature, as attested by the works of Meir Shalev and Nurit Zarhi, among others. Meir Shalev occupies a special place in this context. On the one hand, he is a practitioner of "magic realism" (a la Marques), one of the popular genres of post- modernism. On the other hand, Shalev not only creates strong links and affinities between his characters and biblical characters, but he also strews his novels with a plethora of verses and biblical idioms, a practice reminiscent of the writers of the Haskala. In an interview, Shalev recounted how, in his childhood, his father, the poet and novelist Yitzhak Shalev, used to take him on walks every Saturday, with the Bible serving as their guidebook. He went on to say that, to this day, he is in the habit of reading the Bible, just as others read literary or psychological texts.41 The interview appeared on the eve of the publication of Esau,42 a novel that un- derscores the author's affinity for the Bible, not only in its title, but also in its dramatis personae-centering on the biblical triad of Jacob, Esau, and Leah-and in the numerous direct and indirect allusions, quotations and references to chap- ters and verses of the Bible. "Speak, memory," the narrator exhorts himself, al- luding to Nabokov's famous memoir. It soon becomes clear that the narrator's memories derive from the novels of Thomas Mann and Melville, among others, but they also include references to the prophet Jeremiah. "Speak, memory! Speak on and on. Draw from the deep well of Thomas Mann, sail on the warm seas of 40. Childhood stories and songs play a major role in this regard (notably, in the works of Yoel Hoffman, Avram Heffner, and Haim Lapid). 41.

In order to create the effect of magical realism, Shalev invented a narrator who is nothing but a "bag of yarns and tall tales"45 who is addicted to the stories of his grandfather and his contemporaries and who tends to fill the missing parts in the stories with his own imagination.46 Moreover, when confronted with a choice of several versions, the narrator always opts for the most fantastical, magical one, and he resents being bothered by the facts.47 Indeed, his penchant for exaggeration in- vests the entire plot with an aura of fantasy.48 Fontanelle bears the same hallmarks. The narrator, Michael, recounts the story of his life, which spans the second part of the twentieth century, and thereby unfolds the story of his extended family, the Joffes, from the day his grandparents came to live in the Valley of Jezreel. Predictably, the information is part realism part fantasy (the narrator's unclosed fontanelle has endowed him with the gift of prophecy; the grandfather carries his bride on his back all the way from the coastal plane to the valley; one of the cousins is raised in a poultry incubator, and toward the end, it is the shrunken grandfather who is kept in the incubator). The narrator obtains most of his information from his aunt, Rachel. This aunt became a widow at an early age, and since then has been unable to fall asleep without huddling with a member of the family in her bed. Michael has been happy to oblige, in order to hear her stories. As is often the case in "postmodernist" literature, we have here a reality that questions its own veracity, a "second-hand" reality. The grandfather is fond of telling tall tales,49 and Rachel transmits the old man's tales to his grand- child. The Bible is in evidence on every level of this novel: in the characters' names and in their associative links to their biblical counterparts (and sometimes by in- version: the grandfather, David, is associated with biblical King David on several occasions, but also with Saul, who needed David to play music for him).50 The Bible is present in the plot, which has many parallels with biblical chronicles, and in the narrator's style, which embeds biblical verses and idioms liberally. In order to rationalize this style, the author endows Aunt Rachel with special love for the 43. Ibid, p. 195. 44. Meir Shalev, Fontanela [Fontanelle] (Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 2002). 45.

In his article "Uma shlom haverenu vehavrotenu" ["And How are Our Friends Doing?"] (Kol Ha'ir, June 10, 1988) Ariel Hirschfeld argues convincingly that the illusion of fantasy in the nov- el is achieved through the use of hyperbolic triangles. 49.

The narrator, in fact, asserts that Rachel's manner of expression and his are superior to that of the rest of the family; hers due to her unbounded love of Tchernichovsky's poetry, and his due to her tutelage.52 In this manner, the novel justifies the fact that Rachel, who tells Michael the story of his family, puts biblical verses and medita- tions on biblical characters into the mouths of the various members,53 and draws analogies between them and biblical personages. For instance, she describes how her father, David, fought for his wife's survival, and indirectly compares his strug- gle to David fighting Goliath.54 Michael avers that Rachel's phrases remind him of biblical verses, and biblical verses evoke in him Rachel's stories, and then there are verses whose provenance he can no longer tell for sure.55 Thus, the stories of the Bible and the stories of the family are inextricably woven together. Michael himself has absorbed the biblical style to such an extent that bibli- cal phrases trip off his tongue in the form of bound expressions. Thus, for instance, he describes three-year-old Gabriel's first day at play-school. The child is terrified to be left alone without his grandfather and falls to the ground, trembling. But in Michael's parlance, he does not just fall down, he "bowed, he fell, he lay down,"56 a collocation of verbs that immediately calls to mind Sisera, smitten by Yael, lying dead at her feet (Judges 5:27). Michael's narration is strewn with biblical idioms, and in many instances they contribute to the metaphoric texture of his language.57 The biblical allusions are interconnected, creating a subtext that is crucial to the interpretation of the novel. Several allusions, for example, link the figure of the woman to a deity, thus magnifying and empowering her.58 Some other characteristics of Shalev's use of biblical stories and idioms are worth noting: " Unlike the fiction of the "New Wave," here, the biblical allusions are not motivated by any religious yearning. Moreover, as seen earlier in the de- scription of the terrified child, who "bowed, fell and lay down," in many in- stances the biblical context is not really relevant to the story. In fact, when the narrator describes his daughter as one whose "hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against" her (echoing the description of Ishmael in Genesis 16: 12), he hastens to add that he is not using this ex- pression in its biblical sense.59 * As noted earlier, the novel is written in the genre of magical realism, which 51.

For instance, an old house that refuses to be demolished is described as "holding on to the horns of its yard" (a reference to the "horns of the altar") (p. 288), and the bow of Hirsch's violin is com- pared to an "ox goad" (cf. Judges 3:31). Scores of similar examples can be found throughout the book. 58. Fontanela, p. 64. 59. Ibid., p. 18. 200</page><page sequence="13">Biblical Allusions in Modem and Postmodern Hebrew Literature makes extensive use of hyperbole. The biblical associations fit right in with the hyperbolic propensity of the text: quite often, the author uses the bibli- cal context to increase and amplify the effect of the description. Hence, the numerous references to the Song of Solomon.60 When the narrator wishes to poke fun at his mother, a fanatical proselytizing vegetarian, he uses a biblical allusion to underscore her self-righteous zeal. There she is, robust and athletic despite her advanced age, walking the street, and "righ- teousness shall go before her" (echoing Psalms 85: 13).61 In order to un- derscore the sense of loss and nostalgia for the past that the narrator experiences, he uses the prophet Isaiah's vineyard metaphor to describes the neglected family orchard: "all eaten up by wild animals and trodden down"62 (cf. Isaiah 5:5)63 When the narrator sits down to recount the family history, he reminds him- self to do so "without fear or shame, and above all, with humor"64. Indeed, humor and playfulness are the hallmarks of Shalev's style. The playful, droll effect is often achieved through interplay with the biblical context, re- sulting in some kind of ironic reversal. Thus, the biblical apostrophe, "Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth" (I Samuel 3:10) becomes here an ironic comment of a grown-up addressing a child,65 and the little girl who "has no breasts" is not a sister (as in Song of Solomon 8:8) but, rather, the narrator's daughter.66 Throughout the novel, there are many more examples of this practice, which conforms to the "postmodernist" trend of quoting from earlier texts. Nurit Zarhi uses the Bible differently. Like many "postmodernist" writers who recycle existing stories, Zarhi retells several biblical plots. Her first collec- tion of short stories combines fantasy with psychological realism in order to ex- amine topics such as identity and gender.67 The plots of these stories are reinterpretations of familiar accounts, such as the story of the Hebrew writer Dvo- ra Baron, or the circumstances surrounding the composition of Mozart's "Re- quiem." The first and last stories in the collections are intriguing reworkings of familiar biblical plots. The first story, "She was Joseph," presents the Genesis sto- ry of Joseph in a new guise. In Zarhi's story, Joseph turns out to be a girl whose mother raised her as a boy in order to please her husband who longed for a son. 60. Ibid., pp. 54, 420, 470, and elsewhere. 61. Ibid., p. 215. 62. Ibid., p. 471. 63. One of the only other "postmodernist" authors who uses biblical phrases to enhance his text is Laor (see, for example, Am Ma'akhal Melakhim, pp. 8, 492). Laor does not hesitate to use the "bib- lical future tense" to convey a general mode, as well as verbs, adjectives, and adverbs that are biblical or quasi-biblical, such as "likrav," p. 174 (instead of the common 'lehitkarev'); "befahaz," p. 246; or "imado," p. 198 (instead of the more common 'imo'). 64.

And the coat-for one regards oneself as sim- ply a person-was neither feminine nor masculine, or rather both feminine and masculine.69 As can be expected in "postmodernist" fiction, the author presents the plot as a hy- pothetical construct. She asks rhetorically what became of the girl who was thrown into a pit by her brothers, and offers some hypothetical answers. First, Josepha's father knew the truth about her and kept an eye on her from afar; perhaps it was he who rescued her from the pit. According to this version, Joseph who ended up in Pharaoh's palace in Egypt, must have been "some political story, like the one writ- ten by the German author about a very distant relative who found himself at the court, rose to prominence and came to his relatives' help."70 Second, "if indeed the girl Joseph was rescued from the pit, not by her father but by the Ishmaelites ... then we can picture her lying in bed ... keeping her secret-the secret of her dou- ble life."71 In the last story in the collection, "Beyond Psalms," Abishag the Shunamite recounts how she killed King David with the help of her lover, Adonijah. Her ac- count is replete with biblical verses culled from II Samuel, I Kings, Song of Solomon, and I Chronicles. Abishag claims that it was she, disguised as the late king, who promised Bathsheba that her son, Solomon, would succeed David on the throne. Again, this being "postmosternist" fiction, the author makes no attempt at realistic verisimilitude. The end of the story implies that the narrator delivers the entire text to the sleeping Solomon. She wonders if it behooves a narrator to tally his story to the expectations of the listener.72 Similarly she muses, "Does the nar- rator draw on his/her experience or non-experience, inventing what's missing and transforming it into a reality?"73 This last quote raises the possibility that part of the story she tells the king is pure fabrication. The lovely ending of the story also suggests that the story is inseparable from its narrator. V We have seen, then, that "postmodern" fiction has little use for biblical al- lusions. Its secular worldview, emphasizing the arbitrary, accidental nature of ex- istence and the flat, one-level quality of its texts, render the biblical context 68. Ibid., p. 8. 69. Ibid., p. 9. 70.

Hence, biblical allusions are rarely found in this literature. Yet, the Bible is not altogether absent from "postmodernist" Hebrew fiction. As the works of Shalev and Zarhi attest, it survives in places where it does not conflict with cen- tral "postmodernist" trends, but, rather, complements them. Thus, despite losing its religious content, the biblical stories are still narratives that can be recycled and retold, or transferred (in Shalev's work) to modern Israel. Biblical stories and id- ioms contribute in Shalev's novels to the fantastic, magic element, as well as to the playfulness, irony, and humor that typify his style.
