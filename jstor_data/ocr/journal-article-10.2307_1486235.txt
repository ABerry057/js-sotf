<plain_text><page sequence="1">WARDING OFF CHAOS: REPETITION AND OBSESSION IN THE POETRY OF GLATSHTEYN, HALPERN, AND MANGER by JANET HADDA -Umetum geven un gevan / Mit di eygene oygn alts gezan. -Dzhin dzhin bum bum bum / Dzhin dzhin bum. -Keyner veyst nit vos ikh zog / Keyner veyst nit vos ikh vil. For as long as I have been acquainted with them, the poems in which the above lines occur have held a peculiar fascination for me. With their rhyth- mic refrains, Glatshteyn's "Der Rayzeman" ("The Travelman"), Halpern's "Der Gasnpoyker" ("The Street Drummer"), and Manger's "Eynzam" ("Lonely") are lodged in my mind,' cropping up periodically in almost- and in the case of "Eynzam," literally-musical form.2 Yet it is only recently 1. Please see Appendix for working translations of the poems in their entirety. The transla- tions are my own. 2. I am referring here to a famous musical setting of"Eynzam." Incidentally, Dr. Jonathan Boyarin has called my attention to the fact that there is also a musical rendition of "Der Gasn- poyker" which he heard in Paris, but this is not part of my personal experience. 81</page><page sequence="2">82 JANET HADDA that I have come to see a special connection between these three diverse works. The present article explores this connection. Specifically, I wish to address the function of repetition and show how a much-used poetic device simultaneously points to a psychological realm otherwise easy to ignore.3 "Der Rayzeman," "Der Gasnpoyker," and "Eynzam" have in common a first-person narrative voice that indicates, in each case, a particular per- sona: a purported world traveler, a rowdy one-man band, a lonely drinker, respectively. As such, the lines that occur and reoccur throughout are the poetic equivalent of a person's speech and, by extension, suggest the verbali- zation of repeated thoughts. In psychoanalytic-and, by now, common- parlance, the term "obsessive" is often used to refer to thoughts that occur over and over, seemingly unbidden, as distinct from equivalent behaviors, including speech, that are termed "compulsive." I wish to illustrate poetic repetition as an artistic, controlled evocation of obsessive ideas and con- comitant compulsive action. It seems to me that the meanings of obsessional thoughts and compulsive behavior are not as uniform as has been heretofore understood. Thus, Freud viewed the phenomenon as an indication of ambivalence, a compromise whereby unconscious, murderous, impulses towards the oedipally rivalrous parent arise continuously, only to be undone again. The underlying concept of Freud's metapsychology-although not necessarily of his technical interventions-is that development occurs intrapsychically, that is, within a closed system. While Freud's case studies, 3. For a post-Freudian discussion of repetition that makes use of literary examples as well, see Hans A. Thorner, "On Repetition, Its Relationship to the Depressive Position," Interna- tional Journal of Psycho-Analysis 66 (1985): 231-236. As its title implies, this article is based on the theories of Melanie Klein. I cite it as an example of interest in the problem of repetitive behavior, but I cannot recommend its findings as especially useful. In contrast, see John Hollander, "Breaking into Song," in Lyric Poetry Beyond New Criti- cism, ed. Chaviva Hosek and Patricia Parker (Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1985), pp. 73-89. Hollander presents a lively and lucid commentary on some of the deeper meanings and effects of the poetic refrain. Specifically, he seeks to explore the ways in which refrains serve more than a schematic function. I am in agreement with Hollander's formulation that "Poetic refrain . . . starts out by troping the literalness of the repetition, by raising a central parabolic question for all textual refrain: Does repeating something at intervals make it impor- tant, or less so?" (p. 75; emphasis Hollander's). My point in this essay is that the repetitions I discuss make what is said more important, rather than less so, but in a particular way. That is, they signal an underlying malaise without explicitly describing it. As the poem progresses, the repetitions cause the reader to focus on the urgency of the malaise and to fill in the meanings that are implied.</page><page sequence="3">GLATSHTEYN, HALPERN, AND MANGER 83 formal and selective though they may be, indicate his understanding of interpersonal relations as essential influences in the growing child's life, his theoretical stance remained remarkably devoid of such insight.4 Since Freud's initial pioneering contributions, there have, understanda- bly, been refinements and alterations of, as well as disagreements with, his ideas. The most profound has been the move away from the notion that the essential issues in development are relatively impervious to outside influence. The British object relations school, with such notable analysts as Guntrip, Fairbairn and-in a class by himself-the brilliantly sensitive Win- nicott, did much to inform the psychoanalytic world that the infant is born into a realm of relationships. As Winnicott put it: "There is no such thing as a baby. .. . if you set out to describe a baby, you will find you are describing a baby and someone."5 Recent work involving infant observation has cor- roborated these theoretical ideas. Over the last twenty or so years, a new theoretical and technical approach has had a profound influence on psychoanalytic thought. Gal- vanized by the provocative writings of Heinz Kohut, who coined the term "self-psychology," many clinicians have come to question some of Freud's core precepts. Most profound has been the rejection of classical drive theory in favor of one based on the earliest successes or failures of parent/child interaction. A key contribution of Kohut's theory is his notion of the self- object, a provider of specific functions for the infant.6 Put simply, the growing child needs to feel both admired and acknow- ledged as a powerful and grand individual and, simultaneously, needs to know that he/she can feel as one with a calm, strong image of infallibility. These qualities, when suitably provided, lead to healthy self-esteem and the development of goals, values, and ideals. If they are not provided, the result will be a core self that is damaged to varying degrees and in a variety of ways, depending on the nature of the selfobject failure. 4.

In the first case, symptoms include lack of vitality and a sense of pervasive, empty depression. In the second case, the individual typically suffers from a lack of self-cohesion, a feeling that he/she is somehow less than whole. My own perspective in these pages is strongly influenced by the perspectives of object relations and self-psychology. Freud's view of obsession was, of course, rooted in his ideas of aggressive energy and the pre-eminence of sexual drives. In my clinical practice, I have found that obsessive thoughts serve a strikingly different purpose: they fill an empty place for the understimulated or fragmenting self, where an experience of having been loved and accepted as a unique and valued human being has failed to occur. These thoughts, like the structure-producing refrains of poetry, create a measure of order and stability, simultaneously shielding the thinker from the unbearable lack. The following are but a few examples: Ms. A: "Thinking about buying that land is like a sponge, soak- ing up all my depression and sadness." Dr. B: "When I feel insecure, I read over my reports again and again to reassure myself." (This comment came shortly after the patient had described an empty space in herself which she longed to fill with the attentions of a lover.) And, the following words of Mr. C, after some working through of his intense involvement with thinking: "I enjoy the experience of having feelings in your presence, but I can't think at the same time. I don't know why I'm crying. It's relief... It's OK to feel awful." In each case, the patients I have quoted used certain ideas as a means of self-soothing and of achieving solace. What knowledge had they been hiding from? Mr. C: "For as long as I can remember, I never wanted anything from my mother"; Dr. B: "I don't remember being taken away from my mother. Nothing good goes unpunished"; and Ms. A: "In order to survive, I had to not exist."7 Put somewhat differently, my patients had spent a lifetime protecting themselves against a perception of inner chaos or lack of self-cohesion. This underlying framework of experience is, as I have already suggested, the result of an early failure to receive crucial affirming responses. That is, the child's natural strivings to be recognized as important and therefore valua- ble, and, at the same time, to enjoy a bond with a strong parental figure, did 7. In order to ensure confidentiality, I have changed certain identifying details in these vignettes.</page><page sequence="5">GLATSHTEYN, HALPERN, AND MANGER 85 not meet with appropriate acceptance and understanding. In such cases, the child cannot proceed to develop within a context of self-reliance and auton- omy, on one hand, and a secure sense of interpersonal connection, on the other. He or she is thus prey to feelings of weakness, worthlessness, empti- ness, and isolation. While I am concentrating, in this essay, on obsessive thinking as a mani- festation of psychological self-protection, there are other forms such safe- guarding may take. Some of these-for instance denial, symptom forma- tion, and the ability to remember unpleasant events without recalling the painful affects associated with them-may, like obsessive thinking itself, occur subtly and without arousing much external attention. On the other hand, a mechanism such as noisy grandiosity is most readi- ly observable in the interactive sphere. Moreover, protective devices- traditionally labeled defenses-are not always detrimental to development. Originally adaptations to aid survival in a dangerous or deprived environ- ment, these mental processes and behaviors may be socially rewarded and hence reinforced. Humor, a means of defusing potentially explosive or uncomfortable moments, is perhaps the most common of these. Yet, in all cases, the unconscious purpose is the same: to prevent the emergence of feel- ings that might, if exposed, prove to be intolerable. Just as my patients needed to protect themselves from their own deepest knowledge and awareness through obsessive thinking and other means, so, too, do the personae of "Der Rayzeman," "Der Gasnpoyker," and "Eynzam." Of the three, I consider Glatshteyn's "Rayzeman" the most enigmatic,8 since his particular tragedy is the most carefully hidden. It is tempting to view this zany fellow as a jokester, an expression of Glatshteyn's unabashed romance with the Yiddish language. This, I think, while undeniably an ele- ment in the poem's success, fails to do justice to its underlying poignancy. Furthermore, it is inadequate to explain the-work's despairing conclusion. I have discussed the peculiar tonal shifts of Glatshteyn's 1943 volume, Gedenklider, in which this poem appears, in my book on Glatshteyn. There, I pointed out that Glatshteyn, sensing the catastrophe of the Holocaust, and yielding to despair in some of his poems, simultaneously sought to maintain 8.

The volume as a whole vacillates between these two poles.9 The poem begins with an introduction to the rayzeman; indeed, it is not the traveler himself who sets in motion the series of repetitions that will fol- low, but rather a third-person narrator: Gekumen tsu forn a rayzer fun vayt, Geven in vine, berline, khine, palestine, Umetum geven un umetum gevan, Alts gezen un alts gezan- Der grayzer vayzer rayzeman. A traveler came riding from afar, Been in Vina, Berlina, China, Palestina, Everywhere been and bawn, Everything seen and sawn, The wizened wise old travelman. Already, the hint not to take the rayzeman seriously is evident: khine and palestine, appropriate Yiddish place names, rhyme with vine and berline, which are almost, but not quite, right. Furthermore, the varied forms come first, immediately striking the reader, whose awareness may have already been piqued by the mock daytshmerish'0 terms rayzeman and rayzer. The impression that something is awry only grows with the pseudo-German past participles gevan and gezan. In the subsequent five strophes, the rayzeman speaks for himself, as he encounters first a yidl ("a little Jew") and then a daytshl ("a little German"), both of whom ask about his travels. The term daytshl stands out because it is not a familiar term, unlike yidl, which is a commonly used diminutive. Moreover, the connection between yidl and daytshl which is created by the similar form suggests that this daytshl is not, in fact, a true German, but rather an assimilated Jew trying to appear sophisticated. His subsequent 9. Janet Hadda, Yankev Glatshteyn (Boston: G. K. Hall, 1980), pp. 62-82. 10. Daytshmerish is defined by Uriel Weinreich as "too much like German (said of Modern German words or phrases sporadically used in Yid[dish] but not accepted by cultivated styl- ists)," in Uriel Weinreich, Modern English-Yiddish Yiddish-English Dictionary (New York: YIVO Institute for Jewish Research and McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1968), p. 136. Glat- shteyn's skill revolves around his ability to createforms that mimic this pompous and question- able style without actually employing its forms.</page><page sequence="7">GLATSHTEYN, HALPERN, AND MANGER 87 utterances confirm this and, at the same time, undercut the rayzeman's own efforts at making a cosmopolitan impression. With the daytshl, the rayze- man engages in more pseudo-German, mixed with standard German and Yiddish as only Glatshteyn can manage: thus frage rhymes with mage, far- genage, and even aderage. Nonetheless, his responses have a ritualized quality, as he repeats words and entire phrases: Avade, voden? / Avade, voden / Alts gezan un alts gezen... ("Of course, what else? / Of course, what else? / Everything sawn and everything seen . . ."); reiterated to both the yidl and the daytshl; geyazdet mit vogn, / Un geyazdet mit ban ("Took a short trip by wagon, / And a short trip by train"), and, as a variation on the narrator's introduction in the first strophe: Umetum geven un gevan, / Mit di eygene oygn alts gezan ("Everywhere been and bawn, / With my own eyes everything sawn.)" The sixth, penultimate, strophe is important to my interpretation, for it is here that the rayzeman reaches a point of almost manic intensity, display- ing his sparkling wares, i.e., his fabulous experiences, at a breathless pace, ending with the refrain, by now familiar: Umetum geven un gevan, / Mit di eygene oygn alts gezan. This, however, occurs only after he has allowed his cover to slip at the end of the fifth strophe: Aleyn gezen di kupernefroy, / Vi ikh bin an alter goy ("With my own eyes seen that copper lady, / Just as sure as I'm no Jew.") Even as he reaches out and bombards his listeners with tales of fascinating exploits, we know he is lying. It is as if he must resusci- tate his flagging sense of self by embroidering his existence with redoubled intensity. It is therefore not much of a surprise to encounter the rayzeman deflated, desperate, and all alone in the final strophe of Glatshteyn's poem. Now his repetitions have a different quality: they describe not his fabricated cosmo- politanism, but rather the poverty of both his internal and external lives: Ale ligns oysgeleygt, / Ale dertseylenishn oysdertseylt, / Ale lender oysgetrakht, / Ale rayzn oysgedakht... ("All my lies laid out, / All my tales told up, / All the countries dreamed up, / All the trips thought up..."). These lines reveal the rayzeman's reality, namely, that his wonderful but pumped-up world is oys, "finished," useless in confronting his true loneliness and isola- tion. The final three lines of the poem are a bitter variation of his earlier pronouncements: A make gezen un a make gezan / Nisht geven un nisht gevan- / Der grayzer, vayzer rayzeman ("Nothing seen and nothing sawn / Nothing been and nothing bawn- / The wizened wise old travel- man").</page><page sequence="8">88 JANET HADDA The final two strophes of "Der Rayzeman" beautifully exemplify the breakdown of a defensive structure. The rayzeman's ability to impress others with a glamorous and animated picture of his condition depends on the extent to which he can convince himself. By filling his hearers' ears, and his own, with a false perception of achievement and activity, he can drown out the fact that he is actually eyner aleyn ("all alone"). But only temporarily. If the form of the rayzeman's consolidating utterances is repetition, the con- tent is bravado and grandiosity, the purpose a crucially needed self- creation. This veneer protects the rayzeman against an underlying belief that he is actually inadequate, incapable of drawing people to him. The conclu- sion of "Der Rayzeman" emphasizes the miserable plight of what Winnicott has so aptly termed the false self. In Winnicott's words: "Let us say that in the severe case all that is real and all that matters and all that is personal and original is hidden, and gives no sign of its existence."" Although this self may hide the vulnerable true self successfully, any love or warmth that comes towards the individual who is so defended will never seem authentic. Glatshteyn does not provide reasons for the rayzeman's isolation, his need to be the way he is, and this is neither a poetic nor a psychological failure: all too often, the roots of a human being's sense of aloneness remain shrouded in the past. Yet, whatever its source, the gaping void has been revealed, as has the imperfection of the rayzeman's attempt to patch it over with the companionship of falseness. If Glatshteyn's rayzeman wards off his emptiness with repetitions of a humorous nature, Moyshe Leyb Halpern's gasnpoyker shields himself through bombast and rebellious anger.'2 Although the poem begins with the street drummer's assertion that he is as free as a bird, he rapidly confides that all is not well, even as he denies the impact of his malaise: Bin ikh krank un alt un gro, / Vemen art es-ho-ho-ho! ("If I'm sick and old and grey, / Who cares-ha, ha, ha!"). Hard upon this comes his refrain, introduced as a straightforward business come-on, defiantly obliterating the hint of sor- row. 11. D. W.

Dzhin dzhin bum! For a mere penny I drum as if to break the drum, And I jingle the cymbals, And I spin myself around- Jingle, jingle, boom-boom-boom. Jingle jingle boom! Halpern's 1919 volume contains many poems devoted to the plight of the recent immigrant who has landed in New York, although this is by no means his only subject of focus. Here, the reader might begin to believe that what follows will be a diatribe against the evils of a harsh, albeit seductive, economic system. However, by the next strophe, the true cause of the drum- mer's unhappiness emerges with clarity: he has been abandoned by a woman, whom he identifies as a shlang ("a snake"). Now his repetitive exclamations take on the form of direct response to the pain he is experi- encing; the drum he beats to the bursting point is explicitly connected to the straining of his own heart, which is exposed as the reason for his illness: Krenkt dos harts un platst far vey- / Poyk ikh az di poyk zol platsn . . . ("If my heart is sick and bursting, / I drum as if to burst the drum..."). Yet, it is one thing to lose a lover and mourn that loss, and quite another to engage in self-destructive, self-demeaning behavior such as that detailed in the third strophe of "Der Gasnpoyker." Here, the drummer urges his youthful bystanders to hurt and humiliate him-hit me, spit on me, he taunts. He is tsugevoynt tsu aldosbeyz ("Used to the worst of everything"). It is tempting, perhaps, to view this display aesthetically, to dismiss the drum- mer's frantic comments, together with his guzzling, as merely part of his act, and thereby an indication of Halpern's need to discomfit his audience. This perspective, while undoubtedly correct as far as it goes, cannot account for the agony apparent in the drummer's articulations, strangled though they may be. Halpern brilliantly describes a man unable to express the full vehe-</page><page sequence="10">90 JANET HADDA mence of his anguish. To miss the obvious clues would be to misunderstand the gasnpoyker's soul. In this third strophe, the refrain's function as a means of filling a void is not yet clear. Instead, it operates here as a method-albeit a curious one-of self-regulation. The drummer has been degraded, he has escalated himself into a frenzy: Brent dos blut, un rint der shveys "[If] my blood burns and I drip with sweat"). The refrain, a familiar repetition, works to calm him, to ease his agitation. And, indeed, by the next, final strophe, he is quieter, able in fact to articulate the nature of his situation: he is desolate, and destined to remain so. Iber shteg un veg un land Mit di tseyn- Hak dem shteyn! Hak dem shteyn un blayb aleyn! Over hill and dale with your teeth- Chop the stone! Chop the stone and be alone! These lines are important, for they indicate the reason for the street drummer's maltreatment of himself. Not only is he used to bad things, he expects to be abandoned and rejected. The event of being left by one particu- lar woman only corroborates his general sense of futility and failure. The concluding lines of the poem, although they contain the same refrain, manage to convey a very different feeling. I should add, incidentally, that the gasnpoyker's refrain not only consists of words but describes physi- cal activity. Thus, it is a poetic equivalent of behavior as well as thought. Now the lines and movements are a comfort, a way to cope with his forlorn condition, a substitute for the love he is convinced cannot be his. Hob ikh nit keyn rok, keyn hemd, Hob ikh nit keyn vayb, keyn kind. Poyk ikh az di poyk zol platsn... If I have no jacket, no shirt If I have no wife, no child. I drum as if to burst the drum...</page><page sequence="11">GLATSHTEYN, HALPERN, AND MANGER 91 There is more than one kind of chaos, the term I use here to refer to states of psychological fragmentation or lack of cohesion caused by intense feelings of isolation or rejection. The rayzeman and the gasnpoyker both unfold situations in which they have vainly attempted to foster some sort of contact with others. The gasnpoyker, for all his rage, ultimately cries out that, beneath the facade of anger, he is wretchedly neglected, unloved because unlovable. Yet he succeeds in exposing his vulnerability with force, if obliquely. The rayzeman, in contrast, can refer neither to such specific loss nor to a general deficiency. He remains powerless, unable to disclose his unmet wish for admiration, instead wearing a mask of bonhomie and joie de vivre until it falls off and his true self emerges, frightened, convinced that he has nothing worth offering to others. The rayzeman and the gasnpoyker share an ability to engage others on a limited basis. For as long as their protective efforts work, they venture into the interpersonal world and find themselves rewarded with yearned-for response, even if that means humilation or approval for delivering a pack of lies. The case of Manger's "Eynzam" is different."3 Even the title of this poem intimates the divergence: rather than introducing us to the narrator, it indicates his emotional state. This is in accordance with Manger's striking capacity for empathy, for vicarious introspection. Moreover, the narrator himself immediately divulges the cause of his forlorn circumstances: Keyner veyst nit, vos ikh zog, / keyner veyst nit, vos ikh vil-("No-one knows what I say / No-one knows what I want-"). He is not rejected per se, nor is he hiding the essential problem from himself or anyone else. Far from being dissatisfied with the quality of his relationships, he lacks contact completely. The poverty of his existence is quickly apparent, as the isolated man counts his sleeping companions: seven baby mice and an adult mouse (which I have always assumed to be the little ones' mother, for reasons that have to do both with the substance of the poem and, I admit, with convention). These are unsuitable evening companions, but they merit a "good-night" as the narrator leaves, only to be faced with a predicament inherent in his position: Vu zhe geyt men shpet baynakht / Eyninker aleyn? ("Where does one go late at night / All by one's lonesome?"). The use of the diminutive to refer to himself illuminates the narrator's problem. He has to provide any endear- 13. "Eynzam," in Lid un balade (New York: Itsik-manger-komitet, 1952), pp. 183-184.</page><page sequence="12">92 JANET HADDA ments he will receive; especially as he complains of his aloneness, the fond self-appellation emphasizes the cheerless truth and ameliorates it. At least the mice are flesh and blood. The wanderer's next encounter is with the village inn, which beckons him with the promise of wine and, implicitly, conviviality. His reaction is joyous, his hope palpable. Efn shnel ikh uf di tir Un ikh fal arayn: "A gut yontev ale aykh ver ir zolt nit zayn!" I rush to open up the door And I tumble in: "Happy holiday to you, whoever you may be!" The holiday spirit is short-lived however, for, as the verb araynfaln allusive- ly warns, the narrator finds his hilarity as appropriate as that of a yovn in suke (to barge in, to be as inappropriate as a Russian soldier in a suke). His arrival is met with dismal nonreaction as he once again experiences the extent to which he doesn't matter. Keyner veyst nit, vos ikh zog, Keyner veyst nit vos ikh vil- Tsvey shikurim mit a flash Shlofn afn dil. No-one knows what I say, No-one knows what I want- Two drunkards and a bottle Are sleeping on the floor. Now, through juxtaposition, the narrator opens his perceptual world to full view, whereas until this point the truth has been veiled: so empty is his life of human warmth that he cannot even allow himself to distinguish between a person and a bottle. Neither will notice him, let alone come for- ward to welcome him. The failure to see living beings as separate from in- animate objects bespeaks a profound disturbance, for if there is no distinc- tion, he himself may not-or might as well not-exist as a breathing, impressionable, entity. In this regard, the narrator's particular repetitions,</page><page sequence="13">GLATSHTEYN, HALPERN, AND MANGER 93 which stress his loneliness and isolation, serve a special function. For, even as they fill his emptiness, they remind him that, in fact, he does exist. Put somewhat differently, in the acknowledgment of pain also lies the assertion of vitality and feeling. It is fitting that this concept should appear in a con- text of drunkenness and perhaps even alcohol abuse: unfortunately, self- destructive behavior is sometimes the most potent means of achieving a sense of agency and self-regulation. Despite Manger's undeniable charm and whimsy, I consider "Eynzam," with its unresolved emptiness, to be the grimmest of the poems I have discussed, because the picture of vacant long- ing remains relentlessly in place. Where the rayzeman and the gasnpoyker reach out to others through joking and anger, respectively, the narrator of "Eynzam" is trapped within himself, ignored, uninvolved, purposeless. I have thought about the fact that all three poems I have discussed con- tain an element of levity, which interacts almost absurdly with the aspects my argument accentuates. Moreover, the repetitions I have analyzed are, after all, a structural aid to the poems, provided for the purpose of enhanc- ing rhythm, musicality, closure. Each poem fits well into its creator's oeuvre. Glatshteyn's "Rayzeman" is a brilliant example of his play with komponentn-visikeyt (awareness of the different components that have fused to create Yiddish), a surreptitious attack on the barbarous Germans who were bent on destroying his beloved language. Halpern's "Gasnpoyker" combines the poet's famous vulgarity and passion with his equally charac- teristic undercurrent of confession and tenderness. "Eynzam" epitomizes Manger's talent for evoking entire subtle vistas of implication through the construction of dreamy scenes and the use of simple, almost elementary language. These are important considerations. Yet they are certainly not the only ones. The humor, the very talkiness of "Der Rayzeman," "Der Gasn- poyker," and "Eynzam" is the buzz of thought working hard to be sustain- ing. But when the buzzing stops, underlying truths, so painful as to be intolerable, are free to emerge. The tension between these two strains of meaning is a reminder that in poetry, as in the human psyche, opposites may both be true.

Children laugh, they're full of cheer, But I don't lose my grip, Move it, kids! Faster-hop! Knock me in the head again. Spit on me once more! In any case When I jump, it's all okay. Used to the worst of everything, I pinch off a bite of bread. And I guzzle from the bottle If my blood burns and I drip with sweat- I drum as if to burst the drum, And I jingle the cymbals, And I spin myself around- Jingle, jingle, boom-boom-boom Jingle jingle boom!</page><page sequence="17">GLATSHTEYN, HALPERN, AND MANGER 97 That's how I've pushed through life, Pushed through, bitten through With my head as if through a wall Over hill and dale With your teeth- Chop the stone! Chop the stone and be alone! Dog and hobo, windy rascal. Lost, lost through foreign places! If I have no jacket, no shirt If I have no wife, no child. I drum as if to burst the drum, And I jingle the cymbals, And I spin myself around- Jingle, jingle, boom-boom-boom. Jingle jingle boom! Lonely Itsik Manger No-one knows what I say No-one knows what I want- Seven baby mice and a grown one Are sleeping on the floor. Seven baby mice and a grown one Seems to me make eight- I put on my cap And say: "Good-night." I put on my cap And I let myself out. Where does one go late at night All by one's lonesome? An inn stands in the marketplace, Beckons me: "You dope!</page><page sequence="18">98 JANET HADDA I have a barrel full of wine, A barrel full of gold." A rush to open up the door And I tumble in: "Happy holiday to you, Whoever you may be!" No-one knows what I say, No-one knows what I want- Two drunkards and a bottle Are sleeping on the floor. Two drunkards and a bottle Seems to me make three. To be a fourth one in this game Is it worth it? -Not at all. I put on my cap And I let myself out.
