<plain_text><page sequence="1">Martha Himmelfarb. Ascent to Heaven in Jewish and Christian Apocalypses. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. xii, 171 pp. It would be clever, but not very accurate, to represent Martha Himmelfarb's Ascent to Heaven as a companion volume to her Tours of Hell: An Apocalyptic Form in Jewish and Christian Literature (Philadelphia, 1983). The two books are in fact quite dissimilar. In Tours of Hell, Himmelfarb rescued from obscurity an ill-studied apocalyptic genre; and, through meticulous examination of detail, traced out the relationships among the sources that represent it. The result was a fundamental work of scholarship, to which anyone interested in these disagreeable but important texts has no choice but</page><page sequence="2">154 BOOK REVIEWS to refer. The documents that are the subject of Ascent to Heaven, by contrast, have long been familiar to students of ancient Judaism. The spadework on them has largely been done. Himmelfarb is free to probe-as she now does-the wider interpretive issues that they raise, and to add her voice to the already extensive scholarly dialogue concerning these issues. Precisely what it is that she has added is not altogether easy to define. Ancient Jewish apocalyptic, as John J. Collins pointed out years ago, does not concern itself exclusively or even primarily with timetables for the end of the world. R. H. Charles's classic Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament (1913), and the more or less contemporaneous publications of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, offer example after example of apocalypses of a quite different sort. A large proportion of the Enoch literature, 3 Baruch, the Ascension of Isaiah, and parts of the Apocalypse of Abraham are given over to wholly uneschatological subjects: notably, their heroes' travels through the heavens or to out-of-the-way regions of earth, and what meets them there. These "ascent apocalypses" are very well known and have been much discussed. Seldom, however, have the various specimens of the genre been assembled for a book-length treatment devoted to them alone. Hence, Him- melfarb argues, there was a need for such a comprehensive study when she set about writing her book. That the work has its virtues is no surprise. Himmelfarb is an excellent scholar, who demonstrates her wide learning and sound judgment on every page. Her gracious sense of collegiality is evident throughout. Not only has she mastered the secondary literature on the whole range of difficult problems she discusses, not only is she consistently fair in her presentation of positions with which she disagrees, but she is free and generous in her acknowledgment of the convergence of others' ideas with her own. In this respect, Ascent to Heaven is a class act. The problem is that one comes away from it unsure just what one has learned. I am not, of course, speaking of the details. On any one of the myriad of specific points Himmelfarb discusses, she expresses and supports her opinions clearly enough. (I do not always agree with her views, but they are always sensible and worth considering.) But a book-especially one justified as a much-needed "comprehensive study"-ought to present a comprehensive thesis. It ought to be more than a series of intelligent discussions of details. What thesis, or theses, do we find in Ascent to Heaven ? With some effort, the attentive reader will be able to define a more or less cohesive string of</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 155 assertions that draw together the first three of the book's five chapters. To wit: Ezekiel heavily influenced the Enochian Book of Watchers, which itself exercised enormous influence on the later ascent literature. The heavenly temple, foreshadowed in the last chapters of the Book of Ezekiel, came in postexilic times to seem the true and authentic sanctuary, of which the Jerusalem temple was a blemished replica. Enoch, perhaps the earliest of the ascending heroes, was both priest and scribe; and, as scribe, was a fit critic of both human and angelic priests. Another key source, outside the Enoch literature, was the Aramaic Testament of Levi, which contributed the ideas of heavenly liturgy and priestly investiture of the ascending hero. This investiture became, in 2 Enoch, transformation into an angel. The Apocalypse of Zephaniah and the Ascension of Isaiah use priestly investiture and participation in angelic song as images for the postmortem transformation of the righteous. And this theme of transformation has its significance as an attempt to solve the problem, widespread in the Greco-Roman world, of the remoteness of the divinity. The last two chapters do not visibly extend this line of argument. Chapter 4 is an examination of the role of nature in the ascent apocalypses-orderly and lucid, but without any unifying thesis apparent, while chapter 5 takes up the question of how the texts relate to the personalities of their authors and any visionary experiences they may have had. Himmelfarb is skeptical on this last point (correctly, in my opinion). As for the psychological problems raised by apocalyptic pseudepigraphy, they are insoluble (p. 113) and unimportant (p. 103). In this labor of synthesis, Himmelfarb offers the reader scant assistance. The book ends abruptly after chapter 5, with no general conclusion. Indeed, given the weak cohesion of the elements of its argument, it is not easy to imagine what such a conclusion might have contained. One gets the impression that Himmelfarb has spent the book circling around a cluster of problems that she intuitively perceives as significant, but has not managed to find an entry point. What might such an entry point be? I cannot propose an answer without betraying my own perspective-in which, I acknowledge, I am very much in the minority-that an investigation of apocalyptic must take up psychological (and, let us say it, psychoanalytic) issues if it is to have any depth. There are, of course, sound methodological reasons, to which Himmelfarb alludes, for not doing this. "As is often true when psychology is applied to figures of the past, we have no access to the author's mind apart from the work that causes</page><page sequence="4">156 BOOK REVIEWS our puzzlement" (p. 98). Psychological speculation about the text in question, therefore, can be tested only against the criteria of plausibility, coherence, and the satisfying click! that happens in the mind when the unintelligible suddenly takes on meaning. These controls are far less than we would like to have, but they are all that is available. The alternative to speculative leaps, hazardous as they may be, is endless wary circling. This is hardly the place to go into the details of how one might view Himmelfarb's data from a psychoanalytic perspective. I have offered a specimen in a response to a paper on merkavah mysticism by psychoanalyst Mortimer Ostow.1 I there built upon Ostow's proposals in order to explain the significance of the stream or streams of fire that, according to 1 Enoch 14 and Daniel 7, flow from beneath God's throne. Himmelfarb discusses these streams from the standard historical and philological perspectives (p. 17). She locates their background, appropriately, in Ezekiel 47:1-12 and, perhaps less appropriately, in Ugaritic myths of the rivers at the mountain of El. But she provides no convincing solution to the essential conundrum of why they are fiery. How has Ezekiel's healing and life-giving stream turned into something that is destructive beyond human endurance? But let us now supplement Himmelfarb's historical-philological approach with one that takes the author's psychology into account. Let us suppose, at least provisionally, that behind the fantasy or hallucination of 1 Enoch 14 lies a powerful yearning to enter or reenter some inaccessible or forbidden enclosure-the maternal womb, say. Let us again suppose that Ostow is right in postulating the existence in the human psyche of "an affect regulating system that automatically acts to oppose an impulse of excessive strength."2 Will it not begin to make sense that the apocalyptic writer should satisfy his yearning by allowing his hero to reach the longed-for enclosure; and yet, as a reaction against the very intensity of that yearning, conceive the enclosure and its appurtenances as almost hellishly painful? ("And I entered into that house, and it was hot as fire and cold as snow; and there were no delights in it; horror overwhelmed me, and trembling took hold of me" [1 Enoch 14:13].) The nurturing river of life thus turns into a blazing agony. The weird and unsettling transformations described in the Apocalypse of Zephaniah, also 1.

There is an obvious unfairness in criticizing Himmelfarb for not employing a method she explicitly distrusts, especially since she has offered a sound reason for distrusting it. Yet the impasse remains. We are confronted with a vitally important ancient literature that we essentially do not comprehend, the study of which tends to generate scholarly writings like Ascent to Heaven: thoroughly competent, yet unsatisfying. Himmelfarb, and the profession with her, need to find a better way. David J. Halperin University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, N.C.</page></plain_text>
