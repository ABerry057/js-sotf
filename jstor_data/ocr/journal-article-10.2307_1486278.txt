<plain_text><page sequence="1">Warren Bargad. Ideas in Fiction: The Works of Hayim Hazaz. Brown Judaic Studies, no. 31. Chico, Calif.: Scholars Press, 1982. xi, 173 pp. The title of this study of .Hayyim Hazaz (1898-1973), Ideas in Fiction, encapsulates Warren Bargad's critical method and bias in his appraisal of a seminal author. Bargad's touchstone is effective fiction, and he accords Hazaz his due in assessing this writer's many artistic successes. At the same time Bargad acknowledges, as every reader must, "Hazaz's long-standing penchant for interjecting all sorts of theories and notions into his narrative." Bargad's grappling with the stylistic problems of this genre of fiction is a leitmotif of his clearly written and engrossing book. Bargad points out that, in Hazaz's early works, his theories and his identification of characters with theories are "utilized mainly to create ironic overtones." The early "characters of ideas," Bargad notes, "usually seem overwhelmed by their own philosophical systems and, at the same time, are depicted in futile attempts to impart their ideas to other-wholly indiffer- ent-characters." In his chapter "The Lonely Exiles" (and throughout the book) Bargad betrays a preference for those stories in which philosophical ideas are not differentiated from their aesthetic role in characterization. He also manifests a critical bias in favor of the early works (such as the first versions of the various "Stories of the Revolution," the novel Be- Yishuv shel Ya-ar, and "Hatan Damim") in which there is a parallel lack of differentia- tion between expressionistic descriptions of nature and characterization. (Aharon Meged, incidentally, has also singled out the early Hazaz's impact on him.) In a splendid summary statement, Bargad writes: In the stories of the late twenties history and nature are joined together as the underlying causes of man's frustration. The characters who populate the works contemplate their fate at the hands of these mythical forces. Messianism</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 125 is dead; its uprooted, tragicomic followers attempt to adjust to the hostile world surrounding them, but the conflict between tenaciously held romantic notions or love or redemption and the realities of lonely exile is so great that the characters either revert to a moody reticence or try in vain to gain accep- tance for their fanciful theories. In view of Bargad's correct, if overstated, preference for the early Hazaz, there is a certain tragic irony to the fact that Hazaz kept returning to his earlier plots and paradigms in an effort to improve their dramatic tension. Hazaz expanded the novel Gates of Bronze from an early Revolution short story; he did so once in 1956 and then again, in still longer form, in 1968. Bargad dismisses Hazaz's efforts when he compares the final version to "a soap opera." He prefers the undifferentiated immediacy and tension of the early stories over the labored craftsmanship of the later versions, which suffer from a kind of domesticated remove. Yet I feel that Bargad's assess- ment and recurrent choice of adjectives such as "trite," "maudlin," and "artificial" are unduly harsh with regard to many later works (such as Be-Kolar Ehad). Several stories to which Bargad assigns low marks I find eminently readable. The irony I referred to is heightened by the fact that Hazaz reiterated in his "Stories of Ideas" (most famously in "Ha-Derashah") his fear that "normalcy" might irrevocably damage the Jewish creative process. It would appear that as Hazaz "normalized" his fiction in an effort to make it more readable, he sacrificed the artistic potential of that tense ambiguity and ambivalence of the Diaspora Jewish intellectual. Whenever Hazaz suc- ceeded in recapturing the Diaspora "night psychology" (see "Ha- Derashah") of ambivalence-i.e., expectant waiting for redemption coupled with reluctance and fear of redemption's end-products-he was at his best (such as in "Shelulit Genuzah" and parts of Ha- Yoshevet ba-Gannim). Hazaz was himself a victim-artistically speaking-of the Zionist caesura with the past. Having agreed, for the most part, with Bargad's assessment of Hazaz's fiction qua fiction, I must still register a certain disappointment with the small amount of attention Bargad devotes to the drama of (disembodied) ideas within these works. For the sake of his thesis, which Bargad so clearly and consistently develops, he pares down the specifics of ideological exegesis in Hazaz to an unsatisfying minimum. Admittedly, Bargad does not agree-and legitimately so-with Miron's reading of "Ha-Derashah," as but one example. Bargad makes an excellent case for an integrated aesthetic</page><page sequence="3">126 BOOK REVIEWS evaluation of Yudke's "sermon" as fine theater in the context of a short story. Nonetheless, there is an aspect of suspenseful ideological drama in Miron's analysis of the manner in which Hazaz's protagonists, such as Moroshka, Gurland (from "Be-Zilan shel Malkhuyot," which Bargad brief- ly discusses), and Aristotle (from another yet-to-be-studied reworking of a Revolution story), may be placed along with Yudke and others into their respective camps. Hazaz's characters of ideas, Miron proves, either affirm the cyclical continuum of Jewish history or diagnose the caesura effected by Zionism. Similarly, Shaked's evaluation of the play Be-Ke; ha-Yamin (touched on only obliquely by Bargad) demonstrates how attention to kabbalistic background and other historical material need not detract from aesthetic appreciation. And finally, for my taste, Bargad would have done well to isolate a motif such as Hazaz's recurrent references to the donkey as a parody of Jewish messianism and to deal seriously with what has been dubbed "The Messianic Comedy" of Hazaz's oeuvre. The donkey motif and its like notwithstanding, however, Bargad's contribution to our appreciation of Ha-Yoshevet ba-Gannim and all of Hazaz's Yemenite works is immense and impressive. He affords the reader a beautifully engaged reading of "Rabamim" and Ha-Yoshevet ba-Gannim and a meticulous analysis of the four volumes of Ya'ish. His chapter "The Yemenite Works" and his lucid, if biased (in the above-stated ways), chapter "The Stories of Ideas" are extremely successful and persuasive. We should note before closing Bargad's illuminating discussion of the Russian satirical technique of poshlost (vulgarity or banality in description) and his helpful comparison of Hazaz with Aldous Huxley. Despite the criti- cisms registered above, Bargad's book is a major event in the study of Hazaz. The book's publication, sadly, was delayed, so that it cannot truly embrace the posthumously published works of Hazaz and the large output of critical studies which have appeared in such volumes as Me'assef.Hayyim Hazaz (1978), Ilayyim Hazaz, Mivhar Ma'amarim al Ye;irato (1978), and (naturally not) the many articles which appeared in 1983 on the occasion of Hazaz's tenth yahrzeit.' Bargad's work joins with these other publications in convincing the student of literature that much remains to be done in Hazaz 1. Bargad's bibliography, however, is scrupulously updated. His several appendices are invaluable tools for scholars.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 127 studies. Bargad's concluding suggestion that Hazaz was one of those writers "who live most significantly for their own age" is probably not correct.
