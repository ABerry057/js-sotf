<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE AMERICAN CONNECTION OF CANADIAN JEWS: 1759-1914 by MICHAEL BROWN York University I Its French and English antecedents notwithstanding, Canada is an American country. From 1759 to 1776 Canada was merely the fourteenth American colony of Great Britain. Had the fortunes of war been different, Canada might well have become part of the United States, or part or all of the United States might have remained British, joined with the northern- most colony. The Treaty of Paris made formal in 1783 the division between Canada and the other thirteen colonies, now independent. The treaty did not, however, put an end to the intimate cultural, economic and personal relationships, which had already developed among all North Americans of British origin. In fact, as time went on, those ties became closer, despite the border and despite the sometimes divergent political interests of the two countries. For Jews, that Canada was an American country was of con- siderable importance. By European standards, England was remarkably tolerant and open. With its vast economic potential, empty spaces, and society-in-the-making, however, America represented the real land of 21</page><page sequence="2">MICHAEL BROWN opportunity-economic and social-for all eighteenth and nineteenth- century Europeans, and especially for Jews. Jews everywhere thought of America in these terms. Particularly in nineteenth-century eastern and central Europe, Jews beginning to despair of the liberalization of the societies in which they lived, turned to America. There they hoped that the lack of a tradition of antisemitism and the absence of a "Jewish question," together with all the other favorable condi- tions, might offer them opportunity for a decent existence on an equal footing with Christians. Charles Freshman, the future Quebec rabbi and Ontario Lutheran minister, was typical. While still in Europe and still a Jew, he "had heard wonderful stories of the civil and religious liberty" of America and thereupon "resolved to make that ... [his] future residence."' Jews put America to the test, by coming in unprecedented numbers. They were well received. In the freewheeling atmosphere of the American colonies, and then in the young United States, Jews were quick to achieve a degree of public success then unknown anywhere in Europe. From 1657 on, New York (then New Amsterdam) Jews enjoyed most of the privileges and duties of citizenship. By 1850 American Jews were being elected to public of- fice, appointed to positions in the foreign service, and even promoted to im- portant posts in the armed services. By the end of the nineteenth century, Jews in the United States had achieved a degree of integration unparalleled in Jewish experience, except perhaps in contemporary England. The growing integration of the Jews into America was reflected not only in the personal achievement of individuals, but in the advancement of the Jewish community institutionally and culturally, and in the increasing iden- tity of Jewish and American interests in the international arena. Early American Jews were not known in Europe for their piety or their intellectual activities. To many, America was the treyfe medine, the land where freedom often meant the license not to practice Judaism at all. As time went on, however, the United States outdistanced many older, European centers culturally and even religiously. World War I would catapult the American Jewish community to a position of paramount power, leadership and NOTE: All quotations are given here in English translation, for which the author is responsible.

The community was by then prepared. One of the factors facilitating the maturation of American Jewry and its willingness to lead was the growing identity of Jewish and American in- terests in the international arena. Americans saw themselves as the standard bearers of democracy and freedom, the champions of the underdog. As such the government sought on a number of occasions to defend Jews. During the Damascus blood libel of 1840, the Mortara kidnapping case in Italy in 1858, and later during the Dreyfus Affair in France and the persecutions of Jews in Rumania and Russia, the American public and often the American government spoke out for Jews and at times actually came to their aid. One of the most dramatic events was the renunciation of the Russian-American trade treaty in 1911, as a result of Russian refusal to ameliorate the condi- tions of Jews living within their empire.2 To be sure, antisemitism was not unknown in America during these years. Already during the Civil War, considerable anti-Jewish animus had been in evidence. In the latter years of the nineteenth century, certain WASP groups, which had held the reins of power in the past, realized they were be- ing elbowed aside by the vigorous newcomers. This decaying gentility often exhibited a most unpleasant antisemitism. Henry Adams, the writer, is a foremost example.3 The arrival of large numbers of Russian Jews brought underlying tensions between Jews and Christians to the surface. Prejudice against the easterners was fed by the cult of Anglo-Saxon superiority. As the years went by, it became increasingly clear that American xenophobia ex- tended to Jews, as well as to Negroes, Orientals, Slavs and others.4 But America's dedication to freedom and equality was more in evidence during these years than nativism. Certainly Jews, bearing the wounds of Russian and Rumanian barbarity, were likely to appreciate America's broad tolerance, even with its admitted shortcomings. For them the United States was "naturally ... the ultimate hope."5 As the American Jewish com- munity gained strength, and as more and more Americans came to accept Judaism as one of the major religions of the country, America appeared to be the new "promised land." 2.

The poor saw in the United States a land of economic op- portunity vastly more promising than England or her colonies. The better- off were attracted by social integration even easier in the United States than in England's stratified society.6 In England toleration often meant a will- ingness for Christians to accept Jews into the fold of Christianity. In America it was not unthinkable for Christians to become Jews. In 1846 the London Jewish Chronicle reported with astonishment, that at New York it frequently happens that gentlemen desirous of entering into the holy state of matrimony fall in love with ladies of the Jewish faith, from whom, however, they receive no encouragement, except on condition of becoming circumcised and embracing the law of Moses. More than twelve in- dividuals, inspired by the one lovely reward held out to them, have lately sub- mitted to those rigorous conditions. The rite is performed by a Portuguese, a most skillful operator.7 Although England grew ever more open and tolerant as the century pro- gressed, interest in America did not wane. Even Jews who rose high in English society, like Sir Moses Montefiore, appreciated "the broad tolera- tion in religious matters which exists in the United States of America.'T The actions of the American government, the sentiments of the American public, and the development of the American Jewish community in the nineteenth century, then, gave Jews reason to feel extremely close to the United States and to gravitate to it. American openness to Jews and con- cern with their welfare were reinforced by ideas and beliefs, which led Americans to feel close to Jews and to their culture. Many Christian Euro- peans, although by no means all, shared the Jewish enthusiasm for America. II Canadians lived close to the United States. Especially before Confedera- tion in 1867, but afterwards as well, they lacked unity and a clear sense of national identity. Partly as a consequence of their own insecurity, they tended to be rather more ambivalent about the exuberant United States 6. Compare W. S.

They feared with reason that "manifest destiny" might turn northward, and they grew increasingly protective of their autonomy. Canadians were heirs to a more conservative, nonrevolutionary tradi- tion. Many Anglo-Canadians viewed American liberty as licentiousness, seeing events such as the Civil War as signs that the great experiment in democracy could never succeed. French Canadians, progressively more backward-looking, were coming to perceive Americans as the "sansculottes of the New World," much like the citizens of their bete noire, revolutionary France.9 Later in the nineteenth century, many French and Anglo-Canadians grew resentful of the growing Americanization of their country and felt ever more strongly the need to assert their own uniqueness. Canadians felt that their historical and political experiences made them different, despite the similarities between American and Canadian economics, social structure, and cultural ambience. Where uniqueness was not readily apparent, some Canadians searched for it and even invented it.'° Like other Canadians, Jews resented Americans, "who know little about this Dominion, yet imagine they know it all. ... "" As Anglo-Canadian nationalism, usually expressed as pro-British feel- ing, gathered strength during the latter years of the nineteenth century, anti- American feeling rose with it. Canadians were agitated by the American position on a number of issues of mutual concern, especially the dispute over the Canada-Alaska boundary which raged from 1898 to 1903. Cana- dians still feared American expansionism, and still with reason. Even the New York-oriented Keneder odler of Montreal expressed annoyance on oc- casion that the United States got "all the advantages" in trade with Canada.12 In such an atmosphere Canadian Jews at times became wary even of 9.

The Jewish workingmen of Canada ... [are] respectable, reliable people. It should be our great object to see that they retain that character and frown down every attempt to introduce New York Ghetto peculiarities into Montreal.l5 Ultimately, however, such feelings, while ever present during the period under review, were submerged by the undeniable facts of the increasing in- tegration of North American society and certainly of North American Jewish society. Even Canadians suspicious of the United States looked to that country as a model of dynamism, particularly before the Canadian economic and political resurgence that began in 1896. Canadian free-trade sentiment often masked a desire for a union of the two countries. It was felt by many, although seldom openly stated, that "unrestricted reciprocity," which the Liberal Party advocated prior to 1896, would lead to annexation. Not a few Canadians thought republican government more liberal and more free than their own system, and that in becoming "assimilated to the United States, Canada was fulfilling itself as a liberal and progressive society."'6 In any case, most Canadian Jews, like most Jews elsewhere and along with many gentile Canadians, agreed with "the sympathetic European view that the United States, this great experiment in popular republican govern- ment, was destined to be the education of the world."'7 In the 1830s and 1840s, they shared the annexationist sentiments of most Montreal merchants, who saw in union with the United States greater economic op- portunity and a counterweight to the growing reactionary sentiment of 13.

At most times they saw in America, as Rabbi Abraham De Sola of Montreal put it, "a land ... greatly favored . ., of wisdom, justice, and liberty."'8 Jews, after all, had everywhere-including England, in medieval times- suffered from the tyranny of kings and felt, therefore, that there was little to fear from Republicanism. Adolphus Mordecai Hart, the historian grandson of Aaron Hart, the first Jew to settle in Canada after the British conquest in 1759, was typical in excusing the United States her well-advertised excesses. Hart did not deny that the United States had been "baptized in blood." Nonetheless he saw that country as representing to all mankind "the triumph of human right."19 Gentile Anglo-Canadians readily recognized that for Jews and other op- pressed minorities, no country, including England and Canada, held as much promise as the United States. The Jewish Baron Ephraim, in Montrealer Mary Ellen Ross's 1878 proto-Zionist novel, The Legend of the Holy Stone, remarked that a man of talent has twice the opportunity of distinguishing himself [in the United States] .... that he has ... [in Europe], surrounded as he is by people who are envious of his popularity, and ready to detract from his merit in every available way.20 To be seen in contrast to European antisemitism, according to the Montreal Star, were the rapid strides the Hebrews are making [in the United States] and the in- fluence they possess in whatever city they make their home.21 III The overwhelming power of attraction that the United States had for all nineteenth-century Europeans, blurred their vision of Canada.

Frequently chance alone brought immigrants to Canada.22 Canada's indistinct image in the mind of European Jews was reflected in language. The term "America" was used in the nineteenth century to designate the United States, North America, and even South America. Newspaper accounts of Canada were frequently datelined, "Montreal, North America," or "Toronto, America." Since it was also common to write "Boston, North America," or "Pittsburgh, America," confusion was inevitable. Another linguistic complication was the Hebrew-Yiddish word, "medinah." That word was-and is-used to translate the English "country" (medinat Canada or medinot ha-berit for the United States), and also to designate the English "state" or "province" (medinat New York, medinat Quebec). The same word was also used at times for "hemisphere" (medinat America), and even, in its older, medieval usage, for "city" (medinat Vineland). Jews in eastern Europe, like other foreigners, might well have found North American political divisions bewildering. The task of sorting them out became almost impossible, however, when they were translated unclearly.23 Even when Canada was mentioned by name in the European press, accounts were often misleading, reflecting prevailing ignorance. If Jewish newspapers reported Canadian events at all, it was generally in the column reserved for "American" news. As late as 1906, even the London Jewish Chronicle could report the election of Louis Rubin as president of the town council of Ashley, North Dakota, under the dateline, "Canada."24 Actually most nineteenth-century Anglo-Canadians were quite willing to foster abroad the notion that Canada was part of "America." Canadians wished to populate their country, and they knew that most Europeans favored the United States. Canadian conservatism had less appeal to Euro- peans seeking a freer atmosphere than they had known in Europe. Often what little Europeans knew about Canada was that the country suffered 22. See A.

Jews had heard of a Jewish community too small and primitive to be successful.25 So greatly did Europeans favor the United States over Canada, that before 1860, seventy-two percent of all British emigrants went directly there, and still more went southward after only a brief stay in Canada. Emigrants from other European countries came to Canada in still smaller numbers.26 Among Jews only a tiny minority thought of Canada before 1900. In 1890, in answer to pleas from American Jewish leaders, the Alliance Israelite Universelle suggested to their counterparts in eastern Europe that emigrants be directed away from New York and toward Canada and South America. The east Europeans replied, that "Moses and Samuel . . . rise[n] from their graves" together would not succeed in redirecting emigration.27 America's virtues were too well known, as, apparently, were the drawbacks of Canada. Canadian and foreign shipping agents and transportation companies were aware of the eagerness of emigrants to reach the United States. It was, in any case, hard to sell tickets to the relatively unknown Canadian ports. Good business dictated that people not be reminded that these ports were not in the United States. Advertisers in late nineteenth-century Jewish jour- nals and guidebooks to North America listed Quebec and Montreal as but two of the many "American" ports to which passage might be booked. In London, Herman Landau, who was connected with Canadian railroads, urged Montreal upon prospective emigrants. It was, he observed, a mere 200 miles from New York City. (The distance is, in fact, more than twice that!) In its early years the Grand Trunk Railway, in its European advertising, presented itself simply as a desirable route to the American interior, never mentioning Canada. Although the road had been designed to tap the trade of the American West, it might have been expected that it would at least have mentioned in its publicity the Canadian cities through which it passed. Thus untutored immigrants might well land in Montreal assuming that they were in the United States.28 After the turn of the century, the Dominion became better and more 25.

Newspaper reports began to differentiate clearly Canada from the United States.29 A few books appeared which spoke of both countries with some knowledge. One of the most notable, Max Raisin's Toledot ha-Yehudim be-America (Warsaw, 1902), included a brief but accurate section on Canada, which introduced the country to many prospective immigrants. Partly out of necessity, too, Jews began to take a second look at Canada. As the movement to restrict immigration in the United States and England gained force around the turn of the century, Ha-eefirah noted that more and more eastern Europeans were becoming "interested in Canada as a land for Jewish immigration." Now, according to that paper, Canada was "an unset- tled country, with plenty of room for immigrants."30 The growing restric- tion sentiment caused Baron de Hirsch, the philanthropist funding much Jewish resettlement, himself to become concerned about causing an- tisemitism in the United States by overpopulating it with Jews. "After careful examination, [he] ... became convinced that the Argentine Republic, Canada and Australia above all" other places, offered the "surest guarantee" for a secure Jewish future.3' Some Jews headed for Canada thinking it was a part of the United States; others, however, came because it was the next best place to go. IV To a great extent, of course, Canada was a part of America. Canada had a three thousand mile border with the United States and was relatively un- populated. People moved back and forth between the countries with ease, maintaining close business and family relations on both sides of the border. Except for the French Canadians, the people of both countries spoke the same language. In the case of Jews, and of many gentiles, Canadians and Americans participated in the same cultural, religious and fraternal organizations, which were generally based in the United States.

Often they were stronger, despite the fact that the United States and Canada were two distinct countries. It was these ties, as well as those of sentiment toward the new "promised land," that bound Canadian Jews to the United States. Proximity, the open border, and many shared aspects of their social, political and economic systems made possible a large-scale "population ex- change" between Canada and the United States. In the early years, Canada witnessed a "strong and persistent . . . drift of population . . . to the United States."32 Lord Durham's 1839 report on the state of Canada estimated that sixty percent of the immigrants to Canada during the decade from 1829 to 1839 had gone on to the United States. The rate slowed somewhat afterwards, but it remained very high until about 1900. It is estimated that between 1851 and 1901 only one of every three intending settlers remained in Canada, the rest pushing on to the United States.33 The traffic of Europeans both Jewish and gentile through Canada to the United States, was considerable enough toward the end of the nineteenth century that Canadians complained of "maintaining an immigration corps to bring peoples to Canada as a way-house [sic] to the United States."34 When the Baron de Hirsch Institute in Montreal sought a new immigration officer in 1903, one of the most important qualifications was that he be able to deal with American immigration authorities.35 It was reported in 1902 that in the previous two decades, over 3,000 immigrant Jewish families had gone to Winnipeg intending to settle there. "Owing, however, to induce- ments held out to them by their friends in the States, many of these visitors [sic] ... joined their brethren across the border line." There were but 200 Jewish families left in the town in 1901.36 Contrary to what some scholars have thought, the outward bound in- cluded significant numbers of native-born Canadians of both French and 32.

The dimensions of the Canadian movement toward the United States were startling. The number of Canadian-born living in the United States rose from 717,157 in 1881 to 1,204,637 in 1911. These figures do not tell the whole story, since many, perhaps even most, of those who moved across the border were, as noted above, transmigrants born in Europe. Although they were often not con- sidered or recorded as "Canadians," they brought with them, to the United States, both European and North American sentiments and habits. In addi- tion there was a considerable movement of the children of Americans born in Canada back to the United States. By 1910 Massachusetts contained more people of Canadian stock than any province except Quebec and On- tario. In that year the eight largest "Canadian" cities were, in order of size: Montreal, Toronto, Boston, Quebec, Chicago, Ottawa, Detroit and New York. Although the percentage dropped substantially in subsequent years, as the population of Canada grew, in 1901 over twenty percent of all Canadian-born people in the world were living in the United States. This diaspora helped to cement a strong bond between the two countries.37 Jews and other Canadians who moved southward included the prosperous and the destitute, the well-educated and the unskilled. No Jews achieved the stature of the most famous gentile Canadian emigrants, such as the business leaders, Erastus Wiman and James J. Hill, and the famous educator, Andrew Dixon White. Some, however, were the scions of Canada's "first" Jewish families, probably, like others in the restless nineteenth century, just living out the wanderlust that gripped many people during the Great Folk Migration. Gershom Joseph, son of the wealthy pioneer trader, Henry Joseph, and brother-in-law of Rabbi Abraham De Sola, was born in Berthier, Lower Canada. In 1849 he followed the golden trail to California, where he made and lost two fortunes. During his four- teen years in the American West, Joseph was associated in business with a French-Canadian emigrant, a cousin of Narcisse F. Belleau (later Sir Nar- cisse), Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec, and he also doubled as a special correspondent of the Montreal Herald. In San Francisco Joseph acquired an American wife of French origin, Celine Lyons, with whom he returned to Montreal in 1863. There he became a respected lawyer and later served as 37.

Frank N. Hart, a member of Canada's "first" Jewish family was the first Jew to complete his medical studies in Canada. A member of the first graduating class in medicine at McGill University in 1835, he left Montreal almost immediately upon graduation for St. Louis, Missouri, where he practiced medicine the rest of his life.39 Another member of the Hart family, Esdaile Cohen David, the youngest son of Dr. Aaron Hart David, had emigrated to Long Island some years before his death in 1890.40 Abraham Pinto Joseph, the oldest son of Montefiore Joseph of Quebec and great-grandson of Henry Joseph, emigrated to Pittsburgh after receiving a degree in electrical engineering from McGill.4' The main motive of Jews, as of other Canadians moving south, was the search for a better livelihood. In the booming United States, Canadians hoped to find the economic security that often eluded them in Canada, even during the prosperous turn-of-the-century "Laurier years." The destitute were often assisted by Canadian-Jewish agencies to search for greater op- portunity across the border.42 As did their coreligionists elsewhere in this period, Canadian Jews looked upon emigration as the ideal solution to poverty. It removed the problem from sight at worst, and at best it enabled the poor to find available jobs elsewhere. In early years, synagogues in Montreal, Hamilton and elsewhere provided indigent members with funds to travel south.43 In 1883, when the influx of Jews to Montreal was still minimal, the local Jewish community panicked, sending immigrants as far 38.

Some reached North Dakota, where they almost starved to death.44 By 1886 so many Jews were being sent out of Montreal that the Young Men's Hebrew Benevolent Society succeeded in getting wholesale rates for its clients on the Delaware and Hudson Railroad, the main route from Montreal to New York City.45 Up to 1906, when the American government cracked down on the practice, the Baron de Hirsch Institute considered one of its major tasks to be the shipping of poor Jews to the United States. As one of its reports openly stated, "in all cases where" pauper Jews "had relations, friends or acquaintances in ... the United States," they were promptly dispatched to them.46 In some years as many as a fourth of all Jewish arrivals to Canada were helped by the Baron de Hirsch Institute to emigrate to the United States.47 Apparently some officials of the Hirsch Institute were so eager to be rid of immigrants, that they smuggled over the border those unable to meet American immigration requirements. A minor scandal erupted in 1905, when the Montreal Star focused public attention on the immigrant-running activities of Institute officials. Two years later, the Institute had to dismiss one of its employees, who was proved by an irate American Commissioner of Immigration in Montreal to have been engaged in immigrant smug- gling.48 Not all the Jewish emigrants from Canada to the United States went in search of a better livelihood. Some Jews went to join relatives or to marry. Canadians in general tended to intermarry with Americans far more readily during these years than with Canadians of other provinces.49 Canadian Jews often sought a mate in the United States, because their own community remained small and the choice of partners limited.50 It was easier and less costly to pursue courtship in the United States than in England or Europe. Canadians were also pulled southward by the attractions of the larger and better-developed cities of the United States, where intellectual and cultural opportunities abounded as they did not in the northern backwater. By 1902 New York had become the largest Jewish city in the world. It would 44. "St. Paul, Minnesota," New York Jewish Messenger, February 15, 1884. 45. Extracts, June 14, 1886. 46.

Reuben Brainin, for instance, served as editor of the Keneder odler for a number of years just before World War I and made a major contribution to the development of the Jewish community of Montreal. He departed for New York after a relative- ly short stay in Canada, despite ambivalence about Jewish life in the larger city. In North America, it was only in New York that he could join the par- ticular kind of Hebrew cultural circle which he sought.5' At all times during the period under review, Jews found it necessary to leave Canada if they were interested in a good Jewish education, although some subsequently returned. Still in the eighteenth century, Aaron Hart sent his four sons to Philadelphia and New York to live with Jewish friends and to receive both a Jewish and a general education. In later years others fol- lowed, and many did not return to Canada. Even at the turn of the twentieth century, Leon Judah Solway of Toronto had to be sent off to the new Rabbi Isaac Elhanan Rabbinical Seminary in New York for rabbinical training.52 Secular education and professional training also drew Canadian Jews and gentiles southward. Canadian graduate schools were as yet only begin- ning in the late nineteenth century. Even staunch nationalists such as Stephen Leacock went to the United States for doctoral studies.53 Among the Jews who studied there in the early years of the twentieth century were Montrealers Solomon Vineberg and Nathaniel Fineberg.54 Jews had a unique motive for doing graduate and professional work out- side of Canada. By the turn of the century, most schools on the continent restricted the number of Jewish students. Since there were very few schools in Canada altogether, it was often necessary for ambitious Jewish students to look elsewhere. This was especially the case with those desiring to attend professional schools. Not surprisingly, the most numerous group of Jewish emigre students was made up of those in the medical professions, medicine, 51.

Aspiring physicians often left for postgraduate studies, then still in their infancy in Canada. Many eventually returned to Canada to practice.55 Although educational and cultural facilities were improving in Canada as the nineteenth century drew to a close, committed Jews still often found the Jewish community too shallow or too uncultivated. Rather than recruit newcomers or strengthen existing institutions, they left for the United States. The acculturated were similarly drawn southward to the more developed centers. V While the United States succeeded in attracting large numbers of Cana- dians during the entire period under review, a smaller but still significant countermovement of Americans to Canada was taking place at the same time. Some of the same forces that propelled Canadians southward, motivated Americans to move northward. The movement was evident from the moment the British armies pushed north in 1759 from New York. As time went on its dimensions grew. Between 1881 and 1911 the American- born population of all Canada rose from 77,753 to 303,680, while that of Quebec and Ontario, where most Jews lived, rose from 64,859 to 85,519. In addition, a large number of partially Americanized transmigrants moved to Canada, as did a significant number of the children born to Canadians liv- ing in the United States.56 Contemporaries estimated that by 1898 half the Jews in Canada had come from or through the United States. Between 1900 and 1920 perhaps 65,000 more Jews immigrated to Canada from there.57 The movement northward began slowly. At the beginning of the period Americans were as ignorant of Canada as Europeans. Jews were no excep- tion. In 1889 at a lecture at the YMHA in New York City, Ferdinand Shack decried the "ignorance about Canada which prevails in the United States." Shack knew of a "college professor living in New York going to Montreal in 55. See Zvi Cohen, ed., Canadian Jewry: Prominent Jews of Canada (Toronto, 1933), pp. 116, 118; "Dr. J. J.

In 1900 and 1901 Carroll Ryan, the gentile editor of the Canadian Jewish Times, published a series of articles in Baltimore's Jewish Comment.62 Other periodicals also began to cover Canada more carefully. Perhaps because he knew Canada at first hand, Alexander Harkavy, the noted lexicographer who had been a Hebrew school teacher in Montreal, included a well-written section on British North America in his Compendium of Mathematical, Physical and Political Geography [Yiddish] (New York, 1911). Abe Cahan, the editor of the New York Forverts, in his History of the United States [Yid- dish] (New York, 1912) discussed Canada's French era in full. These works helped Yiddish-speaking American Jews to become at least superficially ac- quainted with Canada. Still, not all that much was known about America's northern neighbor even in the first decades of the twentieth century. Moreover, as had been the case earlier and was still the case in Europe, a good deal of what was known about the country in the United States was uncomplimentary. Although Carroll Ryan asserted that "Israel [was] happily at home in Canada," he could not deny the existence in 1901 of virulent French-Canadian an- tisemitism.63 New York's Yiddish papers were particularly sensitive to Canadian antisemitism, as they were to antisemitism anywhere.64 American Jews were also aware of the weaknesses of the Canadian- Jewish community in comparison to their own. The partisan antics of Rabbi Meldola De Sola, for instance, made Montreal appear to many to be a 58. "A Half-Hour in Canada," Toronto Globe, April 27, 1889.

Many Jews felt that Quebec's system worked to their particular disadvantage.66 When Americans did decide to come to Canada they felt they were tak- ing a risk. Herman Abramowitz, long-time rabbi of Montreal's Shaar Hashomayim Synagogue, arrived at his post in 1902 from New York. He later recalled that coming to Canada "was like pioneering on distant foreign fields."67 Not a few Americans, who emigrated to Canada during the pre-1914 period, went because they viewed Canada as almost their own, as an exten- sion of the United States. American periodicals often treated Canada as another part of the United States. Canadian items were "domestic news" and not "foreign news" in the American Israelite and the American Hebrew. The annexationist movement retained considerable strength into the early twentieth century on the American side of the border, and few felt that the United States would have difficulty in digesting her northern neighbor.68 Canadians, hungry for Anglo-Saxon immigrants, were even more eager to present their country as congenial to Americans than they were to con- vince Europeans of their American credentials. Official recruiting literature pictured Canada as a country which shared American democracy, "govern- ment of the people, for the people and by the people."69 The country's new- found prosperity was said to resemble that of the United States. So too did the boosterism of her natives. Carroll Ryan claimed that Jewish immigrants [to Canada and others] have found ... a veritable land of promise, where they have experienced but little difficulty in ... laying the foundations of future fortunes.70 A significant factor impelling Americans to move at the end of the nine- teenth century was the disappearance of the American frontier.

A vigorous Canadian government recruiting policy, sparked by a desire to settle the country rapidly, dovetailed with mistaken American fears that their own lands were all occupied. From the 1890s on, the Canadian government offered direct subsidies to American newspapers agreeing to publish favorable articles about life in Canada. Under the direction of Agriculture Minister Clifford Sifton, paid agents fanned out over the United States to attract immigrants to Canada. Singled out for special attention were ethnic and religious groups, which were thought to have better chances of "holding landless offspring on farms."71 Although the Jews were not a preferred group, they too were influenced by the campaign.72 Very few Jews emigrated from the United States at any time. Unlike others, who often came to America to earn enough money to live comfort- ably in Europe, Jews came to stay. There was little nostalgia for Russian or Rumanian pogroms and much awareness that whatever the drawbacks of America, no place was better. From 1908 to 1924 Jews had the lowest rate of emigration from the United States (5.2 percent) of any immigrant group. (Rumanians, with 65.9 percent, had the highest rate, but even the Irish, the group closest to the Jews, left with much greater frequency, 10.1 percent.) The Jew stayed no matter how difficult conditions became.73 That some Jews did leave the United States for Canada is probably testimony to their assumption that that country was very much like the United States if not actually a part of it. In fact, American Jews in Canada tended to retain their loyalty to the United States. In 1931, Jews in Canada had the third highest rate of naturalization of all immigrant groups. American-born Jews, however, ranked fourteenth.74 Like the Canadians who moved south, the Jews who came to Canada from the United States during the period under review were both natives and immigrants, well-to-do and poor, educated and unskilled. Most came from the New York City metropolitan area, where about half the Jews in the 71.

Others, however, came from all over the United States.75 The economic motivation for moving north was one of the strongest. There is evidence of poor Jews, immigrants and natives alike, drifting into Canada from the United States in 1847, in 1863, in 1878, and at other times. Later the prosperous "Laurier years" attracted Jewish and gentile Americans, just as they did Europeans, to Canada. "Many ghettoites from New York ... discovered that industrial and social conditions in Canada ... [were] better than in that congested region. . . .76 Some who came to Canada from the United States during these years to seek their fortune, had been dispatched by American societies for aiding the indigent and the immigrants. Americans sought to export poverty, as did their Canadian and British counterparts. The Hebrew Emigrant Aid Society, hastily set up to meet the emergency of the unprecedented immigra- tion of 1881-82, worked during its short lifetime to disperse immigrants from New York City. In May, 1882, a typical month, it shipped more than fifty newcomers to various destinations in North America, including seven to Montreal.77 In 1901 the Baron de Hirsch Fund in New York established the Industrial Removal Office to help reduce the growing "congestion of the immigrant population in ... the East Side" of the city.78 Fear of an- tisemitism as well as genuine concern for immigrants living in unsalubrious slums motivated the New Yorkers. In the twenty-one years of its existence, the Industrial Removal Office assisted almost 80,000 Jews to leave New York and to resettle in cities all over the continent.79 Yet another agency which encouraged Jews to leave New York was the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), a later incarnation of the 1881 Emigrant Aid Society.

Although no American Jews were as spectacularly successful in their new Canadian home as the gentile immigrant, William C. Van Home, one of the builders of the Canadian Pacific Railway, some did very well.8' Mark Workman, who emigrated to Montreal from his native Buffalo in the 1870s, became a director of the Dominion Steel Company and chairman of the board of the Eastern Trust Company in Montreal.82 Abraham Blumenthal, who came from New York City, became a prosperous Montreal business- man and served on the Montreal city council from 1912 to 1918.83 Not all Americans came to Canada for economic reasons. Marriage between Canadian and American Jews attracted Jews to Canada just as it pulled Canadians to the United States. Often Canadian Jews sought matrimony in an American city. Women generally followed their husbands and contemporary mores dictated that women could not seek out their mates. The normal pattern was, thus, for Canadian men to seek brides in the more populous United States and then to return to Canada with them.84 These international marriages frequently involved the more prominent Jews. The wealthy were more mobile; community leaders were more con- cerned with the religiosity of their children. In 1816 Elkalah Seixas, the daughter of Gershom Mendes Seixas, minister of the Spanish and Por- tuguese Congregation in New York, was married to Benjamin Solomons of Montreal.85 Some years later, Sara Gratz Moses, a niece of Rebecca Gratz, was married to Jacob Henry Joseph of Montreal, another of the sons of Henry Joseph.86 Later in the century socially prominent Abram Moses Vineberg and Clarence I.

Some Americans came to Canada to lose a spouse. In 1884 Rabbi Meldola De Sola performed a marriage ceremony for Jacob Gluffen, a re- cent immigrant to Canada from the United States, and Dora Greenut of Montreal. Soon after, it was discovered that Gluffen already had a wife in the United States. He was subsequently arrested for bigamy.89 A similar case was that of a Philadelphia milliner, who fled to Montreal in 1908 with his paramour. The Baron de Hirsch Institute assisted in tracking down the adulterous hatter, who was later brought to trial.90 Not all searches for deserting husbands were successful. The Baron de Hirsch Institute noted in 1906 that societies in the United States and Europe had helped "many ... deserted wives" to travel to Montreal on a fruitless search for their missing mates. Most arrived penniless and became charges of the Institute. In 1913, according to the National Desertion Bureau in New York, an extraordinary number of wife deserters was still disappearing annually across the northern frontier of the United States.9' Besides bigamists and adulterers, other types of criminals fled from the United States to hoped-for anonymity in Canada during these years. Ha- melis noted in 1884 that the number of Jewish thieves in Canada "was not small," and that most of them had come to Canada from the United States. Criminals, of course, often seek to escape justice by skipping over borders. Doubtless Canada's image as a primitive and unsettled country, encouraged fugitives to think that disappearing in the northern wastes would not be dif- ficult.92 Nineteenth-century wanderlust was another factor that moved Americans north as it did others in all directions. Joseph Simpson was born in Charleston, South Carolina in 1825, of a German-born father and a Nova Scotia-born mother. In 1849, like the Canadian Gershom Joseph, he set out 88.

In 1863, the same year that Joseph returned to Montreal, Simpson removed to Toronto. There he became a successful textile merchant, active in the Jewish community, and well-accepted by upper-class gentiles. Myer Runkel, born in Frankfurt, was taken in 1820, as a child, to Charleston, South Carolina, where he undoubtedly knew Simpson. In 1848 Runkel emigrated to Montreal, where he engaged in business for 18 years. He then returned to the United States, settling in Cincinnati, and later, in New York City. There were numerous others.93 Perhaps the greatest opportunity for wanderlust to be expressed comes in wartime. And, indeed, war in North America occasioned traffic both northward to Canada and southward to the United States. Of course, ideology and other motivations also lay behind the wartime movement. Some Americans, in wartime, fled to peaceful Canada to avoid becoming in- volved. Adventuresome Canadians went south to volunteer in American wars, looking for the excitement unavailable at home. Out of "loyalism or at least homesickness for British institutions," many residents of the thirteen original American colonies moved north during or following the Revolution. From that time on "United Empire Loyalists" made up a significant part of the Anglo-Canadian population. Among them was a number of Jews, such as the Montreal merchant, Levi Michaels, and his son, Myer. "Most of the Loyalists had relations and friends still residing in the States, and although they differed with them over the issues of the Revolution, they were interested in one another's personal fortunes and opinions. Letters and occasional visits kept their friendship alive .... "94 If the thirteen original colonies produced their Loyalists, Canada had many rebel sympathizers. Among these also were Jews. Levi (Levy) Solomons of Montreal was purveyor to American hospitals in Canada dur- ing the American invasion. He was exiled for his sympathies, and then even- tually allowed to return to Canada. By 1778 Solomons had been sufficiently rehabilitated to be elected an officer of the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue in Montreal.95 Another Canadian Jew, who sympathized with the Revolution, was the Quebec merchant, Eleazar Levy.

Franks, left Montreal for Philadelphia to aid the Revolutionary cause in 1775. He became aide-de-camp to General Benedict Arnold. After being acquitted of complicity in Arnold's treason, Franks became vice-consul for the United States in Marseilles. Doubtless the French he knew from his Montreal days served him well in France.97 Most Canadian Jews supported the loyalist cause during the Revolution, as did their gentile neighbors. Most American Jews supported the Revolu- tion. But Jews did cross the lines, together with the minority of non-Jewish partisans. The Civil War, although it did not involve Canada in any direct way, also produced a significant movement back and forth across the border. Its bloody horrors sent a wave of draft dodgers, called "skedaddlers," and deserters scurrying over the northern border of the Union. As in more re- cent times, most returned home when they could, although some remained permanently in Canada. The draft law of 1862 produced the first large movement, and "every subsequent order of conscription provoked another wave in the current." At the same time, not a few Canadians were going south to fight the "battle for the glory of the Lord." Both streams contained a representative number of Jews.98 During the War, Mrs. Samuel Roman's Jewish boarding house on Chen- neville Street in Montreal was the "rendezvous for a large number of men from the United States, who found a home under her hospitable roof."99 In 1861 Joseph Moses, son of Dr. Gratz Moses of St. Louis, nephew of Rebec- ca Gratz, was packed off to his family in Montreal "to keep him out of the way of mischief."'00 Some Jews emigrated to Canada after having already served in the war, such as Samuel Stern, who arrived in Toronto in 1862.

As many as 50,000 Canadians participated actively in the War, most of them on the northern side. Of these the largest number came from the ranks of Canadians resident in the United States, of whom there were some 250,000 in 1860.102 According to Adolphus Mordecai Hart, four-fifths of the Canadians in the Union forces were French Canadians, who suffered some 15,000 dead.'03 Canadian Jews who fought included Hart's first cousin, Arthur Wellington Hart, at one time a newspaper editor in Scranton, Penn- sylvania, who rose to the rank of colonel in the Union forces. Another was Montrealer, Jacob Rubenstein.'04 Canadian Jews, as well as French Canadians, generally sympathized with the Union cause in the war. Among Anglo-Canadians there was much more enthusiasm for the southern cause, just as there was in Britain. French Canadians already had come to view themselves as subject people, and might have been expected to align themselves against slavery, and perhaps also against a prosouthern Britain. Jews retained memories of persecution, and found it hard to make peace with the subjugation of others. Although southern Jews and some northern Jews saw things differently, and although Anglo-Montreal was a "community ... full of southern sympathizers," Canadian Jews remained stubbornly pro-Union. The Jacob Henry Josephs of Montreal were typical. They held fast to their northern loyalties even when sympathy for the southern cause peaked in Canada, as at the time of the raid on St. Albans, Vermont, organized from Montreal in 1864. They were, no doubt, influenced by their American relatives, who lived in the North.'05 The Civil War was an American and not a Canadian affair. Its spillover into Canada clearly demonstrated, however, that despite the border, North America was, in many ways, one. As was not often the case, Jews, like other Canadians, had to choose between English and American sympathies. The 102. Brebner, pp. 165-66. 103.

This was one of the few occasions when Jews did not see eye-to-eye with their fellow Anglo-Canadians. Canadians and Americans, then, moved across the border with impunity to settle in the nineteenth century. They thereby cemented the ties between the peoples of the two countries, and insured that they would be very much like each other. Most people were drawn north or south in search of a more secure livelihood. Others, however, emigrated to receive an education, to marry, or to find a community more to their needs and liking. Some Cana- dians were moved to seek out a larger and more developed Jewish com- munity. This remained the case even at the turn of the century, despite the rapid growth of both the Montreal and Toronto Jewish communities. Jews generally followed the emigration patterns established by other Canadians, Americans and transmigrants. Like gentiles, they were responding to the widely held conceptions of Canada in the United States and of the United States in Canada, as well as to economic and emotional needs. Jews were also gravitating toward that country, which more than any other, seemed to offer a secure and bright future to them as individuals and as Jews, the United States. VI As they did in their relationships with coreligionists in England, Cana- dian Jews established a variety of links with American Jews. These ties were personal, economic, religious and communal. They were very strong and paralleled the connections of gentile Anglo-Canadians with Americans, reflecting their common origins. Such ties had a great deal to do with deter- mining the character of Canadian Jewry. The border areas of the two countries were at all times to a great degree one economic and social unit. Citizens of both countries crossed the border to shop and to market their goods. Doctors and clergymen ministered to patients and congregants on both sides of the border.'06 After the comple- tion of the Canadian transcontinental railroad system, it was still easier and more natural for traffic, Jewish and gentile, to flow north-south than east- west. All major Canadian centers of population were close to the American 106. Hansen and Brebner, pp. 76-77; Brebner, p. 133. 46</page><page sequence="27">AMERICAN CONNECTION OF CANADIAN JEWS border. Both Montreal and Toronto, where most Jews lived, were less than 100 miles from the United States, and even the Hirsch agricultural colony in Saskatchewan was but fifteen miles from the border. Being near to the United States facilitated contacts of all sorts in a period of increasingly rapid communications and population mobility. 07 The most immediate bond between American and Canadian Jews was that of family and friends. Most Canadian Jews had close relatives in the United States.108 In addition, Jews who moved from one country to the other retained sentimental ties to their place of origin. American Jews who emigrated to Canada during the period reserved "a warm corner in their hearts for the 'Stars and Stripes,"'" while Canadians in the United States kept up associations with their place of birth.'09 Hiram N. Vineberg, for ex- ample, was for a time president of the McGill Graduates' Society in New York, while I. G. Ascher, a founder of the Young Men's Hebrew Benevolent Society of Montreal, kept in touch with the affairs of the Society long after he had moved to New York.110 As the nineteenth century progressed and communications, especially the railroads, improved, tourist and family visits across the border became more frequent. Jews, generally prosperous, participated in these visits alongside other Americans and Canadians able to afford travel. American Jews with Canadian relatives went to Canada to visit;"' Canadians more frequently went south. Canadians were to be found at popular American watering places even during the turbulent Civil War years. The Jacob Henry Josephs were regular visitors to Cape May, New Jersey, Silver Spring, Maryland, and Saratoga, New York, in the mid-nineteenth century. They also frequently visited their family in Philadelphia. 12 Rabbi Abraham De Sola traveled more than most. 107. See Moffett, pp. 52-73; E. N.

In New York City he visited his sister, Jane Belais, and his nephew, Rev. H. Pereira Mendes, after 1877 minister of the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue there. He was invited to special events in Plattsburg, just across the border from Montreal, and he spent time with the fashionable people of the day, like Rebecca Gratz in Philadelphia, to whom he was distantly related by marriage.13 By the end of the nineteenth century, travel between the two countries was swift and inexpensive. "The average Canadian . . . [became at least] as familiar with an American as with a Canadian of another province."" 14 The social columns of the Canadian Jewish Times record frequent visits to New York, Chicago, Detroit, Boston, Philadelphia and other American centers. Old Orchard, Maine became a favorite watering spot of wealthy Montreal Jews. Abraham De Sola and two of his sons, Meldola and Clarence I., would all die while visiting in the United States, Abraham in 1882, Meldola in 1918, and Clarence in 1920."5 Americans also traveled a great deal to Canada by the end of the cen- tury. The urge of Americans to visit a foreign country was great, and trans- Atlantic travel was still slow and costly. Canada provided an inexpensive foreign alternative. Probably the most noteworthy American-Jewish tourist in Canada dur- ing the period was Oscar Straus. In 1906 Straus, then Secretary of Com- merce and Labor, came to Canada partly on government business. While in Montreal, he visited the Baron de Hirsch Institute."6 Like the later visit of Herbert Samuel, the Jewish Postmaster-General of Great Britain, that of Straus probably served to remind Canadian Jews that their brethren in other English-speaking countries were advancing farther and faster in public life than they themselves were."7 113.

The same kind of unfavorable comparison of the lot of Canadian Jewry to that of co- religionists in other lands was made on the occasion of the visit of the Rt. Hon. Herbert Samuel, Postmaster General of Great Britain, to Montreal in 1913. See, for example, "L'Hon. M. Samuel au Montefiore Club," Montreal La patrie, October 10, 1913. 48</page><page sequence="29">AMERICAN CONNECTION OF CANADIAN JEWS As important as the ties of sentiment and blood in cementing the Canadian-American relationship, were the business and institutional relationships that developed during the period. This was a time during which trade between the United States and Canada grew many fold. In earlier years Canadian trade with Great Britain generally outstripped that with the United States. By 1876, however, Canadian imports from the United States exceeded those from Britain, and by 1905 they reached a value two and half times that of goods imported from Britain. After 1875 the value of Canadian exports to the United States regularly exceeded the value of exports to Britain. All this growth took place in the face of increasingly high American tariffs and lower British tariffs.'8 Canada's "national policy" encouraged the establishment of branch plants. The movement of capital, machines and know-how was accom- panied by the movement of men. American speculators and entrepreneurs were to be found everywhere in Canada in the nineteenth century. American stocks were traded on Canadian exchanges and New York quotations were telegraphed to Canada. Even the Roman Catholic Church in Quebec par- ticipated with Americans in development schemes. Increasingly there was but one business community in North America."9 Many Canadian Jews were petty traders, second-hand dealers and retail merchants. As such they had few American business ties. Others, however, participated in the continentalization of Canadian business. American- Jewish firms established Canadian branches. Canadian-Jewish firms sold American-made products or otherwise traded across the border. Canadian Jews traveled to the United States to sell their wares and Americans came north to do the same. A great many Canadians went south to shop, where goods were cheaper and of greater variety than at home.'20 Occasionally even disreputable business was conducted across the border. In 1908, for in- stance, a New York Jew was jailed in Kingston, Ontario, for smuggling furs into Canada.'2' A few Canadian Jews were involved in the increasing penetration of 118.

Lester Rice, a native of Russia, who worked for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, was transferred from New York to Montreal in 1904. Archibald Coplan, another Russian- born Jew, had worked for an American company while still in Vilna. He was transferred first to Germany, then to the United States, and finally to Ot- tawa in 1905.122 Mortimer Davis of Montreal sold out his large Canadian tobacco firm to the giant American Tobacco Company, an international monopoly, early in the present century. Davis then served as president of the Canadian operations of the firm. He was also a director of the United States Rubber Company.'23 Like businessmen Canadian laborers had growing contacts with their American counterparts during these years. Much of the early unionization in Canada occurred under American influence. American unions sent organizers into Canada. They supported Canadian laborers in their strikes and also exported some of their own labor problems. In 1912 a Montreal tailors' strike came about largely as a spillover of the major strikes which had occurred earlier that year in New York and other large American cities. Already by 1909, Canadian-American labor ties were sufficiently close for the American Federation of Labor, headed by the English-born Jew, Samuel Gompers, to hold its annual convention in Toronto.'24 Jewish labor unions in Canada were generally the offspring of American parent unions. In 1890 the first congress of Jewish labor organizations in North America, held in New York City, decided to found a central union, the Hebrew Labor Federation of the United States and Canada. Among the few delegates of the Congress from places other than New York were Montrealers. 125 The Jewish or largely Jewish unions with the closest American connec- tions were those in the needle trades. Jewish tailors in Montreal organized the first Canadian branch of the United Garment Workers of America in 122. Zvi Cohen, pp. 151, 230. 123.

So too were cultural and intellectual affairs. Not only for Jews, but for all non-French Canadians in this period, the hubs of the intellectual universe lay outside Canada. The European centers were far away. It was, however, no more difficult for Montrealers or Torontonians to communicate with New York than it was for them to com- municate with each other. Although intellectual and scholarly activity developed in both cities in the nineteenth century, they remained provincial outposts for a long time. When, in 1849, Rabbi Abraham De Sola received the coveted appointment of lecturer in Oriental languages at McGill Univer- sity, the "university" had only a handful of students, a muddy, broken- down, undeveloped campus, and an unpaid faculty, including the prin- cipal.'28 In contrast, the United States had larger cities, older institutions (Harvard had been founded in 1636.), and, by the mid-nineteenth century, an established intellectual tradition. If the United States had rough cultural edges by European standards, it was Athens in the classical period in com- parison to Anglo-Canada. Understandably then, Canadians with intellec- tual aspirations, and the Jews among them, sought to be part of the American scene. Just as frequently they invited American intellectuals to come north to enlighten them. The first Canadian-Jewish literary figure, Isidore Gordon Ascher, con- tributed his poetry to the New York Jewish Messenger and to other American publications. When his 1863 volume of poetry, Voices from the Hearth (Montreal), received critical acclaim in Boston, he felt secure enough to return to England to continue his endeavors.'29 Adolphus Mordecai Hart, one of the early intellectuals of Canadian Jewry, wrote on American themes and published in the United States. Hart lived for seven years in New York, where he was active in Democratic Party pamphleteering and 126. Abraham Rhinewine, "The Jewish Labour Movement in Canada," in Arthur Daniel Hart, p. 460. 127.

It is an indication of the extent to which Canadians were at home in American intellectual and political circles, that Hart could cross the border, write effective tracts on behalf of New York Governor and Democratic presidential candidate, Horatio Seymour, and then return home to Montreal to practice law and write political tracts dealing with Canadian issues.'30 Abraham De Sola published and spoke extensively in the United States. He wrote for the Occident and American Jewish Advocate in Philadelphia, the Jewish Messenger, the Asmonean and the American Hebrew in New York, and the Cincinnati Hebrew Review. The prayerbook he edited was published in Philadelphia. His writing and public appearances in the United States were of sufficient volume to invite offers from American lyceum agents to represent him and to make him a welcome guest in American publishing houses.'3' From the significance the rabbi placed on his American connections, it is possible to understand a great deal about Canadian attitudes toward the United States. It was very important to De Sola to be accepted by the more sophisticated American public. In 1872 the rabbi delivered the invocation before the United States House of Representatives. He was not the first Jew to do so, but he was the first foreigner. The event was of some note, but only a provincial on the make could possibly have created the fuss over the ap- pearance that De Sola did. He and his friends regarded the offering of a prayer in the American Congress as the capstone of his long career. At home and in letters to England the appearance was touted. It was dubiously claimed that the invocation had been commanded by President Ulysses S. Grant. No one of De Sola's acquaintance was permitted to remain ignorant of the great event. The rabbi's attitude bore all the marks of a sense of in- feriority regarding the United States, one not unique to De Sola among Canadians of the Victorian period.'32 130.

On one occasion the prime minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, spoke at a banquet in New York, and the Montreal Jewess, Edith (Ellen?) Ballon, a music student, also appeared on the program.'33 Goldwin Smith, Toronto professor, intellectual panjandrum and antisemite, was a frequent visitor to the United States, as were other Canadian scholars,'34 and American guests were a must at Canadian cultural events of all sorts. Canadians belonged to American scholarly and intellectual associations. Max Steinkopf of Winnipeg, for instance, a cousin by marriage of Oscar Straus, was treasurer of the Archaeological Institute of America for a number of years during the period.'35 Other Jews participated in American- Jewish cultural organizations. Clarence I. De Sola was a member of the American Jewish Historical Society and an active participant in its proceedings. 36 Canadians grew accustomed to reading American journals and books. One reason for this fact was that up to 1906 Canadian postal rates for American periodicals were significantly lower than those for British and other "foreign" publications. But even thereafter reading habits did not change a great deal. 137 Minority groups in Canada, with their small and recently-arrived pop- ulation, tended to rely more heavily than other Canadians on the United States for their cultural fare. Only in 1910 did Canadian Slovaks first try to publish their own journal. Even then it had to be edited and produced from Chicago.'38 Although Italians in Canada after 1895 had their own paper, Corriere del Canada, they tended nonetheless to read Italian-American publications.'39 Canadian Jews had no periodical of their own until 1897. They read the American Israelite, the American Hebrew, the Jewish Messenger, and the Hebrew Standard.'40 The amount of Canadian news in those journals, in 133.

Some Canadians, most notably Rabbi Abraham De Sola, wrote for the American-Jewish press, and after 1897 Canadians freely reprinted articles from it.'4' On occasion Canadian Jews wrote for the general American press.'42 When Montrealers were finally able to found a Yiddish-language paper in 1907, they still found themselves dependent on the United States. Techni- cians came from New York to set up the Keneder odler, which, throughout its history, has provided full coverage of the New York Jewish scene. (So too did other Montreal papers. The Star, for instance, had a regular column, "New York Gossip," at the turn of the century.)143 Yet another Canadian-Jewish cultural institution which drew heavily upon the United States for models and manpower was the Yiddish theater. In Montreal it was a Russian-Jewish immigrant from New York, who first brought Yiddish theater to the city; and two years later, in 1898, a whole troupe of American players from Boston immigrated there. The French- Canadian Monument National was transformed into a Jewish playhouse by "Yiddish theatrical companies from New York" in the early years of the twentieth century. In Toronto, as well, the New York Yiddish theater was much in evidence.'44 As well as in the cultural realm, extensive exchanges between Canadians and Americans occurred during these years in the religious sphere. Contem- porary lists of ministers show that Canadian Christians were quite depen- dent on the United States in the early nineteenth century, partly because Canadians had not yet begun to train clergy on a large scale.'45 Along with England, the United States was Canada's chief source of Jewish ministers and of lesser synagogue officiants as well. The United States was the main destination of departing Canadian clergy all during the period. In later years pulpits were exchanged frequently. 141.

David Piza in Montreal between 1838 and 1845, Myer Levy of New York came to fill in for him from time to time. In 1846, when the newly hired Abraham De Sola could not arrive in Montreal before the High Holy Days, the congregation turned again to Levy.146 Sex- tons and teachers of the two early Montreal synagogues both came from and went back to the United States; and when the Toronto Hebrew Congregation took on its first clergyman, they hired Rev. Hyman Goldberg of New York, a combination rabbi, cantor and ritual animal slaughterer.'47 The Hamilton congregation engaged as its first rabbi, Wolf Landau, late of Zanesville, Ohio, and Honesdale, Pennsylvania.'48 Generally the Jewish clergy who came to Canada were immigrants and not native Americans. Often they were not first-raters. One of the earliest sextons of the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue in Montreal, Mr. Mendells never performed satisfactorily and constantly demanded more pay. Letters were written to New York and Philadelphia on several occa- sions in an attempt to find a replacement. At last Mendells was sent packing to an unsuspecting congregation in the western United States.'49 In later years the Canadian pulpit became largely Americanized, and the caliber of men attracted to Canada improved steadily. Toronto, Hamilton, Ottawa, Winnipeg, Regina, and other cities were served by clergy who came from the United States. In Montreal the American presence was especially marked. 50 In 1881 the Anglophile German and Polish Synagogue of Montreal called to its pulpit Rev. Samuel Marks of Chicago. From 1898 on that pulpit was occupied exclusively by rabbis who were Americans or who had American training. In that year Bernard Michael Kaplan, a recent graduate of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, was summoned to the congregation. Kaplan stayed in Montreal for four years, after which he left 146. MSP, August 24, 1846; "History of the Jewish Communal Bodies of Montreal," Cana- dian Jewish Times, December 11, 1899. 147.

Kaplan's successor at the synagogue was Herman Abramowitz. Abramowitz, like Kaplan, was Russian born, and a graduate of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York. He was enormously successful in Montreal, serving the congregation until his death in 1947.151 The Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue was led throughout the period by the Rabbis De Sola. But it, too, was touched by American presence. Its assistant minister from 1882 to 1902 was Abraham Kirschberg, who had spent a number of years in New York, and who had close family connec- tions there. Other lesser officiants over the years also came from or through New York.152 Some of the synagogues of the eastern-European immigrants, who came to Canada after 1881, were also headed by clergymen, who had been at least partially Americanized. Solomon Beir Sprince, rabbi of Montreal's Beth Midrash Hagodal Chevra Shaas Synagogue after 1902, had previously served in Patterson, New Jersey and Portland, Oregon. 53 Sprince's predecessor was Aaron M. Ashinsky. Rabbi Ashinsky, who had a major im- pact on the Montreal Jewish community during his five years' tenure, had spent a decade in the United States before coming to Canada. He knew English well and had become acquainted with American communal innova- tions, such as the afternoon Hebrew school, which he introduced to Montreal. 54 The most American of all Canadian-Jewish pulpits were those of the few Reform congregations. Hamilton's Reform congregation was generally served by American ministers, while Toronto's Holy Blossom Temple was steadily pushed in the direction of Reform by congregants, who had lived in the United States. Among the laymen who founded Montreal's Temple Emanu-El in 1882 were several who had become acquainted with Reform Judaism while living in the United States. From its inception that congrega- tion was served by clergy who came from the United States. Since 1901 every rabbi of Emanu-El has been a graduate of the Hebrew Union College 151.

The most distinguished American rabbi of the congregation during the period under review was Russian-born and New Orleans reared Nathan Gordon. In 1908 Gordon succeeded to Abraham De Sola's old post at McGill, as lecturer in Oriental languages. In 1916 Gordon became a lawyer, and subsequently served for many years as president of the temple of which he had once been rabbi.155 Since there were always many fewer Canadian than American congrega- tions, clergymen seeking a new pulpit naturally looked to the south. Those who had originally come from the United States were, of course, drawn there. For others, eager to become part of the freewheeling Judaism of the United States, conservative, but North American Canada served as a way station on the journey from Europe. Barnett Elzas and Abraham Lazarus, for example, both of whom had come to Toronto's Holy Blossom Congregation from England, went on to more successful careers in less traditional American congregations.'56 Isidore Meyers, who came to Shaar Hashomayim in Montreal from Australia in 1896 and moved on to San Francisco a year later, is another example of a European who paused in Canada on the way to the United States.'57 Discontented clergymen, like other Canadians during this period, were attracted to the United States and hoped to find there greater opportunity. When Jacob Raphael Cohen had to sue the Montreal congregation for his wages in 1782, he moved on to New York.'58 Abraham De Sola himself threatened to leave Montreal for Philadelphia in 1850, when his salary fell into arrears. Two years later, he was elected to the ministry of Micve Israel Congregation in Savannah, Georgia. He chose not to leave, however, as he did not in 1868, when he was offered the prestigious pulpit of the recently deceased Isaac Leeser in Philadelphia. 59 Joseph Kornfeld was a Montreal rabbi who came from the United States and returned there.

Later he became minister to Persia under President Warren G. Harding, and still later an insurance salesman. Service in Canada and other places had ap- parently discouraged the rabbi thoroughly with his sacred vocation.'60 From the earliest years, Jewish clergymen crossed the border to assist congregations not having their own rabbi. During the thirty years between 1810 and 1840, when Montreal Jews had no regular clergyman of their own, it was not uncommon for a rabbi and especially a mohel to make the ar- duous trip from New York to attend to their needs. The mohel (ritual cir- cumciser) would ride circuit, circumcising all the male children born since the previous such visit.'6' In later years that favor would be reciprocated, when Montreal mohalim would visit Plattsburg and other American border towns to initiate Jewish males into the covenant of Abraham.'62 Once railroad transportation became fast enough to make it practicable, there was considerable exchange of pulpits between New York and Montreal. Rabbi Morris J. Raphall of New York came to Montreal to speak at the cornerstone-laying ceremony of the new German and Polish Congregation in 1859. A year later at the consecration of the completed building, yet another New York minister, Samuel Meyer Isaacs, was the speaker.'63 Interestingly, both men had emigrated to the United States from England (although Raphall was Swedish-born, and Isaacs Dutch-born), and both retained strong ties to the mother country of Canadian Jews. When Abraham De Sola died in New York in 1882, his nephew, Henry Pereira Mendes, and several lay leaders of New York's Spanish and Por- tuguese Synagogue accompanied the corpse back to Montreal. Mendes delivered the eulogy at the funeral.'64 Americans frequently preached at Toronto and Montreal synagogues on special occasions in subsequent years. 65 160.

Rabbi Abraham De Sola preached in New York synagogues and officiated at weddings and other ceremonies in Plattsburg and Ogdensburg, New York, and in other places.166 Meldola De Sola was a fixture in New York, where he preached often at the Spanish and Por- tuguese Synagogue and elsewhere. At meetings of the Union of Orthodox Congregations, of which he was one of the founders, De Sola's outspoken presence was always felt.'67 Even ex-Jews of the convert subculture moved north and south during these years. In the 1870s, the newly converted Charles Freshman and the earlier Canadian apostate, Isaac Hellmuth, exchanged visits with "Mr. Meyer, a converted Jew of New York."'68 In Toronto in 1911 a two-and-a- half hour riot followed the proselytizing sermon of a Jewish convert to Christianity from Louisville, Kentucky. 69 The religious connection between the American and Canadian Jewish communities consisted of much more than exchanges of clergymen. During his long tenure in Montreal, Abraham De Sola's writings in American publications made him so well known, that he received questions about religious practice from American Jews, and gentiles wrote to him about con- verting to Judaism, healing by electromagnetism, and any number of other issues. 70 In the early years, New York was an important source of liturgical supplies for Canadians.'71 Later, American prayerbooks came to be used in 23, 1892; "To-morrow's Anniversary," Montreal Star, December 29, 1893; "A Denver Rabbi Taken to Account," Montreal Daily Herald, July 10, 1897; CCAR Yearbook, 1897, pp. vi-xiii; "Abroad," Ha-melis, Av 10, 1898; "Montreal, Canada," American Israelite, December 26, 1901; "Noted Jewish Scholar Visiting City," Canadian Jewish Times, February 17, 1911. 166.

Their small number made Canadians more often the recipients of aid, but occasionally they sent funds to needy American Jews, as they did in 1853, to the yellow fever victims of New Orleans' Shangarai Chassed Congregation.'77 In later years Americans, like their English counterparts, grew reluctant to aid the increasingly prosperous Canadians especially as American needs for charity increased, because of the large influx of Russian Jews.178 Probably the most significant American-Jewish religious influence on Canadian Jews was ideological. The religious movements into which American Jewry came to be organized by the first years of the twentieth cen- tury spilled over into Canada. All three branches of American Judaism found their adherents in Canada, and Canadian Judaism, too, began to be organized along tripartite American lines. The Jewish Theological Seminary and its offspring, the Conservative Movement, established a Montreal branch, largely for fund raising, in 1904. The sponsors were Hiram Levy, Lazarus Cohen, and Rabbi Herman Abramowitz of Shaar Hashomayim Synagogue.'79 That synagogue became 172.

Rabbi Abramowitz felt that Conservative Judaism had arrived in Montreal just at the right time. Radical religious tendencies had begun to manifest themselves and were making headway. But these were checked ... by the suc- cessful harmonization of Jewish tradition with modernity [that characterized American Conservatism].'80 In fact, Canadian Jews, with their British connections, were never religiously innovative. From the beginning, those who were affiliated witl the Conservative Movement found themselves on the right of the move- ment. The radical tendencies of American Reform made many Canadian rabbis and congregations hesitate about even slight deviations from Orthodoxy. Thus Meldola De Sola, when invited to become a member of the new Seminary, refused, fearing it was not sufficiently traditional.'81 Already in 1893 De Sola and his brother Clarence were agitating in the United States for the formation of an "Orthodox Organization." Five years later the Union of Orthodox Congregations was formed with Rabbi De Sola, who remained active to his death, as its first vice-president. A number of Canadian congregations affiliated with the Union.'82 The oldest of the American-Jewish denominations made slow headway in Canada. As late as 1953, there were but three Reform congregations in the entire country.'83 Reform rites were adopted in 1882 in both Hamilton and Montreal, although the two congregations and their rabbis were not quick to affiliate formally with the Union of American Hebrew Congrega- tions and the Central Conference of American Rabbis. Only in 1901 did Montreal's Temple Emanu-El join the Union. In 1897, when the Central Conference of American Rabbis held its convention in Montreal, Rabbi Hartog Veld, the host rabbi was not yet a member.'84 Toronto had no of- ficial Reform synagogue until after World War I, when Holy Blossom Tem- ple joined the movement. But, as noted earlier, the Temple moved steadily 180. As quoted in Figler, Abramowitz, pp. 89-90. 181. SPNY, January 7, 1886. 182.

One of the changes that occurred in American-Jewish life around the turn of the century was the increasing variety of communal activities accom- panied by the growth and proliferation of quasi-secular institutions. America was becoming a land of organizations and institutions, and American Jews were following the patterns of their gentile neighbors. The new organizations represented a response both to the increasing complexity of society and to the growth of leisure time. As was the case with Jewish cultural and religious affairs, organizational life embraced the whole conti- nent, although to some extent Canadians transformed American models and ideas to meet Canadian conditions. The Social Gospel movement, with its belief in human improvement through the reform of society, affected both Jewish and gentile North Americans.'85 Like their American and English cousins, Canadian Jews were inspired to establish Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew As- sociations. These, like the YM and YWCA'S after which they were modeled, were designed to provide a wholesome setting for uprooted and newly ur- banized people to meet together. In Montreal the YMHA was founded in 1908. Four years later it was the second largest in the world, with over 1,200 members, just behind New York's. By 1913 the movement had spread to Toronto, Vancouver and Winnipeg.'86 Other institutions copied from New York included the Montreal Jewish Library, which had modest beginnings as a reading room in 1903, and the Jewish People's University. The latter was founded by Reuben Brainin in 1914 to provide adult education for the Montreal Jewish masses. Its work was similar to that which Brainin had seen in the Educational Alliance on New York's lower East Side.'87 Two major institutions of Canadian Jewry were direct translations of American models, although they evolved out of local needs and acquired their own distinctly Canadian personality. By 1914 Montreal Jews, like their counterparts in many American communities, had become increasingly dis- turbed by waste and duplication in Jewish welfare services. Up to that time, 185. See J. S. Woodsworth, My Neighbor, 2d ed. (Toronto, 1913), pp. 52, 72-73; Richard Allen, "The Social Gospel and the Reform Tradition in Canada, 1880-1925," Canadian Historical Review 44 (1968), passim. 186.

At the behest of the Baron de Hirsch Institute, Montreal's largest and most successful agency, a study was undertaken of the New York Federation. It was recommended that Montreal adopt the New York model "and show the way to the rest of Canada."'8 Federation was eventually achieved in Montreal, and an American was hired to head the new superagency. 89 Other communities fol- lowed suit. More important was the movement toward a national Canadian-Jewish organization. The Congress movement sought to unite all Jewish organiza- tions in the Dominion under one roof. It did not achieve even limited suc- cess until 1919, just beyond the period under review. Its genesis was in the early years of the twentieth century, however, and it began to gather steam seriously in 1914. No little inspiration was gained from the short-lived Kehilla (united community) movement in New York City with which Cana- dian Jews were quite familiar from their own press. The American Jewish Congress, finally established in 1918, was originally intended to be a Zionist, national, popular roof organization. It provided another model. This was also a period in Canada when the union movement among Protestant churches was gaining strength, and that, too, may have provided a spur to the Jewish Congress movement.'90 It was not only models that American Jews provided their Canadian co- religionists. There were few American-Jewish organizations of the period which did not actually colonize Canada. Charitable, fraternal and national institutions, all established Canadian branches or enlisted Canadian members in American chapters. One of the most naturally international charitable endeavors was im- migrant aid work. Hebrew Emigrant Aid Societies existed in Montreal and Toronto in 1881 and 1882 as well as in American cities from New York to St. Louis. In June, 1882, the various societies convened a conference in New York "to arrange for the proper reception and distribution of Russian refugees." Among those who attended the conference were Mona Lesser and Ferdinand Boas of Montreal and Mark Samuel of Toronto. Boas 188.

It was not a very promising start. The delegates recommended that immigration cease at once. Sir Alexander T. Gait, Canadian High Commissioner in London, telegraphed to the con- ference that Canada could accept no additional refugees. The American delegates, largely of German-Jewish origin, were no more eager to have them in their country.192 The later Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society was a more successful venture, although Canadian participation was minimal. In 1913 the National Board of Directors of the Immigrant Aid Society had 918 American members, two Canadians, and one Puerto Rican.'93 There was more Canadian-American cooperation in the North American operations of the Jewish Colonization Association-Baron de Hirsch Fund, with headquarters in New York. When originally asked for help by the Young Men's Hebrew Benevolent Society of Montreal in 1890, the Fund refused. It was felt that its endowment had been given by Baron de Hirsch for use exclusively in the United States. After the turn of the century, however, the Fund undertook to assist Jewish settlers in Canada as well as in the United States. Assistance was given through the daughter agency of the fund, the Jewish Agricultural and Industrial Aid Society. Loans were made to individual settlers, and the Society sent its personnel to Canada to inspect and advise. Eventually the Baron de Hirsch Institute of Montreal as- sumed responsibility for all purely Canadian matters.'94 Still more successful cooperation characterized the new Zionist move- ment. Although for the most part Canadian Zionism developed in- dependently of the American organization, there were some important areas of interconnection.

A year later a joint Canadian-American delegation traveled to Palestine to investigate set- tlement opportunities, since the group actually expected that its members would settle in agricultural colonies in Palestine. After the delegates returned, a fund was established to purchase lands for colonization, although few Canadians or Americans ever took advantage of it.'95 Other American Zionist groups also established early Canadian beach- heads. Perhaps the strongest was that of the labor Zionist organization, Poalei Zion. This group, the forerunner of the present-day Israel Labor Party, was born in Europe. By the turn of the century it had a widespread network of chapters including several in the United States. In 1905 the New York chapter established a branch in Montreal. A year later groups had been formed in Toronto, Winnipeg and Hamilton. In 1910 the American Poalei Zion held their annual convention in Montreal, bringing to the city major Zionist figures and greatly stimulating Canadian interest in Zionism. During its entire history, the Canadian group has remained under the in- fluence of New York headquarters.'96 Other Zionist organizations, which spread from the United States to Canada, were the left-wing Farband Labor Zionist Order, the Orthodox Zionist organization, Mizrahi, and the Federa- tion of Young Judea.'97 Besides their formal organizational ties, Canadian and American Zionists cooperated in other ways. The Zionist-Yiddish orator, Zvi Hirsch Masliansky, visited Montreal from time to time after 1898, as did other Zionist personalities.'98 Sometimes Canadian Zionists addressed their con- freres in the United States.199 Zionists, who were mostly first-generation, eastern-European Jews, thought of themselves as Jewish nationalists. They had little enthusiasm for any nationality other than Jewish nationality. They regarded as their landslayt (countrymen) Jews wherever they lived; and all gentiles, Canadian, American or other, were goyim (foreigners, outsiders). 195.

These orders served as mutual-aid societies and as social clubs providing vital services for their members in an era when governments offered little in the way of social welfare benefits. Jews figured prominently in bringing the largest nonsectarian European order, the Freemasons, to America. Jewish orders had their origins in America. From the first, Cana- dians affiliated with the American orders, such as the B'nai B'rith, the An- cient Jewish Order Kesher Shel Barzel, and the Deborah Ladies' Aid Society.20' They also joined American lodges of gentile orders, such as the Masons, when Canadian lodges placed impediments in the way of Jewish membership.202 The oldest and most successful of the orders was the International Order B'nai B'rith (hereafter referred to as IOBB). Most of its early members were German Jews, who were not very numerous in Canada. Perhaps for that reason the Ancient Jewish Order Kesher Shel Barzel was, at first, more suc- cessful in Canada, and the IOBB got off to a slow start. The first Canadian lodge of the B'nai B'rith was established in Toronto in 1875, thirty-two years after the founding of the order. Six years later a lodge was established in Montreal and in 1886 an additional one in Victoria, British Columbia. The Canadian lodges were under the jurisdiction of American "Grand Lodges," the eastern ones under New York and the Victoria lodge under San Francisco. But Americans were more enthusiastic about the IOBB than Canadians. By 1894 the Toronto Lodge had surrendered its charter, and in 1903 Montreal gave up as well.203 A dramatic upsurge in the Canadian fortunes of the IOBB came about in the second decade of the twentieth century. By that time the order had lost much of its "German" aura and was considered very "American." In the 200.

In Canada, there was renewed interest. Partly under the influence of American immigrants, such as Rabbi Nathan Gordon, new Canadian IOBB lodges were established in Winnipeg (1909), Vancouver (1910), Ed- monton, Regina, Fort William, Ontario, Montreal (1913), and Victoria (1914). As if to emphasize the orientation of the order, the new Regina Lodge was named after the prominent American Jew, Louis D. Brandeis.204 Other orders which came to Canada from the United States, were The Sons of Benjamin and The Independent Order B'nai Jacob.205 Rather more important, was the Arbeiter Ring or Workmen's Circle, a combination fraternal order, labor union, and mutual benefit society. Eleven years after its founding in New York in 1895, the Circle reached Montreal, where it enlisted large numbers of members, including some organized in the Karl Marx Branch.206 Another less important American order-sick benefit society was the Pride of Israel, which established a Toronto branch early in the twentieth century.207 The other American Jewish organization to attract significant numbers of Canadian members during the period was the National Council of Jewish Women, which dated from 1893 (hereafter referred to as NCJW). Although Rabbi Meldola De Sola eventually became an outspoken critic of the NCJW, because of the Reform leanings of several of its organizers, it was his wife who brought the group to Canada in 1896. At her invitation, the then presi- dent, Miss Sadie American, came to Montreal to proselytize the local ladies. The first Montreal chapter president was Mrs. De Sola herself, who traveled to Toronto in 1896 to spread the gospel. Soon there was a Canadian division of the NCJW with Mrs. De Sola as vice-president.

In the first decade of the twentieth century a Jewish Literary Society was organized in Montreal in close cooperation with parent groups in New York.209 In 1907 the Jewish Chautauqua Society had chapters in Toronto and Hamilton as well as in sixty-one American cities.210 Chautauqua sought to spread Jewish culture, much as the general Chautauqua Society attempted to spread Christian and general culture. In 1913 the Jewish college fraternity, Zeta Beta Tau, formed its first Canadian chapter at McGill. A year later a Canadian, Nathaniel S. Fineberg of McGill, was elected Supreme Sofer at the fraternity's New York convention. Among the sponsors of the fraternity in Montreal was Rabbi Herman Abramowitz, who had belonged to it while a student in New York.211 The multiplicity of Jewish organizations in the United States on the eve of World War I seems staggering in comparison with the earlier period, but, of course, the same was true of gentile community life. Organizations, old and new, enjoyed an "astonishing growth" between 1880 and 1914. These organizations, Jewish and gentile, spread into Canada often through the agency of American immigrants. There they "had a marked assimilating ef- fect."2'2 Because of the institutional connections of Canadians and Americans, some observers felt that Canada's whole "way of living ... [was coming] completely under the influence of New York."2t' Despite its strong bonds with England, the Canadian Jewish community now seemed "nearer the United States than England, not only topographically, but also typographically."2'4 In fact, by 1914 "the Jews of Canada ... [were well] ahead of their neighbours in maintaining an entente cordiale with the United States."215 209. Bernard Figler and David Rome, The H. M. Caiserman Book (Montreal, 1962), p. 82. 210.

Although that leadership did not come into its own until after World War I, there was manifested already in Mordecai Noah's Ararat plan to settle Jews on Grand Island in the Niagara River between Buffalo and Toronto in the 1820s and in the 1858 Mortara affair a glimmer of things to come. As they would in many serious crises yet in the future, in 1858 Canadian Jews joined their protests to those of their American coreligionists.2'6 Ties of sentiment and birth and personal and communal bonds, then, con- nected Canadian Jews with America all during the nineteenth century, no less, and sometimes more, than they connected them with England. As the century progressed the number of people involved grew vastly larger, the variety of American Jewish life imported became incomparably greater, and the demography of the North American Jewish community altered. In the first half of the nineteenth century, American Jews were largely of German origin, while many Canadians were of English origin. Later, most on both sides of the border had originated in eastern Europe. But whether of English or east-European origin, Canadian Jews were quite ready to adopt American habits and sentiments. Given the number of Canadians with American antecedents, the attachment of Jews everywhere in the world to the United States in the period, and the attractions of the vital, large and variegated American Jewish community, it is not surprising that Canadian Jews prior to 1914 evinced genuine enthusiasm for "the great American republic." Like other Anglo-Canadians at the turn of the century, perhaps even more so, Jews maintained a high level of interest in American affairs. Events in the United States touched them almost as much as they did Americans. In 1901 when President William McKinley was shot, Meldola De Sola, like other Montreal clergymen, offered special prayers and, after the president's death, spoke warmly of his "noble ... character."2T7 The Keneder odler kept its readers informed on all contemporary American issues, from trust- 216.

Lincoln's birthday annually inspired an enthusiastic article in the Keneder odler,2'9 and it was a matter of course for the paper "to honor the pilgrim fathers" on Thanksgiving Day.220 In 1892 Montreal's Temple Emanu-El held a service in honor of the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America. The service concluded with "an invocation for the citizens of the United States, . . . who had so nobly treated all the persecuted."22' As time went on, American-Jewish affairs involved Canadians more and more. The two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the settlement of Jews in the United States was celebrated in 1905 by Canadian Jews as if it were their own.222 On the twenty-fifth anniversary of the death of Isaac Leeser, Meldola De Sola mourned the "National loss" from the pulpit of his Montreal synagogue.223 Canadian Jews read about and were interested in the Jewish agricultural school at Woodbine, New Jersey, the Jewish theater in New York, and the New York Yiddish press, which many disdained as a "literary whore."224 In general, the Canadian-American relationship was so close in the period under review that it remained, for the most part, impervious to the vicissitudes of international affairs. There were, of course, the dislocations of the American Revolution and the War of 1812, which affected Jews as they did other North Americans.225 But except for these two brief periods, the human and cultural interchanges that generally characterized Canadian- American relations continued despite political differences, with an expected upsurge when tensions abated.

American Jewish journals arrived in Canada; Rabbi De Sola continued his peregrinations; emigration from Canada to the United States continued apace.226 In later, less tense years, at Montreal Jewish functions, such as the cornerstone laying of the new Baron de Hirsch Institute building in 1901, the United States consul was a regular guest.227 To a great degree, then, Canadian Jews of the period under review felt that they were "Americans" and acted as if they were. VII The sentiments of Canadian Jews in the Victorian Era and the mul- tiplicity of relationships they built up with the United States, which con- cretized their admiration for American freedom and opportunity coincided with the general Jewish attitude toward America. They might well, however, have conflicted with the loyalties which all Canadians, and especially Anglo- Canadians, were expected to have towards Great Britain, Canada's mother country. In general, the links of Anglo-Canadians with the mother country remained strong during the period under review. There were spurts of anti- Americanism too. For the most part, however, the British and the American affiliations of Canadian Jews dovetailed. Even after the American Revolution, Britain continued to transmit to the United States and, of course, to Canada, as well, ideas and culture. She also continued to export goods, capital and men to a receptive North America and to import a great deal from there. From this traffic arose shared "tastes and ... social and political principles ... "228 Moreover, Englishmen, and certainly English Jews, also greatly admired the freedom and opportunity that seemed synonymous with America. Over the years there was created a "North Atlantic Triangle," an Anglo-Saxon civilization 226. Brebner, pp. 269-73; Penlington, p. 3; Scheuer, pp. 357-58; letters in ADSP; and C.

By 1850 there were approximately 3,000 English Jews in the United States, and a few hundred more in Canada.229 Many of these at one time or another lived in all three countries. From the conquest of Canada, one of the main routes of settlers from England was via New York. The first Jews to settle in what would later be Canadian territory were English Jews, who settled in Nova Scotia in the 1750s, after stopovers of varying durations in New York and Newport.230 Aaron Hart had spent some time in New York, before settling in Trois Rivieres in 1759.231 After the American Revolution, too, English Jews, and eastern and central European Jews who had passed through England, continued to make their way to Canada via American ports. They frequently scattered relatives in all three countries.232 Traffic between the United States and England, as well as three-way traf- fic with Canada, increased in the latter years of the period under review. Thousands of Jews annually described the triangle. Between 1904 and 1912 from 3,300 to 14,000 Jews a year emigrated directly from England to the United States and still more emigrated to the United States from England by way of Canada. Others went from England to Canada by way of American ports, cementing bonds among the three countries.233 In addition to those who actually lived in all or two of the three countries, there were others who traveled among them, sojourning for various periods of time. These too helped to create the ambience of the English-speaking, North Atlantic world. Canadian doctors, in the early days of the country, frequently studied in both the United States and England, before returning home to practice. Aaron Hart David, dis- tinguished Montreal physician, received his medical degree at Edinburgh in 1835 and studied in the United States as well. Dr. David kept up profes- sional ties in both countries, retaining his personal friendships, even while 229.

Sir J. William Dawson, long-time president of McGill and the man who provided the moving spirit for that university's growth from a country school to a major university, spoke and published in England and the United States and was a member of scholarly societies in both countries. In 1875 he delivered the Phi Beta Kappa Oration at the Harvard commencement, and some years later refused the presidency of a large American university.235 His Jewish counter- part was his contemporary and McGill colleague, Abraham De Sola. That De Sola was born in London, lived most of his adult life in Montreal, and died on a visit to New York is symbolic of the role he played in the "North Atlantic Triangle." Even war proved to be a uniting factor. At least two Canadian Jews felt sufficiently enthusiastic about both the United States and England to go to war for both countries. Joseph Franklin, a Montrealer born in eastern Europe, and Dr. Hyman Lightstone, also of Montreal, both fought as volunteers in the Spanish-American War and the Boer War. Franklin died of fever at Bl6mfontein.236 The interconnection of the three countries was perceptible at the organizational level as well as at the personal level. Immigrant-aid work was frequently coordinated among London, New York and Montreal.237 The B'nai B'rith lodges in all three countries looked to Grand Lodge No. 1 in New York as headquarters.238 Jewish labor unions in England and Canada relied upon the more developed American unions for leadership.239 In some areas both North American countries learned from England. In others England learned from North America. There was give and take of all sorts in both directions across the Atlantic.240 234.

Although the Anglicans and Roman Catholics do not fit the pattern for obvious reasons, most Protestant denominations and Judaism in Canada are blends from all three countries. The first two presbyteries to be established on Canadian soil were founded by emigrants from Scotland. By 1833, however, the Niagara Presbytery in Upper Canada was composed entirely of former American ministers. Canadian Baptists have almost always numbered in their ranks emigrants from both New and old England. The Methodists in Upper Canada were for a long time subordinate to the American Methodist Episcopal Church, a connection which caused them to be suspected of dis- loyalty to Britain. During the same period, the Methodists of Lower Canada were subordinate to the British Wesleyan Church. Finally in 1855 the two groups came together in an independent Canadian church.24' Canadian Judaism likewise had roots in both England and the United States. For Judaism as for the Protestant denominations, Canada was a way station between the two countries. It was symbolic of the nature of Cana- dian Judaism that the bylaws of the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue in Montreal in 1857 specified, that the "fixed prayers shall forever be read in the Hebrew according to the customs of the Great Portuguese Synagogue in London," and that the "hours for commencing the morning service ... be the same as in the Portuguese Synagogue in New York."242 A cursory glance at lists of prominent Jews gives some indication of the importance in the Canadian Jewish community of the triangular relationship. In S. J. Birnbaum's 1912-13 articles in the Canadian Jewish Times on "The History of the Jews in Toronto," every Jew mentioned had either a British or an American connection or both.243 Of the eighteen iden- tifiable Jews mentioned in Ross Hamilton's Prominent Men of Canada (Montreal, 1932), nine came from either the United States or Britain. A more representative sampling is offered by Arthur Daniel Hart in The Jew in Canada (Toronto and Montreal, 1926). Hart compiled profiles of 302 Jews prominent in Canada in 1926 or earlier. Of these 148 had lived either in Britain or the United States. Still more had close relatives-children or 241.

The breakdown by groups of- fers an even more telling picture. Of the clergy, 15 of 21 had American or British experience; of the journalists, one of three; of the doctors, 15 of 29; of the businessmen, 75 of 133; of the women, 11 of 19. Clearly, then, English or American experience was a great help in rising to a position of influence in the Canadian Jewish community. It was also likely to strengthen the American and British ties of that community. The degree to which English and American Jews rose to the top of Cana- dian Jewish society paralleled the success of gentiles in the general society. English companies tended to bring over British personnel for top positions and American companies Americans. In 1931 the number of American-born in responsible positions in Canada was forty-three percent higher than the percentage of American-born in the general population.244 Similarly, the North Atlantic relationship helped Canadian emigrants and Britishers in the United States. Although no systematic studies exist, in- dications are that Canadians in the United States over the years achieved a high degree of success.245 So too did British immigrants, to whom the United States did not seem a "foreign" country so much as "this 'Greater Britain' in which we have made our home."246 These immigrants, of course, did not have to overcome the usual language handicap. Reinforcing the trans-Atlantic movement of people, ideas, and institu- tions was the political rapprochement between England and the United States, which took place at the turn of the century. After the mid-1890s, when Britain awoke to the German peril, she became increasingly eager to better her relations with the United States. Outstanding issues were resolved, sometimes at Canada's expense, or so, at least, many Canadians felt. Americans, at the turn of the century, were eager for better relations with Britain. The WASPS, then in the driver's seat in the United States, but feeling a loss of power to the newcomers, began to play up Anglo-Saxon unity. Their racism derived partly from Darwin and de Gobineau and partly from fear that the new, post-1880 immigration from southern and eastern Europe, including the Jews, would be hard to assimilate and a potential threat to Anglo-Saxon hegemony. In Canada the growing friction between 244. Lloyd G. Reynolds, The British Immigrant: His Social and Economic Adjustment in Canada (Toronto, 1935), p. 121; Coats and Maclean, pp. 160-61. 245.

The alternative to Americanization for Anglo-Canadians was imperial sentiment. But pro- English feeling was simply not a clear alternative. There were too many shared interests and values between the United States and England for imperial sentiment to cancel out North American sentiment. In the end both were strengthened. The North Atlantic Triangle, then, was vigorously alive during the period under review. It combined American and British elements and some Canadian. It was a relationship that made it possible for Canadians to live with creeping Americanization and yet to retain and even fortify their British connection. The rising tide of Anglo-Saxon racial spirit in Canada helped. Anglo-Canadians, for example, after a spurt of initial sympathy for Spain in the Spanish-American conflict, came around to almost unanimous support for the cause of the United States.247 There was a growing feeling that Canadians, Americans and Britishers were "Anglo-Saxons, All."248 The North Atlantic relationship was far more important in Anglo- Canada, with its yet weak sense of nationhood, than it was in either Great Britain or the United States. Canadian churches were able to retain their ties to fellow communicants in both countries.249 Canadian universities manifested "the Anglo-Saxon influence ... in two forms-English and American."250 And Canadian Jewry became at once both very British and very American. Over the years there developed in Canada a rationalization of the North Atlantic relationship, which included a new sense of Canadian mission. As intellectual leader, George M. Grant, and others saw it, Canada's "divine mission" was now to be the creation of a British North America, which would become a "living link" between England and the United States. Canada would heal the breach of 1776, mediating between the two great Anglo-Saxon peoples.25' Canadian Jews in the Victorian Era, then, shared with gentile Anglo- 247. Penlington, p. 106. 248.

Their bonds to England and America were in part unique to them. The admiration and affection they felt for both countries stemmed from the exceptionally tolerant manner in which both treated Jews. Those feelings were reinforced by the willingness of both countries to defend Jews in the international arena. Jewish affection was reciprocated by many Americans and Englishmen, who felt an affinity for Jews and for their heritage. But the bonds of Jews to England and America in this period were not only those of sentiment. Jews moved about from England to Canada to the United States. The extensive intercourse and the multiplicity of relationships they maintained among their communities in all three countries mirrored those of gentile Anglo-Saxons. To Canadian Jews the concept of a North Atlantic, Anglo-Saxon relationship was particularly congenial, since it allowed them to reconcile two ideals: England and America. Canadian Jews boasted of their dual loyalty, their admiration for the "Stars and Stripes" and their "wholehearted ... British citizenship."252 It made sense in the Canadian context for Meldola De Sola to sign letters to newspapers, at times, "An American Jew," at other times, "Briton," and on still other occasions, "Canadian."253 Dependent upon and intimately connected with both England and the United States, Canadian Jews found the North Atlantic relationship to be a means of their own Canadianization, or, more specifically, their Anglo-Canadianization. 252.
