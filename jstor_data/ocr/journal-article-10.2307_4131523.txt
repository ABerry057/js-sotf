I ask her. "Sometimes I have the feeling that you really hate me." "I need a mother, especially a Jewish mother, and this part suits you quite well ... But since we are talking about it, why did you become my friend?" "Because you add some freshness to my life, you fill it with your stormy moods, I am holding on to your youth and, as you have said, apparently moth- erhood is my destiny." "So I am your baby." "In a way." -The narrator-writer and her protagonist in Ha-cagam ha-penimi (The Inner Lake)' In her path-breaking study of Israeli women's fiction, Yael Feldman con- cludes her analysis of Ruth Almog's Roots ofAir (1987) with an insightful obser- vation. In this major work, Feldman claims, Almog trespassed into the male writers' territory and became the first among Israeli woman writers to produce an autobiographical fiction of the "portrait of an artist as a young girl."2 Feldman con- cludes that, once the stage of "therapeutic" self-examination, which encompasses "both the oedipal fixation and the daughter-mother identification," has been com- pleted, "Almog has now embraced the mother in herself."3 Indeed, Feldman iden- tifies the next stage in Almog's artistic evolution in her collection of stories, *This article is part of a book on Ruth Almog's fiction, which will appear in the series Migdarim [Genders] of Ha-Kibuz ha-me'uhad, edited by Prof. Hannah Naveh. I would like to thank the Interna- tional Research Institute on Jewish Women/Brandeis University for its support of this study. 1.

In Artistic Mending the writer turns her "moth- erly" attention to life stories of children, mainly second-generation Holocaust sur- vivors, seeking ways to understand, but also "mend" the damaging effects of the tragic historical legacy. Yet, Almog who, since the beginning of her artistic career in 1969 with the collection of stories The Nightly Charities ofMargarita has proved one of the most complex and innovative Israeli writers, seems to shift from the orientation ofArtis- tic Mending in her recent, and, so far, latest, work, The Inner Lake (2000). This work of fiction, arguably one of the most challenging in Israeli literature, aban- dons the causal, teleological story line that characterizes both Roots ofAir and the stories in Artistic Mending. Almog did not make the interpretive task of The Inner Lake easy. In an interview, she claimed to have discarded the plot: "The plot does not interest me. By its very nature the realistic genre, which is saturated with plot, distracts and entertains and its shallowness diminishes the richness of the human being." She admits to having constructed a text that defies the normative defini- tion of the novel: "I call my new book a 'hibur' ('connection'),4 because 'hu hibur shel' ('it is a connection of') poetry and prose, fiction and reality, myths and mythological characters, lots of nature, especially swans and peacocks."5 Does The Inner Lake reflect the author's conceptualization of the text as hibur? Or, to recall D. H. Lawrence' famous dictum "Never trust the artist, trust the tale," should we treat the author's description of her work as a random collec- tion of various materials with a measure of skepticism? At first sight, the con- struction of the book reaffirms the absence of the plot and reinforces the notion of an encyclopedic collection. The structure of The Inner Lake is symmetrical; it con- sists of two main sections entitled "The Notebook of the Swan" and "The Note- book of the Peacock," each of which contains seventy-one numbered segments. The segments, which deal with swans and peacocks, are presented as separate, complete episodes. There is no "nature," that is, no descriptions of the birds in their natural habitat, but, rather, scientific information on the birds, the history of or- nithology, and the portrayals of swans and peacocks in literature, especially in myth. The narrator has indefatigably collected stories of swans and peacocks in Greek and Roman mythologies, in Irish, Scandinavian, and European legends, and in the studies of medieval Christian and Moslem ornithologists, as well as in the theology of the little-known Yazidi community in Iraq. The book concludes with an Addendum, which contains clarification of the external materials incorporated into the book and additional documentation about swans and peacocks. The Addendum also explains some of the myths used in the text, and includes Almog's brief acknowledgment of the people "who helped me 4. Hibur also means "addition," "linkage," "connection," as well as an essay, and a piece of cre- ative writing. The most common usage of mehaber, which we shall encounter in a moment, are, ac- cording to Milon Even Shoshan, "author," or "composer." 5.

Translation from the Hebrew mine. 250</page><page sequence="3">Ruth Almog's The Inner Lake to compose (be-hibur) this book"6 (IL 140-2, my emphasis). The Addendum, which begins with the information that the poems included in the book were either translated or written by ha-mehaberet (the author), makes an explicit autobio- graphical connection between "me," the author who wrote the Addendum, and the the writer of the book, who appears as first-person narrator. The blending of the boundaries between the fictional text and the external text is reinforced by the cross acknowledgement of Professor Liebes's contribution of information about the Yazidi cult, in the Addendum and in the text. The first-person narrator's mention of the professor as "an important scholar of religion" also refers the reader to the Addendum to seek more information about Liebes's contribution (IL 107). This identification of the author outside the fictional text with the narrator, who is also, as we shall see in moment, the writer of this fiction is only one of the examples7 that highlight the autobiographical component in the text. We recall Feldman's observation that with Roots of Air, Almog has com- pleted the self-portrait of her emotional growth as daughter and moved on to "motherly" writing, which expresses concern with the other. Are we then to de- duce that in The Inner Lake Almog returns to the genre of autobiographical fic- tion, or, rather, that the autobiographical components, which blur the factual and the fictional, are part of the literary experiment of the hibur? I argue that the use of the autobiographical "I" to remove the boundaries between imagination and re- ality, between narrator and author, signals a particular conception of this autobio- graphical fiction. As I propose to show, this autobiographical fiction investigates the construct of the author in the post-Holocaust era. The Inner Lake reverses the accepted notion of autobiography as the life sto- ry of its author. Rather, it examines the relationship between the artist and her art. More specifically, the text explores the process of becoming a mature artist, or, metaphorically speaking, a process gives birth to the mother in the artist. Rather than writing about how she writes, or how she has shaped her vision, Almog shows how her art, or, more specifically, the powers of her artistic imagination have shaped her as a mature artist. This particular approach to autobiographical self- analysis reflects an understanding that artistic maturity signifies the readiness of the artist to submit to the creative process. In today's world, compliance with the call of creativity is by no means easy. In view of the recent history of horror, it sig- nifies a fearful confrontation with suffering and evil. Paradoxically, a degree of authorial empowerment derives from the recog- 6. The construct be-hibur followed by the object sefer zeh (this book) takes the meaning of the process of composition that produced the book. 7. Such as, for instance, the epigraph from a poem by Elizabeth Bishop, to which the narrator refers several times in the text (we shall discuss the thematic importance of this "combination" later on). Another example of the autobiographical aspect of the text is the omission to name the first-per- son narrator. Her namelessness leads to an understanding that she is the same person who wrote the Addendum. The author of the Addendum, which is not signed, identifies herself as mehaberet ("the au- thor"), whose name, Ruth Almog appears on the cover. Perhaps the most telling evidence of the auto- biographical component is the fact that the narrator, the fictional writer of The Inner Lake calls her book a hibur (IL 16). 251</page><page sequence="4">Rachel Feldhay Brenner nition of the limitations of the artist in the age that experienced the horror of the Holocaust. It is the recognition that her aesthetic desire for an unperturbed, remote world of eternal beauty and tranquility, which transcends time, must coexist with the ethical issues of the world of here and now, a world that has experienced the collapse of all moral values. The concern about the world signals the birth of the mother in the artist. The maturity of the artist emerges in the recognition of the om- nipresence of evil, and at the same time in the desire to fend off its expansion. The aspiration to create beauty not only as an expression of the aesthetic, but also as an affirmation of ethical values, marks artistic maturity in the age of terror. The Inner Lake presents the artistic process as an ongoing collision of forces, which constantly pulls the artist in opposite directions. The ideal of eternal, per- fect beauty collides with the imperfections of this world. "My life story," the nar- rator tells us, "oscillates between the swan and the peacock" (IL 18). On the one hand, the temptation of withdrawal into the cold spheres of purity and innocence, as represented by the swan and its death song, is irresistible; on the other hand, the attraction and the sinfulness of the world, as represented by the peacock in the ar- rogant display of its colorful tail, claim involvement. While the former lures her to the spheres of the nonhuman beauty of tranquility and repose, the latter demands her engagement with the human world, whose beauty has been marred by a histo- ry of violence and terror. The white swan, "sails gracefully in silence"; it is pure and vulnerable, and it is only when its sinuous, slim, delicate neck is broken that "it utters ... a mag- nificent and rare song." In contrast, the peacock cannot sing. Its voice is ugly and wicked. Nonetheless "the bird's spectacular plumage and his emerald eyes know about the world and bewitch it when it spreads his tail and displays it in its rahav [hubris] and in its desire" (IL 16). As the narrator sees it, each bird is a work of art, and also a creative artist. The dazzling white beauty of the gracefully sailing swan and the stunning colorful display of the peacock's tail evoke equally magnificent visualizations of the birds. At the same time, the swan's death song and the pea- cock's act of seduction identify the birds as accomplished artists. The swan trans- forms its agony into a lamentation, and the innocent beauty of its song transcends death. The peacock is a deceiver and a performing artist; the boastful show of its tail seduces the world and celebrates life. The swan and the peacock are presented as emblems; the former is an emblem of an art of impassionate purity, while the latter is an emblem of an art passionately engaged in life. As we shall see in the following discussion, even though the narrator would prefer to be a "swan artist," that is, the poet of the eternal swan song, the aspect of the "peacock artist" of se- ductive earthy beauty and life experience cannot be left out; in fact, it is an inte- gral and vital motive in the formation of the mature artist. The magnetic attraction to tranquil beauty is signaled in the choice of the epigraph to the book. These are the opening lines from Elizabeth Bishop's "The Imaginary Iceberg:" We'd rather have the iceberg than the ship, Although it meant the end of travel. Although it stood stock-still like cloudy rock 252</page><page sequence="5">Ruth Almog's The Inner Lake And all the sea were moving marble. We'd rather have the iceberg than the ship.8 Bishop does not remain outside the text; she is the narrator's "most beloved poet" (IL 25), and halfway through the Notebook of the Swan, we find a direct reference to the imaginary iceberg. Here the narrator agrees with Bishop's final affirmation that "Icebergs behoove the soul" (IL 43). Let us note the following lines that pro- vide an explication: "(both being self-made from elements least visible)/to see them so: fleshed, fair, erected indivisible." The association of the iceberg and the soul elucidates the common aspects of abstraction and detachment, of invisibility and indivisibility that connect the iceberg and the soul. Yet, in the final segment of the Notebook of the Peacock, which concludes the book, the narrator changes her mind: What is seeking the soul that wanders from port to port? Even at night will the peacock shake its tail and scream . .. and like a flame will its colors daze ... And the iceberg-cuts its facets from within-dangerous, powerful and trans- parent. But sometimes we 'd rather have the ship and therefore good-bye, we say, good-bye, farewell (IL 139 my emphasis). The preference for the iceberg is no longer absolute. As the ship sails from port to port, and the peacock dazzles with its colors and screams in its ugly voice, there emerges the consciousness of an engagement with the world. What determines the ship as an option? The answer is suggested in the description of the iceberg, which, like a diamond, "cuts its facets from within." This quality of self-making and self- containment is reinforced by the lines that follow in the original version: "Like jewelry from a grave/it saves itself perpetually and adorns/only itself." We recall that, as the title of Bishop's poem tells us, the iceberg is imaginary. The artist has, therefore, fallen under the spell of an imagined object, which not only is powerful and menacing, but also completely self-absorbed, as it creates and recreates itself, for its own sake, in perpetual narcissistic self-admiration. The image of the grave alludes to the lifeless quality of this self-adornment. The iceberg's beauty is en- closed within itself, and it can mirror only itself.9 By admitting that the ship "some- times" may be preferred over the iceberg, the narrator reneges on the desire for the self-sufficient, self-contained soul, removed from the troubles of the world. This is not the first time that the importance of the ship is recognized. The choice of the ship over the iceberg has been made much earlier and in a much more decisive way by another voice. It is the voice of a character that the narrator intro- duces along with herself in the beginning of the book: "I am a bird-watcher by pro- fession and so is Metuka, my protagonist of many names" (IL 9, my emphasis). 8.

Now I focus on Glycera, who repre- sents the most prominent aspect in this composite construct of the protagonist. The narrator's claim to her protagonist is short-lived. Though conceived in the narrator's imagination, the protagonist quickly asserts her independence, when she decisively rejects Bishop's poem. The protagonist, who has just made an inde- pendent decision to change her name from Metuka to Glycera, declares that she is not at the "the end ofjourney, but at its beginning," and she states, "I came here to watch the ship, not the iceberg" (IL 25). Glycera's rejection of the iceberg fore- shadows her willfulness. Against the narrator's desire for the iceberg, Glycera pulls in the opposite direction, toward passionate and tragic involvement with life. The opposition is already signaled in the visual aspect, which contrasts the solitary, transparent, and immobile iceberg with Glycera, a wanderer, whose skin is the col- or of honey, whose hair is flaming red, and who always dresses in red. She is an airhostess who travels the world, and an experienced woman who has had many lovers. Glycera's constant wanderings associate therefore with an unending sea voyage, and her fiery hair, extravagant appearance, and unpredictable behavior re- call the earthy peacock, which bewitches the world with its daring colors, audaci- ty, sensuality, and life experience. While the epigraph from Bishop shows the remote, pristine, self-contained solitude of the iceberg and its refraction in the image of the swan, the excerpt I have chosen as the epigraph to this essay reveals Glycera's "peacock" characteris- tics, which point to intense involvement with the "ship" of life. Glycera bewitch- es the narrator with her unpredictability, her vitality, and her neediness, seducing her into "adopting" Glycera as her "baby." Glycera's perception of the narrator as her mother cannot be over estimated. I have already argued that The Inner Lake is an exploration of the mother in the artist, that is, of an artist mature enough to rec- ognize and to submit to the forces of her imagination. The fact that it is the pro- tagonist that ventures the definition of her ties with the narrator as mother- daughter relationship attests to the protagonist's autonomy in the text, and, at the same time, to her need to affiliate with the narrator. And the fact that the narrator endorses her protagonist's perception as her mother communicates not only the narrator's recognition of her affiliation with her protagonist, but also the extent of power that the imaginary protagonist wields over her creator. The mother-daugh- ter relationship indicates a turbulent kinship of the artist and her creation. This power of the protagonist is further accentuated by her claim of the nar- rator as her Jewish mother. Since Glycera's "biography" will show in a moment that the protagonist never had a Jewish mother, this deliberate choice of a Jewish parent demonstrates the wish to replot the story of her life. I do not use the term "plot" inadvertently; as we recall, Almog rejects the plot, which, as she sees it, di- minishes the richness of the human being. Nonetheless, I argue that, though often enigmatic, sinuous, and certainly nonconformist, Glycera's tragic life story weaves its way among the myths and stories about swans and peacocks. Glycera's story, a bizarre configuration of mystery, romantic love, and pi- caresque travelogue, tells the story of a child of the Holocaust generation. It is a life story shaped and consumed by an obsession with the tormented Jewish-Ger- 254</page><page sequence="7">Ruth Almog's The Inner Lake man symbiosis that the tragedy of the parents bequeathed to the children. Glycera is the daughter of Albert Cohen, a Greek survivor of the Holocaust who lost all his family, and of Hiltrud, a German woman, whose father, a Nazi, conducted medical experiments on Jews. Hiltrud, who wishes for tikkun (mending), persuades Cohen to marry her and move to Israel. Cohen calls their daughter Glycera after a Greek girl he loved as a boy. Upon his return from the concentration camp, he found out that the girl had been killed during the war in an air raid. Cohen is a sailor, and he takes Glycera on his ship to his Greek island, where he shows her that he is bereft of the family childhood home and tells her about the dead Glycera. Hiltrud dies, and Glycera goes to her maternal grandmother, who has never forgiven Hiltrud and who hates Glycera. Glycera does not know that her Nazi grandfather lives in hid- ing. Meanwhile, she meets Joachim. Joachim is the son of a Jewish woman who is a survivor of the Holocaust and who married a former Nazi guard in Matthausen, the camp where Glycera's father was imprisoned. Joachim's mother dies, be- queathing to Joachim her last wish, which commands him to avenge Nazi crimes. To fulfill his mother's wish, Joachim organizes a gang to hunt Nazis and gets im- plicated in terrorist activities. He knows who Glycera is and suspects that she knows her grandfather's whereabouts, but when they meet, they fall in love. Joachim wishes to abandon his mission of a Nazi avenger, because he loves Glyc- era and wants to build his life with her, but he is trapped in his terrorist environ- ment. Joachim is constantly away on his clandestine missions, and Glycera, who thinks that she saw him on a tall ship, constantly follows him from port to port, though she does not trust him; as it turns out in their final and tragic encounter, Glycera did not even disclose her name to him. Glycera refuses to live in Israel be- cause she cannot accept its bloodshed, war, and violence. Every time she lands in Israel, she is subject to a terrorist attack. Yet, Germany is hostile and full of anti- Semitic hatred. When Glycera discovers that her grandfather is alive, she decides to complete the tikkun that her mother wished for by exposing the Nazi, the em- bodiment of evil, to the world. She forces the narrator, who is petrified with fear and who vehemently opposes Glycera's plan, to come with her and witness the event in order to tell it to the world. The moment the terrified narrator and the fran- tic Glycera finally confront the grandfather, Joachim and his gang burst on the scene and gun down both the old Nazi and Glycera, while the narrator, speechless with terror, watches the carnage. Even though short and certainly incomplete, this "biographic" synopsis re- veals the contrasting aspects of hatred and love, mistrust and loyalty, murder and rebirth, revenge and the overriding intention of tikkun. Interestingly, similar char- acteristics arise in the myths that the motherly narrator constantly tells Glycera in a futile attempt to distract her daughter from excessive preoccupation with evil. At a certain point, after hearing the myth about lo, the heifer; Zeus, her treacherous lover; Hera, the jealous and vengeful wife; Argos, the guardian of a thousand eyes; Hermes, the slayer of Argos; and the peacock who inherited Argos's eyes, Glycera observes to the narrator, "Love, jealousy, revenge, murder, tikkun. That's the whole story ... ." The narrator agrees that there is "awful thinness" in the myths, and ex- plains, "That is why variations were created, to create some diversity, which will rescue us from this boredom ...." (IL 83). 255</page><page sequence="8">Rachel Feldhay Brenner This short exchange implies a distinction, which illuminates the irreconcil- able discrepancy between the myth and the post-Holocaust story. It is the compo- nent of tikkun that Glycera notes in the mythical pattern that highlights the failure of tikkun in the world after the Holocaust. Glycera's story is, in essence, the story about the failure to redeem the world that experienced the catastrophe. As already noted, her story ends in violent death. Joachim fulfils his mother's injunction of tikkun and kills the Nazi, but, at the same time, he kills Glycera, who has been striv- ing to complete her mother's tikkun. As the guilty and the innocent die together, the attempt at tikkun turns into a parody, or, rather, into a travesty, of redemption. Rather than mending the post-Holocaust world, the pursuit of justice contributes to the perpetuation of evil. The failure of tikkun in the story of the post-Holocaust generation directs us to the myth and its fulfilled promise of tikkun. Where should we look for redemp- tion in a mythical story, which, almost by definition, represents a world moved by betrayal, revenge, rape, unbridled passions, and capricious killings? As the narra- tor suggests, the redeeming aspect of the mythical story emerges in its "variations" and "diversity." A myth can be told in many ways; it may convey many messages, and, while the basic plot is "thin," that is, repetitive, its variability offers a wealth of perspectives. Rescuing us from monotony, the variations also save the story from the finality of a single tragic ending. The certainty of yet another version of the myth, which promises a different ending, defuses the sense of the tragic. At the same time, it infuses the hopefulness of the never-exhausted possibility of an al- ternative. In the realm of the myth, nothing is irreversible, while every transgres- sion is redeemable. Roberto Calasso corroborates this perception when he defines myths as "sto- ries with variants." Calasso makes the distinction between the novel and the myth. He claims that, unlike the characters in the novels "who never go beyond a single gesture ... mythical figures live many lives, die many deaths .... But in these lives and deaths all the others are present, and we can hear their echo."' In con- trast with the determinism of the teleological plot, the variants of the myth validate the hypothetical speculation: "What if?" It is a question that legitimizes optional story lines. Thus, unlike the plot, which evolves toward the finality of the telos, the myth always remains open to new possibilities. "Myths," Calasso tells us, "are made up of actions that include their opposites within themselves. The hero kills the monster, but even as he does so we perceive that the opposite is also true: The monster kills the hero. The hero carries off the princess, yet . .. we perceive that the opposite is also true: The hero deserts the princess. How can we be sure? The variants tell us.""11 The characters can thus transform from virtuous figures into villains, from pursued into pursuers, from victims into victimizers, and vice ver- sa. Ironically, the constant in the myth is the variability of its metamorphoses. The Notebook of the Peacock in Almog's hibur illustrates the metamor- phoses of the peacock in myth, legend, history, and theology of various cultures 10.

The beauty of the peacock's colors delineates, metaphorically, the spectrum defined by the poles of virtue and sanctity and of sinfulness and evil. In Roman mythology, the peacock was sanctified to Hera/Juno, and the artists in the Roman Empire used the peacock as a decorative motif (IL 114). In early Chris- tianity, the peacock was considered a sacred bird whose flesh never putrefies (IL 11). That is why it became the symbol of immortality. Furthermore, in early Chris- tianity the regrowth of its feathers every spring made the peacock the symbol of the resurrection of the dead (IL 114).12 The peacock is mentioned in the Jewish tradition, especially in the midrash. The bird was considered pure for sacrifice. At the same time, a legend tells that the peacock was one of the sinful creatures in the Flood generation. In other tra- ditions, the peacock assumes even more sinister dimensions. In the Moslem leg- ends the peacock is identified with Satan and with the snake. He is blamed for the Original Sin and for the expulsion from Eden (IL 114). Similar characteristics are attributed to the peacock by the Yazidis, a small religious community of Kurdish descent.13 The Yazidis believe in the existence of evil that comes from God, who is distant and whose name cannot be pronounced. They also believe that Satan is all-powerful. Satan is a fallen angel whom God restored to his former glory. He represents constant danger and therefore needs to be appeased and treated with deepest respect (IL 120-1). In the Yazidi tradition, it is forbidden to pronounce Satan's name, and so the peacock has become the representation of Satan, and "is known as the seducer, Beelzebub, the Prince of Darkness, the strong, the wicked, the enemy" (IL 128). The Yazidis call Satan Melek Taus, that is, "Peacock Angel." The most revered object of the Yazidi worship is the statue of a peacock, named Ancient Peacock. The name and the image of the peacock is the symbol of their religion (IL 120-1). The Yazidi worship of the peacock communicates a peculiar message. The peacock serves a resemblance, an "approximation" of Satan, as Satan himself is too fearful and dangerous to be directly approached. As a replacement and, at the same time, displacement of Satan, Peacock Angel does not signify the disappear- ance of the demonic forces in the world. On the contrary, the worship of the pea- cock is a manifestation of the haunting consciousness of the powers of destruction, as well as it is a precaution not to provoke these powers at any cost. From this per- spective, it is possible to see in the Yazidi variation of the peacock story an implied rationale for the component of variations in the myth at large. In light of the Yazi- di theology of evil, the variants of the story, which defuse the sense of finality, demonstrate an evasive attitude toward evil. As Calasso indicates, the myths mend each other through transformations of their characters from villains to virtuous he- 12. Jung tells us that the peacock is "an old emblem of rebirth and resurrection," while "[in] alchemy the peacock is synonymous with the Phoenix." C. G. Jung, The Archetype and the Collective Unconscious (Princeton: Hollingen Series, 1990), 375. 13. According to the entry on the Yazidis in Avraham Sela, ed., Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East (New York: Continuum, 1999), the Yazidis live in northern Iraq, Syria and the trans-Cau- casian republics. Their religion comprises Sabean, Muslim, Christian, Zoroastrian, and pagan elements. The Yazidis, who do not believe in evil, sin, and the devil, are wrongly described as Devil-Worshippers (800). 257</page><page sequence="10">Rachel Feldhay Brenner roes and vice versa. The consistent indeterminacy of the myth protects from the terrifying encounter with evil. The protagonist, however, adamantly refuses to listen to the advice that her "Jewish mother" wishes to impart. Even the positive variants of the peacock myth fail to change Glycera's nihilistic perspective. When she tells Glycera about the peacock's "hidden third eye," which "allows human beings to look inward as well as envision eternity" and about "a peacock feather," which signifies eternal life (IL 106), the narrator evokes a fearful, enraged rejection of the peacock's associations with inner life and eternal life intended to defuse the fear of death. "To look in- ward," Glycera exclaims, "I know there is nothing there! It is empty! And if there is something I don't need for sure, it's a peacock feather. Eternal life! Indeed, who needs life!" (IL 107). Glycera's sense of emptiness reflects her mood of despera- tion and hopelessness, which indicates her death wish. Glycera communicates her despair through constant repetition of a text, which depicts the inherent and irredeemable evil of human nature. In her meetings with the narrator, she obsessively quotes from Saul Tchemichowski's poem, "The Ballad of the Wolf." A great Hebrew poet, Tchernichowski wrote "The Ballad of the Wolf" in 1942, at the time of the Holocaust. To highlight the history of Jewish suffering, the poet returns to the persecutions of the Jews in German towns by the Crusaders. The poem starts with the lines that Glycera compulsively14 recites: A regiment of Crusaders travels from town to town: They slaughtered in Aachen, they will slaughter in Treves. They will continue to slaughter: and the bell will ring, Together they will share the loot: the pious and the mob.15 The poem presents a tragically ironic illustration of the motto homo homini lupus est ("man is a wolf to man"). After having slaughtered the Jews, the Cru- saders left the burial of the terribly injured, dying victims to the inhabitants of the city. The Christians are busy praying and, at the same time, looting the property of the Jews. Ironically, it was the wolf that compassionately killed the victims of the slaughter, thus relieving them from horrible agony. Rabbi Jospha, one of the vic- tims, bestowed a blessing on the wolf: Its seed will not disappear until all human beings have become wolves, and presumably are as righteous as the wolf which re- deemed him from his suffering.

The narrator finds it difficult to deal with her protagonist, whose despair turned her into "an empty woman, a bundle of rattling bones," who is unable to "sense anything," and who "feels like a dead person" (IL 24). Her fear of Glycera's despair often makes her ignore Glycera's calls and letters and engages her even more deeply in the comforting stories of swans and peacocks. Yet, the "Jewish mother" cannot stay away for long from her difficult and demanding "daughter" who "enters her [night] dreams" and who invades her daydreaming (IL 129). The tormented relationship with Glycera raises the question why this insub- ordinate, depressed and depressing protagonist, a protagonist obsessed with the darkest period of Jewish history, was admitted to a story, which from the outset has declared its preference for a life of serene contemplation. Why should the narra- tor disrupt the serenity of the iceberg fantasy as well as her innocuous occupation as a bird-watcher with a turbulent and ineluctably lost battle to mend the post- Holocaust world? Our initial premise that the maturity of the artist is forged in her submission to the demands of art elucidates Glycera's disturbing presence in the narrator's text. Glycera's voice of terror antagonizes the artist; her tone of despair challenges au- thorial control by signaling the incompleteness of the world of serene icebergs and comforting myths. Glycera's appearance presents the author with a dilemma: To silence her voice would have amounted to deliberately excising an aspect of cre- ativity; to let her enter the text would expose the narrator's vulnerability in face of her unpredictable protagonist, who is consumed by pain and fear. In fact, the nar- rator admits to having tried to eliminate this frightening presence. Quite graphi- cally, she describes her violent attempts to eradicate the voice that clamors to be heard. "The truth is," she confesses, "that I killed her; I killed her many times. Every time that she spreads her wings to fly, I beat her up. I break her wings" (IL 11). Ironically, having killed her "winged-self" and drowned it in her "inner lake" (IL 12), the narrator becomes a bird-watcher, a passive observer and collector, rather than a creator. She loses access to "the golden box," which lies under the "copper mountain" in "the inner lake." In the box, "the seven little birds of her soul" (IL 9), which are also "the truth" of "all her poems," (IL 11) are buried. The loss of the creative truth turns her into a make-believe artist. As long as the "gold- en box," the soul of her creativity, remains out of her reach, she "walks barefoot," "steals anything she can put her hands on," and "pretends to be alive" (IL 11). Not only is "stealing" from others an undignified practice for a writer; but, more im- portantly, it also signifies the end of creativity. Having "killed" the call of art, all she can do is produce a hibur of entries, information, and myths. To restore cre- ativity, it is necessary to renege on resistance and to overcome the fear of the un- known. Only through courageous self-exposure to the unpredictable can the artist give birth to the story that demands to be born. Indeed, the desire to enter the fearful world of creativity proves stronger than the fear that this desire has evoked. Eventually, the narrator must face her denied yearning: 259</page><page sequence="12">Rachel Feldhay Brenner I wish to hold on to freedom. I want to do all I want, unconditionally, beyond all conventions, against all conventions, while only one, full of rahav [hubris] need guides me, the need most sinful of all, the needfor a terrible beauty to be born ... I know that this rahav might bring grave punishment upon me, but I also know that without it, nothing counts (IL 19-20 my emphasis). This proclamation of creative freedom signifies a radical shift in the narra- tor's orientation. The language and, in particular, the choice of references, com- municate the extent of the transformation. The intertext of the "terrible beauty" in Yeats's "Easter, 1916," and the intratext of the twice repeated highly literary term rahav, used previously, as we recall, to describe the peacock's arrogance, mark the change. These references signify an expanding perspective from the "beyond life" beauty of the swan to the earthy, devious, arrogant, sinfully beautiful peacock.16 The "terrible beauty" in "Easter, 1916" is born out of the violence of the Irish uprising against England, which brought about an extraordinary change in ordi- nary, even vulgar human beings. The beauty of their self-sacrifice for the Irish cause transformed the rebels into national heroes for "now and in time to be." And yet, the terror of their heroism raises doubts about the choice they made. Was their single-minded, deeply emotional resolve worth the bloodshed and violence that cost them their lives? While admiring the courage of the dead heroes, the poet 16. In order to appreciate fully the courage to respond to the story of the Holocaust, we need to recall the narrator's preference of the swan in her reference to Yeats. The narrator would rather her life story gravitated towards the story of the swan, its grace, and its death song. "For me," she declares, "the swan is the most beautiful of birds" (IL 16). "And beauty," she adds, "is beyond life" (IL 19). This wish for immortality emerges in the narrator's allusion to the "great Irish poet," whose poem "The Wild Swans at Coole" is "a lamentation on the disappearance of the swans" in the Irish legend of Caer (IL 32). (The narrator's unequivocal admiration for the swan emerges, perhaps most prominently, in her fascination with the Irish legend of Caer Ormaith, the "swan-lass," who, at certain times, ascends from the world of death only to disappear once again behind the gates of the underworld. References to this myth appear on pages 27-29, 32, 132, and 136). Indeed, Yeats' poem commemorates the eternal beauty of the swans, while deploring his old age and the inexorably approaching death: But now they drift on the still water, Mysterious, beautiful; Among what rushes will they build, By what lake's edge or pool Delight man's eyes when I awake some day To find they have flown away? (W B. Yeats, "The Wild Swans at Coole," in The Collected Works ofW B. Yeats, Vol. I [New York: Scrib- ner, 1997], 131.) The disappearance of the swans, which have flown away to an undisclosed destina- tion, signifies, in effect, the poet's departure from the world of the living. The legendary swans live forever, whereas their human admirers age and pass away. We note, however, that, the poem inspired by the swans is the poet's swan song, a work of art, which will not pass away. In his art, the poet im- mortalizes not only the transcendent beauty of the swans, "those brilliant creatures," but also, "the au- tumn beauty" of fading life. In "The Wild Swans at Coole," Yeats immortalizes what Jefferson Holdridge calls "the tragic calm with which he must learn to build his soul in preparation for death." (Jefferson Holdridge, Those Mingled Seas: The Poetry of WB. Yeats, The Beautiful and the Sublime [Dublin: University College Dublin Press, 2000], 92.) 260</page><page sequence="13">Ruth Almog's The Inner Lake struggles with pervasive doubt, "Was it needless death after all?"" "Easter, 1916" is reflexive in its skepticism about the meaning of the art it has produced. The poem is dismayed at its hubris of having created an art that declares beautiful the poetic search for humankind's beauty in the terror of violent death. Yeats's misgivings about the aesthetic of the representation of terror charac- terize what Jefferson Holdridge in his study of Yeats calls the "modern sublime." It is, as the critic claims, the impossibility of a harmonious resolution in the vio- lent reality of the modern world. Modern history, its bloody revolutions, wars, and social upheavals, fissured the Romantic Weltanschauung, which perceived the beautiful as a symbol of achievable harmonious totality, or oneness, with the world. Holdridge considers Yeats's phrase "terrible beauty" "indicative of how sublime events distort or redefine the harmonious basis of the beautiful."'8 The growing discrepancy between the aesthetic of artistic creation and the deterioration of eth- ical values reflects the disintegration of the modem world, in which, in Yeats' fa- mous words, the center cannot hold. Holridge's explication of the oxymoron, "terrible beauty," in terms of the ir- revocable breakup of values in the modern world elucidates the predicament of the narrator in The Inner Lake. The intention to represent the "terrible beauty" of the sublime in our day and age verges on rahav. The search for beauty in a world af- fected by, or, rather, infected with, the horror of the Holocaust amounts to an act of hubris. Consequently, the audacity to grant her protagonist the freedom to ex- press her emptiness, despair, and death wish forebodes the tragic fall of the artist. To forestall the collapse, the narrator evokes the other aspects of her pro- tagonist "of many names"; these are the aspects of Metuka and Dolce. The ener- gy of the former and the goodness of the latter intend to mitigate Glycera's death wish. Metuka represents the rebellious, combative, physically powerful refraction of the protagonist. She associates with the narrator's recollection of a seventh- grade fellow student, who was a Holocaust refugee. The narrator remembers that Metuka, who married at fifteen, was big and wild, her blue eyes gleaming. She was involved in fights. The narrator and her classmates, who used to mock and intim- idate other refugee girls, were afraid of Metuka and kept their distance from her (IL 22-3). Metuka, who escaped the death of a Holocaust victim in Europe, refused to become a victim in her homeland. Her self-defense against school bullies and her early marriage attest to her physical and sexual prowess, which counteract the im- age of the despised, weak stranger that the peer community impressed on the refugee children. Now, envisaged as a protagonist-"I am a bird-watcher and so is Metuka, my protagonist of many names"-Metuka refuses the passive role of a bird-watcher as an imitation of the bird-watcher narrator. In fact, she joins forces with Glycera, and the two become indistinguishable. Her rebellious refusal to de- fer to her creator forebodes destruction: "Listen," Metuka tells the narrator, "I warn you, freedom will crush you, it will disintegrate everything, it will blur the con- tours; no image will emerge, no picture, no character, no story" (IL 20).

Whereas the narrator's fear of artistic freedom forebodes the destruction of the artist, the challenge of creative freedom threatens no less a calamity. Finally given the liberty to speak, Metuka has gained the power to destroy the story, which writes her into existence; thus she intends to destroy not only herself, but also her maker, the artist. Her ominous pre- diction of emptiness, shapelessness, and chaos forebodes a definitive victory of the terrible over the beautiful. Ironically, in search for a source of hope, the narrator turns to the tragic sto- ry of Dolce. The story reaches us in the lament of R. Eliezer ben Judah of Worms for his wife, Dolce, who, together with her two daughters, was murdered by the Crusaders. Written in the Middle Ages, at the time of terrible persecutions, the eu- logy counteracts the message of "The Ballad of the Wolf," written in the twentieth century in the midst of the most terrible persecution of all. As we learn from the "Ballad," the history of eight hundred years between the two texts, which culmi- nated in the terror of the Holocaust, has erased the Weltanschauung that reaffirmed faith and love at the terrible time of the Crusades. Eliezer's lament draws upon the famous praise of the woman of valor in Proverbs 31. The eulogy portrays Dolce as a pious, virtuous, and charitable woman. She stitched about forty Torah scrolls, she washed the dead and sewed their shrouds, she sang Sabbath hymns sweetly, and apparently she was a successful merchant (IL 130).19 Significantly, the eulogy does not dwell on Dolce's tragic death, but, rather, on her meritorious life. Unlike the graphic depictions of terrible suffering and death in Tchernichowski's poem, the horror of Dolce's murder is at- tenuated by an idealized portrayal of a woman of good deeds, totally devoted to her husband, her children, and the community at large. The composition of the lament expresses not only her husband's love, but also the desire to keep her mem- ory alive for her contemporaries as well as for posterity. To reaffirm the continu- ing relevance of the tradition, the lament resorts to the biblical text. The biblical model of the woman of valor not only enhances the virtues and the honor of the victim; the reference to the scriptures also brings consolation to the mourning hus- band and the community at large. Produced under the terrible duress of persecu- tions and out of grief for the loss of materfamilias, the lament seeks reassurance in the biblical foundations of Jewish family tradition. In this sense, therefore, the eulogy represents tikkun; it tells the listeners that the mending of the world lies in the continuation of the Jewish way of life, which adheres to the eternal lessons of the Bible. The juxtaposition of Eliezer's lament and "The Ballad of the Wolf" makes clear that the example of Dolce cannot offer a solace of tikkun to the post-Holo- caust protagonist. The redeeming powers of the reaffirmation of the tradition in Dolce's eulogy arises from a clear distinction between good and bad, sin and virtue. This distinction communicates the unshaken conviction that, despite, or perhaps because of, the terrible outburst of evil, the concept of goodness, and especially, good deeds, has remained valid and indispensable to the society. In contrast, as 19. See Judith Baskin, "Jewish Women in the Middle Ages," in Jewish Women in Historical Per- spective, ed. Judith Baskin (Detroit: Wayne University Press, 1991), 106.

Protective barriers of tradition are no longer valid in the historical reality of the Holocaust, whose terror has perme- ated the world at large. The evil of the perpetrators affected the victims. Consequently, the parental experience of evil shaped the legacy of the post-Holocaust children, both German and Jewish. As the tragic story of Glycera and Joachim shows, the children have become heirs to a legacy that will eventually destroy them. To gain a more com- prehensive understanding of the problem of the children facing the legacy of parental generation, I turn to Almog's first novel, Be-'erez gezerah (Exile), pub- lished in 1971. Already at this early stage of her writing career, Almog examined the impact of evil on children, both Jewish and German, born after the Holocaust. Here it is important to note that the theme of difficult relationships with parents who experienced the Holocaust emerged even before in Almog's writing. In her first collection of short stories (1969), Hasdei ha-laila shel Margarita (The Night- ly Charities ofMargarita), Almog draws on her own difficult personal experience as a child of German refugees. In Exile, Margarita, the Jewish protagonist-narrator meets the characters of Marianne and Bastian, the children of an old and unrepentant Nazi general. The burden of their Nazi heritage has irreparably damaged the psyche of the siblings, infusing a sense of identity, which robbed them of normal lives. Marianne's self- loathing, which results in self-abuse, leads to a psychosomatic sickness and at- tempts of suicide. Bastian maintains his sanity by adopting the attitude of an objective philosopher, and becomes relentlessly judgmental of others. This attitude distances him from humanity; he admits to Margarita his inability to love even his own sister.20 Margarita, whose parents' and especially her father's legacy of the Holocaust made her sick, feels strong affinity with the German siblings. Marianna's hopeless desire to discard the burden of the heritage that her father imposed on her makes Margarita see their common unhappiness, an understanding, which generate the feeling of closeness, "At this moment I understood clearly the meaning of my love for her, such instant love."2' An even greater sense of closeness emerges when she realizes that Bastian's inability to love is the result of his brutal mistreatment at the hands of his father. Longing for the days of Hitler's glory, which he wishes to re- store (E 125), the Nazi general wished to raise Bastian as a soldier to continue the military tradition of his aristocratic family. When Bastian refuses to comply, the father treats him with terrible cruelty. Bastian's misfortune reminds Margarita of her disastrous relationship with her father.

Berger and Naomi Berger, Second Generation Voic- es: Reflections by Children of Holocaust Survivors and Perpetrators (New York: Syracuse University Press, 2001). Especially relevant to our discussion are the parts "Confronting a Repressed Past" and "Is Dialogue Possible?" which raise the issue of the responses to the children of Nazis to the family history. To a remarkable extent, the autobiographical stories and testimonies corroborate Almog's lit- erary representations of the second generation Germans. 21.

When she refuses to comply, he becomes ruthless, treats her with great cruelty, and eventually disowns her. The similarities between Margarita and Bastian's relationships with their fa- thers bring forth a new understanding. "It occurred to me," Margarita thinks, "that the connection between myself and Bastian ... an unspoken agreement, a connec- tion between a Jewess and a German ... was something fundamental, something that emerges between people when divisions collapse" (E 137). The abuse of the children on both sides for not fulfilling the expectations to rebuild that which they did not destroy gives Margarita another, even more radical, insight: "It occurred to me how ridiculous is our division of the world into the accused and the accusers, into the victims and the murderers" (E 132). Margarita's recollection of her cruel father, which emerges when facing Bastian, the victim of his despotic father, has created a category of victims and victimizers grounded in differentiations other than religion, ethnicity, or history. Margarita's new perspective highlights the deleterious impact of fathers, who, it must be emphasized, under diametrically opposed (vic- tim as opposed to victimizer) circumstances, were touched and transformed by evil. Cruelty vitiates the perpetrator; but it touches and transforms the afflicted as well, and the corrupting permutations of evil damage the lives of the children. This brief reference to Exile, a novel I discuss in more detail elsewhere,22 di- rects our attention to the impact of evil upon the family nucleus. While in Exile the children pay a terrible price for their refusal to comply with parental wishes, in The Inner Lake they pay equally dearly for their adherence to parental legacies. The ob- sessive desire to live up to parental expectations deprives the children of the sense of identity, which would allow a measure of independence. When Joachim declares his love for Glycera, he claims that, because of their mixed, German (Nazi)-Jew- ish parentage, their marriage "will be a great victory" (IL 123). He can see the world only through the prism of the mission of tikkun that his mother imposed on him; it is a mission that determines his life of crime and terror. Joachim's inabili- ty to extricate himself from his terrorist identity represents a terrible parody of tikkun in the post-Holocaust world. Glycera, who "never really understood who she was" (IL 31), finds herself in an even more complex predicament. While she declares to be looking for the man she claims to love, but whom she never trusts, she even more frantically seeks an answer to the haunting question of her identity. The obsessive recitation of "The Ballad of the Wolf" indicates Glycera's impossible split identity: Were her ances- tors the persecutors of the Jews in this German town, or rather, their, Jewish vic- tims? The burden of the mixed parentage is further aggravated by her parents' legacies, which, quite literally, designated her person as an embodiment of tikkun. On the one hand, Glycera incarnates her mother's attempt at expiation for her fa- ther's life as a Nazi. On the other hand, named after the first Glycera, she becomes, in a sense, the reincarnation of her father's dead lover. 22. An essay on Exile will be incorporated in the book on Almog. The main points of this es- say were presented in a paper delivered at the National Association of Professors of Hebrew (NAPH) conference in 2002. 264</page><page sequence="17">Ruth Almog's The Inner Lake The traumatic legacies of the children attest to the transformation of parental attitudes of the Holocaust generation. Rather than protection, unconditional love, and good prospects for the future, the parents give their children the task of mend- ing their pasts. In this sense, the children are prevented from writing, so to speak, their own life stories. To elucidate this point, it is interesting to note Slavoj Zizek's observation that we first construct our life stories and then live them out; that is to say, the true action comes before the actual performance. Zilek contends that "when we intervene in the world through a particular act . . . the real act is of a strictly symbolic nature, it consists in the very mode in which we structure the world, our perception of it in advance ... the real act thus precedes the (particu- lar-factual) activity."23 Following Zi'ek's observation, it is commonplace to argue that, under normal circumstances, the mode of the perception of the world that pre- cedes the concrete act is shaped, at least to an extent, by external factors, which in- clude parental influence. Life perception evolves and changes over time, due to the environment and its many stimulations. Thus, the modes of perception perchance shift and change, determining new kinds of intervention with the world. In contrast, Glycera and Joachim's life stories were predetermined, even be- fore they were born. There is no option to modify the modes of perception. Liter- ally, their raison d 'tre is to bear the consequences of acts they did not commit, to make up for suffering they did not undergo, and to replace losses that were not theirs. In sum, they were predestined to bring a cathartic resolution to the histori- cal tragedy in which they had no share. The sameness of their raison d 'tre elucidates Glycera's identification of Joachim as her twin. Joachim, she claims, is her twin not only because of their common German-Jewish heritage; the connection is even deeper, because, as she claims, they both have "the same problem that nobody understands, which can be summed up in three words-the problem of the perennial escape [becayat ha- berihah ha-matmedet]" (IL 35). The statement is puzzling. As already noted, it is the aspect of chase and pur- suit that seem to govern both Glycera and Joachim's life stories. What is then the haunting specter that they have been forever running away from? In a way, it is pos- sible to claim that both characters try unsuccessfully to escape the mode of per- ception into which they were locked. This perception, which decreed Joachim as a hunter and Glycera as a wanderer, prevented them from creating their own per- ception of the world. On this level, their obsessive pursuit, which comes to its end with Glycera's death, indicates their failure to set themselves free from the roles that they were assigned. At a deeper level, however, it is possible to see Joachim and Glycera's per- sistent pursuit of others as an escape from a truth that is even more traumatic than the legacy neither can abandon. Even harder than a life of constant restlessness would be the realization of parental betrayal. To stop running, the protagonists would need to acknowledge that they serve as instruments of their parents' obses- sive need to settle accounts with history. From this perspective, it is possible to un- 23. Slavoj Zifek, The Sublime Object of Ideology (London: Verso, 1989), 215-216. (Emphasis in the text.) 265</page><page sequence="18">Rachel Feldhay Brenner derstand the narrative element of the perennial escape, which in turn structures the life of perennial pursuit: The realization of having been born to perform a task, rather than to be loved, is too devastating to be consciously confronted. Conse- quently, the defense mechanism, which protects the children from such traumatic realization, locks them in the fate of pursuers. At one point, Glycera tries to change her identity as a wanderer by renaming herself Calypso, after the mythical god- dess, and like Calypso, the ruler and dweller of an island, where she concealed Odysseus, establish a permanent home with her lover; Joachim makes desperate efforts to change his identity as a Nazi hunter and quit the gang to marry his beloved. These desires notwithstanding, the commitment to their missions always prevails, and the escape from the pain of parental lovelessness continues until the tragic denouement. The absence of the parents highlights the children's fixation on parental lega- cy. We note that neither the death of the mothers, nor the disappearance of the fa- thers ends the chase-escape patterns. In particular, the story of Glycera's father underlines the tragic dimensions of this commitment to the legacy that spells the disintegration of humanist values. The name of Glycera's father, Albert Cohen, evokes another Albert Cohen, the great Jewish-French-Swiss writer of Greek ori- gin. The association highlights, by contrast, the horrific legacy of emptiness and death that Albert Cohen, the character in The Inner Lake, bequeathed to his daugh- ter. The writer Albert Cohen was born on the Greek island of Corfu in 1895 and died in Geneva in 1981. He witnessed the Holocaust from the shores of England. Cohen, who was deeply affected by anti-Semitism as a child, and who, despite his love for European, especially French, culture, always felt an outsider on account of his Jewish origins, believed in the special mission of the Jew. As one of his crit- ics maintains: "Le destin juif de Cohen est donc un destin du poete, porteur de la douloureuse condition humaine."24 Indeed, in his work, Cohen fulfilled the des- tiny of the Jew as a poetic caretaker of the human condition. In the aftermath of the Holocaust, Cohen produced his masterpiece, Belle du Seigneur (1968). The plot of the novel takes place in the 1930s. Cohen's Jewish protagonist, Solal, is a symbolic figure of a self-appointed Messiah who strives to redeem the world. He has a global vision of reconciliation of Jews and non-Jews, of East and West, and of the differences that divide humankind. Solal's attempts at tikkun end in failure. However, even as he fails, he still clings to the hope for humanity and to his faith in love and in humankind. The beliefs of his hero reflect Cohen's convictions. In- deed, in his contemplative work, O Vous Freres Humains, published soon after Belle du Seigneur, in 1972, Cohen reaffirmed his belief in human fellowship: "Pour moi qui vis avec ma mort depuis mon enfance, je sais que 1'amour and sa soeur cadette la bonte sont les seules importances. Mais comment lefaire croire a mesfreres humains? 0 vous,freres humains, connaissez lajoie de nepas hair."25 24. D. R.

Cohen thus reaffirms the humanist tenet that each human being has the potential of becoming an ethical human being. Because of his people's long history of suffering, it is the responsibility of the Jewish poet to teach this truth to humanity. Cohen's inherently humanistic view of the world explains why he situates his novel in the pre-Holocaust world. As David Coward maintains in his introduction to Belle du Seigneur, "had he [Cohen] extended the time-scale, it seems reason- able to think that the horrors of the Holocaust could not have been kept at arm's length in quite the same way and that Cohen's generous, conciliatory humanism would then have been harder to sustain."26 The fictional story of Albert Cohen in The Inner Lake seems to corroborate Coward's astute observation. Indeed, the tenets of humanism have become meaningless for the Albert Cohen who did ex- perience the horror of concentration camps and who lost everything: his family, the girl he loved, his home, and his family's property. Unlike Cohen the writer, who continues to deliver a message of hope to hisfreres humains, Cohen, the charac- ter, cannot maintain any hope for the future. A victim of the Holocaust, for whom his native island became a ghost island, Cohen "turned into a grave" (IL 30). De- spite the appearance of normality, and the attempt to establish a family, his soul has become a memorial to the death of all those he loved and who loved him. Un- like the Cohen who, in his fiction, leaves his readers with the legacy of trust that humaneness will prevail, the legacy that the fictional Cohen leaves his daughter is a story of death and despair. The legacy of death and despair extends to the generation of the children and destroys it. It is in this sense of the encompassing and perpetuating impact of evil that we can understand the narrator's observation, "As far as I know, the philoso- phers of the second half of the twentieth century did not deal with the issue of evil, though, as I see it, evil is the fundamental experience of those born in this centu- ry" (IL 122). The detrimental effects of pervasive evil raise the question of the aes- thetic of the sublime. Can there be any beauty born in a world, which resonates with terror? Is it still possible to revive any of the humanistic values in a world im- bued with the consciousness of evil? Is there any hope for tikkun? With reference to such questions, Jean-Frangois Lyotard postulates that in the postmodern age, which has "given us as much terror as we can take," the beauty of wholeness is no longer possible. The postmodern aesthetic of the sublime, Lyotard argues, "puts forward the unpresentable in the presentation itself.., it denies itself the solace of good forms, the consensus of the taste ... it searches for new presentations, not in order to enjoy them but in order to impart a stronger sense of the unpresentable."27 I argue that The Inner Lake presents an alternative to Lyotard's position. death since childhood, I know that love and her younger sister, goodness, are the only important things. But how shall I make my fellow-brothers believe it? ... O, my fellow-brothers, recognize the joy of not hating." (My translation from the French.) 26.

The sublime of violence and de- struction, or "the fundamental experience of evil" has invaded our world as well as our selves; though unpresentable, this pervasive, ominous presence of senseless terror cannot be denied. Senselessness signifies the disintegration of the story and therefore the end of the art of telling. In other words, a representation of sense- lessness is bound to become senseless. Considered from this point of view, Ly- otard's search for presentation, which "denies itself the solace of good forms, the consensus of the taste, and enjoyment," spells senselessness, which forebodes dis- integration of literary forms and consequently extinction of the literary tradition. Obviously, the text of The Inner Lake acknowledges the portents of terror with regards to art. At the same time, it seeks new forms, not in order to "putfor- ward the unpresentable," but, rather, in order to fend offits invading presence. This approach reflects the position of a mature artist, one who is conscious of the de- fensive position of art in this day and age. The consciousness of the encroaching unpresentable gives birth to the mother in the artist, who, while recognizing the terror, which truncates the story, nonetheless insists on protecting the fragments. To deter the unpresentable, she invokes old forms to forge them as means of re- sistance against the menace of formlessness. We could claim that the fabric of The Inner Lake implies the threat of chaos. The randomness of the hibur reflects the disintegration of literary conventions. The loose collage of fictional and nonfictional materials communicates the breakup of the accepted literary forms. The writer's abdication of the traditional role of the au- thor as teller of stories, deviser of causal plots, and constructor of plausible char- acters forebodes chaotic formlessness. The danger of the decomposition of the centerless text is further augmented by the blurred boundaries of the authorial "I" and the fictional "I." The motif of the iceberg, and, more specifically, the wish to "have" the ice- berg, rather than the ship, illustrates the desire to exit the fearful world of anarchy and chaos. The perfection of the swan underlines the desire to return to the age of innocence and purity. But the historical reality of terror would allow neither a re- treat into the atemporal magnificence of the iceberg nor identification with the in- nocent beauty of the swan. Rather, it engages the artist in a battle, which portends the victory of evil. Indeed, the portent actualizes in Glycera's tragic and horrible death, which joins her with her Nazi grandfather and thus symbolically taints love with evil. It would appear that the death of the protagonist signifies the artist's fail- ure to forestall the terror of the unpresentable. The "Jewish mother" has failed to protect her "daughter." Neither the myth of the peacock and its feather of eternal life, nor the lament over Dolce, the eulogized woman valor, could defuse despair. The stories failed to provide a viable alternative to the unpresentable, which would prevent, as Glycera's death proves, the victory of evil over love. Yet, since the episode of Glycera's terrible end is not the end of the story, the victory of evil has not yet been determined. The progression beyond the death scene implies resistance to an end of senseless violence and meaningless silence. 268</page><page sequence="21">Ruth Almog's The Inner Lake To assess the signification of this resistance in terms of the development of the ma- ture artist, I return once again to Exile. Like Glycera in The Inner Lake, Margari- ta dies a violent death. Having returned to Germany, to her father's home village, she evokes the rage of the villagers. To escape their assault, she jumps to her death from the attic of her father's house, her last words being, "I crawled to the entrance and collapsed on the threshold until morning" (E 189).28 In the morning, she is found dead. Like Glycera, who is destroyed because of her desire to expose the old Nazi and thus symbolically disempower the forces of evil, Margarita's desire to confront the villagers with their anti-Semitic hatred ends in her violent death. Though the stories of the two protagonists reveal correspondences, their forms differ. Let us recall that Margarita is the protagonist/first-person narrator of her autobiographical story. Her death is, therefore, the death of the double "I,"- the "I" of the narrator, which is also the "I" of the protagonist. Since the teller dies with her character, the "double" death pronounces not only the end of the story, but also the impossibility of a future story. Margarita and her story therefore die in an outburst of primitive, senseless violence, followed by the silence of unutter- able terror. Unutterable terror is also the first reaction of the narrator to Glycera's vio- lent death. "I opened my mouth," she tells us, "but no sound came out" (IL 134). Significantly, the sound does come out in the following segment, and the fact that the narrator continues the story draws the distinction between the person of the narrator, who survives, and that of the protagonist, who does not. This distinction emerges clearly in the opening sentence of the segment, which follows the death scene, "Thus, Metuka and I," the narrator observes, "have completed our mythi- cal sea voyage, and we find ourselves in the starting point" (IL 134). The specification "Metuka and I," as well as the pronoun "we," indicates that the "I" of the narrator does not merge with the persona of the protagonist. At this point it is important to recall that, as I have shown in the beginning of this essay, the "I" of the narrator does merge with the "I" of the author, ha-mehaberet ("the author") of this hibur. The fact that the narrator is the creator of the protagonist and, at the same time, an autobiographical refraction of the author reemphasizes the fictionality of this fiction. Paradoxically, the intentional emphasis on fiction- ality reaffirms the role of the storyteller in the age of the unpresentable. The in- sistence on suspending belief that is, the exposure of the process of making the story proves the possibility of creativity despite the menace of terror. We have not- ed the dead end of the story in Exile. Margarita, the daughter who struggles with her father, loses herself in her story, having failed to maintain distance from her creation. She dies, and the story ends with her death. In contrast with the irrevo- cable finality in Exile, the mother in the artist in The Inner Lake allows her story to lead her toward destruction while remaining conscious that "The voyage never ends. Even before the end, the story starts anew" (IL 125). The story never ends, because another version, or the "opposite," as Calas- so taught us, is an integral part of the story. Thus, immediately after the episode of 28. A reference to the death of the Levite's concubine in Judges 19. 269</page><page sequence="22">Rachel Feldhay Brenner the protagonist's violent death, the narrator regains control over her story. She ush- ers her protagonist to the world of myth, where death is never final. The peacock's feather, which the narrator gives her protagonist, promises her eternal life (IL 134). Another version resolves the problem of the protagonist's ancestry. Identifying her- self with the Jewish tradition, as represented by Dolce, the Jewish woman of val- or, the protagonist enters a "small, old graveyard" where "ancient trees cast deep shadow" and "deep grass hides ancient tombstones." There, she lies on the grass and closes her eyes (IL 127). It seems that she has finally found peace of mind and soul. The third version, however, indicates that the consciousness of terror cannot be eliminated or suppressed by resorting to the old traditions of storytelling. On the contrary, the hope for tikkun, however partial and imperfect, is predicated upon the acknowledgment of the presence of evil. Thus, paradoxically, to be rescued from complete fragmentation and formlessness, the story must recognize the ter- ror which forebodes its ending. The red flower that the narrator places on Glyc- era's grave represents such recognition. The mother in the artist remembers Glycera's despair and her sense of emptiness, and feels as if "she had been vio- lently torn out of my heart and left it hollow" (IL 128). The recognition of despair gives birth to terrible emptiness. Unlike the Yazidi worshippers, who succeed in evading direct confrontation with Satan, the narrator can no longer evade the en- counter. The "fundamental experience of evil" in the twentieth century has creat- ed a sense of irretrievable loss and disconsolate despondency. The concrete, physical sense of hollowness cannot be ignored, but the re- sponsibility of the mother in the artist is to outweigh the birth of terrible emptiness with the birth of terrible beauty. Indeed in a magnificent tableau (IL 135-6), which incorporates beauty and terror, the narrator kisses her baby, Caer, the mythical Irish "swan-lass," who arises once a year from the land of the dead. Now the narrator has been transformed for a moment into the queen mother, who, as the legend has it, gave birth to Caer by swallowing a butterfly. As the queen mother, the narrator finds herself in the position of giving birth to a new myth. In this myth, Caer calls her "mommy" twice, first showing her "a woman trampled in her blood," and sec- ond, pointing to Aphrodite's chariot, harnessed to swans, which traverses the sky. The cosmic image, which associates Aphrodite, the goddess of love with the per- fect beauty of the swan, must, from now on, coexist with the consciousness of the death of love, as represented by the terrible image of Glycera lying in blood. Indeed, it is the precarious balance of terror and beauty that informs the sto- ry that must continue in the age that has already seen the destruction of all forms and values. Thus the swans line together with the peacocks on the shore of the in- ner lake, watching "the seven little birds," which represent the freedom to create. The birds are under constant threat from the "hunter, who lies in wait." "If the birds die," the narrator knows, "the woman will die" (IL 138-9). In the age of terror, creation of beauty has become a dangerous undertaking. But it would be equally dangerous to renounce beauty. Against the notion that dismisses solace, taste, and pleasure in today's art, The Inner Lake argues for the continuing legitimacy and vi- ability of solace, taste, and pleasure in the reality of senseless evil. In a world that 270</page><page sequence="23">Ruth Almog's The Inner Lake has eliminated the hope for tikkun, the consciousness of traditions grounded in the certainty of redemption represents the only possibility of preventing evil from its ultimate victory of formlessness.
