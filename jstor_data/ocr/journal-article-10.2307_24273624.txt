Some of these statements found in Ycfet's commentary on wisdom literature and biblical narrative will be examined in this article. One case in which he speculates on biblical Hebrew syntax will also be examined. Gender equality1 in Yefet's work is anchored in the principle of logical inference, also known as analogy, qiyas, which served as one of the three major sources for the determination of Karaite halakhah. This article includes also a brief discussion of the role of qiyas in Karaite halakhah on marriage, divorce, and inheritance laws. Wisdom Literature In his commentary on Proverbs 18:22-19:22 Yefet claims that in light of the first verse, the entire segment deals with the topic of marriage. He adds a I extend my gratitude to Meira Polliack for her encouragement and enthusiasm, and for her invaluable insight and advice. I thank Ishay Rosen-Zvi for his thoughtful comments on an earlier draft of this paper. Research on gender in the medieval Jewish society under Islam is at its infancy.

The term ,gender equality' may seem anachronistic, as the concept did not exist in the Middle Ages. However, other terms that convey the same concept have become too specialized. Thus 'gender analogy' is related to race and disability discrimination, 'gender balance' is related to discrimination in the work place, and 'gender symmetry' is related to domestic violence. Therefore, for lack of a better choice, the term 'gender equality' will be used despite its limitations. 2. See the text and translation in section A in the appendix. Yefeton Proverbs 18:22-19:2 is part of the forthcoming comprehensive publication of a critical edition of Yefet's translation and commen tary on the Book of Proverbs to be published by Brill Publishers.

Therefore, he offers two sets of commentaries, one pertain ing to the literal meaning and the other to the contextual meaning. In his commen tary on 18:22 Yefet states that it is the obligation of every man to look for a suitable wife in order to obtain goodness from God, as the wife determines a man's material and spiritual life. In his commentary on the following verse, Yefet first presents the literal meaning which pertains to the relationship and power play between the poor and the rich. However, as part of his hermeneutic scheme, he also includes an interpretation that he justifies as contextually based (wa-jt niza mihimihi mana). Inequality marks the relationship between the rich and the poor, he says; therefore, it is necessary for men and women to resemble each other in their conditions in order for their union in marriage to be successful. Yefet men tions four areas in which it is important for the couple to resemble each other: social and ancestral status (hasab wa-nasab),3 financial state of affairs, age, and appearance.4 Verse 18:24 prompts Yefet to make statements in favor of the insti tution of marriage as opposed to the disadvantages of bachelorhood. In his com mentary on the subsequent verse, Yefet adds another area in which the couple should resemble each other. One must look for a mate who is intellectually on par with oneself. This trait, he says, far outweighs riches and looks. Yefet's novelty does not present itself in the subject matter of this set of advice. After all it is common sense that one should look for a well-to-do mate from a respectable bloodline. Instead, Yefet's originality lies in his egalitarian approach. It is the responsibility of both parties, he says, to look for a suitable match. Even more so, the success of their union, he claims, depends on the resem blance of their situation. They must share similar circumstances and dispositions financially, socially, intellectually and physically. While some of these were common considerations in marriages of the time, others seem avant-garde and betray a unique worldview, as will be discussed below.5 3. Yefet uses the couplet hasab wa-nasab which pertains to a person's position in society based both on one's social status and ancestral heritage. Roy Mottahedeh discusses the breadth of meaning, use, and significance of these terms, commonly used in the world of medieval Islam. See Roy P. Mot tahedeh, Loyalty and Leadership in an Early Islamic Society (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1980), 97-174. 4. Compare with Islamic law, kafaa, which varies with regard to the ideal match. While the scholars of Medina reduced kafaa to the prohibition of a marriage between a pious woman and a lib ertine, the HanafI school regarded a marriage between two people of the same lineage, social status, seniority in Islam, and similar morality as ideal. See Y. Linant de Bellefonds, "Kafa'a," Encyclopaedia of Islam2of Islam2 4:404. See also Joseph Schacht, "Nikah," Encyclopaedia of Islam2 8:26-28. A detailed dis cussion of the evolution of the law of kafaa in early Islamic law, the integration of the requirement for social equality and religious equality in marriage, can be found in Hammudah 'Abd al 'AtT, The Family Structure Structure in Islam (Plainfield: American Trust Publications, 1977), 84-97. 5.

Without them [a child] is raised by ignorance, and becomes a disgrace to his parents. He only mentioned the mother without the father; however, no doubt they both participate in this [task]. Perhaps, he only mentioned the mother because trouble is initially apparent to her, for he [the child] attacks her first before [he attacks] the father.6 Yefet is aware that the biblical text only mentions the mother. However, motivated by a sense of equality, he stresses that it is the obligation of both parents to educate and discipline their children. At the same time, Yefet does not dismiss the biblical text's formulation; rather, after expressing his stance, he explains why only the mother is mentioned.7 In order to further examine Yefet's egalitarian approach it is important to compare his commentary with that of other exegetes of his time. In his commen tary on Proverbs 23:22, "Listen to your father who begot you, and do not despise your mother when she is old," Saadiah Gaon does not address the first hemistich. Concerning the second he says: His saying "do not despise your mother when she is old," is related to what people say about young individuals. Even if he [a young person] has a greater intellectual capacity than an elderly man, he must listen to the elderly man and not deprecate him. For the elderly man teaches him from his experience, and experience has more value than sharpness of mind.8 Avraham Grossman, Pious and Rebellious: Jewish Women in Europe in the Middle Ages (Jerusalem: The Zalman Shazar Center for Jewish History, 2001), 63-87; and Olszowy-Schlanger, "Early Karaite Family Law," in Karaite Judaism: A Guide to its History and Literary Sources, ed.

A Geniza fragment of particular interest is ENA 2445 1-2 which contains a chastisement of the sages of the Talmud for allowing the marriage of three-year-old girls.

Yefet further stresses the role of the mother as the educator of her children in his commentary on Proverbs 31:1 in which he says that Lemuel's mother educated her son and disciplined him in the way mothers discipline their children, fVI US ■01ג ^ ^גג (BL Or. 2553 (130a). 8.

His commentary is intended as a general statement that refers to the entire verse. However, he only uses masculine parts of speech, taking no account of the mother figure, rather treating the verse as if only the father figure were its subject. In contrast, Yefet's commentary on this verse is divided into three segments. In the first he says: He [Solomon] says here "he who begot you" after he had already said "to your father" in order to stress that he [your father] begot you and took care of you, meaning, he hopes the best for you. In the second he says: The clause "and do not despise your mother when she is old" means that when she grows old she might have difficulties, for many are the shortcomings of old age. He therefore says, beware not to despise her. In the last segment he concludes saying "Yet, anything that is mentioned about one parent no doubt applies to the other as well."9 Both Saadiah and Yefet comment on the literal meaning of the verse. However, while Saadiah presents one collective interpretation using the masculine voice, Yefet treats each hemistich of the verse separately, offering gender appro priate discussion of each one. In addition, Yefet concludes with an egalitarian statement in which he highlights that the teachings of the Book of Proverbs guide people to treat both parents respectfully. The following example is taken from the commentary on Proverbs 31:1 31:1 31:10-31, the acrostic poem also known as 'The Woman of Valor.' In his introduc tion to the poem, Saadiah explains that the author ends his book with a metaphor of the good wife in order to compare her with every wise and proper man. He further expounds that humans are made up of a physical body, a soul which is more eminent than the body, and an intellect which is more eminent than both the body and the soul. He says that because the physical body is the only one of these three which is visible to the senses, the poet chose to use plain language and describe physical skills. However, Saadiah adds that the sage (Solomon) chose to devise his metaphor about the skills of a woman, and not a man, out of reverence for men. The supposition that underlies Saadiah's commentary is that the description of a woman's body is acceptable, while the description of a man's body is disrespectful. In accordance with this supposition, Saadiah inter prets each verse of the poem as if it were written about a man. For example in his commentary on Proverbs 31:11, "the heart of her husband trusts in her," he says "[people] trust the exalted manager and depend on his opinion."10 Likewise, throughout the poem Saadiah assumes the subject of each verse to be a man and 9. BL Or 2553 (108a). See section C in the appendix for the original text. 10. Saadiah, Mishle, 271: אן אלמדבר אלמגיד יותק בה ויסכן אליה ראיה. 54</page><page sequence="5">Gender Equality in Yefet Ben 'Eli's Commentary systematically relates to each one of them in the masculine voice. It is easy to imagine that Saadiah's intellectual world is a men's world, his writings address an audience of men, and perhaps he assumes that the poet of Proverbs aims to target exclusively male audiences as well. Such supposition allows him to suggest that 'The Woman of Valor' describes the attributes of man, similar to his aforemen tioned treatment of "and do not despise your mother when she is old" (Proverbs 23:22). In the case of'The Woman of Valor,' Saadiah justifies his use of the mascu line voice based on the classification of the poem as a metaphor. Yefet's approach to 'The Woman of Valor' is very different. To begin with, while Saadiah surmises that the author of the poem is Solomon, Yefet suggests that it was penned by a woman, Lemuel's mother, whom he assumes is Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. Yefet's suggestion is based on contextual and structural con siderations, as the acrostic poem immediately follows the words of Lemuel's mother. He explains that after warning her son against amassing and being preoc cupied by women, Lemuel's mother states that good women are rare. She then begins to enumerate the good woman's attributes. Yefet interprets each verse lit erally in the feminine voice without questioning the author's choice of gender. Nevertheless, in his commentary on verse 31, "and let her works praise her in the city gates," he says: She [Solomon's mother] included in this statement her [The Woman of Valor's] husband and sons and all who heard of her fame both during her life and after her death, for it is her merit, as it is the merit of each and every noble, wise, and pious person, as it is said "a person is commended according to his intelligence" (Proverbs 12:8)." Unlike Saadiah, Yefet identifies the main subject of the poem as the ideal woman. Yet, he also acknowledges the universality of the poem by pointing out that the praise the ideal woman deserves is, in fact, the praise every noble person deserves, whether a man or a woman. Thus, even if in the end both Saadiah and Yefet con elude that the poem describes the ideal person, for Saadiah this ideal is a man, while for Yefet it is a human being, be it a man or a woman. Biblical Narrative A similar propensity for gender equality is found in Yefet's commentary on narrative passages of the Bible as the following examples demonstrate. In his com mentary on Ruth 3:19 Yefet returns to the theme of marriage: The clause "in that you have not gone after young men" points to three matters, the first is what was mentioned before; the second is that Boaz was an old man; and the third is that just like a young lad wishes for a maid 11. 11. Translated according to Adler MS 3357 (128a): גמעת פי אלקול אלזוג ובניהא וסאיר מא יחצל בה כברהא ודלך פי חיאתהא ובעד מותהא לאנהא תסתחק דלן כמא יסתחק כל פאצל עאקל דיין בקולה לפי שכלו יהלל איש. 55</page><page sequence="6">liana liana Sasson young as he is for himself, so too a young maid wishes for a lad young as she is for herself. However, Ruth, for her humbleness and pursuit of faith in God was content with an old man.12 Yefet underscores that, concerning marriage, both men and women look to fulfill their heart's desires and both look for spouses who are similar to them. According to Yefct's egalitarian approach the process a woman goes through when choosing a spouse is not different than a man's. Even more so, he describes women as active agents when seeking a spouse.13 In his introduction to the Book of Ruth, Yefet includes in his egalitarian approach a discussion of faith: We found that the convert who joins the faith of Israel may reach an exalted level by his obedience, as was said about Jethro, peace upon him, who had a great reputation and an honorable position as a result of his trust in God and his obedience to Him, as we have discussed in the passage of "Jethro heard" (Exodus 18:1). Such matters are not limited to men only, rather they can be demonstrated in women too. Such is the case of Jael whom Deborah men tioned in her poem proclaiming her exalted rank with God saying "Most blessed of women be Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, of tent-dwelling women most blessed" (Judges 5:24), so too is this person whose story and the content of her scroll we interpret. I mean Ruth, peace upon her.14 This passage is a testimony to Yefet's egalitarian approach. For him faith in God and proclamation of monotheism, the main tenet in the Jewish faith, are not limited to one gender. For Yefet women are equal to men in their pursuit of faith and obe dience to God. By emphasizing the equality between a man and a woman in matters of faith Yefet seems to be making a consciously polemical statement, meant as a refutation of an opposing opinion. Yet, are women more liable for their actions than men? Yefet's commentary on Numbers 12:1 elucidates his position on this question: The meaning of "Miriam spoke" is in the sense of vilification such as "they spoke against God" (Psalms 78:19); "the people spoke against God and against Moses" (Numbers 21:5); and "when I rise, they speak against me" (Job 19:18). The meaning of all these [citations] is vilification and defamation. It has been said about Miriam that she was the one who spoke and that Aaron did not deny her words, therefore the verb refers to him too. It has also been said that she began (speaking) and that Aaron collaborated with her...15 12.

See text in section D in the appendix. 56</page><page sequence="7">Gender Equality in Yefet Ben 'Elf s Commentary After establishing that the use of ותדבר "(she) spoke" refers here to slander, Yefet deliberates over this problematic verb. Why is the verb declined in the feminine singular, yet followed by two names? Yefet presents two solutions, both of which he quotes in the name of anonymous commentators. Both solutions result with putting the blame equally on Aaron and Miriam. Whether Miriam was the only speaker and Aaron did not deny her words, or she initiated the conversation and Aaron joined in, Yefet accuses both Aaron and Miriam of slanderous talk. Yefet's second solution resembles an interpretation found in Sifrei Bamidbar: "'Miriam spoke' teaches us that both vilified him, however, Miriam was the first to speak."16 Yet, it stands in contrast to most other interpretations of this text. Rabbi Judah son of Nehemiah is quoted making general statements about women in a midrash found in Bereshit Rabba. Among other things he blames women for being loquacious and mentions Numbers 12:1 as his prooftext.17 Miriam is accused of slander and falsehood in a number of midrashim in this text found in Vayikra Rabba and Bamidbar Rabba.18 Yefet's view of Miriam and Aaron bearing equal responsibility for the vilification is not only unique when compared with the sages quoted in the early midrashim, but also in compari son with medieval European commentators who lived after him. Of those, Rabbi Levi b. Gershom stands out, as he accuses Miriam of being the only one who spoke against Moses, while he reduces Aaron's fault to merely not rebuking his sister.19 Not only does Yefet present women as men's equal with regard to matters of marriage, respect, faith, and responsibility, he also finds women equally 16. Sifrei Bamidbar 41. It is interesting to note that the commentary of Ibn Ezra includes both of Yefet's citations, which discuss the semantic field of דבר ב 'speak' to include slanderous talk, and the first solution he offers to the problem of agreement between verb and subject. It is possible that this is one of the cases, already described in modern scholarly literature, in which Ibn Ezra quotes Yefet. About Ibn Ezra's attitude towards Karaites see, among others, P. R. Weis, "Ibn Ezra vehakaraim baha lakhah," Melilah 1 (1944): 35-53; and Ezra Zion Melamed, Mefarshe ha-mikra: darkhehem ve-shetotehem,ve-shetotehem, vol. 2(Jerusalem: The Magnes Press, 1975), 676-8.

"He remembers here that the Lord, exalted, was angry with them and that the spirit of prophecy was removed from them. Then the cloud was removed from the tent [of meeting] and it was revealed that Miriam remained "leprous as white as snow" (Numbers 12:10). This is a sign that Miriam alone spoke against Moses, as mentioned before. However, Aaron was reprimanded for not rebuking his sister and for supporting her words. Therefore, Miriam precedes Aaron in the verse "Miriam and Aaron spoke" (Numbers 12:1). Levi b. Gershom, Perushe ha-torah le-rabbenu Levi ben Gershom (rlb"g),(rlb"g), ed.

In the last segment of his commentary on chapter seven of the Book of Esther, Yefet deliberates over several difficulties in the story. Among others, he asks the following question: Was Esther's under taking her own, or did she act on the advice of Mordechai, or at the behest of God? He argues: Now we would maintain that she possessed merit and forethought and had no need for advice of another, for do you not see that she says to Mordechai, "Go, gather together," etc. (Esther 4:16); though if we should say that God prompted her to it in a dream, it is possible.20 Yefet has no doubt in Esther's abilities, initiative, and resourcefulness. He maintains that Esther was the mind behind her mission, and did not require the guidance of Mordechai. It is noteworthy that Yefet considers this an important matter that needs to be deliberated. Perhaps this issue was a subject of polemics to which he is reacting. Perhaps Yefet responds here to the common view that minimizes Esther's role in the salvation of the Jews and portrays her as a fearful and passive figure.21 In the same passage Yefet discusses another crux in the text, namely the absence of the name of God. He suggests several reasons for this. Among others, he suggests that the Book of Esther, as we have it, is a product of a redactor (אלמדוון)(אלמדוון)(אלמדוון) who copied Esther's writings. She, on her part, avoided mentioning the name of God out of fear that her writings might fall into the hands of gentiles, who might attribute the work of God to other deities.22 We learn from this that Yefet credits the original writing of the story to Esther herself. It is possible that Yefet assumes that Esther wrote the text in light of the title of the scroll. It is impor tant to mention that Ibn Ezra, citing Saadiah, attributes the writing of the Book of Esther to Mordechai. Yet, there is no evidence that Saadiah himself attributed the writing of the book to Mordechai.23 Be that as it may, Yefet suggests that in 20. Michael G.

Sanhedrin 74b in which it is said that Esther was like the soil of the earth. Ibn Ezra interprets Esther's adjournment of the banquet as originating from her fear of Haman and concern for her own well-being.

In his second commentary on Esther Ibn Ezra writes: ויש שאלה למה לא נכתב השם במגלה הזאת והגאון רב סעדיה ז״ל השיב כי המלך צוה למרדכי שיכתוב המגלה ויעתיקוה בלשון פרם בספר דברי הימים. ואילו היה כותב שם השם הנכבד היו הפרסיים מחליפין אותו בשם עבודה זרה. 58</page><page sequence="9">Gender Equality in Yefet Ben 'Ell's Commentary the case of the Book of Esther, a woman was the author of the vorlage upon which the redactor based the composition of the book. As was mentioned before, Yefet attributes also the acrostic of 'The Woman of Valor' (Proverbs 31:10-31) to the authorship of a woman, Lemuel's mother. The attribution of biblical text to female authors is an uncommon egalitarian approach, especially in light of the reality in which Yefet lived, where most writings were products of male authors, while women authors were an extremely marginal phenomenon.24 Commenting on the attribution of authorship to Esther, Michael Wechsler suggests that Yefet's exegesis stems from "careful attention to psychology and logical inference extending from highly developed rationalistic, or literary "A question persists, why was the name [of God] not mentioned in the scroll. The Gaon, Rabbi Saadiah of blessed memory responded [to this saying] that the king ordered Mordechai to write the scroll in order that it be copied into the chronicles in the Persian language. Therefore, had he written the Honorable Name, the Persians would have altered it on behalf of idol worshiping."

Katsenelenbogen, Megillat Esther im periishe ha-rishonim (Jerusalem: Mossad Harav Kook, 2006), 110. See also, Wechsler, Esther, 28, 273. Yet, in the introduction to his first commentary, Ibn Ezra does not cite Saadiah, rather he presents the notion that Mordechai was the author of Esther as his own: והנה, אין במגילה הזאת זכר ה', והיא מספרי הקודש, ורבים השיבו כי הוא "ממקום אחר" וזה איננו נכון, כי לא נקרא ה' "מקום" בכל ספרי הקודש, רק נקרא "מעון" שהוא לעולם גבוה, וקדמונינו ז״ל קראונו "מקום" בעבור שכל מקום מלא כבודו. ועוד, מה טעם למלת "אחר". והנבון בעיני, שזאת המגילה חיברה מרדכי, וזה טעם "וישלח ספרים", וכולם משנה ספר אחד שהוא המגילה, כטעם "פתשגן", והעתיקוה הפרסיים ונכתבה בדברי הימים של מלכיהם, והם היו עובדי עבודה זרה, והיו כותבין תחת השם הנכבד והנורא שם תועבתם, כאשר עשו הכותים שכתבו תחת "בראשית ברא אלהים" "ברא אשימא", והנה כבוד השם שלא יזכירנו מרדכי במגילה. "There is no mention of God in this scroll even though it is one of the holy books. Many com mented that God is included in "from another place," but this is not correct, for God is never called "place" in Scripture, only "maon," which always means 'high.' However, the early sages called Him "place" because His glory is omnipresent. In addition, what would be the meaning of the word "another?" What seems right to me is that this scroll was written by Mordechai, as it is written "(Mordechai) sent letters,י' which were all copies of one book — the scroll, as it is written "a copy" (patshegen).(patshegen). The Persians copied and added it to the chronicles of their kings, who were idol worshi pers. (Had the name of God been mentioned) they would have written instead the name of their abom ination, similarly to the Cuthites who, instead of "In the beginning when God created," wrote 'Ashima created.'

It is important to add that nowhere in his short and long commen taries on the Book of Esther does Saadiah attribute the writing of the book to Mordechai. In the intro duction to his long commentary, he does, however, explain the absence of the name of God in the book, and the difficulty presented by the phrase "from another place" (Ibid., 315). Ibn Ezra's discussion, quoted above, bears significant similarity to that of Saadiah's. 24. Geniza documents indicate that women as a rule were not sent to school.

Biblical Hebrew Syntax Further evidence for Yefet's egalitarian worldview is found in his discussion of the syntax of biblical Hebrew. In his commentary on Exodus 21:10-11, "If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish the food, clothing, or conjugal rights of the first wife. And if he does not fulfill these three for her, she shall go out without debt, without payment of money." Yefet devotes a lengthy passage to the explanation of the terms "food" (שאר), "clothing" (כסות), and "conjugal rights" (ענה). In the end of the passage he asks why the Hebrew text counts "these three" (items) in the feminine voice (shlosh elleh) when one item, "food" (שאר), is grammatically masculine and the other two, "clothing" (כסות), and "conjugal rights" (ענה), are grammatically feminine. Yefet suggests two ways to resolve this problem. First, he suggests that while it says shlosh elleh ("these three") the text implies shlosh hukkot elleh ("these three" rights). Since the term חקות, "rights," is grammatically feminine, such a reading would restore the agreement between number and counted items. Second, Yefet suggests that perhaps because the majority of the counted items is feminine, the text refers to all in the feminine voice.27 Yefet's second suggestion is intriguing as he suggests that the gender of a number of counted items is determined by the gender of the majority of the items counted and not, as the common rule requires, by the pres ence or absence of a grammatically masculine element among the counted items. This egalitarian grammatical rule, even if not known elsewhere, is inspired by analogy and logical inference. Yefet's understanding of grammar as based on ega litarian concepts betrays an epistemological sense of equality, which exceeds bib lical exegesis, as it assumes that one's most fundamental tool, language itself, adheres to egalitarian rules. It is important to point out that despite his heightened sense of gender equal ity, Yefet did not shy away from writing misogynistic remarks. One such occasion is found in his commentary on Zechariah 5:9-11 in which he suggests that the woman sitting in the basket (איפה) in Zachariah's vision is a metaphor for the 25.

He speculates that these sages are compared to women to show that they possess some of the inferiorities that characterize women.28 In this case Yefet presents the common view of women known from other medieval Jewish and non-Jewish sources. Such views may demonstrate an inner tension in his thought as well as an ambivalence of the Karaite reformation of medieval Judaism at large. Karaite Halakhah in Light of the Principle of Logical Inference Yefet's propensity for gender equality as demonstrated in his commentary on wisdom literature, biblical narrative, and syntax presented above stems from his commitment to the principle of logical inference. The principle of logical infer ence not only shaped Yefefs exegesis but was also formative in the development of Karaite thought at large. Evidence for the role of logical inference in Karaite thought is found in the collective effort of Karaite sages to shape and redefine Karaite halakhah throughout the ages.29 The principle of logical inference, also known as analogy, היקש, was known in rabbinical literature as one of the hermeneutical devices for the determination of halakhah long before the emergence of Karaite Judaism. The presupposition behind the principle of logical inference is that when two subjects are connected by a common predicate, under certain circumstances, the same provisions that apply to one will also apply to the other.30 A homologous principle, qiyas, is also known as the fourth source of Muslim law adopted if a ruling is not explicitly formulated in one of the other three sources, the Qur an, Hadit, or ijma. Qiyas is a type of inductive reasoning used in Islamic jurisprudence to infer the unknown from the known (qiyas al-gaib 'ala l-sahid).3' In other words, qiyas is a con elusion by analogy, based on the existence of an essential common feature in the original and in the parallel case.32 In Judeo-Arabic literature the term qiyas is used as a translation of the rabbinic term היקש. Saadiah presents such a principle in the ninth category in his introduction to the Book of Proverbs. He explains that sometimes the author compares new information with something known for the 28. For the passage and its translation see section F of the appendix. 29. With regard to biblical exegesis, the research for this article was limited to Yefet's commen tary only. Further studies on this topic should include the examination of the principle of logical infer ence in the works of other Karaite exegetes. It would have been valuable to compare Yefet's biblical commentaries with his halakhah as reflected in his Book of Precepts. However, in addition to the fact that very little research was done to date on Yefet's Book of Precepts, unfortunately, the extant seg ments of this treatise do not include discussions that pertain to the topics of this article. 30.

The application of this prin ciple by Karaite authorities was most noticeable in the realm of family law and the interpretation of laws of consanguinity. In his Book of Precepts 1Anan writes: ...and also anyone who weds a woman must wed her out of his own will. His father must not marry him off to a woman he does not desire. A woman too, must not be wedded unless she so wills, her father must not marry her off to a man she does not desire.37 'Anan's ruling was adopted by the Karaites in subsequent generations as Geniza Karaite marriage documents confirm. While both Rabbanite and Karaite marriage documents found in the Geniza include a passage in which the groom expresses his agreement to marry the bride, Karaite marriage documents also include a parallel passage in which the bride expresses her agreement to marry the groom. This passage, formulated in an egalitarian language, highlights the mutuality in marriage as it presents the wife as an equal partner.38 With regard to divorce 'Anan says: ואלתאסע אצאפה שי יקצד אעלאמנא איאה אלי שי הו משהור ענדהא ללתסויה בינהמא .33 "and the ninth is the addition of something he wishes to teach us to something known to us in order to compare them." Saadiah, Mishle, 20-21. 34. The three sources for Karaite Halakhah are Scripture (an-nuss), logical inference (a I qiyas) and consensus (al-ijma). Qirqisam, Kitab al-Anwar wal- Marakib, vol. 2, ed.

His ruling con cerning divorce has no support in the Bible, nor does it have a precedent in rab binic halakhah 40 It is reasonable to assume that he reaches his conclusion based on the application of the principle of qiyas. Just as it is the right of a man to divorce his wife, so too it is the right of a woman to demand a divorce according to her will. Such an egalitarian approach is attested already in the writings of the Qumran community.41 Benjamin al-NahawandT limited the right of a woman to demand divorce only to cases in which she was deprived of "food," "clothing,יי or "conjugal rights" (Exodus 21:10). However, he was the first to suggest the use of coercion in order to extricate a bill of divorce from the husband, stating that a man who refuses to support his wife "must be coerced to divorce with a com plete get."42 Benjamin does not disclose his source, but the Karaites explain his ruling as based on the application of qiyas to the biblical law according to which a man who rapes an unmarried woman is compelled to marry her (1969): 29-55; and idem, "Divorce Upon the Wife's Demand as Reflected in Manuscripts from the Cairo Geniza," JLA 4 (1981):103-26.

The Kar aites' reform of divorce laws went even further when Levi ben Yefet decreed that in some cases a divorce may be granted to a woman who demands it even without a divorce bill.44 Similar to 'Anan, Levi ben Yefet applies the principle of qiyas and equates between men and women saying "just as it is permissible for him to divorce her, so too it is permissible for her to divorce him."45 In the Jewish law of the Mishnah there is no allowance for the wife to give a bill of divorce to her husband. A man can be coerced to grant a divorce, according to this early law, under certain circumstances such as binding the wife by unrea sonable restrictions or in cases of serious afflictions.46 The debate in the Mishnah concerning grounds for divorce demonstrates that over time the right to divorce became the almost total, unlimited, and exclusive right of the husband.47 However, a parallel ancient tradition does recognize the wife's right to demand the termination of the marriage. A clause fashioned after the Palestinian Talmud and found in Palestinian marriage documents allows both partners to dissolve the marriage, stating "If he hates her.... If she hates him...." followed by a binding monetary stipulation48 Geniza documents demonstrate that in some cases Jewish courts ordered a husband to grant his wife a bill of divorce upon 43.

However, the Karaite sage Aaron ben Elijah holds in his treatise Gan Eden that Levi ben Yefet did, in fact, legitimize divorce without a divorce bill under certain circumstances, such as the rape of the wife or her engagement in prostitution: ובן יפת אומר כיון שנאסרה עליו אינה צריכה גט.

Such a procedure was termed by the Jewish court ihtila49 Levi ben Yefet's adjudication, which sanctions court granted divorce, marks a significant breakthrough towards egalitarian divorce procedures. Changes in the Karaite divorce laws took place even after Levi ben Yefet's decree. The twelfth century Karaite sage, Judah Hadassi, author of Eshkol ha-kofer, restricted women's right to initiate divorce even beyond the circumstances in which the Mishnah allows the coercion of the husband.50 However, the fourteenth century sage, Aaron ben Elijah, reinstated Levi ben Yefet's ruling asserting that "a man divorces willingly and against his will, and so too a woman gets divorced willingly and against her will."51 The fifteenth-century sage, Eliyahu Bashyachi, who was known for his leniency, legitimized court decreed divorce in place of coercion of the husband. By this adjudication, motivated by the principle of qiyas, Bashyachi elevated the legal status of women and granted them equal rights for divorce.52 Karaite laws of divorce were a subject of debate in the Karaite courts again at the end of the eighteen century in Crimea. In the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Karaite sage Isaac ben Shlomo legitimized court-sanctioned divorce without get. His adjudication spread through all Karaite communities including Egypt and it is still a common practice today among all Karaites to prefer court sanctioned divorce to coercion.53 Lastly, it is important to mention that early Karaite sages debated the rights of women with regard to inheritance laws. In light of the principle of qiyas, some of them suggested far-reaching egalitarian reforms. Anan argued that both the son 49.

It is hard not to see in this a most humiliating outlook of the ancient oriental man towards women. However, the Karaite sages set a limit on the volition of the husband in that they prohibited renouncing of marriage without the involvement of the court. They defined the concept of get in dictates that are based on common sense and on principles of uprightness.

Other Karaites agreed with the tradition, accepted also by the Rabbanites, that as long as there are sons, daughters have no share in the inheritance of their fathers.56 Yet, some Karaites accepted this tradition only with regard to landholding within the land of Israel, but dismissed it with regard to landholding outside the land of Israel and with regard to other posses sions. According to Hadassi, both Daniel al-QumisI and Benjamin al-Nahawandl were of the opinion that daughters inherit from their fathers only in the absence of sons.57 Bashyachi, who was regarded as the last legislator among the Karaites, adopted the position that daughters should receive one-third of their fathers estate.58 It is somewhat ironic that by their effort to change inheritance laws in 54.

Louis Ginzberg published two Geniza fragments of Karaite origin (51 and 52), which he suggests were authored by Daniel al-Qumisl The opinion expressed in the first fragment (51) is that sons have priority over the inheritance of landholdings in the land of Israel, but with regard to all other land and possessions daughters and sons inherit equal shares. The second fragment (52) includes a discussion of inheritance laws between husband and wife. According to this fragment, when a wife dies her property goes back to her father's family, unlike Rabbanite halakhah, which claims that the husband inherits the wife. (Ginzberg, Genizah Studies, 470-74). Ginzberg's identification of al-Qumisl as the author of fragment 51 is tenuous as it conflicts with Hadassi's account. In addition, Jacob Mann is at odds with Ginzberg's position and challenges the latter's identi fication, classification and analysis of several fragments in his collection. Mann agrees with Ginzberg that fragment 52 was authored by al-Qumisl, but disputes Ginzberg's interpretation of the fragment. See Jacob Mann, "Genizah Studies," AJSLL 46 (1930): 270-75. Whether these fragments were indeed authored by Daniel al-Qumisl or not, the opinions expressed in them reflect a spirit of egalitarianism and a humanitarian approach to inheritance laws.

Bava Kamma 15a). It is surprising that Yefet does not share these opinions. In his commentary on Numbers 27:7-11 he rejects the opinion that daughters inherit together with sons. He therefore also refutes the opinion that sons receive two-thirds and daugh ters receive one-third of the inheritance. In addition, he opposes the notion that these laws of inheritance pertain only to the land of Israel.59 According to Yefet, sons receive everything, and only in the absence of sons do daughters receive the inheritance of the father. This includes land and all other possessions. Yefet adds, that after the death of their fathers, unmarried females must be taken care of by their brothers. He asserts that brothers must allocate gifts from the inheritance, which must be dedicated to the livelihood of their unmarried sisters. The size of the gift is a variable to be determined by the means of the family and its particular circumstances. Yefet's stand on the laws of inheritance is not different from that of the Rabbanites of his time. Influence of Islam60 It is possible that the Karaites' recognition of the right of women to initiate a divorce was not driven only from the principle of qiyas. It is reasonable to assume that they were also influenced by Qur anic text and Islamic law. There are numer ous verses in the Qur'an which advocate the equality between genders. Both men and women are addressed in the same manner with regard to their spiritual path and religious obligations.61 The Quran affirms the right of women to own prop erty and entitles them to earnings. Women are free, according to the Qur an, to most of the sages did not permit any inheritance for daughters at all. However, they required the sons to sponsor the marriage of daughters according to their means even if it drained the resources of the sons and they were right. However, in our times, with lack of legislative authority, sons do not treat their sisters according to this custom; instead, they let them panhandle. Therefore, the right thing, in my opinion, is to bequeath daughters one third so that they may get married or use it for their livelihood. This is in accordance with the opinion of some sages, as reported by our Rabbi David the Nasi, includ ing the sage R. Joseph, who decreed that the share of daughters be equal to that of sons" (Bashyachi, Aderet,Aderet, 272). 59. SP AOS B365 (102a-b), courtesy of David Sklare.

Eve is not said to be made of Adam's rib, which might point to her secondary and inferior status.63 Evi dence from the Hadit further illustrates that women were entitled to an egalitarian position in society. There are accounts of women who worked for a living, women warriors who participated in battle alongside their male coequals, and women who took part in business and government positions. In the Abbasid period women par ticipated in public life and held positions of influence and prominence.64 Islamic law allowed women to claim a divorce. A common procedure in Islamic law was the hut, also known as ihtila in the Quran (2:229), which enabled women to initiate legally binding divorce agreements with their husbands. In the case of hul' the husband would agree to restore the wife's freedom on con dition that she forfeits all or most of the property she had received from him. Such an agreement is allowed on the condition that the financial arrangement is mutually acceptable.65 This procedure is distinguished from the more common type of divorce, known as talaq, which is granted as a unilateral privilege of the husband to divorce his wife.66 In certain cases Islamic law allowed for yet another type of divorce, fash. This was a court-sanctioned divorce, which was granted to women abandoned by their husbands for more than six months without means of support or income.67 With regard to the laws of inheritance, the arrival of Islam ushers in radical changes in customs and rules. While in the pre-Islamic era only men were eligible to inherit their father's wealth, the Quran instructs that both male and female are entitled to a share in the inheritance. The new order unfolds in stages in the Qur'an in response to particular circumstances. According to the Quran, in the event of death of the parents, daughters receive half the share of sons.68 It is evident from the above survey of Quranic passages and Islamic law that there is affinity between the reforms of Karaite sages towards gender equality and 62.

Conclusion This paper examnined Yefet's propensity for gender equality in his commen taries on wisdom literature and biblical narrative. Yefet's commitment to egalitar ian ideology is reflected in his discussions of topics such as marriage, parental roles, honor, faith, accountability, leadership and even authorship of biblical pas sages. His work also bespeaks an inclination to egalitarianism in his understanding of the rules that govern the Hebrew language. Yefet was guided by the principle of qiyasqiyas and often applied it consciously in his commentaries. It was his commitment to the principle of qiyas which resulted in a worldview and ideology of egalitarian ism and gender equality, and distinguished him from other contemporaneous com mentators and those who lived before and after his time. While Yefet's commitment to gender equality and the principle of qiyas is undeniable, his com mentary reflects an inner tension that manifests itself in occasional misogynistic statements on women. This same egalitarian ideology, which was embraced by Karaite sages, was not confined to the realm of biblical commentary but had a significant influence on Karaite halakhic reforms. A similar proclivity is evident in the Qur'an, the Had.it, and medieval Islamic law and can be regarded as inspirational for the reforms suggested by Karaite legislators. While distinct from the spirit of feminism of modern times, Karaite egalitarianism reveals a heightened sense of social justice and a humanistic worldview. Concerned with women's rights, Karaite sages dared to take a stand and make a difference, as is evident with regard to divorce laws and to a certain degree also with regard to inheritance laws. liana Sasson Tel Aviv University Tel Aviv, Israel 69</page><page sequence="20">liana liana Sasson Appendix A Proverbs 18:22-19:2, BL Or. 2553 (76b-78a) (22) ماصا اشاماصاطوب ؤيافق راصؤن ْداذونايأ من وجد امراه موافقة فقد وجد الخير واخرج الرضا من عند اس قال ماصا اشا ليعرف انه يجب على الأسان ان يطلب من يصلح له لدينه ودنياه لأن امور الرجل لدينه ودنياه معتقة بالزوجة فسبيله ان يبحث عن حالهاقبل ان ياخدهافاذا وصل الى مراده فقئ حصل له الخير قال ماصاطوب نظير قوله لوا طوب هيوث هادام ليدووه فاذا تزوج باشث حائل حصل له الطوب وهو طوب لتدين والدنيا وقال ؤيافق راصؤن مياذوناي لأنها اذا كانت موافقة ل...الآلإ على رضا الرم وبضد ذلك الزوجة الردية تضر به في امور دينه ودنياه وسخط اه عليه مهما هي في بيته فسبيله ان يبادر الى الخلاص منهافهوفوق كل عرواث دابار:71 (23) تاحنونيم يدبر راش وعاشير ياعنا عزوث; بالتحننات يتكلم الفقير والمومر يتكلم بالصعوبات ظاهر هدا القول ان الفقير اذا احتاج الى الموسر فسبيله ان يلطف به ويضرع اتيه حتى يصل الى مراده منه وان حرج طيه الموسر بالكلام واسحق به فسبيله هو ان لا يغير حاله في الملطف بل يزيد في التدلل اليه لأن الموسر غنى عنه وهو محتاج اليه فيحتمل جميع ما جرى عتيه وفي نظامه معنى وهو انه سبيل الرجل ان يتزوج بزوجة تقاربه في احواله فيطيب عيشهما جميعا لأنه اذا كان احدهما موسرا كان الأحر ذليلا مهانا لأن اليسار يكبر القتب وقليل من الناس من يكون يعكس دلك ويجب ان يكون الزوج والزرجة قريبين في اربعة اشيا احدها في الحسب والنسب والثاني في الفقر والغنى والثالث في المن والرابع في الصورة فمتى جرت الأمور على مثل ذلك طاب العيس واذا لم تجري الأمور كذاك تنكد العيش وتمرمرت الروح وهده امور واضحة (24) ايش ريعم لهثرومع ؤييثى اوهيب دابيق مباح: رجل ذو رفثا نلمرافقة و موجود محب ملازم اكرس الأخ هدا الفسوق مقول في رجل يفكر فيما يلحقه من الامراة فيقول في نفسه لما اخذ امراة ما اخبر حالها في دينها وادبهأ وعقلها وبزالتها فاحصل في بلا ما اجل حلاص منه فالاصلمح لي ان اتحد رفيق يكون لي لوقت شدة وانا اعرف حاله احب الي من امر مغطا مستور فقال له الحكيم اظم انه من اتحد له رفيق لمهماته وامبابه فهو ادا يطلب رفيق بحيث انه عمر ان يجد رفيق كْا يحب فانه ربما كان زرفيءق يلازم الأسان اكثر من الأخ في حيره وشره ولا يفارقه بل يشاركه في جميع احواله قانت ايصا اذا كنت لا تريد ان تخاطر في زيجة امراة حوما من ان لا تجد كما تحب فهدا ايضا يلحقك في الرفيق والصديق فعرف ان اتخاذ الزوجة اصلح اذ تصلح لاشيا لا يصلح لها الصديق (19:1) طوب راش هوليخ شو سميس سفاثاو وهو مسيل; الأجود الفقير الماير بصحته صن دسكدرا سفيله وظو جاهل هدا الفسوق وان كان قولا عاما فانه له تعتق في النظام في باب الزوج مع زوجته فكانه قال لكل واحد منهما اذا طلبت نظيرك ولم تجد في باب الدين والدنيا فاتحي الفقير الدبين ولا ترغب الى موسر سكس جاهل فيلقالتآُ بما يثقل عليك وتضطرب عليك احوانك لجهله وقد قلنا لك لبخ مناغي لايش كسيلقلإ فابعد عنه ولا تصاحبه فكيف ان تكون تك زوجة بهذه الصورة او رجل بهذه الصورة لامراة عاقلة مثل نابال هاكرملى وابيغايل الذي وصفهما وهاشا طوبث ساحل ويفث توارمجآء وتمامه (2) حام بلوا ذاعث نافش لوا طوب واص برغلايم حوطي; ايصا بغير معرفة النسا للشهوة ليس جيد والملح في الميعة جاني على نفسه هذه الداعث هي معرفة الميعة مثل وهاذام ياذاع اث حوا اشتووت وقال حام مضاف الى ما ينتفع الرجل من الامراه بخدمتها وغير ذلك فقال انه اذا بقي الأسان بغير مرة هو ضرر على الجسم لأنه 69.

He says "he who finds a suitable wife" in order to assert that it is the obli gation of every person to search for the one who is appropriate for him with regard to both his spiritual and worldly life. For a man's religious and worldly affairs depend upon his wife. It is therefore the obligation of a man to examine her back ground before he marries her, and once he finds what he wants he will obtain goodness. His (i.e., the author) saying "obtains favor" is similar to "it is not good for man to be alone" (Genesis 2:18). For, when one marries esheteshet hayilhayil (a woman of good judgment) he obtains tob (favor) which is tob (good) both from spiritual and worldly points of view. He says "he obtains favor from the Lord" for when she is an appropriate [...] finds favor from the Lord. On the other hand, an evil wife will harm him both in religious and worldly matters and the Lord will be angry with him as long as she is in his house. In such a case, he ought to save himself from her at once, for it is above and beyond (the case of) "something obnoxious" (Deuteronomy 24:1). (23) "The poor person speaks by pleading, but the rich one speaks harshly." The literal meaning of this saying is that when a poor person seeks favor from a rich one the former approaches the latter gently and submissively until he obtains that which he wants. Even if the rich one charges at him and denigrates him, he (i.e., the poor one) does not change his gentle behavior but rather, he increases his submission. For the rich one does not need the poor, but the poor one needs the rich and must endure everything that befalls him. The context provides a meaning as well: It is necessary for a man to many a wife who's circumstances resemble his in order for them to have a good life together. For if one of them is rich the other is bound to be humiliated and inferior, as wealth swells the heart and very few people can resist that. Therefore, it is necessary for the husband and wife to resemble each other in four manners. The first is the social and ancestral status. The second pertains to poverty and wealth, the third pertains to age (lit: years) and the fourth has to do with external look (lit: form). When events run their course accordingly life is good, but if not, life is miserable and the spirit is bitter, and these things are obvious. (24) "A man of friends keeps friendship, and there is one who loves and adheres more than a brother." This verse pertains to a man who is concerned with what will happen to him by (marrying) a wife. He says to himself: "Why should I marry a wife whose affairs, piety, education, intelligence and efficiency I do not know. I might bring upon myself harm from which I will not be delivered. It is best 76. Ezekiel 16:25. 71</page><page sequence="22">liana liana Sasson for me to acquire a friend who will be there for me in times of difficulties and whose circumstances I know. (Such a friend) is dearer to me more than some thing hidden and unknown." To him says the wise one (i.e., Solomon): "Know that the one who looks for a friend with whom to share his concerns and affairs will always be in need for a friend, for it will always be difficult for him to find one to his liking. Yet there may be a friend who sticks to a person more than a brother, in good times and in bad, one who will not separate from him but rather share in all his affairs. Therefore, you too, if you do not wish to risk marrying a wife out of fear that you will not find the right one; the same will happen to you with a friend and an acquaintance. So he (i.e., the author) explains that taking a wife is better, for she is suitable (for you) in matters for which a friend cannot be suitable." (19:1) "Better the poor walking in integrity than one stubborn of lips who is a fool." Although this verse seems like a general statement it is related contextually to the subject of husband and wife, ft is as if he (the author) says to each one of them: "When you look for one like you but you do not find [one who is like you] both spiritually and materially, than you should marry the poor one who is pious. Wish not for the rich one who is stubborn and ignorant, for that one will belittle (?) that which troubles you, and will confuse your affairs as a result of his ignorance. We have already said to you "Walk away from a foolish person" (Proverbs 14:7), therefore keep away from him (the ignorant one) and do not befriend him. It will not be possible, then, for you to have such an [ignorant] wife, nor [will it be possible] for an intelligent wife to have such an [ignorant] husband, like [the case of] Nabal the Carmelite and Abigail, who was described as "The woman was clever and beautiful" (1 Samuel 25:3) etc." (2) "Also not knowing women sexually is not good, but the one who is intensely engaged in sexual acts sins against himself." This knowing is carnal knowledge like "Now the man knew his wife Eve" (Genesis 4:1). He (the author) says "Also" [to indicate that this is] in addition to the benefit a man gains from a wife's [other] services, etc. He says that when a man remains without a wife he harms his body for he brings upon himself disease. Satisfying the sexual drive and desire brings benefits physicians have spoken of, and they are true. When it takes place in moderation the benefit is obvious. However, when it exceeds the limits the body is destroyed because it is drained of its strength as his saying "but the one who is intensely engaged in sexual acts sins against himself."77 The meaning of his saying "legs" is carnal knowledge like "spread your legs to every passerby" (Ezekiel 16:25). This "sinner" sins against himself and ruins his body, for if he did not exaggerate in this matter straining himself he would have gained benefit not harm.

Translation Anyone, who opines that daughters inherit even when there are sons, holds to an unfounded opinion. Even more so the one who opines that sons receive two thirds and daughters one third of the inheritance. For none of this is written in the Torah.... The phrase את נחלתו ("his portion") is general and (includes) everything the deceased owned, whether hard cash, furniture, servants, or anything else in his possession. For we have seen that the semantic sphere of נחלה includes servants from the saying "you shall keep them as a possession" (Leviticus 25:46), and houses and wealth from the saying "house and wealth are inherited from parents" (Proverbs 19:14). See also the verse "then on the day he wills his posses sions to his sons5' (Deuteronomy 21:16). Therefore, the one who says ("his portion") is specific to the land of Israel declares an unfounded claim.... As we have not found any evidence that it is specific to the land of Israel and excludes the inheritance of (other) possessions; not in Scripture (nuss al-kitab), not by means of proper (application of) logical inference (qiyas), and not by the consen sus (ijma). In addition, it is well known that the Rabbanites have used this chapter to draw all laws of inheritance. For even if there were a consensus that there was a (separate) chapter dealing with the inheritance of (other) possessions, which is an immense topic, God has not included it in His Book. 82.
