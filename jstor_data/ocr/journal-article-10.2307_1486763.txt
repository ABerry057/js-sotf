<plain_text><page sequence="1">Marsha C. White. The Elijah Legends and Jehu 's Coup. Brown Judaica Series 311. Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1997. vi, 116 pp. The book at hand is a revision of a 1994 Harvard dissertation directed by Peter Machinist. This, plus its publication under the aegis of the Brown Judaica Series, guarantees that it is a high-quality piece of work, as indeed it is: well researched, meticulously argued, clearly written. Dr. White is very straightforward about her thesis: "The purpose of this study is to dispute the notion that there was a mid-ninth century prophetic 'revolution' linked with the Jehu-led 'revolt' against the 'oppressive' house of Omri, implying a broad popular base for the 'revolt' " (p. 1). I would judge that she is largely successful in sustaining this primary thesis. It would be unfortunate if well-taken skepticism about some of her subtheses undercut this central conclusion. The campaign is mounted on two fronts. Part I seeks to demonstrate through literary analysis that the Elijah traditions are almost entirely derivative</page><page sequence="2">368 BOOK REVIEWS of traditions about Moses, Elisha, Nathan, and Jehu, the apologetic handiwork of scribes in the pay of the Jehu dynasty. This "Quest for the Historical Elijah," a tour de force worthy of the Jesus seminar, leaves only the charismatic rainmaker of the drought story as an original figure, and Elisha is, after all these centuries, delivered from the shadow of his putative master. Part II is a historical essay, arguing that Jehu's revolt was a military coup, not a popular movement led by a prophetic party. In the process, White substantially rehabilitates Jezebel and the Omride dynasty, and shows that the penetration of Israelite society by Tyrian Baalism was much less than some had supposed. The author provides a valuable appendix (pp. 79-93) containing her translation, with textual notes, of the Elijah passages that she attributes to "Jehuite historians." She omits what she regards as deuteronomistic expansions. Thus one has ready to hand the textual evidence on which some of her arguments are based, in the form that underlies the argument. One notes a preference for Septuagint and Lucianic readings when she departs from the Masoretic text, but there is also appeal to the Targum, Syriac, Vulgate, and so on. "Minimalists" will probably not be amused to see texts attributed to the ninth century that are allegedly based on even earlier material. The second section of the book is, in my judgment, the more persuasive. Jehu's rebellion was almost certainly a military coup. Successful popular revolutionary movements directed against well-entrenched governments in antiquity (with or without prophetic support) are largely the product of romantic imagination. I noted some years ago a tendency of biblical historians to overemphasize popular assent. The coups, revolutions, and counter-coups in ancient Israel/Judah were either palace revolutions or coups d'etat brought off by recognized notables (a class that would have included prominent prophets), members of the professional military, or some combination thereof. The nature of military technology prior to the wide dissemination of simple, reliable firearms in the eighteenth century c.E. gave trained professional soldiers an almost insurmountable advantage over the masses except in guerilla actions.' White marshals both the documented traditions of other "overthrows" and the precise language applied to Jehu's actions in support of her thesis. She notes the wholesale exterminations that accompanied dynastic rebellions. As one of my anthropologist colleagues once said, "The usual 1.

It helps prevent recidivism. White's view that only the servitors of the Tyrian Baal cult were ex- terminated by Jehu, and not ordinary Israelites, is also the most probable understanding of 2 Kings 10:18-28. The victims of the slaughter were inside the house of Baal, the provenance of the servitors, not of ordinary worshippers. This tells in favor of her contention that the Tyrian Baal cult had not significantly penetrated Israelite society. This is not to say that there were no cultic practices in ninth-century Israel that might have offended a simon-pure deuteronomist! Less compelling is the attempted rehabilitation of Jezebel (pp. 65-75). The historical reconstruction is strained and largely conjectural, often appealing to dubious parallels. White correctly notes that the queen mother was an officer of state in the Judean royal polity. There is no documentary evidence for such an office in the Northern Kingdom. The lack of dynastic continuity in the north could mean that various customs were followed. The point is, we don't know, and conjecturing that the sources are deficient does not fill the gap. I am also unconvinced that the evil foreign wife was a figure of preexilic Israelite lore. None of White's examples are lodged in the age of the Israelite state(s), and one (Potiphar's wife!) isn't even married to an Israelite. The small, threatened postexilic community was justifiably anxious about unassimilated foreign wives. Exogamy-angst does not seem to have afflicted earlier generations. The deuteronomic code even provided for "naturalizing" the captive "war bride" (21:10-14; cf. Num 31:18). The erotic histories of Tamar, Rahab, Jael(?), and Ruth do not detract from their positive images in the traditions. Nor is it easy to conceive the "illegitimate female ruler" as a standard literary type. Athaliah is the only documented example; Jezebel's regency is merely posited. The first section of the book attempts to draw a series of literary parallels between the Elijah traditions and those about Moses, Nathan, Elisha, and Jehu. The Elijah tales are alleged to be derivative and framed to justify Jehu's coup in the face of a series of challenges (cf. p. 33). The putative parallels seem as strained as some of the historical parallels of Part II. Is the Elijah of the flight-to-Horeb story a "second Moses" or a "second-rate" Moses, an object of satire? Does Moses' unknown tomb inspire Elijah's apotheosis, or is the direction of influence from Enoch and Elijah to the late postexilic Assumption of Moses? Even with Nathan's parable as middle term, it requires a leap of the imagination to get from the David-Bathsheba-Uriah</page><page sequence="4">370 BOOK REVIEWS story to Naboth's vineyard. And so on. But so much of literary criticism is in the eye--or mind--of the beholder that I hesitate to pile up examples. The book is an interesting and entertaining read. But it also suggests that every scholarly generation should be exposed to the late Professor Samuel Sandmel's cautionary address, "Parallelomania."2 Christian E.
