Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006. 304 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001359 In this dense and challenging book, Leora Batnitzky iconoclastically makes Leo Strauss, widely perceived to be an atheistic proponent of classical rationalism, a proponent of revelation, and Emmanuel Levinas, who favors metaphysics and noncognitive desire over ontology and knowledge, a proponent of reason and phi losophy. In addition, she charges Levinas with engaging in a characteristically modern project, one much critiqued by Strauss and other critics of the excess opti mism of early modern thought?the project of applying philosophy to politics? and maintains that he unintentionally bases this project and his work as a whole on a modern, Cartesian view of the self. By contrast, she admires Strauss for creating an opening between rationalists and believers in revelation by pointing out that rationalism cannot disprove the possibility of revelation, and she appreciates the fact that Strauss, unlike Levinas, keeps reason and revelation strictly separate, thus clarifying and making possible the task of peacefully or fruitfully coordinat ing them. We owe Batnitzky a debt for opening up the topic of similarities and differ ences in the work of Strauss and Levinas. Each thinker, influenced by Martin Hei degger and affected by the events of the Nazi era, is centrally preoccupied with the relation between what is variously described as Athens and Jerusalem, Greek and Hebrew, philosophy and Judaism. As Batnitzky rightly points out, it is easy to overlook this shared central concern if we only see the two thinkers through a lens in which Strauss appears as a political philosopher for whom revelation is at most instrumentally important and Levinas appears as a Jewish thinker. This lens limits our view because both philosophers, as Batnitzky correctly points out, believe and think it is important that revelation is philosophically possible. In addition, neither, she claims, wants to harmonize the two?Athens and Jerusa lem, philosophy and Judaism?although for different reasons: Strauss because he sees an irrevocable tension between them, Levinas because he sees them as "fun damentally alike" or "in fundamental harmony" (5) or, in her most extreme formu lation, because he thinks they "ultimately mean the same thing" (6). The identification of Athens and Jerusalem makes Levinas's Cartesian tendency to apply philosophy to politics even worse because it becomes in effect the appli cation of religion to politics. Batnitzky's account of Levinas's understanding of the relation between Athens and Jerusalem, Greek and Hebrew is not without problems. Do we really want to claim that, for Levinas, the two are fundamentally alike or that they ultimately mean the same thing? Batnitzky's argument that they do depends, for example, on Levinas's claim that every philosophical thought rests on pre-philosophical experiences with which Judaism is associated. But what does he mean by that claim? Not that philosophy and Judaism are the same, but that philosophy is indebted to something else that is quite different, a fundamental, pre- and noncognitive openness to the other whose 432</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews presence to me, or revelation, shockingly breaks open the closed circle of my reason. Her argument rests, in addition, on the fact that, according to Levinas, both philosophy and Judaism discuss a good beyond being that is embodied in responsibility. But Levinas maintains that only a handful of philosophers, Plato central among them, discuss the good beyond being. In saying that philosophy can include both Greek and Hebrew, Levinas's point is not to make the two the same but to delineate a new type of philosophy, presaged by Plato's, that will centrally include both. Its task will be to speak and then to reduce the said to the saying?to a continual resaying that keeps what is said from idolatrous fixity or congealment. Such reduction is the task of philosophy according to Levinas. Philosophy understood this way is not the type that concerns critics of Cartesian application of theoretical reason to political life but is a type specifically designed to meet such concerns. In this respect, Levinas and Strauss are not opposed, as Batnitzky maintains, but similar because each seeks to put limits on the application of theoretical reason to political life. As Batnitzky's interpretation construes Levinas on an overly rationalistic model, so she seems too quickly to assume a revelation model for Strauss. For example, through much of the book, she characterizes Strauss's critique of theor etical reason as a critique of reason or philosophy per se. She supports this charac terization by, for example, quoting Strauss's claim that philosophy is better at raising questions than solving them so that there is an opening for Judaism or rev elation instead to give answers. Without revelation, too, there is no ground for the claim that all men are created equal. The ground must come from the Shema, love of God, and love of neighbor in the Bible. Much of Strauss's argument for limitations of reason in the political sphere, though, is based on his higher estimation not of revelation but of practical reason {phron?sis or practical wisdom). Late in the book, Batnitzky herself quotes Strauss's approving discussion of Aristotle's view that "human action has principles of its own which are known independently of theoretical science," that therefore "the practical sciences do not depend on the theoretical sciences or are not derivative from them," and that we have some awareness of these principles and so can become practically wise.x Though Batnitzky quotes this passage, she does not draw the implications of it, namely, that often the target of Strauss's critique is not reason per se but theoretical reason so that Strauss could remain a proponent not of revelation but of classical rationalism, the interpretation of Strauss that Batnitzky's book aims to reject. The result is disquieting, though, because it leaves us with a Strauss who sup ports democracy not on the basis of the claim that all men are created equal or some equivalent affirmation of all peoples, as only religion could make such a proclama tion, but, Batnitzky plausibly argues, only on the recognition that no individual or group alone has access to final truth. This is a good classically rational principle? in deliberation, for Aristotle, the whole is more than the sum of its parts?but it is not sufficient ground for some kind of genuine universal human regard within politi cal society, a subject of central concern for both Strauss and Levinas after the Nazi era. 1.

The central appeal of Levinas's philosophical writings is just this: his effort to find, without appealing to revealed religious text, a principle of human regard that does not derive from a principle of equality but from the other who escapes categories, his effort, in other words, to delineate what Hent de Vries calls a minimal theology. One strong argument stands in the way of accepting this appeal, namely, Batnitzky's argument that Levinas's views rest on a problematically Cartesian view of the self. But do they? Does Levinas affirm the "modern and specifically Cartesian view of a separate and separable human subject"? And so is his project "nothing short of a defense of the modern philosophical project after Heidegger"? (28). Is Batnitzky right that it is "the self's sense of itself as a separable, indepen dent self that is the core philosophical argument of Totality and Infinity" (35)? The answer, clearly, is no because the self which, for Levinas, comes into existence through an event of resistance to the totality is developed in stages of which the separate self is only the first and involves the overestimation of the self's indepen dence. The second stage is the social stage on which the self recognizes its deter mination by the other. The result of the self's two-stage emergence out of the totality is the development of a self uniquely described by Levinas as essentially connected to its contents while at the same time remaining separate from them. A main point of this description of the self is to remain satisfied neither with a Hei deggerian nor with a Cartesian self and to include elements of both, the self that is in the world and the self that retains its own identity. Levinas expresses this idea in several ways, for example, that I exist by both enjoying and at the same time remaining at a distance from the other (116) or that life continually and essentially becomes its own contents while nonetheless remaining distinct from them (122). For Levinas, in other words, I exist only because I enjoy the other, while, at the same time, I remain I and the other remains other. This, not a simple Cartesianism, is Levinas's central metaphysical idea. Leora Batnitzky's Leo Strauss and Emmanuel Levinas is a feat of virtuosity, fiill of ideas, arguments, and references that stimulate one's thinking on the place of Strauss and Levinas in twentieth-century thought. On the question of what Athens has to do with Jerusalem, though, the book is more stimulating than defini tive, for, if the argument of this review is correct, a revised version of the standard interpretation of the two thinkers is plausible, an interpretation that holds Strauss to be a proponent of classic rationalism though he is cognizant of the possible truth of revelation and Levinas a proponent of a type of revelation, specifically, one that takes place within and continually breaks open and expands philosophy.
