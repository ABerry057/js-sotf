Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004. 392 pp. The last third of the twentieth century witnessed a renewed interest in the rab binic movement and the society in which the sages lived. This interest was largely prompted by archaeological discoveries, which included both literary and material finds; new, more critical approaches to the study of rabbinic literature; and a corre sponding burgeoning of inquiries into early Christianity and its relationship to Judaism. With the arrival of the twenty-first century, a good number of new assess ments began to appear, some still clinging to an understanding of Roman Palestine that incorporated the rabbis but without making the sages (including the patriarch ate) the centerpiece of Jewish life, and others, more daringly, suggesting that rabbi nic Judaism may have been bom after 70 CE but hardly amounted to anything meaningful or well defined, let alone influential or successful, until much later? subsequent to the Christianization of the Roman Empire, to be precise. The three works considered here are major contributions to this discussion.1 That of Nicole Belayche, Iudaea-Palaestina: The Pagan Cults in Roman Palestine (Second to Fourth Century), assesses the rich material evidence and especially addresses the non-Jewish context within which Jews lived. Indeed, it is the 1.

Miller Roman province that she wishes to describe, albeit with due attention to the min ority monotheistic communities. Seth Schwartz, in Imperialism and Jewish Society: 200 B.C.E. to 640 CE., draws largely on Jewish and non-Jewish literary works and summons the material finds (or lack thereof) in order to support his understanding and reconstruction of society in Roman Palestine. Daniel Boyarin's Border Lines: The Partition of Judaeo-Christianity draws entirely on literary evi dence and is devoted to parallel or seemingly intersecting themes in rabbinic and Christian writings. Schwartz's and Boyarin's efforts represent the more revisionist approach just described. In fact, Boyarin's understanding of the "partition" he wishes to describe is indebted, as we shall see, to Schwartz's earlier effort. Belayche's and Schwartz's books both appeared in 2001, a fact that makes their distinct approaches to the non-Jewish materials interesting. Though neither appears to have been aware of the other's effort, it is precisely the wealth of pagan evidence for Roman Palestine that Belayche marshals that so troubled Schwartz when he wrote his book.2 Boyarin's incisive effort three years later may be pointing to the further entrenchment of the revisionist view of rabbinic society and rabbinic Judaism. But is this direction leading us to a more profound and, more importantly, better informed assessment of the emergence of rabbinic Judaism, and therefore of Judaism as we know it? Before answering this question, we need to take a closer look at the works themselves and consider the ways in which some of the overlapping questions are addressed. BELAYCHE'S IUDAEA-PALAESTINA In the preface to her book, Nicole Belayche remarks how a visitor to the "Roman room" of the Israel Museum views much that is pagan yet the thrust of the exhibit is the "rehabilitation of Jewish life" in Roman Palaestina. Belayche, like Schwartz, is acutely aware that the onetime "land of the Bible" and province of Judaea was transformed under Roman rule into an "ordinary Roman province." Second- to fourth-century Palestine was in the main no different from any other Roman province. At the same time, Belayche proffers, Palestine was unique because of its distinctive "religious mix," which included the monotheisms of Judaism and Christianity. It is the way in which she grapples with the problematic that this uniqueness poses for the study of Roman Palestine/ Erez Yisra 'el that interests us here. Thus, Belayche speaks of religious "zones" (50) that were "statutorily defined by the Jews and in a more empirical manner by the pagan Romans." 2. Fergus Millar, "Transformations of Judaism under Graeco-Roman Rule: Responses to Seth Schwartz's Imperialism and Jewish Society," Journal of Jewish Studies 57, no. 1 (2006): 139-58, simi larly sees the importance of Belayche's book for a fuller appreciation of Schwartz's effort. Millar's essay only deals with Belayche's work peripherally, however. In some instances, I may be raising points that have been dealt with by others whose reviews are unknown to me. Though this is unavoid able, when appropriate, I do refer to some of the more important reviews with which I am familiar. It should also be noted that my primary concern here is the overlapping and intersecting content of the three works. 330</page><page sequence="3">Roman Imperialism, Jewish Self-Definition, and Rabbinic Society Accordingly, Ezra had long earlier established the official territories of Erez Yisra 'el, to which the ritual obligations of Torah law and halakhah would apply. The sages of the second to fourth centuries adjusted the permitted and forbidden areas in order to ensure the survival of the Jewish settlement in 'Erez Yisra 'el. The regulations of the rabbis were evidently "diffused ... by visible documents" such as the inscription from the Tel Rehov synagogue. The inscription to which Belayche is referring, which includes substantial segments known to us from tan naitic sources and the Talmud Yerushalmi, actually appears in the synagogue on a column and is duplicated in a later mosaic floor belonging to the fifth and sixth centuries, respectively. The relative lateness of these material finds hardly bothers Belayche, who evidently assumes that the inscription is sufficient evidence that the substance of the parallel rabbinic texts was promulgated earlier on in similar fashion. It is precisely this type of assumption that is problematic for Schwartz, as we shall see. In any event, Belayche sees what the rabbis regarded as 'avodah zarah as having spread throughout the country; the sages responded to the proliferation of "foreign rites" by further defining the parameters of the bib lical land to which their halakhah continued to apply. Although Belayche's emphasis is on the pagan presence in Palestine, she is constantly aware of rabbinic allusions and responses to the foreigners in the land. The introduction of two legions into Palestine left its mark on the road system, milestones, and municipal building projects, particularly aqueducts. In a sense, the soldiers were "cultural ambassadors" who not only needed the services of a theater at Legio but also were associated with the type of "foreign rites" that were a potential threat to the rabbis. For example, already in the tannaitic period, the rabbis considered the implications that the entrance of Gentiles into a town would have on purity concerns.3 Belayche also notes the frequent rabbinic attempts to "ostracize [worshippers of] the Merkulis (Mercurius),"4 which she takes as an indication that "the landscape must have been strewn with cairns? rudimentary hermai" (54-56). It is in her assessment of numismatic evidence (38-44) that we see Belayche's circumspection with regard to the extent of pagan influence. She is especially insistent that city coins represent "the political and ideological position of the ruling elite." As such, the coins provide insight into the civic identity of the local elite. Because their imagery and inscriptions draw from a common "repertoire" of themes and forms, they are less instructive where local religious beliefs and rites are concerned.5 Images of temples or the featuring of deities on coins do not necessarily imply a cult and may very well have only rhetorical value. The coinage from Sepphoris took on a decidedly non-Jewish character soon after the city's name was changed to Diocaesarea, but the representation of 3. M. 'Avodah Zarah 5:6. 4. See M. 'Avodah Zarah 4:1; and Y. 'Avodah Zarah 4, 43d. Cf. Peter Sch?fer, "Jews and Gentiles in Yerushalmi Avodah Zarah," in The Talmud Yerushalmi and Graeco-Roman Culture, ed.

Miller the Capitoline triad on a coin from the time of Antoninus Pius was merely a way of expressing "political loyalty" and only indicative of "the political transformation of the city ... the actual construction of a Capitol... is not called for in a city which is not a Roman colony" (89). Names on city coins of "Diospolis," that is, Lydda/Lod from 199/200 CE, place the town under the patronage of Zeus and Severus. Nevertheless, Belayche compares and contrasts these almost formulaic references with the more signifi cant pagan representation on the coinage of Antipatris, a city that had also received its civic status under the Severans. By the same token, the coinage of Caesarea does not accurately reflect the extent of pagan worship associated with this city. The point is that numismatic evidence, though important for understanding the self-perception of an urban elite, is never a sure bet when it comes to identifying the religious proclivities of a city's residents. Even where the thoroughly pagan Gaza is concerned, what we see is the celebration of mythological traditions associated with the city, not necessarily the existence of a particular cult. Thus, for example, associations with Heracles may have left their mark on the city's coins in Hadrian's day, yet there is no cult of Heracles in the fifth-century list of temples preserved by Mark the Deacon.6 Belayche takes a nuanced approach to "paganization," in each case deval uating the evidence on its own terms without arriving at blanket assertions that apply to all of Palestine.7 Her assessment of "Jews and Pagans in the 'Galilee of the goyim,' " first in Sepphoris and then in Tiberias, wrestles with the difficulty of understanding the implications of Romanization. Rather than positing a form of syncretism for the religious character of post-135 CE Sepphoris, Belayche prefers that we see "successful integration without religious acculturation." She follows Arnold H. M. Jones in asserting that Hadrian, in renaming the city "Diocaesarea," reflected his desire to establish a Hellenistic ambiance in Galilee and not an inten tion to paganize the region.8 Although much has been made of some of the pagan "religious" artifacts that have been found at Sepphoris,9 Belayche dismisses these as "everyday cult objects" and statuettes whose significance is uncertain. She includes in these a bronze incense altar and small figurines depicting Pan and Prometheus (86-87). Belayche's points are well taken, even if her interpretation of the "Jewish" evidence from Sepphoris is sometimes problematic. A half-litra weight from the mid-third century appears to be referring to a Jewish market official named Simon son of Aianos. Assuming he is Jewish, we hardly know anything 6. Vita Porphyrii 64, 4-7; and Belayche, Iudaea-Palaestina, 44, 247f. 7. To this end, she provides useful maps of "cities that minted coins," "the religious geography of Judaea and the Decapolis" at the outset of the revolt in 66 CE, "theatres of Roman Palestine," and the distribution of second- to fourth-century synagogues. These maps are essential for gaining an appreci ation of the Jewish areas of settlement, even if one can quibble with Belayche's assumptions about the dating of synagogues. Cf. Millar, "Transformations," 145. 8. Cf. Arnold H. M. Jones, The Cities of the Eastern Roman Provinces (Oxford: Oxford Uni versity, 1971), 278. 9.

The mikva'ot, assuming that they are indeed ritual baths, found in the area of the cardo (and, for that matter, those on the western summit) point to a significant Jewish presence, but this does not allow for an overinterpretation of the rabbinic sources. For example, Belayche repeat edly makes assumptions about the career of R. Judah ha-Nasi at Sepphoris. R. Judah, she contends (86), belonged to the city's elite "as conductor of a saltus Augusti" She is overly dependent on Ya'akov Meshorer's assumptions about the association of the patriarch with the Roman rulers, which are based on the "Antoni nus and Rabbi" traditions in the Babylonian Talmud.10 In reality, we know little? precious little, in fact?about Rabbi's days in Sepphoris.11 Talmudic tradition does, to be sure, frequently associate two leading sages with the city, one Rabbi's mentor, the other his disciple, that is, R. Yose ben Halafta and R. Hanina bar Hama. However, this does not tell us much about the patriarchate's position in the city. Similarly, Belayche resorts to the incorrect but common assertion that Sepphoris once had (when?) eighteen synagogues, which is based on a passage from Talmud Yerushalmi that has been totally misunderstood. The passage, Y. Kil'ayim 9, 32b, more likely speaks of eighteen assembly points (kenishan) along the way between Sepphoris and Bet Shearim at which villagers participating in the funeral procession for R. Judah ha-Nasi gathered to eulogize him.12 There are more reliable literary sources that refer to specific synagogues at Sepphoris, even if archaeology has yet to uncover one from the heart of the talmudic period. Still, there is no question that the rabbinic sources depict Sepphoris as home, as already noted, to important sages, and the impression given is that a large Jewish population resided there. Belayche sees the "porticoes, baths, theatres and spacious houses decorated with mosaics" as the context for the rabbis' rulings. Though she is probably going too far in asserting that the Jewish bouleutai frequented the villa excavated on the summit of the town, she is certainly correct in asserting that the realia of a Roman city are easily perceived in the writings of the rabbis. Moreover, the rabbis do little to repress this environment, and in one often overlooked example, that of the "castra shel Zippori," they acknowledge the Roman military presence in the city.13 Belayche may not have taken advantage 10. Belayche's identification of the "Antoninus" of rabbinic tradition with Caracalla is an example of her sometimes overacceptance of scholarly conventions?in this instance, the coziness of the Romans with the patriarchate under Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi. See my critique of Meshorer's view of the relevant coins in "Those Cantankerous Sepphoreans Revisited," in Ki Baruch Hu: Ancient Near Eastern, Biblical, and Judaic Studies in Honor of Baruch A.

I discussed the castra traditions at length in Studies in the History and Traditions of Sepphoris (Leiden: Brill, 1984), 15-45, 56-59, and argued that the "old castra of Sepphoris" was a Jewish encampment that was replaced by a Roman unit around 67 CE. The later castra was familiar to the Tannaim in the second century, who treat it from a halakhic perspective as a gentile institution. The assertion of Benjamin Isaac, "Jews, Christians and Others in Palestine: The Evidence from 333</page><page sequence="6">Stuart S. Miller of the most important or pertinent literary evidence, but her understanding of Sepphoris as a "cosmopolitan" town in which Jews intermingled with pagans (and eventually with Christians) without either being radically transformed remains the most convincing (if conventional) understanding of the existing evidence (87-91). Belayche treats the information pertaining to Tiberias in similar fashion, even if she concedes that the situation there was "slightly different." The city was referred to as a colonia on coins from the time of Elagabalus, a finding that has further support from a rabbinic source and a medieval ketubah.14 Again, Belayche takes the pagan symbols on Tiberian coins from the time of Hadrian, which included images of Tyche, Hygeia, and Serapis, as having a political rather than a religious message. As with Sepphoris, the rabbinic sources make it clear that the sages were aware of pagan institutions in the town. With regard to Tiberias, however, Belayche is willing to entertain the possibility that the four columned temple that appears on coins from the period of the Antonines is the "Hadrianeum" referred to in the fourth century by Epiphanius,15 who, in fact, indi cates that it was not completed. In Tiberias, too, Hadrian may have been treated as the Olympian Zeus, but Belayche contends that "imperial Hellenism," that is, a cultural phenomenon rather than a meaningful religious one, may have been all that was at play (93-94). Belayche takes for granted that Judaism continued to thrive even within this pagan cultural context. Indeed, hers is a less frequently asked question?the extent of Jewish influence on the pagan population?but alas, there is no evidence that the one God of the Jews registered with pagans in Tiberias and Sepphoris. On the other hand, Semitic, including Jewish, traditions converged in rural places such as Mambre, which evidently were not affected in the same ways as the cities by Romanization (95-107). If this is correct, one has to consider the implications for recent studies, including my own, that have explained the rabbinic movement, at least that component of it known from the Yerushalmi, as primarily an urban development. Romanization would not appear to have hampered the ability of Eusebius," in Jews in a Graeco-Roman World, ed. Martin Goodman (Oxford: Clarendon Press; Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), 66 n. 3, that "Miller does not discuss the presence of gen tiles in the city" is, therefore, puzzling. My Studies in the History and Traditions of Sepphoris, which was written before the excavations at Sepphoris began, was a methodological work aimed at demon strating how advances in talmudic methodology could be invoked in the treatment of the realia referred to in rabbinic writings, in this case, that pertaining to an urban center. The "history" I was attempting to write certainly was intended to illustrate that the use of rabbinic sources for the reconstruction of events in the talmudic period was no longer business as usual. Certainly, there was no assumption that Sepphoris was exclusively a city of Jews, never mind a city of "rabbis and kohanim." Cf. Schwartz, Imperialism, 142 n. 45. 14. See B. 'Avodah Zarah 10a; and Mordechai A. Friedman, Jewish Marriage in Palestine: A Cairo Geniza Study (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv University; New York: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1980), 2:207-11. 15. Panarion 30, 12, 2. 334</page><page sequence="7">Roman Imperialism, Jewish Self-Definition, and Rabbinic Society the rabbis to network and ultimately to thrive. Moreover, other aspects of "city" life might have been crucial for the rabbis' ultimate success. In any event, Belayche does not perceive urban life in Iudaea-Palaestina as impossibly alien to the rabbis or to Jews in general. She delineates "religious zones" within Palestine and asserts that only central Galilee around Sepphoris/ Diocaesarea and the area south of Eleutheropolis "were Jewish in the majority." The southern coast around Gaza and Raphia had a pagan majority. In most places, there was a mix of populations consisting of Jews, pagans, Samaritans, and the less numerous "Christians." The imperial cult, however, left few explicit remains, and indeed Caesarea and Tiberias may have been the only cities to build temples to Hadrian. For their part, the rabbis were sensitive to the challenges of living within pagan towns and took note of the adventus (M. 'Avodah Zarah 4:6, "kings passing by"), which Belayche regards as an exceptional occurrence (279-82). A quarter of the cities of Roman Palestine bore the name Augustus or that of a Roman god, but, as opposed to manifes tations of individual piety, public religious expressions, including sacrifices, were rare and therefore were less of a concern to the rabbis, who treat them as episodic. Similarly, although Tyche may have been common, with the excep tion of the mithraeum at Caesarea, there really is no evidence for the spread of mystery cults. Thus, for Belayche, Roman Palestine was an ordinary Roman province in which paganism would have a long life?indeed afterlife?persisting even beyond the advent of Christianity (298f.) but whose outward expressions and forms were just that. According to Belayche, "The Jewish elite, Hellenized but strong in number and surrounded [!] by famous scholars, had nothing to fear from adopting the system of Graeco-Roman cultural representation as a common language, knowing its faith and its practices to be safe due to its strict rules" (293). To be sure, Belayche appreciates and describes in detail the spread of pagan motifs in Roman Palestine, but these were mostly "Graeco-Roman forms of representation" that were universal in character (294). Jews appear to have been immune to the more profound pagan beliefs. Moreover, the "one God" (eis theos) and "high God" (theos hypsistos) of the Jews is relatively rare in pagan invocations and dedications in Roman Palestine. In short, Belayche sees a kind of "separatism" as the rule, one in which contacts between adherents of different religions, particularly in Sepphoris and Tiberias, which were known for their Jewish "orthodoxy" (!), were conducted under a "benevolent neutrality, because the Jews were not 'fundamentalists' and the Romans were not proselytes." Belayche is assertive: "The Jewish community did not suffer any 'paganisation'" (293). Interestingly, Belayche's rich catalogue of the pagan character of Roman Palestine does not lead her in a different direction. So pagan is the environment? despite its "religious zones"?that paganism would be around long after the Christianization of the land. Belayche notes in particular the ferocity of the anti Christian violence in the cities of Gaza, Ascalon, Sebaste, and Scythopolis, leading the reader to wonder whether these cities were the most seriously paganized and whether there is some truth, at least in relative terms, to 335</page><page sequence="8">Stuart S. Miller Epiphanius's assertion16 that Diocaesarea/Sepphoris and Tiberias were essentially Jewish in his day. After all, Sepphoris and Tiberias, notably, are not the centers of this conflict. Though Belayche may be going too far in seeing pockets of "bene volent neutrality" and separatism where it is more likely that different shades of influence existed, her assessment leads one to wonder whether the rabbis had indeed come to terms with their environment and arrived at a modus operandi long before the Christianization of the fourth century. Schwartz's Imperialism and Jewish Society Far different is Seth Schwartz's assessment of Roman Palestine. Schwartz covers much of the same ground, but unlike Belayche, who concentrates on doc umenting and describing the material evidence for paganism in Roman Palestine, he seeks to arrive at a comprehensive assessment of the effects of "imperialism" on Jewish life and society. In the process, he comes to conclusions that are diame trically opposed to the more common thinking represented by Belayche, which has paganism make some significant inroads but not enough to inhibit the ongoing vitality of the religion of the Jews or the emergence of rabbinic Judaism. Schwartz professes to offer his readers an entirely new way of thinking about Jewish society and history in the late Second Temple, high Roman, and late antique periods. His basic contention is that after 135 CE, the "core ideology" of the Jews, which revolved around "God, the Temple, and the Torah," essentially became moribund and no longer lent cohesion to Jewish society in Palestine. As Judaism "imploded," the rabbis and the patriarchate found themselves with no power base, meaning that they received no recognition from the Romans and, as a consequence, had little influence over their fellow Jews. For the time being, the Jews were essentially swallowed up by pagan culture and in effect became pagan Jews. One seemingly difficult point to refute is Schwartz's important assertion that the Roman state took little interest in the Jews between the Bar Kokhba war and about 350 CE, as opposed to before 135 CE and beginning with the later fourth century. In the intervening period, the Jews, claims Schwartz, were not regarded by the Romans as a "discrete category of humanity." Rather, they were subjects of the Romans just as others were. Tertullian's oft-quoted characterization of Judaism as a religi? licita, thought by many to be an indication of state policy, was never intended as a legal definition of Jewish status (186-92).17 For Schwartz, it is essential that after 70 CE the Jews tended not to press whatever privileges they had attained earlier; instead, they folded and now participated like everyone else in pagan civic cults and life. For their part, the Romans no longer had a need to treat the Jews as a special "category of humanity" because they had demolished their religion. \6. Panarion 30, 11,9-10. 17. See also Seth Schwartz, "Some types of Jewish-Christian Interaction in Late Antiquity," in Jewish Culture and Society under the Christian Roman Empire, ed. Richard Kalmin and Seth Schwartz (Leuven: Peeters, 2003), 198f. 336</page><page sequence="9">Roman Imperialism, Jewish Self-Definition, and Rabbinic Society One has to wonder, however, whether Schwartz is looking too hard for evi dence of licit corporate status. There are indications that individual Jews could still belong to a larger community without participating in public cults. And this evi dence comes from both rabbinic and Roman sources. M. 'Avodah Zarah 1:4 indi cates how some Jews negotiated the periods of pagan festivals by avoiding the "adorned" as opposed to the "unadorned" shops. A roughly contemporaneous Roman source, Digest 50.2.3.3, has Septimius Severus and Caracalla deciding that Judeans should be allowed to hold civic offices without feeling compelled to take on civic liturgies that might conflict with their own religious obligations.18 As James B. Rives has recently shown, what is striking about civic observances in the Roman Empire is not the enthusiasm which they might have elicited from Roman subjects but rather their banality. Those who participated?and this was not everybody?often did so only out of a sense of civic belonging.19 As we shall see, Schwartz's entire argument evolves out of his understanding of the recognized power, authority, and concomitant influence that Jews did or did not yield. In other words, if these are not apparent from the sources, then we must ask, where and who are the Jews? Schwartz is intent on countering what he perceives to be a "rabbinocentric" view of the period under discussion, one that was especially promoted by the school of Gedaliah Alon and has been influential particularly in Israel. Schwartz's sometimes high-handed dismissal of Israeli and other recent scholarship serves to set his approach in relief (5-7). Certainly in the last quarter century, there has been an increased realization, both in Israel and in the United States, that the rabbis are only part of the larger story of Roman Palestine. Historians who work with rabbi nic sources have also taken into consideration advances in talmudic methodology and have developed new strategies for their investigations. Schwartz's appraisal, however, stems from his determination to go further. He states quite explicitly that "we need ... to keep the rabbis to one side if we wish to understand the char acter of Jewish society between 70 and 640?a fortiori between 70-350." By shunting the rabbis to the sidelines, however, Schwartz goes much too far in the opposite direction. The Mishnah and tannaitic sources in general, so crucial in Martin Goodman's earlier construction of Jewish society up to 212 CE, are of little use here.20 Schwartz refers more often to Talmud Yerushalmi, but here, too, there is an underappreciation of just how much can be learned not just 18. See Amnon Linder, The Jews in Roman Imperial Legislation (Detroit, MI: Wayne State Uni versity Press; Jerusalem: Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, 1987), 103-6. See note 19. 19. James B. Rives, Religion in the Roman Empire (Maiden, MA: Blackwell, 2007), 116f, 130, 146f. Rives's assertion that many Jews, like Christians, never really desired to remove themselves from their communities (130) stands in stark contrast to Schwartz's view. Schwartz does admit at one point, p. 187, that the state might have regarded the Jews as a "discrete category of humanity" between the first and the fourth centuries, but only inconsistently. Rives, on p. 121, also contends that households had considerable freedom to pursue their own religious expression. See n. 85 herein. 20. The point about the Mishnah is made and elaborated by Millar, "Transformations," 148-50. Here, I add that the tannaitic sources in general could have been better utilized. Cf. Martin Goodman, State and Society in Roman Galilee, A.D. 132-212 (Totowa, NJ: Rowman and Allanheld, 1983), 6-14. 337</page><page sequence="10">Stuart S. Miller about the rabbis but also about Jewish society in the third and fourth centuries, that is, a period that begins well before the era of Christianization sets in and is rela tively close to the time in which the work was edited. This approach to rabbinic sources is surprising, particularly because Schwartz contends that the rabbis were the one group among the Jews that did not fall apart altogether. It was mainly the rabbis, albeit in a peripheral capacity, who preserved what was left of the "core ideology" (129). Schwartz asserts, "The Torah and its representatives lost their institutional position and much of their prestige, and they and their successors spent the rest of antiquity struggling to restore them. For the rabbis, the struggle did not finally succeed until the rise of Islam, at the earliest" (104). This perception is all the more perplexing because Schwartz also maintains that evidence for the recovery of Judaism in the fourth century and beyond can be seen in the sudden construction of monumental syna gogues during this period. Yet he also argues that the rabbis had little to do with these synagogues. If indeed this is the case (I am not suggesting otherwise), who were the Jews responsible for this burgeoning institution? Were these the descen dants of the pagan Jews whom Schwartz believed populated the land once the core ideology fell apart? To be sure, Schwartz asks this precise question (129), but his conclusion concerning the masses of Jews in the cities, rich and poor, is that they took part in pagan culture fully. Indeed, he comments, "Most Jews seem to have lived mainly as pagans and looked primarily to the Roman state and the city councils as their legal authorities and cultural ideal, but even they may have retained some sense of being not quite fully Greek ... Others may have been eclectic, living in some respects as pagans and in others as Jews, occasionally supporting and consulting rabbinic figures for some purposes, perhaps by the third century helping in the construction of synagogues but most often ignoring them" (176; emphasis mine). Schwartz is actually admitting that the rabbis were a significant group despite their limited authority and that they had a "loose periphery of sup porters" of people who lived "Graeco-Roman" lives and compartmentalized their Judaism, circumcising their sons and abstaining from pork but otherwise partici pating in the pagan religious rites of the cities. Out of this, somehow, came a rejuvenated Judaism once Palestine was sub jected to Christianization. The patriarchs, now and until 429 CE, when the nesi ut came to an end, were recognized leaders, and the rabbis, who managed to preserve their identity, now become a more significant group, as is evident by the redaction of increasing numbers of rabbinic literary sources. Most importantly, as noted earlier, the appearance of monumental Jewish architecture in the form of the syna gogue marked the resuscitation of the Judaism that had been in vogue prior to 132 CE. "Judaism" now would thrive primarily because it took its cue from Christian ity, which had its own monumental building program with similar dedicatory inscriptions and other expressions of euergetism. This last point is indeed novel, but before considering it further, we need to take a closer look at Schwartz's assessment of Jewish life, particularly in the cities of Sepphoris and Tiberias. It is striking to read Schwartz's assessment alongside the very different and in some ways more nuanced account of Belayche. Schwartz 338</page><page sequence="11">Roman Imperialism, Jewish Self-Definition, and Rabbinic Society reads the material evidence very differently and gives it greater weight than the rabbis' "misprizing" of paganism as fetish worship, which allowed them to func tion in a pervasively pagan environment. Christian and Jewish literature may have regarded these cities as essentially "Jewish," but the reality was much different (105). Numismatic evidence indicates that the people of Sepphoris "continued to celebrate their ancient friendship with Rome" with images of the Capitoline triad. For Schwartz, there is a direct relationship between such allusions and the public cult of a city. Although Schwartz rejects a metaphoric understanding of such allusions (141), it is still quite a leap to assume that the officially issued coins, which reflect the sentiments (and perhaps beliefs) of the mostly Jewish city councilors, indicate that the Jews of Sepphoris in general (perhaps with the exception of the rabbis) bought into paganism lock, stock, and barrel. To make his case, Schwartz assesses the archaeological finds from Sepphoris. There is no question that the presence of a theater in Sepphoris, built perhaps in the late first century, is an important statement and testimony to at least the ostensible culture of the city. Schwartz also points to the Roman villa dis covered atop the city and the Orpheus mosaic along the cardo down below. The villa's now famous mosaic, which depicts a symposium of Dionysus and various scenes from the myth of the god, almost certainly bore religious meaning for someone?the question is, precisely for whom? The official exca vation report proposed two very different views, one insisting that a Jew, perhaps even R. Judah ha-Nasi, lived in the home, and the other, because of the heavily pagan motif of the mosaic, insisting that that is unlikely.21 As mentioned earlier, rabbinic literature actually has precious little to say about R. Judah's stay at Sepphoris, even if there are a significant number of traditions that connect the patriarchate with the city in the third century. In any event, Schwartz would almost assuredly opt for Jewish ownership, but even that argument, as just noted, has been contested. Still, the presence of such a prominent villa dating to the third century and possibly in use until the great earthquake of 363, with a pro minent pagan mosaic in its triclinium, would have made some kind of very loud public statement. That is for sure?but how do we really know whether the obviously wealthy aristocrat who lived in this villa, Jewish or otherwise, was advertising his artistic proclivities, his pagan beliefs, or merely his status as one of Sepphoris's well-to-do? The villa, like the theater, points to a pagan cultural context, but it hardly proves anything about the religious beliefs and practices of the Jews who lived in the city. Schwartz is on a tad firmer ground when he points to the small, Roman-period Prometheus and Pan figurines found at Sepphoris, but his assertion that "not a single piece from the appropriate period with a Jewish symbol on it has been found" (145) is somewhat misleading. At least as suggestive as the Prometheus and Pan figurines are two lamps from Sepphoris, one with a depiction of a seven-branched menorah, the other with a menorah, a lulav, and possibly a 21.

Miller shofar. The lamps are admittedly a bit later (fourth century) than the figurines, but these small, seemingly conflicting artifacts only point to the individual tastes of some residents of Sepphoris and hardly suggest a trend in Jewish, pagan, or hybrid cultural directions prior or subsequent to the onset of Christianization. More telling is evidence that has implications for the larger population, at least of some neighborhoods at Sepphoris. The western summit excavated by the Joint Sepphoris Project and later by the Sepphoris Regional Project is notice ably lacking in pig bone finds. Even more crucial to our understanding of the reli gious practices of Sepphoris are the stone vessel finds, which may point to purity concerns of local Jews,23 and especially stepped pools, which are largely assumed to be ritual baths (mikva 'ot). These pools have been found in just about all areas of Sepphoris that have been excavated. Those on the western summit cover the entire period of interest here, dating from the late Hellenistic through the late Roman periods. Schwartz, however, questions the identification of these pools as mikva 'ot, relying on a short discussion by Hanan Eshel, who raises some import ant questions that need to be considered before concluding that a particular instal lation was intended for ritual use.241 have argued elsewhere that this, in fact, is not an either/or proposition (either they are mikva 'ot as defined by the rabbis or they are not).25 First of all, the mechanisms of two pools on the western summit at Sepphoris, one from the early Roman period and the other from the post-135 CE, middle, and possibly late Roman periods, can be easily understood in terms of rabbinic halakhah. But even if the pools did not conform to the rabbis' notion of a kosher mikveh, there can be little doubt that they were used for ritual (among other) purposes. The mistake has been to assume that a pool can only be defined as a ritual bath if we can explain how it worked in accordance with halakhah. What needs to be especially appreciated is the transcending power of water and its uses in antiquity.26 In short, a ritual bath need not have 22.

What makes the pools at Sepphoris so intri guing is the fact that they are found in domestic settings and are not designed as Roman baths. Indeed, they would have been impractical?not to mention expens ive?for ordinary bathing. Ironically, if these were strictly bathing installations, this at least is one instance in which the local Jews did not ape the Romans! In short, for Schwartz, it may be "unclear why the bathtubs [!] should not be con sidered simply bathtubs," but the opinion of most archaeologists and scholars who have studied mikva'ot and ritual bathing practices is that many of the stepped pools at Sepphoris and elsewhere served ritual purposes. Schwartz similarly makes short shrift of the evidence pertaining to synago gues at Sepphoris. He, too, follows the misreading of Y Kil'ayim 9, 32b that takes the passage to mean that there were eighteen synagogues in the city.27 There are, however, noteworthy references in rabbinic sources of Erez Yisra 'el to specific synagogues belonging to third- and fourth-century Sepphoris. Thus, we hear of "the great synagogue of Sepphoris" (kenishta ' rabbta ' de-Zipporin), "the synago gue of the Babylonians in Sepphoris" (kenishta ' de-Bavla 'ei be-Zipporin), and "the Gofhah synagogue of Sepphoris" {kenishta' de-Gofnah de-Zipporin)}^ One of these references, Y Berakhot 5, 9a, has the third-century amor a R. Yohanan studying Torah before the synagogue of the Babylonians when he is approached by a (Roman?) archon. This text offers rich possibilities for inves tigating rabbinic society within a seemingly alien environment. The context of the passage, which pertains to whether one who is praying or studying should acknowledge an official who passes by, most definitely has non-Jewish officials in mind. This is implied by the archon's response to Yohanan, as well as by the stories that follow, which specifically refer to situations in which rabbis find themselves in the presence of Roman officials. Regardless of whether these stories can be regarded as "historical" or whether they reflect conditions closer to the time of the editing of the Yerushalmi, they afford a wonderful opportunity to explore the very real engagement the rabbis had with the multicultural world in which they lived. In this specific case, a major rabbinic figure studying Torah before the Babylonian synagogue in Sepphoris being noticed by a non-Jewish archon (and his henchman) who then acknowledges Yohanan's Creator affords extraordinary insight into the perspective of the rabbis during the amoraic period. To be sure, Schwartz does consider the famous tannai tic story of Gamaliel's visit to the Bath of Aphrodite in Akko (M. 'Avodah Zarah 3:4) and explains how the urban rabbis had accommodated their legislation to new exigencies, especially when it involved "noncultic manifestations of 27. Again, see my article "On the Number of Synagogues in the Cities of 'Erez Israel," 59-63. Schwartz, Imperialism, 143 n. 46, further gives the impression that Y. Kil'ayim 9, 32b also includes a reference to thirteen synagogues at Tiberias. The two are completely independent traditions. That per taining to Tiberias appears in B. Berakhot 8a and is also discussed in my article, pp. 55-58. 28. Kenishta' rabbta' de-Zipporin: Pesikta' de-rav kahana', piska' 18. See Stuart S.

But this is precisely the point: The Greco-Roman "culture" that threatened the rabbis most may have been that which had religious implications, as Schwartz rightly contends, but the larger symbols of the Roman presence at Sepphoris, which included baths, a castra, and visiting or resident officials, to name a few, compelled them and their fellow Jews not necessarily to accommodate but to resist by means of their own cultural reflexes and expressions. Schwartz does take up some of this imagery in his portrayal of Tiberias, which otherwise is similar to that which he arrives at for Sepphoris. The city was thoroughly pagan, as is evident in Y 'Avodah Zarah 3, 42c, which suggests that the city "was dominated by images and shrines of gods ... which complicated things for the rabbis who lived and died there." The passage includes wonders that occurred at the deaths of various sages (e.g., "When R. Hanan died, the statues bent over"). According to Schwartz, the passage reveals that the "depaganization" of Tiberias was brought about by persons other than the rabbis, otherwise it would not have been necessary for the rabbinic editors to invoke supernatural processes. The editors may even have been responding to Christians who themselves were taking credit for the "depaganization" of the city (145^8). Y 'Avodah Zarah 3,42c, however, may be understood very differently. First of all, the passage is not only about Tiberias, nor is its focus the miraculous down fall of paganism at Tiberias or elsewhere. The passage begins with a notice that "when R. Nahum bar Simai died they covered the eikonia with mats" and con tinues with the explanation that this sage was known as "Nahum of the Holy of Holies" because he never looked at the images on coins in his lifetime. The worthi ness of the sages mentioned in the continuation of the passage is emphasized by the allusions to prodigious events that occurred at the time of their deaths, a method used frequently in the rabbinic sources to glorify the memory of revered sages. Schwartz is correct that paganism complicated matters for the rabbis, but Y 'Avodah Zarah 3, 42c emphasizes more than anything their awareness of this tension. Rather than see this and other rabbinic testimonies as evidence of thor oughgoing and ubiquitous paganism, Steven Fine, following Ephraim Urbach and Saul Lieberman, insists that the rabbinic sources regard Jewish participation in Jewish cults as rather limited. Fine contends that pious Jews would have been "inoculated" from idolatry through the daily recitation of the Shema and that of Ps. 115 (Hallel) on festivals and new moons. Fine notes that the rabbis' blessing upon seeing a destroyed "place of idolatry" amounted to a "cheer" for the uproot ing of idolatry. He follows Sacha Stem and others who contend that worship (pros tration, to be more exact) was what made something, say a mosaic, idolatrous.30 29.

But these sources hardly allow for any appreciation of how all of this registered with the majority of Jews in the city or elsewhere. The rabbinic sources, for all their one-sidedness, have much to say about the masses and provide little suggestion that "Most Jews ... lived mainly as pagans" (176). Indeed, as Fine has argued, these sources suggest that the par ticipation of Jews in pagan cults was limited. Fine provides a number of examples, both archaeological and textual/rabbinic, that point toward an awareness and ability to assimilate some aspects of pagan culture. In particular, the sages knew of and rationalized the use of vessels with Tyche on them. Fine regards the rabbis as "inoculated" (perhaps "readied" would be better) for a sophisticated resistance and response to paganism.32 I make a similar point in my discussion of the fifth-century synagogue mosaic from Sepphoris, to wit, that the rabbis (and no doubt other Jews) inherited a biblically derived polemic with paganism/ sun worship that enabled them to assimilate the sun into their Weltanschauung. This was not a sudden development. Rather, it can be traced from the biblical period through every period and genre of Palestinian rabbinic literature.33 The response to sun worship was not asserted all of a sudden by a resuscitated rabbinic/Jewish society under Christianity. We need not assume that passages such as Y 'Avodah Zarah 3, 43b, which indicates that the rabbis had their issues with passing before public statues, were, as Schwartz contends (or at least "wonders," 173), retrospective creations from the time of the editing of the Talmud, when the "rabbis ... no longer knew what it was like to live in a pagan city." The earlier rabbis knew very well what it was like to live among pagans; their response/resistance, or even what Schwartz considers to be "accommodation" to what they considered to be an idolatrous world, was not formulated for the first time in the fourth century under Christian rule. It had been long in the making. Schwartz is somewhat more compelling when he sticks to analysis of specific evidence, be it coins, the mosaic floor at Sepphoris, or piyyut literature. He rightly contends that a "stable meaning" of the rich mosaic synagogue floor from Sepphoris is unlikely but does not shrink from offering his own 31.

Miller programmatic reading, which has the mosaic portray movement from the liturgical and natural world to the "cosmic realm," which he explains as "a cult on high in which we participate through our actions below" (249-56). Schwartz's phenom enological understanding of this mosaic, as well as of the function of targum and piyyut, is central to his contention that "the Torah came to possess an ever increasing numinosity" in late antiquity. The synagogue derived its sanctity from this "numinosity," which was now expressed through ritualized performance rather than study of Scripture.34 Interesting, too, is his analysis of a kerovah piyyut of Yannai (268-72), in which he sees the menorah as symbolic of a mythic past of Israel, its present humi liation, and a future in which it will be redeemed. Schwartz regards such piyyutim as being in tension with the decoration found in synagogues. He claims that the payyetanim "read the synagogue art against the grain, as commemorating not Israel's place in the cosmos but its place in history." Very different is the assess ment of Fine, and for that matter, my own, of the interplay of synagogue mosaics and liturgy. Fine examines precisely the same piyyut and contends that its recitation in a synagogue decorated with menorot (as many were) or that had real, lit ones aside the ark "would have been quite striking even for those with a less thorough knowledge of Hebrew." He concludes that "the visual and aural, the Biblical, rabbinic and contemporary, would have merged into a marvelously unified and aesthetic liturgical performance." In his analysis of the closing silluk of the poem, Schwartz explains how Yannai subordinates the heavenly bodies, which are identical to the angels, to God. Schwartz parenthetically notes that the payyetan s emphasis is almost "polemical." As alluded to earlier, I have maintained that the rabbis would have been able to relate to the depiction of the sun/Helios/chariot in synagogue mosaics precisely because they and other Jews had inherited (and further elaborated) a long-standing polemic stemming from Psalm 19, which subordinates the sun and the heavenly hosts to God. Thus, rather than read Yannai's poem as the payyetan's perception of Israel's role in history, I agree with Fine that it should be seen as very much a part of the phenom enology of the synagogue, especially those with mosaic floors depicting the zodiac and the sun. Schwartz very much sees Yannai and other payyetanim as promoting the interests of the rabbis. This is true in many respects, but it is essential to Schwartz's argument. Thus, he forces the issue by claiming that piyyutim like that of Yannai undermine the idea that the synagogue was a satisfactory substitute for the Temple. Fine, in his book This Holy Place, has, in fact, argued that the Tannaim were already wary of allowing the synagogue to be seen in this fashion. Temple terms and imagery may have been used in synagogues, but the battei kenesiyyot derived their sanctity from the get-go from the communal prayer and especially 34. Schwartz's understanding of the sanctity of the synagogue would have been strengthened had he invoked Fine's earlier elaboration of the synagogue as "holy place." See Steven Fine, This Holy Place: On the Sanctity of the Synagogue during the Greco-Roman Period (Notre Dame, IN: Uni versity of Notre Dame Press, 1997). Schwartz, however, sees the function of the Torah scroll in the synagogue very differently than Fine. 344</page><page sequence="17">Roman Imperialism, Jewish Self-Definition, and Rabbinic Society the sacred Torah scroll. In any event, the rabbinizing payyetanim are enlisted in Schwartz's reconstitution and resuscitation of the Jewish community in late antiquity. Schwartz characterizes this period as one that witnessed a "process of Judaization" that was just beginning. Accordingly, "The Jews once again began to construct their symbolic world around the Torah, the (memory of the) Temple ... and they began once again to think of themselves as constituting Israel" (273; emphasis mine). The role of the payyetanim in all of this is curious. Does it not make better sense that these liturgical poets played a role in a process that was long on its way and owed its thrust to the earlier rabbis them selves? After all, the payyetanim all too often incorporate rabbinic ideas that were fostered by the rabbis long before there were liturgical poets. Not surprisingly, Schwartz sees the religiosity associated with the synago gue as parallel to that found in the Church (273). This, of course, fits his conclusion that the intensification of synagogue building, particularly of monumental struc tures, began with the Christianization of the empire. This, he argues, was a direct result of the Jews coming to perceive themselves, for the first time, as a com munity of religious persons. Nor was the timing accidental. The point at which the empire became Christian was, according to Schwartz, also the point at which "religion" became "disembedded" and became "a discrete category of human existence." Jewish culture in late antiquity in effect was "repackaged Christianity," which was largely catalyzed by the distinctiveness that now charac terized Christianity as a "religion" (179). Now, Schwartz argues, the Jews would become a religious community, by which he means one defined by Roman law and, at least until 429 CE, with a recognized leader known as the nasi35 These conclusions are indeed novel, even if they require much more sub stantiation and are hardly proven by the intense building of synagogues beginning with the fourth century and the parallels between the monumental architecture of the Jews and the Christians. Schwartz dismisses the possibility that early synago gues were not monumental and consisted of private dwellings, largely because we do not have instances such as those with monumental churches, which very clearly developed out of private dwellings. This may or may not be the case; Dura's syna gogue may have developed from a domestic building, and the Theodorus inscrip tion seems to imply architectural domesticity. But this misses the point. I have argued elsewhere that synagogues did not necessarily develop out of homes, but rather, the earliest synagogues may have been homes or domestic settings (i.e., sections or rooms in homes).36 These need not have developed into monumental synagogues?indeed, most probably did not, hence they are hard to identify in the archaeological remains. When larger, more public "houses" of assembly were needed in earlier times, they would have been built as such from the start?e.g., Gamla. With time, these more monumental structures increased in number, but 35. Cf. Schwartz, "Some Types of Jewish-Christian Interaction in Late Antiquity," 208f. 36. For what follows, see Miller, "On the Number of Synagogues in the Cities of *Erez Israel," 64-66; and my article "The Rabbis and the Non-Existent Monolithic Synagogue," in Jews, Christians and Polytheists in the Ancient Synagogue, ed. Steven Fine (London: Routledge, 1999), 57-70. 345</page><page sequence="18">Stuart S. Miller they never replaced house/domestic venues for prayer altogether. This would explain why not more than two monumental synagogues have ever been found at even large sites. It is surprising that fifth-century Sepphoris, at least from what we know archaeologically at this point, did not have several monumental synagogues, especially if there was a "re-Judaization" of the Jews at this time. Hence, my comparison with the contemporary phenomenon of shtiblach, which hardly ever become "monumental" synagogues and will undoubtedly not leave much of a trace, archaeologically speaking, may be cogent. That the Tannaim already had much to say about "battei kenessiyot" cannot be denied. The rabbis may have worshipped very often among their own in the battei midrash, which similarly lacked architectural definition. Note that not a single belt midrash has been securely identified. Indeed, the rabbis' lack of detail in describing the phys ical synagogue may indicate that many really did not stand out, at least not in the time of the tannaim and amor aim. To be sure, Schwartz recognizes that the rabbis may indeed have had their own synagogues and even suggests that these "were not the standard local synagogues" (238). So what did these nonstandard local synagogues look like? It stands to reason that they were not impressive or imposing structures, nor were many of their fourth-century and later counterparts, which similarly left no archaeological trace. It is also possible that the construction of monumental churches and synago gues may have both been outgrowths of other cultural trends within late antique society. The fact that the empire was now Christian is not in itself reason to attri bute the emergence of the rabbis and of "Judaism" to the new status and configur ation of Christianity as a "religion" in the sense that we tend to think of it. Surely, matters were much more complicated; other developments within late imperial society need to be considered.37 Moreover, although Schwartz does repeatedly speak of the role "imperialism" played in defining religious culture and Jewish society, other than consideration of patronage and an occasional allusion to econ omic and commercial matters such as coinage, he hardly defines what he means. There is little consideration of the Roman military, colonization, urbanization, road building, court systems?in essence, "imperialism" in its many guises. And this definition is essential in a work that places so much emphasis on Roman legal recognition of the Jews as a corporate entity. Indeed, Schwartz contends that it is only in the fourth century and beyond that we hear in synagogue inscriptions terms such as kahal (congregation), which display a self-perception and identity as a community (227,275). Schwartz does not consider benei/'anshei ha- '/Mown X, which appears frequently in tannaitic and amoraic lit erature from Palestine. He also emphasizes that the use of benei kartah (villagers) in inscriptions belongs to this later time and suggests that this expression may remind us of a "faint and diffuse rural self consciousness." The phrase is actually 37. Actually, Schwartz does recognize that larger forces were in play and that the resuscitation of Judaism in late antiquity was a "product of the same political, social, and economic forces that pro duced the no less distinctive Christian culture" (184). He does not, however, make clear how much of the distinctive Jewish culture resulted from these forces and how much of it was appropriated from the surrounding Christian society. 346</page><page sequence="19">Roman Imperialism, Jewish Self-Definition, and Rabbinic Society used not only in the late inscription at Khirbet Susiya but also in the Yerushalmi by the urban rabbis. Thus, it was not only the self-conscious residents of the karta '/ kartah but also the rabbis who perceived the benei karta ' as engaged, much like the benei/'anshei ha-'ir, in communal matters and interested in what the sages have to say, even if they might at times have been unhappy with what they heard.38 To be sure, Schwartz, following Y F. Baer,39 may be correct that there was no central, legally recognized corporate entity in the talmudic period. But why is this so significant? The evidence points to a natural development into the medieval period. It does not argue for a "failed," "shattered," or "disintegrated" predecessor but rather a community in the making or at least made possible by the antecedent perceptions of, among others, the earlier rabbis. Benei kartah may have come to mean something more corporate in synagogue inscriptions, but its use is already found in the Yerushalmi. Schwartz again relies on Baer when he argues that tannaitic sources do not regard the community as a subject of legislation or "a significant locus of religious meaning" (227). The Yerushalmi, too, he claims, does not assimilate the meaning of the synagogue and community. The Yerushalmi may not use the term kahal in the sense of community, but it does resort, as already mentioned, to terms such as benei/anshei (ir and benei karta '. There is a clear communal sense in these usages, just as there is in such synagogue designations as the "synagogue of the Babylonians," even if it does not point to a "legal" corporate entity. This sense of community, too, it could be argued, was evolving, until it perhaps coalesced under different historical conditions in the Middle Ages. The rabbis, in fact, provide a vivid sense of community affairs, even if they are not the usual civic interests that denote engagement with the city and its (political?) administrative infrastructure.40 For Schwartz, there is no serious Judaism, no influential rabbis, and no consequential self-understanding or authority invested in the type of Jewish community portrayed in the Yerushalmi. In reality, the rabbinic sense of community was very much in a dynamic flux that enabled it to take the various forms it did during the Middle Ages. There was no implosion of Judaism followed by resuscitation in the wake of Christianization. Such resuscitation would have been utterly impossible without earlier, profound developments that included the furthering of a sense of "community."41 Schwartz and others have moved away from a religious understanding of the Jews to one that emphasizes their ethnicity. Yet, even if we accept his assumptions about the "disembedding" of religion in the fourth century, religious elements undeniably played a role not only in the "core ideology" that he describes for 38.

Miller the Second Temple period but also for the continuing self-definition of the Jews after 70 and after 132 CE. I have recently argued that E. P. Sanders's notion of a "common Judaism" needs to be tweaked somewhat in light of the objections of the multiple-Judaisms school. What I have proposed is a biblically derived "complex common Judaism," elements of which continued to survive after 70 CE, when it persisted as the background from which all forms of Jewish expression ("groups" and "sects" were not before or after 70 CE the beginning and end of Jewish identity) were derived.42 It was this "complex common Judaism" that also lasted into the fourth and later centuries and formed the back ground for the emergence of the monumental synagogues, some of which have mosaics with zodiacs and depictions of Helios, plaques listing the legendary priestly courses, or even mosaics containing allusions to themes from rabbinic sources or a text derived from these very sources (at Tel Rehov, interestingly enough, less the attributions to specific rabbis). The complexity to which I am referring has room for both ethnic and religious components of Jewish identity. Without some such approach to the evi dence, we inevitably end up with a homogeneous?and extremely reductionist? interpretation of the material finds that leads to the conclusion that most Jews were, as Schwartz would have it, thoroughly paganized. As Si?n Jones explains, "if Jewish communities are identified on the basis of such a range of fixed material traits, then it follows that Jewish culture and identity are assumed to be monolithic and homogeneous across diverse social and historical contexts. Potential variation in other aspects of the archaeological record is often ignored, and the presence of non-Jewish material on Jewish sites is either taken as evidence for other groups, or as evidence for the Hellenization of Jewish communities and a corresponding loss of Jewish culture and identity." Jones argues against a "one-to-one" correspondence between material finds and ethnic identity. Jones surely sees the complexity that I am allowing for, insisting that "individuals may shift identity in different situations, or even per manently, depending on their interests."43 In contrast, Schwartz's paganized Jews whose Judaism had imploded leave practically no room for Jews (other than the exceptional rabbis and some tag-alongs) who, as Jones suggests, might have appropriated pagan material culture within a Jewish context. In the end, ethnic differences may have resulted in "a complex web of overlapping sty listic boundaries" that is reflected in material culture and defies homogeneity.44 The essential challenge of understanding the Jews and Judaism in the Roman period is to avoid simplistic either/or assumptions and assessments of the evidence. These are manifested in many different ways, but especially when it comes to typing material finds and understanding their utility as markers of 42. My use of "complexity" is derived from its application in the sciences and social sciences. See Miller, Sages and Commoners, 21-28, for a full elaboration of "complex common Judaism." 43.

Indeed, Schwartz sees these Jews as caught between two extremes which in the end had an unequal attraction (176). But this was not the case. Schwartz fails to distinguish life in towns such as Tiberias and Sep phoris, located in the Jewish heartland, such as it was, from Caesarea, or for that matter, Bet Shean, which he suggests helped along the Jews' sense of separation by taking on the names Nysa and Scythopolis. That the rabbis themselves treated these cities differently and were acutely aware of the dominant pagan atmospheres in Caesarea and Bet Shean is a tip-off that the experience of Jews within all of these and other cities varied. The homogeneous?or at least ubiquitous?pagan culture in which Schwartz believes most Jews took part, just like other provincials in the empire, blinds him to real distinctions that are apparent from both the literary and material evidence. Differences in the extent of receptivity to Roman culture existed between the cities of the Near East, as has been demonstrated by Peter Richardson.46 At a time when the whole notion of "Romanization," which often bears connotations of sameness and colonization, has been challenged and is under going revision, Schwartz's assessment is very surprising.47 Moreover, Schwartz's search for a controlling, legally recognized group inevitably means that the paganized Jews he is describing were elites who may indeed have been more likely to have been attracted to pagan culture. Assuming this understanding of the material culture is correct, why assume that most other Jews similarly followed the lead of the elites? Unfortunately, we do not have a recognizable literature that can be attributed to the hypothetical paganized Jews. What we do have are the writings of the rabbis, which depict, at least when 45.

Miller these sources are read critically, heterogeneous communities of Jews, albeit from the peculiar perspective of the rabbis. The rabbis may not have been the only ones capable of and successful at preserving "covenant theology," continuing to lead their lives in the shadow of offensive imagery and symbols of Roman paganism. Their literature hints at a "complex common Judaism" that persisted in the background and that they were constantly trying to negotiate. Indeed, they recog nized the existence not only of pagans but perhaps more so of other Jews whose lives they would have liked to have influenced, but who very clearly were not rabbis?and not paganized Jews. Thus, the rabbis constantly observe and comment on the behavior and lives of the Jewish commoners, whom they often refer to as benei/"anshei {ha-) 'ir and, more specifically, as benei/ 'anshei of town or village X. These persons occasion ally solicit the views of the sages, but most often their practices are mentioned in contexts that concern Sabbath observance, other festivals, and communal con cerns. Tithing and purity matters, to wit, the very issues that come up in passages dealing with the (ammei ha- 'arez, are not central to the traditions in which benei/ 'anshei ha- ?r/town X appear. The benei/'anshei ha- ?r/town X and the 'ammei ha- 'arez should be regarded as distinct elements of the nonrabbinic constellation of "commoners." They most certainly were not paganized apostates who were forever lost to their people. Indeed, the latter are much less of a concern to the rabbis. The minim, to be sure, pose a challenge, but here, too, it is primarily indi vidual minim and their heretical beliefs and practices that concern the rabbis, not a specific, organized group of "minim" composed of like-minded Judeo-Christians, Judeo-Gnostics, etc. Even so, a good number of traditions involving urban rabbis and minim are indicative of the heterogeneous life of the city, with which the rabbis were acutely familiar.48 Returning to the (ammei ha-'arez (or, more usually the singular 'am ha- 'arez in Palestinian sources), it is clear that these persons are presented in the Bavli and in later rabbinic literature as a threat, but they are hardly perceived as such in tannaitic and amoraic texts from Erez Yisra 'el. There, the (ammei ha- 'arez, like the benei/'anshei ha- ?r/town X, were perceived as followers of biblical laws, albeit not necessarily the halakhah of the rabbis. Unlike the benei/'anshei ha-'ir/town X, however, their laxity in certain areas (agricultural laws and purities) made them stand out, if only because, with regard to other matters, the rabbis considered them to be very much part of the social fabric of Jewish society.49 In the end, the notion of a near total implosion of Judaism seems far-fetched, a hypothesis based on Schwartz's inability to imagine Jews being Jews within a pagan context. 48.

Although Boyar?n depends on Schwartz's understanding of "religion," his effort is otherwise distinct. Still, while pursuing his own interests, he adds more flesh to Schwartz's ideas and takes them in some new, even more provocative, directions. Boyar?n concentrates on what is traditionally regarded as the "parting of the ways," which in recent days, partially because of the influence of Boyarin's think ing, has been newly construed by some as "The Ways That Never Parted."50 That the lines between Jews and "Christians" were originally blurry is nothing new. This is precisely why much care needs to be given to the evaluation of material finds and why "identity markers" are a tricky business, as explained earlier. Reuven Kimelman aptly describes the situation when he says, "Whereas many rabbis and Church fathers promoted a policy of either/or, many Jews and Chris tians acted as if it was both/and. As the rabbis and church fathers gained control over their constituencies, their policy of either/or prevailed."51 Along similar lines, in my discussions of the minim and more recently of "complex common Judaism," I have emphasized that the preoccupation of scholars with typing dis tinct groups of Jews (e.g., "Jewish Christians") has obfuscated our understanding of the facts on the ground. The min was in many ways indistinguishable from other Jews, not only in the eyes of the rabbis but also in reality.52 This is not to say that Boyar?n is not offering anything new. In fact, he has given us much to think about. Although his study is entirely literary, his examin ation of different textual traditions, whether they be pagan, Christian, or Jewish, is always interesting, and there is an abundance of truly novel insights, many of which compel the reader to think and rethink the diversity that characterized ancient Judaism. Boyar?n resorts to what linguists call "wave theory," whereby similar dialects do not necessarily derive from a common origin but rather from the confluence that results from the use of these dialects in neighboring locales. Innovations that are introduced at any point have a ripple effect that may even tually lead to differentiation. With regard to the topic at hand, there was a certain "hybridity" that resulted in a "fluidity" in Jewish expression and ultimately led to a "clustering" of distinct "entities," in this case, of "Judaism" and "Christianity." According to Boyar?n, Judaism and Christianity influenced one another (like waves spreading water in every direction) after the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE until they became, considerably later, "orthodox Christianity" 50. See Adam H. Becker and Annette Yoshiko Reed, The Ways That Never Parted: Jews and Christians in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages (T?bingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2003). In his con tribution to this volume, "Semantic Differences: or, 'Judaism'/'Christianity,'" 73, Boyar?n acknowl edges that Schwartz's work set the agenda for his own research. 51.

Miller and "rabbinic Judaism" (the Judaism of the Talmud and later). For Boyar?n, wave theory allows for more "fluid and not strictly defined borders on the ground" than the conventional Stammbaum view (17-22).53 Boyar?n argues that both rabbinic Judaism and Christianity shared a common history and were, in fact, indistinguishable at least until both turned to "heresiology." This, in rum, led to the emergence of distinct orthodoxies, but not before the fourth century. Rather than view what transpired as a "parting of the ways" that had begun already in the first century, Boyar?n posits a gradual sorting out of identities that only became acute once Christianity adopted all the trappings of what we presently call "religion." (Here, of course, Boyar?n is indebted to Schwartz.) Judaism, on the other hand, continued to be defined by culture and ethnicity but would adopt some of the qualities of a religion that it had picked up in its conversation with or reaction to the new religion of the empire. Once we admit that "religion" as we know it developed with the Christia nization of the empire in the fourth century, we can only conclude that rabbinic Judaism underwent the same packaging, at least in the eyes of the church, which was responsible for "interpellating" Judaism into existence (9). Having been called into being by Christianity, rabbinic Judaism would "refuse" to become a similar, discreet "religion" and instead continued to emphasize its ethnicity.54 Boyarin's arguments are in many ways made possible by earlier develop ments in the study of rabbinic sources, including the efforts of Jacob Neusner, who demonstrated the multilayered unfolding of talmudic writings and ideas, and of David Weiss Halivni, who has convincingly argued that the anonymous, discursive material (stam) in the Babylonian Talmud was the work of anonymous stammaim who put their stamp on the whole sometime in the fifth and early sixth centuries, that is, long after the last of the rabbis of the Talmud (Amoraim) lived. Boyar?n credits Saul Lieberman with making the point that rabbinic legends cannot be regarded as historically reliable accounts of earlier events, although that is not the main thrust of Lieberman's comments.55 Add to this stew the 53. See Miller, Sages and Commoners, 25f, esp. n. 78, where I explain how "complex common Judaism" differs from this approach. See the discussion that follows. 54. Much of this territory is covered in Border Lines, Chapter 8, 202-26, which Boyar?n also published in expanded form as "The Christian Invention of Judaism: The Theodosian Empire and the Rabbinic Refusal of Religion," Representations 85 (2004): 21-57. 55. See Daniel Boyar?n, "Martyrdom and the Making of Christianity and Judaism," Journal of Early Christian Studies 6, no. 4 (1998): 40 n. 40, where he quotes S. Lieberman, "The Martyrs of Cae sarea," Anuaire de l'institut de philology et d'histoire orientales et slaves 1 (1939^44): 395. Lieber man's point in "The Martyrs of Caesarea" is that the Yerushalmi has valuable and oftentimes reliable historical information because it was produced close to the period with which it is largely con cerned. Lieberman may downplay the importance of legends, but he does not argue, as Boyar?n (cf. Border Lines, 223) claims, that "talmudic legend may be read as useful information for the history of the time and place of its production and not the time and place of which it speaks" (emphasis mine). That is Lieberman's general point about talmudic materials, not about rabbinic legend. In fact, Lieberman is less interested in legendary material per se than he is in the incidental realia and infor mation found embedded in halakhic materials and in the "homilies" of the rabbis, which he believes 352</page><page sequence="25">Roman Imperialism, Jewish Self-Definition, and Rabbinic Society controversial findings of Israel Yuval, who has examined numerous parallels between Christianity and Judaism in late antique and medieval sources but who, unlike Boyar?n, argues that they usually reflect a Jewish response to their Christian environment rather than "a theme common to two Judaic dialects" (5),56 and one can only wonder whether the real influence of the earliest rabbis, including the Tannaim of the period of the Mishnah, came later rather than earlier, that is, after their views had been assembled, reworked, and "published" for the first time. Boyarin's hypothesis, however, wears thin when he regards evidence from talmudic sources as only reflecting the periods in which they were (hypothetically) edited. Thus, he discounts an important passage in the Bavli pertaining to Samuel ha-Qatan and the origins of the birkat ha-minim as a fourth- or fifth-century "Babylonian talmudic story" (68). This may very well be, but he fails to note that the source has been either reported or formulated (which of the two needs to be argued) in B. Berakhot 28b-29a as a tannaitic baraita. Conversely, in arguing that Rabbi Judah Ha-Nasi "forcibly" injected his genealogy and his line into the rabbinic chain of tradition of Mishnah 'Avot, he alludes to a well known baraita in B. Kerubot 103b that reports Rabbi Judah's deathbed insistence to his son Gamaliel that he rule "with severity, striking fear into the hearts of the sages" (80-81). The undue emphasis on a report that is open to interpretation to prove the "near violent introjection" of the patriarchs into the rabbinic diadoche (85) is surprising in view of Boyarin's insistence that late Babylonian sources must be taken as precisely that. This reader agrees in principle with Boyarin's cir cumspection where the rabbinic sources are concerned, but you simply cannot have it both ways! One instance that must be a stammaitic invention, according to Boyar?n, is the "Yavneh legend." Boyar?n does little to explain the relationship between the various pre-70 CE sects and the "indeterminacy" of rabbinic thinking that, at least according to the traditional view, unfolded after the destruction of the Temple at Yavneh, where "these (words of Beit Hillel) and those (words of Beit Shammai)" came to be regarded, because of a bat kol, as "the words of the Living God."57 Shaye J. D. Cohen has proposed that the sages who convened at Yavneh after 70 CE formed a "grand coalition," one that brought together many different viewpoints that would find their expression in the multivocal opinions assigned to "rabbis."58 This was and remains a persuasive depiction of what may have transpired at Yavneh, particularly because it is built on a profound often reveal the sentiments of the people.

Miller understanding of the variety of Jewish expression in the late Second Temple period. Boyar?n has little to say about the period leading up to Yavneh, and he ignores the historical impact that the destruction of the Temple had on Jewish life. Consolidation of diverse views makes perfectly good sense in the wake of the destruction?in fact, better sense than Boyarin's assertion that Yavneh really is representative of the (much) later rabbis who wished to assert their power and knowledge through the domination of the Oral Torah. According to Boyar?n, just as Athanasius (ca. 300-373 CE) "invented" a "certain account" of Nicaea that established the authority of the fathers of the church and the council itself, so the redactors of the Babylonian Talmud ("the collective rabbinic Athana sius") were responsible for forging the various stories that make up the "Yavneh legend." Both projected onto the past (although Boyar?n acknowledges that the redactors of the Bavli went much further back) in order to establish, in the case of the rabbis, their indeterminate but authoritative Oral Torah and, where the voices of the church are concerned, the apostolic tradition (192-200). Boyarin's point about Yavneh is largely dependent on aggadot that appear in the Babylonian Talmud. With regard to the bat kol that pronounced the words of both Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai the living words of God, he asserts that it is especially the perspective of Yavneh found in "the redaction layer of the Babylonian Talmud, in which the notion of a single true Torah has been aban doned" (159). Yet the notice concerning the bat kol only appears once in the Bavli (B. 'Eruvin 13b), whereas it is repeated in three distinct tractates of the Yerushalmi.59 More importantly, it is in the versions of the Yerushalmi that a gloss attributed to R. Yohanan indicates that the bat kol was pronounced at Yavneh. The Bavli does not mention Yavneh at all in this connection. This would seem to undermine Boyarin's case concerning the later, Babylonian, stammaitic projection of indeterminacy onto the rabbis of Yavneh. Furthermore, although it is true that the geonim of Babylonia sometimes resorted to earlier sources to bolster the authority and hegemony of their own ye shivot,60 it has not yet been demonstrated that a similar phenomenon occurs in the latest strata of talmudic writings. That is, to prove or at least make the case, for example, that "Yavneh" is a cover for the dynamics of rabbinic self-definition in the sixth century, Boyarin needs to demonstrate that other "early" venues and events are routinely used in the amoraic or stammaitic layers of the Bavli in similar fashion. What is also required here and elsewhere is a greater historical awareness. Though Christianity certainly gained adherents east of the Euphrates in the Sassanian period, and it is, therefore, justifiable to consider how this might have affected the perspective of the Babylonian stammaim (cf. 223f), the author resorts to Christian writings from Palestine and elsewhere farther west (202-14) to demonstrate the emerging "border lines" between rabbinic Judaism 59. See n. 57 herein. 60. For an example, see Stuart S. Miller, "Zippori ve-ha-Tefuzot: ha-Hashpa'ah ha Mitmashekhet shel Merkaz Talmudi ba-Galil," in Merkaz u-Tefuzah, 'Erez Yisra 'el ve-ha-Tefuzot bi Yemei Bayit Sheni, ha-Mishnah, ve-ha-Talmud, ed.

In addition, the concept of "Oral Torah" may emerge in its fullest sense in the Bavli, as Neusner has shown, but some of the Babylonian notions are already inherent in the Palestinian tradition.61 Finally, the post-talmudic period did not witness the immediate triumph of the Babylonian Talmud and its presentation of rabbinic Judaism. There was much life left to the Yerushalmi, which continued to leave its mark on synagogue mosaics of 'Erez Yisra 'el in the fifth and sixth centuries and made its way to North Africa and Europe, where it certainly left its imprint on rabbinic Judaism. In short, Boyar?n fails to place his arguments within a convincing historical-geographical framework. Moreover, Boyarin's penetrating analysis does not always allow for the his torical developments he would like us to believe occurred. The most trenchant part of Boyarin's book is his analysis of "Logos theology," that is, the notion that there are two divine powers, the second sometimes represented as wisdom (Logos), as in the opening chapter of the Gospel of John. Although Boyarin's tendency to under stand the targumim as literature of the synagogue (rather than rabbinic, at least in some sense) is debatable and meant to prove just how widespread the notion of memra (word, saying) or Logos theology was, his argument that John is really culling from a thoroughly Jewish background remains compelling and deserves wider discussion, particularly among New Testament scholars. Nevertheless, the interest expressed by some Jews in such beliefs and the eventual need on the part of the rabbis to respond by characterizing the notion of "Two Powers in Heaven" as heresy fail to point us in the direction of an emerging orthodox Chris tianity. It is one thing to see parallel processes of defining the "other" in Judaism and in Christianity; it is another to regard the rabbis' preoccupation (such as it was) with minut as the rabbinic "appropriation" of a Christian notion, heresy (29, 54-58). It is one thing to recognize the uniqueness of the indeterminate character of rabbinic argumentation; it is quite another to see the rabbis' propensity for con fronting difference as a direct response or reaction to the development of Christian catechism in the fourth century. It is one thing to demonstrate that over time the rabbis, as opposed to the church fathers, became more tolerant of dissent and "canonized" it; it is another to assert that the rabbis of the "stammaitic" period, which has not been definitively dated and whose character is still debated by scho lars, fabricated "Yavneh" and promoted the notion of Oral Torah in order to con solidate their authority over religious life and practice. The irony is that after insisting that there is no "proto-religion" from which Judaism or Christianity independently sprung, Boyar?n really does not abandon the notion. Instead, he replaces the earlier accepted paradigm with its opposite. Instead of Judaism as the parent or the progenitor, it was Christianity that emerged as a true proto-religion from which Judaism as we know it "appropriated" much.62 Although scholars have recently argued that Judaism and Christianity should be seen more as siblings (rather than as mother and child) that eventually 61.

Boyar?n, "Semantic Differences: or, 'Judaism7'Christianity,'" 72f. 355</page><page sequence="28">Stuart S. Miller parted from one another, Boyar?n in effect is suggesting that we return to the original conception, except that Christianity is the parent religion and Judaism the offspring!64 This is really a return to the original position, except that Chris tianity now comes out on top. Boyarin's point here is transparent: Christianity spawned Judaism as we know it, that is, rabbinic Judaism. To be sure, Boyar?n contends that the rabbis began to develop a notion of orthodoxy long before the fourth century. If indeed he is correct that this develop ment coincided with Justin Martyr's interest in Christian heretics in the second century, that would seem to argue in favor of a process that unfolded over several centuries. It is evident throughout his book that Boyar?n has stmggled with how much of the development of rabbinic Judaism to assign to earlier and later periods. Indeed, an earlier version of his discussion pertaining to heresiology (curiously left out of this book's bibliography) was titled "Justin Martyr Invents Judaism" (emphasis mine).65 In any event, even if Boyarin's argument that the "'orthodox' rabbis expelled what the 'orthodox' Christians appropriate" is persua sive, it does not prove that there was an active engagement of rabbis with Christian beliefs (or vice versa) earlier in the second century. It only speaks to the existence of an interesting parallel dynamic. Moreover, it is much more likely that the rabbinic notion of indeterminacy was also long in the works, having been formulated in the wake of the destruction as contended by Cohen. Surely, it was more crucial to the rabbinic self-definition than heresiology. The Judaism that Boyar?n describes, which so nimbly responds to heresy (especially the "two powers in Heaven" ideology), is hardly rabbinic Judaism. Indeed, the theological and heresiological aspects of rabbinic Judaism that he emphasizes are much less defining for rabbinic Judaism than they are for Christianity. The rabbis had an identity and a religion (however one under stands it) that went well beyond defining themselves vis-?-vis the Other. As Cohen notes, "At no point in antiquity did the rabbis develop heresiology and ecclesiology, creeds and dogmas. At no point did they expel anyone from the rab binic order or from rabbinic synagogues because of membership in some heretical group. Those who held incorrect beliefs were chastised or denied a share in the world to come, not denied a share in the people of Israel in this world."66 Cohen's last point is particularly important. In his review o? Border Lines, Neusner rejects Boyarin's assertion that the Bavli, again in response to Christian ity's new self-definition as a "religion," established the idea that "an Israelite, even if he sins, remains an Israelite" (B. Sanh?drin 44a) as the defining principle in rab binic Judaism. Instead, Neusner proffers, the Bavli merely expanded the definition of an Israelite already taken for granted in the tannaitic sources that assert that ato nement for sin comes through death (M. Sanh?drin 11:1). It is precisely because 63. See Alan F. Segal, Rebecca's Children: Judaism and Christianity in the Roman World (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University, 1986), 179-81. 64.

Boyarin speaks of a "mutual and parallel shaping of heresy" that began in the second century among the rabbis and Christians. Both Jews (i.e., rabbis) and Christians were now on their way to defining definitive orthodoxies. Boyarin rightly argues that the terms minim and minut do not refer to anyone specific. Although for different reasons, I have argued that the term minim does not designate a well-defined group.68 For Boyarin, it is imperative that they not be Gnostics, however, and he goes to great lengths to prove this, invoking his assessment of "two powers in Heaven," which is devoid of a separate, hostile demiurge. Thus, the rabbis' objection to the "two powers" notion stemmed from their eventual inclination to "give over" (56) to Christianity any hint of "Logos theology." It is especially here that Boyarin contends, "The 'orthodox' Rabbis expel what the 'orthodox' Christians appropriate" (56). Nevertheless, minut must remain for Boyarin an abstract concept, or, as he puts it, a "rhetorical entity," precisely because it is "a product of the encounter with 'orthodox' Christianity." In other words, minim may not necessarily be Christians, but the notion of minut came about to some degree because of Christianity's challenge to Jewish identity (57). Before addressing this more abstract and heuristic understanding of minut, some discussion of the relevant nomenclature is in order. The rabbis never seem to be concerned about precise definitions of those whose views they found objec tionable. This is generally true in their treatment of the minim as well. Indeed, as Marcel Simon long ago noted, it is only in later sources from the fourth century on that the plural term seems to have a more specific, cohesive connotation. Earlier on, the minim were "merely a collection of individuals."69 Boyarin contends that earlier, particularly Palestinian, sources regard minut as a designation for 67.

Miller Jewish heresies, but the Bavli treats minut as "the other religion," that is of the Gentiles, be it paganism or Christianity. This may help to explain why the meaning in the Bavli may have moved to some degree in the direction of a better defined group, but identifying which group of Gentiles is intended is often as treacherous as figuring out which person or persons are meant in earlier sources. Thus, most scholars may believe that the minim in B. 'Avodah Zarah 4a before whom R. Abbahu commends Rav Safra were (Gentile) Christians who were aware of the connection between chosenness and suffering in Amos 3:2 and questioned Israel's election, but it is entirely possible, if not probable, that their identification was less important to those who preserved the story than it is to us and was more of a muddle than is usually thought. Gnostics, too, considered themselves to be "elected," and even Romans believed that they were destined to suffer because Rome was the numine deum electa (the chosen of the gods).70 Fur thermore, the appearance o? minim in a number of sources from both 'Erez Yisra 'el and Babylonia, alongside "evildoers" (poshe'im), and especially in lists that include "apostates" (meshummadim), informers (masorot), "hypocrites" (hanefin), and the equally slippery 'apikorsin, supports the contention that no specific, named, or well-defined group is intended.71 It would be pretty difficult to prove that any one of these other terms is the product of an encounter with a specific heresy or challenge to Jews or Judaism, let alone with Christianity. Thus, originally it was individual heretics or other persons who maintained some aberrant (from a rabbinic point of view) practice that the rabbis were mostly concerned with and sometimes had in mind when they resorted to the plural minim. There is no single, well-defined group of Christians, Gnostics, Epicureans, etc., that stands behind this term, certainly not in the earliest sources. This is pre cisely why it seems a bit of a stretch to imagine that Christianity was the catalyst for the "invention of minut" already in the second century, as Boyar?n claims. More to the point, the corpus of minim/minut references does not add up to a rabbinic "heresiology"?quite the contrary. Even where heretical views are at stake in a rabbinic passage, heresiology per se, that is, a concerted attempt to strike out at those with errant beliefs and to weed them out of the fold, is not as well articulated among the rabbis as it is among the church fathers. What is remarkable about the rabbinic references to min/minim is just how little the sages convey about the persons intended and any ideologies they may have espoused?2 70. See Miller, "Further Thoughts on the Minim of Sepphoris," 6f. Boyarin, Border Lines, 223f, discusses B. 'Avodah Zarah 4a from a different angle. 71. See Seder 'Olam Rabbah 16, which is discussed by Chaim Milikowsky, "Gehinnom U-Fosh'ei Yisra'el 'al pi 'Seder Olam,'" Tarbiz 55 (1986): 329-37. Cf. Miller, "The Minim of Sepphoris Reconsidered," 401 n. 93. See also Midrash Psalms 6; B. 'Avodah Zarah 26a-b; and B. Rosh Ha-Shanah 17a. 72. Many examples from both tannaitic and amoraic materials may be provided to prove this point. One wonderful instance appears in Genesis Rabbah 14:7, which I discuss in "The Minim of Sepphoris Reconsidered," 386-92. The midrash relates a confrontation between R. Yose ben Halafta and a min in a house of mourning, where the min questions the rabbi's belief in bodily resurrection. Lots of candidates for this min can be suggested, but the metaphor that Yose uses to refute the min has an almost identical parallel in a roughly contemporary, Valentinian Gnostic source, the Gospel 358</page><page sequence="31">Roman Imperialism, Jewish Self-Definition, and Rabbinic Society It has to be admitted that heresiology played a more important role in Chris tian self-definition than it did for the rabbis. Indeed, as Martin Goodman has pointed out, the earliest orthodox Christians went to great lengths to fine-tune heresies, whereas the rabbis were more "inward" looking and cultivated a much vaguer per ception of minut.13 Is it any surprise that the closest the rabbis either in Babylonia or in Erez Yisra 'el get to a sustained discussion of the ways of non-Jews is in the trac tate 'Avodah Zarah, which is largely concerned with dealings with the non-Jew, not their ideology? Even when these texts are later translated into a Christian milieu the concerns that remain are: how does one live, work, worship, and socialize alongside or within communities of non-Jews?not how to formulate a theological response to their "religion"?as is quite evident from the discussions of the Tosafot and other early medieval European sages (ri'shonim).74 The 'ammei ha-'arez, too, require a more sophisticated assessment. Although they are not central to the focus of Boyarin's book, his comments about them are revealing, inasmuch as they reflect the need, mostly among scho lars who wish to demonstrate the limited influence of the sages, to find a foil to the rabbis.75 Boyarin sees the 'ammei ha-'aretz as "the majority of Israel" for whom the rabbis saw themselves serving as the leaders and "vanguard" (55). He goes further in suggesting that these "rural Galilean masses" had their own religious lea dership and observances, for which they were shunned by the rabbis, and may even have been more receptive to Jewish Christianity (256f. n. 155). In fact, as indicated earlier, the 'ammei ha- 'arez were not the majority of commoners. At least in sources of Erez Yisra 'el, the rabbis refer to most nonrabbis or "com moners" as 'anshei/benei ha-'ir/town X. Moreover, rabbis of Erez Yisra'el saw nonrabbis as either followers or, in the case the 'ammei ha- 'arez, if only occasionally, as potential followers. In addition, they tended to regard the of Philip 63. The passage seems to be pitting two different understandings of the metaphor against each other, the rabbinic, which promoted bodily resurrection, and the Gnostic, which maintained a spiritual understanding. Yet the editors (or Yose?) of the midrash have no interest in telling us much about this heretic. In fact, the disputed metaphor may have been commonly invoked as words of consolation, which is Yose's ostensible purpose in referring to it in the first place. 73.

He contends that the differing social structures of the two communities explains these divergences. The Tannaim were largely rabbinic disciple circles that were "preaching to the converted," whereas the church fathers and eventually the institutionalized church sought to spread their "proto orthodox" beliefs.

Boyarin fails to dis tinguish between the treatment of the 'ammei ha- 'arez in Erez Yisra 'el and in Babylonia. The tendency to regard the 'am ha- 'arez as ignorant of Torah and to cast him in disparaging terms belongs more to Babylonian and significantly later sources. One can indeed argue that the rabbis of Erez Yisra 'el more often promoted acceptance and belonging and only occasionally, and in an ad hoc fashion, took up the issue of the heretic. Heresiology took a back seat for the rabbis, who were more concerned with promulgating their practices among the benei and anshei ha-'ir/town X and explaining how one was to interact with the 'ami'ammei ha-arez, who were not to be trusted when it came to tithing and purity practices.76 This pragmatic emphasis is a major difference with Christianity and one that ultimately played a role in how the rabbis strength ened their "religion," however one defines it. In the final analysis, Boyarin recreates the rabbis in the image of the church fathers. That is to say, for Boyarin, the rabbis are theologians who expend most of their efforts struggling with complex issues such as "two powers in heaven," or, as he calls the larger issue, "Logos theology." The rabbis no doubt were tuned in to this "heresy," perhaps at times as Boyarin suggests, in reaction to the church's acceptance of the idea as a way of explaining the divinity of Jesus. But the rabbinic agenda included so much more, so much that was of a practical halakhic nature, and, where theological notions are concerned, so much that owed more to the adaptation of the biblically derived ideas to different times that to argue that "Christianization" was the defining moment for the rabbis ignores much else that already had defined them. Making Jews and Christians resemble one another in their way of thinking is a whole lot different than saying they are similar in practice. Boyarin sees no distinction and so makes rabbinic Jews and Christians resemble each other as theologians not just as Jews who lived and prac ticed in many of the same ways. Although Boyarin has succeeded in convincing us to rethink the "parting of the ways" and especially to be aware of some interplay between "Christianity" and (rabbinic) "Judaism," his thesis that the success of rabbinic Judaism owes much to the emergence of Christianity as the first true "religion" with an established ortho doxy is not ultimately compelling. The need for Christianity to establish an ortho dox front may have been heightened once it was in the driver's seat. Rabbinic Judaism, however, with its emphasis on a way of life rather than theological pre cision, and with its status (or lack of) as a minority religion (however one defines the term) had no such compulsion. CONCLUSION Although the three works examined here have distinct agendas, they share overlapping interests and concerns that relate to our understanding of the emergence of rabbinic Judaism. Belayche's presentation is the most straightforward, having as 76. For fuller discussion of the 'ammei ha-'arez and commoners in general, see Miller, Sages and Commoners, 301-38. 360</page><page sequence="33">Roman Imperialism, Jewish Self-Definition, and Rabbinic Society her goal a description, largely based on material evidence, of a Roman province that was "ordinary" except for the fact that it had a peculiar religious mix that included monotheistic expression. In Belayche's assessment, the rabbis were very much aware of the pagan environment in which they lived and responded to it accordingly. Schwartz, who is bothered by the ordinariness of Roman Palestine, repeatedly tells us that his aim is to provoke discussion with his revisionist views, which include the utter failure of Judaism after 132 CE, the developing notion of "religion," and the emergence, in the wake of Christianization, of rabbinic Judaism.77 Boyar?n is less focused than Belayche and Schwartz on the social, religious, and political situation in Iudaea-Palaestina and seeks to explain the emergence of Christianity and rabbinic Judaism in light of Schwartz's understanding of a "disembedded religion." Like Schwartz, Boyar?n sees his role, in his paraphrase of Michel Foucault, "to question, disturb, and dissipate [what is familiar]."78 Both Schwartz and Boyar?n are eminently successful at doing just that. But do their revisionist efforts lead to a more profound and more accurate assessment of the emergence of rabbinic Judaism? Surely, they are both determined to answer an essential question, one that has concerned scholars for some time: How is it that rabbinic Judaism, seemingly against great odds, succeeded to the extent that it would come to define Judaism as we know it? For both, this had to have taken place in the post-talmudic era, a time when the Christianization of the empire was essentially complete. For Schwartz, the earlier implosion of Judaism made the emergence of any form of Judaism earlier on impossible. For Boyar?n, the process of defining the other may have gotten off the ground earlier, but it was not yet mature enough to produce an orthodox Christianity or rabbinic Judaism. This is quite a turnaround from the position articulated a couple of gener ations ago by Saul Lieberman, who pointed to the assertion in Y Shevi'it 4, 35a that the Romans did not compel the Jews to transgress their religion? rather, "all they wanted was to collect the taxes." Lieberman goes on to assert that rabbinic literature gives no indication that the Romans inhibited Jewish religious observance in any way in the third and fourth centuries. Such persecution belonged to the doro shel shemad, the era of the restrictions under Hadrian. Lieber man 's view is worth quoting in full:79 The political situation of the Palestinian Jews for about two hundred and fifty years after the Hadrianic persecutions suffered no important changes. During that time the great monuments of learning were erected?the Mishna, the Tosefta, the Halakic Midrashim, the Palestinian Talmud, and many Aggadic Midrashim. In the middle of the third century, a famous Rabbi in Tiberias ordered the destruction of all the idols in the public bath of that city.80 At approximately the same time, Palestinian gentiles, most probably Christians, 77. Cf. Schwartz, "Some Types of Jewish-Christian Interaction in Late Antiquity," 204. 78. Boyarin, "Semantic Differences: or, 'Judaism'/'Christianity,'" 65. 79.

Miller paved the streets with pieces of idols demolished by them.81 Haifa century later, Diocletian confirmed the privileges of the Jews as a religious group.82 Lieberman draws attention to the rich literary legacy of the rabbis, which began to be produced during the period he describes. This has to be accounted for, as does the success of the type of Judaism that this literature depicts. In the geonic period, the asser tion would be constantly made that persecution in 'Erez Yisra 'el brought about the closure of the academies and the short-circuiting of the efforts to complete the Talmud Yerushalmi.83 Yet the post-talmudic era witnessed an increased, albeit different, literary productivity in 'Erez Yisra 'el that included halakhic and midrashic works, as well as liturgical poetry and targumim. Remarkably, the new midrashic works were devoted to the collecting of homilies of earlier Tannaim and Amoraim rather than the teachings of contemporary rabbis. Similarly, new halakhic writings did not produce fresh talmudic dialectic and tended to be dependent on earlier legal writings of the rabbis.84 Regardless of whether the Yavneh legend was a post-talmudic, Babylonian projection onto the long-ago past, from the perspective of the literature of 'Erez Yisra 'el from this later period, the earlier rabbis provided all that was necessary to live the life of a believing Jew. Some things had indeed changed under Christian rule, when rabbinic themes rum up on synagogue floors and in liturgical poetry, but these new forms of Jewish religious expression had to have been dependent on and inextricably bound up with earlier developments. Ultimately, the emergence and success of rabbinic Judaism owes much to antecedent, internal developments within the rabbinic movement that took place long before the onset of "Christianization" in the fourth century and were only poss ible because of a "complex common Judaism" that continued to exist. It is the dynamics of rabbinic disciple circles and households and the networks they formed that must be better understood if we are ever to fully appreciate how the sages managed, despite their admittedly insular interests, to evolve into a movement that defines Judaism to the present day.85 Fortunately, that work is well on its way.
