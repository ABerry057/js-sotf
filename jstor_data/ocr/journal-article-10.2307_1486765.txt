<plain_text><page sequence="1">Albert I. Baumgarten. The Flourishing of Jewish Sects in the Maccabean Era: An Interpretation. Supplements to the Journal for the Study of Judaism, vol. 55. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1997. xx, 240 pp. In this humane, well-informed, thought-provoking, and frustrating book, Albert Baumgarten attempts to explain why sectarianism flourished, as he believes, in Jewish Palestine of the Maccabean period. His approach is comparative. In particular, Baumgarten has done a tremendous amount of reading about the religious history of England in the seventeenth century, and he is also strongly influenced by Anglo-American structural-functionalist social theory, in which he is impressively knowledgeable. The comparative material occasionally misleads Baumgarten (see below), but it does not confine him. Indeed, one of the pleasures of the book is the eclecticism of its approach; its structural-functionalism is more an ethos, a self-conscious mark of its author's sympathy with the Past &amp; Present school, than raw material for the construction of still another reductive, oversimple model, generated from partial and undigested reading in a narrowly construed and reified social science. Baumgarten never forgets that he is writing about a society of humans. First, though, the problems. The chief of these is that, as Baumgarten himself notes in passing, almost nothing is known about the social aspects of sectarianism in the Maccabean period. Only for the first century C.E. is there anything like satisfactory, if still limited, information. Baumgarten deals with this problem by pretending that first-century evidence can be used unproblematically to reconstruct conditions of the second century B.C.E. This</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 375 is his avowed method in the long and wide-ranging first chapter, subtitled "a social description of ancient Jewish sectarianism." In the briefer third and fourth chapters, he argues that the rise of sectarianism in the second century B.C.E. was in part a result, as in early modem England, of urbanization and the consequent extension of literacy. This argument is in any case problematic, an instance where Baumgarten's parallels have led him astray. Certainly at no time in ancient Palestine was there anything remotely comparable in scale to the galloping urbanization of seventeenth-century Europe (by the end of the century the population of London reached one million--a figure no Western city had attained since the third century), or the geometric growth in literacy rates generated not only by bourgeoisification, but also by the Protestant Reformation and the invention of movable type. But to the extent that ancient Palestine did undergo a series of social changes meaningfully correlatable to the spread of sectarianism, it was only in the first century that their effects were palpable. In other words, Baumgarten was mistaken to conflate evidence from the first century with that from earlier periods, for reasons I will now briefly explore. Let us begin, as Baumgarten does, with the question of numbers. Josephus asserted that in the days of Herod there were six thousand Pharisees, and that (in his own day? but Philo reports the same number) the Essenes numbered four thousand. The Sadducees were certainly less numerous. Baumgarten, in common with many scholars, emphasizes that if these numbers are true, then the sectarians constituted only a small percentage of the Jewish population of Palestine as a whole in the first century, most responsibly estimated, following M. Broshi, at five hundred thousand.' But a more nuanced consideration of the numbers leads to very different conclusions. The sectarians were mainly concentrated in the district of Judea, though they were not entirely unknown in other districts of Palestine. Judea's population can scarcely have exceeded two hundred thousand, and was probably much smaller. If we suppose that the sectarians were adult males, as Baumgarten plausibly does, and further suppose, following most historical demographers, that adult males constituted about 30 percent of the population in premodern societies, then we come to the astonishing conclusion that in Judea in the late first century B.C.E. and/or the first century C.E., sectarians 1.

How can we make sense of this anomaly, which so blatantly contradicts the hypothesis of sectarian marginality shared by most scholars, including Baumgarten? The obvious solution is to suppose that Josephus's numbers are mistaken. In fact, this is almost certainly the case. The numbers can scarcely have been other than guesses, given the unlikelihood that Josephus had access to sectarian registers, if such documents ever existed. But are the numbers likely to be off by an order of magnitude, and how, anyway, can we be sure that they are not too low? In the end, we tend to evaluate the accuracy of numbers in ancient sources on the basis of their plausibility. Thus, Josephus's statement that 1,100,000 Jews died in the Roman siege of Jerusalem in 70 is generally dismissed, while his figure of 97,000 captives is treated with respect. But what is plausible when it comes to the sects? It seems to me that here Josephus's numbers should be taken seriously, at least heuristically. To make sense of them, we need to consider factors which Baumgarten neglects. Chief among these is that Palestinian Jewish society in the first century C.E., in the wake of the Hasmonean expansion, the Herodian con- solidation, and the pacification of the Mediterranean basin under the Roman principate (which among other things greatly eased communications between Palestine and the diaspora and enabled an explosive growth in pilgrimage), was vastly larger, wealthier, and geometrically more complex than it had been in the second and earlier first centuries B.C.E. Jerusalem was now transformed from a backwater into a metropolis, not only the goal of pilgrimage, but also the recipient of tremendous amounts of silver. While much of this investment may have been unproductive, as Martin Goodman emphasized, the remainder was enough to maintain a huge clerical and commercial establishment.2 Judea in the first century was thus characterized by an anomalous concen- tration of the well-to-do, and therefore presumably the literate, comparable to that in central Italy in the same period, though on a much smaller scale. Such people were often also pious-deriving their wealth, as they did, from the Temple and the interpretation of the Torah-and idle. There is no reason to think that Josephus was unique in having done next to nothing, by his own account, between the end of his adolescent experimentation with the sects and the outbreak of revolt ten years later, when he was twenty-nine years old. Young men like Josephus may have aspired to magistracies and 2.

That religious and, in the end, military adventurism of an at least mildly anti-establishment type should have proved attractive to great numbers of the well-off but underemployed youths of Judea seems under the circumstances unsurprising. These considerations imply that Jewish Palestine of the first century was a very different place from that of the second century B.C.E., and furthermore that the sects necessarily played very different roles in the two periods, and so they constitute a serious objection to Baumgarten's work, given his heavy dependence on first-century material. But Baumgarten begins his book with disarming modesty, presenting his account of the sects as a set of suggestions or hypotheses, intended to arouse interest and discussion, not as the single solution to the problem of their rise. As such, the book is in large part successful. The first chapter (provided we recall that its contents really concern the first century) is filled with novel and compelling observations. Baumgarten's remarks on the social backgrounds of the sectarians (mainly well-to-do rather than truly aristocratic, except perhaps for the Sadducees), on the reasons for their attraction to the sects, on the importance of individualism and a sense of personal choice among potential sectarians, should find general acceptance. And his departures from the consensus concerning the exclusive role of halakhic disagreement in generating sectarianism, and the excellent observation, buried in a footnote, that even calendrical disagreements are not sufficient cause for sectarian division should be widely discussed (I believe Baumgarten is right in both cases). Perhaps the strongest chapter is the second, rather misleadingly entitled "The Encounter with Hellenism." In fact, it is basically phenomenological, exploring the ways in which sectarian rules functioned to mark the bound- aries between the sects and the wider Jewish community, and between the different sectarian groups. The chapter also diffidently advances the thesis that disappointment with the Hasmoneans' incomplete disengagement from their gentile neighbors and overlords was an important factor in the rise of sectarianism--a thesis which seems to me unobjectionable; in any case, the chapter's importance is independent of its thesis. The final major chapter, on millenarianism, is complementary, arguing, through the convincing deployment of much comparative material, that it was the partial success of the Hasmoneans that helped produce the eschatological concerns of some of the sects, just as it helped motivate their separatism.</page><page sequence="5">378 BOOK REVIEWS Baumgarten's insistence that millenarianism need not be the last resort of the dispossessed-he speaks (p. 164) of "the millenarianism of the victors, not the vanquished"--is obviously correct and by now something of a truism among scholars with even the slightest sympathetic acquaintance with sociology. It is less clear why Baumgarten rejects the traditional "relative deprivation" to account for the appeal of millenarianism only to replace it with "cognitive dissonance," which is comparably unspecific and so comparably weak in its explanatory force. How many people, even in most premodern societies, are not relatively dispossessed, or do not suffer from cognitive dissonance, that is, are not happy as they feel they deserve to be? The problems with The Flourishing of Jewish Sects are not trivial, but neither are its accomplishments. Baumgarten's argument may be summarized as follows: the three main sects were essentially mainstream phenomena, populated by the relatively well-to-do, who were mainly, at least early on, responding to the fact that their lives really weren't so bad (though they could have been better), by adopting similar sets of sometimes extreme positions on issues that mattered to all Jews. Though this argument should have been made more explicitly, its cumulative force is considerable. I happen to think it is mainly correct, notwithstanding the problematic details. More significant than the content of his argument is Baumgarten's embrace of comparison as a method, and his openness to social anthropology. Ancient Judaists tacitly and in an untheorized way often regard their subject as unique, operating according to its own rules.' Would it be too much to hope that Baumgarten's colleagues might learn from the lesson that he teaches so gently and, in the final analysis, so well, that the best way to begin to make sense of the Jews is to attend not only to their particularities, but also to the ways in which they are a society like any other?
