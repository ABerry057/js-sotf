Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2000. xiv, 365 pp. In Witness from the Pulpit, Marc Saperstein, a leading expert on the art of Jewish preaching in medieval and modern times, took on the personally reward- ing and professionally challenging task of assembling, editing, and commenting upon the sermons of a twentieth-century American Reform rabbi, of "mid-level" national leadership stature, who had "a rather extraordinary personal involvement ... in twentieth-century Jewish history." The reward was to make available for scholarly consideration the homiletic messages that Harold Saperstein delivered during his forty-seven years (1933-1980) as spiritual leader of Lynbrook, New York's Temple Emanu-El as a source for understanding how a rabbi communicat- ed with, and educated, his community about the great crises that the Jewish peo- ple faced in that tumultuous time-span. The challenge was to present and analyze objectively what his own father had done, without an almost understandable de- gree of filiopietism. Happily, Sapersteinfils chose well in documenting how one rabbi attempted to raise worshipper consciousness about the destruction of Euro- pean Jewry, the rise and perils of the State of Israel and the struggles for Soviet Jewry, as well as central post-war American issues like the battle for Civil Rights, McCarthyism, civil unrest and the tragedy of Vietnam, and more. Harold Saper- stein's views are introduced with calm, dispassion, and clarity. Of course, a compendium of sermons, by its very nature, allows us only to "listen in" on a preacher and not really to determine how his/her message was 167</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews heard. Still, Marc Saperstein makes a valiant effort in his notes to begin to evoke the general American and specifically the Lynbrook moods that "triggered [ his fa- ther's ] messages." For example, in introducing "The American Dream, in Color," he did an outstanding job in noting the tenor of local town attitudes in 1963 toward the busing designed to ensure school desegregation in Malverne, where Saperstein lived, even if he could not tell us how Temple Emanu-El people reacted to his fa- ther's strong advocacy of equality for all Americans. All told, Marc Saperstein has produced a highly accessible volume that, if analyzed with comparable sources from similar times and locales, will afford us important vistas into how Jews in pre-war and post-war suburbia viewed the external Jewish and American worlds around them. There is, however, a remarkable lacuna in the range of themes documented and discussed in this compendium, which will frustrate students of American Ju- daism. Arguably, Harold Saperstein, part of that first generation of Neo-Reform rabbis produced at Rabbi Stephen S. Wise's Jewish Institute of Religion, had to have presided over and participated in the reorientation of that denomination to- wards Jewish tradition and ancient ritual. And, as a rabbi in suburbia, for more than two generations, he had to have faced up to such weighty "internal" Jewish issues like the challenge of assimilation in social environs where Jews were accepted and the ongoing battle to find ways and means of attracting the disaffected back to Jew- ish identification. Yet, this compendium says little about what Emanu-El's rabbi- a self-described "pioneer in what is now called the 'creative service' "-said to his flock about his feelings concerning "the deep-seated problems" Judaism faced "in a non-religious age." Only two sermons-including the one from which I have just quoted briefly-even begin to address these questions. The one sermon presented here where Saperstein spoke extensively about the challenges and frustrations of the rabbi's mission to reach disinterested American Jews took place "off campus," when this senior rabbi was invited to speak at the 1972 HUC-JIR Ordination Cer- emony at New York's Temple Emanu-El. There, in front of that class of new rab- bis-including his son and future editor, Marc-he implicitly addressed the find- ings of that year's famous Lenn study (Rabbi and Synagogue in Reform Judaism) and asserted candidly that "our generation has in large measure lost the sense of necessity and value of prayer" (p. 297). One wonders whether and how often Harold Saperstein spoke so openly "at home" about the meaningfulness of prayer in Lynbrook's Temple or of the efficacy of new forms of worship as a means of reaching out to the unaffiliated within his own midst. Such comments-if they were offered-would have helped us better gauge how Judaism was then doing on the frontiers of suburbia. And it would have made Witness from the Pulpit an even more valuable source for studying American Jewish life in the mid-decades of the twentieth century. Jeffrey S.
