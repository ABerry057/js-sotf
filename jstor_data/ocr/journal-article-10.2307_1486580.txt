Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1990. xiv, 164 pp. This dissertation, written under Eric Meyers at Duke University and com- pleted in 1988, does not, despite its title, aim at elucidating the background, meaning, theological uniqueness, and rhetorical artistry of the scathing attacks against the Israelite priesthood found in the prophecies of Malachi. Rather, it addresses a strictly historical-critical question: where does Malachi fit in to the history of the priesthood? O'Brien argues at length that no conclusive answer can be given. As her starting point O'Brien accepts the axiom, acknowledged since the rise of Pentateuchal criticism, that the Deuteronomic and Priestly sources advocate two opposing doctrines on the question of who may serve as a priest: D seeks to enfranchise the entire tribe of Levi more or less equally,</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 289 while P prohibits all but the direct descendants of Aaron from serving as priests, relegating the rest of the levitical tribe to the rank of second-class clerics. She assumes further, as do most scholars, that these two irreconcilable positions represent stages in the development of the clergy. She also accepts the classical scholarly method: the attempt to arrange the two positions sequentially (generally favoring the priority of D) and to suggest a historical explanation for the change in the composition of the priesthood. For this purpose, all references to the priesthood-including those in Malachi-must be accounted for, and each must be given its place in the evolutional scheme. We would do well to consider all this more critically. For while P and D do refer differently to the structure of the priesthood, neither of them places this item on its polemical or legislative agenda. P simply assumes a two-tiered structure and describes the functions of each caste; D simply does not. Neither advocates, and neither argues against the opposing view. We may speak of D and P as having different assumptions, different emphases, and different degrees of interest-perhaps even of accuracy--concerning the composition of the priesthood, but there is no a priori reason for assigning them a linear relationship. Here as elsewhere, the two sources represent two distinct, more or less contemporary, schools of thought and literary creativity, and there is little justification-other than slavish adherence to Wellhausenian doctrine-for seeing one as a reaction to the other. Any historical reconstruction must take into account that in many cases the differences between the sources are evidence not of development but of diversity. Only when there is literary evidence of a relationship can the two be used for positing evolutionary stages. Following a survey of scholarly opinion on the history of the priesthood (chap. 1), four separate lines of inquiry are taken up. Chapter 2 considers the exegetical question of whether Malachi's references to "the priests," "Levi," "the sons of Levi," and "the Levite" presume the essential identity of all of these or not. O'Brien concludes that Malachi shows no evidence of any distinction, either in pedigree, privilege, or function. In chapter 3, a form-critical analysis of Malachi is conducted, in order to determine whether the book is a structural unity. O'Brien answers in the affirmative. Chapter 4 seeks to determine Malachi's relationship to the Pentateuchal sources. The book's familiarity with D is conceded, and, somewhat less readily, O'Brien admits that Malachi indicates knowledge of P as well. Almost all of chapter 5 is a survey of opinion concerning the date of Malachi, in which the sixth-century dating is upheld. All these conclusions, I believe, are correct.</page><page sequence="3">290 BOOK REVIEWS However, O'Brien arrives at them in a manner which is often labored, occasionally perplexing, and too frequently imprecise. Much of chapter 2, for instance, is gratuitous. A reader who can appreciate the crucial importance of the fact that Malachi speaks of both Levites and priests as performing altar functions does not need much more. O'Brien has gone too much further, and in so doing embraces dubious interpretations, such as her reading of wn6?i'tm panim batt6rdh (2:9) as "have not shown favor with torah" and of lihy6t berift 'et l1wt (2:4) as "that my covenant with Levi might (continue to) be." The form-critical analysis in chapter 3 is especially problematic. Because scholars never seem to tire of searching for the Gattung and its Sitz im Leben, they are frustrated when this results in a realization such as that arrived at by Malachi scholarship to date: that the prophet's style is one of "disputation," and that this style originates in "everyday speech." This disappointment should lead the scholar to reexamine the method. Instead, O'Brien simply suggests another Gattung: the rib-pattern. But if a series of accusations and threats make a rfb, then every prophecy of rebuke is a rfb and form-critical distinctions are meaningless. The fact that some of the prophet's accusations are directed against commands found in the Book of the Covenant hardly makes the book a "covenant lawsuit." O'Brien herself admits that the identifying features of the prophetic lawsuit-the invocation of immortal witnesses, the courtroom situation-are absent. Further, I am not entirely certain that this chapter has any direct relevance to the theme of the book; O'Brien simply may have felt that no study of a biblical book is complete without a form-critical discussion. Chapter 4 considers the biblical sources employed by Malachi. Here, too, the overall conclusion is persuasive but the argumentation often faulty. Most of the book's numerous affinities with D are ruled out as not exclusively Deuteronomic phraseology. This is unfortunate: what is decisive is the cluster of Deuteronomic ideas and phrases and the similarity of usage and context. The one item retained is the least valid: Malachi's use of Sillah (instead of gjrjsD for "divorce." This term is not peculiarly Deuteronomic, it is simply nonpriestly; it serves only to distinguish D and P from each other. For her proof, therefore, O'Brien is forced to rely on the supposed affinities with D found in the book's concluding verses-which most scholars consider to be redactional. Similarly with P: though O'Brien affirms Malachi's reliance on P, she contests most of the more obvious connections. The reader will find very complete surveys of opinion on every issue, in</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 291 which the most recent studies, even those unpublished, are given attention. And yet, often it seems that O'Brien attaches equal weight to every opinion, taking serious note of suggestions which can readily be dismissed and arguing in favor of the obvious, and that she is reluctant to state almost anything on her own authority, preferring to poll the critics and side either with the majority or the most recent view. As an example of the latter, in discussing Malachi's date (chap. 5), she comes close to accepting a recent suggestion that the book may be exilic or even pre-exilic. This requires a denial of the book's similarity to other post-exilic literature. But post-exilic concerns and conditions are so apparent in the prophet's message that they cannot be argued away. O'Brien concludes that Malachi created a unique literary concept, a divine "covenant with Levi" modeled after earlier, patriarchal and royal, covenant themes, and used it for a unique purpose-to lambast the contemporary priesthood's neglect of proper sacrifice. I could not agree more. Moreover, this literary construct explains why he calls the priests "Levites" and "sons of Levi"-not itself an illegitimate term, since Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Trito- Isaiah call them this as well, and since, after all, they are. O'Brien is right that Malachi is not interested in the question of who may be a priest, and cannot be placed in a developmental scheme vis-t-vis the Pentateuchal sources which he clearly employs. A preferable formulation might be that Malachi accepts D's idea of who a priest is, and P's idea of what a priest is. Baruch J. Schwartz Tel Aviv University Ramat Aviv, Israel</page></plain_text>
