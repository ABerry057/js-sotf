Lei- den: Brill, 2003. xiv, 176 pp. In the present study, Hindy Najman addresses two fundamental aspects re- lated to Second Temple Jewish literature: pseudepigrapha and the rewritten Bible. Pseudepigrapha as a literary genre signifies texts which claim as their author some privileged individual from the past. In reality, however, the attribution of author- ship to some ancient figure masks the present-day composition of the text. The term rewritten Bible, in its broadest use, refers to the interpretive reworking of the scriptural text and story through such means as expansion, deletion, harmoniza- tion, and conflation. The final product retains the narrative sequence of the scrip- tural account though in a significantly modified form. Both of these literary techniques seemingly have at their base a manipulation and subversion of the in- tegrity of the scriptural story and text. Pseudepigrapha asserts for a latter day au- thor the authority and prestige of an ancient figure; rewritten Bible presents itself as a new and improved scripture. Najman's study sets out to explore the nature of the relationship between the older text and the current reworked version. Is the latter intended to replace and supersede the former, deliberately passed off as an ancient text in order to attain authority for the current composition? (2-3). Indeed, most contemporary scholar- ly approaches assume that the anonymous authors obscured their own contribu- tions "to secure for new myths or laws an authority that they would not otherwise possess" (4). However, as Najman observes, much of our reading of ancient texts is conditioned by modem conceptions of authorship and text production. She ar- gues that we must inquire how the ancient writers who hid their labors behind pseudepigraphic ciphers or "rewritten" narratives conceived of their own role in the creation and continued production of scriptural writings (10). Namely, what do the texts themselves reveal about their compositional intentions and the relation- ship between the reworked text and its scriptural base? Najman focuses her study on a restricted corpus of literature-those that center on the figure of Moses. Here she has in mind works that assume for them- selves Mosaic authorship (Deuteronomy and Jubilees) and those in which Moses is portrayed as crucial to the text production (the Temple Scroll and the relevant sections of Philo discussed). Deuteronomy, itself an elaboration of other parts of the Torah, is the earliest text to assume for itself Mosaic authorship. Ascription of 367</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Mosaic authority and authorship continues in the exilic and postexilic periods and is most apparent in Moses' elevated status in Second Temple texts. In light of the questions discussed above, should one see a work such as Jubilees as a "fraudu- lent" attempt to subvert and usurp the authority of the Torah? All the more so, is Deuteronomy the "pious fraud" that early source critics assumed it to be? Drawing on the insights of Michael Foucault, Najman suggests that the Mo- saic texts should best be understood as an "example of discourses that are inextri- cably linked to their founders" (12). In such discourses, later authors claim to possess the authentic understanding of the founder. In ancient societies, ascribing one's work to the founder provided the most effective way of authenticating one's own understanding. Najman cites the self-reflective remarks of lamblichus and Tertullian to this effect (12-13). For Najman, Mosaic Discourse seeks "to rework an earlier text in a way that one claims to be an authentic expression of the law al- ready accepted as authoritatively Mosaic" (13). Thus, ascribing a contemporary law or ideology to Moses is not a subversive appropriation of Mosaic authority. Rather, as a participant in an ongoing Mosaic Discourse, the author is asserting that the present text is in accord with the authentic teachings of Moses. What qualifies a text as a participant in this Mosaic Discourse? Najman identifies four features that must be present, or somehow alternatively represent- ed, for a text to be classified as a contributor to ongoing Mosaic Discourse (16- 17): (1) the new text assumes the authority associated with the earlier reworked and expanded tradition; (2) the new text presumes a status as Torah; (3) the new text sees itself as a re-presentation of the revelation at Sinai; (4) the new text is as- cribed to Moses either as the author or as a significant figure. With this model, Najman examines Deuteronomy, Jubilees, the Temple Scroll, and the portions of Philo that treat Moses to determine the nature of their participation in this ongoing Mosaic Discourse. Deuteronomy represents the first attempt to engage in this Mosaic Discourse; it, in turn, provides the model for all later participants. Likewise, Najman argues that Jubilees and the Temple Scroll, though presented as pseudepigraphic rewritten Bible, are not intended to replace earlier Mosaic traditions. Rather, as participants in the Second Temple period Mo- saic Discourse, they supplement earlier Mosaic traditions. In doing so, they claim to possess the correct interpretation and understanding of earlier Mosaic traditions, namely the Torah. Najman also places Philo as a participant in Mosaic Discourse, though admittedly in a dramatically different fashion than either Jubilees or the Temple Scroll. Like Jubilees and the Temple Scroll, Philo sees himself as "an in- spired interpreter, initiated by Moses," whose own interpretations are "copies of Mosaic originals" (107). Though other aspects of the Mosaic Discourse model are not present, this is enough to mark Philo as a participant in the Mosaic Discourse of the Second Temple period. Najman has presented a provocative thesis. Based on the model developed, Najman demonstrates the existence of an ongoing Mosaic Discourse in Second Temple Judaism. It remains to be seen whether such a model can successfully be applied to other types of literature and the existence of other sustained discourses can be established. In doing so, we must caution against typological definitions that span across broad corpora of literature. The employment of pseudepigrapha 368</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews and the practice of rewritten Bible need not be universal through time and space. Nonetheless, Najman's finding have set the stage for a rethinking of commonly held assumptions about pseudepigrapha, rewritten Bible, and the general cate- gories of Second Temple Jewish literature.
