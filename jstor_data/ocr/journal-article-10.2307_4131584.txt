Mod- ern Hebrew Classics. ix, 299 pp. Hayyim Nahman Bialik (1873-1934) is widely regarded-especially in Is- rael-as the national poet of the Jewish people. Bialik's poems express not only his own deeply conflicted emotions but also the ambivalence of a generation of Jews caught between the breakdown of traditional Jewish life and the call of a new Jewish world whose outlines could be but dimly perceived. While these poems explore a wide range of subjects, almost all of them have the ring of Romanticism. Part of the appeal of Bialik's poems is that they speak the language of the heart rather than the language of the head. If Bialik is to be criti- cized in this regard, one might say that at times his pathos edges perilously close to bathos. In their recent translation, Random Harvest: The Novellas of Bialik, David Patterson and Ezra Spicehandler have given the English reader an opportunity to hear Bialik speak in another voice. In the five short stories and one extended leg- end in this collection (none of them a novella, in my estimation), Bialik keeps a certain intellectual distance from his subject. The balance between head and heart has shifted from what we find in his poetry; in these prose pieces we have more head and less heart. In his prose voice, Bialik reveals a capacity for satire, humor, and a wry playfulness that is much less evident in his poetry. This difference in voice is least apparent in the opening selection, Random Harvest (Safiach), an incomplete work of autobiographical fiction written in stages between 1908 and 1923, when-oddly enough-Bialik completed Chapter 1. Much of this piece echoes his poetry. Already in the second paragraph one en- counters imagery reminiscent of his poem Levadi ("By Myself"): Like a forsaken fledgling, I wandered alone about my nest; my father and mother left me to myself and there was no one else to look after me. Then God in His mercy took me under the shelter of His wings... (p. 22). 170</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews By way of contrast, in Behind the Fence (Me-achorey ha-Gader), the second story in the collection, we "hear" a Bialik who is more detached from his subject. He tells a modern version of Romeo and Juliet, star-crossed lovers separated by a physical fence which symbolizes the impossible barriers of different religions, dif- ferent socio-economic classes, different cultures. With an almost chilling irony, Bialik concludes his tale not with a tragic bang but rather with a banal whimper. In the end, the "hero" Noah rejects his beloved shiksah Marinka and settles for "a proper virgin, the daughter of a tax collector" (p. 131). Big Harry (Aryeh Baal Guf), written in 1898 when Bialik was still in his mid-twenties, satirizes a certain kind of rich but mindless boor who in our gener- ation has been the butt of the acerbic wit of Philip Roth. Towards the end of this character sketch Bialik describes a "spread" which Harry and his social-climbing wife Hannah prepare for their housewarming; the scene is as familiar as those over- done wedding or bar mitzvah receptions in which the overriding halakhic question turns out to be: Is it kosher to eat like a pig? The Shamed Trumpet (Ha-Chatsotserah Nitbayeshah) is a fictionalized ac- count of the banishment of a Jewish family from the Pale as a consequence of the "Temporary May Laws" of 1882. Writing thirty-three years after the event, Bialik makes his story all the more tragic by telling it with a restraint made possible by the temporal distance of more than three decades. In endowing a Russian army trumpet with a sense of shame, Bialik demonstrates yet again the fecundity of his artistic imagination. The fifth story in the collection, Short Friday (Yom ha-Shishi ha-Katsar), which appeared in 1909, stands on the other end of the emotional spectrum from the oppressive sadness of The Shamed Trumpet. Short Friday is a light, zany farce that has the feel of a TV sitcom. Reb Lippa is not so much a character as a carica- ture of a country bumpkin rebbe. Readers can laugh at the twists and turns of the far-fetched plot because we do not invest our emotions in Reb Lippa's self-inflict- ed predicament. Throughout the story Reb Lippa remains an object of our tolerant ridicule-never a subject demanding our sympathy. The first five translations in Random Harvest are found under the rubric of Sippurim in the frequently reprinted Hebrew volume of Bialik's collected works published by D'vir. The sixth and final translation, The Legend of the Three and the Four (Aggadat Shloshah v'Arba 'ah) falls under the rubric of Divrei Aggadah and the sub-rubric of Me 'aggadot ha-Melekh Shlomo. The text is the second ver- sion of this narrative, written in Germany in 1929. The Hebrew of The Legend of the Three and the Four differs markedly from the five preceding stories. Bialik in- vents an archaic quasi-Biblical style; he begins almost every paragraph of this ful- ly vocalized text with a vav-consecutive and employs a spare and limited vocabu- lary. It is to the credit of our translators that they are able to capture something of Bialik's deliberately artificial language. Like all legends, The Legend of the Three and the Four can be read on many different levels. At this time of continued strife between Jew and Arab, I am especially moved by Bialik's prophetic call for mak- ing peace between ancient enemies. Near the very end of the story, he puts these words into the mouth of King Solomon, who is speaking at the wedding feast cel- 171</page><page sequence="3">AJS Review ebrating the marriage of Netanyah, a diaspora Jew, to Ketziyah, the daughter of the King of Aram: Our ancestors hated one another but are long since gone; their hatred and their jealousy have died with them. Shall we, their sons, maintain that enmity forever? See now, the joviality of friends and the happiness of love bursting all about you. ... Hate is indeed deeper than the pit, but love is more powerful and stronger than hate and can overcome it! When love pours its spirit upon man, it returns him to his primordial state, as God created him. He no longer keeps petty accounts. (p. 281) One test of a good translation is that the reader forgets that he is in fact read- ing a translation. For the most part David Patterson and Ezra Spicehandler pass this test with distinction. Unfortunately, the very first sentence of the entire col- lection misses the mark: I cannot remember how many summers and winters passed from the earliest moments I can recall in my native village until the time when my family took me to live in a suburb of the nearby town. (p. 21) To an American reader suburb seems out of place-conjuring up images of crowd- ed shopping malls and oversized SUVs. For some reason Patterson and Spicehan- dler consistently render the Hebrewparbar as suburb, even though outskirts would be far more appropriate for the Ukrainian setting of small towns and villages. Lat- er on in this same story, we bump into the following sentence: At twilight on that happy day, when my joy overwhelmed me and I could not restrain it, I ran outside to noise my greatness abroad. (p. 47) The Hebrew reads levaser et gedulati ba-rabim, literally, "to proclaim my great- ness among the many." Certainly in this context there are a number of choices less clumsy than "To noise my greatness abroad." To be fair, an occasional awkward moment is to be expected within almost three hundred pages of translation. On bal- ance David Patterson and Ezra Spicehandler deserve our praise and gratitude for enabling the English reader to listen to the strong and distinctive prose voices of Hayyim Nahman Bialik. A twenty-page general introduction, a short introduction to each of the six selections, a glossary, and a brief bibliography help round out our picture of the national poet of the Jewish people.
