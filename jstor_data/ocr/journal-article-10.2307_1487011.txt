"One of the most important, representative, revelatory works of Austria at the turn of the century. .... The best English version of the novel." -Marc A.

Chazan's masterly analysis recon- structs the Barcelona disputation from the conflicting Christian and Jewish sources and sets it in its broad historical context, with particular attention to the post- disputation maneuvers on both sides. His richly detailed account focuses on Rabbi ben Nahman's eloquent efforts to reassure his fellow Jews in the face of new missionizing pressures. $40.00 cloth At bookstores or order toll-free 1-800-822-6657.

In an analysis of some 100 individual passages of direct speech the study endeavours to provide fresh insight into the literary and exegetical characteristics of targum. 1992. 220 pages (est.)

ISBN 3-16-145643-2 cloth $86.50 (est.) - February David Instone Brewer Techniques and Assumptions in Jewish Exegesis before 70 CE This survey of Jewish exegesis during the era of Herod's Temple comes to some startling conclusions about the techniques and assumptions used by these early exegetes. The scribal predecessors of the rabbis in Palestine did not use allegory, did not ignore the context and did not read the text differently to suit their interpretation. However, Jewish inter- preters in Alexandria, Qumran, and Rabbis after 70 CE did all these things. 1991. 312 pages (est.) (Texte und Studien zum Antiken Judentum 30). ISBN 3-16-145803-6 cloth $144.50 (est.) - January Walter T. Wilson Love without Pretense Romans 12.9-21 and Hellenistic-Jewish Wisdom Literature This study investigates the literary com- position and ethical message of Romans 12.9-21 against the background of ancient wisdom literature, with special emphasis on the gnomic materials of Hellenistic Judaism. The analysis suggests that, contrary to most modern interpretations, this passage is not a random assortment of common precepts only weakly connected with its context, but has been carefully designed and integrated into the letter by Paul, who takes advantage of various literary, rethorical, and ethical ideas and methods familiar from sapiential writings. 1991.

Translated into English by Goldie Wachsman The author explores the life and work of Rafael Mordekhai Malki. Born and raised a catholic in Christian Europe, Malki returned to the Jewish fold and later settled in the Holy City of Jerusalem, where he spent the last twenty-five years of his life as a devout Jew. His social philosophy is an attempt to create an ideal model of society for a nation without a country. 1992. 200 pages (est.) (Texts and Studies in Medieval and Early Modern Judaism).
