<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review 28:1 (2004), 157-172 THE FIGURE OF MOSES IN MODERN HEBREW POETRY* by Malka Shaked From its inception in the Enlightenment to this day, modern Hebrew poetry conveys a deep connection to the Bible that manifests itself in a variety of ways. An in-depth understanding of this connection-including its various expressions in content and language, its causes, its purposes, and its manifestations in all the literary genres, in each generation and for each individual writer-would require extensive research that could profitably occupy a large number of scholars. None- theless, even with the limited research that I have conducted, focusing on the place of the Bible in Hebrew poetry from the generation of national renaissance to the present time, the substantial anthology of poems that I am preparing for this pur- pose' demonstrate clearly that modern Hebrew poetry constantly returns to the Bible, and that the Bible's oft-lamented decline in stature in Israeli society is nowhere to be seen. Still, it becomes apparent that poetry's connection to the Bible is not mono- lithic: It is complex and multifaceted. Sometimes poetry turns to the Bible to fill the latter's gaps. (Gap-filling, as we have learned from Erich Auerbach's famous study of the art of the classical story versus that of the Bible, with which he begins his book Mimesis, is an activity demanded by the very nature of the biblical sto- ry.) Sometimes poetry goes the way of traditional exegesis and interprets the Bible in order to understand it in accordance with the Bible's own intent; while at other times, it interprets the Bible in the manner of early midrash, that is, in order to ex- press new content. Sometimes it interprets the Bible in a manner contrary to the latter's intent, confronting the Bible, arguing with it, criticizing it, and taking issue with it; at other times it employs the Bible freely and overtly uses it not in order to explicate it, but to satisfy ulterior personal or societal needs that arise in the writ- er's present. In those poems that seem to deal with the Bible directly-hewing to it close- ly with the objective of illuminating the biblical subject matter for its own sake- the poet's attitude toward the Bible can be seen only indirectly, through the way in which he or she describes the often-dramatized biblical world. By contrast, in those poems that are suspended from the biblical text as from a tree, the poet is general- ly the speaker and reveals his or her attitude explicitly. In practice, however, a poem * Translated by Harvey N. Bock. 1.

We must accordingly bear in mind that in either case-not only when the poet writes directly about himself or expresses his mood and stance in relation to the world with the help of the Bible, but also when he writes about subjects and figures from the Bible, and even when such figures are presented as speaking in the first person-the poet is dealing with something he regards as central, important, fundamental, and symbolic, the ap- prehension of which, regardless of whether its expression in the poem is indirect and covert or direct and open, is what sheds fresh, new light on the Bible itself. On the other hand, the very fact of recourse to the Bible in these two ways, even when minimal, makes a significant impression because it bestows upon the poet's expe- riences and views a dimension of mythological depth and an augmented forceful- ness. Accordingly, whether we are dealing with poems that are more closely linked to the Bible or those more closely linked to the poet, it is appropriate to ask how the poet sees the biblical subject matter, as well as, on the other hand, what the poet is saying about himself and what the larger, meta-personal significance of his state- ment is. I will attempt to answer these questions by examining a single topic from among the vast number of biblical topics of modern Hebrew poetry: the figure of Moses. I hope that despite its limited scope, this discussion will provide for the reader a certain grasp of the place of the Bible in modern Hebrew poetry. The figure of Moses, which more than any other determined the character of Jewish identity and the beginning of monotheism and which straddles four of the five books of the Torah, has drawn the attention of thinkers, writers, and poets since time immemorial. Freud's last book, Moses and Monotheism (1939), pub- lished in the final year of his life; Martin Buber's Moses (1946); and the Yiddish novel Moses by Shalom Asch (1951), attest to the interest that the figure and ac- tivity of Moses stirred even among non-Hebrew-writing twentieth-century schol- ars and authors. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that the figure of Moses occupies a cen- tral place in the Tehiyah period and in modern Hebrew literature. Moses is one of the few biblical figures who inspired not only belletristic writing but critical thought, as well, during the period. In 1889, the Sons of Moses (B'nei Moshe) So- ciety was established on the seventh of the Hebrew month Adar, its establishment timed to coincide with the traditional date of Moses' birth. In the opening words of the society's charter, Ahad Ha'am, one of the society's founders, explains its at- tachment to the figure of Moses: "The society shall be called 'The Sons of Moses Society,' as a signal to all members that they should always look to this elect of our people and examine all that he did and suffered on account of his love for his peo- ple, so that they may know what such love requires of them";2 and in supplemen- tary remarks Ahad Ha'am clarifies that the society's goal is "to increase and 2.

Fifteen years later, Ahad Ha'am published his essay "Moses" (1904), in which he analyzed in depth the figure of Moses as the histor- ical leader who laid the spiritual foundations for the Jewish people's development. This essay is not only one of the most important of the Tehiyah period, but one whose influence continued for generations. Modern Hebrew poetry began to deal with the figure of Moses as early as the end of the eighteenth century. Moses was the main character in the first epic of Enlightenment poetry, Weisel's "Songs of Glory" (nixwnn 'l'lw),4 and later in the Enlightenment poem of Micah Joseph Lebensohn (Michal), "Moses on Mount Abarim" (tava vn i~n .v nvn; 1851). During the Tehiyah period and in its wake, poetry naturally continued to deal with the life and activity of the national leader in various ways, direct and metaphorical, as poems of H. N. Bialik, David Frischman, Jacob Fichman, Rachel, Abraham Shlonsky, Yitzhak Katznelson, and S. Shalom attest; and this has continued, right through the pre-state and statehood periods, to this very day. Alexander Pen's unfinished poem," and poems of Nathan Alterman, Uri Zevi Greenberg, Amir Gilboa, Moshe Dor, Yehiel Mar, Dov Chom- sky, Aryeh Sivan, Pinhas Sadeh, Avot Yeshurun, Rivka Miriam, S. Shalom, Rachel Halfi, Yitzhak Laor, Aharon Amir, Yehudah Amichai, Eran Bar Gil, and Roni Somek, all attest that in poetry, at least, Moses remains alive and well in various forms, and that even in poems that treat him critically his "burial" is as yet un- known. These and other dozens of poems that deal with Moses in one way or an- other6 reflect, of course, varied and shifting moods, and even dramatic turnabouts, as is to be expected as a result of generational changes as well as differences among individual poets. The biblical narrative data make it possible for each generation to attach its own values and wishes to the figure of Moses. Enlightenment poetry depicts Moses as a great leader who shapes his people in an Enlightenment spirit, while the Tehiyah period draws typically Tehiyah-period ideas from the Bible's sto- ry of Moses, such as leaving behind the Diaspora and enslavement, emigration to the Land of Israel, creation of a national entity, and putting in place a powerful na- tional leadership. On the other hand, since Tehiyah-period poetry at its best is very much the poetry of individuals, individual feelings such as embitterment, disap- pointment, surrender, and tragic frustration, all of which emerge from interpreta- tion of the biblical story, are also attached to the figure of Moses. Later poetry utilizes other data from the biblical narrative to reveal new insights that are at times 3. Supplementary to "Derech haChayim," Kol Kitvei, 440. 4. This epic was published in segments from 1789 to 1811 and includes eighteen poems that the poet says "recite the praise of God and His wonders performed for our ancestors when He took them from Egypt and brought them to Mount Sinai." 5. Of the poem "Moses," written in 1948-1949 and planned for five chapters, only three chap- ters were published.

See the list of poems in the Appendix. 159</page><page sequence="4">Malka Shaked surprising and even controversial. The following stroll through several poems will shed some light on these matters. In Bialik's poem, "Atop Harel" (?rcxn WrtK .v; 1893, on Moses' traditional date of birth and the anniversary of the founding of the Sons of Moses [rnwn '1:] Society), Moses is described as standing on a mountaintop while still holding in his left hand "a powerful staff" and in his right hand the two tablets of the Ten Com- mandments; but his primary greatness stems from his spiritual and moral strength, which is the source of his physical power. The basis for this description is the bib- lical account of the war between Amalek and Israel (Ex. 17:8-13), whose inter- textual incorporation is evident in several of the poem's descriptive details,7 which the poet supplemented from his imagination. While the two giants who are men- tioned in the poem want to steal the tablets from Moses, physically fight with him and conduct a "battle" against him "with axe and spear," he is a hoary old man who raises his hands in prayer. He is girded not with lethal weapons but with "cloud tops." His face radiates "a glowing light" and his eyes look "like two dawn eye- lids." The look he directs at his enemies "from above" expresses true moral supe- riority, as he looks at them "with righteous humility." By dint of this spiritual-moral posture, he defeats the two giants who are battling him and trying to steal the tablets from him. At the end of the poem, the giants kneel before him because they are overcome by his spiritual greatness, which they acknowledge.8 The presentation of the figure of Moses as a hero who overcomes his ene- mies by virtue of his faith and spiritual-moral values reflects, first and foremost, the traditional Jewish understanding that is thoroughly expressed in the biblical ac- count and in the associated midrash.9 Still, the very selection of a biblical story that deals with overcoming enemies primarily on the basis of faith in spiritual val- ues reveals a fundamental, Ahad-Ha'am-like assumption of the Tehiyah move- ment. Bialik again deals with Moses' greatness in his poem "The Last Deaths of the Desert" (ta~s nxT n1-nt arnn; 1897); here, too, the Tehiyah movement's view is reflected, but in a form that is more complex and more distinctive of Bialik. In this poem, the direct longing for Tehiyah is "projected" not on the figure of Moses but on that of Joshua, Moses' successor as leader. Joshua is presented dramatically as a speaker who is addressing the people, in an overtly Tehiyah-style speech in which he issues a call of encouragement to the people to leave behind the desert and "the 7. The poem's title and the words "in his left hand a strong staff" echo the biblical words, "To- morrow I will stand atop the hill, with the Lord's staff in my hand" (Ex. 17:9). The description of Moses raising his arms echoes Ex. 17:11-12 (see n. 9). The description of Moses being protected by a cloud is based on the midrash. 8. I believe we should reject an allegorical interpretation, such as that given by the Russian cen- sor who saw the two giants as representing Christianity and Islam and, accordingly, prohibited printing the poem. 9. "When Moses raised his hand, Israel would prevail; and when he lowered his hand, Amalek would prevail-and his hands were true until the sun set" (Ex. 17:1 1-12). The midrash on this passage says, "Do Moses' hands make or break war? Rather, it tells you that as long as [the children of] Israel looked upward and subjugated their hearts to their father in heaven-they would prevail; and when they did not, they would fail" (Mishnah, Tractate Rosh Hashanah 3:5). 160</page><page sequence="5">The Figure of Moses in Modern Hebrew Poetry remains of the laggards who perished in slavery," enter and seize the new land, and effect a change of values. Declarations such as "Go! Today you cross into a new land!"; "Not poor bread, quail and grain from the heavens-you shall eat the bread of wearying work, the fruit of your manual labor!"; and "Israel! Rise and take pos- session!" express ideals of the Tehiyah period; while the description of his ap- pearance, which abounds with war imagery-"awesome glory like the face of the angel of battle," "his voice went out like an arrow, full of might and strength, his word burning like a torch, like fire"-presents Joshua as a determined leader and fearless war hero, that is, as the figure of an ideal national leader. When, in the poem's final section, the poet shifts to speaking for himself in the third person and describes the people's reaction to Joshua's words, we hear a different tone. In complete contrast to Joshua's stance, the people's reaction attests to their ambivalence with respect to their identity and values; for although the peo- ple listen to Joshua's voice "with sacred silence," blow trumpets, and stand poised to embark on a campaign under Joshua's leadership, they cannot leave the desert behind because they remain stuck to the figure of the dead Moses, the "great, faith- ful" shepherd. Here, too, as in the earlier poem, Moses' greatness is expressed by the bended knee of those standing before him; here these are not two enemy giants broken by his greatness, but "all corners of the people" who rise "as one" to kneel in reverence "before the spirit of the man of God." This kneeling emphasizes the profound emotional relationship of the people to their leader who died in the wilderness. Moreover, because the people are described as kneeling not before Moses the man but before "the spirit of the man of God"-the word "spirit" [ruah] denoting both soul and spirituality-the people's kneeling should be understood as expressing their reverence and love for the soul and the values that Moses sym- bolizes. The poet depicts Joshua as well aware of the people's attachment not only to Moses but to their entire wilderness past, so he includes in his Tehiyah-style ora- tion venomous and ironic passages against the wilderness generation ("Let not the corpses of the laggards who died in their slavery hold us back ... may they rot in shame ... may they find their dream sweet, their dream of abundant onions, gar- lic, giant pots full of flesh"). However, these remarks do not inhibit the people, who rise "as one" and kneel before Moses' spirit. The people's ambivalent stance, which comprises two conflicting emotions- a psychological readiness for national renaissance and a profound emotional con- nection to the world they must leave behind-reflects not just the ambivalent personal stance of the poet adrift between two worlds, which was the position that he expressed, for example, in his poem "Alone" (,''). His attribution of this am- bivalence to the entire people indicates that in the poet's view, this ambivalence is a collective spiritual state characterizing a society that wants to abandon its loca- tion and build itself a new home. Moreover, presenting the people as acting "as one" expresses more a justification of the people's profound ambivalence than it does of Joshua's unambiguous and unhesitating ideological stance. Extrapolating to the reality of the Tehiyah period, Bialik is in effect saying that true national re- naissance requires "the spirit of Moses." Hebrew poetry of the Tehiyah period often latches on to the tragic, human 161</page><page sequence="6">Malka Shaked moment of Moses' death in the wilderness, before he could enter the land to which he had led the people. This is not just because a person's death on the verge of re- alizing his vision is a powerful, tragic moment that arouses empathy, but princi- pally because the vision whose realization was thwarted was the national vision of aliyah to the Promised Land, and because the person who was destined not to en- ter the land was none other than the revered national leader who had led the peo- ple there,'0 a blow to the Tehiyah movement's most devoutly held wish. In practice, Tehiyah poetry confronts the story of Moses' death repeatedly and in a variety of ways, all expressive of pain; but while the national meaning of that death is highlighted at first, at a later stage the focus is on the death's individ- ual, human meaning. Bialik sees it as grounds for lamentation by the entire peo- ple; Frischman's Moses blames himself for not having given his people their hoped-for freedom and for not having conquered the new land on their behalf. Fichman and Rachel, on the other hand, focus on a description of the death itself, with minimal connection to the people's situation. Fichman's Moses accepts his death resignedly, and the speaker in Rachel's poem develops a generally pes- simistic, deterministic outlook. In the opening words of David Frischman's poem "Moses" (nwn; 1901), we hear an echo of the opening words of Bialik's poem (here, fin wrt' by, "atop the mountain"; there, 'Yin Wx-i *Y, "atop Harel," i.e., "atop the mountain of God"); ' but in spite of this intertextual connection, at the center of the poem stands an en- tirely different depiction of Moses. In the opening, the poet-speaker describes the hour of Moses death as the hour when Moses felt a "vacuum" in his heart even though "his eye was not dimmed and his strength had not yet departed." In what follows, he shifts to de- scribing the character's feeling from within, employing for this purpose the tech- nique of dramatization, in which Moses speaks for himself in the first person. Moses addresses God as if Moses were mourning his own death and protesting that his life had passed in vain. He explains that his heart is a "vacuum" not because he is about to die while still in possession of his strength, but because he is about to die without having brought his people to the Land of Israel, conquered it on their behalf, and given them the longed-for "freedom" without which his life and work were without purpose. This protest, which is nowhere to be found in the biblical account, is intensified by the poet's use of one of the elements of the biblical ac- 10. We can learn, for example, about the importance of the idea of the "leader" from Bialik's poem "For Ahad Ha'am" (1893), published in the same year as "Atop Mount Harel" and dedicated to the spiritual leader of the generation; a poem in which Bialik depicts the image of the leader through the metaphor of light. 11. Bialik's opening words also echo in the opening of the sonnet "On the Summit of Mount Hor," the tenth in Tchernichovsky's sonnet cycle "To the Sun" (1917-1921), just as Bialik's metaphor- ic "clouds of light" and "brightness" echo in this sonnet. In Tchernichovsky's sonnet, as in the poems of Bialik and Frischman, Moses is presented as exalted above the people. In Tchernichovsky's addi- tional description, which appears in his poem "I Have Nothing of My Own," Moses is described as a figure worthy of being made a "monument" because of his great exaltedness, because of his being "the lawgiver of all distant peoples, knowing God face to face, the giant of the world's seers.. .the prophet of the Wilderness of Paran, the prophet of Sinai." 162</page><page sequence="7">The Figure of Moses in Modem Hebrew Poetry count. As in the Bible, Moses' death in the wilderness is punishment for a sin, but the poem's sin is entirely different from the one cited in the Bible. In the poem, Moses sees himself as having sinned not against God but against his people, by failing to grant them freedom. His entire life seems worthless and sinful to him, because he did not achieve this goal ("In vain was I!... Great and awful is the sin, when a person undertakes to go to his people, to the slave house, and redeems them but fails to conquer another land for them.. .Better that he not take them out of slavery if he cannot give them freedom!"). In Frischman's view, what casts a trag- ic light on Moses' death is not the fact that it occurs in the wilderness, or even the fact that Moses himself does not enter the land, but rather the fact that he died with- out fulfilling the national ideal for which he took the people from Egypt. This view reflects perfectly the values of a Tehiyah-period poet, who aspires to the people's redemption in their land. Fichman's poem "Nebo" (1i; 1925) and Rachel's "From Afar" (-1an; 1930) also focus on Moses' tragic personal situation standing on Mount Nebo, facing the Promised Land, his death imminent. These two lyric poems express the idea of na- tional renaissance indirectly, as the imminent death that they describe is a result of not reaching the Promised Land. "Nebo" dramatizes Moses' external and internal situation by means of Moses' recitation of a lyrical monologue. From the monologue we learn that the speaker, Moses, is on the heights of Mount Nebo at sunset, still hearing the voice of the people below, as he tells himself again and again that he must accept his de- creed death. In essence, he instructs himself to depart life despite his feelings re- garding the nearby land (iv 2) and despite the voice "below" (i 2)-a "voice" that is, ambiguously, both the sound of the people at the foot of the mountain and the internal voice that emerges from the depths of his heart and does not allow him to depart life easily. The basic emotional posture of the speaker, Moses, is total res- ignation. To the extent that the poem contains an echo of the pleading in which the biblical Moses engaged with God (Deut. 3:23), it does so to devalue it, to dispense with it, and to say that it is best gotten over ("I will ask no more, I will not seek amnesty and weak kindness"); and to the extent that the poem contains bitterness about his longing for the land being thwarted (iv 2), it is immediately negated and turned into a mood of soft elegy. This mood of resignation is expressed through- out the poem, both directly and indirectly, and it stems from the speaker's recog- nition of two things: the death decree at life's end, and the fact that he belongs to the wilderness generation ("the rebellious generation"). These provide a positive rationale for his state of resignation, a rationale according to which death in Nebo's clefts is a "good" death (v 5). What is more, this double recognition turns the bib- lical concepts from negative to positive. Instead of the punitive decree declared against Moses in the Bible, here we have a decree arising from the laws of nature; and instead of Moses' belonging to a sinful generation, as the Bible notes (Deut. 1; 32), here he is assigned to a redeemed generation. Even the term "rebellious generation," since in the speaker's thought it appears to be the equivalent of"gen- eration of salvation"-iii 3: "with my generation of salvation, a rebellious gener- ation"-should be understood here as describing a generation that rebelled not against God but against slavery. This posture of the speaker is established by means 163</page><page sequence="8">Malka Shaked of all the literary elements, including "narrative" structure, syntactic structure, me- ter, and figurative language; but this is not the place to demonstrate this point. In contrast to Fichman's poem, Rachel's "From Afar" (wrwun; 1930) express- es the tragedy in everyone's life (iii 3-4). Each person is conceived here as stand- ing on one spot, which is in the nature of "Nebo," while still seeing from afar another, the object of his devout wish, that he cannot reach (iii 2). Not presenting Moses directly; applying his fate to every man; freely using biblical allusions; and especially, making generalized and symbolic use of the concepts "Nebo" and "from afar"-all these serve to convey that the biblical figure is being employed not for the sake of its own depiction, and not in order to reveal the personal situa- tion of some other specific figure, such as the poet's lyrical "I." The poem is a lyri- cal one that is apparently divorced from the specific biblical situation of Moses' death, despite the allusions to it, and it reveals a human existential state outside of time and any specific figure. The poem's key words-"raising hands," "seeing from afar," "a certain stream," "the rock of decree," "there," "no one enters," and "great land"--are preg- nant with allusions to verses that all revolve around the decree issued against Moses: "And I pleaded" (Deut. 3:23); "you will not enter there" (ibid. 1:37); "see with your eyes for you will not cross this Jordan" (ibid. 3:27); "for you will see the land from afar but you will not enter there" (ibid. 32:52); "I will let you see with your eyes but you will not cross over there" (ibid. 34:4). Nonetheless, the speaker is not Moses and the location is not specified: "Nebo" appears here only in a metaphoric sense ("the sadness of Nebo"; i 4) and in a symbolic sense ("each per- son and his Nebo"; iii 3). Various expressive devices give the poem a very gener- alized, symbolic meaning. For example, although the use of the source's language "Raising hands. Seeing from afar" is reminiscent of Moses' pleading, it does not refer to Moses; it gives the impression instead that the situation is an eternal one, and thus largely divorced from the specific story of Moses. Despite the allusions to the biblical story about Moses, the elements that dis- tance the poem from that story stand out. Thus, there are grounds to assume that the tragic situation depicted in the poem-the situation of standing facing some- one or something longed for with the awareness that the aspiration will be disap- pointed because it has been decreed that the distance between the observer and observed is not to be bridged ("the rock of the decree: forever distant")-does not necessarily refer to the situation of the biblical figure. It may be that the speaker projects upon the subject of the poem the tragic personal situation in which she finds herself, and that the allusions to the story of Moses serve as camouflage. In- direction, concealment, and self-restraint are evident throughout: in the absence of a human figure; the absence of any first-person speech; the poem's structure, style, and figurative language; and the presentation of a situation with no occupant. In contrast to Fichman, who presents the circumstance of standing before the Promised Land as one that Moses accepts in submission to his fate, even with a positive explanation that softens the difficulty of the situation, reduces its tragic nature and strengthens the elegiac, minor tone that dominates the poem-Rachel presents the circumstance of standing facing "there" as a tragic aspiration because the standing is before the "decree" of permanent distance. Her generalizations 164</page><page sequence="9">The Figure of Moses in Modern Hebrew Poetry (i 3-4; iii 3-4) emphasize the very deterministic harshness of the situation, which is a result of the fact that it is not necessarily Moses' situation but a general human situation; and from the fact that it is being described by some unseen, all-knowing authority, rather than by Moses or some other identified speaker. In poems of the early statehood period-including poems in which recourse to Moses or his activity is indirect and stems from political reality, as well as po- ems in which Moses or his activity is already explicitly deployed as a metaphor by means of which poets express themselves or their generation, even speaking on their own behalves in the first person-we find two opposing trends, operating in parallel, in the understanding of the figure of Moses. The first preserves and even enhances the greatness of the figure and his activity. In Alterman's poem "Nun" (pa; 1949), the speaker describes the reaction of an undistinguished common man, the elderly Nun, who loses control of himself upon hearing Moses' song of re- demption. As he listens to Moses' song, Nun finally understands the redemptive miracle that has occurred, blesses his son, the young Joshua, and sobs with the in- tensity of his feelings. Moses does not appear in the poem, but he appears all around it. Alterman makes use not only of the names Nun and Joshua, but also names like the Land of Goshen, Pitom, and Raamses, as well as such clearly bib- lical phrases as "and then Moses sang," the book of "Exodus," "terrible portents," "the mortar and clay," "the darkness and blood," the sea that was "torn in half," and "Israel's exodus from Egypt"; but all these biblical references serve as a metaphor- ic background for the central event of the time of the poem's composition. The poem's publication date is explicitly noted below its title as Passover, 1949 (the poem was published in the 15 Nissan issue of "Ha-Tur Ha-Shevi'i," Passover, 1949); the presentation of the lead character as illuminated by "the same moon shining over us this night," that is, the same light as at the time of the poem's com- position, and the presentation of his son, Joshua, as "a young boy in the Youth Corps." These details betray the speaker's point of departure as the stirring present- day societal experience that the people are experiencing on Passover, 1949, with the approach of the end of the War of Independence,'2 and that the story of the re- demption from Egypt is being used metaphorically to bestow upon the Israel De- fense Forces soldiers' stand in the war and their miraculous victory the elevating archetypical dimension of emergence from slavery into redemption. The presentation of Moses as the greatest figure of all, by means of the speaker's ecstatic personal relationship towards him, may be seen in the poem "From the Time of Our Exodus from Egypt to This Day" (rnan - ti, ann iarxu w,'), by Uri Zvi Greenberg (1976). The speaker is located at the composition's late date, but from this distance he immerses himself in the great (as well as the negative) national historical experiences since the time of Moses, the people's redeemer from Egypt, complete with Moses and his legacy and the traditional reverent posture. He identifies with the people experiencing the crossing of the Red Sea, the Song 12. In Operation "Fact" (rTTrnu, san), which took place at the beginning of March, 1949, the forces of the Golani and Negev Brigades went down to Eilat via the Aravah and the Negev hills. On March 10 they put the Jordanian Bedouin units to flight from Umm Rashrash and raised the Israeli flag at the shore of the Red Sea. 165</page><page sequence="10">Malka Shaked at the Sea, Sinai, festival pilgrimages to Jerusalem and the reading of the Torah in the "from-Sinai" style; and he criticizes the people, who demand fleshpots and dance around the Golden Calf. He sees in Moses a figure even more revered and beloved than his own father and mother, and in Moses' voice he hears a voice that is "the most precious of any voice of my people to the end of generations." He sees himself as a sort of Joseph, "the boy in the sash and multi-colored coat," who is Moses' attendant and "loyalist"-a boy who, since he continues to breathe "the ancient authority," can also deliver to his audience in the present, as did Moses himself, the vision of the Promised Land: "that we will cross the Jordan and in- herit the land of the Euphrates to the Nile, that we will reign and be mighty." But the value posture and, especially, the elevated rhetorical mode that are unique to Greenberg are definitely not representative of most Hebrew poetry in the year that he published his poem. With the liberation of poets from the norms of the Tehiyah and early-state- hood periods, poetic usage of the figure of Moses or his activity expresses new purposes, among which the second line in the understanding of Moses, the trend toward depreciation or criticism, becomes increasingly prominent, even though alongside it the first line persists. The figure of Moses does not appear in Avot Yeshurun's poem "The Giving of the Torah" mrn Inn; 1980), but the speaker surprises us by making humorous intertextual use of a familiar aggadic midrash about the giving of the Torah, tak- ing the midrash out of its elevated context and inserting it into a new context that is less elevated in style and more folkloristic in its figures of speech. Where the midrash tells how the Israelites agreed to receive the Torah after all the other na- tions had refused,13 here the speaker tells "a story [ma'aseh] like this"-the term ma'aseh serving to deflate, with its sense of "fairy tale" (like the Yiddish maiseh- lach)-about a match made for the daughter of a Jewish princess. The fairy tale, which involves a match in which the bride is the Jewish princess and the potential grooms are a gentile farmer traveling in a dung cart, a landlord dressed in green, and a little Jew, transports the midrashic aggadah to the landscape of the Polish Diaspora and makes of it an allegory that becomes self-explanatory during the course of the poem (when the princess is identified as "the holy Torah"). This, to- gether with the dramatization of the fairy tale by a speaker who speaks in a lower style, full of glaring grammatical errors and rich in Yiddish vocabulary and into- nation, are just some of the devices that the poet uses to create a humorous, good- natured parody that demotes the midrash but also turns it into a kind of new midrash, Diaspora-like and popular, amusing and beloved, a midrash intended for Jews in Israel who still preserve or remember the vernacular speech style of reli- gious Jewry in the Polish Diaspora and its ilk. Two untitled poems that appear in Amichai's last book, Open Closed Open (mnin -ui mnnn; 1998), contain a unique psychological exegesis, which highlights Moses' complex individual mental state. In the poem that begins "Moses standing 13. The aggadah is taken from the original (Pesiqta Rabbati 21) in The Book of Legends (ed. Bialik and Ravnitzky; tr. W Braude; Schocken Books: New York, 1992), p. 78 "The Giving of Torah," par. 29, and see also Midrash Exodus Rabbah. 166</page><page sequence="11">The Figure of Moses in Modern Hebrew Poetry on Mount Nebo" which appears in the poem cycle "Jewish Travel" (0'1m 7- 7t), Mount Nebo is defined as "the watershed where his longings divided," because it expresses the dual emotional connection in his heart, to both Canaan and to the wilderness. The poet defines Moses as "the first to say to himself, 'In the West is my heart, and I am at the end of the East'" (i.e., his heart is in the Land of Canaan, which is to his west), and, on the other hand, as "the first to say 'In the East is my Heart, and I am at the end of the West"' (i.e., that his heart is in the wilderness, which is to his east). By means of the intertext of R. Judah ha-Levi's poetic verse, "In the East is my heart, and I am at the end of the West," in which ha-Levi ex- presses unambiguous longing for Zion, the poet interprets Moses' standing on Mount Nebo as a symbolic image that expresses a complex emotional condition of a double allegiance-allegiance to the forty wilderness years on the one hand and the land of Canaan on the other-or as an image symbolizing the "great voy- age," the "great Jewish journey" of longing. In consequence, even Moses' writing of the Torah is understood as writing a "very personal," intimate book of his trav- els and memories, which is "his alone." (Incidentally, this unique interpretation, which sees the writing of the Torah as the writing of a book of personal travels and memories, is in the nature of a midrash regarding the contiguity of the passages regarding Moses' death and the writing of the Torah [in Deuteronomy 31], a con- tiguity that arouses puzzlement as early as in the Talmud and its commentators, and all the more so in poetry.)14 In the other poem in of Amichai the poem that begins "Moses saw the face of God just once," we have a unique psychological interpretation that highlights Moses' complex individual situation; and here, too, the picture of his death is im- portant. Amichai employs an important motif from Moses' life that is often ne- glected in poetry: the motif of seeing God's face. The poem suggests a unique interpretation of Moses' life, according to which his activity and everything hav- ing to do with the biblical stories-his journey to the wilderness and even to the Promised Land, striking the rock, ascending Mount Sinai, breaking the Tablets of the Law, the Golden Calf episode, his envelopment in pillars of fire and smoke, and even his death on Mount Nebo-are all an expression of his craving to see God's face, which he had been privileged to see just once; his longing for that one- time experience that he has forgotten. The concept of seeing God's face, as we are given to understand from the poem, is not identical to the Bible's account; it re- flects instead the poet's special interpretation. Note that although according to the Bible's account, God speaks to Moses "face to face, as one man speaks to anoth- er" (Ex. 33:11),~5 in the very same chapter Moses' seeing God's face is discount- ed; God says to Moses, "You cannot see My face, because man may not see Me and live" (33:20), and similarly, "You will see My back, but My face will not be seen" (33:23). The poet seems to rely on only the first verse, as he holds that Moses 14. See the talmudic question: "Is it possible that Moses wrote 'and Moses died there'?" which S. Shalom raises as a motto in his poem "Moses Writes about Moses' Death," and the colorful Talmu- dic answer to that question in his poem. 15. Similarly: "No prophet has arisen in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face" (Deut. 34:10). 167</page><page sequence="12">Malka Shaked did indeed see God's face. Moreover, in his description of the content of this sight, he clothes it with those values that he feels are worthy of desire. These values are evidenced in the image of "a police sketch" that Amichai's Moses constructs, a sketch composed not only of a general grasp of "God's face" but also of the foun- dational visions of Moses' life, from "God's face and the face of the burning bush and the face of Pharaoh's daughter leaning over him, a baby in the bulrushes." In the poem's last line, the moment of Moses' death is described as the moment when he was granted the privilege of "kissing God's face"; and this description, in which the commonplace metaphor of "death with a kiss" conveys on the one hand that Moses at his death was granted the privilege of seeing God's face-that is, that he was once again privileged to experience the great core visions of his life-and, on the other, that this death was not a punishment, contrary to the biblical account, and was neither sad nor tragic, contrary to the prevailing view in modern poetry, but, rather, it was death with a kiss. A certain stylistic similarity between this poem of Amichai's and Meir Wieseltier's poem "Abraham"16 permits us to sharpen somewhat Amichai's basic view of the figure of Moses. In a complete reversal of Wieseltier's provocative and ironic description of Abraham, according to which Abraham loved only God and nothing else in the world, Amichai's description of Moses is extremely favorable. Amichai's Moses is a positive figure who longs all his life for the pure love of God, but this love does not come at the cost of neglecting the human sphere. His de- scription of Moses as "a person who wants to remember the face of one he loved but cannot"; his description of the sketch of "God's face" as being composed of not only the burning bush but also the face of Pharaoh's daughter, who loves him and acts compassionately toward him; and the description of the moment of Moses' death as a moment when he was privileged with "kissing" God's face-all define Moses' love for God in terms of individual human psychology while high- lighting the power of love and Moses' need for love. Although no such description appears in the Bible, it nonetheless serves to give Moses' figure in the poem a pos- itive image that is basically consistent with his positive traditional image, despite the fact that the greatness of the image of Moses in the poem lies not in his lofti- ness but in his humanity. In contrast to these last poems, in a number of poems published in the sec- ond half of the twentieth century, and mainly in its final third, we find that the fig- ure of Moses elicits interpretations that are opposed to both the traditional and the Zionist views. As early as the poem "Moses and His Ethiopian Wife" by Pinchas Elad (Lander) (1958), the speaker presents Moses' attraction to an Ethiopian woman as a physical attraction that overwhelms his attraction to the domain of di- vine holiness; this presentation of Moses is intensified in two poems of Aryeh Sivan (1969) that describe Moses in an unflattering light. In his poem "An Egyp- tian in the Sands," Moses is presented with seeming fidelity to the details of the biblical account in Exodus 2:12-22, but a closer reading quickly dispels this im- pression. Moses is described here as one who hid the Egyptian whom he had killed 16. See M. Wieseltier, "Abraham," in Kitsur Shenot haShishim (Tel Aviv: Siman Keriah, 1987), 44. 168</page><page sequence="13">The Figure of Moses in Modern Hebrew Poetry in the desert sands and then went off to another wilderness to engage in leisurely debate with the Midianite priests and "to chat with their barefoot daughters." Rereading this poem shows that the speaker entirely ignores the moral reason giv- en in the Bible for the Moses' killing the Egyptian-the explanation that "he saw an Egyptian striking a brother Hebrew" (Ex. 2:12)-and likewise the human rea- son for his flight to Midian (his concern about being informed about; Ex. 2:14). Such a reading also reveals that the speaker repeatedly presents the murdered Egyptian as a member of the class of "Egyptian victims" (plural), and that he ex- presses the horror of the presence of Egyptian victims in the wilderness by char- acterizing them as so many that "the sands lack sufficient valleys to cover" them, and as corpses whose flesh the birds carry off in pieces and whose stench sickens even the winds. The speaker thus says, in effect, that the Egyptians have been buried without the honor due the dead. In its totality, this depiction of course in- criminates Moses the killer and exonerates his Egyptian victim. In light of this de- piction, Moses' going to another wilderness (which in the Bible is the land of Midian) and his relations with Jethro and his daughters simply express his lack of a conscience, in contrast to the Egyptians, who are victims and who have been treated with contempt by their killers. Presumably underlying the parody and irony of this recasting of the biblical account is a critical view of those descendants of Moses, the Hebrew fighters of the Six Days' War, who defeated the Egyptians and buried many Egyptian dead in the sands of the Sinai Desert but could not avoid the stench of their corpses. This understanding is "supported" by internal literary ele- ments like those cited above-the presentation of the Egyptian as "Egyptians," the presentation of his burial in the sand as burial in the "sands," and the disregard for the Bible's moral justification for what Moses did-and by such external factors as the knowledge of the date of the poem's publication, after the Six Days' War, and the knowledge of the heavy stench that filled the Sinai Desert at the conclu- sion of the war. In his poem "On Moses' Sex Life" (1969), Sivan also points to the human/ moral flaw in the figure of Moses. In this instance, the flaw consists of Moses' ig- noring the flesh of his Ethiopian wife, a neglect stemming from the fact that he "knows" only God and that he is potent to tense up and be erect-all terms with intentioned sexual connotations-only when God is speaking to him. Like Wie- seltier's aforementioned poem, "Abraham," and unlike Amichai's thinking-ac- cording to which Moses' love of God is not at the expense of his relations with people but, rather, comprehends his love of man and woman-in Sivan's poem, Moses' exclusive devotion to God is interpreted as sexual deviance and as an un- forgivable human transgression. Controversial critical exposition of the figure of Moses and of the biblical account reaches its peak in Aharon Amir's poem "No One Dared to Know" (Kx w'7y nrt n nrn), published in the periodical "Moznayim" in 1997. Like Bialik, Frischman, Fichman, Rachel, and Amichai, Amir is drawn to the moment of Moses' death; but unlike them, rather than addressing the tragic decree, he pursues the mystery surrounding Moses' burial place. In essence, he deals with the bibli- cal figure in the manner of midrashic authors and synagogue preachers who rely on a using verse in the weekly portion to burrow into the text and come up with a 169</page><page sequence="14">Malka Shaked new understanding of it; except that he does so in order to offer a kind of "Canaan- ite" homily, which takes issue with the Bible and traditional commentary-in oth- er words, a parody of a traditional homily. To achieve a parodic effect, he employs homiletical techniques: He takes a verse from the concluding chapter of Deuteron- omy and quotes it accurately at the opening of the poem ("And no one has known his burial place to this day" [Deut. 34:6]); makes abundant use of "essayistic" words; and deploys other oratorical and rhetorical devices of homily. The mystery of Moses' burial place, traditionally interpreted as an expression of the man of God's extraordinary and revered nature, is presented in the poem as a "powerful ideological stratagem" and as an expression of the rebellion of the generation that rightly detested its tyrannical leader and wanted to forget him, being a generation that yearned for "life and action" and for "a different beginning." By quoting the verse that says that Moses' burial place is unknown, as well as alluding to other moments in Moses life that appear in the same chapter ("the Lord knew him face to face" [Deut. 34:11 ]; "the great might" and "the awesome power" [34:12]), Amir presents an anti-biblical and anti-traditional homily, which unmasks in Moses the face of a grandiose messianic tyrant. Instead of the Moses myth of the Bible and traditional commentary, he thus creates a new myth that wrestles with the old myth by parodying it; and he presents this new myth as a very old one that the Bible sought to cover up, censor, and erase. In this depiction, which is fed by the poet's anti-religious and anti-establish- ment position, nothing remains of the lofty exposition of the figure in which tra- ditional thinking saw a leader and prophet the likes of whom never again arose in Israel, and whom Tehiyah and Zionist thinking revered. It is very possible that Amir expresses here not only an esoteric "Canaanite" view, but also the leadership cri- sis from which contemporary Israeli society suffers constantly. In any event, if Bia- lik's Moses was the beloved of his people, here they hate him; if Frischman's and Pen's Moses was a leader who came to free his people from slavery, Amir's Moses is his people's great enslaver; if Fichman and Rachel feel the pain of Moses' death, Amir gives him a final "burial." But is it indeed final? We must remind ourselves that the fiercely critical views of the figure of Moses seen in various poets of the late twentieth century do not give the full pic- ture. Uri Zevi Greenberg's poem, written in 1976, is not the only poem that evinces a positive view toward Moses. The poems "And All the People Saw the Sounds" (nrip nxr r ai Tn 5~1), by Rivka Miriam (1982) and "Moses Writes About the Death of Moses" (-nw nni n': yani nwnu), by S. Shalom (1984), as well as Amichai's poems (1998), express a positive attitude toward Moses; this suffices to show that even in the context of one or another dominant generational view, there is a large range of personal and individual thinking by poets, and that each instance of dom- inant thinking is apt to give way to another with the appearance of another poetic corpus.
