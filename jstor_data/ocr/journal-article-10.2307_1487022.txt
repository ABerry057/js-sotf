<plain_text><page sequence="1">Harvey E. Goldberg, Jewish Life in Muslim Libya: Rivals &amp; Relatives. Chi- cago: University of Chicago Press, 1990. x, 181 pp. Harvey E. Goldberg, professor in the Department of Sociology and Social Anthropology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, examines in this book the changing relations between Jews and Muslims in Libya (main- ly in Tripolitania) from the early nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, combining historical and anthropological aspects. Much of the material was published originally in article form, but in transforming his earlier writings into a book, Goldberg has added new information and analysis. The introduction presents the aims of the study, and provides some his- torical and demographic background. Among the proclaimed aims is to emphasize aspects of everyday behavior that deserve more attention than has hitherto been given to them. The examination is based on oral history from interviews with emigrant Libyan Jews and on written historical sources. Goldberg also aims to explore the interrelationships between "text and context," namely, aspects of everyday life in relation to textual-based traditions. He regards as the special contribution of the book its investiga- tion of cultural forms of everyday life. In Goldberg's words, "In focusing on everyday life, I do not intend to separate cultural analysis from the broader political, economic, and social settings in which it must be placed, but to show how the analysis of these larger structures can benefit by attention to ethnographic details describing everyday customs and micro level social processes" (p. 3). Goldberg also explains how the meaning of dhimmi in the</page><page sequence="2">108 BOOK REVIEWS North African context, where it related mainly to Jews, contributed to shap- ing Jewish life there. The second chapter, "Jewish Life in Muslim Tripoli in the Late Qara- manli Period," deals with the period from 1711 to 1835, when a local dynasty controlled the area. Goldberg examines the special relations between the heads of the Jewish community and the rulers, based on the economic skills of the Jews, and shows how the Jewish leaders tried at times to utilize their links with the ruler's harem in order to advance their in- terests. The use of anthropological methods in interpreting events comes to the fore in Goldberg's examination of the Jews' Sabbath games, which he believes "may reflect the delicate balance of contradictions of which Jewish life in Muslim Tripoli was composed ... The Jews thus come to stand momentarily for the whole society from which they are 'officially' barred" (p. 32). This interpretation is based on hypotheses regarding games in other societies and periods, and while they might refer to broader issues, one should be careful not to put too much into them. Next comes a chapter entitled "The Ottoman Period: Political Change and Traditional Rhetoric," focusing on events from 1835 to 1911. Goldberg shows the implications regarding the Jews in Libya that resulted from the change of the regime and its attitude toward the population. Security of life improved, and as a result Jews were less dependent on local chieftains and even became partners in the administration of justice. These and other changes met with diverse reactions in Libya, because many indigenous strongmen felt their power diminished. Thus, although the Jews had much to gain from the Ottoman reforms, they were careful not to antagonize the local population, especially in the countryside, far from the centers of Otto- man government and foreign protection. Equality, however, also brought unwanted changes, such as general conscription, from which all in Libya had hitherto been exempt. The various examples brought forth show that despite attempts at equality by the government, the society in Libya con- tinued to regard the Jews as a special element whose status was inferior to that of the Muslim majority. This chapter is followed by "Jewish Weddings in Tripolitania: A Study in Cultural Sources," in which wedding customs among the rural Tripoli- tanian Jews are examined in comparison with those of their Muslim neigh- bors, with special emphasis on sexuality and social values. Various customs are described; the local explanations for them are provided as well as their possible deeper meaning. This is one of the phenomena which Goldberg uses</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 109 in order to show the complexity of the cultural influences that shaped life among the Libyan Jews. The next chapter, "Itinerant Jewish Peddlers in Tripolitania at the End of the Ottoman Period and under Italian Rule," examines the structure and training of Jewish peddling in the countryside as well as its economic and social implications. Goldberg shows that although peddling was at times a difficult profession, it provided a good income. An interesting aspect of it relates to intergender relations; although women were usually segregated, the Muslims did not object to their females coming into contact with males of inferior socioeconomic strata. As a result, trading with Muslim females was restricted at this period to Jewish peddlers, who provided Muslim rural and tribal women with products that had female and sexual connotations (kitchenware, clothings, etc.). In chapter 6, "Jewish-Muslim Religious Rivalry in Tripolitania," Gold- berg uses textual sources to show that the interreligious rivalry between Jews and Muslims was echoed in everyday practices. A major event-represent- ing one of the main reasons why the Libyan Jews decided not to stay in Libya when it became an independent Arab state-is dealt with in chapter 7, "The Anti-Jewish Riots of 1945: A Cultural Analysis." These riots were a unique event in Jewish-Muslim relations in Libya, and Goldberg adds his explanation as to the reason why they happened, believing that they fol- lowed ritual patterns. He parallels the riots to Muslim behavior during reli- gious events, which until the early twentieth century had at times become violent against non-Muslims. Nonetheless, religious fervor was limited in the past and did not surface for a long period of time. Consequently, it does not explain the timing and the dimensions of the riots (in which more than 130 Jews were murdered, many were wounded, and much Jewish property was lost). In the last chapter, "History and Cultural Process: Change and Stability in the Meaning of Jews in Libyan Society," Goldberg sums up his thought regarding the issues dealt with throughout the study, and focuses on reli- gious identity and daily life, religious rivalry, texts and social life, and cul- tural dynamics and historical change. The main contribution of this comprehensive and diversified study is its attempt to examine historical developments through a combination of his- torical and anthropological approaches, taking examples from everyday life in order to explain broader phenomena. This is an interesting method which has not been widely used before due to the scarcity of scholars with an inter-</page><page sequence="4">110 BOOK REVIEWS disciplinary background. While this approach can explain many develop- ments, it should be used carefully, especially when all that we have is a limit- ed number of historical sources and oral testimonies. Nonetheless, this, like any interdisciplinary approach, is intriguing and stimulating and helps us understand historical developments.
