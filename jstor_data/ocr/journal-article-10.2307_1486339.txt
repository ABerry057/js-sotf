On May 23, 1907, State Senator Martin Saxe, a Republican represen- tative of Manhattan's West Side, submitted to the New York State Legislature "an act to amend Chapter 1042 of the laws of 1895, entitled 'an act to protect all citizens in their civil and religious rights.' "' This amendment was designed to strengthen existing legislation by prohibiting the advertising of discriminatory or exclusionary practices in places of public accommodation or amusement.

" The impetus for such a measure-at that time-was the well-publicized exclusion from the Blenheim-Marlborough Hotel in Atlantic City, N.J., of Mrs. Bertha Rayner Frank, a leading Jewish citizen of Baltimore and the sister of U.S. Senator Isidor Rayner. Mr. Saxe's bill was sent to the Senate Judi- ciary Committee for consideration. The task of drafting civil rights legislation had been delegated to the states by the United States Supreme Court in 1883, when the Court declared the 1875 Federal Civil Rights Act unconstitutional. This statute was the last of a series of federal civil rights laws passed between 1866 and 1875, which had provided that "all citizens of every race and color without regard to any previous condition of slavery" shall have the same rights "as are enjoyed by white citizens." They dealt with voting rights, property rights, and "the right to equal enjoyment of public accommoda- tions and amusements." And they had created, according to Milton Kon- vitz, "a new concept in equality-that in the absence of slavery, no man should be subject to the incidents of slavery." 8 The Civil Rights Act of 1875 specifically provided that: all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall be en- titled to the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations, ad- vantages, facilities, and privileges of inns, public conveyance and other places of public accommodations; subject only to the con- ditions and limitations established by law and applicable alike to citizens of every race and color.4 The Court's logic in overturning the 1875 statute was set down by Justice Joseph P. Bradley. He explained that the Fourteenth Amendment protected the rights of the individual only against infringement by the state. The actions of individual citizens toward each other were declared 2. "Mrs. Frank and the Hotel Marlborough," AH, May 24, 1907, p. 73. Although references are made in AJYB, IX, 566, and in the Louis Marshall Papers to the existence of such an ad-hoc committee, there are no records extant of the group's meetings. See below, Appendix, note 2 for a listing of the members of this com- mittee. 3. Milton R. Konvitz and Theodore Leskes, A Century of Civil Rights (New York, 1961), p. 102. 4. Ibid., p. 63.</page><page sequence="3">JEFFREY GUROCK 95 to be no concern of the federal government. Congress, he said, was solely empowered to counteract discriminatory state laws. Discriminatory acts by individuals could only be regulated by the states themselves. Writing for the majority of the Court, Bradley stated: " [federal] legis- lation cannot possibly cover the whole domain of rights appertaining to life, liberty and property, defining them and providing for their vindica- tion." " In the several years immediately following this decision, many of the states passed legislation similar to the legally defective federal laws. By 1900 eighteen eastern, northern, and western states had differing civil rights laws on their books. The effectiveness of these laws was, however, severely limited by the antagonistic attitudes of the state courts at the turn of the century toward civil rights legislation. Many state justices believed that public accommodation statutes were in derogation of the common law, which gave innkeepers the right to serve whomever they pleased. They also perceived these laws as penal in nature, imposing restrictions on the control and management of private property. Be- lieving the citizen's right of association to be sacrosanct, they applied strict interpretation to all civil rights acts. Most state courts ruled that the laws' protection covered only those places and persons actually men- tioned in the laws. Thus, for example, under the New Jersey law, Mrs. Frank could not bring suit against the Blenheim-Marlborough Hotel be- cause "resorts" were not specified in the statute.6 The 1907 Saxe Amendment was designed by Marshall et al. to circum- vent judicial conservatism by enumerating, by name or title, every con- ceivable person, place, or instance covered under the law. This amend- ment-to strengthen the existing 1895 New York State Civil Rights Act-was to serve as a model for similar bills in other states.7 The original 1895 act was a short, terse statement extending protection to "all persons" and "all citizens" against discrimination at "inns, res- taurants, hotels, eating houses, public conveyances, bath houses, barber shops, theatres or music halls." The law failed, however, to mention establishments which may be described as "resort" or "hotels conducted for those seeking health, recreation or rest." 8 5. Ibid., p. 104. 6. Ibid., pp. 159-68. 7.

It also clearly defined which officials of an establishment were responsible for insuring that all persons received equal treatment in the securing of public accommodations.9 The most famous provision of the Saxe Amendment dealt with the problem of offensive advertising. This section of the bill, the first of its kind in the nation, clearly outlined the types of advertising which were to be classified as "offensive." The bill also declared a violation of the law to be a misdemeanor, "punishable by a fine of $500. or imprison- ment of not less than 30 or more than 90 days or both." 10 The Saxe Amendment was perceived by Jewish civil rights activists as an effective legal palliative to the insult of exclusion exemplified by the Frank incident. The measure was drafted and submitted to the New York State Senate on May 23, 1907, and Jewish leaders immediately began to lobby for its passage. b) THE BERTHA RAYNER FRANK INCIDENT-OTHER AMERICAN JEWISH RESPONSES Besides sparking Marshall et al. to initiate a long-needed campaign to strengthen state civil rights laws, the Bertha Rayner Frank incident initi- ated a spirited and far-reaching debate in many Jewish circles about the proper means of defending Jewish civil rights. The debate centered around the question of whether legislation, no matter how well conceived and prepared, could ultimately insure the social acceptability of the Jew. The major vehicles for this debate were the American Hebrew (New York), the American Israelite (Cincinnati), and the Jewish Comment (Baltimore), three important English-language periodicals of the day.'1 9. Ibid. 10. Ibid. 11. This study is restricted in this area in its scope of sources to English-language periodicals. Yiddish periodicals were not consulted because the problem of resort- hotel discrimination made little impact upon the struggling immigrant readers of the Yiddish-language press. Although the editor of the Wahrheit, William Miller, congratulated Governor Sulzer on his signing the Civil Rights Bill of 1913 in an editorial in April of that year, the bill's passage made little immediate impact upon his readers. See William Sulzer to William Miller, April 17, 1913, and Louis Marshall to William Sulzer, April 15, 1913, MP-AJA.</page><page sequence="5">JEFFREY GUROCK 97 Each paper responded differently to the Frank incident, and each sug- gested several different methods of fighting exclusionary anti-Semitism. The Jewish Comment (Baltimore) 12 perceived the exclusion of Jews from hotels and resorts as a manifestation of the status insecurity felt by members of the upper middle class in contemporary American society.'3 In its first editorial about the Frank incident, dated May 24, 1907, the periodical clearly described the fears which motivated such prejudice: There is a large body of Americans engaged in a vulgar struggle and scramble for some kind of social position. Their aggressiveness, their pretentions have not been criticized for nothing. They have learned that it is a mark of superiority to discriminate for social reasons, and they will have that discrimination, no matter how high it comes, and at whose expense. Their existence as a social entity depends on it.14 Hotelkeepers, in its view, were simply responding to the economic pressure exerted upon them by prejudicial Gentile patrons. Fearful of losing their clientele by being dubbed as "Hebrew" hotels, proprietors expediently excluded Jews from their establishments. The Jewish Comment called upon all Jews to "boycott those hotels which limited the number of their co-religionists accommodated." Such action, the newspaper editorialized, would convince discriminatory pro- prietors of the economic unprofitability of prejudice. Jews who crowd places where a limited number are taken only con- vince him that he can get as much of their trade as he wants when 12. The Jewish Comment, a Baltimore-based weekly, was founded in 1895 and had in 1907 a circulation of approximately 4,000 readers. The source for the publi- cation statistics presented here is N. W. Ayers &amp; Son, Directory of Newspapers and Periodicals for the year 1907. The JC was chosen for examination, despite its limited circulation, because it was the type of paper read by Mrs. Frank's friends and associates in Baltimore. The Rayners were an old distinguished Baltimore family, having lived in that city since 1840. Mrs. Frank's father, William Solomon Rayner, a staunch advocate of Reform, was a founder of Har Sinai Congregation and was instrumental in bringing David Einhorn to the congregation in 1855. See Isidore Blum, The Jews of Baltimore (Baltimore, 1910), p. xl. 13. The theme of status insecurity, articulated here in the Jewish Comment, is a major thesis of John Higham's in his exploration of the origins of social anti- Semitism.

They should teach him his mistake, and it can be easily done, for there is no difficulty in obtaining accommo- dations from men who serve the public and serve it well.'5 One week later, in an editorial entitled "The Thing Must Stop," the Jewish Comment declared itself staunchly in favor of legislation to pro- hibit hotel and resort discrimination. The newspaper proposed that "some representative body take up this matter, and conduct a dignified campaign against this aspersion on the Jewish people." 16 This group, which would be composed of the "best" men in the Jewish community, would be charged with fighting for the passage of civil rights laws in every state in the Union. The newspaper envisioned a controlled, dignified campaign conducted in the legislatures and courts of the nation by the shtadlanim of American Jewry. In dealing with the question of the propriety of such activity, the news- paper asserted that the development of anti-Jewish feeling in public or semi-public places was a "dangerous thing, broader than the rights and feelings of the private individual." Comparing the present lot of the Jew with that of the Negro, the editors wrote: "The Jew cannot take position with the negro [sic] as an undesirable in places offering accommodations to the general public. We repeat, if we have a law covering the offense, invoke it: where no law exists, have one enacted." 17 The American Hebrew (New York) 18 also recognized the status in- security which motivated much of the social discrimination against Jews. It extended its criticism, however, beyond the Gentile middle class, attacked by the Jewish Comment, and pilloried those self-hating Jews who would support the existence of exclusionary quotas at hotels and resorts. The American Hebrew asserted that many proprietors limited the number of Jews accommodated at the behest of other Jews who would rather not associate with others of their religious persuasion. This attitude, in the newspaper's view, was a "reflex expression" caused by 15. Ibid. 16. "The Thing Must Stop," JC, May 31, 1907, p. 122. 17. Ibid. 18. The American Hebrew, a New York-based periodical, was founded in 1879 and had a circulation in 1907 of 28,000. This periodical was chosen for examination because it traditionally supported the activites of AJC people. Several of the AJC people were also members of the periodical's publishing committee. Naomi W. Cohen points out in Not Free to Desist (Philadelphia, 1972), p. 36, that "only the American Hebrew among the Anglo-Jewish periodicals was a loyal supporter of the Committee in its early years."</page><page sequence="7">JEFFREY GUROCK 99 "the survival of anti-Jewish prejudices in the non-Jewish population which has to be lived down." 19 The American Hebrew offered a three-fold remedy to this problem. It suggested that (1) Jewish communal pressure should be brought upon those Jews who helped perpetuate this injustice; (2) hotels which place limits upon the number of Jews accommodated should be boycotted, and (3) legislative action should attack the underlying problem of Gentile prejudice. Jews were advised to lobby for effective civil rights laws to insure the future against the recurrence of the type of insult suffered by Mrs. Frank and others. The propriety of legislative action was unquestioned. As previously mentioned, the American Hebrew believed legislation to be "the only practical method of meeting the insult, which is much more of a blot upon the fair name of American toleration than upon the character of the Jew." 20 In sharp contrast to the policies of New York and Baltimore periodicals was the position adopted by the Cincinnati-based American Israelite.21 While in essential concurrence about the origins of exclusionary anti- Semitism, the American Israelite differed fundamentally over the question of what should be the proper response of American Jewry to such dis- crimination. It challenged the propriety of legislation as a palliative to social ills. In an editorial entitled "Regulating the Summer Hotels," dated May 30, 1907, Rabbi Max Heller asked the rhetorical question: If the Saxe bill is passed, "will anything be gained?" 22 Rabbi Heller responded in the negative and suggested several reasons for his dissenting opinion. He asserted that a long, protracted nationwide struggle for state civil rights laws could make martyrs out of the very hotelkeepers under attack. He also argued that there existed "a 1000 ways" of circumventing any law which attempts to interfere with private discrimination. "Can a law," he asked, "prevent hotel employees from being intentionally rude to Jewish guests?" He further asserted that, given the racist climate of the period, legislative action was not only foolhardy but dangerous to the security 19. "Summer Hotels," AH, May 24, 1907, p. 56. 20. Ibid. 21. The American Israelite, founded by Isaac Mayer Wise in 1854, had in 1907 a circulation of 24,000. This periodical was chosen because it clearly reflected the counter approach to the activism advocated by the Eastern periodicals. The American Israelite opposed the bill from its inception and doubted its utility and effectiveness after it was passed. 22.

Rabbi Heller belived that "the whole force of preju- dice against the negro [sic] would be arrayed against Jewish advocates of civil rights legislation." Finally, Rabbi Heller upheld the prevalent belief in the individual's right of association. He stated that "when all is said the refusal of social intimacy is a human right, one of the sacred rights of privacy which society must safeguard and dare not infringe upon." 23 The American Israelite advocated patience and re-education as the most efficacious means of assuring Jewish social acceptability. It believed that exclusionary anti-Semitism would disappear when Jewish assimilation was complete. "To my mind, they are simply the throes of assimilation. To the feelings of those people our assimilation has not yet progressed to the point of perfect social acceptability. Let us have patience." 24 In evaluating these differing opinions, two important observations must be made. First, there obviously existed a distinct ideological split be- tween Eastern Jewry (New York and Baltimore) and Midwestern Jewry (Cincinnati) over the best way to fight social discrimination against Jews.25 The "East" openly advocated the application of Jewish lobbying pressure upon state legislatures to enact civil rights laws. "Cincinnati" disdained that method and opted for the more conservative tools of re- education and assimilation as the best means for the eventual solution of the Jewish question. It may be suggested that "Cincinnati" advocated a more patient ap- proach than did New York and Baltimore primarily because Midwestern Jewry was not as immediately affected by exclusionary anti-Semitism. The plausibility of such an explanation is supported by a May 24, 1907 letter written by Louis Marshall to Simon Wolf, President of the Board of Delegates on Civil Rights of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, in which Marshall took issue with Wolf's contention that "the same animus that motivates hotel keepers in and about New York 23. Ibid. 24. Ibid. 25. It has been suggested that the split between East and Midwest may be more correctly explained along religious sectarian lines. That does not appear to be the case. Reform Jews fought on both sides of the issue. For example, Simon Wolf, a Reform Jew, President of the UAHC's Board of Delegates for Civil Rights, was an ally of Marshall in his struggle. Marshall himself was a Reform Jew. Max Heller, who in 1907 was Vice-President of the CCAR, identified Wolf by name as one of the individuals foolishly advocating legislative action. Wolf and Marshall were, however, in the minority in the Reform camp, as evidenced by Wolf's inability to have a resolution passed by the Board of Delegates supporting Marshall's activities.</page><page sequence="9">JEFFREY GUROCK 101 City, animates them throughout the country." Marshall believed that this anti-Jewish feeling was "entirely confined to the eastern part of this country-the New England states, New York, New Jersey and Pennsyl- vania." "In this area," Marshall continued, "reside more than 2/3rds of all the Jews in America and those Jews who live outside of that area, and who suffer from the barbarous anti-Semitism which is evinced in this part of the country, are in fact discriminated against in this area only by hotel keepers and others carrying on business therein. The subject, therefore, is one which directly affects the Jews of this part of the coun- try, and is essentially local in its nature so far as legislation is con- cerned." 26 For Marshall, the geographic parameters of the problem were well-defined. There is, however, one crucial inconsistency in that argument. If "Cin- cinnati" Jewry was so unaffected by the problem of social anti-Semitism, why did it violently oppose Jewish activism on behalf of civil rights legis- lation? Is it possible that these Jews were cognizant of an undercurrent of a local brand of anti-Semitism threatening their future security? Does a socially secure Jew prophesy that the whole force of racial prejudice will be arrayed against Jews who struggle for civil rights? This problem of the Midwestern Jewish approach to civil rights legislation and these Jews' relations with Eastern Jewish activities is a complex one which deserves much further exploration.27 A second important point to be stressed concerns the impact made by this split upon the choice of tactics used by Louis Marshall and his associates in their struggle for passage of the New York State Civil Rights Law of 1913. Faced with Midwestern opposition to their plans, Marshall's group was never able to assert that its efforts had the unified support of all sections of American Jewish society.28 And, judging from the aforemen- tioned letter to Simon Wolf, Marshall would have liked universal Jewish support for his project. In another section of that letter, Marshall sug- 26. Marshall to Simon Wolf, May 24, 1907, MP-AJA. 27. See p. 109 and n. 55. There is another interesting parallel issue arising from the preceding discussion; namely, the American Jewish approach to the status of blacks. Both Baltimore and Cincinnati made reference to the sorry plight of the black in the age of Jim Crow. Jews were apparently well aware of the problems of racism and were, to some extent, fearful that anti-black feeling would affect their own status. The responses of the two periodicals are, however, entirely different. 28. The problem of disunity during this period clearly transcended the one issue. Cohen points out that "in 1907, committees of the UAHC, B'nai B'rith and the AJC made futile efforts to define the spheres of activity of the three organizations" (p. 35).</page><page sequence="10">102 1913 CIVIL RIGHTS ACT gested that "the Board of Delegates may help us with their moral sup- port. A resolution by the Board of Delegates might be of use. If you can procure such a resolution, and will forward it to me, I will make such use of it as the circumstances will warrant." 29 Marshall foresaw such a resolution as providing him with tactical lever- age in his dealings with recalcitrant state legislators. He wanted to be able to argue that although exclusionary anti-Semitism was a problem primarily affecting New York Jewry, the entire American Jewish community was anxiously awaiting the passage of the Saxe Amendment. Marshall and Wolf were, however, apparently unable to secure the desired resolution. There is no evidence in the Louis Marshall Papers or in the Annual Re- ports of the Board of Delegates to the UAHC of any such resolution being passed by that organization.30 Marshall et al. were obliged to pre- sent the fight for passage of the Saxe Amendment as essentially a local issue of great importance to the rich and influential New York Jewish community. c) THE LEGISLATIVE BATTLE (1907-1913)-TACTICS AND PROBLEMS On June 7, 1907, the American Hebrew reported that "the bill pro- posed by Senator Saxe is not likely to pass this session. It is to be hoped that the bill will be taken up again next session and carried through, so as to remove from the State of New York at least one of the blots on its claims to be civilized." 31 The hopes of the American Hebrew were not, however, to be realized for several years. From 1907 to 1912 no attempt was made to introduce civil rights legislation into the New York State Legislature. Finally in 1913, a bill similar to Saxe's was introduced by Assemblyman A. J. Levy and Senator Robert F. Wagner. It passed unanimously and without delay by both houses and was signed into law by Governor William Sulzer in April 1913. In 1907 Jewish advocates of civil rights legislation utilized many di- verse tactics in lobbying for the passage of the Saxe Amendment. They conducted what may be called a "textbook" campaign in minority poli- tics. Marshall et al. appealed to the reason of legislators and to their humanity, patriotism, and economic and political self-interest. They 29. Marshall to Wolf, May 24, 1907, MP-AJA. 30. Simon Wolf's resignation from the AJC in 1907 should not be dismissed as a factor in the failure of the proposed resolution. 31. "Editorial," AH, June 7, 1907, p. 111.</page><page sequence="11">JEFFREY GUROCK 103 presented their struggle as an issue of great importance to the leading Jews of the state. They backed up that assertion by enlisting the support of influential Jews in every part of the state.32 Marshall even toyed with the idea of hiring paid lobbyists, if need be, to keep the pressure on the legislature.Y Marshall and his associates also initiated a controlled media campaign. They arranged the publication of editorials supporting the bill to appear in the leading newspapers of the state. They also published circulars, explaining the goal of the Saxe Amendment, and sent copies of "offensive advertising" to legislators to impress upon them the need for passage of the proposed legislation.4 Finally, Marshall petitioned Governor Charles Evans Hughes to use his good offices to promote passage of the bill. Marshall appealed to the Governor's sense of American fair play and enclosed an advertisement which declared "that no dogs, consumptives or Jews were allowed" in a given hotel. Marshall mentioned in passing that 850,000 New York State Jews were watching with interest the outcome of the current legis- lative session.Y There was, however, one crucial tactical flaw in this campaign which critically undermined its effectiveness. Marshall and his associates chose the wrong legislative allies to push for passage of the bill. The men picked-Saxe of Manhattan and Dowling and McCarren of Brooklyn- were downstate leaders in a legislature dominated by upstate Republi- cans.36 In 1907 Republicans outnumbered Democrats by almost a two to one 32. Marshall's letter to Assemblyman Sherman Moreland, dated May 10, 1907, helps illustrate several key tactics in the aforementioned campaign. See Appendix. See also Marshall to Martin Saxe, May 23, 1907, MP-AJA. 33. Marshall to Edward Colie, May 23, 1907, MP-AIA. 34. Marshall to Martin Saxe, June 3, 1907, MP-AIA. 35. Marshall to Governor Hughes, June 4, 1907, MP-AJA. 36. The crucial point here is that the leadership was "upstate," not that it was Republican. The Judiciary committees, dominated by upstaters until 1913, also blocked a civil rights bill introduced by Assemblyman Cuvillier of New York in 1908 to protect the rights of women. Their conservatism transcended any anti- Jewish animus. It is also my belief that downstate Republicans held views similar to their Democratic colleagues. Both were outside the inner political circle in 1907. An examination of the upstate-downstate composition of the Senate and Assembly Judiciary committees between 1907 and 1913, based on the New York State Legisla- tive Record and Index, shows that downstaters during that period at no time had more than five members of the thirteen-member Senate committee and that the downstaters controlled the Assembly committee only once, in 1911.</page><page sequence="12">104 1913 CIVIL RIGHTS ACT margin in both houses of the legislature. More important, upstaters domi- nated the key Judiciary and Codes committees in both houses by a five to one margin over downstaters. The upstate Republican leadership re- mained in power for almost the entire period between 1907 and 1913. A break did occur in Republican hegemony in 1911, when the Democrats gained control of both houses and elected John A. Dix Governor. How- ever, the key Codes and Judiciary committees remained under upstate control."7 Only in 1913, with William Sulzer's election as Governor, did the pendulum swing in favor of the downstaters. A. J. Levy and Robert F. Wagner, both of New York City, became Assembly and Senate majority leaders, respectively. The Judiciary and Codes committees fell into down- state hands for the first time in years. The composition of the legislative power structure (1907-1913) sug- gests that the failure of the Saxe Amendment was due to the powerlessness of Marshall's downstate allies. It appears no coincidence that when the Civil Rights Act was finally amended in 1913, its sponsors were the ma- jority leaders of the two houses. This theory also helps explain why no attempt was made to introduce a bill similar to the Saxe Amendment from 1908 to 1912. The plausibility of this thesis is supported by several different sources. First, it is apparent from Marshall's letter to Saxe of May 23, 1907, and his telegram to McCarren of June 4, 1907, that he considered the support of Assemblyman Moreland and Senator Davis crucial for the bill's pas- sage. Both Moreland and Davis were upstate Republican leaders and chairmen of legislative committees. (There is, by the way, no record of Saxe or McCarren ever gaining the active support of these men.) Sec- ondly, if one examines the history of the A. J. Levy Sabbath Observance Bill, first introduced in 1909, one sees that it suffered the same fate as the Civil Rights Act until 1913. Levy's bill died in committee both in 1909 and in 1911 and reached the Assembly floor only in the down- state-controlled legislature of 1913. The strongest evidence supporting this thesis appears to be the activi- ties of Jewish civil rights activists themselves in 1913. Marshall's letters to friends and colleagues in the legislature, for example, abound with an optimism not present in 1907. Marshall was very cognizant of the changes in the power structure of the legislature. Indicative of the change in Mar- 37. Civil Rights bills during this period were referred to either of these two committees.</page><page sequence="13">JEFFREY GUROCK 105 shall's mood is a letter which he wrote to Assemblyman Levy on January 15, 1913: I herewith enclose two bills-two copies of each-one in relation to civil rights and the other permitting labor and secular business on Sunday. I am very earnest about them and feel that they are entitled to your serious consideration. I know of the difficulties that you have had with regard to one of these bills at the previous session when the legislature was composed differently from what it is at present. I feel now that the appointed time has come when both these measures can be passed if pushed.38 Marshall would later also credit the passage of the 1913 bill in part to the election of Democrat William Sulzer as governor in 1913.3" Sulzer, formerly a U.S. Representative, was a long-time friend of the American Jewish Committee, and was an active supporter of the Committee's battle for the abrogation of the 1832 Russo-American Treaty. AJC people in turn were extremely helpful to Sulzer in his campaign to reach the Gover- nor's Mansion. "Jacob Schiff and Louis Marshall," according to Naomi Cohen, "openly endorsed Sulzer in gratitude for his role in effecting abrogation." 40 Thus, with the Legislature in downstate hands and a friend in the Governor's chair, the time appeared ripe for a second attempt at passage. The tactics used by Marshall and the others in attaining their goal, in 1913, also reflect the optimism of those who believed that victory was near. Working with the majority leaders of a Democratically controlled legislature, they were confident that their new allies would be able to crush all opposition. They kept the issue almost completely out of the newspapers.41 No editorials were sought and no circulars were published. The Levy-Wagner Bill apparently passed through committee and its 38.

Part II The Problem of Enforcing the 1913 Civil Rights Act Amendment. a) REACTION TO THE BILL'S PASSAGE Governor Sulzer's signing of the Levy-Wagner Bill was accorded a "mixed" reception in the American Anglo-Jewish press. The American Hebrew, as expected, applauded the new law's passage and declared itself prepared to assist in its enforcement. It called upon its readers to report to the editors any instance of discrimination against Jews. This information would be forwarded by the paper to the appropriate law- enforcement agency.42 The Jewish Comment also responded affirmatively. While clearly recog- nizing that "private discrimination can be as effective as the more open and formal kind," the newspaper asserted that the law would, neverthe- less, "in a general way have a salutory effect." Its importance would lie in its "serving notice that the growing tendency to reserve public places for the elect, and by advertisement to single out people who are supposed to have no rights in this matter, is contrary to law. It is time," it argued, "for the statute book to speak for itself and we should not place vain faith in the sense of justice of educated men." 43 Spokesmen for Midwestern Jewry were much less sanguine in their evaluation of the law's potential. Julian Morgenstern, a young Reform rabbi from Cincinnati who was destined to replace Kaufmann Kohler as President of the Hebrew Union College, led the chorus of dissenters. In a column written for the B'nai Brith News (Chicago) entitled "Self Protection of Self-Assertion," Morgenstern attacked the propriety of the Act and questioned its utility. He displayed a highly antagonistic attitude toward civil rights legislation and a distinct anti-Eastern animus. Morgen- 42. "Editorial," AH, April 18, 1913, p. 714. 43.

It is safe to say that there is a Jewish influence behind this bill. It is not the negro [sic], nor the Chinese, nor the Indian, who seeks his way into summer hotels where he is not wanted. It is against Jews, and Jews alone, especially in the State of New York, who often seek to force their way into just those resorts in which they are not wanted. The mere fact of their exclusion makes the particular resort more desirable and whets their ambition to force their way, into the forbidden circle.44 Morgenstern concurred with Heller's prediction that the bill would be effectively circumvented by Gentile landlords: "It is a law, the provisions of which can be at will most easily circumvented, employees and guests will find it no difficult task to make the place altogether uncomfortable, for the Jewish invaders." 45 He also articulated an interesting interpretation of the widely held belief in the individual's right to free association. Morgenstern contended that since he was jealous of his right to "judge Negroes as a class," he could see no logical reason why anti-Semites should not be allowed the same privilege. I believe it to be a natural and inherent right of the individual to determine just whom he does like and wishes to associate with and whom he dislikes and does not want to associate with. I must admit that some people I do judge as a class and base my likes and dis- likes from a social standpoint upon the consideration of them as a class. I have never invited a negro [sic] to dine with me, and probably will never do so. I do not associate with them nor do I wish to do so. I believe I have a constitutionally legal right to select my own social associates, and if I feel this way with regard to the negro [sic], then I must accord the same right to the anti-Semite to feel the same way toward the Jew.46 Morgenstern believed that "time and education" would eventually solve the problem of social discrimination against the Jew. "Legislation," he warned, "which is unmistakably backed by Jewish influence and nothing 44. Julian Morgenstern, "Self Protection of Self-Assertion," B'nai B'rith News, May 1913, p. 41. 45. Ibid. 46. Ibid.</page><page sequence="16">108 1913 CIVIL RIGHTS ACT else must react like a boomerang upon our own Jewish Question." 47 Morgenstern's attack evoked a vigorous response from Louis Marshall. In an open letter to the American Hebrew, dated June 20, 1913, Marshall defended his activities and the underlying rationale behind civil rights legislation. Marshall asserted that his campaign was initiated on behalf of "thousands of self-respecting Jews who do not desire to intrude where they are not welcome, who nevertheless felt aggrieved by insulting publi- cations." He also reiterated his belief in the efficacy of legislation as a deterrent to social anti-Semitism. Marshall contended that "once it became known that narrow and bigoted men may not with impunity inflict public insult on any part of our population by invading their racial or religious 'holy of holies,' something 'worthwhile' will have been 'gained' through this maligned legislation." 48 b) THE Outlook INCIDENT The cogency of Marshall's arguments was subjected to an early test in the months prior to September 1, 1913 when the Levy-Wagner Act was scheduled to take effect. The Outlook incident exposed the existence of several loopholes in the law, and illustrated one of the problems which would later be encountered by those empowered to enforce it. On May 31, 1913, an advertisement appeared in the Outlook, a well- known "progressive" periodical, containing the phrase "No Jews allowed." Immediately upon hearing of this advertisement, Louis Marshall wrote to Lawrence Abbott, editor of the Outlook, to call Abbott's attention to the recently passed civil rights act which would soon make such advertising unlawful. Marshall asked Abbott to recognize "the underlying spirit" of the law and to remove the offensive advertisement before being legally forced to do so.40 Abbott responded by denying responsibility for the publication of the advertisement and confirmed Marshall's articulated suspicion that it was "printed through inadvertence." He assured Marshall that had he seen the advertisement prior to publication he would have removed it "even if it did not apparently violate the law." Abbott thanked Marshall for calling his attention to the matter and swore that the Outlook was "inflexibly 47. Ibid. 48. Louis Marshall, "The Civil Rights Law," AH, June 20, 1913, pp. 203-4. 49.

He disdained Marshall's low-key legalistic approach and attacked the periodical on philosophical grounds. In his letter of protest, dated June 2, 1913, Franklin upheld the legal right of hotelkeepers to exclude Jews from their establishments. He con- tended that his criticism was directed solely against the Outlook, "which boasts of its liberality and fair dealing and which yet accepts such adver- tising." Franklin called upon Abbott to remove the advertisement as proof of the Outlook's concern for social justice.51 Franklin received a very curt reply from Abbott. He refuted Franklin's philosophical arguments by accusing the "liberal" rabbi of advocating censorship of the press. He asked Franklin: "In view of the fact that you find no fault with the advertiser, may I ask you what you expect me to do? Shall we exclude the advertisement because of the prejudice of the advertiser?" Abbott sarcastically challenged the rabbi to enlighten him further on the subject of liberalism.52 The Abbott-Franklin debate continued for several weeks. In the course of their correspondence, Franklin attempted to obtain a clear statement from Abbott concerning his commitment against the future publication of "offensive ads" in the Outlook. Franklin apparently was unsuccessful."53 Louis Marshall entered the Outlook debate on July 24, when he sub- mitted copies of his correspondence with Abbott to the American Israelite. Marshall contended that the difference between Abbott's two responses to Jewish criticism indicated "the practical value of civil rights legislation." For Marshall, the Abbott-Franklin letters exposed the ineffectiveness of appeals to reason or liberalism in insuring the rights of Jews. He argued that Lawrence Abbott's quick acquiescence to his request illustrated the importance of legislation as a deterrent to discrimination. Marshall also suggested that "a civil rights bill is not only necessary in the effete East, but there is occasion for the enactment of such legislation in other parts of the country." 54 50.

In a letter to the American Israelite, dated August 7, 1913, he accused Marshall, "the American citizen of New York," of having been "taken in as completely as a school boy by Mr. Abbott's clever words." 55 The Outlook, according to him, had tricked Marshall by retaining the original advertisement and simply changing the words "No Jews" to "Gentiles only." He asserted that "as a matter of fact there is no difference in the tone of the corres- pondence save that Mr. Abbott's letters to Mr. Marshall may be a bit more oily." 56 The Outlook's adroit circumvention of Marshall's request indicated to Franklin that the New York Civil Rights Act was inadequate. "Justice," he wrote, "will be done when those responsible for shaping public opinion will be educated into fairness and not merely whipped into it by laws that are subject to all sorts of evasion as in the present instance." 57 Marshall replied to Franklin in a final letter to the American Israelite, dated August 27, 1913. In this correspondence, Marshall defended the comprehensiveness of the new law. He insisted that if Abbott had really. -in this instance-simply changed the wording of the advertisement to avoid legal strictures, his success would be short-lived.58 "The Civil Rights Act," Marshall stated, "will be sufficiently comprehensive to bring within the ban the phrase [Gentiles Only] to the same extent as it does the nega- tive form of expression 'No Jews.' " 59 55. "Those No Hebrew Ads," Al, August 7, 1913, p. 14. The vitriolic tone of Rabbi Franklin's article upon the "American Citizen of New York" underscores the previously outlined ideological and geographical split with American Jewry. In his letter, Franklin also compared Marshall's civil rights activities with the actions of "little Tommy [sic] Horner of the nursery rhyme who said 'O, what a big boy am I.' " Franklin's resentment of New York-based leadership may be seen as representa- tive of an important trend in Midwestern Jewish thinking. The pervasiveness of this trend has yet to be explored. 56. Ibid. 57. Ibid. 58. Rabbi Emanuel Sternheim attempted to explain the reason for the change in wording in the questionable advertisement. The Outlook, he explained in the August 22 edition of the American Israelite, p. 444, was bound to a business contract with the advertiser for the entire season. They therefore had no choice but to retain the advertisement until September 1. The change in wording was, therefore, a con- cession to Jewish protest. It toned down the original advertisement. The Outlook pledged itself to refuse in the future "anything which may be construed as discrimina- tory against any race or creed." 59. "The No-Hebrew Ads," AH, August 21, 1913, p. 41.</page><page sequence="19">JEFFREY GUROCK 111 c) PROBLEMS OF ENFORCEMENT. Louis Marshall's prediction--that the Levy-Wagner Act would be "sufficiently comprehensive" to cover the phrase "Gentiles Only" to the same degree as it would the negative form "No Jews"-proved highly in- accurate.60 Enterprising hotelkeepers, capitalizing on the strict-construc- tionist attitude of the courts, circumvented the law by inventing several new "code words" for exclusion. Such terms as "restricted clientele," "churches nearby," and "buses to church" were added to the advertiser's vocabulary. These euphemisms, which soon became intelligible to Jew and Gentile alike, stymied public officials and frustrated Jewish leaders in their attempts to have the law enforced. This particular method of circumventing the Civil Rights Law enjoyed great popularity during the 1920s and 1930s. Haywood Broun, co-author of Christians Only, perceived this form of informal exclusionary anti- Semitism as one of the important barriers limiting Jewish economic and social mobility during that period.61 The pervasiveness of this abuse is suggested by two studies undertaken in the 1950s by the New York State Commission Against Discrimination (SCAD). These surveys revealed, for example, that resort advertising which appeared in the New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune between 1928 and 1936 "made frequent use of such phrases as 'Gentile patronage,' 'Christian patronage,' and the like." 62 "These direct statements of discriminating guest selec- tion," the reports continued, "tended to disappear by 1936, but they were replaced in the newspaper ads with terms such as 'restricted,' and 'selected clientele.' " " Terms like restricted," the reports added, "were common well into the war years." 64 60. The comprehensiveness of the law was examined by the New York Court of Appeals in the Woolcott v. Shubert case of 1915. In its decision the Court recognized clearly the intent of the legislation: The debates in the present case conclusively show that the cause which led to the passage of the act of 1913 was the practice of the proprietors of some of the places designated in the act to advertise or notify the public and individuals that the advantages and privileges of those places would be refused to per- sons on account of race or creed, thereby indirectly evading the effect of the Act of 1895. See Woolcott v. Shubert, 169 App-Div. 194, 156 N.Y. Supp. 643 (1915) 194, aff'd 217 NY212 (1916) 212, 213, 222. 61. H. Broun and G. Brett, Christians Only (New York, 1931), pp. 246 ff. 62.

NYSCAD, "Churches Nearby," December 1959.</page><page sequence="20">112 1913 CIVIL RIGHTS ACT This textual loophole was but one of several limitations in the Civil Rights Act, which undermined its effectiveness. Theodore Leskes points out, for example, in his general work on state civil rights laws, that the punishments levied against civil rights offenders were not sufficiently harsh to deter them from excluding minority group members. "Owners of places of public accommodation," he wrote, "tend to regard the occasional fine or civil penalty as a kind of 'license fee' for the privilege of continuing the practice of discrimination." 65 Another related problem concerned the difficulties encountered by prosecutors in obtaining convictions under the law. Defense attorneys, according to Leskes, often used the following argument in addressing jurors: If you were a hotel operator, would you risk losing your dependable Gentile (white) clientele by catering to Jews (or blacks)? This appeal to economics and subtle racism often hit a responsive note with juries- especially if businessmen were on the panel.66 The tricky legal question of defining what exactly constituted a "place of public accommodation" was also used advantageously by hotelkeepers. Many hotels avoided the sanctions of the law by declaring themselves officially as "private clubs." As "administrators" of "private clubs," hotel- keepers could "invite" anyone they desired without interference by the courts. These abuses of the law remained essentially unchecked until 1945, when the New York State Court of Appeals reversed the traditional ap- proach toward civil rights legislation and opted for a liberal construction of the law. The Court ruled--in the case of Camp of the Pines v. New York Times Co.-that the term "selected clientele" was as obnoxious as the phrase "No Jews." The Camp of the Pines, a "vacation club" operated in the Adirondacks, had sued the New York Times for breach of contract. Its suit was predi- cated upon the Times' refusal to print an advertisement submitted by the plaintiff which contained the phrase "selected clientele." The Times, ac- cording to the plaintiff, had changed the wording of the advertisement from "selected clientele" to "congenial following" without the expressed permission of the Camp of the Pines." 65. Konvitz and Leskes, p. 172. 66. Ibid. 67. Camp of the Pines v. N.Y. Times Co., 1945, 184 Misc. 389, 53 NYS, 2nd 475.</page><page sequence="21">JEFFREY GUROCK 113 The Times contended that its actions were dictated by the spirit-if not the letter-of the Levy-Wagner Amendment. The newspaper argued that the publication of an advertisement containing the words "selected clientele" constituted a violation of the state's civil rights law. The Times bolstered its argument by referring to a letter sent in February 1943, by the New York County District Attorney to all newspaper editors within his jurisdiction. In his communication, the District Attorney declared that "the publication of ads wherein the words 'restricted clientele etc.' were generally understood and intended to mean that guests of the Jewish faith or colored persons were not wanted or accommodated at such hotels and resorts so advertised." The District Attorney admonished all news- papers "to cease printing these words of discrimination" and threatened prosecution against "the publisher of any newspaper who in the future violates the statute." The Times insisted that its alteration of the Camp of the Pines advertisement was necessitated by the position taken by the state prosecutor.68 The Court of Appeals ruled that the Times "was under no obligation to guess at its peril whether the words 'selected clientele' did or did not violate the provisions of Section 40 (Levy-Wagner Amendment) of the Civil Rights Act." The Times was granted "injunctive relief," whereby it could "continue to refuse to publish plaintiff's proposed advertisement containing the words 'selected clientele' unless plaintiff will consent to the omission of such words and phrases." The Court's decision was based upon a new liberal construction of the Civil Rights Law. Judge Murray, writing the majority opinion in this case, stated: Section 40 of the Civil Rights Law prohibits discrimination against any person by reason of race, color or creed. It is a remedial statute and must be liberally construed. It is designed to the end that all persons shall be entitled to full and equal accommodations and advantages, facilities and privileges of any places of public accommo- dation. Discrimination is barred either by direct or indirect means.69 Despite this one legal victory, the Levy-Wagner Amendment continued to be---even in the postwar years-a difficult law to enforce. The "private clubs" loophole still protected the discriminating hotelkeeper.70 Neverthe- 68. Ibid. 69. Ibid. 70.

"Commissioner Nicholas Pinto,"</page><page sequence="22">114 1913 CIVIL RIGHTS ACT less, the problem of resort exclusion has become in recent years less and less of a problem. This change in attitude may be attributed to several factors. First, the "business" of exclusionary anti-Semitism has become unprofitable. The postwar years have seen a prolific growth in the number of hotels and resorts serving the leisure-time needs and wants of Ameri- cans. The competition for the entertainment dollar is keen. Jews as a group spend millions of dollars yearly on vacation-time activities. Most hotelkeepers now recognize that it is bad economics to limit the range of possible patrons by excluding Jews."71 Secondly, the recent increased popularity of "Jewish" or "Kosher" hotels, among Jews and Gentiles alike, has contributed to changes in resort hotel policies. Hotelkeepers have perceived a general change in attitude among their Gentile clientele toward associating with Jews. It is no longer economically advantageous to "advertise" or "hint" that Jews are excluded from a given resort. This change in attitude may also be attributed to the impact of the Holocaust. An Anti-Defamation League report of 1959 points out that "most hotels in the U.S." have become uneasy about overtly advertising a policy of racism which associates them with the enemy whom the United States fought and defeated in World War II.72 Although resort exclusion still exists in some areas of this country, it is no longer an issue which exer- cises the emotions of American Jews. Part III Conclusion: The Importance of Civil Rights Legisla- tion. How important was Marshall's success in 1913 in altering the history of exclusionary anti-Semitism? Has not the historical record shown that "time and education" proved to be the best antidote to prejudice? There were, indeed, few instances-like the Camp of the Pines case-where the legal barrier against discrimination proved effective. Was the battle for passage of the Levy-Wagner Bill worthwhile? It is true that the 1913 Civil Rights Act Amendment did not immedi- ately accomplish its goal, but it was an important step toward the freeing of Jews from all social stigmas. It alerted the Jewish and non-Jewish public to the problem, and placed the actions of discriminating hotel- the report continued, "handed down a finding of 'no probable cause,' stating that in his opinion, the Lake Placid Club was not a place of public accommodation."

The act reaffirmed the government's aversion to social discrimination against any person, regardless of background or faith. The ultimate importance of the Act, however, clearly transcends the single issue of resort discrimination. Marshall's efforts demonstrated that the American Jew was willing and able to stand up for his civil rights. It also showed the political leaders of the state that the Jewish community was well aware of the social status-quo and chafed under it. The fight for the Civil Rights Act of 1913 was an assertion by the leaders of New York Jewry that although they believed in the promise of America, they desired insurance against its subversion by anti-Semitism.</page><page sequence="24">116 1913 CIVIL RIGHTS ACT Appendix LETTER OF LOUIS MARSHALL TO SHERMAN MORELAND May 29, 1907 My dear Mr. Moreland: I am writing to you at the suggestion of Senator Saxe, and of a number of prominent Jews of this country who are greatly interested in the im- mediate passage of the bill introduced by Senator Dowling, Chairman of the Cities Committee, amending the Civil Rights bill, known as Chapter 1048 of the Laws of 1895, and which has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. We are very anxious that this bill shall become a law at this session. I therefore venture to ask you, as the Chairman of the Committee on Rules of the Assembly, to report the bill favorably forthwith, so that it can become a law at this session, and constitute a precedent for other Legislatures which will be asked to follow in the wake of New York. I drafted this bill, as a result of great pressure from all sides, in order to counteract one of the most disgraceful phenomena in our American life-that of the exclusion of the people of the Jewish race and faith from hotels and from the enjoyment of other public conveniences, solely be- cause they are Jews. The abuse is not limited to the mere refusal of ac- commodations, but it is accentuated by the publication of advertisements, the issuance of circulars, the posting of notices, and the mailing of letters and the making of announcements which are of the most insulting charac- ter. Thus, for instance, hundreds of advertisements have been issued by summer hotels, to the effect that there are in their vicinity "no mosquitos, no malaria, no Jews"; that Hebrew patronage is not solicited or catered to; that Jews are not desired; that there are no Jews, dogs, or consump- tives; that only Christians are admitted, or that only Americans are welcome.</page><page sequence="25">JEFFREY GUROCK 117 A few weeks ago, Mrs. Bertha Rayner Frank, one of the most cultured women in this country, a sister of United States Senator Rayner, was greatly affronted at the Marlborough-Blenheim Hotel at Atlantic City, by being informed that her nieces, for whom she sought accommodations, would not be received because they were Jewesses. When publicity was given to this statement, the proprietor of the hotel at first denied knowl- edge of the incident, and stated that there was no such rule in his hotel. Subsequently he made a public apology. And yet, on the very heels of that incident, I am in receipt of a letter from one of the prominent merchants of this city, Mr. Carl J. Deutsch, a man of the highest character, and a gentleman in every sense of the word, who shows that there has been a repetition of this incident, as you will see from the enclosed copy of his letter, which I have just received from him. Last year, a gentleman whom I know intimately, and who is a man of fine character and of the most exemplary manners, wrote to twelve hotels in the Adirondacks for accommodations for himself and family, and was refused admittance on the ground of his faith. One of them had the im- pudence to say to him, that they had accommodations, but they observed from his name that he probably was one of the "chosen people," but that if he presented reliable evidence that he was not, he would be ad- mitted. That same hotel shortly afterwards became famous, on account of a shocking occurrence, a part of which was enacted within its sacred precincts. About a year ago, the Ulster and Delaware Railroad Company pub- lished a pamphlet with regard to the Catskill Mountains, and to defray the expense displayed advertisements from a score of hotels in the region through which it traversed, almost every one of which, contained a slur against the Jewish people. I wish to call your attention to the fact, that these publications are not only an insult and an affront to those who seek hotel accommodations, and are refused them on account of their race and faith, but they are an insult to the hundreds of thousands of law abiding Jews who are not seeking them, and who are content to remain at their own homes. Again, I wish to call your attention to the fact, that thousands of Jews, because they cannot obtain suitable accommodations at watering places in this country, or do not wish to subject themselves to humiliation, annually go to Europe with their families, spending millions of dollars in the aggregate, which, but for the narrow-minded policy of these quasi public agencies, would be circulated in this country.</page><page sequence="26">118 1913 CIVIL RIGHTS ACT The Jews now constitute ten per cent of the entire population of the State of New York, aggregating over 850,000 in number. Every man who has paid any attention to them, knows that they are good citizens. There are no illiterates among them. They are industrious and economi- cal. They are engaged in every department of business. They occupy prominent places in the professions. They pay their taxes cheerfully. The records of our army and navy show that they have been ready to sacrifice their lives for their country. They ask for no special privileges, but they have a right to demand the same protection which is afforded to men of every other race, faith and creed. At all events, they should be protected against wanton and gratuitous insult, and should be made to feel that the Legislature of this State, when its attention is called to this shocking abuse, will not be slow to extend to them, that freedom from discrimina- tion which is theirs by right under the Constitution of the State and of the Nation. I know that it is late in the session, but the merits of the bill are such, that there should be no hesitation about its immediate passage, and I am sure that you and your associates on the Committee on Rules, in con- junction with Senators Saxe, Dowling and Davis, can bring about this much desired legislation. Very truly yours, LOUIS MARSHALL HON. SHERMAN MORELAND, Assembly Chamber, Albany, New York. Note 1: Marshall stated that Dowling introduced the bill.
