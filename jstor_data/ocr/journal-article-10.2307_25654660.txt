RUDAVSKY The first volume in this comprehensive work is an exploration of the history of Jewish philosophy from its beginnings in antiquity to the early mod ern period, with a particular emphasis on medieval Jewish thought Unlike most histories, encyclope dias, guides, or companions of Jewish philosophy, this volume is organized by philosophical topic rather than by chronology or individual figures. There are sections on logic and language; natural philosophy; epistemology, philosophy of mind, and psychology; metaphysics and philosophical theol ogy; and practical philosophy. There are also chap ters on the intellectual background of Jewish phi losophy, including Islamic and Greek thought and the Jewish philosophical textual traditions. With essays by leading scholars in the field, this volume provides the reader with a wonderful overview of the richness and sophistication of Jewish philoso phy in its golden age. _. ! i 1 ^^^KIQBp I; |||li|||llllllis^ j I Hardback / $180.00 920 pages ISBN: 978-0-521-84323-2 The esteemed Cambridge Histories series is now available online for libraries.
