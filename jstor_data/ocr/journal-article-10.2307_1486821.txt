<plain_text><page sequence="1">"A DIFFERENT KIND OF HELL": ORALITY, MULTILINGUALISM, AND AMERICAN YIDDISH IN THE TRANSLATION OF SHOLEM ALEICHEM'S MISTER BOYM IN KLOZET by KENNETH WISHNIA I wish to address two basic questions that are confronted in the translation of "immigrant" or "border" literature:' (1) What is the translator to do with a multilingual source text? And (2) How should one approach a literary transcription of a text that is already a literary transcription of an oral culture, without betraying that culture? The traditional approach, which argues that a translation should sound like "it was written in" the Target Language, would probably posit the following: The Source Language audience was multilingual, and would presumably have understood all of the Source Text, therefore one should translate into a single Target Language so that all of the text can be understood by the Target audience. But recent theorists in the field of translation studies have argued 1. I use "border" in D. Emily Hicks's sense of the term: "What makes border writing a world literature with a 'universal' appeal is its emphasis upon the multiplicity of languages within any single language; by choosing a strategy of translation rather than representation, border writers ultimately determine the distinction between original and alien culture." Hicks, Border Writing: The Multidimensional Text (Minneapolis, 1991), p. xxiii. Further complicating this issue, Andre Lefevere notes that translations themselves are "texts produced on the borderline between two systems."

Very little conclusive work has been done in this area. Michael S. Doyle has written about preserving the deliberate use of foreign terms in a Source Text, but his study is restricted to titles.3 An article by Rogelio Reyes on Chicano literature introduces the term "interlanguage" to refer to a text written "in a synthesis or blend of two separate languages."4 Reyes mentions the "lack of a tradition and lack of methodology"' for approaching a multilingual source text, and sums up the issue as follows: If the purpose of translation is merely to make the message of the original accessible to the English reader, a monolingual presentation would be more appropriate. If, however, a deeper understanding of the original is intended, e.g., of the writer's skill with form and content, the interlineal presentation would be more appropriate.6 Reyes's "interlineal" translation of a Chicano poem takes the following form: I hear huesos [bones] crack in pain y Iloros [and anguish] la bruja pangs [-the witch's pangs] sus hijos han olvidado [her sons have forgotten] ...7 2.

Yiddish writers were by definition multilingual, because Yiddish was never the "master" language of the countries in which they lived; in addition, any Jewish male educated enough to pick up a pen in Yiddish most likely knew Hebrew as well. The classic Yiddish texts may not be interlanguages in Reyes's sense of the term, but they are certainly products of the marginal, cultural hybridization that can be said to characterize border literature.8 The traditional "grandfather" of Yiddish literature, Mendele Moicher- Sforim (ca. 1836-1917), wrote about this Jewish version of what W. E. B. Du Bois, writing of the African-American experience, termed "double consciousness": Our sages have said that a Jew has two souls, a weekday one and a holy one. Our Hebrew language is the holy one, a holy and pure language, in which the world is seen as in a mirror, and which is as old as the world and whose spring will never run dry. The other language is the weekday one, of pain and suffering, as sad as the Jewish soul is during the week. And these two souls, these two languages ... I would not want to exchange for another language.9 This split was so severe that the young David Pinski (1872-1959) did not realize that I. L. Peretz (1852-1915), the Hebrew romantic poet, and Peretz, the Yiddish satirist, were the same person,1' and that the name of the first, ground-breaking Yiddish literary journal, Kol Mevasser, was a Hebrew expression." Peretz believed that "the Jews were in the anomalous position of being an ethnonational group without a truly national language."'2 8. "Marginality may have been the Jew's archetypal experience," says Ruth R. Wisse in her introduction to A Shtetl and Other Yiddish Novellas (New York, 1973), p. 14. 9. Charles A.

In spite of its unifying nature (the "Yiddish speech community . interacted with other far-away Yiddish-speaking communities vastly more than with the neighboring speakers of the local or national non-Jewish languages .... Yiddish literature was launched for a pan-European market of readers")," Yiddish was looked down upon for being "grammarless"'4 and even worse. For those who could absorb themselves in the learning of the Torah to waste their time on [Yiddish literature] was considered sinful .... it was the maskilim's accepted notion that grammatical "confusion" and dialectical divergency in Yiddish stemmed from the original aesthetic sin of "mixture" or "corruption" of Hebrew and German. They believed in a linguistic myth which attributed to Yiddish an aesthetically "pure" past as well as a "fall."'5 The Hebrew-Yiddish split is not unique. Parallel situations exist today between classical and vernacular Arabic, Greek, Tamil, Sinhalese, Hindi, etc. Although the latter binaries are, in Joshua Fishman's words, "genetically related," in all cases the "high" language is "no one's mother tongue."'6 This is similar to the relationship of Latin to the Romance tongues. "As Dante put it: 'Latin is perpetual and incorruptible, and the vulgar language [i.e., Italian] is unstable and corruptible.' " Dan Miron notes that literary bilingualism or multilingualism was common in Europe during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, but has been rare since then because it "goes against our cultural grain. It contradicts our basic modem (i.e., Romantic) notion of good and 'true' literary expression. This expression, we have become inclined to assume, cannot survive the loss of utmost directness, which means that it is usually not to be achieved in any but a native tongue."'8 Although Sholem Aleichem (1859-1916) felt that "even when you write in Hebrew, you think 13.

David Roskies writes that "On both sides of the Atlantic, Sholem Aleichem's stories were read aloud as part of a Friday evening or Saturday afternoon ritual, and even the most unsophisticated listeners could laugh at the trilingual wordplay that now requires lengthy annotation."20 Sholem Aleichem's Mister Boym in Klozet was written in the United States in 1915. It clearly exhibits that the cultural adaptation of Yiddish borrowing did not stop once Yiddish reached the "land of Columbus," but rather picked up speed. Sol Steinmetz mentions the canonization in Yiddish dictionaries of such words as "pedler" and "olrayt," and the unofficial replacement of Yiddish terms with English equivalents such as "biznes," "trobl," and "mister" in Yiddish newspapers.21 All of these appear in this play, and must be dealt with accordingly. In fact, when I was attempting to identify English-Yiddish borrowings in Mister Boym in Klozet, I came across Tsi er vil, ikh zol pedlen mit tey, mit vayn un mit tsigayren?22 Or does he want I should be peddling tea, wine, and cigars? "Pedlen" seemed a likely candidate. But Weinreich's dictionary had it as an entry, quite plainly defined as "peddle."23 But I learned from Steinmetz that this is a borrowing, used so extensively (which makes sense historically, given most immigrants' job prospects), that it was "naturalized" in Harkavy's 1928 dictionary. Perhaps for Mr. Boym, the Americanized Jew, it is "naturalized" 19. Ibid., pp. 18, 64. Again, this is not unique to Yiddish. All languages which were oral, when textualized, have needed an infusion of new vocabulary (e.g., Spanish under Alfonso X, nineteenth-century Romanian; even Latinate terms in English can be traced to this). 20.

But in the mouth of Shprintzel, his newly arrived sister, it is a borrowing. Suzanne Romaine employs the term "code-switching," defined by J. J. Gumpers as "the juxtaposition within the same speech exchange of passages of speech belonging to two different grammatical systems or subsystems." According to Romaine, The type of behavior characteristically referred to as code-switching is obvi- ously different in many respects to what happens in the situation described ... as diglossia . .. where two languages or varieties co-exist and are specialized according to function. There is an almost one-to-one relationship between language choice and social context.24 Additionally, it is common to incorporate the borrowed words into the grammatical structure of the "mother" tongue.25 J. R. Rayfield, however, mentions that the bilingual majority of American Yiddish speakers nearly always quote proverbs, "whether they are English, Russian, Polish or Yiddish," in the original language.26 These last two concepts were useful for solving several translation problems. A second issue is orality. Although historically Jews have had a high rate of literacy, orality and the oral mindset are major structural features in many of the works by the "Big Three" of classic Yiddish literature, Mendele Moicher-Sforim, I. L. Peretz, and Sholem Aleichem. This, too, is a result of the high/low Hebrew-Yiddish split. Although "Jews approximated universal male literacy from the preexilic period of their history onward,"27 that literacy would have been primarily in Hebrew, leaving Yiddish-until the advent of nineteenth-century Yiddish literature-with the second-class status of a grammarless jargon in which appeared (paradoxically) books that were viewed as being only for women. Although Hodl, the daughter of Sholem Aleichem's most famous literary creation, Tevye the Milkman, "reads and writes both Yiddish and Russian,"28 her education represents both the rise of a modernity that will destroy the old lifestyle and also one of the author's 24.

(Cf. Shimele's pride in his daughter, Beylke, in The Jackpot: "God gave me a daughter with a sharp mind .... She can read and write and handle figures like nobody's business! . . . She's a smart girl-she can read Yiddish and Russian and German and anything you want."29 Beylke chooses to run away from home rather than be betrothed to upper-class twit Solomon Fein.) First, some of the general characteristics of orality. "Man without writing thinks in terms of sound groups and not in words, and the two do not necessarily coincide," writes Albert B. Lord, and he goes on to note the religious roots of formulaic repetition.30 Jack Goody includes the following in a list of syntactic differences between the written and spoken registers: Writing has the qualities of reliance on a more deliberate method of organiz- ing ideas, using such expository concepts as "thesis," "topic sentence," and "supporting evidence" ... preferential elimination of false starts, repetitions, digressions, and other redundancies which characterize informal spontaneous speech.31 And among the many characteristics of orality described by Walter J. Ong are its additive, redundant, participatory (nonobjective), agonistic, and formulaic nature.32 We shall now narrow the circle to some specifics of Yiddish orality. Roskies writes that "of all Jewish subcultures Yiddish is the closest to the folk tradition,"33 and Ken Frieden writes, "Sholem Aleichem is best known as an author who speaks for the common people . . . because his digressive, free-associative style is most effective when attributed to untrained narrators."34 29.

Benjamin Harshav attributes the subject of the riddle, "Why does a Jew always answer a question with a question?" (to which the answer is, "Why not?") to "some essential characteristics of 'Talmudic' dialectical argument and questioning, combined with typical communicative patterns evolved in the precarious, marginal, Diaspora existence.""35 Ong widens the scope of this issue to other oral cultures:"In oral cultures a request for information is often interpreted interactively ... as agonistic, and, instead of being really answered, is frequently parried."36 Thus a visitor to County Cork, Ireland, who asks a local, "Is this the post office?" receives the reply, "'Twouldn't be a postage stamp you were lookin' for, would it?"37 So one may question how much of this "special kind of indirection"38 in Yiddish speech patterns is the result of a unique "Talmudic dialectical argument" style ingrained in the culture, or whether it may be a characteristic of all oral cultures. The uniqueness of Yiddish is that it is an oral culture embedded within a literate culture, a true "double consciousness." The question is, How is a translator to deal with this formulaic repeti- tiveness? One prominent translator of Sholem Aleichem, the author's own granddaughter Tamara Kahana, unfortunately did her work before the recent advances in translation theory. Declaring in her introduction to Adventures of Mottel the Cantor's Son that "Yiddish is hardly translatable," she announces, "I have therefore ruthlessly sacrificed strange rhythms and exotic expres- sions . . . for the preservation of a picture of a normal child in abnormal circumstances."'9 Kahana's translations remain authoritative, but clearly this is an unacceptable attitude today. What of the other extreme? Harshav makes a good case for refraining from word-for-word literal translation with his translation of a passage from "Tevye Goes to Eretz Israel": 35.

We have, says I, a great God, says I, and a good God, and a strong God, says I, and nevertheless, says I, may I have the number of blessings as the number of times The-Master-of-the-Universe, says I, comes up with a piece of work that better, says I, that all my enemies should have such a year." ... But she, may she forgive me, is a female, so she says: "You're sinning, Tevye. You must not, says she, sin." "Look at this new thing, says I, did I say something, says I, bad? Would I, says I, go, God forbid, against the ways of the Lord, says I? Because if, says I, He already, says I, created such a beautiful world, says I, that the children are not children, says I, and father-mother are mud, says I, so He probably knows what He has to do." But she does not understand what I say and answers me out of the blue: "I'm dying, says she, Tevye, who will cook your supper?"40 Clearly, there are too many "says I's" for the modem English reader. Hillel Halkin, who writes in his introduction to Tevye the Dairyman, "The translator can and should retain some of these, but being overly faithful to them makes the English tiresome, and I have left quite a few out. Wherever the reader sees one such expression in the English, he can assume there may be more in the Yiddish,"41 has translated the above passage (calling the story, "Tevye Leaves for the Land of Israel") as follows: I said to her, "Eh Golde, my dearest. It says in the prayer book, im kevonim im ka'avodim-it's no different without children than with them. Either way there's a great, kind, merciful God above. I only wish I had a ruble for every dirty trick He's played on us ... " But my wife, may she forgive me, was a female through and through. "It's a sin to talk that way, Tevye," she said. "You musn't be sinful." "What did I say wrong?" I asked her. "Did I say anything against God? I'm sure that if He chose to make a wonderful world like this in which children aren't children anymore and parents are nothing at all, He knew exactly what he was doing... " She didn't follow a word of that, though, because she only said to me in a whisper, looking at me with two eyes that could have crumbled a stone, "Oh, Tevye, I'm dying. Who'll cook your supper when I'm gone?"42 40. Harshav, Meaning of Yiddish, p. 105. 41. Sholom Aleichem, Tevye the Dairyman and the Railroad Stories, trans.

Clearly, this is a vast improvement over excessive literalness, but translators must also be aware of excessive "improvements." To cut the oral elements in a story is to cut an essential cultural quality-to change the text from an oral to a literary style. I. L. Peretz's Hasidic tale, "Oyb Nisht Nokh Hekher" ("If Not Even Higher") exhibits characteristics of an oral tale told by one speaker to one or more listeners. The opening sentence Un der Nemirover flegt slikhes-tsayt yedn frimorgn nelm vern, farshvindn!43 is translated by Eli Katz quite literally as "And every morning at the time for the penitential prayers, the Nemirover rebbe would disappear; vanish!"44 Katz's parallel-text translation is intended to be as literal as possible, and therefore exhibits some of the problems seen above in Harshav's literal Tevye, yet it also contains some elements that have been excised from more literarily informed translations. By beginning the story with the word "And," Peretz marks the tale as words spilling from the mouth of a speaker. Marie Syrkin's translation is probably better for the general reader, but the opening "And" is dropped: "Early every Friday morning, at the time of the Penitential Prayers, the rabbi of Nemirov would vanish."45 Note also how the oral repetition-"disappear; vanish!"-has been cut. Later in the story the voice of the narrator is inserted: Ikh gedenk shoyn nisht, khulin tsi nedorim.46 Katz leaves it in: "I can't remember whether it was 'Profane Things' or 'Vows.' "47 Syrkin drops the sentence completely. Why? One final example of oral repetition in this tale: 43. I. L. Peretz, "Oyb Nisht Nokh Hekher," Ale Verk (New York, 1900), 5:136. 44. I. L.

And because nothing was written on their faces, the two up and ask the third: Halkin, calling the story, "Eighteen from Pereshchepena," renders them as follows: The last remark came from above.

All three stared hard as if trying to read each other's faces. Since nothing was written there, however, the two Jews resumed their interrogation.52 Not only has a great deal of the oral repetition been condensed into a more modem "literary" prose, but an additional oral characteristic is subdued-that of metonymy. In his chapter "Some Psycho-dynamics of Orality," Ong suggests that oral peoples are less prone to abstraction than literate ones.53 51.

It is as if the boots were present, and the person attached to them an abstraction inferred from the boots-something a literate person might not consider to be a formidable leap of logic. (Sholem Aleichem uses this quite effectively to represent a child's viewpoint, as when Mottel repeatedly calls an immigration official "Buttons.")54 So effectively did Sholem Aleichem disguise his narrator's presence in his stories that Yosef Haim Brenner, writing in 1916, asks a question that would never be asked today: But was he a writer? ... he was hardly a writer at all. He transcended all literary genres, literary trends and definitions-he was not a "folk writer," not even "the folk writer," but rather a unique poetic and folk amalgam, a living essence of the folk itself.55 Dov Sadan brings Sholem Aleichem back to human form, but shows how close the writer was to the heartbeat of his people: "It is no accident that Ginzburg and Marek included his lullaby in their anthology [of folk songs] of 1901, thinking it to be a pure folk creation."56 Given that Sholem Aleichem is the voice of the Yiddish-speaking Jews ("the writer of the Diaspora," in the words of one Israeli critic),57 what hap- pened when he, alone among the Big Three, emigrated to America? Between 1877 and 1917 approximately 2.5 million Yiddish speakers emigrated to America.58 To condense or mishandle Sholem Aleichem's examination of the life they found in America is to leave the record unbalanced, with Sholem Aleichem reduced to a perhaps quaint chronicler of an old world long gone. But he is also the chronicler of Jews in transition-mostly in the old world, true, but several stories and plays chronicle the Jewish-American experience.

Wisse makes the case that the "frequent problems of communication" among Eastern European Yiddish speakers depicted in the stories of Sholem Aleichem "suggest the break-up of that civilization, sometimes in gentle stages, sometimes with catastrophic suddenness."61 The plot of "Tsugenumen" concerns just such a breakdown in communication (along class lines) between three Jewish travelers. Sol Gittelman writes The shtetl is breaking up .... The Yiddish writer traditionally wrote about a world and an experience which were commonly shared. In the literature of the Lower East Side, the Jew was no longer concerned with Czarist oppression, pogroms, or quotas for Jews in school. This was all part of the past. There were new problems, new preoccupations, and, ironically, new threats just as disturbing as those in the old world.62 The title of this paper, "A Different Kind of Hell," is taken from Curt Leviant's translation of "Mr. Green Has a Job."63 The narrative, once again, is a monologue spoken to "Mr. Sholem Aleichem," only this time on American soil, in which the speaker discusses leaving behind one kind of chaos in the old country in order to start up a new kind of chaos in the United States-but I am particularly interested in the title, which in Yiddish transliterates as "Meester Green Hot a Dzhab," in which the English words "mister" and "job" are transliterated into Yiddish. The evidence that these are borrowings from English is removed in Leviant's version. In fact, the two tales Leviant translated as "Mr. Green Has a Job" and "The Story of a Greenhorn," both written in the United States, are so full of English borrowings that the standard authoritative edition of Sholem Aleichem's "Monologues" included (and still includes) an extensive glossary of transliterated Englishisms.64 However, of nearly a hundred Englishisms in two brief stories, only one is set off 60.

To ignore them would be to ignore the historical forces that were dividing a community that had been bound together by Yiddish for nearly a thousand years. Khone Shmeruk writes: The appearance of Americanisms in Yiddish in Sholem Aleichem's writings is meant not only to reflect the actual contact of Yiddish speakers with English; also, in his hands it becomes an element of humor, of language play, even providing the basis for comic situations. ... In the last year of his life, Sholem Aleichem achieved virtuosity in this bilingual playing with language in his monologues "Mister Green Has a Job" and "The Story of a Greenhorn."67 If we accept Shmeruk's statement, then to omit this "virtuosity" is a literary injustice. I will use two pages from Tamara Kahana's translation of Adventures of Mottel the Cantor's Son to illustrate the extent to which it glosses the original. Mottel arrives in America, and soon begins to pepper his Yiddish with English words transliterated into Yiddish and set off by quotation marks. These transliterated, quoted Englishisms proliferate, and eventually begin to appear without quotations as they become naturalized. While this linguistic shift is given some cursory treatment in Kahana's translation, most of the examples are suppressed. A single passage of the original text has ten Englishisms: "peyper-baks-fektori," "delivert," "reyz" (a "raise" in salary), "bos," "gud boy," "ollrayt," "groseri-stor," "kostomers," "tap-flor," and "drog-stor."68 Kahana sets off only two: "Boss" and "drugstore."''69 The problem is, How 65.

The following passage is my translation of just such a moment in Mottel:70 Brokhe hates that word the way an observant Jew hates pig. There's another word that my sister-in-law can't abide, that's a "vinde." A "vinde" is what they call here a fenster. Brokhe says regarding this, "Wind and woe should be to them." Today, she can't bear to hear "stockings." You'll never guess that "stockings" are zokn. Or, for example, what would you say about the word "dishes"? Do you think, says Brokhe, that "posude" [Russian: dishes] is a lot nicer? What could be simpler than a lefi? No. It doesn'itsuit them. With them it results that a lefl is a "spun." It's not for nothing that Brokhe says a proverb. (She has her own proverbs.) "Amerike is a land, steyk is a delicacy, fork is a gopel, and Eyngelsh is a language." This passage was completely cut from Kahana's translation. A translator should avoid taking textual liberties that are so extensive that they silence the artist's voice.7 But the ramifications of such errors of omission become even greater if one considers that Sholem Aleichem's work is seen as "the 70.

Melech Grafstein [London, Ont., 1948], p. 222; and Shandler, "Reading Sholem Aleichem," p. 306).

He is an Americanized Jew who liberally peppers his Yiddish with English, she is a "greenhorn" who complains that she can't understand this foreign language English, all the while peppering her Yiddish with Russian. To ignore this issue by cutting it would eliminate the body of the play. I have therefore opted to maintain the multilingual distinctions of the Source Text as follows: (1) to translate the standard Yiddish into English except when it is being compared to English as in the passage above, in which case I transliterate the Yiddish into English; (2) to keep the Englishisms marked in English by transliterating them from their Yiddish transliterations back into English and setting them off with italic capitals, and (3) to use Reyes's interlineal translation technique for the Russian. In case that is a bit hard to follow, allow me to illustrate. Mrs. Boym's first line in the play is, quite simply, English transliterated into Yiddish:7 01' t.11 U .n't3 n ru ),I trx Ow ,l tl~ 0YO. 9 I have transcribed this as: "VAT IZ DI TROBEL VIT YU?" This play contains several examples of English borrowings dropped into the middle of Yiddish sentences. Just one example would be 't . tY ' x ,tamta to lN 1r 1 "T i~ ?a1X1a t1 t3N.,74 which I have translated as: "Why didn't you tell her DAT AY EM NAT ET HOM?" Here, the languages are mixed, but not within a single clause. However, when Mr. Boym asks her where she has been, Mrs. Boym answers, tovr~-7a yj' l ,n X .tJ'K ~2 OyD.75 Transliterated, this is Ikh hob zikh gedrest, which is grammatically correct Yiddish, only the root of the final word is English. The expression should be something like Ikh hob zikh ongeton. However, another common past participle ending is -t, as in "I brought," Ikh hob gebrengt. So Mrs. Boym is taking an English verb, "to dress," and conjugating it as if it were Yiddish. I translated this sentence as: "I was getting GEDRESSED" (despite the fact that Yiddish speakers would not do this in an English sentence). 72. Shandler, "Reading Sholem Aleichem," p. 309. 73.

Ibid.</page><page sequence="18">350 KENNETH WISHNIA Another recurring English-Yiddish melding is the treatment of the English verb "to move" as if it were Yiddish, as in the following two examples:76 =Lr JiK - Ir t f'I T'1 1 n T1 ,t8 'UDV n 1" Mt ,T lyimmoypytllm Badarft geven zogn, az ikh bin nito, az ikh bin avekgeforn, as ikh hob gemuft, az ikh vil zi nit zen-un dats oil! Ikh vel nit mufn! In the first example, "move" is treated as a past participle, "hob gemuft," while in the second, "mufn" takes the grammatically correct infinitive form-grammatically correct, that is, if only the root were Yiddish!" I have translated these two sentences as: You should have said that I am not here, that I've gone away, that I've GEMUFT, that I don't want to see her, UN DATS OLL! I won't MUFN! Note how I have also retained the oral repetition, which is used throughout to indicate how Mr. Boym is driving himself frantic. (e.g., a few lines later, "You're right! You're right! What should I do? Hide me! Lock me up! I'll hide myself! Where can I hide?" Surely, in terms of content, this could be reduced to a single English sentence. But this is physical comedy, and the stage directions indicate that Mr. Boym is running "from one corner to the other, desperately."78 The repetition is essential to the comedy.) Finally Mr. Boym's "greenhorn" sister Shprintzel enters. Though she, too, has grammatically incorporated some Englishisms into her Yiddish, as in Az di ale "biznesen" vos er hot mir gemakht biz aher, toygen oyf kapores.79 All the BIZNESEN that he set me up in up to now are good for nothing. 76.

But her Yiddish is meant to have the flavor of the old country that her brother and sister-in-law have lost. The final word in the above sentence is Hebrew; Weinreich defines it as representing the "scapegoat in [a] pre-Yom Kippur atonement ceremony,"80 certainly a culture-bound concept. This is an example of why it is nearly impossible to do justice to the multilingual nature of Yiddish in translation. The word, like Tevye's Hebrew quotations from the Torah and commentaries, would have been understood by both old and new world Yiddish speakers-but as it is not a recent borrowing, I have translated it into the same standard English as the Yiddish. One would not treat "vocal," "corrupt," and "clandestine" in a twentieth-century English text as borrowings from French and Latin to be set off in translation. Perhaps glossing the Hebrew is a wrong choice. But one must draw the line somewhere. But where? When Shprintzel first enters she asks"8 Shprintzel: He's not here, my bratishek [Russian: brother]? Mrs. Boym: What do you mean, "bratishek"? Sit! Shprintzel: So you've forgotten Yiddish so fast? Bratishek means a bruder [Yiddish: brother]. This Russian/Yiddish pun could be translated as above. However, since a play is intended for presentation without footnotes, I feel the line must be rendered as: "So you've already forgotten Yiddish? Bratishek means a brother." Something is always lost. I have tried to compensate for it elsewhere, as in "to MUFN"; "MUFN" is already in the infinitive, so the "to" should be superfluous; however, since we are not dealing with the grammar of a language, but with a translator's interlanguage, I feel that "to MUFN" is justified. 80.

Sholem Aleichem, "Mister Boynm in Klozet," p. 287.</page><page sequence="20">352 KENNETH WISHNIA At one point Shprintzel uses a complete Russian phrase, given in the original in transliterated Yiddish, Ytmon Ynx Oxta Y3 V I,82 for which I have opted for Reyes's technique and rendered it as: "It's ne mala babe khlopote [Boy, the old lady has troubles!]." There is only one place where I have left an entire Yiddish phrase to stand on its own, ' v T'K ,r11 at I 1m,83 which transliterates as Okh un vey iz mir. This means, quite literally, "Alas and woe is me," which nobody has been able to say seriously in English since Heathcliff disappeared from the pages of Wuthering Heights. But people really do say it in Yiddish. Besides, "Oy vey" is one of those Yiddishisms (like "schmuck," "chutzpa," "kvetch," or "klutz"-the only one included in Webster's Ninth Collegiate Dictionary) that has made the reverse trip--into English, certainly no stranger to multilingual borrowings. In fact, if the nineteenth-century debaters of the Hebrew-Yiddish high-low rivalry had known more about English (few individuals would seriously call English's multilingual mixture "corrupt" or "grammarless" "jargon," charges that Yiddish withstood well into this century), it might have ended the debate and allowed those involved to explore more productive concerns. The issue of translating multilingual texts must not be elided. How else is one to do justice to the social and political distinctions among the "Russified" Yiddish spoken by the rich heir, Solomon Fein in The Jackpot, 84 the "devilish" Germanic Yiddish of characters in I. L. Peretz and I. B. Singer,85 and the "Americanized" Yiddish of the later works of Sholem Aleichem, to say nothing of the world of immigrant and postcolonial "interlanguage" texts that are being produced today? The classic writers were forging literary Yiddish as they went. It must sound new, not cliched, because it "sounded" new to the readers, that is, in their experience of it as literature. We should let literal "foreignness" give us some of this newness. Sholem Aleichem should not be seen as the chronicler of a dead culture in a dying language; his work also points toward continuity. Although much of his experience in the United States was in many ways just as bad as in Europe (poor critical reception of his plays, bad health, money troubles),86 he still 82. Ibid., p. 289. 83.
