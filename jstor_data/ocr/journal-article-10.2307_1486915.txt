<plain_text><page sequence="1">264 BOOK REVIEWS Marc Saperstein. "Your Voice Like a Ram's Horn": Themes and Texts in Traditional Jewish Preaching. Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College Press. 1996. xix, 522 pp. Sermons preserve the most direct expressions of rabbinic edification, eloquence, and guidance intended for the ordinary Jew. Marc Saperstein, whose earlier Jewish Preaching, 1200-1800 (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1989) presented annotated translations of sermons by preachers from the High Middle Ages to the beginning of Emancipation, has long been a persuasive advocate for the idea that sermons are a valuable and untapped resource for understanding Jewish history, spirituality, and thought. In the present volume, which includes eleven thematic essays and seven textual studies, some of them published previously, he offers new insights on how sermons can illuminate various aspects of the Jewish past. Saperstein argues that close readings of homiletic texts can both reveal the endurance and expansion of exegetical traditions and demonstrate the ways in which philosophical and mystical ideas achieved popular dissemination. He also reveals how sermons can serve as mirrors of social crisis and change, and as reflections of Jewish-Christian relations in specific times and places. Saperstein's thematic essays take a variety of forms. In a discussion of sermons for the Days of Awe, he traces the preaching function of "Raise your voice like a ram's horn, declare to My people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sin" (Isa 58:1), which connects the Torah reading for Rosh Hashanah (Gen 22) to a prophetic reading for Yom Kippur. Using examples from preaching manuals, homiletical treatises, and actual sermon texts, Saperstein shows how the identification of preaching with biblical prophecy was made explicit through a variety of interpretations of this verse. Thus, sermons address the difficulty of preaching to diverse audiences through the metaphor of the range of shofar sounds: the preacher must use the blend of tones most appropriate for his audience. Similarly, the three sounds of the shofar may serve as the model for a sermon of ethical and religious rebuke, progressing from a simple sound to a sound of groaning to a sound of wailing and finally to a simple sound again, to indicate the structure of a single sermonic call to repentance. In eighteenth-century Hasidism, one finds the quietistic notion that the preacher, like the shofar, becomes a passive vessel for the divine voice. Saperstein sees a self-conscious effort here to delineate the challenges and pitfalls of Jewish preaching by leaders who were prepared</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 265 to criticize, not only their audiences, but colleagues who failed to measure up to the standards implied by God's charge. In other essays, Saperstein offers examples of how medieval and early modem Christian and Jewish preachers used positive images of the disdained "other" to castigate their flocks. Christian preachers praised Jews for their punctilious observance, their horror at blasphemy, their devotion to learning for themselves and their children, and their loyalty to their faith. Jewish sermons, on the other hand, lauded Christians for establishing universities, for fidelity to the Church, for attentiveness to preachers, for honesty in business, and for the willingness of Christian preachers to criticize those in authority. Saperstein suggests that these sermons demonstrate that Christians and Jews could occasionally transcend their mutual hostility and view one other as an ethical and spiritual model. Elsewhere, Saperstein discusses how eighteenth- century preachers expressed patriotism and support for contemporary military campaigns in their sermons, indications of how pre-Emancipation Western and Central European Jews were already identifying with the destinies and martial triumphs of their countries of residence. Saperstein is careful to post a number of caveats on the use of sermons as historical sources, noting that what has survived are books containing texts of sermons which were almost certainly written and revised for publication sometime after they were delivered. Thus, he asks whether criticisms directed at the Jewish community, a common feature of surviving homiletical literature, were more likely to have been added later in published versions and not actually preached, and whether voiced criticisms of local situations have sometimes been eliminated as not of interest to distant readers. He also wonders whether expressions of dissatisfaction from the pulpit were formulaic and expected on certain occasions, or whether they sometimes indicate an unusual crisis in a specific community. He takes as his test case eighteenth- century Prague, analyzing the sermons delivered between 1755 and 1785 by Zerah Eidlitz, Ezekiel Landau, and Eliezer Fleckeles for evidence of a traditional community in trouble. Certainly the sermons describe and decry a high degree of secularization, and delineate significant lapses in observance of the highest standards of ritual law and sexual mores, as well as questionable economic practices. Yet Saperstein suggests that these protests are hardly new, offering virtually identical sermonic critiques from such places as thirteenth-century Toledo. Rather, he finds indications in the Prague sermons that the preachers themselves felt they were witnessing a crisis of unforeseen dimensions in the Jewish life of their community in which the</page><page sequence="3">266 BOOK REVIEWS forces of traditional life were being overwhelmed. While Saperstein does not believe that the preachers' complaints of drastic dissolution were justified, since their community's underlying assumptions were still fundamentally unchallenged, one must credit them with an uncanny prescience concerning the consequences of the significant changes Central European Jewry was beginning to experience. This volume also contains seven Hebrew documents, with English trans- lations and introductions, four from medieval Spain, two from seventeenth- century Amsterdam, and one from eighteenth-century Prague. These include three sermons, three eulogies, and a fifteenth-century preacher's manual from Spain, perhaps the earliest extant example of a Jewish version of the popular Christian Ars Praedicandi genre. While the preacher's manual was written in Hebrew, the other Hebrew texts that Saperstein presents and analyzes were almost certainly delivered, if not initially composed, in the vernacular language most comfortable for the preacher's audience. The linguistic issue is an important one that Saperstein does not address as thoroughly as he might. Further discussion of how Hebrew renditions of sermons, prepared for scholarly peers, may have departed from the original vernacular homilies, and how this affects their usefulness as historical sources, would have been welcome. In the case of Ezekiel Landau's 1780 eulogy for Empress Maria Theresa, delivered in the synagogue in the presence of numerous Christian dignitaries, Saperstein does analyze the Hebrew text against the German versions; more details of where the texts differed (and why) would have been interesting. In general, however, this volume prompts few complaints. Written in a clear and engaging manner, with ample and broad documentation, it directs our attention to an important body of Jewish literature which has a great deal to teach us. Judith R.
