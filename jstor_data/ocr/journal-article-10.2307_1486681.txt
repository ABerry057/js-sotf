<plain_text><page sequence="1">Steven M. Lowenstein. The Berlin Jewish Community: Enlightenment, Family and Crisis, 1770-1830. New York: Oxford University Press, 1994. Steven M. Lowenstein, whose work has so enriched our understanding of German-Jewish modernization, turns his attention here to the "crisis" of Berlin Jewry between 1770 and 1830, a "crisis" ushered in by unprecedented possibilities of emancipation and assimilation. Although we already know a great deal about this community through the work of Michael A. Meyer, Jacob Katz, Alexander Altmann, and Deborah Hertz, Lowenstein is the first historian to submit the community as a whole to a thoroughgoing social analysis, an effort facilitated by the community's relatively small size-some 3,500. By interweaving a wealth of quantitative material, including tax lists, censuses, subscription lists to Enlightenment periodicals, genealogical data on Jewish marriages, and baptismal records, together with more traditional qualitative sources, Lowenstein presents the first comprehensive social history of this community. By examining the Berlin Jewish community in its entirety, rather than focusing exclusively on elites, Lowenstein provides answers to a host of</page><page sequence="2">194 BOOK REVIEWS questions about which we previously could only speculate. To what extent, for example, did the high rates of divorce, conversion, and illicit love affairs, generally associated with Jewish elites, influence the community as a whole? Were the experiences of the Jewish salonieres typical of those of average Jewish women? Did men and women experience modernization differently, and why? And how did the social backgrounds of those who adhered to the new Jewish movements-the Haskalah, or Jewish Enlightenment movement, and the early Reform movement--differ from those of their Orthodox opponents? At the same time, by tracing these changes over three generations, Lowenstein provides us with a more nuanced understanding of the way the process of modernization unfolded. In particular, he highlights the distinctive stages in this process and shows that the family, a unit of analysis frequently ignored, served as an important conduit of social behavior. Although concluding that the Berlin Jewish community was atypical in many respects, Lowenstein nevertheless insists that it deserves its time-honored place at the center-stage of modern Jewish historiography. Indeed, he argues, it was precisely the fact that Berlin was atypical that explains why German-Jewish communities elsewhere were able to experience emancipation and integration far less traumatically. According to Lowenstein, Berlin Jewry did not experience modernization as a slow incremental process, as Azriel Shohat has suggested. Rather, he believes that modernization in Berlin emerged in two distinct phases: a period of "peaceful modernization," beginning with the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) and lasting until 1786; and a period of prolonged crisis, lasting from 1786 until 1830. Prior to the Seven Years' War, Lowenstein argues, there were few signs of impending crisis. Established in 1671, when fifty expelled Jewish families from Vienna were granted residence rights, the Berlin Jewish community, while wealthier than most, remained extremely traditional and lived under a regime of harsh anti-Jewish disabilities. The Seven Years' War ushered in two major changes, which, according to Lowenstein, inaugurated the process of modernization. First, there emerged an upper crust of extraordinarily wealthy Jews: the Ephraims, the Itzigs, and the Isaac-Fliesses. On the legal front, these "coin millionaires" opened up the debate over Jewish rights, since they began to lobby for exemptions from anti-Jewish disabilities for themselves and their families. At the same time, they provided the major impetus for the Haskalah, the principal intellectual movement of the time. While the Haskalah was important in its own right, it is likely, Lowenstein argues, that it would not have gotten off the ground without</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 195 the financial support of these plutocrats. Not only did they shower Moses Mendelssohn with tax exemptions and honors, but they subscribed in large numbers to Haskalah publications. This period of slow and gradual change was characterized by two tendencies. On the one hand, there was an extraordinary degree of intellectual ferment and social acculturation, particularly among the elites, as evidenced by their changing styles of dress, increased use of German, growing social contacts with Christians, and emerging patterns of bourgeois consumption. On the other hand, these same elites remained staunchly committed to traditional religious observance. This successful synthesis was made possible, according to Lowenstein, by the moderating influence of the Haskalah, and especially of Mendelssohn himself, who strove always to balance Enlightenment values with strict Orthodox observance. This synthesis began to break down after the deaths of both Mendelssohn and Frederick the Great in 1786. Now, according to Lowenstein, the era of slow and peaceful change gave way to a full-scale social and religious crisis. According to Lowenstein, three principal factors fueled this crisis. First, a new and more radical Jewish communal leadership emerged under the leadership of David Friedlander, which began to lobby for full emancipation. This leadership was far more insistent than Mendelssohn had been about attaining full civil rights and felt particularly aggrieved by the growing gulf between its social and political status. A second factor involved was the economic collapse of many of the old elites, and the rise of a new elite less concerned with preserving traditional Judaism. And finally, the rise of the Romantic movement not only posed a significant intellectual challenge to Mendelssohn's synthesis, but it sanctioned all sorts of behavior that severely threatened traditional Jewish norms: sexual license and romantic love, and greater freedom for women. It is in his analysis of the social crisis that gripped Berlin Jewry at the turn of the eighteenth century that Lowenstein makes his most significant contribution. By moving away from a focus on elites, and by examining the community as a whole, he is able to answer three questions about which we previously could only speculate. First, Lowenstein asks whether the wave of conversions was as extensive as some scholars have maintained. Second, he asks who precisely was converting, having illicit love affairs, and bearing out-of-wedlock children. And third, he asks whether men and women were affected differently by these trends, a question that takes on special significance, since subsequent generations blamed this societal breakdown squarely on women.</page><page sequence="4">196 BOOK REVIEWS With respect to each of these issues, Lowenstein demonstrates that they had repercussions far beyond the confines of elite Jewish circles. Indeed, a constant theme of his book is that while the elite pioneered the way, others soon followed: "the well-known affairs and conversions in the Berlin Jewish elite were repeated (if on a somewhat reduced scale) in many segments of Berlin Jewry" (p. 21). Divorce, illegitimacy, and conversion were, Lowenstein shows, closely intertwined, and all experienced a dramatic upsurge in the years following Mendelssohn's death. Although only about 2 percent of couples married in the 1760s got divorced, 14 percent of those married between 1800 and 1804 did, and one out of every four of these divorces was associated with a conversion. Moreover, the Jewish illegitimacy rate, which elsewhere in Germany was significantly lower than that of the non-Jewish population, in Berlin rose to 18.3 percent in the first years of the nineteenth century, a rate that paralleled that of the non-Jewish community. Moreover, the high illegitimacy rate was closely linked to conversion; of all those baptized before the age of thirteen between 1790 and 1799, over 83 percent were born out-of-wedlock. And, although literary sources tend to focus on the love affairs between Jewish women and Christian men, statistical evidence reveals that the majority of the illegitimate children born of mixed relationships were sired by Jewish men and Christian women. Furthermore, illegitimacy was by no means restricted to Christian-Jewish relations; there were high rates of illegitimacy resulting from Jewish interrelationships as well, particularly among lower-class women and lower-middle-class men. With respect to conversion, Lowenstein demonstrates that although it did.not quite engulf one-half of the community, as some scholars have claimed, its scope was nevertheless extensive. Using genealogical records compiled by the Nazis, Lowenstein acknowledges that 1,582 Jews converted between 1790 and 1830. Since the criterion used in these genealogies was racial (i.e., children of Jewish fathers and Christian mothers would have been considered Jews, contrary to Jewish law), and since many of these converts were illegitimate children, the extent of conversion among those technically considered Jews was not as high as it appears at first glance. According to Lowenstein, there were about 1,600 baptisms over a sixty-year period, averaging out to some twenty-seven per year, and he confirms Deborah Hertz's estimate that about 7 percent of all Jews in 1812 had converted. Nevertheless, among the younger generation, conversion was more widespread, and approximately one in seven, or 14.3 percent, of those in the generation born around 1800 eventually converted. Of individuals</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 197 married in Berlin between 1759 and 1813, a full 20 percent either converted or had a child who converted. Lowenstein also shows that there was not a single wave of conversion, but in reality three distinct waves that differed significantly in sociological makeup. The first wave, which took place between 1790 and the first years of the nineteenth century, consisted mostly of adult women of modest background who converted in order to marry and legitimate their out-of- wedlock children. There were a number of wealthy converts as well, but the vast majority of these left Berlin to be baptized, a sign of the degree to which conversion still carried a negative stigma. The second wave began around 1800 and lasted until the early 1820s. It was during this period that many elite families began to convert en masse, a trend that sent shock waves through the community and severely diminished the communal coffers. The third and final stage of conversion occurred between 1822 and 1830. This phase consisted mostly of young men between eighteen and twenty-nine years of age who were converting primarily for career reasons, particularly in response to the new spate of anti-Jewish legislation during this decade. In contrast to earlier converts, most of these individuals were not native Berliners, but were recently arrived migrants from Prussia's eastern provinces. Not only does Lowenstein present these statistics, but he interprets them as well, always situating his data within the framework of existing historical literature. Concurring with Jacob Katz, Lowenstein insists that the majority of converts maintained close links to the Jewish community, a trend that suggests they were not treated with the same opprobrium as converts in the past. Moreover, he substantiates the prevailing view that converts to some extent had their own special subculture; nearly one-third of those who converted married other Jews or converts. At the same time, he demonstrates that conversions clustered in families. Of 250 Berlin Jews in 1812 who eventually converted, 113 had a parent, sibling, or child who also converted, thus permitting us to speak of a sort of "chain conversion." While many women in particular converted to legitimate their children, Jewish couples frequently followed the example set by Abraham Mendelssohn and his wife, converting their children without converting themselves. Moreover, Lowenstein substantiates the prevailing view that men and women expe- rienced these trends differently. With regard to conversion, he shows that women did in fact lead the way, not only among the elites, but among lower-class women as well. Between 1770 and 1805, 70 percent of all Jews baptized in their twenties were women, although this predominance subsided</page><page sequence="6">198 BOOK REVIEWS after 1805, with the decline of the salons. While Lowenstein attributes this tendency in part to traditional explanations, such as the fact that elite women were more attracted to Romanticism because they had more leisure time and were not involved in business, which would have necessitated a more rationalistic frame of mind, he suggests that sociological factors were also involved. While in reality more illegitimate children were born to Jewish men and Christian women, Jewish women tended to convert earlier and more frequently than men in order to marry and legitimate their out-of-wedlock children. According to Lowenstein, the perception that women predominated in having illegitimate children developed in part because men could more easily hide their illegitimate children by placing them in orphanages, and in part because these children were not technically regarded as Jews and did not, therefore, become the responsibility of the community. Lowenstein also challenges the conventional view that women, due to their lack of traditional Jewish education and their exposure to secular education, were more susceptible to modernization than men. The distinc- tion between men's and women's experiences, Lowenstein insists, was not between modernizing women and traditional men, but between two different paths of modernization. The modernization of men appeared more moderate precisely because it occurred through institutional forms, such as Haskalah publications and Reform activities. Women eager to modernize did not have any institutional forms of expression; charities, which later served this purpose, did not yet exist. The modernization of women was thus more personal and individualistic, and hence seemed more threatening. Finally, Lowenstein raises the long-debated question of whether adher- ence to Haskalah was the principal cause of conversion among subsequent generations. On the one hand, he shows that the descendants of the Maskilim (whose names we know from lists of subscribers to Haskalah publications) were in fact far more likely to convert than descendants of Orthodox Jews (whose names were obtained from a 1778 membership list of the burial society). Moreover, Lowenstein shows that the strong correlation between adherence to Haskalah and conversion in subsequent generations persists even when wealth is controlled for. While such a tendency might suggest that the Haskalah was responsible for the subsequent societal breakdown, Lowenstein cautions that other factors need to be taken into account. Indeed, he sees the Haskalah itself as a symptom of a more general phenomenon: the inability of traditional Judaism to accommodate to change. As he sees it, the critical question is why so many</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS 199 Jews left traditional Judaism in the first place. For the first generations of Jews undergoing modernization, the problem was not so much their departure from tradition, but the fact that there were as yet no alternative forms of Judaism. For Jews seeking integration, there were only two choices: they could either remain Orthodox, an option that was becoming increasingly problematic given their bourgeois status and desire to acculturate, or they could leave Judaism altogether, either through religious indifference, which was rampant, or through conversion. And, as Lowenstein suggests, the difference between these options probably seemed infinitesimal to many. Thus, he argues, the radical nature of Jewish modernization in Berlin Jewry during these years was due not to the Haskalah or the early Reform movement, but rather to their weakness, to the fact that they did not yet offer viable alternatives to Orthodoxy. "The greatest influence in creating the radicalism in Berlin," Lowenstein states, "was the pioneering nature of the event itself' (pp. 191-192). Paradoxically, the process of modernization became significantly less traumatic for subsequent generations precisely because alternatives to Orthodoxy now existed. By the mid-nineteenth century, most Jews felt they could acculturate and modernize without having to leave Judaism altogether. Hence, although Lowenstein acknowledges that the early Reform movement did not stem the initial tide of conversion, he suggests that the success of the Reform movement several decades later had precisely this effect. Although Lowenstein has not overturned all our prevailing assumptions about this period, he has greatly expanded our existing knowledge, first, by illustrating the extent to which these various social trends influenced all segments of the community, and not only the elites; and second, by illustrating how these changes played themselves out over the course of three generations. Not only has Lowenstein uncovered an enormous wealth of new social data, but he has provided us with a new interpretative framework for analyzing the process of modernization, especially by highlighting the hitherto-neglected role of the family. Indeed, as Lowenstein demonstrates, the crisis of Jewish identity during this era cannot be separated from the crisis of the family, a crisis reflected in the skyrocketing rates of divorce, illegitimacy, and conversion. What is so refreshing about Lowenstein's book is that despite the abundance of quantitative material presented here, the impact of culture and ideology are never minimized; nor is the role of individuals. Indeed, one of the great strengths of this study is that it skillfully interweaves the quantitative analysis with the cultural, religious, and political history of this era. One can only hope that this highly imaginative, sophisticated, and</page><page sequence="8">200 BOOK REVIEWS thought-provoking work might inspire renewed interest in social history, a methodology that unfortunately has fallen out of fashion in recent years. As Lowenstein's book proves, we still have much to learn from this methodology, particularly insofar as it alone can illuminate the complex interaction between culture and ideology, on the one hand, and social behavior, on the other.
