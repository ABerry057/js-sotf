Paris: Gallimard, 2004. 687 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000451 Initiating a revival of the complete works of Moses Mendelssohn and invigorating a renaissance in Mendelssohn studies with his magisterial biography, Alexander Altmann reanimated Mendelssohn research during the 1960-1980s, with a lasting impact. Recovering the pioneering research done in Weimar Germany that, with the demise of German Jewry, had sunk into oblivion, Altmann 's mission seemed to be to retrieve the torch from a lost world and pass it on to a new generation. Altmann's vision still dominates much of our approach to and perceptions of Mendelssohn, though his own view of Mendelssohn remains somewhat of a puzzle. Often taken as a work of love and devotion, a letter by Altmann published in 1999 reveals a startlingly ambivalent, if not complicated, relationship to his object of study and scholarship. Writing to Gershom Scholem, whose Sabbatai Sevi had been published at the same time as Altmann's Mendelssohn biography, he muses about the fact that the two books represent, as it were, companion pieces of some kind: "In einem gewissen Sinn war ja auch Mendelssohn ein 'falscher Messias.'"1 Although the coincidence of the two towering studies is indeed startling, their agendas stand at opposite ends of historical study. If Scholem's book represents the Jewish historian's ultimate masterwork in the study of counter-history, Altmann's is an attempt to reclaim Mendelssohn's central importance, not only for the history of German philosophy and culture but also for Jewish intellectual history. Despite?or even because of?the obvious differences between Scholem and Altmann, Altmann's remark highlights an aspect of the legacy of Mendels sohn research that still informs the way Mendelssohn is seen today. The case of Mendelssohn is paradigmatic for Jewish studies because it poses a methodological question about how to study the lacunae that scholarship and research have systematically pushed to the margins and that traditional concerns have rendered invisible or illegible. The critical study of Mendelssohn, therefore, also must address the problem of how to recover, reexamine, and rethink aspects that research and scholarship have so effectively eclipsed. Mendelssohn, in a way, is the classic that modem Jewish philosophy never had. As the never-ending edition of Mendelssohn's works approaches its completion 80 years after the first volumes appeared in Weimar Germany, the edition signals, more than any thing else, the need for an up-to-date edition. Ironically, the publication of the complete edition of Mendelssohn's writings underscores the fate of an author whose legitimate claim to classic status remains unrequited. The Mendelssohn edition has already become historical before its completion, and thus it is a case study of the complicated, if not conflicted, story of the Jewish and German recep tion of Mendelssohn. 1.

It is high time to begin to think about a new Mendelssohn if the old circles are no longer to be run. Dominique Bourel's ambitious study is a welcome chance to break out of this mt, and it is poised to become the standard by which future Mendelssohn research will be measured. Almost as long as Altmann 's biography, Bourel's study complements and expands the picture of Moses Mendelssohn. The most important aspect that Bourel adds is a sophisticated contextualization of Mendelssohn's cultural and intellectual trajectory within the context of European?not just Prussian or German?modernity. His in-depth excursions into the historical landscape paint a picture in which Mendelssohn's particular import and significance gain more precise historical contours than previous accounts have given. If the wealth of information that springs from the author's immense emdition seems at times to deter the reader, it also performs a carefully calibrated balance that negotiates superbly between Jewish and German sensibil ities. Because the author is not party to either side but is writing from across that big European "fence" known as the Rhine, he succeeds in painting a portrait of a philosopher, champion of individualism in the style of Humboldt?whose mentor he had been?and of an uncompromising notion of emancipation whose vivid colors emerge in a rich and differentiated composition. Based on his five-volume "these d'?tat" of 1995, Bourel's book is a well researched study. The bibliography alone is a hundred pages long, and is both comprehensive and up-to-date. Bourel not only masters Mendelssohn research with impeccable aplomb but also safely navigates the currents of Jewish studies and its concerns. As a result, his work presents a welcome contribution to the debate on modem Jewish culture. The "new" Mendelssohn opens up a new view on the critical potential that is the promise of Jewish studies. In Bourel's account, Mendelssohn is more than just a fine product of his time or an odd noncontemporary response to it; rather, he emerges as a creative figure whose intricate engagement with and relationship to his time explains how he became the voice that his interlocutors appreciated so profoundly. The importance of this study lies in the way it limns the critical con tours of an exponent who is not just between two worlds?as is often argued?but is firmly grounded in the different worlds that he inhabits and, in rum, helps to redefine. Mendelssohn's theoretical grasp reaches, as Bourel suggests, well beyond the two-world theory of German and Jewish and the curious and dated common space they would share for less than a century and a half?a view that has been ratified by the seemingly superior wisdom of post-Holocaust hindsight. Rather, by doing away with this conventional view, we begin to understand Mendelssohn as an early cosmopolitan citizen who does not shy away from the discourse of national differences because his concerns reach deeper. This is what the title of the book for which he is best known signals: Jerusalem, that is, a pointed and prophetic reference that introduces an alternative notion of universalism in dialogue with an alterity that still awaits recognition. Bourel helps us comprehend that the conventional view of Mendelssohn as a man stand ing between or straddling two worlds as a superimposed category distorts the 212</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews substance of his significance. Mendelssohn, even before he entered Berlin, lived in Dessau?not simply in a Jewish world in a German town?and he experienced the vibrant conjunction of a plurality of worlds that intersected in creative and often inspiring ways. For what else represented the "German" and the "Jewish" worlds at the time than highly dynamic signifiers at a moment when modem national and religious cultures and traditions were being reinvented? Reducing Mendelssohn's challenge and problematic to a German Jewish dilemma is not only simplistic but also distorts the multifaceted impetus of his whole agenda. Behind the "German" and the "Jewish" stand not only the religious and national problematics but also the social, political, cultural, and philosophical differences that the eighteenth century confronted. If one finally understands that the Enlightenment was not just about the claim and status of reason but, more poignantly, about the challenge to move beyond the traditional dichotomies of oppositional constmctions into the open space of the new intellectual world, Mendelssohn becomes part of the project of addressing the different and conflicting strands of European traditions productively. Seen this way, Mendelssohn's trajectory emerges as a serendipitous success in negotiating innovation and traditions?a negotiation that hinges on the interdependence of tradition and innovation. Mendelssohn, in fact, did not operate in isolation but was a resolutely dia logical thinker. Not only did he write his first works as dialogues?dialogue was his preferred mode of investigation, examination, and critical thought. Bourel's painstaking attention to the details of the historical constellation recon structs the creative context that defines not only Mendelssohn's thought but, in an equally fundamental way, that of his interlocutors. Lessing, Nicolai, Kant (to some degree), and the exponents of the new Pmssian bureaucratic intelligentsia such as Dohm and Klein are not simply presented as sources or targets of influence but the critical force field whose synergetic conjunction is necessary to understand the full compass of Mendelssohn's significance. Dohm, Lavater, and Jacobi, among others, are given unusually detailed consideration. But it is, surprisingly, these seemingly extensive detours that fill in cmcial bits of a mosaic that crystallizes into a sharp, distinct, and contras tive picture that, without the patient and attentive recollection of detail after detail, would have remained flawed and incomplete. In addition, Bourel's ele gantly moving narrative compensates for the occasional onslaught of infor mation that turns out to be cmcial for the reader who follows the unfolding of the story, a narrative that Bourel concludes with a pointed aper?u: If Men delssohn has become so removed from our contemporary world, could the reason simply be that he was a happy Jew (juif heureux)! Bourel puts his finger on a key issue, and there is no doubt that the tremendous divide that sep arates us from Mendelssohn was shaped by his staunch and self-reliant self consciousness, a form of trust and grounding few would be willing to forgive. If scholarship has repeated for generations that Mendelssohn gave up messianic hope for emancipation, Bourel reminds us that we, alternatively, need to realize that, contrary to such claims, Mendelssohn's critical position presents a messianic resistance that imagines modernity as the harbinger not 213</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews just of hope but of the actual promise of happiness: a modernity that calls for a universalism with a difference.
