Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998. xii, 283 pp. Paula Hyman's The Jews ofModern France is the first volume in a new series on Jewish commuities edited by David Sorkin. Hyman has written a superb inter- pretative history. Incorporating classical texts as well as recent monographs in French, English, and Hebrew, she calls attention to the major issues, tensions, and socioeconomic developments in French Jewish history from 1789 to 1989 without either sacrificing their complexity or losing the reader in an overabundance of detail. The themes of emancipation, acculturation, assimilation, antisemitism, and Zionism are woven throughout the text in a manner that facilitates an appreciation of how they have continued to shape the identities of French Jews. Demographic and occupational shifts are emphasized, as are the international connections between the Jews of France and their coreligionists in other countries-especially in the Maghreb. The population transfusions at the end of the nineteenth and the early part of the twentieth century are graphically illustrated, highlighting both the struggles faced by the East European immigrants and their transformative impact on the na- tive Jews. Lastly, comparisons are intelligently made between French Jewish and German Jewish history as well as between Jews and non-Jews living in France. Hyman's approach is measured and nuanced. She does not, however, refrain from adding her own interpretations on some frequently debated issues, such as Voltaire's contribution to modern antisemitism; the accomplishments and inten- tions of Napoleon; the impact of the Dreyfus Affair; the responses of French Jew- ry to immigration, especially in the 1930s, and to Zionism; and finally, the French Jewish establishment's less than exemplary behavior during the Second World War. Whether one agrees with Hyman's analyses or not (and this reviewer generally does), there is no question but that they are based on the recent and in some in- stances path-braking research of both American and French historians. Before and after her comprehensive discussion of the Dreyfus Affair, Hyman carefully distinguishes between the virulent antisemitism present in France and the high degree of integration of French Jewry. Neither Germany nor Austria could have had a Dreyfus Affair, she reminds us, since no Jew had achieved a parallel position in the army of either country. And, although she carefully enumerates the criticisms of the Jewish estabishment at the time of the Affair (e.g., their passivity), she also suggests that the French Jewish reaction was "more varied and complex than earli- er assessments have conveyed" (p. 109). Significantly, and not for the only time, Hy- man warns against reading past events through the lens of more recent ones. 394</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews The Dreyfus Affair may have played a catalytic role in Herzl's thinking, but it did not lead the native French Jewish establishment, lay or rabbinic, to support Zion- ism. On the contrary, the French establishment generously supported Palestinian Jewry but remained opposed to Zionism. Hyman suggests that its non-Zionist pro- Palestinianism was merely a strategy to weaken the institutions of the Zionist move- ment (pp. 140-141). Only in the 1930s, when Zionism seemed to offer a practical resolution to the growing refugee problem, did this strategy change. French Jewish involvement in the refugee question has been the subject of much debate and no less polemic. Hyman succinctly summarizes Vicki Caron's recent study, suggesting that it provides a more complete picture than previous- ly available of the divisions among French Jewry on policies toward the refugees and the consensus ultimately reached, as well as the French Jewish establish- ment's decision to challenge politically the government's decrees of 1938 (pp. 153-154). No controversy has been as heated as the one concerning the reactions of the Jews of France to the Nazi occupation. Arguing that it is morally and method- ologically untenable for a historian to specify correct responses from the vantage point of hindsight, Hyman presents a lengthy and careful overview of the events; the decisions made; and the actions and motivations of the major protagonists, in particular the official organization of the Jews of France, the UGIE Was it collab- orationist, she asks, because it cooperated with the Germans and Vichy in order to address the needs of their victims, or do its intentions excuse it from charges of collaboration, regardless of their effect on Jews? Her answer attributes the fate of the Jews during the Holocaust primarily to those who were actually in a position of power and authority. Decisions made by the UGIF, however, whether intention- al or not, facilitated the Nazis' task. Needless to say, no history that covers more than two hundred years can es- cape minor mistakes and omissions. The Jewish population of Paris at the time of the Revolution was at least 1,000 and not 500 (p. 7); the Metz Society's question was actually "Are there means of making the Jews more useful and happier in France?" (p. 20); and the morejudaico was eliminated in 1846 but never official- ly abolished (p. 55). One would have liked even more attention paid to individual voices, especially those of women. Finally, although there are excellent illustra- tions at the beginning of each chapter, there is neither a chronology nor a set of maps, both of which would have been useful. France now boasts the largest Jewish population in Western Europe. Its com- munities are diverse and vibrant, and, as the battle over the post of Grand Rabbi recently demonstrated, its future is contested. But if an "identity virus" is besieg- ing both the Jews and the country, it is hardly an unfamiliar one to those who ex- plore the two-hundred-year odyssey presented in Paula Hyman's book.
