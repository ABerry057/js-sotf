<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Philip R. Davies. In Search of Ancient Israel. Journal for the Study of the Old Testament Supplement Series 148. Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1992. 172 pp. In this volume, Davies sets out self-consciously to author a "savage" attack (p. 47) against history writing that he flogs as theologically apologetic, and to stimulate a paradigm shift in the writing of history about ancient Israel. Additionally, he offers his own reconstruction of who, where, how, and why biblical literature was authored as an agenda for new scholarship. Initially, Davies distinguishes between "biblical Israel," the Israel that is a literary construct of the Bible itself, that is presented to uncritical readers by those who wrote, edited, and redacted the Tanakh; "historical Israel," the Israel that occupied the highlands of Judah, Benjamin, and Manasseh during the Iron Age; and "ancient Israel," a scholarly construct based on a combination of the first two Israels. These heuristic categories then become the bull's eyes at which he aims his arguments. He attacks all books whose titles are similar to "A History of An- cient/Early/Old Testament Israel" as misunderstanding the nature of literature and erring by assuming the (essential) historicity of much of biblical "history writing." Acknowledging that many recent authors of such books do not give much credence to narratives about the pre-Davidic period, where only an historical kernel or memory may be preserved, he still faults them for considering narratives about post-Davidic events as useful for their reconstructions. Davies argues that they have it all wrong and that by using these data, and by accepting the biblical version of stories, its chronology of events, and its theological explanations of causality, they are merely reproducing its story while touching it up here and there with corrections and verifications from extrabiblical archaeological and epigraphical sources to make their work appear modern and scientific. For Davies, such scholars not only misinterpret what they consider data, but also they have prioritized their sources incorrectly. He deconstructs all 153</page><page sequence="2">154 BOOK REVIEWS biblical narrative into fictive compositions worthless for the reconstruction of actual events. Their sole value lies in their being a reflection of the needs and ideas of some culture, but not the one that they ostensibly reflect. Therefore, Davies believes that priority must be given to archaeological data. But at the same time he argues that there is nothing in the archaelogical record to indicate that the various entities referred to as Israel in the fictive biblical narratives ever existed, nor do the available Iron Age data enable us to posit a society of the type that might have authored the biblical texts. That society, according to Davies, is found in Yahud of the Persian period. He reconstructs this society by augmenting the fictional accounts in Ezra-Nehemiah, which are deemed to have some historical worth, with some paltry archaeological data, with suppositions about what must have occurred, and by employing theories that describe (or predict[?]) the evolution of societies. He thus is able to posit a society of nonindigenous people, forcibly moved into the Jerusalem area by the Persians, who took some ancient whispers from the local peasantry and concocted the whole shebang in order to indigenize itself. This took place ca. 500-300 B.C.E., i.e., during the Persian period. If valid, then Davies's arguments illuminate a "Dark Age" in Israelite- Jewish history, and inadvertently turn the lights off in the Israel Iron Age. I do not consider them valid. Davies has presented his case "for students rather more than for ... colleagues" with few footnotes, and most of these refer to volumes published in the JSOT series, of which he is an editor (pp. 7-8). He has built it on the strength of unanswered rhetorical questions, false analogies, and questionable sociological theories. His far-reaching conclusions about the historical value of biblical narra- tives are endemic nowadays to many who belong to the "Bible as Literature" school. These, under the influence of schools of literary criticism that evolved through reading fictive texts, have come to treat all biblical texts as works of fiction. Davies has just taken this one step farther, concluding that if it reads like fiction and is malleable to an analysis developed for fiction, it must be fiction. The problem of any historical text with a demonstrable literary quality, e.g., Jewish Wars by Josephus, is actually not much of a problem for an historian who distinguishes between the events, the rhetorical art of historiography, which can be subjected to literary analysis, and historiosophy,</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 155 the interpretive matrix that informs the writing of history. Davies fails to make these elementary distinctions, which are rather obvious to anybody who has studied historiography or who has done nonbiblical history. The bleak archaeological picture that he draws for the Iron Age is not so bare as he proposes. Good archaelogists understand the objectives of their discipline and the limitations of their data. "Archaeology" makes no pronouncement about the oral historical traditions or religious thinking of the people who inhabited their sites; "History" does. Recently, some archaeologists working in Iron Age Israel have chosen to cross disciplinary lines, but rather than studying the historian's craft, which would empower them to exploit the narrative material and to generate explanations, they have borrowed explanatory models of society from social anthropology. This has resulted in descriptions of complex literate societies that make them appear flat, lifeless, and prehistoric. Some biblicists, Davies included, have followed them, and his picture is the result of his model. Unfortunately, such models are abstractions of specific, empirical, time- bound descriptions and have no predictive power. They cannot be used to infer unattested data. The shoe-homing of archaeological data into a social-theoretical Procrustian bed and using the mangled results to render a verdict on "historical Israel" is unsophisticated, to say the least. A good historian would consider all the relevant archaeological data, all of the data considered significant that may be garnered from the written material, and include insights from social theory into his/her explanatory narrative. Davies's reconstruction of the Jerusalem-Yahud community in the Persian period is pure fiction, demonstrating many of the faults attacked by him in the opening chapters of the book and the misuse of social anthropological models. All that follows is circular reasoning driven by the logical necessity of explaining the origins of the Tanakh. Realizing that his proposed hypothesis is vulnerable if linguistic criteria can date parts of the Bible to the pre-Persian period, he argues that the range of typological diversity attested in various biblical books is due to the conscious manipulation of language in order to create a versimilitude of antiquity. He would have us believe that the linguistic diversity attested for the various texts was created by people whio were not native speakers of Hebrew. His handling of the philological data is simply ill informed. I do not recommend this book to anybody, and certainly not to students. The new case for dating much of the Bible to the post-exilic period will have</page><page sequence="4">156 BOOK REVIEWS to be made by somebody else or by Davies in another book. This volume may, however, be of interest to a student of biblical interpretation as a polemic over unclarified theological issues against unnamed historians and clerics in Europe and America (see pp. 19, 46, 161).
