<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rachel Simon. Change Within Tradition Among Jewish Women in Libya. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1992. vii, 221 pp. Studies of the Jews of North Africa, like other areas of research, have been slow in placing the theme of women on their research agenda. The present work is the first English-language monograph to pay sustained attention to the topic. Somewhat ironically, it relates to Libya, the country of the Maghrib which had the smallest Jewish population, and concerning which there exists the least documentation. The strength of the book lies in its bringing together of almost all the available written sources relating to the topic. Among the sources are archives in Europe-notably those of the Alliance Isra6lite Universelle (AIU)-and Israel, and the writings of travelers to the region, mostly Jews. One important document is a book written by a local Jew, Mordecai Ha-Cohen (1856-1926/29?), and this is complemented by many briefer contributions by Libyan Jews written after the mass migration to Israel in 1949-51. Another important source for the decade before emigration is made up of the letters and reports of the soldiers of the Jewish Brigade, which entered Libya with the Eighth Army. Simon also consulted two unpublished manuscripts in the Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People. There are still a few known manuscripts in the hands of Libyan Jews in Israel, and perhaps in Italy as well, which ought to reach publicly available collections someday. These sources-more than one might have guessed in advance but still less than hoped for-share the same drawback. They</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 475 mostly contain information on women, but rarely present us with women's perspectives. The letters of Miss Tully, sister of the British consul in Tripoli in the late eighteenth century, constitute an exception to these generalizations that is well known to students of Libya. Both female (her first name is unrecorded) and Christian, Miss Tully writes in her letters, among other things, about Jewish women linked to the pasha's harem and court who played a role in representing Jewish interests to the ruler. This is the proverbial exception, however, for there appears nothing comparable to Tully and the Jewish women she mentions in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which are the main focus of the present work. The data available are presented in the framework of five chapters: "Status within the Family and the Community," "Family Life," "Work," "Educational Opportunities," and "Participation in Public Life." The first focuses on the status of women, clearly marked off from that of men, in traditional Libyan society. It also introduces the main theme of the book-that despite various changes in women's dress, education, and work outside the home, the overall orientation of the society with regard to gender distinctions did not undergo significant revaluation. Most of the second chapter revolves around the axis of marriage; for example, marriage age, courtship, brideprice and dowry, the wedding and related ceremonies. The predominance of the data related to these topics itself speaks for the major meaning of women and womanhood in the sources available. In general, one wishes that the author would have commented on the nature of the different materials with which she worked. In the final subsection of the second chapter, "Male-Female Relations Between Jews and Non-Jews," an incident from 1875/76? is cited from the work of Ha-Cohen in which Ottoman naval cadets made immodest remarks to a Jewish maid at the gate of the orchard of the American consul in Tripoli. An ensuing complaint resulted in diplomatic tension between the Americans and the Ottomans. We read in a footnote that American sources describe the tension but do not see it as growing out of an insult to a Jewish maid, and are left to fend for ourselves in making sense of this discrepancy in information. The data in the chapters on work and education allow the most systematic account of changes in the lives of women. In addition to their domestic routines, some women earned income from sewing, doing the work at home. In the late nineteenth century, Tripoli experienced various economic crises which may have been the occasion for women beginning to work outside the</page><page sequence="3">476 BOOK REVIEWS home on a sustained basis. The cleaning and dying of ostrich feathers, as part of the commercial process linking central Africa to European fashions, was an example of this development. When the AIU set up a school for girls in 1896, it provided training in Western-style sewing, cutting, knitting, embroidery, and ironing. This introduced new skills but still remained within the confines of conventional notions of women's work. It was not until the 1930s that there is some hint of a conceptual shift concerning women's cultural and social "place." This occurred in the context of the teaching of modem Hebrew in the Ben-Yehudah society, which was set up by young men from the traditional Jewish quarter who had received an Italian high school education and found themselves attracted to Zionism. While the number of Jewish girls receiving some education had been increasing since the late nineteenth century, the Ben-Yehudah effort represented the first time women were publicly encouraged to study any sort of Hebrew. The autodidactic initiators of Ben-Yehudah taught female instructors, who in turn were charged with teaching girl pupils. This trend, which, like all education, came to a halt during World War II, resumed with the meeting between the Libyan Jewish communities and the Palestinian soldiers, who expressly sought to contribute to the reconstitution of Jewish life and the cultivation of Zionist orientations. It represents an interesting conjunction of Zionism and "modernization"-with special reference to women-in Middle Eastern countries, worthy of being examined on a comparative basis. The overall developments are presented within a taken-for-granted mod- ernization perspective, to which are added various details on how Jews in Libya sought to hold on to their traditions and not lose their uniqueness. One line of analysis focuses on the role models which, among the variety available, Jews chose to imitate. Another reader of the sources might have more strongly highlighted the clash of voices: the local women who mocked European women reading prayers from books in the synagogue (p. 110), or the local reactions to the impressions of AIU staff that pupils were "half savage" and "not very intelligent" (pp. 122-123). Another option is to show how individuals manipulated the options available to them, as in the case of the private qiddushin of a high-school-age girl to a considerably older man, followed by efforts of her parents to have the marriage annulled under Italian law (pp. 65-66). The girl's husband and parents were all highly Italianized, and both sides utilized every means possible, whether "traditional" or "modern," to advance their cases. What does it mean that a "genuine youth</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 477 movement emerged" from the activities of Ben-Yehudah in 1943, when we later learn that the Palestinian Jewish emissaries working with the movement "complained that most of the men cane to the Ben-Yehudah club to meet girls, buy sweets and liquor, smoke and play billiards" (p. 174)? Rather than placing data into the context of homogenized notions of modernization, the specificity of diverging cultural voices might be given greater emphasis. Differences in possibilities of interpretation notwithstanding, the book, thoroughly researched and clearly written, is a groundbreaking effort. If we can learn as much as Simon teaches us about Jewish women in Libya, then surely the same should be possible for other Middle Eastern communities. The study represents a significant contribution and a challenge to further work. Harvey E. Goldberg Hebrew University Jerusalem, Israel</page></plain_text>
