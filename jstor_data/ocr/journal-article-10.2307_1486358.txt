Notre Dame, Ind.: University of Notre Dame Press, 1979, x. 245 pp. The Canonization of the Synagogue Service is an important contribution to the study of the history of Jewish liturgy. Based upon Hoffman's doctoral dissertation,' this work sheds considerable light on the process of liturgical canonization during the geonic period, and provides the reader with a con- ceptual framework with which to better understand the positions taken by the geonim in a number of controversies relating to the liturgy. This is a well-written and well-organized book. Hoffman's basic assumptions, his methodological approach, and his thesis are clearly stated. His analysis of the supporting evidence is thorough, and attention is given to cases which do not appear to fit well into his schema. The book is well- 1. Lawrence A.

Hoffman has carefully analyzed many geonic responsa relating to the liturgy, and his presentation provides one with great insight into the development of specific prayer customs and texts. His real contribution, however, lies in his synthesis of the material at hand and in the development of his thesis that the canonization process during the geonic period can be divided into three distinct periods, and that the history of this process reflects the fortunes and concerns of the gaonate as an institution during this time. According to Hoffman, the first period, extending from the gaonate of Yehudai until that of Amram, was marked by the struggle of the geonim to establish themselves as the authorities on matters of Jewish practice, not only over the Jews of Babylonia, but over those of Palestine and the Western diaspora as well (p. 163). While these efforts were not successful, the geonim did succeed in demarcating certain rules, prayers, and practices which comprised a Babylonian rite (p. 9). Those who followed other practices were condemned in the strongest possible terms. The second period, represented by Saadiah Gaon, was marked by an entirely new approach to liturgical issues.2 The Palestinian-Babylonian rivalry was no longer a central problem in Jewish life. Saadiah had lived for a time in Palestine, and he felt free to accept many Palestinian customs (p. 164). The rulings included in his Siddur and in his responsa dealing with liturgical issues reflect two primary concerns: the Karaite challenge to rabbinic authority, and his desire to demonstrate "the rationality, the logic, and the general propriety of rabbinic liturgy" (p. 9). Yet these two concerns were really one, for Hoffman suggests that Saadiah's concern for the "rationality" of the prayers and his preference for formulations that have a biblical basis were both related to his polemic against the Karaites (pp. 166-167). The third period, represented by Sherira and Hai, differs from the first in 2.

Hoffman suggests that the tolerance of these geonim may be attributed to the institutional weakness of the gaonate at that time.3 Sherira and Hai sought to rebuild the prestige of the academy of Pumbedita, and to regain the support and loyalty of the diaspora communities. This could not be accomplished by fiat, or by harsh condemnation of local custom (p. 168). Hoffman does note that there were exceptions to this tolerance of variant practices, and suggests possible explanations for most of them. For the most part, they appear to reflect Hai's struggle against Karaism (p. 169). Hoffman devotes one chapter to "miscellaneous debates and liturgical alternatives," in which he discusses geonic responsa on liturgical issues that do not otherwise meet the criteria for inclusion in the book (pp. 150-159). According to Hoffman, the process of canonization entails the adoption of one particular reading as authoritative, and conversely, the rejection of alternative or variant texts. For this reason, Hoffman utilized only those geonic sources which discuss the use of such variants (p. 150). There are, however, responsa on liturgical issues in which the gaon cites a particular formula but makes no mention of existing variants, or in which the gaon's decision seems to be unrelated to the motivational factors which underlie the decisions analyzed in the preceding chapters of the book. They are held to be irrevelant to Hoffman's basic thesis, and are included only for the sake of completeness, and because he recognized that his judgment of their "neutrality" might be disputed by others (p. 151). This chapter is the weakest one in the book, for of the five cases that were chosen for inclusion, two do not even involve geonic decisions, while a third is not really "neutral." The first "controversy" cited in this chapter concerns the exact wording of the asher yazar blessing in the Birkhot ha-Shahar. There was, in fact, no geonic controversy over the correct word- ing of this blessing;4 it did not become an issue until the postgeonic period (pp. 151-152). Hoffman's inclusion of it in this study is therefore difficult to understand. The same is true of Hoffman's discussion of alternative versions of the 3. For a discussion of the erosion of geonic authority during this period, see Simba Asaf and Jehoshua Brand, s.v. "Gaon," Encyclopaedia Judaica, 7:318. 4. Hoffman admits that the differences in the readings found in the geonic sources under consideration may merely be the result of scribal errors, later textual emendations, or even differences in spelling the same word. The geonim do not appear to have been aware of the existence of variant readings in these cases (pp. 151-152).</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 107 blessings recited prior to the study of the Torah. One alternative is that which concluded lamdeni hukekha. While this blessing is the subject of consi- derable debate among the rishonim, and seems to have been recited already by the merkavah mystics, it is not mentioned in any of the geonic responsa (p. 153). While this may be an indication of geonic rejection of this formula, it may also be an indication of their unfamiliarity with it. The same may be said of the other examples of Torah blessings that are cited (pp. 155-156). The last example of a "neutral" responsum cited by Hoffman is a responsum concerning the correct wording of the Saturday morning Kiddush (p. 158). He maintains that it is neutral because the authorship and date of the responsum are unknown, as is the identity of the group that used the disputed formula. However, this does not make the responsum a neutral one. It is neutral only in the sense that we lack sufficient data to evaluate it properly. Were this information available to us, the responsum would clear- ly be relevant to the discussion at hand. The Canonization of the Synagogue Service is an important work which adds much to our understanding of the process of liturgical canonization during the geonic period. In addition to providing the reader with a frame- work for understanding the issues raised in the geonic responsa relating to liturgical questions, Hoffman provides clear, cogent analyses of many diffi- cult geonic texts. Furthermore, he suggests a number of areas which merit further scholarly investigation.5 Nevertheless, there are a number of weaknesses in Hoffman's analysis which detract somewhat from the otherwise excellent quality of this work. The first problem relates to his basic thesis, that the liturgical responsa of the geonim fall into three periods, each with its own concerns and tenden- cies. He marshals a great deal of evidence in support of this periodization. It is clear that the early period was characterized by strictness and a polemical approach toward what were regarded as deviant practices, and that the later period was marked by much greater tolerance. His explanation of these trends is reasonable. However, despite his claim that Saadiah was a product of his age (p. 165), it seems to me that Hoffman has not adequately sup- ported his contention that Saadiah represents a distinct period in the history of liturgical canonization during the geonic period. Since there was no 5. For example, after noting the Palestinian penchant for including petitions for salvation in many of the prayers, Hoffman suggests that "just on the basis of the limited evidence of this study, the Palestinian desire to insert petitions for salvation presents itself as a worthy subject for further research" (p. 52).</page><page sequence="5">108 BOOK REVIEWS evidence presented that Saadiah's criteria were applied by the geonim immediately preceding or following him, perhaps it would have been better to have spoken of two periods, with Saadiah's approach being regarded as idiosyncratic. A more fundamental problem with Hoffman's work relates to the scope of the study, and to the degree to which Hoffman addresses, or fails to address, important questions relative to the process of liturgical canoniza- tion. The very title of the book, The Canonization of the Synagogue Service, is misleading. It leads one to expect that the work will present a thorough study of the whole process of liturgical canonization, when, in fact, the book is limited to the geonic period. But even were the book to be entitled The Canonization of the Synagogue Service During the Geonic Period, a number of questions would remain. For methodological reasons, Hoffman dealt only with geonic texts that shed light on a gaon's attitude toward the use of alternative liturgical formuli (p. 6). Yet there is a great deal of source material, including much of Seder Ray Amram and Siddur Ray Saadiah, that clearly relates to the process of canonization (for these works were attempts to set forth what were felt to be the proper forms of prayer), but that does not relate directly to the question of the use of variants. A more satisfying title (albeit one that may not be as marketable) is that of Hoffman's disserta- tion: "Liturgical Responses Suppressed by the Geonim in Their Attempt to Fix the Liturgy." Among the goals that Hoffman set for himself in the introduction (p. 6), all were met admirably, with the exception of the last, the determination of the success of the geonic efforts to canonize the liturgy. Hoffman does not even touch upon this problem until the last two pages of the book, where he concludes that "from the evidence of the geonic literature alone, it would seem that no great success was encountered by the geonim. It is fair to say, at least, that where success was attained, it was a result of the will of later communities themselves, not the authoritarian aspect of the gaonate" (p. 170). Yet he also concludes that "the synagogue service was canonized, and in a sense by the geonim, particularly Amram, whose Seder became common currency in Western Europe" (p. 170). In all, his analysis of the failure of geonic efforts during the period of the gaonate, as well as his comments regarding their posthumous success, are very superficial. The analysis which underlies much of the book, i.e., that concern for liturgical canonization was a particularly geonic phenomenon, is open to question, as is his assertion that the liturgy was finally canonized in the post-</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 109 geonic period. Earlier authorities were also concerned with establishing proper liturgical forms and formuli, as is admitted by Hoffman (pp. 3-4). While the geonim were frequently concerned with larger blocks of material (i.e., the wording of entire blessings and series of blessings) than were the tannaim and amoraim (who were primarily concerned with the inclusion or omission of specific words and phrases), it remains to be demonstrated that the efforts of the geonim differed qualitatively from those of their predeces- sors. Neither the talmudic authorities nor the geonim succeeded completely in their efforts to suppress those formuli to which they took exception. Post- talmudic authorities down to our own time have demonstrated a concern for establishing proper liturgical formulae, and liturgical controversies have erupted in every era of Jewish history. Perhaps canonization should be viewed as a process which was never really completed. Hoffman's study, then, must be seen as a fine study of "liturgical responses suppressed by the geonim in their attempt to fix the liturgy." The definitive work on the process of Jewish liturgical canonization, or even the process of liturgical canonization during the geonic period, is yet to be written. Kenneth E.
