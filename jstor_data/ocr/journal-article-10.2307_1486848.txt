<plain_text><page sequence="1">454 BOOK REVIEWS Steven T. Katz. The Holocaust in Historical Context. Vol. 1. The Holocaust and Mass Death Before the Modern Age. New York: Oxford University Press, 1994. 702 pp. The Holocaust has found its philosophical historian, the uniqueness of the Holocaust, its first fully articulated and compelling presentation. Steven T. Katz has written the best work of historical interpretation of the Holocaust in any language; the largest in conception, the most majestic in vision, the most careful and thoughtful in execution; above all, philosophically the best, most rigorously argued. Here is philosophical history in the grand tradition: raising a massive question, answering it with commensurate rigor. Great scholarship matches the immense dimensions of what is studied; profound intellect, the depths of what is examined in the this-worldly context of the history of humanity. This work of surpassing scholarship on the most important question of learning in our time commences Katz's planned three-volume study, with the next parts announced as The Holocaust and Mass Death in the Modern Age and The Uniqueness of the Holocaust. His project addresses the critical question, how are we to understand the event of our century? Katz's answer is stated in the title of the third volume, but the argument begins in the one before us. A brief survey of the contents shows the remarkable scope of the work: "Considering the Holocaust in Historical Context," "On Defining Unique- ness," "On Quantity and Quality," "The Destruction of Cultural Centers," "On Intentionality," "Roman and Classical Slavery," "Medieval Anti-Semitism: The Process of Mythification," "Medieval Anti-Semitism: The Positive Paradox," "The Persecution of Witches," "Witchcraft and Misogynism," "Persecution of Homosexuals," "Persecution of Heretics," and a conclusion. The shape of Katz's argument emerges from this repertoire. He begins with four philosophical chapters on definition and method, the chapters of a general theoretical character. He then, in a sequence of historical chapters, works his way through the matters of slavery, antisemitism, and the persecution of witches, homosexuals, and heretics. The theoretical chapters involve Katz's Auseinandersetzungen with the principal figures in the Holocaust debate; I doubt that any significant idea has been missed by him. But Katz contributes more than a thorough account of the problem. He proposes his own program: "an . . . investigation of the relevant history</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 455 of mass murder and genocide in all its diversity and expansiveness" (p. 11). To do this he has created "a series of analytical case studies of the major events that are relevant to ... the complex process of answering the uniqueness question" (ibid.). For each of his cases, he presents a thorough account, explaining that "for the majority of readers these rich narrative and statistical presentations are essential" (p. 12). The bibliography and consequent historical reliability of the work, amply utilized where relevant, shows that Katz has read very widely; his account of the several historical cases will have to be evaluated by the relevant specialists. For late antiquity, having directed a dissertation on slavery in ancient Judaism, I can say that he has read all of the classical scholarly works my student did and has come to judgments that certainly conform to the best contemporary learning in the Western languages (German, French, English). Given the range of topics on which he has pursued his research, that judgment must suffice; he wins the reader's confidence on every page. But it is the power of Katz's vigorous and penetrating thought that really gains the reader's respect. Katz identifies the important questions and deals with them; locates the potential weak points in his argument and addresses them; does not merely announce propositions but amasses arguments and evidence. Here is what scholarship should offer. The critical issue is addressed at the outset: what can we possibly mean by "uniqueness," and how-absent a complete repertoire of genocide in all of recorded history-should we know that a given national calamity is without parallel? Katz phrases his definition of uniqueness in terms of intentionality; here alone, genocide implies "the actualization of the intent . .. to murder in its totality any national, ethnic, racial, religious . .. group ... as these groups are defined by the perpetrator, by whatever means" (p. 131). This is what separates genocide from other forms of mass murder (p. 134). Katz's main point is, "Employing this definition, we can begin to recognize that Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, Hellenistic, Roman, and Crusade policy was cruel, but not every cruelty is genocide" (p. 135). So too, "not every barbarism is genocide" (ibid.). Being a trained philosopher, Katz proceeds to a negative inquiry: "cultural genocide: what the Holocaust is not" (p. 139); then "what anti-Semitism is not" (p. 146). Lest this brief account make the book appear schematic, rather than the closely argued and carefully researched work that it is, let me cite the kind of argument readers can expect from chapter to chapter and page to page:</page><page sequence="3">456 BOOK REVIEWS Three interlocking questions now require investigation: does the inhumane history of pre-Nazi antisemitism ... include occasions of physical genocide? Or, conversely . . . is the Hitlerian intention to exterminate the entire Jewish people a crime without precedent? Does the delimiting category of physical genocide serve to individuate the Shoah as an historical novum within-and without-the boundaries of Jewish history. The determinative, interdependent answers to each of these three questions is clear: there were no prior instances of physical genocide perpetrated against the Jewish people ... ; Hitler's .. . biocentric design was unprecedented ... the category of physical genocide will serve to individuate the Shoah as an incommensurable moment within the parameters of Jewish history. (pp. 146-147) Here is the kind of philosophically rigorous analysis that characterizes the work throughout. The second principal philosophical question concerns the relationship between "quantities and quality-between the number of victims in a given circumstance and the meaning of any such event" (p. 14). Katz insists that the Shoah is "not individuated" by reference to quantities. Nor does he find that the cultural impact separates the Shoah from other such events: ". .. the architectonic and geospiritual implications of the removal of the Polish-Russian umbilicus . . . do not serve to establish the uniqueness of the Holocaust" (ibid.). It is, then, the matter of intentionality, to which I made reference earlier, that forms the critical argument. The whole is summarized in an economical sentence: "none of these prior occasions of serious ill treatment and devastation were instances of genocide. None is comparable ... to the Nazi program of extermination" (p. 15). This leads Katz to further studies on the comparison of premodern antisemitism, modern pre-Nazi antisemitism, and Nazi racial antisemitism: "This is an absolutely fundamental interpretive issue" (ibid.). The remainder of the book then presents "closely argued case studies of different major forms of prejudice and persecution in the classical and medieval eras" (ibid.). The first concerns slavery, a "multiform ... institution . .. that ... was mediated by a variety of cultural, normative, and socioeconomic factors such that it was not genocidal; indeed, its composite origins, governing rationale, and utilitarian imperatives contravene the teleology of genocide" (ibid.). Christian anti-Judaism is shown to exhibit conflicting traits: "the church never initiated or condoned a policy of physical Judaeocide" (ibid.). Katz comments, "This profound disjunction must be fully assimilated</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 457 into any adequate . .. reconstruction of the history of antisemitism and must be given sufficient weight in any plausible understanding of how history bears, and does not bear, upon the larger matter of the uniqueness of the Holocaust" (pp. 15-16). Katz's analysis of the murder of tens of thousands of Christian women as witches finds nothing in common between witch hunts and the Holocaust. So too, "almost no homosexuals were murdered. there was never an organized, comprehensive, and deadly campaign against homosexuals anywhere in Christendom" (pp. 16-17). Katz explicitly denies the intent to "deny, minimize, or distort the suffering of... these victim-groups, nor do I seek to promote some unjustified claim to moral precedence for the Jewish victims of Nazism. Rather, my purpose is to make a fundamental methodological observation about how much of the variegated history of persecution is now being rewritten" (p. 19). What of the role of Christianity? Katz's conclusion bears close attention: The meaning of these medieval and early modern events, ranging from medieval antisemitism, the persecution of witches, and antihomosexual legislation to the Crusades against Albigensians, Waldensians, Moriscos, and Huguenots, including the far-reaching expulsion of the Jews from Spain-all reflect a comparable defining Christian context with its inherent stereotypical encodings and substantial, yet limited modes of political behavior. In each case, beyond the localized happenings, there exists an active theological dogmatics, an organized and operative cultural impulse, that translates social practicalities into metaphysical requirements at the same time that it seeks to incarnate doctrinal imperatives in empirical events. As a result, each of these historic encounters is simultaneously perceived as a normative encounter, the resolution of which has substantive theological consequences. .... Yet . . . what may appear to us as paradoxical but what is constitutive of this civilization ... is that the conversion of the nonbeliever and the abjuration of the heretic were the preferred solutions to the evil and danger they represented; and for those entire communities that proved unassimilable . . the ultimate solution was expulsion. ... as Christians, there were limits to their tyranny. They ... could be inhumane and dehumanizing, full of hatred and the locus of unceasing atrocities, but these Christians and this Christian world did not, would not, could not, create Auschwitz. (pp. 577-578) Katz has inaugurated a work not of ideology, but of sustained, detailed research. His cases are carefully investigated, and at each point he shows how the Shoah is to be distinguished from the case at hand; and the distinctions</page><page sequence="5">458 BOOK REVIEWS make a massive difference: thus, for one instance, "The Shoah is to be distinguished from the Crusades and the medieval and early modem wars of religion in that Nazism aimed at the complete physical extermination of the Jewish people, not its conversion, or, as in the case of the Wars of Religion, the return of the dissidents to the religious orthodoxy of their oppressors" (p. 580). Here he has given us his negative argument, telling us what the Shoah is not. A massive first step in an enormous intellectual and scholarly project, Katz's work marks its author as today's most accomplished scholar of the Holocaust as a problem of philosophical and historical interpretation. The true achievement of this work is best measured by comparison to earlier efforts to address the same question. These prior works prove too limited in scope or too general and prematurely ideological, as two among many earlier essays on the same issue suffice to show us. First, in the case of Arno Mayer's Why Did the Heavens Not Darken? (1989), the generative hypothesis is itself altogether too limited in provenience. Second, Richard L. Rubenstein's The Cunning of History (1975) and The Age of Triage (1983) suffer by contrast as impressionistic and not richly instantiated. Compared to Katz's magnum opus, the former appears trivial, the latter insufficient. And it goes without saying, a long list of other candidates scarcely justifies review. No prior effort to situate the Holocaust in the framework of secular history has exhibited equivalent intellectual ambition, and none that follows can fail to be measured by the rigorously argued philosophical standard that Katz has set. Here we have a first-rate mind, asking an enormous question, and answering it with craft and care, perspicacity and deep thought. In Katz's Holocaust analyzed as a philosophical and historical problem, we have a definitive statement, an authentic academic masterpiece.
