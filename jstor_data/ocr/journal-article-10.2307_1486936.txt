<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lenn E. Goodman. God ofAbraham. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996. xvii, 364 pp. Eight chapters comprise Lenn E. Goodman's virtuoso exercise in philo- sophical theology. The first two chapters construct metaphysical underpin- nings for Judaic monotheism, lingering over the ontological proof for God's existence made medievally famous by Avicenna and St. Anselm and recently challenged by Hume, Kant, and A. J. Ayer. The third chapter establishes a systematic link between monotheism and ethics, wrestling with Kant and repudiating the principles of cultural and moral relativity. The fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters elaborate the nomocentric claims made in the third.</page><page sequence="2">338 BOOK REVIEWS With some help from Mary Douglas, the British cultural anthropologist, these chapters recapitulate the emphatically utilitarian and anthropocentric rationale for the commandments developed by Saadiah and Maimonides. Chapter 7, for example, defends the biblical laws regulating diet and sex by stressing their anti-orgiastic, anti-violence, and pro-ethicizing tendencies. "Time, Creation, and the Mirror of Narcissus," the eighth chapter, reverts to metaphysics. It weaves contemporary biology and cosmology into an extended discussion of Henri Bergson and Charles Hartshorne, seeking to render plausible the venerable notion of temporal creatio ex nihilo by associating it with more recent speculations regarding a "Big Bang" origin for the universe. This final chapter closes with a subtle rejection of any attempt to harmonize science and religion which presupposes that mere human intelligence accounts for the intelligible structure of the universe. Goodman prefers Plotinus to the ancient physicist Aristotle and the modem physicist Freeman Dyson, because Plotinus, architect of a perennially fascinating Neoplatonism, knew better than to believe that "mind is ... the very best of things" (p. 275, cf. p. 16). Goodman himself, however, is neither a theosophically minded nor a theurgically inclined Neoplatonist who subordinates morality and rational deliberation to ecstatic or mystical union with the One. Defying Rudolf Otto and all the other Romantics who disallow the bourgeois reduction of holiness to ethical virtue, Goodman indefatigably equates perfection with sacrality and moral goodness, both human and divine. "Human holiness," Goodman typically teaches, "begins with human nature; and the call to emulate God's holiness, then, contains no paradox, so long as we recall that what we seek is our [moral] perfection, not God's" (p. 88). According to Goodman, "the founding axiom of the Mosaic law is the reality of Perfection"; absolute perfection is synonymous with God; and perfection itself means "the striving toward [absolute moral] goodness in all aspiring beings" (p. 112). The theoretical burden of Goodman's God of Abraham "is to awaken our consciousness to the indissoluble linkage of goodness to the idea of God" (p. 27). The historical affiliation of Goodman's project is staunchly and oddly Hegelian in a postmodern age that denies linear moral progress in society and conceptual absolutes in philosophy. Goodman is drawn to those philosophers "who illustrate phases in the resolution of the idea of God"; he seeks membership and invites others to join him in the "community of discourse" comprised by the "philosophers who have labored toward [ethically responsible] refinement of the idea of divinity" (p. 34). As for his commitment to rational deliberation, it reverberates throughout</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 339 the book. It surfaces in a meticulously argumentative rhetoric and a constant admiration for Saadiah and Maimonides. It surfaces most dramatically in the exhaustive, lively, and persuasive polemic against Marvin Fox's critique of Saadiah's "idea of rational commandments" (pp. 175-184). Summing up his notion of reason's rightful place in religious life, Goodman suggests that it is a handmaiden, "an ally or a tool." Consequently, reason is neither the equal of religion nor its enemy. In another passage comparing Judaic with Greek culture, Goodman claims that "the Torah ... is ... capable of synthesis with the best the Greeks [e.g., Plato, Aristotle, and Plotinus] can offer" (p. 123, cf. p. 140). As if he were Saadiah's late-twentieth-century avatar, Goodman can forge an alliance between rationality and biblical law only because he limits rationality to pragmatic utilitarianism: "To understand the Torah we must see that here divine authority connotes what modems mean by rationality: that the laws serve effectively in pursuit of sound goals" (p. 228). Goodman has therefore written a systematic philosophy of liberal, rab- binically observant Judaism. By philosophy he means a cultural system that is intellectually plausible, conversant with science, engaged with the tradition of "footnotes" to Plato, buttressed with logical arguments, and--most of all--conducive to morality. By Judaism he means the Mosaic or pentateuchal "Foundation," the "Prophetic Recension," and "The Work of the Rabbis," in all of which the divinely sanctioned ideals of human individuality and dignity are refined and progressively institutionalized in communal structures, rituals, and laws (pp. 117-140). Goodman does not say so explicitly, but it is apparent from his constant admiration for Saadiah and Maimonides that he considers them the legitimate heirs to normative biblical authors and talmudic sages. Goodman's passing reference to the liturgy of Kabbalat Shabbat as "a way of reconciling God with his exiled Shekhinah, assuring them a conjugal visit on the Sabbath" (p. 199), suggests that he is familiar with Jewish mysticism, but nowhere in his systematic theology does he integrate either the Kabbalah or Hasidism in his rendition of Jewish belief and practice. For some readers, the exclusion will be a welcome relief from the current fashion in religious apologetics; for others, it will be an egregious oversight, a fatal flaw in his project. Readers who prefer Judah Halevi's God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and therefore disdain the purely conceptual God of the philosophers, may be scandalized by the title, if not the content, of Goodman's theology. Other readers might wonder why Goodman does not debate the issues with such modems as Hermann Cohen, Martin Buber, or Emmanuel Levinas, whose preoccupation with Jewish ethics equaled his own.</page><page sequence="4">340 BOOK REVIEWS The eight chapters of Goodman's remarkably erudite and closely argued treatise are well served by the congenial preface, the forty-one pages of accurate bibliographic references and notes, the carefully edited bibliography, the comprehensive general index, and the wide-ranging index of citations. To read them all is to be charmed and stimulated by an ethically inspired defender of the faith, a latter-day moderate Maimonidean, and an avid disciple of Saadiah. Kalman P.
