Bloomington &amp; Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 2001. x, 180 pp. The complex and intriguing figure of Moses Hess (1812-1875) has received attention as a socialist and a Zionist. His Rome and Jerusalem (1862) has been seen 343</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews as a brilliant, if stylistically flawed, document that gives remarkably early evidence of the racial basis of antisemitism and striking testimony of a socialist intellectu- al's return to his Jewish roots. Despite the relatively large literature on Hess, no one had heretofore read Hess with a predominant interest in his fractured religious identity. This is the task that Ken Koltun-Fromm has set for himself in this highly novel, closely argued, and challenging work. Not only does the author look at aspects of Hess that have remained largely unexplored, but he does so with tools not hitherto applied to the subject. Koltun- Fromm draws (critically) upon conceptions developed by contemporary theoreti- cians, especially the moral philosopher Charles Taylor, that enable him to dig beneath the surface of Hess's writing to reveal unresolved tensions which earlier writers on Hess had not discovered. Koltun-Fromm's Hess emerges from this read- ing as paradigmatic for the modern Jew, who likewise seems unable to integrate fully the divergent strands of Jewish identity. Hess deserves renewed attention be- cause his confusions and conflicts, Koltun-Fromm argues, are characteristic for the Jewish condition in modernity. A passage from Rome and Jerusalem, cited three times, provides Koltun- Fromm with the key for his strong reading of the text. In reference to sacrificial worship in Judaism, Hess writes: "The scar on the face of my beloved not only does not detract from my love, it is just as precious to me-who knows, perhaps even more precious?-than her beautiful eyes, which one can also find in other beauti- ful women, whereas just this scar is characteristic of the individuality of my beloved." In Koltun-Fromm's interpretation, this passage reveals more clearly than any other Hess's "ambivalence" toward his Jewish heritage in which sacrificial worship has not only to be acknowledged but also affirmed, while at the same time he could neither fully justify it morally nor envisage it in the messianic future of a restored Zion. Koltun-Fromm examines Hess's relationship to his Jewishness in his earlier works, but the three central chapters of this revised dissertation focus on the piv- otal Rome and Jerusalem. Drawing upon Taylor, he sees Hess embarked upon a "narrative quest," which seeks to integrate experience, but it is a quest at which Hess ultimately fails, leaving his identity fragmented and torn. Yet Hess does cre- ate a "necessary framework" for continuity, which lies in his understanding of Jew- ish identity as essentially racial, or national, in character. Given the contradiction between Hess's relationship to Judaism in real life (non-practicing, married to a French Catholic woman) and his call for Jewish observance-which contempo- raries termed hypocrisy-it is not surprising that the Jewish race, to which all Jews belong regardless of belief or practice, should serve as the basis for Jewish conti- nuity and unity. Once again with the aid of a Taylor concept, Hess is also portrayed as a "strong evaluator": his assessment of Judaism places it objectively above com- peting cultures and religions. He is also willing to polemicize strongly against both Reform Judaism and Jewish Neo-Orthodoxy, as represented by two unrelated rab- bis named Hirsch: the radical Samuel Hirsch, whom Hess accuses of extinguish- ing Judaism through "fusion" and the traditionalist Samson Raphael Hirsch, who is guilty of rigidity. 344</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Koltun-Fromm's analysis forced me to reread Rome and Jerusalem with his framework of understanding in mind. Would my own newly informed rereading support his interpretation? My conclusion: yes and no. To be sure, there are cracks here: Hess's misreading of his idol Spinoza, his seeming inability to deal absolutely with the issue of animal sacrifice, the tensions within his narrative quest. But I must admit that the overall impression was less that of inner fragmentation-de- spite the fragmentation of the book itself-than of polemics and apologetics. Hess has discovered-or rediscovered-that antisemitism, rooted in race, strikes the cultured Jew no less than the uncultured, that the Jewish Kultus (a difficult term that Koltun-Fromm renders as "tradition," but which embraces contemporary Jew- ish life as well as legacy) is superior to any other, and that the answer to anti- semitism is a Jewish state. There is no ambivalence or ambiguity with regard to these central ideas. They are advocated with a whole heart. To be sure, Rome and Jerusalem, cast in the form of letters to Josephine Hirsch, is also a highly person- al work, with references to self and family, but identity is not the principal issue, at least not explicitly. Koltun-Fromm's argument rests on what he digs out from be- neath the surface. As I read Koltun-Fromm and then Hess, my conviction grew that Koltun- Fromm's paradigm of the ambivalent modern Jew better fits Hess's friend Hein- rich Heine than it does himself. Heine (whom Koltun-Fromm discusses briefly) had amazingly much in common with Hess: both were married to gentiles, both lived in French exile from Germany, both suffered extended illness during the last years of their lives, both were drawn to Utopian socialism, both were influenced by the Damascus Affair, and both "returned" to Judaism. But unlike Heine, who remained deeply ambivalent about Judaism even in the late poems of his Ro- manzero, Hess of Rome and Jerusalem is a proud defender of the Jewish race and its Nationalkultus, with none of the ironic, even mildly self-hating passages that mark Heine's work. I find Hess's ambivalence much more directed toward Euro- pean culture than toward Judaism. On the one hand it has, especially in Germany (Hess is remarkably uncritical of France), produced racial hatred. On the other, he notes that tolerance has become a widespread article of faith and marks his own age as nothing less than messianic. It is of the nature of a sharply focused lens that it enables us to see what a broadly focused one will miss. But it is also true that it leaves out of clear view what lies outside the focus. Hess's writing has lent itself to multiple foci, each of which is legitimate and helpful in creating a fuller understanding of the man and his work. Koltun-Fromm's new and highly interesting focus has revealed neglect- ed aspects that make Hess freshly relevant for contemporary Jews. His work, there- fore, deserves our attention. Michael A.
