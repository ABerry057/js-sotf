<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jay Howard Geller. Jews in Post-Holocaust Germany, 1945-1953. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005. 330 pp. Over the past decade, we have seen a substantial number of books written on the entirely unlikely reemergence of Jewish life in both German states and the relationship of the Jewish communities to their German environment. Among the major contributions are those by Michael Brenner, Erica Burgauer (not Burgbauer, as in this book), Ulrike Offenberg, Micha Brumlik, Jael Geis, Jeffrey Herf, Juliane Wetzel and Angelika K6nigseder, Frank Stem, this reviewer, as well as a handful of others. Jay Geller's study, therefore, could not explore new terrain, but it does present us with a wide overview of the early period and a material-rich, diligently researched presentation of the postwar period. As such, it is clearly a new basic reference work for this early period of German-Jewish life. Geller focuses on the first years under Allied and Soviet occupation and the relationship of the Jewish community representatives to the military powers. He then shows us the radical cultural division between prewar German Jews who emerged from hiding, from the camps, or from abroad and the eastern European Jews who were stranded on German soil or in displaced persons' camps of the Allied forces. The study devotes a fair amount of space to portraying the highly ambivalent and slowly deteriorating situation of the small Jewish community in East Germany all the way to the Slansky period and the flight of the Jewish 210</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews leadership from East Germany. In relation to the West, Geller lays out the spectrum of German parties and politicians, from the judeophile Theodor Heuss, the first president of Germany, to a variety of figures who had not learned much since the fall of Nazism. Finally, the book describes in great detail the reparations process and the role of the Jewish community in Germany in this process. Geller is at his best and most original when he dwells on the character and role of a number of key players, especially his warm portrayal of Heuss, an excep- tional figure among his largely nationalist and often anti-Jewish fellow liberal party members, and his portrayal of the Social Democrat Schumacher, without whom, although in opposition to Adenauer, the reparations would probably never have come to pass. Among the Jewish figures, he provides much fresh detail on Julius Meyer, the key Jewish figure in the East, and on Karl Marx, the editor of the Allgemeine Wochenzeitung der Juden in Deutschland, in the West. Julius Meyer combined a strongly religious position with strong loyalty to the communist government; at the same time, he also stubbornly fought for improved conditions for the Jews living in the German Democratic Republic. What is missing from the story is the miserable treatment Meyer received in the West- most notably by Heinz Galinski, the Jewish leader in West Berlin-which even- tually forced Meyer to emigrate to South America. Karl Marx, the Western news- paper editor and ideal-typical court Jew, on the other hand, cultivated good relations with the powerful in the Bonn government and spun intrigues against fellow Jewish leaders to block their access to Heuss and other German politicians. Much of his ambitiousness and scheming we knew or surmised, but Geller brings this out in rich new detail. Unfortunately, the major postwar Jewish political figure, Norbert Wollheim, is not recognized as such in this study. Partly, this might have to do with the strong attention Geller pays to developments in the American occupied zone and the relative neglect of the situation in British- occupied northern Germany, the area in which Wollheim was more visibly active. Jews in Post-Holocaust Germany is advertised as the "story of the re- emergence of the Jewish community in Germany after the near total destruction of the Holocaust." In fact, however, it is very little of that. Instead, it is the story of the reemergence of Jewish organized life in Germany and Jewish and German political leaders. We learn nothing about Jewish life in Germany at the time or about Jewish religious and cultural activities, and women, moreover, are entirely absent from the study. Because Geller fails to look at the broader Jewish community, including the many Jews who remained unaffiliated with Jewish organizations, certain more complex aspects of Jewish life at the time disappear from his screen. For example, Geller writes about the disinterest or even hostility of the East German communists and the VVN (the communist- dominated Association of the Persecuted of Nazism) in relation to matters of Jewish culture and religion. What appears to be anti-Semitism, however, cannot be fully understood without the hostility of many communists of Jewish origin, such as Albert Norden or Alexander Abusch, to anything having to do with Jewish matters. These Jews certainly were not part of any Jewish community. Their or their families' return from anti-Fascism to a Jewish identity emerged only much later, after 1989 for the most. 211</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Similarly, we learn nothing about Jewish writers, artists, and intellectuals in postwar Germany, East or West, nor a more sociological understanding of the early and later Jewish leadership. We also do not learn anything about the ordinary daily life and contacts between Eastern and old German Jews. To speak of "warm relations between German Jews and eastern Jewish displaced persons" (197) is certainly puzzling. The fact that the German Jew Norbert Wollheim and Polish Jew Josef Rosensaft were close collaborators and friends in the British zone cer- tainly cannot be generalized to the rest of the fractured Jewish world in (northern) Germany at the time, a division that continues until this day. The other deficit of the study is that it neglects the public debates at the time about matters of Nazism and the Jews. For example, what kind of Jewish image did Karl Marx try to construct in his newspaper? How did Jewish writers who returned deal with the postwar situation? Adorno and Horkheimer, for example, or Wolfgang Hildesheimer, Hilde Domin in the West, and Anna Seghers or Arnold Zweig in the East? And what about the other, the German side? Marion D6nhoff's anti-Israeli diatribes in the weekly Die Zeit for example, or Karl Jaspers's conversation with Hannah Arendt? There is still a great deal that is awaiting to be studied, and Geller's diligence and research skills would be the perfect preconditions for that important project. Y.
