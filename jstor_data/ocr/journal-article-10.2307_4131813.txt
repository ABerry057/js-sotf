Levine Michael Sokoloff, A Dictionary of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic of the Byzantine Period. Second Edition. Ramat Gan, Israel: Bar Ilan University Press; Baltimore and London: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002. 847 pp. (1st ed. by Bar Ilan University Press, 1990) Michael Sokoloff, A Dictionary of Jewish Babylonian Aramaic of the Talmudic and Geonic Periods. Ramat Gan, Israel: Bar Ilan University Press; Baltimore and London: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002. 1582 pp. The two dictionaries under review represent the product of decades of as- siduous research and persistent effort on the part of Professor Michael Sokoloff of Bar Ilan University. Previoiusly, he has contributed major works in the Aramaic field in collaboration with other scholars. There is, first of all, A Corpus of Chris- tian Palestinian Aramaic (Gr6ningen: Styx Publications, 1997), a multivolume edition of texts prepared in collaboration with Christa Miuller-Kessler. This was followed by a Hebrew work, 'own - nia m' [Jewish Palestinian Aramaic Poetry from Late Antiquity] (Jerusalem: Israel Academy of the Sciences and Humanities, 1999), prepared in collaboration with Joseph Yahalom. However, the dictionaries reviewed here, which represent his most ambitious projects, bear his name alone, with only technical and electronic assistance in their actual preparation provided on the part of others. Sokoloff has also published A Dictionary of Judean Arama- ic (Ramat Gan: Bar Ilan University, 2003), covering sources from 150 BCE to 200 CE, which includes the rich material preserved in the Aramaic papyri from the Judean Desert. The immense scope of Michael Sokoloff's scholarly productivity, most clearly exemplified in the publication of the two dictionaries, strains the limits of comprehension. All students of the Judaic heritage owe him a special debt for fa- cilitating the mastery of talmudic and related texts, Palestinian and Babylonian. All Semitists, of whatever area of interest, are indebted to him for affording them better access to the rich treasures ofAramaic. The present dictionaries are affiliat- ed with the Comprehensive Aramaic Dictionary Project, whose editor is Professor Stephen Kaufman, a noted Aramaist on the faculty of Hebrew Union College. In the Preface to the second edition of the Dictionary of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic 131</page><page sequence="2">Baruch A. Levine of the Byzantine Period (DJPA) Sokoloff lists reviews of the first edition of that volume, published in 1990, including the penetrating piece by Stephen Kaufman.1 Another brief, largely descriptive review of DJPA by Siam Bhayro has just ap- peared.2 Sokoloff's two dictionaries are part and parcel of the current surge of new compendia, a development driven by computer technology, which now makes it possible to process the vast, requisite data in less than a full lifetime! In this re- gard, Bar Ilan University deserves much credit for its pioneering efforts in com- puterizing archives of Judaica, most notably the responsa literature; and these tech- nical facilities were of great help to Sokoloff, as well. It is also important to recognize that behind Michael Sokoloff stand generations of scholars who pored over manuscripts, discovered buried epigraphy and edited their finds, and ad- vanced our understanding of linguistic phenomena. Their efforts enabled Michael Sokoloff to compile dictionaries based on the sound readings preserved in talmu- dic and other manuscripts rather than on the often corrupt readings of the printed editions that had been utilized in previous dictionaries. New discoveries expand- ed the lexicographical corpus beyond its earlier limits, and research in Aramaic di- alectology clarified long-standing problems in Aramaic lexicography. Because both of the dictionaries under review follow the same methodology, are the work of the same scholar, and cover related Aramaic dialects and textual collections, they will be reviewed jointly. THE EXPANDING CORPUS AND DIALECTAL INTEGRITY In his respective introductions, Michael Sokoloff sets forth his purpose and methodology against the background of extant dictionaries, the best of which is Jacob Levy's four-volume dictionary, W6rterbuch iiber die Talmudim und Mid- raschim, first published in 1875, with a second edition published in 1924 and reprinted in 1963. (Levy also contributed a principally targumic dictionary enti- tled Chaldaisches W6rterbuch tiber die Targumim und einer grosser Teil des rab- binischen Schriftthums [2 vols., Leipzig, 1867].) Levy's talmudic dictionary con- tains both Hebrew and Aramaic entries, so that the same root, if common to Hebrew and Aramaic, will be listed twice, once as Hebrew and once as Aramaic. As for the Aramaic entries, themselves: they are undifferentiated by dialect, as be- tween Palestinian and Babylonian. One can be guided only by the textual sources that are cited. Sokoloff often refers to the well-known dictionary by Marcus Jas- trow, A Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi and the Midrashic Literature (New York, 1903). Levy's dictionaries were never translated into English, whereas Jastrow's dictionary was widely used in North America and elsewhere. The basis for inclusion in Levy's talmudic dictionary was textual, namely, the attestation of a lexeme in the literary sources. This is not to say that Levy failed to register linguistic information pertaining to the textual entries. In fact, he did 1. Journal of the American Oriental Society (1994): 239-48. 2. Journal of Biblical Literature 123 (2004): 382-85. 132</page><page sequence="3">Review Essay very well at this, providing suggested cognates in Syriac, Biblical Hebrew, Arabic, and of course listed loanwords from Greek and Persian. It is just that by purpose, and within the limits of critical progress in the mid-nineteenth century, his corpus of reference consisted entirely of the traditional textual sources. Indeed, the virtue of his dictionary is that it is textually complete. The two present dictionaries are language-dialect based. Two dialects of Aramaic have been defined, Jewish Palestinian Aramaic (JPA), and Jewish Baby- lonian Aramaic (JBA), on an ethno-linguistic basis. This is to say that JPA is the Aramaic dialect of the Jews of Palestine during certain periods, which differed in identifiable respects from the Aramaic dialect employed, for example, by Chris- tians of the same periods who were living in the same or nearby areas. Similarly, JBA is the dialect of Aramaic employed by Jews in Mesopotamia during certain periods. We can identify additional dialects, in both Palestine and Mesopotamia, for example, in Samaritan Aramaic, Nabatean Aramaic, Syriac, and Mandaic. Such demarcations are not only real in linguistic terms, but also reflect the reali- ties of group existence in the Near East of late antiquity. Religious and ethnic communities lived closely together, creating a social construct; they were bound by intersecting religious, economic, and historical factors, all of which impacted the distinctiveness of their respective languages to the dialectal level. Further- more, their various canonical literatures exhibited distinctive features. There are, of course, elements that the various dialects have in common, and much can be learned from the overlapping of dialects. There was also interaction among the larger communities themselves, and considerable cultural borrowing. In broader perspective, all communities who spoke and/or wrote Aramaic shared aspects of common culture. Often, dialects formed as a result of political and demographic changes, with sub-groups branching off from the parent community and going their separate ways. Adopting a dialectal approach requires the lexicographer, in this case, the lexicographer of Aramaic, to include in the corpus of sources all written materials emanating from the designated groups, within the specified periods, whatever their status in canonical terms or their genres. Sokoloff carefully lists his sources for both dictionaries, many of which are of recent discovery, being the result of arche- ological excavation and archival research. The provenance of a given noncanoni- cal source, as to whether it is Jewish or not, can usually be established on the ba- sis of reliable criteria. In lexicographical terms, the value of a verb, or term of reference occurring in a noncanonical text for our comprehension of a talmudic verb or term, may be considerable. Henceforth, our perception of talmudic lan- guage will change from what it was, because we can now view a word or phrase in its ethno-linguistic context and often in its quotidian usage. The extra-talmudic sources that Sokoloff cites for Jewish Palestinian Ara- maic are from the Byzantine period in Palestine, which he dates from the third cen- tury CE until the Arab conquest in the seventh century CE. He does not stop at that point, however, but goes on to include sources from the Geonic, post-talmudic pe- riod. Sokoloff has utilized the sixteenth-century Venice manuscript of the Pales- tinian Talmud and other partial manuscripts, and has cited manuscripts of similar 133</page><page sequence="4">Baruch A. Levine authenticity for midrashic and targumic texts. Sokoloff has included all of the Palestinian midrashim of the period, and Palestinian targumic texts, including the Targum Neophyti (TN), which is of recent publication.3 He also cites Geonic halakhic literature, inscriptions (including amulets), ketubot (Jewish marriage contracts), papyri from Egypt, evidence from the Tiber- ian masorah, and even Aramaic liturgical poetry. The dictionary represents, for the first time, an impressive exercise in dialectal completeness, especially in its in- clusion of Geonic literature, which is a rich source of Aramaic. The sources that Sokoloff cites for the Dictionary ofJewish Babylonian Ara- maic of the Talmudic and Geonic Periods (DJBA) are equally authentic. In addi- tion to the Babylonian Talmud, cited from preferred manuscripts of the various tractates, the dictionary includes data provided by the more extensive Geonic lit- erature of Babylonia, which is of several genres: responsa, legal compendia, for- mularies and documents, historical and lexical texts, and liturgy. Sokoloff also counted among his sources the exegetical writings ofAnan ben David (ca. 800 CE), the founder of a precursor of the Karaite sect. Also included are some Masoretic texts. Of great significance are the hundreds of Aramaic magical texts, most in- scribed on the insides of bowls (known as "magical bowls"), from Iraq and Iran, dating from the fifth to the eighth centuries CE. There are many more where these came from, yet to be published. Not only Jews utilized such bowls, but also Chris- tians and Mandaeans, using their respective dialects of Aramaic. It is usually pos- sible to identify Jewish provenance, although argument on this issue continues to occupy specialists in the field. The assembling of a dialectal corpus for both JPA and JBA is a great achieve- ment, in itself. Michael Sokoloff's two dictionaries are unprecedented in kind, and introduce a new model of lexicography applicable to two major dialects of ancient- to-early Medieval Aramaic. If it is a proper goal of the humanities in higher edu- cation to assure that every Semitist be knowledgeable in the languages of the Tal- mud, and that every Talmudist qualify as a Semitist, then Michael Sokoloff has made the attainment of these goals possible for more and more scholars. METHODOLOGY AND MEANING Ultimately, a dictionary is only as good as the meanings ("glosses") it pro- vides. A corollary to determining the meaning of a given lexeme is the sequence in which multiple meanings are listed. Sequencing is the usual way of indicating the relative roles of such meanings, lending special importance to the meaning list- ed first. In the case of the present dictionaries, which provide English translations of Aramaic lexemes, determinations of meaning and sequence require not only a thorough knowledge of the Aramaic dialects themselves, but also of the English language and its usage. The lexicographer is, after all, a translator as well, and must find the most felicitous rendering. Great effort is required to resolve the inevitable tension between fidelity to the original language and comprehensibility in the lan- guage of translation. 3. The Neophyti Targum of the Pentateuch, ed. A. Diez-Macho (Madrid-Barcelona, 1968-1978) (corrected from a photograph of the Hebrew University). 134</page><page sequence="5">Review Essay Every lexicographer has an approach to the phenomenon of meaning, itself, even if this approach is not articulated. One who operates with the concept of Grundbedeutung "base meaning" will register different meanings to start with, and will undoubtedly develop a different sequence for listing the meanings than one who has less interest in etymology than in contextual, or functional connotation. In the latter case, sequence might be determined on the basis of the frequency, or distribution of one meaning over another. There are further translation issues: How far can one stretch the semantic field of a given lexeme? How prevalent is polyse- my, and how frequent are homonyms? The advantage of a base-meaning approach is that it can lead to a better sense of the etymology and semantics of the original language, as to how lexemes ex- tend their meanings within a given language. This is especially true of agglutina- tive languages, like the Semitic languages, which are based overall on a relatively small number of roots, whose meanings are modulated, in turn, by morphological and phonetic alternations. One who can trace a given form back to its root, and who knows the patterns of change affecting it, is on the road to discerning mean- ing in all of its diversity. The disadvantage of the etymological approach is that it may not do justice to functional meaning in immediate context, which is what the user of the dictionary is seeking. With acumen, a way can be found to balance these competing interests. Regarding the "lemma," or the given form in the entry, Sokoloff has chosen "the most basic form of the lexeme, e.g. the triradical root of a verb or the absolute state of a noun" (DJPA 6: in DJBA 22-23, "an emphatic form of a noun." [Actu- ally, Sokoloff often lists absolute noun forms in DJBA, as well]). Regarding "gloss," here, the English translation of the lexeme, Sokoloff states: "The English gloss is intended to convey a general meaning for the lexeme, whereas its more specific nuances are detailed in the lexical section" (DJPA 6). In DJBA 23 this is merely reformulated: "The English gloss given at the beginning of the entry is in- tended to give a general idea of the meaning of the lexeme, while more exact nu- ances are given in detail in the semantic section." In other words, Sokoloff is more attuned to etymology in his presentation of the Aramaic lemma, which provides "the most basic form," than he is with respect to the English gloss, where he first lists "a general meaning" or "a general idea of the meaning." As will become evi- dent in the discussion to follow, it is my sense that Sokoloff's policy on meaning can potentially detract from both the precision and the utility of the two dictionar- ies. It might be preferable to list the most basic meaning first. Another factor affecting the determination of meaning is the lexicographer's view of the interrelatedness of the Semitic languages and the significance of cog- nates. A corollary to this is the presumed relationship of dialects and phases with- in Aramaic. Sokoloff conforms to the current trend away from emphasis on "com- mon Semitic" derivations, and he clearly seeks to identify the most applicable usage within the specific dialect covered by each of the present dictionaries. This is as it should be, but if he were to weigh alternative meanings solely within a giv- en dialect, or even within Aramaic as a whole, without reference to the larger lin- guistic environment, such a policy would shut out relevant evidence. Now, So- koloff consistently provides comparative references to other dialects of Aramaic, 135</page><page sequence="6">Baruch A. Levine and selectively does the same for Hebrew, especially the contemporary Middle He- brew. On occasion he cites Akkadian and other cognates, as well. And yet, it is my sense that at times he fails to factor in relevant comparative evidence that would be useful in determining the contextual meaning. Decisions regarding which information should be presented in a given en- try, and which need not be, involve both synchronic and diachronic factors. A dic- tionary, unless it is intended to be an historical dictionary, is synchronic in its thrust. Its primary objective is to explain the words of a language or dialect in use during the designated period. In the process it is often useful, however, to provide data from earlier periods so as to be clear as to how a given meaning developed. In this respect, as well, Sokoloff might have been more inclusive. In evaluating the present dictionaries, so vast in their content, it would be best to take up the issues just discussed by citing specific examples that illustrate them. Here are a few: Format andApparatus Format is all-important in presenting data, because it determines what hits the eye of the reader most directly. As an example, the recent Dictionary of the North- West Semitic Inscriptions, by J. Hoftijzer and K. Jongeling (2 vols. Leiden: E.J.Brill, 1995) is comprehensive in its coverage and masterful in its lexicographical deter- minations. It is a boon to scholarship, reliably directing the researcher to diffuse sources. Yet, its format is so cumbersome that at times it comes close to obscuring the glosses themselves in a mangled thicket of profuse abbreviations, fragmentary citations, and bibliographical data! In this respect, Sokoloff has done an excellent job of standardizing sigla, of using bold-face type and other helpful formatting mechanisms, and of organizing the data comprehensibly. In his introductions, he clearly explains the scope of the lexicographic data he provides in each entry. There is an immense variety of collateral information crammed into small spaces with- out impeding reader comprehension. There is one improvement in format that I would have liked to see: an initial register of all attested meanings, listed according to their occurrence in the sever- al stems. Let's look at a sample entry: DJPA 477: wwp vb. to sanctify, betroth, ded- icate. These glosses are followed by the lexical section, which lists all of the at- tested forms derivative of this verbal root. Only then do we find all of the glosses registered by stems. Somewhat altering Sokoloff's translations in form, though not in substance, I would rearrange the opening section as follows trvj, vb. Pe. (unattested in JPA) Pa. 1. to sanctify, consecrate. 2. to sanctify (=wash) the hands and feet (before a sacred act). 3. to proclaim the new moon as sacred. 4. to betroth a woman. Af. to dedicate. Itpa. 1. to be sanc- tified. 2. to sanctify one's self by washing the hands and feet (before a sa- cred act). 3. to be proclaimed as sacred (said of the new moon). This rearrangement provides an immediate overview of the full role of the verb in JPA. A similar revision of format would apply to the same verb in JBA (DJBA 987- 136</page><page sequence="7">Review Essay 988). The resulting format would resemble the system employed in The Assyrian Dictionary of the University of Chicago, which I have always found helpful when searching for derivative meanings. As the matter stands, one reading an entry in either of the present dictionaries is not immediately informed as to which stems attest each of the given meanings. Translation and Sequence We will examine a sample entry in which accurate translation and proper sequence constitute the primary issues: DJPA 138-139: n1a, vb. to take, lead, move. [Complete list of meanings as given in DJPA: Pa. to lead, guide. Itpe. to be taken. Itpa. 1. to move, travel. 2. to be guided.] Critique: The case for registering "to take" as the first meaning is, presumably, that Aramaic ~ifr translates Hebrew nwp5 in TN, which is a major source for defining us- age of the verb i1r in JPA. This rendering is not consistent, however, because else- where TN renders Hebrew nph by the Aramaic verb mm3, whose primary meaning is, indeed, "to take." An examination of the citations shows that TN consistently em- ploys Aramaic 1ia in the Pe'al and Itpe'el stems in cases where BH nip5 means "to take out, away; to bring" in context, but where BH nrij means "to take hold," it is more appropriately rendered by nui. Contrast the following in TN: (a) Gen 24:7: "YHWH, the God of heaven, who led me out / took me out from (-n ,an*p) the house- hold of my father." TN: -1m %i' 1. Here, as in most of the cited instances, the BH syn- tax is modulated by prepositions, such as In "from," or %x "to." In some instances, motion may be signified by the locative accusative. (b) Gen 43:15: "And the double portion of silver they took (innp/TN: ui.2) in their hand, together with Benjamin" (DJPA 352-353). In this case, BH ntp indeed means "to take in one's hand." Such sensitivity to nuance in TN accords surprisingly well with English usage, where "to take," by itself, more precisely means "to hold, seize, take to one's self." The base-meaning of Aramaic "1"r is "to lead," hence: "to bring forth, lead out, conduct, take out, away" and so forth. The core image is that of shepherding, of tending flocks-an image that is translocated to the human sphere. In fact, Sokoloff lists "to lead" as the first meaning of the Pac"el of JPA 1:2 (= dabbir). He cites a Palestinian Targum fragment on Gen 48:15, with reads (in my translation): TN: [rCmq]u inl pm 'ri i "The God who has been shepherding/tending me from my birth" TN: "who has guided me since my youth." One of Sokoloff's citations for Itpa"al (perhaps Itpe'el), meaning 1 "to move, travel" further illustrates the pastoral matrix of the verb 1-'r. TN on Exod 12:42. presents a brief excursus on the Exodus theme, taking its cue from the ref- erence to large flocks and herds earlier on in the biblical passage (Exod 12:38). Exod 12:41-42 read in part: 137</page><page sequence="8">Baruch A. Levine All of the ranks of YHWH ( nrl nrn~ x) departed from the Land of Egypt. That was for YHWH a night of vigil (n,'rw f) to bring them out from the Land of Egypt. Here is how TN describes the scene: Sokoloff's translation: "This one will move at the head of the sheep, and that one will move at the head of the sheep, and his memar will move between them." Proposed translation: "One will take the lead at the head of (some of) the flocks, and another will take the lead at the head of (some of) the flocks, while his Logos takes the lead between them." The Itpae"al (possibly Itpe'el) -i-3r is assimilated from "i:rn'. [I would opt for the Itpa"al, which would yield an iterative sense that is appropriate in imme- diate context.] A vigilant God, identified as the memar "the Word, Logos" (DJPA 305), leads the flocks from his forward position between them. In JBA, usage of the verb -m-7 is less linked to translations of Scripture, and consequently yields more nuances. One who consults DJBA 312-313 will note that Sokoloff lists for the verb "1-T a meaning to apply (meaning no. 4), which, cit- ing Morris Jastrow, he regards as a calque of MH arm. As realized long ago, an as- pectual change occurred in usage of Hebrew an-. In BH, verbal forms are transi- tive "to lead, drive, conduct" whereas in MH the force is stative/reflexive: "to conduct one's self, to behave." In fact, one could combine Sokoloff's meaning number 2 to act with his meaning number 4 to apply. Thus, the citation from B. cEruvin 45a: u~ KiYn 'Y7x nn i1n; "Go out and see how the people conduct (them- selves)/behave." It is entirely possible, however, that the above analysis has it in reverse! The stative/reflexive meaning "to behave, conduct one's self' in MH may, itself, rep- resent a reflex of Aramaic ana "to behave, conduct one's self," an aspectual change likewise expressed in the noun [x]an-n "custom, practice" (DJPA 317; DJBA 685- 86), most likely original to Aramaic. If so, Aramaic ana (DJPA 342; DJBA 731- 32) may not be denominative ofm-nan, after all. In any event, there is a semantic re- lationship, perhaps even an equivalence between Aramaic "ixi and Hebrew ana, and this, in addition to all else, argues for a first meaning: "to lead, take out" in the Pe- Cal stem. It may be relevant to note that Targum Onkelos regularly renders BH -73 by Aramaic --r. Finally, Aramaic and West-Semitic [x]'i "desert" (DJPA 291; DJBA 642) is, etymologically speaking, the place where flocks are "led, driven"- to graze, as we would gather from Exod 3:1 b: -rininrn inxK xn-r n x rnu , "He drove the flocks into the steppe." On this basis, the Pac"el of "m3 extends the base-mean- ing, yielding the sense: "to guide, direct." In summary, the verb "to take," if not modulated syntactically-for exam- ple "to take out, away"-clashes with proper English usage and also skews the pre- cise import of the translations of BH np' in TN, and other sources. The first gloss 138</page><page sequence="9">Review Essay of Aramaic 11r should be the English verb "to lead," and the translations of all forms of this verb can, and should be formulated so as to reflect this base-mean- ing, which was undoubtedly understood by ancient writers of Aramaic. Polysemy versus Homonymy Very often, the issue in the translating process is one of semantic theory: Polyse- my finds a multiplicity of meanings in a single root, whereas homonymy ac- knowledges the presence of separate roots within a given language with different meanings, which are orthographically identical ("homographs") or phonetically identical ("homophones"), or both. Judgments in this regard are unavoidably sub- jective. It is my sense that Sokoloff does well on polysemy; he doesn't usually strain the semantic range. I have, however, found numerous instances where he may have assumed homonyms unnecessarily, and has, as a result, generated two or more entries where only one was called for. This tendency on his part is undoubt- edly related to his preference for contextual over etymological meanings. The root uaa may serve as an example where polysemy is more likely than homonymy, pace Sokoloff: a) DJBA 729-730: 1# va3.vb. to touch, deal with something. 2# .xa vb. to be afflicted with leprosy. DJBA 747: mra, x~m n.m. a sore. b) DJPA 341: = n.m. plague; va vb. to touch, strike. Critique: There was a widespread belief in Near Eastern antiquity that disease, in- juries to the body, plagues, and other misfortunes resulted from the "touch" or "strike" of a deity. This notion is reflected in the narrative of Jacob's bout with the angel of YHWH, where we read that the angel "touched, struck" (-n van) Jacob's hip socket, with the result that Jacob was incapacitated (Genesis 32:26). Most in- teresting is the fact that the Akkadian verb lapdtu "to touch" also means "to af- flict," with the derived nouns, lipittu and liptu connoting "disease."4 Hebrew and Aramaic Yni would seem to exhibit the same semantic field as Akkadian lapdtu. If so, Sokoloff's JBA 2# ma "to be afflicted" would derive from the same root as 1# vn "to touch." Furthermore, with regard to Sokoloff's 2# =n, it is more likely at- tested only in one stem, contrary to the way it is registered in DJBA, as occurring in two stems. Thus, we have an Itpe'el or Itpa"al participle, inima (assimilated from ,irvna ) "is afflicted," and an Itpe'el or Itpa"cal perfect, ma~K (assimilated from uma~nx) "was afflicted." Actually, Sokoloff notes that the verbal stem in ev- idence is uncertain. The association with leprosy (if that's what it was) is contex- tual, resonating with BH nyri -a3 (Lev 13:2). The same would be true of the JBA noun xyla "sore," which is simply a contextual connotation (DJBA 747). In view of the above analysis, I would subsume Sokoloff's JBA 1 # v and his 2# vm un- der one entry, and would also reject the notion that the latter is denominative of nominal Kxa73 "a sore," which seems forced. This analysis would yield the follow- ing rearrangements: 4. The Assyrian Dictionary of the University of Chicago L: 87, s.v. meaning 1; 199, 201-202, s.v. meaning 2. 139</page><page sequence="10">Baruch A. Levine a) JBA: va vb.

Pe. 1. to touch, 2. to strike; Af. to strike. mn n.m. plague, lit. the "touch" of God. A second case where polysemy is more likely than homonymy is the root '1.. According to Sokoloff, we have the following separate entries in JPA and JBA: a) In JPA (DJPA 412-413): 1. *v vb. to answer, respond. 2. 'av vb. to be late. 3. ,13 vb. to afflict. 4. ~ay vb. to be poor. b) In JBA (DJBA 871-872): 1. aY vb. to respond, answer, 2. ,yi vb. to become poor, 3. '3y vb. to afflict, torture, delay. Critique: We know a great deal about the root ~~y (variants: ;my and ay) from West-Semitic, including Old Aramaic and other Aramaic dialects, Moabite, Phoenician-Punic, BH and Ugaritic. There are two undisputed homonymous roots in the West-Semitic languages: (1) "to address, sing, respond, answer" (in the sim- ple stem and its reflexes) and (2) "to be reduced to poverty, be poor" (in the sim- ple stem and its reflexes); D-stem and its reflexes: "to subjugate (BH 'to rape'), oppress, reduce to poverty, afflict." Both roots are of wide usage, and attest a broad range of meanings. In comparative perspective, there is good reason to conclude that the notions of "poverty" on the one hand and "affliction, subjugation" on the other derive from the same root, and yet Sokoloff separates them in both JPA and JBA. The notion of poverty and deprivation is a stative function of the simple stem and its reflexes, whereas the Pa"el generates an active-transitive aspect, conveying the notion of subjugation, of afflicting, or oppressing others. This mutually exclusive distribu- tion of aspects in the respective stems is complementary, and is normal for the se- mantic range of a single root. The meaning "to be late " (Pe'al) and "to delay, postpone" (Pa"el) is another matter. Sokoloff lists the meaning "to delay" under #3 'i3 in DJBA, together with "to afflict, torture," whereas in DJPA he lists the same meaning as a function of #2 %7v "to be late," attested in the Pecal stem and its reflexes, and separately from #3 '3i "to afflict," attested in the Pa"el. Confusing the registration is a relationship with the MH legal term 'pin m7iy "the postponement of a verdict," or "the delaying of judgment" (Mishnah, cAbot 5:8). Sokoloff apparently disassociated this set of meanings from the noun nax, det. rna time (DJPA 412), where Sokoloff refers to MH n;n "period of time." The fact is that the lexeme nvy, though indeed cognate with Hebrew -nms, is very much at home in Aramaic itself!

A Hebrew term, probably a calque of Nabatean Aramaic, namely, t~ n inalu, is attested in the Tosefta.6 Now, the com- ponent rmY and, as suggested in Judean Desert Studies, III,7 a posited masculine form *IY:, are the very elements encountered in the Aramaic enclitic particle mlp as of now, now (DJPA 266; DJBA 594), feminine nasa (cf. Imperial Aramaic; Bib- lical Aramaic). I was not fully aware of all of these connections until the prepara- tion of this review. I now propose that the JPA/JBA verb 's~ is denominative of niY "time" (mas- culine p1), and that its meaning is: "to exceed the time, to be late;" Pa"el: "to post- pone, delay." On this basis, the MH legal term ,'in T fY, and related verbal forms, would reflect the Aramaic meaning, not vice versa. In any event, the meanings "to be late; to postpone" would be unrelated to the root that means "to be poor; to af- flict, oppress." A more complex case is that of the Aramaic verbal root iar, where several entries come into play: 1) In JPA: a) DJPA 132: nm. linf completion.; vb. -iva. to complete, destroy. b) DJPA 131: rinn adj. perfect, complete; nvrna destruction. 2) In JBA: a) DJBA 290-292: "in vb. to finish, learn, decide; vb 1. Pe. intr. to be finished, completed. Af. to teach. b ) DJBA 289: irnn adj. complete. c) DJBA 289: xnim' nm. one who has learnt. d) DJBA 292: xna, iiuxn nm. tradition, gemara, completion; lbn , ns'xb entirely, completely; xna 11 entirely, completely. Critique: The issue here is whether (a) "to finish, complete" and (b) "to learn, study," Af'el "to teach, train," can be regarded as sharing the same semantic field, in which case they can all be derived from a single root. The other given meanings can be reconciled. Thus, "to destroy, annihilate" is to bring to an end, "to decide" is to conclude, finalize. (As for the meaning "to ripen," it probably expresses a dif- ferent root, 'rl, assuming a conditioned sound shift: lamed &lt;&gt;resh). Can we say, however, that "to learn, study" is "to complete"-a process? Does the Af'el "to teach" mean to bring someone to completion? How are we to account for the JBA term xna "corpus of knowledge/interpretation/tradition," which is the equivalent of Hebraic [x]Mrnn' "corpus of instruction," likewise occurring in JBA (DJBA 1209-10), and even once in JPA (DJPA 583)? The only difference between the two terms is that Hebraic rnnEn, with tau-preformative, means "what has been taught, instruction" whereas Aramaic xam means "what has been learned, knowl- edge." It would be forced to conclude that the term Kina means "the completion," namely, what was added on to the Mishnah, or the oral tradition (pace Ben-Yehu- 6.

Levine dah: 605-806, s.v. nljn),8 because such a meaning would not parallel Hebraic -r1nn, as we would expect it to do. Complicating the problem is the fact that the meaning "to finish, complete" is well attested outside of Aramaic. BH attests the stative meaning "to be at an end"9 and West-Semitic provides only sparse evidence,'0 but Akkadian gamdru" is a frequent verb, realized in many forms, and which shares the semantic range of Aramaic min to a remarkable extent. Aramaic "ina "to finish, complete" is also cog- nate with Arabic kamala "to be complete, entire, finished" (stative); II-form "to perfect, to make complete, to finish".12 It is less clear, however, that Arabicjama- ra "to put away, aside": II-form "to collect together, assemble, to knot, or plait the hair"" is cognate with the Aramaic and/or the Akkadian verb under discussion. In contrast, the notion of "learning, studying," unless it can be connected se- mantically with the notion of "finishing, completing," seems to be restricted to JBA, and to infrequent attestations in Palestinian Hebrew sources of the talmudic period, and as such is listed in the Complete Dictionary ofAncient and Modern He- brew (Hebrew)'4 as a separate entry. Sokoloff lists only two attestations with this meaning in JPA, which are probably JBA forms, after all. The case is very weak for classifying finite, and certain nominal forms of Aramaic ina as denominatives of x-Ia, the corpus of tradition and law, as if to say that they mean "to learn the xma" (pace Levy, 1:343, and with Ben-Yehudah: 805, s.v. inra, c., and note 1, by N.H. Tur-Sinai).15 This derivation would put us back where we started, unsure of what the term mna, itself, means. (There is one clear homonym, namely, the noun tmia [DJPA 123], xmini~ [DJBA 269] live coal, and similar forms in SA.16 Com- pare Akkadian gumaru ember in The Assyrian Dictionary of the University of Chicago G: 133, where reference is made to the Aramaic cognates, and also to Ara- bic jamratun "a live, or burning coal.""7 Also note MH "llnrf "incense placed on coals to fumigate" [Mishnah, Berakot 6:6, etc.].

I confess that I cannot trace the origin of the meaning "to study, learn." It may turn out to be a spinoff of 1 # i~, after all, and not a genuine homonym. Perhaps further investigation will clarify this issue. For now, I would, in the interest of clar- ity, opt for two entries in DJBA, and classify the principal meanings as follows, somewhat differently from Sokoloff: 1# *m.vb. Pe. 1. intr. to be finished, completed. 2. tr. to finish, complete, de- cide. Pa. to destroy, bring to an end. adj. "nm complete. adv. nmb, nxKm entirely; xm "o to completion, entirely. 2# -n= vb. Pe. to be knowledgeable, to study, learn, interpret; derive a law hermeneutically. Af. to teach, to engender an interpretation. Itpe. to be learned. nm. xili a learned person. nm. xiw, xci interpretation, re- ceived tradition, body of interpretation; As a proper noun: the corpus known as the Gemara. CONCLUSION The present review has hardly done justice to the vast scope of the two dic- tionaries produced by Michael Sokoloff. My intention was to convey something of the historic significance of his contribution, which cannot be overestimated. By focusing on several cases in point, I sought to address some basic issues that face the lexicographer of an ancient language, one with a very long history and which embodies numerous dialects and phases. Second to Hebrew, Aramaic is the Se- mitic language most intimately associated with Jewish tradition and culture, and it has been drawn upon extensively in the modern revival of Hebrew as a spoken and written language. In another dimension, the treasures of the Jewish Aramaic dialects represent if not the greatest then surely one of the greatest repositories of written Aramaic in existence, a repository that is rapidly losing its erstwhile eso- teric image thanks to the persistent efforts of Michael Sokoloff.
