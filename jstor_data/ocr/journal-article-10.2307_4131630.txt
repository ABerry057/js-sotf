<plain_text><page sequence="1">Walter P. Zenner. A Global Community.: The Jews from Aleppo, Syria. Detroit, Michigan: Wayne State University Press, 2000. 233 pp. The author of this review was once invited to give a historical lecture at a venerable New York City Jewish institution. The subject of antisemitism figured prominently in the talk. "Why do they hate us so?" wailed one member of the au- dience among the crowd that gathered afterward. "Can you tell me?" As she walked with me to my subway stop, pouring out her despair, I patiently tried to explain to her why perceptions of Jews might have developed as they had. Suddenly a Duane-Reade drugstore appeared in our path. Instantly the woman's manner changed. She whispered in a conspiratorial voice, "Do you see that store? It's owned by Syrian Jews. They're rich. They exploit their employees. They are sharp businessmen. And they're incredibly clannish-they won't marry among anyone but themselves!" "Oh, really?" I replied. "Isn't that terrible." On she went, spouting the alleged qualities of the Syrian Jewish community in terms almost identical to the general anti-Jewish stereotypes I had been speaking about only a half hour before. "By the way," I interrupted her as the appearance of my subway stop forced an end to the conversation, "I'm half Syrian." Her eyes widened with shock. I did not wait to hear her subsequent sputters of apology as I took my leave and descended the steps into the subway. Encounters such as these are all the more reason to cherish the work of the late Walter P Zenner, a distinguished professor of anthropology and Jewish studies at the University at Albany, who made the study of Syrian Jews his life's calling. A Global Community. The Jewsfrom Aleppo, Syria includes a peerless bibliography and eleven chapters covering history, culture, rabbinical traditions, geography, cuisine, music, photographs, and comparative scientific anthropological insights. Musicologist Mark Kligman of Hebrew Union College, an authority on the distinctive Syrian Jewish liturgy and pizmoneem, makes a valuable contribution in one co-authored chapter. The ancient city of Aleppo in northern Syria was at the peak of its impor- tance as a commercial center from the Ottoman Conquest in 1517 to the beginning of the nineteenth century. One of the oldest Jewish communities in the world, it had been enriched by an influx of Spanish exiles and other European Jews in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and Spanish family names and loanwords are part of the community down to the present day. Silk, cotton, and other goods were ex- ported from the Middle East and Aleppo was a main trading center between Iran and Iraq and Europe. Syrian Jews, though handicapped by their status as dhimmis, 357</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews nevertheless played an extensive role in this trade, and developed techniques for setting up family members in foreign lands as a way of advancing the business. Aleppo's prominence came to an end, however, with the Industrial Revolu- tion, which reversed the flow of trade from the Middle East. Now, cheap factory- manufactured textiles and other products from Europe were flooding the market. The opening of the Suez Canal brought caravan trading to an end. The disintegra- tion of the Ottoman Empire, the "Young Turk" revolution, wars, the prospect of en- forced military service for dhimmis, and the economic depression in general built up pressures to emigrate. From their start on the Lower East Side along with other immigrants, the Syrian Jewish and allied communities in America have grown to the point that they may number as many as 50,000 or more. Syrian Jewish insiders refer to themselves as "SY"; Ashkenazim are "Iddshy" and "Iddshiyeh," or "Jay-Dubs" (as in JW for "Jewish"). Thoroughly Americanized (with the possible exception of thousands of newcomers who arrived in the early 1990s) they are flourishing in their United States home bases of Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn; Deal, New Jersey; and Hallan- dale and Turnberry, Florida. Although of late more men and women have been en- tering the professions, mercantile pursuits are still encouraged. The Community (often pronounced by SY's as if it were written with a cap- ital "C") is characterized on the whole by early and opulent weddings, a higher- than-average number of children, and a unique combination of American acculturation coupled with intense piety and conservatism. For example, in an in- stance that Zenner describes, at one point tennis lessons were becoming increas- ingly popular at Syrian Jewish country clubs. Rumors began to surface that some community women were having affairs with their coaches. The rabbis thereupon issued an edict banning the women from taking lessons from male tennis coaches, and that ban has been obeyed. The community is also marked by distinctive family names, which are often based on occupations, physical descriptions, or towns of origin. Zenner initiates readers into some of these. They include a dealer in fragrances (Attar); a dealer in cotton (Kattan); slaughterer (Dabbah); soldier (Jindi or Gindi); blacksmith (Had- dad); greengrocer (Hadary); butcher (Kassab); soapmaker (Sabban); water carri- er (Sakkah); candlemaker (Shamah); and olive dealer (Zetun). Also common are Beyda (white), Tawil (tall), Safdieh (from Safed), Dweck, Esses, Kassin, Labaton, Matalon, Schwecky, Sutton or Setton, and, oddly enough, Ashkenazi. Some of Zenner's most interesting encounters are with alienated intellectu- als who "left" the community to pursue alternate paths. These include the poet and author Jack Marshall, professor of English and literary critic Stanley Sultan, and the actor Dan Hedaya, who spurned his family's import-export business in order to follow his chosen career. In general, however, the community places strong em- phasis on keeping the children close to home. If higher education is pursued, it is preferably done at Brooklyn College, New York University, or other schools near- by. Community rabbis do their best to see to it that course subjects are chosen with care and that those who live in dormitories return to the parental abodes for Sab- baths and holidays. 358</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Central to understanding the Syrian Jews is their communal ban on inter- marriage. Meticulously worded, signed by thirty-five rabbis and communal lead- ers, and elaborately lettered in calligraphy, the ban is displayed in the lobbies of Syrian Jewish synagogues and community centers. Any member of the communi- ty, male or female, who marries a non-Jew, as well as any children that might re- sult from such a marriage, are excommunicated from the group. Conversions to Judaism for the purpose of marriage are simply not recognized. Paper copies of the ban are easily available and, as Zenner notes, are known to have been sent in the mail to Syrian Jewish men reported to be dating non-Jewish women. Such arrogance and protective insularity is felt to be justified by an ancient and holy community whose ancestors, as members take for granted, have walked in the shadow of King David himself. As every child in the Aleppan-sponsored Ma- gen David Yeshiva in Brooklyn knows, in Biblical times King David and his gen- eral Joab ben Zeruiah conquered the land north of Israel all the way up to city of Aram Zoba, as "Halab" was known in the Hebrew Bible (2 Samuel 8, 1 Chroni- cles 18, and Psalm 60). The name "Halab," meaning "milk" in both Arabic and He- brew, stems from the tradition that Abraham stopped to milk his flocks there before continuing to the Holy Land. Residents and descendants from the area were and are known as "Halabi" and "Halabiyyeh." (Damascenes were known as "Shami.") Italian traders on the caravan and sea routes from Europe rendered the name Hal- ab as "Aleppo." Significantly, the Hebrew initials of Aram Zoba happen to be aleph-resh- tzaddi, or "Eretz"; and it is this Hebrew abbreviation that identifies most of the community's prayer books and rabbinic documents. There was no international border between the two areas until after World War I, when Syria and Lebanon be- came French Mandates and Palestine went to the British. In Ottoman days they had been part of the same province. Indeed, Syria as a whole was considered to be an extension of the Holy Land itself, with portions of the halakhah applicable to Eretz Yisrael also applying there. "What do you mean, return?" sniffed one community mother, upon hearing her graduate student daughter wax enthusiastic on the glo- ries of modern Jewish history and the Return to Zion. "As far as Grandma was con- cerned, she never left." Zenner admits at the end of his book that the example of the Syrian Jews is of limited practical use to the rest of the American Jewish community. As he points out, "a heavy price must be paid for insulation." Nevertheless, this community rep- resents at the very least a magnificent opportunity for research. Their unbroken line permits the observer to see what all Jewish communities must have been like at the dawn of their existence. There is much work that can yet be done, and Wal- ter P. Zenner has blazed the trail. Marianne Sanua Florida Atlantic University Boca Raton, Florida 359</page></plain_text>
