Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1991. xii, 267 pp. This volume is an important contribution to our knowledge of both Argentine and Jewish immigration history. Haim Avni gives us a thoroughly researched and detailed account of the development of Argentine immigration policy from the early nineteenth century up to the mid-twentieth century. In addition, he places in perspective the particular situation of the Jews in the countries of emigration, especially in Eastern Europe, and later on also in the Central European countries. The immigration of Sephardim from the Ottoman Empire and North Africa is referred to only sporadically. The story recounted here reflects the interplay between Argentina's need for immigration and, on the one hand, the devices it conjured in order to select the most desirable immigrants, and on the other, the historical necessities of Jews in Europe in search of a new haven. The Immigration and Colonization Law of 1876 effectively expressed the Argentine Republic's need for immigrants in its earliest days. Thus, when the pogroms of 1881 in Russia prompted the exodus of Jews, the Argentine government saw fit to send an agent to recruit Jewish immigrants. This was quite in line with political thinking in Argentina in the 1880s, a time when the country's liberals effectively brought about the introduction of secular education and civil marriage. Argentina's effort to recruit Jewish 2.

The Jews of Eastern Europe apparently knew nothing about Argentina or were turned off by notions of the Spanish Inquisition. In 1889, when the S.S. Weser brought a sizable group of Jewish passengers to Argentina, the situation changed. At the time Argentina was at the end of a brief period in which a lavish free-ticket policy had been put in effect in order to attract immigration. Concurrently, Jewish communal leaders such as Baron Maurice de Hirsch, through the Alliance Israel1ite Universelle and the yet-to-be-founded Jewish Colonization Association (JCA), prompted the settlement of Jews in agricultural colonies in Argentina. The organized transfer of groups of settlers to colonies in the Argentine hinterland was a unique phenomenon in the history of modem Jewish immigration, and Avni's familiarity with the JCA archives allows him to amply document this chapter of the saga. He describes with abundant detail the missed opportunity during the two decades preceding World War I, when Argentina's immigration potential was very high but the JCA concentrated on populating the colonies at its own pace, neglecting to provide assistance to Jewish immigrants to Buenos Aires and other cities. After World War I, the Red Scare or fear of a political revolution was felt both in the United States and in Argentina. Though Argentina, unlike the United States, did not establish quotas, it increased its bureaucratic regulations, which definitely favored rural over urban immigrants. Growing nationalism, xenophobia, and Catholic nativism, together with pro-Nazi proclivities in certain political circles, further restricted the entrance of Jews. As the Nazi era began, Argentina was beset by economic and social problems, and proceeded to shut the doors with new laws implemented on January 1, 1933. Later on in the decade further restrictions were instituted, fueled mainly by a growing fear of communism. Avni documents scenarios of twenty-three ships, among them the S.S. Conte Grande and the S.S. General San Martin, arriving with refugees between December 1938 and December 1939, with some 200 passengers being denied entry. The vast majority was Jewish. About 250,000 Jews entered Argentina between 1810 and 1950. Avni asks why so few, though the United States and Palestine (Israel) were the only countries to receive more Jewish immigrants during that period. He concludes that before the Nazi era the volume of Jewish immigration to Argentina was low because few Jews were interested in settling there, and because Jewish leaders both in Europe and in Argentina provided little encouragement.</page><page sequence="3">184 BOOK REVIEWS During the Nazi era and the postwar years, Jewish immigration was severely curtailed by Argentine immigration policies. In light of the fact that throughout Argentina's history even liberals have advocated the disappearance of ethnicity through the integration of immigrants into the country's mainstream, and have propounded the image of Argentina as a Catholic country, one could reverse Avni's question and ask why so many Jews ended up in Argentina. All through the narrative Avni gives us multiple examples of influential Argentine policy-makers who harbored deep-seated fears and suspicions of Russian Jews in spite of their otherwise liberal postures. Thus, Immigration Commissioner Juan Alsina, around the turn of the century, advocated his country's policy favoring immigration, but believed in limiting the access of Jews and other heterogeneous groups. Four decades later, during World War II, Tomas Le Breton, the Argentine representative at the Evian Conference and ambassador to Great Britain in 1940-42, combined hatred of the Nazis with insensitivity and dislike for the Jews. A pro-Allies liberal, Le Breton was adamant about not allowing Jewish refugees into Argentina, not even for the purpose of reuniting German-Jewish children from England with relatives already in Argentina. Still, Jews entered the country, and within the Latin American context, Argentina received the great share of Jewish immigration. This, no doubt, was due primarily to the country's early liberal immigration policy and to its openness to Europeans, a policy that prevailed over the personal sentiments of those advocating it. Starting with the Nazi period the situation reversed and Jewish immigration was deeply curtailed. Avni's work, an abridged and updated version of his Argentina y la historia de la inmigracion judia (Buenos Aires, 1983), is a welcome addition to the literature on Argentine Jewry in English.
