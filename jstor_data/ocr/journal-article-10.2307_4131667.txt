PHILIP ROTH'S THE PLOT AGAINST AMERICA by Naomi Sokoloff In his study Reading for the Plot, Peter Brooks defines plot as that which "makes us read forward, seeking in the unfolding of narrative a line of intention and a portent of design that hold the promise of progress toward meaning."] Plot proves to be a rich and multifaceted concept to explore in reading Philip Roth's novel The Plot against America (2004), in which counterfactual histories, personal plotlines, a cluster of subplots, and the reader's awareness of metanarra- tive ("masterplot") all contribute to the complex shaping of the text.2 To begin with, some brief plot summary can reveal the major outlines of Roth's fictional project in this text. The author imagines what would have happened had Charles Lindbergh won the 1940 U.S. presidential election, instead of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Widely celebrated as a true American hero for his aviation exploits, the Lindy of historical record was also a Nazi sympathizer. In the novel, the election of his fictional counterpart to the presidency ushers in an era of antisemitic measures. Notably, Lindbergh creates an "Office of American Absorption" that removes Jews from their homes for resettlement in remote locations so as to weaken their community ties and undermine the Jewish identity of their children. The story is told, in significant measure, from the perspective of a child named Philip Roth whose family and New Jersey upbringing closely resemble those of the author. Plot, however, is more than just summary, and this brief outline barely begins to indicate the multiple dimensions of storytelling and unfolding plots that Roth weaves together in this text. As Brooks points out, the word plot itself may mean several things: (a) a series of events, the action in a narrative; (b) a secret plan; (c) a chart or diagram (hence the verb to plot, as in plotting a graph); and (d) a small piece of ground.3 In Roth's novel, all these definitions are of interest, as each has to do with design or intention, and each adds to the design of the narration or narrated events. The meaning of "plot" that emerges most directly and immediately in the novel is the idea of conspiracy. One of the main characters, journalist 1.

Brooks, Reading for the Plot, 11-12. 305</page><page sequence="2">Naomi Sokoloff Walter Winchell, explicitly describes the creeping fascism of the Lindbergh administration as a "plot against America" (260). The primary story at hand is one of spreading antisemitism, and readers make sense of this plot-that is, both the storyline and the anti-Jewish connivance-because of their knowledge of what happened in Europe during the Nazi era. We expect a horrifying sequence of events because we have heard the tale, recounted many times, of ominous dis- criminatory legislation followed by escalating restrictions on Jews, mob violence, deportation, and then much worse.4 It is our anticipation of such developments that creates the almost unbearable suspense in the novel. In other words, the plot moves forward because we are familiar with a particular metanarrative: an overarching story and framework of references. Significantly, literary critics often use the term "masterplot" interchangeably with "metanarrative." In this case, that designation seems peculiarly apt, as the overarching narrative in ques- tion entails the sinister intentions and designs of people who deem themselves a "master race." Altogether, these circumstances illustrate a basic narratological precept: that plot is not just the outline or armature of a story. Rather than a static organization, it is a structuring operation that is actuated by reading and elicited by meanings that develop temporally through sequence and succession. The basic mechanism that helps confer coherence upon the narrative components in Roth's text is the fact that readers, as they read along, inevitably compare the incidents in the novel to historical precedents. Within this dynamic, Roth pursues two main agendas. One is to establish a big panorama of alternative history. He imagines a "what if" world of political developments and public events, thus creating a counterfactual novel. This genre, which has grown hugely popular since the 1960s, owes much to science fiction and has a lot in common with gamesmanship: The most impassioned devotees tend to be the sorts of people who revel in extremely detailed military games, with each artillery battery and quarter- master unit minutely replicated and maneuvered. The gamesmanship of premise building suggests the fanaticism of rotisserie-league baseball payers who make up their own imaginary rosters of real, statistically accurate players and face them off on the basis of those statistics, say the 1927 Yankees against the 1961 Yankees.5 Unlike science fiction, which is oriented toward the future or alternative worlds, counterfactuals (sometimes called "uchronia") remain in the past, where the plot- line starts with an established fact and then diverges from the historical flow at a specific point.6 Roth, working in this narrative mode, provides a profusion of details that accurately document the events and Americana of the 1940s, then 4. Though the characters in the novel have some idea about all of this, readers in 2004 and beyond know much more than they do, so the fear-inducing effect is in some ways heightened. 5.

A Web site devoted to this topic, www.uchronia.com, lists thousands of counterfactual novels, including The Plot against America. 306</page><page sequence="3">The Plot Against America veers off to describe the election of President Lindbergh. Is the counterhistory he constructs persuasive? Not surprisingly, critical responses have been much concerned with this question, and readers' opinions have been divided. Some say yes, there is an unsettling plausibility to the scenario Roth invents (see, for example, J. M. Coetzee and Alan Cooper), whereas others emphatically disagree (notably, Ruth Wisse).7 Clive James finds the novel unconvincing and quips, "The insuperable problem with The Plot Against America is that America is against the plot."8 Yet another possibility is irony. Paul Berman, reviewing the book in the New York Times, noted that the "tabloid melodrama" of the title suggests Roth may be poking fun at his own "absurd and lachrymose" vision of America as a fascist country.9 But Berman also thinks the book takes a serious look at Jewish fears, if not American politics; in his view, although the setting is contrived, the portrayal of long-standing Jewish anxieties is not. Those anxieties are the focus of agenda number two in the novel, which is to explore the story of the Roth family reacting to world events. At the center of that tale is the experience of the little boy, Phil, and here we find a plot that is fam- iliar from many of Roth's novels. Time and again, the author's work features bad boys who rebel against decent middle-class, protective Jewish parents or who oscillate, torn between wanting to be dutiful sons and wanting to be sly, mischie- vous upstarts. In The Plot against America, the protagonist tries to be naughty. He hangs out with delinquents, sneaks around town without his parents' permission, and plots (twice) to run away from home. However, this bad-boy story is placed against the backdrop of an antisemitic America. Consequently, it is possible to read the title another way: "the plot against America" suggests the superimposi- tion of personal plotline against the larger panorama. Given the force of emerging antisemitism, naughtiness fails. When the parents are insecure and vulnerable, when vicious antisemitism takes on momentum in the broader landscape, the idea of rebellion against the family and engaging in mischief for its own sake no longer seems so appealing.10 This point emerges especially as nine-year-old Phil responds to the news that the government might force him to move from Newark to Kentucky. The boy's great fear is that, in the new location, he would be obliged to befriend the only other Jewish kid-Seldon, the loser. This prospect is so appalling that he takes off in the dead of night, intent on joining an orphanage. The narrator explains, 7. J. M.

Critics have long viewed rebelliousness-especially rebellion against one's parents--as a major focus of Roth's fiction. For example, Judith Paterson Jones and Guinevera A. Nance devote an entire chapter, "Good Girls and Boys Gone Bad," to this theme in their monograph Philip Roth (New York: Frederick Ungar, 1981), 9-86. 307</page><page sequence="4">Naomi Sokoloff "I wanted nothing to do with history. I wanted to be a boy on the smallest scale possible. I wanted to be an orphan" (233). But his rebellion fails: He gets kicked in the head by a horse, rescued ignominiously by Seldon, and finally, cor- ralled back into the safety of his family. To top it all off, he loses his stamp album --his prize possession, which symbolizes his innocent vision of American great- ness. The author does not allow Phil his escape. Instead, just as Roth (the writer) returns to his own family history by writing a highly nostalgic novel, the author returns his protagonist home, compelling him to become a full participant in the family's unfolding history. Even if they are allied with losers, burdened with a heritage of persecution, and disillusioned with their homeland, Jewish parents and neighbors are his people, and he belongs with them." By developing this plotline, the author situates himself in-but also diverges from-a modem Jewish literary tradition that often features orphans. The most salient example of that tradition is Sholem Aleichem's Mottel, the cantor's son, who immigrates to America from eastern Europe shouting, "Hurrah, I'm an orphan!" Parentlessness for that character means electing a patrimony and embra- cing new possibilities; Mottel serves as an emblem of an entire community of Jews, an orphaned people who find freedom in a new world with laughter through their tears.12 Roth, in contrast to Sholem Aleichem, rejects such symbols. For his character, the good option is to stay the course, to embrace a modest, some- times limiting and annoying Jewish American boyhood, and to accept his origins by accepting his family of origin. Reinforcing this point, Roth deploys many subplots about orphans. (Both Seldon and Phil's cousin Alvin have lost their fathers and look for new father figures even as the country as a whole looks tragically and erro- neously to Lindbergh as a paternalistic leader.) In comparison to these alternatives, Phil's own situation is the best. As the subplots put into relief, he has a decent, caring father. It is useful to remember that, in the classic novel, subplot often suggests a different solution to the problems worked out in the main plot. As Brooks points out, it may serve as a way of illustrating and warding off the danger of a short circuit, of a solution that is too easy, and so assures us that the main plot will continue to the end.13 In Roth's novel, the secondary stories about discontinuity, adoption, or displaced lineage help defuse the allure of rebellion. They are superseded by a main plot in which the protagonist learns to stay put and reconcile himself both to his history and to being a part of his community's past and future. Now, the two kinds of plot outlined so far-the panoramic alternative national history and the personal plot-do not always fit neatly together. Reviewer Jason Cowley finds the long, expository history narratives dull; similarly, Berman 11. Debra B. Shostak identifies failed attempts to escape from history as a persistent theme in Roth's late fiction, especially the novels of the 1990s, esp. The Human Stain and American Pastoral.

Brooks, Reading for the Plot, 104. 308</page><page sequence="5">The Plot Against America writes, "The conventional novel reader in me was sorry to see the political excite- ments get in the way, and doubly sorry because some of the news events, in their complexity become a little hard to follow."14 Although the two agendas in the novel, the personal and the collective, illuminate one another in some ways, in others they join together awkwardly. One particularly significant but odd juncture comes at the end. That is because The Plot against America has two endings. The historical outcome is explained first. By page 327, we have already learned that Roosevelt will be reelected, that the enemies of American freedom will be exposed as the villains they are, and that World War II will resume. The narrator explicitly spells out the events of October 16, 1942, rapidly summing up national developments and their denouements. However, the personal story of the Roth family is recounted in the following chapter. There, the narrative returns to the previous day, October 15, 1942, underscoring that a distinct perspective and plotline have come into focus. In the second ending, Phil's father and brother go to retrieve Seldon from Kentucky, where he was relocated and where his mother was killed during an anti- Jewish disturbance. They make their way home, plotting their movement across America on a map (358). This ending is literally plotted against America. At the same time, Mother at home also charts their progress on a map that she folds out of the encyclopedia. This duplication of effort underscores the parents' anxiety, and it emphasizes their determination to carry out a plan for recovery and return. Sig- nificantly, the family's storyline involves yet another meaning of the word plot: a small piece of ground or measured area of land. This is what the family values greatly-their little comer of America, their Newark neighborhood, which was built on "farm lots" parceled out for houses. The ending, therefore, echoes the begin- ning of the novel: In the opening paragraphs, Roth (the narrator) lavishes care on the description of his neighborhood, delineating in great detail his particular place in the world and demarcating the boundaries of territory within which he has a sense of belonging and comfort. The connection between the two endings, then, is their par- allel emphasis on a return to the familiar. On a grand scale, the national plotline rees- tablishes historical events as readers today know them; on the more intimate level, Roth's characters make their way doggedly back home. Yet the two endings demon- strate disjunction as well. In part the disconnect is temporal, and in part it is more. The ending that zeroes in on the family's emotional state contrasts with the one that offers an expansive overview of national events, putting into relief the fact that, for the Roths, the story is not yet over. As the author himself has remarked in interviews, the focus of the novel is how individuals experience history: not as chronicle, not as finished narrative, but as the unexpected. When people are in the midst of events, they do not yet know how things will turn out. Cowley sagely observes, "Only in retrospect does history appear to have shape, narrative, direction and meaning. The present as it is lived never feels like that; it feels complicated and confused, a rush of pure sensation."15 By juxtaposing the two endings, Roth's 14.

Cowley, "The Terror of the Unforeseen," 49. 309</page><page sequence="6">Naomi Sokoloff novel calls special attention to these issues. He directs his readers, even when they know the resolution of the plot on a collective level, back to the struggles and perceptions of characters who are not in the know. In the process, Roth also makes the construction of plot itself a central thematic concern. The members of the family struggle to construct a coherent interpretation of events out of the whirl of activity in which they live. And it is especially difficult for them to craft a narrative out of their experience because so many plots abound. Throughout, the members of the Roth family try to plot their own course; they believe in America as a place where individuals may work hard, forge their own futures, and thus construct their own stories-but they are fearful that maybe America is not what they had always dreamed, that they will get caught in the plots and conspiracies of others. Indeed, they have to contend with the evil designs of their enemies. Aunt Evelyn, with her maps and pushpins in the Office of American Absorption, tries to plot out the future of her relatives and other Jews, moving them around in space and thereby altering their identities.16 She, in turn, is a pawn in the plots of higher powers, though she is oblivious to the way they are manipulating her. The Lindbergh government plots against the Jews while they themselves are the puppets of a Nazi plot to take over England. Making things more difficult to sort out, polemics loom large in the novel. The characters, as well as readers, are exposed to different versions of the same events as a variety of groups accuse each other of fomenting plots. (The Nazis, not surpris- ingly, warn America of a global Jewish conspiracy.) Altogether, in a novel whose title calls attention to plot right away, it turns out there is no single, unified plot against America but multiple, multidimensional types of plots. Individuals have to struggle with this multiplicity and decide what they are going to believe, how they are going to respond within their personal plotlines to the political plots (in all their counterfactual detail), as well as to the subplots that complicate their landscape. Out of all this, they must construct their own version of the story, even as readers, too, seek out the inter- connectedness among discrete incidents, episodes, and actions-thus building their understanding of the narrated events out of the narration itself."7 For both the char- acters and the readers, though in different measure, the postulating, unmaking, and repostulating of coherence in the face of events takes place as they measure new information against the masterplot that sets up early expectations. The ending has a special role in all this. Endings, as moments of closure, have a special status in the structure of narrative. Because plots grant meaning over time, endings are the legitimating authority on which beginnings and middles depend for their retrospective meaning. That is, readers assume the end of the story will confer understanding on what has come before. Accordingly, they make provisional interpretations as they read, knowing that what remains to be read will restructure 16. Thanks to Rachel Anderson for her discussion of this point with me. 17. The distinction between narrated events and the narration of them is central to narratological approaches to literature. For classic summaries of these concepts and the terms used to refer to them (fabula and sjuiet, histoire and discours, story and discourse), see, for example, Gerard Genette, Nar- rative Discourse, trans. Jane Lowin (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1970); and Seymour Chatman, Story and Discourse (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1979). 310</page><page sequence="7">The Plot Against America what they have already read. This is the reason Brooks speaks of the "anticipation of retrospection" as a chief tool in making sense ofnarrative.18 In light of these consider- ations, it is useful to observe that the ending of Roth's novel pushes us toward several important conclusions. First, the personal plot, because it has the final word, places the political framework in a subordinate position. Alternative history may be the point of departure, the premise from which the novel grew, but ultimately, it serves as a backdrop and not the main action of the text.19 That is to say, the principal goal here is not gamesmanship or the designing of uchronia; instead, counterfactual conventions are subordinated to the fictional portrayal of individuals who grapple with the impact of national events on their personal lives. Second, the double ending and the multiplicity of plots revealed at the end confer on the readers a keen sense of plot as a construction-not a simple sequence of events but the forging of meaning. Emphasizing how the characters, with all their uncertainties, struggle to interpret the historical forces affecting them, the novel also presents plot as an act of imagining that can make readers more aware of their own ongoing processes of imagining, of constructing the plots of their own lives. In this way, the text invites readers to more readily grasp the insidiousness of antisemitism and perceive what it feels like to be the victim of discrimination. This issue is crucial for interpretation of the novel. Some critics (especially Ruth Wisse) have excoriated Roth for imagining an unlikely antisemitism in the United States while ignoring the all-too-real enemies of the Jews around the globe. In this view, The Plot Against America demonstrates a lack of true empathy with Jews else- where and so contributes to the self-centeredness that is often on display in Roth's fictional oeuvre, filled as that body of work is with characters who want to escape from history and are eager to dissociate themselves from Jewish responsibilities. And yet it can be argued that by imagining a catastrophe in the United States, Americans can identify more with Jews elsewhere. Only by sensing how fascism might manifest itself in their own backyards can readers truly "get it." The minutiae of the counterfactual plot and the encyclopedic detail of the descriptions in The Plot againstAmerica shore up that empathy-inspiring project as they make the prospect of catastrophe seem tangible and convincing. In turn, the personal story of the Roth family strengthens that effect, bringing to life the everyday choices and the con- fusions of individuals who are unsure where evil emanates from, where the immedi- ate dangers lie, who is implicated, and how. Both sorts of plot here, the alternative history and the family history, bring special immediacy to the kind of "what if" premise that animates many of Roth's novels-from his exploration of counterlives (alternative scenarios for the same characters) to his more outrageous speculations (what if Kafka had lived in the United States? What if Anne Frank had survived the Holocaust?). Noting these recurrent emphases in Roth's writing, Andrew Furman observes, "To be a Jewish American in the twentieth century is to ask a series of what if questions. What if I had been born in 1933 in Germany or 18. Brooks, Reading for the Plot, 23. 19. Roth describes the genesis of the novel in "The Story Behind The Plot Against America," New York Times Book Review, September 9, 2004, 10-12. 311</page><page sequence="8">Naomi Sokoloff Czechoslovakia or Poland? What if my parents or grandparents fled to Israel rather than the United States?"20 Roth's fiction often asks such questions by twisting Jewish fate satirically or in a kind of postmodern game. The turns of plot in The Plot against America, however, put the questions to American readers both more frighteningly and in a way that is much closer to home.21 Altogether, whether we find Roth's alternative history frivolous and disrespectful or an invitation to serious imaginative empathy, plot, in many senses, is deeply engaged with history in this novel. Like his major novels of the 1990s (The Human Stain, American Pastoral, I Married a Communist), The Plot against America offers openly historical plotlines. At the same time, the treatment of conspiracy forefronts malicious plotting as a theme. Evil designs, conspiratorial moves, and counterplots are even visualized concretely in space as Aunt Evelyn plots out her pushpin map of a fascist United States. Throughout the novel, a metanarrative or masterplot- the historical record of genocide-looms large and heavily influences all the narrated events. Amid all this, the subplots present a significant revision of previous Roth plots, replacing stories of self-absorption and escape from history with an emphasis on reentry into history. Finally, personal life stories in this novel yield plots that highlight the dilemmas of individuals within the whirlwind of major national events, and these developments direct readers to think about ways of knowing history-both in terms of coherent overviews (teleologically unfolding events) and in terms of confusing process (as yet unfinished, filled with contradictions, informed by fragmented or partial perspectives). These elements of the text draw attention to the constructedness of plot and to personal decision making: the choices individuals make when faced with dire political developments. All told, this novel displays complex and multidi- mensional kinds of plot. The concept of plot proves so rich and productive in approaching this novel because Roth himself is so invested in exploring history and in the telling of history, the construction of narrative, and the retelling of his own tales.

Additional commentary on Roth's views of Jewish history can be found in Steven Milowitz, Philip Roth Considered: The Concen- trationary Universe of the American Writer (New York: Garland, 2000). Milowitz finds the Holocaust to be a profound, central obsession of Roth's work. This study argues, a bit oddly, that even the self- centeredness and self-absorption of characters such as Alexander Portnoy and Nathan Zuckerman orig- inate in Holocaust awareness, because to ignore self is "to let the victimizer win" (152)--that is, not to challenge Nazi efforts to depersonalize Jews. 312</page></plain_text>
