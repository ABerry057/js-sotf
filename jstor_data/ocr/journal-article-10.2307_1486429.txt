<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE STRUGGLE OVER RELIGIOUS REFORM IN NINETEENTH-CENTURY VIENNA by MARSHA L. ROZENBLIT In 1871, the board of the Jewish community of Vienna attempted to reform Sabbath and holiday services in the two synagogues under its official jurisdiction. Following the guidelines established by the Leipzig Synod in 1869, the board decided to remove from the liturgy all prayers that called for a return of the Jewish people to the land of Israel and for the restitution of the ancient sacrificial system of worship. In addition, Vienna's Jewish lead- ers announced that the introduction of an organ, the symbol of the Reform movement, was a good idea.' The board never implemented these radical reforms. An enormous protest from Vienna's Orthodox community, as well 1. "Antrag auf Reformen im 6ffentlichen Gottesdienste; Verhandlung des Vorstandes vom 22. Januar und 5.

ROZENBLIT as from numerous individuals who professed no particular commitment to religious Orthodoxy but who preferred to pray in the traditional manner, forced the leaders of the community to back down from these ideological reforms and to implement only a few, relatively minor "modifications" in the services in the temples. Viennese Jews rejected the ideological changes which were gaining in popularity in German Jewish communities in the last third of the nineteenth century. Despite their rejection of ideological reform, Vienna's Jews played an important role in the history of the Reform movement. Vienna is famous for introducing a modern, aestheticized, decorous religious service-the Vienna Rite-in its communal temple as early as 1826, and for doing so in an atmosphere of consensus, unaccompanied by the antagonisms which accom- panied such religious modernization in Jewish communities in the German states and Hungary.2 The Vienna Rite became the model for religious in- novation elsewhere in the Habsburg monarchy.3 Moreover, Viennese Jews opted for a modern-style rabbi in the 1820s, and the city's first two preachers, Reform rabbis Isak Noa Mannheimer and Adolf Jellinek, deserve their reputations as great pulpit orators. Indeed, Mannheimer pioneered in the transformation of rabbi into pastor.4 2. For an overview, see Hans Tietze, Die Juden Wiens: Geschichte-Wirtschaft-Kultur (Leip- zig and Vienna: E. P. Tal, 1933), pp. 150-157. Tietze called the Vienna Rite "eine harmonische Vereinigung der alten Tradition mit modernen Anschauungen." For a very positive nineteenth- century evaluation of modernized worship in Vienna, see Isak Marcus Jost, Geschichte der Israeliten, vol. 10 (Berlin: Schlesinger'sche Buch- und Musikhandlung, 1847), pp. 68-69. Although generally changes in Vienna have been ignored by Germanocentric scholarship, Michael A. Meyer's masterful new study of the Reform movement is a marvelous exception, placing Viennese developments squarely within the history of early Reform. See his Response to Modernity: A History of the Reform Movement in Judaism (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988), pp. 146-151. I am delighted that Meyer's book appeared in time for me to incorporate his interpretations into this article. 3. Meyer, pp. 151, 154, 159-160, 193, 196. Robert Wistrich argues that in the matter of religious reform, Vienna, located between East and West, "mediated" and "softened" German innovations and thus enabled their spread. Although Wistrich overstates his point, crediting too much to Viennese sagacity in the matter, Vienna did serve as an important model of moder- ate religious innovation. See Wistrich's "The Modernization of Viennese Jewry: The Impact of German Culture in a Multi-Ethnic State," in Toward Modernity: The European Jewish Model, ed.

Vienna spawned no independent Reform groups like the Hamburg Temple or the radical Reform associations in Berlin and Pest. The 1840s did not produce a call to remove prayers for Zion, as some reformers in the German states sought. Even emancipation in 1867 did not permit success for those who sought ideological change. Viennese Jews preferred the Viennese brand of Jewish religious modernity and resisted attempts to reform the liturgy further. Although participating in the Reform movement in its early phases, Vienna's Jewish community had placed itself outside the scope of the move- ment by the end of the nineteenth century. Many factors explain the persistence of such modernized traditionalism in Vienna. In the first half of the nineteenth century the government opposed radical religious innovation, and in general the Viennese en- vironment-conservative and Catholic-was not conducive to fundamental change in Judaism. In addition, the force of inertia and a general human tendency to adhere to that which is familiar played an important role in Viennese Judaism. The most important reason, however, for traditionalism among Vienna's Jews was the demographic composition of the Jewish com- munity. The large numbers of observant Hungarian Jews who migrated to Vienna in the second half of the nineteenth century created a large reservoir of people in the city who might want to modernize but who vehemently opposed the Reform movement. Demographic factors explain both the early success of aesthetic reform in Vienna and the later vehement opposi- tion to more thoroughgoing religious innovations. Similar factors may also have been at work in other cities. The Creation of the Vienna Rite Viennese Jews were among the first in Europe to demand modernization of their religious services. As early as 1811, the very small number of tolerat- ed Jews in the capital bought a site at Dempfingerhof to serve as a modern school, a ritual bath, and a "better" place of worship.5 In 1819 some of the 5.

ROZENBLIT tolerated Jews, led by a wealthy merchant, Michael Lazar Biedermann, wanted to introduce reforms similar to those recently adopted by the Berlin and Hamburg Reform congregations. They petitioned the administration of Lower Austria (the province in which Vienna was located) for permission to introduce an organ, a German sermon, and some prayers in German so as to increase devotion and appeal to the youth.6 In the explanation they offered to their fellow Jews, the petitioners stressed the need to attract the youth, bored and alienated in the traditional synagogue, and women, ignored by Jewish tradition altogether. Purifying the service, they insisted, could instruct, edify, and arouse noble sentiments in these two groups.7 At this point the government appeared interested in the request for litur- gical reforms. On several occasions in 1820 and 1821 the police requested information from the reformers and the official representatives of the Jews about the services they desired and the space and personnel they would need in order to introduce such services properly. Biedermann and the others assured the authorities that "the educated class of Israelites here have long cherished the desire for an improvement of their ritual." They assured the police that the desired reforms in no way signified a fundamental change or the creation of a new sect in Judaism. What they sought was merely "to abolish the abuses that had crept into the service in the course of time" and to replace practices that were no longer relevant with ones that were. In addition to a preacher, a cantor, an organist, choir singers, and choir boys, they wanted to purchase a nice place for worship, to develop a prayerbook based on the Reform prayerbooks presently emerging in Germany, and to introduce sermons and religious instruction "to promote true religiosity, inculcate pure moral teaching, and ennoble the heart."8 These early requests for reforms came at a time when the Austrian 6.

In 1818, for example, the court chancery advised the kaiser to require rabbis in Bohemia to know German and to have studied some philosophy, natural law, and morality. The court chancery also felt that a good way to Germanize the Jews would be to require them to pray and hear sermons in German. Aware that some Prussian Jews had already started to pray in German, the chancery suggested that Austria hire a few Prussian rabbis.9 On January 29, 1820, Kaiser Francis I decreed that in order to improve Jewish morality and bring the Jews closer to the rest of his subjects, after a certain (unspecified) point in time rabbis would have to demonstrate their knowledge of philosophy and Jewish religious learning, and all Jewish prayers would have to be in German or another language of his realm.'0 At the same time, the government was considering an overall revision of the Jewry laws. It hinted that religious reform would cast the Jews in a more favorable light among the law-makers, even though the Lower Austrian government refused to allow any connection between Jewish religious reform and an improvement in the legal status of the Jews." The tolerated Jews who sought reform in the style of Hamburg or Berlin did not get the opportunity to impose their will on the rest of the com- munity. The Austrian government, inherently conservative, feared the consequences of religious innovation and never pursued its goal of German- izing Jewish religious observance. Moreover, since the authorities did not even permit a Jewish community in the capital, they prohibited the re- formers from buying a new building for their services. Consequently, the reformers had to compromise with more traditional elements in the com- munity when they arranged the services in the newly renovated synagogue in 1826.12 The reformers were successful, however, in obtaining for Vienna one 9.

In this case the court chancery was more liberal than the Lower Austrian administration. It expressed its annoyance with the province for undercutting the moral education of the Jews by separating the two issues. 12.

ROZENBLIT of the early modern-style rabbis who favored religious reform: Isak Noa Mannheimer. Bringing Mannheimer to Vienna was largely the work of Michael Lazar Biedermann, who had heard Mannheimer preach in Berlin and at the Leip- zig Fair in the early 1820s, and had invited him to give some lectures in Vienna. Mannheimer belonged to the first generation of Reform rabbis. Born in Copenhagen in 1793 to a family originally from Hungary, he received a modern education, including Gymnasium and university training. Influenced by Israel Jacobson's early reform work in Westphalia, he gave sermons at private Reform services in the Danish capital, held one Wednes- day a month. Opposition to Reform in Copenhagen prompted Mannheimer to seek his fortune in Berlin in 1821, where he befriended Leopold Zunz and other scholars of the early Wissenschaft des Judentums movement. In Berlin, and later in Hamburg and Leipzig, where he preached and worked, Mannheimer traveled in Reform circles.'3 Mannheimer articulated his Reform convictions in a memorandum he wrote in 1821 for the representa- tives of the Viennese Jewish community. He called for a shorter service, removal of many piyyutim (medieval liturgical hymns), order and decorum, greater use of the vernacular, a three-year Torah-reading cycle, and the elimination of all that contradicted modern sensibilities and the perfor- mance of civic duties, including the prayers about the Messiah.'4 Nervous about Mannheimer's reputation as a Reform rabbi and fearful that reforms would lead to deism or worse, the Austrian authorities refused to recognize Mannheimer as rabbi or preacher, allowing him only the title of "religious teacher." They approved his position in Vienna only on the con- dition that both in his personal behavior and in his public functions he hold fast to the principles of Judaism as presented in Jewish holy writings. They firmly instructed Mannheimer not to introduce any innovations in the synagogue or school that were not sanctioned by Jewish religious tradition and to avoid any tendencies to "natural religion" in his sermons."5 13.

In these statutes Viennese Jews articulated the principles that would guide their religious life through the twentieth century. In the first place, the statutes asserted that religious services would adhere to the traditional form as long as that form had good legal authority. Secondly, the external form of the services would be cleansed of all that was disturbing or unworthy. Finally, services would employ all means to stimulate devotion, religious feeling, and communal solidarity. In other words, Viennese Jews committed themselves to order and decorum during a traditional service.'6 The 1829 rules for the synagogue concerned themselves primarily with order, dignity, and decorum. The statutes advised Jews to take their seats silently, and not to go in and out of services. They were to maintain quiet at all times and to avoid any offensive conduct which would disturb devotion. In particular, they were not to pray aloud except during times of communal singing, and then to follow the lead of the choir. Even mourners were instructed to intone the Kaddish softly so as not to detract from the cantorial performance of the mourners' prayer. If congregants had any complaints, the statutes advised, they must present them in writing only to the board supervising the temple. In addition, the statutes abolished the public sale of aliyot (synagogue honors), because of the accompanying commotion and because it was simply disgraceful to sell synagogue honors. In their concern for order and dignity, these statutes resemble-but do not go nearly as far as-early reform Synagogenordnungen in other German states."7 Viennese concern for decorum and a beautiful, uplifting service revealed itself clearly in the rules the 1829 statutes specified for the cantor, who was to be chosen primarily for his musical ability. The statutes charged the cantor with the responsibility of infusing the prayers with beauty and 16. "Statuten fiir das Bethaus der Israeliten in Wien," Introduction, CAHJP, AW 1271. 17.

ROZENBLIT worthiness. He had to pronounce all the Hebrew words clearly and correct- ly, know German well, follow the prescribed liturgy, and get the prior approval of the religious teacher and temple board before instituting any changes in the service. Only the cantor could chant the Mi Sheberakh, the special prayer for those who received synagogue honors, and the community expected the cantor to officiate at weddings and circumcisions along with the religious teacher. His personal life, the statutes insisted, must brinpg honor to his position. Finally, the cantor was responsible for training the choir, and for making sure its members behaved well during services and led "a religious and moral life."'8 Above all, the 1829 statutes called for the modernization of the role of rabbi. The "religious teacher" (who later took the title "preacher") would serve as pastor, teacher, and spiritual leader (Seelsorger), a moral exemplar for the whole community. Although the statutes did not explicitly say so, Viennese Jews expected their religious teacher to be trained and to function like a Protestant minister. Instead of traditional talmudical learning, his education had to provide him with a solid grounding in philosophy, theol- ogy, and Bible. Since his main role was to give sermons and other forms of religious instruction, he had to speak German well and have a strong moral character. His sermons should teach "pure, original Judaism," and not be pedantic exercises concerned with forms and ceremonies; they should radiate religiosity, morality, brotherly love, love of fatherland, and domestic virtue. In addition to hour-long sermons every other Saturday and the first days of all holidays, the religious teacher's pastoral functions included offi- ciating at rites of passage and serving as official registrar of all Jewish births, marriages, and deaths. Finally, in an attempt to assert lay control, the statutes stipulated that all changes in the liturgy required the approval of the board overseeing the temple.'9 In its zeal for a new-style rabbi, Vienna seems to have been in the forefront of change in Central Europe. While several German communities-including the Orthodox Jewish community of Hamburg-wanted a modern rabbi in the 1820s, nowhere else were modern rabbinical functions spelled out so clearly and so thoroughly as in 18.

The newly renovated Stadttempel, dedicated on April 9, 1826, was cer- tainly a worthy location for the dignified and beautiful services that Viennese Jews sought. Although the tolerated Jewish community was not permitted to construct a synagogue identifiable as such from the street, it built a large and impressive synagogue inside the outer shell of an ordinary building on Seitenstettengasse in the Inner City, on the location of the form- er Dempfingerhof synagogue. This synagogue (also known as the Seiten- stettengasse temple), designed by the famous Viennese architect Josef Korn- hijusel, conformed to the requirements of Jewish religious tradition in most respects and satisfied the desire of Vienna's wealthy Jews for an impressive place of worship. The synagogue took the form of a large rotunda with dome, and it contained twelve Ionic columns and a double gallery. The lat- ter, covered with latticework, served as the women's section. The most notable break with European synagogue architecture was the placement of lecterns for preacher and cantor on a stage at the front of the congregation. Non-Jewish observers, present at the dedication of the Seitenstettengassen- tempel, commented favorably on its spectacular beauty and ability to uplift the worshiper.2' The actual worship service in this imposing new synagogue conformed to the newly emerging "modern" style sought by the reformers, but it remained traditional in content, with only some minor changes. Thus, decorum and dignity pervaded a worship service conducted entirely in Hebrew by an excellent cantor, some male singers, and a boys' choir, un- 20. The earliest Synagogenordnung in Germany, that of Westphalia in 1810, while very con- cerned with decorum, lay control, and the role of the cantor, makes no mention of a modern rabbi; Petuchowski, pp. 106-111. Indeed, none of the thirteen sets of German Ordnungen from 1810 to 1848 which Lowenstein, pp. 286-289, studied dealt in any detail with the role of the rabbi, except for the common demand that he give regular German sermons. See also Schorsch, pp. 208-209. Unfortunately Schorsch's study focused on the territory of the later German Reich, and thus he ignored Mannheimer, who would have served as an excellent example of his thesis. 21. Eisler, "Seitenstetten Tempel," pp. 154-155, 157, in CAHJP, AW 1271. Because the Seitenstettengassentempel was located within the shell of an ordinary building, the Nazis could not burn it down on Kristallnacht, and thus it escaped the fate of most synagogues in the Third Reich.</page><page sequence="10">188 MARSHA L. ROZENBLIT accompanied by an organ. The central feature of the service may have been Mannheimer's lengthy, edifying German sermon, but despite the reformers' desire for a shorter service, Jews in Vienna continued to do virtually all the prayers sanctioned by tradition. Mannheimer and the reformers had managed to excise a few prayers which offended their sensibilities-the piyyutim (medieval liturgical poems), except on the High Holidays, the vengeful prayer Av Harachamim, and some of the talmudic passages at the end of the Sabbath service which dealt in great detail with the incense in the ancient Temple in Jerusalem. Despite Mannheimer's desire to introduce German prayers, the only German prayers in the so-called Vienna Rite were the prayer for the government and special prayers before and after the ser- mon, but these German prayers were intoned by Mannheimer alone and did not form part of the communal liturgy. In addition, the Vienna Rite in- cluded confirmation for boys and girls. Like most early reforms, none of these changes represented an ideological break with Jewish tradition. Indeed, Mannheimer felt that the Orthodox would be unable to find fault with the Viennese services, because they conformed to the strict guidelines of the Shulchan Aruch, the sixteenth-century code of Jewish law.22 When he first arrived in Vienna, Mannheimer felt terribly frustrated by Viennese conservatism. In a letter to Zunz of 31 October 1826, for example, Mannheimer complained about how difficult it was to bear those who did not want to change anything in the service. He lamented: "I have had to give up all of my views, all of my goals, all of my expectations, and I am now what I never wanted to be, a craftsmanlike preacher who must be satisfied when his teaching and preaching open a stopped-up ear or soften a hard heart for the moment."23 By the end of the decade, however, he was satisfied with the progress he had made toward "purifying" the service. While he would still have liked more German prayers and more communal singing, 22.

All of the sections of the traditional prayerbook which became an issue for the Reform move- ment in the 1840s and thereafter remained intact in Mannheimer's siddur. Thus, Jews in Vienna continued to pray for the return of the Jews to the land of Israel, the restoration of the Davidic dynasty, and the reinstitution of the sacrificial system of worship. Mannheimer, like so many other Reform- minded prayerbook editors in the nineteenth century, sometimes used the German translation to downplay the traditional concern with these contro- versial issues. He occasionally translated some of the references to Zion and the Davidic dynasty in a slightly less concrete manner than the authors had intended, and he failed to translate prayers unpopular with the reform- ers, like the Yekum Purkan, which prays for the health of the (no longer extant) exilarch and heads of the academies in Babylonia. But most of Mannheimer's translation reflected a strong commitment to tradition, and he faithfully translated all the prayers for the return of the Jews to Zion and the restoration of the sacrifices that were part of the Torah and Musaf services, the time of greatest attendance in the synagogue. Mannheimer's prayerbook clearly remained a traditional siddur.25 The most noticeable sign that Vienna's Jews eschewed significant reforms in their quest for modernity was the absence of an organ in their glorious new synagogue. Mannheimer certainly arrived in Vienna accus- tomed to an organ. Faced with Viennese realities, however, he not only 24.

Mannheimer's prayerbook remained unchanged through scores of reprintings; see, for example, the editions of 1867 and 1888. His prayerbook remained far more traditional than those studied by Petuchowski, e.g., Abraham Geiger's 1854 prayerbook, which retained the structure of the traditional siddur but eliminated prayers for sacrifices and the return of the Jews to Zion, and which exhibited most of its Reform tendencies in the German translation (Petuchowski, pp. 149-151).</page><page sequence="12">190 MARSHA L. ROZENBLIT abandoned his concern for synagogue music but very quickly came to realize that an organ would only provide a Christian intrusion into Judaism. Moreover, when the Jewish community opened a second temple in 1858, Mannheimer blocked the installation of an organ there.26 Vienna's famous cantor, Salomon Sulzer, on the other hand, would have liked organ accom- paniment. Salomon Sulzer played a role equal to that of Isak Noa Mannheimer in creating the Vienna Rite. During his sixty-six-year career, he composed music for Sabbath and holiday services which contributed immeasurably to the beauty, solemnity, and orderliness of public worship in Vienna, and in other synagogues which adopted his compositions. One of the major com- plaints of the early reformers had been that traditional Jewish services were chaotic and disorderly, filled with the screams of people who did not pray in unison, and "led" by a prayer leader totally unfamiliar with the concept of good singing. By hiring a cantor with a magnificent voice who could lead the congregation in prayer and compose impressive musical pieces for the syna- gogue, Vienna's Jews announced that their religious services would be as beautiful and inspiring as those in any church. In so doing, of course, they expressed their commitment to a Judaism they could wear with pride as they sought integration into the gentile world. Sulzer always saw himself as the chief architect of the modern synagogue service. In the preface to Schir Zion, the collection of his musical composi- tions (1840), Sulzer described how he had cleared away centuries of unneces- sary accretions to the Jewish worship service and restored it to its original beauty. He wrote: "I have made it my duty to return as much as possible to the melodies handed down from ancient times, to free and purify the ancient, honorably worthy models from later, arbitrary, and tasteless flourishes, and to expose their original purity both in terms of the text and in terms of the [musical] laws of harmony."27 Decades later Sulzer felt satisfied that he had succeeded in rescuing synagogue music from the barbarity of the Middle Ages, thereby ending "the incivility and the dissonances which had discredited the 'Judenschule,' as the masses called it," and arranging the "old 26.

Sulzer did not see him- self as a radical reformer unconcerned with Jewish tradition. He felt a strong commitment to Hebrew as the language of Jewish prayer and to retaining memories of Zion in the service.28 Vienna's Jews thus proved remarkably adept at modernizing and beauti- fying services in their synagogue at an early date and ithout any of the major conflicts that typified attempts at reform in cities like Berlin and Hamburg. Clearly Vienna contained a significant proportion of moderniz- ing and acculturating Jews who wanted to change Jewish worship patterns to conform to their newly acquired Western, that is, Christian, values about beauty, spiritual uplift and edification of the individual, and proper religious devotion.29 Thus, although Mannheimer and the reformers had to com- promise with traditional elements in reforming the liturgy, it would seem as if all segments of Viennese Jewry felt comfortable with the modern style adopted in the 1820s. Indeed, in this period Vienna may well have contained the most modern Jewish community in Europe. But the ease with which Viennese Jews accepted aesthetic reform derived not so much from the fact that they stood at the cutting edge of assimilation as from the fact that Vienna contained no large core of traditionalists which could be mobilized to combat reforms. The Vienna Rite owes its success to demographic realities-realities imposed by a hostile government. In the first place, the Jewish community of Vienna in the 1820s was extremely small, numbering less than a thousand people.30 More important, this small group of Jews possessed great wealth and no deep roots in the city. The Austrian authorities in principle did not permit Jews to settle or establish a 28.

ROZENBLIT formal community in the capital. The government did allow a few very wealthy Jewish merchants the privilege of being "tolerated" in Vienna in return for the payment of large sums of money. In 1820 only 135 individuals possessed the right of toleration. The remainder of the Jews in the city consisted of their families, employees, and retainers, all of whom depended on the tolerated merchants.3' These men almost all pursued careers as large- scale merchants, especially in wool, linen, silk, or jewels, or as contractors, brokers, and agents for the court or the army. A few owned factories for the production of sugar, chocolate, and textiles. Eight of them possessed patents of nobility. Like wealthy tolerated Jews in other capitals, by the beginning of the nineteenth century many of them had abandoned the strictures of Jewish religious tradition, especially when it came to the dietary laws and Sab- bath.32 Unlike Berlin or Hamburg, therefore, Vienna contained no cadre of traditionalists, no kehillah whose leaders could mobilize against Reform, and no rabbi who could declare reformers heretics and apostates. Those that did oppose Reform had no forum within which to voice their opposition. Some Viennese Jews certainly preferred traditional forms, and they made sure that services in the Stadttempel did not include organ music or other radical innovations. Moreover, some traditionalists did protest to the government,33 and forty-four of the 135 tolerated Jews in Vienna refused to sign the new communal statutes in 1829.34 A small group of Jews who felt uncomfortable in the elegant and decorous Stadttempel even created their own private synagogue and viewed the man hired to supervise kosher slaughter as their rabbi, but this group did not take upon itself the role of leading opposition to reform. Mannheimer himself felt that no conflicts 31. Grunwald, pp. 113-169. 32. Wachstein, pp. 7, 9-34, in CAHJP, AW 1271.

Most Jews embraced religious modernization. In the decades that followed, Vienna seemed immune to the religious conflict raging in almost every Jewish community in Central Europe. The 1840s, a decade of vigorous ideological reform in other German lands, had no impact on the Jews of the Austrian capital, who remained content with their beautiful, decorous synagogue, their excellent preacher and cantor, and their traditional services. Despite the fact that Viennese Jews sought emancipation just like their coreligionists in Germany, they nevertheless felt no need to strip Judaism of its national overtones in order to convince the authorities that they were worthy of political and civil rights. Opponents of Jewish emancipation may have viewed Jewish liturgical petitions to return to Zion as proof that the Jews could never be patriotic citizens. The Jews of Vienna, however, did not remove prayers for Zion from their prayerbook. Austrian political realities probably precluded the need for such a radical step. Jewish emancipation was not as burning an issue in Austria as in Germany in the 1840s. Moreover, the more complicated nature of Austrian patriotism permitted Jews more latitude with their own national identity than was true in other German lands. Thus, Jewish leaders like Mannheimer, an indefatigable fighter for Jewish rights, confidently asserted the traditional Jewish faith that the Messiah would restore the Jews to their national home. In his published opinion on the new Hamburg Temple prayerbook in 1842, for example, Mannheimer agreed with many of the liturgical changes instituted in Ham- burg, but opposed the elimination of prayers for Zion because he still recog- nized the national aspect of Jewish messianism and was "hoping for and expecting salvation in this sense." Of course Mannheimer viewed the Jewish people as a religious and not a national community and understood the Jewish return to Zion solely in a spiritual and symbolic sense. Mannheimer also distanced himself from the Reform movement in the 1840s by not attending any of the rabbinical conferences of that decade.36 35.

ROZENBLIT He did, however, introduce one important liturgical change in the Vienna Rite in the 1840s. During that decade Mannheimer sought to con- vince the Austrian authorities to remove the special, humiliating oath that Jews had to take when testifying in court. Undoubtedly responding to charges of Jewish untrustworthiness during the debate on this issue, Mann- heimer eliminated Kol Nidre as the introduction to the Yom Kippur service. Although Jewish tradition had interpreted the prayer, which ostensibly asserts that Jewish oaths are not binding, as referring to vain oaths between man and God, opponents of Jewish rights used it as proof of Jewish deceit. Mannheimer replaced Kol Nidre with another prayer that expressed the basic themes of the Day of Atonement. As in other communities which abandoned Kol Nidre in this period, Vienna's cantor sang the new prayer to the beautiful and beloved old melody."37 The men who supervised Jewish religious life in Vienna between the 1820s and 1860s concerned themselves primarily with maintaining the dig- nity and worthiness of the services and with enforcing lay control over Viennese Judaism. The temple board (Bethaus-Vorstand or Bethaus- Verwaltung), composed of prominent and wealthy men, faced no contro- versies in these years as it calmly set the time for services, sold and rented seats in the synagogue, decided salary matters and vacation times for rabbis and cantors, and admonished the choir boys for bad behavior during ser- vices.38 The Bethaus-Vorstand regularly asserted its control over the isr.

Mannheimer did include here the original text of Kol Nidre, presumably for those who wanted to say the prayer to themselves, but in very small type, untranslated, and below a line under the new introductory prayer. Similarly, Sulzer's Schir Zion provided the traditional melody for the new prayer (p. 303), and Kol Nidre itself only in an appendix. For similar solutions to the "problem" of Kol Nidre in German Reform congregations, see Petuchowski, pp. 338-347.

The Obercantor-Sulzer, that is-had to conduct morning and evening services on Sabbaths and all holidays "exactly according to the style introduced in the temple" and "with festivity and dignity," wearing his cantorial robes at all official functions. The other cantors, who performed parts of the service that Sulzer delegated and led weekday and youth services, were instructed always to use Sulzer's melodies. "Variations and innovations are strictly for- bidden," the board told one cantor. All of the cantors had to observe Jewish law in public, lead a moral and religious life corresponding to their position, and refrain from public musical performances. Indeed the board cautioned the cantors against even visiting places which did not befit their religious profession, presumably gambling houses, nightclubs, or even bordellos(?). Temple singers had to make sure the choir boys behaved properly during services and rehearsals and had clean clothes.42 1258/1-4; Protokolle: Sitzungen des Bethaus-Vorstandes 1851, 1852, 1853-57, 1858, 1859, 1860, CAHJP, AW 1259/1-6. 39.

ROZENBLIT Viena's Jewish leaders undoubtedly felt that they had an image to main- tain when they insisted that their cantors and singers lead a moral life. Accordingly, they enforced their rules even when it was difficult to do so. In June of 1830, for example, they fired one of the singers for "immoral activi- ties."43 In 1861 they admonished Cantor Goldstein for performing in coffee- houses, even though he clearly needed the extra money; in 1867 they rebuked Cantor Adolf Fischer for playing cards in coffeehouses instead of leading weekly evening services; and in 1868 they suspended Cantor Joseph Goldstein for three months for his "transgressions."44 The most painful instance of such discipline involved Julius Sulzer, the son of the universally beloved Cantor Salomon Sulzer. Under pressure from the elder Sulzer, who originally wanted his son to be a cantor in the new synagogue in the Leopoldstadt, the board had hired Julius to be choir director in 1859, but complaints about mismanaged funds, missed rehearsals, tardiness, abusing the choir boys, and taunting the cantors forced the board to reprimand him repeatedly and then, in 1862, to fire him.45 In order to maintain the dignified image of Viennese Jewry, the men who administered Jewish religious affairs tried to eliminate private synagogues. With the exception of the Polish synagogue, which they allowed out of respect for supposedly different Polish melodies for the prayers, and syna- gogues established by Jews living far from the center of Jewish life in the Inner City and Leopoldstadt, the temple board repeatedly turned down most requests to establish private synagogues. The board harassed illegal private services, reporting them to the police and confiscating their prayer- books.46 Kantor Matyas Matyas; Instruktionen fiir die beim Bethause in der Leopoldstadt angestellten Tenoristen und Bassisten, 1860 in CAHJP, AW 1227.

Before the Revolution of 1848 Viennese Jews experienced no change in their legal status. The government refused to allow a formal Jewish community in the capital, and it continued to tolerate only a small number of wealthy merchants in the city. Thus, while the number of illegal residents augmented the Jewish population to somewhere between two and four thousand, Viennese Jewry remained the same as in the 1820s.47 The wealthy merchants remained satisfied with the beautiful, digni- fied Vienna Rite, and no core of traditionalists had arrived to challenge the status quo. Austrian political realities also explain why a second generation of Europeanized Jews clamoring for further reform did not arise in Vienna as in other German cities. In the 1840s the Austrian government did not relax its opposition to Reform as some German governments did in that period.48 Moreover, the impossibility of emancipation in Vormarz Vienna rendered irrelevant any desire to remove prayers for Zion in the hopes of winning emancipation. Viennese Jews were not yet called upon to evince any Austrian patriotism. At this time Austria consisted of a patchwork of feudal holdings of the Habsburg crown, and its German, Czech, Hungarian, Polish, and South Slav residents may have shared a common allegiance to the emperor, but not any sense of common nationality. In a state with many nationalities, languages, and religions, the idea of Jewish peoplehood- especially one symbolically comprehended-presented fewer problems than elsewhere. Political context, rather than religious environment, therefore serves as a better explanation for the development of Reform in Vienna. The fact that the disputes in this synagogue on Lazzenhof.

ROZENBLIT Vienna was a Catholic city, and Reform generally did not take root in Catholic environments, does not explain the Viennese situation.49 In the first place, Reform often struck deep roots in the Catholic regions of what would later be the German Reich. Secondly, Viennese reformers had always looked to German Protestant models even though they resided in a Catholic city. Living in the German-speaking part of the Reich, and subjects of a German prince, modernizing Viennese Jews had adopted German culture. Just as acculturating Jews in other German cities looked to Protestant models even though they might not have lived among Protestants, so too did the Jews of Vienna. Within "Germany" broadly defined, the status of Jewish emancipation rather than the religious environment explains the success or failure of Reform.5so The opening of a second communal temple in the Leopoldstadt in 1858 did not prompt Vienna's Jewish leaders to make any changes in the style of worship to which they had grown accustomed. Having built the new syna- gogue to meet the needs of a Jewish population which finally began to expand in the 1850s, the leaders of the Israelitische Kultusgemeinde (Jewish religious community), which received official recognition in 1852, saw no reason to make services in the new, free-standing, Moorish-style synagogue any more or any less traditional than those in the Stadttempel. Some mem- bers of the temple board did want to introduce a few changes like the elimin- ation of Misheberakhs (blessings for those receiving synagogue honors), but the majority decided that the same customs would prevail in the new temple as in the old."5 From its inception, however, the Leopoldstadt Temple revealed the reli- gious tensions brewing in Vienna: the incipient conflict between a newly arrived traditionalist population and a group of reformers. Many of those who attended services in the new temple were recent immigrants from the 49. Ibid., p. 149, credits the absence of ideological Reform in Vienna to two basic factors: the lack of any reason to feel the patriotic attachment of citizens and the Catholic environment of the city. Meyer overstates the Catholic dimension. If Catholicism inhibits Reform, as in France, why then were Viennese Jews so quick to adopt aesthetic reforms? 50.Meyer acknowledges (pp. 143-144) that partial emancipation was one of the factors that propelled German Jews toward ideological Reform, but he does not give this factor sufficient weight in his analysis. 51. 17 June 1858, 24 June 1858, Bethaus-Vorstand Protokolle 1858, CAHJP, AW 1259/4; IKG to Bethaus-Vorstand, 18 June 1858, Akten des Bethausvorstandes, 1851-81, AW 1264/2.</page><page sequence="21">STRUGGLE OVER RELIGIOUS REFORM 199 provinces and were therefore more accustomed to traditional Jewish wor- ship patterns than to the dignified style of services at the Stadttempel. In order to ensure a high level of decorum in the new temple, the leaders of the community in 1864 issued an extremely detailed set of rules in German, printing them in Hebrew letters so that Jews not yet used to Gothic char- acters could read them. This set of rules informed Vienna's Jews that they must not stomp around in the synagogue or talk at all during services. They were to pray in a soft voice, remain in their seats during services, not sing along with the cantor except for the prescribed communal prayers, and not offer corrections to the person reading the Torah. Those who received syna- gogue honors had to wear a top hat. Since Vienna's synagogues maintained Jewish tradition, however, synagogue attendees were instructed not to wear leather shoes on Yom Kippur and Tisha b'Av. Finally, congregants were informed of the amount they had to donate to the synagogue when they received synagogue honors.52 At the same time, the new synagogue provided those who wanted to reform the Vienna Rite with an opportunity to press for their goals. During the planning stages, some Jews demanded an organ, but Mannheimer vetoed such proposals.53 A year after the new synagogue opened, some of its "functionaries" again lobbied for an organ. They argued that organ music would enhance communal singing and that "the permissibility of an organ in the synagogue needed no further discussion." Rejecting halachic impedi- ments to synagogue music, they urged Vienna to follow the model estab- lished by other religious communities.54 The temple board ignored the request. In all likelihood, the request came from the man that the leaders of the Jewish community had hired to preach at the Leopoldstadt Temple, Adolf Jellinek. Jellinek, a man of outstanding oratorical ability, belonged to the second generation of European Reform rabbis. Born in 1821 in a small town near the Moravian city of Ungarisch Brod, Jellinek had received a tradition- al talmudic and a modern university education. He dedicated his career in Vienna to preaching, publicizing the virtues of Judaism, and writing many 52. "Verwaltungsregeln und Verordnungen," 1864, CAHJP, AW 1760/1. 53.

ROZENBLIT scholarly books, especially on Jewish mysticism and rabbinics.55 When he first came to Vienna, Jellinek agitated for liturgical change, and the men who administered the synagogues repeatedly had to remind him to abide by the traditions already established in Vienna.56 Hiring a Reform rabbi was a Viennese tradition, however, and the Jewish elite probably hoped that Jel- linek would maintain the status quo. On the other hand, when Mannheimer died in 1865 and Jellinek moved to the Stadttempel, the Gemeinde (the Jewish community) replaced him at the Leopoldstadt Temple with Rabbi Moritz Giidemann, a modern rabbi of decidedly conservative views.57' The Controversy over Reform, 1870-72 The movement to introduce substantive liturgical changes in the two communal synagogues in Vienna gained momentum only after the Austrian government emancipated the Jews in 1867. In the wake of emancipation, some Viennese Jews felt compelled to remove prayers from the liturgy which seemed to contradict their newly won political equality. If the Jews were Austrian citizens, they argued, then surely they must no longer pray for a return to Zion. To continue to do so now would be a lie. Unlike during the 1840s, some Austrian Jews now sought to join the larger German Reform movement, which was also reactivated in response to emancipation at this time. Politically the time was ripe for Jewish religious reform.58 55. Moses Rosenmann, Dr. Adolf Jellinek; Sein Leben und Schaffen (Vienna: J. Schlesinger, 1931).

In his analysis of renewed Reform activity in the 1860s and 1870s in Germany, Meyer, pp. 181-191, does not sufficiently emphasize that this activity took place within the context of final emancipation. Instead, he argues that Reform triumphed because religious liberals had become the majority and took control of communal boards. In Vienna, however, reformers consciously reacted to emancipation, but their reforms did not triumph despite liberal control of the Gemeinde board. Meyer does acknowledge (p. 193), however, the importance of emanci- pation as an impetus to further reform in Vienna in 1870.</page><page sequence="23">STRUGGLE OVER RELIGIOUS REFORM 201 In February 1870 the subcommittee of the Israelitische Kultusgemeinde board now in charge of religious affairs voted to accept in principle most of the decisions of the 1869 Leipzig Synod, a conference of lay and rabbinic eaders attended by six Viennese Jews. The committee proposed that Vien- nese Jews recite the Amidah only once in each part of the service on Sab- baths and holidays and replace the Torah reading on the afternoon of Yom Kippur, traditionally part of A chare Mot (Leviticus 18) dealing with various kinds of abominations, with the first part of Kedoshim (Leviticus 19), deal- ing with holiness. It also recommended that the prayer for the government be rewritten to reflect Jewish emancipation. Most important from the point of view of ideological change, the committee decided to replace prayers which "request the restoration of animal sacrifices and return to Jerusalem" with prayers about the mission of Israel, Jewish universalism, and the one- ness of God. Finally, despite opposition to an organ as recently as Decem- ber 1869, the committee decided to introduce one into each temple. The Vienna reformers, however, did not accept the Leipzig guidelines in their entirety, generally opting for a more conservative direction when they dif- fered. Thus, the committee urged that the Haftarah remain in Hebrew, even though Leipzig had suggested the vernacular, and that Vienna retain the prayers for rain and dew, deemed unnecessary at Leipzig. This greater con- servatism did not reflect a traditional ideology. The members of the com- mittee probably decided to keep the prayers for rain and dew simply because they liked the way Cantor Sulzer sang them. The committee also recom- mended the retention of the one-year Torah-reading cycle, but in order to shorten the time devoted to Torah reading on the Sabbath, it wanted to divide the weekly portion into four parts, with only one part read on Sab- bath morning, and the other three on Sabbath afternoon and Monday and Thursday mornings.59 The members of the board of the Israelitische Kultusgemeinde recog- nized that they faced very serious opposition and thus delayed 59. 2 February, 7 February 1870, I.

ROZENBLIT doing anything about the committee's proposals for a year. They feared the opposition of Rabbi Giidemann, the seatholders at the Leopoldstadt Temple, and the Jewish community at large. Thus, toying with the idea of introducing the reforms only at the Stadttempel, where Jellinek preached, they avoided consulting the preachers and rejected the idea of a communal referendum.60 Finally, at two spirited public meetings on 22 January and 5 February 1871, the Gemeinde board decided to accept the committee's sug- gestions. Nevertheless, nervous about its decision to remove the prayers for Zion and sacrifices, it postponed implementing the changes until the sub- committee of the Leipzig Synod itself could prepare the proper substitute prayers. Moreover, the Gemeinde board shied away from actually introduc- ing the organ that it deemed "a good idea" (empfehlenswerth), deciding instead to seek advice on the issue.6' The Gemeinde never introduced the more radical of the 1871 reforms. For the next year and a half the opponents of religious reform waged a spirited fight on behalf of Jewish tradition, forcing the Gemeinde to back down from its position. Vocal and organized opposition to substantive litur- gical reform came from three disparate groups: the members of the Schiff- schul, a traditional private synagogue composed largely of Jews from Hungary headed by Salomon Spitzer and located on Grosse Schiffsgasse in the Leopoldstadt; a group of very wealthy Viennese Jews who probably did not observe all of Jewish law but who wanted to hold fast to Viennese syna- gogue traditions as formulated by Mannheimer; and Rabbi Moritz Giude- mann and presumably those who agreed with his vision of modern tradition- al Judaism. On 28 January 1871, immediately after the first of the two meetings which approved the reforms, hundreds of people gathered at the Schiffschul to register a formal protest in the name of rabbinic Judaism.62 Parallel to the efforts of these avowedly observant Jews, a group of 427 apparently wealthy 60. 12 July, 1 December 1870, 29 January 1871, I.

Born in Hildesheim, Germany, in 1835, Giidemann had been a member of the first class at the conservative Jewish Theological Seminary, established in Breslau in 1854 by Zacharias Frankel. A man with a thorough knowledge of Talmud and a Ph.D. in Semitic languages, he published several scholarly books, including a history of Jewish education in the Mid- dle Ages. Throughout his fifty-two-year career in Vienna (1866-1918), Giidemann considered himself a man of "conservative inclinations" in Judaism, much more observant than other leaders of the Jewish com- munity.64 Despite his modern education, Giidemann felt comfortable with Vienna's Orthodox community. He had genuine affection for Rabbi Lazar Horwitz, the man who supervised kashrut in Vienna until his death in 1868, and Horwitz apparently approved of Giidemann's appointment in the capi- tal. Giidemann also claimed to have excellent relations with Salomon Spitzer of the Schiffschul, at least before the events of 1871/72, and Spitzer taught him such practical rabbinics as kosher meat supervision. In his memoirs Giidemann called Spitzer "Orthodox from purest water, but with- out any fanaticism."'65 Moreover, despite initial opposition, Spitzer and Reuben Baruch, leader of the Sephardi Jews (the Turkish Gemeinde), accepted Gfidemann as head of the Vienna rabbinical court when the board of the Gemeinde permanently appointed him to that position in 1869.66 63. 29 March 1871, I.

ROZENBLIT Giidemann even performed weddings at the Schiffschul "according to ancient custom," including breaking a glass. In May 1869, the Gemeinde board admonished him for not conducting weddings there using "the same ceremonies . . . as are prescribed for the two temples."''67 Giidemann responded forcefully to the proposed reforms of 1871. On 11 February and 18 March he refused aliyot offered to him.68 More signifi- cantly, on Saturday, 18 March 1871, Giidemann delivered a scathing sermon attacking the newly approved reforms, which he subsequently pub- lished as Jerusalem, Sacrifices, and the Organ. In his sermon Giidemann rejected both the reforms and the logic behind them. He began by attacking the notion that prayers for a return to Jerusalem cast aspersions on Jewish patriotism. Not only did Jews always fight loyally for their countries, but the most Orthodox Jews in Austria-Hungary had been the most obsequious in their attachment to the regime. Moreover, to pray for a return to Zion had nothing at all to do with actually going to Palestine and building a state, nothing to do with "a political putsch and the play of government minis- ters," nothing to do with immigration and cultivation of the land. No, Giidemann argued, prayers for Jerusalem served only as a symbol of Jewish messianic hopes and expectations. Despite their connection to a specific land, prayers for Zion in fact expressed Jewish hopes for the ennoblement and elevation of all mankind under God. Thus he argued: "I recognize in this request for personal return to Jerusalem nothing which contradicts an educated consciousness; I recognize in it, moreover, one of the most beauti- ful, most sublime, and most fertile ideas of Judaism."69 Giidemann argued less coherently against the elimination of prayers for the restoration of sacrifice. Ignoring the argument that it offended modern sensibilities, Giidemann reminded his congregation that sacrifice played a central role in Christian liturgy as well. More importantly, the rabbi empha- sized that sacrifice was central to the religious constitution of ancient Israel, As expressed in the Book of Leviticus. To eliminate prayers for sacrifice dance with the wishes of his teacher Zacharias Frankel, Giidemann always wanted to combine traditional rabbinic functions with modern preaching. 67. 25 May 1869, I.

Giidemann insisted that prayers for sacrifice be retained because they reminded Jews of their glorious past and messianic future.70 Finally, Giidemann addressed himself to the issue of the organ. Admit- ting that Jewish tradition did not expressly forbid synagogue music on the Sabbath, he argued that the prohibition against organ music derived from the very essence of Judaism itself. Judaism was clear, simple, and accessible. An organ, he insisted, would provide an obscure, Christian-like atmos- phere. With its deafening and intoxicating noise, the organ would inflict the terror of the Last Judgment and the ecstasy of Mary worship on impression- able women and children. "Jewish worship and an organ are a misalliance," Giidemann insisted, that could lead to the demise of Judaism.7' He ended his impassioned plea against Reform by praying for unity and peace in the community. The proponents of Reform expressed their indignation at all of these protests. Die Neuzeit, Vienna's liberal Jewish newspaper, asked what right the Orthodox, who never even set foot in the Gemeinde temples, had to decide how the city's modern Jews should pray. The Gemeinde, after all, had allowed the Orthodox to create their own synagogues where they prayed as they liked, and it was immoral of them to interfere with the freedom of con- science of those Jews who honestly felt that to pray for Zion was a lie. Such Orthodox protest, Die Neuzeit claimed, "was merely an act of arrogance and impudence native to this kind of uneducated Jew."72 Die Neuzeit lambasted the Orthodox protesters repeatedly during 1871, but it denounced even more vigorously the wealthy Jews who had petitioned against Reform. "The Godless Orthodoxy of a few rich Jews" disturbed editor Simon Szint6 more than the opposition of the Orthodox. He charged that these wealthy financiers had no interest in Judaism, did not even know what they were signing, considered Mannheimer to be the last word in 70. Ibid., pp. 11-13. 71.

Die Neuzeit was a liberal Jewish newspaper published weekly in Vienna between 1861 and 1903. Edited by Simon Szint6, a Jewish educator and publicist, Die Neuzeit tirelessly advocated religious reform and denounced Jewish Orthodoxy.

ROZENBLIT Jewish liturgy in a thoroughly un-Jewish manner, and, worst of all, sup- ported the "maintainance of lies and therefore of blasphemy in worship." Moreover, Szint6 feared that these plutocrats were merely aping Austria's nobility by adopting a reactionary religious position. Convinced that the future of Judaism lay in liberalism, both in Austrian politics and in the syna- gogue, Die Neuzeit denounced those who tried to combine political liber- alism with religious romanticism. Their adherence to old forms forced them to pray hypocritically for a return to Jerusalem when they had no intention of leaving their palaces on the Ringstrasse. Simon Szint6 also suspected that an "influential coterie of great capitalists" opposed progress only because it could no longer dominate Jewish affairs. He urged the board of the Ge- meinde to uphold morality and true religion.73 Szint6 reserved his nastiest language for Giidemann himself. Although favorably disposed to the Breslau graduate when he first arrived in Vienna in 1866, Szint6 soon attacked Giidemann indirectly by castigating "Breslau bigotry" for failing to embrace Reform when it practiced modern scholar- ship.74 After Giidemann's 18 March 1871 sermon, Die Neuzeit angrily de- nounced it for its lies, distortions, ignorance, hypocrisy, Jesuitism, and fool- ishness. With his terrible German style and with many logical lapses, Szint6 charged, Giidemann had merely revealed his confused and cranky mind. It would be best if he abandoned the pulpit, "for which, after all, he possesses no talent," and studied Judaism.75 Viennese Jewish leaders tried to implement only one reform in 1871. At the behest of Emanuel Biach, a member of the Bethaus- Verwaltung and a reformer who had participated in the Leipzig Synod, the temple board announced in September that it would substitute Kedoshim for A chare Mot as the Mincha Torah reading on Yom Kippur. Such a substitution never occurred. The Gemeinde's president, Baron Jonas von Konigswarter, an 73.

At an electoral meeting at the end of November, traditionalists challenged the right of the Gemeinde board to reform the service and threatened the destruction of the Viennese Jewish community if the board introduced the reforms. Proponents of Reform argued, incorrectly, that Mannheimer's innovations represented a far more thoroughgoing reformation of Judaism than the present changes, that Mannheimer himself would have favored more reforms, and that the board should not compromise its convictions for the sake of communal peace.77 For its part, Die Neuzeit, which sought more reform than Mann- heimer could have sanctioned, denounced those who believed that "the blessed preacher Isak Noa Mannheimer, [who was] born in Copenhagen on 17 October 1792 and died in Vienna on 18 March 1865, was the first and last legitimate reformer of Judaism, that with him authority commenced, and with him it was buried forever."'78 Neither side won a clear victory at the 26 November elections.79 Events in Vienna had reached an impasse when Jonas Baron von K6nigswarter, the traditionalist president of the Gemeinde, died in late December 1871. The new president, liberal politician Ignatz Kuranda, favored Reform. In a speech intended to placate both reformers and tradi- tionalists, he announced his desire to implement reforms without violating either freedom of conscience (i.e., the beliefs of the reformers) or communal peace. Die Neuzeit eagerly hoped that he would act in accordance with his own convictions.80 Rabbi Giidemann, on the other hand, remembered that tears fell from his eyes when he heard Kuranda speak against prayers which expressed Jewish longing for Jerusalem.8' 76. 20 September, 27 September, 17 October 1871, Bethaus- Verwaltung Protokolle 1861-71, CAHJP, AW 1260/1.

On 14 January 1872, the sub- committee on religious affairs proposed a set of "modifications" to the liturgy. The committee suggested that on weekdays, Sabbaths, and holidays, except for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, the cantor would recite only the first three benedictions of the Amidah, and the congregation could say the remainder of the prayer silently. In the prayer Ahavah Rabbah, the cantor would begin with the words Ki El poel yishuot atah; in the blessings after the Haftarah, he would not recite the lines from Magen David through Samchenu; in the announcement of the New Moon, he would begin with the actual formula announcing the new month; and in the Priestly Blessing he would begin with the word Kohanim. On Mondays and Thursdays, the cantor would not recite Adonai elohai yisrael shuv maycharon apecha and the Yehi ratzon. Finally, on Yom Kippur the cantor would not recite the Al-Het list of sins out loud, and the Mincha Torah reading would be Leviticus 19:1-23 (Kedoshim) instead of Leviticus 18 (A chare Mot). As for the organ, it was still "under advisement."82 Two weeks later, on 28 January, the Gemeinde board accepted these compromise suggestions with the exception of the proposed changes in the blessings after the Haftarah, and informed the cantors, preachers, and synagogue administrators to implement the modifications immediately.83 These modifications reflect a carefully considered compromise. The Gemeinde would not have to lose face by repudiating in principle its desire for Reform. Moreover, the cantor would never recite out loud the prayers about the return of the Jews to Zion and the restoration of the Davidic monarchy and the ancient sacrificial system. Those who wanted to pray for such things could still do so during the silent prayers, which would remain in their original form in the prayerbook. Those who opposed such prayers would not have to hear them as part of the communal liturgy, except of 82. "Vorschlfige der ersten Section auf Grund der vom Vorstande in den Sitzungen vom 22.

Everyone-or no one-would be satisfied.84 Despite initial annoyance at the need to compromise with the tradition- alists, Die Neuzeit seemed satisfied with the modifications. Readers who considered prayers for Zion a lie would no longer have to lie in public about their true loyalties.85 Rabbi Giidemann, after a feeble attempt to resign his position, and some unsuccessful efforts to keep the daily service more tradi- tional, also came to terms with the board's decisions because he saw in them no reform of fundamental Jewish principles.86 Most Jews in Vienna proba- bly made their peace with the official compromise. One group of Viennese Jews, however, refused to approve the new modi- fications. The members of the Schiffschul, led by Salomon Spitzer, waged a vigorous campaign in 1872 to force the Gemeinde board to desist from changing the liturgy. In order to pressure the Jewish leaders they applied to the Austrian authorities for permission to secede from the Jewish com- munity and create a separate Orthodox Gemeinde in Vienna. Immediately after the 28 January decisions, Spitzer resigned his position as supervisor of kosher slaughter. At a meeting at the Schiffschul he declared all who abided by the board's decisions to be apostates, idolators, and transgressors of Jewish law, and anyone who paid taxes to a Gemeinde that made such decisions to be cursed and damned. He asked his supporters to secede from the Gemeinde and declare it idolatrous, and they in turn organized a sub- scription to underwrite the schism he urged.87 In the weeks and months that followed, Spitzer and his followers presented repeated protest petitions, signed by approximately three hundred men, to the Gemeinde threatening 84.

ROZENBLIT schism and nonpayment of taxes if the board actually implemented the modifications.88 Spitzer and his followers used politically sophisticated arguments when they presented their request for secession to the Austrian authorities. In addition to arguing (incorrectly) that no law prohibited more than one Jewish community in a city, they asserted that the present Gemeinde denied the very foundation of Judaism and thus threatened its own existence as a Jewish community. More importantly, the Schiffschul members appealed to Austrian liberalism and religious freedom to respect their right not to belong to a church whose principles they did not share. Finally, the pro- testers used economic arguments. They complained to the authorities that they had been paying taxes to the Gemeinde to support preachers, cantors, choirs, and religious teachers in temples they never used, while they still had to build and maintain Orthodox synagogues and schools at their own expense and pay a fee for use of the mikveh. True, the Gemeinde did support the rabbinate, and Orthodox Jews could receive communal charity, but most Jewish charity came from private sources, and Orthodox taxpayers were not getting their money's worth.89 Not content with mobilizing Viennese Jews to protest the changes in the Vienna Rite, Spitzer also obtained the backing of 389 Austrian, Hungarian, and German rabbis for his proposed secesion from the Gemeinde. In his introduction to the published version of this "international" petition, Spitzer presented his view of events in Vienna. Even before K6nigswarter was cold in his grave, the ignorant and arrogant "un-Jewish" leaders of the Jewish community had foisted a set of reforms on Vienna, reforms based on the travesties of the Leipzig and Augsburg Synods, and had turned the syna- gogue into a "reform-pagan temple," declaring themselves renegades and apostates from Judaism. Thus, from a religious point of view, no Jew loyal to Jewish law and tradition (gesetztreu) was allowed "to remain with such individuals in one and the same religious community." To do so would con- stitute tacit approval of the blasphemous reforms. The only honorable 88. Die Neuzeit, 12 April 1872, pp. 172-173; 3 May 1872, pp. 203-205; 26 July 1872, pp. 337-338. 89.

Further, the elimina- tion or the omission of the ritually established recitation of the prayers which mention these promises involves apostasy from Judaism, and therefore, a Torah-true Jew may not and cannot remain in the same religious community with people who are guilty of such apostasy. According to Jewish teaching, it is forbidden to pay taxes to a religious community whose representatives make decisions which deny divine promises and whose institutions do not stand on the unchangeable basis of the religious law codified in the Shulchan Aruch.9' Spitzer had asked ten of the rabbis to write specific opinions, and they basically reiterated the contentions of the petition itself. Esriel Hilde- sheimer, for example, one of the leaders of Orthodoxy in Germany and a man who had served as rabbi in nearby Eisenstadt, Hungary, until 1869, wrote that not reciting prayers about the return to Zion and sacrifices was akin to denying the traditional principles of the Jewish faith. Torah-true Jews could not remain in or pay taxes to a community which denied Jewish tradition and rejected the Shulchan Aruch.92 One rabbi, Dr. Lipschitz from Maros-Vasarhely in Transylvania, a leader of Orthodox Jewry in Hungary, went beyond the relatively restrained language of the protest to denounce the actions of the Vienna Gemeinde as "a crime which cries out to heaven" and "an act of flagrant terrorism toward our consciences."93 Such heated protests made Vienna's Jewish leaders very nervous. For their part, they appealed to the authorities to maintain Jewish communal unity and not allow Spitzer and his followers to secede. In a long letter to the 90. Ibid., pp. 3-14. 91.

ROZENBLIT administration of Lower Austria, the Gemeinde leaders rejected the Ortho- dox contention that the modifications represented a break with Jewish tradi- tion or derived from any dogmatic differences between themselves and the Orthodox. On the contrary, the 1872 compromise made no change at all in the text of any prayer. Sensitive to those who had protested the 1871 reforms, and committed to communal peace and unity, the Gemeinde's leaders had abandoned the ideological reforms of 1871. Now they only sought to create a situation in which those who felt that it would be a lie to pray for Zion could avoid saying those prayers out loud. This compromise was possible because of the very nature of Jewish worship, in which the cantor only had to recite the beginning and end of each prayer.94 The Austrian government refused to allow Vienna's Orthodox Jews to secede and form a separate community. Austrian law only permitted one Jewish Gemeinde in each city, and the Orthodox could have created an autonomous community only if they obtained parliamentary recognition of their status as a separate religion. Not even Spitzer and his followers favored such a course of action. The authorities also recognized that Orthodox rights had not been violated in Vienna.95 Unlike the Hungarian government, which in 1871 had allowed the Jews to form separate Orthodox and Reform communities, or the Prussian government, which in 1876 allowed Jews to secede from their communities if they wished, the Austrians insisted on Jewish unity. Such insistence forced the Orthodox to make their peace with the fact that services in the communal temples would be conducted in one way while they prayed as they wished in the Schiffschul or other privately supported Orthodox synagogues which the Gemeinde permitted after 1868.96 These events raise important questions: What was the source of the vigorous opposition to religious reform in Vienna in the early 1870s, and 94.

Since the liberal Austrian authorities could be counted on to forbid the secession of the Orthodox, why did Jewish community leaders feel compelled to make a compromise with the forces of tradition? The answers to these questions must be found in the significant demographic transformation of the Viennese Jewish com- munity by 1870. After the government lifted the restrictions on Jewish settle- ment in the capital in 1848, tens of thousands of Jews streamed to Vienna, creating a large reservoir of people who came from traditional Jewish back- grounds and preferred traditional worship. Only about 4,000 Jews lived in the city in 1848, but by 1869, 40,230 Jews resided in the Austrian capital.97 Jewish leaders felt compelled to satisfy their demands. Observers have long commented that traditionalist immigrants impeded Reform in Vienna.98 What they have overlooked or underemphasized, however, is that the majority of the Jews who arrived in Vienna in the 1850s and 1860s came from traditional Jewish communities in nearby Hungary. To be sure, Hungarians always constituted a significant group among Vien- nese Jews. About 35 percent of Vienna's Jews in the last decades before 1848 had been born in Hungary, and 41 percent of those who signed the temple statutes in 1829 came from there.99 In the two decades after 1848, the percentage of Hungarians increased. In 1850, 33 percent of the fathers of Jewish children born in Vienna came from Hungary. By 1860 38 percent came from Hungary, and by 1869, 42 percent were Hungarian. Similarly, in 1860 44 percent of the Jewish men and 38 percent of the Jewish women marrying in Vienna had been born in Hungary. By 1870 the figures had risen to 53 percent and 47 percent respectively. By 1870, of course, such propor- tions meant a very large number of Hungarian Jews in Vienna. Over 70 per- cent of these Hungarians came from western Hungary and western Slovakia. The vast majority came from towns that boasted two thousand to ten thousand inhabitants and contained sizable Jewish minorities.'00 97. Jeiteles, pp. 40-42; Low, pp. 161-163; k.-k.

An extremely high proportion of them came from Pressburg or small towns nearby Pressburg's famous yeshiva and rabbis provided aggres- sive leadership within Hungary for spirited opposition to religious modern- ization. Pressburg boasted the famous Chatam Sofer, Rabbi Moses Schrei- ber, who a generation earlier had led the fight against Jewish modernity. His sons, sons-in-law, and grandsons continued to lead the opposition to Reform.'0' In Vienna about 30 percent of the Hungarians in the sample populations under study here came from Pressburg or the small towns in its immediate vicinity. Another large contingent came from the Burgenland district of western Hungary, from the so-called seven communities, which persisted in strong religious traditionalism down to their dissolution in 1938.102 Of course, to credit all Jewish immigrants from Hungary with vigorous opposition to Reform is to practice historical and geographical determin- ism. Certainly not every Hungarian Jew in Vienna opposed Reform, nor did all Jews in the capital born in Bohemia, Moravia, or even in Vienna favor religious innovations. Simon Szint6, the editor of Die Neuzeit, tirelessly championed Reform despite his Hungarian origins, and Emanuel Biach, a leader of the reformist forces on the Gemeinde board, hailed from Pressburg itself.'03 Moreover, given the Viennese Jewish demographics, a sizable pro- portion of those who favored religious reforms must have been born in Hun- gary. Indeed, Hungary itself had a Reform movement, although its strength did not lie in the areas from which most of the Hungarian Jews in Vienna came. Moreover, not all of the opponents of Reform in Vienna were Hung- arian immigrants. Baron Moritz von K6nigswarter, who led the 1871 protest, had probably been born in Vienna, but his father, Baron Jonas, who and marriages in those years. The records indicated the place of origin of fathers, mothers, brides, and grooms. See also Marsha L.

Still, the sheer presence in Vienna of so many Jews from vibrant and traditional Jewish communities in Hungary not only provided a very real reservoir of support for Jewish traditionalism, it also served to intimidate the Gemeinde leaders, who feared the successful mobilization of the Hungarian Jews. What they feared was a Hungarian secession from the Gemeinde. Hungarian Jews already had a history of fomenting schisms in Vienna. In the 1850s, Ignatz Deutsch, a money changer from Pressburg, nearly succeeded in convincing the authorities of the need to create a separate Orthodox community. In many memoranda to the government, Deutsch emphasized the loyalty of Orthodox Jews to the reactionary regime and the potential revolutionary leanings of the religious liberals who headed the Jewish community. Denying that Jews sought political emancipation, he requested that Graf Thun, the minister of religion and education, recognize the Orthodox as a separate community. Thun was sympathetic, but Schmer- ling, the liberal minister who succeeded him in 1860, refused all such requests.'05 The growth in the number of Hungarian Jews in Vienna in the following decade, however, made the Gemeinde leaders fear that the sepa- ratists might succeed in the future. The success of aggressive Orthodoxy within the Kingdom of Hungary itself augmented this fear. Hungarian traditionalists had a long history of lobbying against the introduction of Vienna-style synagogues and for the creation of separate Orthodox Jewish communities.'06 Rabbi Hillel Lichten- stein of Szikszo, for example, publicly condemned those who read German books, especially the writings of Moses Mendelssohn. He also attacked rabbis who gave sermons in German and all Jews who attended services in a Chortempel.'07 In 1865 a group of Hungarian rabbis meeting in Nagy Mihaly, a small town in northeastern Hungary where many Hasidim lived, 104.

ROZENBLIT issued a legal judgment against any change in Jewish custom, and specifical- ly forbidding most of the stylistic innovations introduced by modern syna- gogues. Not content with merely outlawing German sermons, indoor weddings, and the like, the rabbis strictly forbade observant Jews from setting foot in synagogues which adopted modern architectural styles, moved the bima to the front, removed the latticework from the women's gallery, and garbed their preacher and cantor in clerical robes.'08 Two years later, Hungarian traditionalists successfully derailed the Hungarian Jewish Congress and ultimately forced the Hungarian government to recognize the legitimacy of separate Orthodox and Neolog (Reform) communities in Hun- gary. Leading this campaign was the Schomrei Hadath ("guardians of the faith") organization, which, despite the extreme traditionalism of its members, employed modern political tactics to opposeJewish moderni- zation.'09 Vienna's Jewish liberals themselves perceived that it was the Hungarians in Vienna-goaded on by Hungarians across the border-who formed the vanguard of the opposition to Reform in the capital. Die Neuzeit regularly denounced the Hungarian Jews in Vienna, especially those from Pressburg, as the chief villains in the affair. To be sure, other Orthodox groups existed in Vienna, but the Polish, Moravian, and Turkish Jews who conducted separ- ate services did not interfere with worship at the Gemeinde temples. Only the Hungarians, Szint6 argued, had the nerve to dictate religious affairs for all Jews. Only they had the temerity to seek a schism within the Jewish com- munity of Vienna. Die Neuzeit's antipathy to the Hungarian Jews in Vienna long predated the 1871/72 Reform struggle. Throughout the 1860s, the liberal newspaper suspected the Hungarians of trying to create a separate Orthodox Gemeinde, and it repeatedly asserted that Vienna's Israelitische Kultusgemeinde was already Orthodox."0 Szint6 reserved his strongest language for Pressburg and the agents of Pressburg's "spiteful Orthodoxy" in Vienna.

Die Neuzeit eagerly covered the Congress, at first nervous at what the Orthodox might do, then angry at what the Orthodox had done, and finally relieved that Hungarian liberals were free of Orthodox protesters and could reform Judaism in peace. 110.

Their ostentatious, tendentious, hypocritical, and intolerant religiosity, he insisted, reflected only their ignor- ance of the Talmud and their desire for power within the Jewish world. Jews from Pressburg lusted after a Jewish episcopate and an inquisition to root out the Reform heresy. In Vienna they spied on Gemeinde leaders and plot- ted to dominate all Jewish religious institutions. Partisans of the dead letter of the law, these Jews made demands which were not even found in the Shulchan Aruch: the restoration of piyyutim, unmusical singing, and ser- mons in Jargon (Yiddish). After all, Die Neuzeit argued, Jews in Hungary and Hungarian Jews in Vienna followed the same battle plan. The Ge- meinde's leaders must be wary of Hungarian separatism."' Throughout this period the liberal newspaper praised Polish Jews for their loyalty to the Gemeinde. Hostile to Hasidism in Poland itself, Die Neuzeit commended Polish Jews in Vienna, ensconced in their own private synagogue on the Ankergasse in the Leopoldstadt, for minding their own business and not seeking a separate Jewish community. Polish Jews thus were honorable because they did not make common cause with the separa- tist Hungarians."2 Sephardi Jews, who also had their own synagogue, equally merited praise."3 Finally, the "German-Orthodox," a group of Moravian traditionalists who prayed together at Schonlaterngasse, also escaped the scorn of Simon Szint6 and his newspaper. Indeed, he frequently praised their leader, German-born (if Pressburg-trained) Rabbi Lazar Horwitz, for his great learning, his worthy and dignified character, and for the fact that he did not interfere with services at the temples.

ROZENBLIT To be sure, none of these groups posed a demographic threat to the Viennese Jewish leaders in the 1860s. The Polish Jewish community in Vienna was small. Although masses of very traditional Jews from Galicia would flood into Vienna at the turn of the century, only 10 percent of the fathers of Jewish children born in 1869 came from that Polish/Ruthenian province of Austria. Moreover, in contrast to the later Galician immi- grants, most of whom were poor, these early Galician Jews in Vienna were relatively prosperous, able to pay their taxes to the Gemeinde and send their sons to Gymnasium in proportion to their numbers in the population."5 The Sephardi community in Vienna, consisting of subjects of the Ottoman Empire, was extremely small, numbering only 85 or 143 families (depending on the source) in 1869.116 Moravian Jews formed a more substantial part of the Viennese Jewish community, about 13 percent of the Jewish fathers in 1869,"77 but most Moravian Jews in Vienna did not affiliate with the Schon- laterngasse synagogue. During the Reform controversy of 1871/72, Die Neuzeit vehemently blamed the Hungarian Jews-in Vienna and in Hungary itself-for instigat- ing all the trouble. Describing the first protest meeting at the Schiffschul on 28 January 1871, for example, the paper declared that most of those attend- ing came from Vienna's Hungarian "suburbs," especially Pressburg, drag- ging with them to Vienna their native quarrelsomeness and their desire for communal schism."8 In a series of articles in March, the newspaper de- nounced the "Pressburg diaspora" for its arrogance, fanaticism, and lack of education, and wondered why it had not protested the Vienna Rite for the past forty years."9 After the Gemeinde adopted the 1872 "modifications," Die Neuzeit blamed the zealots from Pressburg, acting under orders from Pressburg itself, for forcing the compromise. Honorable Polish and Moravian Ortho- dox Jews minded their own business, the paper declared, but "Pressburger- dom cannot be restrained or at least tamed by the civilized world." The newspaper attributed Salomon Spitzer's refusal to recognize his ignorance in areas beyond kosher meat inspection to the fact that he was from Pressburg, 115.

The Viennese Jewish community, Szint6 con- cluded, would be better off if the Pressburgers seceded from the community, allowing progressive views to triumph. After all, who needs fanatics who say "The Shulchan Aruch is our God and Salomon Spitzer is his prophet"?'20 Die Neuzeit also blamed the Hungarians for the secession campaign. Hot-headed Hungarians, Pressburg liars, lunatics, fanatics, and war- mongers only wanted "to drag Transleithanian barbarism into the intelli- gent Residenz at any price." Szint6 charged that the only difference between these Jews and their mentors, the Schomre Hadath in Hungary, was that the Vienna contingent had not declared itself a new religion worshipping the Shulchan Aruch. Despite its initially positive view of schism, the liberal newspaper opposed the secession of the Hungarian Jews. Worried that one schism would lead to many more, it was relieved when the government ren- dered it impossible.'2' The opposition of Vienna's liberal Jewish establishment to schism undoubtedly derived from its fear that secession would result in a loss of tax revenue. None of Die Neuzeit's extremely nasty polemics against the Hun- garian Orthodox ever indicated that these men were impoverished. The liberal newspaper did charge that only one hundred of the three hundred people who signed Spitzer's protest in 1872 actually paid taxes to the Israeli- tische Kultusgemeinde. If that was the case, however, then Schiffschul members enjoyed a somewhat higher level of prosperity than most Viennese Jews. In 1870 only twenty-three hundred Jews out of a total Jewish popula- tion of forty thousand could afford to pay taxes to the Gemeinde. Although women, children, and even men under thirty were not counted as taxpayers, less than 29 percent of the eligible Jewish men in Vienna paid taxes to their community.'22 Separatist Orthodoxy in Vienna was apparently not the preserve of the poor, any more than in Hamburg or Frankfurt.'23 120.

ROZENBLIT Vienna's Jewish leaders refrained from introducing reforms in 1871/72 because they feared alienating two important components of the com- munity: the masses of Hungarians who might be mobilized by Spitzer and the Schiffschul, and the wealthy financiers who had protested reforms in 1871. Although the latter did not join the Schiffschul in requesting a schism in 1872, their support for Viennese Jewish tradition discouraged Jewish leaders from changing the Vienna Rite. The specter of the Hungarians made such change impossible. In the years after the controversy of 1871/72, the men who controlled Jewish religious life in the capital resumed their ordinary tasks: admonishing the cantors and choir boys for unacceptable behavior, contracting for matzah or repairs to the ritual bath, regulating private religious services, and building new communal synagogues to accommodate the growing Jewish population of the city.124 Jacob Fleissig, the rabbi who replaced Spitzer on the rabbinical court, attended to practical rabbinics. Although also a student of Moses Sofer in Pressburg, Fleissig did not interfere with worship in the temples and thus met with the approval of the city's Jewish leaders.125 The only further attempt to introduce reforms into Vienna came from Vienna's cantors in the early 1870s. In February 1873, Cantor Goldstein of the Leopoldstadt Temple asked the Bethaus Verwaltung for a new phys- harmonica, a kind of small organ, to use during the choir practice, hoping for its "eventual use during services." Although the board bought the new instrument, it ignored Goldstein's concern for musical accompaniment dur- ing services and reiterated its opposition to any change in services. 26 Simi- larly, Cantor Sulzer at the Stadttempel, a partisan of the organ at Leipzig in 1869 and in Vienna in 1871, repeatedly voiced his desire for an organ to facilitate congregational participation and create a more beautiful service.

They could not afford such an overt symbol of Reform in their temples. Vienna had reached the limits of its tolerance for Reform. Indeed, by rejecting the organ, and not really removing prayers for Zion, Vienna had placed itself outside of the Reform movement as it had crystallized by the early 1870s. Vienna remained at the point of modernization it had achieved in the 1820s because of the enormous demographic transformation it had experienced. Migration into the capital created a reservoir of traditionalists which now could mobilize to curtail the desires of those who sought Jewish religious accommodation with European values. The presence in the city of so many traditional Hungarian Jews-and their potential for creating a schism in the community-had deterred the city's liberal Jewish elite from introducing ideological reforms into the communal synagogues. Fortunate- ly for the elite, they already had established an aestheticized, modernized worship service for which they felt no embarrassment. For Vienna's Jewish leaders the demographic realities of one period made it possible to compromise with the demographic realities of a later period. The attitude of the government and the composition of the com- munity had made possible early religious modernization in Vienna. The same forces stymied ideological reform in the 1870s. Indeed, further demo- graphic and cultural change prompted the leaders of the community to return to saying prayers for Zion out loud in the early twentieth century. As Rabbi Giidemann noted, "now Zion had become modern once again.'"28 Demographic forces and new notions of "modern" and "traditional" worked together to forge a synagogue style acceptable to the majority. Undoubtedly these forces were also at work in other Central European cities. University of Maryland College Park, Md. 127.
