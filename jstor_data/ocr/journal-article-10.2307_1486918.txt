<plain_text><page sequence="1">Avrom Saltman. The Jewish Question in 1655: Studies in Prynne "Demur- rer ". Ramat Gan: Bar Ilan University Press, 1995. 284 pp. William Prynne, distinguished lawyer, publicist, and the irascible, testy seventeenth-century Keeper of the Records, heaped learned vituperation upon his real or imagined foes. He attacked Jews and Papists with equal abandon, as well as Jesuits, Quakers, Levellers, Archbishop Laud, Cromwell, and stage plays. He also managed to publish more than 200 books and pamphlets during his lengthy, troubled, and tempestuous life. In 1656, he published a fervent plea against the readmission of the Jews to England, a two-part work entitled: A Short Demurrer to the Jewes long discontinued Remitter into England. Comprising an exact chronological relation of their first admission into, their ill deportment, misdemeanors, condition, sufferings, oppressions, slaughters, plunders, by popular insurrections and</page><page sequence="2">274 BOOK REVIEWS regal exactions in; and their total, final banishment by judgement and edict of Parliament, out of England, never to return again, etc. This, like many of Prynne's works, has earned a reputation as a great repository of chancery miscellanea, from which medievalists and others quarry documents unknown, ignored, or forgotten. And yet, Prynne has been acknowledged as the father of medieval Anglo-Jewish historiography, and not solely by gentile historians. Avrom Saltman's study of Prynne is a valuable and learned book. He uncovers layer upon layer of materials relating to Anglo-Jewish history in his study. He begins with a short introduction, followed by a synopsis of the Demurrer, and in a chapter devoted to Prynne's marginal sources he displays the materials available to this seventeenth-century scholar. A summary of Prynne's views on politics and religious issues associated with the argument over admission of the Jews to England completes the narrative section of the book. More than half of the volume is devoted to a painstaking and scrupulous study of the sources from the Public Records, some 360 of them, numbered and assigned to the reigns of John, Henry III, Edward I, and Edward III. This is not merely a listing of documents, but texts with valuable and helpful commentaries, an embarras de richesses. Prynne's chief contributions to Anglo-Jewish history, according to Salt- man, consist in the following achievements. Prynne advocated the view, adopted by more recent scholars, that Jews first came to England from Rouen at some date very soon after the Norman Conquest. After first holding a different position, he came to understand that "the presbiterate of the Jews of England" was in fact a secular, not a religious, office, and the head of the presbiterate represented the community at the Exchequer, especially in matters of taxation. The dating of the Statute de Judaismo was assigned by Prynne to 1275, rather than 1290. His greatest contribution was his full or partial publication of hundreds of documents, mainly thirteenth-century sources, from the Public Records, many of which have yet to be published elsewhere. Prynne's opposition to the readmission of the Jews was grounded in English law, Scripture, and economic reasons. Many laws of England, he said, including the laws against coin-clipping, usury, extortion, fraud, and deceit, made it undesirable to admit the Jews; he adduced a series of texts from the New Testament that could be interpreted as barring readmission; and pace Menasseh ben Israel's economic arguments in favor of the Jews, he warned that divine punishment would be incurred if they were readmitted,</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 275 for as St. Peter said to Simon Magus, "Thy money perish with thee." Saltman locates Prynne's opposition to the Jews and the venom he spews against others firmly in the context of seventeenth-century scholarship. The ideas underlying his antisemitism, as well as the influence of Protestant and Catholic antisemitic literature, are presented and analyzed. This is an important and erudite study of a remarkable figure representative of his age and world. It will be of great interest to students of Anglo-Jewish history and English history in general, and to those who are intrigued by the debate over the admission of the Jews to England, and what that debate tells of the larger issue of the Jews and their place, or lack of one, in Western European history and culture.
