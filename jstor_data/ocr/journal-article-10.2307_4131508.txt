Only with the renewal of the homeland and Hebrew independence have we been able to re- assess the Bible in its true, full light," Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben- Gurion, wrote in 1953.1 This statement illustrates several core attitudes of the Jewish national renaissance movement towards the Bible. Ben-Gurion depicted a direct relationship between the state of the Jewish people and the status of the Bible: The two rose and fell together. His words are reminiscent of philosopher Martin Buber, Revisionist leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky, and others, all of whom postu- lated a symbiotic relationship between the Jewish people and the land of Israel: "Just as the Jewish people need the land to live a full life, so the land needs the Jewish people to be complete" wrote Buber.2 The Bible, according to Ben-Guri- on, was the third component of the Jewish "holy trinity" of people, land, and book. It served as testimony of Jewish national life in the land of Israel in former times, as a blueprint for reestablishing this way of life, as proof of a glorious past and promise for the future. It nurtured a national romanticism and both inspired and buttressed universal ideas; it was the bedrock of myth and epos, of earthliness and valor, and also of a system of ethics and faith that rein in and restrain muscle and brawn. It was paradoxical proof of both Jewish uniqueness and Jewish similitude, "like all the nations" (I Samuel 8:5); "materialism" and "spirituality"; historical continuity and historical severance between the people and the land. For almost a century, the Bible was the identity-defining text of the Jewish society emerging in the land of Israel. The young Hebrew culture was molded in its light. The modern Hebrew language absorbed its idioms and epigrams, images and associations, just as English did Shakespeare's, and Russian, Pushkin's. Since the 1970s, however, the Bible has been losing ground as the ultimate identity text. Its rise and fall as the hallmark of Israel's canonical identity is the subject of this article. Complex and multifaceted, the subject can obviously not be exhausted by * I would like to thank Boaz Levtov for his help in collecting material for this article.

Certain aspects, perforce, will receive only scant attention. My sources are mostly studies and articles in the press of the period. My assessments are based on the impressions of contemporaries rather than on statistical data. Ben-Gurion cited two books as having greatly influenced him in his youth: Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom 's Cabin3 and Abraham Mapu's Ahavat Ziyyon [Love of Zion].4 The former, he said, had kindled his loathing for slavery and bondage; the latter had breathed life into biblical tales, sharpening his yearning for Zion.5 Mapu's books reflected the connection between the renewed interest in the Bible and Jewish Enlightenment (Haskalah) literature. Written in biblical lan- guage, they created a new, secular idiom and invented a Jewish past that vied with romantic, non-Jewish epic narratives for the hearts of young Jews. The Bible's role in creating a laic Hebrew language and in Enlightenment trends seeking to trans- form the image of Jews and the functioning of the Jewish collective, was typical of a whole slew of writers who wrapped their messages in biblical tales and im- ages: In his poem, "Zidkiyahu Be- Veit Ha-Pekudot" [Zedekiah in Prison],6 Judah Leib Gordon fiercely attacked Jeremiah the Prophet and offered a counterview of state administration that was guided by secular-political rather than Jewish-reli- gious considerations. David Frischmann's desert tales on Israelite wanderings, Ba- Midbar, 7 strongly rebelled against establishment Jewry, "reinstating," so to speak, the vibrant anarchy of the tribes of Israel prior to their acceptance of the Torah. Micha Yosef Berdyczewski exposed the Bible's hidden paganism to present a raw vitality that had allegedly been suppressed by Torah Judaism. His biblical protag- onists did evil in the eyes of the Lord, and the culture he presented brimmed with vigor and heroism, basic instincts and desires.8 Under Nietzsche's influence, writ- ers and poets of the vitalist school exalted ancient Jewish civilization as it had been before it donned the fetters of phylacteries: Saul Tchernichowsky, the most promi- nent figure of this school, felt the blood of Canaan's conquerors coursing through his veins and conjured up the vision of the prophet of Astarte, deposed from the altar by monotheistic Judaism.9 Describing the encounter at En Dor between King Saul and the prophet, Samuel, he crowned Saul in valor and patriotism while cast- ing Samuel as the sullen agent of a jealous, vengeful God.'0 The new Hebrew literature sought to free Jewish life of the restrictions of re- ligion. Ahad Ha-Am ("one of the people," pseudonym of Asher Zvi Ginsberg) of- fered a new definition of a Jew: "I may treat the beliefs and opinions passed down to me by my forefathers as I see fit, without fear that this will cut me off from my 3.

In other words, one could be a national Jew, true to one's people, and not observe the Torah and commandments. This was a revolution in the definition of Jewish identity. In this new definition, the Bible played a key role: it was the bridge between past and present. For those who did not accept the authority of the Oral Law, the Bible offered a new genealogy that made it possible, as Uriel Simon put it "to observe 'national commandments' while shedding religious ones."'12 Every national movement requires a genealogy. Consequently, it attempts to re- trieve from oblivion a mythological past, a golden age when the nation was formed and its attributes forged, a primordial moment that lends the people the legitima- cy to demand from the family of nations its own place in the sun. The Bible en- dowed the young Jewish nationalism with a mythological-historical foundation to consolidate its distinctiveness around its ancestral land, serving as evidence of the "naturalness" of the Zionist solution to the Jewish problem. The Return to Zion of the Persian era took on current relevance and was reapplied to the same landscape and for the same people. Zionism seemed to be recapturing and reconstructing the drama that unfolded in the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah. The "ingathering of the exiles," a biblical concept with messianic connotations, was conceived as a cur- rent, historical process translated into practice in the early years of statehood. The difficulties of the immigrants in finding their place in the evolving Yishuv (Pales- tine's pre-state Jewish community), the character faults displayed by both indi- viduals and society, were explained in terms of the biblical epos of the "desert generation" that saw the land from afar but was not allowed to enter it. Hayyim Nahman Bialik's poems, "Metei Midbar" [The Dead of the Desert' 3] and "Metei Midbar Ha-Akhronim"'4 [The Last Dead of the Desert] invoked this well-known image while giving poetic voice to the sense that only the generation born into free- dom would "inherit" the land. The founding fathers envisaged themselves devot- ing their lives to the creation of a Jewish state, though they themselves would not live to see their dream realized. When poetess Rahel (Bluwstein) spoke of"Ish U- Nevo Lo" [To Each his Mt. Nebo] she struck a major chord with members of that generation.'5 The Zionist movement's nation-building endeavor grasped at bibli- cal concepts in order to lay out a historical process that was not novel, but, rather, a second, recurring round in a historical drama that was thousands of years old. As opposed to the traditional Jewish outlook, which posits a linear historical progres- sion towards redemption, Zionism offered a cyclical view of the drama of sover- eignty, destruction, and redemption.

Zionism, on the other hand, adopted the Bible as the founding tale of a people with a glorious past in their own land, and the great spiritual edifice that they had erected there and bestowed on the entire world. The Jews, before they had a country of their own, conjured up a land that was the focus of their desire, what Ahad Ha-Am called a "book memory."16 "Our patriotism sprang from the Book, clung to the verses, the historical names. We loved an abstract homeland and we sowed this love within ourselves through- out generations, carrying it from place to place. This abstract patriotism became a formidable dynamic force," said Labor leader Berl Katznelson.'7 The power that Katznelson attributed to the Bible down the ages seems to have been a projection onto earlier generations of a dynamic process that took place in his own, but nev- ertheless, the point is that when the Jewish national movement made its debut, the Bible was there, a ready resource for its legitimacy and genealogy. Thus the Bible's transition at the end of the nineteenth century from a cultural lodestone of the En- lightenment renaissance to the foundation stone of the new Hebrew culture and emerging national consciousness happened almost imperceptibly. The move from the Diaspora to Palestine marked a watershed: What in the Diaspora had been an imposing text, stirring longing and firing the imagination, in Palestine became a vital link between the Jewish people and the land. The bib- lical landscape was no longer literary fancy, as had been the case, for example, with Mapu's Ahavat Ziyyon.18 It was a definite setting bound up with the names of sites, events, and people. Mountains and hills, valleys and riverbeds suddenly took on real life. Members of the Second Aliyah (immigration wave, 1904-1918) "discovered" the biblical scenery. Following his trip to Galilee during his first year in the country, Berl Katznelson wrote to his sister: "Can words convey the essence of rocks, eternal rocks and breakers of the sea? Timeless hills, a ribbon of a moun- tain trail and a cascading spring? Or mountain air and valley beauty? Or the essence of 'dawn spread over the hills'?" The encounter between the Russian-born newcomer and the biblical landscape was intoxicating.19 In contrast, Moshe Dayan, born in Palestine, related to the landscape differently. For him it was no "book memory," but a physical reality: "The Sharon lily and Mt. Carmel were as real as could be, a fragrant flower, a mountain, whose tracks I trod."20 Jewish tradition accorded the Bible an inferior position to that of the Tal- mud-the Oral Law. The Enlightenment elevated the Bible as part of the return to ancient sources. The revival of the Hebrew language, the study of Hebrew gram- mar, and the study of the Bible were all elements that the young national move- 16.

The selection process was part of the secularization of tradition. That which in the past had been considered an indivisible religious-spiritual world, binding by divine authority, was now decon- structed. Some of its components were deemed suitable for a lay, national culture; others were considered extraneous. When the Gymnasia Ivrit opened in Jaffa and became the first high school to introduce Hebrew as the language of instruction in all subjects, essayist and critic Zalman Epstein hailed the daring policy a quantum leap in the inculcation of the language. But, at the same time, he protested against the new institution's educational trend: True, the Bible had been awarded suitable prominence in the curriculum, but not so the Talmud; it had been pushed aside, al- lotted a mere hour a week. It was not enough for pupils to study Hebrew and even Bible, he argued, "educated Jews had to be grounded in Torah in the traditional sense, as had been the case since antiquity."21 Epstein was highly conscious of the picking and choosing that had gone into molding the new, unfolding culture: Any- thing that could serve secular nationalism had been retained, anything with a dom- inant religious-traditional streak had been obscured and blurred. He complained that the Hanukkah festival was celebrated with fanfare, whereas Shavuot, which commemorated the giving of the Torah, was ignored. The temporal valor of Judah Maccabee, Simeon Bar Giora, and Bar Kochba was eulogized; but the sense of sanc- tity, of communion with God the Creator of heaven and earth, was eliminated. Bible instruction at the Hebrew high school prompted the question of its def- inition: was it the Law of Moses, handed down on Mt. Sinai, or was it simply a na- tional-cultural text? Epstein feared that it would be taught according to the methods of Julius Wellhausen, who had developed a lay approach of biblical criticism that stripped it of all sanctity and placed in on an equal footing with other man-made works that could be criticized and emended.22 His concern was justified. Educa- tor Benzion Mossinson, the Bible teacher, did indeed plan to teach it on the basis of modern biblical criticism. In their enthusiasm to pass the Bible onto the younger generation in its pristine splendor, before it had been diluted by reams of com- mentary, Mossinson and his colleagues eagerly embraced the recommendations of Protestant scholars, who had rearranged the internal division of the Books and rec- ommended the relocation of idioms and verses. Bible teaching was no longer an introduction to Talmud, nor a means of instilling reverence for a hallowed, time- honored text pervaded by divine presence; it served an entirely different purpose: "The Bible should present pupils with the whole of the life of our people in their land, awaken in the small Hebrews a strong love for this life and a great ambition to restore our people to days of yore. This is the educational goal of all Bible study."23 Juxtaposed with the captivating life of ancient Jewry in their own land, the life of the Diaspora will stand out in all its wretchedness, and the young and tender will learn to prefer the former condition over "the gloom of foreign soil."24 21.

Furthermore, a deeper question follows : To whom does the text belong? Both sides of the religious-secular divide sought to appropriate it. The disagreement over biblical criticism concerned not only the text's sanctity, but also the mode of analysis and style of commentary ap- plied. Traditional exegesis had dressed the biblical text in meanings and explana- tions aimed at adapting it to changing historical realities without changing the written word itself. It was swathed in layers of aggada (lore) and halakha (law) lending it historical depth, the fruit of Jewish religious, social, and cultural cre- ativity over the long centuries since its "sealing." The literal text had disappeared under mantles of traditional hermeneutics. Secular Zionism called for the beauty of the original text to be bared, for it to be interpreted at face value (pshat), that is, literally.25 This bias was apparently connected with the renaissance of the He- brew language and the revival of its grammar; as long as the grammar and lan- guage had remained the province of a select few scholars, homiletic exposition had often been a matter of free association, irrespective of philology and context. Pshat, literalism, was consistent with Zionism's self-image as a movement of re- birth, regaining its ancient origins. An additional disagreement concerned the relationship between the Diaspo- ra and Palestine. Mossinson's comment about the young preferring the beauty of Jewish life in the ancestral home to the gloom of foreign soil contained the grain of an important Zionist concept, the "negation of Exile," which was meant to boost the image of Palestine at the expense of the Diaspora. The young Zionist move- ment feared the Diaspora's gravitational pull. In order to establish a viable Jewish home in Palestine, it had to counter the possible impact of this force on potential emigration candidates. Simultaneously, it also had to ward off the attraction of the Diaspora for the generation being raised in Palestine. Bible instruction was to serve as a crucial ingredient in the consolidation of a new, young, daring nation that would derive its vitality and inspiration not from contemporary Jewish society, which, for the most part, lived in the Diaspora, but from the glorious past of the First Temple period as portrayed in the pages of the Bible. Ahad Ha-Am, the pathfinder of the Jewish national persona, found little gratification in the biblical criticism at the Hebrew high school or its tendency to "negate Exile." Although he did not consecrate the Bible as holy or regard it as di- vine revelation, he viewed it as a work that had been sanctified for generations by the Jewish people and, as such, reflected the spirit of that people. He did not rule out biblical criticism-unintelligible formulations could be emended. But the procedure called for caution, because it interfered with a cultural tissue built up through the ages, an integral part of Jewry's cultural baggage. By the same token, he warned against the inclination to blot out from the Jewish past anything that had been created in the Diaspora: "Out of excessive zeal to cleanse children's spirit of 25.

It contained in embryonic form topics that would occupy center stage in the public discourse on the Bible and its position in the emerging Hebrew culture. The tension between the religious and secular ap- proaches-the Bible as the divine word or as a "national narrative" (according to Uriel Simon's definition); its literal interpretation as against the exegesis of the Oral Law; its essence as literature or as history; and, finally, the Bible as the cor- nerstone of the new Hebrew identity-all these were already implicit in this early discussion.27 Born and bred in traditional homes, Second Aliyah immigrants felt a strong bond to the Bible. They retained, after shedding religion, an intimate knowledge of Judaism and its way of life and mindset. Labor leader Yitzhak Tabenkin noted that most of the young pioneers of that period had Bibles in their rooms.28 It was their bridge between the land they had imagined and the land they found upon their arrival, helping them to overcome alienation and to feel at home. They would roam about the country, identifying sites, plants, and animals on the basis of biblical de- scriptions. The Bible spanned the centuries, creating a sense of direct continuity between the nation's forefathers and the present-day descendants trying to reestab- lish a foothold in the land. When poetess Rahel wrote of Matriarch Rachel "for her blood in my own does course," she was embracing the ancient myth and endowing it with current meaning on both the national and personal levels.29 This myth had nothing to do with holy places-Rachel's Tomb was not a Second Aliyah pilgrim- age site; it had to do with a sense of belonging to the land to which they had come. They referred to the land simply as "aretz"-country-rather than as "home- land" (moledet). God had said to Abraham, "Get thee out of thy country, and from thy homeland and from thy father's house" (Genesis 12:1). According to the as- cending significance in the formulation of a biblical threesome ("Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest" [Genesis 22:2]), "country" rates less inti- macy than either "homeland" or "father's house."'30 It was "the Country," near and far, at one and the same time: the Country above all others, to which one ascends (aliyah) and from which one descends (yerida); the Holy Land, the promised land. It was both abstract and concrete. The term "homeland" was adopted only by the 26. Ahad Ha-Am, op cit. See also "Torah Mi-Zion" [Torah from Zion], ibid., pp. 128-129. 27.

The transition from "country" (aretz) to "homeland" (moledet) symbolized the transition from a land that is a "book memory" to a native land (erez-moledet), and from the immigrant generation to the native-born. Second Aliyah immigrants were not comfortable with the notion of "ances- tral right": a country is not won by virtue of divine promise, of God's Covenant with Abraham (Genesis 15:19). The idea was at variance with their secular world- view. Their Zionism stemmed first and foremost from the perception that in a world divided into nations; the Jewish collectivity had no future unless it adopted the na- tional model. The national enterprise, however, would demand so much emotion- al strength, sapping every last bit of energy, that if there were any chance at all of these being mobilized, it was for the one place that was historically and powerful- ly bound up with the Jewish people. Berl Katznelson, Joseph Hayyim Brenner, and Aharon David Gordon all cast about for extra-biblical justification for the bond between the Jewish people and the land of Israel. They did not ignore the histori- cal connection, but they based their claim to the country mostly on the present and the future: If the Jewish people proved their capability as a colonizing nation, they would have a country. The Bible provided the Second Aliyah with the emotional tie to the country, but did not bestow the right to it. This right was to be won by sweat and toil. "The land will belong to the camp that is able to endure more for it and to cultivate it," said Labor thinker A. D. Gordon.31 Though they looked to the Bible, Second Aliyah immigrants, on the whole, steered clear of its lofty rhetoric. When Brenner spoke of the guardsman of "Jez- reel ... who on Israel's fields did fall, where our prophets and heroes have walked since time immemorial,"32 it was to parody the groundless extravagance of a Zion- ist functionary delivering a eulogy. The flowery biblical register grated against the grim rigors of everyday living conditions, and Second Aliyah immigrants seem to have shunned it for fear of pretentiousness. For the same reason, Brenner rejected also Ahad Ha-Am's call to establish in Palestine a model Jewish society, as befit the "chosen people." Ahad Ha-Am held that it behooved an ancient people who had given the world the "book of all books" and who had suffered so much in the course of their history to build no ordinary society, not "just another Balkan state."33 He and his disciples understood the idea of a chosen people as demand- ing moral excellence of the Jewish entity that was to rise in the land of Israel. Otherwise, a different verse might well come to characterize it: "but when ye entered, ye defiled My land" (Jeremiah 2:7). Biblical verses lent an intellectu- al, historical footing to Ahad Ha-Am's secular definitions of the nature of the Jew- ish people and his stipulations for the nature of the emergent nation.34 However, 31.

These two models, of a "chosen people" and "like all the nations," furnished yet another battlefield for the "spiritual" versus the "earthly" currents of Zionism. Both sides were able to enlist the Bible: the one to show that the Jewish people had always been unique; the other to show the "natu- ralness" of national life in one's ancient land, a course that had been upset by ex- ile.35 The use of the biblical idiom packaged both positions in primacy and legitimacy. Moreover, the terminology, which was deeply ingrained in the gradu- ates of traditional heders (religious schools), served as convenient shorthand for any position, encapsulating lengthy, complex arguments in a single phrase. The strong scriptural influence on Second Aliyah members was apparent also in their attempt to "judaize" socialism and arrogate it to the Bible. Even so- cialists who chose the path of world revolution outside of the Jewish context un- derstood the aspiration for justice and socioeconomic equality as the non-Jewish, secular version of the traditional Jewish concept of universal reform (tikkun olam). To them, it was a logical extension of their schooling in the Bible, so much so that it was considered almost a Jewish quality. Thinkers such as A. S. Lieberman and Nahman Syrkin saw the Bible as an early format of socialism as evidenced by the idea of the jubilee; of leaving the land fallow and a portion of the crop for the poor (Leviticus 19:9);36 the preachings of Amos, Hosea, and Jeremiah; the trial of Naboth of Jezreel. All of these were perceived as evidence of a value system in- spired by ideas of social justice and concern for the less fortunate, and all were part of the Second Aliyah's emotional makeup. A. D. Gordon, who vehemently refused to acknowledge any connection between his thinking and socialism, based his be- hest for social justice on the Bible. Berl Katznelson, who recognized the connec- tion between the Jewish labor movement in Palestine and international socialism, nevertheless saw the Bible as the source from which Jewish youth imbibed "the philosophy of humanity, mankind's vision of the future."37 The representation of biblical laws as an early quasi-version of socialism made it easier to introduce these ideas to the Jewish public and couched them in Jewish legitimacy; at the same time, it kept the Bible "kosher" also for socialist Jewish "heretics" who could thus continue to indulge their love of it. For Zionist socialists, the Bible was a vibrant bond to a universal value system. This was the era of Marxism: Champions of Marxism measured themselves and the world in its light, while (total or partial) opponents also had to be well-versed in it to counter The Bible contains the expression, "Thy people which Thou hast chosen, (I Kings, 3:8).

Marxist dogma framed the public discourse for decades and could not be ignored. One of the sources of its attraction was its hubris of holding out universal solutions for all the world's ills. Whereas nationalism was seen as provincial and particularistic, somewhere between tribal egoism and chauvinist fa- naticism, socialism offered a springboard to a lofty universe in which all men are created equal. The Bible made it possible to combine the Zionist particularism of the Second Aliyah pioneers with their yearning for the reign of universal justice. Alongside the epos on the birth of a nation, the Bible also raised the notions of the end of days, world peace and a just dominion among peoples. Its universal ideas were not restricted to the vision of the end of days, but associated with a value sys- tem that defined good and evil, relations between the strong and the weak, between ruler and subject. In an ideological epoch in which systems of faith played a ma- jor role in molding both one's spiritual world and society, the Bible, laden with ide- ological messages, became one of the foci of identity. The desire to insert the Bible into the socialist worldview, and, on the other hand, the secular tendency to glean from it pertinent elements, led to what I term "moderating the pshat" (or curbing literalism). Thus, although secular Hebrew high schools chose the path of literal and philological interpretation, this did not prevent teachers from adding their own outlooks. At Kibbutz En Harod, for exam- ple, care was taken to distinguish between the story of Creation and science. The story of the Patriarchs was broken down into different components; some were pre- sented as historical, others as ancient legend.38 The critical approach to the text made it possible to accept certain portions of the Bible and reject others. Accounts of cruelty, for instance, such as Samuel's behavior towards Agag, King of Amalek, or David's towards the peoples he conquered, or Elijah's towards the prophets of Baal, as well as such precepts as "an eye for an eye," were explained as common customs of the times that had no place in modern society. Traditional commentary may have been repudiated, but every child was nevertheless told that the Sages had interpreted "an eye for an eye" to mean "money" that is, ransom rather than cor- poral punishment. The idea of the "chosen people" also received a moderating qualification: It did not mean that the Jewish people were superior to others, rather, they were chosen to fulfill additional obligations, to excel in lofty ideals and moral virtues. Teachers struggled to deal directly and honestly with the wrongs com- mitted by the nation's greats as recounted in the tales of the Bible; how could they reconcile a child's evolving admiration for a biblical hero given the violations perpetrated by that figure (e.g., Jacob's theft of the birthright; the episode of David and Bathsheba)? Some tried to gloss over the incidents, others emphasized the punishment of the wrongdoers (Jacob's tribulations, the uprisings against David) so as not to offend the children's natural sense of justice.39 The secular approach, in any case, which made it possible to select and stress episodes on the basis of de- 38.

On the eve of the Second World War, educator S. D. Goitein summed up the contemporary main approaches to Bible teaching in secular high schools: as na- tional literature, just as other nations study their classics, imbibing both language and values; as an introduction to the "scent of Israeli soil"-identification with the homeland; as a prologue to Eastern lifestyles (Bedouin culture as a model of Patri- arch life); as early national history harkening back to sovereign national life; as a means of imparting historical categories: did the kingdom of Judah fall because of sinfulness or geopolitical factors?; and, finally, as a channel to world literature, be- cause the Bible was universally accepted and esteemed. He devoted half of the ar- ticle to the goals and secular character of this form of Bible teaching. The other half dealt with its inherent pitfalls, which stemmed from the attempt to ignore the reli- gious character of scripture: "Teachers must be aware that Bible teaching which conceals-let alone, denigrates-religious principles, is a distortion," argued the religiously-observant Goitein.40 Most of the teachers and pupils, however, were sec- ular and, for them, the Bible was a national epos and book of ethics, a guidebook to the byways of Palestine and to early Hebrew history-and no more than that.41 During the discussions around the 1937 Peel Commission's proposal to par- tition Palestine into two states-Jewish and Arab-the parties involved, particu- larly its opponents, brought up the historical connection to regions mentioned in the Bible. In the main, however, the talks were of a political, pragmatic ilk, rather than a mystical, religious one. In youth movements, the influence of the Bible found evident expression in the use of its terminology-choice quotes on the Jew- ish people's right to the land of Israel granted historical depth to the youngsters' innate sense of ownership. Their patriotism stemmed more from the close en- counter with the country's fields and open expanses than to the Bible.42 Beyond the biblical substance they picked up directly in class, they were affected by the spir- it of the times and the growing Jewish-Arab tensions over the land. Literature and song incorporated biblical elements and no doubt also played a part. Rahel's pop- ular poetry resonated with a biblical cadence and contained both overt and latent scriptural allusions. Tchernichowsky was another favorite. Unlike Rahel's minor tone, however, Tchernichowsky's poetry was in the grand style, turbulent, sweep- 40. S. D.

Aharon Megged, of the '48 generation, said of himself and his peers, all of whom were sec- ular, that they used biblical verses and epigrams in their speech and addresses. "The Bible was learned and read in the country not as a religious book, but as a literary work of genius, as a linguistic treasure filled with gems, as a historical source, as a geographic and archeological guidebook, as a fount of wis- dom, as a clarion call to idealism and social justice. From the first and in retrospect-as forging the bond between the people and their ancestral land, the cradle of their civilization."

As opposed to the Matriarch's blood that coursed through the poetess's veins, Tchernichowsky felt the blood of the con- querors of Canaan raging joyously through his own. And while she says, "I have not sung to thee, my land, nor revered your name in feats of valor,"43 Tcherni- chowsky has no qualms about extolling the earthiness and manliness of the new "generation in the land."" The younger generation's admiration of King Saul owed more to his poem, Be-Ein Dor [At En-Dor]45 than to the scriptural tale. As for Bia- lik, though his poetry and also his stories (Va-Yehi Ha-Yom [And there Came the Day])46 were certainly appreciated, their cultural presence was less arresting than Tchernikowsky's work: Le-Nokhah Pessel Apollo [Facing Apollo's Statue]47; Ha- zon Nevi Ha-Ashera [the Vision of the Prophet of Astarte]48; Manggina Li [I Have a Tune]49; Ani Maamin [I Believeso]. Among biblical novels, Ze'ev Jabotinsky's Shimshon [Samson] (192751) occupied pride of place. Written with great verve, it emphasized a number of messages: First, the protagonist was the most physical of all biblical heroes, stripped of all spiritual dimension, even though he was a Na- zarite consecrated to God. Second, Samson's dealings with the Philistines were marked by a love/hate relationship, free of the alienation that usually colored Jew- ish/non-Jewish interaction. Third, Samson's legacy to the Jews was: appoint a king, make iron, and learn to laugh. Jabotinsky "secularized" the biblical story, removed its supernatural elements, added secondary characters and episodes absent from the original, and situated it in the struggle for sovereignty in the country. This launched a tradition of historical novels, written by Revisionists and right-wingers under his inspiration. Most of these failed, but some of the novels aimed at youth cast a strong spell: the trilogy, Akhsah Bat Calev [Akhsah, Caleb's Daughter52], Ehud ben Gera [Ehud, Son of Gera],53 and Ha- Yated or Eshet Hever [Yael's Stake or Heber's Wife54] by Israel Scheff was patterned after Henryk Sienkiewicz's Pol- ish novel, With Fire and Sword.55 Scheff was followed by M.Z. Wolfovsky, Zvi Livne, and Yaacov Hurgin, who wished to underscore national pride and worship of the past. Wolfovsky focused on Jeremiah and his times;56 Livne, on the Return to Zion in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah,57 and Hurgin, on the era of the King- 43.

Just as With Fire and Sword60 inspired generations of young Poles, so these books wove their magic on the youngsters of Palestine, awakening a thirst for heroic exploits, adventure, and romantic attachments in the very best tradition of the genre. In a period when read- ing was the chief cultural pastime, form of entertainment, and means of learning about the world, these historical novels gained wide currency and were compelling. Through them, the Bible was popularized and reduced to the everyday cultural-po- litical level. The past was concretized, so to speak. Biblical elements that defied concretization, such as God's presence, lofty rhetoric, or succinct descriptiveness were omitted from the historical novel: the past was made immediate, attainable, earthly, and utterly non-transcendental. The process of concretization was intensified after the establishment of the State of Israel. Independence and the 1948 war, the conquest of extensive areas of the country, and mass immigration were all perceived as the realization of scrip- tural substance: The past became an active ingredient of the present. Ben-Gurion, who prior to statehood had hardly ever mentioned the Bible, now, as soon as the war was over, adopted a new vocabulary.61 During Sukkot of 1950, at the sixth conference of the "Hebrew Society for the Exploration of the Land of Israel and its Antiquities," Ben-Gurion delivered a speech that contained the seeds of thoughts he was to develop in the coming years. His usually vigorous, crisp, emphatic rhetoric gave way to a new style, heavy with biblical phrasing adapted to current affairs. For example, "We shall not dwell in security so long as 'nation shall lift up sword against nation' and man shall rule his neighbor."62 Here, for the first time, he unfurled the historical narrative of a small people and its age-long struggle for independence, absorbing influences from other peoples yet retaining its unique- ness, a concept that he was to elaborate in the Fifties, in a long article. "Yihud Ve- Ye'ud" [Uniqueness and Destiny].63 Here, he first elevated the Bible to the chief intellectual focus of the young state: "Not in those wanderings was our image fash- 58.

In this homeland, the Hebrew nation was born, grew up and crystallized, and here it created its eternal testament ... the book of books. In the future, the national enterprise and education will rest on these two [pillars]: the land and the book."64 The juxtaposition of the land of Israel with the Diaspora, implying that nothing had been created in the Diaspora, was concomitant with the Bible's exal- tation as a single and singular canonical text-the nation's spiritual base, equal in value to the land, its physical base. "Like the land," Ben-Gurion noted, "the Book opens up only to those rooted in the soil and in the living language." Only after the people had gained a foothold in all parts of the country, and the language of the Book had been revived, "only then will the Book open up its heart and inner mean- ing-and the soul of the Book and the soul of the people will be one."65 The mythi- cization of the soul of the nation and the soul of the Book was a new element for Ben-Gurion, and should, perhaps, be taken with a grain of salt. He might have been momentarily carried away by the excitements of the previous year. It was certain- ly a departure from his rational level-headedness, even with respect to the Bible. But whether his flowery pronouncement on the "soulmate" bond between the peo- ple and the Book was an embarrassing slip or a clumsy attempt to imitate the style of the philosophers with whom he had conducted dialogues during 1949, not so his actualization and concretization of the Book: "None of the biblical commen- tators, neither Jew nor Gentile, neither in the Middle Ages nor in our own time, could have interpreted the chapters of Joshua as did the feats of the Israel Defense Forces [IDF] this past year," he declared. In the new settlements in the Negev and Jezreel Valley, seeds will sprout that will help explicate several of the chapters of the Prophets, he added.66 The process of concretization assigned archeology a prominent role. Israel's conquests had created new opportunities for Israeli arche- ologists, and archeological mounds (tels) were "awaiting the spade of the Hebrew archeologist to discover the secrets of the past." Jewish archeology aimed to shed light on puzzling scriptural episodes, but its chief importance, according to Ben Gurion, was "to contemporize our past and actualize our historical continuity in the country."67 Over the next few years, Ben-Gurion lost none of his enthusiasm for the Bible. On the contrary, during this period he made it the cornerstone of his worldview. In lieu of Jewish history, religious and secular culture, and Zionist teachings, all of which he dismissed as having no current importance, he posi- tioned the Bible and the messianic vision as the dual centerpiece of his worldview. Ben-Gurion, in the 1950s, was looked up to as the father of the nation. He had es- tablished the state; he had won the War of Independence. His opinion carried weight. The Bible Circle that he hosted in his home drew top biblical scholars from all over the country and provided a forum for him to present his ideas on such is- sues as the Jewish people's beginnings in their own land, the Exodus, Joshua's con- quests and so on. The press found it piquant that the Prime Minister and Minister 64.

He was neither a scholar nor an expert, but this did not stop Ben-Gurion from delivering his opinions as if he were, and although scholars de- ferred to him out of respect, behind his back they were clearly bemused. As part of the festivities for the state's tenth anniversary, the Bible "pageant" was enriched by an additional facet: the Bible Quiz. It was organized by the Society for Biblical Research in Israel and was presided over by Prof. Yehezkel Kaufmann, a noted scholar and author of Toldot Ha-Emuna Ha- Yisraelit [The History of the Is- raelite Faith].68 Other self-respecting bodies soon followed suit, resulting in the IDF Bible Quiz and the Jewish Youth Bible Quiz. In 1963, the first international Bible Quiz for Jewish Youth was instituted with solemn pomp. Held on Independence Day, it competed with the IDF parade for public attention. Ben-Gurion, who was in at- tendance for the quiz's conclusion, placed the two events on an equal plane, "the spir- itual parade alongside the military parade."69 "Party-poopers," however, condemned the spectacle of turning the Bible into a tasteless, competitive sport. Nevertheless, Dr. H. M. Y. Gvaryahu, chairman of the Society of Biblical Research in Israel, ex- plained that the quiz was a "refined, legitimate and assuredly cultural amusement that served as a vehicle to raise the overall national cultural level and augment the nation's knowledge of the Bible."70 He contended that it enhanced Bible study among young and old alike and made Israelis biblical devotees. Going even further, he added that following the War of Independence, "there had been a lack of cohesiveness in the country, and talk of inner crisis." Then along came the Bible quiz, and lo and be- hold: "People had begun to observe the buds of spiritual rebirth in the country.""71 But many others did not view the quizzes in this favorable light and questioned their educational value, founded as they were solely on memorization. Indeed, the win- ners, termed by Gvaryahu as "modest, unpretentious and utterly devoted to studying Bible and Judaism,"72 displayed an admirable proficiency, but it is doubtful that they improved the discussion on the Bible. Nor could they serve as a model for scripture enthusiasts outside of the religiously observant population. There was something pa- thetic about the general excitement over the Bible quiz and the importance attributed to it by the state institutions. Scholastically, its effect was nil if not downright nega- tive, as youngsters only became fed up with the Bible fixation. Yitzhak Tishler, a journalist and writer who had fought with the Palmah in the 1948 War, scoffed: "When I was young, in my innocence I believed in the endless richness of the Book of the Judges. Today, we are informed that the main thing is an encyclopedic knowl- edge of the surnames of the Babylonian Exiles ... and as a substitute for the social values espoused by Isaiah, it is better to score points in quizzes."73 A well-known 68.

In Israel's evolving identity in the 1950s, the Bible exerted a palpable pres- ence in cultural life. One important work written and staged during this period was Nissim Aloni's play, Akhzar Mi-Kol-Ha-Melekh [Cruelest of all, the King],74 about Jeroboam, son of Nebat. Another, Melekh Basar Va-Dam [King of Flesh and Blood75], was a historical novel on the Hasmonean king, Alexander Yanai. Writ- ten by Moshe Shamir, a prominent writer of the '48 generation, it paved the way for his next book, Kivsat Ha-Rash [The Poor Man's Ewe76], on Uriah the Hittite. These works could be seen as allegories of Ben-Gurion's rule and the disappoint- ment of the young Left with him. Yet another important writer, Joseph Aricha, pub- lished the historical novel, Sanheriv Bi-Yehuda [Sennacherib in Judea]. Jacob Fichmann criticized the dramatization of scriptural heroes, deeming the literary at- tempts to emulate biblical style and use biblical figures to be doomed to failure: there was a reason that Shakespeare had eschewed biblical stories in his plays- "an untouchable area," Fichmann quoted authorY. Schoffman on the subject." De- spite the above examples, however, the use of biblical tales in Hebrew literature was not overly widespread. The modem Hebrew language, on the other hand, soaked up countless biblical idioms, associations and manners of expression: "Is it that I lack madmen?"; "Tell it not in Gath"; "Sold for lentils pottage"; "Let me die with the Philistines"; "And the land had peace for forty years"; "By Rachel your younger daughter"; and so forth, and so on.78 Israel's cultural codes were fashioned by the Bible, and the retreat from the Bible in the Eighties was soon felt in the impoverishment of the language. The Hebraization of surnames and introduction of new first names in Israel brought a larger gallery of biblical characters to public attention. Generic Jewish names-after the Patriarchs and Matriarchs, or Moses and Aharon, or even Joshua, Samuel, Solomon, David, and Elijah-became rarer, and were replaced by such names as Dan, Tamar, Amos, Gideon, Ehud, Boaz, Omri, Athalia, and so on, their chief distinction being that they had not been used in the Diaspora. Great pains were also taken to Hebraize the map of Palestine by restoring biblical place names, many of which had been preserved in the Arabic. In Yemei Ziklag [Days of Zik- lag], the most important work written on the War of Independence, S. Yizhar de- scribed a series of battles in the Negev at Hirbet Mehaz, identified by some as the biblical Ziklag to which David had fled from Saul.

Yizhar, however, destroyed the image by ironically querying whether the site was, indeed, Ziklag or just the nondescript Hirbet Mehaz, devoid of all biblical grace.79 Archeology has been a national hobby since the War of Independence. Ben- Gurion's appearance before the Society for the Exploration of the Land of Israel and its Antiquities, and his assertion that archeology contemporizes the biblical past, were the signal for the young to start showing an interest in the field. The fact that the IDF's second Chief of Staff, Yigael Yadin, was the son of noted Jerusalem arche- ologist Eliezer Lipa Sukenik only enhanced the aura of the profession. Yadin, in his own person, connected the biblical past with present statehood, the wars of ancient Israel with the wars of modem Israel. After his service as Chief of Staff, he com- pleted his archeological studies and went on to become a professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Moshe Dayan, another Chief of Staff, was a sworn ama- teur archeologist, once even almost losing his life on a dig. Little wonder that Yitz- hak Tishler complained that "for years now, I have been scrounging around ... for a Major whose desk is not bedecked with a Second Temple clay menorah [can- delabra]; let alone for Major-Generals and their NCOs who make do with less than a pot in their gardens."80 In the kibbutzim and cooperative settlements, thousands of adults and young people regularly volunteered for archeological excavations. The annual Exploration Society conferences drew large audiences and enjoyed broad coverage in the slender media of the times. Archeology was meant to bolster bibli- cal claims by finding proof on the ground. To many educators, this was unneces- sary: the Bible stood on its own. Nonetheless, it was heartwarming to find hard evidence for biblical tales. When Ben-Gurion summoned Yadin to consult on strate- gic matters, the first part of the conversation was devoted to archeological matters. Yadin reported to the Prime Minister on the discoveries at Hazor. He hoped to find proof for I Kings 9:15, on Solomon's building at Hazor, Meggido, and Gezer. Ben- Gurion listened attentively, voiced a desire to visit the digs, and even bothered to jot down the conversation in his journal, alongside the political issues on the agen- da.8' The Dead Sea Scrolls found in the caves of Qumran on the eve of statehood and brought to Israel by indirect routes epitomized the connection between arche- ological finds and biblical research. In 1955, the State of Israel decided to establish the Shrine of the Book Foundation, a custodianship for the scrolls, to collect man- uscripts, documents and other fragments related to the Bible and ancillary literature and to build a separate edifice to house the material.82 In 1965 the Shrine of the Book was inaugurated as part of Israel Museum and has become one of the em- blems of the state. The keenness for archeology extended beyond biblical finds. The 79. S. Yizhar, Yemei Ziklag [Days of Ziklag], Tel Aviv, Am Oved, 1958, pp. 163-164. 80.

The unearthing of the remains and letters of Bar Kochba's warriors in the Judean Desert in 1960 was considered a mo- mentous event. Ben-Gurion likened its significance to that of the trial of captured Nazi Adolph Eichmann taking place at the time: "A connecting, closer link in the chain of a stiff-necked people's steadfast struggle has been forged anew, sustaining without cessation their profound bond to the ancient homeland," he declared.83 Any- thing that substantiated the Jewish people's antiquity in their own land, and the glo- ry of their ancient heroism and kingdom, was embraced. In the period between the two world wars, archeological investigation in the Middle East had uncovered a rich ancient culture, proud and vital. The similarities between the mythical world of the Bible and that of the peoples of the Fertile Cres- cent; between the biblical account of the Flood and that in the Epic of Gilgamesh; between various idioms, laws, and customs pointed to common social and politi- cal foundations. A new narrative was born, seeking to undermine the biblical one: The Hebrews had been a great nation that had held sway over the Fertile Crescent; their tongue had been Hebrew, their culture, pagan. The Phoenician seafarers had belonged to this civilization, as had the Canaanites, and the Israelites. Baal and As- tarte or Ashera had been the gods of the land of Israel. It had been an instinctual, physical culture of power and force, masculinity and sensuality, war and heroism. The Bible, according to this view, was an ideological narrative created in Baby- lonian Exile, the cradle of Judaism, which was not committed to the nation-build- ing triad of people-land-language. The new nation now rising in the land of Israel was the true heir of the early Hebrews and unrelated to Jews. It was meant to reign over the Middle East with Hebrew as the dominant language and, willy-nilly, it would absorb all the peoples of the region. The Jews were a millet [Turkish word for a religious grouping]. The thread between the Hebrew nation and the Jewish milet was like that between Americans and the British: in a land of immigration, after several generations, the umbilical cord to the country of origin is cut and a new nation emerges locally. This idea, nurtured and disseminated by poet Yonatan Ratosh (Halperin), a native Polish Jew who had immigrated to Palestine in his youth, was crowned derisively by poet Avraham Shlonsky as "Canaanism." Its ad- herents, the "Canaanites," regarded the Bible as a text that perverted Hebrew an- tiquity, and they looked for the authentic roots of Hebrew civilization in the archeological discoveries on the ancient East and in Wellhausen's biblical criti- cism.84 To some extent, the pristine civilization they sought was reminiscent of the biblical worlds of Berdyczewski-who preferred the evildoers in the eyes of the Lord-Tchernichowsky, and Frischmann. These writers, however, were thorough- ly steeped in the Jewish historical experience. To be sure, they were ambivalent to- 83. Prime Minister's Address, Independence Day, Davar, 21.4.1961. 84.

Their approach was critical and called for secularization and a return to the ancient vitality. But they sought to change Jews, to create a "new Jew." They never envisaged a break between the emerging nation in the land of Israel and its Jewish forefathers, or between the ancient Hebrews and the Bible. The "Canaanite" conception is an example of inventing a useful past. The nature of the nation rising in the land of Israel and its connection with the Jewish people was a question that had teased Zionist thinkers since the movement's in- ception, especially in the 1930s when, for the first time, "native sons" and those reared in Palestine began to represent a significant generational cohort. Their emo- tional, physical, and cultural detachment from both their parents and the Jewish people in the Diaspora was obvious to any discerning eye. Whether this outgrowth was spontaneous, the fruit of Palestine's realities, or the effect of the ideological indoctrination of "negating Exile" must be left for a separate article. The "Canaan- ites," at any rate, were not content with pointing out the sabra generation's alien- ation from the Jewish people. They fostered a break with Second Temple history and the Bible as it was while inventing a new genealogy. Ratosh and his followers wished to dissociate themselves completely from historical Judaism and contem- porary Jewry. Their attempt to invent an alternative historical nation was designed to free the present nation of all religious affiliation. The Hebrews had been a na- tion in its own right, independent of religious tenets. By the same token, affilia- tion to the "new Hebrews" did not depend on religious identity. The new nation being invented was secular, and could absorb all the inhabitants of the "land of the Euphrates." Ratosh hankered after a Hebrew empire in the Middle East, created by the sword. He believed that the conquered peoples would assimilate among the conquerors; it would be an empire in which all citizens enjoyed equal rights, and all would adopt the Hebrew tongue, which, according to him, was the original spo- ken language in the region. Ratosh was situated at the extreme Right of the polit- ical spectrum. His romanticization of a glorious ancient past to justify Hebrew regional superiority had a dual purpose: to cut the Gordian knot between the Jew- ish people and their past and to legitimate the use of force for present conquests. The break with Judaism was also a break with the system of ethical norms it had developed through the ages. Despite its militant and even fascist overtones, which cannot be overlooked, the option of a local identity proposed by Ratosh attracted not only right-wingers but also cultural figures on the Zionist Left.85 Wellhausen's theory of biblical criticism, which dated the start of Jewish his- 85.

As will be recalled, Bible teaching in Hebrew high schools had adopted Wellhausen's interpretative ap- proach. Where and when monotheism had developed did not particularly interest teachers or pupils, nor did it interest writers or poets who used biblical images as prototypes of common conventions and associations. Ratosh's conception circum- vented biblical chronology and undermined the nation's foundation myth. Before then, few people had lost any sleep over whether the Bible represents authentic his- tory or is an admixture of historical and legendary sediments that together make up myth. The bond between the Jewish people and the ancient land appeared to be a given (after all, no one cast doubt on the Jewish presence in the land of Israel since Persian times, at least). With the exception of religious Jews who took the Bible as divine inspiration, it was generally regarded as representing the Jewish people's traditional approach to their history rather than as a neutral historical text; as the common cultural heritage rather than as objective truth. Ben-Gurion ex- pressed a similar approach: the Bible was not a history book. As for its historical content, he had serious "postmodern" reservations about the existence of a "sci- ence" of history.86 The Bible could not stand as evidence of what had been, he said. It was partial and limited, presenting the author's version. "It is clear in the tales of Genesis that the authors of these chapters believed what they wrote, but this faith is no proof that their beliefs matched the specifics related," he wrote to philoso- pher Hugo Bergman.87 The "Canaanites" thus did not herald a new approach to the Bible, but, rather, an extreme interpretation colored by politics. "Canaanism" had lifted one option from biblical criticism and wielded it as a weapon against the accepted Jewish identity. It pitted the biblical and archeological narratives against one another, showing a clear preference for the latter and the form it took from the studies on the ancient East. Its novelty lay not in its critical approach, or in its adop- tion of Wellhausen's thesis, or in its reliance on archeological finds, but in the ex- clusive ascription of the Hebrew past to a local identity and the severance of that past from historical Judaism. Only in this way could "Hebrews" be natives of the land and have a patrimonial right to it and, at the same time, throw off the ethnic or historical shackles to the Judaism that Ratosh so detested.88 The centrality of the biblical past in Ratosh's doctrine reflected the impor- "Canaanism"'s archeological roots, see A.

Another aspect of identity politics was reflected by Ben-Gurion's attempt to exalt the Bible while thoroughly disparaging and dismissing other components of Israeli-Jewish culture. Ben-Gurion's "Bible-mania" or "biblical terrorism" as literary scholar Dov Sadan put it, aroused resentment.89 Intellectuals, writers, and scholars united in condemning what they saw as a form of "Canaanism" even though Ben-Gurion never contemplated a break with either historical or contemporary Jewry. But he did cast about for suitable educational values on which to build the Israeli nation; values that he felt had been missing in Diaspora history. These he found in abun- dance in the Bible. The Bible was to serve as the common educational grounding of Israeli youth and immigrants from the lands of Islam. The former were alienat- ed from Eastern European Jewish tradition, as symbolized by the shtetl (the small town), which had meanwhile vanished from the world and lingered on only in lit- erature and art. The latter were far removed from Zionist ideology, their bond to the State of Israel being based on Jewish tradition and the messianic vision. In their 1957 dialogue, philosopher Nathan Rotenstreich objected to Ben-Gurion's attempt to maneuver "a historical leap" by discarding the sum total of the Jewish people's cultural achievements since biblical times. Ben-Gurion was not perturbed: The Jews had indeed managed a historical leap in time and space, he claimed, from the biblical era to modern statehood, and from the Diaspora to Israel. This leap is what caused Israeli youth to cherish the Bible more than any other work created since then. "The books of the Bible tip the scales for Israeli youth ... they are fresh, up to date, relevant, immediate in terms of geography and plot, [and] inspiring," he waxed rapturous, adding: "I wonder that you do not appreciate the Jewish people's marvelous faculty of living their distant past as if it were today." The Bible was to instill in youth a vision of both national and universal redemption: "The Zionist brochures, that decades ago served an educational purpose and are now outdated, will be replaced by the eternal book and its sublime tidings."90 Intellectuals, however, continued to criticize the cultural and historical shal- lowness engendered by the unraveling of all extra-biblical threads from the fabric of Israeli culture. At the Writers Conference of 1962, Haim Hazaz, a prominent figure in modern Hebrew literature and closely associated with Ben-Gurion and his party, lambasted the cultural trend instituted by Ben-Gurion, especially the "biblical cult." "The Bible will not do us any good," Hazaz protested. "We do not live by the Bible. Nor is the Bible itself the whole of Judaism. Judaism began with the destruction of the Temple, not with the Bible. The Oral Law is what kept us a people, not the Bible." Hazaz was not advocating a reinstatement of Gemara schol- arship; he demanded that Jewish culture be taught in its entirety, that the threat of "amputation" from Ben-Gurion's "historical leap" be removed. In an incisive his- torical diagnosis, Hazaz discerned the revolutionary germ inherent in submitting 89. Sadan is quoted in E. E.

It was in the Bible that the Karaite sect had its origin. It was to the Bible that the Enlightenment returned when it had had its fill of Orthodox Jewish life."91 Hazaz and his col- leagues sought to preserve the historical continuum and cultural continuity be- tween the Israeli experience and post-biblical creativity, particularly that of the past two centuries-this was their counterproposal to Ben Gurion's cultural option.92 The Six-Day War signalled a major turning point in the history of the State of Israel, and, in terms of the present discussion, had a paradoxical effect. "Little Israel" had sat mostly on the coastal plain, in the Negev and in Galilee. The bibli- cal land of Judea and Samaria, the cradle of the Hebrew nation, had been on the other side of the boundary. The conquest of the West Bank suddenly made Jeru- salem, Shiloh and Anatot, Hebron and Shechem, Jericho and Bethlehem all ac- cessible. In the initial postwar enthusiasm, Israelis descended on these sites en masse to discover places that, on the whole, they knew only from the Bible. It was archeology's finest hour; never before had there been such clear governmental sup- port for archeological digs. The encounter with the land of the Bible, however, de- stroyed the romance of the Bible: It was a foreign country, inhabited by another people. The right-wing poet and writer, Yitzhak Shalev, had taken his son, Meir, to gaze across to East Jerusalem when it had been under Jordanian occupation. It had been his way of showing his young son the land of the Bible and nurturing in him a love for it. But when Meir Shalev came up against Arab refugees in the Six-Day War, face to face with the humiliation entailed in conquest, he inwardly "divorced" himself from the land of the Bible. Writer Amos Oz, Jerusalem born, felt like a hat- ed foreign conqueror in the Old City of east Jerusalem.93 In early Zionist settlement, the Bible had typically served as a connecting link between utopian and physical re- ality. Now, things were different, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was too strong to be ignored. There was no awakening of a sense of belonging based on the Bible and oblivious to reality. On the contrary, reality banished the "book memory." The romance of the biblical land had been tied up with the memory of the "generation of '48," born and bred in the country, and with the image of a pre-state virgin land: cactus hedges, wells, stone houses nestling in the hillside, robed'fig- ures reminiscent of Patriarch times, camel caravans, Beduin tents, and a host of other images connected to the Arab landscape that were perceived as reflecting the ancient way of life in the land of Canaan. Now, wherever one looked, one could see the signs of Israeli progress. Gone were the cacti and wells. Dirt paths had been replaced by paved roads, slow-moving camels by speeding cars. Instead of stone houses blending in with the landscape, white homes with red roofs rent the pas- toral harmony. Israeli modernization had blotted out all sign of the biblical past.

This definition applied chiefly to the sociological stratum of Israeli society that flew the biblical flag as a symbol of identity: secular Jews, for whom the Bible was both "national literalism" (pshat) and identity-forming commentary (mid- rash), expressions used by Uriel Simon. The ability to concretize the Bible stopped short at the dramatic rediscovery of the Palestinian problem that had been forgot- ten in "little Israel" for nineteen years. Zionist settlement of the country, it will be recalled, had not applied to the biblical land that was populated by Arabs, but main- ly to the land of the Philistines, that is, the coastal plain. Thus, the pre-1967 con- cretization of the Bible had not related to the actual areas mentioned in the Bible. But, now, another social group, with added fervor for the land, arose to appropriate and concretize the Bible: religious Zionism. Gush Emunim (the Bloc of the Faith- ful) appeared on the scene in the early 1970s and, at first, had both secular and re- ligious members. This partnership, however, dissolved over the years, leaving a solid block of religious-Zionism. Gush Emunim borrowed the secular revolution's attitude of biblical literalism and endowed it with the force of religious precepts. In traditional Jewish thought, the Torah is considered the Law of Moses given on Mt. Sinai according to God's word. But down the generations, norms changed, external influences were absorbed from the non-Jewish milieu and lifestyles radically altered. Over the centuries, Oral Law and rabbinic judgments had mediated between the Bible and the flock of believers. Thus, for instance, the Torah commandment of settling the land of Israel was, in practice, observed by very few Jews. The verse, "I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles, and by the hinds of the field, that ye awaken not, nor stir up love, until it please" (Song of Songs 3:5) was interpreted as a ban on Jews to ascend the walls, that is, to bring about the return to Zion prior to the coming of the Messiah.95 In this man- ner, a mitigating and moderating exegesis matched ancient laws to the changing needs of the community. The tradition of commentary that related to the text sole- ly by way of association, for generations had left all decisions to rabbinic teachers and scholars. The more esoteric the language and content of the biblical text, the greater the authority of Oral Law. The renewal of the Hebrew language, however, and the teaching of its grammar in the Hebrew renaissance removed the barriers between readers and the text's literal sense.96 This process first affected the secu- lar public. But it penetrated also religious Zionist circles.97 94. Quoted by Amos Oz, Mi-Mordot Ha-Levanon (from the Slops of Lebanon), Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 1987, p. 215. 95.

There is a parallel between Protestantism's approach to sacred texts and the Jewish attitude to biblical literalism. 33</page><page sequence="24">Anita Shapira These circles, after the Six-Day War, breathed the air of messianism as if re- demption, so to speak, were around the corner. In this climate, the way was opened for religious Zionist youth to interpret the Bible literally. Gone was the separation between past and present. The past had become concrete in the present, not unlike Ben-Gurion's "Bible-mania," but, now, the implications were no longer strictly cul- tural; they were religiously binding. Direct access to the text dispensed with the need for a teacher's mediation and interpretation, since everyone could understand it. This led to extreme readings of biblical injunctions that had been considered anachronistic and meaningless. For example, the directive in Deuteronomy 7:2, ve- lo tehanem, "and you shall not show mercy unto them," was taken by extremists as license for indiscriminate expulsion. The literal sense, which in the past had been attenuated by Oral Law or, according to secular-Zionist lights, by a human- ist, universal worldview, was embraced by religious Zionism as legitimacy for a raw nationalism decreed from on high. Religious-nationalism's appropriation of the Bible was concomitant with two other processes: the slow but sure infiltration of traditional commentary into secular Bible teaching and the waning of the ideological era. Virtually since the state's establishment, a covert struggle had been waged over who was to teach Bible and how it was to be taught. Although in the public arena the Bible enjoyed the sta- tus of a secular national work, at the state school level there had been a growing tendency to read it as a sacred text and put God back into it. As early as the 1950s, reservations had been raised about whether secular teachers were qualified to teach Bible given that they were unable to impart its religious conception, the voice of God: according to this view, God's word was not to be interpreted as the voice of conscience or as the ancients' view of the world, but, rather, it was to be taken lit- erally. A teacher who could not express this conception was to compensate for the absence of faith with a robust enthusiasm for the text.98 These discussions, in which educators and academics participated, related to secular schools and do not seem to have had any immediate repercussions. But, in time, traditional commen- tary played an increasing role in Bible teaching, displacing critical approaches in the classroom. Religious scholar Nehama Leibovitch was instrumental in impart- ing this perspective to her students, and they, in turn, produced generations of 98. On this topic, see, for instance, Ephraim E. Urbach, "Limudei Ha-Yahadut Be-Veit Ha-Se- fer Ha-Tikhon" [ Jewish Studies in High School], Erkhei Ha- Yahadut Be- Veit Ha-Sefer Ha Tikhon [ Jew- ish Values in High School], symposium, (1955), Tel Aviv (1957), pp. 53-57; Zvi Adar, Ha-Arakhim Ha-Hinukhiim shel Ha-Tanakh [The Educational Values of the Bible], Jerusalem-Tel Aviv: M.

And so it was that more and more, the Bible, as educational material, came to resemble a religious text. The winnowing out of historical and critical compo- nents from school Bible teaching caused both teachers and pupils to distance them- selves from it. The text became boring, was identified with national and religious fanaticism, and was meaningless to secular Israeli youth. The only people to retain a love for the Bible were those who had finished school before the 1970s. Until the 1970s, the Bible's key position in Israeli culture had reflected an ideological era. It was a period of contesting worldviews, of communism and lib- eralism, of democracy and dictatorship. All "believers" seized on "holy" texts, whether secular or religious, that professed to explain the present and predict the future. On this ideological front, the Bible, too, was seen as a text that told the sto- ry of the past, serving as a national guide for the present and holding out hope of universal redemption for the future. The ideological era was part of the modern worldview that accorded precedence to man in the larger picture. Secular inter- pretation of the Bible did the same thing. Upon the ideological meltdown, howev- er, and the emergence of postmodern currents, there was no more use for the Bible. This seems to be a universal phenomenon, not specific to Israel. With regard to Is- rael, Uriel Simon described it thus: "It is, at any rate, certain that Zionism is los- ing its validity as a secular religion and that the Bible no longer serves it as a sacred text." He attributed this to the widening gulf "between the actual present and the mythological past."99 But this explanation is inadequate, for the actual present nev- er kept pace with the mythological past and, yet, the Bible had cast a powerful spell on generations of young people, alongside other "sacred" texts. The phenomenon seems to fit more properly into worldwide processes of cultural relativism and the repudiation of hierarchical moral and value systems. In a world where anything goes, the Bible, of necessity, loses its standing as a compass. As long as Israeli so- ciety was suffused with the ardor of a secular messianic vision, the Bible was one of its symbols; once that society lost its connection to a structured system of uni- versal values (which depreciated), so the Bible lost its key cultural position. The combination of religious-nationalism's appropriation of the Bible, the teaching of the Bible as a religious text, and the end of the ideological era togeth- er tolled the knell for the Bible's centrality in Israeli identity. The interest of the non-religious tapered off and, for the most part, remained confined to the older age group. Now and then, the old appeal was aroused, as happened after Meir Shalev published Tanakh Akhshav (Bible Now), which depicted flesh-and-blood figures in modern garb speaking modem Hebrew by analogy with current politics. Shalev looked the Bible straight in the eye with amusement and no pathos, thereby re-ac- cessing it for the secular public.00oo At the end of the 1990s, director Rina Yerushal- mi staged an impressive, original show, "Va-Yomer, Va-Yelekh" (And He Said, And He Went Out) that succeeded in touching thousands of hearts.

Both episodes, spanning twenty years, were refreshing, but they only underscored the devaluation of the Bible as an agent of identity and culture. In early 1999, Uriel Simon published a fascinating treatise, The Status of the Bible in Israeli Society: From National Commentary to Existential Literalism.'-0 It was an elegiac attempt to analyze the Bible's national past in Israel and to suggest a modest means of elevating it in the present (the less clear and convincing part of the essay). Its historical context, following the Oslo Accords, was marked by high hopes for the dawning of peace between Israel and the Palestinians. The Zionist en- deavor seemed to have run its course and a new, post-national, post-Zionist era was emerging. There were those who sought to help the process along by lowering the level of national fervor. Others found it necessary to list all the evils of Zionism as a lead-in to the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, so as to make the two sides more even. Still others saw it as an opportunity to root out the Zionism they so despised and to be rid of its Jewish national uniqueness. Simon posed the Bible's diminishment in Israeli society as an indication of the dislocation of Israeli identity. He did not welcome it, but he accepted it as a fait accompli. At the end of that year, archeologist Ze'ev Herzog of Tel Aviv University published an elaborate, lengthy essay in the Ha-Aretz daily, entitled "The Bible. No Facts on the Ground." The editors embellished it with sensational subheads on both the front page and the cover of the supplement: "The word from the Holy Land: after 70 years of archeological exploration it appears that there was no bib- lical period," and "Sanctity comes out of the closet: according to archeologists' findings, we were not in Egypt, we did not wander in the desert, we did not settle the land-and that's only the beginning." Aimed at a readership that was general- ly indifferent to scientific topics, the headlines were meant to draw attention to Herzog's article. Not since the splash made by Ben-Gurion's explanations of Exo- dus does the Bible seem to have featured so prominently in the Israeli press. Herzog had taken it upon himself to present to the public the findings of Is- raeli archeology over the past twenty years, which, according to him, proved that the biblical tales on the formation of the Jewish people were totally unfounded. "It's hard to accept, but it's clear today to researchers that the Jewish people were not in Egypt, did not wander in the desert, did not conquer the land in a military campaign and pass it on to the Twelve Tribes of Israel ... that the united kingdom of David and Solomon, described in the Bible as a regional power, was, at most, a small tribal kingdom ... and that the ancient Israelite religion had adopted monotheism only at the end of the realm rather than on Mt. Sinai." Herzog briefly summarized the history of archeological research in the land of Israel; it had be- gun by trying to bolster the Bible's standing as a historical source and had ended up invalidating considerable portions of the biblical stories. The wanderings of the Patriarchs and the Exodus belong to the sphere of legend. The inhabitation of the 101.

No signs have been found of Jerusalem having been the capital of a large kingdom in the time of David and Solomon. True, the thirteenth-centu- ry BCE Merneptah Stele does mention "Israel" ("Israel is laid waste, his seed is not"), but not necessarily as a "nation" with a territory. And, yes, an inscription was found at Tel Dan with the word "David." But, in fact, it is difficult to find hard evidence for the existence of a real Jewish kingdom centered on Jerusalem prior to the ninth century BCE. Herzog considered it his duty to apprise the Israeli public of the inconsis- tencies between archeology and the Bible, and to deliver the news with a jolt so that it would sink in. "It would appear that Israeli society is partially ready to ac- knowledge the injustices done the country's Arab inhabitants, and is prepared to accept women's social equality. But it is still not strong enough to embrace the archeological facts that have shattered the biblical myth." Summing up the arche- ological findings, he asserted: "The historical existence of the kingdoms of Israel and Judea may thus be acknowledged from the ninth century BCE. In relation to other peoples of Western civilization, this is fairly early and may serve as conso- lation for anyone who needs it."l02 If Herzog's intention had been to raise a hue and cry, he succeeded. Provoca- tive headlines worked where scientific articles had failed; the publication was fol- lowed by a dozen symposia and seminars, drawing large audiences. The Bible suddenly became a "hot" item on Israel's cultural agenda. Academically, Herzog and his colleagues, known as the Tel Aviv School (as opposed to the more conser- vative Jerusalem School), number among the Bible's more moderate critics (the Minimalists). The extremists are twofold: either non-Israeli scholars who utterly reject the Bible's worth as a historical source and situate the start of Jewish histo- ry with the return of Ezra and Nehemiah, or religious circles who adhere to the tra- ditional version, seeing the Bible as historical truth.103 Ultimately, the discussion represents a dispute among biblical scholars, historians, and archeologists over methods of research and reconstruction and is not within the purview of this es- say.104 What is of interest here, however, is the public sensitivity to the subject and the dialogue between the scholarly community and the general population. Herzog's very initiative in informing the people that dwell in Zion of the er- ror of their ways with regard to certain facts about the Bible is telling: after all, one finds marked discrepancies between scholarly findings and popular opinion on any number of subjects. Rare, however, is the scholar who publishes articles in the dai- ly press in order to correct the public, and rare the academic topics that earn promi- nence and column inches in a weekly supplement. It is hard to escape the feeling 102. Ze'ev Herzog, "Ha-Tanakh. Ein Mimtza'im Ba-Shetah" [The Bible. No Facts in the Field], Ha-Aretz 29.10.1999. 103. Following the many discussions, an anthology of articles appeared, edited by Israel. L. Levine and Amihai Mazar, Ha-Pulmus al Ha-Emet Ha-Historit Ba-Mikra [The Controversy over His- torical Truth in the Bible], Jerusalem: Yad Ben-Zvi, 2001, which is a fair representation of the preva- lent views in Israel on the topic, and refers also to the extreme positions of other schools. 104.

By the same token, Ha-Aretz was not interested in simply informing its readers. Other factors seemed to be in play, namely, the lingering influence of the 1990s controversy over different Zionist and post-Zionist historical approaches. That polemic had presented the public with different narratives of the War of Indepen- dence and Jewish-Arab relations and spilt over into other topics, such as Israeli so- ciety and the Holocaust and the absorption of mass immigration in the 1950s. Their common denominator was that they all touched on the roots of Israeli identity and, in the final analysis, on the legitimacy of the existence of the State of Israel. Only a thin line separated the impartial scholarly criticism of the representation of the past from the conscious, aggressive use made of specific components of that crit- icism; components that were magnified and emphasized in order to compromise the legitimacy of Zionist identity. A routine ploy of post-Zionist polemics was to take an accepted feature of collective memory (as molded by the media, literature and the education system) and present it as deliberately distorted by "official" historiography. Certain topics were highlighted out of all proportion to their significance. Issues that had not re- ally been in dispute by historians suddenly occupied center stage, forcing histori- ans to react. This metamorphosis of a "non-topic" into a heated controversy resurfaced in the discussion after Herzog's article. After all, how likely is it that, prior to his article, Israel's educated secular public, which comprises Ha-Aretz's main target population, had believed that the Bible represented historical truth? And even more so-how likely is it that this readership would have wished to sup- press archeological findings on the Books of Joshua or Judges? Scholars back in Ben-Gurion's 1950s Bible circle had already broached misgivings about the Book of Joshua description of tribal colonization, and their published opinions had not brought the walls tumbling down.'o5 Herzog's "news" concerned his dating of the start of the kingdom, which remains a controversial research issue. It is doubtful that this "innovation" warranted far-reaching assertions about Israeli identity. Like the controversy on the "new historians," the biblical debate was cheered on-perhaps, even produced-by the press; it was displaced from the ivory tow- er of academe onto the sorry stage of politics. Herzog "invited" political reaction by explicitly claiming that the fear of biblical unreliability was linked with the fear of the potential of the latter to erode Jewish historical rights to the land of Israel. The daily "invited" political reaction by headlining the archeological findings as a "frightening conclusion," and claiming that "Israeli society chooses to suppress" these revelations.106 In addition, Ha-Aretz stoked the controversy by asking a se- ries of archeologists, politicians, and intellectuals for their responses to Herzog's 105.

Secular right-wingers (such as the late MK Rehavam Ze'evi, philosophy professor Joseph Ben Shlomo) and Gush Emunim figures (Hanan Porat; Yoel Bin Nun) re- buffed Herzog's thesis by questioning the reliability of his results. To cut the ground from under the "new archeology," the designation that soon crowned Her- zog and other adherents of the Minimalist School, they cited the findings of secu- lar researcher Adam Zertal, who had arrived at different conclusions.'07 Curiously enough, it was the right-wing and particularly the religious right-wing that sought a factual seal of approval for the biblical tales, which since the Six-Day War had become title deed to Israelite territory. In contrast, centrists and left-wing politi- cians, intellectuals, and celebrities (Yitzhak Ben-Aharon, Naomi Shemer, Yeho- shua Porat, Amos Keinan, Shlomo Er'el, and others) did not reject the findings, but, rather, their import. Grounded in humanist Zionism and treating the Bible as the basis of Hebrew culture, a work sanctified for thousands of years by the Jew- ish people, they did not feel that Herzog's disclosures posed a threat to Israeli iden- tity. Nor did they see anything new in the fact that the biblical tales may not be historically accurate or that some of them may be a mere set of legends that reflect how the people at the end of the First Temple period interpreted Israel's origins. They noted that that most of Herzog's claims had already been raised by Well- hausen and his students. And they remained unfazed. The most elegant verdict seems to have been that delivered by Nathan Zach, the noted, leftist Hebrew poet: "Archeologists and historians who based themselves on early researches made these arguments long ago. On the other hand, the smaller the Hebrew political en- tity appears to have been, the more inspired the biblical creativity, one of the great- est works of genius produced by mankind."'08 Other reactions, however, linked the discussion to current affairs in Israeli society and to the disagreements over the evacuation of the territories of Judea and Samaria. "Scientific research, which casts doubt on the Bible's historical accuracy as to the colonization of the Tribes of Israel, upsets the historical footing of the severe prohibition on handing over the land to strangers," Yossi Mart, a geology professor at Haifa University, comment- ed with glee. He instantly provoked a furious response from a settler across the Green Line.'09 Designating Herzog and his colleagues as "new archeologists" placed them willy-nilly in the same camp as historians and sociologists who have been chal- lenging a number of basic assumptions about Zionism, the Jewish people, and modern Jewish settlement. This was the presumption behind the "letters to the ed- itor" and scholarly discussions that ensued after Herzog publicly threw down the gauntlet. Secular scholars discerned an association between anti-Zionist trends and the Minimalist approach. Biblical invalidation was meant to bolster the Palestin- ian narrative that has recently attempted to present the Palestinians as the true heirs 107.

But these were not grounds for dismissing the Min- imalist case. Rather, the scholars distinguished between legitimate and politically- motivated criticism, and cautioned against overreaction: Even if we were to assume that Jewish history in the land of Israel started only 2,500 years ago, and that the kingdom of David and Solomon was a backwater tribal realm, this does not annul the Jewish people's connection to the land of Israel." o Uriel Simon, on the other hand, who, it will be recalled, only a year earlier had resigned himself to the Bible's waning influence in Israeli society, now found himself offended by the contempt Herzog had shown for biblical evidence and expressly defined the new archeolo- gy as post-Zionist. "Zionist archeology had sought to lay bare our roots in the land in order to deepen our foothold in it, while post-Zionist archeology seeks to lop off roots so that we may take wing, unhampered," he protested, once again embracing the secular "national narrative" which he had relinquished not so long ago.Il' To his mind, the argument on Joshua's conquest revolves around the identity of the early colonizers of the land of Israel: Were they Canaanites or Israelites? Concep- tions that describe the colonization as a local population's gradual takeover of the hilly regions put them as Canaanite. Biblical testimony speaks of the Israelites as an external population from Haran and Egypt, essentially different in culture from the locals. According to Simon, the views of historian Nadav Ne'eman, who stud- ies the biblical period and supports the extra-biblical approach, lead to a "Ca- naanization of the ancient people of Israel.""'12 Simon sums up: "The Bible's release from the fetters of the Zionist perspective is meant to free archeology from biblical evidence, and the invalidation of biblical evidence is meant to free arche- ological inquiry from the fetters of our national and religious uniqueness.""' 3 And so it was that soon after pronouncing the death of the Bible as a "national narra- tive" he reinvoked it as a hedge against nihilistic views that threatened to weaken the link between Jewish identity and the Bible. The equanimity with which secular spokesmen greeted the archeological criticism bespeaks a national outlook that has no problem with the idea that the Jews embarked on history as one of several local peoples, adopting a distinct faith only later, apparently towards the end of the First Temple period, when, in terms of lifestyle and guiding norms, they set themselves apart from the surrounding populations.

The extreme "Canaanite" formulations lent added weight to First Temple history as the classic Hebrew era, repudiating the periods of the return and the Second Temple. But all this is a storm in a teacup. One can accept biblical and archeological criticism without denying the roots of Jewish existence in the land of Israel or spurning an age-old masterwork that for generations has inspired Jewish and non-Jewish scholars, poets, and thinkers. To some extent, the discussion between archeologists, historians, and bibli- cal scholars seems to have repossessed the Bible from the national-religious sec- tor and reinstalled it as a secular cultural text. The camps warring over the Bible had already been defined in the 1980s by Hebrew writer Ehud Ben-Ezer, the son of First Aliyah immigrants: On the one hand, there is the classic Zionist approach which had "restored [the Bible] to the national agenda" but, like traditional Ju- daism, "had also qualified it; Zionism did not see [the Bible] as a source of bind- ing precepts, nor adopt it in its entirety, but attempted to emphasize its historical, literary, social, humane, nationalist-though also universal-portions, and this was how it used it as an educational tool." On the other hand, there were two cur- rents that embraced biblical "literalism": one was "Canaanism," which stripped the Bible of Jewish essence and made it the source for a pre-Jewish, Hebrew domin- ion that was "to be renewed in a secular Hebrew state ... by force and encompass all the inhabitants of the Middle East"; the other was the extreme religious-na- tionalist current, which made the Bible the title deed to the land of Israel. "These groups surrendered to the impact of the biblical tales with an almost idolatrous rap- ture, but without the qualifications of the halakhic law of Diaspora Orthodoxy or of the humanist moral values that were part of Zionism from its inception."'' 4 The convergence of the national-religious and Canaanite-secular extremes sheds light on the long road that Israeli identity has traveled since the start of the twentieth century. The commandeering of the Bible by both extremes demoted it in Israeli culture among center groups. To a large extent, the Bible's role in Israeli identity was supplanted by the Holocaust as a source of identification with the Jew- ish people, contemporary Jewry, and the lessons of Jewish martyrology. Instead of going on archeological digs, Israeli youth now go on school trips to Poland in search of roots. This development can be seen as a sign of the consolidation of a local identity that the younger generation accepts as given and natural. In a soci- ety where a considerable portion of the young are native Israelis or even the off- spring of native Israelis, there is no longer any need to prop up the attachment to the land with genealogical charts or a "book memory." The attachment to contem- porary Jewry, however, does need bolstering. Be that as it may, among secular el- ements for whom the Bible had been one of the basic pillars of the new Hebrew culture, there is a sense of loss and privation: Is there a way to restore the Bible to the focus of Hebrew culture? 114.
