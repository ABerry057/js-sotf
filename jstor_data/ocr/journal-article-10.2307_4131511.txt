And the light rises, and the light sets on them, thus, advancing across the plane .... Free as birds. And the laughter, and the energy, the self confi- dence and the appetite never leave them; nor the conviction of an exclusive sect, a superior sect that crosses over before the camp, a people of conquering pioneers that dwells alone. Amalia Kahana-Carmon, Up on Montifer' No Hebrew reader, at least no reader with some Hebraic literacy, would be able to ignore the strong national resonance of the biblical phrases that Amalia Ka- hana-Carmon-one of Israel's foremost writers, the recipient of the 2000 Israel Prize-inserted into the masterful opening of the title novella of her 1984 triptych, Up on Montifer. Indeed, the evocative power of these intertexts is inescapable. " cAm levadad yishkon," a verbatim quote from Balaam's prophecy (Numbers 23:9), is one of the sources for the construction of the Israelite and Jewish nation- al identity, connoting uniqueness, exclusivity, and chosenness. The slightly veiled phrases "cover(et) lifnei hamahaneh" and "'anshei halutz kovshim" add allusions to the foundational myth of the conquest of Canaan. In fact, they invoke the story of the tribes Gad and Reuben (Numbers 32), whose role as vanguard, crossing the Jordan before the rest of the Israelites (actually, "before the Lord," as the biblical text insists), no doubt stands behind the modern Zionist use of the biblical term halutz (vanguard) as "pioneer."2 * This essay is dedicated to the memory of Shulamith Hareven (1930-2003). 1.

This is, of course, an ironic borrowing, as Gad and Reuben volunteered to act as vanguard so that after the conquest they could go back to the rich land on the east side of the Jordan. 83</page><page sequence="2">Yael S. Feldman Biblically-literate readers might naturally expect that the excited and admir- ing description that culminates in these phrases would refer to the biblical ances- tors, or perhaps to their recent-day descendents: the Jewish pioneers in the Land of Israel. When readers realize-a few pages into the narrative-that these all-too- familiar epithets are attributed here to the "other"; and that the gentile (and of course male) dark horsemen described here are actually the enemy of the young Jewish female whose anonymous voice we hear at the opening of the novella, it is too late. A neat trompe l'oeil has taken place. By providing a new signified for the biblical signifiers-without ever alerting the reader to this replacement-the text has triggered a process of identification and projection, thereby assisting the read- er in imagining the other subjectively. In the language of the narrator of this story, the "preconceived judgment," the image we usually have of the other (particularly of a different gender, nationality, or class, as illustrated in this narrative) has been partially or temporarily bracketed, so that self and other may exchange places, at least for a short while. Kahana-Carmon's manipulation of the biblical canon in this text is a re- markable illustration of what theorists have identified as a typical feminist ploy, "reading against the grain."3 The grain in question is that of "the fathers' tongue," the cultural system generally perceived to be the domain of the male sex, the mak- ers and guardians of scriptures and strictures, the originators of the dos and don'ts of most societies. This emphasis on the gendered nature of the cultural system, essentialist as it may sound, is not, of course, the invention of feminist criticism. It has been part and parcel of western philosophy since its Greek inception. It gained special mo- mentum, however, with the advent of psychoanalysis in the twentieth century.4 Following Freud, who attributed to women a weak superego, namely, a shaky in- ternalization of social and moral proper judgment,5 Lacan broadened the scope, marking what he called "The Symbolic"-the whole linguistic-cultural system into which humans are born-as the domain of "The Law of the Father."6 It is no wonder that feminist attempts to unhinge this hoary gender binarism have focused on the question of language.7 It is no less surprising that challenges to the fathers' tongue originated in Paris in the 1970s, apparently as a response to and a critique of Lacan's popularity in the postwar years. This challenge took two complementary routes: One called to reject the fathers' tongue altogether by forg- 3. Toril Moi, Sexual/Textual Politics: Feminist literary Theory.

The question is what might be the purpose of this kidnapping or re-vision. Is it "subversion," as proposed by the postmodernist French wing (and some of its American followers),11 or is it "appropriation," as suggested by the mostly Amer- ican, more pragmatic wing of feminist criticism?12 This is not an easy issue to set- tle, because the definitions of these two concepts are not carved in stone and because in practice the boundaries between them seem to be rather porous. "Sub- version," in particular is used in several different senses, from the psychological to the political, and it has been applied to both author and reader.13 Nevertheless, one expectation shared by all feminist thinkers is that subversive writing (or read- 8.

Unfortunately, she found such subversive moments in the work of male writers only.

Feldman ing) should de-reify the perception of women as others or objects and re-position them as speaking subjects. This is precisely what Kahana-Carmon has achieved in the above quoted pas- sage: seeing others as they see themselves, from the position of subjects; or, as she herself had notoriously articulated in her first novel, "To see the other and to be seen as if through God's eye."'14 But there is more to it. Positional reversals of this kind (subject/object or self/other) may be generalized to include any opposition that needs to be disman- tled. Such an intention was expressed early on, in H6lne Cixous' foundational es- say, "The Laugh of the Medusa": For us the point is not to take possession in order to internalize or manipulate, but rather to dash through and to "fly."... What woman hasn't flown/stolen? Who hasn't felt, dreamt, performed, the gesture that jams sociality? Who hasn't crumbled, held up to ridicule, the bar of separation?'5 Cixous' call for the "jamming" of social and conceptual divisions is a tall or- der, not easily accomplished.16 No wonder it is often the letter rather than the spir- it of her manifesto that has been adopted and adapted in feminist discourse. Though the dual concepts of "stealing" and "subversion" of the language of patriarchy are commonplace in contemporary scholarship,17 only rarely do they reflect that kind of deconstructive impetus that does away with the "bar of separation" which Cixous so forcefully touted. "Appropriation," on the other hand, has recently gained momentum through its own "appropriation," if you will, by a younger though related theoretical field: post-colonial and minority discourse studies.'8 The analogy between these two the- oretical fields is not accidental: Colonized/minority cultures contend with a hege- monic system, the tongue of the colonizer/majority culture, facing problems similar to those faced by women vis-ga-vis the fathers' tongue of patriarchy. For both groups, the question is how to cross (or crumble) the bar of separation, how to get into the canonic system, how to seize and appropriate the means of semiotic production-while still preserving one's own "authentic" tongue and identity (postmodernist reservations about the essentialist overtones of "authenticity" notwithstanding). Simone de Beauvoir had already hinted at this analogy in her pioneering comparison between the otherness of women, blacks, and Jews.'9 Post-colonial 14.

In turn, it has clearly empowered feminist thinking, now invigorated by a broader base of "others." It should come as no surprise that solutions to post-colo- nial predicaments follow familiar routes: On the one hand, there is a call for nega- tion ("abrogation") of the hegemonic system so that it may be pragmatically appropriated for indigenous signification;20 on the other hand, a postmodern ex- pectation calls for a cultural ambivalence that would erase the bar between "mas- ter" and "slave" by jamming the binarism and going beyond it altogether. As defined by the guru of postmodern post-colonialism, Homi Bhabha, "there is only the matter of the enslaved master, the unmastered slave."21 READING AGAINST THE BIBLICAL GRAIN IN ISRAEL The "translation" of these critical debates to Israel was slow in coming. When feminist "subversive" readings were introduced into Israeli literary criticism in the early 1990s, they aroused at first fierce objection.22 The "appropriation" the- ory, on the other hand, seems to have recently gained quite a following.23 Signifi- cantly, when the call for subversion did resurface, it was recommended as a feminist strategy for both writers and readers, to be applied to any binarism in- volved in the sociocultural exclusion of women-not exclusively to the issue of the mother/fathers' tongue. It was also anchored-and this is no coincidence-in post-colonial theory.24 20.

Feldman Needless to say, like feminist subversion, the highly subversive order of post- colonial theory is not easily achieved in fictional practice.25 Yet, I would submit that a close look at Israeli fiction of the 1980s, written by both sexes, would uncover subversive narrative tactics that create "cultural ambivalence" or "the jamming of binarisms," the very goals articulated by various theoreticians. This is not to say that authors are necessarily aware of their artistic choices (although this may be the case with some). Rather, it is the theoretically-informed critic who uncovers in this cor- pus feminist and post-colonial revisions that run parallel or intertwined courses, contributing to the Israeli internal debate over its ideological infrastructure, that is, the "Zionist meta-narrative." 26 Because one of the prominent features of this nar- rative, and of Israeli culture at large, has been its dialogue with the Bible-as at- tested to by this volume-it is no wonder that the vehicle of this subversion is often a reading "against the grain" of the Bible, the classical Hebrew fathers' tongue. A. B. Yehoshua's Mar Mani (Mr. Mani),27 the much-debated novel "in the counter-direction," 28 may be considered the archetypal model for this trend. "The counter-direction," a cardinal metaphor repeatedly used in the novel (and which the author himself vigorously helped disseminate), fully captures the subversive nature of this controversial work, which takes to task not only modern Jewish his- tory, but its biblical tradition as well. Thus, the selection and treatment of biblical materials in this novel compellingly illustrate the ideological ambivalence of its author. Moreover, it also highlights the paradox inherent in the Bible 's status as a Zionist symbol. Indeed, the biblical texts privileged in this novel do not advance the Zionist-Hebrew biblical narrative. This is no return to the books of Joshua and Judges, which were endorsed by Zionist leaders as a historical model,29 but, rather, a move toward the repressed, toward biblical names and narratives whose symbol- ic valence was rejected by the Zionist imaginary. Surely it was not by chance that, although modeled on the Book of Genesis, no member of the Mani clan is named feminist and post-colonial sources, and refers both to the father/mother tongue and the private/public dichotomies. Different applications of "subversion" appear in Lubin's interpretative studies of Israeli culture, collected in her recent book (see fn. 22).

Yehoshua was not alone, however, in this endeavor. This was the decade in which Israeli novelists of both sexes paved the way for the revisionism of Israel's "new historians." Several of these novelists were women who tried their hands at a variety of subversive strategies, often wrestling with the biblical canon and the aqedah in their own ways, and-as we shall see-to very different effects. Un- fortunately, their work received little attention-an imbalance that I would like to redress in the following pages. WRESTLING WITH THE FATHERS' TONGUE IN ISRAELI WOMEN'S FICTION Of the few recent studies devoted to the presence of the Bible in the work of Hebrew women writers, only one includes fiction in its corpus.33 This is no coin- cidence. For when it comes to women writers, Israeli scholarship seems to prefer verse to fiction. As I have argued in my study, No Room of Their Own, this pref- erence derives from an outdated literary map that ignores the massive changes that have taken place recently.34 After many decades of writing mostly verse, for the past two decades Israeli 30.

Feldman, "Introduction", No Room; Lelo heder. 89</page><page sequence="8">Yael S. Feldman women have come to dominate the production of fiction, at times even taking over the bestseller lists. This boom in women's prose fiction had its beginnings in the work of several "foremothers," such as Amalia Kahana-Carmon, Shulamith Hare- ven, Netiva Ben Yehuda, and Ruth Almog, who, in the 1970s and 1980s, blazed a path in a century-old tradition of mostly male-authored Hebrew fiction. The fact that Hebrew, the language of Scripture, traditionally has been gendered as "mas- culine" (whereas Yiddish was gendered as "feminine"),35 probably intensified the feminist urge to challenge the fathers' tongue. This challenge took on many shapes, evolving in scope and intention, perhaps growing bolder with the writers' growing experience. Taking the risk of oversimplification, I would define the evolution of this challenge in female-authoredfiction as a move from appropriation to subversion. To further simplify matters, I distinguish between the two by their treatment of bi- narism: For the purposes of my analysis, "appropriation" would include any strat- egy in which the marginal or un-empowered (e.g., women) reach towards a subject position by crossing the boundaries between the two terms of an opposition-in this case, the ostensibly gendered languages (mother/fathers' tongues), without, however, unhinging the binarism itself (gender distinction in general, for exam- ple). "Subversion," on the other hand, would include the more extreme tactics through which one jars boundaries, goes beyond binarisms altogether, and, in the spirit of Derridean deconstruction, even erases the bar separating the two terms of any dualism (masculine/feminine; self/other; Jewish/gentile; master/slave, etc.). My understanding of the first stage of this process supports Tova Cohen's claim that women authors "appropriate the 'fathers' tongue,' the bearer of male culture" in order to "define their female self through its autonomous creative-in- tellectual characteristics."36 I would argue, however, that once women overcome the need to "focus on the creative-intellectual [female] self'37, they are free to in- tervene-both as women and as engaged intellectuals--in the general cultural and political public debates that storm around them. In that second stage they may ap- ply the appropriated, now internalized, "fathers' tongue" to the unsettling of the very system whence they "snatched" it. This stage fits neatly into Hannah Naveh's recent conceptualization of subversion of the private/public binarism: "A way out of the binary trap is through muddying the distinction itself, so as to weaken its ca- pacity to classify and describe."38 This developmental trajectory is not evident in all women's fiction, of course. With some variations, however, its general pattern is quite typical of sev- eral writers who, after wrestling with the Bible-each in her own way-through- out the 1960 and 1970s, read it "against its grain" in order to intervene in the political discourse of the 1980s. The most vociferous among them was Shulamith Hareven, whose Tzima'on: Shlishiyat hamidbar [Thirst: The Desert Trilogy], pub- 35.

Her "literary midrash" on the biblical narrative is an impressive exercise in subversion of all kinds. It begins by filtering the journey in the wilderness through the gaze of a mir- acle hater in a novella by that name (Sone' hanissim, or The Miracle Hater); then continues to narrate the conquest of Gibeon-in the novella Navi' (Prophet)- from the perspective of a Gibeonite seer, obviously a "false prophet" in the bibli- cal tradition; finally, the novella Aharei hayaldut (After Childhood) offers a cri- tique of a belated aqedah, focalized through a Rebecca-modeled heroine living in the time of the Judges.39 This head-on altercation with the Bible was not accomplished ex nihilo, however. As I have shown elsewhere, it can be traced to a slow evolution, spread over the first two decades of Hareven's career, in which she wrestled with the bib- lical tradition and especially with the aqedah. Originally she had followed the Jew- ish tradition, valuing the aqedah as the source of the "unique Jewish sense of morality" because it expresses "our non-acceptance of our primordial myth of ag- gression." 40 However, in her latest novella, Aharei hayaldut and in essays pub- lished following it, she judged the aqedah as one of the Western sources for the apotheosis of militarism and male aggression. Her critique of the aqedah, like Yehoshua's in Mar Mani, was apparently inspired by the provocative essay "The Isaac Syndrome," published in 1975 by the Israeli psychologist Shlomo Giora Shoham.41 Yet Hareven's analysis differs from both Shoham's and Yehoshua's in its strong feminist tone. After years of principled denial of gender difference, Hareven joined the feminist critique, ancient and contemporary alike, of the mas- culine penchant for violence and war.42 Moreover, she anchored this universal pen- chant in the aqedah, presenting it as the prototype of a long monotheistic tradition (from which women are obviously exempt) of fathers sacrificing their sons- thereby inscribing male aggression as a widely-spread cultural cornerstone. AMALIA KAHANA-CARMON: THE PATRONYMIC MODEL OF BIBLICAL APPROPRIATION Amalia Kahana-Carmon's relationship with the Bible is quite different.

Feldman ded in small increments throughout her fiction at large. Since her corpus distin- guished itself from the very beginning by a heavy reliance on scriptural allusions (among others), she may serve as the test case in our endeavor to uncover women's share in recent Israeli wrestling with the fathers' tongue. As critics were quick to notice, some of Kahana-Carmon's early fiction, which was marked by a unique syntax and by rich, elevated, often poetic diction and style, was also a veritable compendium of sources, from the Bible and the Tal- mud to mystical and medieval texts43--in the spirit of the best "male-stream" of the Jewish and Hebrew tradition. It took a while, however, for the feminist impact of her borrowings or citations to be noticed." No wonder: There is a certain ten- sion, if not a contradiction, between the stereotypically "feminine" attributes of her protagonists, and especially the mode of passive resignation in which they gener- ally operate, and the forcefulness of the biblical embeddings attached to them. To demonstrate my point, my present analysis focuses only on cases in which female protagonists are empowered through the embedding of or the allusion to biblical texts. A close look at these embeddings uncovers an intriguing fact: Most of the significant biblical sources that Kahana-Carmon appropriates for her heroines are culled from male-authored or male-centered contexts. Although this choice may strike us as being quite in agreement with the (male) mainstream of Hebrew liter- ature, it is quite out of step with a different tradition, initiated by the pioneering Hebrew women poets of the 1920s. In fact, it is precisely this preference that dis- tinguishes Kahana-Carmon from her predecessors. She seems to be rejecting this tradition precisely because it sought in the Bible, and in the Jewish heritage at large, female foremothers and "matronyms" as a way to bolster the budding sub- jectivities of those early women poets and artists.45 Kahana-Carmon chose for her protagonists a contrary direction: She first set them up to appropriate the forefa- thers' tongue, and then had them subvert that very legacy, the Jewish Symbolic Or- der. I would like to suggest that these appropriations function not as elements of defamiliarization, as some critics maintained,46 but rather as elements of empow- erment allowing the protagonists access to their androcentric (and andro-authored) cultural canon.47 This tactic took on many shapes in Kahana-Carmon's early work, most fa- 43.

This is true of two stories in the first collection, "'Im na' matza'ti hen" ("If I Found Fa- vor") and "Livnot la bayit be'eretz shin'ar" ("To Build Her/self a House/Home in the Land of Shinar"),48 as well as of her second book, the novel Veyare'ah be'emeq ayalon (And Moon in the Valley ofAjalon).49 In these titles and in other citations within the narratives themselves, a personal/private female context is often sub- stituted for the typically national/collective male connotation of the biblical source.50 The appropriation is particularly stark in the story "'Im na' matza'ti hen," wherein the title was lifted verbatim from a very familiar phrase, one that is re- peatedly used throughout the biblical narrative from Genesis to Samuel. In each of these biblical occurrences the phrase appears in a dialogue between two males, of- ten in the context of national deliverance or other similar public issues. In three in- stances, moreover, the speakers-Abraham, Moses, and Gideon-address this phrase to God. Kahana-Carmon, on the other hand, wrests away this phrase to ex- press a totally private affair. It appears within the inner monologue of a female pro- tagonist, who uses it as part of her desperate silent plea to save a failing personal relationship: i-nt*,nxlK lni .,:131.va In tvxnn-n tv-%i-r,' In'1 nx rl::l~x m ,'i ,:13x :11a2 -I'm"-1, .W11, 115 5"In" K5 n,35n -T1nYX t3K :n,1"TY'in n .nv-'T pxi1 .In ,nKYD I reflected in my heart: And I, yet am I too among those that find favor in his eyes. Please my lord, if I found favor. No way of knowing. A terrifying suspi- cion: Were I to stop moving, he would neither stop nor notice.51 To gauge the effect of Kahana-Carmon's choice, we need to consider the op- tions she had: In the book of Esther, a variant phrase-"'im matza'ti hen" (omit- ting the "na'")-is put into Esther's mouth three times. By avoiding this option, Kahana-Carmon's text seems to declare a preference for the appropriation of the fathers' tongue rather than perpetuating the language reserved in the Bible for a specific female character, whose role and position (as subject or object) has been fiercely debated in feminist criticism.52 A different appropriation of a male-centered source underlies the title of the 48.

Feldman story "Livnot la bayit be'eretz shincar." Hardly an immediately recognized bibli- cal citation, it is nevertheless a verbatim quote from Zacharia 5:11. Ironically, the feminine pronoun appearing here, "la" (for "her"), the only one in our selection from Kahana-Carmon's biblical appropriations, is nothing but a grammatical phantom. In its biblical origin, it does not relate to any female being but rather to an abstract noun, "'ephah" (a measure of corn, in some translations rendered fig- uratively as "a basket"), which happens to be gendered as feminine in Hebrew. The title phrase is taken from one of the most arcane and obscure prophetic visions, in which the prophet Zacharia envisions the elimination of "wickedness" (rish'ah, personified as female as well!) by placing it into an 'ephah, and carrying it over to the far-away Land of Shin'ar, where ostensibly a house will be built for "her" (it). Kahana-Carmon's story, on the other hand, features one of her typically miserable Israeli housewives, whose misery is doubled by being a new immigrant and a set- tler's wife in a far-away frontier town. To the rich and complex network of inter- texts pointed out by scholars,53 we need to add one that is crucial for my argument: For the average reader, the biblical association that Kahana-Carmon's title may readily bring to mind would be not Zacharia's obscure vision, but rather the Land of Shinar in Genesis 11, the locale that saw the destruction of the Tower of Babel. It is this fate of the tower/house that Zacharia no doubt had in mind when devis- ing a proper punishment for wickedness; and it is the irony of this association that a biblically-literate reader would likely read into Kahana-Carmon's contemporary title. A feminist reader, moreover, would see here an additional irony: Although the Hebrew syntax of the title is somewhat ambiguous as to the subject of the "builder" ("livnot la" can mean either to build "for her" or "for herself"), the story hardly bears out the second option. The title then is not meant to help in constructing a female subject. Rather, it is meant to protest the object position of the story's pro- tagonist; a protest that is doubly magnified once we know the source; once we know that the pronoun la originally represents not just any grammatically femi- nine object, but a "basket of wickedness," evil personified as a female, the kind that needs to be exorcised and driven out. On the diametrically opposite side to this ironic appropriation of an obscure male-authored source, we may place Kahana-Carmon's signature story, "Necima Sasson kotevet shirim" ("Necima Sasson Writes Poems").54 Here, a young school- girl slowly learns to separate her genuinely creative talent from her juvenile unre- quited infatuation with her teacher, who is named, apparently not by accident, Ezekiel. Necima comes to grips with her frustration and with the necessity to ad- just to living her life "within the rules," and to do it moreover "by our [her] own choice." She reaches this stage with the help of nothing less than ... God's answer to Job from the whirlwind!55 The readily perceived gap between the sacred source and its secular appro- priation, shocking as it may seem at first blush, was not the invention of Kahana- 53. Bargad, "Elemets of Style." 54. Bikhfifa ahat, pp. 136-51. 55. The lengthy quote (Job 38:1-19) does not cite full verses, however.

It hails from a long Hebraic tradition, beginning with medieval secular poetry through the Hebrew Renaissance at the turn of the twentieth century. What was novel about Kahana-Carmon's usage was the gender and age of the knowing and speaking subject. Although the narrative realistically "motivates" Necima's erudition by placing her in an Orthodox school, there is a certain incongruity be- tween her young age and her impressively sophisticated familiarity with the sacred sources, both'biblical and post-biblical. In this case, the appropriation of the "sub- lime" of one of the most universally known biblical figures (habitually viewed as the expression of the author's, if not the character's, "religiosity") feels quite dif- ferent from the allusion to Job used, for example, by Y. H. Brenner, in his descrip- tion of the resigned despair of the tragic protagonist of his novel, Shkhol vekishalon (Breakdown and Bereavement).56 Yet, precisely this may have been Kahana-Carmon's purpose: to unhinge the loftiness of the biblical source and force it into the mold of contemporary mun- dane female experience-even that of a very young woman.57 On the other hand, since this young woman is an aspiring artist, we may perceive the story as a He- brew and female version of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and as such, we may accept the allusion to Job as an appropriate enhancement of her position as a subject/future author. The daring of this maneuver on Kahana-Carmon's part should become more obvious when we recall that, unlike other biblical narratives (The Garden of Eden, the Saul and David sagas, Ruth, to name just a few), Job was rarely subjected to subversive appropriations until the 1980s, when a precedent was created in Hanoch Levin's play, Yisurey Iyov (The Torments ofJob).58 STANDING IN ISAAC'S PLACE: PRIVATIZING THE AQEDAH None of these early examples, however, illustrates my point as well as one of Kahana-Carmon's least transparently titled stories, "Shamayim 'aforim, nahar 'afor" ("Gray Sky, Gray River").59 Despite its unallusive title, this short story sports one of the most brazen manipulations of the aqedah, not only in the Israeli corpus, but in the Jewish tradition at large. Moreover, though at first it gives an im- pression of incongruity, this scriptural insertion stands out against the general re- duction in allusion and citation that characterize the style of this story. As implied by the title, the story takes place in England. Echoes of Virgina Woolf's tone and mood are unmistakable. The sights and sounds of a gray English landscape are filtered here through the interior monologue of a first-person Israeli narrator, who is revisiting the place after a fourteen-year absence.

Feldman ories mingle with her present impressions and especially with her grieving senti- ments over the signs of the passage of time that she perceives in the changing and aging surroundings. One of her recollections revolves around a traumatic moment she experienced while living there with her young husband, who was a student at the time: the day she was fired from her clerical work in an Israeli office. Hurt and upset, she hurries to their shabby flat only to discover on the way a magnificent sunset. Agitated, her reaction is atypical: "They fired me. But they didn't break me. The sunset. Hallelujah." Surprised and proud, she is happy to discover that "the spirit [haru'ah] is free," and that her old "scale of preferences" is breaking through "like the rainbow."60 Reaching home, she pleads with her young husband: "Alex, quickly. Come out. I want to show you: a miracle. They fired me. But they didn't break me. I was walking in the street. And what do I see: The sunset. Come, look." Her excitement does not move Alex, however. He feels wretched and lost, says the narrator, "be- cause of the wrong done to me. Because they took the bread out of our mouth."61 Although he finds the words he thinks she needs to hear-"Don't feel bad. Every- thing will fall into place. It will"-her response is again atypical: "I continued to sit in my corner of our bed, silent, my heart aching: Out there is the valley of vi- sion [gei hahizayon]. There, no doubt, it is like the dawn rising and like the song of a sacred choir reaching crescendo .... But what am I doing here instead .. ."62 When Alex repeats his consolation, the narrator takes us by surprise with the fol- lowing interior monologue: ,"-,-rinn -7n K , rn'b5 Ui rn.ri --- 7,'rn-nK 7ai nK xa nip" .ny-in nnrnrn I was still silent.

"And Isaac told him: Father, tie me hand and foot. Because the life force is insolent [shehanefesh hatzufah hee]-" and I did not go out. I can still remember the shock of recognition and disbelief I experienced when I read this passage for the first time. How dare she, I thought, apply ("ap- propriate," I would say today) this age-old, nationally-sacrosanct topos, used for hundreds of years as a metaphor for matters of life and death, of religious and na- tional survival, to describe this totally private "sacrifice": one woman's surrender of her aesthetic vision, of her love of beauty?

Today I am struck not only by the gaping distance between this aqedah and that of the author's male compatriots, especially in the Israeli political dis- course both before and after,63 but also by her unwitting anticipation of her sisters across the Mediterranean. Had she not snatched the fathers' tongue and flown off with it, just as the French feminists suggested in the 1970s? Was she not "jamming sociality" by "privatizing" and "feminizing" a cherished national symbol? Was she not destabilizing the Jewish patriarchal order by recasting one of its veteran em- blems, recently enlisted to represent oedipal tensions, as a trop for sexual/gender difference? To appreciate fully the uniqueness of her gesture, we need the help of recent scholarship. "One surprising fact leaps to the eye," says Ruth Kartun-Blum in a pi- oneering article. "The use of this charged myth is rare in the poetry of women, while almost ubiquitous in the work of their male contemporaries."64 This imbal- ance began to change, Kartun-Blum adds, only in the 1970s. However, in her sam- pling of women's poetry (mostly published in the 1980s) there is no "Isaac." Critical as these poets are, their attempt to bring to life the silenced voice of Sarah in the end upholds the gender role preserved for them by both nature and tradi- tion-that of the mother. Their appropriation of the fathers' tongue is therefore a typical feminist act of protest against the narrative gaps in the sources, but not a move toward crossing traditional gender roles. Curiously, this is not the case with women's fiction. Although not common- place, when the aqedah does surface in fiction, it is mostly through crossing the gender barrier. ITZHAK/TIZHAK: BARRIER CROSSING? NETIVA BEN YEHUDA AND RUTH ALMOG The best known case of gender crossing is that of Netiva Ben Yehuda, who in her Palmach Trilogy, published between 1981 and 1991, directly intervened in the contemporary debate over "the aqedah as a metaphor for Zionism," as she de- clared on the cover of the second volume, Miba ad la'avotot [Through the Bind- ing Ropes].65 Her cover blurb, which promises to tell directly and without embellishment "how it was to be there, on the altar, how all this business was seen from there, through the ropes of the aqedah of 1948," makes clear that she saw her- self as one of the Yitzhakim (i.e., one of the Isaacs-a masculine noun). Although Ben Yehuda stresses the need to make the shift from the identification with the heroic sacrifice of the father (as in most 1948 literature) to an identification with Isaac, the willing sacrificial lamb of her generation, this demand was not new; it had been introduced by male writers in the 1970s, often referring to their contem- porary Isaacs (not the 1948 ones) as unwilling sacrifices, as in Hanoch Levin's 1970 satirical cabaret, "Malkat ha'ambatia" ("Queen of the Bathtub") and A. B. Yehoshua's novella Bithilat kayitz 1970 (Early in Summer 1970). What was new in Ben Yehuda's statement was the insertion of a female in the subject position of 63. See Yehoshua's essay in this volume, and my essays [ns. 30, 31]. 64. "Don't Play Hide and Seek," p. 13. 65.

She further sharpened her demand to rehabilitate the women fighters of the palmach, by coining for herself the name "pnyn" (Titzhak, literally, "she who laughs"). Taking advantage of Hebrew morphology, as is her wont, she created a grammatical feminine form analogous to Itzhak (literally, "he who laughs"), there- by not only crossing gender boundaries but also underlining once again the gen- der-bias inherent in the grammatical structure of the fathers' tongue, proper names not excluded.66 Unlike Kahana-Carmon, however, Ben Yehuda remained faithful to the long Jewish and Israeli tradition of reading the aqedah as a national-collective topos. The only fictional analogoue to Kahana-Carmon's "privatization" of the topos of which I am aware appears in Ruth Almog's novel, Be'eretz gzerah (Don 't Hurry the Journey, 1971). Appropriated to express the heroine's suicidal urge, the aqedah is indirectly alluded to in the heroine's letter to her lover: Had I the strength, I would get up now from my place, take an axe and cut my own flesh as if cutting wood [for the fire]. I would be the one cutting, and the wood, and the set altar, but there would be no ram, since his horns are caught in the thicket.67 Obviously, the despair for which Almog borrows (appropriates) the aqedah is not motivated by war or national exigency. Her heroine is bound by her unrequited love affair (and on a deeper level by her frustrated Oedipal fixation), effectively sig- naling a reading that empties the aqedah of its nationalist and heroic connotation. At the same time, however, both the periphrastic language and the subjunctive mood of this allusion may point to the great discomfort the author felt while so do- ing: Isaac, the major metaphoric vehicle for acts of self-sacrifice or martyrdom, is absent from this passage; he is the gap in a list of "roles" the narrator "would have undertaken" had she had the strength. It should come as no surprise that when the suicidal/martyrological impetus does materialize at the end of the novel, it is metaphorized through a typically "matronymic" (in spirit if not literally) appro- priation: the murder of the pilegesh (concubine) from Gibeah (Judges 19). Char- acteristically, it also takes on a national, post-Holocaust connotation, thereby rejoining the long male-stream tradition of the Jewish aqedah.68 66. Mibacad lacavotot, 219.

A similar process can be detected in Kahana-Carmon's first novel, And Moon in the Valley ofAjalon (1971), but there this step is even more oblique and veiled in both expression and motivation. While riding with her alienated husband and his guest on the bare Negev roads, No'a, the female protagonist of the novel, drifts into one of her reveries, in which a door opens, inviting her to enter a fur- nace ('ur), a purifying crucible (kur hamatzref). The instantaneous result is un- predictable: a certain burden is unloaded, like a stone rolled off the well (ke'even nagol). Although set in a personal context, this recognition is followed by a series of images clearly inspired by the chronicles of medieval martyrdom or the Inqui- sition auto-da-f6: .-Tprinr ?Yv min prsni ,mr'p1-r-pr ,uWjnn 1 .?n 3 1 l~K 1.7K Ini And what is this rolling off like a stone. Liberating joy, a yearning for the aqedah, the desire to mount the stake.69 However one interprets the death wish expressed in this difficult colloca- tion,70 it is obvious that in the earlier story, "Gray Sky, Gray River," the aqedah functions differently. On one hand, it bears the clear stamp of a purely psycho- logical experience. On the other hand, it enhances the biblical source with its midrashic rewriting. Interestingly, Kahana-Carmon anticipated here strategies that would later be used by her peers for their own political purposes. The most blatant among them was the psychopolitical analysis of the aqedah suggested by Shlomo Giora Shoham in his essay, "The Isaac Syndrome," mentioned above. Shoham con- ducted his own altercation with the father's tongue by unearthing from Genesis Rabba (with the help of Shalom Spiegel but not in his spirit) the complementary images of Abraham as a Hebraic aggressive Laius, and Isaac as the "willing sac- rifice." The purpose of this exercise was to blame them (mostly "Abraham") for humanity's universal blood thirst and for the Jewish penchant to go along with it, whether as lamb to the slaughter or as complying soldiers.7' Kahana-Carmon also spliced together verses from Genesis and the Midrash (as cited in Bialik's Sefer Ha'aggadah). However, the "subject" (pun intended) of her manipulation is quite different. The speaking subject is indeed a female Isaac, but unlike Shoham's Itzhakim or even BenYehuda's Titzhakot, this she-Isaac is not bound on the altar of religious or national wars. This contemporary female "lamb" is a young woman who cannot resist her own need to placate, to give in to a stronger, usually male, will; in short, she is the victim of the staple characteriza- tion of "the feminine" in psychoanalysis, namely, masochistic passivity. avir [Roots of Air, 1986], see chap. 8 of No Room, and my "Afterword" in her new collection of sto- ries, Kol ha'osher hamufraz hazeh [All This Overestimated Bliss] (Keter, 2003): pp. 443 -73. 69.

Feldman Space limits do not allow for any elaboration here, therefore I would only mention in passing that, from a psychological perspective, Kahana-Carmon has re- turned the aqedah to its traditional place in Classical narratives: the infamous sto- ries of female sacrifice so prevalent in Greek myth and drama.72 The question is: Why did she not use the biblical analogue of these narratives-the story of Bat Yif- tah (Jephthah's daughter)? The answer is obvious, I believe, in light of Kahana- Carmon's policy of appropriations I have suggested. Only the male version of the myth will allow her a seat in 'ezrat hagvarim, if you will, of the Jewish Symbolic Order.73 Only by abrogating this myth-emptying it of its religious/national/hero- ic and oedipal content-could she hope to change perhaps the hierarchy of old bi- narisms, jostle received preferences, and make room for feminine content-even in its most regrettable expressions. Kahana-Carmon's battle was clearly double: While fighting for a seat outside 'ezrat hanashim, as she famously defined it, she was also struggling internally with feminine stereotypes (e.g., masochism and pas- sivity), which she had, unfortunately, deeply internalized.74 It is for this reason that despite her daring, she did not yet quite rip apart the barrier (mehitza) of separa- tion-she only rended it. VEYARE'AH BEcEMEQ AYALON: BETWEEN SUN AND MOON- MASCULINE SYMBOLISM UNDERCUT Kahana-Carmon was, however, well on her way. She had begun to move in this direction with the bizarre title of her first novel, Veyare'ah be'emeq ayalon (And the moon in the Valley ofAjalon). Unlike earlier citation-titles, the relation- ship of this title to the totally contemporary narrative is not transparent. As may be recalled, it is borrowed from Joshua's most triumphant moment, the staying of the celestial planets in his fight against Gibeon (Joshua 10:12). But why the bizarre syntax? What is the sense of beginning in medias res, of circumventing the more familiar opening of the verse, "Shemesh begivecon dom" ("Sun, stay still at Gibe- on")? Why does she cite only the second, dangling clause, which lacks a verb- the principal part of a sentence? The reticence concerning this question in the rich critical literature about Kahana-Carmon's fiction and about this novel in particular is rather intriguing. Is it possible that the literary community found it difficult to believe that a woman writer, especially an author of well-wrought lyrical stories, would take to task one of the Zionist foundational texts-the book of Joshua?75 For it is precisely mas- culinist power and control (signified by Joshua's cosmic control through divine power) that the female protagonist of this novel not only lacks, but actually detests. In fact, the opposition between men's power and desire for action and women's in- 72. I develop this idea further in my "Isaac or Oedipus?" 73. I am punning here on Kahana-Carmon's notorious argument that even in Israeli secularist culture women authors are still relegated [metaphorically, of course] to cezrat hanashim, the women's gallery in the synagogue. 74.

See n. 29. 100</page><page sequence="19">"A People That Dwells Alone"? activity and reflexivity (whether by choice or not) is one of the major binarisms questioned (if not subverted) in the novel. Indeed, the author's ironic view of both Joshua and his contemporary de- scendents may be responsible for her eccentric manipulation of his/their text. As the fates of style would have it, biblical parallelism offered her all she needed to replace male symbolism with female symbolism. By a simple act of omission- of the first part of Joshua's invocation-she achieved a triple substitution: moon for sun, valley for height (hill, or giv'a), and a verbal absence-zero sound-for a verb, an action. This is a shrewd technique, imperceptible, perhaps unwitting; an undercutting of the very spirit of the letter while ostensibly reproducing it verba- tim in the title. I daresay this was a transitional moment in this author's life-long struggle with the fathers' tongue, with the biblical/Zionist canon. This transition is marked by another stylistic feature that sets her appropri- ation of biblical sources apart from her peers: its postmodernist "ungrammatical- ity."76 Starting with Veyare'ah beCemeq ayalon, she developed a special form in which she loosely strung partial citations from a variety of biblical sources. The colloquial syntax of these catalogues or "mosaics,"77 and the fact that they are sur- rounded by contemporary "citations" from translated literature to popular culture (commercials and hit-parade songs), clearly fractures the system of the fathers' tongue, the Symbolic Order from which they are appropriated. Yet all this does not yet amount to subversion in the sense I suggested above. For in all of the examples we have so far examined, the jamming and the jarring of the fathers' tongue does end up empowering and magnifying the sense of self ofa female protagonist, there- by enhancing her subject position. It does not yet intervene directly in the general political discourse of the time, however. If it crosses the private/public bar of sep- aration, it does so only covertly and indirectly. UP ON MONTIFER: FEMINIST/ POST-COLONIAL SUBVERSION For this kind of subversion we must return to Kahana-Carmon's latest trip- tych, Lem"ala bemontifer (Up on Montifer), with which we opened this study. How- ever, before we explore the personal and historical context of its composition, we need to question its timing. 1984, the publication year of Up on Montifer, is a relatively late date in the career of its author. As we have seen, although she had wrestled with the fathers' tongue throughout her career, never before were her ap- propriations as gutsy and sophisticated, nor were they directed at fundamental bib- lical/Zionist tenets as in this late narrative. Moreover, here the biblical sources are appropriated not for a female protagonist, but rather for some anonymous male "others," the dark horsemen of the opening. What had changed? To sharpen my question, let me briefly mention that this is not the first time that the phrase "'am levadadyishkon" ("A people that dwells alone") is appropri- 76.

For wherever she is, that is the heart of what is going on. Nevertheless, and at the heart of it, a peo- ple that dwells alone. Needs no one. Needy more than anyone else, yet not needy-what is the secret of this mystery. 78 On its own, without the support of the allusions to the conquest of Canaan from Numbers 32, Balaam's description of the Israelites loses its strong nationalistic res- onance. Though articulated here by a male protagonist whose reliability is suspect, it is readily absorbed by the ostensible feminine context surrounding it. We im- mediately recognize here Kahana-Carmon's staple feminist technique of individ- ualizing and feminizing her biblical appropriations. Not so in Up on Montifer, or more accurately in the novella "The Bridge of the Green Duck" that constitutes its major narrative. A more radical impulse seems to be at work there, one tinged with post-colonial consciousness. As it happened, the immediate inspiration for this change was Kahana-Carmon's first visit to the United States in 1980, as a participant in the Iowa International Writers Program. As she herself recently recalled, it was there that she was for the first time intro- duced to the work of the father of post-colonial criticism, Frantz Fanon.79 Wed- ding his analysis of the otherness of race (Black Skin, White Masks)80 to the critique of gender otherness in the tradition of Simone de Beauvoir (The Second Sex),8' she came up with the exceptional novella, "The Bridge of the Green Duck," in which she adroitly embedded feminist protest within the general paradigm of"oth- erness," successfully probing and comparing not only its major categories-gen- der, class, and race-but also its very principles. In fact, she was the first Israeli author to give fictional expression to these principles that were just beginning to percolate then among Israeli "new historians" and "revisionist" literary critics (we may recall that Benny Morris published his first book, The Birth of the Palestin- ian Refugee Problem, in 1987!).82 And what would be a better vehicle for such a probe than a subversive rewriting of the fathers' tongue, and particularly those bib- lical sources that epitomize self-centered ("naturally" male) nationalism and self- righteous (same) voluntarism? Let there be no mistake: Kahana-Carmon does not negate, nor does she crit- icize the ideas conveyed by her intertexts. She only denies the natural one-direc- 78. Veyare'ahbe'emeq ayalon, p. 30. 79.

She erases that natural marriage, forcing her readers to consider-no, to experience-the possibility that an other, someone else, may occupy precisely the same subject position. In the opening of the novella, this other is the gentile oppressor, the enemy of the Jewish protagonists. Yet, as the plot thickens, its feminist/minority protest resurfaces: By using precisely the same biblical phrases, the same subject position is attributed to the Jewish female narrator. And not only to her. In this shuffling of the biblical cards the narrator is joined by her friend and companion, Eved hakushi, a liberated slave, a black ex-captive: ,rriir rt--,wrx pu I~nT -Is''rUn ,llmw '- ,m iinnnurnn ?a "i '51Y And my brother is a free man, I felt, free like a bird, [full of] inner conviction. Ours is the conviction of an exclusive sect, a superior sect that crosses before the camp, a people of conquering pioneers that dwells alone. 84 The almost verbatim repetition of this focal biblical allusion is neither "improba- ble" nor a part of Kahana-Carmon's "oxymoronic poetics," as suggested by one bewildered scholar groping to understand its meaning.85 Rather, this was a pre- meditated subversive strategy, still not properly appreciated, that created cultural ambivalence and crumbled several bars of separation. Consequently, it cleared a space in the Israeli canon for a postmodern, multicultural feminism that draws its power from a unique grafting of the general discourse of the other onto the age- old biblical language of national particularity.86 Yael S.
