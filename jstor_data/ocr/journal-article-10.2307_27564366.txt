<plain_text><page sequence="1">Martha Himmelfarb. A Kingdom of Priests: Ancestry and Merit in Ancient Judaism. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 2006. 270 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001232 In this important new book, Martha Himmelfarb focuses on the tension between birth and obedience that is inherent in the notion of a covenantal people. The struggle between ancestry and merit becomes apparent on two differ ent levels: the one in relation to the priests and the other in relationship to the whole people of Israel. An Israelite priest is a priest by birth, but does he deserve to be a priest if he is disobedient to God's law? What of the people? Do they deserve their chosenness, or are they just lucky? Examining various lit eratures from the third century BCE until the sixth century CE, Himmelfarb demonstrates how the different communities that produced this diverse literature resolved this troubling issue. While all depend on the Torah and accept its auth ority, they work through this tension?which is already manifest in the Torah's pages?in various and often innovative ways. In the first chapter, Himmelfarb discusses several of the earliest Second Temple literary documents, the Book of Watchers (Enoch), the Wisdom of Ben Sira, and Aramaic Levi. In these documents, the issue at hand is the worthiness of the priestly class. With every document, Himmelfarb examines the language and 400</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews representation of priests compared to the newly emerging class, the scribes, uncover ing a tension in each around ancestry and merit. This tension descends from a concern that priests, the chosen servants of God, may not all deserve their post, for they are priests not by merit but by birth primarily. These texts, however, do not resolve this issue so much as express the tension. Himmelfarb concludes that these documents all share a tendency to promote merit, at times even at the expense of ancestry, but without subverting the notion of ancestral status entirely. In her second chapter, Himmelfarb argues that the author of the Book of Jubilees is more concerned with the people of Israel as a whole than with the priestly class in and of itself. To that end, the author promotes the notion of a kingdom of priests by moving all of the people of Israel into the priestly class. Following the rhetoric of H (the Holiness Code of pentateuchal source criticism), all of Israel is now responsible, as a priestly nation, for maintaining its holy status. The Book of Jubilees focuses primarily on the issues of eating blood, forbidden sexual relations, circumcision, and the calendar. The historical context of the book, the Maccabean revolt, the expansion of the Maccabean empire, and the incorporation of other peoples into the Judean sociopolitical fra mework most likely provoked this writer to action. In his estimation, Israel/Judea is special, different, separate, holy?one cannot simply become an Israelite/Judean by choice or royal decree?it is acquired exclusively by birth. Ancestry remains primary for him. Yet unlike the sectarians to be discussed in the next chapters, the author of Jubilees does not give up on all of Israel. Rather, he insists that every last Israelite live up to his or her holy name. In Chapter 3, Himmelfarb demonstrates that the Temple Scroll and 4QD (the material from the Damascus Document found in Qumran Cave 4) attempt to make the Torah's purity laws more relevant to nonpriestly Israelites without necessarily making all of Israel into a priestly nation. They do so by intensifying the laws, though not in the same way, and not, she argues, as part of one coherent halakhic system, for the scrolls often contradict each other. Moreover, the larger issue is not a tension between ancestry and merit so much as how all of Israel should behave in respect to purity issues. The Temple Scroll, for instance, presents itself as an alternative text or law book. It often lengthens the period of waiting (for purifi cation), as well as adding stringencies to the purification processes. 4QD, on the other hand, tends more toward clarifying the lacuna of the levitical laws of purity, often by adding other stringencies. Nonetheless, these two documents share a concern for tightening the purity laws, even as their approaches differ so that all of Israel can be more meticulous and thereby more meritorious. The end result is a spreading of the restrictions that had been reserved for priests alone in the priestly texts of the Torah (identified by source critics as P), outward to all of Israel, as well as a heightening of restrictions on the priests themselves. In her fourth chapter, Himmelfarb examines several other Dead Sea Scrolls within their context as sectarian literature in comparison to another corpus of sec tarian literature, that of the emergent Jesus movement. These texts, unlike their predecessors, transcend ancestry in favor of merit. On the one hand, those texts from the Dead Sea (in this case the Damascus Document and the Rule of the Com munity), when discussing criteria for membership in their community, downplay 401</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews the role and ancestry of priests in favor of membership by merit. Any Israelite is eligible (whether priest or lay), but not all will make it. The book of Revelation, on the other hand, while also constructing community membership based solely on merit, opens its doors even to Gentiles. Himmelfarb argues that the Rule of the Community and Revelation make similar moves by employing opposite strategies: The Rule of the Community downplays the priests such that they play little role in the leadership of the community, and membership in the community is by merit alone. In contrast, Revelation makes all the members, whose righteousness grants them membership, into priests. Himmelfarb notes, however, that while the Rule of the Community transcends ancestry by its division of the world into the children of light and the children of darkness, it still retains some sense of ancestry, as it is understood that the children of light are all Israelites by birth, no Gentiles are expected. Hence, its vision is not nearly as radical as Revelation's. The Alexandrian writers, Philo and the author of the Letter of Aristeas, are Himmelfarb's focus in Chapter 5. These diasporic philosophical writers appear less concerned with priesthood and purity issues in general, perhaps because of their distance from Jerusalem and hence the noncentrality of the Temple in their daily lives. Yet neither do they dismiss these issues entirely, as the Temple, its functionaries, and its cult remain symbolic of who they are as Diaspora Jews. Aris teas, while upholding the legitimacy of the priesthood, finds the seventy Alexan drian scribes who translated the Torah into Greek more laudatory than any priests. The scribes, at least, exemplify merit, wisdom, and skill. Philo, too, never criti cizes the priesthood or the cult but attempts to show that all of Israel started out as priests (demonstrated by the first Passover sacrifice performed by all Jews on the first Passover in Egypt) and that that national priestly action becomes the archetypical model for the priesthood that develops later. In this chapter, Himmel farb argues that these authors look for creative ways to support the merit ("priest liness") of their nation, perhaps in the eyes of other nations, without criticizing the established authority of the priesthood. In the final chapter, Himmelfarb traces a return to ancestry over merit and an emphasis on the merit of the forefathers as means to salvation/redemption in the post 70 era. This reembracing of ancestry as primary is a process that develops out of a reaction to (1) sectarian exclusiveness that defines Second Temple internal politics and (2) Christian inclusiveness that comes to dominate the late antiquity religious worldview that prioritized merit over birth. Himmelfarb argues that the rabbis, con structing themselves as a meritocracy, see no place for a priestly hierarchy in Israel. Contra Himmelfarb here, I would argue rather that the rabbis transform the priestly hierarchy once again. No longer valuing priestly ancestry per se, the rabbis construct a scaled-back hierarchy based on mystical or ascetical merit among otherwise equal rabbis. In my mind, some rabbis do prove to be more holy than others. Overall, while I might quibble with some of Himmelfarb's textual readings and translations, I found her argument compelling and interesting. The tension between birth and merit, both for the priests and for Israel, readily apparent from the biblical texts, begs for interpretation. Nonetheless, some of her authors take this issue as central to their own arguments, while to others it remains periph eral. Thus, a comparison between the Letter of Aristeas and Jubilees is never that 402</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews straightforward. Yet how this tension has been highlighted, resolved, or left untouched in the ancient world continues to resonate into our own day and our own concerns in the modern world.
