<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nahma Sandrow, ed. God, Man, and Devil: Yiddish Plays in Translation. Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 1999. xii, 321 pp. Robert Skloot, ed. The Theater of the Holocaust. Vol.II. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1999. viii, 407 pp. It has been a quarter century since the last collections of Yiddish plays were published in America: Joseph Landis' Great Jewish Plays and David Lifson's Epic and Folk Plays of the Yiddish Theater. As Sandrow informs us in the "Appendix- es," translations of a few individual plays are found in scholarly journals or most- ly out-of-print books. For this reason alone, the beautiful new volume from Syra- cuse is a welcome arrival. Another reason is Sandrow's insightful introductions to the five plays featured: Jacob Gordin, God, Man, and Devil; Peretz Hirshbein, Green Fields; H. Levick, Shop; David Pinsky, The Treasure; and Osip Dimov, Bronx Express. Her remarks touch on the works' stage history detailing who played what role, and how the plays fared on various European and American stages. Landis' governing principle in selecting plays was popularity; Lifson's was 185</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review a particular dramatic genre. Sandrow's mix, on the other hand, seems to be aiming for variety. Thus, we find serious drama dealing with complex religious/existen- tial questions (Gordin, Pinsky), plays about the working-class immigrant experi- ence (Dimov and Levick), and a folk romance (Hirschbein). Some works are set in Eastern-Europe (Hirschbein, Pinsky, Gordin), while others depict the American milieu (Levick, Dimov). These plays, as Sandrow indicates, do exist in other English translations, in some cases versions used only for a particular production and thus never properly published. Overall, Sandrow renders the Yiddish in more idiomatic, present-day American English than her predecessors, which may make the plays more attrac- tive to interested directors or producers. Sandrow's inclusion of Green Fields, how- ever, is rather puzzling since the play is readily available in the Landis anthology. One wishes that more unknown plays would be made accessible in English. (The Dybbuk, for example, is available in no fewer than four different translations: Lan- dis, Morris Engel, Golda Werman, and Joachim Neugroschel.) This said, Sandrow's selection, like Lifson and Landis' choices, shows the richness of the Yiddish stage. What sets this anthology apart is the inclusion of Shop and Bronx Express, two excellent examples of artistic representations of ear- ly immigrants' struggle to make it in America, to become so-called allrightniks, successful Jews in the new land, di goldene medine. The American public is fa- miliar with these difficult times for newly-arrived Jews from the prose of such im- migrant writers as Abe Cahan and Anzia Yezierska and the moving poetry of such giants as Moshe-Leib Halperin and A. Leyeles. I suspect that of the five plays, these two will attract the most attention, as they touch directly on American histo- ry. It would be wonderful if producers recognized the greatness of all these plays, especially Gordin and Hirschbein's classics, and took a chance by staging them. After all, superstars like Maurice Schwartz, Rudolph Schildkraut, Jacob P. Adler, Celia Adler, and Ida Kaminska have all played in them to great success. In 1982, Robert Skloot published the first English-language anthology of plays on the Shoah, The Theater of the Holocaust. Soon after, Elinor Fuchs edited another volume, Plays of the Holocaust-An International Anthology. In 1996, I published my own edited book of Israeli plays, Israeli Holocaust Drama. In this 1999 volume, Skloot features six plays similar in theme and style to the four in- cluded in the 1982 volume. Skloot was also the first to write a critical study of this slowly emerging dramatic genre, The Darkness We Carry--The Drama of the Hol- ocaust. Ten years later, Edward Isser wrote Stages of Annihilation-Theatrical Representations of the Holocaust; this year, Claude Schumacher, the editor of The- ater Research International, put out a collection of seventeen essays by various dra- ma scholars and theater practitioners, Staging the Holocaust-The Shoah in Dra- ma and Performance. In his introduction to the 1982 volume, Skloot listed five objectives of"se- rious playwrights who are drawn to this forbidding part of recent history: honor- ing the victims, teaching history to audiences, evoking emotional responses, dis- cussing ethical issues, and suggesting solutions to universal, contemporary problems" (p. 14; also quoted in The Darkness We Carry, p. 10). Clearly, Skloot's criteria for judging Holocaust plays is a mixture of educational and moral values. 186</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Fuchs, on the other hand, argues that a good Holocaust play is one that "showed cat- astrophic historical events as collective catastrophe ... dramatic interest focused on the fate of the community ... arousing disturbing emotions of rage, revulsion, helplessness" (Introduction, p. xii). Fuchs contrasts this type of play with unnamed family melodramas, supposedly American works, where the focus is on the indi- vidual or family. I imagine she is thinking of such works as Barbara Lebow's A Sheyne Meydl, Jon Robin Baitz's Substance of Fire, or Emily Mann's Annulla, An Autobiography. The majority of plays in Skloot's edited volumes are the type that Fuchs prefers; the one exception in Vol.II would probably be The Model Apartment, a Donald Margulies piece about the fate of a couple of Brooklyn Holocaust survivors trying desperately to rid themselves of their troublesome daughter. For some rea- son, most of the plays are British: Howard Brenton, Hess is Dead; Christopher Hampton, The Portage to San Christobal ofA.H. (based on a story by George Stein- er); Bernard Kops, Dreams ofAnne Frank; and Roy Kift, Camp Comedy. The Mar- gulies play and Lenny Sack's The Survivor and the Translator are the only Amer- ican works. As noted, most of these plays treat the Shoah, in Fuchs' words, as a "collec- tive catastrophe"; stylistically, they are surrealistic, absurdist dramas. Their sub- jects include work about a fake Rudolf Hess in the famous Spandau prison, a ninety-year-old Hitler found by Israeli intelligence agents in the Brazilian jungle, and an Anne Frank who acts as a critic of her diary and fantasizes about life be- yond the attic. Margulies' play, the most commercially successful of the group, has stirred up a great deal of controversy by its use of comedy and the grotesque in depicting such serious Shoah issues as the relationship between first- and second- generation survivors. Style and structure aside, these plays engage us in a variety of interesting and stimulating ways. Given the recent scholarly and media wranglings over the Anne Frank diary and its various stage and screen reincarnations, Kops' Dreams ofAnne Frank is particularly intriguing. One of the hotly debated points is whether the reworkings of the diary in American culture have, as Cynthia Ozick argued in The New Yorker (October, 1997), done more bad than good for Holocaust memo- ry and history. There and elsewhere in print, Ozick criticizes writers, directors, and Broadway producers for stripping the diary of its Jewishness, sanitizing the Holo- caust, and treating the public to what The New York Times critic Frank Rich calls "a sentimental, generic slab of postwar optimism exemplified by Anne's curtain line: 'I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are really good at heart' " (November 23, 1997). To be sure, Kops' play is a different kind of Anne Frank play from the ones Ozick so passionately rejects. Not only is this a very Jewish play, but it is also one that manages to demystify its main character. In Kops' own words, Dreams ofAnne Frank accomplishes this by "taking another route, finding that specific human being, stripping away the deification and bringing her down to earth" (quoted by Skloot in his "Introduction," p. 23). Roy Kift's Camp Comedy is an exploration of the sensitive and controversial question of Jewish collaboration in the camps and ghettoes. This is a moving ac- count of the real-life experiences of Kurt Gerron, a Jewish actor and director, a 187</page><page sequence="4">AJS Review prisoner at Theresienstadt. In the summer of 1944 he is given the task of produc- ing a propaganda documentary about the ghetto for Nazi public-relations purpos- es, essentially implicating him and his crew in a big deception game. However, this game-immoral as it may have been-had one very beneficial side to it: It made survival more tolerable for both the shooting crew and the subjects filmed. Kift's treatment of collaboration (some prefer the term "cooperation") invites compar- isons with Joshua Sobol and Motti Lerner, two Israeli dramatists who have dealt with this theme in Ghetto (1984) and Kastner (1985), respectively. Hopefully, Skloot's volume will generate more scholarly interest in this fascinating subject. It seems that Kops, Kift, Sobol, and Lerner are trying very hard to respond to what they perceive as the mystification of Holocaust victims. By showing them as human beings complete with admirable qualities but also with weaknesses and short- comings, these victims become people with whom we can more easily identify. At times, choosing-between bad and worse, never between good and bad-meant resorting to less than honorable actions, but as these dramatists see it, when sur- vival is at stake, honor and morality have to wait.
