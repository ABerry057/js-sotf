<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HEBREW FIRST CRUSADE CHRONICLES: FURTHER REFLECTIONS by ROBERT CHAZAN Ohio State University In a previous article, I studied the short and anonymous Hebrew First Crusade chronicle.' The choice of text S as the starting point for an in- vestigation of the three surviving records of Jewish suffering and heroism in 1096 was a natural one. The text, as it now stands, constitutes a well- organized and coherent unit, broken off suddenly during the depiction of the destruction of Mayence Jewry. While it is certain that the chronicler did not witness personally all the events which he described, he did integrate his written and oral sources into an account which exhibits a broad and consis- 1.

Like S, L is based on a series of written and oral sources. The editor of L, however, was less adroit than the editor of S in fusing his sources into a satisfying unit. Because of this lack of grace, the hand of the editor is more apparent in L, although the precise dimensions of his role cannot be fully clarified on the basis of the texts currently available. While the problems associated with L are vexing, its richness of detail and its power necessitate an effort to clarify some of these problems and to suggest tentative solutions. Many of our con- clusions will be speculative; the state of the text and its sister texts will allow no more. * * * The historical writings of medieval Ashkenazic Jewry tend to be cir- cumscribed and episodic in nature. Numerous descriptions of specific events have survived, leaving the distinct impression that many similar records have disappeared over the ages.3 In a few instances Ashkenazic Jews tried their hand at depicting broader developments, by weaving a number of inci- dents into a connected narrative. The level of achievement varied. In the case of R. Ephraim of Bonn's account of post-i 146 crises, what emerged was nothing more than a melange of specific occurrences, with no organiz- ing scheme whatsoever.4 By contrast, R. Ephraim left a coherent chronicle of the events associated with the Second Crusade, beginning with the efforts of Bernard of Clairvaux on behalf of the Jews, proceeding to a description of sporadic persecution in Germany, France, and England, moving on to a discussion of the return to relative normalcy, and concluding with general observations on the limited achievements of the Second Crusade and an 2.

The goal of L is a broad one-the chronicling of a series of disasters related to the First Crusade. The achievement falls somewhere in the middle range, more impressive than the haphazard collection of post- 1 146 materials compiled by R. Ephraim of Bonn and less impressive than the cohesive chronicles of R. Ephraim for 1146-47 and of S for 1095-96. To begin on a positive note, L is clearly not a random compilation. It opens with the call- ing of the First Crusade, details the catastrophes that struck Central Euro- pean Jewry, and concludes with a gleeful rendition of the downfall of Peter the Hermit and the German bands that had decimated Rhineland Jewry. This is surely not accidental. The work was constructed by its editor in such a way as to present a total portrait of Jewish fate during the First Crusade. The achievement of L does not, however, reach the level of R. Ephraim or of S. Rather than a smooth account, L is broken up into a series of units. These include: (1) the development of the First Crusade and the attacks on the Jewish communities of Speyer, Worms, and Mayence;6 (2) the fate of Cologne Jewry, including the assault in Cologne itself, with few casualties, and the subsequent killing of most of Cologne's Jews in the seven neighbor- ing castles to which they had fled for safety and security;7 (3) incidents in a number of additional Jewish communities;8 (4) praise for those who were forcibly converted, yet remained loyal Jews;9 (5) the decimation of the pop- ular crusading bands that had clustered around Peter the Hermit and subse- quently around lesser figures like Emicho of Leinigen, with explicit prayers that similar disasters be visited on those still joining the crusading effort.'0 The chronicler thus strung together a series of accounts in order to fashion his portrait of Jewish fate during the First Crusade. While this is in fact what R. Ephraim of Bonn did for the Second Crusade and S did for at least part of the First Crusade, the results in L are a bit less impressive. The technique 5.

Ephraim and by S. Having said this, we must proceed to ask whether it is possible to iden- tify more fully the contributions of the chronicler. To be sure, he organized the narrative and supplied the necessary transitions from unit to unit. Beyond this, is it possible to indicate more specifically his role in the com- position of the separate units out of which the chronicle is fashioned? This involves the following question: For each of the five units, is the chronicler an author, a compiler, or an incorporator? That is to say, did he actually write the section in its entirety; did he build it out of preexistent fragments; or did he simply add a total unit to his lengthy composite work? Clearly there is no reason to anticipate one role only for the chronicler. He may have functioned variously in all three modes. It seems quite likely that the last section, depicting the downfall of the popular crusading bands, was written by the editor himself. This is not the kind of material that would be independently in existence in the Jewish com- munity; there is a definite sense that this description was penned by the editor as a fitting conclusion to his work. The point of this conclusion was to show that the process of divine retribution was already under way and to beseech the Lord to intensify the punishment of those who had savagely murdered the Jews. It is likewise possible that the fourth segment, depicting the loyalty of those forcibly converted, was composed by the editor. This too very much has the flavor of an editorial comment composed for this par- ticular setting. It is with respect to the first three sections that the problem is most dif- ficult and in some cases insoluble. Continuing to work backward, we shall deal first with the third segment, which describes the fate of a series of Jewish settlements. The opening paragraph of this section was almost cer- tainly penned by the editor himself. Just as the enemy accomplished their designs against the foregoing com- munities, as we have indicated, so too did they accomplish their designs against other communities. ... 1 Thus the organization of this unit can be readily attributed to the editor. Whether he actually composed the accounts concerning Treves, Metz, Regensburg, and xSv or simply compiled written reports available to him is 11. N &amp; S, p. 25; Habermann, p. 52. 82</page><page sequence="5">FIRST CRUSADE CHRONICLES a matter of speculation. Thus the chronicler may have functioned as author of the third unit, compiler of the third unit, or a combination of both. It may be noted, however, that the four descriptions-Treves, Metz, Regensburg, and x5t--are quite dissimilar. While the depiction of Treves Jewry and its fate is highly detailed, the remaining three stories are extremely cursory. Omitted, for example, are the exact dates of the tragedies, which are normal- ly specified. It thus seems likely that the vague reports on Metz, Regens- burg, and x5vt were penned by the editor himself, based on loose oral reports; the detailed recitation of events in Treves was probably introduced from a written local source. We can thus tentatively suggest that in the third unit the chronicler was both author and compiler. The role of the editor with regard to the Cologne unit is yet more problematic. Here the transitional observation is extremely brief-"Now I shall tell what the community of Cologne did, how they sanctified God's unique and sublime name."'2 Three possibilities present themselves: (1) the chronicler himself composed the entire unit; (2) he compiled this section from sources available to him; (3) the editor of the chronicle simply utilized an already available unit, which he introduced with the brief sentence just now quoted. I see at the present time no way of deciding definitively among these three alternatives. In any case, no matter who constructed the Cologne unit, it is quite well organized. It begins with a broad look at the entire period of this Jewish community's suffering. On the fifth of Sivan, the eve of Shavuot [= May 29, 1096], the news reached the city of Cologne .... They began to murder Cologne's Jews from Shavuot [=May 30] down to the eighth of Tammuz [=July 1].13 After this overview, the editor or subeditor depicts the attacks in Cologne itself. This initial assault resulted in only a few Jewish casualties. On the tenth of Sivan, the bishop of Cologne removed the Jews from Cologne to seven neighboring locales, in a misguided effort to save them from harm. The narrative then follows the relentless attacks on these Jewish refuges, which resulted in the almost total decimation of the once proud community. The unity of the account, which is indicated at the outset, is reinforced by the closing paragraph. 12. N &amp; S, p. 17; Habermann, p. 43. 13. Ibid. 83</page><page sequence="6">ROBERT CHAZAN Of all the seven towns into which the community of Cologne had been dis- persed, only those few in the town of Kerpen were saved.14 The Cologne segment, whoever might have been responsible for it, is surely a cohesive unit. This brings us to the first unit. In its broad outlines, this unit is a well- organized narrative of the opening attacks on Rhineland Jewry. It begins with a rapid sketch of the development of the First Crusade and the evoca- tion of anti-Jewish hostility, proceeds to brief accounts of the assaults in Speyer and Worms, and focuses on the catastrophe that destroyed the great Jewish community of Mayence. As with the third unit, it seems likely that the editor functioned as both author and compiler. There can be no doubt that the introductory statements in this section were written by the chronicler himself. At the same time, a series of lapses affords us the firmest evidence of the process of compilation of preexistent written sources. These signs of utilization of written sources fall into three categories. The first is simple and obvious maladroitness in organization. Thus, for ex- ample, the account of events in Mayence begins, quite properly, with the news of the disasters at Speyer and Worms. In a panic, the Jews of Mayence both prayed to their God and sought out the temporal authorities who could seemingly offer immediate protection. At this point, however, the chronological account is interrupted by the threat of Duke Godfrey to destroy the Jews prior to leaving for the Crusade and the Jewish success in fending off this danger through a combination of appeal to the emperor and bribery of the duke. This story clearly breaks the thread of continuity. The chronicler seems to have decided to introduce it into his Mayence account because of the role that R. Kalonymus of Mayence played in eliciting imperial support. The results, however, are far from satisfactory. This inter- ruption is followed by a second, consisting of reflections on God's decision to allow the destruction of these Jews and the distorting slogans of the Crusaders which sounded inter alia the theme of God's abandonment of the Jews. Yet a third interpolation traces the announcing of the Crusade by the pope and the perversion of this call into an appeal for violence against the Jews, developments which had already been indicated. It is only with the story of the woman and her goose that we are brought back to Mayence and 14. N &amp; S, p. 24; Habermann, p. 52. 84</page><page sequence="7">FIRST CRUSADE CHRONICLES the burgeoning tensions in that particular city. There is in all this the strong sense of an editor who has not been fully successful in integrating materials that stood, in written form, at his disposal. The same sense flows from a second category of lapses, namely, internal repetitions. In the poorly organized opening remarks on Mayence Jewry we note one instance of such repetition, where the chronicler repeats in modified form the description of the onset of the Crusade which he had already supplied earlier. A second example of the same lapse can be found in the dual description of the negotiations with the bishop of Mayence. At the outset of the report on Mayence, the editor depicts vividly the fear that gripped the Jews and their turn to the local authorities. Later on in the same ac- count, when he speaks of the arrival of the hated Emicho, he adds a second description of negotiations with the local authorities. It might be suggested that this second report is a background reminder of successful negotiations, meant to serve as a foil to the unsuccessful efforts with Emicho. This, however, is not the case. The second report is quite full, containing a number of details not available in the first. Again the sense is one of pre- existent sources poorly fused. Finally, there are occasionally inconsistencies that point in the same direction. Thus, for example, the narrative on Mayence begins with reports arriving concerning the attack in Speyer and the two assaults in Worms, the second taking place on Sunday the first of Sivan (=May 18, 1096). Hearing this, the Jews went to the bishop and begged aid. His response was to sug- gest that they sequester themselves in his palace. Yet, further on in the ac- count, there is a story about voices heard in the synagogue on the previous Friday night. From this story it is clear that, by Friday May 16, most of Mayence's Jews had already left their homes and fled to fortified places. From all three types of lapses, we gain the impression of a compilation of written records, with the editor failing to integrate fully his source materials. This analysis has been of necessity lengthy and detailed. It therefore seems wise to present the major conclusions: (1) The chronicle as a whole is not a haphazard melange but reveals the hand of an editor who provided sensible and meaningful organization. (2) Of the five major units of which the chronicle is constructed, two were probably written by the editor himself (units 4 and 5); two were partly authored and partly compiled from available written reports (units 1 and 3); and one may have been authored, compiled, or fully incorporated (unit 2). The chronicler thus emerges as pos- 85</page><page sequence="8">ROBERT CHAZAN sessor of both written and oral reports, sometimes shaping these reports in his own words and sometimes quoting them at length in his narrative. * * * It is obviously of some importance to raise the issue of dating. More precisely, is it possible to determine the point at which the editor collated and integrated his sources into the narrative as we now have it?"5 In view of our conclusion that L is a composite work, the sources upon which it is based could surely have been composed at an earlier date. Many students of this text have been struck by the feeling of immediacy in the material. It is rich in detail and suffused with the kind of passionate feeling that smacks of a contemporary record. It is of course both possible and probable that the original sources out of which the chronicle was in part composed were writ- ten as local reports at the time of the tragedy itself. This leaves open, however, the question of when these reports were organized into the com- prehensive chronicle which we now possess. In attempting to deal with this issue, we must begin with an observation concerning the terminus ad quem. It has often been suggested that this ren- dition of Jewish fate during the First Crusade was penned on the eve of the Second Crusade, in order to warn Jews of impending dangers and to impress upon them the ideal of martyrdom. However, a close reading of the text shows no allusion whatsoever to a new crusade. On the contrary, it seems most unlikely that a new crusade could have been in the offing without leav- ing some significant imprint in the edited text. It thus is plausible to date the chronicle some time prior to the mid-1140s.'6 A discussion of the dating of L must next address itself to the brief pas- sage which seemingly offers direct evidence as to the date of composition. This passage, which has been widely quoted, remains highly problematic. The observation comes in the midst of the depiction of the downfall of Cologne Jewry. These Jews had been dispersed into seven fortified towns in order to afford them protection. The chronicler then traces the fate of each 15. The following analysis of the dating of L represents, it will be clear, a repudiation of the suggestion of early dating for L made in my previous study. The issue of the dating of S remains problematic. There is nothing in S to necessitate a late date of composition. 16. In the closing paragraph of his narrative, the chronicler notes an eclipse of the sun and a concomitant slaughter of Crusaders. He adds: "But the enemy have still not desisted from their evil designs. Every day they set forth for Jerusalem." This hardly sounds like the onset of the Second Crusade. For evidence in R. Ephraim's chronicle of the rumblings of the Third Crusade, see Chazan, "R. Ephraim of Bonn's Sefer Zechirah," pp. 120-23. 86</page><page sequence="9">FIRST CRUSADE CHRONICLES of these seven groups, all but one of which were destroyed. After describing the martyrdom of the Jews at xK5', the fourth of these unavailing refuges, the chronicler adds: TE nx nSxuw Own .KXYlX U Y mKn nnpnYn p12oiw 13V n 3o X SK1I .ti1? p"nn rw n3 n nY 7.n.t; Wirp 5 11D D1 ,-3iE vY 1:n 1i 53 x'zx Dn 'yDin ,nIWYDn 57 DvTpin Critical here are the first five words--nO 7"nn n3m nian ; y. This phrase has often been taken to mean: "At this point it is 4900 [= 1140]." As noted by a number of observers, this is simply not the meaning of the Hebrew expres- sion. These words can only mean: "Thus far the events of 4900." Such a statement makes no sense in the midst of an ongoing description of Jewish fate in 1096. The one suggestion that makes some sense of this troublesome clause was advanced by Ismar Elbogen.'8 The description of the tragedy at Kxa^K ends with the burial of the martyred Jews by those forcibly converted. During this effort they discovered a Jewess still alive among the corpses. They restored this woman to health, although the memory of the horror which she had survived remained with her for the rest of her life. As a result of her experience, she subsequently instituted harsh restrictions on her eating habits. Elbogen proposes that the difficult v " -rnn r n av T7 -u be joined to the conclusion of the previous passage to read as follows: w:3v u' mn3T ni n r5 ,31? 01 n K?K x5x 5*x xi n1 5? 3nyn ,i 5 nw m n1n iniKxi .u-lib p"nn nmy nni v y ,'iTvnn wiim And from that day forth, she fasted every day, eating only once per day, except for Sabbaths and holidays and new moons, down till now, the year 4900 [= 1140].19 While possible, this suggestion of Elbogen is far from convincing. Methodologically, it thus seems wise to suspend judgment temporarily on this clause and to examine the text carefully for additional clues as to possi- ble dating. 17. N &amp; S, p. 21; Habermann, p. 48. In view of our analysis of this segment of the chronicle, it is possible: (1) that Solomon bar Samson is the person responsible for the entire chronicle; (2) that Solomon bar Samson is responsible for the Cologne unit; (3) that he is responsible for the account of a,'K alone. 18.

N &amp; S, p. 21; Habermann, p. 48. 87</page><page sequence="10">ROBERT CHAZAN Two studies have focused on the concluding segment of the chronicle as the key to its dating. Yitzhak Baer has argued that, from the lack of reference to the capture of Jerusalem, it can be deduced that the original text which he postulates was composed prior to 1099.20 In my earlier study, I claimed that, from the lack of reference to the decimation of Peter the Her- mit's hosts at Civetot, it is clear that the text (minus the problematic clause referring to 1140, which I saw as a later interpolation) must have been com- posed almost immediately after the attacks on Rhineland Jewry.21 Both of these suggestions, however, are based upon an insufficient understanding of the closing unit of the chronicle. In this final section, the chronicler beseeches divine vengeance for the crimes committed against the Jews and attempts to show that in fact the process of punishment had already begun. It is in this connection that the downfall of Peter the Hermit and the lawless German bands is related. Even if the chronicler were writing after 1099, he would not have spoken of the conquest of Jerusalem. That success was ir- relevant, and indeed inappropriate, to his interests, for it was his desire to portray Crusader defeat. This same purpose must be kept in mind when reading the section on Peter the Hermit. The chronicler was not in search of accurate historical information. He was not particularly interested in where and how Peter's army was decimated; he was interested only in the fact that it was decimated. Thus for him it was sufficient to report that, when the Hungarians "trapped a hundred Crusaders together, they would kill them. On the morrow they would do likewise, and on the day following the same, until they killed them all, those traveling with Peter."22 To expect the Jewish chronicler to write of Civetot is to anticipate an unwarranted level of historical interest and information. For him it was enough to know and to tell of the destruction of Peter's forces. One can learn from this description nothing significant concerning the dating of the text. While these suggestions for early dating thus fall by the wayside and while judgment on the problematic clause which specifies 1140 remains suspended, there are in fact a number of indications in the text that the editing took place some time after the events themselves. The opening lines of the chronicle are instructive. 20. Yitzhak Baer, "The Persecution of 1096" [Hebrew], SeJer AssaJ (Jerusalem, 1953), pp. 128-30. 21.

The same sense emerges from the beginning of the report on Speyer. In that year Passover fell on Thursday and the new moon of lyar on Friday and Sabbath.24 This observation as well would hardly be made by someone writing in 1096 or 1097. A similar sense of later writing and editing is conveyed by two interpola- tions in the Cologne story. Omitting the difficult reference to 1 140, we may still note the indication that Solomon b. Samson "asked the elders concern- ing the entire incident," arranging his report on the basis of their testimony.25 Likewise in the account of the assault on Xantes there is men- tion of "my ancestors and the rest of the elders who occupy themselves with this matter, who saw this great deed."26 Both these interpolations imply a lapse in time between the events and their depiction. Finally, a closing remark by the chronicler reinforces the conclusion that the editing was late. After depicting the demise of the hosts of Peter the Her- mit and Emicho of Leinigen, he notes: In those days the sun was eclipsed. On that day God broke the pride of our enemies and their name was obliterated.27 The designation "in those days" is in itself a reflection of uncertainty and, in all probability, of distance from the events. Moreover, available knowledge of eclipses indicates that there was in fact no eclipse in the latter half of 1096, 23. N &amp; S, p. 1; Habermann, p. 24. 24. N &amp; S, p. 2; Habermann, p. 25. 25.

The only eclipse at approximately that time was observed in 1093.28 Once again the impres- sion is one of distance from the events and some confusion over details. A brief word concerning the provenance of the chronicle is also in order. It seems quite likely that the editor came from one of the Jewish com- munities described in the first segment of the narrative. Clearly these com- munities are the focus of his interest. Had the chronicler been a member of the Jewish community of Cologne, to which ample space is also devoted, it seems unlikely that Cologne Jewry would have been treated separately; it is far more likely that, if such were the case, the Cologne account would have been absorbed into, and would perhaps even have dominated, the opening section of the chronicle. To be sure, there is no certainty attached to this conclusion. We are merely suggesting that the structure and organization of the chronicle make it likely that its editor was a member of the reorganized Jewish community of Speyer or Worms or Mayence. Thus the following conclusions can be offered: (1) There is, throughout the chronicle, a sense of immediacy and rich detail, which reflects both writ- ten accounts composed at the time of the tragedy and later recording of eye- witness reports. (2) There is no evidence of early editing. (3) On the con- trary, there are a number of signs of later editing. (4) The passage that specifies the year 1140 remains problematic. If one wishes to accept Elbogen's reading of the text, then it is possible to move beyond the generalization "later editing" and propose a specific date. (5) The chronicle, as we have it, probably originated in Speyer or Worms or Mayence. * * * In my earlier study of S, I attempted to analyze a number of the major themes in the chronicle. These included attitudes toward the Crusaders, the burghers, the Christian authorities, the converted Jews, and the martyrs. It is striking to note that there are no significant differences between S and L on these issues. In a sense nothing new is thus added to our understanding of Jewish attitudes to the developments associated with the First Crusade. In fact, however, the correspondence in outlook between S and L is useful. It indicates that the views of S were not personal and idiosyncratic, but were shared throughout German Jewry. Indeed, since L, more clearly than S, is a 28. Theodor Ritter von Oppolzer, Canon of Eclipses, trans. Owen Gingerich (New York, 1962), charts 110-12. The next eclipse visible in areas of Germany was in 1133. 90</page><page sequence="13">FIRST CRUSADE CHRONICLES composite work, based to some extent on prior written records, the sense of shared outlooks is yet stronger. In this regard then, L buttresses our under- standing of the attitudes of Rhineland Jewry toward the disaster which over- took it. There is one section of L that merits particular attention. Since L is com- plete, the closing segment deserves special scrutiny.29 It is highly significant that the chronicler chose to end his lengthy account with a unit devoted to signs of divine punishment, prayers for fuller vengeance against the Chris- tian world, and concomitant hopes for redemption of the Jews. S and the remainder of L are of course not devoid of these themes. It is, however, striking that this is precisely the note upon which the editor of L chose to end. We have already noted that the fifth and final unit is devoted to an ex- tensive description of the annihilation of the forces of Peter the Hermit and of the popular German crusading bands. The chronicler, in all probability writing himself, depicts gloatingly and erroneously the supposed decimation of Peter's hordes by the Hungarians, "until they killed them all. Thus the Holy One, blessed be He, avenged the blood of His servants upon them, leaving not a single man among them."30 This is followed by an equally ex- tensive depiction of the downfall of the German crusading bands, with special mention of the hated Emicho. According to the Jewish chronicler, these unruly groups found Hungary closed to them. Failing in their efforts to overcome the first major fortress along their way, they attempted negotia- tion. The four barons sent to negotiate promised the king of Hungary to produce the head of Emicho. The latter and his followers fled with the Hungarians in full pursuit. The rout extended to the Danube, where "they fled over a bridge constructed by Peter the Hermit. They broke the bridge and thousands upon thousands drowned in the Danube, until they walked on the backs of the drowned just as one walks on dry land. When the rem- nant returned, we heard and were happy, for the Lord showed us vengeance upon our enemies."3' Once more the account is a curious mixture of fact and fancy. There is far less concern for accurate historical reporting than in the body of the text. The reason for this is quite simple. The chronicler is in- terested above all else in conveying the impression of total destruction. The chronicle closes with the observation that crusading fervor was yet 29. Recall that S is incomplete. We do not know how S chose to end his work. 30. N &amp; S, p. 30; Habermann, p. 58. 31.

Pursue them in anger and exter- minate them from beneath Thy heavens, O Lord."33 "For the Lord has a day of vengeance, a year of requiting for the injustices committed against Zion."M4 However, "Israel will be delivered by the Lord, delivered for all time to come; they shall not be confounded or put to shame for all eternity."-3 This is a striking conclusion to the long and horrifying record of slaughter at the hands of the Crusaders. The chronicler ends with the firm conviction that the crusading hosts, awesome as they might seem, fit neatly into the traditional pattern of Israel's enemies. They form but one more link in the chain and will meet the fate predicted by Israel's prophets. Conversely the weak Jewish community, which had fallen prey to the hatreds of the larger world around it, was the historical continuation of the true Israel which the Lord had long ago promised to redeem. At a number of points in the chroni- cle it had in fact been suggested that the Jews of the Rhineland had strengthened their claim to ultimate salvation by their unswerving dedica- tion to God. Out of the test of 1096 came, in a sense, deeper certainty of eventual redemption.36 Beyond the themes associated with the crusading period itself, there are a number of underlying historiographic attitudes which may be noted. One of the most interesting of these concerns the principle of historical causa- tion. The First Crusade itself is seen as a specific and sudden development in Christian society; there is no search for broad patterns of development. 32. Psalms 79:12. The translation has been taken from the New English Bible, but has been adapted slightly. Note the following verse which speaks of the joyful praise to be offered by redeemed Israel. 33. Lamentations 3:64-66. 34. Isaiah 34:8. Again the translation has been adapted slightly. 35. Isaiah 45:17, adapted slightly. The entire passage can be found in N &amp; S, p. 30, and Habermann, p. 59. 36. This notion is developed more fully by R. Ephraim of Bonn in his account of the Se- cond Crusade. See Chazan, "R. Ephraim of Bonn's Sefer Zechirah," pp. 123-25. 92</page><page sequence="15">FIRST CRUSADE CHRONICLES Neither economics nor politics are adduced to explain the genesis of the crusade. The causative factors in the First Crusade lay, in the eyes of the Jewish observer, in powerful human volition directed toward religious goals. The crusade developed when the arrogant ones, the barbarians, bitter and headstrong, the French and the Germans, roused themselves. They committed themselves to journeying to the Holy City, which had been desecrated by savage people, in order to seek there the grave of their deity, to drive from there the Moslems and the inhabitants of the land, and to conquer the land.37 In a subsequent passage, where the papal call to the crusade is mentioned, albeit in vague and shadowy terms, the essential factor is again the powerful emotional response which the papal exhortation evoked. Then Satan came, the pope of wicked Rome, and announced among the peo- ples who believed in the Nazarene, i.e., the children of Seir, that they assemble and ascend to Jerusalem, on a path made smooth for pilgrims, and visit the grave of the abomination which they accepted for themselves as a deity. Thus this Satan came and mixed among the peoples. They all gathered together as one man to fulfill the command. They came as the sand on the seashore, with a noise like a violent storm.-3 The same sense that great historical developments proceed from human will, motivated largely in the direction of religious zeal, emerges from the description of the deflection of Crusader exhilaration against the Jews. Once more the decisive factor is human volition. And it came to pass when they traversed towns where the Jews were, they said to one another: "Behold we journey a long distance to seek the sanctuary of our deity and to avenge ourselves upon the Moslems. But the Jews, whose ancestors killed and crucified him groundlessly, live among us. Let us take vengeance upon them first. Let us destroy them utterly, so that the name of Israel be recalled no longer. Or let them be like us and acknowledge Jesus.39 The most striking expression of the centrality of human will in history lies in the key phenomenon depicted in the chronicle, namely, the re- 37.

Historical patterns and psy- chological predilections do not enter the picture; the central factor again is human volition, in this case the religious zeal of the beleaguered Jews. Every incident highlights the powerful commitment of the besieged Jewish com- munity. Thus, for example, when the crusading hosts broke into the court- yard of a bishop's palace in Mayence, the doomed Jews cried out together-old men and young men, maidens and children, male servants and female servants-to their father in heaven. They wept for themselves and for their lives and accepted the heavenly decree. They said to one another: "Let us be strong and suffer the burden of our sacred awe. For the enemy may kill us for the moment-indeed by the easiest of the four modes of death, i.e., by the sword-but we shall live forever. Our souls will live on in Paradise, in great divine light, to eternity." They said wholeheartedly and willingly: "Ultimately one is not permitted to question the qualities of the Holy One, blessed be He and His name, who gave us His Torah and the com- mandment to die and be killed for the unity of His holy name. Fortunate are we if we do His will. Fortunate are all those who are killed and are slaughtered and die for the unity of His name."40 Such descriptions abound throughout the chronicle. They reflect more than simply praise for the Jewish martyrs; they reflect more even than a sense of Jewish victory over the enemy; they reflect a view of history in which events are directed primarily by the workings of powerful human wills. This view of history as effected largely by the workings of human voli- tion recognizes the reality of clash of wills. The tragedy of Rhineland Jewry in fact highlights such a clash, the battle between a large and powerful Christian society and its tiny Jewish enclaves. The Jewish chronicler recognizes that the force generated by powerful human emotions may be measured in a variety of ways. There is, first of all, the reality of physical power. No matter how intense Jewish volition might be, it was inevitably overcome in direct physical confrontation by overwhelming Christian numbers and force. In this-worldly matters, the Jewish chronicler is very much a realist. There is no miraculous salvation for the Jews; no extraworld- ly figures appear to spare the Jews from physical annihilation. The Jewish observer makes no effort to gloss over terrestrial realities. At the same time he advances another set of measures for evaluating human will-the goals 40. N &amp; S, pp. 6-7; Habermann, pp. 30-31. 94</page><page sequence="17">FIRST CRUSADE CHRONICLES toward which this will is directed. Thus, while recognizing the physical superiority of the Christian forces and their inevitable success in battle, the Jewish chronicler denies their victory nonetheless. The basis for this denial lies in the conviction that there is a God who will ultimately decide the fate of mankind, not on the basis of physical might, but rather on the basis of spiritual right. It is this second mode of evaluation which enabled the Jewish martyrs and those who recorded their deeds to emerge with a sense of vic- tory in the clash between the wills of the two opposing religious camps. Thus the constant denigration of Christiantity is more than simply a gratuitous emotional response on the part of the Jews. It is essential in order to explain and to understand the outcome of the struggle. It is because the Christian world has committed itself to a meaningless faith, while the Jews worship the one true God, that the physical defeat is transformed into a spiritual vic- tory. This emphasis on human will and the goals toward which it is directed accounts for a number of important characteristics of L and its sister texts. The first is a careful balance between the natural and the supernatural. The description is consistently "this-worldly," as we have noted. There is careful attention accorded to specific details and no effort made to introduce ex- traterrestrial forces. This does not imply, however, a modern naturalism. To the contrary, the naturalism of the description is the result of total religious conviction. Precisely because the Jewish authors were so totally convinced of the rightness of their cause and their ultimate vindication, they were capable of describing so clearly and so naturally a military defeat. This view of human history as an arena of conflicting wills accounts for yet another major characteristic of these Hebrew Crusade chronicles-their emphasis on the individual. This emphasis is all the more striking in view of the general tendency toward anonymity in Ashkenazic literature of this period. Thus, for example, R. Solomon b. Isaac of Troyes (Rashi) left a vast literary legacy of commentaries, responsa, and poetry, all of which reveals practically nothing of the man himself. Yet these comparatively brief Crusade chronicles are replete with a cast of unforgettable human beings. To be sure, we know little of the full personality of such heros as Rachel, the daughter of R. Isaac, or David b. R. Nethanel or Isaac b. R. David. They are nonetheless presented to us in their moment of sacrifice in full in- dividuality. There is a distinct effort to capture the uniqueness of each in- dividual character. Given the view that history is dominated by the forceful expression of human will, the effort to portray as fully as possible such 95</page><page sequence="18">ROBERT CHAZAN heroic figures is entirely understandable. Indeed the view of history is a dis- tinctly heroic one. History is seen as the working out of individual and col- lective wills. In such history economic or political process plays little or no role. The center of the stage is given over to the heroic group or the heroic individual. In this respect, while the Jewish observers differ profoundly from their Christian counterparts in their evaluation of these historical events, they agree as to the modes in which history is to be described. For both groups, overwhelming attention is accorded to the heroic. * * * My earlier study, which has been mentioned a number of times, began with an analysis of the relationships among the three extant Hebrew Crusade chronicles.41 It seems fitting, at the conclusion of two lengthy studies of the two more important of these three Hebrew texts, to close the circle by returning briefly to this opening issue. The first two assumptions of our earlier analysis seem to require no ad- ditional discussion. The first was the assertion that there is no reason to posit one relationship among all three chronicles, for example, that all three flowed from one lost record or that two derived from one. Instead, it is pos- sible that one kind of relationship exists between L and P and a different relationship between L and S. Second, it was emphasized that the precise limits of each text must be established before meaningful analysis can begin. This careful delimitation shows that L and P are complete, while S is trun- cated, with the narrative abruptly broken off. The third assumption in our earlier analysis was the existence of written local records upon which the edited chronicles were based. This assumption has in fact been corroborated by our close scrutiny of L. At a number of points we have concluded that written sources were adapted by the chronicler into sections of his narrative. Given this additional certitude con- cerning the utilization of preexistent written records, our earlier emphasis on the chronicler's role in ordering, introducing, and concluding the nar- rative still seems warranted. It was on this basis that we suggested that P is an abridgment of L, while S and L are essentially independent chronicles, based on common local records concerning Jewish fate in Mayence. To all this, one further elaboration, concerning the use of written sources by authors of this period, is in order. We fortunately find one instance in 41. Chazan, "The Hebrew First-Crusade Chronicles," pp. 236-41. 96</page><page sequence="19">FIRST CRUSADE CHRONICLES which we possess both a local source and the subsequent utilization of that source by a later chronicler. This instance involves the bloody incident at Blois in 1171, graphically described in a contemporary letter written by the Jews of nearby Orleans and in a somewhat later reworking of this letter by R. Ephraim of Bonn.42 A comparison of the Orleans epistle and R. Ephraim's adaptation is instructive. There can be no doubt as to the dependence of the latter upon the former. There are many verbatim quota- tions. More telling yet is the direct reference by R. Ephraim to his source. After describing the events in Blois, he adds: All these matters were written down in Orleans, the city closest to the sacred martyrs. Thus they informed Rabbi Jacob Tam. It was further written in their letter.... 43 All this makes the dependence of R. Ephraim upon the Orleans letter cer- tain. Yet it is striking to note the freedom with which R. Ephraim used his source. Phrases are quoted verbatim, but others are altered significantly. Indeed new details, obviously drawn from additional sources, are adduced. Thus, for example, the community is described as composed of "approx- imately four quorums of Jews"; the Jewess romantically linked with Count Theobald is designated as Polcelina; negotiations on behalf of the rest of the Jews of the county are indicated and the sum of one thousand pounds is specified. All these are details absent in the Orleans missive. Most noteworthy of all is R. Ephraim's alteration of the basic structure of the Orleans letter. This epistle begins with a vivid depiction of the death of the martyrs, then proceeds to sketch in the background, and concludes with some observations on the aftermath of the bloody events. Despite the ar- tistry and impact of this arrangement, R. Ephraim decided to restructure the materials which reached him. He opted for a simpler-and less impressive- scheme, beginning with the unfortunate meeting at the bank of the Loire River and proceeding chronologically through the tragedy. The example of the Orleans letter and R. Ephraim's use of it thus reveals the freedom with which local records were treated by the Jewish chroniclers of our period. An awareness of this free use of sources has important implications for the analysis of the relationships among the three Hebrew Crusade chroni- cles. It means that the presence or absence of occasional details must not be 42. N &amp; S, pp. 31-34 and pp. 66-69; Habermann, pp. 142-44 and pp. 124-26. 43. N &amp; S, p. 68; Habermann, p. 125. 97</page><page sequence="20">ROBERT CHAZAN overemphasized. Because authors treated the materials at their disposal freely-adding, deleting, and reorganizing, conclusions concerning the dependence of one text upon another cannot be based on incidental dif- ferences in detail. Specifically, this means that it is possible to argue that P is based upon L, even though there are instances of information in P which is not present in L. While clearly basing his narrative upon L, the editor of P did not feel himself constrained to follow his source slavishly. Likewise, the likelihood that S and L drew upon common sources in their depiction of the tragedy in Mayence is not diminished by minor discrepancies in the two ac- counts. Once more, an awareness of the license which editors of the period allowed themselves is necessary. Thus, in sum, these two related papers on the Hebrew First Crusade chronicles began with the suggestion that L was the source of P and that S and L were independent chronicles that utilized common sources for part of their narrative. Nothing in these two papers has served to weaken these sug- gestions. To the contrary, a number of the findings have indeed buttressed our original proposals concerning the problematic relationships among these three important Hebrew texts. 98</page></plain_text>
