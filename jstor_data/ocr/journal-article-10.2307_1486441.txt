<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS James L. Kugel. The Idea of Biblical Poetry: Parallelism and Its History. New York and London: Yale University Press, 1981. ix, 339 pp. The Idea of Biblical Poetry is divided into two parts. The first presents Kugel's reading of biblical verse, while the second is an historical-exegetical survey of the idea of biblical poetry. The two parts are quite distinct, and the reader who wants to grasp Kugel's interpretation is advised to read the book in reversed order starting with the chapter on rabbinic exegesis. The rabbis, noticing the phenomenon of repetition, nevertheless read a verse as an entity, part B supplementing, sharpening, and stressing part A. Such a read- ing went far beyond stylistic concerns, as Kugel explains: Now in this principle of biblical omnisignificance there is certainly a theologi- cal element. The words of the Pentateuch are, after all, instructions given to a prophet with whom God had spoken. It is inconceivable that any of those words should owe their existence solely to a chance, rhetoric, or for that mat- ter some mechanical principle of parallelism. The purpose of the Torah is to teach; if a statement is parallelistic in form, that statement must be examined to reveal its full meaning - everything must be read .... And what is true of the Torah can hardly be less true of the prophets, the inspired teachers whom the Torah itself prescribes as the arbiters of the later age, nor even of the Hagiographa. (pp. 104-105) Kugel discusses modern biblical criticism in terms of these principles. The modern study of biblical poetry began with Bishop Lowth's monumen- tal work, De sacra poesi Hebraeorum. Lowth argued that biblical verse is divided into two halves - parallelism - which are semantically related. He observed three types of verse: synonymous, antithetical, and synthetic. Although the last, synthetic parallelism, has been questioned, Lowth's types are nevertheless milestones in modern biblical criticism. The idea of parallel- ism has been strengthened by recent field studies of oral literature. The stress in oral literature is on the formula, that is, on a fixed set of semantic proso- dic combinations that assist the performer in orally composing his poetry while facing his audience. Searching for the biblical formulae of composi- 113</page><page sequence="2">114 BOOK REVIEWS tion, scholars have pointed to the phenomenon of paired words. The recita- tion of a certain word in the first half (A) is echoed by its "sister" word in the second half (B). The relationship can be synonymous: ha'azinu - shim'u, or antithetical: laylah - yom. The study of biblical verse by Lowth and the oralists has focused on the process of composition. However, composition itself is only one aspect of the literary process. As students of rhetoric emphasize, a work has three dimensions: the author, the text, and the audience. Until recently, biblical criticism confined itself to the study of the creative process, that is, the rela- tionship between the text and the author. Kugel, however, concentrates on the relationship between the text and the audience. Consequently, his argu- ment does not share a common point of departure with modern biblical scholarship, since each investigates a different issue. It is closer, instead, to such recent literary approaches as speech-act and reader-response criticism, which also address the relationship between the text and the audience. These literary movements have abandoned the traditional question of how the text was composed and ask instead: How does this text affect the reader? One has to distinguish, however, between the study of classical rhetoric and reader-response criticism. Rhetoric is not limited to the two dimensions of work and reader, but seeks to discover the relationship between all three dimensions of the work, focusing, therefore, on the process of creation as well as on the reader's reaction. Hence, only studies which explore all three dimensions of a literary work can deal effectively with and challenge the accepted notions of composition. Kugel's reading of biblical verse, focusing as it does on the reader, is remarkable. From this perspective, a verse in, for example, synonymous parallelism is not simply the repetition of the same idea in different words. Rather, the verse in its entirety creates the notion of the whole, with the second half responding to the first. Kugel writes: "All parallelism is really 'synthetic': it consists of A, a pause, and A's continuation, B" (pp. 57-58). Kugel suggests a new terminology for the phenomenon of repetition, calling it "seconding" instead of parallelism. He observes a tendency for variation in biblical verse in the changes that occur between the two halves, such as the change in tense from perfect to imperfect, which creates the notion of a unified whole. Kugel also calls attention to the technique of chiasmus, repetition in reversed order, a device used to avoid a monotonous reading of the verse. Kugel next confronts the question of biblical prose and poetry, asking: Is</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 115 there a formal distinction between the two? Since Kugel does not accept the parallelism as unique to poetry, pointing in fact to such a phenomenon in prose, he rejects the formal criterion of parallelism as a stylistic distinction between prose and poetry. He suggests instead that the predominant charac- teristic of biblical poetry is the terseness of the text. One can only regret that Kugel has not developed his ideas about biblical poetry, for we might hope that a discussion of biblical poetry would deal with such characteristic phenomena as figures of speech and sound devices and how they combine to produce poetry. Kugel merely suggests an idea, but the poetics of biblical poetry is a chapter that has not as yet been written. The second part of Kugel's book, which discusses the "history of ideas about parallelism," is a significant contribution to the study of biblical exegesis from antiquity, through the medieval period and the Renaissance, to the modern period. The chapter on rabbinic exegesis explores the princi- ples of the rabbis' understanding of biblical texts and their resulting methods of interpretation. The discussion of biblical poetry and the church outlines the principles of interpretation and analyzes the differences between allegorical exegesis in the Bible and the Midrash. Kugel sheds light on the implications of the theological principles involved and investigates the cul- tural and theological foundations of the interpretation of biblical poetry by the church fathers. The book presents a discussion of the medieval Jewish commentators, deals in detail with Renaissance rhetoric, and illuminates the cultural-literary background of Lowth's parallelism. Kugel emphasizes the importance of the Renaissance for biblical literary criticism as the time when the Bible was first seen as a human document. At this point, Kugel indicates, the notion of the Bible as literature begins. He discusses England's contribution to the study of biblical poetry, correctly pointing out the signi- ficance of rhetoric for the literary study of the Bible. There are indeed differences between classical rhetoric and biblical poet- ics, but the application of rhetoric to the study of biblical poetry is not erroneous, as Kugel states (p. 132). The principles of rhetoric, that is, "the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion" (Aristotle, Rhetoric 1355b), do not merely apply to the study of Greek oratory but present means for systematic inquiry into the art of effective speech (Rhetoric 1354a). Classical oratory should not be ignored by students of biblical poetry. Thus, Christian Schoettgen, who preceded Lowth in the discovery of biblical parallelism, in fact utilized the rhetorical device of exergasia, that is, rules of repetition designed to produce a specific effect.</page><page sequence="4">116 BOOK REVIEWS This technique enabled him to outline the rules of biblical parallelism.
