Princeton and Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2002. x, 219 pp. Can medieval Jewish poetry teach us history? Asked differently, can schol- ars draw on medieval poetry (piyyutim) to reconstruct historical events? In Beau- tiful Death, Einbinder narrows down this matter to the case of Ashkenazic martyrological poetry. To answer this question, Einbinder has analyzed over sev- enty Hebrew poems from northern France, England, and Germany; they span the period following the First Crusade (1096), ending with the Rindfleisch massacres of 1298 in Germany and King Philip IV's expulsion of the French Jews in 1306. In Einbinder's opinion, the Ashkenazic poetry of martyrdom has not received sufficient scholarly attention. While historians "rarely considered" these martyro- logical poems for their studies of "everyday life" in northern Europe (pp. 1-2), scholars of poetry focused on the medieval Hebrew poetry from Spain and other Muslim countries. The latter scholars considered the Ashkenazic works to lack lit- erary merit (p. 6). Beautiful Death is set to prove that Ashkenazic martyrological poems constitute both an important source of information for historians and a beautiful literary genre in their own right. Einbinder argues that a great deal can be learned from these poems because developments in the literary conventions mirror alterations in the violence toward Jews and in the Jewish responses. Chapter 1 offers an overview of the role martyrological poetry played in me- dieval Jewish society. After the Second Crusade, martyrological poetry presented a new type of martyr (p. 18). In contrast to the indiscriminating massacres of 1096, the new martyr was the victim of judicial procedures. Another change emerges in the laments of the French poets about the martyrs burned at Blois in 1171. These laments focus solely on "an elite corps of scholar-martyrs" (p.18). The motif that runs through four of the eight laments on Blois is the martyrs' incombustible na- 371</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews tures. Their public and fiery ordeal is embellished by allusions to the Sinai reve- lation. By the thirteen century, the motif was replaced by Ezekiel's vision of the wheel. The shift in symbols marks a change in the method of execution from burn- ing to death on wheels, and to a more personal martyrdom (pp. 27-28; 32). According to Einbinder, these poems functioned on three levels: 1. as a form of cultural resistance to conversion in northern France; 2. as "texts" for the "tex- tually skilled" young male students of the Tosafist schools, and as "performed" for a wider audience sensitive to extratextual effects, such as music, rituals, and ges- ture; 3. as anticonversionary and polemical works, for conversion to Christianity temporarily increased (pp. 19, 38). Einbinder gives two main reasons for her distinction between the semieso- teric and popular functions of the Tosafists' poems. Only the sophisticated and ed- ucated Tosafist could read and fully understand these poems. Illiterate women and even literate males would miss the full meaning of the embedded symbols. Her second reason for seeing the poems as texts for the Tosafist is their need for an "image of rabbinic fortitude" (p. 62), since "the weakest link in the chain of resis- tance [to conversion] was among the intellectual elite" (p. 184, and again: "young, educated Jews who were particularly susceptible to conversionary pressures," pp. 59, 72, 133). In the chapters that follow, Einbinder elaborates on these arguments to the verge of redundancy. This includes her Epilogue, which reads more like her initial overview than as a conclusion. Her distinction between the two audiences seems artificial. These poems incorporated contemporary motifs already known to their Jewish and Christian contemporaries. The poets embellished these popular circu- lating images by biblical verses and metaphors to the best of their literary skills. Take for example the motif of the Blois' martyrs singing Alenu le-shabeah in the fire. Jewish martyrology incorporated the Alenu at a time Christians claimed to have heard their martyrs singing the Te Deum Laudamus. The same is true about the motif of the Sinai revelation. The Latin literature of the First Crusade already compared the crusaders to the Israelites on their way to the Holy Land, and this is how many of the participants are said to have viewed themselves. If the relatively less educated Christian crowd was familiar with such motifs (through public preaching and art, for instance), the chances are good that the generally more literate Jewish male understood them as well. Jewish women, as Einbinder observes, could become familiar with these popular motifs in other ways. After all, the Hebrew and the vernacular poems owe their survival, some in the form of liturgy, to their popularity due to their use of popular motifs. Nor should we be surprised by the featuring of the Tosafist martyr in texts written by Tosafists. In reality, Tosafists were among ordinary Jews who were made to choose between conversion and death. As Einbinder comments, the "'typ- ical' Blois martyr was not a scholar" (p. 51). The featuring of the Tosafists in sev- eral poems does not necessarily indicate, as Einbinder suggests, that the young intellectuals or the "scholar-rabbi" were the "weakest link" in the chain of resis- tance to conversion. R. Yom Tov in England and the Rosh family in Spain are a few examples that show that Tosafists played a leading role in the martyrdoms at their communities. 372</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Of course, historians should not ignore poetry. Einbinder, therefore, should be appreciated for giving Ashkenazic Jewish poetry the attention it deserves. She managed to sort carefully through these works and to present them in an organized fashion. She captured the poems' main themes, making several useful comments. Historians, however, are likely to resort to speculation when no other types of sources are available. Einbinder's discussion on Samson of Metz actually demon- strates this point (Ch. 4). Also problematic is Chapter 6, on a Jew named Jonathan. Here Einbinder relies on polemical Latin liturgy and two early modern anti-Jew- ish Christian accounts that followed it to tell "us something about the imaginative world of medieval Jews" (p. 157, my emphasis), or what Jews may have "believed" in (p. 158). Based on Jonathan's story, Einbinder argues, Jews may have believed that holy books could protect them from the flames when being executed. Such polemical works should not be taken at face value. They were designed to ridicule Judaism and support a common medieval Christian belief that God would perform miracles only for Christians. For lack of historical accounts, this chapter is highly speculative. In short, for the historian poetry can complement other historical documents. Medieval poetry works well as a complementing source when one is already fa- miliar with the historical background in which it was written. Without sufficient historical accounts, it is unlikely that poetry alone would enable us to reconstruct historical events accurately.
