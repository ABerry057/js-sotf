Brill, 1993. x, 167 pp. Contrary to Nitza Ben-Dov's assertion (p. 1), the study and interpretation of the fiction of S. Y. Agnon, both in Hebrew and in English, has become a veritable industry, representing probably the greatest body of scholarship focused on any single novelist in the Hebrew language. The glut of papers and studies about Agnon has more than once prompted editors to table proposed</page><page sequence="2">224 BOOK REVIEWS studies on him so as to enable a more even distribution of works about other authors. Similarly, one would be hard put to come across a conference on modem Hebrew literature where at least one paper is not devoted to Agnon's fiction. Ben-Dov's study of Agnon's "art of indirection," unlike other studies whose sweep is broad and encompassing, is rather modest, though by no means insignificant. While illuminating some of Agnon's seminal works, A Simple Story (1935) and "In the Prime of Her Life" (1923), she also devotes close attention to one of his problematic and often neglected tales, the novella Thus Far (1951). Also included is a chapter on the almost-obscure short story "The Dance of Death" (before 1920). Yet, while focused on only a few of Agnon's works, Ben-Dov's study models a method which promises to yield significant knowledge when applied to this author's other narratives. While the suggested interpretations of these works is, by and large, per- suasive, illuminating, and insightful, one must question Ben-Dov's rationale for selecting them out of a diverse repertoire of Agnon's works, many of which are equal or superior candidates for evaluation, among them The Book of Deeds and A Guest for the Night. Her reasoning-they "all were written between The Bridal Canopy and Shira" (p. 11)-is unpersuasive and totally unnecessary. For instance, she states, without clarification, that 1931 was the publication date of The Bridal Canopy (p. 8), which, while certainly appearing then as part of the first edition of Kol Sippurei Agnon, was published in a shorter version in 1920. Also, while proposing to use the dates of these works as her limits, she digresses to reflect on Agnon's "Hill of Sand" (1920); in the same vein, the tale "The Dance of Death" had its earliest form in 1907, appearing more fully in his anthology Polin by 1925. Yet to her credit it must added that the insight she sheds on each work leaves the reader enlightened and appreciative of Agnon's genius for delving into the human psyche. Ben-Dov's central thesis is that meaning in Agnon's narrative is concealed in-and may be exhumed from-select episodes, especially those representing dreams or dreamlike accounts. The process of revelation emerges following an identification of the "tension between the explicit and the implicit, the revealed story and that which lies hidden beneath its surface, the initial message to the reader and the radically different one that emerges slowly only after persistent probing of that text. . . . Pithy proclamations are undercut and proven illusory by the unfolding of events; and for every interpretation, there is an equal and opposite interpretation" (p. 11). This study stands as an example of reader-response criticism, for only by</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 225 arduous questioning and examination of the text can one begin to reach an interpretation of key episodes, those whose meaning illuminates the whole plot. Instead of reading any of the represented works allegorically, or seeking meaning by discovering the rich, textually allusive language of the author's narrative, the majority of Ben-Dov's examples present a close examination of the protagonists' inner world. Though the reader-centered interpretation is a fruitful one, Ben-Dov indicates its limitations in the case of Agnon. For while the reader is the one to decode the narrative, its latent content cannot be seen in its fullness unless the reader has facility in traditional texts. Readers intent on a fuller appreciation of his fiction are required by Agnon to be totally steeped in Jewish learning. In so doing, Agnon contributes his share to bringing readers back to the sources. In confronting Thus Far, Ben-Dov's close reading of the account leads to an eye-opening revelation of the protagonist's inner world, one dominated by suppressed sexuality. The tale has been avoided by many scholars (E. Fuchs and R. Lee being two recent exceptions) convinced that it is one of Agnon's less perfect compositions, broken up as it is in its account of the hero's seemingly aimless and senseless meandering in Germany during the First World War. Ben-Dov's close reading exposes the Agnonesque hero in all his repressed self. While not totally resolving the problem of the work's (dis-)unity, Ben-Dov persuasively argues for a coherence in the hero's travels in pursuit of proper lodging. This quest, in its broadly symbolic sense, manifests itself in his pursuit of a possible sexual affair with the alluring Brigitta Schimmermann. Matters of sexual ambivalence and identity are also a central theme lying at the root of Hirshl's emotional trauma in A Simple Story. Ben-Dov proposes that Dr. Langsam "cures" Hirshl by fostering his ability to communicate his love to others and to come to accept that in this world one's romanticized fantasies are not fully realized. Similarly, "In the Prime of Her Life" serves as an opportunity for Ben-Dov to posit a sobering message. Agnon's love stories do not end happily, and neither does this one (p. 136). Tirtza's marriage to Akavia is a wrong move by the heroine, for instead of freeing herself from society's conventions, she is imprisoned in a marriage into which she has been subtly led by her friend and confidant. The heroine's emotional needs are not realized, nor has she liberated herself, asserts Ben-Dov. Finally, in reading "In the Prime of Her Life" and "The Dance of Death," Ben-Dov focuses on the quasi-biblical style by which latent content is also</page><page sequence="4">226 BOOK REVIEWS discernible. In the latter work, she also offers a reading of the narrative that is innovative, though overly dependent on hypothetical situations, and demonstrates Agnon's penchant for adding his own ironic reconfiguration of the generic tale of martyrdom. This is a work which is definitely recommended for students of Agnon's fiction. The excellent models of close reading will, it is hoped, inspire further, and similar, readings of Agnon's more enigmatic passages, since, in Ben-Dov's words, they "are in fact the Ariadne's thread by which we find our way through the cunning labyrinth of his stories" (p. 12).
