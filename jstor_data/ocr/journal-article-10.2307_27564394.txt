Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2007. x, 203 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001517 In a talk at the Queer Shabbaton in New York City during the fall of 2007, Ann Pellegrini opened her talk on camp by dissecting some text from Susan Sontag's essay "Notes on Camp." Mentioning Sontag's ambivalence about her own jointly Jewish and queer identity, Pellegrini pointed out how the text, in attempting to bring the two categories together, functions through a series of nega tions to separate them. Jewish critical and cultural theory has on occasion taken on the Jew and_(fill in the blank) trope, attempting to look at and for connections between Jews and other groups. When done well, such studies enrich our under standings of Jewish interactions with others and highlight similarities and difference between Jews and other groups. What most of these studies share is a failure to understand, imagine, and theorize the ways in which the category of Jew is not sep arate from other categories. What it has meant to be Jewish, whether looked at from forces apparently propelling us internally as a community or in "treatment" from 474</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews dominant cultures is always a co-creation with multi valent discourses of identity and power. At the very least, works on "gays and Jews," "women and Jews," "Blacks and Jews," "Arabs and Jews," ad infinitum generally show a startling lack of aware ness of the many gay, women, Black, Arab Jews. In Rainbow Jews: Jewish and Gay Identity in the Performing Arts, Jonathan C. Friedman reflects the shortcomings of this approach as he also attempts to bridge such categorical divides. Rainbow Jews is a clearly written book looking primarily at gays and Jews in theater and film in the United States. The work offers readings of some Jewish and gay, and occasionally gay Jewish, pieces to review intersections of gay and Jewish styles and sensibilities. The book should serve as an important resource for those interested in exploring relationships between gays and Jews. The book offers a his torical context in the early chapters on "Homophobia and Tolerance in Judaism" and "Jews, Homosexuality, and the Performing Arts in the United States" between 1890 and 1969. The text then presents three thematically driven chapters in historical sequence: a post-Stonewall era (1969-82) development in film and theater in the United States focusing on "Coming Out"; the centrality of AIDS in gay works with the onslaught of the epidemic; and Toni Kushner's Angels in America as a pivotal work from the 1990s bringing us to the present day and setting up some new avenues that might be explored by new artists. There is one chapter on lesbian works and one chapter on Israeli cinema. Friedman is well aware that many of the Jews involved in the performing arts have been and are gay and that many of the gays are Jews. Friedman remains caught in a challenge that he has inherited from popular culture and much critical theory: treating groups such as gays and Jews as distinct when much experience belies such a theoretical model and such frameworks often prove incoherent when attempting to theorize from them. At the same time that Friedman attempts to note "links," look at "connections," and even "refracting" themes through the "other's prism," he also wants to name something else. Fried man is attempting to articulate something more theoretically complex regarding the ways in which gay and Jewish outlooks and experiences have been creating one another, at least in the United States and in the Israeli gay example. Friedman is able to note in the introductory and concluding matter that many who study gay and Jewish life prefer "an approach which favors ambiguity over clarity, multiplicity over singularity, movement over stasis" (183), only to state that such "unites gays and Jewish as discrete groups?if they are in fact discrete groups." Like Sontag's links through negations, Friedman offers, "It would be equally difficult, though, to argue that gay sexuality in the performing arts over the past four decades does not owe a portion of its construction to the efforts of Jewish playwrights and filmmakers, many of whom are gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgendered, and/or straight." Friedman then makes his strongest claim: "Gay representation has an undeniably Jewish coloring." He names such "coloring" in generalized terms where "universal themes ... have passed through the filter of Jewish history." As outsider standpoints, gay and Jewish imaginaries "have converged to effect what many linguists refer to as subversive mimicry, a destabi lization of the dominant discourse to render it more inclusive, mutable, and self-aware as a construct of language and a tool of power" (184). 475</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Yet Friedman refocuses in his conclusion on the assimilative and "inclusive" calls in the stead of more radical and transformative moves in the works he has explored. This is partly attributable to his own readings of the works. Friedman makes an important contribution with this book length work that introduces readers to a field. He cites many more in-depth article length pieces that are also more theoretically oriented. He offers a walk through many of the pieces of import in any queer Jewish study of modern film and theater. His book will be of great use to newcomers to the field in its accessible style as well as to academics and cultural critics seeking to understand connections between phenomena Jewish and queer. Rainbow Jews will also be of service to those doing Jewish queer theory, who will likely be glad to have these many pieces, from the performing arts as well as written works about them, collected in one examination. Friedman has written a gay-focused work. At the end of the central part of his argument (the close of Chap. 5 on Kushner), he states that new ground needs to be broken and that Jewish lesbians are among those who are doing just that. He then has one chapter on lesbian works. The chapter on Israeli cinema makes a contribution in that still all too little is written on the subject. In the "Israel" chapter, too, there is a section on "Lesbiot." The text lacks the contributions that a feminist reading or inte gration of lesbian and queer feminist analyses could offer on the topic. In part, that means there are still many contributions to be made. In addition, ghettoizing lesbian works into a chapter and a section of a chapter Friedman reiterates a dynamic he is somewhat conscious of. He notes in the lesbian chapter, in his lesbian marriage discussion of Chicks in White Satin, that "the use of the word "regular" rather than "straight" is a giveaway, implying that only a marriage between a man and a woman qualifies as regular and there is something irregular" about same sex doings. Similarly, though there is a potential strength in separating out "lesbian" topics for considered study, they also could inform the main text. Friedman's work suggests how much race-critical analysis remains to be done in this area. He includes a brief section on "Race and 'Queerdom'" in the Israel chapter, demonstrating the need for more work in the Israel context. The lack of attention to the multilayered discourses of class at all and of race in queer, Jewish, and queer Jewish life in the United States are an opening for future scholarship. Friedman comes out as straight in his preface. While helpful in noting his dues, it is significant to note that we are at a historical moment when gay related scholarship might not only hurt one's academic reputation, even if one is not gay. His opening disclosure is interesting. While I certainly agree that queer and Jewish scholarship does not rely on identity categories, for these are analytic frames, his opening statements foreshadow some of the tensions in the study as a whole. The very first paragraph of the text has the same effect of Pellegrini's comment on Sontag?the author makes a claim for his subject and its importance by exposing anxiety about how "off track" he has appeared to "veer" from his straight and obviously valued work in Holocaust and German Jewish history (ix). Though Friedman might not "be" gay, the text makes use of patriarchal ten dencies in all straight, gay, and queer work that do not see women and dykes, setting up men and maleness as their norms?as Friedman notes as "regular"?or draw 476</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews depth from feminist analysis. In addition, this text on gay themes suggests that there remains much room for new queer analyses of Jews and things Jewish in the per forming arts. Friedman's one mention of a film that takes on a transgender theme suggests not only that there is a great deal of room for analysis on artistic works with trans characters but also much room left for genderqueer analysis in addition to potentially gay analysis. This helpful first book also shows us that much more can be written on cinema and plays generally, studies using broader historical frames and that shift the geographical lens. I do not know whether Friedman is intending further work, though Rainbow Jews nicely creates space for study of additional areas in the performing arts thematically imagined through comedy and tragedy or by genre such as comedians, vaudeville and cabaret, circus, music, happenings and avant-garde performing arts that defy categorization.
