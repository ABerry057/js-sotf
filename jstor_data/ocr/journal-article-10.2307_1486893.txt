<plain_text><page sequence="1">SAINTS OR SINNERS, SCHOLARS OR IGNORAMUSES? STORIES ABOUT THE RABBIS AS EVIDENCE FOR THE COMPOSITE NATURE OF THE BABYLONIAN TALMUD by RICHARD KALMIN As Jacob Neusner and others have argued, before talmudic stories can be evaluated as historical evidence we must ask who the original authors were, what were their motives, and who was their intended audience.' Even once we obtain the "original" version of a story, we do not necessarily have I wish to thank Professors Baruch M. Bokser, Shaye J. D. Cohen, and Burton Visotzky of the Jewish Theological Seminary, who read earlier versions of this paper and offered several valuable suggestions. 1. See below, Bibliographical Note. 179</page><page sequence="2">180 RICHARD KALMIN access to the historical event which gave rise to the story. For perhaps accounts of the historical event have been colored, even distorted beyond recognition, by the needs, desires, and beliefs of the original authors. Or per- haps the stories they transmit are fabrications, invented by students or later editors with a particular goal in mind. In this paper, I examine the Talmud's portrayal of the characters and personalities of amoraim of the first through the fourth generation, for example Ray and Shmuel, R. Yohanan, Resh Lakish, and R. Elazar ben Pedat, Rabbah and Rav Yosef, and Abaye and Rava. I ask whether these amoraim are presented as saints or as sinners, as scholars or as ignoramuses, as friends and colleagues or as barely on speaking terms. My goal is to deter- mine whether their portrayals aid us in identifying and describing some of the diverse sources that make up the Babylonian Talmud. I discover that tal- mudic accounts of their characters and personalities and the nature of their interactions contain contradictions that betray the existence of opposing sources. According to some sources, for example, Abaye is ignorant and incompetent while Rava is the greatest scholar of his generation. According to other sources, Rava is sinful and arrogant, cruel toward his contempo- raries and disrespectful toward his teacher, in contrast to Abaye, who is a loyal and devoted disciple. According to my conclusions and the conclu- sions of other scholars, important aspects of the history of the amoraic period need to be reevaluated, since historians have tended to accept tal- mudic stories as reliable evidence once miraculous elements and later edi- torial accretions have been removed. This is not to say that every contradiction is proof of a distinct source. Yonah Fraenkel is very likely correct that many aggadic compositions must be examined purely as works of art.2 The purpose of many talmudic stories is not to advance a particular school's agenda or to promote the teachings of a particular master, but to teach a moral lesson, to make a statement about the nature of the world or God or the human predicament. As such, the character of the amoraic protagonist may be molded to fit the particular statement the author wishes to make. The same school or author, depending on the needs of the narrative, might portray the same rabbi in contradictory 2.

Halevi, "Od al Genre Hadash ba-Sipurei ha-Agadah," Tarbiz 49 (1980): 424-428, and Fraenkel's rejoinder ("Te- shuva," p. 429, there).</page><page sequence="3">STORIES ABOUT THE RABBIS AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE BAVLI 181 terms. Patricia Cox, examining Eusebius's biography of Origen, makes the same point. Eusebius's Origen, she writes, is "Janus-faced," meaning that a unified, coherent personality does not emerge from Eusebius's account of the life of Origen because the actual, historical Origen is refracted through the lens of Eusebius and the requirements of his narrative and the audience for whom he is writing.3 On several occasions, however, the nature of the contradictions is such that the existence of opposing sources seems the most likely explanation. In the final analysis, every narrative and every contradic- tion needs to be evaluated on its own terms. Sources Are Not Systematically Altered Examination of cases in which Abaye and Rava definitely appear in each other's presence reveals that Rava occasionally defeats Abaye in argument, but almost as often Abaye has the last word. Rava defeats Abaye, for exam- ple, in stories which describe legal cases brought before Abaye for judgment, whereupon Abaye procrastinates and fails to deliver a prompt verdict. The litigants are told by a student of Rava to go before Rava, whose "knife is sharp," and Rava delivers a prompt, and correct, decision.4 Similarly, we find cases in which a student comes to Abaye with a halakhic question or a problem of interpretation, but Abaye is unable to answer. The student takes his question to Rava, who resolves the difficulty.5 Abaye defeats Rava, for example, in one case in which Abaye, Rava, Rav Zeira, and Rabbah bar Matna are described as "needing a leader."6 They decide that the honor will fall to whoever makes a statement which withstands his colleagues' criti- cism. Abaye's opinion prevails and he wins the right to open the discussion.7 3. Patricia Cox, Biography in Late Antiquity (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1983), pp. 69-101. 4.

In a third context, in fact, Rava himself is portrayed as recounting a conversation he had with Abaye in which Abaye "surrounded [him] with proofs."9 Rava quotes Abaye's objection, his own response, and Abaye's refutation of his response.l0 We cannot assume that cases in which Abaye prevails over Rava reflect the point of view of Abaye and his school, or the point of view of editors favoring Abaye, while cases in which Rava prevails over Abaye reflect the perspective of Rava and his school, or of editors favoring Rava. The notion that students or editors will skew the sources in favor of a particular rabbi whenever they have the opportunity is difficult to maintain in the face of abundant evidence to the contrary. I concluded in an earlier study that state- ments by the overwhelming majority of fourth-generation amoraim are pre- served in the Talmud primarily to the extent to which they have a bearing upon a handful of important amoraim." Statements by fourth-generation rabbis such as Rami bar Hama, Rav Huna bar Hinena, Mar Zutra b. d'Rav Nahman, and Rav Dimi MiNehardea are preserved primarily to the extent to which they bear upon amoraim such as Abaye and Rava. In other words, fourth-generation amoraim depend on Abaye and Rava for the preserva- tion of their statements in the Talmud. And yet there is no evidence of an attempt on the part of Abaye or Rava or their disciples, or on the part of later editors favoring Abaye or Rava, to distort the nature of their interac- tions with most of their contemporaries. In one context, Rava judges a case and Rav Huna bar Hinena and Rav Huna b. d'Rav Nahman disagree with his decision.12 Rava publicly announces his opinion, and Huna bar Hinena 8. Baba Batra 174b. 9.

Later on, Ray Nahman travels to Mahoza,'3 he and Rava discuss the mat- ter, and Rava is surprised to learn that Ray Nahman agrees with Huna bar Hinena and Huna b. d'Rav Nahman, and that he, Rava, misunderstood his teacher. In another context, Huna bar Hinena judges a case, Rava objects in his presence, and the two sages publicly proclaim their contradictory opinions.14 The text provides no indication that either point of view prevails. In fact, later amoraic discussion takes notice only of the opinion of Huna bar Hinena in determining the halakhah, and completely ignores the oppos- ing opinion of Rava.'s We see, therefore, that the sages through whom our sources are transmitted, or later editors on behalf of those sages, did not systematically distort the record of their interactions with most of their con- temporaries. They did not, or could not, systematically alter the sources to make them appear infallible.'6 We see this even in their interactions with sages with whom they are portrayed as engaging in obvious conflict. For example, talmudic sources portray conflicts between Rava, on the one hand, and Huna bar Hinena and 13. See Tractate Abodah Zarah, ed.

In these cases, Abaye's or Rava's statements are followed by opposing statements by Rav Dimi MiNehardea, Rabbah bar Ulla, and the Nehardeans. Sever- al of these opposing statements contain explicit criticisms of the opinions of Abaye or Rava. And yet statements by these amoraim are included in the Talmud primarily to the extent to which they are transmitted in the proximity of opposing statements by Abaye or Rava. With regard to the Nehardeans, see David Goodblatt, "Local Traditions in the Babylonian Talmud," Hebrew Union College Annual 48 (1977): 187-194. The disciples of Abaye and Rava who trans- mitted these disputes did not alter them to make it appear as if their masters had the final word, nor did they remove the explicit criticisms of their masters' opinions. 16. For a discussion of the editorial techniques used by ancient authors, see F. Gerald Downing, "Compositional Conventions and the Synoptic Problem," Journal of Biblical Litera- ture 107, no 1 (1988): 69-85. Downing shows (p. 70) that in the ancient world, "even the most highly literate and sophisticated writers employ relatively simple approaches to their 'sources.'" J. Hornblower, Hieronymus of Cardia (London and New York: Oxford University Press, 1981), p. 280, for example, writes that Diodorus Siculus "merely paraphrased or extract- ed, without addition or interpretation, except of the simplest kind."</page><page sequence="6">184 RICHARD KALMIN Huna b. d'Rav Nahman, on the other. In addition to the two confrontations described above, Huna bar Hinena makes an eruv on behalf of the exil- arch," and Rava follows after him and uproots it. Elsewhere, Huna bar Hinena is about to publicly proclaim a law regarding vows,'s and Rava sharply objects in his presence. Rava once rejects Huna bar Hinena's argu- ment with the words, "Someone who does not know how to explain tan- naitic sources made this objection."'9 In another context, Rava quotes Ray Nahman and fails to remember essential details of his teacher's opinion, details which Huna bar Hinena and Huna b. d'Rav Nahman remember.20 According to some versions in another context, Rava berates Huna bar Hinena for transmitting false opinions in Ray Nahman's name.21 The tal- mudic record is unambiguous in portraying bitter opposition between Rava, on the one hand, and Huna bar Hinena and Huna b. d'Rav Nahman, on the other. It is also clear that statements by Huna bar Hinena and Huna b. d'Rav Nahman are included in the Talmud primarily to the extent to which they impinge upon Rava and a handful of other important amoraim. This evidence for the existence of conflict between Rava and his contemporaries thus comes to us through the eyes of Rava, or his students, or later editors who favored Rava. Nevertheless, this evidence by no means presents an unambiguous picture of Rava as the dominant scholar of his generation. Instead, it presents a picture of Rava confronted by imposing adversaries who were on several occasions more than a match for him. When they clash, neither one consistently emerges victorious. Once again, we see that the sages through whom our sources are transmitted, or later editors on behalf of those sages, did not systematically distort the record of their interactions with most of their contemporaries. Quite plausibly, an important factor in Rava's clashes with Huna bar Hinena and Huna b. d'Rav Nahman was competition over who was legiti- mate successor to Rav Nahman, a teacher common to all three. Other sources portray bitter clashes between Rava and his contemporaries, and it is hard to view as mere coincidence the fact that several of these clashes pit Rava against sages whose fathers were dominant figures in the preceding 17.

Such sages, by virtue of their superior lineage, would have had a natural claim to leadership within the rabbinic movement. For example, most of Rava's interactions with Mar Zutra b. d'Rav Nahman consist of quotations by Mar Zutra b. d'Rav Nahman of his father's positions as reported by Rabbanan in the presence of Rava. Each time, Rava responds angrily, "Haven't I already told you not to attribute worthless opinions to Ray Nahman!22 This is what Ray Nahman said .. ."23 Similarly, Rava several times comments on statements by Rav Nahman bar Rav Hisda, and on all but one uncertain occasion24 the comment is a sharply worded rejection of Nahman bar Hisda's opinion which translates roughly as, "What a stupid thing to say."25 Hostile Stories Betray the Existence of Opposing Sources In the previous section, I argued against the notion that students or later editors systematically skew the sources in favor of a particular rabbi when- ever they have the opportunity. As Jacob Neusner and others have argued, however, the transmitters of stories and/or the editors of the Talmud are not above occasional character assassination. Neusner and others point to the fact that several amoraim are the subjects of unflattering stories which they claim originated in circles hostile to these amoraim. In the following pages, Neusner's insight is confirmed and refined through analysis of stories told about several prominent amoraim of the first through the fourth generation. Talmudic narratives about the rabbis are shown to derive from a variety of sources, some hostile and others sympathetic, some portraying them as the greatest scholars of their generation, others portraying them as ignorant and arrogant. 22. I have paraphrased Rava's statement. The literal meaning is, "Haven't I told you not to hang empty bottles on Rav Nahman!" 23. Baba Batra 7a and 151b, and A vodah Zarah 37b. In addition, Rava rejects Mar Zutra b. d'Rav Nahman's argument on Gittin 50a. Interestingly, the two amoraim are definitely in each other's presence only on Hullin 94b, in which context we find no hint of competition between them. See also Bezah 34b and Bekhorot 54b. 24. Horayot 10b (see Dikdukei Sopherim, n. heh). In that context, Rava simply objects against Ray Nahman bar Ray Hisda's view and follows with an alternative. 25. Ketubot 63b, Shevuot 12b, and Hullin 88b. In all three cases, Rava's comment is fol- lowed by a defense of Rav Nahman bar Rav Hisda's opinion by Rav Nahman bar Yizhak. In both instances, Rav Nahman bar Yizhak's argument prevails.</page><page sequence="8">186 RICHARD KALMIN Before substantiating these claims, however, it is necessary to say a few words about the criteria used in determining that stories derive from diverse sources. Since both favorable and unfavorable stories about an amora often come to us as part of the same document, the Babylonian Talmud, it is fre- quently impossible to discern the existence of opposing sources. We must be wary about imposing Western, twentieth-century values on the actions of ancient rabbis. In one context, for example, Rava refuses to surrender the property of Isur the convert, who is lying on his deathbed. Rava's plan is to take possession of the property when Isur dies. Rava wants to prevent his student, Ray Mari son of Isur, from taking possession of the property.26 Rava discusses several ways in which ownership of property is normally transferred, and explains why each method has no efficacy in the present instance. Rava's student, Ray Ika b. d'Rav Ami, suggests a way in which Ray Mari can take possession even without Rava's cooperation. Word reaches the dying Isur, who follows the suggestion of Ray Ika b. d'Rav Ami and transfers ownership to his son. Word of what happened reaches Rava, and he angrily denounces his students for causing him economic loss. Rava's conduct in this instance strikes us as reprehensible,27 which might lead us to conclude that the story derives from circles hostile to Rava. More likely, the Talmud does not share our ethical standards in this matter. Rava is perfectly within his rights in holding on to Isur's property, since Ray Mari, born to Isur before he converted, has no claim to his father's inheri- tance according to Jewish law. Furthermore, it is not Rava's responsibility to tell Isur how he can transfer ownership to Ray Mari. Rava's students, in fact, can be faulted for using their halakhic knowledge to influence the course of a monetary dispute they have no business getting involved in.28 Our moral standards, therefore, are often quite different from those of the talmudic rabbis. What strikes us as a hostile source often turns out not to be when viewed from the perspective of the Talmud itself. Even the portrayal of behavior unattractive by the Talmud's standards, 26. Baba Batra 149a. 27. See Heinrich Graetz, Geschichte der Juden (1853-75; reprint ed., Leipzig: O. Leiner, 1873-1900), vol. 4, pp. 332-333, who criticizes Rava's actions in this story. See the material collected by Yudelowitz, Mahoza, pp. 68-70. Yudelowitz concludes that relations between Rava and his students were strained. 28. See Mishnah A vot 1:8. See also Ketubot 52b, where R. Yohanan castigates himself for giving halakhic advice to one of the parties in a monetary dispute, and thereby influencing the outcome of the case.</page><page sequence="9">STORIES ABOUT THE RABBIS AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE BAVLI 187 however, cannot always be taken as evidence of a hostile source. In ancient as in modern times, a complex personality evokes a variety of different responses, even among those most sympathetic to him. In ancient as in modern times, a single individual might be spoken of, by the same people, in terms alternatingly reverential and harshly critical. This is not to say that we know enough about the psychology of talmudic rabbis to draw exact paral- lels between the modern and ancient periods. We certainly do not. It is sim- ply to say that caution is necessary when determining whether or not a source is hostile on the basis of its portrayal of an individual sage. The same individuals who revere a rabbi for his outstanding scholarship might dislike him for his nasty temper, and might carefully preserve vivid descriptions of both aspects of his personality. The situation is not totally hopeless, however. Occasionally we are on firm ground in determining that a story derives from a hostile source. One clear indication of this fact is the imputation to a rabbi of character traits which within the rabbinic value system mark the person off as fundamental- ly flawed or inadequate. A rabbi might be portrayed as dishonest, ignorant, a transmitter of unreliable traditions, or as violating fundamental rabbinic precepts.29 Another important clue that a story derives from a hostile source is the presence in the story of rabbis who have clear motivation for portray- ing an amora in unflattering terms (see below). Finally, if an amora's por- trayal in one story conflicts with his portrayal in another story, the existence of opposing sources may be the most likely explanation. Obviously, our argument is considerably stronger when more than one of these factors coincide. The sources portray conflict, for example, between Ray, Shmuel, and Karna, important Babylonian amoraim of the first generation. When Rav and Shmuel are about to encounter one another for the first time, Shmuel sends his student, Karna, to test Rav's learning.30 When Rav realizes he is being tested, he responds by cursing Karna, punning on his name: "May it be [God's] will that a horn [karna] come out of his eye." Shmuel, knowing that Rav is afflicted with a disease of the intestines, feeds him a meal which stimulates his bowels and then refuses to show him the way to a privy. Rav responds with a curse on Shmuel: "May the one who caused me this pain 29. See the discussion below. 30. Shabbat 108a. According to the printed editions, this story describes Rav's first appear- ance in Babylonia. See, however, Dikdukei Sopherim, n. bet.</page><page sequence="10">188 RICHARD KALMIN not raise up male children," and the narrator states that "so it was," that Rav's curse had its desired effect.3' Clearly, this story of Rav's first appear- ance in Babylonia represents a point of view hostile to Shmuel.32 Shmuel instigates the conflict and Ray is his innocent victim. Rav's curses strike us, perhaps, as overly harsh retaliation, but to the transmitters of the story they are appropriate responses to the cruel treatment he receives at the hands of Shmuel and Karna. This story most likely derives from different channels than those which portray Rav and Shmuel as cooperative colleagues.33 Per- haps a different point of view is reflected in contexts in which Shmuel rejects Rav's opinions, often in extremely harsh fashion,34 for the transmitters of this story might have denied Shmuel the opportunity to have the final word (see above). Most likely, the story of Rav's first meeting with Shmuel derives from different channels than those which portray Shmuel guarding Ray from serious halakhic errors, in one instance saving Rav's life in the process, and in the other advising Rav that they ought to look more deeply into a case before excommunicating an errant colleague." In the first instance, 31. On Baba Kamma 80a-b, the anonymous editors attempt to resolve the tension between this story of the relationship between Ray and Shmuel and the picture of their relationship found elsewhere in the Talmud. The anonymous editors claim that later on in his career, Ray regretted his cursing of Shmuel and treated him with special respect. Modern scholars claim that Shmuel was attempting to cure Ray of his intestinal disease. See, for example, Aharon Hyman, Toldot Tannaim ve-Amoraim (London: Ha-Express, 1910), p. 1124. However, Rav's reaction, the conclusion of the story, and the fact that Shmuel initiates the offensive test of Rav's learning (see Baba Batra 22a) make this interpretation extremely unlikely. 32. For a story hostile to Rav, see A vodah Zarah 36a, where Rav claims that R. Simlai's quotation of R. Yehuda ha-Nasi (Rabbi) presents no difficulty to his opinion because R. Sim- lai's traditions are untrustworthy. Shmuel suggests that they send to Rabbi for verification of his opinion, and Rav "turns white [with embarrassment]." 33. See, for example, Berakhot 12a, Eruvin 90a-b, Taanit 20b, Moed Katan 24a, Hagigah 14a, Yevamot 121a, Sanhedrin 24b, Avodah Zarah 31b, and Hullin 59a. One might reconcile these accounts with Shabbat 108a by arguing that Rav and Shmuel were harsh men who test one another and then put aside their differences and cooperate. 34. Shabbat 53a, Eruvin 78a, and Moed Katan 12b. For additional evidence of the existence of tension between Rav and Shmuel, see Eruvin 93b-94a. Rav turns his head in an expression of disagreement in response to Shumel's suggestion for repairing an eruv which has fallen down. Shmuel responds by proposing that Rav's own garment be used in repairing the eruv in the manner he suggested. Ritba and Meiri claim that Shmuel's comment was made in jest, but in light of the other stories we have examined in the course of this paper, it seems more likely that Shmuel's response should be taken at face value, as an expression of his anger at Rav's display of disagreement and as an attempt by Shmuel to assert himself in the face of his recalcitrant colleague. 35. Yevamot 121a and Hullin 59a.</page><page sequence="11">STORIES ABOUT THE RABBIS AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE BAVLI 189 Shmuel explains to Ray how one tests meat to see if it is poisonous, and in the second instance, Shmuel's circumspection pays off when it turns out that the colleague erred in judgment, but did not willfully violate the law. Very likely, the stories of Shmuel instructing Ray were told by sages who wished to portray Shmuel as the superior scholar of his generation. These stories very likely derive from different sources than numerous other narratives which portray Ray as the greater of the two.36 A lengthy account of a clash between Ray Yehuda and Ray Nahman, important Babylonian amoraim of the second generation, provides still another perspective on the relationship between Ray and Shmuel.37 Jacob Neusner correctly attributes this story to sources hostile to Ray Nahman. Neusner traces the origins of this hostility to Ray Nahman's close associa- tion with the court and family of the exilarch.38 It is difficult to agree with Neusner on the latter point, however, because Nahman's relationship to the exilarch is referred to only once throughout the entire story, and the refer- ence is not at all unfavorable. Nahman demands that Ray Yehuda appear before him in court, whereupon Yehuda goes to Rav Huna and asks if he should heed Nahman's summons. Huna answers that Nahman has over- stepped his bounds, but Yehuda should go anyway so as not to offend the exilarch. There is nothing in this exchange which implies criticism or resent- ment toward Nahman on account of his connection to the exilarch. In general, Neusner's pioneering and important early work on the history of the Jews in Babylonia overemphasizes the role of the exilarch in determining the tenor of relationships between individual rabbis. One important factor not considered by Neusner is competition between the rabbis themselves, independent of the exilarch. Most likely, this competition is the motivating factor behind this story's unflattering portrayal of Nahman. Throughout the story, Nahman repeatedly displays his ignorance of the opinions of Shmuel. Nahman's ignorance displays itself in a lengthy series of improper actions, and each time, Yehuda quotes Shmuel against him. Nahman quotes two statements by Ray, but Yehuda counters each time by demonstrating that Rav's opinion is not applicable in the situation at hand. Most likely, this story derives from sources sympathetic to Yehuda and hostile to Nahman, 36. See, for example, Hullin 95b. 37. Kiddushin 70a-b. 38. Neusner, History of the Jews in Babylonia vol. 2, pp. 61-75.</page><page sequence="12">190 RICHARD KALMIN since one of the story's central concerns is to demonstrate the superiority of Yehuda, the Pumbeditan, whose mastery of the teachings of the great Nehardean sage, Shmuel, contrasts sharply with the ignorance of Shmuel's Nehardean successor, Nahman. The story also attempts to explain away the curious fact of Nahman's superiority in the judicial realm, even over amo- raim who were his academic superiors. His preeminence in the judiciary, claims the story, is not due to any merit on Nahman's part. On the contrary, only out of respect for the house of the exilarch did Nahman's contempo- raries subordinate themselves to him even though he was their inferior from the standpoint of rabbinic learning. Finally, the story may be trying to show the importance of adherence to the opinions of both Rav and Shmuel, to show that knowledge of only the opinions of Rav will lead to the type of ignorant behavior exhibited by Nahman. This conclusion is surprising, in view of the fact that elsewhere, Nahman is well versed in the opinions of Shmuel, quoting him to a far greater extent, in fact, than he quotes the opinions of Rav.39 This story, evidently, reflects a different view of Nahman and his relationship to Shmuel. Rav, Shmuel, and Rav Nahman are by no means the only sages concern- ing whom the Talmud contains a variety of perspectives which betray the existence of opposing sources. It also contains opposing views regarding the character of R. Elazar ben Pedat and his relationship to R. Yonahan, Pales- tinian amoraim of the second and third generations.40 In two stories critical of R. Elazar, for example, Resh Lakish states an opinion and Elazar follows with an opposing view.41 Later on, Resh Lakish repeats his opinion in the presence of R. Yohanan, and Yohanan states the view expressed earlier by Elazar. Resh Lakish, angry at being publicly contradicted by his teacher, denounces Elazar for stating an opinion and failing to attribute it to its author, Yohanan. In another story critical of Elazar, the well-known account of Resh Lakish's conversion to the rabbinic way of life, Elazar is 39.

In the eyes of Yohanan, say the transmitters of this story, Elazar is an unsatis- factory surrogate for Resh Lakish after the latter's tragic death. Such stories are difficult to reconcile with other narratives which portray an extremely close relationship between Yohanan and Elazar,43 or which show Yohanan, after his death, appearing to Elazar in a dream and supporting his interpre- tations.44 On another occasion, Elazar states a halakhic opinion, Yohanan follows with an objection, and Elazar successfully refutes his teacher's argu- ment. When Elazar observes his teacher's unhappiness at having been defeated in argument by his student, Elazar skillfully soothes his injured pride.45 In another context, Elazar is portrayed as a close disciple of Yo- hanan who knows how to interpret the moods of his teacher.46 Surely it is no coincidence that when Elazar alone comes in contact with Yohanan, in all but two cases47 their relationship is harmonious and Elazar is an exem- plary student. By contrast, whenever Resh Lakish is also present, Elazar's actions are unbefitting a scholar or bring him censure from his teacher.48 Interestingly, one story which makes no mention of Resh Lakish repeats the familiar charge of plagiarism against Elazar, who once again states an opin- ion and fails to attribute it to its author, Yohanan.49 Yohanan is angry with Elazar, but ultimately rejoices when R. Yaakov bar Idi brings about their reconciliation. Yaakov bar Idi cleverly compares the relationship between Yohanan and Elazar to that between the biblical heroes Moses and Joshua. The relationship between master and disciple in both instances is so close that there is no need for the disciple to quote the master by name, argues Yaakov bar Idi.

In the one context where the familiar charge of plagiarism is raised and Resh Lakish is not present, therefore, the criticism against Elazar is dismissed and he and his teacher are reconciled. Thus, the various talmudic narratives dealing with the relationship between Yohanan and Elazar contain irreconcilable contradictions and most likely derive from diverse sources. Incidentally, the fact that the diverse sources independently confirm Elazar's habit of not attributing opinions to his teacher provides significant confirmation of its historicity. Several other sages are portrayed unfavorably when found in the pres- ence of a particular amora, but come off much better when they appear in isolation or in the presence of a different amora. Close examination of each individual story is necessary before final conclusions are drawn, but a likely explanation is that stories about these amoraim derive from a variety of sources. We see this, for example, in the interactions between Rav and Rav Shila, R. Elazar and Shmuel, Rabbah and Mar Yehuda, Rava and Rav Papa bar Shmuel, Rava and Mar Zutra b. d'Rav Nahman, Rava and Rav Nah- man bar Rav Hisda, and Rava and Rami bar Hama.50 Rav Shila, for exam- ple, is portrayed unfavorably when in the presence of Rav, but comes off much better when Ray is not present or when Shmuel also figures in the story. Rav Papa bar Shmuel invariably judges or acts incorrectly whenever Rava appears in his presence or is mentioned in the same story. Rav Papa bar Shmuel judges a case, for example, Rava objects in his presence, and 50. With regard to Rav and Rav Shila, see Yoma 20b and Sanhedrin 44a, where Rav Shila appears in the presence of Rav and is portrayed unfavorably. See also Sanhedrin 109a.

Elazar and Shmuel, see Eruvin 74a and Hullin 11 b, where Shmuel appears in the presence of R. Elazar and in both cases is portrayed unfavorably. On Ketubot 77a, they appear in each other's presence and Shmuel harshly rejects R. Elazar's tradition. With regard to Rabbah and Mar Yehuda, see Eruvin 61b and Kiddushin 58a.

With regard to Rava and Mar Zutra b. d'Rav Nahman, and Rava and Rav Nahman bar Rav Hisda, see the discussion above. In cases where Rava is not involved, reaction to the opinions of Mar Zutra b. d'Rav Nahman and Rav Nahman bar Rav Hisda follows no consistent pattern. Sometimes their opinions are rejected, other times they go unchallenged.

Rava follows with one or two additional objections, and again Ray Papa bar Shmuel adjusts his position, claiming each time that he had intended to say what Rava says.5' Elsewhere, however, when Rava is not present, Ray Papa bar Shmuel comes off quite well, as a com- munity leader and judge, and as a student of Ray Yosef and Ray Hisda. In these cases as well, the contradictory portraits most likely do not admit of reconciliation and are evidence of opposing sources. The famous story of Resh Lakish's conversion to the rabbinic way of life contradicts the portrait found elsewhere of Yohanan's interaction with Resh Lakish and provides further support for the claim that the Talmud's stories derive from a variety of sources. Elsewhere in the Talmud, Yohanan and Resh Lakish frequently relate to one another as colleagues. Their interac- tion typically begins with Yohanan and Resh Lakish stating contradictory views, for example regarding the correct interpretation of a tannaitic source. Yohanan follows with an objection against Resh Lakish and Resh Lakish responds (or vice versa), after which Yohanan objects again, Resh Lakish responds, and the two amoraim continue in this fashion until the sugya con- cludes. According to the story of Resh Lakish's conversion to the rabbinic way of life, by contrast, Resh Lakish is Yohanan's student from beginning to end.52 Yohanan claims that "when I stated an opinion, Resh Lakish would follow with twenty-four objections and I would respond with twenty- four responses, and in this manner learning was increased." The lengthy dialogues referred to by Yohanan are dialogues between a teacher and his student, and not dialogues between equals. Yohanan states his view, Resh Lakish objects as a student, and Yohanan resolves his objections. Through- out the story, Resh Lakish departs from this rigid pattern only once, oppos- ing Yohanan in a halakhic dispute and confronting his teacher as an equal. As a result, however, a bitter argument breaks out between them, their rela- tionship cannot stand the strain, and both end up dying tragic deaths. This story conflicts with the picture of their relationship reflected elsewhere in the Talmud, where Resh Lakish frequently confronts Yohanan as an equal. Clearly, the Talmud preserves contradictory views regarding the nature of the relationship between Yohanan and Resh Lakish. Most likely, these con- 51. Baba Kamma 84a.

Throughout the Talmud, Ray Yosef is often portrayed as Rabbah's junior contemporary, and on occasion as his subordinate and student.54 In several other contexts, the two appear as close and cooperative colleagues." Clearly, these images are easily reconciliable. The image of Rav Yosef as student or subordinate of Rabbah might derive from early in Yosef's career, before he attained scholarly maturity, while the image of the two as coopera- tive colleagues might derive from later in his career, after he reached a scholarly level which earned him consideration as Rabbah's colleague. Some passages, however, reflect a different perspective on their relationship. In one context, Rabbah and Yosef are described as candidates for the same position of communal responsibility.56 At issue here is who is the superior scholar, whose method of learning is preferable. The Babylonian rabbis send "there," to Palestine, for a decision, and word is sent back that Yosef is pref- erable. Yosef declines, however, out of humility or due to an astrological prediction that he will rule for only two years and then die." Rabbah rules in his stead, his tenure lasting twenty-two years, and Yosef rules after him. According to this story, Yosef was the superior scholar, and it was his deci- 53.

This story is most likely an attempt on the part of sages who favor Yosef to explain why Rabbah was chosen to rule ahead of Yosef. This happened not because Rabbah was the superior scholar, these disciples or editors claim; on the contrary, Yosef was superior, and it was his decision to delay the appointment."9 The Talmud thus preserves contradic- tory views regarding the relative scholarly merits of Rabbah and Yosef which most likely derive from diverse sources. At this point in the discussion, we begin to focus again on Abaye and Rava, fourth-generation amoraim whose relationship was examined in detail in the opening sections of this paper. Rava's claim in two contexts60 that Rabbah and Yosef were unable to resolve a certain difficulty over a period of twenty-two years, and that only when Yosef became head was the matter resolved, is a clear echo of the story described above. Rava is clearly alluding to the twenty-two years that Rabbah ruled and suggesting that only when the appropriate person came into power could the matter be satisfactorily resolved. Rava, or whoever placed these sentiments into Rava's mouth, shares the view that Yosef was greater than Rabbah. It is understandable that Rava would hold such an opinion (or that such an opinion would be attributed to Rava), since he was a student of Yosef but not of Rabbah. The famous story of the death of Rabbah bar Nahmani, the third- generation amora discussed above,6' clearly derives from circles friendly to Rabbah.62 Rabbah dies, according to this story, because God and the 58. Ray Yosef's concern about the astrological prediction perhaps strikes us as supersti- tious, but it would have seemed the height of rationality to many of the rabbis of the Talmud. See, however, Pesahim 113b. Ray Yosef's denial of responsibility perhaps strikes us as less than heroic, unbefitting a man called upon to play a critical role in the leadership of his people. To the rabbis, however, Rav Yosefs actions were not in the slightest cause for criticism. Talmudic rabbis went to great lengths to delay entrance to the world-to-come, and frequently went to great lengths to avoid public office, giving themselves more time for Torah study. 59.

It was concluded above that several talmudic passages reflect the view that Yosef was superior to Rab- bah. If this is the case, then the story of Rabbah's death provides further support for the claim that the Talmud contains a variety of contradictory sources. It is difficult to imagine that people who transmitted stories whose major point is Yosef's superiority to Rabbah also transmitted a story which views Rabbah as a figure of cosmic importance.63 Furthermore, Abaye and "all of the rabbis" attend to Rabbah after his death,64 but Yosef is nowhere to be found. As Rabbah's colleague and successor in Pumbedita, his absence from the story is striking. According to some versions, in fact,65 the story serves to legitimate Abaye, and not Yosef, as Rabbah's successor in Pum- bedita. According to these versions, a message descends from heaven and falls upon the head of Abaye, designating him, and not Yosef, as Rabbah's successor. Very likely, whoever told the story of Rabbah's death disagrees with the view expressed earlier that Yosef was greater than Rabbah.66 The Talmud preserves contradictory views regarding the scholarly status of Rabbah and Yosef which most likely derive from diverse sources. The relationship between Rava and Yosef also yields evidence of oppos- ing viewpoints contained within our sources. I discussed above two state- ments attributed to Rava which reflect the view that Yosef was the greatest scholar of his generation. Several stories suggest that Yosef, and/or some of his students or later editors, did not return the compliment, that they had serious reservations about Rava's character. In a story reminiscent of the Talmud's account of Rav's initial meeting with Shmuel (see above), Rav Dimi MiNehardea comes to Mahoza to sell some produce.67 Rava tells his disciple, Rav Ada bar Ahava, to test Rav Dimi's learning, using the same expression used by Shmuel when he sends Karna to test Rav. At the request of the exilarch, Rava wants to find out if Rav Dimi deserves a market privi- 63. Note, however, that on Moed Katan 28a, Rava is portrayed as speaking highly of Rab- bah. Compare Ketubot 42b and Baba Kamma 66b. 64. Rava's presence there is almost certainly a scribal error, as Rabbinovicz in Dikdukei Sopherim, n. dalet, already observed. 65. See Dikdukei Sopherim, n. bet, and Yeshayahu Gafni, "'Yeshiva' u-'Metivta,'" p. 25, n. 64. 66. We must be wary, however, about placing too much weight on an argument from silence. 67. Baba Batra 22a.</page><page sequence="19">STORIES ABOUT THE RABBIS AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE BAVLI 197 lege granted to sages. Dimi is unable to answer the question posed to him, whereupon Ada bar Ahava makes an insulting gesture toward him and refers to himself as the teacher of Dimi, and to Rava as "the teacher of your teacher." Dimi is not granted the special market privilege, and his produce spoils. Dimi goes before Yosef to complain, and Yosef assures him that just as God did not delay punishment on behalf of the king of Edom, so he will not delay in punishing those who wronged Rav Dimi.68 This story most like- ly derives from sources hostile to Rava, sources which have an interest in portraying him in an unattractive light and in showing poor relations between Rava and his teacher, Rav Yosef. In another story critical of Rava, Rava sends a halakhic question to Yosef.69 Yosef sends back a reply, and Rava issues a clarification, explain- ing that Yosef misunderstood his question. Yosef takes offense, complaining that Rava fails to show him proper respect. "If he doesn't need us," asks Yosef, "why does he send questions to us?" Rava learns that Yosef is offend- ed and goes to him personally to make amends. Rava mixes Yosef's cup, like a student before his master, showing him that he, Rava, still considers him- self to be Yosef's student. Yosef then quotes a series of biblical verses and asks Rava to explain them, like a teacher examining his student. Rava will- ingly plays the role of a student in order to mollify his insulted teacher, inter- preting the scripture quoted by Yosef as a warning against the evil of too much pride. By interpreting scripture in this manner, Rava in effect con- fesses his sin and accepts the blame for offending his teacher.70 Yosef thus plays a prominent role in several stories critical of Rava. These stories provide an interesting contrast to several cases in which Rava is presented as reporting his interaction with Yosef, or quoting statements by Yosef, and providing no hint of any tension between them.7" Also inter- 68. The text goes on to say that Rav Ada bar Ahava died, suggesting that Rav Yosefs words were directed against Rav Ada bar Ahava rather than Rava. However, it is clear that the teacher, Rava, who sent his student to test a fellow sage and who no doubt made the final deci- sion to deny Rav Dimi market privileges, is also responsible. Furthermore, the sentence informing us of Rav Ada bar Ahava's death very likely does not end the previous story but rather begins the following section. Accordingly, the text provides no indication that Rava is not the object of Rav Yosefs wrath. 69. Nedarim 55a. The long narrative on Nedarim 55a might be a combination of two stories, one of which is also found on Eruvin 54b. 70.

Ketubot 42b and 43a (twice), and Hullin 133a.</page><page sequence="20">198 RICHARD KALMIN esting is the fact that most or possibly all of the stories involving Yosef which are critical of Rava take place while Rava is no longer Yosef's disciple in Pumbedita. Very likely, these stories reflect the view of sages who viewed with great disfavor Rava's decision to move to a new locality and assert independence of his master. Very likely, they unfavorably contrasted Rava with Abaye, who makes brief appearances in most of these stories.72 Unlike Rava, Abaye remained in Pumbedita his entire life, a loyal disciple first of Rabbah and later of Yosef. The Talmud preserves contradictory views regarding the character of Rava and his relationship to Rav Yosef which most likely derive from diverse sources. Support for this interpretation might be found in another narrative which describes Rava's interaction with Rav Yosef.73 According to this story, Rava is in the habit of making an extravagant gesture of humility and submission to Rav Yosef whenever he leaves Yosef's presence. Yosef hears about it and says to Rava: "May it be [God's] will that your head be elevat- ed over the entire town." Yosefs blessing, when viewed in the context of Rava's entire career, is perhaps deliberately ironic. The transmitters of this story know full well that Rava never ruled in Pumbedita. Perhaps the story intends to contrast Rava's behavior while still a student, winning his master's favor and deserving of his blessing, with his behavior after he broke with Yosef and moved to Mahoza. Perhaps the implication is that Rava, had he wished, could have stayed in Pumbedita and ruled the entire city, thereby avoiding a painful break with his master. The claim that stories about Rava reached the Talmud from more than a single source is borne out by one passage of Palestinian origin.74 In this passage, Rava's statement is introduced by the following formula: "They said in the west [Palestine] that R. Yosi bar Hama and R. Zera, and some say Rava b. d'Rav Yosef bar Hama and R. Zera, said the following . . ." Rava's statement, also found in the Yerushalmi, is unique in that it reached the Babylonian Talmud via Palestine, as the statement's introduction makes clear ("They said in the west .. .").75 Confirmation of this claim is provided 72.

Abba. In Palestine, it was necessary to identify him as Rava son of Ray Yosef b. d'Rav Hama.77 Elsewhere in the Babylonian Talmud, Rava is referred to in this manner only in stories where some narrative purpose is filled by doing so. For example, if Rava is still a youth when the story is tak- ing place, or if another rabbi wishes to humble or belittle him, Rava will be referred to as "the son of Rav Yosef b. d'Rav Hama.""78 Only in this one context, where the tradition comes to Babylonia via Palestine, is Rava referred to by his father's name even though no narrative purpose is served. This fact clearly aids us in identifying the Palestinian role in formulating the tradition, and supports my contention that traditions regarding Rava reached the Talmud from more than a single source. Very likely, Rava's appellation in another narrative aids us in detecting the presence of a hostile source. In this narrative, "the father of Rav Yosef b. d'Rava" sends his son to study with Rav Yosef, stipulating that the son stay away for six years.79 The story is clearly critical of Rava for making exces- sive demands of his son, demands which lead to family strife when the son comes home ahead of schedule, unable to meet his father's expectations."8 It is peculiar that Rava, one of the towering figures in the Babylonian Talmud, should be referred to as "the father of Rav Yosef b. d'Rava." By referring to Rava in this manner, the narrator shifts attention away from the father and onto his son, as if the actions of Rav Yosef b. d'Rava, an obscure amora who seldom appears in the Talmud,8' are of greater interest than the actions of the father. By referring to Rava in this manner, the narrator creates the impression that the son is the story's protagonist and the father part of the supporting cast. Once again, the name by which Rava is designated aids us in detecting the presence of a hostile source. Perhaps we find evidence that not everyone in Babylonia considered 76. Other talmudic rabbis are referred to in more than one way, which some scholars have taken as evidence of diverse sources. See, for example, David Halivni, Mekorot u-Mesorot.

More disciples studied with Rav than with Ray Huna, and more studied with Rav Huna than with Rabbah and Ray Yosef.83 "When the rabbis left the house of Abaye," the text continues, "and some say the house of Rav Papa, and some say the house of Rav Ashi, two hundred rabbis remained, and they called themselves orphans of orphans."84 Most versions make no reference to Rava,85 and it is quite possible that the omission is intentional. Perhaps whoever excluded Rava's name did not view him as worthy of inclusion alongside the other amoraim mentioned on the list. Perhaps this passage provides further evidence that stories about amoraim reflect a variety of perspectives and reached the Talmud from more than a single source. Stories which emphasize Abaye's deficiencies as judge and halakhic de- cisor, and which contrast Abaye unfavorably with Rava, were alluded to above."86 These stories suggest strongly that some of the Talmud's sources were composed and transmitted by sages who wished to portray Abaye in an unfavorable light.87 I emphasize the phrase some of the Talmud's sources, however, since the bulk of the Talmud's sources display no such animus toward Abaye. One illustration of this claim is provided by the relatively polite way in which Rava's objections against Abaye are phrased through- 82. Ketubot 106a. Gafni, "Hiburim Nestorianim ke-Makor le-Toldot Yeshivot Bavel," pp. 574-575, notes that Christian sources preserve a strikingly similar account of the gradual decline of the Nestorian academy at Nisibis (Nezivin). 83. Note the coupling of Rabbah and Rav Yosef, creating the impression that they presided over a single, unified house of study. See the discussion above. 84. Goodblatt, Rabbinic Instruction in Sassanian Babylonia, pp. 56-57, basing himself on the chronology of Rav Sherira Gaon, dates the core of this passage, the section dealing with Rav, Rav Huna, and Rabbah and Rav Yosef, to the middle third of the fourth century. Good- blatt views the concluding section as an attempt by students of Abaye, Rav Papa, and Rav Ashi to update the tradition so that mention would be made of their own teachers, whom they con- sidered to be the greatest scholars of their generation. 85.

Nothing in Rava's reactions to Abaye compares to the harsh language used on several occasions by Shmuel in rejecting the opinions of Rav, for example, or by Rav in rejecting the opinions of Shmuel.88 Significantly, a single individual, Rav Ada bar Ahava, is associat- ed with many of the sources hostile to Abaye. Judging from the evidence of the Talmud, Ada bar Ahava was a zealous disciple of Rava who had an extremely low opinion of Abaye. Most of Ada bar Ahava's contemporaries, according to the talmudic portrait, did not share this opinion.89 They did not share the same intense desire to portray Abaye as Rava's inferior. It would be premature to conclude from the stories examined above that the Talmud grants little or no direct access to the statements of Rava and Abaye, Rabbah and Rav Yosef, Resh Lakish and R. Yohanan, and Rav and Shmuel, but rather contains collections of opposing versions of their state- ments transmitted with polemical intent by their disciples. It cannot yet be concluded that we have little besides tendentious accounts formulated by students or later editors. I say this because all of the evidence for polemical distortion examined above is found in the context of stories. Very likely, the authors and transmitters of talmudic stories, both halakhic and aggadic, often had free rein to engage in "creative historiography,"90 to distort or 88. Shabbat 53a, Eruvin 78a, Moed Katan 12b, Ketubot 77a, Kiddushin 44b, and Hullin I I lb. 89. See Berakhot 56a, according to which Abaye's students went on to become disciples of Rava after the death of Abaye. Because of the miraculous elements contained in the story, and because of its obvious character as propaganda (serving to legitimate Rava as successor to Abaye), it is difficult to evaluate this narrative as history. Nevertheless, the evidence of the Talmud supports Bar Hedia's claim that "Abaye will die and his metivta will go to you [Rava]." That is, most of Abaye's students went on to become students of Rava. Throughout tractates Berakhot, Pesahim, Bezah, Ketubot, Nedarim, Baba Mezia, Baba Batra, and Makkot, we find the following amoraim active as Abaye's students: Abba bar Marta, Rav Ada bar Matna, Rav Aha bar Manyumi, Rav Idi bar Abin, Rav Huna b. d'Rav Yehoshua, Rav Huna b. d'Rav Moshe bar Azrei, Rav Zevid, Rav Hiyya b. d'Rav Huna, Rav Hinena b. d'Rav Ika, Rav Tavyumi, Rav Yemar bar Shelamya, Rav Yaakov bar Abba, Rav Kahana, Rav Menashya bar G'da, Rav Mari b. d'Bat Shmuel, Rav Nihumi bar Zecharya, Rav Papa, Rav bar Rav Hanan, Rava bar Sharshom, Rav Rehumi, Rav Sheravya, and possibly Rav Avya. Of these students, all were also students of Rava with the exception of Abba bar Marta, Rav Idi bar Abin (but see Moed Katan 16a), Rav Menashya bar G'da, Rav Nihumi bar Zecharya, Rava bar Sharshom, and possibly Rav Aha bar Manyumi (however, see Nedarim 47b). I doubt that these students were disciples of both amoraim at the same time, for such students would have constituted a living link of communication between the schools of Abaye and Rava, and the Talmud pre- serves no evidence of such a link. 90.

The transmitters of halakhic statements in a strictly academic setting, by contrast, may have worked under more rigid constraints.9' They may have been more limited with regard to the types of additions they could make to the sources at their disposal.92 To reiterate, we have examined the Talmud's portrayal of several rabbis who flourished between the first and the fourth amoraic generations, most notably Rav and Shmuel, R. Yohanan, Resh Lakish, and R. Elazar ben Pedat, Rabbah and Rav Yosef, and Abaye and Rava. It was repeatedly found that talmudic accounts of their characters and personalities and the nature of their interactions contain contradictions which betray the exis- tence of opposing sources. Accordingly, several important aspects of the history of the amoraic period need to be reevaluated, since historians have tended to accept talmudic stories as reliable evidence without critically evaluating the role of authors, tradents, and later editors in coloring, distort- ing, and even fabricating stories about the amoraim.

Baumgarten, "Rabbi Judah I and His Opponents," Journal for the Study ofJudaism 12, no. 2 (1981): 141-142, and the literature cited in n. 28 there. 92. The work of David Halivni, Shama Friedman, and others in separating the additions of the anonymous editors from amoraic legal dicta may contradict this suggestion. See David Halivni, Mekorot u-Mesorot: Nashim and Mekorot u-Mesorot: Yoma-Hagigah (Jerusalem: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1975); Mekorot u-Mesorot: Shabbat; and Mekorot u-Mesorot: Eruvin-Pesahim (Jerusalem: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1982); and Shama Friedman, Perek ha-Isha Rabbah ba-Bavli (Jerusalem: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1978). However, we will not be in a position to fully appreciate the work of the anonymous editors in altering their amoraic sources until the discrete analyses of individual sugyot have been systematically analyzed and the full range of anonymous editorial activity catalogued and described. See Kalmin, Redaction of the Babylonian Talmud, pp. 66-94, for a systematic analysis of the anony- mous editorial commentary based on statements by the latest amoraim mentioned in the Talmud.</page><page sequence="25">STORIES ABOUT THE RABBIS AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE BAVLI 203 Bibliographical Note A comprehensive bibliography on the crucial subject of the use of tal- mudic stories as evidence for history and biography cannot be provided in the context of the present paper. See, however, Bacher, Die Agada der Babylonischen Amoraer, pp. 34 and 114-115, who reconciles conflicting talmudic accounts of the interaction between Ray and Shmuel and between Abaye and Rava by claiming that each of these relationships was a peculiar combination of closeness, collegiality, and intense competition. See also Moshe D. Herr, "The Historical Significance of the Dialogues Between Jewish Sages and Roman Dignitaries," and Shmuel Safrai, "Tales of the Sages in the Palestinian Tradition and the Babylonian Talmud," Scripta Hierosolymitana 22 (1971): 209-232. Safrai acknowledges differences in various versions of aggadot, but they are "two accounts of the same event" (p. 210). Safrai assumes that "generally, too, the names of the Sages ... are not confused in these narratives handed down by tradition, nor are the rela- tions between them inconsistent with respect to the times" (ibid.). See also Graetz, Geschichte der Juden, vol. 4, pp. 258, 266-267, and 329-331; Urbach, Ha-Halacha, pp. 192-216; Joshua Schwartz, "Tension Between Palestinian Scholars and Babylonian Olim in Amoraic Palestine," Journal for the Study of Judaism 11 (1980): 78-94; and Yoel Florsheim, "Ha- Yahasim bein Hakhmei ha-Dor ha-Sheni shel Amoraei Bavel," Zion (1986): 285-293. Florsheim assumes that talmudic narratives can be com- bined together to form coherent biographies. Contradictory sources are explained as deriving from different periods within an amora's life. Jacob Neusner, by contrast, argues convincingly that at times the con- tradictions do not admit of reconciliation. See, for example, Neusner, History of the Jews in Babylonia, vol. 3, pp. 50-94, and vol. 4, pp. 73-82 and 85-124, and The Rabbinic Traditions About the Pharisees Before 70 (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1979), especially pp. 184-341. See also Baruch M. Bokser, "Wonder-Working and the Rabbinic Tradition: The Case of Hanina ben Dosa," Journal for the Study of Judaism 16, no. 1 (1985): 42-92, and the references cited on p. 43, n. 2. See also Gafni, "Hiburim Nestorianim," pp. 574-575, who analyzes stories about Babylonian rabbis and discovers motifs also present in Nestorian literature. Gafni argues that these parallels "do not necessarily attest to contact" between the two communities, but might be motifs absorbed independently into the two literatures. At least some of the biographical information preserved in the Talmud concerning</page><page sequence="26">204 RICHARD KALMIN Babylonian amoraim, therefore, cannot be accepted at face value as his- torical fact. See also Daniel Sperber, "On the Unfortunate Adventures of Rav Kahana: A Passage of Saboraic Polemic from Sasanian Persia," in Irano-Judaica, ed. Shaul Shaked (Jerusalem: Ben-Zvi Institute, 1982), pp. 83-100. Sperber argues persuasively that the story is a pro-Babylonian polemic and cannot be accepted as evidence for conditions in Palestine dur- ing the time of R. Yohanan. Compare Gafni, "Ha-Yeshiva he-Bavlit la-Or Sugyat B.K. 117a," pp. 292-301. See also Fraenkel, Iyyunim ba-Olamo ha-Ruhani shel Sippur ha-Agadah. On p. 8, Fraenkel writes that he is not interested in the ancient rabbinic stories for the historical and biographical information they contain, but rather as sources for the rabbis' answers to eternal human questions. Whether or not such and such really happened to Hillel or R. Akiba is, for the purposes of Fraenkel's study, irrelevant. See also Fraenkel, "Bible Verses Quoted in Tales of the Sages," Scripta Hiero- solymitana 22 (1971): 89, n. 23, who writes: "It must be stated that in prin- ciple one should not rely on parallels in a literary analysis of talmudic stories, but look for the intrinsic unity in every story. That is also why the general image of a sage can differ from one story to the next, which is natur- al if different narrators told the stories, and there is no need for any artificial harmonization." See also Anthony J. Saldarini, "The Adoption of a Dis- sident: Akabya ben Mahalaleel in Rabbinic Tradition," Journal of Jewish Studies 33 (1982): 547-556. Saldarini observes that the story of Akabya's excommunication in Mishnah Eduyot 5:6-7 fits the purposes of the editors of the Mishnah. Whatever historical kernel may be contained within the story, he concludes, is unrecoverable. See also William Scott Green, "What's in a Name?

See also Zipporah Kagan, "Divergent Tendencies and Their Literary Moulding in the Aggadah," Scripta Hierosolymitana 22 (1971): 151-170. Kagan finds that the versions of the story of the early years of R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus' life divide into two groups. One group is "earlier and more authentic. The Aggadah in Group A was told close to the</page><page sequence="27">STORIES ABOUT THE RABBIS AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE BAVLI 205 time when the events took place and for that reason it preserved a more realistic view of the figures, the plot, and numerous details.
