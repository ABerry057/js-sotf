Sharpe An Anthology of Jewish-Russian Literature Two Centuries of Dual Identity in Prose and Poetry Two-volume set Edited by Maxim D. Shrayer, Boston College This definitive anthology gathers stories, essays, memoirs, excerpts from novels, and poems by more than 130 Jewish writers of the past two centuries who worked in the Russian language. It features writers of the tsarist, Soviet, and post-Soviet periods, both in Russia and in the great emigrations, representing styles and artistic movements from Romantic to Postmodern. The authors include figures who are not widely known today, as well as writers of world renown. Most of the works appear here for the first time in English or in new translations. The editor of the anthology, Maxim D. Shrayer, is a leading authority on Jewish-Russian literature. He made his selections not simply on the basis of an author's background, but because each work illuminates questions of Jewish history, status, and identity. Each author is profiled in an essay describing the personal, cultural, and historical context in which the writer worked, and individual works or groups of works are headnoted to provide further context. The first volume spans the nineteenth century and the first part of the twentieth century, and includes the editor's extensive introduction to the Jewish-Russian literary canon. The second volume covers the period from the death of Stalin to the present. Each section of the anthology includes an introduction and each volume includes a corresponding survey of Jewish-Russian history by John D. Klier of University College, London, as well as detailed bibliographies of historical and literary sources. 2006 * 992 pages * Two volumes * Bibliographies, indexes.

BETRAYING SPINOZA THE RENEGADE JEW WHO GAVE US MODERNITY by Rebecca Goldstein His doubts about God, scripture, and the fate of the soul made Baruch Spinoza the most famous heretic in Judaism. But as Rebecca Goldstein argues in this brilliant biography, Spinoza has mysteriously become not the last traditional Jew but the first modern one. Goldstein braids her narrative gifts as a novelist with her deep learning as a professor of philosophy to present an image of Spinoza that is at once deeply human and personal and at the same time hauntingly emblematic. SCHOCKEN/NEXTBOOK I CLOTH 304 PAGES 1 $19.95 SUITE FRANCAISE by Irene Nemirovsky Translated by Sandra Smith By the early 1940s, when Ukranian-born Irene Nemirovsky began working on what would become Suite FranFaise-the first two parts of a planned five-part novel-she was already a highly successful writer living in Paris. But she was also a Jew, and in 1942 she was arrested and deported to Auschwitz: a month later she was dead at the age of thirty- nine. Sixty-four years later, at long last, her literary masterpiece is revealed to the world. Suite FranFaise is a singularly piercing evocation-at once subtle and severe, deeply compassionate and fiercely ironic-of life and death in occupied France, and a brilliant, profoundly moving work of art.
