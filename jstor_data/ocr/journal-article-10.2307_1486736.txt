<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS 109 Jacob Licht. A Commentary on the Book ofNumbers XXII-XXVI. Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1995, 209 pp. (Hebrew). This is the third and final installment of Jacob Licht's commentary on Numbers, posthumously completed by his pupil Samuel Ahituv with the assistance of his wife, Arela, from notes on the final chapters left behind by the author. Each verse is discussed in four sections: Masoretic text, commentary, notes and variants in manuscripts, and versions. The book is divided into thirteen units, each of which is preceded by short excursuses on the main themes and concluded by a survey of the positions taken by scholars on these themes. A mere glance at this apparatus and its bibliography suffices for a realization that Licht's commentary is comprehensive. It is particularly rich in mining the halakhic and aggadic lore of the rabbis. The exegetical problems are discussed in the notes, and the historical, geographical, and theological issues are debated in the excursuses. The excursuses on chap. 35 (pp. 172-190) dealing with the Levitic cities, the city asylums, and the laws of homicide are particularly noteworthy for their comprehensiveness, considering that Licht's commentary consists of a scant 200 pages. It is literally "packed," expedited in no small degree by the unique space-saving sigla which Licht devised in the notes. There are some lacunae. The total absence of maps is a serious deficiency, since the end of Numbers deals with a summation of the wilderness itineraries (chap. 33), the settlement of Transjordan (chap. 32), and the boundaries of the land of Canaan (chap. 34)-subjects for which maps are indispensable. Here and there the bibliography is deficient. For example, there is no reference to F. M. Cross's discussion of the wilderness stations.' Surprisingly, there is no bibliography for the last chapter-all of which can be attributed to the untimely death of the author. Licht does not content himself with presenting summaries of the views on the moot issues but freely offers his own solutions. They are generally conser- vative and are fully substantiated, balanced, and well reasoned. Nonetheless there is much that this reviewer cannot accept. These are some examples: p. 1. Licht disregards the Wiederaufnahme (resumptive repetition) of Numbers 22:21b, 35b, a sign that 22:22-35 is an interpolation intended to ridicule Balaam, who otherwise is treated favorably in both the narrative 1. Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic (Cambridge, Mass., 1973).</page><page sequence="2">110 BOOK REVIEWS and poetry of the Balaam Scroll (chaps. 22-24), and also, contra Licht, an indication that the narrative is not later than the poetry. p. 19. On 22:11. ndqab in Leviticus 24:11, 16 does not mean "curse" but "articulate" (YHWH's name). p. 51. On 25:13. Phineas is promised by God to be the founder not of the high priesthood but the Temple priesthood. p. 56 On 26:54-56. There is no need to postulate a complex succession of lots; rather, the land is apportioned both by considerations of size and geography and by the use of lots. p. 83. The 'd.?m is never a public sacrifice. p. 88. On 28:6. The q6deS is the shrine, not the sacred precincts. p. 91. On 28:23-24. With I. Knohl,2 the prepositions milbad and 'al are indicators of two discreet traditions. pp. 98-101. I doubt that there are two subcategories of vows, setdmim (general) and mtbhdqim (specific), whereby the former are equivalent to nedabd (freewill) sacrifices. Even where conditions (the signs of specific vows) are not stipulated, they can be assumed. Thus in Psalms 116:14, 18, the psalmist has recovered from some life-threatening distress (vv. 3-9), the probable motivation for offering his vow. p. 174. Even if the average city in First Temple times was 500 x 300 cubits, the prescription for the migrai (pen enclosures)--1000 cubits on each side-is not "hutzpa," in consideration of the future growth of the city. My differences with Licht are spelled out in my commentary on Numbers.3 However, one should note that in the main, the differences cited above are of opinion, not citations of factual errors. This, I submit, constitutes the highest praise that can be paid by any reviewer. There is no doubt in my mind that Licht's commentary will take its place as a standard work for generations to come.
