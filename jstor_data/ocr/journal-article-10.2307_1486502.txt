<plain_text><page sequence="1">Avigdor Levy. The Sephardim of the Ottoman Empire. Princeton, N.J.: Darwin Press, 1992. xv, 196 pp. Many a book has started its conceptual life as an extended article, with attached appendices, bibliography, and photographs. The present volume is a variation on this theme: it is an extended version of an introductory essay to a volume of conference papers, published separately.' Reference to the individual conference papers is by author's full name within parentheses written into the text without date or page number; other references are given in notes. While this system merely reflects the fact that the text was published before the conference papers, it highlights the contributions of the conference participants and, for some readers, will help put them in a conceptual framework. 1.

Unlike what might be expected in an introduction to a volume of essays, some of the articles announced for the companion volume are virtually unmentioned here, and there is no attempt to discuss comprehensively the findings of each individual contributor or the value of the research presented. Presumably this is left for the introduction to the companion volume itself. Arguably, the history of the Sephardim of the Ottoman Empire is essentially the history of the Jews of the empire, and the present volume is an excellent survey of this subject. Of course it discusses the achievements of the Sephardic immigrants and the tensions between them and the Romaniot and the other indigenous Jews. Yet this hardly means that there is a peculiarly Sephardic focus. Indeed, the story here is not particularly the preservation or development of Ottoman Sephardic culture, music, or literature, or even the "sephardization" of Ottoman Jewry as such. Rather the concerns are such things as Jewish immigration and migration, social movements, and political and communal developments, both in the Jewish community and in the way the Ottoman Empire related to it. Levy divides Ottoman history essentially into three more or less standard periods: the "Ottoman-Jewish symbiosis in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries," a period of "standstill and decline," and the modern era. Levy begins the period of decline in 1580, noting such factors as the last major Ottoman conquest (the recapture of Tunis) in 1576, the rapid growth of an industrializing Europe, including its discovery of new trade routes and a New World which marginalized the Middle East, and Ottoman misrule reflecting in part the disastrous policies imposed by a cash-pressed government. Levy starts the modern era, a period of about one hundred years, not with the tanzimat in 1839, but with the defeat of the Janissaries (1826) and the challenges posed by Greek independence. On the whole, there is a positive, almost triumphalist reading of the subject. During the period of decline, Levy points to a number of bright points, such as reform-minded rulers who were able, temporarily, to reverse the trend. Typical of this approach is his applause for Ottoman handling of Shabbetai Tzevi, and his discussion of some of the positive repercussions of the Sabbatian affair within the Jewish community. He also points to the achievements of individual Jews throughout the era, and the general success of some of the major Jewish communities, such as Istanbul,</page><page sequence="3">224 BOOK REVIEWS Edirne, and Salonica, and for a time Izmir, in preserving and promoting their economic and social vitality and security well into this period. This approach is best exemplified by the theme with which the book both begins and ends: the Ottoman Jewish celebration of the quadri- centennial of the Spanish expulsion in 1892. In the first pages, Levy reprints a panegyric written for this occasion in which the events of 1492 are depicted as a triumph, a glorious salvation in Istanbul for the once-reviled exiles. After discussing problems in Ottoman-Jewish relations up to the end of the empire in 1923, Levy returns in the final pages to the quadricentennary, to describe how the 1890s were the best years of modern times for Ottoman Jewry, then a vibrant Jewish community, the fifth-largest in the world. This type of approach is infinitely better than a catalogue of persecutions and degradations in what Mark Cohen has labeled the "Neo-Lachrymose" style of Jewish historiography; it is more productive and interpretive, and probably truer to historical reality. Yet readers of this volume who are unfamiliar with Ottoman Jewish history may wish to balance and contrast the approach with different readings of the tenor of Ottoman-Jewish relations, for example the material on this subject which appeared in Jane Gerber's more general work on the Sephardim, which also appeared in 1992.2 The prime contributions of this volume would appear to be its ac- cessibility to students, its accuracy and erudition, its command of the bibliography, and the provision of a conceptual framework for the com- munal history of Ottoman Jewry. While telling its story in a way that can be used with undergraduates, it provides an important resource and a suggestive interpretational framework for those involved in teaching and research. Although this is a subjective observation, this reviewer was impressed by the frequency with which S. Rosanes's classic history of the Jews in Turkey was the only reference given in a note.3 This fact alone speaks eloquently about the need for more research in this field. Hopefully, the present work and its accompanying conference volume, as well as other works by the scholars who participated in the conference and all the others 2.
