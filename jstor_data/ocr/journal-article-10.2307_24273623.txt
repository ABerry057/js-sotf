Goldenberg For Yisrael Meir Shain רבא דינקותא לא משתכח A strange statement appears in Maimonides' (d. 1204) code of Jewish law, the Mishneh Tor ah. When dealing with prohibited marriages, Maimonides writes that a convert from among the gentiles, including the seven Canaanite nations (Deuteronomy 7:3), may marry within the Jewish community. Originally there were some exceptions to this in regard to four nations: Ammon, Moab, Egypt, and Edom. However, Sennacherib, King of Assyria, commingled all the nations, and since then these four nations have been mixed up with all the other permitted nations, and they have all become permitted. "Thus a convert these days, whether he be an Edomite, an Egyptian, an Ammonite, a Moabite, a Kushite, or any other nation, whether male or female, is permitted to enter the community [of Israel, i.e. to marry within the community] immediately."1 As noted by Abraham I. Karelitz, the inclusion of the Kushite is problematic. There are biblical prohibitions against marrying Edomites, Egyptians, Ammonites, and Moabites (Deuteronomy 23:4, 8-9), but there is neither a biblical nor a rabbi nic prohibition against the Kushite.2 Why then did Maimonides find it necessary to say that marriage with a Kushite convert is permitted? When was it ever prohib ited? I know of only two attempted explanations of this enigmatic statement. Shalom Dov Wolpo argued that the term "Kushite" in this text means Egyptian or part-Egyptian.3 Indeed, such a usage is found in midrashic and poetic 1. 1.

Goldenberg literature.4 Maimonides' text, however, is neither; rather, it is a law code, where precise language is to be expected. The other attempt at an explanation was made by Yosef Kafah, who says that the Kushites were included in the biblical curse of slavery (Genesis 9:25).5 Maimonides, however, is not speaking of slaves in this passage but of biblically prohibited nations, and, in any case, a man umitted slave is considered to be Jewish and is permitted to marry within the Jewish people (see below). There is indeed no biblical or rabbinic precedent for Maimonides' strange law, which is not mentioned in the other law codes nor in those early commentators who cite this section of Mishneh Torah, such as Jacob b. Asher (d. 1340) and David Pardo (d. 1790).6 As we shall see, Maimo nides' text is based on: (a) a perception of the ethnic heritage of black Africans that was common in the medieval Muslim (and, to some extent, also in the Eastern Christian) world; (b) the halakhah regarding the Jewish status of one with an enslaved past, and the complexities involved in determining such a past; and (c) assumptions concerning the past and present enslavement of black Africans, assumptions also common to the Muslim world in which Maimonides lived. These elements, together with an anti-Black sentiment frequently found in Maimonides' Muslim environment, and reflected elsewhere in Maimonides' writings, combine to explain Maimonides' halakhah. Maimonides' Source(s) Who were the Kushites to whom Maimonides refers? A clue is provided by two texts from the geonic period: Halakhot Pesukot, traditionally attributed to Yehudai Gaon of the 8th century, and Halakhot Gedolot, attributed to Shim'on Kayyara of the 9th century. The first states: These Zanj [zng'yy]-if they convert, they are permitted to enter the commu nity. Also the "seven nations" (Deuteronomy 7:1) - if they convert, they are permitted.7 4.

Schlossberg (Versailles: Cerf, 1886), a circa 10th-century (place unknown) Hebrew translation of Halakhot Pesukot, omits the sentence regarding the Zanj (36). On the authorship of Halakhot Pesukot, see Neil (Nahman) Danzig, Mavo' le-sefer halakhot pesukot (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1993), 17-37. The most recent discussion of authorship is that of Robert Brody, The Geonim of Babylonia and the Shaping of Medieval Jewish Culture (New Haven: 30</page><page sequence="3">"It Is Permitted to Marry a Kushite" The second work, Halakhot Gedolot, has: The seven nations who concluded peace [with Israel] before [Joshua's] con quest of the Land, are permitted to enter the community of Israel. The biblical prohibition of the seven nations applies only to those who were in Israel [at the time of the conquest], but those who were outside the Land were not prohib ited by the Bible. And these Zanj—if they convert, they are permitted to enter the community. There are some rabbis who disagree in regard to the Zanj and the seven nations, [holding the opinion] that they may not enter the commu nity, and that even if they convert, they are in the category of "You shall not marry them" (Deuteronomy 7:3).8 The word 'Zanj' is apparently related to 'Azania,' the name given to the stretch of the East African coast from the horn of Africa in the north to the island of Zanzibar (whose first element is similarly related to 'Zanj') in the south.9 Thousands of Zanj inhabitants were enslaved by the Muslim rulers and shipped to Iraq to work the salt marshes of the Tigris-Euphrates delta.10 While 'Zanj' referred originally to East Yale University Press, 1998), 217-221, who concludes that the evidence for Yehudai Gaon as the author of Halakhot Pesukot is "untenable" although "its contents undoubtedly reflect, on the whole, ... the Geonic academies of the late eighth or early ninth centuries" (220-221). Some years earlier, Brody wrote that "there is considerable evidence to support a dating of Halakhot Pesukot as much as a century after Yehudai Gaon" (Le-Toledot nusah ha-She'Utot [New York: American Academy for Jewish Research, 1991], xvi, n. 38). 8.

Tel Aviv: Leon, 1942), 215b. These three editions represent different recensions but they all agree on the text quoted. In regard to its date of composition, Danzig, Mavo', 185, favors the last quarter of the 9th century, while the generally accepted opinion places its composition not later than 825 (on authorship, see 175-180). Brody, The Geonim of Babylonia, 228-229, concludes that "the most we can say with confidence is that Halakhot Gedolot is a ninth-century work, although it does seem likely ... that it should be assigned approximately to mid-century;" see also 227, n. 51. 9.

According to Felix Chami, "People and Contacts in the Ancient Western Indian Ocean Seaboard or Azania," Man and Environment 27 no.l (2002): 33, "Zanj" replaced "Azania."

Cyril Hromnik, however, thinks that the name derives from the Indian name Ajan-bar (Indo-Africa: Towards a New Understanding of the History of Sub-Saharan Africa Africa [Cape Town: Juta, 1981], 44).

Goldenberg Africans from a specific geographic area, a meaning it appears to have in the geonic works (as we shall see), in time the term came to refer to black Africans in general, a transference apparently based on skin color.11 It would appear that this wider meaning underlies Maimonides' reference to the Kushites, with one or both of the geonic texts providing the source for the halakhah in Mishneh Torah.12 The geonic sources indicate a (rejected) position that marriage with the Zanj was prohibited. This is stated explicitly in Halakhot Gedolot (attributed to "some rabbis") and implicitly in Halakhot Pesukot. Why should this be the case? Neil Danzig correctly rejects the possibility that the source of the prohibition is a state ment found in some medieval texts that Moses did not have sexual relations with his "Kushite" wife (based on Numbers 12:1) because it was not permitted to marry the descendants of Ham. The statement appears first in the Chronicles of Moses the the Orient: Cultural Synthesis in Pre-colonial Times, eds. H. Neville Chittick and Robert i. Rotberg (New York: Africana, 1975), 116-129. Paulo Fernando de Moraes Farias argued that the more general meaning of Zanj is "barbarian, savage" and in this he is followed by Renault; see de Moraes Farias, "Models of the World and Categorical Models: The 'Enslavable Barbarian' as a Mobile Classi ficatoryficatory Label," Slavery and Abolition 1 (1980): 120-123 and in J. R. Willis, ed., Slaves and Slavery in Muslim Muslim Africa (London; Totowa, NJ: F. Cass, 1985), 1:32-36, and Renault, La traite des noirs, 60. See further on the meaning of "Zanj," J. Wansbrough, "Africa and the Arab Geographers,'' in Language and History History in Africa, ed. D. Dalby (London: Cass, 1970), 97-99, who tentatively proposes that those who joined the Zanj revolt of 869-883, even if neither Black nor slave, became "Zanj." 11. For the later, more general meaning of 'Zanj,' see Bernard Lewis, Race and Slavery in the Middle Middle East (New York: Oxford University Press, 1990), 50; Francois Renault, ibid.; Alexandre Popovic, The Revolt of African Slaves, 14—15. As for the transference from an ethnic to a color term, cf. Al-Biruni's reference to zanjT, the mineral hematite found in Egypt, which is "extremely black" (al-mutanahl 'l-sawad), quoted by Marina Tolmacheva, "Definition," 111. Similarly, the pharmacological writer Ibn al-Baytar (13th cent.) says that black rhubarb is called zanj from its color and not from its provenance (Encyclopedia of Islam, 2nd ed. [Leiden: Brill] 11:445a). In rabbinic sources we find the same linguistic transference with the word kushi, referring to dark wine and citrons (etrog\,(etrog\, see Goldenberg, Curse of Ham, 116-117. 12. An anonymous reader for this article has rightly noted that 'black African' and kushi are culturally constructed terms that do not admit to clear-cut, timeless definitions. A related Arabic term, al-sudan 'the blacks,' has similarly received a wide range of meanings (See Goldenberg, Curse Curse of Ham, 106-107). A precise geographic and ethnic determination of these English, Hebrew and Arabic terms is beyond the scope of this essay. Nevertheless, "by the medieval period," as Jonathan Schorsch has shown, "'Kushite' was being wielded as a synonym for 'black people'" (Jews and Blacks in in the Early Modern World [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004], 116). Note also that the term kushi in Samuel ibn Tibbon's (d. ca. 1230) Hebrew translation of Maimonides' Guide for the Per plexed,plexed, 3:51 translates an original Sudan, 'Blacks' in Maimonides' Judeo-Arabic text. In his Hebrew translation (Ramat Aviv: Tel Aviv University, 2002), Michael Schwartz has sudanim and notes "or blacks [shehorim]." The Latin translation of 1520 (110b) has Aethiopes. Shlomo Pines renders "Negroes" in his English translation. Maimonides' source for his statement in the Guide is the Arab philosopher Miskawayh (d. 1030), who uses the term zanj which Steven Harvey translates as "Negroes," as he does also for Maimonides' al-sudan. For sources, see David Goldenberg, "The Devel opment of the Idea of Race: Classical Paradigms and Medieval Elaborations" (Review Essay), Inter national national Journal of the Classical Tradition 5 (1999), n. 15 (also at http://www.sas.upenn.edu/ ~dmg2/), and see below, nn. 54 and 69. Given this interchange of terms, and with the qualification noted, in this essay I shall use the terms kushi and 'black African' or 'Black' as synonymous. 32</page><page sequence="5">"It Is Permitted to Marry a Kushite" {Divrei{Divrei ha-yamim shel Mosheh), and later in the medieval anthologies Sefer ha-Yashar,ha-Yashar, Sefer ha-Zikhronot, and Yalkut Shim'oni.13 That Moses abstained from sex with his wife is found in tannaitic sources.14 The Chronicles of Moses, however, adds the reason that it was prohibited to marry the descendants of Ham. But, as Danzig says, there is no such biblical or rabbinic prohibition. It seems, rather, that the statement in the Chronicles of Moses was manufactured to explain Moses' abstinence. In any case, there is no prohibition against marrying a Kushite or Zanj convert. So then, why the prohibition of marriage with the Zanj as recorded in the two geonic-era works? And why the similar implied prohibition about the Kush ites in Maimonides? Two explanations appear to work together and strengthen each other: the belief in the Canaanite ancestry of the Zanj/Kushites and the halakhic status of former slaves as non-Jewish. In addition, racial prejudice most probably had an impact as well. Zanj Descendants of Canaanites Some scholars thought that the explanation for the prohibition recorded in HalakhotHalakhot Pesukot and Halakhot Gedolot must have been a belief that the Zanj were descendants of the Canaanite peoples, with whom the Bible prohibited mar riage (Deuteronomy 7:1-3).15 Their reason was based on the fact that both Hala khotkhot Pesukot and Halakhot Gedolot group the Zanj with the Canaanite nations. Danzig, however, rejected this possibility remarking that it is difficult to accept the idea that the black African Zanj would have been considered descendants of Canaanite peoples. Instead, Danzig suggested that the solution lies in a misunder stood rabbinic tradition that one of the Canaanite nations emigrated to afrika (afriki) in the face of Joshua's conquest of Israel.16 It is clear that underlying 13.

This is confirmed by the extra-rabbinic parallels to the rabbinic tradition (Augustine, Procopius, Isidore, the Suda, etc.) and by the variant readings of the rabbinic account which names "Canaanites" in place of "Africans."17 Danzig suggests, however, that afrika might have been misunderstood as referring to sub-Saharan Africa. But, aside from the fact that in both rabbinic and Islamic literature 'afrika/'ifrikiya most com monly means north Africa, this suggestion runs into the problem that Danzig are here dependent on B. Sanhedrin according to Ido Hampel, Megillat Ta 'anit (Phd diss., Tel Aviv University, 1976), ad 10c. In the new critical edition by Vered Noam, Megillat Ta'anit (Jerusalem, 2003) the text is on p. 70. On the argument for the land, see also David Luria's commentary to PirkeiPirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer (Warsaw, 1852), 56a n. 4. In his edition of the Mekhilta, Jacob Lauterbach says that the original country of the Canaanites was Africa (1:158); however, there does not appear to be a rabbinic tradition regarding an origin for the Canaanites before they were in Israel. It would seem that Lauterbach came to his interpretation by reading, with MS Munich, be-'arzekha and be-be- 'arzekhem, i.e., God said to the Canaanites, "I will give you a good land in your own country." Since according to the midrash the Canaanites left Israel for Africa, "I will give you a good land in your own country" must mean that Africa had been their country. Lauterbach's decision to accept the reading in MS Munich may have been influenced by the postbiblical tradition in Jubilees 10:29 34, according to which Canaan was given Africa when the world was divided among Noah's descen dants. Whether Jubilees influenced Lauterbach or not, it did not influence the rabbinic text, for the Venice and Constantinople editions of Mekhilta read, as Lauterbach notes, ke- 'arzekha/khem "as your own country" i.e., God will give the Canaanites a land (Africa) as good as their own country (Canaan), which they had just left. Undoubtedly, the editions represent the correct reading (adopted also by Horovitz-Rabin in their edition of Mekhilta, although they show no variant reading, and M. Margulies in his edition of Vayikra Rabba, 386, s.v. me- 'arzo), since the midrash is based on an exeg esis of Isaiah 36:17 which has ke-'arzekhem (no variants shown in The Hebrew University Bible: Isaiah,Isaiah, ed. Moshe Goshen-Gottstein [Jerusalem: Magnes, 1981], 54). Confusion of bet and far/is, of course, common; cf. the parallel in Y. Shevi'it 6:1, 36c. 17.

Whether or not the rabbinic tradition of Canaanite emigration was misunder stood, there is good reason to think that the Zanj and Kushites were believed to be descended from the Canaanites. In Islamic sources Canaan is commonly named as the ancestor of various black African peoples. Wahb ibn Munabbih (d. 730) says that the black African Nubians, Zanj, and Zaghawa descend from Canaan, and that "the descendants of Kush and Canaan are the races of the Sudan: the Nuba, the Zanj, the Qazan, the Zaghawa, the Habasha, the Qibt and the Barbar." Ibn Abd al-Hakam (9th century) states that Canaan is the father of the Blacks (sudan)(sudan) and the Abyssinians. Ya'qubT (d. 897): "The posterity of Kush ben Ham and Canaan ben Ham are the Nuba, the Zanj, and the Habasha." MaqdisT (10th century) says that Canaan is the father of, among several African peoples, "the Sudan [and] the Nuba." The Akhbar al-zaman (10th or 11th century): "Among the children of Canaan are the Nablt, Nablt signifies 'black'.... Among the children of Sudan, son of Canaan, are ... the Zanj." The Book of the Zanj states that the Nuba, the Habash, and the Zanj are the descendants of Canaan.18 Other Muslim sources relate Canaan specifically to Kush either as father and son or son and father. So MaqrizT (d. 1442): "The Nubians are descended from Nuba son of Kush son of Canaan son of Ham." Tabari quotes Ibn Mas ud (10th 18.

Goldenberg century) and "some of the companions of the Prophef' to say that Canaan was the son of Kush. Tabari himself says several times that Kush was the son of Canaan as does Ibn Sad (d. 845) and QazwInT (d. 1283). MasudI (d. 956) refers to Kush as the son of Canaan, or as the great-grandfather of Canaan. Ka'b al-Ahbar (a Jewish convert to Islam, d. ca. 652) has Canaan as the son of Kush, as also DimashqT (d. 1327). Ibn Hawqal (10th century) makes Nimrod, the biblical son of Kush, a son of Canaan.19 The tradition, then, that black Africans were directly related to, and more specifically descendants of, Canaan was very well established in the Muslim world. It is not, therefore, surprising that Halakhot Pesukot and Halakhot Gedolot,Gedolot, authored within that world, reflect this view by listing the Zanj with the Canaanite peoples. Their grouping together of the Zanj with the Canaanites is not due merely to a taxonomic classification of prohibited marriages but reflects a perceived genealogical relationship. Maimonides did not group Kushites with Canaanites but his reason for permitting marriage with the Kushites—because "Sennacherib had commingled all peoples"—implies a belief that the Kushites descended from peoples who were biblically prohibited. Since there was such a belief in the surrounding Muslim world, i.e. that the Kushites descended from the prohibited Canaanites, Maimonides' reference to the Kushites apparently reflects, and counters, that belief. But, as opposed to the Halakhot, by grouping the Kushites with other peoples (Edomites, Egyptians, Ammonites, and Moabites) Maimonides did not mean to imply a genealogical relationship with them any more than he wished to imply a genealogical relationship between them and "any other nation," who are also grouped with these four peoples. The placement of the law regarding the Kushites within the organization of chapter 12 of Mishneh Torah, 'Issure bi'ah is based on other than genealogical principles. 19.

In one other location we again find the association of dark-skinned people with Canaan, but these dark-skinned people are Indians and the location is India. Mosseh Pereyra de Paiva of the Amsterdam Jewish community visited the Jews in Cochin in 1686. In his report he noted that the "white Jews" considered it disgraceful to marry the "black Jews," and he commented, "They cite as a reason that they are slaves of slaves, and that they are mixed with Canaanites, converts, and Muslims." A similar usage of "Canaanites" to describe the Cochinis occurs in the writings of the Yemenite poet Zacharia b. Saadia b. Jacob al-Dahri (16th century). He also visited Cochin and wrote in verse about those in the Jewish com munity who "are converts/ converted long ago/ from the kushim and Canaanites/ who know Jewish law and religion/ and acknowledge the laws of the Torah."20 It is possible that here too we are looking at Islamic influence, for Islam reached India, especially the Malabar coast, many centuries before the 16th century.21 While the Muslim traditions, however, generally speak of various black African peoples, Syriac Christian sources mention the Indians as descen dants of Canaan, and the Syriac Christian church had been in Malabar from the 4th century onward.22 Thus the Syriac Cave of Treasures makes Canaan the ances tor of the dark-skinned peoples, that is, "the Egyptians, the Kushites, the Indians, and the Musdaye." This is in agreement with the tradition, found in several Syriac Christian works, that when Canaan was cursed with slavery (Genesis 9:25) he became black, and this color, together with the curse of slavery, was transmitted to his descendants, thus giving a Canaanite ancestry to all dark-skinned peoples. 20. Mosseh Pereyra de Paiva, Notisias dos Judeos de Cochim (Amsterdam, 1687; reprint Lisbon: [Oficinas graficas do Museu comercial], 1923), 7, is quoted in Jonathan Schorsch, Jews and Blacks,Blacks, 210. Note the evocation of Genesis 9:25 in "slaves of slaves." Al-Dahri is in Naftali Bar-Giora, "Source Material for the History of the Relations between the White Jews and the Black Jews of Cochin," Sefunot 1 (1956): 246. Yehudah Ratzaby, who published al-Dahri's work, remarked that kushimkushim here "almost certainly" means Cochinis (Sefer ha-musar, ed. Y. Ratzaby [Jerusalem: Mekhon Ben-Zevi, 1965], 130), and in this he was followed by Segal, A History of the Jews of Cochin Cochin (London: Vallentine Mitchell, 1993), 23. Support for the possibility of this meaning comes from Benjamin of Tudela's reference to "Kushites" (bnei kush) who live in Khulam (Quilon) on the Malabar coast of India to the south of Cochin. Here too kush should probably be translated "Cochin." See The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela (New York: Feldheim, 1964), ed. Marcus Nathan Adler, English section, 63-64, Hebrew section, 58, and Goldenberg, Curse of Ham, 209.

Goldenberg Ishodad of Merv, the 9th century bishop of Hedhatha, records the tradition, although he himself does not accept it, that when Noah cursed Canaan, "instantly, by the force of the curse.. .his face and entire body became black (ukmotha). This is the black color which has persisted in his descendants." Similarly recording but rejecting the tradition is the 13th-century Christian Ibn al-'Ibri (Bar Hebraeus): "Canaan was accursed ... and with the very curse he became black ('wkm) and the blackness ('wkmwt') was transmitted to his descendants...." Ibn al-Taiyib (Baghdad, d. 1043), a Nestorian Christian, put it this way: "The curse of Noah affected the posterity of Canaan who were killed by Joshua son of Nun. At the moment of the curse, Canaan's body became black and the blackness spread out among them." So also some later versions (Arabic, Ethiopic) of the Cave ofTreas uresures make Canaan the ancestor of "other blacks (sudan),,י or "all those whose skin color is black." The blackness of Canaan is also attributed to the Syriac father Ephrem, and although the attribution is most likely spurious, it reflects the views of its time (the MS dates probably from the 13th century).23 In short, the notion that Canaan became black and that this color was transmitted to his descen dants, who are all dark-skinned people, was common in the East, whether in the Christian or Muslim world, for well over a millennium beginning with the Cave of of Treasures. This tradition did not leave the Jewish world unaffected, as may be seen in the texts discussed above, and in a few others.24 The belief among Jews in the Canaanite ancestry of dark-skinned slaves, whether Zanj, Indians or, as will be seen below, Kushites, may have been strength ened by another factor: the expression 'eved kna'ani 'Canaanite slave,' the term used from the tannaitic period onward for a non-Jewish slave, irrespective of origin.25 In the course of time, the term may have been understood literally to 23. See Goldenberg, Curse of Ham, 99-100, 171-173, for these sources. The Cave of Treasures has been thought to go back probably to the 4th, and perhaps the 3rd, century but a recent study argues for a 5th- or even 6th-century date of composition; see Clemens Leonhard, "Observations on the Date of the Syriac Cave of Treasures," in The World of the Aramaeans, ed. P.M. Michele Daviau et al. (Shef field: Sheffield Academic Press, 2001), 1:255-93, and most recently Alexander Toepel, Die A dam- und Seth-legendenSeth-legenden im syrischen Buch der Schatzhohle, CSCO 618, subsidia 119 (Louvain: Peeters, 2006), chap. 1 'Einleitung', who argues for a late 6th- or early 7th-century date. 24. Moses Arragel's 15th-century Castilian commentary to the Bible (on Genesis 9:25): "And Canaan was a slave from slaves: Some say that these are the black Moors who, wherever they go, are captives." The Jewish-Yemini scholars Nathaniel ibn Yeshaya and Zachariah b. Solomon ha-Rofe (14th and 15th centuries) also say in their commentaries to the verse that Canaan turned black. The quotation in the 16th-century Sefer re'ishit hokhma of Elijah de Vidas, which has Canaan cursed with blackness (sec. Ahava 6:8, ed. H. Y. Waldman, Re'ishit hokhma ha-shalem [Jerusalem: Or ha-musar, 1984], 1:456) would appear to be an error, probably influenced by the Muslim traditions (Elijah lived in Safed). In Sefer ha-zikhronot (120) = Chronicles of Jerahmeel (27:4, 58), "Kushim" are listed as des cendants of Canaan but this text derives from Pseudo-Philo, Biblical Antiquities 4:6, that has rather "Kusin," which is clearly not an error for "Kushim." In this essay I am dealing with sources that expli citly refer to Canaan as Black, although authors who mention the blackening of Ham, whether Muslim, Christian or Jewish, may implicitly include Ham's son Canaan. For the sources mentioned in this note, see Goldenberg, Curse of Ham, 291 n. 63, 355 n. 47, 356 n. 50. 25. E.g. M. Kiddushin 1.3 and several times in midrash halakhah.

In at least one case we find such ancestry ascribed to non-Jewish slaves who are not black, and where therefore the Muslim and Chris tian traditions of black Canaanites are unlikely to have been the cause. R. Amram Gaon (d. 875) explained why the non-black Cordyenians and Tadmorites (i.e. Pal myrenes) may not be accepted as converts, as stated in the Talmud. The Gaon con sidered them as descendants of the Canaanite nations, although the Talmud says nothing of the sort and only claims that they were descendants of mixed (Jewish: pagan) marriages. Although from a much later period, the 13th/14th-century Arabic al-Raud al-mi'tar claims that Palmyra contained "a rabble of Jews and runaway runaway slavesIn other words, the non-Jewish slave, termed 'eved kna 'ani, may have eventually been considered to be descended from the Canaanites, irre spective of any genealogical relationship.26 In any case, it is likely that the expression reinforced the belief in the Canaanite ancestry of dark-skinned slaves. Halakhic Status of Former Slaves In addition to a belief in Canaanite ancestry of black Africans, there may well have been another reason why marriage with Zanj and Kushites were prohib ited by some. Parallel situations at other times and places in Jewish history will shed light on this issue. In a letter to Rabbi David ibn Abi Zimra of Cairo written about 1520, the meyuhasin (i.e. those of attested Jewish pedigree), or "white Jews," of Cochin explained that there were those in their community (the "black Jews") whose ancestors were non-Jewish Indian slaves in Jewish households who had never been manumitted. Thus their status as Jews was ques tionable although they, and their descendants, continued to live as Jews in the Jewish community. For this reason the meyuhasin do not intermarry with them.27 As the Jewish communal records put it: "They [the black Jews] consist of a mix of those who are converts by reason of their manumission together 26. The talmudic source for the Cordyenians and Tadmorites is at B. Yevamot 16a-b (printed editions have Tarmodites but the manuscripts read Tadmorites), Y. Yevamot 3b; Amram's responsum is in Benjamin M. Lewin, Ozar ha-ge'onim, (Haifa: [s.n.], 1928-43), 7:113, ad 10c. = Teshuvot ha-ge'onim:ha-ge'onim: sha'are zedek, ed. Nissim Moda'i, Thessaloniki, 1792), 24b, 3.6.10, and She'elot u teshuvot teshuvot ha-Ram mi-Trani (Venice, 1629), 5b, # 19; the responsum can be dated to ca. 720 (I owe this reference to Mordechai Friedman). Discussion of the prohibition regarding the Cordyenians and Tadmorites can be found in B. J. Bamberger, Proselytism in the Talmudic Period, 2nd ed (New York: Ktav, 1968), 34-36 and Biichler, "Familienreinheit und Familienmakel in Jerusalem vor dem Jahre 70," in Festschrift Adolf Schwarz, ed. Samuel Krauss (Berlin: R. Lowit, 1917), 150-153. Of course, it is possible that R. Amram Gaon had a tradition independent of the Talmud that the Cor dyenians and Tadmorites were descendants of the seven Canaanite nations.

Goldenberg with those who have not been manumitted, and therefore we do not allow our women to marry them, although their customs and laws are like ours."28 This situ ation existed in Cochin well into the 19th century.29 The halakhic concerns of the Cochin meyuhasin derived from rabbinic law concerning the status of non-Jewish slaves. When a slave was first acquired, a ritual immersion was performed and, in the case of men, circumcision too. This gave the slave a sort of semi-Jewish status. If the slave was later manumitted, a second immersion was performed whereby the former slave became a full-fledged Jew. At that point his religio-legal status was similar to that of a proselyte. During the period between the two immersions, marriage with the slave was forbidden to the Jew; once manumitted into the full status of Jew, marriage was permitted.30 Asaf notes the many references in responsa literature indicating that slaves were manumitted by their Jewish owners for purposes of full conversion. Once con verted, these former slaves then joined, and married within, the Jewish community as full-fledged members.31 Manumission was not infrequently performed so that a master could marry his former slave.32 When a slave was freed, a manumission 28. Quoted in Naftali Bar-Giora, "Source Material,,251 י. The same reason is given in a letter from the leaders of the white community in 1844 (599) and in the report written by Even-Sappir when he visited the community in 1860 (260). Ibn Zimra's response, incidentally, was that the "black Jews'1 are to be considered as Jews and "it is forbidden to call them slaves."

But we do not take their daughters and do not give [ours] to them" (53). 30. See Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, 'Issure bi'ali 12:11,17; 13:11—12; 14:18 (ed.

Evidence of manumission could not be based on the slave's own declaration.34 Thus the concern in Cochin with those whose ancestors had been non-Jewish Indian slaves in Jewish homes. Without documentary proof, there was no indication that manumission had occurred and that they and their descendants were Jews. This was a problem that surfaced now and then in different Jewish communities at different times.35 This explanation may also elucidate the situation in the Amsterdam (Spanish-Portuguese) Jewish community of the 17th century in regard to the black and mulatto Jews (negros e mulatos judeos). They were buried in a separate section of the Jewish cemetery and they were not called to the Torah in the syna gogue service; their women could sit in the women's gallery in the synagogue only in the back rows. "For the most part, these blacks and mulattos were slaves and servants who had converted to Judaism and lived on the margins of the Jewish community."36 33.

The practice 41</page><page sequence="14">David David M. Goldenberg It is reasonable to assume that the same situation with the same concerns obtained among Babylonian Jewry during the geonic period. We know that although the Zanj were brought to Iraq to work the salt flats, some were slaves or servants in homes and businesses, including Jewish homes and businesses. We know this in the Jewish case from the formula used in a document for the sale of a slave, dating from the end of the geonic period (circa 1000 C.E.), which mentions the Zanj as a typical slave.37 Probably the same halakhic concerns with Jewish status operated in geonic Babylonia as in Cochin and Amsterdam of later times. Due to the role played by the Zanj in history, there must have been even more reason in Babylonia (Iraq) for apprehension regarding the halakhic status of the Blacks than was the case in Cochin or Amsterdam. The thousands of Zanj slaves who lived in extreme misery in work gangs are well known from Arabic sources because of a series of successive rebellions they waged, first in 689,689, then in 694-695, and the third and most important, which lasted for fifteen years between 868-883 and posed a serious threat to the Baghdad caliphate. These revolts, especially the last, were very bloody and destructive.38 In 871, at the height of their power, the Zanj were said to have killed at least 300,000 people at Basra.39 There was also an insurrection of Zanj in Mosul (northern Iraq) in 749, in which over 10,000 Zanj men, women, and children were mas sacred.40 "The economic, political and social consequences of this long revolt," according to Y. Talib, "profoundly affected the whole Islamic world" with one of the consequences being an aversion to Africa and Africans and a "widespread diffusion of the unfavorable image of the black in Islamic countries."41 was carried over to the New World, where Blacks were segregated in some American (white) Protestant cemeteries from colonial times until the Civil War; see David Reimers, White Protestantism and the Negro Negro (New York: Oxford University Press, 1965), 16. 37.

It surely cannot be a coincidence that the time and place of the Zanj rebellions coincide with those of HalakhotHalakhot Pesukot and Halakhot Gedolot. The parallels are especially close between the last revolt and Halakhot Gedolot. The home of the author of this work was Basra, the city that was so devastated by the fighting, and the time of composition of the work was at the time of (or not long after) this last and most serious rebellion.42 The Arabic sources report that after conquering a city the rebels would often free the local slaves.43 Additionally, slaves in other towns and villages would desert their masters and join the Zanj rebels.44 According to Wansbrough, the first efforts at recruiting for the revolt were among slaves belong ing to various peoples in the area. Indeed, the sources mention enormous quan tities of fugitive slaves at the end of the 8th and the beginning of the 10th centuries.45 After the rebellion "the Muslim empire was flooded with slaves as a result of this upheaval."46 The Abbasid policy was to give amnesty to the former rebels, and proclamations were issued that all who fled their homes should return 47 Many of the slaves who had fled their masters did return.48 Others, who were far removed from their former homes or who wished not to return to their former masters, probably used the opportunity to free themselves from a life of bondage. The situation must have been chaotic, with large numbers trying to find a new life for themselves. Some slaves who came from Jewish homes, and had acquired a knowledge of Jewish life and customs, would have tried to return to that world, just as those from Muslim homes would have gravi tated to the Muslim world. They would have presented themselves as having a familiarity with Jewish law and custom. The same problem arose periodically in 42.42. See n. 7 above. 43. Popovic, The Revolt, 58; Ashtor, A Social and Economic History, 119. Not that the Zanj didn't practice slavery themselves, for after conquering a city they would take spoils including women and children (Popovic, The Revolt, 58, 94, 95, 97, 115, 119), and they also took free Arab women and auctioned them off among themselves as slaves and concubines (Talhami, "The Zanj Rebel Hon," 456; Popovic, The Revolt, 131). 44.

Asaf notes that there were times when a slave would flee from his master to another city, declare himself Jewish and try to assimilate into the Jewish community.49 Just as in these cases, so too regarding the Zanj the ques tion arose whether the former slaves had been manumitted and were therefore, according to Jewish law, considered Jews and permitted to marry within the com munity. Or had they not been manumitted, and were they therefore not considered Jews who could marry into the community? A document of manumission could easily have been lost, or claimed to have been lost, during the turmoil of the revolt. The same problems arose in a much earlier period. According to Ephraim Urbach, the innovation by the Rabbis at the end of the second and the beginning of the third centuries to require a document of manumission is likewise explained by a similar social situation following the Bar Kokhba rebellion. The Rabbis' main concern "was to safeguard meticulously the legal and religious status of members of their own community." Their opposition to manumission of slaves was essentially directed at mock-manumission and the blurring of the boundary between the status of true slave and manumitted slave. Only the slave who had been manumitted by means of a document was reckoned as a full Jew, fit to marry a free Jewish woman."50 Similar concerns were voiced again in the amoraic period when fugitive slaves who did not have certificates of manumission, were assimilated into the Jewish community because of their familiarity with Jewish law and custom.51 In this case too we can see the same factors operating as with the Zanj of Iraq: the ease with which a slave who had been in a Jewish home, because of his or her familiarity with Jewish law and custom, could assimilate into the Jewish community; and the concerns over such a possibility due to the possible non-Jewish status of the slave. Such concerns expressed by some Jewish authorities in 8th- and 9th-century Iraq are evidenced in Halakhot Pesukot and Halakhot Gedolot. Although the authors of these works disagreed and ruled that the Zanj could "enter the commu nity," the rejected position would have argued that Zanj conversion was unaccep table, for according to Jewish law a slave must be manumitted to be converted to Judaism, and without proof of manumission conversion was impossible. Thus, the possibility of former slave status resulted in a consequent question of Jewishness. As for Maimonides, although the Zanj slaves of Iraq did not inhabit his world, black slaves did. The association of black with slave is seen throughout the Islamic world across time and geography. From the beginnings of Islam in the seventh century up until the early twentieth century, the vast majority of Blacks in the Muslim Middle East were slaves, or had their origins in slavery. This was so to the extent that Blacks eventually came to be equated with slaves. "A black skin in almost all the Islamic societies, including parts of the Sudan, was and still is associated with slavery."52 The following few examples 49. Asaf, '"Avadim u-shar 'avadim," 244. 50.

The historian Mas udT (d. 957) reported that the Abbasid Caliph al-Radl (d. 940) would accept nothing from the hand of a black man [aswad] because he considered him an "ugly slave."53 The Muslim philosopher Ibn Slna ("Avicenna," d. 1037) speaks of "people not very capable of acquiring virtue. For these are slaves by nature as, for example, the Turks and the Zinjis [i.e., black Africans]."54 The historian Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406) goes further and limits the idea of a natural slave to the Black alone: The only people who accept slavery are the Negroes (Sudan), owing to their low degree of humanity and their proximity to the animal stage. Other persons who accept the status of slave do so as a means of attaining high rank or power, as is the case with the Mameluke [mamluk] Turks in the East and with those Franks and Galicians who enter the service of the state [in Spain].55 The identification of black with slave is evident in Islamic literature and art, where "the Black" is usually portrayed as slave, servant, or attendant.56 As literature and art, so too language follows and reflects social structures, and the gradual black ening of the slave class in the Islamic world is reflected in the vocabulary. In time the Arabic word for slave, abd (Hebrew 'eved) came to mean only a black slave and, in many dialects by the 11-13th centuries it was used to designate any Black, slave or not, a meaning it retains today in colloquial Arabic.57 There are other similar linguistic examples associating black with slave: in North Africa 53.

Goldenberg khadim,khadim, lit. 'servant', has come to mean "negress";58 in the Kumzari dialect of the Shihuh tribe of Arabia, zangair (i.e. Zanj) means slave;59 in his work, The Arabs and and the Sudan, Y. F. Hasan writes that "the term al-Niiba [the Nubians] became almost synonymous with 'black slaves5."60 We can see the connection between Blacks and slaves in Maimonides' own writing: The Sages commanded that one should employ the poor and the orphaned rather than use slaves in one's home. It is better to employ the former and thus benefit the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, rather than benefit the descendants of Ham (zera ham).61 Descendants of Ham, i.e.. Blacks, are here equated with slave. As with the case in geonic Iraq and elsewhere, it is likely that there were some in the Jewish commu nity of Egypt not willing to accept Blacks as marriageable because of an assump tion that the Black was a slave or descendant of a slave who had not been manumitted, a position implicitly refuted by Maimonides. Racial Prejudice Segal notes that although the distinction between the white Jews and black Jews in Cochin was concerned with Jewish status, the attitudes may have been reinforced by the color divide common in general Indian society.62 Similarly, in Amsterdam, racist sentiment, by now well-ensconced in Western Europe, undoubtedly played a role in the Blacks' exclusion from the community. Presum ably a similar mix of Jewish law and racial prejudice operated as well in 18th-century Surinam, where the descendants of Jewish planters and Black slaves were not fully accepted within the Jewish community.63 We may presume that in Jewish Iraq during the period of the Geonim anti Black sentiment similarly existed, for such sentiments were common in the sur rounding Muslim society of the time.64 58.

Bernard Lewis records several traditions reflecting this view, including those attributed to the prophet of Islam, such as "Beware of marry ing the ZanjT" and "Do not bring black into your pedigree." While these hadiths are spuriously attributed to Muhammad, they do reflect the attitudes of the time they were written, as does Masudl's (10th century) stricture "Do not intermarry with the sons of Ham."65 Particularly relevant, because of the time and place of its author, is Jahiz of Basra's (d. 868/9) argument against the prevailing custom of not marrying Black women.66 No doubt, racist sentiment existed among the Jews just as among the Muslims. It is true that there are a number of references, some certain and some speculative, to the acceptance of black African converts to Judaism (not necessarily from slave manumissions) before, during, and after this period.67 These instances do not, however, allow us to assume that anti-Black stinking, and crinkly-haired, with uneven limbs, deficient minds, and depraved passions, such as the Zanj, the Ethiopians, and other blacks who resemble them," to which Lewis remarks, "Such ideas appear to have been current at the time" (46).

Rosenthal reconstructs "Benjamin Zangai" from "Benjamin gnzkyyh" by metathesis. Another mention of Zanj in rabbinic texts is found in a variant reading to B. Kiddishin 70b; see B. M.

Goldenberg sentiment did not exist, just as the many cases of black African conversion to Islam do not belie the anti-Black attitudes found in the Muslim world.68 The anti-Black sentiment as exhibited in the surrounding Muslim society is reflected elsewhere in Maimonides' works. In his Guide for the Perplexed 3:51, Maimonides writes that those who live at the extreme ends of the world, the Turks in the north and the Blacks (al-sudan) in the south, are "irrational beings, not human beings, below humanity but above the ape." As Steven Harvey has shown, Maimonides5 source for his statement was the Arab philosopher und Targum," Monatsschrift fur Geschichte und Wissenschafi des Judentums 3 (1895): 57 emended dng'ydng'y in the Targum to 1 Chron. 1:9 to zng'y, i.e. Zanj, but could dng'y be Dinka? [3] The Jewish litur gical poet Yannai mentions converts from among the descendants of Ham, which may refer to black Africans. The pivyut is in Zvi M. Rabinowitz, Mahzor piyyutei Rabi Yannai (Jerusalem: Bialik, 1985), 1:105-106, which see for further literature, and see now Laura Lieber, Yannai on Genesis: An An Invitation to Piyyut (Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College Press, 2010), 362-363, 367. Menahem Zulay, "Mehkere Yannai," Yedi'ot ha-Makhon le-heker ha-shirah ha-'ivrit (Berlin, 1936), 2:268 269, thinks that the reference is to contemporary converts who may have been Egyptians, and Saul Lie berman cites the case of the known conversion of a monk from Mt. Sinai, who, he thinks, might have been Egyptian: Saul Lieberman, "Hazanut Yannai/' Sinai 2 (1939): 244, reproduced in S. Lieberman, MehkarimMehkarim be-torat Erez Yisrael, ed.

It is not impossible, nevertheless, that descendants of Ham may have included black Africans. Yannai's provenance is the Land of Israel; his dates are uncertain, some putting him in the 4-5th centuries, others in the 6—7th centuries. [4] A 12th-century will from Cairo records the manumission of two slave-girls, one of whom was apparently a black African. In the will, the owner stipulated that upon her death the slaves were to be manumitted, given ownership to a quarter of the house (i.e. their income would be provided from such ownership), and allowed to live in the half of the house that their mistress had owned on condition that they remain Jewish: Moshe Gil, Be-malkhut yishmayishma 'el, 1:607, sec. 339. [5] A 16th-century genizah document mentions a "Rabbi Isaac the Ethiopian (al-habashi)"(al-habashi)" who was the beadle (shamash) in a synagogue: MS Jewish Theological Seminary, ENA ns 54.17. (I am indebted to Sol Cohen for bringing this document to my attention.) Part of the date is missing, but based on what remains, as well as the paleography, Moshe Gil (oral communication) dates it to 1544. [6] The Qadi's court archives of Ottoman Jerusalem dated 1559 record a Jew married to a Black woman (al-habashiya), for which see Amnon Cohen, A World Within: Jewish Life as Reflected in Muslim Muslim Court Documents from the Sijill ofJerusalem (XVIth Century) (Philadelphia: Center for Judaic Studies, University of Pennsylvania, 1994), 1:119, 2:211. [7] Blacks and mulattos born of a couple married according to Jewish law were not excluded from the Jewish cemetery or from community fiinc tions in Amsterdam (Kaplan, "Political Concepts in the World of the Portuguese Jews of Amsterdam," 59), and three graves of Blacks were found in the Jewish cemetery at Montjuich (Barcelona) dated between 1091-1391, when the cemetery was used (Antoniao Prevosti, "Estudio tipologico de 10s restos humanos hallados en la necropolis judaica de Montjuich (Barcelon)," Sefarad 11 [1951] 82). [8] Lastly, note that David Kimhi (d. 1235) had no problem assuming that the "Kushite" in David's army (2 Samuel 18:21) might have been a Nubian convert to Judaism, for which see his Commentary to 2 Samuel 18:21. 68. See Lewis, Race and Slavery in the Middle East. To acknowledge the existence of racist sentiment is not to deny the halakhic basis of the concerns regarding former slaves. To say, therefore, that "it must have been pure racial prejudice which connected Negro slaves with the Canaanite tribes" (Wacholder, Historia Judaica 18 [1956]: 102): is a gross simplification that overlooks the evidence pre sented in this essay. 48</page><page sequence="21">"It Is Permitted to Marry a Kushite" Miskawayh (d. 1030), who wrote of those "who dwell in the farthest parts of the inhabited world both to the north and to the south such as the remotest Turks in the county of Gog and Magog and the remotest Negroes [zanj] and similar nations which are distinguished from apes to a slight degree only."69 To return then to the question posed at the beginning of this article, the rejected prohibition of marriage with the black African Zanj, as reflected in Hala khotkhot Gedolot and Halakhot Pesukot and the similar rejected prohibition of mar riage with Kushites in Mishneh Torah, may be the result of both the belief that black Africans descended from the Canaanites, and the suspicion that the Black may be, or may be descended from, an unemancipated slave. In addition, anti Black sentiment as exhibited in the surrounding Muslim society (and reflected elsewhere in Maimonides' works) no doubt acted as a leavening agent. These three factors worked together and strengthened each other. David M. Goldenberg University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 69. Miskawayh, Tahdhlb al-Akhlaq, ed. C. K.
