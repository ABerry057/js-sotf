<plain_text><page sequence="1">Avraham Barkai. Branching Out: German-Jewish Immigration to the United States, 1820-1914. New York: Homes &amp; Meier, 1994. xiii, 269 pp. Published in Holmes &amp; Meier's "Ellis Island Series" edited by Ira Glazier and Luigi de Rosa, and intended "for the general reader" (p. xii), Branching Out is an important work of synthesis and of innovation, in which the needs and opportunities of the field are outlined in new ways, and not a few of them fulfilled. Avraham Barkai, a research fellow at the Institute for German History at Tel Aviv University, brings to this study special qualifications: familiarity with the German context of German-Jewish history; more important, the status of outsider to our American discourse on immigration, race, and ethnicity, and to the traditional "issues" of American Jewish history. He is thus able to notice what Americanists-and very largely Americans-have not. Barkai notices that German-Jewish immigration to the United States may be understood not only in terms of generalized concepts of "push" and "pull" but also as the story of real people making real decisions based on their actual condition in particular places at particular times. In fact, conditions varied widely. What all Jews in the German-speaking world did share, however, was their civil status as Jews rather than citizens. Thus emigration must be seen as continuous with other responses to the Jews' civil status, emancipation, modernization, assimilation; and it should not surprise us that the immigrants continued to be interested in these matters in the New World. Barkai also notices that German-Jewish immigration to the United States can be understood not only as a "stage" or "epoch" in the history of Jews in the United States, but also as a phenomenon of German history. One of its results, for example, was to reduce dramatically the Jewish populations in the German states, leaving numerous towns without any Jews at all, which may have suggested to those captivated by the idea of progress (I am wondering about this, Barkai doesn't) that Germany's nineteenth-century Jewish problem, like America's contemporary Negro problem, would be</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 203 solved "naturally" by the processes of demographic change. Emigration, in any case, by reducing the viability of the traditional Jewish communities, thereby also eased the emigrants' shift in focus, from the old beloved homeland to the new one. Jewish emigration occurred as part of the more general Auswanderung of German-speaking peoples throughout the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twenti- eth centuries. Thus Barkai is not surprised-although he is careful to warn those of us who may be-that some of the "Sephardic grandees" of America during the colonial and early national periods were in fact Bavarians, and that German Jews, like other Germans, continued coming to America in great numbers well into the twentieth century. Oh-oh! What happens then to the "German period" in American Jewish history? Barkai recognizes that a large body of American scholarship takes mid-twentieth-century complaints about German-Jewish dominance (or loss of dominance) as true statements about nineteenth-century reality, and there- fore as the problematic for research (especially in the mode of communal history, e.g., "How the German Jews of XYZ city maintained, etc.," or "How the Russian Jews of XYZ city overcame, etc."). But he doesn't get what it's about. That lets us wonder, too. And what of the German origins of Reform? Because there was no Germany until 1870, what the German Jews shared was not a common nationality or a common culture but only a common language-and maybe not even that, given the reality of dialectical variation in the age before the common school. In America, it is true, they usually couldn't speak English very well, but that's not reason enough to make them a Volk or to assume that they shared a Geist, either in the Old World or the New. Yet this is precisely where we have been taught to look for the origins of Reform Judaism, in the quintessentially progressive Geist of that quintessentially modern Volk, the nineteenth-century Germans (of whom the Jews in this view, and paradoxically, were fully a part). Barkai himself hedges, not wishing, we may suspect, to take on all the issues, ideological as well as historical, that rapidly rise to view (but also, as an "outsider," in an effort to defer to the locals, whose kind assistance he sincerely appreciates and whose ownership of the problems he respectfully acknowledges). Nonetheless, he is careful to remind us that Reform Judaism, even-what am I saying!--especially at the time of its creation, was merely one among many competing ritual modes and religious philosophies; and that what is most interesting about it is not its "Germanness" but the ways in</page><page sequence="3">204 BOOK REVIEWS which it functioned to facilitate the accommodation of Europeans and Jews to the culture and society of America.
