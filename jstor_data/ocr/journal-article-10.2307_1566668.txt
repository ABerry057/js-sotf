Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1998. 388 pp. Issachar Ben-Ami's latest book on saint veneration in Morocco is the most comprehensive work published hitherto on Maghribi Jewish folklore. Based largely on field research conducted over the past decade and on reliable secondary sources, it includes an exhaustive list of 656 saints, twenty-five of them women. Part I of the</page><page sequence="2">134 BOOK REVIEWS work (pp. 13-196) is an analysis and description of saints in the context of Jewish life, including photos of saints' sanctuaries and their geographical locations. Part II (pp. 201-321) subsumes extensive data on biographical background, tales and legends on the saints, as well as the hillulot (sing. hillulah): festivals celebrating the anniversary of a saint's death. Pages 322-88 present information and dates of hillulot, a list of saints according to their burial places, a glossary, a detailed bibliography, and the index. Veneration of saints is a universal phenomenon in both monotheistic and polytheistic creeds. This was certainly true of Jews and Muslims in Morocco as part of their identity, and it continued subsequent to the Moroccan-Jewish emigration to Israel, France, and the Americas. Three different groups of saints, known as saddiqim, permeate Ben-Ami's study: local saints, known to and venerated by the residents of a specific village; regional saints, worshipped by populations of villages or a whole city; and national saints, cherished by wide segments of Jews, who flocked to their sanctuaries for a ziyara ("pilgrimage") during hillulot. The third group often included rabbis from Palestine who died during their sojourn in Morocco. From the onset, Ben-Ami clarifies that his findings do not amount to a historical study, nor does he grapple with the saints' histories or presume to treat sociological, socio-psychological, or scientific religious fields. Rather, his work is folkloric and descriptive, an attempt to highlight the central manifestations of saint worship as they exist today among Moroccan Jews. What emerges is a study of interesting legendary tales at hillulot extolling the glory of sainthood through miracles and dreams, and of practices and ceremonies that take place. Moreover, the study reflects the economic situation, and the organizations and institutions responsible for maintaining the saints' sanctuaries and burial sites. The majority of Jewish saints discussed by Ben-Ami were recognized as such only following their death. Few achieved saint distinction in their lifetime. Perhaps the most notable characteristic of saints was the exercise of supernatural powers by performing miracles, healing the sick (especially the epileptio), bestowing happiness on depressed and desperate persons, and curing mental illness, infertility, and miscarriage. Jews believed that while alive, as after death, saints maintained full control over the forces of nature. Consequently, revered saints appeared in the dreams of Jews (in Morocco, Israel, and elsewhere), and their sanctuaries were visited at hillulot.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 135 Manifesting such influence over Moroccan Jews, the saints were perceived as intermediaries between a petitioner and God. As Ben-Ami remarks, although the request is addressed to the saint, it is clear to everyone that the saint does no more than ask of God. In response, God gives what is asked for because He cannot refuse a saint. And the powerful saints had familial ties. The book lists several brothers, fathers and sons, grandfathers and grandsons, even married couples, all of whom enjoy saintly status. Several families in Morocco, as in Israel and parts of the European/American diaspora, boast several generations of saints and their descendants, most prominently the Abihatsiras, Pintos, and Ben-Barukhs. In reality, the protection afforded to Morocco's Jews in the precolonial era resulted from demarches before the makhzan (Sharifian government) by European consuls, influential European Jews, and international Jewish organizations like the Alliance Isra6lite Universelle, which in the early 1860s began operating a network of modem French-type schools in the Moroccan-Jewish communities. The inauguration of the colonial era under French and Spanish protection (1912) further bolstered the individual and communal security of the Jews. After all, Morocco was a country affected by tribal tensions and Arabo-Berber religio-ethnic strife.1 Jewish legends, however, ascribe to living saints the role of arbitrators in Muslim-Jewish disputes. According to this tradition, both parties accepted the revered arbitrator's decisions, either fearing his curse or out of respect for his powers. These saints are described as the protectors of the separate Jewish residential quarters (mellahs). Some saints, according to Ben-Ami, inscribed effective charms, while others turned hostile Muslims into dwarfs. Ben-Ami's assessment of the complex Judeo-Muslim interrelationship in precolonial and colonial Morocco within the framework of saint veneration is doubtless the most significant aspect of his study. It is noteworthy that in addition to their separate saints, Jews and Muslims revered as many as 126 saints in common. Comparative Muslim-Jewish saint worship is analyzed here as in no other study published heretofore. Whereas Muslim saints were venerated during their lifetimes, some of them endowed with the baraka, or divine gift, as descendants of the 1. On this point see: Michael M.

Second, the physical surroundings of Jewish and Muslim sanctuaries were quite different, with the graves of Jewish saints being modest, whereas the Muslim saints' tombs are elaborately adorned and built in the style of a qubba-a square white plastered structure with a domed roof. While the mussem, the Muslim equivalent of the hillulah, is held twice a year for several days, the Jewish celebration takes place once a year. During their ziyara, Muslims light colorful candles at the saint's sanctuary; the Jews use white ones. Both Jews at the hillulah and Muslims at the mussem engage in shehitah, the ritual slaughtering of animals (chickens, lambs, goats, cows, bulls), signifying the expression of solidarity between the venerators and their saints. Furthermore, both groups hold a communal meal in their sanctuaries, the dishes usually including meat and couscous. For Muslims the mussem is an occasion for prayer, singing, dancing, and deviation from otherwise forbidden behavior. Thus, for example, Muslim women do not refuse a man and are expected to confer their favors on anyone who asks. Muslims also organize "fantasias," performances of wild shooting as well as roughshod horse riding, while the crowd spurs the performers on. The sexual dimension and the physical show are conspicuously absent in hillulot. Despite modernization trends among Moroccan Jews due to French colonial and cultural influences, the cult of saint worship survived. Modern transportation and communications facilitated the increased participation at hillulot.1 Ben-Ami is cognizant of the anger of certain rabbis who loathed this practice coming at the expense of their reputations. He is correct in concluding that they were rendered powerless in the opposition against it. Regrettably, he does not delve deeply into this important component of Jewish communal life. Notwithstanding, Ben-Ami's book is highly recommended for students of Middle Eastern and North African folklore, and may be regarded as satisfying the highest scholarly standard. Few will 1.
