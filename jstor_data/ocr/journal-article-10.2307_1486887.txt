<plain_text><page sequence="1">Anthony Julius. T S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism and Literary Form. Cambridge University Press, 1995. xii, 308 pp. Admirers of T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound have reacted to the overt antisemitism of their poems with responses ranging from pained indifference to fury and outrage. The coexistence of prejudice and poetic genius in these figures has been debated for half a century, and now Anthony Julius offers the most thorough study and the most merciless evaluation of Eliot's antisemitism that we have seen. Julius attacks Eliot's texts with a fury of analysis that far surpasses the force of their casual antisemitic allusions-which are, no doubt, all the more reprehensible for being casual. It is a case of pre-Holocaust bigotry scrutinized by post-Holocaust indignation. Observing that the discourse of antisemitism is rich in implied calumny, Julius exposes the heavy freight of malevolent suggestion in Eliot's allusions to Jews by penetrating analysis. His exhaustive</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 151 reviews of the antisemitic parallels and historical precedents they recall are crushingly convincing, although the connections are sometimes strained, and readers may find some of them both tedious and depressing. In Eliot's poetry, the antisemitic theme is generally confined to his short early lyrics. Julius has little to say about The Waste Land or Eliot's plays or Four Quartets in this connection. However, he comes down very hard on Eliot's prose allusions to Jews, and deals at length with the notorious remark that "free-thinking Jews" would be "undesirable" in the ideal society Eliot envisioned. This has been a favorite opening among Eliot's critics, but it is not really a good point of attack on his antisemitism. In this and other contexts, Eliot, demonstrating a quixotic indifference to social reality, was sketching the conditions of an orthodox, authoritarian High Church community that could never really come into existence, in which liberal thinkers of any kind, even Protestants, would be "undesirable." Julius illuminates the nature of Eliot's antisemitism by comparing it with the views of numerous antisemites and philosemites, exploring its intellectual background in areas only remotely related to it, such as the Oresteia, French Symbolism, and linguistic and aesthetic theory. In these discussions, he brings a staggering wealth of ancillary information to bear on the problem, so that his study approaches the condition of a general overview of the question of antisemitism in literature and art. His documentation is both generous and informative; nearly a hundred pages, or one-third of the book, are devoted to notes and bibliography. Julius perceives a parallel to Eliot's antisemitism in his misogyny, while specifying that his antipathy to women was based on fear, while his aversion to Jews was toned by contempt. He suggests that Eliot, divided both from his native land and the faith of his family, identified himself in some respects with Jews, and that his hostility toward them was a form of self-hatred, as well as a defense against it. In the post-Holocaust years Eliot expressed, or seemed to express, regret for his antisemitic poems, but Julius is unconvinced by these statements, and presents evidence showing that Eliot never repented the prejudice he had displayed. He reviews and repudiates the arguments, many offered by Jewish critics, intended to exculpate Eliot's poems (if not Eliot himself) by holding that their poetic merit neutralizes the prejudice they express, that the antisemitic sentiments are only those of characters, that a work of art, by its nature, cannot be antisemitic, that rejecting the bigotry of Eliot's poems must involve a rejection of modem literature itself, and even that his comments</page><page sequence="3">152 BOOK REVIEWS about Jews are not entirely wrong. He reminds us that Eliot read at the Poetry Center of the Young Men's Hebrew Association in New York twice before any question was raised, and that objections to his third appearance were easily overcome. What attitude, then, are we to adopt toward Eliot's work and, by implica- tion, toward the many works of stature that have a component of antisemitism? Julius's answer is intriguing. He maintains that while the antisemitism of Eliot's poetry can do harm and instill hatred in its readers, it is nevertheless essential, a vitalizing imaginative resource, "positively empowering" (p. 28). He declares that Eliot's poetry is "one of anti-Semitism's few literary triumphs" (p. 33), and that "the exploitation of anti-Semitic discourse is an inseparable part of his greater literary undertaking" (p. 29). Referring to the way in which Eliot compressed the libelous banalities of the antisemitic tradition into a single line about "Rachel, nee Rabinovitch," Julius marvels, "With great virtuosity, Eliot turns that material into art" (p. 91). Again, "Anti-Semitism did not disfigure Eliot's work, it animated it. It was, on occasion, both his refuge and his inspiration" (p. 173). It was even, on occasion, his "muse" (p. 77). It seems, then, that no simple reaction will do, that if literature and art are to be taken seriously, we must accept the fact that they can express vile feelings as well as noble ones without compromising their aesthetic value. As Julius says of Eliot's poetry: "One can teach anti-Semitism from such texts; one can also teach poetry. One reads them, appalled, and impressed" (p. 40).
