<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sidney Bolkosky. Harmony and Dissonance: Voices of Jewish Identity in Detroit, 1914-1967. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1991. 543 pp. Having grown up in Detroit and later turning to modem Jewish history as my profession, I looked forward to reading Voices of Jewish Identity in Detroit. I wasn't sure, however, which part of me wanted to read this book more, the historian or the nostalgic son of Jewish Detroit. I sense that the author, Sidney Bolkosky, who is not from Detroit, became caught up in a similar dilemma which was not all of his making. The book was commissioned by the Jewish Welfare History Committee as its second volume on the history of the Jews of Detroit. (The first volume,</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 251 by Robert Rockaway, was entitled The Jews of Detroit: From the Beginning, 1762-1914.) In his introduction Bolkosky alludes to the frustrations of writing a local study that is to be both serious history and an interesting picture-book celebration of Detroit Jewry. Although the book often leans toward the anecdotal, to his credit Bolkosky tries valiantly to demonstrate how the stories of individuals, families, and organizations "like small tributaries-flow into a confluence with the river of world-historical events" (p. 13). Organized chronologically, the book begins with a description of Jewish Detroit in the first quarter of this century and ends with three "crises" facing Detroit Jewry in 1967: the murder by a deranged congregant of the highly respected rabbi of congregation Shaarey Zedek, Morris Adler; the Arab-Israeli Six-Day War; and the Detroit race riot. If in 1914 there was more "dissonance" than "harmony" among Detroit Jews, by 1967 the major differences among Detroit Jews had decreased in importance. In the first part of the book, Bolkosky offers an interesting portrait of Jewish Detroit, its leadership, neighborhoods, synagogues, and the significant issues Jews confront as a result of Detroit's tremendous post-World War I growth. Burgeoning from thirteenth in size in 1900, Detroit became the fourth-largest city in the United States by 1920. Although German-Jewish leaders remained dominant in this period, and indeed well after, the Eastern European Jewish population came to represent well over 80 percent of the estimated 25,000 Jews by 1915. With more than twenty, mostly Orthodox congregations and a vast network of Jewish organizations and charities, Detroit was becoming a principal haven for Jews who had initially settled elsewhere in the United States. Like many other immigrants, Jews came to take advantage of Henry Ford's $5 a day in wages or, more frequently, the business opportunities that developed from economic growth and the increase in population. The influx of Eastern European Jews into Detroit created the "voices of Jewish identity" that made Jewish life in Detroit, and in many other cities in America and Western Europe, both more exciting and devisive. Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox, secular and religious, Zionist and anti-Zionist, Revisionist and Labor Zionist, Yiddishists, Americanizers, nonpolitical lands- manschaftn, and socialists and communists, the biggest rivalry, nevertheless, remained between German and Eastern European Jews as a whole. Bolkosky discusses this primarily in terms of the organizational battles between the largely German controlled Jewish Welfare Federation, created</page><page sequence="3">252 BOOK REVIEWS in 1926, and the Eastern European Jewish Community Council, begun in 1937. This struggle between the more philanthropically oriented Federation, which many Eastern Europeran Jews considered distant and patronizing, and the more "culturally" Jewish and democratic Jewish Community Council was to play itself out well into the 1950s. The chapters that discuss the struggles between the two organizations and communities are among the most comprehensive in the book. Divided, among other issues, over Zionism, responses to antisemitism, the building of a new Jewish home for the aged, the creation of a Jewish hospital (Sinai), and the opening of the Jewish Community Center on the Sabbath, the two Jewish communities only gradually and grudgingly worked together. To the historian, the most interesting chapters are those dealing with antisemitism and black-Jewish relations. In the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, Detroit was a hotbed of antisemitism. The manifestations of anti-Jewish prejudice ranged from exclusion from country clubs and quotas in universities, hospitals, and professional societies, to the virulent and ideological antisemitic pronouncements and publications of Henry Ford and later Father Coughlin, and to the marches and rallies of the Ku Klux Klan, the Black Shirts, and the German-American Bund. According to Bolkosky, German Jews frequently responded as if antisemitism were more a problem for Eastern European Jews than Jews in general and argued that it was frequently the result of poor education or misunderstanding. Bolkosky indicates that Eastern European Jewish organizations responded more vociferously, but this reader would have liked to see much more on the comparative responses. Bolkosky also examines black-Jewish relations, especially in light of the race riots of 1943 and 1967. Blacks and Jews frequently lived in close proximity, with integration taking place, as the joke goes, from the time the first black moved in until the last Jew moved out. Jews frequently remained in old neighborhoods as storekeepers and landlords, and this plus Jewish concern over increasing crime contributed to the tensions between blacks and Jews. Therefore, Jewish-owned stores and buildings often became targets during the riots. On the other hand, Jewish and black leaders frequently worked together to support antidiscriminatory legislation and practices. Bolkosky's treatment of black-Jewish relations before, during, and after the riots is interesting but, like his treatment of antisemitism, disappointingly brief and incomplete. The historian in me also missed a much fuller examination of the varieties of Eastern European Jewish life and expression. Much attention is given to</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 253 Jewish leaders, the machers in the community, and to the wealthy synagogues like Temple Beth El and Shaarey Zedek, much less to the organizations, synagogues, and lives of the less rich and famous. Still, the Jewish boy from Detroit enjoyed the occasional references to the Galizianer synagogue (Beth Abraham) that he attended, even if one of the cross-streets is given wrong. The descriptions and pictures of the changing neighborhoods and synagogues brought back bittersweet memories, and the discussion of Yeshiva Beth Yehudah helped me to understand why my parents allowed me to change from the afternoon "Hebrew" school to the day school. Though I would have liked to read far more about the Yiddische Folkschule Verein, the references reminded me fondly of my grandmother and made a little more sense out of her politics and Jewish identity. This is not only a book about Detroit Jews; it is also a book primarily for Jews from Detroit. The expert looking for a local history to give more insight into the varieties of Jewish life in America will be disappointed, but the Detroit Jew will find much to delight in. May a second printing or edition eliminate the embarrassing number of typos and occasional picture and location misidentifications.
