Detroit, MI: Wayne State University Press, 2004. viii, 384 pp. doi: 10.1017/S036400940800113X Tamar Katriel's scholarship has already left a mark on the young but rapidly developing field of the study of Israeli culture. Focusing on linguistic expressions, communicative patterns, and ritualized behavior, with attention to their structure and meaning, broader cultural context, and historical development, she has helped open new doors to an interdisciplinary approach to the study of culture. Her latest publication, Dialogic Moments: From Soul Talks to Talk Radio in Israeli Culture, is yet another piece of original scholarship that displays Katriel's unique ability to identify Israeli cultural phenomena that we often take for granted or simply ignore and turn them into worthy subjects of academic inquiry. Dialogic Moments addresses three case studies that might appear at the outset to have little in common: a ritual of confessional talks among early Zionist settlers of the Bitania commune in the 1920s; the cultural style of dugri (straight) talk that emerged in the Sabra culture in following decades; and radio call-in shows in which listeners seek help for personal problems during the 1980s and 1990s. Though each of these moments could be the subject of a study in its own right, Dialogic Moments weaves these cases into a single analyti cal framework that explores the preoccupation with the notion of authenticity and the desire to engage in dialogic relations. As Katriel observes, in an age that 199</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews no longer takes either concept as given, the search for an authentic dialogue becomes a particularly challenging and emotionally charged phenomenon. As she traces this quest from the early pioneering days to the present, her work high lights the social, communicative, and moral dimensions of a continuing cultural pattern and the changes that it has undergone. Part I of the book explores the genre of soul talks (sihot nefesh) that grew out of the pioneering ethos of communal sharing. Katriel's analysis of the confessional talks among members of the small commune of Bitania flit in the 1920s suggests that they offered an alternative to the more dominant approach that marked the pio neers' discourse of nation building, which emphasized the value of action over words. And yet, even though the Bitania experiment was limited in scope, the intense involvement in soul-searching dialogues and spiritual companionship drew attention and even marvel among some of their contemporaries, and criticism and ridicule from others. Katriel suggests that "soul talks" constitute a form of dis course that typically emerges out of a moral crisis and that it can be found in Israeli culture since the days of Bitania flit. Though the concerns raised in the soul talks may change, the engagement in exploring the moral and individual dimensions of group ideology and human behavior remains integral to them. The discussion of the literary and theatrical productions of the historical Bitania talks in later years suggests that although they drew on a nostalgic trend toward the pioneering past, they also served as a venue to critically examine the present through the lens of that past. The famous soul-searching conversations among kibbutz members who fought during the Six-Day War provide Katriel with an example of textualized rep resentations of dialogic moments inspired by the cultural memory of the Bitania talks and the immediate experience of the war. Siah Lohamim (Soldiers' Talks), the edited volume of these talks published in 1967, attracted much public (and unanticipated) attention. The poetic yet somewhat aloof title of the English trans lation, The Seventh Day, highlights the theme of the aftermath of the war but obscures the raw quality of the participants' painful engagement in such issues as human behavior at a time of war, attitudes toward the land and toward Arabs, and the moral question of becoming an occupying force that characterizes this volume. (It may be worth noting that since the publication of Dialogic Moments, a doctoral dissertation exploring the original tapes of the recorded talks against the editorial selection and reworking of the book was completed at Tel Aviv University and therefore is not included in this discussion). Katriel looks at various attempts to follow the footsteps of Siah Lohamim and mark its impact on Israeli culture. Katriel notes that "these contemplative occasions always had a metacommunicative components to them, serving as dis cursive sites for the reassessment of the role played by words in the conduct of social life" (103). Like the earlier criticism of the Bitania talks, Siah Lohamim was criticized for what was seen as a self-righteous attitude (the phrase "shooting and crying" [yorim uvokhim] has since become part of Israeli folklore), and a more radical critique by protest movements later on called for a move beyond talk to a direct action of moral standing by refusing to serve in the military beyond the pre 1967 "green line." 200</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews In the second part of Dialogic Moments, Katriel addresses an Israeli conver sational style that is colloquially identified as dugri talk (the word came to Hebrew via Arabic from Turkish, and its meaning has been transformed in the process). Having explored this Israeli style in depth in an earlier work, Katriel returns to it here as another example of a discursive form that shares the quest for authen ticity with soul talks yet differs from them in its direct and confrontational char acter. To talk dugri means, among other things, to be straightforward and sincere, even at the expense of niceties, for the sake of achieving a genuine dialo gue. Though the dugri interactional style associated with the heyday of the Sabra culture has been softened to a degree, its marks are still evident in interpersonal relations and in Israeli public sphere. Of particular interest is KatriePs discussion of stylistic differences between the Hebrew speaking dugri and the Arabic doing musayra, which helps shed light on communication difficulties between Hebrew and Arabic speakers that go well beyond substantive points of contention. It leaves the reader hoping that this section of this book will become required reading for those who engage in direct negotiations toward resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In the face of the rise of the individualist ethos and the internal fragmenta tion of Israeli society, the Internet and the radio have become alternative discur sive loci to the face-to face soul talks that characterized both the Bitania Hit and the post-1967 discussions. In Part I of Dialogic Moments, Katriel refers to the Internet as creating virtual "intimate groups" in which participants can reveal their dilemmas, self-doubts, and moral questions, and in Part III, she returns to explore the role of the media, this time the radio, as the site of dialogical encounters. Katriel compares two nocturnal call-in radio programs in which lis teners present their personal problems and dilemmas in search of advice and gui dance. Her analysis of the hosts' interactional style and approaches highlights profound differences between their rhetorical, philosophical, therapeutic, or spiritual framework and their community of listeners. And yet both programs provide the opportunity for a dialogic process that connects the individual with a community that is reminiscent of the nocturnal soul talks of Bitania, albeit in a new format and style. Dialogic Moments offers a fascinating look into discursive patterns that are typically Israeli yet are not necessarily recognized as part of the cultural mainstream and may be seen as an alternative cultural channel to the political sphere. Katriel proceeds with her analysis of these patterns with sophistication and care for histori cal contextualization and an eye for the symbolic gesture. The result is yet another important contribution to the emerging field of Israeli culture, and a work that is likely to intrigue the reader well after the reading of the book is completed.
