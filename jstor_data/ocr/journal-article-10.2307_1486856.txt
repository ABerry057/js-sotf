Brill, 1993. viii, 209 pp. Despite the plethora of articles and books on the Jews of Yemen that have been published during the past two decades, our knowledge of the history of this Jewry remains very scanty. The few chronicles written by Yemeni Jews cover only the past few hundred years, and even then do not provide a systematic presentation of the events that befell Yemen's Jewish community. In particular, we lack authentic source material for the period stretching from antiquity to the end of the sixteenth century. As a result, the historical legacy of Yemeni Jewish antecedents is enveloped in myth and legend. Our knowledge of medieval Yemeni Jewry is equally sparse. Indeed, Maimonides' Epistle to Yemen (ca. 1172) is our only source for the internal conditions of the Jews of Yemen in the period preceding the Ayylbid conquest. Even the recent history of the Jews of Yemen is replete with gaps and lacunae. Bat-Zion Eraqi Klorman's book under review, an elaboration of her doctoral dissertation presented to the University of California in 1981, is not concerned with filling any of the historical gaps. Indeed, all the works she refers to in her book have been published by scholars in the field, as she</page><page sequence="2">478 BOOK REVIEWS meticulously acknowledges. Almost all the apocalypses which are the main focus of her discussion were published in 1970 by Yehuda Ratzaby, who pioneered research in this and other areas. Klorman's main contribution (indeed a significant one) lies in the fact that she provides us with a comprehensive treatment of the messianic and apocalyptic currents that prevailed among the Jews of Yemen throughout their known history, viewed within the context of their social and religious matrix. In doing this, she has gone through a vast number of works, Jewish and Muslim, in order to glean relevant information pertaining to the topic of her study. The book begins with a general background, aimed at setting the stage for the main topic of discussion, nineteenth-century Yemeni Jewish messianism. Following this it delineates the major universal themes of Jewish messianism, provides a glimpse into the pre-nineteenth-century messianic outbreaks in Yemen, particularly those of the twelfth century, gives a cursory reference to the Jewish messiah of Bayhan (15th cent.), proceeds with an examination of the disastrous impact which the Sabbatean movement had on the Jews of Yemen, and then shifts to a very insightful discussion of the characteristic themes of Jewish Yemeni messianic writings in the nineteenth century. A whole chapter (chap. 5) is devoted to the rise and fall of three nineteenth- century Jewish "messianic contenders": Shukr Kuhayl I (1861-1865), Shukr Kuhayl II (1868-1875), and Yosef cAbdallah (1881-1893). The book ends with a discussion of the impact which the Jewish messianic fervor in Yemen had on the migration of Yemeni Jews to Palestine. The messianic idea, Klorman notes, is not limited to Judaism and Chris- tianity; it is also rooted, in various formulations, in the traditions of Islam. These traditions, which are claimed to be based on the authority of the Prophet Muhammad, speak of an eschatological personage referred to as al-Mahdf ("the divinely guided one"), who will appear toward the end of time and restore the true faith of Islam. Upon his appearance, Islam will be exalted. While the idea of the Mahdi finds expression in the traditions of Sunni Islam and is very popular among its masses, to the Shici it is an essential creed, an article of faith. The Twelvers give the epithet of al-Mahdi to Muhammad al-Hassan al-'AskarT, the twelfth of their imdms. They believe that this imam has been withdrawn by God from the eyes of man and is now in a state of concealment (makhtfim). This mahdi, whom they refer to as al-Muntazar ("the expected one"), will come forth at the end of time and inaugurate an</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 479 era of the utmost bliss and justice. The doctrines of ghaiba ("concealment") and raj'a ("return") are therefore central to Sh-ii Islam. It should be stressed that the Zaydis who ruled Yemen, although a subsect of Sh-ii Islam, do not subscribe to the doctrine of the hidden imam. Nevertheless, the belief in the Mahdr al-muntazar, in its various forms, has a strong grip upon the masses in Yemen, be they Zaydis, Ismailis, or Sunnis. This faith in a divinely ordained deliverer becomes more acute in times of trial and tribulation, and these were not rare in Yemen, a land which was constantly subjected to the horror of revolts, internecine wars, strife, droughts, and famines. Klorman provides a commendable exposition of the Mahdist movements in Yemen. The significant role which astrology played in medieval societies (Jewish, Christian, and Muslim) is well known. Personal affairs and terrestrial events were believed to be predestined or influenced by the configuration and movements of the celestial bodies. Astral and natural phenomena, the author notes, played a unique role in Yemen among both Jews and Muslims, who paid much attention to them. Comets, meteors, eclipses, unusual winds and storms, thunder and lightning, earthquakes, and the like were considered to be heralds (dald'il) of future events and, as such, were meticulously recorded. Thus, for example, Shabazi, the greatest of all Yemenite Jewish writers, claimed that the year of his birth (ca. 1619) witnessed an unusual appearance of two messianic stars which rose from the east "with tails like a stick." These stars were believed to be proclaiming the imminent coming of the Messiah, who would bring salvation to the world and to the people of Israel. The book provides a fascinating discussion of the impact which astrological elements had on the messianic fervor of both Jews and Muslims. Klorman seems enamored with what this reviewer regards as unwarranted sweeping generalizations and categorical formulations. True, because of their trying experiences, the Jews of Yemen cultivated strong messianic tendencies. The Messiah seems to have constantly loomed upon their horizon. At times, as in the case of the Sabbatean movement, Jews in Yemen threw all caution to the wind and gave way to unbridled messianic enthusiasm, which triggered a harsh reaction on the part of the Zaydi regime. But to depict the Jews of Yemen as "a messianic Jewry" in which messianic fervor played "an unprecedented role in all sectors of life" is, to say the least, questionable. What does "messianic Jewry" mean, anyway? The same is true of the characterization of Yemeni Jewish messianic expressions as uniquely belonging to the tradition</page><page sequence="4">480 BOOK REVIEWS of what Klorman terms "active messianism," a tradition "not dominant in other parts of the Jewish Diaspora," which, as she claims, instead adopted passive messianism. No evidence is provided to support such a categorical statement. Indeed, a survey of the fragmentary history of Yemeni Jewry clearly shows that except for the nebulous episode of the Messiah of Bayhan (mid-15th cent.), one can find hardly any violent messianic eruptions leading to militant uprisings among the Jews of Yemen. Apocalyptic depictions of the end of days with fiery formulations are hardly a unique feature of Yemeni Jewish writings. The author provides a masterful analysis of seven Jewish apocalyptic writings, especially Sacid ibn David's, which combines diverse messianic themes with astrology, traditional legendary material, and local folktales. She also rightly speaks of the strong and pervasive thematic imagery and terminological impact which Islamic eschatology exerted on Yemeni Jewish apocalyptic works, evidenced by the use of such terms as al-Mahdr al- muntazar, al-Sufyadn, al-Nuc'man al-Darwtsh, etc. One wonders, however, whether Klorman has any particular Yemeni Islamic apocalyptic works in mind. If so, which are they? Who were their authors? How do personalities like Faqih Sacid and Sharif Ismacil, referred to as "mahdis" in the Jewish apocalyptic works, figure in Muslim writings? The Yemeni Muslim chronicler al-Wasici dismisses them as mere rebels. A short discussion of Yemeni Muslim apocalyptic works and perhaps some relevant excerpts from such works would have been very helpful. It is also regrettable that in her transliteration of Arabic and Hebrew terms, Klorman does not make full use of the diacritical marks expected in scholarly works. A cursory look at the seven apocalyptic works discussed clearly shows that diverse influences merged to produce them. The imprint of traditional Jewish eschatology, which tends to indulge in uninhibited fantasies about the end of times, as Klorman points out, is indeed pervasive. Also evident, however, is the impact of Jewish mysticism. It should furthermore be remembered that Islamic mysticism (Safism) exerted tremendous influence upon Jewish writers (see, e.g., the writings of Bahya ibn Paquda and Abraham Maimuni), and directly or indirectly upon Yemeni Jewish literary works. It would have been a worthwhile endeavor to trace the extent of these strands of influence on Yemeni apocalyptic and messianic writings. In pioneering studies, there is always much left to be desired. This is also true of Klorman's work under review. It is nevertheless a welcome</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 481 and significant contribution to the study of Yemeni Jewry in general and to fascinating features of its messianic writings in particular. Hopefully, this book will stimulate further investigation into diverse facets of this highly intriguing topic. Reuben Ahroni Ohio State University Columbus, Ohio</page></plain_text>
