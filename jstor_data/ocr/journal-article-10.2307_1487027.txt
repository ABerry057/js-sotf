<plain_text><page sequence="1">Joseph H. Udelson. Dreamer of the Ghetto. The Life and Works of Israel Zangwill. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1990. xv, 314 pp. Israel Zangwill (1864-1926), an Anglo-Jewish celebrity, spokesman, and center of controversy in his own time, fell into relative neglect in later years as a minor literary figure and historical curiosity. At the centennial of his birth, even some of those who recognized the continuing relevance of his efforts to define the Jew in the modern world separated the compelling nature of his struggle from the Victorianness of his writing and the insuffi- ciency of his solutions: territorialism, universal religion, assimilation into an American "melting pot." As John Gross wrote in Commentary, "one honors the writer, and puts aside his books."' But the centennial was also the begin- ning of serious full-length reconsiderations of Zangwill's life and work, such as those by Maurice Wohlgelernter, Elsie Bonita Adams, and Jacques Ben Guigui,2 which called for a new, more sympathetic and detailed reading of Zangwill's fiction, essays, and drama. Joseph Udelson's Dreamer of the Ghetto is an important new contribution to this effort. But while Udelson gives Zangwill's life, and especially his work, the thoughtful and thorough 1.

In a compelling biography in which literary criticism and historical nar- rative illuminate each other, Udelson explores Zangwill's lifelong struggle to define what constitutes Jewish identity in post-Enlightenment society. After an introduction setting forth in basic terms the conflicts of identity felt by "acculturated ... ethnic minorities" (p. 2) and, more specifically, by Wes- tern Jews, Udelson devotes two chapters to the sociopolitical and literary contexts in which Zangwill wrote. These chapters are necessarily brief, and somewhat reductive. In the literary sections Udelson sketches out the important mid-Victorian influences on Zangwill and, somewhat more fully, the context of Jewish writing (both English and Continental) in which he worked. The "sociopolitical" introduction informatively depicts the social and religious organization of Anglo-Jewry at the turn of the century and explains that "despite sociopolitical equality and the reformulation and reduction of the Jewish heritage to a voluntary religious creed, the distinc- tiveness of the Jew was not eliminated" (p. 16). How to deal with that "dis- tinctiveness" was Anglo-Jewry's problem, and Zangwill, Udelson per- suasively asserts, was a would-be maggid who pondered and expressed the tensions of his generation. His life story, ending in disillusionment and breakdown, is seen as "a mashal, a parable, about the dilemma of the con- temporary Jew and about the plight of modern man" (p. 3). Later chapters more or less effectively fill in the details, following the chronological divisions of a career that falls into three stages: a literary period of fiction and criticism in the 1890s; then almost exclusively political activity (including political essay writing) in the first decade of the twentieth century; and, finally, until his death in 1926, a period in which Zangwill sought to combine his work as a Zionist and territorialist with the produc- tion of plays that explored his pacifist and universalist ideals, an allocation of effort that brought him little satisfaction on either count. Udelson more pointedly than earlier biographers credits the mentorship of Jerome K. Jerome for assisting Zangwill to gain a wide readership in his time and become well-known in English literary circles (pp. 111-112), and his analyses of the literature itself are for the most part perceptive and insight- ful. Particularly good are Udelson's discussions of such "non-Jewish" works as The Bachelors' Club (1891), The Master (1895), and "The Serio- Comic Governess" (1902), in which he shows how, even in these, Zangwill reflects the anxiety of dual identity. Treatment of the non-Jewish fiction is</page><page sequence="3">122 BOOK REVIEWS highly selective, however, and occasionally inaccurate.3 Udelson's discus- sions of the Jewish fiction are more complete, his conclusions based on care- ful reading and sustained effort to come to grips with each work. Even where one is inclined to disagree, it is disagreement with a worthy-and well-prepared-opponent. Turning to the political work, Udelson's discussion of Zangwill and Zionism is detailed and informative. His thesis that Zangwill's territorialism allowed him to provide for the cultural persistence of East European Jewish practice while simultaneously advocating Western assimilation (pp. 178-180) is controversial but provocative in the context of Zangwill's liter- ary work, especially Children of the Ghetto (1892). More could be done in chronicling Zangwill's efforts on behalf of feminism and pacifism, but Udel- son does an admirable job of showing how these additional political inter- ests find expression in Zangwill's plays. Dreamer of the Ghetto is essential reading for anyone interested in Zang- will. But it does not supersede the previous studies mentioned and I have serious reservations about the thesis that informs much of its discussion- that the unsuccessful culmination of Zangwill's self-division was a "Zang- willian heresy" of "Christological Hebraism" (pp. 140, 146). Udelson comes to this conclusion through what seems a flawed reading of Dreamers of the Ghetto (1898), a collection of fictionalized biographies of such diverse visionaries as Spinoza, Sabbatai Zevi, Uriel Acosta, and the early Zionists, among others. It is often considered (as it is by Udelson) Zangwill's greatest work. Udelson finds it "amazing" that the book's "proclamation of a 'new religion' of universal Christological Hebraism has gone almost completely unnoticed" by critics both at the time of publication and later (p. 146). What seems more likely, however, is that readers then and now recognized in it- even in its opening poem, "Moses and Jesus"-a wider preoccupation. As the life stories in Dreamers of the Ghetto repeatedly illustrate, those who called themselves Christians were, in Zangwill's view, often just as empty of the humanistic values of religion as many of those who called themselves Jews. And as Udelson himself obliquely acknowledges (p. 148), Jews of Zangwill's place and time often thought of their religion, its values and heroes, in relation to Christianity. In discussing Children of the Ghetto and Ghetto Tragedies (1893), Udelson demonstrates how both these works reflect Zangwill's sense of "the necessity for, despite the ironic futility of, 3. Can it be said, for example, that a work such as The Big Bow Mystery, almost con- tinuously in print since 1891 and used as the basis for three commercial films, has "attracted scant attention" (p. 274, note)?</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 123 self-sacrifice and noble ideals" (p. 113). The recognition, and tragedy, of this universal dilemma also mark Zangwill's Dreamers. Udelson, however, implicitly rejects Zangwill's humanistic view of Judaism. He defines a crisis in Zangwill's experience, resolved in art through Dreamers of the Ghetto (1898) and in life through marriage to the gentile Edith Ayrton in 1903-a schematic analysis that seems unfair to both spouses. Udelson's statement that the marriage "severed him finally from his closest Jewish teachers, Solomon Schechter and Moses Gaster" (p. 150) is somewhat misleading. Israel Abrahams, for one, remained a significant Jewish mentor, but Udelson minimizes the importance of Zangwill's rela- tionship to liberal Judaism. Instead, underlying much of Udelson's discus- sion is the idea that the divisions of identity that plagued Zangwill are ultimately irresolvable (and, for Zangwill, self-destructive) because of his failure to embrace or even understand traditional Judaism. Dreamer of the Ghetto avoids didacticism on this point and in fact effectively illustrates the much wider implications of Zangwillian self-division, most notably in an epilogue discussing the parallel situation of W. E. B. Du Bois. But the author's distaste for Zangwill's unorthodoxy is apparent, and creates an uneasy subtext. It should be acknowledged more directly in a book that intends to introduce Zangwill to the general reader as well as to the scholar. Both, however, should find this work a thought-provoking introduction to Israel Zangwill, whose lifelong efforts at defining modern Jewish identity must meet with sympathy and interest if not always approval.
