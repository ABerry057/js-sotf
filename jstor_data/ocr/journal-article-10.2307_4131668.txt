<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review 30:2 (2006), 313-324 So EASILY ASSIMILATED: THE NEW IMMIGRANT CHIC by Adam Rovner Last year, a friend' drew my attention to the lyrics of a famous song in Leonard Bernstein's Candide, the composer's first attempt in 1956 to write the "Great American Opera."2 The song, "I Am Easily Assimilated," remains one of the best-loved musical numbers from the play and includes the following lines: My father came from Rovno Gubemya. But now I'm here, I'm dancing a tango My father spoke a High Middle Polish. In one half-hour I'm talking in Spanish: Por favor! Toreador! I am easily assimilated. I am so easily assimilated.3 The irreverent lyrics are often credited to Bernstein himself and refer to the biogra- phy of his father, Sam, who immigrated to America from the province (gubernya) of Rovno. This Jewish tango exhibits a musical pastiche of Hispanic and Klezmer traditions in its instrumentation and displays a manic shift from Russian to English to Spanish that mirrors the composer's playful notation that it be played "Moder- ato Hassidicamente."4 The song is both a parody of and a monument to the assim- ilatory spirit. My friend, however, thought I would be interested in the song because my last name is Rovner; he expected that I would want to track down Bernstein's reference to the area, Rovno, that lent my family its patronymic. Both my real and presumed relationship to the song thus reflects a wider American Jewish struggle between assimilation and the search for authenticity. And as genuinely interested as I am in the coincidence of Bernstein's origins and my own, my interest in my European Jewish roots strikes me as faintly embar- rassing, as if I were participating in some kind of reverse Mayflower Society snob- bery. Not that there is anything wrong or even unusual about looking for one's 1. Thanks to Bob Goldfarb. 2.

In fact, the widespread fascination with Jewish genealogy, for eastern European "memory tourism," for what Irving Howe once dismissed as the "nos- talgia for the nostalgia of other people,"' only underscores the fact that for Jews in America, the refrain "I am so easily assimilated" may as well be our anthem. What I am suggesting is that the sometimes frantic American Jewish search for roots derives from our sense-right or wrong-of having been so easily assimilated during the last hundred or so years since Jewish immigration peaked in 1907. Quite simply, our loss of manifest difference-religious, ethnic, linguistic, and geographic-has entailed a concomitant desire to assert some difference in our cultural artifacts. This observation leads me to sing the praises of the recent wave of American Jewish immigrant writing in a minor key. It is not the literature I have my doubts about, it is what the phenomenon of its appearance may signify and what their critical and popular reception implies. I am referring to three recent works, all written in English and published in the United States: Gary Shteyngart's novel The Russian Debutante's Handbook (2002), Lara Vapnyar's short stories collected in There Are Jews in My House (2003), and David Bezmozgis's collection of linked stories, Natasha (2004).6 Although Bezmozgis is, in fact, Canadian, for the purposes of this essay, I have annexed him to make up a convenient troika. All three writers have had stories appear in the New Yorker, a literary institution that almost since its inception has served as the Ellis Island for Jew-ish writers wanting to achieve establishment respectability, a list that includes Dorothy Parker, S. J. Perelman, A. J. Liebling, J. D. Salinger, and a host of postwar writers who did not draw the curtain of initials over their heritage. Despite widespread acclaim, the proximity of their publication dates, and certain similarities in subject matter, these three books are not alike in any stylistic sense. Shteyngart's satiric novel is a manic burlesque of arriviste immigrant ambi- tions that includes a zany cast of characters, Ponzi schemes, and ludicrous terrorist plots. Bezmozgis's spare collection is suffused with a comic melancholy and nar- rated from the point of view of a young boy who ultimately grows to a kind of stifled maturity as he negotiates an alternately hostile and promising new world. Vapnyar's stories feature intimately observed, domestic moments of measured intensity that only occasionally yield an anxious humor. Fitting Vapnyar's work in with Shteyngart's and Bezmozgis's is problematic, not only because of her different aesthetic but also because her collection of stories focuses primarily on the hardships of life in the Soviet Union rather than the immigrant experience.7 But what unites these works is the fact that they received a great deal of publicity and critical attention focused on the immigrant origins of their authors.

I first began thinking about contemporary Jewish American immigrant lit- erature in September 2004, when the Chronicle of Higher Education ran a piece by scholar Donald Weber, an authority on American Jewish literature and culture.8 In his engaging article, Weber surveys the works of Shteyngart, Vapnyar, and Bezmozgis. He describes how these writers and others serve to dis- prove what he calls the "Howe doctrine."9 Here, Weber refers to a claim that Irving Howe made in the introduction to his anthology Jewish American Stories, pub- lished in 1977.10 Howe wrote, "American Jewish fiction has probably moved past its high point. Insofar as this body of writing draws heavily from the immi- grant experience, it must suffer a depletion of resources, a thinning out of materials and memories."" For Howe, the end of American Jewish fiction was rooted in sociological data-the end of immigration meant the end of creativity. I should point out that a more nuanced reading of Howe's statements indicates that he was decidedly undoctrinaire about his assertion. In fact, he concluded his preface with the caveat that it would be "far better to be open and tentative (even if also skeptical)" about American Jewish literature's future.12 Other mes- sengers of American Jewish literature's demise have been far less conciliatory than Howe. In 1976, a year before Howe's book appeared, Ruth Wisse warned that the years of American Jewish literature's creative power "seem to be coming to an end."13 A decade later, in 1986, Leslie Fiedler announced that "the Jewish-American novel is over and done with."'4 Contemporary scholars of American Jewish literature routinely point out how this earlier generation of doomsayers has been proved wrong, and they note the robust ranks of contempor- ary American Jewish writers as evidence.'5 The recent Cambridge Companion to Jewish American Literature (2003), for example, makes rebutting the "Howe doctrine" something of a touchstone.16 8.

Or, at least, Howe might have been right that "American Jewish fiction has moved past its high point," but for the wrong reasons.17 Howe's conception of authentic Jewish expression was based on historically limited categories: linguistic, geographic, and socioeconomic. The mistake that Howe makes is that his perspective on Jewish culture was not historical enough. What he does is substitute indefinite and transient categories for some imagined kind of American Jewish essence and then mourn its waning. To Howe, authentic American Judaism was fundamentally tied to the lost "world of our fathers"-the urban, working-class, Yiddish-speaking immi- grant culture of the Lower East Side, the East Bronx, and other Jewish enclaves in which American Jews existed apart from American culture rather than as a part of it. In Howe's view, Jews could be socially dynamic, but authentic Jewish- ness was fixed in time, place, and language. In a somewhat similar fashion, several narratives by contemporary immigrant writers suggest there exists a transhistorical and transnational Jewish essence that marks their protagonists as inalterably Other. Moreover, at least in Shteyngart and Bezmozgis, the immigrant chic occasionally descends into what scholar Michael P. Kramer calls "ethnic schtick"'8-a self- referential, jokey pastiche of Jewish difference that, to my mind, signals the "depletion of resources" that Howe predicted. Howe's most skeptical-most jaundiced, some might say-pronouncement on Jewish American literature's future appeared almost a decade after he had edited Jewish American Stories. In a brief 1986 piece for New York magazine titled "Immigrant Chic," Howe describes with irritation "the upsurge of nostalgia ... among a good many young people for the immigrant world ... which they barely know."'9 He proclaims that he does not want the "immigrant- Jewish milieu ... to become 'material' for chic museum displays and cozy Yinglish musicals."20 Here, he targets, among other things, Fiddler on the Roof a musical he skewered in a famous review in Commentary in 1964.21 Such mass- culture extravaganzas, with their necessarily watered-down content, he warns, merely offer "occasions [...] for philistine observances among affluent Jews."22 In his writings, Howe repeatedly objects to a sentimentality that he believes distorts the "lost hopes and surviving pains"23 of immigrant Jewish life-a process he helped encourage with the publication of his World of Our Fathers in 1976.24 17.

For their part, Vapnyar, Shteyngart, and Bezmozgis substitute the deprivations of late-twentieth-century communism-the casual antisemitism, the officious kleptocracy, the empty shelves and crumbling Stalinist edifices- for the dangerous and benighted conditions of the eastern European shtetlekh. Upon arrival in di goldene medina, the modem immigrants' cramped apartments, humiliating jobs, and unfashionable clothes suggest the struggles of early- twentieth-century tenement life. Misha, the protagonist of Vapnyar's story "Mis- tress," lives in Brooklyn with his mother and grandparents in a "one-bedroom apartment with unevenly painted walls, faded brown carpet, and secondhand fur- niture."25 In The Russian Debutante 's Handbook, protagonist Vladimir Girshkin is teased by his "Hebrew school chums" for his "ill-fitting overcoat with its inherent East Bloc smell."26 Meanwhile, Mark Berman, the narrator of Bezmozgis's collec- tion, arrives in the New World with his "Baltic aristocrat" parents only to live in a fifth-floor apartment just "one respectable block away from the Russian swarm."27 Later, Berman recalls being taunted at Hebrew school because his father drives an old "red shitbox" of a car.28 As chroniclers of the world of their fathers, the narra- tors of recent Jewish American immigrant fiction seem more preoccupied with status than with simple existence. The experience of being forced to wear one humiliating overcoat pales in comparison to the exhaustion, economic exploita- tion, and physical danger faced by Lower East Side garment workers. Unintention- ally, perhaps, Shteyngart and Bezmozgis parody previous narratives of Jewish immigration and assimilation. Today, the discovery of Russian Jewish immigrant "hopes and surviving pains" may really be an attempt to claim a vicarious Jewish distinctiveness that only underscores the successful acculturation of earlier generations of Jews into the American mainstream. Contemporary American-Jewish-Russian writers offer readers a new immigrant chic, their multiply hyphenated identities nesting like matroyshka dolls. These immigrant Jews are the Jews who are not us, but whom we once were. In this context, it is worth remembering that politically orga- nized American Jews actively sought Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union. Tens of thousands participated in the refusenik campaigns-the letter writing, the rallies, the fund-raising, the resettlement efforts-during the 1970s and 1980s. Therefore, there may be a creeping form of paternalism at work here; these are our immigrants. Such a sentiment has not escaped the attention of the writers themselves. In his story "Roman Berman, Massage Therapist," Bezmozgis offers an indictment of a wealthy, suburban Jewish doctor who "wanted to know how 25. Vapnyar, There Are Jews in My House, 96. 26.

She confesses to him, "I like you because you're a small, embarrassed Jew. I like you because you're a foreigner with an accent."30 As American Jewish economic and political power continues to grow, perhaps readers like to be reminded of a time when Jews were a small, embarrassed community of foreigners speaking in Yiddish accents. Still, I do not want to overstate my case and suggest that reviewers and readers have turned to these books only out of a desire to experience the frisson of deprivation or some illusory notion of authenticity. All three writers are talented, empathic, witty, and careful observers of humanity. There is much more to these books than a beggarly revelation of scars for the gratification of others. But significantly, these works expose the Jewish desire for acculturation while presenting an unmediated version of Jewish difference. The new immigrant chic suggests, perhaps wishfully, that Jews are not so easily assimilated-that they are essentially vulnerable, scared, or in some way physically marked as Other. Shteyngart's Vladimir Girshkin is constantly ident- ified as Jewish because of his physical features. His own mother, a grotesque amal- gamation of crass parvenu types, says that he walks "like an old Jew from the shtetl," his "little Jew-walk" fit only for "Amatevka" or the "Vilnius ghetto."31 Later, Vladimir comes to identify his being a Russian Jew as synonymous with being a victim.32 His actions paint him as a schlemiel among the Russian mafiosos; his fate is to be beaten by skinheads at the behest of his boss, who is nonetheless "positively awed" by "persons of the Hebrew race."33 In Bezmozgis's story "An Animal to the Memory," the youthful Mark Berman learns what it means to be a Jew only when he is forced into a terrified, tearful confession of faith after being manhandled by his disapproving rabbi during Holocaust Remembrance Day.34 Ultimately, Berman learns that being Jewish means being weak, passive, and fearful. The myth of Jewish difference, of the Jew as unalloyed victim, is made manifest by these two authors. Some of the most fertile ground for American Jewish writing today serves to assert Jewish difference-or better, the nostalgia of difference. This partly explains the fascination exerted by other multiply hyphenated American Jewish writers who treat obvious forms of Jewish otherness, such as homosexuality (Tony Kushner, Lev Raphael, Aryeh Lev Stollman) or the trauma of being a second- or third-generation "witness through the imagination"35 to the Holocaust 29.

The hyphens of these writers' identities exist as part of a broken line that connects readers to a past of marginalization or physical vulnerability. Not surprisingly, such visions of difference frequently figure Jewish identity in terms of social, political, or psycho- logical victimhood. Jews are rendered as distinct, chosen either by genetics or history for a special, often grim fate. Previous generations of American Jewish writers who chronicled the immi- grant experience strove to accentuate Americanization. The immigrant narratives of Mary Antin, Abraham Cahan, Anzia Yezierska, and Henry Roth certainly did not obscure the Jewishness of their characters and milieu. Yet in terms of genre, their works all participated in the venerable American literary tradition of narra- tives of conversion, of making it, of an American education, of, in short, assimila- tion. In important ways, as Michael P. Kramer points out, critical discussion of such works in terms of their Jewish content inverts their inherent narrative logic.36 But the narrative logic of contemporary Jewish American immigrants turns on the nearly inalterable circumstance of the protagonists' identifiable Jew- ishness. This unshakeable essence-though depleted for the most part of religious tradition-poses the greatest obstacle to their acculturation. Postwar chroniclers of Jewish parvenus, such as Saul Bellow, Bernard Malamud, and Philip Roth, fre- quently chafed at being considered Jewish writers and preferred to assert the Americanness of their novels, which often emphasize an expansive or porous sense of ethnic and religious identity. For these postwar writers, Judaism is seen as a performance rather than an essence.37 By contrast, American (or Canadian) identity is what appears as performance in the novels of the new immigrant chic; what remains essential is a variously figured Jewishness. It seems that the more Jews in North America appear the same, the more we try to stay changed. Though Shteyngart and Bezmozgis hark back to both the immigrant narra- tives and the parvenu novels, they subvert the logic of these earlier narratives by asserting essentialized Jewish characters. In their fiction, deracination compels the racialization of Jewish identity. Vapnyar, whose work I find the most subtle and accomplished of the three, also flirts with essentialized Jewish identity in her story "A Question for Vera." Young Katya learns from her preschool friend Vera that her "eyes are too big," and she concludes, disappointedly, that "to be a 'Jewess' was to be not normal."38 Here, Vapnyar exposes the irrationality of notions of Jewish physical inferiority and ironically undercuts them. The narra- tives of Shteyngart and Bezmozgis, however, insist that being Jewish means not being normal. In Bezmozgis, the practice of Judaism itself becomes identified with marginality when the elderly gaba 'i of a synagogue defends his motley 36. In his article "Assimilation in The Promised Land: Mary Antin and the Jewish Origins of the American Self," Prooftexts 18, no. 2 (1998): 121-48, Michael P. Kramer comments, "The impulse to study Jewish-American literature runs counter to-indeed inverts--the narrative logic of The Promised Land" (123). 37. Thanks to Jeremy Z.

Without them we would never have a minyan."39 For Shteyngart's Girshkin, his second-rate status in America devolves from his Jewishness and returns him inexorably to his eastern European roots: "There was a sorting mechanism at work [in America] by which the beta immigrant was discovered, branded by an invisible B on his forehead, and eventually rounded up and put on the next plane back to some dank Amatevka."40 Here, it seems that Shteyngart misnames the fictional village of Anatevka, near where Sholem Aleichem's Tevye the Dairyman lives.41 Tevye, of course, is the inspiration for Fiddler on the Roof the musical that, for Howe, epitomized a misplaced American Jewish sentimental- ity and signaled imminent cultural decline. For Shteyngart's protagonist, then, the marker of Jewish essence and his authentic locus of origin becomes the fictional Russian shtetl of Sholem Aleichem's tales as they were (mis)represented in a Broadway show that was enthusiastically embraced by the American public.42 Irving Howe observed wistfully that the American Jewish subculture "finds its voice and its passion at exactly the moment it approaches disintegration."43 The critical and commercial success of Russian Jewish immigrant authors reveals a similar paradox: The difference they formulate is already, in a way, posthumous. The new immigrant chic charts the aftershocks of an assimilation that has already been accomplished. This dynamic should not surprise us; it is, after all, a rough description of the process of a deeply American kind of mythologization. The myth of the frontier came into being precisely as it closed, and representations of its heroes-the cowboys-proliferated with approximately the same speed with which they rode off into the sunset of existence. American Jewish literature shades toward mythology-Steve Stern's tales of an imaginary Memphis shtetl, Michael Chabon's invocation of the golem legend in The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, Ben Katchor's deployment of a mytho-heroic Mordechai Manuel Noah in The Jew of New York-as the distinctive American Jew vanishes. It is not hard to imagine that such writing responds to a threat or fear of total assim- ilation by asserting a distinctiveness that is meant to forestall oblivion. Leslie Fiedler formulated the idea that "the Jewish American novel ... must be a problem novel, and its essential problems must be those of identity and assim- ilation."44 We might agree with Fiedler and suggest further that American Jewish literature is recognizable as such precisely when it reflects the tension between 39.

As this tension has attenuated over time, readers have sought out newer, more visible versions of this dynamic. The historical develop- ment of American Jewish literature naturally records the uneasy see-saw between acculturation and the assertion of difference. In the late nineteenth and early twen- tieth centuries, and through the postwar era, much of American Jewish literature clamored for acceptance, emphasizing narratives of Americanization that postu- lated a fundamental Jewish consanguinity with American democratic, even Protes- tant values. Contemporary American Jewish literature appears to protest these correspondences, often to the point of essentializing Jewish identity. Jews are different, these works suggest, because of blood and birth, because of gender or sexual orientation, or because of appearance and temperament. It is particularly surprising that younger American Jewish writers would betray an obsession with a supposed Jewish physical essence, given that this echoes a trope of antisemitism. Perhaps they may even be expressing a nostalgia for enforced differ- ence. But it is even more surprising that the rhetoric of extremely sophisticated critics seems to support the very traditional-one might say reactionary-belief in fundamental Jewish difference. Two of the most outspoken proponents of the "new Jewish cultural studies," brothers Jonathan and Daniel Boyarin, seem to posit an essentialized Jewish dis- tinctiveness and identity. In the introduction to their groundbreaking volume, tell- ingly called Jews and Other Differences, they write of their mission: "[O]ne of our main goals ... is to move toward the recognition of Jewish culture as part of the world of differences to be valued ... together with the differences of other groups hanging onto cultural resources similarly at risk of being consumed by a liberal universalist ethos."45 Americanization-at least in its liberal guise-is here viewed as a kind of radical hospitality that is eager to devour Jewish culture or, more appropriately, I think, cultures. The "liberal universalist ethos" that once held out the promise of religious and cultural freedom emerges in the Boyarins' rhetoric as a ravenous existential threat. The "land that eats its inhabi- tants" is not the particularist Promised Land but the democratic promised lands of liberal discourse.46 Likewise, their introduction laments that the economic success of Jews "as a group" in America has been achieved "by and large at the cost of deculturation."47 Though the authors' disclosure of how historiography has often "devalu[ed] Jewish difference in exile" is valuable, their expressed preference for a supposed authenticity that has been lost to the triumphs of acculturation and social mobility is troublesome. My problem with this hierarchy of values lies in the fact that the dichotomy between difference and assimilation, where it is not clumsy in and of itself, is simply the latest expression of the historical propensity of Jewish communities to acknowledge their difference, as Amos Funkenstein points out, "in an idiom 45. Jonathan Boyarin and Daniel Boyarin, eds., Jews and Other Differences: The New Jewish Cultural Studies (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1997), xi. 46. [ " 'erez 'okhelet yoshvehah "]. See Numbers 13:32. 47. Boyarin and Boyarin, Jews and Other Differences, xi. 321</page><page sequence="10">Adam Rovner always acquired from their environment."48 Funkenstein identifies this process as the "dialectics of assimilation."49 He disapproves of efforts to locate "what is orig- inal and therefore autochthonous in Jewish culture, as against what is borrowed, assimilated and therefore of alien provenance."50 Rather, he emphasizes that "even the self-assertion of Jewish cultures as distinct and different is articulated in the language of the surrounding culture; assimilation and self-assertion are truly dialectical processes."51 The modem Jewish obsession with maintaining a distinct identity, he explains, is the result of adapting the "heritage of romanti- cism"52 to traditional religious prohibitions.53 In other words, the notion of Jewish difference is a Western secularization of a religious imperative. Funkenstein dismisses the notion that there exists any sort of stable, essential, fundamental Jewish identity waiting to be dissolved in a cultural melting pot. Any such postulation, he suggests, always betrays in its very ideological premise a cultural borrowing that subverts any firm notion of Jewish alterity. Paradoxically, the rhetoric of new Jewish cultural studies that rails against "deculturation" is merely another iteration of the supposed deculturation it decries. So easily assimilated, indeed. Though I have suggested that the new immigrant chic may represent a kind of last stand for the notion of Jewish difference, I also want to emphasize that today, Jewish difference is more likely that not a self-assertion. The continued insistence on Jewish distinctiveness owes more to our nostalgia for difference than to any American diffidence. Pervasive self-assertions of Jewish distinctive- ness participate in a broader trend of multiculturalism. On college and university syllabi, multiculturalism has taken the welcome form of narratives that emphasize disempowerment and gender-based, sexual, racial, linguistic, and socioeconomic marginality. Proposing and disseminating notions of Jewish difference has become a means of assimilating into an America that celebrates heterogeneity and glamorizes the ethnic chic. Perhaps, then, insisting on Jewish otherness is just a contemporary facet of ongoing Americanization, the latest manifestation of the dialectics of assimilation. All too often, of course, American Jewish writing has been subject to the strict quotas of multicultural syllabi, where it is not denied lodgings at academia's exclusive multicultural establishments altogether.54 To echo another line from Bernstein's song, "These days you have to be/In the majority." Being in the majority in contemporary American literature means 48. Amos Funkenstein, "The Dialectics of Assimilation," Jewish Social Studies 1, no. 2. (Winter 1995), 9. 49.

American Jewish writing today-particularly the new immigrant chic-has assimilated that lesson well. It is no surprise, therefore, that Chang-Rae Lee, the Korean American author whose debut novel, Native Speaker, is now a canonical work of Asian American literature, discovered Shteyngart. Or rather, Shteyngart discovered himself to Lee by mailing him his manuscript in an act of immigrant chutzpah that would make Abraham Cahan's David Levinsky proud. What attracted Lee to his protdgd is equally telling. Lee marveled that "It's as if Woody Allen had been an immigrant. Compared to Shteyngart's novel, which vibrates with life, so much immigrant lit seems so darned serious."55 And what could be more readily identifiable as Jewish in American culture than the figure of the schlemiel, embodied by Manhattan's most famous neurotic? Indeed, Shteyngart's Vladimir Girshkin emerges as a particularly troubling schlemiel-or more accurately, he is troubling because he is a caricature of a schle- miel. Ruth Wisse sketches the long history of the schlemiel in her indispensable study The Schlemiel as Modern Hero. She views the schlemiel as a Jewish version of the stock figure of the fool whose appearance she traces from the Middle Ages. Wisse attributes the early popularity of the Jewish fool figure to "his utility as a metaphor for European Jewry .... Vulnerable, ineffectual in his efforts at self-advancement and self-preservation, he emerged as the archetypal Jew, especially in his capacity of potential victim."56 In contemporary American arts and letters, the Jew as schlemiel remains a convenient and popular metaphor for many of the same reasons, existing as a consummate outsider. Marriage-intermarriage-is one of the few means available for the schlemiel to transcend his nature. The stereotypical Gentile wife, the shiksa who is familiar from Woody Allen's and Philip Roth's cinematic and literary imaginations or from comedian Paul Reiser's hit 1990s sitcom Mad about You, exists as a symbol of complete Americanization. The schlemiel has become a kind of Jewish American frog prince who, when kissed by his non-Jewish bride, hops from the Lower East Side to an apartment on the Upper West Side. Only in Shteyngart's novel, Girshkin makes the jump to the American Midwest when he marries his fair Gentile maiden. His marriage transforms him into a "real man" according to his mother, though she laments that his bride is not "a little blonder."57 In Girshkin's own eyes, it is his son who will be the one who ulti- mately becomes "an American in America" because he will be "free of the fear and madness of Vladimir's Eastern Lands.""5 Here, on the final page of the book, Jewish essence is opposed to American essence, though the world of the father is circumscribed by the performance of supremely American rites: "He'll put in 55.

Their schlemiel-dom helps identify them as Jewish, and thus it essentializes them for American readers who are familiar with the array of representations that equate male Jewish identity with the schlemiel in contemporary arts, letters, and popular culture. These two authors' essentialized Jewish characters-and Chang-Rae Lee-suggest all that remain are enervated visions of Jewishness: the Jew as sad sack, sexual bumbler, or comic tummler. Such representations lack deep cultural, historical, or religious affiliation. Jews are figured as different, but harmlessly so. That immigrant writers postulate some Jewish essence grounded in preva- lent stereotype and are celebrated for doing so suggests, as Howe predicted, that American Jewish resources and memories are being depleted. We may want these writers to fill the reservoirs and exercise the memories of distinctiveness that we feel are waning. In the immigrant writers, we see or think we see a link to authenticity and origin, to the gubernya of our fathers. Yet this authenticity may never really have existed except as a myth-a myth that is easily assimilated by a younger generation that asks the world of our fathers to do the work of the grandsons and granddaughters.60 Adam Rovner Hofstra University Hempstead, New York 59.
