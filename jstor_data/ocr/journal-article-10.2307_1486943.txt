<plain_text><page sequence="1">TALMUDIC PORTRAYALS OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN RABBIS: AMORAIC OR PSEUDEPIGRAPHIC? by RICHARD KALMIN Introduction In both halachic and aggadic contexts the Talmud frequently supplies information about the relationships between sages. Sages interact with each other, or comment on each other's erudition, piety, personality, and the like. From what sources does the Talmud derive this information? From sources contemporary with the sages involved, or from sources of a much later time? Some of the talmudic information is attributed to named authorities, some of it is presented anonymously. Are the attributed statements pseude- pigraphic or authentic? Are there substantive distinctions between the attri- buted and the anonymous statements? Are the anonymous statements amoraic or post-amoraic? I cannot answer all of these questions in detail here, and certainty on I wish to thank Professor Shaye J. D. Cohen of Brown University for his searching critique of an earlier version of this paper. Professors Judith Hauptman and Burton L. Visotzky of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America also suggested several valuable improvements. Partic- ular thanks are due the Stroock family and the Jewish Theological Seminary for awarding me the Stroock Faculty Fellowship, allowing me a semester of uninterrupted research and writing.

I will demonstrate the likelihood that some of this information reliably depicts relationships between sages and is not the polemical invention of contemporaries and students. Finally, my analysis will support the claims of David Halivni, Shamma Friedman, and others that by detaching the anonymous from the attributed sections of the Talmud and studying these sections independently, we add significantly to our understanding of the talmudic sugya.' Through this pro- cess of detachment, we will discover significant differences between amoraic and anonymous editorial reactions to the personalities of amoraim. Definition of Terms The terms "commentary," "dialogue," and "stories" play an important role in my analysis, and it will be helpful to define them at the outset of the discussion. By the term "commentary," I refer to remarks made by Rabbi X or an anonymous editor based on or in response to a statement or action by Rabbi Y in situations where it is clear that the two rabbis are not speaking together and are not mentioned in the context of a single story. A sugya might begin, for example, with Rav ruling that it is forbidden to drink wine touched by an idolater. Rav Sheshet might follow with an objection against Rav's ruling, and according to all available evidence Sheshet had no direct contact with Rav. Sheshet's statement based on the statement by Rav falls under the category of "commentary" for the purposes of this study. Rav Yehuda, however, might respond to a statement by Shmuel, with all manu- scripts and medieval commentators agreeing that Yehuda made his state- ment in Shmuel's presence, that "Rav Yehuda said to Shmuel," and with 1.

In such circumstances, Yehuda's statement is con- sidered "dialogue" rather than "commentary," for by the term "dialogue," I refer to actual communication, either when the amoraim involved speak together in each other's presence, or when they communicate indirectly, via messenger. Admittedly, dialogue and commentary are at times difficult to dis- tinguish. A text which originally read "Shmuel said X. Said Ray Yehuda: But is it not the case that . . ?", i.e., which originally contained commentary by Yehuda based on Shmuel's statement, might be "corrected" by scribes to read "Shmuel said X. Said Rav Yehuda to Shmuel: But is it not the case that . . .?", i.e., might be transford by scribes into dialogue. The opposite might also take place, with scribes transforming dialogue into commentary because of their assumptions that the rabbis involved were not speaking in each other's presence.2 Several factors, however, reduce the significance of this uncertainty for my purposes. If two amoraim appear frequently throughout the Talmud, and manuscripts and medieval testimonia agree that they never or only rarely appear in each other's presence, then we can conclude in individual cases, with a fair degree of confidence that they engage in commentary and not dialogue when the sugya contains no hint that they dialogue in each other's presence. Our confidence is increased if the sources supply chronological or geographical reasons why the two amoraim could not have appeared in each other's presence. The Talmud contains abundant evidence, for example, that R. Yirmiya spent much of his scholarly career in Palestine, and that Abaye and Rava lived their entire lives in Babylonia. When the text presents Abaye or Rava commenting on Yirmiya's statements, we can accept the text with a reasonable degree of confidence. By the term "stories,' I refer to reports of events or actions, and also to actions or statements found within a narrative framework which begins with a description of the physical setting in which the action took place or the statement was made. This description can be fairly elaborate, but more typi- cally is extremely simple, consisting, for example, of the information that Rabbi X was sitting down when he made his statement. The beginning of a 2. See Eliezer Shimshon Rosenthal. "Rav Ben-Ahi R. Hiyya Gam Ben-Ahoto?" in Hanokh Yalon Jubilee Volume, ed. Saul Lieberman. E. Y.

The conclusion of the story, however, is often difficult to discern. It is often unclear whether a statement placed at the conclusion of a story is part of the story or is com- mentary on the story. The chronological and geographical factors helpful above in distinguishing dialogue from commentary are not so helpful here, since the story might conclude with commentary by a rabbi from a different time or a different place, providing perspective on the events or opinions narrated in the body of the tale. Throughout this study, statements conclud- ing stories will be considered doubtful commentary, but this uncertainty will not significantly alter my findings.3 Three Approaches to the Historicity of Talmudic Sources Scholars have approached the question of the historicity of talmudic sources from a variety of perspectives. It will be helpful to describe three approaches relevant to the present study. Many scholars maintain the likeli- hood of extensive editorial reshaping and even fabrication of talmudic stor- ies and halachic statements, and lament the scarcity of firm criteria by which to determine a source's date. According to this view, it is extremely difficult, often or usually impossible, to determine which sources are early and which are late. Even when a source can be dated to the amoraic period, close to the events and personalities described, its value as a historical source still needs to be ascertained. A source can be early but fictional, or late but historically reliable. Many sources were very likely composed a generation or two after the fact, reflecting a slightly later perspective, still within living memory or only slightly removed from the events and personalities described. Given this wide range of possibilities, drawing firm conclusions about generations, periods, and especially individual sages is a highly speculative undertaking.4 3. See also David Goodblatt.

With regard to the tannaitic</page><page sequence="5">TALMUDIC PORTRAYALS OF AMORAIC RELATIONSHIPS 169 A second approach claims that the Talmud permits generalizations about generations or periods, but not about individual rabbis.5 According to this approach, it is impossible to verify whether a statement or action attributed to a rabbi actually derives from that rabbi. It is possible, however, to speak reliably about the distinct contribution of generations or periods, since each period has its own unique features of thought, legal concepts, ter- minology, and formal expression. These unique features develop from one period to the next, a likely sign of organic growth rather than editorial mani- pulation. According to a third approach, the issue of how to exploit the Talmud as a source for history presents no problem. Some scholars see a one-to-one correspondence between ancient rabbinic texts and the historical events these texts purport to describe. Once miraculous elements and editorial accretions have been removed, these scholars believe, the "original source" which remains is an accurate reporting of historical events or a reliable recording of rabbinic dialogue.6 Why Would Later Generations Invent Information About Earlier Sages? With regard to the question of contemporary versus noncontemporary origin of talmudic sources, one could legitimately ask why later generations period, see Gary Porton.

A variety of different answers can be given, and I will suggest two. Perhaps schools founded by early rabbis persisted for several generations or even centuries, and late authors attacked rival schools by composing accounts which reflected poorly on the long-dead founders of these schools. By means of attacks on the character of Socrates, for example, the school of Socrates was attacked by rival schools after the sage's death.7 In addition, later generations might compose accounts about early rabbis who possessed or were said to possess some outstanding characteris- tic which particularly suited the author's message. Rav Sheshet's blindness, for example, might make him an especially fitting subject of a story which teaches that spiritual insight is far more powerful than physical sight.8 Even centuries after his death, Sheshet might be made the protagonist of such a tale, for perhaps he had come to be the archetypical blind scholar, whose immense spiritual gifts more than compensated for his physical short- comings. A story featuring Sheshet and Rami bar Hama, which casts Rami in an extremely unflattering light, will illustrate this point.9 Rami jealously lashes out at his former subordinate, Rav Yizhak bar Yehuda, who abandons Rami as his superior in favor of Sheshet. Yizhak bar Yehuda explains that Sheshet is preferable because he answers questions with quotations of tan- naitic sources. Armed with tannaitic sources, Sheshet protects himself against refutation, for even if a contradictory baraita is cited, the matter will end in a stalemate. Rami, however, responds with logical arguements, which are much weaker. He leaves himself vulnerable to attack, since a contradic- tory tannaitic source will refute him. Rami challenges Yizhak to ask a ques- tion, expecting to demonstrate the power of his responses. Yizhak obliges, and Rami, true to form, counters with a logical argument. Yizhak quotes a contradictory tannaitic souce, and Rami, bowing to the superior authority of the baraita, acknowledges defeat. The story is in part a didactic tale demonstrating the superiority of a style of learning which emphasizes knowledge of traditional sources in favor 7.

The story molds actual events or fabricates them entire- ly in an effort to influence the way rabbis learn and teach. Does the story derive from the amoraic period, however, close to the time of the individuals described? Or was it composed much later by authors who chose stock characters equipped by tradition with attributes relevant to the lesson the authors wished to teach? I will argue below that in many instances these questions can be answer- ed, but I see no way of answering them in the present case. Sheshet is else- where singled out for his remarkable erudition, his vast knowledge of tannaitic sources.'0 Rami, on the other hand, possesses harifuta, keenness and sharp discernment, a positive quality which leads him into error, appar- ently causing him to rely too heavily on his intellectual gifts and neglect careful examination of several matters." Perhaps Sheshet's legendary exper- tise, Rami's sharpness of intellect, and the criticism of Rami found in several sources (see below) induced a late storyteller to choose them as protagonists and to cast Rami as the villain of the piece. Perhaps the author's exclusive concern was the story's message, and Rami and Sheshet are relevant only insofar as they serve this larger concern. Deciding Between the Various Scholarly Approaches Is it possible, however, to decide in some instances between the contra- dictory scholarly approaches outlined above? Is it possible to make valid generalizations about the reliability of talmudic sources as history? With regard to the third approach, which accepts talmudic sources at face value as historical evidence, recent studies have demonstrated that access to the original version of a talmudic passage (or, more accurately, access to the earliest version that modern scholarship is capable of reconstructing) does not guarantee access to the original words of the speaker or to the historical event, if any, which lies behind the passage. The historical core may not be recoverable, for opinions and events are frequently molded, colored, and distorted by the desires and beliefs of the original authors and their intended 10.

Facile identification between text and history is no longer pos- sible.12 Is it possible, however, to decide between the other approaches described above? Is it possible to determine whether contemporaries, near- contemporaries, or later editors originated the opinions or composed stories about the rabbis? If the sources are contemporary, are they reliable his- torical evidence or are they polemical fabrications? Can we make accurate statements about individual rabbis, or only about generations and periods? Perhaps the subtle character sketches and vivid portrayals of personali- ties and relationships found in talmudic sources can help us to answer our question regarding the date of these sources. In discussing the famous story of Resh Lakish's conversion to the rabbinic way of life,'3 a student of mine once remarked that the story could not be the work of later editors because the characters were too real and the issues too immediate to be the invention of authors far removed from the events and personalities described. This argument, unfortunately, fails to settle the issue. The character of R. Yoha- nan might be of pressing concern to an author living centuries after the Palestinian sage's death, for example, if Yohanan had come to personify Palestinian learning and the late author was passionately convinced of the superiority of Babylonian scholarship. By attacking Yohanan,'4 this late author might simultaneously be attacking contemporary opponents who viewed themselves as Yohanan's disciples." Similarly, competition between Sura and Pumbedita, Babylonian rabbinic centers of the talmudic and geon- ic periods, might be expressed at the end of the talmudic period in the form of stories vividly depicting conflict between Rav Hisda and Rav Yehuda, important early representatives of these two cities. A story in which a stu- dent of Yehuda, Rami bar Tamari, demonstrates Hisda's inferiority to 12.

One important fact, however, helps answer one of the questions raised above. This fact suggests that talmudic sources in which rabbis are criticized or insulted, or addressed with ambivalence or jealousy, are most likely not the work of later amoraim or editors, but are roughly contemporary with the events and personalities described. Analysis of statements by Rav, Rav Sheshet, R. Yirmiya, Rav Yosef, Rami bar Hama, and Rav Ashi reveals that rabbis chronologically removed by more than a generation are addressed primarily as disembodied authors of authoritative pronounce- ments. They are addressed as sources of knowledge, that is, as abstract texts. Contemporaries, however, occasionally address one another with hostility, ambivalence, or competitiveness. This point bears restating. Commentary ascribed to rabbis more than a generation removed from their sources contains almost none of the harsh insults and ambivalences which frequently characterize commentary ascribed to contemporaries and near-contemporaries. Commentary ascribed to rabbis more than a generation removed tends to be dispassion- ate, to respond to the substance of the statements and not to the statements' author. Even more importantly, contemporaries and near-contemporaries express not only anger or surprise in response to specific statements or actions, but also the conviction that a particular sage is fundamentally flawed or inadequate. The accusation will be made, for example, that a rabbi's traditions are untrustworthy, that he violates the halacha, that his premature death was punishment for his failure to show proper respect toward great scholars, that he has not served as apprentice to a rabbi and is therefore not a full-fledged member of the rabbinic community, and the like. Such accusations, which strike at the very core of a rabbi's character, appear only in commentary ascribed to contemporaries and near- contemporaries. Once the chronological distance between commentator and source goes beyond a single generation, such thorough denunciations are totally absent. It bears repeating that by the term "commentary," I refer to remarks made by Rabbi X or an anonymous editor based on or in response to a statement or action by Rabbi Y in situations where it is clear that the two 16. Hullin 110a.</page><page sequence="10">174 RICHARD KALMIN rabbis are not speaking together and are not mentioned in the context of a single story. Defining the term "commentary" in this fashion enables me to confine the discussion to cases in which interaction between contemporaries approximates interaction between rabbis separated from each other by several generations. Examination of such cases reveals that commentary by contemporaries is qualitatively different from commentary by later amor- aim in expressing negative or hostile attitudes. I will analyze anonymous editorial commentary in greater detail later on in the discussion, observing that anonymous commentary is likewise devoid of criticisms of sages. For the moment, however, I will confine my remarks to amoraic commentary. According to the findings above, later amoraim are unlikely to have invented commentary in which contemporary rabbis display hostility toward one another.'7 If the sixth-generation amora Rav Ashi, for example, played an important role in composing commentary in which Rav is criticized, then why is Ashi's explicit commentary on state- ments by Rav detached and dispassionate, utterly devoid of emotion? Only contemporaries and near-contemporaries emerge as likely candidates for authorship of commentary which addresses Rav other than as an abstract text or an object of veneration, since only they express negative emotions in their commentary on Rav's statements. I am not claiming, it is important to note, that the sources are always true, that events usually took place the way the Talmud describes, or that statements are always faithfully and accurately reported. Depending on the perspective of the speaker, for example, an individual such as Rav might be portrayed as saintly or wicked, as knowledgeable or ignorant, as the super- ior scholar of his generation or as inferior to his contemporary, Shmuel. A statement might reflect the perspective of Rav himself or of certain disciples of Rav, and therefore distort or even fabricate his attitudes toward a con- temporary sage. The distortion or fabrication, however, very likely dates from the early amoraic period, close to the time of Rav himself and perhaps deriving from Rav himself, and is not testimony to the inventiveness of a later editor. At this point in the discussion, it is no longer necessary to maintain the distinction drawn above between commentary, dialogue, and stories. This 17. I will discuss below the question of whether or not later editors invented hostile com- mentary and ascribed it to earlier figures.</page><page sequence="11">TALMUDIC PORTRAYALS OF AMORAIC RELATIONSHIPS 175 distinction allowed me to highlight the contrast between contemporary and later amoraic attitudes toward sages, which led to the conclusion that later amoraim did not compose hostile commentary by contemporaries. This conclusion, however, for reasons which I will discuss below, applies also to dialogue and stories. Later amoraim are also unlikely authors of face-to- face dialogues and stories in which attitudes other than reverence or neutra- lity are displayed toward earlier rabbis. As was the case with hostile com- mentary attributed to contemporaries, so also are hostile exchanges in dia- logues and unflattering portrayals in stories without parallel in later amoraic literature. Hostility toward Rav, for example, is totally absent from Rav Ashi's statements. Rav Ashi, therefore, is no more likely to have com-: posed hostile stories about Rav, or nasty dialogues between Rav and his contemporaries, than he is to have invented hostile commentary based on Rav's statements. These conclusions, it is essential to point out, apply only to dialogues, stories, and commentary in which rabbis are not merely anthropomorphized abstractions, ideals, and values given names and historical settings. These conclusions apply only to dialogues, stories, and commentary in which rabbis are not merely assigned actions and words in order to give concrete expression to abstract ideas or ethical principles. In such stories and dia- logues (such as the story above, which unfavorably contrasts Rami bar Hama to Rav Sheshet), the desire to deliver the message, the moral lesson or theological statement, might be powerful enough to induce later generations to overcome their reluctance to criticize earlier rabbis. The negative por- trayal might be essential for attainment of their moral or theological goal, with the personalities themselves mere props serving loftier purposes. My conclusions apply only to dialogues, stories, and commentary in which such goals are not discernible, or do not totally determine the portrayal of a rabbi. Often in dialogues and commentary, for example, one rabbi insults another rabbi, and the insult serves no discernible purpose other than ren- dering the argument more colorful, more interesting, and more unfor- gettable. The substance of the argument would be completely unaffected by its removal. Such insults most likely originate close to the time of the partici- pants themselves, for why would later generations be so selective, adding insults and criticism only to dialogues and commentary by contemporaries and near-contemporaries? Is commentary by later generations not in need of similar embellishment?</page><page sequence="12">176 RICHARD KALMIN With regard to stories as well, the rabbis, as people, are at times not merely vehicles for the teaching of some moral or theological lesson. At least part of the purpose of some stories is to damage a rabbi's reputation, to prove that a particular individual is wicked, or that his claims to rule or to superior scholarship are unfounded.'8 I am not suggesting that talmudic stories portray character or personality as ends in themselves, along the lines of a modern novel or short story. I am claiming, however, that some stories criticize individuals out of hostility to them, and that such stories are rough- ly contemporary with the sages involved, since the attitudes revealed by these stories are totally without parallel in later literature. The issue is an extremely complicated one, and cannot be treated fully in the context of the present study. The following two examples will illustrate my claim regarding the purpose of some talmudic stories, however.'9 One story tells of competition between Rabbah and Rav Yosef, contem- porary third-generation amoraim, for the office of head in Pumbedita. Yosef is referred to as "Sinai," and Rabbah as "uprooter of mountains," allusions, apparently, to their different styles of learning. Yosef is designated the superior scholar and chosen to rule, in preference to Rabbah, but when Yosef refuses the appointment,20 Rabbah rules in his stead for twenty-two years. Only after Rabbah's death does Yosef assume the position that was rightfully his years before.21 Very likely, this story is an attempt to explain why Rabbah, the inferior scholar according to the authors of this tale, was chosen to rule ahead of Yosef. The story displays concern for Yosef and Rabbah as people, and not simply as anthropomorphized abstractions, disembodied authors of author- itative statements, or mouthpieces for the authors' values. Once again, the 18. Cf.

Cf. the treatment of the stories involving Rabbah and Rav Yosef in Kalmin, "Saints or Sinners, Scholars or Ignoramuses?" pp. 194-196. 20. According to some versions, he refuses because of an astrological prediction that he will die soon after taking office. According to other versions, no reason is stated, and perhaps Yosef refuses out of humility or out of a desire to avoid public office and leave himself more time to study. 21. Berakhot 64a (and Horayot 14a).</page><page sequence="13">TALMUDIC PORTRAYALS OF AMORAIC RELATIONSHIPS 177 point of the story is to bolster the reputation of one scholar at the expense of a contemporary competitor. I observed above that in the ancient world members of a school founded by a sage long dead could be attacked by means of unfavorable stories told about the school's founding sage. Accordingly, in an earlier study I left open the possibility that later editors invented the above account of the competi- tion between Yosef and Rabbah.22 I suggested that the school of Yosef, gen- erations after Yosef's death, might have invented the story, bolstering their claims to supremacy against competing claims by the rival school founded by Rabbah. Based on my findings in the present study, however, it is likely that the story was first told during or close to the time of Rabbah and Yosef them- selves. Neither post-fourth-generation amoraim nor anonymous editors express dislike for Rabbah or betray a preference for Yosef over Rabbah. Later commentary on Yosef's statements is detached and dispassionate. Rava, however, twice states that a particular question was difficult for Rabbah and Yosef for twenty-two years,23 and that only when Yosef became head was the matter satisfactorily resolved.24 The twenty-two-year figure chosen by Rava is a clear echo of the twenty-two years Rabbah ruled prior to Yosef according to the story above, and very likely Rava implies that only when the appropriate sage, Yosef, finally took office were matters satisfactorily resolved. In addition, in two or three cases the fourth- generation Pumbeditan, Rav Nahman bar Yizhak, respectfully refers to Yosef as "Sinai," the only cases outside the story of his competition with Rabbah in which Yosef is referred to in this manner.25 It makes sense that Nahman bar Yizhak, Rava, or circles close to both amoraim authored the story recounted above, a likelihood increased by the fact that Rava is por- trayed throughout the Talmud as Yosef's subordinate, but not as 22. See Kalmin, "Saints or Sinners, Scholars or Ignoramuses?" pp. 179-180. 23. Or that for twenty-two years Yosef posed a certain objection to Rabbah. 24. Ketubot 42b and Baba Kamma 66b. 25.

Perhaps the chrono- logical difficulty in the latter context is best solved not by erasing the words "bar Yizhak," but by reversing the names, such that Rav Nahman bar Yizhak quotes Rav Yosef and refers to him as "Sinai."

A second case in which an important concern of a story is to denigrate a particular sage depicts Ray Dimi MiNehardea visiting Mahoza with pro- duce for sale. Ray Ada bar Ahava tests him to see if he deserves special mar- ket privileges reserved for sages. Dimi fails the test, and Ada humiliates him and denies him market privileges, causing his produce to spoil. Dimi com- plains before Ray Yosef, who curses Ada, promising that God will certainly punish the Mahozan sage for his cruel treatment of Dimi. A report of Ada's death follows, and Yosef boasts that he, Yosef, "punished" Ada and caused his death. Other comments follow, all by amoraim who had face-to-face contact with Ada, who claim that Ada's death was appropriate punishment for the disrespect he displayed toward great sages (i.e., themselves). The sugya concludes with another story which depicts Ada's death not as deserved punishment, but as a tragic mistake resulting from his great knowl- edge of Torah. Very likely, this sugya has a homiletical purpose, polemicizing against the practice of cross-examination of sages newly arrived in unfamiliar local- ities, suggesting that it leads to conflict and tragedy.27 The sugya also has a theological interest in accounting for the premature death of a rabbi. Very likely, however, the stories comprising this sugya have an interest in the per- son, Ada, independent of any homiletical or theological concerns. Their solutions to the riddle of his premature death are determined in part by their attitudes toward Ada as a person, by their stand on the question of whether he was righteous or wicked, and by their opinions on whether his death was deserved punishment or a tragic mistake resulting from his great knowledge of Torah. 26. Rava is sometimes considered to be a student of Rabbah as well, but this is most likely incorrect.

In ana- lyzing each story, for example, the story's relationship to its larger redac- tional context needs to be carefully examined, to determine whether the story has been molded in accordance with larger redactional concerns. For the time being, these examples illustrate my claim and establish the likeli- hood of its applicability in similar contexts. Are the Patterns Described Above the Work of an Editor? An objection could be raised against the arguments advanced thus far. According to one influential modern scholarly theory, whose most promin- ent spokesman is Jacob Neusner, the bulk of the Talmud was composed by later editors. These editors, claims Neusner, very likely had access to earlier amoraic sources, but reworked them so exensively that at present it is impossible to distinguish early from late in the talmudic sugya, to differen- tiate the contribution of the amoraim from that of the editors.29 Perhaps the patterns described above, therefore, should also be viewed as the invention of later editors. That is, the editors who composed the bulk of the Talmud perhaps invented the dialogues, stories, and commentary described above, attributing hostile responses to those amoraim most likely to have expressed them, namely to contemporaries and near-contemporaries. The editors' motive might have been to create a convincing portrait of earlier generations to lend credibility to their claims to be accurately reporting the opinions and actions of earlier rabbis. According to Neusner's theory, the patterns described above might be the invention of later editors, and not testimony to the attitudes of amoraim toward their contemporaries. Alternatively, perhaps later generations created the strong negative responses to amoraim such as Rav and attributed them to much earlier rabbis out of respect for the giants of the past or out of concern for their own reputations. Later rabbis perhaps hesitated to express such sentiments 28. See the other studies by this author, cited above. 29. See, for example, Neusner, Making the Classics in Judaism, pp. 1-12 and 19-44.</page><page sequence="16">180 RICHARD KALMIN in their own names, but felt free to do so in the names of earlier scholars. Perhaps later editors, for example, did not have the audacity to openly insult or express ambivalence toward Ray, and therefore attributed such senti- ments to Shmuel, Rav's contemorary. Neusner's theory regarding the role of the editors, however, is problema- tic. The character of the Talmud on virtually every page betrays its character as a patchwork quilt rather than the flowing discourse of an individual sage or a coodinated team of editors. As the researches of David Halivni, Shamma Friedman, and many others have abundantly demonstrated, the Talmud is a collection of sources of diverse origins, much, but not all of whose diversity has been eliminated by editorial activity.30 My own research has shown the dramatic differences between the anonymous, editorial sec- tions of the Talmud and the attributed, amoraic sections. The former are mostly argumentational, multitiered, and prolix, while the latter tend much more to be prescriptive, single-tiered, and brief. The former are editorial in character, concerned with issues affecting the totality of the sugya, while the latter are concerned with specific issues, for example, a problem arising out of one aspect of a lengthy sugya.3' Traditional commentators from the medieval period until the present have struggled valiantly to view the Talmud as a seamless whole, and the futility of their efforts and the inadequacy of their interpretations testify eloquently to the untenability of their approach. Absolute certainty on this issue is beyond our grasp, but despite Neusner's claim to the contrary, the Talmud is most likely not the work of a lone genius or a coordinated com- mittee. The differences between contemporary and noncontemporary reac- tions to the statements and personalities of rabbis are most likely the result of genuine generational contrast and are not the planned creation of a single author or an editoral committee. Perhaps it will be argued that early sources, of necessity, passed through the hands of later rabbis. It follows that later generations frequently allowed conflicts between scholars and criticisms of earlier rabbis to pass through 30. See, for example, David Halivni, Mekorot u-Mesorot: Yoma-Hagiga (Jerusalem: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1975); Mekorot u-Mesorot: Shabbat; Mekorot u-Mesorot: Eruvin- Pesahim; and Friedman, Perek ha-Isha Rabbah ba-Bavli. For a similar argument advanced in a critique of Neusner's work on the Mishna, see Shaye Cohen, "Jacob Neusner, Mishnah, and Counter-Rabbinics," Conservative Judaism 37 (1983): 48-63. 31. Kalmin. Redaction of the Babylonian Talmud, pp. 5-7, 38-57.</page><page sequence="17">TALMUDIC PORTRAYALS OF AMORAIC RELATIONSHIPS 181 their hands without comment. Presumably they were aware of the implica- tions of these accounts, and yet willingly transmitted them. It is only a small step, one might argue, to suppose that on occasion they also composed them. I disagree. The acts of transmission and composition are clearly distinct. In every age, traditional sources are transmitted by individuals and groups unwilling to or incapable of composing such sources themselves. To use an imperfect analogy, Jews in the modern world transmit their holy writings, the Bible and Talmud, despite the fact that these books do not conform to their own religious sensibilities in many respects and would be written much differently today. The fact that editors and later amoraim transmit stories and dialogues perhaps foreign or repugnant to their own sensibilities in no way implies that they would compose such material themselves. The Statements of Rav, Ray Sheshet, and Ray Yosef It will be helpful at this juncture to discuss the specific evidence of the sources and illustrate the arguments advanced above.32 Ray Examination of statements by Ray supports my contention that hostile commentary is attributed almost exclusively to contemporaries and near- contemporaries. One amora separated from Ray by a full generation responds negatively to Rav's statements and actions with relative frequency. Specifically, Ray Sheshet remarks seven times that "Ray said this while lying down drowsing."33 Later amoraim, however, never express compara- ble sentiments. 32. Statements by Rav Ashi were also analyzed in detail for the purposes of the present study. Explicit commentary attributed to Ashi contains no criticisms, insults, or complex emo- tional responses to statements by earlier rabbis, and the same is true of commentary by very late amoraim based on Ashi. On Pesahim 57b, Ashi criticizes Yissakhar Ish Kefar Birkai, but Yis- sakhar is identified, and criticized, as a wicked high priest on Pesahim 57a. On Pesahim 70b, Ashi refers to Yehuda ben Dortai as a "separatist," but Yehuda ben Dortai apears only in this one context, and we have no clear idea who he is, or even that he is a rabbi (or a Pharisee). See Hyman, Toldot Tannaim ve-Amoraim, pp. 559-560. 33. Yevamot 24b and 91a, Baba Kamma 47b, 65a, and 67b, Bekhorot 23b, and Niddah 60a. In addition, on Pesahim 109a and Kiddushin 71b, either Rav Yosef or Abaye curses statements by Rav (on Moed Katan 12b, all versions agree that the author is Abaye). Apparently, Yosef</page><page sequence="18">182 RICHARD KALMIN Shmuel's relationship with Ray, more fully documented than any other relationship between first-generation rabbis, will further illustrate my point. Due to the fact that they are contemporaries, however, the opinions they express about one another must be considered doubtful commentary. Shmuel's commentary on statements by Ray and Rav's commentary on statements by Shmuel reveal a combination of harsh opposition and fierce competition.34 Shmuel acerbically dismisses opinions by Ray with the declaration that "if Ray said this, then he knows nothing about the laws of Shabbat,"35 or about defects in animals which render them unfit for human consumption,36 and the like.37 Ray Tahalifa bar Avdimi decides a case in conformity with Shmuel's view and against Rav's, and Ray declares his actions to be "ruinous."38 Elsewhere, Shmuel responds in the same fashion when Ray Yosef b. d'Rav Menashya MiDevil decides in favor of Ray.39 Fin- ally, when R. Elazar reports Rav's opinion before Shmuel, Shmuel com- mands his attendants to "stuff Elazar with barley [animal fodder]." Among other third-generation amoraim, furthermore, reaction to Ray is either positive or impersonal, conerned exclusively with the content of Rav's statements. According to one account, Ray Hisda thirsts after state- ments by Ray, offering his priestly portion to the first person who quotes an unfamiliar tradition in the name of Ray.40 Ulla, a third-generation Pales- tinian scholar, twice expresses respect for the Babylonian sages in lofty terms. "Who will give me dust [from the graves of] Ray and Shmuel that I might fill my eyes?"41 he begs. Elsewhere, Abaya informs us that Rabbah, a third-generation amora, always follows the opinion of Ray, except in three and/or Abaye respond to the substance of the opinions alone, but the vehemence with which they express their opposition might be fueled by animosity toward Ray, the author of the opinions. We find no hint of animosity toward Ray by either Yosef or Abaye in other contexts, however, and Yosef's or Abaye's curses are not uniquely directed against Ray. See Masoret ha- Shas on Kiddushin 33b. 34. We also find examples of cooperation and profound respect. See Kalmin, "Saints or Sin- ners, Scholars or Ignoramuses?" pp. 187-189. 35. Shabbat 53a. 36.

I have argued elsewhere that some accounts contain irreconcilable contradictions and most likely derive from diverse sources.44 My point is that on several occasions, negative responses to statements and actions of Ray are attributed to contemporaries and near- contemporaries, but that such negative reactions recede as we move later in the amoraic period, ceasing altogether after Rav Sheshet in the third genera- tion. The relative frequency with which Shmuel and Ray Sheshet criticize statements and actions by Ray increases the likelihood that their reactions are fueled by strong feelings toward Rav as a person and are not disinterest- ed evaluations based solely on the merits of the case. Very likely, these nega- tive responses derive from the early amoraic period, close to the time of Rav himself, and reliably depict contemporary and near-contemporary reaction to Rav, even if the reactions are not always those of Shmuel and Sheshet themselves. Rav Sheshet Analysis of amoraic commentary based on statements by Rav Sheshet, a third-generation Babylonian amora, further illustrates the claims made above. Sheshet and contemporaries and near-contemporaries occasionally criticize one another, in contrast to later amoraim, who never criticize Sheshet. Sheshet's hostility toward Rav was mentioned above. In his only objec- tion against a statement by Shmuel, in contrast, Sheshet expresses surprise that a "great man like Shmuel would say such a thing."45 I could discern no 42. Shabbat 22a. 43. Sanhedrin 72a. Our texts read Rava, but in light of Rabbah's preference for the views of Rav, it seems likely that Rabbah is referred to. In general, manuscript variation between the names Rava and Rabbah is so common that even when all versions agree, we cannot be certain which amora is referred to. See Kalmin, "Friends and Colleagues or Barely Acquainted?" pp. 125-135, esp. pp. 129-130. 44. Kalmin, "Saints or Sinners, Scholars or Ignoramuses?" pp. 187-190. 45.

Very likely, these attitudes derive from the amoraic period, close to the time of Sheshet himself. Rav Yosef Analysis of statements by Rav Yosef yields patterns similar to those described above. Yosef occasionally criticizes contemporaries and near- contemporaries, responding to them as people and not simply reacting nega- tively to the substance of their statements. Yosef's boastful claim of responsibility for the death of Rav Ada bar Ahava, for example, was discussed above. In another context, he questions the reliability of R. Evyatar, a second-generation Palestinian sage, and offers as proof Evyatar's violation of the halacha.49 Yosef criticizes several other statements by contemporaries,50 but in the above two contexts it is clear that his reaction is fueled by ill-feeling toward the individual and not merely momentary anger or irritation in response to 46. See also Moed Katan 24b for Sheshet's comment on a statement by R. Yizhak, a third- generation Palestinian sage. See also Shabbat 43a-b. 47. Baba Batra 9a-b. 48. Baba Mezia 16a. Rami bar Hama exclaims "Behold the man [i.e., Sheshet] and behold the objection!" Rava remarks "I see the man, but I do not see the objection." Perhaps Rava shares Rami's high opinion of Sheshet, but simply denies that in this particular instance Sheshet's argument is decisive. On the other hand, perhaps Rava suggests that Sheshet is a man and nothing more, in contrast to Rami, who implies that Sheshet is an extraordinary man. 49. Gittin 6b. 50.

As the chronological distance grows, however, the importance of the individual fades, and the substance of statements by ear- lier rabbis becomes the exclusive concern of Yosefs commentary. Yosef twice criticizes statements by rabbis separated from him by more than a gen- eration, but most likely he reacts to the substance of the statement and bears no special ill-feeling toward the statement's author. Specifically, in one context Yosef is troubled by R. Yehuda ha-Nasi's silence during Avdan's attempted humiliation of R. Yishmael b'R. Yosi, and criticizes his inaction.5" No special ill-feeling toward Yehuda ha-Nasi is revealed by Yosef's statement, which is merely criticism of his actions in one specific context. Elsewhere, Yosef criticizes a tanna, R. Hillel,52 exclaiming, "May his master [i.e., God] forgive R. Hillel" for claiming that "There will be no Messiah for Israel, for they already enjoyed him during the days of Hezekiah." Hillel's opinion, however, is clearly at odds with the common rabbinic belief in the coming of the Messiah. Yosef most likely reacts to the substance of the statement, a reaction not fueled by particular concern for the character of its author, R. Hillel.53 Only in the cases discussed above does Yosef respond critically to state- ments by rabbis who predate him by more than a single generation or more. Most likely, the talmudic record of Yosef's negative responses to contem- poraries and near-contemporaries reflects his actual attitudes, or contem- porary conceptions of what Yosefs attitudes were. Does the Talmud Supply Accurate Information About Individual Sages? Two Case Studies Rava and Rami Bar Hama As a result of my findings, we are able to describe with greater confi- dence rabbinic attitudes toward contemporaries and near-contemporaries. 51. Yevamot 105b. 52. Sanhedrin 99a. 53. See also Gittin 56b, where either Yosef or R. Akiba reacts to Yohanan ben Zakkai's fail- ure to respond effectively to Vespasian, the future Roman emperor, just prior to the destruction of Jerusalem. According to Yosef or Akiba, God deliberately confounds Yohanan's speech, di- rectly intervening at this criticial juncture in Jewish history and causing Yohanan to request a scholarly refuge at Yavneh rather than an end to the Roman siege. Yosef (or Akiba) does not criticize Yohanan, but rather transforms the encounter into an act of God, eliminating Yohanan's responsibility for the final outcome.</page><page sequence="22">186 RICHARD KALMIN It remains to be seen whether the sources permit us to make accurate state- ments about individual rabbis, or only about generations or periods. If Abaye, Rava, and R. Yirmiya express contempt for one another, for exam- ple, can we only state in general terms that some middle-generation Baby- lonian amoraim who moved to Palestine clashed with sages who remained in Babylonia, or can we draw conclusions about the specific individuals mentioned? I will conclude that in some cases, the Talmud very likely pre- serves accurate information about individual rabbis. Absolute certainty, however, is not yet, and may never be, completely within our grasp. Analysis of amoraic commentary based on statements by Rami bar Hama, a third and fourth-generation Babylonian amora, for example, reveals that Rami bar Hama is of intense concern as a person to Rava, Rami's younger contemporary, but not at all to subsequent generations. Rava's attitude toward Rami can best be described as ambivalent. The two amoraim are portrayed as subordinates of Rav Hisda, and on one occasion are depicted as study partners. Both are Hisda's sons-in-law, with Rami predeceasing Rava and Rava marrying his widow. Their lives, therefore, are intimately intertwined, and supply clear motivation for a complex relation- ship. Psychohistory is a perilous undertaking when applied to talmudic per- sonalities, however, and we must be careful to avoid the anachronistic pro- jection of modern preoccupations onto ancient personalities. I note these details because they may shed light on other aspects of their relationship (see below), but whatever conclusions we draw must be considered extremely tentative. Rava's strongest expression of disapproval toward Rami comes in response to Rami's refusal to count Rav Menashya bar Tahalifa as one of three learned men included in the preliminary invitation to say the blessing after meals.54 Rami considers Menashya to be an am ha-arez, a less than full-fledged member of the rabbinic elite, and therefore excludes him. A report of Rami's death follows, and Rava claims that Rami died because of his exclusion of Menashya, implying that Rami's death came as punishment for the insufficient respect he displayed toward another scholar. Rava's ambivalent attitude toward Rami is most clearly expressed in one context in which Rami induces his superior, Hisda, to reverse roles and per- form a menial task on Rami's behalf, like a student serving his teacher. In exchange for Hisda's service, Rami agrees to reveal his interpretation of a 54. Berakhot 47b.</page><page sequence="23">TALMUDIC PORTRAYALS OF AMORAIC RELATIONSHIPS 187 mishna. Rava reacts with amazement and very likely more than a hint of jealousy in response to Hisda's acceptance of Rami's argument, which he thinks is faulty. Someone whose master favors him can do whatever he pleases without losing his master's favor, exclaims Rava, and proceeds to refute Rami's reasoning."5 Rava's ambivalent attitude toward Rami is very likely indicated by three contexts in which Rava credits Rami with harifut, sharpness and keen dis- cernment, but claims that this very strength led him to shabeshta, careless error (see above).56 The fact that Rava singles out Rami for criticism in di- verse contexts, furthermore, increases the likelihood that he responds to Rami the person and not merely to the substance of Rami's statements.57 Rava portrays Rami as a formidable but one-dimensional scholar, a por- trayal also found in the story which unfavorably compares Rami to Rav Sheshet, examined in detail above. As indicated above, Rava's attitude toward Rami is totally without parallel in later amoraic literature, and later generations are therefore unlikely candidates for authorship of Rava's commentary on Rami. Despite some obscurities, several aspects of Rava's attitude are comprehensible, and the portrait which emerges is perfectly believable as the ambivalent reaction of one rabbi to a contemporary. Given the present state of our knowledge, I see no reason to deny that the Talmud preserves Rava's actual attitude toward Rami, or at least remnants of this attitude, since a complete picure does not emerge from the scattered facts about their relationship provided by the Talmud. We must also make allowances for a degree of editorial standardization which all amoraic statements have undergone, and cannot presume to have Rava's original words.8" Were we to have a more complete record of amoraic reaction to Rami, furthermore, we might discover differ- ent versions of Rava's attitude toward Rami, perhaps indicating that the Talmud provides direct access not to Rava's attitude, but to the next genera- tion's versions of what that attitude was. 55. See also Yoma 22b. 56. Eruvin 90a, Baba Mezia 96a-b, and Niddah 33a-b. 57. In two of the three cases (Eruvin 90a and Baba Mezia 96a-b), it is unclear whether the phrase in question was authored by Rava or by the anonymous editors. Rava is most likely the author, however, for as we will argue below, the anonymous editors do not criticize amoraim. See also Halivni, Mekorot u-Mesorot. Eruvin-Pesahim, pp. 233-234. 58. See William Scott Green, "What's in a Name? The Problematic of Rabbinic 'Bio- graphy,"' in Approaches to Ancient Judaism: Theory and Practice, ed.

Yirmiya and His Babylonian Contemporaries Amoraic commentary on statements by R. Yirmiya, and Yirmiya's com- mentary on statements by contemporaries and predecessors, further illus- trate my claim that the Talmud very likely supplies accurate information about individual rabbis. Once again, however, we will be disappointed if we approach the sources expecting absolute proof. Yirmiya, it is important to bear in mind, is a third-generation amora who began his career in Babylonia and eventually moved to Palestine. With rare exceptions, Yirmiya's commentary reflects hostility toward contempor- ary and near-contemporary Babylonian amoraim. For example, comment- ing on statements by Rav Sheshet,59 Rabbah,60 and Rav Nahman,6' Yirmiya derides the "stupid Babylonians" who make "obscure statements" because they live in a dark land. I can discern no qualitative difference between state- ments by the "stupid Babylonians" and statements by another Babylonian, Rav Yosef, which Yirmiya far more respectfully opposes,62 supporting my contention that the tone of Yirmiya's commentary is fueled by reaction not only to the substance of the statements but also to the authors themselves. Yirmiya's Babylonian contemporaries and near-contemporaries re- spond to Yirmiya with comparable sentiments. Abaye once refuses to accept an opinion reported to him in Yirmiya's name, but accepts the same opinion reported to him later on in the name of R. Yohanan.63 Abaye remarks that "if I had been worthy, I would have learned the tradition in the first place," although his exact meaning is not clear. Perhaps he faults himself for his ini- tial refusal, and argues against the introduction of issues of personality into halachic matters. Alternatively, perhaps he reasons as follows: The state- ment was first reported to him in the name of an unacceptable authority, causing him to post one memorization of a correct opinion. Evidently, rea- sons Abaye, he was lacking in merit to begin with, and the heavenly powers hindered his learning. In any event, this passage attests to contemporary 59. Pesahim 34b. 60. Yoma 57a and Menahot 52a. The printed editions read Rava in both places, but Rabbah is preferable chronologically. 61. Bekhorot 25b. See also Zevahim 60b.

Shabbat 21b.</page><page sequence="25">TALMUDIC PORTRAYALS OF AMORAIC RELATIONSHIPS 189 animosity toward Yirmiya missing from later commentary on his state- ments. Along these same lines, Rava uses Yirmiya as illustration of his point that Babylonian scholars are superior to Palestinian. While in Babylonia, claims Rava, Yirmiya failed to understand rabbinic discourse, but upon moving to Palestine he became an esteemed scholar who ridicules his Baby- lonian superiors. Rava argues that the standards are lower in Palestine, allowing a scholar of Yirmiya's caliber to rise above his contemporaries and ridicule his Babylonian superiors with impunity. Elsewhere, Rava displays knowledge of, and discomfort with, one of Yirmiya's insulting references to the "stupid Babylonians." Rava rejects an argument advanced by his subor- dinate, Rav Papa, remarking that "up until now they have called us stupid, now they will call us the stupid among the stupid."64 Rava accepts the logic of Yirmiya's argument, but is stung by his criticism of Babylonian scho- lars.65 The situation changes dramatically when we turn to commentary on statements by Yirmiya by amoraim who postdate him by a single generation or more. In contrast to Yirmiya's relationships with contemporaries, we find no hint of hostility toward Yirmiya in later amoraic commentary on his statements. Abaye and Rava, therefore, express strong negative feelings toward Yir- miya, which Yirmiya in turn expresses toward third-generation Babylonian contemporaries. Yirmiya's attitudes are expressed in stereotypical fashion, and have very likely gone through a process of editorial standardization, but I see no reason to deny that the Talmud accurately preserves the basic tenor of Yirmiya's attitudes toward Babylonian scholars and Babylonian reaction to Yirmiya. As noted above, however, were we to have a more complete record of amoraic attitudes toward Yirmiya, we might discover different versions of his relationships with contemporary Babylonians. Perhaps, therefore, the Talmud does not provide direct access to Yirmiya's relation- ships with contemporaries and near-contemporaries, but to the next genera- tion's conception of what these relationships were. 64.

For another disapproving remark by a Babylonian rabbi directed at Yirmiya, see Rav Aha bar Yaakov's comment on Niddah 23a.</page><page sequence="26">190 RICHARD KALMIN Implications for Study of the Talmud's Anonymous Commentary In the following discussion, I argue that commentary by the Talmud's anonymous editors is clearly distinguishable from commentary by amoraim, particularly contemporary amoraim. First, anonymous commentary, unlike commentary by amoraim (both contemporary and noncontemporary), occasionally neutralizes the criticisms of rabbis contained in their sources and makes peace between sages when the sources portray conflict.66 Amoraim, both contemporary and noncontemporary, do not display the same tendency to reduce conflict and neutralize criticism. Second, anony- mous commentary, unlike commentary by contemporary amoraim, is com- pletely devoid of criticism of sages and is concerned much more with the substance of a statement than with the statement's author. The first characteristic mentioned above, it bears emphasizing, distin- guishes anonymous commentary from commentary by all amoraim, both contemporary and noncontemporary. The second characteristic distin- guishes anonymous commentary from contemporary amoraic commentary, but not from commentary by noncontemporary amoraim. Because the Talmud's editorial commentary is anonymous, it is fre- quently difficult to differentiate between the anonymous commentary and the amoraic sources on which it is based. Often it is only through complicat- ed critical analysis of a sugya that the seams separating the editors from the amoraim become visible. The methods used in this study to distinguish be- tween anonymous commentators and attributed sources were developed, and continue to be developed, by David Halivni, Shamma Friedman, and others,67 and these methods have found wide, but not universal, acceptance in modern talmudic scholarship. The present study, therefore, which uses Friedman's and Halivni's methods and discovers significant distinctions between amoraic and anonymous literature, provides significant confirma- tion of the theoretical framework devised by these scholars for subdividing the talmudic corpus. In the final analysis, the results obtained through 66. The anonymous editors only infrequently remove insults against earlier rabbis (see below). For the most part, they leave the offending passages untouched. Perhaps systematic study would reveal patterns to the editors' decisions to comment on certain sources and to ignore others, but I have not been able to discern any as yet. 67. See above, and see Kalmin, Redaction of the Babylonian Talmud, pp. 1-11 and 151-159, where I discuss earlier scholarship on the question.</page><page sequence="27">TALMUDIC PORTRAYALS OF AMORAIC RELATIONSHIPS 191 application of a theory represent the most effective test of the validity of that theory, and the results of the present study indicate that the methods of these scholars contribute to our understanding of the various components of talmudic literature. It will be helpful to give a brief example of the editors' tendency to make peace where the sources portray conflict. In one context, Rav's refusal to enter a building ahead of Shmuel68 is explained by the editors as an attempt on Rayv's part to make amends for his earlier curse of Shmuel, which consist- ed of a successful prayer for the death of Shmuel's male children.69 Ray and Shmuel are not bitter enemies, the editors would have us believe. Perhaps they began as such, but were eventually reconciled, and now Ray wishes to appease his colleague by showing him special respect. The editors' habit of giving both sides of an issue, of supplying the rea- soning behind even rejected views, is perhaps further manifestation of their tendency to guide earlier portrayals of sages toward the same positive con- clusion. The editors, in contrast to amoraim, often (but by no means always) avoid refutation of earlier views, even those of Bet Shammai, whose opin- ions are virtually never accepted as law. They struggle to show the logic of R. Eliezer's view, even though the final ruling almost always goes against him, perhaps further manifestation of their desire to protect the reputations of the greats of the past. One other case is relevant in the present context,70 further illustrating my point that anonymous editorial commentary is clearly distinguishable from amoraic commentary. According to one narrative, the patriarch, R. Yehuda ha-Nasi, grants full rabbinic authority to Rabbah bar Hana, permitting him to judge, to issue practical halachic decisions, and to determine the ritual status of firstborn animals. Ray, however, is granted the former two prerog- atives but denied the third, raising the possibility that Yehuda ha-Nasi con- siders Rabbah bar Hana to be the superior sage, in contrast to the dominant talmudic conception, which views Ray as superior." The anonymous editors, very likely with this problem in mind, ask why Ray and Rabbah bar Hana are treated differently by the patriarch. The edi- tors answer by quoting Rayv's own testimony that he was expert in the laws 68. Baba Kamma 80a-b. 69. Shabbat 108a. 70. See also the Appendix, below. 71. Sanhedrin 5a-b.</page><page sequence="28">192 RICHARD KALMIN of firstborn animals, and argue that Yehuda ha-Nasi was concerned lest Rav's decisions in these matters not be fully comprehended. Rav's very expertise was potentially a source of danger, for others less knowledgeable might observe him and arrive at misunderstandings about the law. Alternatively, the editors suggest, Yehuda ha-Nasi grants fewer preroga- tives to Rav because he wishes to honor Rabbah bar Hana. The patriarch wishes to bolster Rabbah bar Hana in the eyes of Babylonian Jews, who might otherwise not be inclined to respect him. Rav, however, will win the people's respect on his own merits, and needs no help from the pat- riarchate.72 As noted above, the anonymous editors are very likely attempting to resolve the discrepancy between this story's conception of the relative merits of Rav and Rabbah bar Hana and the Talmud's dominant conception. The editors are also motivated by a desire to create harmony where the sources portray conflict, which leads to their refusal to acknowledge the patriarch's actions in limiting Rav's authority as evidence of a lack of complete favor toward Rav, or as a shrewd attempt on the part of a skilled politician to maintain control over an individual he perceives as a potential threat, both of which are plausible interpretations of the story.73 Instead, argue the edi- tors, the patriarch acted out of a desire to see that the law was properly observed and the sages properly respected. Perhaps my findings have implications for dating the Talmud's anony- mous commentary. Many scholars believe that this commentary was com- posed late in the talmudic period, but as I argue in a recent study, the case can hardly be considered closed.74 Perhaps my current findings shed light on this difficult problem, which has perplexed scholars for generations. Per- haps the distinctions between amoraic and anonymous editorial commen- tary prove that the amoraim and the anonymous editors cannot be the same people and therefore date from different time periods. Or that they operated 72. In explaining the editors' alternative response, I have accepted the interpretation of Rashi and Yad Rama. These commentators read quite a lot into the editors' brief remark, but I have no fully satisfactory alternative to suggest. In any case, the editors' first response supports my contention here. For manuscript variants of this story, see Rosenthal, "Rav Ben-Ahi R. Hiyya Gam Ben- Ahoto?" pp. 289-307. The sections of the story which Rosenthal identifies as late additions have not been included in my description of the narrative. 73. See also Ephraim Urbach.

The distinctions between editorial and amoraic commentary, however, might derive from the different roles these commentaries play in the sugya and tell us nothing about who authored them or when they were composed. Amoraim who polemicize against contemporaries and near-contemporaries are perhaps completely even-handed when commenting, as editors, on statements by the same individuals. Perhaps as named amoraim they insult and criticize, and express their dislikes and ambivalences, while as anony- mous editors they refuse to do so, and struggle to make the sages seem uni- formly righteous and their arguments uniformly reasonable. To use an imperfect modern analogy, an author who signs his name to an article in a journal might be free to express negative opinions regarding a particular public figure. The editors of the same publication, however, might struggle to maintain neutrality, for example by soliciting contributions from authors representing opposing points of view. The same individual, in fact, in the same publication, might express himself one way as an author and another way as an anonymous editor, an advocate on the one hand and a disinterested observer on the other. To be sure, the different roles of editors and authors can express themselves in a variety of ways in the modern and ancient worlds. My point is simply that the distinction suggested above be- tween editors and amoraim is a reasonable one, and not an arbitrary inven- tion on my part. The findings of the present study, therefore, reveal a contrast between the treatment of rabbinic personalities in anonymous editorial and amoraic commentary, but provide no clear answer to the problem of the chronologi- cal relationship between these two commentaries or the identity of their authors. Nothing about anonymous editorial commentary definitively dis- qualifies the anonymous editors as authors of hostile amoraic accounts. The amoraim and the anonymous editors might have been the same people, and amoraic and anonymous statements might be so different because of the dif- fering functions they played in the sugya. Summary and Conclusions This study argues that contemporary and noncontemporary amoraic commentary are qualitatively different. Amoraim occasionally express hos- tility or ambivalence in their explicit commentary on statements by contem-</page><page sequence="30">194 RICHARD KALMIN porary amoraim, but respond to earlier rabbis with neutrality, as disem- bodied authors of authoritative texts. Later amoraim may criticize state- ments and opinions, but not personalities. Criticisms by contemporaries, in contrast, are far more prevalent, and are occasionally fueled by hostility or ambivalence toward the author of a statement, and are not merely momen- tary expressions of anger in response to specific statements. Contemporary amoraim occasionally express the view that a rabbi is fundamentally flawed or inadequate, in contrast to rabbis separated from one another by more than a generation, who never express such sentiments. Later amoraim, therefore, are unlikely to have invented commentary or dialogues in which contemporary rabbis criticize one another, provided that the criticism can be removed without detracting from the substance of the argument. Later amoraim are unlikely authors of hostile or ambivalent stories, provided that the portrayals of earlier rabbis are not totally subser- vient to some moral lesson, theological truth, or abstract principle. Only contemporaries and near-contemporaries emerge as likely candidates for authorship of such stories, dialogues, and commentary, since only they reveal hostile or ambivalent attitudes toward rabbis in their explicit com- mentary on their statements. The patterns described above, furthermore, are most likely the result of genuine generational contrast and are not the planned creation of a single author or an editorial committee. The differences between contemporary and noncontemporary reactions to the personalities of rabbis most likely attest to the character of rabbinic relationships and attitudes throughout the amoraic period and are not testimony to the creativity of a later editor. As a result of my findings, we can describe with greater confidence rab- binic attitudes toward contemporaries and near-contemporaries. In several instances, in fact, there seemed little reason to deny that the sources preserve accurate information about specific individuals and not merely about gener- ations or periods, although absolute certainty on this issue was beyond our grasp. Commentary by the Talmud's anonymous editors was also shown to be distinguishable from commentary by amoraim, since only anonymous com- mentary is characterized by attempts to neutralize criticism of rabbis and to make peace where the sources portray conflict. This distinction supported the claims of Halivni, Friedman, and others that the anonymous and attri- buted sections of the Talmud are detachable from one another according to</page><page sequence="31">TALMUDIC PORTRAYALS OF AMORAIC RELATIONSHIPS 195 objective criteria, and that comprehension of the sugya is facilitated by accurate description of the distinct contributions of the anonymous editors and the amoraim. These findings, however, did not permit firm conclusions to be drawn regarding the dating of the Talmud's anonymous commentary. The conclusions of this study, finally, increase the likelihood that talmu- dic sources other than those which conform to the criteria described above originate close to the time of the individuals quoted or described. Other sources accurately preserve the opinions (if not the actual words) and deeds of tannaim and amoraim, or at least the next generation's conceptions of what those opinions and deeds were. New techniques need to be developed to improve our ability to identify which sources are late fabrications and which are authentically amoraic, since the findings of the present study are applicable only in situations where negative or ambivalent sentiments are expressed. Perhaps the most important contribution of this study is the demonstration that the effort is worth making, that the sources are very like- ly susceptible to this kind of inquiry, and that if the proper methodologies can be developed, the rewards are likely to be substantial. Appendix: Anonymous Editorial Commentary Based on Amoraic Statements As noted above, the Talmud's anonymous editors never criticize sages. In the following discussion, a small number of passages which at first glance appear to challenge this claim are shown not to constitute exceptions to the general pattern. A comment based on a statement by Rav Yosef could perhaps be con- strued as editorial criticism of an earlier rabbi, but more likely is the contin- uation of a dialogue between two amoraim. The comment comes at the con- clusion of a story which recounts Rav Safra's and Rava's opposing halachic actions in the house of Mar Yuhna.75 Safra hears a disturbing biblical verse in a dream, which he fears is a sign of heavenly disapproval of his contradic- tion of Yosef. Yosef assures him that he has no cause for worry, implying that Rava acted contrary to Yosef. Safra or the anonymous editors ask why he heard this disturbing verse, and Yosef or the editors respond that it was 75. Hullin 133a.</page><page sequence="32">196 RICHARD KALMIN actually intended for Rava. Why, then, was it not sent to Rava, Safra or the editors ask, to which Yosef or the editors respond that Rava was in disfavor, literally, "rebuked," and the heavenly powers refrained from direct com- munication with him. As noted above, it is unclear at first glance who speaks after Yosef assures Safra that he has committed no offense. Do Yosef and Safra contin- ue their dialogue, or have the anonymous editors intervened?76 Most likely, the conclusion of the story is the continuation of the dia- logue between Yosef and Safra. It is consistent with Yosef's disapproval of Rava in several other contexts and does not work as well as an addition by the anonymous editors, who elsewhere refrain from explicit criticism of ear- lier rabbis. This sugya, therefore, presents no challenge to the claim that anonymous editors never criticize earlier rabbis. Yosef and Safra, and not the editors, conclude the discussion, and Yosef's critical attitude toward Rava is consis- tent with his attitude in several other contexts. We also find no clear evidence of hostility toward R. Yirmiya or Rav Ashi77 in anonymous editorial commentary on their statements. The editors twice inform us that a certain tradition "escaped Yirmiya,"78 and once bluntly reject his view with the words "And it isn't so."" Both expressions are standard phrases used in connection with statements by numerous other amoraim, however, and there is no proof that they imply hostility or disap- proval of the person whose opinion is being rejected. In seven instances, Ashi's opinions are rejected by the anonymous editors with the expression beruta hi or beduta hi.8o The exact significance of this expression is not clear, but it apparently means "outside, rejected, unofficial," or "false, forged, fic- 76. The absence of the term "he said," indicating amoraic dialogue, does not decide the issue. See the discussion above. 77. In addition to the sources cited below, see Baba Mezia 104b and Hullin 56b, where Ashi's opinions are rejected by the anonymous editors with the words "And it isn't so," and see the discussion above. 78.

According to these versions, the anonymous editors add to the criticism of Rami by injecting an element of negligence not explicitly present in Rava's statement. The majority of versions, which contain no explicit criticism of Rami, are most likely correct. See Dikdukei Soferim, nn. lamed and following.</page></plain_text>
