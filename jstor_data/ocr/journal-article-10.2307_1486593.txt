<plain_text><page sequence="1">Maurice Friedman. Encounter on the Narrow Ridge: The Life of Martin Buber New York: Paragon House, 1991. 496 pp. Maurice Friedman offers more than a condensation of his three-volume Martin Buber's Life and Work in this evocation of Martin Buber's personality and thinking. In one of the additions to that early work, Friedman cites Naemah Beer-Hoffman's recollection that Buber told her, "You will hear again that one should venerate me. No, one must love me" (p. 449). This work succeeds in arousing such love. Scholars will certainly still turn to Martin Buber's Life and Work, with its copious notes, technical discussions, and dialogical format. Some readers will, naturally, lament that many of the direct citations in the earlier book have necessarily become third-person descriptions in this book, but several virtues recommend this later version.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 321 Not only does Friedman augment his original material, but he does so judiciously. Where the earlier book has a brief note on an eye operation that kept Buber from going abroad in 1964, this volume precedes it with an anecdote of how Ruth Warshaw read Buber's I and Thou aloud to a totally blind woman and found that "reading Buber in this way reveals the deeper layers." This juxtaposition of story and biography enriches the reader by its symbolic association of images (see pp. 444-445 and Life and Work 3:402). Perhaps, as an academic, I have always sympathized with Buber's response to hearing that Hermann Cohen presented a somewhat tragic picture: "What do you expect? The man was for forty years a professor!" In the present volume, Friedman deepens the pathos by including the memories of several of Buber's younger students. The paradox of Buber, whose personal and teaching style often left students bored or hurt but who also could draw them to him by a charisma of character, emerges from the statements Friedman brings from Benjamin Uffenheimer, Aliza Ziv Or, Yonina Talmon, and Joseph Ben Dov. The latter's description of Buber as "a Polish nobleman" illuminates not only Buber's self-presentation but also the mentality of the Israeli students whom he taught (pp. 249-250; cf. Life and Work 2:286). Sometimes the new material humanizes a description in a remarkable way. In the second volume of Life and Work (pp. 50-51), Friedman discusses Hugo Bergmann's philosophical dialogue with Buber to link a section devoted to Jewish-Christian dialogue with one devoted to philosophy and psychology. In the present volume two vignettes on Buber's relationship to the Land of Israel serve the same purpose and make Buber the person even more accessible (pp. 293-294). A short notice on Buber's willingness to abide by the halakhic standards of his hosts, the Jewish Theological Seminary (p. 340; Life and Work 3:148), is expanded to include Michael Wyschogrod's description of the event and his conclusion that Buber as a person "was often greater than his books" (pp. 333-334). Buber's trip to America impressed upon him "the paradoxical unity of what are usually considered irreconcilable opposites." This is discussed in Life and Work (3:158) in philosophical detail with reference to Nicholas of Cusa. The same idea is conveyed more directly and personally here in a letter to Hermann Hess: "I have learned to know the human in a new way--in its contradictory nature" (p. 343). Sometimes Friedman creates a new impression by using his original material in a surprising way. In Life and Work (3:336) he notes, during</page><page sequence="3">322 BOOK REVIEWS a chapter focused on Buber's conflict with David Ben-Gurion, how Buber comforted his daughter Eva on the death of her husband. Here the same selection is used effectively as the conclusion to chapter 15, the final chapter in part III (p. 303). The chapter devoted to the Ben-Gurion conflict, chapter 21, shows the same careful augmentation as earlier chapters. Friedman notes the assessment of Michael Keren that the Israeli political messianism that flourished in the 1950s drew on the "depth and meaning Buber's philosophy gave to messianic thinking." He then appends an anecdote describing how Buber argued against legislation for expropriation of Arab land (pp. 421-422). The contrast beween the effect of Buber's philosophy and his political concerns leads well into a description of Buber's self-understanding of his position in Israel (p. 422; Life and Work 3:337). Friedman tells how Raphael Rosenzweig, when still a young child, acted as the first audience for the translation of the Hebrew Bible on which his father and Buber collaborated. Buber once noted that Hans Kohn, who was writing his biography, had unearthed material about him of which even he had been unaware. He rejoiced, however, that much still remained unknown. When Franz Rosenzweig replied by exclaiming, "Rumpelstiltskin!" Raphael chanted, "Ah, how good that no one knows . . . that I have translated the Bible." When informed that everyone did know just that fact, Raphael amended his statement to "that I have made so many beautiful things" (p. 168; Life and Work 2:58). Despite the overwhelming information and deeply stirring writing in Friedman's three-volume corpus, Buber could still rejoice that so many of his beautiful things remained unknown. Rereading some of the same material in the different format of the new work, brings out the beauty often missed in the necessarily fragmented reading of the larger-scale version. Anecdotes about Buber's approach to halakhah come together here to form a meaningful whole. When read from cover to cover, a more possible task than with the three-volume set, Buber's love for and responsiveness to the halakhah, despite his personal and individualistic expression of it, comes through clearly. Ernst Simon tells how Buber refused to wear a skullcap when eating with Rabbi Nehemiah Nobel because "I will not grab hold of the small end of the Halachot in this way" (p. 162; Life and Work 2:40-41). Friedman records how Buber confessed that "there have been days when I felt myself compelled to enter into the prayer of a community, and so I did it" (p. 348; Life and Work 3:191). These two stories complement each other and focus attention on the authenticity that Buber stressed, not on "religious</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 323 anarchy." In Friedman's original work they are not only in two different volumes but separated by over 500 pages. The present work enables a better grasp of Buber's personality by making an association of the two stories more feasible. The book, however, does not reveal all. Its combination of new and old material conceals while it reveals. Buber need not fear that he has been stripped naked. An anecdote in the earlier work (3:407) describes how a nun ministering to Buber was shocked at his fear of death. The new book augments this by suggesting that the fear was physiological and not psychological, and that Buber's bedtime prayer (echoing that of the liturgy) "Into your hand I commit my spirit" suggests his continuing trust. The ambivalence of Buber's fear of dying combined with his evident reliance on the divine raises questions. Readers cannot help but finish the book knowing that they have much more to learn and that Buber has more to teach them. This extraordinary volume functions well as an introduction to the complexities of Buber the person and the ideas he exemplified. S.
