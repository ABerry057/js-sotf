Hoboken: Ktav, 1990. 204 pp. Completed as a Ph.D. dissertation at New York University in the mid-1970s, Hasidic Responses to the Holocaust offers a noticeably different view of the challenges confronting the traditional Jew during the Shoah, and</page><page sequence="2">360 BOOK REVIEWS some of their possible solutions. Although others have written on oral and literary responses to Jewish martyrdom and suffering (e.g., Y. Eliach, A. Mintz, D. Roskies) or have authored responsa on the Shoah, Pesach Schin- dler seeks out the Hasidic response: how aspects of classic Hasidic thought permeated the life and thought of the Hasidim of the Belz, Bratslav, Ger, Lubavitch, and other dynasties during the European IHurban. Each chapter examines the effects of a specific problem resulting from the kabbalistic/ Hasidic Urglaube regarding the symbiotic interaction of God and man, in which the actions of etaruta deletata (the Lower World) have an impact on etaruta dele 'ela (the Upper World): the problem of evil and suffering; pun- ishment and exile, redeemed by chastisement and redemption; Qiddush HaShem and Qiddush Hal.ayim (Sanctification of the Name in death and life); cofraternal roles of the Zadik and Hasid; and the realized tension be- tween the activist and quietist schools of Hasidic response to the trauma of di milbomeh yohrn. The full range of Hasidic butzpah and 'ahavat yira'el (respectively, cour- age bordering on the reckless and love of the Jewish people) is explored by Schindler, a leader of worldwide Conservative Judaism and an instructor in rabbinics at the Hebrew University and at the University of Toronto's Jeru- salem branch. His compelling account of the single-mindedness of most Hasidim, who defiantly opposed Nazi evil decrees but, in the end, accepted joyously the divine decree, not only demonstrates mastery of the secondary sources but gives evidence of original insight in dealing with primary sources (most of which are inaccessible to the nonspecialist). Among Schindler's findings: for the Hasidim, God's presence in history was not diminished by the Shoah, though His justice, compassion, good- ness, and kindness appeared hidden due to man's finite knowledge; suffering and personal sacrifice (mesirat nefesh) were sustained on the strength of faith in the covenantal interrelationship between God and Israel and trust in His ultimate defeat of evil; the phenomenon of redemption was architectonic- rebuke, destruction, exile, and redemption; thwarting the Nazi evil, in the context related to Zadik and Hasid, did not obliterate its reality, but dimin- ished its power by virtue of a cosmic or mythic perspective; the Rebbe played an altruistic role as a source of hit hazqut (encouragement) during the terrible trauma; and finally, the Hasidic victims of the Ijurban engaged in multiple acts of sanctifying God's Name not by martyrdom but by obliga- tory and voluntary acts of holiness in the service of God and man. If Elie Wiesel is correct that the Shoah transcends history and that the living are neither capable nor worthy of recovering its mystery, then</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 361 responses to the Shoah say more about the fears and concerns of the respon- dents than about the agenda for Judeocide. Wiesel himself relates witness- stories promoting Jewish survival as an unshakable dogma after Auschwitz. The theocentric religious philosophies of Emil Fackenheim and Irving Greenberg talk respectfully of an obligatory 614th Commandment (no posthumous victory for Hitler) and of a Voluntary Covenant, which together represent a mending of the (Jewish) world. Richard Rubenstein proclaims a letting-go of traditional Judaism's doctrine of God for a new symbol of God's reality conducive to the lessons learned from Auschwitz. But Hasidism maintains classical Orthodox belief rooted in spontaneous religious experience. How then did Hasidic leaders and followers respond to the Shoah? The kaleidoscope of information in Hasidic Responses to the Holocaust is about the nature of empathy, about how faith and halakhah prepared a grief-stricken community for a life of woe and calamity, and more generally, it is a book that places the Shoah in a kabbalistic frame in order to show that Hasidim responded to the Endloisung in accordance with meaningful, clearly defined Hasidic tenets. Take, for example, the relationship of Zadikim to their Hasidim. In a time of gathering insanity, this cadre of pious Rebbeim collectively acted as a kind of sponge for misery, absorbing pain and cruelty before it spilled out and overcame everything. By insisting that sanity could be restored in the world only after the natural order of things was put back into sync by some established ceremony or rite (e.g., fraternal meal, niggun-laden prayers, strict adherence to holy time and space, rites of passage, etc.), the Zaddik played a major role in diminishing despair (ye'ush), which in turn enabled the Hasid to cope better in extreme crises. In an existentialist way, Zadik and Hasid believed that their actions transcended ordinary events laced with danger (e.g., survival at the expense of abuse of one's fellow) and helped to rediscover dignity and self-respect, necessary ingredients for the total salva- tion of Israel and the world. Hasidic Responses to the Holocaust is a helpful and important book. It addresses the victimization and responses of Hasidim as living history and theology. But the book's admirable accomplishment reveals a weakness: the pedantic dissertation style of the original, with source material presented in encyclopedic fashion and often bunched together with little narrative-in addition, measle-like Hebrew terms on almost every page-makes for an exhausting read. Furthermore, there is a misplaced reference ("mikveh" on p. 1 18), lacunae (e.g., the aliyah of the Zwehille Rebbe, Reb Shloimke, from</page><page sequence="4">362 BOOK REVIEWS Central Volhynia in the Ukraine, and his counsel from Eretz Israel), and multiple spellings ("Hasidim" and "Hassidim"). Nevertheless, it deals with a neglected aspect of Shoah studies and offers arresting suggestions, e.g., that the Shoah was not seen by many Hasidic masters as a retribution for the sins of the Jewish people, and that passive submission, though ubiqui- tous, was notably rejected by some Zadikim as an irresponsible and incomprehensible weapon of spirit. Though much of Hasidic pietism may be radically at odds with contemporary academic standards and sensibilities, we should be grateful to Schindler, who documents an alternative response to Jewish martyrdom and blessedness.
