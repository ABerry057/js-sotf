Berkeley: University of California Press, 1989. xi, 226 pp. Scholars love anniversaries, and none promises a greater profusion of celebrations than those linked to Spain and 1992. Not only will linguists mark the 500th anniversary of the publication of Nebrija's grammar, the first in any European language, but various parties will press their paternal claims to Columbus: Italians will hail him as their native son, Spaniards as their adopted son, and Jews as an erstwhile son of the covenant. The third major event to be observed in 1992 is, of course, the anniversary of the expulsion of the Jews from Spain. Celebration will often take the form of commemoration, since the expulsion of thousands of Jews from their ances- tral homeland can hardly bespeak festivity. As museums, libraries, govern- mental agencies, and academics prepare to mark this happening, it is appro- priate to recall that the commemoration of the expulsion from Spain of one Jewish community is six years premature. Navarrese Jewry has often remained in the shadows of research devoted to Iberian Jewry, while the Castilian and Aragonese communities have basked in the academic limelight. The size, prestige, and abundant docu- mentation of the latter Jewries undoubtedly justify this emphasis, but much is to be learned from an examination of the neglected Pyrenean community. Gampel divides his study into two roughly equal parts. In the first he sets the stage for his subsequent analysis by providing a carefully documented survey of everyday life in Jewish Navarre, focusing on population and economy, as well as on communal structures and activities. Gampel has breathed new life into moribund tax registers and notarial documents to produce a strikingly clear picture of Navarrese Jewry from 1479, the year of Juan II's death and the beginning of Navarre's brief period of independence, until the formal disappearance of Navarrese Jewry in 1498. Gampel approaches demographics, that bugaboo of historians, with justifiable caution, underscoring the incompleteness of the documents on this question. He nonetheless advances the figure of 3,550 taxpaying Navar- rese Jews, or some 3.5 percent of the general Navarrese population in 1495, a figure that doubtless includes the influx of exiled Castilian and Aragonese Jews. Gampel then attempts the heroic feat of demonstrating how the Jewish population-nearly 600 Jews are mentioned in the docu- ments he studies-was woven into the economic fabric of Navarrese society.</page><page sequence="2">250 BOOK REVIEWS Most Jews appear to have been involved in clothing manufacture and trade, but there were also significant numbers in medicine, animal husbandry, tax- farming, artisanry, and agriculture, especially viticulture. Navarrese Jewry's economic activities evidently were well integrated into those of the general society, while, at the same time, Jewish communal organizations dealt effec- tively with internal concerns. In the second half of his study, Gampel moves from the specifics of Navarrese Jewry to the broader issues of cristianos nuevos, the Inquisition, and Castilian and Aragonese exiles in Navarre. Although Navarrese con- versos did not fall under the jurisdiction of the Spanish Inquisition until 1513, it is clear that the Inquisition in adjacent Castile and Aragon made itself felt in Navarre, especially in Tudela, during the 1480s. The Inquisition, for example, launched investigations and prosecuted suspects in Navarre from outside the kingdom. As a result of Ferdinand and Isabella's edict of expulsion, proclaimed on 31 March 1492, professing Jews were obliged to leave Castile and Aragon, causing many to flee to Portugal and North Africa, while others sought refuge in Navarre. Although it might be assumed that exiled Jews would view Navarre as a temporary stop, the evidence adduced by Gampel indi- cates that some Jews intended to remain there permanently. These 6migr6s, however, were considered legally and economically distinct from the in- digenous Jewish population, and Gampel documents the resultant inter- necine tensions between foranos and nativos. The concluding chapter details the final years of the nearly 600-year-old Navarrese Jewish community. Gampel confronts a question often posed from the secure vantage of hindsight: How could Navarrese Jewry have been oblivious to the impending calamity, especially in light of the events of 1492? Some Jews, such as Yosef ha-Kohen's family, perhaps did indeed foresee disaster, and for that reason only temporarily resided in Navarre after being expelled from Aragon. The majority of Navarrese Jews, however, clearly did not anticipate imminent catastrophe. After all, their active participation in Navarrese society, together with the stability promised by the reign of Johan and Catalina, and the absence of anti-Jewish legislation in 1497 signaled an ostensibly peaceful era. These indications, however, proved to be illusory, as Ferdinand and Isabella sought to extend their influence over Navarre. The expulsion edict promulgated early in 1498 confronted Navarrese Jewry with the age-old dilemma of exile or conversion. Although a small number of Jews escaped, the vast majority converted to Christianity.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 251 Gampel recounts the history of the last twenty years of Navarrese Jewry with an admirable fusion of objectivity and passion. The result is that for the first time we have a reliable and engaging account of this critical chapter in the history of medieval Spain. Dwayne E.
