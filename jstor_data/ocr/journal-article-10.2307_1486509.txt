New York: New York University Press, 1992. xiv, 326 pp. Being a major and veteran factor in the Middle East, Egypt has attracted the attention of numerous scholars of diverse interest and disciplines. In a way, this scholarship reflects changing perspectives, foci of interest, and the availability of sources. Due to Egypt's overall importance, coupled with the great interest in minorities and Arab-Israeli relations, a growing number of studies deal with Egypt's Jews. Michael Laskier surveys here political, social, and economic developments among the Jews of Egypt between 1920-1970. The study contains an introduction, eight chapters, and a conclusion-all annotated-followed by a bibliography and index. It is based on diverse sources of information (much of which hitherto unused by historians), including archival material, Egyptian-Jewish and</page><page sequence="2">246 BOOK REVIEWS non-Jewish-periodicals, and interviews. Laskier sees as his contribution to the study of Egypt's Jews the examination of the relations between them and Israel's Jews, their reactions to anti-Semitism and Egyptian nationalism, and extending the period under review to 1970. He also sets out to compare the situation of Egyptian Jews with that of other Jewish communities in the Mediterranean basin. In his introduction, Laskier states some common features regarding Egyptian and Maghrebi Jews and provides background information of the former. The first chapter deals with the Jews of Egypt and the Yishuv during 1920-1939. It focuses on the pro-Zionist press in Egypt-mainly Isra'l (which appeared in French, Hebrew, and Arabic editions)-summarizing articles on Zionism, the Yishuv, and Jewish solidarity in general, written primarily by Albert D. Mosseri, the editor, and Joseph D. Mosseri. It is hard to tell, though, how widespread these views were: in his concluding remarks, Laskier states that "the enthusiasm among the majority of the Jews for Zionism, never completely genuine, waned after the early 1920s" (p. 298). It would be of interest to hear more about the issues which sparked the articles and about the persons involved, followed by a critical examination of the views expressed and the accuracy of the information. Next comes a description of the reactions of Zionists and non-Zionists to anti-Semitism in Europe and the Middle East during 1933-1938. Based mainly on articles in Israe'l, Laskier describes Jewish organizations established in Egypt to fight anti-Semitism, emphasizing the short-lived boycott against German-made goods and a libel case (in which the Jews lost). It would be interesting to know more how these and similar cases were reflected in Egyptian and German sources. The third chapter deals with the political and social conditions of Egypt's Jewry during World War II, including the November 1945 riots on the anniversary of the Balfour Declaration. Next comes a description of the efforts of the Yishuv's emissaries to promote Zionist causes and Aliya during 1942-1948. Whereas in the past much of the Zionist activity rested on articles published in Israol, the 1940s witnessed the growth of Zionist activity, especially within pioneering youth movements which aimed at "productivization" and Aliya, and to a large extent were spurred by emissaries from Palestine. Much data on these organizations and operations are provided, putting them within the framework of world Zionist institutions. The fifth chapter deals with the political situation of the Jews of Egypt from the 1948 Palestine War to the 1952 Egyptian Revolution. The data include the names-but very little</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 247 else--of some seventy Jewish individuals and companies who were subject to sequestration following the outbreak of the war. In addition, details are given on the internment of Jews during the war and on the Israeli-directed undergound Zionist activity, including the work of the Jewish Agency's Department for Middle East Jewry. This is followed by a description of Aliya efforts during 1948-1952. Great emphasis is given to the role of the local underground Aliya apparatus and its connections with the Mosad la-'Aliya (the Israeli institution which supervised Aliya operations), including some disturbing issues, such as intra-organizational conflicts in Egypt and in Israel, and their implications on Zionist activity and Aliya. There is no mention, either here or later, of Mivtza' Tushiya during the 1956 Sinai Campaign, in which Israeli operators (Aryeh Lovah Eliav and Avraham Dar), in collaboration with the French, rescued some seventy Jews from Port Said to Israel (details were often published by Eliav, including in his memoirs Tab'ot 'Edut, 1983). The seventh chapter deals with the early years of the revolutionary regime in Egypt, focusing on the "Mishap" of 1954. The latter refers to the failed sabotage operations of an Israeli-operated Jewish underground in Cairo and Alexandria, which was originally trained for intelligence work. In addition to Israeli publications, Laskier uses Egyptian sources, including the press, extensive translations of which are included, detailing the trial of the ring members. One would benefit from a comparison between the Israeli version for the reasons for the exposure of the network with that of Avri Elad Seidenberg (Decline of Honor, published in 1976, in both Hebrew and English), who was suspected to have been a double-agent who caused the downfall of the ring. The last chapter deals with the period from the Sinai Campaign to the death of Nasser in September 1970. Details are given on police detention and sequestration during the 1956 War, followed by expulsions and a new statue depriving the Jews of Egyptian citizenship. The efforts during the later period by the American Joint Distribution Committee and the International Red Cross to help the dwindling community are described. The short comparison between the Jews of Egypt and other communities in the Mediterranean basin (especially Morocco) mentions some interesting similarities and differences, but the reasons behind them and their implications are only touched upon. The book would have benefited from a more carefully constructed index. The main problems are with regad to the presentation of Arabic names (e.g., wrong division of compound names [even resulting in dual presen- tation], listing under title [Bey], and usually alphabetizing by the definite</page><page sequence="4">248 BOOK REVIEWS article) and some name variants of people (Czemowitz/Tzur, Elath/Epstein, Frank/Seidenberg, Sharett/Shertok) and organization (LehilStem Gang) result in double listing, with no cross-references. Laskier diligently has collected a vast amount of diverse sources, many of which have not been hitherto consulted by historians, and has written a very detailed account on the views and activities of Egypt's Jews. This book adds much information on views, positions, and activities of Egyptian Jews within the framework of Egyptian and Middle Eastern politics and the involvement of international organizations.
