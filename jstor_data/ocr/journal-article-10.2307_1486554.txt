<plain_text><page sequence="1">Steven M. Wasserstrom. Between Muslim and Jew: The Problem ofSymbiosis under Early Islam. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1995. viii, 300 pp. The publication of this book heralds the good news that the "science of milal wa-nihal, or comparative religion, as developed by Islam," which, in S. D. Goitein's words,' "is still awaiting a worthy heir" (p. 15), has found one in Steven M. Wasserstrom. Between Muslim and Jew is a magisterial investigation of the concept and dimensions of symbiosis between these two religious traditions in the early Islamic period. It is not a history of the Jews under early Islam, which cannot yet be written because of scarce data, but concerns itself with the concept of symbiosis, a concept in Wasserstrom's view best suited "to comprehend the self-understandings of religions as they operate in synergy with one another" (p. 46). Between Muslim and Jew is divided into three parts, and each part consists of two chapters. Each chapter is a self-contained unit that builds on and contributes significantly to the book's broader thesis, culminating in chapter 6, "Conclusion: Reflections on the History and Philosophy of Symbiosis." In chapter 1 Wasserstrom undertakes to define more clearly the identity of the Jewish communities, beginning in the murky period between 500 and 850 CE and up to and including the tenth century. Gleaning precious information from both Jewish (Genizah) and Muslim sources (early historians, such as al-Waqidi), he sheds considerable light on the professions, both the successful ones and the reviled ones, practiced by Middle Eastern Jewry under the Umayyad and 'Abbasid dynasties. According to Wasserstrom, a considerable number of Jews may have been sufficiently "alienated ... to convert, rebel, and even form new sects" (p. 27) in this period, which "constituted an epochal crisis of mobility for the Jewish community" (ibid.). The combined forms of Jewish leadership, the exilarchate and the gaonate, were caught 1.

Wasserstrom points out that Jewish sources are hardly forthcoming on these subjects, and he proceeds to cull a considerable amount of interesting information about them from the writings of Muslim heresiographers. Chapter 2, a thorough study of "The Jewish Messiahs of Early Is- lam," shows the extent to which Judaism and Islam developed multiple "intertwined Messianic imaginings" as well as their connection with the messianic typologies of late antiquity. Most intriguing and well argued is the intellectual connection of these movements, especially of the 'Isawiyya, with "proto-Shi'i" movements, such as the Mansuriyya. The shared conceptual features of these two movements far exceed the parameters of coincidence and demonstrate the extent to which the 'Isawiyya, which survived into the twelfth century, may well have been "a comparatively long lived Jewish reaction to Islamicization" (p. 89). Chapter 3 explores further the conceptual symbiosis between Judaism and Shi'ism. A number of typologies are investigated, demonstrating the considerable "biblicizing" of Sevener and Twelver Shi'is "in their attitude toward the past" (p. 94). Sunnis were particularly fond of pointing out the virtual identity between certain Shi'i and Jewish doctrines and practices, and drew up lists to this effect (i.e., Ibn Taymiyya's list on pp. 101-103). Jews, in turn, were influenced by several Shi'i (especially Eastern Isma'ili) concepts, especially in Yemen. This complex "sharing of theologies" (p. 135) is fascinating to read and contemplate. In chapter 4 Wasserstrom describes and interprets "the shift on the part of Muslim scholars from a polemical comparative exegesis of foreign scriptures to the critical study of other religions" (p. 136), through the examination of the various forms of allegorical interpretation (ta 'wi) extant among Muslims and Jews, and the beginnings of the religious-literary genre of Muslim heresiographical writing about Judaism and Jews (pp. 153 ff.). The comparativist approach of Muslim heresiographers provides valuable information for the study of Jewish sectarianism in the early Islamic period, and Wasserstrom has made excellent and appropriately cautious use of these materials. Chapter 5 investigates the "Isra'iliyyat" genre of Muslim tales and how they relate to the Islamic sense of self-definition. The bulk of the chapter consists of a sophisticated analysis of borrowed, or shared, concepts, such</page><page sequence="3">254 BOOK REVIEWS as the tale of Buluqiyya and the role of Metatron in the Jewish and Islamic, esoteric and magical, purviews. In the sixth and concluding chapter of the book, Wasserstrom analyzes the evidence he has found "concerning the covert intimacy cultivated between Muslim and Jew" which resulted in "products ofmutuality" (emphasis his) (p. 206). He does so under three comparativist criteria, "imaginary worldmaking, apocalyptic social settings of symbiosis, and countertradition as critique" (emphasis his) (p. 207). I cannot hope to summarize the sophistication of the arguments Wasserstrom presents in this chapter. Ultimately, his study of the Jewish-Islamic symbiosis is not only a study of "the ways in which one religion made the image of the other into an image of themselves, which image was then used to redefine and continuously legitimate themselves," but also, and perhaps primarily, a "study of historical change, particularly of the generation of novelty in religion" (p. 236). It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of this book for the com- parative study of religions in general and the symbiotic relationship between Islam and Judaism in particular. The subtlety of Wasserstrom's thoughts and arguments is well served by his felicity of expression. The scope of Wasserstrom's scholarship is enormous and stimulating. It invites the reader to ponder and return, again and again, to the evidence and the arguments presented in this study. Vera B. Moreen Swarthmore College Swarthmore, Pa.</page></plain_text>
