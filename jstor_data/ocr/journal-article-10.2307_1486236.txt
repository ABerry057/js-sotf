<plain_text><page sequence="1">BINARY OPPOSITIONS IN THE POETRY OF AMIR GILBOA by WARREN BARGAD The examination of "binary oppositions" (semantic structures of equiva- lence or opposition) in poetic texts has proved helpful in decoding messages which seem at first to be difficult to comprehend.' Since the text often creates its own semantic system, which may appear to be "ungrammatical" (i.e., not in consonance with generally accepted extratextual meanings), the reader may profit considerably by decoding the text's system of oppositions and interpreting their semantic value.2 Binary semantic structures are found throughout Amir Gilboa's poetry, from his early works (La'ot ["For the Sign"], 1942) to his last, posthumous collection (Hakol holekh, ["Everything is Going"], 1985).

Oxymoron-a kind of microstructure of opposition-is a central rhetorical figure; ironic rhyme and other structural and linguistic features (grammar, syntax, neologisms, and archaisms) are also used effec- tively in creating semantic oppositions. In the works written after Gilboa learned of the Holocaust and his family's murder, probably late in 1942,3 the oppositional structure becomes more complex; the glossary is more neutral and less conforming to extra- textual meanings. The poet strives to express the inexpressible: a response to the full knowledge of the Holocaust horror. Here an examination of binary oppositions plays a greater role in clarifying the poetry's often ambiguous, unexpectedly dualistic figures. The later poems, from the mid-sixties to the eighties, rely mainly on both structural and linguistic ambiguities. Here, too, thematic decoding is aided considerably by uncovering the system of binary oppositions opera- tive in these works. An overview of Gilboa's poetry shows abundant evi- dence of an abiding and intensifying system of binary oppositions. Several characteristics distinguish Gilboa's poetry from that of his older contemporaries. In contrast to Natan Alterman (1910-1970) Gilboa focuses tenaciously on the emotional life of the individual, often himself, not on the creation of surrealistic imagery, folkloristic beings, or animated symbolic objects; his is an intimate, emotive lyricism, not a distanced, symbolistic one. Unlike Avraham Shlonsky (1900-1973)-though indebted to him for his lush depictions of nature and his use of traditional religious language- Gilboa avoids playful puns, euphemisms and rhymes, ideological themes, and the bombast of futuristic rhetoric; his is a more serious, internalized tone which reflects poignancy and pain far more than playfulness and verbal virtuosity. In comparison with his younger contemporaries, Gilboa opts mostly for abstract tropes and mythological imagery, not for the concrete images and similes that abound in the writings of Yehuda Amichai (b. 1924). There is also little affinity with the Western (i.e., British and American) style of writ- 3. The first poem Gilboa wrote in direct response to the loss of his family seems to have been "Ani yatom" ("I'm an Orphan"), published in the Jewish Brigade's mimeographed</page><page sequence="3">BINARY OPPOSITIONS IN THE POETRY OF AMIR GILBOA 105 ing seen in the works of the late Dan Pagis (1930-1986) and Natan Zach (b. 1930). These poets respectively concern themselves with poetry either as an embodiment of charm, intellect, and clever perceptiveness, in the case of Pagis, or as a vehicle of dramatic immediacy and ironic, antiromantic import, in the case of Zach. Gilboa is occupied mainly with lyrical, ecstatic, and elegiac voices, with the poet as dreamer and rememberer, with emo- tional immediacy and unabashed romantic expressivity. His is a poetry of inner feelings, private associations, profuse metaphors, and enduring sorrow and wonderment. These and other distinctive elements of his poetry demonstrate Gilboa's artistic affinity to Hayim Nahman Bialik (1873-1934), the leading poet in the Hebrew Renaissance at the turn of the century. Most of all, it is Gilboa's language, diction, and tone which are reminiscent of Bialik's poetry. Through the first half of his career (from the early forties to the early sixties) Gilboa, like Bialik, utilized mainly a vocabulary taken from the biblical books of the prophets, Psalms, Job, the Song of Songs, and from classical rabbinic literature, the siddur and the mahzor. The diction is archaized and heightened, the tone lyrical, frustrated, enthralled, or pained. At the center of the works of both poets is an individual, often a moral voice, manifestly the voice of the persona of the poet himself, speaking from the depths of emotion and sensibility about nature, memories, love, the Jewish fate, the place of the poet, transitions, loneliness, and losses. Like Bialik's, too, Gilboa's poetry is energized by a blend of the mythic and the real, by a predominance of personal associations, and by a dedication to the spirit of natural beauty. Most relevant for this analysis of binary oppositions in Gilboa's works are the contrasts and thematic dissonances found throughout Bialik's poetry. In such works as "Biteshuvati" ("Upon my return"), "Eineha" ("Her eyes"), "Al saf beit hamidrash" ("At the threshold of the study house"), "Zohar" ("Splendor"), "Rak kay shemesh elhad" ("Only one ray of sun"), and "Ve'im yish'al hamal'akh" ("Should the angel ask"), Bialik's romanticism, the Sturm und Drang of contrasting motifs and feelings, is quite blatant. Gilboa's works, following in this romantic tradition, are simi- Hebrew journal Lahayal ("For the Soldier") in Italy, May 7, 1943. The poem was later collect- ed in Sheva reshuyot ("Seven Domains," 1949) under the title "Yetom" ("Orphanhood").</page><page sequence="4">106 WARREN BARGAD larly dissonant, replete with the contrasting emotions of love and anger, loss and fulfillment, happiness and sorrow. A significant source of Gilboa's use of binary semantic structures undoubtedly is Bialik's impassioned, dis- sonant, romantic style of composition. In this discussion I focus on three poems, "Shir kemigdalekh hagavoha" ("A poem like your high tower," 1946); "Uvekhen, tafasti et haparpar" ("And so, I caught the butterfly," 1968); and "Bein ze laze. Kivenadneda" ("Between this and that. As on a swing," 1973). These particular poems were selected for reasons of both chronology and representativeness. Each was written at a different juncture in Gilboa's career-the mid-forties, the mid-sixties, and the early seventies-and col- lected in volumes which reflect different thematics. And yet Gilboa's basic poetics, his view of the world and his idiosyncratic way of expressing that view, remain the same. These poems and their use of binary structures repre- sent not only the particular groups of poems of which they are a part but also the abiding poetic impulse Gilboa demonstrates in his artistic composi- tional form. This stylistic constant, the oppositional structuring of motifs, images, and feelings, identifies Gilboa as a romantic poet, one who often idealizes or mythologizes or rhapsodizes the world, especially the natural world, and who just as often depicts the inadequacies, agonies, and terrors of the world, especially the human world. "Shir kemigdalekh hagavoha" is the lead poem of "Sti hayagon ve- erev hasimlia" ("The warp of sorrow and the weft of joy"), a section of the volume Sheva reshuyot ("Seven Domains," 1949), which comprises twelve elegies written after the close of World War II. Much of the emphasis in these poems is on recovery: the poet, crushed by the loss of his loved ones, seeks consolation, a way somehow to keep on, to maintain an emotional equilibrium. The poem, therefore, with its open expression of agonized memory, anger, and call to vengeance, is more representative of the poems written during the war, immediately after Gilboa learned of his family's murder. These works include "Kezimrat ma'asav shel avi" ("Like the melody of my father's doings"), "Zikhron devarim" ("Memory of things"), "Nishmat Yossi" ("The soul of Yossi"), and "Shir holekh-sovev" ("A cyclical poem"), which contain motifs of memory, redolent depictions of family members, childhood scenes, and the shock of disbelief. In addition, "Sig- nonot shonim" ("Different styles") features an anaphoric structure using the word ze ("this") which is parallel to the anaphora used in "Shir kemig-</page><page sequence="5">BINARY OPPOSITIONS IN THE POETRY OF AMIR GILBOA 107 dalekh hagavoha." Gilboa's placement of "Shir kemigdalekh hagavoha" in the Sheva reshuyot volume, therefore, shows it to be both a summary of all the pain and loss expressed in poems written during 1943-46 and a lead-in to the poems of psychological and emotional reconciliation of 1947-49.4 .Dtr--,-l-' n__- N f!

It is virtually impossible to determine from the original dates of publication of the 1943-1949 poems when exactly most of these works were written. Having published only a small number of his wartime poems in Lahayal (also entitled Hahayal Ha'ivri ["The Hebrew Soldier"]), Gilboa, in the postwar 1946-49 period, set about publishing dozens of poems writ- ten during the war in Israeli newspapers and journals, including Ha'arets, Davar, AI hamish- mar, and Gazit. The poems appeared in a helter-skelter fashion, with no hint of the chronologi- cal order of their composition. Moreover, when Gilboa collected the poems for Sheva reshuyot, for the most part he grouped them topically rather than chronologically, thus further obscuring their actual chronology.</page><page sequence="6">108 WARREN BARGAD 09090r ;r793 iD'T!Sr 25 Dogy iggi9 3 (!8 0 ?) .otry~ niNet~,) ( 'W s 937' n' .071)gy 5pniyd 01104sis 199Y75 93=1ig 10 Ng olt3 35 .nlne 1~n 'l 1973 .n7!t0 937 o';ri by Mar nag-r D;it b ni5,5 7lt ;1'# .yay 92 5992 0112 10 nury 40 ,al~tQ n079 90 ;rit i!)89 289;1 Di~ 0 itW3; tq?3 1) (.00120 ima nrF 112~s ? 132 '"i)rlr ',rR?as ,?rsia; iS nia~~r5typ hyp ny; . ago!~ 'n si nin'r iniih 5N ~1L K`N niNTYS1 45 O qis n)rp -r4 L, ?I~i'l 3~f~ tiaJ P":;2 1,~t 55I .JNka n4 Ti~air 9pf, rl m 50 1Nh1 by nising navyp 201 5p ni'rt3 7ll b'97 20907) Ph:0~ T's ss .nilrf3 7iK? vig)asgg nmp aago Py 5 Y</page><page sequence="7">BINARY OPPOSITIONS IN THE POETRY OF AMIR GILBOA 109 1946 00t921N A poem like your high tower filling with sounds of a bell and sending their dimness in the fog upon the earth to cover over the heads with a canopy of sky.

It embodies one of his most poignant and volatile responses to the Holocaust, in which he lost his entire family, his parents, two brothers, and four sisters. The poem is structured on a varying sequence of static and dynamic ele- ments. The static elements consist of a list of definitions which denote-or attempt to denote-the poem's parameters: its genre, contents, motivation, and other aspects of its sources or aims of expressiveness. (The dynamic or more narrative elements are mentioned later in this discussion.) At the outset these definitions are given in the form of similes, as if the speaker is groping toward a cogent delineation of the poem being created. Lines 1-3 seem to refer to an idyllic place, a town perhaps, with a tower whose ringing but muffled bells "cover over heads with a canopy of sky." Kemigdalekh ("like your tower") and hupa shel shamayim ("a canopy of 5. Although written in 1946, as annotated by Gilboa, the poem's publication appears to have been put off more than two years. However, the original publication is unclear. The Genazim Literary Archives' index of Gilboa's works in Tel Aviv shows a publication entitled "Petila lishti hayagon ve'erev hasimla," Al hamishmar, December 17, 1948. "Shir kemig- dalekh hagavoha" was first collected in Sheva reshuyot and does appear as the opening poem to the section "Shti hayagon ve'erev hasimhla," but I have not been able to verify that this poem is indeed the petitha (opening poem) published in Al Hamishmar. The translations herein are done purposely in a rather literal style, so that the reader might refer more easily to the Hebrew and English texts.</page><page sequence="10">112 WARREN BARGAD sky") evoke a Song-of-Songs, romantic, pastoral sort of situation; the tone is one of love, quietude, security, with the place personified as a beloved, female auditor. In lines 4-5 the next definition seems to continue the evoca- tive, sentimental tone, as well as the theme of muffledness or dimness: "A poem like a curtain [or membrane] of dreams, transparent, glass-like, spread over eyelids and eyes." The atmosphere of dreaminess or seeing through a curtain adds a nostalgic note of looking backward, remembering the hometown, envisioning it dimly. The poem is denoted here as the instru- ment of this act of translucent dream-memory. The images are dualistic to a degree: the tower is filled with the ringing of bells, but the canopy created by their ringing consists of a muffledness or darkness (im'um) and fog (arafel). The dream-curtain covers the lids and eyes, yet it is transparent and allows the speaker to see. The dualism strikes the reader with full force in line 6: the curtain not only covers and yet allows for sight, it also "muzzles the mouth to bring forth the scream that's screamed over the mouth of the abyss." The idyll, certainly, is destroyed; the memory-scene turns to abject terror. The rever- sal is marked by the blatantly ironic juxtaposition of uvolem et hape ("and muzzles the mouth") and lemalet haze'aka ("to let forth the scream"). The immediate effect of this radically dualistic-and impossible-act of a closed- mouth scream highlights the speaker's agony at the awareness of the magni- tude of the Holocaust horror. The dualism or irony of this image effects at least three reading strate- gies. First, it forces us to begin to read the poem backwards6 and to confront the parallelism in lines 2-3 and 6. The rereading may lead us to perceive the bell tower's "darkness" and the act of covering as less-than-security-or sentimentality-shaping acts. The ringing of bells may even call to mind other familiar poems ("Pa'amonim" ["Bells"] by Saul Tchernichovsky, for example) which link the ringing of bells in church towers with anti-Jewish violence. Second, this initial instance of ironic dualism, the closed-mouth scream, may serve as an imagistic anchor, an abiding reference point, or "matrix,"7 6. The concept seems to have originated with Riffaterre. See his essay, "Stylistic Context," in Essays on the Language of Literature, ed. Seymour Chatman and Samuel L. Levin (Boston, 1967), pp. 431--444. See also Menakhem Perry, Hamivne hasemanti shel shirei Bialik (Tel Aviv, 1977), pp. 42-51. 7. The term is Riffaterre's. See Semiotics of Poetry.</page><page sequence="11">BINARY OPPOSITIONS IN THE POETRY OF AMIR GILBOA 113 continually brought to mind as the reader moves through the poem and dis- covers situations, images, or tropes which are similarly dualistic and blatantly self-contradictory. Such would be the case in lines 46-47 with the juxtaposed images mikhelet bokhim ("a chorus of weepers") and nognim alizim ("merry musicians"); in lines 37-38 with the apparently paradoxical combination of innocence and accompanying ominousness of unetifot shel zahav anadnu lashamayim ("and [with] drops of gold we decorated the sky") followed by sheyihyu gevohim ad mavet ("so they'd be high unto death"); in lines 23-25 with the nostalgic images of "the rain on the tin roofs" and "its drizzle in the open field," which are counterposed with mabulei mar'ot ("floods of visions") in line 33. The contradictoriness persists, too, in other mixed images, such as lines 53-54: the "gold of blood that was spilled in the fields"; line 60: "all the sorrows by a fireplace which we desired"; and line 61: "our child laughing to his angels from the cradle," an image included, ironically, within the framework of harsh truths, stillborn children, barren women, and "deaths at the terrors of the roads." Although these reading options are valid and necessary, a third reading strategy-that of tracing and analyzing the binary oppositions in the poem-is more cogent in helping the reader perceive the work's semantic apparatus. Indeed, the initial contradictory image, uvolem et hape lemalet haze'aka ("and muzzles the mouth to let forth the scream," line 6) leads to the discovery in this poem of an entire structure of binary oppositions. In the repeated listing of poem definitions, for example, shir kedok balomot shakuf ("a poem like a curtain of dreams, transparent," line 4), an image, though fleeting, of somnolent quietude, is counterposed with shir kayora kollha ("a poem like a boiling cauldron," line 8), a vision of dire prospects; and shir kefanayikh ("a poem like your face," line 10), which evokes a loving scene, is contrasted by kaleshonot she'il'u devaram besigei esh zomemet kilayon ("like the tongues that stammered their word in the dross of a fire conspiring destruction," line 12), a scene of fiery destructiveness. The various groupings of poem definitions themselves are presented in a structure of opposition: shir kemigalekh ("a poem like your tower"), shir kefanayikh ("a poem like your face") and ukherikmot sivei einay ("and like the woven threads of my eyes")-all love similes-are opposed by shir kayora kolha ("a poem like a boiling cauldron") and shir kaleshonot ("a poem like the tongues")-similes of destruction. In a syntactic vein, all the elliptical phrases in the first two stanzas begin- ning with the word shir ("a poem") are contrasted with phrases entered later</page><page sequence="12">114 WARREN BARGAD in the poem that begin with the words ZE shir ("this is a poem"): ZE shir hageshem ("this is a poem of the rain," line 23), ZE shir ha.ovek ("this is a poem of the embracer," line 27), ZE shir beleilot gevohim ("this is a poem on nights high," line 39), and ZE shir shekol hakdamot lo nakhonu ("this is a poem for which all introductions have been prepared," line 43). The change itself, from shir to ZE shir (from "a poem" to "this is a poem"), is dualistic; it either denotes metaphors which are more specifically romantic (such as "This is a poem of the rain on the tin roofs," and the ecstatic "This is a poem of the embracer of the mossy trunk of a tree in a dense forest") or evokes their more specifically dire contrasts: "This is a poem on nights high unto death," and "This is a poem for which all intro- ductions have been prepared." In these contrasting ze ("this is") definitions, their specificity represents the equivalence factor of the metaphors, while their semantic content reflects their opposition. The list nears its end in the third- and second-last stanzas with the ironically rhymed and diametrically opposed final attempts at definition in lines 49 and 58: ze shir haro'im ("this is a poem of the shepherds") and ze shir kol hashekarim ("this is a poem of all the lies"), though it is arguable that the shepherds' role in the gathering and counting of the sheep is in itself a dualistic image of end-of-day security and of end-of-life divine severity.8 At the center of the poem lies the point of non-definition, the point where metaphorical definitions cease, for the moment, where the speaker interjects his explicit response to all these possible responses: Ata yada'nu, "Now we knew all the floods of visions sparkling in lusts upon fingernails," line 33. Just what is now known is not entirely clear. What is clear is that structurally this stanza divides the poem into two nearly equal parts. Seman- tically, too, the stanza, laden with a purposeful, multilayered ambiguity of images, metaphors, and tenses, dramatizes the poem's sustained structure of binary oppositions. In lines 33-36, the sparkling "visions" that come to mind are qualified by mabulei, uncontrollable "floods" of these visions; and the "lusts upon fingernails," which, after all, may be a memory of passionate loving-a theme continued by ahavnu lir'od ("we loved to tremble") in the following line-are qualified by the purposefully ironic, Alterman-like 8. The motif itself is ironic, in that it is reminiscent of the famous High Holy Day liturgical poem "Unetane tokef," in which God counts each individual for judgment as a shepherd counts the sheep in his flock.</page><page sequence="13">BINARY OPPOSITIONS IN THE POETRY OF AMIR GILBOA 115 simile kir'od lehayav hamavet ("like the trembling of Death for its life"). The image leaves the reader with a fearsome shiver, not a passionate love tremble. The last two lines in the stanza (lines 37-38) seem to describe a childlike, innocent act of decorating the sky with netifot shel zahav, "drops of gold," play-stars, perhaps, which make the sky look pretty and "high." But the metaphor gevohim ad mavet ("high unto death") destroys the innocence and turns the playfulness into a horrible, gothic nightmare. The death image returns the poem to its primary task of seeking self-definition, of searching for purpose and response in the inner and outer worlds, both of which have gone awry. To return to the poem's structure and to the notion of static and dyna- mic elements, this central stanza (ata yada'nu, "now we knew") is paired with the poem's closing stanza (akh yesh Eloha shel ma'as, "but there's a God of deed," line 63). Both do not begin with an attempt at definition, but evince directly the speaker's voice; both depict the speaker's feelings of loss, anger, terror, and betrayal. Instead of the metaphorical expressions "a poem like" or "this is a poem of," which aim blindly at defining the poem, these stanzas are metonymic passages which describe what the speaker's world feels like after the Holocaust. Another significant binary opposition in the poem, therefore, is this interplay between metaphoric and metonymic pas- sages, between passages of definition and the more narrative passages of the poem. Binary oppositions pervade the poem at all levels of semantic activity: in similarly structured verb phrases: lirkod bemikhelet bokhim ("to dance in a chorus of weepers," line 46) vs. lifkod et hatson ("to count the sheep," line 50); in counterposed construct phrases (featuring an inverted alliteration which accentuates the contrast between the two images): hakarat ha'eima ("awareness of the terror," line 9) vs. rakat ha'ayin ("the one of the gentle eye," line 20); shedei ha'olam ("the breasts of the world," line 26) vs. eimei haderakhim ("the terrors of the roads," line 44); in phrases with one com- mon part: hupa shel shamayim ("a canopy of sky," line 3) vs. baludat shamayim ("the rusting of heaven," line 41), arafel al pnei erets ("fog upon the earth," line 2) vs. nefel al arets ("a stillborn [child] on the earth," line 40). Individual word groupings are also counterposed: zikhronot, rikmot, ne'arot, halomot ("memories," "weavings," "girls," "dreams") vs. ta'avot, mitit, yetsi'ot, ra'ot ("lusts," "deaths," "leavings," "sorrows"). The same may be seen in contrasting thematic motifs: uvolem et hape ("and muzzles the</page><page sequence="14">116 WARREN BARGAD mouth," line 6) vs. hu yish'ag ke'arye ("he will roar like a lion," line 41); bitnah hamegulaf shel ha'alma ("the sculptured stomach of the maiden," lines 29-30) vs. keres mele'a ("a full belly," line 59); nakhon veyatsiv ("sound and firm," line 66) vs. muzar ve'ayom ("strange and terrible," lines 66-67); tsore'ah nefel ("a stillborn [child] screams," line 40) vs. veyaldenu tsobek ("and our child laughing," line 61); kilayon ("destruction") vs. reshit ("beginning," lines 12-13); dimyon ("imagination") vs. emet ("truth," line 65). As is usually the case in works in which binary oppositions play a signifi- cant role, there are several words or images that have a dual semantic func- tion; that is, they embody both meanings of the oppositional structure. For example, sade or sadot ("field," "fields") is the setting of both a soft, gentle rainfall and a stream of blood; einayim (or shemurot, risim, or sivim)- "eyes" (or "eyebrows," "eyelids," or "eyelashes")-are the instruments of both unmitigated pleasure and ultimate pain; yeled (or yonek or nefel)- "child" (or "infant" or "stillborn")-is the symbol both of innocence and new life, and of betrayal and death; shekarim ("lies") connotes both a bliss- ful state of prior innocence and a devastating reversal of God's trust. And shir ("poem") itself, perhaps the most semantically laden word in the poem, reflects at once the sweet vision of the past and the terrible truth of the present. Shir embodies both a fervid, pathetic celebration of memory, and a bitter, unappeasable exclamation of agony and loss. The larger images and themes in "Shir kemigdalekh hagavoha" loom in their oppositionism. The newborn vs. the stillborn, the young pregnant woman vs. the barren mother, lies vs. the truth, innocence (of children or lovers) vs. betrayal (most disturbingly, by God). In sum, love and death are the two central categories of opposition into which all other aspects of oppo- sition in the poem may be placed: love, with all its ramifications of birth and life, and death, with all the loving and life it precludes. The horrible truth of Holocaust death brings to the poem its counterposed memories of the per- sons and things most beloved. All the poem's images, tropes, and structures fall into this subsuming love-death dichotomy. As noted at the outset of this discussion, the structure of binary opposi- tions is evident as well in Gilboa's later collections. This is especially true of the volumes Ratsiti likhtov siftei yeshenim ("I wanted to write the lips of</page><page sequence="15">BINARY OPPOSITIONS IN THE POETRY OF AMIR GILBOA 117 sleepers," 1968) and Ayala eshlah otakh ("Gazelle I'll send you," 1973). In these collections the general style is manifestly different from the poetry in Kehulim va'adumim ("Blues and Reds," 1963), Gilboa's major volume of collected works of the 1942-63 period, though obvious changes had occurred in "Shelosha she'arim .hozrim" ("Three recurring gates [or chapters],") the later and last section of that collection. The basic alteration in these later collections is one of structure. In Ratsiti likhtov siftei yeshenim, the poems take the shape of introspective pens6es; they ponder things beyond human control: life's swift passing, the impersonality of time, the dispensability of poetry, the poet's social and artistic isolation. At the center of these poems is the dream, that ironic moment of insight which cannot be relived or adequately transmitted once the dreamer awakens. The poet himself is the dreamer, the one asleep; he is caught in thought-limbo between knowing and fear, insight and helpless- ness, affirmation and negation. Many poems have no firm ending; verses are constituted of intermingled phrases that flow into one another without any clarifying punctuation. In Ayala eshlah otakh the structural changes persist: unpunctuated verse, ambiguous phrasing, a measured, pensive voice. Despite these shifts in poetic expression, Gilboa's works still reflect the structure of binary oppositions which pervades the earlier works of the forties and fifties.9 Two poems, "Uvekhen, tafasti et haparpar" ("And so, I caught the butterfly") and "Bein ze laze. Kivenadneda" ("Between this and that. As on a swing"), both of which employ the image of the butterfly, elicit a strong sense of dualism and show clearly Gilboa's continued predilection for binary oppositions. The first poem, the more playful of the two-at least at its outset- counterposes a dualistic situation against a ghostly, tertiary presence; this presence, in turn, stands in opposition to the duality of the butterfly and its would-be captor, the poem's speaker. The second work, more serious, even wearisome in tone, posits an existential dualism which depends for its force- fulness on the close repetition of binary oppositions. ? c ? 9.

I don't know what name to call him.'0 The poem's opening lines (1-3) describe the experience of catching a butterfly. In the opening sentence, uvekhen, tafasti et haparpar ("and so, I caught the butterfly"), the voice sounds victorious but understated, certain- ly less than euphoric; the sentence is short and nonexclamatory. The intro- ductory word, uvekhen ("and so"), evokes a dramatic sense of being in the middle or at the end-but not at the beginning-of a narrative. In the same vein, the "and so" beginning also reflects an ambiguous reaction to the feat on the part of the speaker: he seems more surprised or ambivalent than triumphant. The ambiguity is confirmed by the sentence that follows, shelerega nishtateti ("for a moment I got silly"), which emphasizes the impromptu nature of the catch: the speaker himself notes, apologetically, the silliness of the act. But then, as the captor begins to describe the catch and his response to it, the butterfly apparently escapes and flies off, despite the catcher's attempt to prevent it from doing so. The reader is confronted with a "live" situation, featuring a caught-but-not-quite-caught butterfly and a speaker- catcher who has spoken too soon. The situation itself is thus dualistic. It is somewhat lamely explained by the speaker-catcher in a pair of oppositional sentences in line 4: "I saw the butterfly. Perhaps the butterfly saw me." The battlelines are drawn; the duality of hunter and hunted is reflected in their respective sights, in their mutual awareness of the fray. In line 5, however, a third, rather ambiguous entity joins the scene. This ghostly figure, unseen by both hunter and butterfly, haunts the speaker throughout the poem. Its presence creates less a triangle of forces than a dis- ruptive duality, a force of opposition as against the relatively harmonious unity, as it develops, between the hunter and the butterfly. In his confronta- tion with the butterfly the speaker knows exactly what he is dealing with: a 10.

In complete, simple, paired declarative sentences (lines 6-7), he names it precisely: parpar ("butterfly"); and he wonders, in proper binary fashion, whether the butterfly has a name for him as well. In contrast, both the prior and the following sentences regarding the "something" or "someone" (lines 5 and 8) are elliptical, emphasizing both the confusion on the part of the speaker and the formation of a second binary opposition: the catcher-and-butterfly vis-a-vis the spooky figure, "which both of us do not contain." The syntactic differentiation in itself creates an added dimension of opposition. The remainder of the poem features a number of overlapping images in the catcher-butterfly-specter groupings. In line 9, the established opposi- tional pattern is continued: the butterfly is "slippery" (i.e., evasive), but the catcher is "quicker." In line 10, the adjective zariz ("quick") is used for the unseen specter, who is "immeasurably quicker than both of us," says the speaker. The overlapping use ofzariz creates a number of different configur- ations. On the one hand, the catcher-and-specter are now united in quick- ness vis-a-vis the poor butterfly; the reader may well assume that the butterfly will not have to fend off two prospective hunters, one even faster and therefore more threatening than the other. On the other hand, the catcher-and-butterfly are still united by the specter's surpassing both of them in quickness. Indeed, in line 10 the catcher seems to convey a certain tone of fearfulness; namely, that the unknown, lurking spirit, who is "immeasurably quicker than both of us," may be hunting both of them. The dual ambiguity fortifies the general oppositional structure to this point in the poem. Another elliptical sentence, line 11, replete with repetitions, alliterations, and binary divisions (rifruf/rifruf perai!/perah), returns the reader to the poem's initial-and continual-situation. The hunter, in line 11, is appar- ently successful in his capture of the butterfly, probably because he has struck with his hand precisely at the halfway point (mahatsit, "middle" or "center," line 12) of the butterfly's fluttering (rifruj)-yet another image of evenly divisible duality. But there lingers still a feeling of inadequate quick- ness, in comparison with "the one quicker than both of us" (line 13). The butterfly's capture has not succeeded in warding off this stronger, forebod- ing presence. The catcher and his captive butterfly are now united, figura- tively, in the hands of the unknown specter. By repeating line 4 verbatim, line 14 ironically rearranges the hunter-vs.- hunted dichotomy; and line 15 realigns the binary opposition even further: it</page><page sequence="19">BINARY OPPOSITIONS IN THE POETRY OF AMIR GILBOA 121 strikes the speaker that all along (lifnei khen, "before") both catcher and butterfly have been observed-literally, "hunted" (tsada)-by the eye of the spectral observer. In lines 16-18, the only place in the poem which features three consecutive verses comprising one sentence, the tone grows more serious. The casual, playful game of butterfly hunting is not so innocent or "silly" as it seems. The specter-observer-hunter is felt all about; his gaze, inescapable, comes across "with a quickness always burning and creat- ing"-quite a change from line 13, where the quickness of the specter merely stands in opposition to the relative slowness of the catcher and butterfly. The coda line, "I do know what name to call him," not only deepens the mystery of this pervasive spirit, it also counterposes the process of naming (or possible naming) in lines 6-7 with the impossibility of naming the specter. Naming and non-naming, hunter(s) and hunted, seeing and not seeing, seen and unseen, catching and not catching, captured and uncaptured, quick and slow, life and death-these are the thematic dichotomies which reflect the pervasiveness of binary oppositions in the poem. The parallels and dif- ferences in syntax, structure, and semantic repetitions and transitions re- inforce these thematic oppositions. Of course, one could venture an interpretation of the mystery figure: it is God, perhaps, the nameless or unnamed One (as in the Burning Bush scene, Exodus 3:13-14); the unseen One who constantly watches us in all our frivo- lity; whose presence is always felt; who constantly invades our thoughts; who has the power of destroying ("burning") and creating; who quickly, in the wink of an eye, can bring to life and cause to die; who is much quicker than a would-be butterflycatcher or a butterfly's escape. The thin line between creation and destruction, life and death, hunter and hunted, freedom and escape, frivolity and significance, is the central subject of"Uvekhen, tafasti et haparpar." The dramatized situation, with its inner, active voice, continually projects a back-and-forth pattern which is fraught with binary oppositions in action, personae, theme, syntax, and structure. The dramatic climax-the turn at the end of the poem from the pairing of butterfly hunter and hunted butterfly to the mystery of the unnamed specter-leaves the reader with an added sense of opposition: the shift from the trivial and playful to the serious and spiritual. Much like those of "Shir kemigdalekh hagavoha," the closing lines also signal a shift from the metaphoric-the triangle of central images-to the metonymic: Gilboa ends the poem with a dualistic vision of the fragility of life, of life as</page><page sequence="20">122 WARREN BARGAD an existence controlled by some ineffable force, which has the power, in a flash, to give life and to take it away. To surrender ultimately to this con- trolling force is the common fate of both butterfly and hunter. Though written in the late sixties, the poem, with its multifaceted binary system of expression, reverberates with echoes of Gilboa's earlier works of the forties. The way the poems are syntactically structured and the modes of experience rendered have changed radically in these twenty years; but, as this synchronic, semantic view demonstrates, Gilboa's poetics, his essential style-especially the evocation of oppositional patterns-still abides.

Kivenadneda" is included, consists of poems written in the late sixties and early seventies, before the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War in October, 1973. Some of the poems in this volume reflect aspects of the poet's response to the Six-Day War of 1967 and to the "War of Attrition" which followed. "Bein ze laze. Kivenadneda" appears to have a philosophical, existential import, and yet a worldly, political interpretation seems plausible as well. The main theme of this poem is dualism per se: an existential feeling of being between things, an ambivalence toward life, toward moving through it with a humdrum regularity. The speaker is life-weary and weakened; he feels as if he is swinging in a swing, but has neither the strength nor the in- terest to continue swinging. In line 3, the voice points out a looming possibi- lity: he may fall to earth, probably to die. The tone is apprehensive: the speaker's mouth is full of adverbs (efshar, od, akh), full of the fear of imminent demise. The elliptical, one-word sentence la'arets ("to earth") ominously stresses the inevitability and finality of the fall. It is apparent, suddenly, that death, the abrupt end of the ride, is uncontrollable, unpre- dictable, deadly. From the very beginning of the poem, therefore, there is a doubling of ambivalence: toward life as an unwanted existence and, in the typical formula of a dichotomous existential dilemma, toward death as an unwilled event. In the central section (lines 4-7) of the poem, however, there appears to be an abiding passion to persevere in living. Out of the speaker's very weak- ness and indifference there arises a "strong reason" (hata'am . . .harif) to continue one's life. This motivation is as "strong as a sea of boiling lime [or mortar]"; it lives on "like a limb that lives from the strength of its strength." The context seems negative: there is no interest or strength to go on; yet the will-perhaps mainly a physiological persistence-still exists, running on its own power. This will is a force which in and of itself, outside the actual human will, has the power of life and death: "to burn and to be burned. To destroy and to cease." From a different perspective, one might conclude that the simile "as a sea of boiling lime" connotes a negative image, that this kind of recalcitrant, physical persistence represents an unhappy, depressing situation. The existential dilemma possibly is exacerbated by the absolute will of the body to function even when the individual will has stopped functioning. To use a contemporary social and moral parallel: much like a terminally ill patient who wishes to be rid of the suffering through euthanasia, the will to die is</page><page sequence="22">124 WARREN BARGAD thwarted by others who point to the persistent heartbeat or still active brain waves. The patient-existentialist in "Bein ze laze. Kivenadneda" is indeed in limbo, hovering between a pervasive feeling of discouragement toward life and an impervious inability to abandon it. What complicates the revolving and overlapping dualisms in this poem is the highly ambiguous and allusive nature of the vocabulary used in the poem's middle section. Gilboa is playing on words here: Harif translated here as "strong," also means hot, bitter, or sharp, that is, spicy to the taste. The word ta'am in line 6, manifestly connoting reason or motivation, has as its first meaning "taste." Ta'am .arif therefore, may seem a spicy-hot or bitter taste. Moreover, the term ever hakai in line 6 refers unambiguously to the rabbinic prohibition to eat meat which has been cut from a live animal, or, in the rabbinic interpretation of Leviticus 17:10-14, to eat uncooked or blood-soaked meat.'2 Therefore, ta'am, in this context, could mean actual "taste"; and the phrase hata'am ... .arif might connote the "bitter taste" felt by the speaker at this point in life. The "living limb," by way of its refer- ence to a food and ritual taboo, makes more explicit and unnerving the speaker's disgust with the body's recalcitrance in the face of the mind or feeling.'3 The poem's final image, that of the butterfly-we recognize it from "Uvekhen, tafasti et haparpar"-is, in this context of imposed duality, an image indeed apropos. Following the erroneous but accepted notion that butterflies live only for a day, Gilboa, in the closing lines of the poem, uses the figure of the butterfly to resolve the dilemma. Like the "sea of boiling lime," which has within it the forces of both destruction and self- destruction, and like the weary person who feels suspended in the limbo of a morbid life, the butterfly exists in a wholly dualistic condition. However, unlike these parallel images, the butterfly "attains" this condition naturally: As it "sucks" the nectar of the flowers upon which it alights, the butterfly, with its limited life span, is at once "sucked till the end." At least two interpretations of the poem seem possible. On the one hand, it may be that the butterfly indeed is a symbol of an existential "achieve- 12. The rabbinic discussion is found in Pesahim 22b. 13. In the talmudic literature, sid rote'ab (boiling lime or mortar) is also associated with food taboos. In the Yerushalmi (Shabbat 3:3) the rabbis allowed the rolling of a raw egg on a roof of hot mortar on the Sabbath (to warm it before eating) but not the rolling of an egg on hot dirt. The same discussion is recorded in the Tosefta 2:22. (The Babylonian Talmud [Shabbat 39a] uses the phrase gag rote'ah, "a boiling roof.")</page><page sequence="23">BINARY OPPOSITIONS IN THE POETRY OF AMIR GILBOA 125 ment": It lives fully and dies fully within one and the same act. This rapid but complete life-death experience happens naturally and simultaneously, without the sense of suspension or dilemma, which is posed by the conscious dissonance between feeling and physical being. The butterfly, therefore, has attained a kind of nirvana, a state of being-dying which may be a consum- mate wish on the part of this poetic speaker. On the other hand, the butterfly may be a symbol of life itself as a simultaneous state of living-dying. As one lives, in other words, the closer one moves toward death. Life, in this sense-like the butterfly's day-is a combination of these two opposite forces. The possibility of a third interpretation persists: "Bein ze laze. Kive- nadneda" may have a political or moral message, embodying Gilboa's response to the constant cycle of war in the Arab-Israeli conflict. The poet has composed such "realistic" poems before; for example, "Malkhut demama" ("Kingdom of silence," Ha'aretz, April 3, 1953) was written in response to the first large-scale atomic bomb testing in November, 1952.'4 Another such example is the title poem of the Ayala eshla, otakh collection, which has the speaker guiltily sending off the lovely antelope-a symbol of the beloved in the Song of Songs-to die a violent, bloody death in battle. In this realistic interpretation, "Bein ze laze. Kivenadneda" describes a situation of being caught between things, of swinging uncontrollably from one war to another. Even though there is apparently little interest in con- tinuing the cycle, the bloody "limb" seems to have a life of its own. Like "a sea of boiling lime," war creates a situation of being at once the destroyer and the destroyed; no one is the winner. And this is the lesson of the butter- fly: it lives dualistically, vibrant in life, yet simultaneously dying. Such is the fate of those who exist in a war-to-war syndrome. Like "Uvekhen, tafasti et haparpar," ."Bein ze laze. Kivenadneda" dis- plays a number of syntactic, structural, and other poetic features which re- inforce the binary oppositionism of its semantic and thematic elements. Perhaps most obvious are the dualistic, complementary pairings of verbs: lisrof ulehisaref("to burn and to be burned," line 8), lekhalot velikhlot ("to destroy and to [be destroyed]," line 8), and hamotsets venimtsats ("it sucks and is sucked," line 10). Added to these duplicative pairings are word repeti- tions, which echo, in their very repetition, the oppositions elicited in the 14. Told to me and Stanley E Chyet in a conversation at Gilboa's home in December, 1982.</page><page sequence="24">126 WARREN BARGAD poem's semantic units. These include bein ze laze ("between this and that," line 1), which in turn is echoed by veze ("and this," line 10); the former opens the poetic discourse on the existential dilemma, the latter, in a closing echo, introduces the poetic resolution. (Hazot and haze are also placed in the same positions at the ends of lines 4 and 5.) The word ko'ah ("strength") is also repeated: it appears first in line 2 as lo ko'ab ("no strength"), which is reinforced by its equivalent hahulsha ("weakness") in line 4, and it re- appears in juxtaposed repetition in the phrase ke'ever hahzai miko'alh koho ("like a limb that lives from the strength of its strength") in line 6. The first use of ko'ah delineates the speaker's weakness; the later, close repetition accentuates the uncontrolledness of the physical body, the "living limb," as opposed to the speaker's confessed feeling of being emotionally sapped. Syntactic units which reflect the poem's structure of binary oppositions include the repetition of phrases structured in parallel, such as lo ko'ah ... lo inyan ("no strength..,. no interest," line 2), aval mitokh ("but out of," lines 4-5), and habulsha hegedola hazot ... .oser ha'inyan haze ("this great weak- ness . .. this lack of interest," lines 4-5); the repeated use of elliptical sen- tences, varying from one-word sentences (lines I and 3), to short phrases (lines 1 and 8), to longer, dependent clauses (lines 1-2); and the contrast of the elliptical sentences both with the long, middle sentence (aval ... ule- hisaref "but... and to be burned," lines 4-8) and, especially, with the com- plete, unambiguously declarative and fully structured closing sentence (lines 9-10), in which the speaker states his understanding of the dilemma. Once again, as in both of the other works discussed here, this poem shifts from a metaphoric to a metonymic mode of expression, reflecting Gilboa's view of the nature of life. From the point of view of the reader, this sort of closing plays a dual role: not only does it bring the poem to an end, but it also puts an end to the dissonance, ambiguity, confusion, duality, and mixed emotions caused by the pervasive play of binary oppositions in the body of the poems. It is as if Gilboa, at the ends of these poems, sets aside the oppositional structures, shifts away from the emotional conflict altogether, and ends, decidedly, with "facts" or "truth." Metaphor, the figurative language through which the feelings-in-the-poem are expressed poetically, gives way to metonomy, the concrete language through which the feelings-of-the-poet are expressed directly and passed directly on to the reader."5 15. Particularly relevant here, in reference to Gilboa's closings, are comments by Barbara Herrnstein Smith on the "substantial ... force" of closure and the "sense of truth" and "un-</page><page sequence="25">BINARY OPPOSITIONS IN THE POETRY OF AMIR GILBOA 127 More subtle elements of opposition and parallelism are evident in the nearly homophonous, rhymed pairing of kayam ("exists") and keyam ("like a sea") in line 7; the rhyming of ta'am ("reason," line 6) with this pair, though the accent is different (ka-YAM and ke-YAM vs. TA-'am); the doubled consonant in the word "to suck": m-ts-ts (line 10); and perhaps the most important of these secondary dualistic features; the verbal affinity of consonantal doubling found in the roots of the words for "swing" and "butterfly": nd-nd and pr-pr. Embodied in the poem's central images, in other words, is a phonetic duality which, among other structural elements, radiates the binary mode that is so pervasive in this work. The three works by Amir Gilboa discussed here were written over a span of more than twenty-five years. Despite many changes in Gilboa's general style, each of these poems demonstrates a persistent stylistic trait; namely, the expressive implementation of binary oppositions. Rooted in the roman- tic tendencies of Bialik's poetry, this equivalent structuring of semantic materials provides the reader with continuous clues to "the basic paradigm of the system"l6 found in many individual works, even in entire cycles and volumes of poetry by Gilboa. In great measure, Gilboa's poetics-his perception of the world around him and the way he shapes his poetic vocabulary to express this percep- tion-relies upon the utilization of this structure of binary oppositions. While it displays an essentially romantic impulse on the part of Gilboa, the use of semantic equivalence structures also provides the reader with a sense of Gilboa's inventiveness, of the beauty and affectivity of his poetic expression.
