<plain_text><page sequence="1">Elliot Dorff. Love Your Neighbor and Yourself. A Jewish Approach to Modern Per- sonal Ethics. Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 2003. xvii, 366 pp. The subtitle tells it all: the book is not about bioethics, business ethics or communal ethics, but about the kind of ethics one should establish for one's per- sonal life. Starting with issues of privacy, the book moves us through sexual ethics, relationships within families, forgiveness, and finally, hope. Although traditional Jewish sources are mined for their insights, in the end, this is one person's notion about what Jewish ethics can (and should) say about issues of personal ethics. Dorff acknowledges this right in his preface, "throughout the book, I present what I take to be an authentic reading and application of the Jewish tradition but surely not the only one. I therefore take care to use judgment [emphasis in the original] in assessing how the tradition should be best applied to modern circumstance, by providing arguments from the tradition and from modern sources and circumstance to justify [emphasis in the original] my reading of the tradition and arguing against alternative readings" (p. xii). In short, the book is not descriptive of the Jewish tra- dition but prescriptive, laying out how one should think about these issues as a modern American Jew who wants to think "Jewishly." The preface also serves to place the book in its intellectual context. Elliot Dorff is both an ordained Conservative Rabbi and the holder of a Ph.D. in philos- ophy. With these "Wissenschaftliche" credentials, he has spent his career bringing traditional Jewish sources and modern philosophical questions and methods into conversation. This book is part of that ongoing project, positioning itself between 3.

On the one hand stand the Orthodox, who insist that Jewish law is prescriptive and timeless. From this perspective there is no such thing as a "modern" Jewish ethic; there is only timeless halakhah. On the other side stand Reform thinkers, who claim that there is no stable "Jewish ethics" at all, but mere- ly a tradition built by Jews living in certain times and places. Dorff places himself firmly between these positions. After a brief summary of a variety of approaches to moral philosophy, Dorff takes up the issue of what makes his version of mod- ern Jewish ethics both modern and Jewish. Against the Orthodox, he insists that Jewish law is not fixed but is the product of historical development and interpre- tation. Against the Reform, he insists that such development and interpretation emerge from the community and are not simply what this, that, or the other person happens to conclude. This positioning of the "Conservative" position is hardly new. Here, however, it receives an eloquent and refined articulation. It should be noted that the content of the book is also not entirely new. Much of the material in the following chapters is drawn from an array of earlier publications. The argument of the book rests on certain basic assumptions about human beings. These assumptions include the notion that humans are created in the divine image and so are innately due respect, that humans are an integrated whole of body and soul, that human beings have a built-in potential for good, and that people are best developed as part of a family and a community. There is of course no ques- tion that all these assumptions can find ample documentation in traditional Jew- ish sources. Yet it must also be said that one can easily hold these views without being Jewish. In short, it seems to me that Dorff is not so much giving us an ethic that is quintessentially Jewish as he is giving us one that can be more or less easi- ly situated within Judaism. The content, too, often comes across as not so much "Jewish" in some nar- row sense as just good common advice. Consider his advice to young Jews as re- gards marriage, contraception, and reproduction. Dorff asserts that while the use of contraception by Jews is permissible, it should be used strategically because re- production is important for the Jewish people and so having children should be an ultimate Jewish goal. As part of this argument, he makes the following points: 1) parents should make sure that their teenagers choose a college attended by many Jews, 2) college students should understand that the college years are not too ear- ly to look for a spouse, 3) young people who find a mate in college should marry in graduate school and begin having their children, then 4) even if young couples choose to use contraceptives for a time, they are well-advised, both medically and Jewishly, not to wait too long (p. 101, and again in a slight variation on p. 153). Now there is nothing wrong or objectionable with any of these points. In fact, quite the opposite, they are almost commonplaces. Any good parent could (and proba- bly has) come up with these exact principles without the benefit of Conservative ordination or a Ph.D. in philosophy. This one example can stand for a good deal of the content of the book. It is such a good reflection of modern middle-of-the-road Jewish thinking that it faces the danger of coming across as almost self-evident to the educated Jewish reader. In the end, the book is an articulate, even compelling presentation of what a modern, secularized but Jewishly concerned, well-informed writer sees to be the 182</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews ingredients of a strong and healthy personal ethic. It draws on Jewish sources, tra- dition, and history, not in a profound or technical way, but in a way that is acces- sible to a broad readership. It offers insight, advice, and guidance that are Jewish- ly informed, but not halakhic in the traditional Orthodox sense. If nothing else, it shows us that in struggling with the difficulties of being Jewish, and raising Jew- ish families, in modem America, the Jewish tradition is not, and need not, be silent. Peter J.
