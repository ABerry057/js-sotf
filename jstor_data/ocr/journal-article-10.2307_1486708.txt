<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bilhah Nitzan. Qumran Prayer and Religious Poetry. Studies on the Texts of the Desert of Judah, vol. 12. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1994. xxi, 415 pp. This revised and translated 1989 dissertation from Tel Aviv University (directed by J. Licht) is a comprehensive form-critical study of the prayers found at Qumran. Bilhah Nitzan's book is divided into three parts: In part I, the development from occasional prayers in the Bible to fixed prayers in rabbinic literature is described. In part II, Nitzan studies the unique prayers of the Qumran sect. In part III the prayers found at Qumran are contrasted with the Hodayot hymns. In part I Nitzan demonstrates that the Qumran prayers exhibit a transitional stage between the occasional spontaneous prayers found in the Bible and the worship through fixed prayers established by the rabbis. Nitzan describes prayers found in the Bible, Apocrypha, and rabbinic sources in chapter 1. In chapter 2 she shows that the people at Qumran used regular public prayers at fixed times. In chapter 3 she compares 4QDivrei ha-Me'orot (which she calls Tehinnot) with the fixed rabbinic prayers (Shemoneh Esreh) and finds striking parallels between them.</page><page sequence="2">390 BOOK REVIEWS Nitzan deals with blessings and curses at the beginning of part II. She believes that the curses found in the War Scroll were used as a magical weapon against the Sons of Darkness. The next chapter discusses the priestly blessing and its appearance in different Qumran prayers. Nitzan analyzes the literary forms of the Qumran prayers, dividing them by liturgical function as follows: songs of praise (chap. 6), eschatological poetry (chap. 7), magical poetry (chap. 8), and mystical poetry (chap. 9). In part III (chap. 10), she compares the Hodayot to the other Qumran prayers and emphasizes the individual character of the Hodayot. Nitzan concludes that the parallels she finds between the Qumran prayers and the rabbinic prayers indicate the existence of fixed prayers in Second Temple Judaism "alongside" sacrifices at the Temple. Nitzan believes that all the prayers found at Qumran are of sectarian authorship. Both of these points may be contested. Recently E. Fleischer proposed that during the Second Temple period Jewish prayers were not fixed.' Fleischer noted that the use of fixed prayers by groups that left Jerusalem cannot prove the existence of such prayers among people who took part in the worship at the Temple. Nitzan's second claim, that all the prayers found in Qumran are of sectarian authorship, is an unfounded presupposition. Nitzan believes, for example, that the "Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice" were composed in Qumran. However, the discovery of this composition in both libraries of the Second Temple period know to us, namely, Qumran and Masada, points to the likelihood that this was a popular prayer used by different groups during this period.2 C. Newsom proposes non-Qumranic authorship for the "Songs of Sabbath Sacrifice" as well as for the Daily Prayers (Divrei ha-Me'orot) and the Festival Prayers.3 Nitzan deals with Qumran prayers that were published prior to 1990 and therefore does not discuss 4Q448 "the Prayer for the welfare of king Jonathan," which seems to prove that prayers composed outside of Qumran 1.

Some scholars have identified three scrolls of Deuteronomy from cave 4-4QDeutn, 4QDeutj, and 4QDeutkl-as collections of prayers. Two of these scrolls include the Decalogue and Shema.6 Other scholars argue that some of the Psalms Scrolls found in caves 11 and 4 were copied in order to be used for liturgical purposes.' If we accept these conclusions, we should ask ourselves why we find such a difference, in the same community, between composed prayers (such as Divrei ha-Me'orot and the "Songs of Sabbath Sacrifice") and prayers consisting of biblical quotations. We should consider the possibility that the different kinds of prayers originated in different groups.8 Despite these specific points, Nitzan's book represents a significant con- tribution to the interpretation of the Qumran prayers. She is the first to 4. E. Eshel, H. Eshel, and A. Yardeni, "A Qumran Composition Containing Part of Ps. 154 and a Prayer for the Welfare of King Jonathan and His Kingdom," Israel Exploration Journal 42 (1992): 199-229. 5. As noted by E. Puech, "11QPsApa: Un rituel d'exorcismes: Essai de reconstruction," Revue de Qumran 14 (1990): 377-408. In her discussion of this prayer, Nitzan accepts all of the reconstructions made by Puech. In general, Nitzan accepts most of the readings and reconstructions of the editors of the prayers found in Qumran, and thus does not offer corrections or reconstructions of her own. 6.

It is very hard to accept the view that the same group of people who recited the Grace over the Meal on a regular day by quoting verses from Deuteronomy would have, in a case of mourning, a fixed prayer as Grace after the Meal which is not based on biblical verses.
