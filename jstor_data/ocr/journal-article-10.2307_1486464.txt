<plain_text><page sequence="1">BUBER'S ANTI-KANTIANISM by LAWRENCE PERLMAN Introduction The philosophy of Martin Buber has attracted more attention, both favorable and critical, than has any other modern Jewish philosophy. None of the criticism leveled against Buber's thought is as thorough and philoso- phically informed as that found in Steven Katz's seminal essay, "Martin Buber's Epistemology: A Critical Appraisal."' In this essay Katz argues that Buber adopts a Kantian architectonic to provide the metaphysical under- pinnings for his philosophy of dialogue. In Katz's own words, Though Buber does not provide anything like te elaborate architectonic argu- ments of the first Critique it is evident that he assumes their essential validity. This implicit assumption, in fact, provides the a priori theoretical constellation of the dialogical structure.2 I contend, however, that Buber ultimately rejects the Kantian architectonic 1.

A close reading of all the appropriate texts will demonstrate that there is only superficial warrant for considering Buber's use of some Kantian ideas to be ultimately determinative. Buber's rejection of central Kantian positions must be weighed alongside the evidence that Katz marshals to erect his thesis. Katz fails to reconstruct Buber's entire position, and he ignores the evidence that contradicts his thesis. Katz's analysis of Buber's I-Thou/I-It division of reality, as philosophically informed as it is, is purely structural. He does not give serious attention to Buberian texts that indicate Buber's understanding of Kant's position.3 Katz draws parallels between Buber's use of a Thou-world and Kant's noumenon, and the It-world and Kant's phenomenon. He does not collect and analyze Buber's own remarks concerning these Kantian ideas. A textu- al analysis of Buber's ideas in these areas will illustrate that Katz's view is faulty in its main assumption and ignores Buber's central thrust in Buber's rejection of Kant's metaphysics. Buber's supposed Kantianism is focused on his use of three Kantian positions that revolve around the basis of reality. According to Katz there is a structural identity between Kant's and Buber's views of reality.4 The noumenal/phenomenal description of reality at the foundation of Kant's metaphysics is imported into Buber's thought.' As a result of this Kantian view of reality, Katz claims that Buber's view of reality, indicated through I-Thou/I-It, parallels Kant's view on three points. It is best to let Professor Katz speak for himself. First, like Kant, Buber sees the world as essentially "twofold"; second, Kant's understanding of "noumenal" reality is the basis, though not the sum total, of Buber's understanding of the I-Thou reality; thirdly, Kant's account of "phenomenal" reality provides the foundation, if not the whole. of Buber's understanding of I-It reality.6 3. Ultimately we are no closer to understanding Buber's position if we analyze some of the data without constructing all of the epistemological ideas. This does not necessarily mean that Buber's position is ultimately defensible nor that one should reject out of hand Katz's criticism of Buber's use of dialogue. I do not wish to enter into that type of discussion here. Furthermore I find myself in agreement with many of Katz's criticisms of the effects of Buber's use of dia- logue. I do not have anything new to say about the contentless nature of Buber's view of rev- elation. 4. Katz, p. 8. 5. Ibid. 6. Ibid., pp. 8-9.</page><page sequence="3">BUBER'S ANTI-KANTIANISM 97 This dichotomy of reality poses opposing conditions for human knowledge. I-It knowledge operates under the rule of causal and spatio-temporal laws. I-Thou knowledge does not operate under these conditions. It is direct and unmediated. Katz's detailed and insightful criticism of Buber's philosophy follows entirely from this basis. Any well-founded rejection of Katz's thesis must contend with the over- all effect of the three points listed above. Not only must it bring evidence to the contrary, but the evidence, in relation to Buber's claim, must be a signi- ficant reversal or undercutting of his reliance on some central Kantian posi- tions. It is my claim that Buber's understanding of the I-Thou relation undermines any possible reliance on Kant's metaphysics. Kant's noumena and Buber's Thou are not related as a foundation is to the rest of the edifice, as Katz suggests.7 In other words there is much more to Buber's Thou than a borrowed structural dependence based on Kant's noumena, and this addi- tional aspect outweighs all structural dependencies.8 Buber's Criticism of Kant The way in which to uncover this strictly Buberian aspect of the Thou is through Buber's anti-Kantian statements. A structural analysis, such as the one performed by Katz, is unavailing because it immediately seizes on the dichotomy of reality that seems common to Kant and Buber and then theo- rizes about the content of Buber's ideas based on this structure. A more accurate picture of the content of Buber's ideas might be available at the point at which they diverge and not where they converge, because Buber himself emphasized this divergence. The first element of Buber's rejection of a Kantian position explicitly flies in the face of Katz's assertion. In a discussion about the human being who is able to venture forth to the supreme encounter, Buber makes a telling comment about the world of appearances. 7. Ibid. 8. Katz is most clear about his thoughts on Kant's noumena and Buber's Thou, "In respect of the Thou, Buber's relation to Kant stands at the end of a century of post-Kantian thought that had already well begun the reconstruction of the concept of 'noumena' which it had in- herited. That is to say, in structural if not in all substantive ways Buber's Thou is close to Kant's 'noumena'." Ibid., p. 10.</page><page sequence="4">98 LAWRENCE PERLMAN To this end one does not have to strip away the world of the senses as a world of appearances. There is no world of appearance, there is only the world- which, to be sure, appears twofold to us in accordance with our twofold atti- tude. Only the spell of separation needs to be broken.9 With utmost clarity, Buber informs the reader that he does not uphold a Kantian view of the world. There is no distinct world of appearances over against a noumenal world. Katz's basic assertion concerning the dichotomy of Buber's world-view along Kantian lines is totally unfounded. Moreover, Katz's criticism that Buber, like Kant, denies reality to space-time is entire- ly baseless.'0 Twofoldness," Buber's basic ontological category, does not parallel Kant's noumenal/phenomenal distinction. I do not propose to examine that Buberian concept in full here, but I merely wish to point out that it diverges from Kant's position on a major issue, the reality of the world. Whatever a detailed examination of twofoldness would yield, it could not be mistaken for an ideal construction similar to Kant's noumenal/phe- nomenal construction. Twofoldness is a way of relating and not an act of judgment in consciousness, as it is for Kant. Any attempt to associate Kant and Buber on this point leads to serious misconceptions about Buber's onto- logy and completely misses the point of his attempted rejection of Kantian metaphysics, a point to which I will return. It is of major importance to note that when Buber rejects such a seminal Kantian position he does it for a specific reason. He is informing the reader in no uncertain terms that the supreme encounter, the availability of the 9. Martin Buber, I and Thou, trans. W. Kaufmann (New York: Scribner's, 1970), p. 125. 10. "To probe one step further, let me introduce one additional consideration. It may well be that space-time regulates I-It, but wherein does this spatio-temporal regularity fall? That is to say, imagine that X and Y have an I-It encounter that operates under the Kantian norms, but, in turn, under what regulative conditions do these Kantian norms operate? Put another way, what is the ontic status of the separate particulars that enter into this relationship, as well as of the relational unit as a whole? A simpler way of articulating the logic of this argument is to note that even if space-time and I-It are 'appearances,' surely these 'appearances' are real. If one is not prepared at some point to admit this, then metaphysical confusion ensues. But admitting this breaks the Kantian-Buberian schemata. In other words, denying reality to space-time leads to self-contradiction as well as to the impossibility of establishing objective knowledge, a truth Kant himself seems to have begun to be aware of.... Buber, however, does not consider this and similar difficulties." Katz, pp. 19-20. It should be clear that Buber has not denied reality to space-time, as Katz asserts. In fact he has done the opposite. 11. "The world is TWOFOLD for man in accordance with his twofold attitude. The attitude of man is twofold in accordance with the two basic words he can speak." I and Thou, p. 53.</page><page sequence="5">BUBER'S ANTI-KANTIANISM 99 Eternal Thou, is the motivating concern for the rejection of appearances as epistemological aspects of consciousness.'2 It comes as no surprise, then, that when Buber criticizes the significance of causality in the It-world, in a way that Kant never could (an obvious rejection of Katz's third point), he is doing it for exactly the same reason. He is making a claim on behalf of man's relation to the Eternal Thou. The unlimited sway of causality in the It-world, which is of fundamental importance for the scientific ordering of nature, is not felt to be oppressive by the man who is not confined to the It-world but free to step out of it again and again into the world of relation. Here I and You confront each other freely in a reciprocity that is not involved in or tainted by any causality; here man finds guaranteed the freedom of his being and of being. Only those who know rela- tion and who know of the presence of the You have the capacity for decision. Whoever makes a decision is free because he has stepped before the counte- nance.14 At this juncture we can see that Buber rejects the underpinnings of Kant's world-view when he makes reports about the Eternal Thou. This rejection is not limited to the world of appearances and causality but includes the use of categorical understanding as well. It is fundamental to Kant's undertaking that he demonstrate the categorical manner in which the mind can grasp separate appearances and put them together in one act of knowledge.14 This is the task of categorical laws which provide for con- sciousness the objective connections of what it finds in its experience. Katz assumes that this Kantian doctrine applies equally for Buber.'5 If this were the case, then every claim for the actuality or reality of the objects of our experience that Buber could make would have to include either a reference or a possible reference to the categorical nature of our knowledge. But, this does not seem to be the case. 12. "When one has achieved steadfastness in this state, one is able to venture forth toward the supreme encounter.

Kemp Smith (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1965), p. 111. 15. "In Kant's system the categorical conditions of mind determine the 'phenomenal' nature of things; likewise, in Buber's account, the knower, the I, determines through his 'know- ing' activity whether he 'encounters' reality in all its manifoldness as Thou or as It." Katz, p. 9.</page><page sequence="6">100 LAWRENCE PERLMAN Whoever stands in relation, participates in an actuality; that is, in a being that is neither merely a part of him nor merely outside him. All actuality is an activ- ity in which I participate without being able to appropriate it. Where there is self-appropriation, there is no actuality. The more directly the You is touched, the more perfect is the participation.'6 Buber clearly rejects the idea that relation is a form of knowledge via self- appropriation and therefore of construction. The person in relation cannot have a mental construct of his own at any time. The active participant can- not bring any categories of mind to bear on the situation. There are no laws of understanding which provide objective connections in consciousness. If these did exist, Buber's concept of actuality would cease to apply. This is an unqualified rejection of categorical understanding which no doubt is direct- ed entirely at Kant. Knowledge: as he beholds what confronts him, its being is disclosed to the knower. What he beheld as present he will have to comprehend as an object, compare with objects, assign a place in an order of objects, and describe and analyze objectively; only as an it can it be absorbed into the store of know- ledge. But in the act of beholding it was no thing among things, no event among events; it was present exclusively. It is not in the law that is afterward derived from the appearance but in the appearance itself that the being com- municates itself. That we think the universal is merely an unreeling of the skeinlike event that was beheld in the particular, in a confrontation. And now it is locked into the It-form of conceptual knowledge. Whoever unlocks it and beholds it again as present, fulfills the meaning of that act of knowledge as something that is actual and active between men." Obviously this "unlocking" is a rejection on behalf of relation. According to Buber, something beheld as present in the appearance itself, including the use of the senses, partakes of the Thou. Kant absolutely rejects such claims on behalf of the noumenal."s Buber uses "presence" and "actuality" to 16. 1 and Thou, p. 113. 17. Ibid., pp. 90-91. 18. "The concept of a noumenon is a merely limiting concept, the function of which is to curb the pretensions of sensibility; and it is therefore only of negative employment. At the same time it is no arbitrary invention, and it is bound up with the limitation of sensibility, though it cannot affirm anything positive beyond the field of sensibility." Critique of Pure Reason, A255, B310-311.</page><page sequence="7">BUBER'S ANTI-KANTIANISM 101 convey the point that categorical laws do not yield knowledge of relation. There is a strict limitation in our knowledge of the noumenon according to Kant that clearly does not apply for Buber.'9 What we know in relation is not a matter of how we know, as it is for Kant.20 Presence and actuality for Buber indicate a correlation that they cannot yield for Kant. The limitation of the It-world that is found in Kant's philosophy and applied to the noumenon reverberates in Buber's criticism. While he does not aim his remark directly at Kant, this anonymous man sounds much like Kant, who is, in Buber's words, "reconciled to the It-world as something that is to be experienced and used and who holds down what is tied into it instead of freeing it, who observes it instead of heeding it, and instead of receiving it utilizes it."21 The strength of Buber's rejection and its far-reaching consequences should not be neglected. Buber does not let the point pass into obscurity. In connection to remarks about the Buddha, Buber illustrates the relation of thought to the world. Certainly the world dwells in me as a notion, just as I dwell in it as a thing. But that does not mean that it is in me as I am not in it. The world and I include each other reciprocally. This contradiction for thought, which inheres in the It-relation, is annulled by the You relation which detaches me from the world in order to relate me to it.22 This remark has immediate consequences for Buber's supposed Kantianism. Relation leaves categorical thinking behind. Relation detaches the knower from the world only to bring him back to the world and places no impor- tance on how he knows. The categorical conditions of the mind lose all their significance in the face of a You, just as have all the other seminal Kantian doctrines. This rejection of the categorical conditions of the mind of the knower is not the final aspect of Buber's rejection of Kant. It merely points to a far more significant repudiation. It is a commonplace that Kant formulated his basic problem of knowledge in terms of the synthetic a priori. Kant wanted 19. Ibid., A256, B312 and A260, B315. 20. Katz, p. 9. 21. I and Thou, p. 90. 22. Ibid., pp. 141-142. Kaufmann applies these remarks to Schopenhauer.</page><page sequence="8">102 LAWRENCE PERLMAN to know how synthetic a priori judgments were possible. Believing that the principle of causality was neither self-evident nor capable of logical demon- stration, Kant argued for the acceptance of a priori synthetic judgments as the criteria which are capable of determining the validity or invalidity of general principles.23 In other words, Kant tried to determine the necessity and strict universality of knowledge apart from experience. Without any doubt whatsoever, Buber's disavowal of synthetic judgments would point to a wholesale rejection of Kant's architectonic. If judgments cannot be thought synthetically, then we have no basis to say that Buber is Kantian in any meaningful sense. This Buberian disavowal is made clearly and forthrightly. In a discussion of situation and presence, not unlike that which we saw concerning categori- cal thinking,24 Buber rejects the possibility of an act of synthesis. Not only does he distinctly do this, but he does this while criticizing Kant. He uses Kant's own language to attack Kant's position, not to adopt it. It is well worth quoting this long passage in its entirety. Man's "religious" situation, existence in the presence, is marked by its essen- tial and indissoluble antinomies. That these antinomies are indissoluble con- stitutes their very essence. Whoever affirms the thesis and repudiates the antithesis violates the sense of the situation. Whoever tries to think a synthesis destroys the sense of the situation. Whoever would settle the conflict between antinomies by some means short of his own life transgresses against the sense of the situation. It is to be lived in all of its antinomies-only lived-and lived ever again, ever anew, unpredictably, without any possibility of anticipation or prescription. A comparison of the religious and the philosophical antinomy will make this clearer. Kant can relativize the philosophical conflict of free- dom and necessity by relegating the latter to the world of appearance and the former to that of being, so that the two positions no longer really oppose one another as well as do the two worlds in which each is valid. But when I mean freedom and necessity not in the worlds that are thought of but in the actuality in which I stand before God; when I know, "It depends on me," then I may not try to escape from the paradox I have to live by relegating the irreconcila- ble propositions to two separate realms; neither may I seek the aid of some 23.

See n. 17 and following.</page><page sequence="9">BUBER'S ANTI-KANTIANISM 103 theological artifice to attain some conceptual reconciliation: I must take it upon myself to live both in one, and lived both are one.25 The content of this passage is illuminating in many respects, but the clear rejection of Kant's position is foremost. According to Buber, Kant's synthe- tic thinking cannot be used as an escape to two separate realms, the pheno- menal and the noumenal, nor can it do away with the antinomies of our experience. There is no Kantian relativization which synthesizes our knowl- edge in Buberian terms. Clearly a Kantian synthesis cannot describe the paradox "I have to live" and by extension cannot be applied to the world of I-It or I-Thou. Also of major importance is the fact that this rejection of Kant by Buber turns, once again, on the ability of the individual, who can mean "freedom and necessity not in the world that are thought of but in the actuality in which I stand before God." God, or the Eternal Thou, is the being whose presence constantly disrupts and renders meaningless the Kantian form of knowledge and superstructure. As the texts themselves indicate, an analysis of knowledge, in the case of Buber, ought to begin with such concepts as "presence," "situation," and "actuality" because they clearly determine the limits of what the individual can know. The attempt to place an ill-fitting superstructure on Buber's epistemology misconceives his point of view. Clearly, meaning for Buber is not based on a logical judgment within a Kantian architectonic, but on an existential decision "to go forth" to one's Thou. This point cannot be underscored enough. A careful reading of the texts sustains the correctness of this interpretation. The point that Professor Katz has so steadfastly clung to, the identifying of Kant's phenomenal/noumenal distinction with Buber's I-It and I-Thou reality, is dealt with by Buber himself. His words stand in total opposition to this identification. There is only the one flood from the I to the You, ever more infinite, the one boundless flood of actual life. One cannot divide one's life between an actual relationship to God and inactual I-It relationship to the world-praying to God in truth and utilizing the world. Whoever knows the world as something to be utilized knows God the same way. His prayers are a way of unburdening himself-and fall into the ears of the void. He-and not the "atheist" who 25. I and Thou, pp. 143-144.</page><page sequence="10">104 LAWRENCE PERLMAN from the night and longing of his garret window addresses the nameless-is godless.26 There is no dichotomy in Buber's epistemology in the sense in which Kant incorporated one into his description of knowledge. The distinction of the phenomenal and noumenal worlds ultimately collapses for Buber, not in consciousness, but in actual life with God. The Basis of Buber's Epistemology My analysis of Buber's remarks concerning Kant demonstrates that Buber is clearly trying to reverse Kant's thinking about the noumenon. Whereas for Kant we can have no knowledge of a supreme Subject, Buber is distinctly allowing for that possibility through relation. As I have demon- strated, the awareness of a supreme Presence is at the heart of each one of his rejections of a fundamental Kantian position. This is the one point of diver- gence that Katz sees between Kant and Buber. He recognizes that Buber has used a form of nonsensible intuition that Kant will not allow.27 But he sees in this usage a desire to be Kantian and more than a Kantian at the same time,28 and not a desire to reject basic Kantian doctrines. The preceding section has shown that a responsible analysis of Buber's position must begin with his rejection of Kantian idealism and his use of existential relations such as "presence," "situation," and "actuality." Even as knowledgeable a critic as Katz has noticed that Buber has transmuted Kant's form of "non-sensible intuition,"29 but he has not been able to pro- duce an explanation for this divergence. In fact, he constantly criticizes Buber for a blind acceptance of Kant's epistemology. The evidence mar- shaled here demonstrates that a vast amount of that criticism is misdirected because Buber has not proposed a dialogical synthesis to parallel Kant's synthesis. If my thesis is correct, then it remains for me to explain how Buber thought he was overcoming the dichotomy of I-It and I-Thou relations. 26. Ibid., p. 156. 27. Katz, p. 19. 28. Ibid. 29. Ibid.</page><page sequence="11">BUBER'S ANTI-KANTIANISM 105 This demonstration would have to include two major aspects to satisfy both intuitional and epistemological needs. In other words, it must point to an aspect of Buber's dialogue in which God and man can possibly relate to each other as nonsensible subjects. Before I draw this final conclusion I would like to remind the reader that I am not rejecting the claims Katz and others have made against the contentless nature of revelation according to Buber. I accept them and do not consider anything that I have to offer as a correction of that problem. If anything, I would point to greater ambiguities than Buber and others seem to have been aware of in relation to this issue. Buber's attempt to overcome any latent Kantianism in his position and an inherent dichotomy in reality has to be found in his report of the Eternal Thou, God. Each and every criticism of Kant that Buber levels points to the ability of God to do something in relation to us that is not possible for Kant's noumenon or phenomenon in consciousness. Buber's report about God is not at all similar to Kant's description of the "thing in itself." Buber makes this entirely clear. Unfortunately he does it in only one sentence. Amidst an explanation of the exclusivity of actual relationships in the world, Buber says of the Eternal Thou, "In the relation to God, unconditional exclusiveness and unconditional inclusiveness are one."30 In relation to God there is no inside nor is there an outside. God is capable of retaining, in per- fect relation, all things in their own being, as they are in themselves. God is wholly other and wholly same according to Buber.3' It is Buber's opinion that God's presence is unlike any other presence. It maintains its distance and the proximity of its subjectivity in relation, without favoring one over the other;32 God's presence is a dipolar event. In it, there is no way the par- ticulars as such retain their importance apart from the relation.33 This report by Buber is only half of his position. Clearly Buber does not produce an explanation or an argument on behalf of this point. Any such attempt would be beside the point for Buber. But, on the other side of the 30. I and Thou, p. 127. 31.

This way of indicating the encounter has not been seriously consi- dered and has remained buried as an obscure remark. When considering and rejecting the possibility of an ideal description of the I-Thou encounter, Buber momentarily turns his attention away from the It-world toward the Thou. All this has its place in the It-world and does not take us one step-out of it. Going forth is unteachable in the sense of prescriptions. It can only be indicat- ed-by drawing a circle that excludes everything else. Then the one thing need- ful becomes visible: the total acceptance of the present.34 This text illuminates the central problem of Buber's epistemology. No intel- lectual prescription, not even a Kantian one, can capture the nature of an I-Thou encounter. But there is one way in which it can be indicated, accord- ing to Buber. The drawing of a circle excluding everything else that is not part of the encounter somehow indicates the encounter. Several things must be recognized immediately. This is surely an epis- temological claim. Second, it describes knowledge exclusively in terms of a circle. Third, presence, since it is circular and not chainlike, cannot have a deductive character. Presence cannot be approached as a hierarchical chain of a deductive or inductive sort. What does all this mean? It means that Buber claims to see something in the circle that is prior to experience (not part of the It-world) and is neither logical nor necessary in its structure. It is best indicated as a recognition of a pattern. Some things help to form the pattern and some things are extraneous to it, but the extraneous things help to establish a limit or boundary for the pattern even though they are not part of the pattern proper. This is the meaning of the organic image, in which the parts of the circumference of the circle, while not part of the encounter itself, point to what is included in that presence. When the indi- vidual goes forth to the relation, he draws a circle around his reality, as it were, to indicate, but not to grasp, his Thou. This solution by Buber stands in absolute opposition to Kant's transcendental schema, which must retain a deductive categorical nature.3 34. Ibid., p. 126. 35. On this point see Kemp Smith, pp. 332-342. I am in agreement with Katz on this issue as it applies to Kant. I think that the transcendental deduction cannot be performed. Katz, p. 18.</page><page sequence="13">BUBER'S ANTI-KANTIANISM 107 This explanation of the roots of Buber's epistemology leaves one major problem unsolved but perhaps in clearer perspective. In rejecting Kant's idealism and its attending architectonic, Buber has opted for an existential dialogue. His distrust of synthetic knowledge has led him to an epistemology that bypasses every known description of content. He could possibly main- tain a consistent view of consciousness were it not for what makes his view of dialogue so anti-Kantian. He has done more than reject categorical understanding. In his attempt to widen the scope of knowledge that allows for direct nonsensible intuition of God, Buber has rejected any understand- ing that requires any categorically or sensibly determined intellectual con- tent. From the point of view of the individual in the relation, he cannot impart anything in the relation. Yet the focusing of the attention of the individual is to be included as an aspect of the relation, if we are to take seriously his image of the circle. Herein lies the greatest ambiguity of Buber's view of dialogue. Moreover, that focusing cannot be taught. Buber might have taken the position that it could not be taught because relation was inherently unteachable. He seems to think this is what he has done. But this is certainly not the only unusual facet of his dialogical philosophy. He has asserted that the drawing of a circle is a bona fide way of indicating the I-Thou encounter. A circle includes some content and excludes some other content. Any focusing of attention indicates a reliance on what Buber would call the It-world, because it implies a selecting of objects or experiences based on some view of content. But according to his own criteria, Buber thinks he has indicated a form of dialogue that cannot be taught because there is no specific content peculiar to it, there is nothing specific to teach. While he may have seen these as positive features, they risk collapse into a chaos that would render his dialogue a meaningless gesture. Most impor- tantly for our inquiry, these features of his dialogical philosophy point to the fact that Buber is thoroughly critical of Kant's metaphysics. In no way does he assume the essential validity of Kant's architectonic and use that archi- tectonic as "the a priori theoretical constellation of the dialogical struc- ture."36 My examination of Buber leads in an entirely different direction. It points to the assumption in Buberian dialogue that beliefs, concepts, gram- matical rules, and linguistic practices are not part of the relationship to an I. These are all elements of the It relation, or of experience which is never part 36. Katz, p. 18.</page><page sequence="14">108 LAWRENCE PERLMAN of a continuum with the Thou relation. The dichotomy of It and Thou must always be fully retained if Buber's thought is to be consistent. On the other hand this dichotomy leads not to a systematic use of the Kantian architec- tonic, but to a Schleiermachian dependence on intuition." Any reading of Buber that disregards his anti-Kantianism and his reliance on intuition will subvert the existential elements of Buber's dialogue, which bypass the con- stituitive Kantian mode of knowing. To attempt to read Buber as a Kantian and then bewail his lack of systematic thinking does little to explicate the significance of the dialogical principle, no matter how flawed we may ulti- mately think it is.
