<plain_text><page sequence="1">Azzan Yadin. Scripture as Logos: Rabbi Ishmael and the Origins of Midrash. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004. xiii, 231 pp. Although it is a truism that there are fundamental methodological differ- ences between the Ishmaelean and Aqiban schools of halakhic midrash, scholars have struggled to find a larger framework that explains the reasons for these diver- gences. Azzan Yadin has rendered an important service by proposing an overarch- ing theory of hermeneutics that encompasses and informs the Ishmaelean approach to legal midrash. What follows is a brief summary and assessment of Yadin's line of argument. Yadin's first two tasks, in the preface and introduction, are to demonstrate that there are, in fact, two schools of thought regarding halakhic midrash and to argue that, regardless of whether halakhic midrash creates law or simply pro- vides a scriptural basis for existing halakhot ex post facto, it should be taken seriously as a hermeneutical enterprise. Chapter 1 begins Yadin's discussion of Ishmaelean exegetical methodology, in which he proposes that the terms torah and ha-katuv are not synonymous in Ishmaelean midrash; they represent the static voice of scripture on the one hand (torah) and the active interpretive scriptural voice on the other (ha-katuv). The reader's role, often indicated in the formula shome 'a ani, is to attend passively to the text (chapter 2). This means, Yadin explains in chapter 3, that scripture contains within itself a self-interpret- ing voice that guides and limits human interpretation of scripture, creating a "hermeneutic of submission." Chapter 4 demonstrates that, according to the Ishmaelean school, ha-katuv not only guides the reader in the interpretation of specific verses but also models some of the middot, that is, the interpretive methods to be used in general. Thus, according to a passage in Sifre Numbers, par. 24-at least according to Yadin's understanding of this very opaque text-the seemingly extraneous words in Numbers 6:4 are, in fact, meant to teach the principle of kelal u-ferat, to wit: If a general statement is followed by a specific instance, then the range of the verse is limited to the specific instance mentioned. In chapter 5, after refuting the traditional ascription of the thirteen methods of scriptural interpretation to R. Ishmael, Yadin establishes the main function of middot in Ishmaelean exegesis as limiting interpretation rather than facilitating it. To return to the example of 199</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews kelal u-ferat, this middah directs the reader to interpret a seemingly expansive statement of scripture much more narrowly. Chapter 6 is devoted to proving that, at times, ha-katuv is "presponsive," that is, the text anticipates a potential incorrect interpretation of itself and warns the reader against adopting it. The final chapters, 7 and 8, suggest that the school of Ishmael privileged the self-interpreting written Torah over the oral tra- dition, explaining why relatively few Ishmaelean traditions are found in the Mishnah, Tosefta, and beraitot. He argues further that there is some affinity between Ishmaelean halakhah and that of Qumran. Finally, he daringly suggests a link between the Ishmaelean ha-katuv and the Logos tradition, a tradition found in Second Temple Jewish writings and developed in the patristic tradition of Christos Didaskalos, Christ the Teacher. Clement of Alexandria develops this notion that both the Old and New Testaments are authored by the Logos, but the true meaning of the Old Testament is accessible only through the New Tes- tament, which is an expression of the Word becoming flesh. In similar fashion, Yadin argues, for the school of Ishmael, scripture in its manifestation of ha-katuv illuminates scripture in its manifestation as torah. The preceding precis cannot do justice to the care and erudition with which Yadin makes his case. Yadin excels in his knowledge and use of literary theory, with which he is intimately familiar, to explain Ishmaelean exegesis and midrash halakhah in general. Particularly helpful is his reference to Umberto Eco's notion of the "model reader" (95-96) to explain the relationship and interaction between the divine text and the human reader in the Ishmaelean interpretive process. Moreover, Yadin's approach constitutes a quantum leap forward in the study of halakhic midrash, offering original and often compelling solutions to many diffi- culties that have long plagued scholars. Two in particular deserve specific mention. The conventional explanation of the minimalist orientation of Ishmaelean midrash is that it is the result of a more literal approach to scriptural exegesis. A major problem with this thesis is that the interpretation offered by the Ishmae- leans is often no closer to the text's literal meaning than that of the Aqiban school. Yadin argues that the minimalism of Ishmaelean midrash results from its careful attention to how scripture interprets itself. The resulting midrash may or may not be literal; for Yadin, the point is that it is contextually sensitive because it is fundamentally based on reading one verse in terms of one or more others. Second, scholars have long wondered whether the paucity of Ishmaelean traditions in the Mishnah and Tosefta are simply the result of their origins in the school of R. Aqiba or whether there simply was no Ishmalean Mishnah. By showing the centrality of inner-biblical exegesis (to use Michael Fishbane's term) for R. Ishmael, Yadin can plausibly argue that the mishnaic style of citing oral traditions, whose authority seems to derive from their rabbinic promulgators or tradents rather than from scripture, was totally foreign to the Ishmaelean school. In the spirit of constructive criticism, a number of flaws in Yadin's work should be mentioned. The first involves his interpretation of rabbinic texts. In some cases, his reading of passages, though possible, seems unlikely. There is no reason to assume, for example, that Mekhilta's claim that Exodus 21:9 "comes to teach regarding [categories of liability in the case of assault] that had 200</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews been [previously] omitted" means, as Yadin claims, that the verse is instructing the reader in hermeneutical methodology rather than simply supplying halakhic infor- mation (127). Moreover, given his careful and incisive reading of numerous rab- binic texts, it is surprising and disappointing that he explains a number of rabbinic terms and phrases incorrectly. Thus, for example, a tevulyom is not "[one who has been] ritually immersed in water and then purified by the setting of the sun" (159) but rather someone in a state of partial purity obtained after immersion but before sunset. Yadin also errs in his interpretations of the bekhor sacrifice (90), the term 'akhilat za 'ar (122), and, contrary to Geiger, ben shel kayama (157-58). Second, Yadin's suggestion that, for the school or R. Ishmael, ha-katuv is "personified, instructing Scripture" analogous to Wisdom in Ben-Sira and Christ in the Christos Disdaskalos tradition, though fascinating and attractive, is less than compelling. He is undoubtedly right that Ishmaelean midrash uses torah and ha-katuv contrastively rather than as synonyms. However, alongside Yadin's proposal that ha-katuv and torah represent two different manifestations of scripture, one must consider the far more prosaic but equally plausible possi- bility that the difference between these terms is technical, not theological. The first usually refers to an entire pericope or to scripture as a whole, whereas the second refers to a particular verse (as in the exegetical method of "two verses [ketuvim] that contradict each other until the third verse [katuv] comes and adju- dicates between them"). This does not necessarily negate Yadin' s thesis that scrip- ture is largely self-interpreting for the Ishmaelean school, but it does raise serious questions about whether this exegetical assumption carries with it the ideological and theological significance suggested by Yadin. These, however, are relatively minor shortcomings in a work that is a model of meticulous research and lucid exposition. Anyone interested in rabbinic litera- ture should eagerly await Yadin's promised study of Aqiban midrash. Eliezer Diamond Jewish Theological Seminary of America New York, New York</page></plain_text>
