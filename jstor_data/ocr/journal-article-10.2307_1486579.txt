Tel Aviv and Jerusalem: Am Oved and Magnes Press, 1990. viii, 124 pp. (Hebrew).</page><page sequence="2">286 BOOK REVIEWS The short novella of Ruth is a special book. The scroll contains explicit references to many other biblical episodes, such as the story of Tamar (Gen. 38) and the famine in Abraham's day that caused his migration to a foreign land (Gen. 12:10) (on this issue see further below), as well as allusions to the "capable wife" of Proverbs (31:10-31). How should we read these references: do they convey a specific message, or are they employed for decoration, submitting an archaic flavor? Then the form of the composition raises questions regarding its literary genre: is it a historical novella, or is it a folkloristic tale similar to the prosaic framework of the Book of Job? Naturally, readers are concerned with the function of the scroll; how should we interpret the place and role of the Davidic genealogy at the conclusion? The focus on Ruth, the daughter of the hated Moabites, who becomes the great-grandmother of David himself, is not unproblematic. How should we accept David's disturbing origin, considering the Deuteronomic law which prohibits marrying Moabites (Deut. 23:7-8) and Ezra's demand to abominate them (Ezra 9:1, Neh. 13:1)? Furthermore, the scroll is occupied with the complex laws of redemption and levirate marriage, providing a striking opportunity for researchers to study the practice of the law against its legal formulation (Deut. 25:5-10). Then critics argue about the function of the Davidic genealogy at the conclusion of the scroll. This issue depends on the dating of Ruth. Does a postexilic date reflect a polemic against Ezra's insistence on divorcing the foreign women, claiming its absurdity vis-a-vis Ruth and her great-grandson David? However, a preexilic date might point to an effort to clear David's name against certain rumors regarding his foreign origin. In brief, the short story of Ruth invites many critical considerations regarding its problematic issues. A new commentary on Ruth is thus a rejoiceful scholarly event that might throw fresh light on the old problems. The book under review opens with a long introduction-almost one-third of the volume-intending, we may expect, to respond to the various critical issues of the scroll. Indeed, the author discusses specific topics, starting with the literary character of the scroll. He submits to the traditional view regarding it as a romantic idyll. The characters are idyllic, wonderful people who want to fulfill the law, not only literally, but as a way of life. Nevertheless, perhaps due to the restrictions of space, Zakovitch does not discuss the complex attitude of the people of Bethlehem toward Naomi and her daughter-in-law. At the end, the redeemer is forced to take the legal act that paved the road for the marriage of Boaz and Ruth. Naomi's two relatives, Boaz and "Mr. so and so," let the old woman and</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 287 her daughter-in-law reach a level of hunger, until they are pushed by Ruth's desperate deed to pursue the appropriate legal action, thus relieving both women of their agony. There is a tense drama behind the scenes, covered, however, by the pleasant dialogue. Zakovitch's discussion regarding the characters is informative. He sheds light on Naomi's central role. He points out the scroll's emphasis on Naomi's new status: "a son is born to Naomi" (4:17). This is a crucial issue regarding the meaning of the scroll and the Judean woman's place versus the Moabite's. Naomi is the mother? An unusual reference, indeed. Zakovitch calls attention to the exceptional situation, stressing that the son's birth is not connected to the father, as is usually the case, but oddly enough to the mother-in-law (p. 115). How should we read this? Could it be, one asks, a hint that at the end the Moabite natural mother is replaced after fulfilling her duty to give a son and a name to the old, now childless, Judean widow? Then, may the suspicious reader reach the conclusion that David, the king of Israel, was raised by the Judean Naomi and not by a Moabite? However, Zakovitch does not elaborate on the meaning of Naomi's unusual role. Zakovitch devotes a significant chapter to the place of the female charac- ters in the scroll. He sheds light on their extraordinary power (pp. 8-9). Why are the women of the scroll so dominant? Is there validity in S. Sandmel's speculation (The Enjoyment of Scripture [New York, 1972], p. 25) that the unknown author of the scroll was a woman? Zakovitch prefers to present the facts without exposition. The discussion regarding the poetic flavor of the scroll is illuminating (pp. 10-11). Zakovitch stresses the rhetorical function of poetical verses such as 1:13, 1:20-21, 2:19, etc., rejecting the thesis of an earlier poetic version of the scroll. Each poetic verse, claims Zakovitch, must be studied in its literary context, with the goal of elucidating its specific rhetorical function. Zakovitch adopts the position of a postexilic date for the Book of Ruth. He then argues his case regarding the function of the scroll (pp. 18-20). He points to a number of passages in the Book of Ruth that hint at David (pp. 32-33), and he accepts the view that the novella represents a polemical argument against Ezra's determination that the foreign wives be divorced. Ruth, however, provides an outstanding example that possesses unique moral and national-religious features. The determination of the quality of the foreign women depends not on their ethnic background, but on their deeds. Zakovitch includes a useful discussion on the relationship between the scroll and other biblical scenes (pp. 24-33). The comparison with Gen. 12:10</page><page sequence="4">288 BOOK REVIEWS has a specific implication regarding the thematic development of the scroll. Zakovitch calls attention to the similarity between Ruth 1:1 and the Genesis parallel, though he does not elaborate on this comparison. But there is a significant difference between the wording in Genesis and that of Ruth. The Genesis passage emphasizes that the famine "was severe," an exclusive elaboration that may justify Abraham's migration to a foreign land. That is to say, Elimelech of Bethlehem did not have such an excuse to leave his land. Therefore, the tragedy was unavoidable. In conclusion, this fresh volume is a fine addition to the study of the scroll of Ruth. Zakovitch defines the scroll as an idyllic story, and both his remarks and his exegesis are presented in coherent, pleasant, and smooth language. This volume is part of a new Hebrew series, which aims to integrate the Jewish scholarly tradition with current critical research. Zakovitch blends these two streams in a fine manner, though his reliance on the traditional Jewish exegetical material is more sporadic than systematic. As I have hinted above, in certain ways Zakovitch offers only a preliminary study of Ruth. My hope is that he will return to this subject with further elaboration on the thematic and structural complexities of Ruth's remarkable story.
