<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gennady Estraikh. In Harness. Yiddish Writers' Romance with Communism. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2005. 242 pp. The year 1926 was a very good year ... if you were a Yiddish writer passio- nate about communism. By that year, the communist utopia had turned the corner economically and socially, making the Soviet Union increasingly attractive to those who believed in a revolutionary future. The Soviet Union in 1926 was also a great place to be a socialist Jew, as the state had lifted all prerevolutionary restrictions on Jews' movement, employment, education, and residence while pro- viding financial and political support to a whole network of Jewish social, cultural, and political institutions. Yiddish writers who had left Russia after the devastation of world war, civil war, revolutionary war, and ideological war began to trickle back. They saw the Soviet Union as a place where a Yiddish writer had respect, could earn a living, and had the power of the state at his fingertips (yes, it was pri- marily men's fingertips doing the communist Yiddish writing). As the title of Gennady Estraikh's study of communist Yiddish writers in the "good years" of 1917-35 shows, these writers were "in harness," strapped down 222</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews and ready for the wild ride of revolution. As Estraikh also shows, however, they were also "in harness" in that they were bound up in an ideological and political revolution that limited these writers' literary horizons as much as it liberated them. And the title of Estraikh's book? The year 1926 saw the launching of In Harness, the literary and political journal that Yiddish prose writer David Bergelson started in Berlin. Estraikh's meticulously researched book charts the paths of Yiddish writers, most of whom came from Ukraine, Russia, and Belorussia, who began their careers poor and sometimes marginalized and ended up at the pinnacle of commu- nist power in the Soviet Union. The "grandfather" of this group of writers, Bergel- son, participated in the roller-coaster ride of communist Yiddish literature from its earliest days in small writers' circles in prerevolutionary Kiev to the giant Union of Soviet Writers' conferences of the 1930s that celebrated the beauty of socialist realist writing and the wisdom of Stalin's policies. Ironically, Bergelson, this icon of communist Yiddish writing, the man often credited with being the master of such divergent aesthetic literary styles as impressionism and socialist realism, lived outside the motherland from 1921 until his "repatriation" in late 1933. Estraikh points out that the movement of communist Yiddish writers was international and that these writers became part of an ideological diaspora far from the homeland in Moscow. In Harness, though, primarily explores the history of Yiddish writers in the Soviet Union, who formed the backbone of a state-sponsored cultural movement to create a new socialist Jewish culture in the Jews' native language, Yiddish. The state supported the cultures of all Soviet ethnic groups, from Tatars and Chuvash to Jews and Poles. But Jews were some of the biggest recipients of state cultural support in the Soviet Union during the 1920s and 1930s, when a network of Yiddish writers' groups, theaters, and other cultural insti- tutions spread throughout the country. The state even created a Soviet Jewish homeland near the Soviet border with China, called Birobidzhan, which some Yiddish writers pictured as a land flowing with milk and honey and simultaneously rivaling European capitals for its beauty and modernity. (Estraikh calls these images a fantasyland.) The number of Yiddish writers who partici- pated in the project of building Soviet Jewish culture in Yiddish was never large, but their vision of a secular Jewish future was powerful and serves as significant example of twentieth-century Jewry trying to envision itself as a nation, not a religious group. Estraikh's book relies on new archival material and is intended for those who study Jewish history-those for whom this chapter of Jewish literary pro- duction is often forgotten and who need to be reminded that the history of Jews in the Soviet Union is not simply the story of one form of anti-Semitism after another. The short biographies of dozens of writers and details about in-fighting among literary groups might wear on the casual reader, as will the typos and the historical and literary terms that frequently could use more explanation. Estraikh states, for example, "It is illuminating that the literary department of the Shtern was for some time edited by the Moscow-based Kushnirov and Wieviorka" (109). He does not explain why it is illuminating. 223</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews The book's power lies in the story of these writers' romance with commun- ism and in Estraikh's willingness to take 1930s socialist realist Yiddish literature seriously. Estraikh reads socialist realist Yiddish literature as a return to a nineteenth-century realist Yiddish literary genre, known as shund or "trash" litera- ture. It was simple, moralistic, and usually had a happy ending. Most Yiddish literary historians simply erase the period from Jewish literary history. Estraikh could have strengthened the book had he spent more time engaging the work of scholars who study more general trends in socialist realism, the 1930s Stalinist cultural movement that challenged and, according to some, outdid the avant-garde in seeing literature as a powerful tool for shaping the world. Although his understanding of Yiddish socialist realism is a contribution to Yiddish literary studies, Estraikh falls back on an older understanding of socialist realism, which saw it as a sharp break with avant-garde experimentation and a return to nineteenth-century realism. Whether Estraikh meant to challenge the more current trend in Soviet literary studies, which more often sees socialist realism as a development of the avant-garde's will to power rather than simply a return to nineteenth-century style, is not clear. It would help the reader to see how Estraikh situates himself in these debates. Estraikh not only falls back on traditional explanations of 1930s literature, but he also explains communist Yiddish culture rather traditionally. The last chapter of In Harness argues that, at its core, communist Yiddish literature was "national in form," by which those who coined the phrase meant that it was in the Yiddish language, and "socialist in content," in that the story lines, characters, and messages of the literature were universally Soviet. The phrase has often been used as a way of dismissing the artistic value of this literature, suggesting that communist writers simply followed a preordained rubric for pro- ducing literature. Again, scholars working on Soviet culture have shown that it is too simple to say that there was some universal Soviet culture that was written in different languages (especially if we include socialist writers around the world). Rather, each Soviet culture had its own vision of the Soviet future, its own stories, characters, and nuances. Jewish writers, for example, relied on biblical imagery, nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century Yiddish litera- ture, and other particularly Jewish intertextual references, whereas other ethnic groups would have relied on different literary and cultural histories. Estraikh himself undermines the national-in-form, socialist-in-content argument by suggesting links between socialist realism and shund literature. Had Estraikh spent more time on literary analysis of the poems, stories, plays, and novels written by his romantics, the reader would have seen how Soviet this literature was and also how Jewish it was. Estraikh could have ended his story in 1935 and left the reader with the romance of Yiddish writers and communism, but he chose tragedy, which should come as no surprise because romances usually end tragically. This romance ended "tragically," according to Estraikh, because passionate, creative, avant-garde writers became producers of "trash" literature and because many of them were killed by the very state that had supported their literary efforts. Estraikh ends with a haunting meditation on tragedy by the poet Itsik Fefer, one of the most 224</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews politically powerful Soviet Yiddish writers. For Fefer, romance becomes tragedy not with death, but with being forgotten. In 1946, he wrote in his poem "Epitaph," When I remain on my own with the naked earth, when the Jewish cemetery takes my old bones, I hope a passer-by, noticing my fence and seeing the grass which grows from my body, will tell the living wind: He was a mensch. He served his people. Like Fefer, Estraikh hopes that someone will take notice of this piece of Jewish history, of these writers who believed passionately that they served their people.
