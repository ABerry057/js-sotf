Mohr, 1992. iv, 161 pp. Michael Sachs (1808-1864) was a representative of that middle current in nineteenth-century German Judaism whose best-known representative was Zacharias Frankel and which also included such figures as Isaac Noah Mannheimer in Vienna and Manuel Joel in Breslau. Despite his importance as the first university-educated rabbi to be employed by the Berlin Jewish community, the largest in Germany, Sachs has received little attention, especially in recent years. Sachs was neither a halakhist nor an original scholar of the modem variety. He certainly knew Jewish law well, but he did not write on halakhic subjects. He was a trained philologist, but he lacked the acumen of truly creative and erudite scholars like Abraham Geiger and Leopold Zunz. His writings served a different purpose. Sachs was determined to recapture for modern readers, Christian and Jewish, the much-neglected poetic heritage of the Jews. In volumes that enjoyed considerable popularity, he translated and interpreted the religious poetry of medieval Spanish Jewry and rendered into his own verse stories taken from midrashim and other postbiblical Jewish sources. In moving the focus from halakhah to aggadah, from historical criticism to empathic literary appreciation, Sachs appealed broadly to a Jewish community that was divided between Orthodox and Reformers. His romanticism could encompass all. As a preacher, too, Sachs enthused over the Jewish tradition's great literary treasures. In Berlin, he drew large crowds to lengthy, well-crafted sermons, delivered with a verve which flowed freely from his ebullient personality. When he came to Berlin from a conservatively reformed congregation in Prague in 1844, Sachs was the choice of the moderates in a community that had long been severely riven. Immediately, he tried to institute modest reforms (a choir, a few German prayers, elimination of repetitions in the liturgy), but he met with opposition. Nor could his polemics suppress the radical Reform Congregation, which had been formed in 1845 partly in reaction to his election, and whose rabbi, Samuel Holdheim, represented his polar opposite. Sachs was the poetic, romantic, harmonious personality who sought continuity through idealization of the Jewish heritage; Holdheim was the prosaic dialectician who insisted on seeing clearly the sharp differences between past and present and in drawing the radical conclusions. When</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 273 Holdheim died, Sachs for a time resigned his position rather than tolerate Holdheim's burial in the Berlin Jewish cemetery's row of honor. Sachs himself died young, at the age of fifty-six. His papers were preserved in the Jewish community archives and eventually made their way to Jerusalem. The authors of the present volume have made use of unpublished letters in these neglected papers and given us a more complete picture of Sachs than we possessed heretofore. Their biographical, illustrated study is well-written and mostly accurate. They relate the personal and public life and evaluate the significance of their subject. But they have erred on the side of generosity. Sachs's poems were not of high artistic value. Even so great an admirer of Sachs as Heinrich Graetz (who was once his student) praised his personality and his homiletics but had to admit that "in his life and instruction there was more poetry than in his verses." Nor was Sachs, as the authors claim, "the first modern rabbi." By the time he began his rabbinical duties in Prague in 1836, Geiger, Frankel, and others were already serving in Jewish communities. One also wishes that the authors had gone about their task more comparatively, contrasting Sachs's sermons with those of his contemporaries, the prayerbooks he edited with others appearing during the same years. Still, one must be grateful to Franz Lucas and Heike Frank for bringing back into view a figure who in his own way, if unsuccessfully, sought to hold the center against the rising tide of division. After his death, the Berlin community's leadership, which since the election of 1854 had been controlled by liberals and reformers, chose two liberal rabbis in close succession: Joseph Aub and Abraham Geiger. The result, in 1869, was the formation of the separatist Orthodox community, Adass Jisroel. For all his efforts as writer and preacher, Sachs had been unable to halt the increasing separation. His position too was only one possibility among others. If Holdheim is today better remembered than Sachs despite Sachs's greater popularity in his own time, it may be, as Max Wiener has suggested, because Holdheim uncompromisingly laid out the issues, which Sachs's poetry and rhetoric could neither dissolve nor bring to resolution.
