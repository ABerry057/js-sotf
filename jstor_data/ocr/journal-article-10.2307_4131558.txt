Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1999. xi, 463 pp. In this monumental book, Paul Heger attempts to explain how synagogue recital of biblical texts replaced the sacrificial cult (p. 366). He posits that gradual disaffection with the Temple enabled the rabbis to institute synagogue ritual for sacrifice even while the second Temple stood. The work is wide-ranging, yet fo- cused, and provides a detailed history of the cult from the Bronze Age until the de- struction of the second Temple. The first half is a diachronic study of the three bib- lical altar laws. The second half investigates the impact of Ahaz, Josiah, Ezra and Nehemiah, the Maccabees, and finally the rabbis on attitudes toward temple sac- rifice. Perhaps it is unavoidable in a work which spans the time from the Bronze Age to the Rabbinic period that much is left out. Heger relies heavily on a Persian period dating for P, and does not attempt to engage other views.1 The three bibli- cal altar laws Heger refers to are Exod. 20: 24-26 (which he mysteriously refers to as vs. 21-23), Deut. 27: 2-8, especially 4-7, and Exod. 27:1-8. He assumes these laws were known by the populace and binding on them. He does not discuss Westbrook's work (nor the large amount written generally on the role of law codes in the ancient Near East) that suggests law codes were confined to scribal schools.2 Heger argues for a progressive weakening in lay attachment to the sacrificial cult. Ahaz instituted the first step when he substituted the bronze altar (a pre- sentation altar) by a great altar for burnt offerings (2 Kings 16: 10-16). Prior to Ahaz, altars throughout Israel were for presentation offerings only; burnt offerings were made on an ad hoc basis (p. 262). Ahaz encouraged burnt-offering altars in the towns, and instituted a regular daily burnt-offering ritual in the temple (p. 264). This reform changed the relationship between the deity and the people-it forev- er removed the theological necessity of feeding the god. Heger derives evidence for Ahaz's inauguration of burnt-offering sacrifices from two sources. The first source is the biblical text. The description of Solomon's temple does not mention a burnt-offering altar, so there was none in the temple pri- 1. Several scholars have argued recently that P is early and precedes D (the many articles and books by A. Hurvitz; I. Knohl, The Sanctuary of Silence: The Priestly Torah and the Holiness School, Augsburg Fortress Press, Minneapolis, 1995, J. Milgrom, Leviticus, Anchor Bible Commentary, Dou- bleday, New York, 1991). Others want to do away with the documentary hypothesis entirely (e.g. R. N. Whybray, The Making of the Pentateuch: A Methodological Study, JSOT Supp. 53, Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1987). 2. See especially, J. Bottero, "The 'Code' of Hammurabi," in idem., Mesopotamia: Writing, Reasoning, and the Gods, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992, pp. 156-184; B. M.

(The small bronze altar Ahaz put aside was not capable of sustaining burnt offerings.3) Heger does not consider that the statement in 2 Chron. 4:1 might have been simply left out of the Kings account by haplography.4 The second source is archaeological. The large altar in the court at Arad was used for slaughtering only, and the temple of Arad was lined with offering benches. These offering benches disappear in Stratum IX, the middle of the eighth century, the period of Ahaz's reign (742-727). This convinces Heger that Ahaz instituted a nationwide reform to eliminate food offerings to the deity (p. 263). What Heger does not men- tion is that the entire temple at Arad was buried in Stratum IX, an act the excava- tor attributes to Hezekiah.s The temple ofArad cannot provide evidence for Ahaz's reform. To Heger, the second step in the elimination of the sacrificial system was the reform of Josiah (2 Kings 22:3-7)-a reform confined to the removal of local bamoth (p. 284). The reform of Josiah was the main cause of the weakening of lay attachment to the temple. The centralization of the cult resulted in "a profession- al class of clergy and . . . exclusion of laics from . . . the sacrifices" (p. 366). "The priesthood developed into an intermediary body between God and the peo- ple." "[This notion was] totally incompatible with Israelite tradition and con- sciousness" (ibid.). No evidence is brought for the latter assertion. An elaborate priesthood is part of the tradition of the entire ancient Near East.6 Ostraca indicate the presence of a priesthood at Arad. Heger brings no evidence for the historicity of Josiah's reform, except to posit the Deuteronomic redactor would have no rea- son to make it up. Yet, archaeological evidence shows all cult sites were destroyed during Assyrian conquest-long before Josiah.7 The centralization of the cult and the exclusion of the laity led to "minimal con- cern for the temple among a significant element of Israelite society" (p. 335). Ezra and Nehemiah reversed this, invigorated the cult, and brought about a theocracy in Jerusalem (pp. 350-351). Heger does not mention that both these men worked for the Persian government. According to Heger, the Persian government played no role in Judaean internal developments. The wishes of two Persian officials were paramount, 3. N. H. Gadegaard, "On the So-Called Burnt Offering Altar in the Old Testament," PEQ, 110, 1978, pp. 35-45. 4. S. Japhet, I and II Chronicles, The Old Testament Library, Westminster/Louisville: John Knox Press, 1993, ad. loc. p. 564. Gadegaard (ibid., n. 4) states that a small bronze altar could never sustain a fire large enough to consume an entire sheep or bull. A very large copper altar would be able to sustain such a fire however, and "copper" may be the correct translation (Deut. 8:9). Heger argues (p. 242, n. 24) that 1 Kings 8:64, which refers to a large altar out in the middle courtyard, was a priest- ly interpolation, and so from the Persian period. Rather than the end of chapter 8 being a priestly in- terpolation, I would argue that vs. 14-61 are a deuteronomic interpolation.

A survey of cult sites in Judah/Samaria shows that none remained in existence after 701. All were either destroyed in the course of conquest, or intentionally buried to avoid desecration (L. S. Fried, "The High Places (Bam6t) and the Reforms of Hezekiah and Josiah," forthcoming; presented at the Meeting of the American Oriental Society, New Orleans, April 1998). 110</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews yet these two officials had only the interests of the Jews at heart. This is not consis- tent with Persian administrative patterns.8 Heger provides no evidence for priestly sec- ular power. A detailed study of the history of Judah in the Persian period suggests the priests had no real power. Except for brief periods, they were subordinate to the Per- sian monarchs and their local representatives.9 To Heger, the elaborate ritual developed by the priesthood shifted the per- formance of the cult from the offerer to the priest. It thereby "diminished the ex- citement of the sacrificial celebration for the individual who came to Jerusalem for that purpose" (p. 370). The ability to send money to pay for the cult (a system de- veloped by Nehemiah) also helped to eliminate the "emotional devotion" of those who could not come in person (p. 370). Yet this conclusion is belied by the huge holiday throngs that both Josephus and the New Testament report. According to Heger, the rabbis substituted synagogue ritual for temple sac- rifice. Even before the destruction of the Temple, the rabbis had organized the pop- ulace into assemblies to recite appropriate biblical pericopes instead of attending the sacrifices (p. 381). As proof, he quotes only the Mishnah Ta 'anith (4:2) as if it were a reliable source for first century events. The entire purpose of his work is to explain the rapid substitution of recitation for sacrifice. Yet he provides no real ev- idence to indicate when this occurred or that it was a first-century phenomenon. In sum, Heger attempts to show a gradual weakening of attachment to the sacrificial cult. This weak attachment enabled the rabbis to substitute the recita- tion of biblical passages even before the Temple's destruction. The phenomenon of ritualized prayer as a substitute for the sacrificial system is interesting and worthy of investigation. I am not convinced it was caused by a decrease in emotional at- tachment of the laity toward the Temple, nor do I think it was a first-century phe- nomenon. A critical reading of Talmudic texts might yield an answer to this inter- esting question. Lisbeth S. Fried University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Michigan</page></plain_text>
