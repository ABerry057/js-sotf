<plain_text><page sequence="1">A KABBALISTIC PERSPECTIVE ON GENDER-SPECIFIC COMMANDMENTS: ON THE INTERPLAY OF SYMBOLS AND SOCIETY by TALYA FISHMAN Unlike other symbol systems, whose precise influence on cultural mores is hard to pinpoint,' Kabbalah's impact on mainstream Jewish culture can be traced, at least in the realm of practice, for this mystical theology and symbol system is rooted in law and expressed through ritual behavior.2 I would like to express my gratitude to Professors Caroline Walker Bynum, Elliot Horo- witz, Moshe Idel, Ivan Marcus, and Elliot Wolfson, who were kind enough to read and com- ment on earlier drafts of this article. I would also like to acknowledge fellowship assistance granted by Harvard University's Center for Jewish Studies, which freed me from teaching responsibilities, and a travel grant provided by Boston University, which enabled me to attend the First International Conference on Women and Halakha in Jerusalem, December 1986, where I delivered a lecture based on an excerpt from this paper. A different excerpt was the sub- ject of a talk delivered at the annual meeting of the American Association of Religion in Bos- ton, December 1987. Were it not for the sensibilities and sensitivity of my sister Leora, this piece might never have been written. 1. Recent cross-cultural writings on the relationship between symbols and the societies in which they are found have stressed the symbol's transcendent nature. Symbols are not mirrors which merely reflect societal beliefs and attitudes, nor do they, in and of themselves, determine those beliefs and attitudes. See C. W.

The present study aims at exploring the impact of kabbalistic theology on one feature of Jewish cultural life, attitudes toward women's participa- tion in aspects of Jewish ritual, by examining a single text, Sefer HaKanah.3 Though this pseudonymous treatise is attributed to the first-century Palesti- nian tanna R.

Reynolds and Robert Moore (Chicago, 1984), pp. 105-125. 2. The studies of Gershom Scholem, Jacob Katz, Meir Benayahu, Yisrael Ta Shema, and Ze'ev Gries have shed light on Kabbalah's relationship to various facets of Jewish society and culture which find expression in halakhic writings. Scholem's pioneering work drew attention to the ways in which kabbalistic theory and sym- bols led to the creation of new rituals within Jewish life. G. Scholem, "Tradition and New Crea- tion in the Ritual of the Kabbalists," in On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism, (New York, 1965), pp. 118-157. And see idem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (New York, 1941), pp. 28-29; idem, "The Meaning of Torah in Jewish Mysticism," in On the Kabbalah, pp. 32-86. The studies of Katz and Benayahu have done much to clarify the ways in which Kabbalah relates to existing halakhah, identifying those jurisprudential conditions which best lent them- selves to kabbalistic interpretation or even adjudication, and underscoring Kabbalah's ten- dency to introduce stringencies into Jewish law. See, e.g., the first five essays reprinted in Jacob Katz's Halakha veKabbalah (Jerusalem, 1984), pp. 9-126; M. Benayahu, "Vikkuah Ha- Kabbalah 'im HaHalakhah," Da'at 5 (1980). Yisrael Ta-Shma's study of a particular liturgical practice of kabbalistic origin traces the stages of a custom's evolution and utimate incorporation into the worship of non-kabbalists. Y. Ta-Shma, "El Melekh Ne'eman: Gilgulo shel Minhag," Tarbiz 39 (1970): 184-194. Ze'ev Gries's ongoing research has shed light on the ways in which kabbalistic (and particularly Luri- anic) customs recorded in the margins of standard halakhic texts were incorporated into later editions of these works.

These responses set forth kabbalistic explanations of the commandments, roughly following the order of laws as they appear in Moses of Coucy's thirteenth-century Sefer Mizvot Gadol (a work which itself slightly modified the sequence of laws found in Maimonides' fourteen-volume code, the Mishneh Torah). However, the structure offered by the topic headings of Sefer HaKanah is not borne out within each section. The questions and challenges raised by the pupil are often related to the section heading only by remote association, do not follow any discernible order, and are often highly repetitive. One theme which recurs time and again in the remarks of both pupil and teacher is the role of women in the Jewish community and their participa- tion in ritual life. Commenting on this phenomenon one hundred years ago, the historian Heinrich Graetz observed that the text's preoccupation with this topic made it seem as if Sefer HaKanah were the work of a nineteenth- century Reform Rabbiner preaching in favor of the emancipation of women.7 Yitzhak Baer (who thought that the work had been composed in Spain) claimed that the vehemence of Sefer HaKanah's arguments against women's circumscribed role reflected the anti-talmudic sentiment of the 5.

However, Kushnir-Oron con- cludes, even if the questions posed by the pupil do reflect the cultural condi- tions of the author's milieu, Sefer HaKanah never intended to protest the condition of women or to fight for their greater rights.'0 Indeed, recent scholarship has tended to stress Sefer HaKanah's conser- vative nature," disputing the opinions of Scholem, who referred to Sefer HaKanah's "latent antinomism,"'2 and noted that the text's full heretical force later found expression only later in the Sabbatian movement,'3 and of Tishby, who described the pupil's attacks on the rabbinic lifestyle as being even stronger than those of the philosophers.14 In contrast with these per- spectives, Kushnir-Oron maintains that Sefer HaKanah can only be mis- taken for an antinomian work if the remarks of the pupil and teacher are separated,'5 for the mystical explanations "remove the sting" of the pupil's charges.'6 I would maintain, however, that the judgment of any reader as to whether the teacher's kabbalistic explanations ultimately resolve and erase the student's challenges is ultimately subjective, and that a different feature of Sefer HaKanah warrants further attention in any attempt to evaluate the treatise's relationship to the rabbinic norm. 8.

In such cases the author merely utilizes the conceptual vocabulary of Kabbalah to provide ex post facto justifications of such stringent halakhic positions. Sefer HaKanah must therefore be contrasted with works of Kab- balah which transformed Jewish law in a revolutionary manner,20 and would seem to be a "standard bearer of conservatism."2' On the other hand, Sefer HaKanah is unique in taking the uncompromis- ing position that mizvot (and rabbinic literature) can only be understood kabbalistically.22 Examination of several such kabbalistic interpretations reveals that they, at times, justify the teacher's adoption of positions which deviate from the halakhic norm in their stringency.23 Indeed, Sefer HaKan- 17.

Just as the Zohar has been shown to have certain Ashkenazi influences, so too, Ashken- azi influences on Sefer HaKanah may be seen in the teacher's rulings regarding women's perfor- mance of milah and fashioning of zizit.

Far from advocating additional opportunities for women's participation in ritual activities, Sefer HaKanah's kabbalistic perspective in fact deprives women of various opportunities codified in mainstream rabbinic legislation. Though the adoption of a position more stringent than the halakhic norm is well known as a characteristic of Jewish pietism (i.e., hasidut) in its various historical manifestations, it would be incorrect, I think, to view the perspective of Sefer HaKanah's teacher as pietistic. The pietist embraces that which he views as a higher standard voluntarily, i.e., as a supererogatory measure, in full recognition of the fact that halakhah constitutes the norm by which the community as a whole is bound.27 The perspective of Sefer HaKanah's teacher, on the other hand, might be characterized as "hyperno- mian", insofar as he regards the higher standard as the only standard, and identifies it with the universally binding halakhic norm. Ironically, the teacher's "hypernomism" effectively prevents women from engaging in their own form of pietistic or supererogatory behavior-that is, from assuming the observance of rituals which are not required by law.

Scholem, Major Trends, p. 177. 25. See Katz, "Hakhra'ot HaZohar," pp. 47-48. Though a later testimony, R. David Ibn Abi Zimra's categorical statement may be taken as emblematic of Kabbalah's conservative influence on the evolution of halakhah. He declared that where the law itself is the subject of dispute, kabbalistic considerations led him to embrace the more stringent option. She-elot UTeshuvot HaRadbaz, IV.80. 26. Ta-Shema, "El Melekh Ne-eman," pp. 184-194, and Katz, "Hakhra'ot haZohar," pp. 39-43, discuss the divergent teachings of these two kabbalistic works regarding the recitation of Shema'. Sefer HaKanah deviates from the zoharic tradition of repeating the last three words of Shema', a practice which was halakhically problematic, declaring instead that the words to be repeated were "Ani Adonai Eloheikhem"-a practice which was halakhically irreproachable. 27.

A brief glance at features peculiar to the religious life of women in Byzantium (both Jewish and Christian) may facilitate speculation about the historical dimension of Sefer HaKanah's interest in gender- specific commandments. Jewish women in the Byzantine world enjoyed certain economic and social powers relative to their husbands which were unknown in Ashkenazic and Sephardic lands. Rabbinic legislation recognized two categories of pos- sessions which a bride brought with her at the time of her marriage.28 Any- thing in the category of nikhsei tzon barzel, literally "iron sheep posses- sions," was to become the full responsibility of the husband for the duration of the marriage, and indeed, was considered his property.29 If the marriage was dissolved, the husband had to return these possessions to his wife, while he himself sustained any gain or loss resulting from their management. On the other hand, the husband did not assume responsibility for possessions referred to as nikhsei melug. Though he might administer these funds during the course of the marriage and benefit from any usufruct which accrued, they were technically the property of his wife.30 The one exception to this pattern-which attracted the attention of Jews from other lands-developed within the Romaniyot tradition of Byzantine Jewry.3" Writing in sixteenth-century Constantinople, the Spanish emigre R. Jacob Ibn Habib mentions in a responsum that he has heard of a mar- riage custom which the Romaniyot Jews observe very strictly. No matter how large a woman's nedunya, he writes, the Romaniyot Jews hold that a husband has no rights to it. Even if it is in the form of movable goods or money, the husband may only do business with it if it is kept by the woman. The upshot of this arrangement, he notes, is that the woman always has an eye on her property.32 28. M. Yeb. 7:1-2; B. Yeb. 67a. 29. This corresponded to the nedunya, or dowry. 30.

Krauss Jubilee Vol- ume (Tel Aviv, 1936), pp. 172 ff. 32.

R. Isaiah di Trani the Elder (1180-1250) writes that while in most lands a husband inherited his wife after her death (unless she had no offspring),33 in lands where Romaniyot tradition was followed, a husband did not inherit the wife's property upon her death, unless a specific stipulation to that effect had been made at the time of marriage (i.e., kiddushin).34 Is it possible that the unusual economic powers of Romaniyot Jewish women (relative to their Ashkenazi and Sephardi counterparts) may have had some impact on their place in Jewish ritual life-as was the case with the nashim hashuvot ("important women") of medieval Ashkenaz?" Might the economic and social powers of Jewish women in Byzantium (whether or not accompanied by a change in their place in ritual life) have troubled halakhists, and particularly outsiders to the region, who, like Jacob Ibn Habib, feared that this phenomenon might spread? While there is no evidence to substantiate such hypotheses, this may be due to our relative ignorance about Jewish culture in Byzantium as com- pared with other European lands.36 their own custom, whereby a husband takes the property which a wife brings into the marriage, "even if it is thousands of gold dinars-and he treats it as if it were his inheritance from his own father."

Sefer HaKanah's discussion of a husband's access to the nedunya, or dowry, may well reflect this unique regional practice, for the treatise's author can apparently conceive of situations in which the husband does not take responsibility for the nedunya-a situation which could only have arisen among Romaniyot Jews: "If [emphasis added] the husband took upon himself responsibility for the nedunya, then he is obligated, and all the benefits and risks are his, as in any other debt. And this is called nikhsei tzon barzel. And if [emphasis added] the husband did not take that responsibility upon himself, then all [the property] belongs to the woman, and the husband has no claims on this property. Rather, he benefits from the usufruct, and the capital belongs to the woman. And that property for which the husband did not assume responsibility is called nikhsei melug." Sefer HaKanah, p. 201. 33. In this case, all or half of the nedunya would revert to her heirs from her parents' house. 34. Teshuvot Rid, no. 67, Wertheimer ed. (Jerusalem, 1967), pp. 331 ff.; cf.

Like their more comprehen- sively studied counterparts in the Latin West, such women took up residence in special houses, and, in some cases, performed sacraments which were tra- ditionally the province of men, such as hearing confession, and even offering "masses without priests."37 In the Byzantine East, as in the Latin West, such phenomena provoked opposition to women's exercise of spiritual authority and led to the creation and enforcement of legislation restricting the auton- omy of women in the religious sphere.38 While Christian women's appropri- ation of traditionally male avenues of spiritual expression and the conse- quent backlash have been far better documented for the Latin West, the church in the East had additional reasons to be concerned about ascetic behavior unregulated by ecclesiastical control, for in Byzantine lands the church was faced with extreme manifestations of renunciation (e.g., Stylites) which seemed uncomfortably close to the heresy of Manicheanism.39 Awareness of these developments in Christendom prompts speculation about possible parallel trends in medieval Jewish culture. Are there grounds for assuming the existence of real critics, male or female, within Jewish society, who resented the exemption of women from various command- 37.

If so, was there opposition, a spirit of backlash analogous to that which exist- ed in Christian society? Might Sefer HaKanah be preserving voices on both sides of a real controversy within the author's environment? I have found no textual evidence which addresses either of these ques- tions. While it is clear that Sefer HaKanah's author is ultimately critical of the role which women play in certain Jewish rituals, it is not clear whether this critical stance comes in response to live demands for broader participa- tion, or whether it is an unprovoked pietistic (or hypernomian) curb on opportunities permitted by rabbinic texts. Anticipating the Messiah's imminent arrival, Sefer HaKanah's attack on the corruption and depravity of the religious leaders of the generation reflects its author's zealous efforts to hasten redemption.40 Might not Sefer HaKanah's criticism of dissolute Byzantine Jewish society also record the reactions of a cultural outsider, shocked by what he encounters?41 Sefer HaKanah's obsessions with the ritual practices of Jewish women might be at least partially accounted for if the text is viewed against the backdrop of rabbinic literature written by outsiders to Romaniyot cul- ture, both Ashkenazim and Sephardim, who commented on the deviation of certain Byzantine practices form "mainstream" rabbinic legislation and judicial practice.42 Rabbinic Perspectives on Gender-Specific Commandments Examination of Sefer HaKanah's comments on gender-specific com- mandments against the backdrop of mainstream rabbinic notions illumin- 40.

A tannaitic dictum recorded in the Midrash and both Talmuds links the gender-specificity of certain commandments both to their rhetorical formu- lation as injunctions (i.e., positive precepts) or prohibitions (i.e., negative precepts), and to the temporal coordinates of performance: "Women are exempt from positive time-bound commandments."43 Writing in thirteenth- century Provence or Italy, Jacob Anatoli offered a rationale for the dictum, suggesting that this arrangement would make it easier for a wife to attend to her husband's needs.44 In a variant sociological explanation, the fourteenth- century Spaniard David b. Joshua Abudraham claimed that the ruling was designed to preserve shalom bayyit (family harmony) by preventing the occurrence of a situation in which a woman's two masters (God and her hus- band) issued conflicting demands.45 Though explanations were offered for this dictum, its inaccuracy as a description of existing rabbinic legislation was nonetheless evident. The Tal- mud itself (along with subsequent rabbinic commentators) labeled it devoid of prescriptive value.46 Its very shakiness suggests why the author of Sefer HaKanah may have selected the topic of gender-specific mizvot as one merit- ing disproportionate attention. Areas of Jewish law which are most am- biguous, inconsistent, or impervious to reason are precisely those which mystics regarded as ideal fora for the display of Kabbalah's graphic interpretive potential.47 Beyond the question of the dictum's juridical status, however, there is ample historical evidence (found in rabbinic sources) that Jewish women of 43.

Listing several positive time-bound precepts which women are obligated to perform and several positive precepts which are not time-bound from which women are exempt, the Talmud goes on to record R. Yohanan's assertion that the formula cannot be taken as authoritative, even though exceptions are noted (Kid. 34a). Elaborating on R. Yohanan's pronouncement in his Commentary on the Mishnah, Maimonides does even more to minimize the significance of the tannaitic dictum. Adding to the list of exceptions, he asserts that women's obligations and exemptions have nothing to do with the formula; rather, they stem from oral tradition, and only the teaching of tradition can be authoritative in this regard.

There is little documentation of what women themselves were seeking. However, in rabbinic literature we find a number of explicit and implicit explanations of women's performance of commandments from which they were exempt, articulated by males who observed this behavior.

Joseph Caro noted that Sueslin Alexander HaKohen, author of the fourteenth-century Seftr HaAgudah, asserted that a woman who is the firstborn should participate in the fast, learning this from the case of Pharaoh's daughter Bitya.

One possible motive is cited in a tannaitic dispute which took place with- in fifty years of the destruction of the Temple: May women perform semikha, i.e., may they lay their hands on the sacrificial animal prior to its slaughter? Though the tanna kamma, i.e., the anonymous voice of the Mish- nah, ruled that "sons of Israel perform semikha, and daughters of Israel do not," R. Yose and R. Shimon were of the opinion that women are permitted to lay their hands over the sacrificial animal. Adducing historical testimony in support of his position, R. Yose noted that the inclusion of women in this ritual in the days of Abba Elazar was not an indication of women's obliga- tion to perform this commandment, but rather, a measure introduced in order that women might enjoy "peace of mind." ("Lo mipnei shehasemikha benashim, ella mipnei nahat ruah shel nashim").58 To be sure, this passage records only a hypothetical motive for women's performance of rituals from which they were legally exempt. It reflects only the perspective of a particular rabbi, and need not necessarily represent the perspective of any woman. Moreover, semikha was no longer practiced after the destruction of the Temple in 70 C.E. Nonetheless, a number of inferences may be drawn from this statement. Firstly, R. Yose's identification of the quest for "peace of mind" (nahat ruah) as a motive for women's voluntary ritual performance implies that the desired psychological state stemmed from social context, i.e., from women's need to feel that they were not excluded from the community. Secondly, the passage cited indicates that while semikha was regarded as a gender-specific commandment when the Temple stood, this designation did not impede women's participation. Last- ly, the qualifying phrase, lo mipnei shehasemikha benashim, ("not because semikha pertains to women") reveals that R. Yose viewed women's laying their hands over the sacrificial animal as a theologically meaningless act, presumably devoid of any ramifications in the realm of reward59-and yet 57. Thus, for example, I have not included the comment of R. Jacob Moellin, who said that the behavior of foolish women who wore zizit seemed like a display of arrogance. Sefer HaAgur, no. 27. Similar motives were attributed to women who wore tefilin (phylacteries) inso- far as they are only to be worn in a state of ritual purity, and women, it is claimed, generally do not know whether or not they are in such a state. 58. Hag. 16b, after Sifra, Lev. 2.</page><page sequence="14">212 TAYLA FISHMAN his sense of the sacral ineffectiveness of this activity did not lead him to oppose women's participation. Another rabbinic explanation of the motivation behind women's perfor- mance of rituals from which they are exempt is set forth by the thirteenth- century commentator R. Asher b. Yehiel, who suggests that such behavior is an expression of an individual woman's pietistic inclination. Explaining R. Tam's twelfth-century ruling that women may recite blessings upon per- forming commandments from which they are exempt,60 R. Asher invokes a talmudic passage found in B.K. 30a: Hai man deba'ei lemehevei hasida leikayyem milei deberakhot ("Let that person who would be a pietist fulfill matters of berakhot [blessings]"). Where most talmudic exegetes, Rashi included, understand the passage as one which enjoins the would-be pietist to engage in matters treated in the talmudic tractate entitled Berakhot,6' R. Asher reads it rather creatively as an assertion that one who wishes to be a pietist should perform deeds which call for the recitation of blessings.62 Underlying R. Asher's comment is the following assumption: women who undertake ritual practices above and beyond what they are obligated to per- form are those who seek additional occasions for the recitation of blessings, because they are motivated by pietistic impulses. Unlike the tanna R. Yose, R. Asher makes no reference to social context, but identifies the spiritual yearnings of individuals as the motivation behind a woman's performance of commandments from which she is exempt. Yet another rabbinic explanation for this behavior might be inferred from the Talmud's comments on one aspect of Jewish ritual. The Talmud stipulates that while men are required to lean while drinking the four cups of wine at the Passover seder, women should not lean, with the exception of an 59. R. Yose's perspective might be seen as having its latter-day equivalent in Yeshayahu Leibowitz's well-known assertion that women's performance of mizvot from which they are exempt is merely a form of "sport." The concrete acts which constitute the mizvot are not inher- ently meaningful, Leibowitz claims; theological significance is only conferred upon them by context, i.e., the fact that they feature in a contract between the commander, God, and the com- manded, who in this case is male. Leibowitz asserts that there is nothing inherently sacral about such activities as donning zizit or tefilin; their religious "power" is only derived from the fact that they are commanded by God. Y.

What are the characteristics of an "important woman"? Medieval com- mentaries on this talmudic passage indicate that the designation is linked to a number of factors: (a) the degree of independence a given woman enjoys-which may stem from her husband's having permitted her consider- able freedom,64 or from the fact that she is no longer bound to serve her hus- band, having been widowed or divorced;65 (b) her economic status, includ- ing her production of an independent source of income from "the fruits of her own labor," or her "possession of manservants and maidservants, so that she need not be directly involved with household matters";66 (c) her social class, specifically, her birth into the educational aristocracy;67 (d) her character and piety.68 Though I have been unable to find any explicit pictor- ial documentation of medieval Jewish women reclining while drinking the four cups of wine at the Passover seder, the literary evidence suggests that this was the case. Commenting on this talmudic passage in thirteenth- century Germany, R. Mordecai b. Hillel followed the Tosafot in asserting that "in our times, all women are to be considered nashim hashuvot [impor- tant women]."69 Extrapolating from these shreds of information, one might infer that, at least in certain cases, the nature and specifics of ritual obligation were inten- tionally linked to the economic, social, and cultural status of a particular 63.

While halakhic regulations pertaining to women are designed for the group as a whole,70 there were, nonetheless, occasions on which individual women were recognized as exceptions and were not merely permitted but required to deviate from the gender-based norm. Indeed, when it came to the practice of leaning at the Passover seder, rabbinic legislation dictated that such "important women," exceptions to their gender, adopt the form of ritual expression which was characteristic of men."7 In the absence of any explicit documentation, one can only speculate about whether medieval Jewish women (and men) might have been motivated to apply the principle implicit in this instance to other mizvot. Such a possibility, which is not set forth in rabbinic writings, but merely inferred from one case, might consti- tute a socioeconomic explanation for women's performance of command- ments from which they were exempt. Finally, in the case of one particular commandment, Torah study, there is evidence that women were credited by some rabbis with having under- taken this precept out of their independent recognition that Torah study is a spiritual good unto itself. Though the following testimony postdates Sefer HaKanah, the situation it describes clearly existed in earlier centuries, in Italy if not elsewhere.72 Samuel Archivolti, a late-sixteenth- to early- seventeenth-century Italian rabbi, actively encouraged self-motivated women in the study of Torah and felt that his colleagues should do the same. Writing to a learned woman, Archivolti offers a striking reinterpretation of the tannaitic dictum in which R. Eliezer lambasts those who offer education to girls. Indeed, Archivolti does not even think that there is a question as to whether women should learn Torah.73 70. See E. S. Rosenthal, "Al Derekh HaRov," Perakim 1 (1967-68): 183-204; S.

However, women who, of their own choice, have drawn near to the royal work, the work of God, because they have chosen that which is good in and of itself, they will surely ascend the mountain of the Lord and dwell in His holy place, for they are exemplary women. And it is the duty of the sages of their generation to glorify, praise, encourage, support, and strengthen them, and from them shall the Torah go forth.75 While the tolerance for and encouragement of women's education in Italy may have been atypical of other countries,76 this passage not only underscores women's appreciation of the inherent value of Torah study, but also suggests why menfolk-father, brothers, husbands-might have been inclined to assist them in this undertaking.

To begin with, females have fewer religious obligations than males and therefore fewer opportunities for reward. More- over, the author claims, the prohibitions, which women are equally obligat- ed to observe, are of lesser reward value than the positive commandments from which they are exempt.78 This being the case, he continues, the exemp- tion of women from the performance of certain positive precepts deprives them of opportunities to perform those commandments which would be of greatest assistance in the final reckoning. The practical consequences of the disparate weights of positive and nega- tive precepts are further spelled out in the same author's Sefer HaPeliah, a kabbalistic discourse on the account of Creation in the first two chapters of Genesis, which is also constructed as a dialogue between pupil and 77. Sefer HaKanah (Cracow, 1894), p. 73b. However, in both Ashkenazi and Sephardi lands, women did hear the shofar on Rosh HaShanah, though they were legally exempt. See, e.g., R. Asher b. Yehiel on R.H. 32a; R. Nissim, loc. cit; Hagahot Maimuniyyot on M. T, Hil. Shofar 2:1. 78. As most editions of Sefer HaKanah do not contain this introduction (see Kushnir-Oron, HaPeliah veHaKanah, p. 20, n. 2; p. 232), the following passage is taken from Kushnir-Oron, p. 65: "Thus you see that commandments of performance [i.e., mizvot ma'asiyyot] protect against the torment of Gehinnom. .... And the great proof is that, were the yoke of the reward for posi- tive commandments not weightier/stronger than the ... punishment [for the violation] of negative commandments, then how could positive commandments come and supersede nega- tive commandments?! Should a matter which draws no punishment if left unperformed [i.e., a positive commandment] be strong enough to supersede a matter [i.e., a negative command- ment] whose performance draws punishment?" The argument that the reward resulting from the performance of a positive biblical commandment is greater than the punishment which results from the violation of a negative biblical commandment is derived from two halakhic principles. The talmudic sages ruled that where positive and negative biblical commandments are in conflict, mizvat 'aseh doheh mizvat lo ta'aseh, i.e., the positive commandment supersedes the negative commandment. See, e.g., Ber. 10a; Yeb. 3a, 5a, 7a. And in circum- stances where a positive biblical commandment is in conflict with a negative rabbinic com- mandment, the policy is to abstain from the performance of the positive commandment, in keeping with the principle of shev ve'al ta'aseh. See Yeb. 90 a-b, and Elon, HaMishpat Halvri, 2:413 ff. Sefer HaKanah's final question is rhetorical. The very fact that the rabbis ruled that a positive commandment supersedes a negative commandment-notwithstanding the fact that the violation of a negative commandment brings punishment (and the violation of a positive commandment under certain circumstances does not)-is seen as evidence for the "strength" of the positive commandment in the realm of reward.</page><page sequence="19">GENDER-SPECIFIC COMMANDMANTS 217 teacher.79 In an impassioned outburst, the student in Sefer HaPeliah graphi- cally describes the female's soteriological handicap relative to the male:80 Is there a greater injustice than this; that the woman is included in warnings about punishments,8' but is excluded from the reward of performing?!?82 Let us say that she does not become defiled; she also does not arouse divine effluence and blessing. Thus she remains a mute rock, without reward. Lord of the Universe! If this woman should commit transgression, with what correc- tive have You provided her that she might atone for her sin? A man violates the prohibition against wearing shatnez [i.e., linsey-woolsy] with impunity;83 subsequently he observes the mizvah of zizit, and the one balances out the other,84 and he is atoned for, and has perhaps even gained something.

Addressing himself to God, the pupil challenges the exemption of women from the precept of keriat she- ma',93 the declaration of divine unity, by invoking the kabbalistic interpreta- tion of the first sin.94 Yihud [the unification of God's Name] is the foundation of all mizvot, and You exempted women! They are left open to destruction, for if they do not unify God, they will worship the sun or the moon! Eve's sin in the Garden was that she did not unify God, and her lot was one of pain.

(b) The subsequent hekkesh comparing tefilin to the entire Torah results in the dictum: women are exempt for positive time-bound command- ments. 89.

The frag- mentation of God (literally "splitting the shoots")97 is thus part of woman's archetypal experience. Given this obvious feminine weakness, Sefer HaKan- ah's pupil argues, woman should hardly be exempted from the command- ment to unify God's Name twice daily. In contrast to the passages considered above, which appear to be motiv- ated by concern for women's prospects for salvation, spiritual enrichment, and theological rectitude, other passages in the treatise criticize the very pro- cess of legal reasoning which results in women's exemption from certain pre- cepts. In these cases, Sefer HaKanah highlights the Talmud's deviation from the plain sense of Scripture (which medieval Jewish exegetes termed peshuto shel mikra), and the rabbis' inconsistent application of hermeneutical modes of inference. Sefer HaKanah's pupil criticizes deviations from Scripture's plain sense in talmudic discussions of women's exemption from a number of command- ments, among them Torah study, circumcision, zizit, sukkah, and shofar. His attack on the exemption of women from the precept of talmud torah focuses on the rabbis' explanation of why women are included in the precept of mezuzah. Observing that the verse immediately following the biblical commandment of mezuzah promises the reward of long life,98 the sages had posed the rhetorical question of whether it was only men who needed the blessing of long life, and had concluded that women, too, were included in the obligation.99 Sefer HaKanah's pupil turns to the scriptural context itself 96. The influence of this work on Sefer HaKanah is noted in Kushnir-Oron, HaPeliah veHa- Kanah, pp. 82, 99 n. 78, and in I. Tishby, "Ma'amarim miSefer Ma'arekhet HaElohut biSefer HaZiyyoni," Kiryat Sefer 19 (1942-43): 55, n. 1. 97. The phrase kizzuz baneti'ot, which in Midrash Gen.

Thus, for example, he rejects the rabbinic claim that the word beneikhem ("your sons"), which appears in the scriptural commandment of Torah study (Deut. 11:19), comes intentionally to exclude benoteikhem ("your daughters").102 And ridiculing the inconsistency of the Talmud's interpreta- tion of the word ha-ezrah ("the citizen"), the pupil notes that the sages claimed that the term ha-ezrah in Lev. 16:29 signals the inclusion of women in the addition to the Yom Kippur fast, but that the appearance of ha-ezrah in Lev. 23:43 indicates that women are excluded from the commandment of sukkah.'03 The argument that Scripture alone should determine women's legal obli- gations is set forth more forcefully in the pupil's comments on the apparent conflict between talmudic dicta concerning women's ritual obligations and the biblical precept of Hakhel ("assembly"), a positive time-bound com- mandment. Addressing his complaint to God, the pupil contrasts two sources of authority, divine and rabbinic. Lord of the Universe, Your sages have instituted a principle saying, Women are obligated to perform all positive precepts which are not time-specific [Ber. 20a].

The pupil in Sefer HaKanah is particularly outraged by what he views as the sages' inconsistent and selective use of the hekkesh, a mode of inference which conforms two subjects to one another by juxtaposition of biblical phrases or by use of analogous phraseology.'05 This inconsistency is manifest, for example, in the exemption of women from the commandment of shofar. Why, he demands, is there no hekkesh between the biblical pro- hibition against performing work on the first day of the seventh month (i.e., Rosh HaShanah), as stipulated in Num. 29:1, and the positive command- ment taught in the continuation of that verse, "It shall be for you a day of trumpeting"? Given parallel situations, the pupil argues, the sages should have declared that all who are included in the prohibition-that is, men and women alike-are similarly included in the injunction of shofar!'06 Why, then, are women not obligated in the latter positive commandment? Moreover, he asks, where two hekkeshim yield opposing teachings, why is one stronger? Why, for example, is the hekkesh responsible for exempting women from positive time-bound commandments (i.e., the one comparing the entire Torah to tefilin),'07 more powerful than the hekkesh suggested above, which would include women in the commandment of shofar? And why, on the contrary, is that same hekkesh responsible for the exemption of women from positive time-bound commandments less powerful than the 104. Sefer HaKanah, p. 6a. In point of fact, rabbinic literature had never denied the inclu- sion of women in the biblical commandment of assembly, notwithstanding its status as a posi- tive time-bound precept. Why, then, did Sefer HaKanah's pupil draw attention to this case? It may well be that he wished to underscore the inaccuracy of the dictum exempting women from positive time-bound precepts. 105. This definition of hekkesh is found in L. Jacobs, The Talmudic Argument: A Study in Talmudic Reasoning and Methodology (Cambridgeshire, 1984). 106. Sefer HaKanah, p. 73b. This proposed hekkesh follows the model of the talmudic hekkesh responsible for the inclusion of women in the obligation to eat mazzah on the first night of Passover. Pes 43b, and see Y.

Why, he asks, did the sages offer no fewer than three ways of justifying the exemption of women from the command- ment of sukkah?'09 Insinuating that the talmudic sages needed to draw the same legal conclusion in a number of ways because of the inadequacy of each individual "proof," the pupil, in effect, challenges the conclusiveness of any one of their arguments. Perhaps the most unusual of the pupil's remarks challenges women's exemption from the commandment of tefilin (phylacteries) on kabbalistic grounds."'t Observing that halakhah does not regard the absence of either part of the tefilin, i.e., either head phylacteries or arm phylacteries, as an impediment to the performance of the mizvah,"' and volunteering the infor- mation that the kabbalistic perspective associates arm phylacteries with the female,112 the pupil asks why women should not don that half of the set with 108. Pes. 43b; cf. Y. Kid. 1:7. Sefer HaKanah, p. 70a. 109. Not only did they appeal (in B. Suk. 28 a-b) to the exclusionary import of the terms ha-ezrah ("the citizen") and benei Yisrael ("sons of Israel") (Lev. 23:42 and 23:43, respectively), he notes, but they also invoked the dictum exempting women from positive time-bound com- mandments. Sefer HaKanah, pp. 79a, 44a. Cf. Sefer HaKanah's criticism of the rabbinic exemp- tion of women from the commandment to circumcise their sons. Sefer HaKanah, p. 57a. 110. The pupil occasionally flashes his knowledge of Kabbalah, as if to inform the reader that, in challenging his teacher, he is merely playing the role of straight man. The teacher's kab- balistic insights hardly seem new to him: "Teacher," he exclaims, "how many times have I told you that I know your opinions? Just as you have heard the destruction/heresy from my mouth, hear from me the construction as well." Sefer HaKanah, p. 68b. On several occasions he articulates kabbalistic explanations in reponse to his own questions, as in his discussion of the prohibition against eating the sciatic nerve and his ultimate exegetical remarks on why women are excluded from talmud torah. Sefer HaKanah, pp. 79a, 80a. 111. M. Men. 4:1, Men. 44a. 112. According to Kabbalah, the "power" of tefilin is derived from tefilin shel rosh (phylac- teries of the head), which is associated with the male. See Zohar, Bereshit 14a, Vayishlah 168b, Bo 43a, and Shelah 175b, III. 248a, I. 266b. (However, Sefer HaKanah refers to tefilin shel yad as kedusha kallah, or "light sanctity," spelling kallah with a kof, where R. Bahya refers to tefilin shel yad in connection with kallah,-spelled with a kaf. See R. Bahya on Exod. 13:16. This may be a scribal error, or it may be an intentional reference to the fact that it is "lighter" and "weaker" than tefilin shel rosh, in that the tefilin of the arm contain the scriptural passages writ- ten on one parchment, while that of the head is divided into four compartments, each contain- ing a separate piece of parchment.) Cf. Sefer HaKanah, p. 58a.</page><page sequence="25">GENDER-SPECIFIC COMMANDMANTS 223 which they are kabbalistically associated, and thereby fulfill the precept of tefilin!" I 3 Notwithstanding these impassioned remarks, examination of Sefer HaKanah as a whole reveals that the pupil is hardly an unqualified advocate of women's broader participation in Jewish life. His objection to the rabbin- ic comparison between women and slaves does not stem from the fact that women are grouped together with subservient chattel, but from the fact that Jews who happen to be females are compared to people who have not entered the covenant. And the hardest of all: It isn't enough that they debased this poor thing by exempting her from the King's commandments. But they compared her to the slave, saying that a slave is obligated in every mizvah in which a woman is obli- gated. For God's sake, tell me, Teacher, what does a slave have in common with a woman?! For the woman is free, from the seed of Israel, and the Canaanite slave is from the defective seed of a gentile!"4 At times the pupil in Sefer HaKanah even challenges the rabbinic inclu- sion of women in certain practices, as when he builds a humanitarian case against obligating women to observe the rabbinic addition of one hour to the biblically ordained fast of Yom Kippur. Here he portrays the rabbis' jur- isprudential deviation from the laws of the Torah as less offensive than the fact that they deviated from the Torah's compassionate stance toward women. "These poor women whose tongues cleave to their palates [Ps. 137:6.] where food is concerned! The Torah had pity on them, and the sages had no pity on them.""5 Elsewhere, the pupil challenges the hermeneutical process which led to the inclusion of women in the commandment to eat mazzah on the first night of Passover. According to the talmudic hekkesh, everyone included in the prohibition, "You shall eat no leavened bread" (Deut. 16:13), is included in the remainder of the verse, "seven days shall you eat mazzot.""I6 The pupil objects: the affirmative part of the verse is not a commandment, but merely 113.

Thus, for example, he ridicules the reasoning which led the rabbis to obligate women to kindle the Hanukkah candles,"8 drink four cups of wine at the Passover seder,"9 and hear the megilah on Purim,'20 namely, the argument that women, too, were participants in the historical miracles of deliverance which these holiday rituals commemorate. In his mocking evocation of a traditional exegetical interpretation of Lev. 23:42-43, the pupil suggests that women should be included in the com- mandment of sukkah, inasmuch as "they too were under the clouds of Glory"!21 As is evident from this overview, Sefer HaKanah's pupil does not espouse consistently held opinions on any of these issues. Rather, his chal- lenges and criticisms are primarily designed to underscore the fallaciousness of rabbinic reasoning, and must be viewed as part of an overarching critique of halakhic method. Many of the pupil's challenges to rabbinic legislation take the form of serially articulated arguments which are mutually exclusive. Adopting a device of talmudic dialectical reasoning, the pupil first poses one objection to a given halakhic ruling, then immediately retracts it, setting forth a second position contradictory to the first. 22 These successive shifts in his position of argumentation suggest that he does not have a vested inter- est in any one of the challenges he poses, but is merely concerned to expose the shakiness of rabbinic thought. A Systemically-Referential Halakhic Critique In his role of straight man to the teacher, Sefer HaKanah's pupil raises questions which underscore the inadequacy of talmudic reasoning and set the stage for the demonstration of the veracity-and necessity-of kab- 117.

The teacher responds to these challenges, setting forth kabbalistic explanations which confirm and buttress the halakhic per- spective, "making sense" of legal particulars which are opaque to rationalis- tic interpretation. However, notwithstanding the teacher's explanations, the reader may remain uncertain as to whether the pupil's trenchant criticisms have been adequately resolved and dissolved, i.e., whether Sefer HaKanah is an antinomian work.123 The power of the pupil's criticisms stems largely from the fact that they are drawn from within rabbinic culture. They are systemically referential, reflecting fidelity to substantive and methodological elements found within the tradition.124 The pupil's attacks on rabbinic hermeneutics reflect his expectation that the process of reasoning resulting in legislation should be internally consistent and conform to the dictates of logic-concerns which inform the rabbinic process.'25 His biblicist critiques stem from the elevation of peshuto shel mikra (i.e., the plain sense of Scripture)-a concept which functions as a touchstone of exegesis in the medieval rabbinic tradition'26- to the rank of a halakhic standard. Though biblical exegetes such as Abraham Ibn Ezra in the eleventh cen- tury and Samuel b. Meir in the twelfth century had not refrained from set- ting forth the plain sense of a scriptural passage, even where it blatantly deviated from the rabbinic interpretation which constituted the legal norm, they had confined their remarks to the nonlegal realm of biblical commen- tary.127 The boundaries of genre served to mute positions which might other- wise have been construed as dissent and critique, and transformed them instead into "academic observations."128 Sefer HaKanah's pupil, on the other hand, points out rabbinic interpretation's deviation from Scripture's plain sense in the context of a global critique of halakhah. The pupil's pedagogic critique might similarly be viewed as an "inter- nal" challenge to halakhah. The notion that prayer requires proper kavvan- 123. See above, p. 00. 124.

Even the soteriological critique of women's exemp- tion-which holds that the discrepancy between men's and women's degrees of ritual obligation is unfair-pays no attention to the essentially sociologi- cal issue of woman's role and status in Jewish life. Rather, it draws its tortuous premises from certain adjudicatory principles found "within the system," and is informed by the traditional (if metahalakhic) concern for the immortality of the soul. In short, though the teacher's kabbalistically detailed responses serve as a counterpoint, muting the pupil's criticisms, the latter have a life of their own precisely because they draw upon categories indigenous to rabbinic literature. 30 If the pupil's motive and animus place him outside the pale of tradition, his observations alone clearly do not. The Cosmic Ramifications of Gender-Specific Mizvot Instead of defending rabbinic reasoning against the pupil's many assaults, the teacher expresses his own disdain for halakhic argumentation. However, unlike the pupil, who ridicules the talmudic process for its lapses from the standards of logic, the teacher criticizes it for its misplaced sensibi- lities, i.e., for relating to eternal truths via ineffective, mundane categories: "The Torah was not intended for natural analysis, but rather, for super- natural [or divine] speculation.""' The problem with talmudists, the teacher claims, is that they are preoc- cupied with worthless explanations which are ostensibly based on logic, and fail to inquire into the root of the Torah. Their approach is not merely mis- guided, but can even be harmful. In one of the more infamous passages of 129. See above, n. 89. 130. In this sense, Sefer HaKanah's criticisms of the halakhic sources regulating women's participation in Jewish life share some methodological similarities with remarks found in Kol Sakhal, a pseudonymous critique of rabbinic authority and tradition composed in northern Italy in the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century. As in Sefer HaKanah, a number of pas- sages in Kol Sakhal pinpoint rabbinic teachings pertaining to women in the service of a global critique of halakhic method. See, e.g., Kol Sakhal, in I. S. Reggio, Behinat HaKabbalah (Gori- zia, 1852), pp. 39, 41. Cf. Fishman, Shaking the Pillars of Exile, chap. 2 (forthcoming). 131. Sefer HaKanah, p. 57a.</page><page sequence="29">GENDER-SPECIFIC COMMANDMANTS 227 Sefer HaKanah, the teacher compares the Talmud to a boil in the intestines which sprouts a growth. The only way to prevent the damage that would result from the boil's unchecked development, he claims, is to uproot it at its source.132 Sefer HaKanah's teacher declares that in contrast to the realm of rational discourse, the ways of truth are trodden only by means of "super- natural" or "divine" reasoning (i.e., sevarot elohiyyot); moreover, each way is utterly independent of the next."'3 This last clause may be a warning that kabbalistic speculation is not governed by rules of noncontradiction and internal consistency, nor may it be judged by these fundamental standards of logic. As is the case with many other kabbalists, the teacher's notion of the pri- macy of the mystical pathway is accompanied by antirationalist fulmina- tions.'34 Sefer HaKanah's teacher differs from most kabbalists of the pre- Sabbatian period, however, in that his antirationalism is also the source of his extreme antipathy for the halakhic process. In this sense, Sefer HaKan- ah's teacher is perhaps closest to the earlier radical kabbalistic works, Ra'aya Meheimna and Tikkunei Zohar, which contrasted the ossified Torah found in rabbinic literature with the spiritual Torah found in the realm of Kabbalah.'35 While he views the discourse of the rabbis-which attempts to approach the truths of Torah in an outrageously inappropriate way-as lacking both merit and meaning, the teacher asserts, nonetheless, that the talmudic sages miraculously arrived at the correct legal conclusions. This wondrous con- fluence of God's Will with the results of misguided rabbinic reasoning is due to the fact that "the sages descended from the Academy of Heaven." "And they did not deviate by even a hair from the Will of God. . . . All these false reasons are utterly worthless."'36 It is not rabbinic logic which accounts for halakhah's reflection of divine 132.

Thus, while he agrees with his pupil about the absurd inconsistencies of rabbinic reasoning, the teacher's graphic explanations of the supernal activities triggered by the proper per- formance of mizvot ultimately confirm the wisdom of the law. Why is the topic of gender-specific precepts of special interest to the kabbalist?'37 As is not the case with laws that are applicable to all people or those which may be performed at all times, the gender-specificity and the temporal-specificity of these mizvot highlight the existence of boundaries within the Godhead: between the sacred and its nonsacred mirror image,'38 between male and female, and between the timeless and the time-bound. Kabbalistic precursors of Sefer HaKanah had already articulated elaborate theories about the relationships between masculine and feminine hypos- tases, or sefirot, within the Godhead.'39 Both the gender-specificity of the biblical language used in connection with particular precepts,'40 and rabbin- ic teachings designating commandments as incumbent upon males or females, provided earlier mystics with a wealth of opportunities for the exposition of supernal truths about the conjugation of divine hypostases.141 Drawing upon a rich trove of mythical associations, kabbalists even went on to describe certain aspects of a given precept as masculine and other aspects as feminine.'42 137. Cf. Jacob Katz's observation that pre-zoharic kabbalistic literature refers most frequently to those mizvot which earlier midrashim had endowed with mystical significance and to other mizvot the details of which (e.g., numerical associations,) made them easily identifiable with divine attributes.

The kabbalists' conception of the Godhead as a hierarchical system allowed for both possibilities. According to their scheme, the first and high- est sefirah represents divinity in its pristine, limitless, and undifferentiated state,'43 while successive sefirot represent hypostases which only became "known" in the gradual process of divine self-revelation. Only the seven lower sefirot, they claimed, were connected with creation, and only they could be said to have identity within the realm of time, while the three uppermost sefirot were both higher than and antecedent to the process of creation. The kabbalists' documentation of the correspondence between boundar- ies occurring in the realm of halakhah and boundaries occurring within the Godhead reveals that rabbinic law is, in fact, the concrete (and objective) expression of ontological reality. While all precepts "hint" at particular aspects of God, gender-specific and temporally-specific mizvot are especial- ly well suited to the kabbalist's description of the cosmic roles played by dif- ferent divine hypostases: male sefirot as opposed to female sefirot, or sefirot which are "above" the realm of time as opposed to those which are tempor- ally defined. The sefirotic interpretations of mizvot highlight Kabbalah's superior explanatory powers as compared with halakhah. Sefer HaKanah's interest in gender-specific commandments can thus be explained on the purely internal grounds of preference for a particular hermeneutic system, without any reference to environmental stimuli. Indeed, the fact that Sefer HaKanah's systemically-referential criticisms seem to have been triggered by nothing other than contact with the texts of rabbinic culture and a zealously embraced method of reading, impedes the detection and identifi- cation of any live voices in the author's environment who may have dis- cussed the issue of gender-specific commandments. It is quite possible that 143. The precise relationship between the uppermost sefirah and the realm of the undifferen- tiated Ein Sof is defined differently in different kabbalistic systems.</page><page sequence="32">230 TAYLA FISHMAN the treatise's focus on this topic was merely intended to provide a forum for the exposition of the author's method.'44 Thus, for example, the teacher's explanation of the kabbalistic meaning of Torah study explains why the sages compared this precept-which applies at all times-to commandments which are only performed at a speci- fic time, a comparison which had led to the rabbinic assertion that women are exempt from its performance.'45 The teacher explains that command- ments which are not time-bound, Torah study among them, "hint" at ori- gins lema'la min hahekef("above the circumference") in the three uppermost sefirot. It is because of this rarefied ontological locus that they are temporal- ly undefined, for time as a delimiting factor only comes into play in the lower seven sefirot, those involved with creation itself. Why, then, are women exempt from the study of Torah, if performance of this command- ment is not limited to a particular time? The teacher's explanation reveals that Torah study exhibits characteristics both of time-bound precepts and of precepts which are practiceable at all time. Torah has its primordial roots in a place "above the circumference," namely, in the second sefirah of Hokhma. For this reason, the study of Torah pertains at all times.'46 However, as the sefirah Hokhma transcends and precedes the realm of creation, the roots of Torah are hidden. Torah itself only becomes accessible in the sixth sefirah of Tiferet, a later stage in the process of divine self-revelation. 47 Playing on the lexical connection between the words torah, or ("light"), and hora'ah ("instruction"), the Zohar asserts that Scripture is called "Torah" because it brings hidden mat- ters to light. Torah makes manifest truths from the nontemporal realm of divinity which lies above and before creation. And because Torah can only be approached through one of the seven lower sefirot which are temporally defined, women are exempt from the obligation of Torah study. 144.

Moving fluidly between an exposition of sefiro- tic interactions and a description of activities which take place within the human family, the teacher plays upon the kabbalistic conception of the feminine sefirah of Malkhut as the "house" of her husband Tiferet'48 and asserts that "the husband exempts the wife, for he blesses the house. And she needs nothing of her own accord."'49 As in his exposition of the sefirotic interactions stimulated by the perfor- mance of Torah study, the teacher's kabbalistic explanations of keriat shema'"50 and zizit'l5 similarly set forth the "higher" reasons for woman's exemption, and end with the assertion that her husband fulfills the com- mandment on her behalf. This line of reasoning also explains why women are not to wear phylacteries of the arm, notwithstanding the fact that Kab- balah associates this part of the tefilin with the feminine.152 The teacher's kabbalistic explanations even account for certain peculiar- ities of rabbinic hermeneutics. Challenging the arbitrariness of the rabbinic hekkesh between the precepts of Torah study and tefilin,'53 the pupil had asked why the sages formulated the issue in the way that they did, when they might just as easily have come to the opposite conclusion. Why did they not say, after all, that just as women are obligated to participate in Torah study, so they are obligated to perform the precept of tefilin?'54 In his response, the teacher explains the appropriateness of the rabbinic direction of compari- son. The precepts of Torah study and tefilin both "hint at" the sixth sefirah, Tiferet,'55 and would thus seem to be equivalent. However, in spite of this 148. See, e.g., Zohar 1.50b, II.120a. 149. Sefer HaKanah, p. 6b. Similarly, the children, i.e., the six sefirot of Creation, are also blessed through the husband of the household, i.e., Tiferet. Sefer HaKanah, p. 6b. 150. Ibid., p. 15a. 151. Ibid., p. 43a. 152. Ibid., p. 6b. An additional reason may be inferred from Sefer HaKanah's discussion of the transgression incurred when one interrupts the donning of phylacteries by speaking. According to the teacher, if one recites the blessing, dons the arm phylacteries, and then speaks before donning the head phylacteries, it appears as if his blessing was only intended for the arm phylacteries, which correspond to the tenth sefirah, Malkhut. In interrupting the performance of the ritual as a whole, the individual would thus be guilty of perud vekizzuz, i.e., of fragment- ing Divinity by mistaking the lowermost extremity for the whole.

This means that the commandment of Torah study is ontologically higher than that of tefilin (though the two are mathematically equivalent!). Hence, the teacher explains, while tefilin can be compared to Torah study, the reverse is not true, for the latter precept cannot be syllogistically compared to one which is lower than itself."' The pupil's challenges similarly provide the teacher with opportunities for expounding the cosmic logic of obligating women to fulfill certain pre- cepts. Alluding to the kabbalistic identification of prayer with the female sefirah Malkhut,'57 the teacher claims that even though women are not included in the commandment of Torah study, it is appropriate that they be obligated in prayer, because the root of prayer is found in the feminine.'58 Why are women included in the rabbinic "addition" to Yom Kippur which transforms it from a twenty-four-hour fast into one lasting twenty- five hours,'59 notwithstanding the fact that this addition is clearly a positive time-bound precept? Sefer HaKanah's teacher explains this kabbalistically with reference to the sin of Eve. In eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, which corresponds to the final sefirah, Malkhut,'60 Eve mistook this fruit for the source of divinity, thereby splitting off one of the hypostases from the Godhead as a whole.'6' In so doing, she committed the grave theological error of denying God's unity.'62 The addition of at least one hour from the ninth day of the month of Tishrei to the biblical fast of the tenth day is, in effect, a ritually dramatized affirmation of the indivisibility of the ninth and tenth sefirot, Yesod and Malkhut. This concrete gesture of overlap affirms 156. Sefer HaKanah, p. 6a. Similar reasoning appears in the teacher's deadpan reply to the pupil's presumably sarcastic observation that the sages would have made a more convincing case for women's exemption from tefilin had they compared it to circumcision.

According to Sefer HaKanah's teacher, the addition to the Yom Kippur fast is designed to preempt Samael's charge that the people of Israel are reenacting Eve's theological error of "splitting" divinity and mistaking the lowermost (and manifest) extremity for the whole. In short, Sefer Ha- Kanah's kabbalistic explanation holds that woman's earliest history necessitates her participation in the addition to the Yom Kippur fast, though this is a positive time-bound commandment.'63 Imagery of Gender Inversion The teacher's explanation of why women are included in the obligation to eat mazzah on the first night of Passover, notwithstanding the fact that this is a positive time-bound commandment, is particularly striking and may serve as a window onto the rich imagery of gender-transformation in medieval mystical literature. Sefer HaKanah's teacher appropriates the tra- ditional kabbalistic identification of mazzah with the female sefirah Malk- hut,164 and explains that with the banishment of hamez from the seven days of Passover-which correspond to the seven lower sefirot-she is left puri- fied, "an unblemished male lamb" (Exod. 12:5).'65 While the identification of the paschal sacrifice with the sefirah Malkhut is found in the Zohar,'66 this passage poses an obvious conceptual problem. Is Sefer HaKanah's teacher claiming that women are included in this positive time-bound command- ment because events in the sefirotic realm cause the sefirah Malkhut to undergo a temporary change of gender?'67 A recent study of sefirotic dynamics within zoharic Kabbalah sheds light on the process of cosmic gender transformation which underlies the his- 163.

Yet restoration of the pris- tine harmony by reunification of the male (right) and female (left) sides of the Godhead cannot take place in one fell swoop. Insofar as the female left side, which symbolizes the attribute of judgment, is dominant during the state of exile, the onset of the redemptive process is marked by its contain- ment within the (male) right side, which symbolizes divine love. While the left and the right are thus reunited within the Godhead, the containment of the former in the latter means that the left-female aspect, though present, is effectively hidden.'69 Only when the balance between the two realms has been (re)achieved can the united left and right sides be apparent in equal measure, without one aspect overpowering or containing the other."70 Turn- ing to Sefer HaKanah's explanation of women's obligation to eat mazzah on the first night of Passover, the apparent transformation of the feminine mazzah into an "unblemished male lamb" presumably signals the onset of the redemptive process, whereby the female left is subsumed in the male right. Though the feminine thus appears to have been eliminated, it has, in effect, been only temporarily concealed.'' The phenomenon of inverting gender symbols from female to male found in Sefer Hakanah and in the Zohar is diametrically opposed to the pattern of symbol inversion from male to female found in the writings of medieval Christian (male) mystics'72 and in the writings of some of the ecsta- tic kabbalists, such as Abraham Abulafia.'73 The reversal of gender symbols from male to female may reflect the male mystic's experience of being 168.

Indeed, during the Sinaitic revelation following the Passover celebrated in Egypt, the feminine left side reemerged as an equal partner with the male right side. This notion is set forth in the Zohar's discussion of why loaves of the previously banished hamez are brought as wave offerings on the festival of Shavuot.

In theurgic-theosophical Kabbalah, the practitioner does not experience the mystical encounter passively, but is, rather, an active agent whose behavior has impact upon the feminine sefirah of Malk- hut, thereby initiating change in the Godhead as a whole.'76 Destructive Consequences of Woman's Voluntary Ritual Performance Comparison of several of Sefer HaKanah's comments about gender- specific commandments with the corresponding rabbinic sources highlights the work's stringent tendencies. In interpreting the tannaitic debate about whether women may lay their hands over the sacrificial animal before it is slaughtered,"'77 the teacher sets forth programmatic guidelines regarding women's voluntary performance of commandments which they are not obli- gated to fulfill. By interweaving different layers of the text's meaning, he transforms the debate of sages into a confrontation between human and divine perspectives. In keeping with the Zohar, the teacher notes that the Oral Law, Mishnah 174. R. J. Z. Werblowsky, review of I. Tishby's Mishnat HaZohar, in Tarbiz 34 (1964): 204; Idel, Kabbalah, p. 210. 175. Bynum suggests that men were more inclined to utilize the imagery of symbolic inver- sion because "the precise gradations of society were self-definitions that might bear down with a psychological weight that demanded periodic release." Bynum, Holy Feast and Holy Fast, p. 286. The writings of Christian female mystics, on the other hand, display little use of gender inversion. Though medieval Christian women who sought to intensify the quality of their reli- gious experience might actually try to pass as men, disguising themselves in order to enter monasteries or make pilgrimages, Bynum notes that female mystics were more likely to utilize imagery of continuity and of oneness with all mankind.

It follows that this anonymous position, according to which "sons of Israel lay their hands over the sacrificial animal and daughters of Israel do not," must qualitative- ly outweigh the merely mortal position of R. Yose and R. Shimon, who claimed that women are permitted to participate in this ritual. The teacher's bi-level reading of the text thus recasts a legal dispute between peers into an uncontested narrative of the superiority of one exponent to the others. The hermeneutical implications of this interpretation are striking. The notion that sacred text may bear multiple levels of meaning is a commonplace of medieval Jewish thought,'79 widely applied to the reading of the Torah and of aggadot, the often opaque nonlegal passages in the rabbinic literature of antiquity.'80 The foregoing interpretation reveals that Sefer HaKanah's teacher extends this assumption of multiple meanings to juridical texts, implying that they are not to be taken at face value.'8' In identifying the Mishnah's anonymous statement as the voice of Divinity and making this the basis of his legal conclusion, Sefer HaKanah's teacher effectively erases the plain sense of the talmudic text and replaces it with the mystical mean- ing.'82 He concludes his excursus with a warning: Given that the stringent posi- tion articulated by the anonymous voice of the Mishnah embodies the divine will, any husband who permits his wife to perform commandments from which she is exempt, himself inclines toward iniquity. Though the husband's 178. Zohar II.166b, III.40b, and see Scholem, On the Kabbalah, pp. 47-50. Following the Zohar, Sefer HaKanah notes that the Oral Law, literally, the law which is transmitted by mouth, is associated with the tenth sefirah of Malkhut, or Kingship, citing, among other points of connection, the reference to the phrase "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth" (Song of Songs 1:2), where "him" refers to the King. 179.

Hanina's statement that one who is commanded and performs has a greater reward than one who performs though uncommanded.'84 This second-century dictum served as the basis for R. Tam's twelfth-century ruling that women may recite the blessing asher kiddeshanu bemizvotav vezivvanu ("who has sanctified us with his precepts and commanded us") when performing positive time-bound commandments, without violating the prohibition against taking God's name in vain.'"' Noting that the blind amora R. Yosef had rejoiced upon hearing this dictum,'6' R. Tam concluded that it must have been understood as an assertion that all who fulfill a precept receive some reward, even if they are uncommanded. Though subsequent Ashkenazi commentators dismissed the analogy between women and blind men on a variety of grounds,'87 they articulated alternative reasons for upholding R. Tam's ruling that women are permitted to recite blessings when they perform commandments from which they are exempt.'88 Sefer HaKanah's teacher reiterates these tradition- al explanations as to why women and blind men are not analogous.'89 However, in contrast to the talmudic commentators who articulated these distinctions, Sefer HaKanah's teacher concludes that R. Hanina's dictum cannot be invoked with respect to women. In other words, there are no grounds for assuming that women receive any reward for their performance of precepts from which they are exempt. And in a mirror image of R. Tam's ruling, the teacher declares that insofar as woman has no reason to perform 183. Sefer HaKanah, p. 76a. 184. Kid. 31a, B.K. 87a. 185. B.K. 87a, Kid. 31a.

Where the halakhic perspec- tive leaves woman with a measure of responsibility for her own recompense or, at worst, with that illusion, the teacher's kabbalistic perspective denies woman this responsibility, dispels the illusion, and entrusts her recompense to another. The teacher's kabbalistic pespective "forces" the resolution of an issue which is the subject of a dispute in rabbinic literature, unequivocally deter- mining both the halakhic question of whether women are permitted to per- form precepts from which they are exempt and the metahalakhic question of whether they receive reward for such performance. This creates a paradoxi- cal inversion of the expected situation: where the halakhic perspective offers guidance, the kabbalistic perspective legislates. Alongside the better-known sociological explanations of the dictum exempting women from positive time-bound commandments offered by Anatoli and Abudraham,'92 Sefer HaKanah presents a radical metaphysical explanation. Implicit in the teacher's remarks is the notion that this talmu- dic dictum reflects the halakhah's (perhaps unwitting) attempt to prevent 190. Sefer HaKanah, p. 76a. The teacher might have been expected to charge women in this situation with reciting a berakhah levatalah (i.e., a wasted blessing) in violation of the com- mandment against taking God's Name in vain. We might speculate that he avoided identifying this as their transgression in light of the discussion found in Tosafot Kid. 31a, Er. 96a-b; R. Nissim, R.H., no. 955. 191. Maimonides, M.T , Hil. Zizit 3:9; cf. Shulhan 'Arukh, O.H. 589:6. These rulings were quickly challenged and qualified by legists who held that women were permitted to recite bless- ings in such cases.

Like kabbalistic works in general, Sefer HaKanah regards the precept as a sacrament, an act which triggers specific effects in the realm of divinity. The notion that processes within the Godhead mirror human ritual actions is taken quite literally. Indeed, the identities of the performers themselves are integral to the sacra- ment, for the correspondence between the human microcosm and the divine macrocosm extends even to particulars of gender. In Sefer HaKanah, the divine hypostases have concrete references, such that the sefirah Tiferet is literally identified with the male performing the mizvah in question, and the sefirah of Malkut with his female consort of flesh and blood. If the needs of Malkhut are satisfied within the supernal realm, then that sefirah's human counterpart is expected to refrain from further initiative. Woman's volun- tary performance of a commandment already fulfilled by her husband would imply that the feminine sefirah Malkhut had not been satisfied by the act of her consort, Tiferet, and would thus challenge one of Sefer HaKanah's essential axioms. Unmandated performance registers as an expression of unmitigated skepticism about the system itself, and the faith of the perform- er is clearly a factor in the sacral effectiveness of kabbalistic ritual.195 However, according to Sefer HaKanah's teacher, woman's voluntary performance is not merely destructive of Kabbalah's credibility, it actually brings sefirot together in inauspicious, unharmonious configurations. Given 193. The futility of woman's voluntary performance of the precept of zizit is graphically conveyed in the teacher's depiction of woman's inability to approach the realm of the seven time-bound sefirot, entangled as she is in the colored eighth thread of the zizit. Sefer HaKanah, p. 43a. Here the teacher adopts the zoharic identification of tekhelet with the last sefirah, Malk- hut, the takhlit, or end, into which all the sefirot flow, which at the same time includes, i.e., kole- let, them all.

An examination of Sefer HaKanah's comments on the role of women in three aspects of Jewish ritual-circumcision, the fashioning of zizit (the ritual fringes worn by men on their four-cornered garments), and shehitah (ritual slaughter)-underscores the treatise's unique perspective. According to Sefer HaKanah's teacher, Jewish women must not perform circumcision under any circumstances. The foreskin, he claims, is a place of fire, a gathering place for the forces of impurity. It is only through fulfill- ment of the commandment of berit milah that this fire is extinguished.'97 However, the teacher notes, this act cannot be accomplished by a woman, for orthographically ishah ("woman") is composed of esh ("fire"), and fire cannot be used to extinguish fire.198 Woman, who corresponds to the femin- ine sefirah of Din (Judgment), cannot extirpate the powers of din embodied in the foreskin. If a woman were to perform this precept from which she is exempt, she would hardly be engaging in a religiously neutral (or meaning- less) act, but rather, in one disruptive of cosmic harmony. 196.

Ibid., p. 57a. In an oral communication, Dr. Elliot Wolfson has raised the question of whether the perspective of Sefer HaKanah's teacher represents a deviation from other kabbalis- tic attitudes on the sacral efficacy of "fighting fire with fire." Nahmanides' commentary on Num. 21:9 seems to view this as a potent strategy and uses it to explain the efficacy of the cop- per serpent in saving those Israelites who had been bitten by snakes. One way of harmonizing the perspectives of Nahmanides and Sefer HaKanah is to assume a basic difference between the case of the copper serpent, on the hand, and women's performance of circumcision on the other. The copper serpent (fashioned by Moses following God's advice) may be understood to represent the demonic force within the divine, which is capable of subju- gating the power of evil within the realm of Creation, thereby initiating the two-stage process of Redemption described by Wolfson. "The Left Contained in the Right," pp. 27-52. The forces of Judgment which woman embodies, on the other hand, are evidently not regarded by Sefer HaKanah's teacher as representative of the forces of Judgment within the Godhead, and are therefore unable to eradicate other forces of Judgment from outside the realm of Divinity.</page><page sequence="43">GENDER-SPECIFIC COMMANDMANTS 241 Hypernomism and Its Cultural Impact A survey of halakhic writings on this subject reveals the radicalness of Sefer HaKanah's position. In taking the position that Jewish women may not perform circumcision under any circumstances, Sefer HaKanah's teacher rejects a halakhic position articulated by R. Yohanan'99 and adopt- ed by R. Zemah Gaon,200 the Sheiltot,20' Halakhot Gedolot,202 Alfasi's tal- mudic commentary,203 Or Zaru'a,204 R. Simha b. Shemuel of Speyer,205 Sefer Halttur,206 Maimonides' Mishneh Torah,207 Temim De'im,208 and the Tur,209 all of which had ruled that a Jewish woman may perform circumcision if no male is available to serve as mohel. The claim of Sefer HaKanah's teacher that a Jewish woman must not perform circumcision under any circum- stances corresponds to the position taken in the thirteenth century by Tosa- fot210 and in the fourteenth century by Isaac of Corbeil,211 who adopted the minority viewpoint of Rav.212 Faced with the explicit biblical description of Zipporah's performance of circumcision, "Then Zipporah took a flint and she cut off the foreskin of her son" (Exod. 4:25), those holding this stringent viewpoint were forced to offer a radical rereading of the verse.

Medieval Ashkenazic sources testify to the fact that women did make zizit,214 and following the the view of the tannaim R. Yohanan and R. Yehuda, Tosafot had ruled that zizit made by women are ritually valid.215 Sefer HaKanah's teacher, however, rejects this ruling, dismissing it as an offensive concession to the times.216 In taking this perspective, he aligns him- self with the position articulated by R. Tam in twelfth-century France, who had declared that the fringes repaired by a woman of Troyes were unfit for ritual use insofar as she was not commanded to perform the mizvah of zizit.217 Writing in the thirteenth century, R. Meir of Rothenburg echoed this position, similarly invoking the ruling that anyone exempt from a com- mandment cannot assist others in fulfilling it.218 Rather than substantiating his position with any legal arguments, Sefer HaKanah's teacher justifies it by describing the sefirotic activity connected with the fashioning of zizit. The thirty-two threads of the fringes correspond 213. Ibid.; Sefer HaKanah, p. 61b. 214. In a poetic elegy to his wife, Dulcea, who was killed by crusaders in 1197, R.

Indeed, he deems such an act ritually invalid even if it has already taken place.220 Sefer HaKanah's posi- tion stands in opposition to decisions recorded in the Talmud,221 Tosafot,222 Maimonides' Mishneh Torah,223 and the corresponding commentary of the Hagahot Maimuniyyot, Moses of Coucy's Sefer Mizvot Gadol,224 Isaac of Corbeil's Sefer Mizvot Katan,225 Mordecai b.

And never have I witnessed the custom of [women's] shehitah. And therefore, they are not to be permitted to perform shehitah, for custom over- rules law [minhag mevatel halakhah], and the custom of our ancestors is Torah.235 Writing in the sixteenth century, R. Moses Isserles cites "the tradition of Erez Yisrael" (which he presemably knew of through the Agur, who knew it through Eldad HaDani), according to which women (and even women experts, he claims) should not perform shehitah. Isserles adds two reasons for this ruling: firstly, women are lightheaded,236 and secondly, they are like- ly to faint, "since most of them are fainters."237 Unlike the Agur, however, Isserles concludes that if a competent woman whose expertise is known has already performed a particular act of shehitah (i.e., when it is a fait accom- pli), then that particular act is ritually valid.238 The explanation offered by Sefer HaKanah's teacher as to why shehitah performed by women is invalid makes reference to a very different set of concerns. Just as an act of sacrifice causes the feminine sefirah, Malkhut, to draw near to her male counterpart, the sefirah Tiferet, which then channels the energy of both,239 so the slaughter of even nonsacrificial animals can only be carried out through the interaction of the female hypostasis of Din (Judgment) with the male hypostasis of Rahamim (Mercy), or perhaps the containment of the former within the latter. However, Sefer HaKanah adds, "the woman [i.e., the sefirah of Judgment] is brutal, and her thought is for- ever evil," and thus shehitah performed by a woman, even if it is already a fait accompli, is ritually invalid.240 235.

It may well be that the spread of kabbalistic teach- ings, and the transformation of optional or supererogatory matters of cus- tom into ontologically necessary practices, incumbent upon all Jews,241 led, among other things, to changes and curtailments in opportunities for women's participation in Jewish ritual. Finally, Sefer HaKanah's stringent perspective on women's participation in aspects of Jewish ritual must be examined for its possible impact not only upon subsequent legal writings, but also upon individual and societal atti- tudes. The comparison of Sefer HaKanah's stringent position regarding three particular laws with the underlying rabbinic literature reveals that while the teacher has adopted the conclusions articulated by earlier halakhic authorities, the rationale underlying his decisions differs radically from theirs. The positions of the halakhists-whether R. Isaac of Corbeil in the case of circumcision, R. Tam and R. Meir of Rothenburg regarding the making of zizit, or even the quasi-legalistic argument of the Agur regarding ritual slaughter-all refer to principles of the rabbinic legislative system and not to the image of woman or to her "inherent nature." Sefer HaKanah, on the other hand, transforms these same legal positions into, platforms for the exposition of metahalakhic conceptions about woman's nature. The trea- tise's introduction of kabbalistic explanations into the "universal solvent" of halakhic discourse brought new images into mainstream Jewish culture, among them the gender-linked stereotypes which are a hallmark of sefirotic theory. Through their very linkage to the realm of halakhah, kabbalistic works like Sefer HaKanah may well have influenced everyday notions about women's ineffectiveness, or even destructiveness, in aspects of Jewish ritual life.
