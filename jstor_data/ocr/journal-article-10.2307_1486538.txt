Bobbie Malone's well-researched and lucidly written study on Rabbi Max Heller of New Orleans constitutes one of the more recent examples of this important trend. In sharp contrast to the sentimentalism of many rabbinic autobiographies and filio-pietistic rabbinic histories, Malone's scholarly reconstruction of Heller's life is biography at its best; she has written a critical, thoroughly documented analysis that effectively places the focus of her study, Rabbi Max Heller, in the context of both the Jewish and the general society in which he functioned. Max Heller was born and raised in Bohemia. He came to the United States in 1879 after having been urged by his father to study at the newly founded rabbinical seminary in Cincinnati, Hebrew Union College (HUC). Heller quickly became one of Isaac Mayer Wise's loyal prot6ges, imbibing his mentor's determination to promulgate a Judaism that was "living, changing, developing" (p. 16). Heller was ordained in 1884--one of the five members of HUC's second class of rabbinic graduates. After spending his first two years in Chicago working under Rabbi Bernhard Felsenthal's tutelage, Heller was called to the pulpit of Temple Sinai in New Orleans. He spent the remainder of his rabbinate-forty years--serving as this congregation's spiritual leader. The impact of Heller's career extended beyond the boundaries of his synagogue; as a prolific correspondent and editor for several Jewish newspapers, as one of the Southland's most prominent clergymen, and as a national leader of the Reform movement, Heller assumes historical significance and earnestly merits the kind of in-depth examination Malone has proffered. As was true of many of those who considered Isaac Mayer Wise a "spiritual father" (p. 18), Heller's religious, philosophical, and scientific perspectives were grounded in the principles of Wissenschaft des Judentums. He was committed to the idea that modem Jewish scholarship was an indispensable tool in helping American Jewry cope with the realities of modernity. Despite his personal loyalty to Wise, and his commitment to the fundamental ideological tenets that characterized American Reform Judaism 1.

Time and again he challenged the prevailing wisdom of colleagues who insisted that their own conception of Reform Judaism as a relentlessly liberal and universal faith was utterly embodied in Isaac Mayer Wise's teachings. Many of the passionately cherished ideological canons of Heller's era were, from his perspective, trends that did not fully represent the ideals that his sainted teacher and mentor had cherished. From the beginning of his rabbinate, Heller advocated a heightened sense of spiritual zeal in Reform Judaism. He attacked those colleagues who in his view were attempting "to secularize [their] synagogues into liberal temples" by stripping "religious thoughts into bald philosophies [and] religious abstraction" (p. 86). Heller insisted that this spiritual approach no longer addressed the emotional needs of American Jewry. The people wanted Reform to be a religion that possessed "color, body, poetry, character" (ibid.), and his sermons repeatedly championed a Jewish faith that was "vivid in historic associations, rich in symbols, [and] strong in its clasp on life" (p. 73). Heller championed many controversial convictions that, as Malone notes, "were substantially ahead of their time" (p. xiii). Like many of his peers, for instance, Heller devoted himself to the cause of interfaith relations by fostering bonds of fellowship with the Christians of New Orleans. Yet it was in the realm of intra-Jewish relations that Heller's contributions merit special notice. Though he was a committed reformer, Heller nevertheless refused to join with those who upbraided Orthodoxy. He deplored intra-Jewish recriminations, and dedicated himself to the goal of "peaceable co-operation" between these two segments of the Jewish community. He took great pride in the respect and affection his equanimous conduct earned for him within the Orthodox community (p. 202). Perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of Heller's ideological independence was his eventual embrace of the Zionist cause. Despite the fact that there had always been a pro-Zionist presence within the Reform movement, the famed Pittsburgh Platform (1885)-the defacto creed of Reform Judaism--insisted that Jews viewed themselves as a religious community, not as a nation, and "therefore [did not] expect a return to Palestine."2 Heller's public "conversion" to Zionism in 1901 identified him as the first HUC-trained rabbi to embrace the Jewish national movement. His lifelong struggle to reconcile Reform and 2.

While many of his contemporaries believed that the massive influx of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe posed a grave threat to the social standard of Americanized native-born Jews, Heller defended these co-religionists vigorously. He called the Eastern European Jew a "Hebrew of the Hebrews," and he predicted that the immigrant's love of a "flesh-and-blood" Judaism would be the harbinger of a "spiritual renaissance" among American Jewry (p. 86). Another remarkable aspect of the rabbi's career was his firm and public dissension from the South's racial caste system. In 1910, he raised eyebrows throughout New Orleans by agreeing to address an African-American audi- ence and, in doing so, assured them of their right and duty "to confront the injustice of prejudice with the legitimate prepossessions of a strengthened loyalty" (p. 107). Students of civil rights in the South should take note of the fact that, as early as 1907, Heller used Temple Sinai's pulpit to urge his congregants to "pluck out from [their] hearts whatever racial, national or religious prejudice may dwell there" and to champion "the cause of the oppressed and downtrodden of all races and climes" (p. 101). All of these crusades were risky business for afin de siecle Southern rabbi. Heller's public espousal of Zionism and outspoken opposition to Classical Reform Judaism's "religious anemia" (p. 73) kept the Hebrew Union College from awarding him the honorary doctorate that was customarily conferred upon its distinguished alumni, and his frequent refusals to toe the party line in public almost cost him the presidency of the Central Conference of American Rabbis. As Malone aptly notes, these setbacks testify to the fact that, though Heller may not have been a revolutionary thinker, he clearly took Progressivism's fundamental ideals to heart. Mustering an obligatory list of picayune shortcomings serves no purpose in this instance; Malone provides her readers with a solid piece of scholarship, and the result is an insightful biography that sheds light on a broad range of 3.
