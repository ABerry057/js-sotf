<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review 30:2 (2006), 347-392 THE BOOK OF BEN SIRA IN RABBINIC LITERATURE by Jenny R. Labendz* The Book of Ben Sira1 is a wisdom composition written in Hebrew toward the beginning of the second century BCE. It is well preserved in a Greek trans- lation that, according to its prologue, was done by the author's grandson, and a Syriac translation of a few hundred years later is preserved in the Peshitta. Between fragments found at Masada and in the Cairo Geniza, some 60 percent of the book survives in Hebrew. Ben Sira acquired biblical status for many early Christians and was incor- porated into the Septuagint.2 Similarly, the work attained a high status in Second Temple Judaism, though later the rabbis would not afford it canonical status as part of the Hebrew Bible. Nevertheless, some rabbis definitely knew of Ben Sira and considered it a legitimate source of Jewish wisdom. In fact, Ben Sira is cited by name in both the Palestinian and Babylonian Talmuds, as well as the Palestinian midrashim of the Talmudic period. This makes Ben Sira unique among apocryphal works, and this paper seeks to explore Ben Sira's place within rabbinic literary culture. More specifically, what did the rabbis possess in the way of this book? The question is problematic at the outset, however, as the term "the rabbis" represents groups of people living in two different empires over the course of some 500 years. Previous scholarship on Ben Sira in rabbinic literature has not paid enough attention to this fact and therefore has not noticed that at different times and in different places, the rabbis possessed different materials.3 One must not *I am extremely grateful to Professors John J. Collins and Richard Kalmin for their helpful cor- rections and suggestions on this paper and for their encouragement. Thanks are also due to Professor Adam Becker for helping me with the Syriac and for reading over the paper, to Adam Parker for helping me with the Greek, and to Justin Dombrowski and Yoni Pomeranz for their generous editorial help. Any remaining mistakes are, of course, my own. 1. On the other titles used for the Book of Ben Sira, see Alexander A. Di Lella and Patrick W. Skehan, The Wisdom of Ben Sira (New York: Doubleday, 1987), 3-4; and M. Segal, Sefer Ben Sira ha-shalem (Jerusalem: Mossad Bialik, 1953), 1-3. The form "Sirach" reflects the Greek transliteration of Sira, as in the rendering "Josech" ('IwcoX) for the Hebrew name Yosse in Luke 3:26 (Segal, Ben Sira, 3). 2.

Labendz treat all rabbinic sources about Ben Sira as a single unit and look for one harmonious answer. In this paper, I will trace the references to and citations of Ben Sira through- out rabbinic literature. The early Palestinian rabbis were apparently open to study- ing Ben Sira, and they cite him numerous times. Furthermore, based on a comparison to extant versions of Ben Sira, they cite him accurately. The one problem they faced was the need to distinguish themselves from the Christians around them, who read Ben Sira alongside other biblical texts and afforded it a canonical status that the rabbis opposed. The rabbis accomplished this by treating Ben Sira as a quasi-rabbinic work rather than a quasi-biblical work, an attitude that is reflected in the citation formula they use, as I will explain later. But there is no hint of discomfort with Ben Sira or discontinuity in its availability for study. In contrast, the Book of Ben Sira does not appear to have arrived in Babylonia until the early fourth century. The Babylonian rabbis of the time had to decide what sort of reception it should have within the rabbinic community, with no history or tradition on which to rely. They knew that it was a Jewish book, but the propriety of its place in rabbinic learning was questionable because, among other concerns, their Christian neighbors in Mesopotamia used it in a Christian context. One fourth-century rabbi, R. Joseph, approved the work for Jewish use, albeit with some hesitation. After R. Joseph's time, Ben Sira is cited numerous times in the Babylonian Talmud. However, it is not cited as accurately as in the Palestinian citations, for a number of reasons that I will explain here. Before detailing these events and phenomena, it is necessary to discuss the citations of Ben Sira in rabbinic literature that are unattributed as such. These unattributed citations are numerous, but they are ultimately irrelevant to this paper. This point warrants explanation. A. THE UNATTRIBUTED CITATIONS When discussing rabbinic knowledge of Ben Sira, the earliest rabbinic source to which modern scholars point is a passage of the Mishnah that appears to cite Ben Sira, though without attribution. Mishnah Avot 4:44 reads, (2000): 103-11; David S. Levene, "Theology and Non-Theology in the Rabbinic Ben Sira," in Ben Sira's God: Proceedings of the International Ben Sira Conference (New York: Walter de Gruyter, 2002), 305-20. My point applies as well to the question posed by Maurice Gilbert, "The Book of Ben Sira: Implications for Jewish and Christian Traditions," in Jewish Civilization in the Hellenistic- Roman Period, ed. Shemaryahu Talmon (Sheffield, UK: Sheffield Academic Press, 1991), 85, 90. To a much lesser degree, it also applies to Sid Z. Leiman, The Canonization of Hebrew Scripture: The Talmudic and Midrashic Evidence (New Haven, CT: Archon, 1976), esp. 101-102. Though Leiman is sensitive to questions of geography and chronology, he is not as careful about distinguishing sources and layers within the Babylonian Talmud. 4. MS Kaufman 4:2.

Levitas of Yavneh says: Be very humble ofspirit, as the hope ofhumanity is a worm. This closely corresponds to Ben Sira 7:17,6 which is preserved in two Hebrew manuscripts (MS A and MS C):7 MS A: nn-i~ r1 nipr 'n m ? ~')E)Vn txn rn MS C: nfn 'L? our nilpni n motu n 7n 7To MS A: Lessen [your] pride very much, for the hope of humanity is a worm. MS C: Lessen [your] pride very much, for the hope of humanity isfor a worm. The minor differences between Ben Sira and R. Levitas of Yavneh derive from the latter's use of more rabbinic Hebrew phrasing. He opens with the prescriptive verb "'1in," which introduces prescriptive statements at least thirteen times in Tractate Avot alone; the more biblical "mnI'r is replaced with a more rabbinic locution, "rlnl"/"nnl ,va'8 and the biblical "Ilrmm" is replaced with the rabbinic "ro*n." All this, and the citation is still very close to Ben Sira. Later, in the amoraic period,9 there are two more examples of verses from Ben Sira cited in the name of a specific rabbi without attribution to Ben Sira, and there are also several examples of Ben Sira cited in amoraic literature as though it were a tannaitic source.10 Once in the Babylonian Talmud, it is even cited as though it were part of the hagiography (".' rnne")." 5. All translations are my own. 6. Throughout this paper, I use the verse numbering of Francesco Vattioni, Ecclesiastico. Testo Ebraico con apparato critico e versioni greca, latina e siriaca (Naples: Instituto Orientale di Napoli, 1968), which at times varies from Segal's numbering. I chose to use Vattioni's edition to facilitate the reader's comparison with the Greek and Syriac versions. 7. See the edition of Pancratius C. Beentjes, The Book ofBen Sira in Hebrew.: A Text Edition of All Extant Hebrew Manuscripts and a Synopsis of All Parallel Hebrew Ben Sira Texts (Leiden, UK: Brill, 1997). 8. Cf. Mishnah Avot 4:10 (4:9 in MS Kaufman). 9. This refers roughly to the period between 220 CE and 550 CE (see n. 26 for the difference in dating between the Babylonian and Palestinian amoraic periods), during which the Palestinian and Babylonian Talmuds and several Palestinian midrashim were composed. Rabbis of this period are referred to as Amoraim. 10. See Segal, Ben Sira, 38. Segal lists numerous examples in which rabbinic sources- spanning early Palestinian to late Babylonian-preserve an "echo" of a passage from Ben Sira, though without attribution (42). Segal notes that there are many more such examples, and they prove just how deeply Ben Sira's wisdom penetrated rabbinic thought. I have excluded these examples for two reasons: First, there is no definite link to Ben Sira in these sources, as the language and formulation-and sometimes the precise sense-is different. Second, most of these examples involve quite common themes, such as the importance of marrying off one's children, not hating oneself, choosing the better of two paths, the fleeting nature of material goods, Torah as a remedy for the evil inclination, the evil inclination ruling one's life, and so forth. Many such themes are present already in Proverbs and other biblical books, and even those that are not found explicitly else- where are natural outgrowths of ancient society and biblical or rabbinic wisdom, so that treating them as lessons taken directly from Ben Sira would be overly simplistic. 11. B. Baba Kama 92b, citing a conflation of Ben Sira 13:17b and 26:9a. 349</page><page sequence="4">Jenny R. Labendz As to the citations attributed to named rabbis, M. Segal points out quite reasonably that this probably reflects the fact that a particular verse was a favorite saying of that rabbi, just as verses from Proverbs are sometimes cited as though they were authored by rabbis (once in Mishnah Avot and once in the Babylonian Talmud).12 As to the citation of Ben Sira as biblical, the accuracy to be expected of a biblical citation in the Talmudic literature should not be overestimated. Some rabbis were undoubtedly experts in the Bible, but others clearly were not, and the Talmud itself admits this in several places, in addition to the manuscript evi- dence that shows variant citations.13 In the case of the Ben Sira citations in particu- lar, it would be easy for one who is not an expert in the Bible to believe that a verse from Ben Sira is actually a biblical verse from, for example, Proverbs or Psalms. Moreover, the rabbis were not the only ones to inadvertently cite biblical and other sources without attribution. Robert Owens points out that the Syriac church father Aphrahat, who will be relevant to this discussion later, often did the same despite his general practice of introducing biblical quotations with an attribution. In Aphrahat's Demonstrations, "a quoted passage often functions as a formal 'proof-text,' but equally often Aphrahat seems to fall into the language of his Bible unawares."14 What the unattributed citations indicate is that aphorisms of Ben Sira circu- lated orally, either as part of a compilation known as such or as popular wisdom sayings, in Palestine and in Babylonia, in tannaitic and in amoraic times. Indeed, it is typical and reasonable for wisdom literature to circulate atomistically and anonymously.'5 Along these lines, one of the Babylonian citations attributed to Ben Sira is not found in Ben Sira but is actually very close to the proverbs of Ahiqar.'6 In fact, the rabbis make their interest in such things clear by their frequent use of and inquiry into the many sentences in the Babylonian Talmud that are referred to as "',vtm 'n~ir rl"l"--"that which the people say," meaning a folk saying. The point is simply that in addition to the biblical books that the rabbis quote, there is also an amorphous body of sayings that was known to the Babylonian rabbis by memory, and it is not at all surprising to find sayings similar to or originating in 12. Segal, Ben Sira, 38. 13. See David Rosenthal, "'Al derekh tipulam shel hazal be-hilufei nusah ba-mikra'," in Sefer Yitzhak 'Aryeh Zeligman, ed. Alexander Rofe and Yair Zakovitch (Jerusalem: E.

Wright also entertains the possibility that unattributed rabbinic citations of Ben Sira may reflect less precise rabbinic knowledge of the Bible than is some- times assumed (Wright, "Rabbinic Knowledge of Ben Sira," 50 n. 25). 15. Leiman gives an example to demonstrate this: He says that rabbinic statements similar to verses in Ben Sira, which one might claim derived from the rabbis' firsthand knowledge of the book "are evidence only of Ben Sira's well known influence on ethical sayings circulating in Palestine. They no more prove that R. Akiba read Ben Sira, than a child's citing 'God helps them that help themselves' proves he has read Poor Richard's Almanac" (Leiman, The Canonization of Hebrew Scripture, 88). 16.

The goal of this paper is to assess the situation beyond this potentially scanty, oral, and atomistic rabbinic knowledge of some of the contents of Ben Sira. What did the rabbis consciously know as "Ben Sira"? B. TANNAITIC SOURCES In the tannaitic period (ca. 70-220 CE Palestine),17 only one source mentions the Book of Ben Sira by name. Tosefta Yadayim 2:13 reads, The Gospels,'" and the books of the heretics, do not defile the hands. The books'9 of Ben Sira and all of the books written from here on (i.e. after the biblical books),20 do not defile the hands. The topic here in the Tosefta is the holiness of these books, that is, their member- ship in the group of books known to the rabbis as "the holy writings," or what we would call the biblical canon. The rabbis indicate that a book is included in this category by stating that the book renders impure the hands that touch these scrolls directly.21 The Book of Ben Sira is separate from the Christian and heretical books, probably because the rabbis consider it a Jewish book (that is, it was written and studied by Jews and is a legitimate source of Jewish wisdom), but it is still unequivocally not canonical. There is no reason to doubt that the reference to Ben Sira is to a complete document, in writing, available to the rabbis at this time, at least similar to the versions we have today.22 The burden of proof would be on whoever argues that when the rabbis mention a book otherwise widely known in ancient Palestine, that the reference is to anything other than that book or that this book was unavailable to them. 17. There are very few rabbinic sources from Babylonia in the period preceding ca. 220 CE. See Isaiah Gafni, Yehudei Bavel be-tekufat ha-Talmud (Jerusalem: Merkaz Zalman Shazar, 1990), 52-91. 18. Leiman, The Canonization of Hebrew Scripture, 190-91 n. 511. 19. Ibid., 184, n. 413. There are several possible explanations for the plural reference to Ben Sira. In addition to those mentioned by Leiman, it is also possible that the plural is used simply because of its juxtaposition with three other groups of plural books. In any event, this pluralization need not affect our identification of the referent here. 20. On this rendering, which is accepted by Leiman as well, see Saul Lieberman, Hellenism in Jewish Palestine (1962; repr., New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1994), 190 n. 60; and Lieberman, Tosefet Rishonim (1939; repr., New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1999), 4:157. See also Y. Sussmann, "Torah she-ba'al peh: peshutah ke-mashma'ah," in Mehkerei Talmud 3.:1, ed. Y Sussmann and D. Rosenthal (Jerusalem: Magnes, 2005), 371-73. 21. Leiman, The Canonization of Hebrew Scripture, 102-24. Leiman's discussion is compli- cated, however, by his somewhat idiosyncratic definition of "canonization" (14-16). 22. I say "available" specifically because the Tosefta does not indicate widespread use or familiarity with its contents. We cannot know whether Tannaim actually read the Book of Ben Sira. However, were it not available or in the clear purview of these rabbis, there would have been no reason to mention it. 351</page><page sequence="6">Jenny R. Labendz C. THE AMORAIC PERIOD In the amoraic period (ca. 220-550 CE), we must differentiate between Palestinian and Babylonian sources. In fact, the situation with regard to rabbinic knowledge of Ben Sira in this period divides rather neatly along that geographic line, which is the main point of my paper. Segal provides the most comprehensive list of rabbinic references to Ben Sira23--throughout the entire rabbinic period and beyond it, including unattribu- ted references and references that only approximate extant texts of Ben Sira-but he does not give any attention to the geographic division.24 An examination of these sources (which I will include in detail later) reveals the following differences between Palestinian sources and Babylonian sources: 1. In Palestine, any time a passage from Ben Sira is cited, it is relatively close to extant versions of Ben Sira;25 in Babylonia, on the other hand, citations of Ben Sira also include versions that diverge significantly from or are not found at all in any extant text. The exception is the group of passages cited by R. Joseph in early-fourth-century Babylonia, which are very close to the extant versions of Ben Sira and which I will treat specifically below. 2. In Palestine, Ben Sira is sometimes quoted by an early named amora; in Babylonia, Ben Sira is only cited by the fourth-century R. Joseph and R. Aha b. Jacob; possibly R. Joseph's student, Abaye; and the anonymous Talmud. 3. In Palestine, all cited passages from Ben Sira are attested with an introductory phrase such as "Ben Sira said." In Babylonia, on the other hand, Ben Sira is quoted as a book: "It is written in the book of Ben Sira." From this internal evidence and other related data that I will present, I have drawn the following conclusions. After describing my conclusions, I will present and discuss each citation. I will begin with a reconstruction of the situation in amoraic Palestine. 23. Segal, Ben Sira, 37-42. 24. Nor does he make any chronological distinctions. He lists tannaitic sources alongside early medieval sources and treats all rabbinic literature--down to quite late midrash-as an undifferentiated mass. This is reasonable given his goal of showing the general prevalence of Ben Sira's wisdom among rabbinic thought and writings, but this paper seeks to examine the situation more closely. 25. I am comparing the relative closeness of Palestinian and Babylonian statements to Ben Sira. Because several versions of the Hebrew Ben Sira have survived, it is reasonable to assume that several versions existed already in late antiquity. For a convenient summary of the age-old issue of the com- plexity of the text witnesses to Ben Sira, see Segal, "The Evolution of the Hebrew Text of Ben Sira," 91-92. All I seek to show is that in amoraic Palestine, a version identifiable as the Book of Ben Sira was available to the rabbis, more so than was the case with Babylonian citations of Ben Sira. 352</page><page sequence="7">The Book of Ben Sira in Rabbinic Literature D. AMORAIC PALESTINE The Book of Ben Sira was known as a complete work (probably oral) to the Palestinian rabbis during the amoraic period (ca. 220-400 CE).26 This is under- stood both from the internal Talmudic evidence and external historical evidence. Because Ben Sira was available, at least in Greek, to the Christians in Palestine at that time, there is no reason to assume that the book would have been unavail- able to the rabbis or that the Hebrew text had already been lost. Furthermore, because of the closeness of the Palestinian rabbis' citations to extant Hebrew texts, there is no reason to assume that they did not possess a Hebrew copy of the book. It does not seem to have been widely studied, and certainly it was not as prevalent as many other biblical books, but at least some rabbis knew it well enough to quote from it accurately and to cite it by name, presumably expecting their audience to know which book they were referring to. Additionally, it has been shown that the paytan Yose ben Yose, who flour- ished in approximately the fifth century (perhaps as early as the fourth century) in Palestine-and possibly his predecessors as well-based piyyutim on the panegy- ric of Simon the High Priest in Ben Sira 50:5-10 and the "Praise of the fathers of old" in Ben Sira 44.27 The evidence for this is found in the theme, structure, and even specific lexical choices in Yose's piyyut in comparison to Ben Sira. A precise Sitz im Leben for Yose ben Yose and the other early paytanim is at present imposs- ible to determine, but they were unmistakably rabbinic Jews producing poetry for a Jewish liturgical context and made use of Ben Sira in the late amoraic (or immediately postamoraic) period in Palestine.28 Ben Sira was most certainly a book that was familiar to Jews as a legitimate source of Jewish inspiration. However, the rabbis who cite Ben Sira in their literature had to contend with a certain problem: The rabbis' Christian neighbors did not distinguish Ben Sira's status from that of many other biblical books. Insofar as we can speak of an early Christian canon, Ben Sira was part of it for many communities.29 The rabbis, on the other hand, determined early on that Ben Sira was not part of 26. The amoraic period in Palestine came to a close somewhat earlier than it did in Babylonia, and I am generously estimating 400 CE as a terminus ante quem for its conclusion. Scholarly debates place the close of the Palestinian Talmud between ca. 350 and 430. See H. L. Strack and G. Stemberger, Introduction to the Talmud and Midrash (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress, 1996), 170-71. 27. Cecil Roth, "Ecclesiasticus in the Synagogue Service," Journal of Biblical Literature 71, no. 3 (1952): 171-78; and A. Mirsky, Piyyutei Yose ben Yose (Jerusalem: Mossad Bialik, 1997), 7-14. 28. Leiman, The Canonization ofHebrew Scripture, 188 n. 487. In the context of Ben Sira's use in synagogue literature, Leiman notes that Ben Sira was particularly popular in Palestine (based on the fact that it appears in synagogue literature only in Palestine). That statement should probably be refined to indicate that Ben Sira was far more well known in Palestine than in Babylonia, specifically during the bulk of the amoraic period (see below). 29. The Christian canon was only officially determined by the church at the end of the fourth century. When I refer to an "early Christian canon," I simply mean those books that at least some groups of early Christians read in a religious context or to which they granted religious authority as scripture. See Aharon Cohen, "'Al ha-stirot be-yahasam shel hazal le-sefer Ben-Sira," 'Or hamizrah 21, no. 3 (1972): 169, who explains the rabbinic sources about Ben Sira in terms of this very problem, but only as an internal Jewish problem. That is, he asserts that based on the book's own merits and 353</page><page sequence="8">Jenny R. Labendz the canon.30 Thus, to distinguish Ben Sira from the biblical books, they cited Ben Sira as though he were a rabbi-"Ben Sira said ...," or "So-and-so said in the name of Ben Sira ..."-rather than as an author-"It is written in the Book of Ben Sira."31 The one and only time that it is referred to as the "Book of Ben Sira" (-' 1"m7 r n' d) in Palestinian rabbinic literature is when Simeon b. Shetah is reported as talking about it to King Yannai, a nonrabbi (Y. Berakhot 7:2 [11b] and parallels, second Palestinian source below). This suggests that the rabbis were aware of Ben Sira as a written work and of nonrabbis' familiarity with it primarily as such. Their avoidance of referring to Ben Sira as an author or as the title of a book thus reflects an important religious concern, not simply the form in which they knew these traditions. Citing a given piece of literature as an oral source rather than as a written source has more significance than perhaps meets the eye. Yaakov Sussmann recently published a long article on the subject of the orality of rabbinic litera- ture.32 In Appendix 11 of that article, Sussmann discusses the strong emphasis the rabbis placed on the differentiation between the period of "prophecy," the time during which the biblical books were composed, and the period of "wisdom," all subsequent time.33 "Wisdom" in this sense refers to nonbiblical compositions including works such as Ben Sira and rabbinic compositions. The differentiation was enforced by the necessary orality of anything nonbiblical. The impact of this was most striking with regard to rabbinic literature, as even when it grew to an enormous and cumbersome quantity of material, the rabbis were vigilant in its memorization and in the oral mode of learning it.34 Ultimately, Sussmann asserts that this was all a function of preserving the distinction between canonical and noncanonical material. Sussmann brings abundant evidence to show that the rabbis only refer to themselves reading, citing from a written source, or looking at a "book" with refer- ence to the Bible.35 All else was "said" or "recited" or "taught" orally. Other books existed, such as the "external books" (Mishnah Sanhedrin 10:1), secular books, and heretical books, but works bearing authority in the world of the rabbis-works that the rabbis felt were worthy of citation-were either biblical and therefore written or of the nonbiblical "wisdom" class (rabbinic) organic acceptance within the Jewish community, it stood out among noncanonized books as a candi- date for canonization. 30. Leiman, The Canonization of Hebrew Scripture, 132-34. 31. Referring to Ben Sira as a rabbi (that is, not with a title but in the role of a speaker rather than of an author, and at that, a speaker functioning as a rabbi would, playing the same sort of homiletical, teaching role) is so uniquely Palestinian that when the Talmudic passage containing Ben Sira 3:21-22, originating and appearing twice in Palestinian amoraic literature, is transferred to the Babylonian Talmud, the language is changed to read, "It is written in the Book of Ben Sira." See below on the Baby- lonian citation of Ben Sira as a book rather than as a rabbi. 32. Sussmann, "Torah she-ba'al peh," 209-384. 33. Ibid., 370-73. Not as in the technical term "wisdom literature." 34. Ibid. 35. Ibid., 259-66. 354</page><page sequence="9">The Book of Ben Sira in Rabbinic Literature and therefore oral.36 The citations of Ben Sira in Palestinian literature therefore mark Ben Sira as noncanonical. This perspective on orality and canonicity also explains Mishnah Sanhedrin 10:1. This Mishnah states in the name of R. Akiva that one who reads from the ~lm ncre- (external books) is denied a place in the world to come. If that categorization (which is a hapax legomenon in rabbinic literature) refers to the same group of books referred to in Tosefta Yadayim discussed previously- namely, Ben Sira and other postbiblical Jewish books37--and if R. Akiva means reading as opposed to reciting,38 then his point is to prevent people from considering them on the level of biblical books. R. Akiva does not forbid reading these books but includes reading them among a list of that which denies a person a place in the world to come. This list includes problematic theological stances; they are not legal offenses punish- able by the rabbinic court, but they are nevertheless denounced by the rabbis. Dis- respecting the boundaries of the rabbinic canon in favor of the Christian openness to later writings fits neatly into this list.39 36. Ibid., 238-39, n. 44. There are only two exceptions to this rule. The first is the citation of Ben Sira as a book in the Babylonian Talmud (see below). The second exception is Megilat Ta'anit, on which see the literature cited by Sussmann. Sussmann makes intermittent and inconsistent comments throughout his article about the possibly written nature of Aggadah, but the overall picture is still clearly stated. 37. Y. Sanhedrin 10:1, 28a includes Ben Sira in this category but excludes Homer and all other later books. The reason may be that Ben Sira posed a particular threat because it was, in fact, being confused with scripture or was particularly strongly determined as canonical by the Christians in Palestine. See also Leiman, The Canonization of Hebrew Scripture, 92: "The ban, then, was intended against all literature with biblical pretensions. Secular literature, such as the Homeric epics and Historio-legal literature, such as Megillath Taanith, were tolerated because they presented no threat to the received biblical canon." 38. This is close to the views of Krochmal, Ginzberg, Bloch, and Haran, who hold that it is a ban against formal reading in a synagogue or public context, and against those of Buhl and Zeitlin, who hold that the ban includes even casual reading, which would imply an opposition to the content of the book rather than a statement about its status. See Leiman, The Canonization of Hebrew Scripture, 87, 182 n. 375-89 for references to the works of these scholars and 86-92 for his own discussion. I disagree with Leiman's claim (88) that Kohelet Rabbah 12:12 (a post-Talmudic Palestinian midrash), which states that one should not "bring into his home more than the 24 books [of the Bible]," indicates that this source opposes even casual reading. The condemnation of bringing these books into the home is polemical and may be figurative, meaning something like, "Do not add any books to your library of sacred books; if you have a set of twenty-four, add nothing." See also Lieberman, Hellenism in Jewish Palestine, 108-10. 39. Cf. the commentary of David Frankel (d. 1762), Shayarei Korban to Y. Sanhedrin 10:1, and of David Luria (d. 1855), Hidushei ha-Radal to Kohelet Rabbah 12:12. Based on these sources, Y. Steinberger, "Sefer Ben Sira ve-'isur ha-kri'ah bo'," Shannah be-shannah (1996): 432-34, arrives at basically the same conclusions as I do here. It is important to note that in this Mishnah, it is not par- ticular physical actions that are denounced as such but (particularly for R. Akiva but for the rest as well) expressions that reflect a theoretical problem. For example, the Mishnah begins by denouncing "one who says there is no resurrection of the dead." (The Yemenite MS of B. Sanhedrin and the printed edition of the Mishnah add a phrase indicating that the reference is to a person who denies that the res- urrection of the dead may be learned from the Torah, but the Cambridge, Parma, Paris, and Kaufmann 355</page><page sequence="10">Jenny R. Labendz In Palestine then, apparently there was a concerted effort on the part of the rabbis, both tannaitic and amoraic, to keep Ben Sira from being mistakenly considered canonical. At the same time, they appear to have been satisfied with the precautions they took, as they cite Ben Sira numerous times. Furthermore, because the work was known to at least some rabbis-whether in written or oral form-continuously since the tannaitic period, the integrity of the work was maintained, and the Palestinian rabbinic citations of Ben Sira are quite accurate. This situation, however, was unique to Palestine, in large part because of the uninterrupted (oral) presence of the Hebrew Book of Ben Sira in rabbinic circles in that part of the world. The same does not hold true of Babylonia. E. AMORAIC BABYLONIA: THE EARLY PERIOD The general situation with regard to Ben Sira and the rabbis was different in Babylonia. Furthermore, the chronological layers in the Babylonian Talmud reveal different situations at different times. For the purposes of this topic, we can speak of the early amoraic period (ca. 220-325 CE) up to R. Joseph and the later amoraic period (ca. 325-550 CE), which saw the advent of much anonymous material in the Talmud. There are no statements about or citations from the Book of Ben Sira from the early amoraic period in Babylonia.40 Not a single named Amora before R. Joseph exhibits any firsthand knowledge of the book. Furthermore, there is no evidence of Christians in Babylonia knowing the book of Ben Sira-in Hebrew or Syriac-in this period. This suddenly changes in the early fourth century, for the rabbis with R. Joseph and for the Christians with Aphrahat, the Syriac church father who flourished at about the same time as R. Joseph, probably not far from him.41 The translation of Ben Sira into Syriac (the Aramaic dialect of Eastern Christians) is difficult to date exactly or to place in a cultural setting.42 The Syriac was MSS of the Mishnah exclude that phrase.) It is not the physical saying that is the problem but the dis- belief that such a statement reflects. Similarly, physically reading these books is not the problem; the problem is the belief in their canonical status that is implied by reading them rather than reciting them. 40. With the exception of unattributed citations, on which see above. 41. Aphrahat's writing is the earliest known Christian literary source from the Sassanian Empire, which means that we cannot know with certainty the extent to which anything he wrote was revolutionary or represented the introduction of new texts or ideas. Nevertheless, the correspon- dence between the date and location of this earliest known Christian use of Ben Sira in Sassanian Mesopotamia and its first appearance in Babylonian rabbinic literature is striking. In other areas of Mesopotamia, some Syriac Christian literature from before Aphrahat's time is extant, but it contains no references to Ben Sira. See Robert Murray, "The Characteristics of the Earliest Syriac Christianity," in East of Byzantium: Syria and Armenia in the Formative Period, ed. Nina G. Garsoifan et al. (Washington DC: Dumbarton Oaks Center for Byzantine Studies, 1982), 3-6. 42. It is unclear whether the Syriac translation of Ben Sira originated in Jewish or Christian circles, especially because it has some features that resonate with rabbinic sources or ideas and some 356</page><page sequence="11">The Book of Ben Sira in Rabbinic Literature translated from a Hebrew original, which at least proves that there was a Hebrew version of the book to be found in Syriac-speaking communities at the time of the translation.43 The writings of Aphrahat provide a terminus ante quem for the appearance of a Syriac translation, very close if not identical to the Peshitta. That is, in the early fourth century, Aphrahat began to cite Ben Sira explicitly and make use of this book as scripture.44 Whether Aphrahat's interest in Ben Sira was spurred by the advent of a Syriac translation only then or by some other factor, such as a general interest in Western literature (see below), is impossible to say for sure. Either way, the early fourth century saw the first use of Ben Sira in Eastern Christian sources (at least, among those that have survived).45 So, too, in Babylonian rabbinic sources. The first evidence for this can be found in a Talmudic passage at B. Sanhedrin 100b that contains the only dis- cussion about the Book of Ben Sira in the Babylonian Talmud and includes numerous citations of Ben Sira. Rather than present the passage in its final redacted form, I will treat the layers within it in chronological order. I will begin with R. Joseph (early fourth century), who is the earlier of the two named Amoraim in this passage. R. Joseph's first statement is a response to Mishnah Sanhedrin 10:1 (discussed earlier) which contains R. Akiva's reproof of reading "outside books." The Talmud opens with the citation from the Mishnah: E2'1211777 7 n lIDOM1 91l K "InIN l'i31 "l R. Akiva says, also the one who reads the external books. The Talmud then says, Teach: books of heretics. that resonate with Christian sources or ideas. On this ambiguity, see Wido van Peursen, "The Peshitta of Ben Sira: Jewish and/or Christian?" Aramaic Studies 2, no. 2 (2004): 243-62. It has been suggested that the original translation was done by Syriac-speaking Jews, but it was redone or glossed by Christians sometime around the fourth century. See Milward Douglas Nelson, The Syriac Version of the Wisdom of Ben Sira Compared to the Greek and Hebrew Materials (Atlanta, GA: Scholars Press, 1988), 132. Segal, Ben Sira, 63, dates the Syriac translation not before 300 CE and probably just around then. Segal dates the translation specifically at that time because he believes that at 41:27, the translator used a statement of R. Huna (a second-generation Babylonian rabbi) and then elaborated on it because he had difficulty rendering an original translation of this section from the Hebrew. In any case, the fact that a translation was present by the time of Aphrahat indicates that an original Hebrew was also present at that time, and perhaps upon learning of the translation, Jews may have sought out the original Hebrew. 43. See Segal, "The Evolution of the Hebrew Text of Ben Sira," 110, 113-14; Segal, Ben Sira, 59; and Van Peursen, "The Peshitta of Ben Sira," 246-47. 44. Owens, "The Early Syriac Text of Ben Sira," 39-75. 45. See n. 41. 357</page><page sequence="12">Jenny R. Labendz The exact function of the word "raxn" (teach) is hard to determine, as words such as this can either function as an emendation of the Mishnah or as a commentary on the Mishnah.46 Either way, heretical books are included in those that one should not read, according to this interpretation of R. Akiva.47 R. Joseph's statement appears next. Two basic versions of R. Joseph's statement are preserved in the manuscript tradition. In the Eastern version (on the right), he responds to the anonymous state- ment preceding him (which included heretical books in those that one should not read), and in the Western version (on the left), he appears to be responding directly to the Mishnah. The meaning in both, however, is basically the same: MSS Karlsruhe, Munich, Florence, and ed. princ.:48 "lox "m X'-r "lEO 7 ' 1?-sx FlO "loll R. Joseph said: Even the Book ofBen Sira it is also forbidden to read. MS Yemen, Agadot haTalmud, and Geniza Fragment U:49 R. Joseph said: The Book of Ben Sira also is like the books of the heretics. A third and probably superior version of this line appears in another geniza fragment.50 It reads, R. Joseph said: And the Book of Ben Sira is also like the external books. 46. Sussmann, "Torah she-ba'al peh," 338-39, n. 39. 47. In fact, if R. Akiva's point is as I have described here, and if the problem he addresses is not knowledge of the contents of the outside books but reading them rather than reciting them, then this may be the first misunderstanding of R. Akiva's statement. Because the Babylonian Talmud's problem with heretical books does not appear to be their canonical pretensions but their contents, the understanding of "reading" includes knowing the heretical books. This contrasts with the Palestinian Talmud's comment on this Mishnah, which is quite in keeping with the explanation given earlier. The Palestinian Talmud's paradigmatic example of "external books" is the Book of Ben Sira, and it contrasts the reading of this and other such books with the reading of books such as Homer, which is no worse than reading a letter. The Babylonian Talmud's (mis)understanding of the Mishnah need not, however, be assumed of R. Joseph's statement as well, which follows this anonymous comment. 48. See Mordechai Sabato, K'tav Yad Teimani le-Masekhet Sanhedrin (Bavli) u-Mekomo be-Masoret ha-Nosah (Jerusalem: Yad Izhak Ben-Zvi/Hebrew University Institute of Jewish Studies, 1998), 109. The precise citation here is from MS Florence, merely because it contains the fullest spellings. 49. See Ibid., 109, 22, for a description of the geniza fragment. The precise citation I have included is from the Yemenite manuscript. "Geniza Fragment U" refers to Leningrad Antonin 899, fol- lowing Sabato's list, K'tav Yad Teimani, 15-23. It should be noted that in the fragment, the word ",,'," is mistakenly replaced with ",Wx." 50. Cam. West. Talm. 1 106. For some reason, Sabato does not include this text in his synopsis of this line (K'tav Yad Teimani, 109), even though he lists the fragment in his introduction as "GU" (21). 51. From the microfilmed copy of this fragment, I could not quite tell if there is an additional ""' at the end of this word, rendering it plural, as in T. Yadayim (see n. 19). 358</page><page sequence="13">The Book of Ben Sira in Rabbinic Literature In this version, R. Joseph responds to the Mishnah itself, as in the Western version; unlike the Western version, however, he does not introduce the legal language of Ben Sira being actually "forbidden" to read. Thus, this version is similar to the other Eastern witnesses. The difference between this third version and the other Eastern witnesses is that this one compares Ben Sira to the "external books" rather than the "books of the heretics."52 It is important to take note of all three of these versions, none of which bears any absolute sign of superiority, as a reminder not to draw overstated conclusions from a version that is not consistently attested (such as the introduction of the legal language of "forbidden" or R. Joseph's mention of heretical books). I have drawn my conclusions mainly from the meaning shared by all the versions. R. Joseph felt that "external books" and "books of heretics" did not clearly include the Book of Ben Sira and that the latter needed to be added explicitly. We cannot say with certainty why he felt this way, but perhaps this had to do with its special status-more on practical grounds than on theological grounds-as a wisdom book that suddenly became important to the Christians in or near Babylonia.53 Whatever the case may be, the force of R. Joseph's statement is to 52. This may be to the result of a mistake in the other Eastern witnesses; they may have mistakenly-even purposely-changed the phrase "nm'rnn nOmIOD" to "nIn' E' OD" to conform to the preceding line ("~'r 'non~ n"). This is plausible given that in the Yemenite manuscript, R. Joseph's statement appears directly beneath that first line (" ,-' i 'nem cjn"). But it must also be noted that in the Cambridge Geniza fragment, the two lines are similarly aligned, and it is equally plaus- ible that the scribe of the geniza text wrote "D~'~nn ,n,'~" under the influence of that phrase in the preceding line. Nevertheless, I prefer the Cambridge Geniza version because it avoids the misunder- standing of R. Akiva's statement in the Mishnah, which would render it an issue of the content of the book rather than its status. Still, R. Joseph's statement makes sense and bears essentially the same meaning in each of the three versions. 53. It is difficult to say much about the closeness of the rabbis to the Christian community in Babylonia-its sources, traditions, and internal politics-mainly because of the scarcity of references to Christianity in rabbinic sources and the lack of Babylonian Jewish sources besides the rabbinic literature. Furthermore, very few Talmud scholars have given the topic much attention. Nevertheless, Adam H. Becker puts forth a compelling argument about the social and religious connections between Jews and Christians in fourth-century Sassanian Persia in his article "Beyond the Spatial and Temporal Lines: Questioning the 'Parting of the Ways' Outside the Roman Empire," in The Ways that Never Parted: Jews and Christians in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages (Tiibingen, Germany: Mohr Siebeck, 2003), 374-82. He argues, based on Syriac sources, that the fourth century, largely because of the Persian persecution of Christians in the East, simultaneously saw an increasingly pro- minent connection between Jews and Christians as Christians sought refuge among their neighbors and a vehement increase in rhetoric from Christian leaders-Aphrahat in particular-to stop that process. This sort of social and cultural nexus certainly leaves room for the rabbis at this time to have been concerned with the Christian use of Ben Sira. See also Naomi Koltun-Fromm, "A Jewish Christian Conversation in Fourth-Century Persian Mesopotamia," Journal of Jewish Studies 47 (1996): 52-53, who points out that the Talmud itself (Bavli Kiddushin 73a) attests to a phenomenon of many converts in the mid-fourth century and suggests that this is related to the persecutions. She adduces this as part of her larger argument that there was, in fact, a great deal of contact between Jews and Christians in the fourth century, not only in the Roman Empire but in the Sassanian Empire as well. The details of Koltun-Fromm's general argument are suspect, however: She is not careful about dating the rabbinic material she cites but wishes to use it for an argument about a very 359</page><page sequence="14">Jenny R. Labendz say that one may not read from the Book of Ben Sira. On its own, this statement says little more than that (1) there was something problematic about the Book of Ben Sira, and (2) R. Joseph's response to that problem was to forbid (in one version he uses explicitly legal language rather than the polemical language of the Mishnah) reading it. As described previously, it seems that the issue at hand is one of canonical pretensions.54 Skipping for the moment the extended response of Abaye to this point, R. Joseph makes another comment further down in the same passage, and then he cites--quite accurately-a group of passages from Ben Sira.55 Again, two ver- sions of this statement are preserved in the manuscript tradition, but one version is attested only in the Florence manuscript and the editio princeps (Barco, Italy, 1498) and merely omits the opening phrase.56 In the Munich and Karlsruhe specific span of time, namely, Aphrahat's lifetime. Still, she raises an important point about Jewish- Christian interactions in Babylonia. Cf. Sebastian Brock, "Jewish Traditions in Syriac Sources," Journal of Jewish Studies 30 (1979): 212-32; and Frank Gavin, "Aphrahates and the Jews: A Study of the Controversial Homilies of the Persian Sage in Their Relation to Jewish Thought," Journal of the Society of Oriental Research 7 (1923): 95-166. On the other side stands Jacob Neusner, Aphrahat and Judaism: The Christian-Jewish Argument in Fourth Century Iran (Leiden, UK: Brill, 1971), 144- 95, who restricts any interaction between Jews and Christians in Persia to nonrabbinic Babylonian Jews. He sees little if any knowledge of either rabbinic Judaism on the part of Aphrahat or Aphrahat and Syriac Christianity on the part of the rabbis. However, his study mainly regards the methods and contents of exegesis and specific literary connections (which he argues against), drawing con- clusions about social realities. In contrast (both in methodology and conclusions), see Shlomo Naeh, "Freedom and Celibacy: A Talmudic Variation on Tales of Temptation and Fall in Genesis and its Syrian Background," in The Book of Genesis in Jewish and Oriental Christian Interpretation, ed. Judith Frishman and Lucas van Rompay (Leuven, Belgium: Peeters, 1997), 73-89, for an excellent example of rabbinic cultural familiarity with a Syriac Christian social and literary motif. Naeh derives his findings from a close reading of one Babylonian rabbinic source, both in its rabbinic context and alongside Syriac sources and Christian history. 54. In R. Joseph's statement, Ben Sira is completely distinct from the heretical books. Saying that one is "like" the other is a legal point, indicating that the rules that apply to one-here, that it may not be read-apply to the other, but it need not indicate that the rules apply for the same reason(s) with regard to both. 55. There is no direct relationship between R. Joseph's second comment and Abaye's comments in response to R. Joseph's first statement. 56. The phrase deleted in these two text witnesses is the reference to the Book of Ben Sira having been taken out of circulation. These two witnesses derive from Italy, one from the end of the fifteenth century and one that is not datable (Sabato, K'tav Yad Teimani, 10-11). The phrase is also omitted in one of the two geniza fragments of this section (Leningrad Antonin 899), but this fragment also contains a blatant error a few lines earlier-namely, it reads (contrary to every other witness), "''D N11 1" ?'" instead of "~a an'o p 7rl." Also, it reads, "lp'tt'7 n'K ~Tn,, '" ,,t," omitting the word "nma." Still, I cannot account for a good reason why the error (if it is an error) of omitting this phrase would have been made. 360</page><page sequence="15">The Book of Ben Sira in Rabbinic Literature manuscripts, the phrase appears in the margin. Therefore, I have followed the Yemenite manuscript, which reads smoothly: Said R. Joseph: Even though they removed the Book ofBen Sira from circula- tion,58 such as these excellent statements in it, we recite. The word "lpon" (we recite) is attested only in this manuscript. In the other manuscripts and the geniza fragment,59 the word is "l2 7Flt?" (we expound). Functionally, the meaning is the same; each word refers to a different aspect of what one is allowed to do with this book, even though it is no longer in circulation, preventing one from reading it. The verb "lpoml" is specifically used throughout rabbinic literature to refer to recitation as opposed to reading, and it is character- istic only of rabbinic materials, in contrast to scripture.60 Similarly, the verb "lp'Z7" refers to the paradigmatic rabbinic activity of interpretation. The object of the verb can be the Bible, which would imply that Ben Sira would be treated as scripture. But it can also be an intransitive verb, and a Ben Sira citation itself may be the content of a homily.61 In fact, this appears to be how R. Joseph uses the group of Ben Sira citations that follows this comment. These statements, which individually are accurate citations of Ben Sira, are woven together in what might be seen as a midrashic or paytanic rendering. The genres of both midrash and piyyut excel in arranging and juxtapos- ing disparate verses to make a point or to stress a theme.62 Turning now to the first part of R. Joseph's statement, he refers to the Book of Ben Sira as having been taken out of circulation sometime in the past.63 This is not an assertion; he is not informing his audience of something they did not know. Rather, he refers to a historical event in which the rabbis took the Book of Ben Sira out of circulation, an event he assumes his audience is familiar with. So R. Joseph 57. MS Munich reads, "i 'E;n li' 1~ I 0 T18' ':8" (Were it not that the rabbis removed that book from circulation), but I believe this is not reliable because (1) it is a correction in the margin, and (2) MSS Karlsruhe and Yemen oppose it in both the words ","Yn" and ",1=." As to the phrase "X'00 'KnV," MS Karlsruhe's marginal gloss does include the word " 'nc" but actually says "w'il l K ', c'Ki." It is possible, of course, that the scribe of MS Munich wanted to save space and time and merely cut out the phrase "s'0 1l7." Sabato notes that MS Karslruhe, an Ashkenazi (Western) manuscript, contains many errors but also sometimes contains marginalia with a version close to or identical to MS Yemen, which Sabato considers generally superior (Sabato, K'tav Yad Teimani, 10). 58.

An example of this sort of midrashic stringing together of biblical verses in the Babylonian Talmud may be found at the end of Tractate Berakhot. An exegesis of Isaiah 54:13 is followed, without explanation or discussion, by Psalms 119:165, 122:7-9, 29:11. 63. For other rabbinic references to books that were hidden or that the rabbis considered hiding, see M. Pesahim 4:9, Vayikra Rabba, Emor par 28, to Leviticus 23:10 (ed. Margoliot, 3:648-49), and B. Shabbat 30b. 361</page><page sequence="16">Jenny R. Labendz is referring to some book that was known by Babylonian rabbis to have been avail- able formerly in rabbinic circles (perhaps by its mention in the Tosefta) but has not been available to them (at least in Babylonia) for some time. R. Joseph refers to the book, not as it is referred to in later citations in the Babylonian Talmud (see below) but in its Aramaic form, " Kn7'i 1n i0o." It will be recalled that this is the form used in Yerushalmi Berakhot 7:2 (11b) and its parallels, the only Palestinian source that deviates from referring to Ben Sira as a rabbi and that refers to his book. As noted previously, in that instance, it appears to be because the book is being cited to a nonrabbi, who presumably knows Ben Sira as an author of a book in writing. Therefore, we might see in this form of reference to the Book of Ben Sira a hint that what is being referred to is the pseudoscriptural book used by the Chris- tians as opposed to the rabbinic, nonbiblical, oral work that R. Joseph rec- ommends to his community.64 Thus R. Joseph is saying the following: The Christian Book of Ben Sira has been taken out of circulation; our oral traditions, however, are acceptable. R. Joseph sees the book as one that is shared by Christians (or other groups) who read Ben Sira alongside other biblical books. This is in keeping with what we know about Ben Sira's emergence in Syriac sources at this time. It suddenly (re)appeared for the rabbis, represented here by R. Joseph, in the early fourth century. The first aspect of the Babylonian rabbinic response is similar to the Palestinian rabbinic stance: Do not regard it as canonical; differentiate yourselves from the Christians. On the other hand, R. Joseph decides that Ben Sira may ultimately be incorporated into the rabbinic tradition, so long as it is done orally and selectively ("the excellent statements within it"). This part of his statement reflects the other direction from which he encountered the Book of Ben Sira-namely, from the Palestinian rabbinic sources and traditions containing references to Ben Sira that arrived in Babylonia around this time. The phenomenon of fourth-century Babylonian rabbis incorporating and taking up a newfound interest in Palestinian rabbinic sources has long been noted in Talmudic scholarship.65 This likely included enough material about the wisdom sage known as Ben Sira, or perhaps the Hebrew Book of Ben Sira itself, to convince R. Joseph that it was indeed a Jewish book worthy of inclusion in homilies and Talmudic discourse. He familiarized himself with the contents of the work and cited its "excellent statements" quite accurately. One other Babylonian rabbi cites Ben Sira at the same time and with the same degree accuracy as R. Joseph, his contemporary R. Aha b. Jacob. At B. Hagiga 13a, he cites a verse from Ben Sira (with attribution) that appears in two Palestinian sources, all corresponding quite closely to extant texts of 64. The fact that the statement is in Aramaic does not diminish the relevance of the book title being in Aramaic. When quoting Hebrew or referring to a book, institution, or principle known in Hebrew, the rabbis had no problem using the Hebrew in their otherwise Aramaic statements. The most obvious example is the common phrase (see below) "xr'n p 13 nDn"--it is written (Aramaic) in the Book of Ben Sira (Hebrew). 65. Tzvi Dor, Torat erez yisrael be-Bavel (Tel Aviv: Dvir, 1971). 362</page><page sequence="17">The Book of Ben Sira in Rabbinic Literature Ben Sira (see below).66 Throughout the Babylonian Talmud, R. Aha b. Jacob quotes Palestinian Amoraim several times and appears once as a tradent for R. Imi, a third-generation Palestinian amora, in the Palestinian Talmud itself.67 His citation of Ben Sira is another facet of his connection and interest in Palestinian learning.68 Similarly, R. Joseph was known to cite many baraitot, including much nonlegal material, and targumim of biblical passages. Thus, he, too, seems to have had a special interest in early Palestinian texts. Additionally, in citing baraitot and targumim, R. Joseph exhibits a personal predisposition of openness to nonstandard material.69 Thus, in the early fourth century, the Book of Ben Sira entered into R. Joseph's purview from two directions simultaneously-Palestinian Jews and Mesopotamian Christians. In fact, this appears to be part of a much wider phenomenon of strong Western (i.e., Eastern provincial Roman) influence on both the Christian and Jewish communities in the Persian border provinces, including Babylonia, particu- larly in the fourth century (I will return to this point later). This phenomenon is the subject of a recent book by Richard Kalmin, who connects it to a population transfer from the eastern Roman provinces to Mesopotamia, eastern Syria, and western Persia by King Shapur I of Persia in the mid-third century.70 F. AMORAIC BABYLONIA: THE LATER PERIOD Following the period of R. Joseph and his statements about the Book of Ben Sira, the next chronological layer in the Babylonian Talmud-beginning as early as Abaye, R. Joseph's student-saw the inclusion of various statements attributed to the Book of Ben Sira in the Talmud, with the introduction "r : 11 -v ol inn ." However, R. Joseph appears to have been the only rabbi to have studied Ben Sira closely.71 Subsequently, the work was not carefully preserved and transmitted in the rabbinic community, and the Babylonian rabbinic citations are generally inaccurate. 66. The manuscripts vary as to the form of his attribution. In most, his attribution reflects a com- bination of Palestinian and Babylonian forms of attribution to Ben Sira, namely, by stating, "Thus he said in the Book of Ben Sira." See below in ?G. 67. See Ch. Albeck, Mavo' la-Talmudim (Tel Aviv: Dvir, 1987), 276-77. 68. Below in ?G, I included this citation among the Palestinian traditions because, based on what I have said here, I believe it is appropriate to assume that his citation derives from a Palestinian source (particularly because the same verse is cited by R. Eleazar, a contemporary Palestinian Amora, in two separate Palestinian sources-the Palestinian Talmud and Bereshit Rabba), and because it is helpful for the sake of comparison to see his citation beside its Palestinian parallels. 69. I call these baraitot and targumim nonstandard only because most Babylonian Amoraim do not cite them. See Albeck, Mavo la-Talmudim, 191-92. 70. Richard Kalmin, Jewish Babylonia between Persia and Roman Palestine (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006). See esp. the introductory and concluding chapters and chapter 7. I am grateful to Professor Kalmin for sharing these chapters with me prior to publication. 71. It is possible that R. Aha b. Jacob did as well, but because he only cites one verse--and at that, a verse already cited by other rabbis--it is difficult to say anything generally about his knowledge of the work as a whole. 363</page><page sequence="18">Jenny R. Labendz After Abaye, all of the Babylonian Talmud's citations of Ben Sira are anon- ymous. I consider these anonymous citations to be later than R. Joseph and Abaye, and that assumption requires some justification. Several factors contribute to my late dating of these sources, of varying degrees of strength. On the most basic level, the anonymous portions of the Babylonian Talmud are often considered among the latest chronological layers in its redactional history. Although citations of biblical books also appear anonymously and are not necessarily considered late, a major reason for this is that countless named rabbis-in addition to the anon- ymous authors or editors-also cite and discuss biblical passages. Not so with Ben Sira: R. Joseph himself even gives the impression that, up to his time, Ben Sira was not used and was not available in Babylonia. The Palestinian citations of Ben Sira and those of R. Joseph are both quite accurate, whereas the other Babylonian citations tend to be relatively inaccurate.72 Dividing these two types of citations along chronological lines makes a great deal of sense, especially on the background of the fourth-century transmission of Pales- tinian materials to Babylonia, which I discussed earlier.73 Finally, in every case in which the Babylonian Talmud cites Ben Sira, one could remove the citation and be left with no dissonance or lacunae in that section of Talmud.74 If a piece of Talmud is disposable in its immediate context, 72. At first glance, this might seem to weaken my claim about the fourth-century influence of the West on the Babylonian Jews because early Palestinian rabbis cited correctly. However, I believe I can account for this apparent discrepancy. The influence was not black and white, and once Ben Sira was introduced to rabbinic Babylonia, that community's relationship to it was affected by several factors. See below. 73. These post-fourth-century anonymous citations of Ben Sira may also go hand in hand with another set of phenomena documented by Richard Kalmin. My thanks to Professor Kalmin for pointing this out to me. Kalmin describes other cases of nonstandard literature making its way into the Babylonian Talmud, and in all three of his examples, it is exactly in the fourth century and after that the Babylonian rabbis become open to that process. The first example is dream manuals; in one story in the Babylonian Talmud, a dream manual is portrayed literally accidentally being discovered by a later fourth-century Babylonian rabbi (Rava, a student of R. Joseph). A second example is medical manuals. For these two examples, see Kalmin, Sages, Stories, Authors, and Editors in Rabbinic Babylonia (Atlanta, GA: Scholars Press, 1994), 61-80. Another important example is that in the fourth century, Josephan materials reached Babylonia and resulted in a clear change in the way later Babylo- nian rabbis portrayed the Sadducees of the Second Temple period. See Kalmin, "Between Rome and Mesopotamia: Sadducees in Sassanian Persia?" in Judaism in its Hellenistic Context, ed. Carol Bakhos (Leiden, UK: Brill, 2005), 205-42 (this article is redone in Kalmin, Jewish Babylonia, chapter 7). In Jewish Babylonia between Persia and Roman Palestine, Kalmin contextualizes this example within the larger phenomenon of the influence of Western literature and behavioral models onto both Christian and Jewish Mesopotamian/Babylonian communities in the fourth century. The inclusion of citations of Ben Sira in this picture is particularly interesting, as it reflects both the advent of a literary text and the adoption of a Western behavioral model-namely, the very acceptance of a certain brand of extrarabbinic literature in general. 74. At B. Nidah 16b, the citation is part of a slightly more extended anonymous discussion, and this point applies to the entire anonymous segment. At B. Bava Batra 98b, the citation comes at the end of a brief anonymous passage, and the citation at B. Ketubot 110b is also embedded within a brief, anonymous, independent pericope; thus, these entire pieces may be considered late. A different example is B. Yevamot 63b, which is an anonymous repetition of R. Joseph's citation from 364</page><page sequence="19">The Book of Ben Sira in Rabbinic Literature this is a good foundation on which to question its originality or early placement in that context. The sample is admittedly quite small, and this may be coincidental. Therefore, it cannot be said with certainty that these citations are late. However, it can be said that it makes a great deal of sense to consider them late. At the very least, the citations attributed to Abaye may be considered, embedded within the pericope of R. Joseph at B. Sanhedrin 100b discussed previously, at least as late as Abaye himself. In fact, I believe there is reason to treat these as anonymous additions to Abaye's statement. I do not believe it is possible to consider Abaye's citations as contemporaneous with those of R. Joseph, as R. Joseph (Abaye's teacher) does not appear to respond to Abaye at all or to be in dialogue with him-or even to be aware of his comments- and Abaye makes no independent statements about the book (that is, he merely asks about and argues with R. Joseph's opening comment).75 Therefore, it is likely that Abaye only uttered the opening question: "What is the reason?" and the concluding answer: Because it is written in it: A thin-bearded man is a murmurer; a thick-bearded man is a braggart, he who breathed into his cup is not thirsty, he who said with what shall I eat, take the bread from him, and he who has no part in his beard, none who dwell on earth can withstand him. In this rendering, Abaye explains R. Joseph's initial prohibition against reading Ben Sira by citing a passage that does not actually appear in Ben Sira and quite transparently contains inanities.76 This could reflect one of two possibilities: B. Sanhedrin 100b. This citation follows a discussion by two Amoraim, but is independent from it, neither responding to it nor serving as a locus for further discussion. The citation stands alone. It is followed by a new amoraic statement that has nothing to do with the citation. Therefore it may be con- sidered an element of this larger context that was added to that context or discussion some time later than the named Amoraim who form its core and who lived at approximately the same time as or slightly later than R. Joseph. 75. It is possible even that the citations attributed to Abaye at B. Sanhedrin I 00b are not actually Abaye's; rather, it is possible that a later editor created an artificial dialogue by invoking Abaye-R. Joseph's principal interlocutor-so as not to present a pericope in which a lone rabbinic voice has some- thing to say about Ben Sira. The long set of citations and comments that follow the introduction, "Abaye said to him [i.e., to R. Joseph], What is the reason?" may very well have originated with the same anonymous authors who included the other citations of Ben Sira in the Babylonian Talmud, and they should be grouped with them and considered a later chronological layer in the Talmud's com- position. It is unusual for an anonymous editor to actually invent an interlocutor rather than simply add to or edit an extant statement's contents, which is why I suggest this point with some hesitation. But it is not unheard of, and in this case, I find it particularly plausible. Even if the attribution to Abaye is genuine-as he is a younger scholar, and in fact a student of R. Joseph-he still may be considered part of the transition that I argue R. Joseph reflects. In fact, his detachment from R. Joseph's actual comments may serve as proof that he made these comments some time after R. Joseph's statement had already had an impact on the community. See below. 76. For a brief discussion of the classical medieval Jewish commentators on the fault of Ben Sira being its inanities, see Steinberger, "Sefer Ben Sira ve-'isur ha-kri'ah bo'," 430-41. 365</page><page sequence="20">Jenny R. Labendz Either Abaye made up a citation to reflect the inanities that he knew or believed Ben Sira to contain, or he believed this passage-based on oral tradition-actually originated in Ben Sira.7 Because of the extreme silliness of the passage, I prefer the first explanation, but there is no way to be certain. Whichever the case, this conclusion of either Abaye or the anonymous Talmud may reflect a new stage following R. Joseph's expression of his tolerant policy (thus, an intermediate stage between R. Joseph and the later stage, which generally accepts that policy), or it may reflect merely one dissenting opinion from R. Joseph's policy regarding the incorporation of Ben Sira traditions into the rabbinic tradition in Babylonia. The other citations attributed to Abaye, preceding this final conclusion that it contains inanities, vary in their accuracy in comparison to the extant Ben Sira texts. Each is cited as a possible reason for the prohibition against reading Ben Sira but is followed by a rabbinic or biblical statement that expresses the same idea, rendering Ben Sira perfectly acceptable on rabbinic grounds. I believe that the inaccuracy of these citations and their presence in this passage reflect two things. First, they reflect a perception, already expressed by R. Joseph, that Ben Sira was at one time (and maybe still was at R. Joseph's time) considered controversial, accompanied by an attempt to prove that it is not. Second, along with the rest of the citations of Ben Sira elsewhere in the Babylonian Talmud, they reflect the knowledge of an orally transmitted Book of Ben Sira, along with other wisdom traditions that were conflated with that work and mistakenly attributed to it. That sort of conflation often occurs with wisdom traditions. Additionally, some of these citations do not correspond to the extant texts at all: Some of them conflate disparate passages and change the wording, and some pieces actually do correspond to the extant texts. This is all reasonable to expect of a book that was (1) learned only orally, (2) not learned rigorously or as a standard part of the curriculum, and (3) introduced as a complete work at a relatively late date despite being known as a source of wisdom aphorisms before then. I will now sum up what I have said so far about Ben Sira citations in the Babylonian Talmud and add some further points. Before the time of R. Joseph, there is no evidence of Ben Sira in Babylonia. R. Joseph demonstrates familiarity with the book by the accuracy of his citations (see Section G and the appendix). He takes up the problem of its status, determining that it is unequivocally not a biblical book (biblical books being characterized by their written nature) but an extrabi- blical work to be learned by recitation and available for selective rabbinic use. There may have been some voices of dissent toward this stance, reflected by a statement attributed to Abaye. Subsequently, the contents of Ben Sira were spread within the rabbinic com- munity. They were preserved and remembered with varying degrees of accuracy, and sometimes they were conflated with other wisdom sources. The title of the 77. This despite not being able to cite exactly. Perhaps his negative attitude or perception of Ben Sira is based on the knowledge that Christians value the work. 366</page><page sequence="21">The Book of Ben Sira in Rabbinic Literature work was attached to a variety of wisdom traditions, only some of which were actually in Ben Sira. It was known to have been a written book and is therefore cited as such ("It is written in the Book of Ben Sira"), but these citations were made from memory based on the oral transmission of its contents. An interesting parallel to the (in)accuracy of citations of Ben Sira in the Babylonian Talmud can be found in Aphrahat's use of the same book. Owens has shown that Aphrahat quoted the Syriac Ben Sira from memory, just as he quoted Genesis and Exodus.78 The certainty that he also knew a written Book of Ben Sira is established by lexical and syntactic choices that can only be explained as deriving from a written Syriac Ben Sira that was very close to the extant Peshitta, which Aphrahat knew.79 Aphrahat's quotations from memory match the characteristics of the Babylonian Talmud's citations of Ben Sira: He conflates various verses, some- times carefully (meaning that he quotes the pieces of the given verses precisely)80 and sometimes casually;81 he subtly changes the wording82 or adjusts verbs to fit his own style;83 he sometimes diverges quite strikingly from the wording;84 and still other times, he quotes exactly a whole verse or phrase.85 Abaye's quotations and the anonymous quotations of Ben Sira in the Babylonian Talmud are similar to Aphrahat's quotation from memory. However, there is no indication that those who cite Ben Sira in the Talmud actually had a physical book from which they were quoting. In fact, R. Joseph reports that the book was purposely taken out of circulation. The major similarity between the Talmud's citations and Aphrahat's citations, at least according to Owens's evaluation, is quotation from memory.86 Furthermore, the Syriac translation, which derives from the early third to the early fourth century and based on the Hebrew and Greek versions, exhibits qualities similar to the Babylonian rabbis' citations of Ben Sira. Segal compares the Syriac translation and the Talmudic citations as follows: Ben Sira's proverbs were used for homiletical purposes by Jewish teachers in the talmudic period, just as they had been used for such purposes by early Christian teachers like Clement of Alexandria and Cyprian. And it is to be expected that in quoting orally a verse from a book, the text of which had 78. Owens, "The Early Syriac Text of Ben Sira," 50.

Labendz not been sanctified by tradition, the teacher would occasionally simplify the ancient diction of the verse in order to make it more easily intelligible to his hearers. Thus, we may suppose, some verses of our book received orally a new and more popular form, and this new form eventually found its way into the written text of the book, replacing the older form. Accordingly we reach the conclusion that Syr. is based upon a Hebrew text which embo- died popular paraphrases of certain verses originally current orally in Jewish circles of the talmudic period.87 Thus, a parallel process occurred; wisdom sayings that originally derived from Ben Sira circulated in the first few centuries CE, probably without actual attribu- tion to Ben Sira, but perhaps even known as paraphrases of that ancient work. At a certain point, these sayings became attributed to-or included in-the actual book of Ben Sira. That transition was brought about by the production of an actual edition by the Syriac translator, as well as a new awareness and possibly oral study of the Book of Ben Sira in the rabbinic community. Finally, as I discussed previously, the Palestinian sources consistently cite Ben Sira as a person (a rabbi) rather than as an author, introducing citations with "Ben Sira said ..." The Babylonian Talmud, on the other hand, consistently uses the introduction "It is written in the Book of Ben Sira," even when the passage being quoted actually originated in the Palestinian sources in which it was introduced: "Ben Sira said ..." What is the reason for this? To account for this phenomenon, it is important to establish which introduc- tion is more natural and which is a purposeful change. I believe that because Ben Sira is mentioned as a book ("the Book of Ben Sira") in the Tosefta and again in the Palestinian Talmud (Y. Sanhedrin 10:1 [28a]), and because Ben Sira was not known as a personal character who ever interacted with anyone else, that the most natural way to refer to his citations is the Babylonian form: "It is written in the Book of Ben Sira." When Palestinian rabbis turned him into a character-a pseudo-rabbi-they were doing so polemically. The point was to safeguard their citations by never granting legitimacy to a book in circulation to which the Christians afforded a high status. Thus, although the Palestinian rabbis never addressed the problem directly, they solved it in subtle ways. The Babylonian rabbis, on the other hand, had one pioneer who discussed the status of Ben Sira as a book directly: R. Joseph. Once he set out a model for how to use Ben Sira, ensuring its noncanonical status by ruling that it must be recited rather than read, there was no need to compensate with artificial rabbi- nization of Ben Sira himself. The book could be cited un-self-consciously because all knew that it was to be recited and not read (thus not being considered canonical) and to be used carefully and with the approval of R. Joseph.88 87. Segal, "The Evolution of the Hebrew Text of Ben Sira," 123. This conclusion is preceded by pages (110ff) of detailed examples of the characteristics of the Syriac translation. 88. Perhaps the greater self-consciousness exhibited by Palestinian rabbis in their use of Ben Sira had to do with the growing threat that Christianity posed to Jews in Palestine. 368</page><page sequence="23">The Book of Ben Sira in Rabbinic Literature G. THE CITATIONS89 I will now present evidence regarding the relative accuracy of the Ben Sira citations in the Palestinian and Babylonian sources. There are five Palestinian traditions that cite Ben Sira.90 Counting all parallel sources and passages that originate in one source but are repeated in another, these five traditions appear in nine Palestinian sources and two Babylonian sources. Wher- ever possible, I have provided a comparison to the extant Hebrew version(s) of Ben Sira, as the rabbis most likely knew a Hebrew version.91 In the few places where no Hebrew has survived, I have cited the Greek.

The Babylonian Talmud incorporates many such traditions, and it is often possible to distinguish between Babylonian and authentic Palestinian material in the Babylonian Talmud.

Source (2) is from the second half of Ben Sira 11:1. It is unique in that the first half of the rabbinic citation is from the first half of Proverbs 4:8, but the second half is from the Ben Sira verse. In the five rabbinic versions of this tradition (four from Palestine and one from the Babylonian version of that Palestinian tradition), the cita- tion is easily identifiable in comparison to Ben Sira MS A. The two differences are that the rabbinic citation changes the Ben Sira verse from third person to second person in order to match it to the Proverbs quotation that precedes it, and the word "'tr"r'," (princes, munificent ones) is replaced with "nn'nr" (rulers, princes), which is both orthographically and semantically similar.'03 The opening part of the verse in Proverbs is similar in content to the uncited opening of the Ben Sira verse--both mention that wisdom raises one up. In the Babylonian Talmud, the citation is corrected to distinguish between the Proverbs text and the Ben Sira text, but it is possible that the version of Ben Sira that the Palestinian rabbis quote actually contained this quotation from Proverbs. Still, even if it did not, the second part is easily recognizable as Ben Sira, and in the context of the story in which it is brought (a conversation between Simeon b. Shetah and King Yannai, the implied referent of v""rz%",), it is this second part that is relevant. Finally, this is the only case of a Palestinian source referring to an actual book of Ben Sira, and this can be explained by the fact that the rabbi is quoting it to a nonrabbi.

The identification with Ben Sira is, once again, unmistakable. This example is unique in that it jumps from the beginning of verse 4 to verse 7. The first thing to note is that this sort of skipping is not uncommon or surprising, even in rabbinic quotation of a biblical text. Furthermore, David Daube has treated this example in the context of the history of polemic about the acceptability of medicine.105 From his argument, it is clear that not only is this skipping unre- markable in general, but in fact, it reflects the social reality of its time. That is to say, by the time of Bereshit Rabba, verses 3b-6 could be omitted because the polemics contained therein are gratuitous in context.

This is a good example of Ben Sira being treated as a rabbi. He is recorded commenting on a biblical passage in standard midrashic fashion. He recites an aphorism, explains its relevance to the biblical verse, and then connects this biblical verse with the following one.

Source (5) is from Ben Sira 28:12, for which no Hebrew text is extant. Nevertheless, the identification with the Greek or Syriac text is unmistakable despite some change in form. The rabbinic citation uses the third person rather than the first, and the two actions described are preceded by an introductory phrase, "When there is a coal before him." The last clause (appearing in Greek and Syriac) is not included in the rabbinic citation, but this takes nothing away from the meaning or implication of the statement. The third clause in Ben Sira merely spells out a point that is already obvious. What the rabbinic author has in mind, if not in front of him physically, is clearly this verse. This fifth case is different from the other citations in that its form is extremely different from the Ben Sira verse on which it is based. This apparent counterexample, however, need not threaten the whole picture, for several reasons. This example is unique because it appears only in Vayikra Rabba, which contains no other citations of Ben Sira, and therefore the deviation here might reflect the prerogative of the editors of that work specifically. Further, Vayikra Rabba is a homiletical midrash and much more removed from the Palestinian Talmud's style and content than is Bereshit Rabba. Moreover, the form of the statement may have been changed to form a unit with the two rabbinic statements that immediately follow it: 106. Segal, Ben Sira, 88. 107.

In this example, therefore, there is good formal, contextual reason for the editor of this text to have changed the language of the Ben Sira citation. When such a change occurs in the Babylonian Talmud, however, no good reason presents itself. These five examples contrast strikingly with the four Babylonian passages that cite Ben Sira by name. (The fourth passage is very lengthy and contains numerous individual citations; therefore, it will be treated separately in the appendix to this article). In fact, as noted previously, these four Babylonian pas- sages include quotations that are not found in any extant copy of Ben Sira,108 as well as citations that significantly depart from our extant text, though there are also a number of close parallels. (1) In B. Ketubot 110b (and repeated exactly in B. Baba Batra 146a and B. Sanhedrin 100b), Proverbs 15:15 is cited and a gloss by Ben Sira himself is then reported, followed by another aphorism, none of which is to be found in any extant text of Ben Sira: All the days of the poor are bad; Ben Sira says: Even the nights. Among the lowest of roofs is his roof and among the highest of mountains his vineyard, such that the rain of[other] roofs [pours] onto his roof and the earth of his vineyard [goes] to [other] vineyards. (2) Similarly, an anonymous passage in B. Baba Batra 98b attributes a saying to Ben Sira that is nowhere to be found in extant texts but is actually quite similar to a passage from Ahiqar (see above).

The phrase "s17.' n'ot "n 1 7 n'r " appears both in the verse cited from Proverbs and in Ben Sira 11:8, MSS A and B. Its presence in Ben Sira may have motivated the attribution of the whole unit to that author, although this passage clearly draws from some other source of wisdom aphorisms. (3) B. Nidah 16b cites the Book of Ben Sira saying,110 Three things I have hated, andfour I have not loved.: a minister who frequents the bar-houses-and some say, a minister who grumbles, and one who sets up a seat in the highest [part] of a city, and one who holds his member and urinates, and the one who enters a house suddenly. Following this citation (presented by the anonymous Talmud), the early Palestinian Amora R. Yohanan (second generation) is presented as commenting on the last element in this list, adding "even his own house." R. Yohanan's comment, however, does not depend on this citation of Ben Sira qua Ben Sira; his comment may have originated in connection with a similar tradition deriving from elsewhere (or simply not attributed to Ben Sira). Immediately following this passage, an apparently tannaitic citation is presented that is very similar to this alleged quote from Ben Sira, and R. Yohanan's comment is embedded anonymously within it."' The text reads, ."M ?n ?:E) Int=a =.W,11;n W-'1 InU'17n"M:2nT T 1' 7;1 (17a) n,,n l5nx73z nlmwm T in n R.

That is to say, either the comment is original to the tannaitic source and is only ascribed to R. Yohanan by the anonymous Talmud in the context of its related (mis)quote of Ben Sira, or R. Yohanan originally commented on that tannaitic source, and his comment later became embedded within the tannaitic source itself. 112. Thus, MSS Vat. 113, Vat. 111, Munich 95, and the ed. princ. R. Simon is a Tanna. MS 127 reads "Resh Lakish"-R. Simon ben Lakish, a contemporary of R. Yohanan, a second-generation Palestinian Amora. This is a likely error to have been made, given the fact that Resh Lakish's name also begins with "Simon" and the larger pericope includes him. The Vilna edition reads "R. Simon b. Yohai," which is the same person as "R. Simon" in the four witnesses mentioned; "b. Yohai" is his patronymic. I believe that the sum of these witnesses indicates that this is meant to be read as a tan- naitic source, even though it lacks the standard introductory formula for a tannaitic source.

Indeed, although Ben Sira does not contain a text that looks exactly like any of these from B. Nidah, it does contain a reference to the undesirability of entering a house suddenly. Ben Sira 21:22a (for which no Hebrew is extant) reads, RnoI q.opo) Taxuq eiS oci1av The foot of a stupid man is quick into the house. Thus, the attribution to Ben Sira may derive from this correspondence. Furthermore, Ben Sira 25:2a, for which no Hebrew text has survived, may lie in the background of this citation, but the passage as a whole is quite different.

My soul hated three kinds, and I was greatly offended at their lives: an arro- gant beggar, a rich liar, an adulterous old man with too little judgment. This provides the opening theme of a list of three hateful things. But the three listed in Ben Sira are obviously not the three recalled here. The three in Ben Sira's list are, however, known to the rabbis in B. Pesahim 113b, but there they are cited as part of a tannaitic source:113 9 KrNW X 7 n1MIT ?

Where the association remains, here in B. Nidah, there are four hateful things, but they are completely different from those in Ben Sira 25:2. (4) As mentioned previously, the fourth Babylonian Talmudic passage in which Ben Sira is cited will be treated in the appendix. To summarize that passage, there are five citations that are similar to the pattern seen in the first three Babylonian passages. That is, they vary in their closeness to extant texts of Ben Sira, and on the whole, they are significantly more inaccurate than the Palestinian citations. These five citations are attributed to Abaye but may belong to an anonymous later author. Following these, R. Joseph himself cites twelve verses from Ben Sira, conforming to the Palestinian trend of citing accurately. This can be explained as a result of his particularly close study of the work in order to determine its validity or worth for the Babylonian rabbinic community. The following list is a summary of the situation regarding Ben Sira citations in the Bavli, including the citations in the fourth passage: 1. Not in Ben Sira at all 2.

CONCLUSIONS In this paper, I have shown that the rabbis' knowledge and use of Ben Sira varied depending on their period and location. The tannaitic rabbis of the period 379</page><page sequence="34">Jenny R. Labendz roughly between 70 CE and 220 CE in Palestine probably possessed a Book of Ben Sira similar to the extant versions. Although there is not enough evidence to say this with certainty, the burden of proof is on whomever claims that these rabbis lacked a book that (1) they referred to by name and (2) was extant in Palestine at that time among Christians. Based on the one tannaitic source that refers to Ben Sira explicitly, it was considered a Jewish noncanonical book. Following this period, the Palestinian Amoraim, roughly between 220 CE and 400 CE, also possessed a book of Ben Sira that was quite close to our extant versions. This is substantiated by the remarkable closeness between the five Palestinian amoraic attributed citations of Ben Sira and the extant (and especially the Hebrew) versions. The text was studied only from recitation-or at least, it was portrayed strictly as oral material-but it was known well by those who cited it. In contrast to the situation in Palestine, which saw the continuous presence of Ben Sira, the Babylonian rabbis were not exposed to the work itself before the fourth century CE. Until then, they probably knew of the work because of the tan- naitic source that mentions it or because of general familiarity with his name as an ancient wisdom sage. In the early fourth century, the Book of Ben Sira became available in Babylonia. R. Joseph knew the work well, perhaps having scrutinized it to determine what its status should be in the Jewish community. He therefore cited it accurately and ruled that it may be studied orally. Subsequently, it became known through recitation in rabbinic circles, but as it was neither canonical nor a standard part of the curriculum, the text was not pre- served accurately. This is perhaps because there was no long tradition of studying or citing the Book of Ben Sira, and its newfound Babylonian Jewish students either neglected to treat it with much care or took advantage of its obscurity. Thus, the Babylonian citations that derive from the period after R. Joseph (mid-fourth century to sixth century) include conflations, rephrasings, and even aphorisms or parts of aphorisms that are not found in Ben Sira at all. The aim of this paper has been to explain what the rabbis consciously possessed in the way of Ben Sira. The answer is relevant to the larger picture of Babylonian rabbinic activity in the fourth century, a topic that is dealt with at length by Richard Kalmin in his recent book. Kalmin shows that this period wit- nessed an influx of Western literature and behavioral models into Babylonia, and the case of Ben Sira supports his conclusions and adds yet another element to that picture. The amoraic rabbis of Palestine possessed a broad store of texts, ancient and contemporary, besides the standard tannaitic corpora, and they often freely incorporated these texts into their own scholarly activity. The rabbis of Babylonia, on the other hand, became aware of texts such as Ben Sira in the fourth century and had to learn and decide whether and how to be open to them. As I have shown, this was sometimes more complicated than might be assumed, as neither the rabbis nor the texts to which they were being introduced existed in a vacuum. Having summarized my findings, a few methodological remarks are in order. The number of statements attributed to Ben Sira in rabbinic literature is not great. Even with our geographic and chronological sensitivity, grouping 380</page><page sequence="35">The Book of Ben Sira in Rabbinic Literature all of the later Babylonian Amoraim together, for example, may still be an oversimplification. There were rabbis and rabbinic authors who cited Ben Sira, and they fit into a coherent picture based on broad chronological and geographic groupings. But we should be careful not to impose our understanding of the knowledge of a handful of rabbis onto all other rabbis who lived alongside them. Just as R. Joseph stood out alone in his generation, with at most only one other (Abaye) by his side, in dealing with the Book of Ben Sira,114 there may have been individuals or certain circles later on who were responsible for the other Ben Sira citations in the Babylonian Talmud. The other side to that coin is that a very small portion of the Book of Ben Sira is represented in the rabbinic citations. The Palestinian citations deal with eso- teric knowledge, the honor granted by wisdom, medicine, one's feelings affecting one's appearance, and fire. The Babylonian sources mention dishonorable social conduct of various types, women, people who lie in wait and hurt others, inviting people into one's house, confiding in others, worrying about the future, the life of the poor, cooking fish, daughters and fathers, worrying, and beards. No immediate pattern seems evident, and there is a great deal of variety. By the same token, many themes that are prevalent in Ben Sira are not mentioned at all. Given the nature of Talmudic sources in general and the small number of rabbinic citations preserved, I believe that these citations reflect a random variety of the passages that were familiar to the rabbis and deemed relevant to their literature. We can learn much less from the contents of the rabbinic citations of Ben Sira than we can from their forms and accuracy and from explicit statements about Ben Sira. One final question must be asked: Given all of the above, can one ever emend the text of Ben Sira based on a rabbinic citation? Because even among the Palestinian citations attributed to Ben Sira some definite rabbinization is evident in the language and form, it would be dangerous to base an emendation on these texts. On one hand, if the imprecision exists in the attributed citations, one may safely assume that at least this sort of textual tampering would occur with the unattributed citations, discussed at the start of this paper. A text that the rabbis preserved consciously is simply more likely to be preserved accurately than one that circulated anonymously and atomistically. On the other hand, in many instances there is no way to be sure that an unattributed Ben Sira citation in the rabbinic literature does not happen to preserve an original version. The main point though is that, at least in many cases, we have no way of knowing, and given the nature of rabbinic citation in general, we should be somewhat skeptical at the outset. The more useful way to use the unattributed citations of Ben Sira in the rab- binic literature is as part of the mass of wisdom and popular aphorisms in rabbinic literature (divided according to chronology and geography, as I have done with the attributed citations) and to compare them with unattributed citations of Ben Sira in other literatures--Syriac, Greek, and Persian. This sort of comparison might yield 114. I left out R. Aha b. Jacob here because he does not talk about Ben Sira but merely cites a verse. 381</page><page sequence="36">Jenny R.

Sanhedrin 100b includes numerous attributions to Ben Sira of varying degrees of closeness to the extant texts. The first five citations are adduced as examples of verses that one might think inclined the rabbis to dislike the book but ultimately correspond to biblical or rabbinic sayings. This first group of five citations is attributed to Abaye (but, as explained in the body of this article, likely derive from a later anonymous author), and the second set is said by R. Joseph. However, these two groups of citations are different from each other: Abaye's citations are similar to the other Babylonian citations of Ben Sira in their inaccuracy compared to the extant texts, whereas R. Joseph's citations are quite accurate. The following is a detailed analysis of both groups of citations. (a) The first citation is in Aramaic and appears in no extant text of Ben Sira:s15 Skin afish only from its gills, so that its skin should not be ruined, but roast it [i.e., the fish] over fire, and eat two loaves with it.116 (b) The next is from Ben Sira 42:9-10 but with significant variation. The Talmudic text reads, M,0W=1 7101n 'Im= j;T~j7T 0-1:1 7 n 1'577' N 'ar nm Nmln 0V KnV A daughter is a treasure in vain to her father; from fear about her he will not sleep at night, as a child lest she be seduced, as a young girl lest she fornicate, when she matures lest she does not marry, when she marries lest she does not have children, when she becomes old lest she engage in witchcraft. Jonas Greenfield has written about the relationship of this Talmudic para- phrase to the text of Ben Sira, concluding that "in distinction to most other identifiable Ben Sira texts in rabbinic literature, this was clearly a remade text," primarily as it reflects "a different compositional principle." The follow- ing are the Hebrew witnesses to this passage of Ben Sira, namely, MS Masada and MS B:117 115. These citations from B. Sanhedrin are from MS Yemen. On the superiority of this MS of B.

The sense of the Talmudic version is that a father suffers constant worry about his daughter. The Ben Sira text expresses the same sentiment but with an added element: A father might think he will be free of worry once his daughter marries, but he discovers that every 118. Jonas C.

The focus is on the failure of marriage to prevent the father from worry- ing. In the Talmudic version, there is no such emphasis. This version apparently reflects conscious and ideologically driven manipulation of a text that is close to the Ben Sira versions we have. The question is merely who carried out this manipulation. We cannot know for sure, but it is worth entertaining two possibilities. The first possibility has to do with the context of this citation in the Talmud. In this Talmudic passage, Abaye adduces passages from Ben Sira that would seem to be offensive but ultimately are proven to be within the scope of rabbinic thought. The rabbinic statement adduced as evidence that the sentiment of this passage is acceptable is as follows: It is impossible for the world (to exist) without males or without females, but happy is the man whose children are males, and woe to he whose offspring is female. This statement has nothing to do with marriage, and it does not mention whether the daughter's marriage will be able to ease the father's distress. Perhaps the rabbis indeed found the original text of Ben Sira offensive, as it might mitigate a father's determination to marry off his daughter. To avoid this problem, Abaye could have manipulated the text so as to shift the focus away from the inability of marriage to alleviate the emotional stress of a parent. Once the point of the text is clearly that a father always worries about his daughter, the rabbis are in familiar territory, and this passage is not offensive.123 The second possibility is simpler. This tradition may have originated in Ben Sira but circulated orally as wisdom literature. At some point in its circulation, it evolved or was reformulated into the version cited in the Talmud. Abaye identifies the text as Ben Sira and cites it as he knows it. His goal in this Talmudic passage is not to alleviate the discomfort caused by particular passages of Ben Sira but to point out that there is no reason to look askance at it (after R. Joseph said that it is not to be read) because, after all, it has much in common with rabbinic Jewish thought. He then picks out passages that are familiar to him and remind him of a rabbinic or biblical saying. (c) Continuing with the other quotations of Ben Sira in B. Sanhedrin, the third one reads, 123. I disagree with Tal Ilan, who believes that the sentiment that a daughter is basically nothing but trouble is now fully embraced in the Talmud. Ilan, "Yahaso shel Ben Sira le-nashim," 105-106. A more accurate description would be that it is not fully rejected. The speaker in this passage bases his whole point on the assumption that this is not immediately recognizable as a rabbinic sentiment fully embraced by all. 385</page><page sequence="40">Jenny R. Labendz Do not let grief enter your heart, for grief has killed strong men. This Aramaic aphorism has no direct parallel in Ben Sira, but it appears to be a conflation and translation of Ben Sira 30:21a (MS B) and 30:23c (MS B), and it is related to 14:lb (MS A) as well.124 These verses read, .lft2171 inn ' :ac2:? 30:21a.: Do not give your soul to grief 30:23c: For grief has killed many. 14.1.

The Talmudic citation repeats the same idea twice here, creating a two-part state- ment that is characteristic of wisdom aphorisms and of Ben Sira in particular.

In Greek, the word for "ton" is 6ohiov, meaning deceitful one; in Syriac, the word is znhizp, meaning deceptive person. 386</page><page sequence="41">The Book of Ben Sira in Rabbinic Literature To sum up this first group of citations, there is considerable variation among them regarding their closeness to extant texts of Ben Sira, and as a group, they are similar to the other Babylonian citations discussed in the body of this article. As noted previously, the second group of citations of B. Sanhedrin 1 00b are attributed to R. Joseph, who describes these passages as "n"r7 nxnw'tR 'nln"--"excellent statements in it," that is, in the Book of Ben Sira.

In MS Munich 141, the main manuscript for B. Yevamot according to the Historical Dictionary of the Academy of Hebrew Language, it is almost identical to the passage in B. Sanhedrin. The few differences are extremely minor. 128. The Yemenite manuscript completes this verse from Jeremiah 5:27, but this is character- istic of Eastern manuscripts and Yemenite ones in particular. Western manuscripts leave the verse as cited without filling in or correcting, and indeed, the Western witnesses to this passage do not include the end of this verse, which I have put in parentheses. On this trend in manuscripts, see Rosenthal, "'Al derekh tipulam shel hazal," 402-403. 387</page><page sequence="42">Jenny R. Labendz x.

Do not grieve the griefoftomorrow, for you will not know what a day will bring forth, lest tomorrow come and he is no more, and he is found grieving over a world that is not his. Essentially, R. Joseph presents a number of verses or phrases from Ben Sira on the topic of women and wives. First, there is a group of three citations from Chapter 26 of Ben Sira, plus some additional material; then there is a group of three (or four) citations from Chapter 9 and then three citations from Chapter 11, followed by a citation from Chapter 6 and then an aphorism not found in Ben Sira. On the whole, this section stands out among citations of Ben Sira in the Bavli as a text that is remarkably close-at least in terms of its individual pieces-to the text in the extant versions of Ben Sira. The main difference is the grouping and rearranging (see above-this is common in midrash and in piyyut). Therefore, I find that this group of citations fits the mold of Palestinian rabbinic knowledge of the Book of Ben Sira more than that of the Babylonian rabbis. Even if one sees the Palestinian citations as much closer than R. Joseph's citations, this group of citations (especially when taken together) is much closer to Ben Sira than the group (especially when considered as a group) that precedes it and at least the first two of the foregoing Babylonian citations. (i) The first line in this Talmudic citation is almost exactly the same as Ben Sira 26:3 MS C: A [g]ood woman is a [good] portion and in the portion of a God-fearer she shall be give[n]. The difference is merely that the rabbinic citation uses "mninn" (gift) rather than "ar" (portion), which is both phonetically and syntactically very similar, and "pn" (bosom) as opposed to "pin," another word for portion that, again, is phonetically and syntactically similar. (ii) Line 2 does not appear as such in Ben Sira but it is similar in theme to the lines preceding Ben Sira 26:1, 3 (lines 1 and 4 in B. Sanhedrin). Those lines in Ben Sira (25:22, MS C) read: Weakness of hands [and f]ailure of knees is a woman who does not make her husband happy 388</page><page sequence="43">The Book of Ben Sira in Rabbinic Literature In the Greek and Syriac, the preceding line'29 describes the evil woman as a tortured heart, a dark face, and a wound to the heart. The Syriac (26:7) additionally describes a woman as a "hard yoke." The difference in the Talmudic text is not only the general difference in phrasing the idea but also the introduction of the more technical description, nvr17, which would have been familiar both from Leviticus and from the rabbis' extensive literature on the subject. Therefore, it may also reflect a rabbinization of the Ben Sira tradition. (iii) Line 3, in typical Talmudic fashion, interrupts with a rhetorical question and then answers it. None of this line is found in the Hebrew Ben Sira. However, it is found in the Syriac and is hinted at in the Greek. In fact, although the Hebrew is extant for this section, there are a few verses here in Greek and Syriac that are not included in the Hebrew. Following those verses (which include water imagery that is completely absent in the Hebrew), the Greek reads (25:26), eti ti 7CopEU6TE t Ka~rT Xetpdq cou, no)y7, O cWv apKV . GODcK u OT agOTIV If she does not go according to your hands, cut her offfrom your flesh. More explicitly, the Syriac (which contains some textual difficulty) reads (25:26), "n'Ml 1n ,-;,, n1 n 1 1;n ISIv I-=l "lInKn -,n-K nX NlI If she does not come after you, your flesh-cut, give her,; and release her from your house. Still, in the Talmud, this is clearly an editorial comment, unlikely original to R. Joseph.130 (iv) Line 4 is exactly the same as Ben Sira 26:1 (MS C), except for the minor addition of the word "n?" in Sanhedrin, specifying the place or physical source of the husband's happiness, and the substitution in the rabbinic citation (as in the Syriac) of the word "n!," for "nit." (v) The first half of line 5 is almost exactly as in Ben Sira 9:8a (MS A), l'7 b nn," "ln nnw but the second half quotes (exactly) the second half of 9:3 (MS A), the full text of which reads, 129. The verse numbering varies in the different versions, so in the Greek and Syriac, the verse to which I am referring is 23. 130. The switch to Aramaic is a clear indication of this. See Shamma Friedman, "Perek ha- 'ishah rabah ba-bavli be-zeruf mavo kelali al derekh heker ha-sugya," in Mehkarim u-mekorot: ma 'asaf le-mada 'ei ha-yahadut, ed. H. Z. Dimitrovsky (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1977), 1:301-302. 389</page><page sequence="44">Jenny R. Labendz Do not approach a strange woman, lest you fall into her traps. (vi) Line 6 deviates slightly from the precise language of Ben Sira 9:9 (MS A), but it is still very close to that verse, which reads, With her husband do not taste, and do not sit with him [over] liquor 131 (vii) Line 7 is a partial parallel to Ben Sira 9:8b (MS A), particularly in the use of one phrase, but it is not as close a parallel as the others in this section. The verse from Ben Sira reads, For the sake of a woman many were destroyed, and similarly her lovers will be burnt in fire. (viii) Lines 8-10 are based on pieces of Ben Sira 11:27-30. The Syriac trans- lation, along the same lines, changes the order of the pieces of these verses and includes conflations and changes, alongside exact translations. The Greek differs from the Hebrew and Syriac in lexical choices as well. In other words, this specific section of Ben Sira is a particularly unstable text. The first part of line 8 in the rabbinic citation is from Ben Sira 11:29b (MS A), whose other part was quoted previously and is also quoted as line x. Ben Sira 11:27b reads, And how many are the w[ounds] of a peddler'132 Here it is out of place, but the word "1~/o' 1"''33 follows nicely after "Innt n mnn" in line 7 and leads into line 9 smoothly. 131. See Segal, "The Evolution of the Hebrew Text of Ben Sira," 107-108. Segal's reconstruc- tion of the original Hebrew for this line (though it is based in part on this very Talmudic passage but also on the Greek, Syriac, and Hebrew MS A) renders it even closer to the Talmudic citation, 132. Segal considers this Hebrew a corruption of the Greek and Syriac; in any event, the Talmudic citation matches the Hebrew (Segal, "The Evolution of the Hebrew Text of Ben Sira," 117). See n. 126 regarding "'oni." 133. The Syriac and Greek read "Dn." 390</page><page sequence="45">The Book of Ben Sira in Rabbinic Literature The second part of line 8 jumps from Ben Sira 11:27b to 11:28h, a jump that is perhaps facilitated by the appearance of the word "rnn" in 11:28g-h MS A: The peddler lies in wait like a bear at the house of scoffers, and like a spy will see sexual inappropriateness. As Segal explains, the meaning of this in 11:28h (the second part of the line just cited) is that the evil person spies on families to catch them misbehaving, as in Genesis 42:9.134 However, in the Talmudic citation, which is apparently influenced by Mishnah Avot 3:13,135 the word "arn" is taken to mean not "spy"136 but "frequenter," forcing the rest of the phrase to change slightly because what follows needs to be a noun (that which the person frequents) rather than a verb (that which the spy does). Hence, "nlI7 -* n?'~r~ani," along with the "r1n" are those who inflict many injuries. In any event, the Talmudic citation's dependence on this verse-or one extremely similar to it-is clear. The final part of line 9 is from Ben Sira 11:30 MS A: From a spark he will increase [the burning of] an ember, and a wicked person will lie in wait for blood. Again, the citation jumps over a few lines, but in that very verse, the word "nx" appears, as in 11:28g above. The Talmudic citation makes more sense than the phrasing of Ben Sira MS A, as the verb "`ln" is more appropriate to the "n~n" than is "nn'." The exact phrasing of Ben Sira 11:30a varies in the Greek and Syriac: The Greek maintains the verb "increase" (rnkOrI pvem-t) but the subject is the spark, as in the Talmudic citation, whereas in the Syriac, the verb is "kindles" (TP7'), as in the Talmudic citation.137 (ix) Line 9 is an exact quote from Jeremiah 5:17, which also appears in Ben Sira 11:27c (MS A). 134. Segal, Ben Sira, 112. Joseph accuses his brothers of being spies looking for badness in the land: nrn - nn nni nix f ns omxn n ~ n s 'i 1 (Genesis 42:9). 135. MS Kaufmann (3:17) reads, nmri7b nt nX r ,m . (The words "mIanr ns" appear in the margin, probably because of the a homoioteleuton from the n of "nDa'n" to the D of "DT1r," especially as the word "nna'" begins a new line, and the scribe probably consulted his original and corrected the mistake in the margin.) In the Mishnah, " , 'a'" is a verb, not a noun, as in the Talmudic citation under discussion; the influence on the Ben Sira citation is to the result of the juxta- position of "an'tz" and "mon," not a meaningful borrowing from this Mishnah. 136. Or as in the Syriac, sipnr, "one who lies in wait." 137. See Segal, Ben Sira, 112. 391</page><page sequence="46">Jenny R. Labendz (x) Line 10, as noted, also appears above. Its second part parallels 11:27a, and its first part is a rephrasing and doubling of that line.'38 (xi) Finally, line 11 is parallel, though not perfectly identical in wording, to Ben Sira 6:5 (MS A), which reads, The people ofyour well-being will be many, but the holder ofyour secret, one in a thousand. (xii) As noted above, line 12 is not found in Ben Sira. To sum up this group of citations, they are very close indeed to extant ver- sions of Ben Sira and thus conform to the pattern of Palestinian rather than later Babylonian rabbinic citations. This adds further support to the argument that R. Joseph's relationship to Ben Sira was unique among Babylonian rabbis. 138. On this phenomenon as characteristic of the Syriac translation as well, see Segal, "The Evolution of the Hebrew Text of Ben Sira," 118-23. 392</page></plain_text>
