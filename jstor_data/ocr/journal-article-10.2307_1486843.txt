<plain_text><page sequence="1">James William Hagy. This Happy Land: The Jews of Colonial and Antebellum Charleston. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1993. xi, 450 pp. "I admire the spirit of the Charlestonians," declaims a character in Old Toney and His Master, one of the wagonload of proslavery novels published in the South just before the outbreak of the Civil War. "I regard them as the noblest race of merchants on earth. Even their Jews seem to deal fairly, and to lose their particular characteristics in the mercantile atmosphere of Charleston." This dubious compliment to Charleston's Jews illustrates the central theme (it is not quite an argument) of James William Hagy's This Happy Land, namely, the significant assimilation of Jews into the life of a city pivotal to the histories both of the South and of American Jewry. In Charleston, according to Hagy, Jews lost enough of their "particular characteristics" to live peaceably among Christian neighbors, serve the larger community in positions of influence, participate fully in the economic life of the city (including slaveholding and the buying and selling of slaves), and, in the years leading up to the Civil War, share with other Charlestonians the politics of Southern defiance. Did contemporaries acknowledge this assimilation into the "mercantile atmosphere of Charleston" in terms laced with antisemitism? Hagy offers little to qualify the Charleston Jews' own repeated assertions that they lived in a "happy land" of tolerance and freedom. Hagy would have been more successful in maintaining this theme had he set out to probe the extent and limits of Jewish assimilation, and had he linked his findings to the history of Reform Judaism that constitutes the</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 441 most interesting portions of his book. Unfortunately, he conceived of his task, as others had before him, in the comprehensive terms of the chronicler rather than in the analytic terms of the historian. As a chronicler, Hagy wants to leave nothing out-seemingly, every document pertaining to every Jew, Jewish institution, or event involving Jews is reported on, and much of the reportage is itself relatively undigested. The very first pages of his text become bogged down in the search for the names and origins of Charleston's first Jews, and following the final pages is a 135-page doubled-columned list of the names and vital data of every Jew the author could find living in Charleston before 1861. In between is a series of topically arranged chapters (for some reason, the text too is printed in double columns), each chronicling one or another dimension of Jewish life in Charleston. Interspersed with the text are three dozen tables, but nearly all of these turn out to be undigested as well, being no more than lists of names of Jews who worked in one or another occupation, or who owned slaves, or who joined the Refonned Society, or who advertised in local newspapers. I am not one to disparage thoroughness, and I do admire the remarkable comprehensiveness of Hagy's research. I would acknowledge, as well, the usefulness of his discussion of the Reform movement, which improves upon earlier accounts. But if in this and in other respects Hagy exceeds prior books, such as Barnett Elzas's The Jews of South Carolina fronm the Earliest Times to the Present (1905), and Charles Reznikoff and Uriah Z. Engelman's The Jews of Charleston (1950), he does so without departing from their antiquarian format. Hagy has lengthened, but has not transcended, the compendium of facts pertaining to Charleston Jewry. Stuart M. Blumin Cornell University Ithaca, N.Y.</page></plain_text>
