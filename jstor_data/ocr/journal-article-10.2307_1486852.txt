<plain_text><page sequence="1">Alex Grobman. Rekindling the Flame: American Chaplains and the Survivors of European Jewry, 1944-1948. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1993. xii, 259 pp. This is an account of a handful of men who made a difference during a critical, chaotic, desperate moment of Jewish history. Prepared to minister to soldiers, not survivors, the Jewish chaplains in the American army in Europe during the Second World War were, in fact, forbidden at first by military regulations from working with survivors while on duty. Most of them found ways, however, to meet the needs of the hour. At the least, they showed the survivors that "American Jewry cared" (p. 197). At the most, they contributed significantly to the rehabilitation of the saving remnant. In this short volume, Alex Grobman, the former director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles and the St. Louis Center for Holocaust Studies, makes a number of important points. Most unusual, perhaps, is the extraordinary extent to which chaplains were willing to contravene orders and risk their careers to assist survivors. They obtained food, clothing, and other supplies in enormous quantities by soliciting donations from soldiers and from the folks back home. Less expectedly, they procured army supplies, sometimes using creative measures, such as requisitioning the food of Jewish soldiers</page><page sequence="2">468 BOOK REVIEWS who were fasting on Yom Kippur, and sometimes resorting to theft. Often they were assisted by non-Jewish officers and enlisted men and by Christian chaplains. Later, when the Bricha was positioning the survivors for illegal immigration to Palestine, chaplains helped to secure arms and to smuggle Jews and arms, activities which might have gotten them court-martialed. A point Grobman does not make is that American Jews have often been accused of callousness toward Hitler's victims, of caring more for their own security and reputations than for the lives of their brethren. Either these men and the soldiers and civilians who answered their call were exceptional or the negative evaluation must be rethought. Noteworthy is the chaplains' difficulty, at least initially, in ensuring that survivors would be dealt with appropriately by the military. For a number of reasons, including thoughtlessness, convenience, lack of personnel, British determination to keep Jews out of Palestine, and the inability to realize that repatriation was inappropriate for Jews, survivors were kept in camps with hostile Eastern European DPs, restricted in their movements, sometimes guarded by their former German persecutors, and in many places forced to live in unspeakable conditions. As time went on, they were increasingly viewed as a nuisance by the army. Appeals to commanding officers availed little at first, as did pressure on Washington by prominent Jews. In the summer of 1945 the situation was investigated by Earl G. Harrison, the former Commisioner of Immigration, who had represented the United States on the Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees. Harrison was guided by Rabbi Abraham Klausner, the outstanding hero of the chaplain- survivor encounter. As a result of Harrison's revelations, General Dwight D. Eisenhower issued orders to ameliorate the survivors' suffering. Obtuseness regarding the special needs of people who had been marked for murder was not easily overcome, however, nor was antisemitism. The seeds of Holocaust denial were already present. Grobman notes that "American soldiers knew so little about the Nazi treatment of Jews that when they were taken to Dachau [in 1945], a majority of them were positive that it had been staged for propaganda purposes" (p. 85). Grobman manifests considerable impatience with the generally well- meaning military and political establishments and with American Jewry's leaders, who, he feels, reacted too slowly to the survivors' plight. He implies criticism of soldiers and civilian officials who failed to plan adequately for the task of governing after victory, and of the Joint Distribution Committee (Joint),</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 469 American Jewry's foremost institution for assisting Jews abroad, which did not foresee the scope of postwar problems. But long-range planning has never been an American strength; armies are created to fight, not to govern; and the implications of the Holocaust, an unprecedented event in human history, were not generally foreseen. Considering reactions to events in Yugoslavia today, one might marvel at the speed and sensitivity of American and Jewish responses to the survivors' needs. Grobman's views should be compared to the more sympathetic discussion by his mentor, Yehuda Bauer, in the latter's three-volume history of the Joint during World War II. Whatever one's estimation of the American forces or of Jewish groups, Grobman is surely right about the chaplains. They quickly and accurately evaluated the spiritual and material needs of the survivors. Since no one else could or would deal with those needs, they undertook the task without guidance, preparation, means, or back-up. Grobman relates their manifold activities effectively. There are some difficulties with this volume which must be noted. One is the lack of a clear chronology, which leads to repetition and confusion. Another is the author's failure to breathe life into his characters. Most are identified only by age and religious movement ("a twenty-six-year-old Conservative rabbi"). Yet nowhere does Grobman suggest that age was a factor in their performance; and he explicitly states that "No sect [sic] was more responsive" to survivors' needs than any other (p. 197). Information that might contribute to a fuller understanding of the chaplains, the communities from which they came, their family situations, their length of service, or their postwar positions, is generally not given. The most serious shortcoming of the book is its narrow focus. The author claims that his study is an attempt "to analyze the impact the European Jewish survivors" exerted "on American Jewry" through the chaplains (p. 195). He does this well for the few years about which he writes, although his anecdotal evidence suggests greater influence on policy and individuals than he concedes. Grobman makes no attempt, however, to measure long-term impact, which would have necessitated going beyond the period to which he devotes his attention. He baldly asserts that "aside from discussing their activities with congregants and friends after returning from Europe, most chaplains no longer spoke about these experiences" (p. 197). This is curious, indeed. Grobman writes convincingly of the depth and sincerity of the rabbis' concern and of their self-sacrificing willingness to act. Such strong sentiments</page><page sequence="4">470 BOOK REVIEWS do not jibe with returning to America and forgetting about the survivors. If that happened, what is the explanation? And what does it tell us about the relationship of American Jewry to the Holocaust? As it stands, this well-researched book illuminates an important aspect of Holocaust history: the survivors in Europe just after the war. The spotlight, however, shines on a relatively minor detail: the chaplains. It is to be hoped that Grobman will continue his study and consider some of the larger questions he himself implicitly raises, and which he is obviously qualified to address.
