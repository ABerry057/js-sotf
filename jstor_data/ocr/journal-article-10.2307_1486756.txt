<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUCCESSION TO THE RABBINATE IN YEMEN by AHARON GAIMANI Introduction Rabbinical appointments in modem times have been the subject of some study: in Ashkenaz it was customary for a son to inherit the office of rabbi from his father, provided he was deserving.' Simha Assaf writes: "We do not find [in earlier periods] the practice which is widespread today, whereby a community, upon the death of its rabbi, appoints his son or son-in-law even if they are unworthy replacements. Previously, communities were not subject to this 'dynastic imposition."'2 Under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, in the seventeenth century, there are attestations of the rabbinical office becoming a dynasty reserved for certain families, notably Taytasaq, Sarfati and 'Arameh, in Saloniki. Although the rabbinate was not perceived as the rightful monopoly of any particular family, interviews conducted with rabbis and community leaders on this point indicate that certain families had clearly been preferred over others. From the seventeenth century onwards this grew more pronounced: occasionally, the community would refrain from appointing a new rabbi and wait for a younger son to reach maturity so he could inherit his father's position.3 1.

Problems arose when the son was not a suitable replacement, and another member of the family-a son-in-law or grandchild who was a scholar in his own right-demanded the appointment.4 The rabbinate in Yemen was a world unto itself. The responsa and other rabbinical documents reveal that the rabbis did not address the debate surrounding rabbinical appointments. I propose to examine the controversies in light of the unique status of the rabbinical office and the structure of the Jewish community. This will be illustrated by a discussion of the office of chief rabbi in San'a and other communities in recent centuries, making use also of interviews conducted with the last generation of officiating rabbis in Yemen; the conclusions will shed light on the practice in Yemen in earlier periods as well. The Rabbi: Life and Leadership, Torah and Labor The office of head of the community in Yemen bears the stamp of ancient tradition, as articulated by Maimonides.5 In Yemen, the rabbi, and indeed anyone serving in any spiritual capacity in the community, was known by the title of mori, a word appearing in ancient sources preserved in the Yemenite tradition.6 The title referred to the teachers of young boys and anyone qualified 4.

In most Yemenite communities, however, it was the mori who fulfilled both spiritual and political offices.8 Visitors to Yemen noted the unique nature of the Yemenite rabbi as community leader. R. Ya'aqov Sapir, the rabbinical emissary who visited Yemen in 1859, tells of the mori in different communities. The following is his description of Mori Yosef ben Sa'id of Jirwah: This tiny city has a great rabbi (in these places the rabbi is called mori): he is teacher, judge and preacher, slaughterer and cantor and beadle as well; still, even with all these, he hasn't enough to eke out a living.... thus is the mori burdened with the need to earn a living by his own trade.9 He noted that the moris exhibited mastery of Talmud and halakhic works as great as that of Jewish scholars in other countries, and, as well, were thoroughly conversant with the Qabbalah; the mori was also a charismatic leader. At the same time, he worked as a smith, mended the peasants' tools, and would combine study with work and communal affairs: "Even when engaged in this difficult labor I would find him discussing Torah, wisdom, and ethics. And right there in his shop he judges the people and passes decrees on communal affairs." On another visit to the mori's workshop, R. Sapir tells him: "You are blessed indeed, Mori Yosef, for you are a smith; woe unto those who enjoy the fruits of the rabbinate."'0 R. Ya'aqov Sapir goes on to describe two other communal dignitaries: Mori Suleiman Ta'izzi, who preached in the synagogue and earned a living as a goldsmith, and Avraham 'Adani, a merchant." The following is his account of the mori of 7. 'Amram Qorah, Sa 'arat Teiman (Jerusalem, 1954), p. 30, n. 33; S. D.

In the city of Yafid he met the officiating mori, Suleiman 'Amrani, who was also a merchant.14 Shibam had two communities--a local one, headed by Mori Aharon, a merchant; and one consisting of immigrants from San'a, headed by Mori Yosef Sha'tal, a smith.I5 There were two communities in Kawkaban as well: in addition to the local one, there was a congregation of refugees from San'a. Both were headed by Mori Yihye Badihi, a goldsmith who had plied that trade while still living in San'a, where he had minted coins for the imam.'6 In the city of 'Amran, Mori Suleiman Tan'ami, a refugee from San'a, was both spiritual leader and a shopkeeper.'7 Mori Yosef of Kuhlan was a tailor.'8 Mori Salim of Hajjeh, a refugee from San'a, was a merchant and tobacco-maker."9 The dignitaries of the city of Tan'um, headed by Mori Suleiman Safira, were for the most part wheat and fruit merchants;20 Mori Salim of Mokha was a goldsmith,21 and Mori Menahem Moshe of 'Aden exported goods to India, Ethiopia, and Egypt.22 In 19 10 an emissary of the Alliance Israelite Universelle, Yom Tov Semah, visited Yemen, and wrote the following account: This diminutive ironsmith, who returns home each evening to Jews' Street, carrying his tools on his back-why, he is a "moreh" (teacher) in the synagogue, highly respected by all.

He sits in the place of honor, instructs when to begin the prayers, interprets difficult passages of the Torah, and arranges the readings. Why, indeed, should he not be a dayyan (judge)?23 In 1911 the Zionist movement sent an emissary, Shmuel Yavne'eli, to Yemen, who described its spiritual leaders at length: Outside of San'a and 'Aden there is not a single scholar in the country whose wants are provided by the community. The learned men of this land, rabbis and judges (known as Mori), earn their own living by commerce or labor. To this very day, they observe the injunction against profiting from the Torah for one's own needs. 24 Of Mori Avraham San'ani of 'Amid he writes: "A scholar, for whom the Torah is his craft, but not his means of livelihood."25 In Arisa he met Mori Yihye , a goldsmith.26 The moris of 'Abar,27 Mori Ya'aqov of Aqmah,28 and Mori Sa'id David of Muqreh were all weavers.29 These descriptions indicate that the rabbinate in Yemen was marked by adherence to the precept "Torah together with labor"; the rabbis were of all trades: merchants, smiths, jewelers, weavers, shoemakers, tailors. As we saw in the description of the Jirwah community, some rabbis ministered to the community while actively engaged in their trade. Only in the large centers of San'a, 'Aden, and Rada' did the officiating rabbi receive a decent stipend from the community; in most other places the pay was meager. Under such conditions it is not surprising that the candidate often had to be persuaded to accept the post. The officiating rabbis had to make do without adequate compensation and pursue a modest lifestyle, devoid of luxury, both because the communal funds could not cover a handsome salary and due to fear of the authorities and the Muslim populace. We see, then, that in modem times, the office of mori in Yemen has differed from that of rav in Europe and hakham in Eastern communities. 23.

It is second only to the Jerusalem rabbinical court."'32 Learned men from Jewish communities all over Yemen would send questions to the San'a rabbis, accepting their authority. The style of these epistles indicates the centrality of the San'a dignitaries: a local dispute with a ritual slaughterer over an animal that had been slaughtered with a knife unfit for the ritual slaughter led to the suggestion that the matter be brought before the San'a rabbinical court. Thus does one of the rabbis write to his colleague: "Send your question to the San'a rabbinical court and, in your wisdom, please spare no effort; I myself will have no rest until I hear the answer sent down from the court, with God's help.33 R. Yihye 'Umeisi, last rabbi of Rada', the second-largest community in Yemen, habitually consulted the San'a halakhic authorities about his legal dilemmas, as did his father before him. In his preface to his anthology of responsa, comprising writings by the Rada' rabbis, he writes: As any right-thinking man can see with his own eyes, the San'a rabbis are our pride and joy (may we be protected for their sake, Amen); from earliest times until this very moment, these rabbis first shine, then dim: No sooner is Moses dead than Joshua stands forth.

The unquestioned supremacy of the San'a rabbis is evident in the style of the Rada' rabbis, who approached the San'a judges as well. All communities recognized their authority, and anyone they summoned would arrive immedi- ately or risk excommunication. A document dated 1894 reports a rumor of a man, reprimanded by the San'a rabbinical court, who made the pilgrimage to San'a along with friends and neighbors to inquire into the affair, indicating how binding were their judgments.36 It is noteworthy that in some remote areas of Yemen the imamite rulers, from their seat in San'a, failed to subjugate the local tribes, while the Jews all. over Yemen respected the authority of the center in San'a, and every Jew would do as bidden by its chief rabbi.37 When the need arose, disputants from small communities would approach the regional rabbinical court, located in a larger center, and if the matter could not be resolved, they would then go to San'a, as the highest legal instance.38 The chief rabbi of San'a periodically sent emissaries to far-flung commu- nities throughout Yemen to ensure that ritual slaughter was being performed properly and standards of religious observance maintained."39 On these visits they would issue documents attesting that they were acting upon the authority of the San'a rabbinical court.40 In the twentieth century, R. Yihye Nahum was a renowned expert in the requirements of ritual slaughter.41 Chief Rabbi Yihye Yishaq Halevi charged him with the task of traveling around the country to supervise the slaughterers and the rabbis who performed marriages and 34.

He also issued documents of authority to the religious functionaries, and wrote responsa to questions sent him by communal leaders.42 R. Levi Qeshet of the Dhamar community recounted that when R. Yihye Nahum came to visit his community, he was greeted with the greatest honor and hosted by the president of the community in his own home.43 They would customarily slaughter animals on Wednesdays or Thursdays, and R. Yihye Nahum would accompany the qualified slaughterers and examine their work. In 1679 the Jews were expelled from San'a and found refuge in Mawza', in southern Yemen. Two years later they were permitted to return, and resettled outside the city walls, where they lived until the establishment of the State of Israel and the emigration of the San'a community.44 One of the first ordinances passed upon their return from exile was to establish a permanent rabbinical court comprising three judges who held court every day, as they had done prior to their exile.45 Extant documents from the late seventeenth century contain the names of the heads of the rabbinical court. R. 'Amram Qorah, the last chief rabbi of Yemen, compiled this list based on the signatures in the Mesawwadeh, the San'a court's register, and using writs that the judges had signed as witnesses. The permanent rabbinical court was active until the early twentieth century.46 During this period, ten rabbis in turn held the position of head of the rabbinical court, functioning as halakhic authority and leader of the community. In 1872, the Turks conquered the capital of San'a and ruled Yemen for the next fifty years. In the early twentieth century, Imam Yahya Hamid Ad-Din succeeded in undermining their rule in Yemen. In the treaty signed in 1911, it was agreed that the Turks would leave Yemen in 1918. Imam Yahya remained in power and enjoyed a long reign until his assassination in 1948. Under Turkish rule, the Jews were required to name a leader, known as hakham bashi 42.

Seven rabbis officiated as hakham bashi; though a political-rabbinical role, it was filled mostly by the highest religious authorities, and in several cases, the head of the rabbinical court was simultaneously hakham bashi. In 1918, after the Turks had left Yemen, the religious leader was designated chief rabbi. The appointment was approved and signed by the leaders of the community.47 The religious leader was joined by a political functionary. At times, however, one man would fulfill both religious and political duties, the latter consisting mainly of maintaining ties with the authorities.

R. Yihye Abyad, 1932-1949, last chief rabbi. This list reveals that only in two cases did sons succeed their fathers in the rabbinate. R. Avraham Salih succeeded his father, R. Yihye, and R. Suleiman Qareh took office after his father, R. Yosef. As we will presently see, the difficulties of finding a replacement were instrumental in these family appointments. In the early nineteenth century (1808-1812), the San'a community was left without a head of the rabbinical court, its highest religious authority, for three years. Yehuda Nini surmises that the lacuna was caused by the demand of R. David Salih to be appointed to the office of rabbi held by his father, R. Avraham, and grandfather, R. Yihye;49 however, I submit that the material hardship entailed in the position was the cause of the delay, as no one could be found who would accept the position. In the mid-nineteenth century, R. Suleiman Qareh succeeded his father, as described by R. 'Amram Qorah: After the death of the head of the rabbinical court, Yosef Qareh, of blessed memory, the rabbis and community dignitaries were anxious to appoint his eldest son, R. Suleiman, to succeed his father as head of the rabbinical court. He refused, at first, as he had been accustomed since youth to liberty and a free hand, and did well in all his affairs. But it was decreed in heaven and he agreed, with the help of God.5o With the Turkish conquest in 1872, R. Suleiman was appointed the first hakham bashi. These two families, Salih and Qareh, were the most prominent rabbinical dynasties in the history of Yemenite Jewry: the Salih family held the office for nearly half a century, with R. Yihye Salih (Maharis) serving for forty-seven years; the Qareh family held the office for some seventy-seven years. An interesting exception on the list is the hakham bashi R. Yishaq Shaul, the only rabbi not from San'a. By request of the San'a community, he agreed to come from Turkey to serve as hakham bashi in Yemen. The invitation was extended in the hope that he would be able to foster good relations 49.

He was the only one of the rabbinical leaders to receive a regular salary from the community, and held office until his death." R. Yishaq Shaul was preceded in Yemen by his brother-in-law, the merchant David ben Shmuel Halevi Qaraso, who advocated inviting a rabbi from outside the community who would be paid a salary. As the community claimed they could not afford this, Qaraso advised imposing a tax on the purchase of various goods."2 Prior to R. Yishaq Shaul and after him as well, the post was held by R. Suleiman Qareh, a wealthy man not in need of a salary. During R. Yishaq Shaul's term of office, R. Suleiman Qareh continued to preside as head of the rabbinical court.53 There is no evidence to show that R. Suleiman Qareh had any objection to stepping down in favor of R. Yishaq Shaul, who even stayed at his home upon his arrival at San'a.54 In fact he seemed to welcome the replacement, since he was thereby relieved of his burdensome responsibilities. As mentioned above, he had initially refused when approached by the community to succeed his father. The wills left by three of the prominent rabbis who held office, R. Yihye Salih (Maharis), R. Yosef Qareh, and his son, R. Suleiman, make no mention of succession by sons or any other member of the family.55 The office of chief rabbi failed to provide a livelihood; the rabbis, forced to ply a trade, were burdened by their responsibilities, while at the same time unwilling to be supported by the community. Emolument from ritual slaughter, habitually granted the rabbi, was also a source of contention.56 When the head of the rabbinical court R. Shlomo Salih passed away in 1902, the leading citizens of the community met to appoint a replacement and chose R. Yihye Yishaq Halevi. His reaction is described by R. 'Amram Qorah: "When he heard that, he remonstrated with the assembly and fled 51.

Other Communities in Yemen The Jews of Yemen numbered around eighty thousand in recent gen- erations and were scattered in over a thousand different locations; most communities were very small, some consisting only of several households. The larger communities were located in San'a, Rada', Dhamar, and 'Aden.58 The mori in the small communities served as ritual slaughterer and mohel (circumcisor), teacher and preacher, and peace-maker; he performed marriages and divorces, and at times even collected the head tax (jizya) imposed by the Muslim authorities.59 Mori Yihye Mansura, for instance, who came to San'a from the city of 'Amran and married a woman from Shibam, recounts that Mori Salim Mansur, in Shibam, was the local slaughterer, teacher, performer of marriages and divorces, dentist-and still his cupboard was bare. Occasionally several scholars would act as mori, with the most learned among them considered the spiritual leader, whose authority was based on his eminence and scholarship. He received no pay, and earned his living by whatever trade he plied. He would receive, as did all the slaughterers, a portion of the meat or fowl slaughtered. Sometimes they would tutor students for a meager sum. This office passed from father to son, or to another member of the family, on condition that the candidate was deemed deserving. R. Sa'adya Hoze, rabbi of the village of Minzal, in southern Yemen, who succeeded his father, R. Rason Yefet, writes on this point, describing the Jewish customs in the southern region of Shar'ab: 57.

The following has been gleaned from documents and interviews with elders of the last generation in Yemen. In Sa'adah, in northern Yemen, the rabbinate passed from father to son over four generations: R. Ya'aqov, his son, R. Ya'bes, his grandson, R. Ya'aqov, and his great-grandson, R. 'Ovadia Ya'bes, today chief rabbi of Qiryat 'Eqron, in Israel.61 Yarim had the rabbinical dynasty of the Qafih family: R. Moshe was succeeded by his son, R. Hayyim, then his grandson Hayyim, who emigrated to Israel with the rest of Yemen's Jews.62 When rabbinical emissary R. Ya'aqov Sapir traveled to 'Amran in 1859, he visited the home of the rabbi and president, R. Suleiman Tan'ami.63 In the last generation, R. Yosef Tan'ami, presumably a descendant of the aforementioned family, was the rabbi of the community.64 In the Mahwit community, R. Yihye Shirom was head of the rabbinical court.. His son-in-law, R. Yehuda Durani, came to live in the community following his marriage, and with him came his brother Hayyim Durani, who studied with the father-in-law. The elderly R. Yihye appointed his pupil R. Hayyim as his successor; he, in turn, appointed his nephew to succeed him, R. Yosef Durani, son of R. Yehuda.65 In Al-'Iyyashiyah, east of Rada', at the turn of the century, R. Avraham San'ani was head of the rabbinical court.66 Family tradition has it that R. Avraham's grandfather was R. Shalom Halevi Alsheikh, who had left San'a in the mid-nineteenth century to become head of a rabbinical court elsewhere. 60.

Avraham San'ani was succeeded by his son, R. Shalom, who emigrated to Israel in 1950.67 In Kumeim, south of San'a, the head of the rabbinical court, R. Yihye Kumeimi Tom, also fulfilled political duties. He succeeded his maternal uncle, R. Yihye ben Yihye Wanneh.68 A similar picture of succession to the rabbinate in other communities in Yemen emerges from interviews conducted with rabbis. They noted that the incumbent would remain in office as long as he could discharge his duties, as the following examples show. In Rasaba R. Yihye Qafih was succeeded by two of his grandchildren: his son's son, R. Hayyim, who was succeeded by his cousin, R. Yihye Qafih's daughter's son, R. Nahum. In Bayda,69 the last rabbi to hold office was R. Salim Methanne, head of the rabbinical court, who succeeded his father, R. Methanne Salim;70 according to family tradition their rabbinical dynasty extended back to previous generations. In Sinwan, in southern Yemen, the head of the rabbinical court, R. H.ayyim Sinwani, succeeded his father, R. Yihye, who also ordained his son to the rabbinate.7' Dawale"s last rabbi was R. Avraham 'Afari, now living in Herzliya, Israel. He recounts the line of his predecessors in the Mehasri family: R. Avraham Mehasri succeeded his cousin, Mori Salim, who assumed office after his own father passed away. In Dahara, R. 'Awad took over from his father, R. Methanne, upon the latter's death. R. Rason David, now living in 'Afula, Israel, was mori in southern Yemen, following the death of his uncle, R. Dawid of his own community of Qarane, and of nearby Parah. R. Salim 'Athar was the regional religous authority in 'Athar, near San'a; he succeeded his father, R. Yosef. 67.

Ya'aqov Sapir noted that the heads of the Rada' community were Mori Salim Maniyyeh and Mori 'Awad Suleiman; in Dhamar, Mori Avraham Al-Qafih and Mori Avraham Al-Naddaf:73 the mention of two leaders reflects the structure: one held a political office, while the other was the spiritual-religious leader. As Sapir notes, in Rada', after Mori 'Awad Suleiman, the heads of the rabbinical court were R. Salim Harun, R. Yihye Salim 'Umeisi, R. Salim Hatuka, who was succeeded by his son, R. Shlomo.74 In Dhamar, the rabbinical court was headed, in recent generations, by R. Yihye Jereidi, followed by his disciple, R. Shlomo Melahi.75 In 'Aden, the following rabbis were heads of the rabbinical court in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries: R. Menahem Mansur, R. Menahem Benin Yeshu'a, Yishaq Hacohen, Salim Menahem, Yihye Avraham, Shlomo Cohen.76 Succession to the Rabbinate: Determining Factors We have seen, then, that in San'a and in other large communities like Rada', Dhamar, and 'Aden here were no rabbinical dynasties; in the medium- sized and smaller communities the office usually did pass from father to son. This arrangement was probably due to internal politics within the community as well as to external influence from the authorities. Internal Factors Economic aspects: Whereas in other countries the office of rabbi provided a stipend and means of livelihood, in Yemen the rabbis had to earn a living 72.

In the larger communities the rabbi's tasks were time-consuming, interfering with his trade. In the smaller communities, it was easier for the rabbi to find time to pursue his occupation. A letter written by Yom Tov Semah, the Alliance Israelite emissary to Yemen, dated 1910, tells of the many duties of the chief rabbi of San'a, R. Yihye Yishaq Halevi, vis-A-vis the community as well as the authorities.77 He was also supposed to maintain ties with other communities in Yemen and outside the country, all this leaving him very little time to provide for his family. R. Yosef Badihi, the third hakham bashi, also suffered financial distress after assuming office.78 R. Salim Jamal, the fifth hakham bashi, was unable to provide for his family on his meager salary, and was forced to sell off his private possessions. Finally, in pursuit of an adequate financial standing, he resigned.79 Yosef 'Amr was not an ordained rabbi; sought after by the community due to his contacts with the authorities, he agreed to become hakham bashi. He was a wealthy man, and gave so generously to the community and its poor, that he became impoverished.s0 The financial difficulties encountered by R. Yihye Qafih, the sixth hakham bashi, toward the end of the nineteenth century, were described by his disciple, R. Shalom Qorah: During all the days of his presidency, the rabbi's home suffered great need, since he couldn't ply his trade and didn't want to become a burden to the community; he thus found his pockets empty, his house bare of grain and other necessities, his sons went secretly hungry, and his wife remonstrated with him, saying: How could it come to this, among Jews, that a dignitary and leader of several communities has no bread to eat, nor to feed his family?"8 R. 'Amram Qorah describes the hakham bashi in similar fashion: "a dweller in the tent of Torah, whose words are of great wisdom-but his home is bare."82 77. Semah, "Une mission," p. 44. 78.

Yosef Badihi, the third hakham bashi, resigned because of his heavy duties."3 This point figured in the election of R. Yihye Abyad in the twentieth century. Following the death of R. Yihye Yishaq Halevi in 1932, Imam Yahya IHamid Ad-Din decreed that the Jews must appoint a chief rabbi. R. Yihye Abyad was chosen in absentia; when the news reached his ears, he refused, claiming he was unable to cope with such heavy duties. Only after they implored him did he finally relent, stipulating that he be given assistants. The writ of appointment, signed by the imam, bears the names of two assistants to the rabbi.84 Spiritual requirements: In San'a, the center of learning and scholarship, and in the other large communities, education was available to many, and the rabbi was elected to office from among his peers, by virtue of his achievement and excellence. R. Shmuel Yeshu'a, a scholar from 'Aden, recounts: My father, the mori, of blessed memory, told me that Mori Menahem, of blessed memory, was the head of the rabbinical court for one year only, since most of the community's prominent citizens were in accord to appoint my father, Yeshu'a, of blessed memory, since he was a greater scholar, and Mori Menahem, of blessed memory, would be his assistant. And for a reason unknown to me, Menahem, of blessed memory, was appointed head of the rabbinical court, and my father, Yeshu'a, of blessed memory, was second to him, following which my father Mori Yeshu'a was head of the rabbinical court for seventeen years, may their good deeds vouch for us.85 In smaller communities, however, where learning was less accessible, fathers would teach their sons, so it was natural for the son to become a scholar in his own right and continue the family tradition. Community structure: In many small communities, most of the populace belonged to a single extended family, so rabbinical dynasties evolved more naturally than in larger communities. Communal disputes: With the introduction of the Sephardic liturgy, two liturgies were created: Shami and Baladi.86 In halakhic decisions as well, the 83. Ibid., p. 50. 84.

Yosef Qaro had a marked influence, replacing to a degree the authority of Maimonides' Mishneh Torah.87 Chief Rabbi 'Amram Qorah tells how the change came about: Even in the days when they lived in the state of San'a88 they received printed siddurim [prayer books] with the Sephardic liturgy and were told that it was the accepted liturgy for prayers in Eres Yisrael; likewise, they were told that the inhabitants of Eres Yisrael had accepted the Shulhan 'Arukh and abided by its rulings. They felt it incumbent upon them to follow the practice of Eres Yisrael regarding the liturgy and other laws; many followed and formed their own separate community, called Shami. The rest continued to pray according to the ancient liturgy, the Tiklal, and follow the rulings of Maimonides: these were called Baladi.89 R. Qorah describes the split in the community, with the Baladi faction maintaining the traditional liturgy and following Maimonides as decisor, whereas the Shami accepted the Sephardic liturgy and followed the rulings of R. Yosef Qaro.90 Disputes ensued, especially in the eighteenth century, and Yemenite Jewry has been divided in recent generations, as described by R. Qorah. Another controversy made its appearance in the early twentieth century. At the time, a group of scholars in San'a, headed by R. Yihye Qafih, sought to introduce a new curriculum for the study of the Bible and religious education. Their emphasis was on the study of Mishnah, Talmud, and halakha rather than of Midrash and the mystical text of the Zohar, which prevailed in Yemen. The scholars also devoted much attention to the philosophical works of 87. Aharon Gaimani, "The Penetration of R. Yosef Qaro's Literary-Halakhic work into Yemen" (Hebrew), Pe 'amim 9 (1992): 120-134. 88. In 1679-80, the Jews of San'a and other communities were expelled to a desolate place called Mawza'. In 1681 they were permitted to return, though they resettled in a valley 3 kilometers distant from their previous dwelling-place, and remained there until they left Yemen. The rabbi's words refer to R. Yosef Qaro's influence before the expulsion. On the expulsion, see Gaimani, Yemenite Jewish Community. 89. Qorah, Sa 'arat Teiman, pp. 16-17. 90. Rabbis of the Shami faction did not consistently follow the Shulhan 'Arukh, some adhering to Shami practices only for certain customs and liturgy. See R. Rason 'Arusi, "Ha-mahloqet be-'inyan birkat ha-mosi be-se'udat haseva shel harabbim," in Sohar le-hasifat Ginzei Teiman, ed. Y. L.

They set out to eradicate the widespread superstitious practices of Yemenite Jewry, and wished, moreover, to augment secular study as well. R. Yihye and his colleagues met with strong opposition on the part of the other rabbis, headed by R. Yihye Yishaq Halevi. The opponents of the new ideas called the innovative group darda 'im, from dor de'a, "generation of knowledge."91 The conservative faction, headed by R. Yihye Yishaq, were dubbed 'iqqeshim--"stubborn generation." To a great extent it was the all-out opposition of R. Qafih and his innovative program to qabbalistic mysticism and the practices it generated that incurred the wrath of the conservative faction.92 The dispute grew more acute, necessitating Muslim arbitration between the two camps.93 In the aftermath of this controversy, some Yemenite scholars sent identical questions to two rabbis: R. Yihye Qafih and R. Yihye Yishaq Halevi. One question, sent by R. Suleiman Ya'ish 'Amr, of Shibam, pertained to hiding an object in the ground on the Sabbath, and another pertaining to a newly born calf, received identical rulings.94 The need to get rulings from both rabbis implies the degree to which the controversy was disrupting the community.95 With the death of the leaders of the two camps in 1932, the issue grew even more aggravated; in San'a, even the head-tax (jizya) was collected separately by the two factions.96 The image of the chief rabbinate was tarnished by the rift. In the eighteenth century, for instance, there had been a dispute over liturgy and halakhic rulings, with the Shami and Baladi camps each upholding its own position. In the late nineteenth century they split again over the emoluments 91. See Y. Ratzaby, "Darda'im (minhagot ve-taqanot)," 'Edut 1 (1946): 165. 92. Some of the correspondence pertaining to this controversy was published in Yeshaya and Sadoq, eds., Shevut Teiman (Tel Aviv, 1945), pp, 212-231. The leaders of the factions also wrote about it: see Yihye Qafih, Milhamot hashem (Jerusalem, 1931); idem, Emunat hashem (Jerusalem, 1938). 93.

The weakened position of the hakham bashi as a result of these polemics was described by Yehuda Nini in his discussion of the leadership and institutions of the community: Thus did the office of hakham bashi dwindle into abjectness. Instead of representing the community to the authorities and being a position of prestige, enjoying the complete trust of all sides, the role of hakham bashi became a stumbling-block for anyone trying to serve in that capacity; the post was accepted reluctantly and left reluctantly. Some were wise enough to step down in time, preserving their dignity and fortune, while the more naive left office penniless and humiliated.98 R. Shalom Qorah recounts in his memoirs how the leadership of R. Suleiman Qareh was plagued by controversy, including an attempt to depose him, which failed because of his charismatic personality.99 After his death, several rabbis were approached and offered the chance to step into his shoes as hakham bashi, but all refused. All the learned men suitable for this position were approached, but none of them agreed, since this generation is rebellious and many of the common people view themselves as competent leaders; the insolent put themselves forward, after the death of the great leader R. Suleiman Al Qareh, may his good deeds protect us.'1 Due to the perplexing situation, a lay leader, Yosef 'Amr, was appointed to the post, accepting after many entreaties on the part of the community. The difficulties faced by R. Yihye Yishaq Halevi, of the conservative faction, were described by R. 'Amram Qorah: He sought a peaceful life, hoping he could augment the family income by the fee from ritual slaughter. But those coveting honor and outward trappings were envious of his success as chief rabbi, and begrudged him the slaughter 97. Qorah, Sa 'arat Teiman, pp. 60-61. 98.

So in their envy they indirectly became involved with troublemakers, people seeking to rend the community asunder, and these rebellious ones took him to court with slanderous tales and perjurious witnesses. The chief rabbi feared not, nor did he give way.' 0 We see that even the arguments about the meager pay were not confined to the community and involved the Muslim courts. Following the death of R. Yihye Yishaq Halevi of the conservative faction in 1932, the Muslim authorities demanded that a chief rabbi be appointed. R. Yihye Abyad of the progressive camp was chosen, in the hope that he would restore calm to the ruffled community; however, he was given no peace either. R. 'Amram Qorah recounts: When the trouble-mongers heard that he had agreed to calm the ruffled waters by peaceful, honest means, they threatened that if he refused to heed them, they would set no end of obstacles in his path, just as they had done to the chief rabbi before him.'02 The account goes on to tell how his health failed and he died after serving as chief rabbi for two and a half years. R. Yishaq Rasabi, whose parents emigrated to Israel from Rasabeh, recounts that one of the rabbis eager for the post contested the choice of his grandfather, R. Yihye Qafih. The grandfather was prepared to step down, but the assembled heads of the community refused to let him. R. Avraham 'Afari, last rabbi of the Dawale' Jews, recounts that while his predecessor, R. Avraham Mehasri, was still alive, he himself was recognized by the community as the highest halakhic authority; his predecessor showed no objection to this status, and they remained on good terms. External Factors Pressure by the authorities: Since the capital, San'a, was the seat of the religious leader, the imam, the discriminatory laws against the protected minorities were strictly enforced there. R. Ya'aqov Sapir, on his 1859 visit 101. Qorah, Sa 'arat Teiman, p. 73. 102. Ibid., p. 77.</page><page sequence="22">322 AHARON GAIMANI to Yemen, met R. Suleiman Qareh, head of the San'a rabbinical court and hakham bashi, at Qaryat al Qabel, and tells: The great R. Mori Suleiman al Qareh, may he live long, head of the rabbinical court of San'a and all the states of Yemen, exhausted and persecuted by the cruel rulers of San'a, fled with many other prominent Jews seeking protection from the governors of this city, who promised (not for nothing) to protect them. He description of the fear of the Muslim authorities continues: "For years he has been unable to enter the capital, since they are lying in wait to seize and imprison him."'"' Even in the years of famine, which were many, the authorities imposed heavy taxes on the Jews of San'a.'" In other communities the Jews enjoyed good relations with their neighbors and were not persecuted by the authorities, at least not to the degree that made it impossible to accept the official post of chief rabbi. In other large cities, such as Rada' and Dhamar, rabbis were sometimes persecuted by the Muslim authorities. R. Salim Hatuka, head of the rabbinical court of Rada', was imprisoned with other rabbis, after protesting an especially high protection tax levied on the community.'"5 R. Yihye Jereidi and R. Shlomo Melahi, heads of the rabbinical court of Dhamar, were imprisoned for smuggling orphans from the city to save them from Islam.106 Conclusion Rabbis in Yemen combined spiritual leadership with a trade. The stipends provided by the larger communities enabled their rabbis to maintain an adequate standard of living, but the office often took a heavy toll on the rabbis' solvency, since the pressure of community demands forced them to abandon their occupations. The prestige of the office was further undermined by the ongoing factional controversy; the rabbi therefore suffered loss of 103. Sapir, Even Sapir, pp. 75-76. 104.

There was, moreover, the threat presented by the Muslim authorities, who frequently considered the rabbi a scapegoat for the Jewish community. Many, for all of the above reasons, were reluctant to accept the post of rabbi. Rabbinical dynasties were periodically abruptly cut short--notably in San'a and the other large communities-with the leading rabbis unwilling to search for a replacement, since no one wanted the post, and candidates repeatedly refusing the offer. However, in the smaller communities, the chain of succession was nearly unbroken, due perhaps to the relative absence of internal rivalry and controversy, and the good relations with the Muslim neighbors. Even though rabbis in the smaller communities also suffered financial difficulties, they usually served to term, and the chain of succession from father to son (or son-in-law) was more sustained than in the larger communities.</page></plain_text>
