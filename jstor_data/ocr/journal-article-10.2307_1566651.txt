<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELIGIOUS AFFIRMATION AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM IN HESCHEL'S BIBLICAL INTERPRETATION by JON D. LEVENSON I Not least among the bittersweet gifts of modernity to the Jews is the complication of dealing with the Bible both as sacred scripture and as a document subject to the same canons of inquiry as any other historical, or putatively historical, record. The problem goes far beyond the familiar one posed by narratives that ancient historians find doubtful or quite impossible. For historical critical research into the Tanakh (as into all other scriptures) also uncovers the processes of development of the worldviews within the literature and thus puts a painful question to those who wish to affirm Judaism as a contemporary reality. How can a literature so variegated and contradictory speak with a normative voice today? It is no wonder that so many biblical scholars avoid the normative theological questions altogether and content themselves with historical and philological description (which, of course, presupposes norms of its own). It is also no wonder that so many religious practitioners neglect the historical issues and treat their scriptures as representing a static, uniform, and unvarying worldview-not surprisingly, the worldview of their own, postbiblical affirmation. Among scholars committed both to a scripture-based religious affirmation and to intellectually honest historical reconstruction, the relationship between them is a matter of long-standing discussion. In Christian circles, it has often been formulated as a relationship between biblical theology, on the one hand, and dogmatic or systematic theology, on the other. Perhaps the first articulation AJS Review 25/1 (2000/2001): 25-44 25</page><page sequence="2">26 JON D. LEVENSON of this formulation was given in Johann Philipp Gabler's oft-quoted inaugural address upon assuming the chair in theology at the University of Altdorf in 1787. "Biblical theology is historical in character," Gabler wrote, "and sets forth what the sacred writers thought about divine matters." In this, it is to be distinguished from "dogmatic theology [which] is didactic in character and sets forth what a particular theologian philosophically and rationally decides about divine matters.''1 In Gabler's definition, we hear a classic statement of the characteristically modern distinction between description and prescription, or between historical and constructive theology. Biblical theology is descriptive and historical; dogmatic theology is prescriptive and constructive. On this understanding, biblical theologians will perforce involve themselves in the critical reconstruction of the historical context of the literature whose theology they are expounding. But in Gabler's words we also hear an echo of Spinoza's definition of his own agenda with respect to the Bible a century earlier. "We are at work not on the truth of passages," Spinoza insisted, "but solely on their meaning."2 In the Spinozan mode, which has dominated the university world for nearly two centuries, biblical study is no longer an approach to truth and no longer self-consciously in a mutually critical conversation with philosophy. Its goal is limited to ascertaining what someone in the distant past thought, and the role of the Bible in contemporary religious life is thus either safely ignored or conveniently passed off to someone in another field. In the case of Jewish Studies, in which practitioners of Gabler's dogmatic theology are exceedingly few and far between, the effect has been to drive biblical studies into an extremely descriptive, historicistic profile, with few self-conscious attempts to articulate a fresh, critically defensible affirmation of the Tanakh as sacred scripture.3 1.

Instead, alongside historical criticism (but not in place of it), there arose a movement to distinguish biblical theology from the history of the religion of Israel. Surveying the field in the mid-1950s, Robert C. Dentan insisted that unlike the history of the religion of Israel, biblical theology must "describe the persistent and distinctive principles of Old Testament religion in some kind of logical or 'theological' order."4 To this day, biblical theologians can be found who quest after the "overarching unity" or the "center" of biblical theology as if it were the Holy Grail.5 What drives them is a need to define a norm for contemporary religious believers and not merely to describe past affirmations as accurately and fairly as they can, which is the work of historians of the religion of Israel. The late Moshe Goshen-Gottstein spoke eloquently in favor of this need from an explicitly Jewish point of view. Biblical theologians, he wrote some two decades ago, work from a basis of "faith, identification, acknowledgment of value and meaningfulness, of taking a personal stance in the present, which draws nourishment from the same spring from which the teachings (torot) of the past flowed."6 Here, Goshen-Gottstein states more than the truism that historical reconstruction inevitably involves personal commitments and subjective factors. He is, rather, defining biblical theology as a bridge between the ancient teachings and those modem persons committed to them in faith and at the most fundamental level of their identity. In Goshen- Gottstein's vision, biblical theology must be both descriptive and prescriptive, both historical and normative. It must, in fact, correlate Gabler's binary opposites and cannot concentrate on only one of them. So conceived, the discipline will invite the derision of both fundamentalists and positivists. For the former do not 4. Dentan, Preface to Old Testatment Theology, p. 92. 5. See Levenson, Hebrew Bible, pp. 54-56. For a recent example, see Rolf P.

LEVENSON recognize or attribute religious significance to the historical context and development of biblical literature, and the latter see religious faith and allegiance to a particular community of interpretation as intellectually indefensible. The greatest challenge to the whole enterprise of biblical theology is, then, just how to bridge the chasm between the two dimensions, how to correlate the very postures that Enlightenment thought tends to dichotomize and polarize. II One major Jewish figure who attempted to meet this formidable challenge was Abraham Joshua Heschel (1907-72). As in the fields of rabbinics, Eastern European devotion, and especially Hasidism, so in Bible Heschel sought to blaze a path to a spiritual use of the material that was not out of conversation with modem critical discourse. Indeed, given his own personal investment in traditional Jewish practice and his doctoral work at the University of Berlin under Christian biblical critics, the matter could hardly have been otherwise.7 It is in part II of Heschel's classic and most systematic presentation of his theology, God in Search of Man, that we find his most sustained exploration of how and why Jews--or perhaps Jews and Gentiles alike-should attend to the Bible. This discussion is really a theology of the place of the Bible in Judaism. As such, it does not fall into either side of Gabler's classic dichotomy of biblical theology and dogmatic theology. For like the biblical theologian, Heschel insists that the voice of the Bible be heard and heeded, but like the dogmatic theologian, he writes from a vantage point defined by postbiblical texts and his own personal theology. Heschel is, in short, clearly seeking (to recall Goshen- Gottstein's words) to build a bridge between the ancient "teachings" and those modem persons committed to them in faith and through a "personal stance in the present" that derives from the most fundamental level of their identity. As Heschel's title suggests, the book has a defensive tone: man has strayed far from God and closed himself off to God's incessant invitation to return and 7. See Edward K. Kaplan and Samuel H. Dresner, Abraham Joshua Heschel: Prophetic Witness (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998), pp. 101-71.</page><page sequence="5">RELIGIOUS AFFIRMATION AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM 29 to heed. What brings that closure about and sustains it is a set of spiritual postures and intellectual presuppositions that make modem persons deaf to biblical revelation. Published in 1955, the book evidences the disadvantage that educated adherents of revealed religion felt in an era in which science enjoyed higher prestige than it usually does today and was viewed as the key to human progress. For chief among those deleterious spiritual postures is what Heschel calls "the idea of man's self-sufficiency, man's exaggerated consciousness of himself," based on the false generalization that because "technology could solve some problems ... technology could solve all problems."8 The high status of science is evident, for example, in Heschel's attempt to argue for the possibility of prophetic revelation through an analogy with physics and biology. "If the stream of energy that is stored up in the sun and the soil can be channeled into a blade of grass," he writes, "why should it be a priori excluded that the spirit of God reached into the minds of men?"9 When he deals with the more specific issue of the phenomenology of Israelite prophetic consciousness (the subject of his dissertation two decades earlier at the University of Berlin), Heschel attempts to counter modem cultural prejudices against the prophets of Israel, especially the view of them as psychologically impaired, and to construct arguments for their authenticity and reliability. He characterizes "efforts ... to prove the pathological nature of the prophets" as "frantic" and claims that "no trace or symptom of abnormality or frenzy has been detected in either Moses or Isaiah, in either Amos or Jeremiah."' The opposition of the prophets to some common cultic practices of their times gives Heschel ammunition to counter a common belief of his own age, the naturalistic, progressivist belief that prophets received their messages from the spirit of the times rather than through divine inspiration. "If the prophets were inspired by the 'spirit of the age,' why did they express horror at such acts of 'supreme piety' [as the sacrifice of the first-born son]?" he asks." 8.

Ibid., p. 230.</page><page sequence="6">30 JON D. LEVENSON But HIeschel also goes further, moving beyond these defensive moves in support of the possibility of revelation to positive arguments for the reliability of the Bible. Alas, most of these arguments rest on nothing more than sheer assertion. "Use your imagination and try to conceive of a book that would excel the Bible," he challenges his reader, "and you will admit that the power of the spirit has never gone farther than the Bible."12 Or again: "If God is alive, then the Bible is his voice."13 Acknowledging the need for evidence, Heschel avers that "the Bible is its own witness," and that "the evidence for its unique origin is that of self-evidence." He even goes so far as to claim that "we do not accept the Bible because of reasons, but because if the Bible is a lie all reasons are a fake."'14 Thus, "in calling upon the prophets to stand before the bar of our critical judgment, we are like dwarfs undertaking to measure the heights of giants."'5 In Heschel's theology, our very exercise of critical judgment upon the prophets thus turns into an act of hubris. The strength of these arguments in part II of God in Search of Man varies widely. The attack on the illusion of man's self-sufficiency, for example, has a basis in logic, and if humanity is not self-sufficient but depends upon some higher power, it again stands to reason that the higher power has, in one fashion or another, made known its character and will. Why the Jewish Bible should be taken as the supreme revelation of the highest power Heschel does not say, however, and his argument from self-evidence is tautological. Heschel's rebuttal of the diagnosis of psychopathology in the prophets is even more problematic and skirts major theoretical issues in the historical application of psychology. I suspect that if a contemporary had reported to Heschel experiences like those of the prophets, hearing the voice of God telling him to overthrow empires, for example (cf. Jer 1:9-10), Heschel would not for a moment have hesitated to recommend counseling. If, by contrast, the biblical prophets are to be exonerated from the suspicion of mental illness, then one has to deny the existence of 12. Ibid., p. 241. 13. Ibid., p. 245. 14. Ibid., p. 247. 15. Ibid., p. 222.</page><page sequence="7">RELIGIOUS AFFIRMATION AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM 31 universal, culture-free criteria of mental health, at least with respect to visions and auditions. This more contextual posture fits nicely with Heschel's own view that "God does not speak equally at all times" and that "at a certain moment ... the spirit of prophecy departed from Israel."'6 Note, however, that theological language is not strictly necessary here, and that Heschel's attempt to argue for the supernatural inspiration of the prophets of Israel fails. For one can just as easily place the more contextual position on a purely naturalistic basis: in a culture in which visions and auditions of the deity are generally accepted, those who have them are not judged to be ill, as many cultured despisers of religion would have it, but neither do their reports of their experiences have to be reckoned as authentic accounts of extrapsychic reality, as Heschel would wish. If we take this more contextual stance, then Heschel oversimplifies egregiously when he argues that "there are only three ways of judging the prophets: they told the truth, deliberately invented a tale, or were victims of an illusion."17 I might add that in citing Moses, Isaiah, Amos, and Jeremiah as examples of prophets without symptoms of psychopathology, Heschel omits the prophet most often diagnosed as abnormal, Ezekiel.'8 This is the prophet who loses his capacity to speak and is apparently tied up (3:25-26), who lies on his left side for 390 days and on his right for 40 days without moving (4:4-6), who reports that the wind seized him by the hair and transported him through the atmosphere hundreds of miles, from Babylonia to Jerusalem (8:1-4), and so on.19 The omission of Ezekiel makes sense in terms of Heschel's own priorities as a biblical interpreter. For Heschel tends to concentrate on the ethical and spiritual dimensions of the prophecy, which are more appealing to modem persons, at the expense of the more mantic, magical, and cultic dimensions of the phenomenon, 16. Ibid., p. 205. 17. Ibid., p. 223. 18. Note the absence of a chapter on Ezekiel in Abraham Joshua Heschel, The Prophets: An Introduction (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1962). Ezekiel is the only major prophet to whom no chapter is therein devoted. 19. See Klaus Koch, The Prophets, vol. 2 (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1984), pp. 92-94; David J. Halperin, Seeking Ezekiel: Text and Psychology (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1993).</page><page sequence="8">32 JON D. LEVENSON especially evident in the case of Ezekiel but not peculiar to him. In this, we see the liberal or modernist side of Heschel, the side deeply influenced by the Protestant reading of the prophets as social reformers and advocates of a religion of inwardness and emotional intensity. As late as 1955, when he published God in Search of Man, Heschel was obviously still under the influence of his first critical introduction to the prophets at the hands of liberal Protestant biblicists in Germany nearly three decades earlier.20 If Heschel were to accept what I have termed the more contextual position, he would have to back off considerably from his claim that prophetic opposition to phenomena like the sacrifice of the firstborn son could not possibly have come from the spirit of the age, but must rather have derived from divine inspiration. An engagement with the history of the religion of Israel would show Heschel that ancient Israel, like every other culture, was not monolithic and static but diverse, in flux, and not lacking in inner contradiction and conflict. Noting the biblical accounts of the sacrifice of sons by the Moabite king Mesha and the Israelite kings Ahaz and Manasseh (the latter two are denounced for the practice), Heschel asks rhetorically, "Why was not the worship of the God of Israel like the worship of Baal or Tammuz?"21 The answer is that in many ways it was. Had he mentioned the most developed text about the sacrifice of a son in the Bible (which is also an extremely important text in rabbinic tradition), the Binding of Isaac (Gen 22:1-19), Heschel might have seen that his belief in the empirical uniqueness of Israel was simplistic and hardly a firm foundation on which to build a claim of revelation. For in that text the God of Israel commends Abraham and richly rewards him for his exemplary willingness to sacrifice his beloved son (Gen. 15-18), and the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim traditions have celebrated him for it for millennia.22 I should add that opposition to child sacrifice was not unique to the prophets of Israel but also existed in pagan culture. Greek and Latin authors were horrified by the Carthaginians' 20. See Kaplan and Dresner, Abraham Joshua Heschel, pp. 101-171. 21. God in Search of Man, p. 230. 22. See Jon D.

It is obviously not the billions of Christians in the world who believe that they do indeed know a book that excels the Jewish Bible and in which the spirit has revealed itself in greater depth: it is called the New Testament. Nor can the "you" refer to the hundreds of millions of Muslims who revere a book that is the final revelation of the God of Abraham to mankind, the Qur'an, the Word of God communicated to the consummation of all prophets, Muhammad. And when members of communities that revere the Bhagavad Gita, the Tao Te Ching, or the Book of Mormon come upon the Hebrew Bible, do they then throw out these inferior books and admit that Heschel's claim was right?27 The presupposition of Heschel's affirmation of the spiritual supremacy of the Jewish Bible is that we have access to some neutral, objective standard by which to judge the spiritual worth of books. If that standard is applied, he 23. Ibid., pp. 18-24. 24. Ibid., pp. 43-52. 25. On the danger of decontextualizing the ancient practice of the sacrifice of the firstborn son, see Jon D. Levenson, "Abusing Abraham: Traditions, Religious Histories, and Modern Misinterpretations," Judaism 47, no. 3 (1998): 259-77. 26. God in Search of Man, p. 241. 27. The tension between this argument that the Jewish scriptures are self-evidently the most excellent and Heschel's commitment to religious pluralism and interfaith dialogue is painful. The tension is not one that he succeeded in resolving, probing, or interpreting. On Heschel's general failure to acknowledge and grapple with the tensions in his work, see Jon D. Levenson, "The Contradictions of A.J. Heschel," Commentary 106, no. 1 (July 1998): 34-38.</page><page sequence="10">34 JON D. LEVENSON claims, the Tanakh will win hands down. He does not tell us how we can find this objective norm for ranking scriptures, nor does he here seem to suspect that his views on the matter may be colored by his identity as a practicing Jew, a rabbi, and a professor at a Jewish seminary. In this, we see the lack of critical reflexiveness that was typical of religious writers in Heschel's generation, especially biblical theologians.28 Here his traditionalism dominates, and he privileges the Bible in ways that no historical critic can accept. Although he invites the application of the objective criterion to other books, Heschel disallows the comparable critical evaluation of the works of biblical prophecy. "In calling upon the prophets to stand before the bar of our critical judgment, we are like dwarfs undertaking to measure the heights of giants," he wrote.29 Instead, in this case we are to rely on self-evidence and accept the Bible alone as "its own witness."'" The double standard is palpable. III Heschel's goal in part H of God in Search of Man is to persuade modem Western Jews of the truth of the Bible and its religious vision, as he understands it. The problem with which he struggles throughout this section is to find ground common to himself and his readers that will compel them to accept the Bible as divine revelation. In part I of the book, Heschel has already addressed the similar but logically prior problem of God and appeals to a supposedly universal "sense of awe, a need to adore, an urge to worship"31 as the common ground that he hopes will persuade his readers to accept Judaism. How one moves from that general experience to the specific adoration and worship of the God of Israel revealed in his Written and Oral Torahs is a formidable problem and one that bedevils Heschel in much of his work. The "sense of awe" is actually of less help here than Heschel thinks. Consider an illustration. Some people do indeed gaze at a pellucid mountain lake reflecting 28.

Ibid., p. 88.</page><page sequence="11">RELIGIOUS AFFIRMATION AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM 35 the rising sun and say, as Heschel would wish, "God is our father." Others, beholding the same scene and adhering to a position against which Heschel explicitly cautions, say, "The earth is our mother."32 Still others, remembering innocent comrades-in-arms lost in the Pacific theater, might say, "Damn those Japanese" or "There is no justice and there is no Judge." Whatever the relative worth of these three responses, raw experience alone cannot arbitrate among them. In my judgment, Arthur A. Cohen is thus correct to question Heschel's conviction that "the living encounter with reality takes place ... on a level that is responsive, immediate, preconceptual and presymbolic."33 For the conscious mind has no uninterpreted experiences, and all involvement in human society is mediated through language, society, and culture. This observation, more commonly made today than in Heschel's lifetime, helps explain why his quest for common ground with his secular readership was so frustrating. The Archimedian point that would enable him to move his skeptical readers toward the God of Israel and his revelation continually eluded him. But without something larger than his own private experience to which to appeal, Heschel would be unable to communicate the love, the joy, and the meaning that he found in Judaism. For despite Heschel's Romantic emphasis on religious experience, Judaism is for him still by nature too public, historical, and communal to be confined to the realm of individual experience and private choice. It is not reducible to personal mysticism or to a means of personal self-expression, nor is it, as we have seen, simply one option among many of equal worth. Analyzed logically and historically, Heschel's arguments on behalf of the God of Israel and the literature he revealed are often problematic and raise questions that one wishes he had addressed, as I have tried to demonstrate. Rereading them, one is reminded of Arthur Cohen's characterization of Heschel's argumentation: 32. Cf. Abraham Joshua Heschel, The Sabbath: Its Meaning for Modern Man (New York: Farrar, Straus, &amp; Giroux, 1951), p. 76: "We usually think that the earth is our mother, that time is money and profit our mate. The seventh day is a reminder that God is our father, that time is life and the spirit our mate." 33. Arthur A. Coheft, The Natural and the Supernatural Jew: An Historical and Theological Introduction (New York: Pantheon Books, 1962), p. 246, n. 25.</page><page sequence="12">36 JON D. LEVENSON So often in Heschel's work the argument begins with all seriousness and candor only to gather speed, accelerate, dropping premises along the way, until it culminates in a rhapsodic evocation of its conclusion. The reason for this eccentricity of style is not hard to locate. Essentially, Heschel is bored with argument. What need is there for argument in the presence of the pious and of him who lives before the ineffable?34 Cohen is correct that a keen perception of the ineffable and a passion to communicate it to others does not exempt a theologian from general standards of argumentation and logic. In particular, for the reasons I have just given, Heschel's "rhapsodic evocation" of the ineffable fails to secure the connection to unique historical revelation upon which Judaism and its understanding of its Bible are based. But Cohen goes too far when he writes that Heschel's "rhetoric is both the strength and the undoing of his theology."35 It would be more accurate to say that Heschel's rhetoric is both the strength and the limitation of his theology. The strength lies in its capacity to shake readers loose from their ordinary perceptions, to give them a sense that their instinctive modes of reasoning are too cramped and too mundane, and to present them with a view of something higher and deeper and an experiential access to the ineffable. The limitation is that in the process Heschel often makes logical and historical claims that cannot withstand critical interrogation. The reader seeking a spiritual reading of biblical passages will find a rich treasure in Abraham Joshua Heschel's work. But the reader seeking biblical theology understood, in accordance with the definition given above, as a religious affirmation and appropriation of the Bible that reckons seriously and fairly with the evidence of modem criticism will be constantly disappointed. This highly rhetorical and motivational approach to the Bible indicates that it may also be a mistake to classify Heschel's work in Tanakh as Jewish philosophy, as the subtitle of God in Search of Man: A Philosophy of Judaism 34. Ibid., p. 44. Cohen's section on Heschel (pp. 234-59) is to date one of the few discussions that are hard-headed enough to subject Heschel's interplay of medium and message to critical scrutiny. 35. Ibid., p. 235. Note that Cohen does not use the term "rhetoric" solely in the negative sense that it has acquired. He is at pains to point out that it has "a distinguished, an illustrious past" and that "the rhetorician, because of the morality of his end, possesses a constructive art" (p. 234).</page><page sequence="13">RELIGIOUS AFFIRMATION AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM 37 suggests. The project actually has closer affinities with what Christians tend to call "apologetics."36 P. J. Cahill, writing from a Roman Catholic perspective, observes that "the apologetic attempt is an effort to persuade [and] persuasion, as the purpose of apologetics, is primarily directed to the will, that the individual may respond to God."" Cahill is at pains to point out that "apologetics will begin within theological thinking,"38 but it differs from "positive theology," which he defines as "theology as it actually unfolds in the theological sources."39 Understood in this way, "apologetics" denotes an honorable and necessary endeavor, and the term need not have the pejorative taint that it has acquired. For surely no religious tradition can survive in the modem world without gifted apologists to articulate its defense in the face of modem despisers and to renew its power against the challenges of other worldviews and of its own tendency to become inbred and self-referential. In this role, the role of an apologist seeking to help the individual respond to God, Heschel was strikingly successful, as the continued popularity of his books nearly thirty years after his passing indicates, and as many who have been moved by them readily attest. On matters in which the task is to persuade and induce an action, in particular to persuade the individual to respond to God, so that the will is the site of the principal action, Heschel's work has proven extraordinarily effective. And here, his rhetoric is a major factor in his success and not, as this term, too, might unfortunately suggest, a matter of mere ornamentation or, worse, disingenuousness. It is on matters in which Heschel seeks to convince his readers of the truth of his claims, however, so that the mind is the site of the principal action, that Arthur Cohen's critique is more telling. The problem is not that Heschel writes in a highly rhetorical, poetic, and inspirational mode. It is, rather, that he uses 36. Note Edward K. Kaplan, "Abraham Joshua Heschel," in Interpreters of Judaism in the Late Twentieth Century, ed. Steven T. Katz (Washington: B'nai B'rith Books, 1993), p. 131: "His work, in its pragmatic aspect, functions as a vast apologetics." Note also that H. Susannah Heschel, borrowing a term from Richard Rorty, sees her father as an "edifying philosopher." Kaplan, p. 142, referring to p. xxxvii of her preface to the 1987 version of God in Search of Man (Northvale, N.J.: Jason Aronson). 37. P. J.

LEVENSON these powerful gifts to deny that what Cahill calls "positive theology" is necessary at all. His apologetics, in other words, is his positive theology, and it prevents him from confronting the substantive challenges, theological and historical, to the vision of faith into which he seeks to draw his readers. Indeed, as we shall see, it also prevents Heschel from delving very deeply into "theology as it actually unfolds in the theological sources." It is this use of his enormous apologetic and rhetorical gifts that points to the element of truth in Cohen's critique and suggests the limitation of Heschel's strategy of reclaiming the Bible for the modem Jew. This is the limitation that inevitably arises when an apologist refuses to "begin within theological thinking," as Cahill puts it, and instead employs the highly problematic category of raw religious experience as the foundation for his enterprise. Heschel's success and failure in his biblical work are thus two sides of the same coin. Lacking common intellectual ground with his secular, Westernized readers, he relies heavily on the rhetoric of rhapsodic language. But rhetoric, even without the pejorative taint the word too often carries, can go only so far, and some truth claims, including historical claims, must be made in even the most personal, evocative, and apologetic religious writing. There is no substitute for "positive theology ... theology as it actually unfolds in the theological sources," to use Cahill's terms again.40 It is in his efforts to dismiss positive theology and the tools that enable modems to recover the theology of the sources that the limitations of Heschel's mode of persuasion become problematic. Some examples from his textual studies on the Bible will prove illustrative here. IV Heschel's emphasis on the dimension of inwardness and the religious consciousness of the prophet is his most enduring and innovative contribution to biblical studies. It makes The Prophets still well worth reading four decades after it was published and over six decades after he laid the groundwork for it in his dissertation at Berlin. It is important to remember, however, that within 40. Ibid.</page><page sequence="15">RELIGIOUS AFFIRMATION AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM 39 Heschel's overall theology, the phenomenology of prophetic consciousness neither stands on its own nor constitutes the ground of a would-be universal spirituality, free from particular historical claims. In fact, against those who would limit Judaism to "a way of living," he identifies this as "one of its cardinal premises": that "the source of truth is found ... in unique events that happened at particular moments in history."41 The most important of these moments for Heschel, as for most, if not all, Jewish thinkers, is that of the Sinaitic revelation. "It is forever impossible," he writes, "for us to retreat into an age that predates the Sinaitic event."42 This being the case, one might have thought that historical inquiry was crucial to the understanding of the text. But Heschel is leery of history and even goes so far as to write that inquiry into the "historic background [of an address by God] . . . will revolve around the adventitious, just as a discussion of colons and semicolons will hardly bring out the content of a sentence."43 "How the words were written down is not the fundamental problem," he tells us. "That is why the theme of Biblical criticism is not the theme of faith."44 In these comments, one hears the continuing dichotomization and polarization of critical thought and religious faith, and senses keenly the continuing influence of Heschel's Orthodox upbringing and early education. Though Judaism is based upon "unique events that happened at particular moments in history," he maintains that inquiry into that very history is beside the point and can never illumine the spiritual meaning of the report of revelation to any significant degree. The historical background thus has no more relevance to the meaning of the revealed text than punctuation has to the meaning of a sentence, and biblical criticism is seen as nothing more than a discussion of the religiously insignificant, mechanical issue of how the words were written down. This is not, to be sure, the more resolute Orthodoxy that insists on the Mosaic 41. God in Search of Man, p. 197. 42. Ibid., p. 167. 43. Ibid., p. 178. The irony is that probably no tradition in the world has been more meticulous in matters of punctuation or committed to the idea that accurate punctuation is critical to the proper conveying of meaning than the Jewish tradition of scriptural transmission and study. 44. Ibid., p. 258.</page><page sequence="16">40 JON D. LEVENSON authorship of the total Pentateuch as a point of dogma. Rather, Heschel makes a sharp dichotomy between divine inspiration and Mosaic authorship, insisting that "philosophy of religion must deal with the first part" only.45 His position here is that of a more relaxed premodern tradition that could accept the idea that, in his words, later authors "had been inspired to add some lines to the Pentateuch" after Moses' death.46 But note that as in the case of those premodern traditionalists, the theological objective is to dismiss the chronological issues as religiously irrelevant, or as he scoffingly puts it, "as if the authenticity [of the Pentateuch] could be verified by a notary public."47 This is the traditionalist Heschel: he continues a premodern mode of textual study with just enough concession to modem historical-critical study that he cannot fairly be charged with fundamentalism, but he does not concede any positive religious role to the new, post-Enlightenment modes of biblical study. He reacts so vehemently to the reductionist potential of the Spinozan-Gablerian agenda that he produces his own equally reductionist view of the labor of biblical critics and its relevance to theological construction in the light of modem knowledge. Here, for purposes of clarification, I should like briefly to suggest an alternative view of the issue, one more in dialogue with the academic field of biblical theology as it stood even in Heschel's time. To be sure, Heschel's likening critical biblical scholarship to the study of punctuation or verification by a notary, though a gross overstatement, is not without a grain of truth. Modem biblical studies does sometimes descend to the level that Heschel is parodying, and critical methods are too often put into the service of a secular reductionism. But most of the time, the historical inquiries and the detailed philological studies that support them are in the service of uncovering and recovering the "particular moment in history" (to use Heschel's term) in which and to which the literature spoke. For the underlying assumption is that even if the text is the product of revelation-and there is no dearth of critical biblical scholars who believe it is-it appears in human language, and human language, 45.

In this theology, unlike Heschel's, inquiries into historical background and chronology are anything but adventitious, and the spiritual message that the contemporary believer seeks to elucidate cannot be recovered or heard with any accuracy except through interaction with the history of the religion of Israel. This interaction is almost entirely lacking in the biblical studies of Abraham Joshua Heschel. His handling of the prophets gives us a good sense of how his theology affects his reading of specific texts. The book with that title is organized in the form of glosses and paraphrases to scriptural passages in the Masoretic recension. Almost completely absent is a concern for the meat and potatoes of modem biblical scholarship: the overall structure or compositional history of the books, the rhetorical shape of specific textual units, the patterning of the literature according to conventional settings, its variations in sources, the authenticity of the oracles, or the relevance of the literature of the ancient Near Eastern world with which the prophets show both continuity and discontinuity. In structure, The Prophets thus resembles a traditional rabbinic commentary in certain significant ways. These are the signs of what I earlier called the traditionalist Heschel. It would be a capital error, however, to see in Heschel a Jewish traditionalist interpreting the Bible within the canons of the premodern tradition and therefore without regard to historical criticism. Indeed, The Prophets is virtually devoid of connections to the exegeses of the prophetic literature recorded in classical rabbinic midrash or in medieval Jewish commentary.49 Even though its author disparages and minimizes historical-critical scholarship, The Prophets shows an enormous indebtedness to it and could not possibly have been written without it. The table of contents already gives us a telltale indication: Isaiah is divided into 48. See Emil L. Fackenheim, Quest for Past and Future: Essays in Jewish Theology (Boston: Beacon Press, 1968), especially chaps. 2, 3, 6, 14, and 18. 49. Still less should the book be seen as exemplifying the subjectivism or relativism of reader- response criticism or kindred methods that have emerged since his death, for these are quite alien to Heschel's theological agenda.</page><page sequence="18">42 JON D. LEVENSON two books, the second of which is treated only after Micah, Jeremiah, and Habakkuk have intervened.50 In short, recognizing the implication of modem source criticism (and tacitly conceding that it involves far more than the study of punctuation), Heschel has ordered his presentation chronologically and historically rather than canonically. He has also departed from the traditional midrashic and commentarial approach in treating the prophetic books on their own, rather than seeing them as subordinate to the Pentateuch and subsequent to it. This stands in marked contrast to the premodern Jewish tradition, which, even in its more heterodox moments, still sees the Pentateuch as prior to the rest of the Tanakh both axiologically and chronologically. Indeed, one of the programmatic discoveries of nineteenth-century biblical criticism was that the prophets did not preach from a Torah book or even know of a revelation of a law code to Moses, and that major parts of the Torah, in fact, postdate the prophets.51 The recovery of the distinctive voice of the prophets of Israel for Jewish theology is a modem phenomenon inconceivable without the emergence of classical biblical criticism. And the recovery and re-presentation of the distinctive voice of the prophets, apart from the Torah and from rabbinic interpretation, is a major objective of The Prophets. It is an objective very much on the modernist side of the history of biblical interpretation. Though the discovery that the prophets did not know of a Torah of Moses has been liberating to some Christians of an antinomian bent, it has been troubling to Jews committed to observing the Torah in a traditional way. One would have expected a Jewish scholar writing on the prophets, and a traditionally observant Jew to boot, to grapple with it, but Heschel does not. 50. It is true that Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra already recognized the unlikelihood that Isaiah of Jerusalem authored the passages in the book of Isaiah that speak of the return from the Babylonian exile a century and a half after his death (see ibn Ezra to Isa 40:1). It is a far cry from this single observation to the treatment of Isaiah 40-66 as a separate work from Isaiah 1-39, with its own distinctive theology. On this, see Erwin I. J. Rosenthal, "The Study of the Bible in Medieval Judaism," in The Cambridge History of the Bible: vol. 2, From the Fathers to the Reformation, ed. G.W.H. Lampe (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1969), pp. 267-68, and Levenson, Hebrew Bible, pp. 66-70. Given his involvement in critical biblical study, incidentally, it is odd that Heschel did not reckon with the substantial evidence, already developed by the time he wrote, that Isaiah 56-66 came from a Third Isaiah. 51. See Levenson, Hebrew Bible, pp. 10-15.</page><page sequence="19">RELIGIOUS AFFIRMATION AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM 43 Instead of addressing this large question at the interface of historical criticism and Jewish religious affirmation, Heschel concentrates on developing "an understanding of what it means to think, feel, respond, and act as a prophet."52 This is a huge task, to be sure, and one in which he made an innovative and enduring contribution, but to undertake it is in no way an answer to the formidable challenge that historical criticism poses to a traditionalist religious posture. Given his negative and simplistic view of historical criticism of the Bible (on which he nonetheless relies heavily), we should not be surprised that Heschel fails to address theological issues that arise out of a modem, critical reading of the prophets. By this I refer to a reading that attends carefully to the large differences in the theologies of the several prophets and not only to the differences in the immediate geopolitical and social situations they faced or in their individual temperaments. He might, to give just one example, have focused on the importance of David and Zion traditions in Isaiah and of Exodus- Covenant traditions in Jeremiah, noting the absence of the other prophet's emphasis in each discussion. In the process, Heschel would have given us a sharper image of the distinctive theology of each prophetic book and the sources within it, whereas now the thinking and experience of all the prophets tend to run together in a blur. "The intention of the prophets was to be understood not in one way, on one level," wrote Heschel, "but in many ways, on many levels, according to the situation in which we find ourselves."53 By paying close attention to the distinctive voice in each prophetic collection, as recovered through critical study, Heschel could have given his readers even more ways of understanding the prophets and access to even more levels on which the 52. The Prophets, p. xi. The relevance of this to contemporary religious life is, however, a more vexed problem and one of which Heschel seems unaware. The effort to make the prophets into spiritual exempla, though of high antiquity, is in substantial tension with the phenomenon of book religion and is especially problematic for rabbinic Judaism, since the latter tends to see prophecy as pass6 in certain important ways. The general point has been well put by Brevard S. Childs, Introduction to the Old Testament as Scripture (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1979), p. 589: "The authority of the biblical text does not rest on a capacity to match original experiences, rather on the claim which the canonical text makes on every subsequent generation of hearers." 53.

And by treating the complex but richly suggestive issues of redaction history, he could have addressed a level that his single-minded concentration on subjective experience misses, a level of tradition not constituted by the intention or subjectivity of any individual prophet. So doing, he might even have helped uncover yet another facet of the shiv'im panim la-torah, the seventy facets of the Torah, of which the Jewish tradition speaks. V In conclusion, Abraham Joshua Heschel, as an interpreter of the Bible, is best viewed as a profound spiritual writer who was possessed of a keen sensitivity to certain biblical themes, especially in the prophets, and of some awareness of the reconceptualization of the prophetic corpus brought about by historical criticism. His goal was to develop insight into the psychology of the prophetic experience that would not fall prey to the naturalistic and anthropocentric reductionism of so many psychological treatments of religious themes. In his work on the Bible, as in all his writing, Heschel's goal was to awaken modem people to the God who, in his view, never ceases to search for them and whom they need more than they realize. Though Heschel's work on the Bible does not fall into the category of traditional (i.e., premodern) Jewish exegesis or homiletics, his involvement with biblical studies in the distinctively modem mode is minimal and serves only to protect him from the charge of uncritical traditionalism. It does not present him with new theological insights or compel him to deal with passages that run counter to his own religious sensibility. A man with a profound religious affirmation and a product of historical-critical training, Heschel failed to correlate the two in a coherent fashion or to even to acknowledge the tension between them in a way that was fair to both.
