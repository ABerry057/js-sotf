The University of South Carolina pub- lishes the series called "Personalities of the Old Testament," in which Steussy's vol- ume is the eighth, and Oxford University Press will soon release what may be con- sidered a companion to McKenzie's book, King Josiah of Judah by Marvin A. Sweeney. The advantage of biography is that it can encompass literary, historical, and archeological information, uniting them holistically around the focal point of a biblical figure, or as holistically as the author chooses. As a heuristic device, bib- lical biography may serve well even if the subject of the biography is fictional, or suspected of being so. (The "Personalities" series has volumes on Noah, Jonah, Esther and Daniel, hardly the most "historical" of characters.) When it comes to David, suspicions about his fictionality are at an all-time high. While the historic- ity of Abraham has been in doubt for some time, it was, until recently, axiomatic that one could speak with confidence about the early history of the Israelite monar- chy and could draw on the books of Samuel and Kings as primary sources, or at least as containing remnants of primary sources for the period of the united monar- chy. Now that confidence has been shaken; the very existence of a united monar- chy is being questioned by some scholars, especially the "minimalists," who see its "primary sources" (the Deuteronomistic History) as a fabrication from the Per- sian or Hellenistic period.' A battle currently rages among historians of ancient Is- rael between the minimalists and their opponents (not all of whom are "maximal- ists") about the antiquity and the reliability of the Deuteronomistic History as a historical source.2 Remarkably little of this battle intrudes into the books by McKenzie and Steussy, although both authors acknowledge its presence on the academic scene. Steussy is concerned not with history but with literature. She is interested not in the historical David but in the Bible's portraits of David. In this she conforms to the goal of the series in which her book appears, which examines biblical person- alities not to "learn ancient history. .. or to discover models for ethical action" but in order to see what "light they throw on the imagining of the deity in biblical times" (viii). The study of the Bible's religious outlook is the goal, and the means is literary exegesis of the biblical text. While Steussy does not have to wrestle with the question of the historical ac- curacy of the biblical material, she does not ignore the dating of the texts she exam- ines: Samuel, Psalms, and Chronicles. She summarizes quite intelligently the range of dates attributed by various scholars (including the minimalists) to all her biblical material, never deciding which dates to accept. Then she makes a subtle move, typ- ical of literary approaches. Instead of belaboring the issue of when the texts were ac- 1. See G. N.

Mayes (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), 376-402. 2. The names prominent among the minimalists are Philip Davies, Niels Lemche, Thomas Thompson, and Keith Whitelam.

The material on David, 1 Samuel 16-1 Kings 1, presents itself as connected to the Deuteronomistic History, whether or not it was written as part of it; Chronicles reads as though it is to be associated with Ezra-Nehemiah whether or not it had the same author. Both Chronicles and Psalms, being in the Ketuvim sec- tion of the canon, align themselves with late biblical writings. Steussy notes that the "literary matrices of our three major David portraits each suggest a horizon for in- terpretation" (p. 24). Psalms and Chronicles, Steussy says, "draw our attention to the life of the Second Temple community, thus inviting us to interpret David as part of that community's history" while Samuel contains "little to make us look beyond David's own lifetime" (no matter when it was written-p. 24, and cf. 194-96). Samuel's account is more realistic while Chronicles and Psalms are more imagina- tive and idealized. This is an observation about the literary nature of these writings, not about their accuracy or their distance from the events they recount. But it is easy to see why many scholars take the "realistic" material in Samuel as being more "his- torical" than the imaginative material in Psalms and Chronicles. The clues that most scholars take as pointing to signs of dating the compositions, Steussy takes as liter- ary markers of the claim the text makes on the reader, regardless of when they were actually written. "When I use these horizons in interpretation," says Steussy, "I do so as a response to the reading cues offered in the texts, not as a claim about com- positional dates" (p. 24).3 This approach is "literary-critical" in that it seeks to dis- tinguish texts on the basis of their genre, style, and position in the canon. I stress the point because at times it may appear that Steussy employs standard source criticism, but that is not her intention. Steussy's broad time horizon works well for her purpose of helping the mod- em reader understand David's relationship with God, and ultimately the reader's relationship with God. This a-chronistic approach (or what I think of as source- critical agnosticism) is still favored by many modem literary scholars of the Bible, and has always been favored by traditional faith communities. It makes the Bible timeless-unbound by chronological constraints-such that every reader in every period can find his or her meaning in it. Literary scholars like this because it breaks free of the notion that the text has just one meaning. The text comes to have many meanings and the meaning is as much a product of the reader as of the author. Tra- ditional communities like it because it lets every generation connect with the Bible, making the Bible its own. On the other hand, biblical scholars of the historical per- suasion have always sought the "original meaning" or the meaning for the first au- dience. Increasingly, though, both historians and literary interpreters are interest- ed in reading the Bible in light of its ideology. In order to discern its ideology, we 3. This is trickier than it sounds. Take the book of Ruth as an example. Ruth tells us that it is a story from the period of Judges, and culminates in the genealogy of David. It seems to be telling the reader: "Read me as a prologue to the story of David." But it is not part of the Deuteronomistic Histo- ry. Its location in Ketuvim suggests that it belongs to the context of the postexilic community. As such, it becomes part of the idealized portrait of David from this period. Dating Ruth by this literary feature corresponds to the date ascribed by most scholars on other grounds. Whether such literary dating works in all cases is unclear; one can never break free completely of the hermeneutic circle in which we date a text by what we think it is saying while at the same time we interpret it to fit the date we assign to it. 113</page><page sequence="4">AJS Review need to know the context-the social and political location-from which the text emerged.4 This is another way of saying that many biblicists are still interested in the "original meaning" or the "intent of the author"-an idea that is acceptable once again if couched in the postmodern admission that there is not one correct meaning for all time. In fact, uncovering the ideology of the text is where literary and historical readings converge nicely. Enter McKenzie. McKenzie, unlike Steussy, is searching for the historical David. As if reversing the words of the editor of the "Personalities" series, McKen- zie states that "We will read the Bible not for its model of David as a religious hero nor for the artistry of its story about him, but for the historical information about him that it may provide" (p. 5). Right from the start McKenzie confronts the ques- tion: "Was there a King David?" He reviews the epigraphic and archeological data and readily admits that they do not prove incontrovertibly that David was a histori- cal person. All we know of David comes from the Bible.5 If so, why assume that David actually existed? Because, according to McKenzie, the David stories in Samuel are an apologia, propaganda in defense of David. They are a cover-up in- tended to justify David's actions. No one would construct a cover-up unless there were things to be covered up. In McKenzie's words, "Who would invent such alle- gations against David just to try to explain them away?" (p. 35). "The fact that the author felt the need to try to explain the motives behind David's deeds indicates that those deeds were widely believed to have occurred" (p. 186). This, then, becomes the most compelling reason to conclude that David was a historical figure and that the stories about him bear some relationship to actual events. That the David stories are apologetic is not a new idea, but McKenzie de- velops it in a thoroughgoing and convincing way.6 In order to get to the "real" his- tory of David, he must strip away the apologetics and uncover what it sought to hide. This is done by interpreting the biblical text, and it is at this point that the projects of McKenzie and Steussy coincide, because they are both constructing portraits of David based on their interpretations of the biblical text. McKenzie's David is ambitious and ruthless. David did what many men have done to gain, consolidate, and protect their political power. He tried to usurp the kingship from Saul and he is implicated in the murders of Nabal, Saul, Abner, and Ishbaal. He even had his own sons Amnon and Absalom killed when it looked like 4. The same hermeneutic circle is present here, for one can never escape it. 5. This is not a new position, as McKenzie makes clear. The only new extra-biblical factor, noted by both McKenzie and Steussy, is the phrase byt dwd on a recently discovered Aramaic inscription from Tel Dan, dated to around 800 BCE. Most scholars take this as a reference to the Davidic dynasty or the kingdom of Judah. Interpretations range from considering the inscription as proof of the existence of a historical David to reading the word dwd as something other than David's name, to taking the in- scription as a forgery. 6. For earlier readings of the David story as an apologia see P. K. McCarter, "The Apology of David," Journal of Biblical Literature 99 (1980): 489-504; J. VanderKam, "Davidic Complicity in the Deaths of Abner and Eshbaal: A Historical and Redactional Study," Journal of Biblical Literature 99 (1980): 521-539. The "apologetic" reading has become a commonplace, especially given the current tendency to analyze literature in terms of its political ideology. Cf., for example, P. K. McCarter, I Samuel (Anchor Bible, Garden City, NJ: Doubleday, 1984), 120 and passim, and Marc Z. Brettler, The Creation of History in Ancient Israel (London and New York: Routledge, 1995), 91-111. 114</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews they were becoming a threat to his kingship. This portrait is less flattering than the one the Bible presumably tried to convey, and more radical than most readers would like. While McKenzie knows he can't prove it, he maintains that it is cer- tainly plausible. And so it is-it offers one scenario, although perhaps not the only one, that makes sense of the material. The David that Steussy finds in Samuel is somewhat, but not altogether, dif- ferent. He is "more worldly-wise, more fallible, and conspicuously less pious than our first overview led us to expect" (p. 70). Steussy is not looking for a unified reading of the material, so it is not unexpected that she finds a mixed portrait David, with both positive and negative images. She begins by accepting the common per- ceptions of David but then problematizes many of them. She too implicates David in the murder of Abner, noting that the narrator protests David's innocence too much (p. 57), and of Ishbaal. She too does not take the Abigail story at face val- ue, but interprets it differently from McKenzie (a negative picture of Abigail emerges from Steussy's reading). Some of these similarities in interpretation should make us wonder how clever we are when we discover "hidden secrets" about David's actions. Just how hidden are they? Were we meant to see them all along? If the defense of David is so transparent, how good a defense is it? The books by Steussy and McKenzie are thoroughly researched and clearly written, and accessible to students and non-specialists. Both authors are well- informed and sophisticated readers, and their interpretations of many passages are models of exegesis. While each book stands solidly in its own right as a contribu- tion to the study of the Bible, reading the two together is beneficial because each problematizes the approach of the other. McKenzie's argument is more powerful because it is more focused and unified. He identifies the David material in Samuel as apologetic, and interprets all of it in that light. He privileges the Deuteronomistic History, which he views as being as close to the historical David as we can get (p. 36; he accepts the standard source-critical position on its composition), and consequently has relatively little to say about Chronicles and Psalms, which he per- ceives as more distant in time and less accurate. (Actually, of course, the Chroni- cler is just as much a historiographer as the Deuteronomistic historian, but since his work derives from the Deuteronomistic History and his ideology is more obvious, his "objectivity" as a historian is taken less seriously.) Steussy's approach is more diffuse and more encompassing, and is not dependent on a particular position re- garding the composition of the Deuteronomistic History or its purpose. She also has some interesting things to say about the book of Psalms as a coherent work, reflecting its own view of the history of Israel-a parallel ideology of David, as it were, to the material in Samuel and Chronicles.' When McKenzie and Steussy agree in their interpretations of a passage, we can feel pretty confident that we have the best that modem interpretation has to offer. When they disagree, we realize that biblical interpretation is an art, not a science. 7. See also A.

This work is not listed in Steussy's bibliogra- phy. 115</page><page sequence="6">AJS Review The art of interpreting the Bible for its historical information has been fine- ly honed by Baruch Halpern. Of the three books reviewed here, Halpern's is the most recent, the longest (twice as long as the others), the most erudite, the most ambitious in scope, the most intricately argued, and the most daring. McKenzie's goal is to reveal the historical David, Steussy's is to describe how the Bible presents David, and Halpern's goal is to reconstruct the early history of the Israelite monar- chy and, concomitantly, to argue against the minimalist position that the David sto- ry was fabricated several centuries after his putative life. Halpern, too, reads the sto- ry as an apology, and considers David to have been a "serial murderer" (p. 100), suspected of involvement in the deaths of Nabal, Saul and his sons at Gilboa, Ish- baal, Abner, Saul's other descendants, Amnon, Absalom, Amasa, and Uriah. David possibly instigated the rape of Tamar (p. 87). But Halpern, who has the longest list of possible murders, is more subtle than McKenzie in his disposition of these ac- cusations. Whereas McKenzie tends to imply that David was guilty of the crimes for which the apology clears him, Halpern suggests that the apology was necessary because David was thought to have been implicated in these crimes, whether or not he did them. Halpern finds him guilty of some, but not of all. The one murder that the apology clearly holds David accountable for is Uri- ah's, and this fact is troubling if the David and Bathsheba story is read as part of an apology for David. McKenzie is at something of a loss as to what to do with the sto- ry, so he suggests that it was added after the completion of the Deuteronomistic apology. Halpern is much more clever in his explanation, partly, I suspect, because he works hard to show that the David story was written no later than the time of Solomon, so to have such a crucial part of it as a late addition would undermine his position. Why, then, would an apology include such a damning episode? Because, according to Halpern, it makes clear that Solomon was David's son, therefore, he could not possibly be Uriah's. To get at the truth behind the apology, just flip it over; "Historians ... can invert the obvious implications of textual data" (p. 100). Halpern proposes that Solomon was, indeed, Uriah's son-that the first heir to the Davidic dynasty and the builder of the Temple was not a child of David but a usurp- er. Furthermore, parts of the apology of David were meant to justify Solomon's tak- ing of the throne. Halpern supports this daring proposal with other evidence, but whether it will be widely accepted remains to be seen. Because his scope is broader, Halpern goes beyond David's personal history and takes in the entire sweep of early monarchic history. (Halpern's reconstruction of historical events is too long and complex to be addressed substantively in this re- view.) As a writer of history, he brings to bear on his reconstruction all the evidence at his disposal, including archeology, ancient near eastern inscriptions, chronolo- gy, and geography (as opposed to McKenzie and Steussy, who do not look beyond the Bible). Halpern's knowledge is impressive and his conclusions are at times eye- opening. For example, after an intense and closely argued analysis of 2 Samuel 8, Halpern concludes that it is equivalent, in form, style, and purpose, to the display in- scriptions familiar from Assyria that glorify the feats of kings. This chapter, and oth- er sources from which the final text is composed, are, according to Halpern, more or less contemporaneous with the events they describe, and they do, indeed, reflect ac- tual historical events, but sometimes the sequence of events has been changed, or oth- 116</page><page sequence="7">Book Reviews er liberties taken with the facts, in order to achieve their purpose of making David look good. This approach might be called post-Albrightean (Halpern was a student of Frank M. Cross, who was a student of Albright). Halpern employs the same type of evidence that Albrighteans did, and takes the evidence just as seriously. His stance to- wards the biblical text is similar in that he views it as authentic-ancient and reliable (in Halpern's sense of"reliable")-but he interprets the text more skeptically and less literally. It is Albright with the "hermeneutics of suspicion." As Halpern says in a de- liciously oxymoronic line, "We know that Samuel is accurate because it is nothing but lies" (p. 100). Halpern's point is that the existence of an apology for David proves the existence of David. Moreover, such an apology could only have been written close to the time that the issues it addresses were current, during David's lifetime or shortly thereafter. If one were to fabricate a story of a national icon, or rewrite it centuries af- ter his death, it would not look like the cover-up in Samuel; it would be an unam- biguous encomium (more in the mold of Chronicles). This is a compelling argument against those who deny any credibility to the biblical evidence, and to the history that can be extracted from this evidence. Halpern's book has a lot to offer about Israelite history, Israelite historiography, and our own writing of the history of Israel. David is the star of biblical narrative. There is more information about him than about any other biblical figure, and there are probably more studies of David than of anyone else in the Bible. Now there are three more, and the fascination with David does not abate. All this interest is due to the public relations genius who au- thored the David story, and whose promotional efforts have been successful for three millennia.
