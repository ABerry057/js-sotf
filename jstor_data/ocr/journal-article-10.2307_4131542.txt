Detroit, MI: Wayne State University Press, 2002. 232 pp. Our Lives are but Stories is a welcome and appealing addition to the small but valuable corpus of studies of Jewish women whose ethnic heritages, as much as their Judaism, shape their life experiences and their narratives telling of those experiences. Joining books such as Lisa Gilad's Ginger and Salt: Yemeni Jewish Women in an Israeli Town (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1989); Jael Silliman's Jewish Portraits, Indian Frames: Women's Narratives from a Diaspora of Hope (Hanover, NH: University Press of New England, 2001); Joelle Bahloul's Le Culte de la Table Dresske: Rites et Traditions de la Table Juive Algerienne (Paris: A. M. Metaili&amp;: Diffusion, Presses universitaires de France, 1983); Rachel Simon's Change Within Tradition Among Jewish Women in Libya (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1992); and my own Women As Ritual Experts: The Religious Lives of Elderly Jewish Women in Jerusalem (New York: Oxford University Press 1992), Schely-Newman's Our Lives are but Stories makes a substantial contribu- tion to the study of Jewish women of Asia and North Africa. Structured around the narratives of four women, each of whom is identified by name, and with each of whom Schely-Newman is well-acquainted over a peri- od of many years (one of the women is her mother), Our Lives are But Stories fol- lows the normative life-cycle of Tunisian-born Jewish women from childhood, through marriage, motherhood, immigration to Israel, and old age. Schely-Newman notes that the storytelling style of Tunisian women has shifted: Whereas in Tunisia women's stories tended to be fictional, her interviewees now tell "real" stories of their own lives and of the lives of their neighbors and kin. The goal of women's storytelling, however, has not changed. "These personal nar- ratives continue to serve as an enculturation tool, and though the narrators are mod- est in their demeanor and traditional in their views, their narratives are nevertheless pregnant with sexual meanings and symbolism. Within the context of changing cultures, personal narratives can be interpreted as subversive. The women may ex- plicitly support the hegemonical patriarchal structure of society, while their stories and narration may at the same time challenge and even reject the same social or- der" (p. 18). Throughout the volume, Schely-Newman emphasizes not only the content of the stories, but also their form and the contexts in which they are told. Tunisian women's stories are not recited in the format of soliloquies or lengthy speeches, but rather in short phrases embedded in conversation with the group of listeners, who also are expected to add their own voices of assent, repetition, clarification, modification, free association, or disagreement. As such, the stories both reflect the women's culture and create it through the process of dialogue. Presenting the stories in dialogue form allows Schely-Newman to avoid reifying these women, each of whom emerges as a complex character whose life has been made up of both grand events (such as immigration) and small events (such as baking bread). Significantly, the grand events sometimes are related through little reminisces (such as buying an outfit for one's toddler), while the seemingly small events take on great importance in, for instance, a story linking a 386</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Sabbath bread-baking incident to a critique of men whose cruelty to their wives can result in loss of life (pp. 93-94). Still, as Schely-Newman emphasizes, "The older women do not attempt to change power relations between genders or to redefine their sphere of activity. In- stead, they use narration as a way of preserving their autonomy in matters of pro- creation" (p. 96). And again, "The women's stories are thus not an account of what has happened, good or bad, but a metacomment on the social order. By voicing their concerns women set an example for their daughters about ways of resistance within the traditional setting itself" (p. 150). Ostensibly, this book is more about language and storytelling than an ethno- graphic account of the lives of Tunisian-Israeli women. As such, it should be of in- terest to readers concerned with questions of gender and narrative, as much if not more than to readers looking for information about the experiences of North African Jewish women. Having said that, I do feel that this volume will be of most use to readers seeking to understand a generation of Jewish women whose lives have been framed by decades of radically changing gender roles and expectations. Thus, I would have been interested in hearing Schely-Newman's thoughts on how the daughters and granddaughters of these women (the younger generation for whom these women's stories "set an example") hear what the older women say. I also would have been interested in Schely-Newman's reflections concerning ways in which the Tunisian- Israeli women not only resemble the Moroccan, Yemenite, and Kurdish women whose lives have been described in the books listed in the first paragraph of this review, but also her insights regarding ways in which they may differ. The Tunisian women, for instance, went to school, unlike the women studied by Gilad and my- self. What does their (albeit sketchy) literacy mean in their lives, and what does it mean in terms of their storytelling? The Tunisian women asked to see what Schely- Newman would write about them. How did they respond? Did they offer a meta- commentary on her metacommentary of their metacommentary? All in all, Our Lives are but Stories is an accessible and interesting book and should make an excellent addition to reading lists of courses on women and cul- ture, women and narrative, gender and the life cycle, Jews of Israel or of North Africa, and Jewish women.
