<plain_text><page sequence="1">David M. Gitlitz. Secrecy and Deceit: The Religion of the Crypto-Jews. Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1996. xvi, 677 pp. David Gitlitz undertook a gargantuan enterprise in writing this book, an attempt to document and describe the religious and social customs of the conversos. He did not limit himself chronologically or geographically, dealing with both Iberia and the New World, presumably in order to cover the subject to the greatest possible extent, both of time and place. This approach has its advantages and its disadvantages. On one hand, information about more than one community or phenomenon enlarges the perspective, particularly since scholars in the field tend to center on specific periods and locales. On the other hand, the result is somewhat distracting and eclectic; in addition, it is very hard for the author not to generalize, although he is well aware of the pitfalls involved. One must point out that Gitlitz pored over an impressive array of bibli- ographic material; the original archival research appears to be the work of scholars of many ilks and from many countries. He devoted his energies to organizing this material: the first and shorter portion of the book is an historical introduction, while the bulk of the 677-page tome deals with religious customs. In the historical portion, additional explanations and/or bibliographic references might have been helpful. When the term "new-Christians" first appears (p. 8), Gitlitz does not mention the fact that conversos was the accepted term in Spain for the converts, and that "New Christian" only came into use in the mid-fifteenth century. His attempt to explain the conduct of the Spanish monarchs is anachronistic: "They were not rabid anti-Semites in the Hitlerian mold [emphasis added]" (p. 17). The statement that the Inquisition's policy of not naming witnesses "hampered any serious defense" (p. 20) is not precise. One must admit that defense attempts to provide character witnesses were inherently doomed to failure (a defendant proved to be a good Catholic</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 271 could also have been a serious judaizer). However, the system of tachas (disqualifying witnesses for the prosecution by proving their unreliability and/or substantiating suspicions of a motive to perjure) was widely used and at times succeeded in undermining the prosecution. When Gitlitz writes that the judges were not consistent over the years (p. 22), he needs to explain the whys and wherefores to substantiate this assertion. Gitlitz says that the judaizers "invented strategies for acknowledging each other" (p. 39) but provides no examples. He writes that between 1540 and 1580, "crypto-Judaism was taking its definitive shape" (p. 43), but why then, and where, in Spain or in Portugal? I am not sure that crypto-Judaism ever had a "definitive shape"! Moreover, as tempting as it may be to make the fast of Esther the classic crypto-Jewish observance, the real determining factors were location and time. For example, none of the women tried in Toledo between 1492 and 1520 observed this fast. I also wonder why Gitlitz relied upon Kamen for his numbers rather than the statistical studies of Henningsen and colleagues. When discussing why the Spanish emigres often chose to go to Portugal, he neglects to mention that many already had family ties there, as well as the significant danger factor involved in going elsewhere; the risks involved in a trip overland could not compare to the perils of a sea voyage. In addition, when comparing the nature of the Spanish and Portuguese converts, Gitlitz almost writes off the very large group of fourteenth-century conversos with the phrase "except for the blocks of forced converts . . . most conversos converted willingly" (p. 50). Nevertheless, he expresses a clear understanding of the complexities of the topic, and aims for a delicate balance in dealing with conversos, the Inquisition, and Iberian Jewish history. In the second portion of the book, Gitlitz's choice of sources is sometimes disappointing. This applies, for example, to his quoting of rabbinic opinions or documents from secondary sources or from the Encyclopaedia Judaica, as occurs seven times in his chapter on death customs. His reference to oto haish (p. 139) should include the talmudic source, as should his descriptions of avodah zara (p. 146). When discussing ritual and prayer, Gitlitz refers to communal prayer as occurring on the Sabbath and festivals and occasionally daily (p. 443) rather than explaining that the norm was to attend the morning service, in particular on Mondays and Thursdays when there was a Torah reading, and, if possible, to return for the afternoon-evening service as well. He also calls the mezuman a prayer, whereas it is an invitation (or introduction) prior to the prayer (p. 485).</page><page sequence="3">272 BOOK REVIEWS At times, Gitlitz tries to summarize and categorize phenomena. This should be especially helpful for the uninitiated, yet the reader is never quite sure how to digest the large quantity of material presented, or whether one may dare to draw clear-cut conclusions from so much variegated data. Sometimes there is no smooth transition from one period to another, as in the discussion of proselytizing, which jumps from the fifteenth to the seventeenth century (p. 231), perhaps due to a lack of material for the interim period. Rather than discuss each chapter, I will make a few comments on passages or statements that stand out in my mind. The discussion of messianic claimants fails to mention David Reubeni (p. 109). It is not clear why fortune-telling aids are included (p. 185), and I likewise wonder how the odd description from Mexico of the eating of human flesh (p. 206) could possibly be treated as judaizing. The discussion of marital problems such as levirate marriage would have been enriched by references to the rabbinic responsa literature; even S. Assaf's classic article in Me'assef Zion (5, 1933) would have sufficed. Sometimes Gitlitz describes customs without naming them, such as descristianizar ("routinely scrubbed off holy oil after baptism," p. 148) and the barbillera (tieing up the jaws of the deceased, p. 284). He writes that "it is likely that some conversos were given a Jewish burial" (p. 291) but provides no proof of this contention. The claim that most crypto-Jews fasted before the Sabbath seems to be based on the research of one single scholar (p. 322), and I am also not certain that it is true that "Sabbath observance among later generations was so routine that investigators rarely pumped for details" (p. 330). The discussion of fasts on Mondays and Thursdays does not mention the well-known messianic movement in Extremadura at the beginning of the sixteenth century, when In6s of Herrera emphasized precisely this activity as incumbent upon conversos awaiting salvation and passage to the Holy Land! A statement such as "prayers related to hand washing and to eating ... were part of almost every crypto-Jew's routine" (p. 450) makes me wonder. Did the women wash their hands, or are we only counting the men in a nonexistent post-Expulsion quorum as crypto-Jews? The explanation accompanying the discussion of food and dietary laws is glaringly modem, claiming that when Jews are surrounded by gentiles, and "where assimilation is possible or even encouraged by the majority society, it is always easier for Jews not to keep the dietary laws than to keep them" (p. 531); somehow this does not seem relevant to the case at hand. Yet many of Gitlitz's descriptions and assessments are quite relevant.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 273 There are good examples of syncretism in the chapter on the belief system. The discussion of books is very interesting, as is the short but sweet chapter on oaths. The attempt to describe changes in modes of worship adds a nice touch (p. 460), and his attempt to categorize types of conversos in the chapter on conversion is distinctively creative. I do not agree with his conclusions regarding the partially assimilated (p. 569), for going to mass and keeping the dietary laws was par for the course for the crypto-Jew and not necessarily a sign of assimilation. Gitlitz highlights the complex problems related to families, the pressures and difficulty in keeping them together, and concludes that "for most conversos gradual assimilation into Christian identity was the norm" (p. 579); there is no doubt, as he states, that the Inquisition destroyed the foundations of trust (p. 596). At the very end, I found his final paragraph to be a bit surprising in light of the contents of the book, though perhaps appropriate for a scholar of Golden Age literature. While the specialist in the field may have some bones to pick with the author, the novice will find a fair assessment of converso customs and psychology. As has been indicated, a wealth of material is included in this work, and the bibliography is most useful. Renee Levine Melammed Seminary of Judaic Studies Jerusalem, Israel</page></plain_text>
