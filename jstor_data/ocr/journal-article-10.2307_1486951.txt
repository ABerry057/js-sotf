New Haven: Yale University Press, 1990. xvi, 368 pp. The author, who is professor of religion at Barnard College, refers to himself as a humanist and a believing Jew (p. 281). He has written an important book on the apostle Paul that seeks to recover a first-century Jew from the tangle of Christian theological portraits of the apostle. Contempor- ary studies of the phenomenon of conversion are central to the argument. Segal insists that Paul was not a speculative thinker who sought to formu- late a consistent theological foundation for a new Jewish sect that had formed around the memory of Jesus of Nazareth. Nor was he the architect of Christianity's separation from Judaism. Once Paul was read by a Chris- tian church that was largely Gentile and no longer tempted to return to Torah observance, then Paul's letters might be understood as speculative accounts of the human condition. Segal's primary dialogue is not with standard Christian theological interpretations of Paul, but with the liberal Christian understanding of Paul that has developed from the work of Krister Stendahl, a Lutheran who is now Distinguished Professor at Brandeis University. This view, which emerged from the Christian-Jewish dialogue, holds that Paul was not con- verted to a new religion but called by God to evangelize the Gentiles. They find God in Christ, but the Jewish community remains bound to its original covenant as the source of salvation.</page><page sequence="2">292 BOOK REVIEWS Segal insists that this interpretation is false to the data in Paul's letters. Though Christianity was a Jewish sect and not a separate religious phe- nomenon in the first century C.E., Paul's letters show that he was "convert- ed" from his allegiance to the Pharisaic understanding of Torah. The mechanism of this conversion must be understood in the context of first- century C.E. apocalyptic mystical speculation. Paul had a vision in which he came to identify the risen Jesus with a heavenly angelic embodiment of God's glory. Segal takes the transformation language in Paul's letters quite literally: the believer "in Christ" has exchanged the earthly body for a new spiritual one (e.g., pp. 37, 67). This literalism does not cohere with those texts in which Paul clearly speaks of the earthly body as marked by suffering and awaiting its future transformation (e.g., Phil. 3:12-21). Both Paul's own mission and the incorporation of Gentiles into Jewish Christian communities must be understood against the background of the divergent positions in Judaism with regard to the conversion of Gentiles. Those like Philo, who had assimilated much of Greco-Roman culture, were unlikely to proselytize. Jewish leaders were aware of the tensions that full conversion by Gentiles might create and encouraged them to remain as sym- pathetic "God-fearers" (p. 94). But as comparative modern data indicate, less acculturated believers will seek converts (pp. 85-90). As a Pharisee, Paul knew that the Law required more explicit and detailed obedience than his Jewish Christian opponents practiced. Consequently, he persistently accused them of requiring the Gentiles to be circumcised but not practicing what they preached (e.g., Gal. 2:11-14, 6:12-13; see pp. 144-146). In their eyes, however, Paul was an apostate. Segal treats Paul's discussions of the Law as the justification for shifting from one community to another (Gal. 3:6-14). In order to make this case, Paul used Pharisaic modes of interpretation but discovered contradictions between passages in Scripture that any Jewish reader would reject (e.g., Deut. 27:26, Hab. 2:4; see p. 119). Contrary to the ecumenical Christian reading, Paul does not hold that the Law remains the way of salvation for Jews (or Jewish Christians). The place of the Torah has been changed for all (Gal. 2:15-16). This account of Paul's understanding of community depends upon distinguishing Paul's Pharisaic convictions from those of other Jews. Had Paul not been a Pharisee, he could have become a Christian without a conversion that required radical transformation in the conditions of community membership. He could have required Gentiles to observe Jewish customs or to remain God-fearers in the new Christian sect (p. 147). One of the weaknesses of Segal's reconstruction is the circular argument.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 293 Paul is an important figure in Jewish studies of the first century C.E. because his letters provide us with first-hand evidence for the piety of an apocalyptic mystic and a first-century Pharisee. Yet reconstruction of both belief sys- tems is intertwined with the account of Paul's disputes over the Law with Christian opponents. Paul was constrained to set aside the ceremonial laws which separated Jews and Gentiles. In some instances, Paul may have been willing to compromise his convictions in order to preserve unity with Gen- tiles in the Christian movement. This view leads Segal to his most controver- sial reading of Paul, the claim that Romans 7 refers to Paul's vacillating behavior in regard to kosher observance. 1 Corinthians 9:22 is pressed into service to indicate that Paul did submit to the requirements of the Torah in that regard among Jews. While this interpretation preserves Paul's adher- ence to the ethical Law and his claim that the Law is holy, it fails to explain why Paul speaks of the Law generally as exploited by the flesh to lead one into sin. Elsewhere, when Paul is concerned with food regulations, he is quite explicit (e.g., 1 Cor. 8:7-13, Rom 14:1-23). Though Segal's assertions about Paul's Pharisaic convictions are based on circular evidence and his reading of Romans 7 is unpersuasive, his insis- tence that much of Paul's theology is really an attempt to work out pragma- tic solutions to the problem of including Jews and Gentiles in one Christian community makes sense. The apocalyptic elements in Paul's thought lead him to insist upon the need for a single community of the righteous. They also lead him to treat all opposition as Satanic (2 Cor. 11:13-15; see pp. 156-164). Apocalyptic symbolism provides the foundations for community solidarity that Torah observance provided for other groups. For students of Christian origins, this book is a major challenge to their perceptions of the Jewish Paul. Jewish readers will find Segal's Paul as much an odd footnote in their history.
