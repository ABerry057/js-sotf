We would like to take this opportunity to thank our predecessors, Elisheva Carle bach and Robert Goldenberg, for their outstanding stewardship and commitment to excellence. We will seek to continue on this path to ensure that the journal main tains its reputation for scholarship of the highest quality. We also want to thank Professor Miriam Bodian, the current Book Review Editor, for her Herculean efforts to ensure that books relevant to Jewish Studies are reviewed promptly. We look forward to continuing to work with her. We are deeply grateful to the hard-working AJS staff, headed by Executive Director Rona Sheramy, and the journal's dedicated Managing Editor Stanley Mirvis without whom the transition would not have been so uncomplicated. Their labors keep the day-to-day operations of the journal running smoothly and make it possible for the AJS Review to appear on schedule. *** The AJS Review will continue to publish scholarly work that reflects the wide range of interests and cutting-edge research of the AJS membership. Ultimately, of course, this cannot be accomplished by the editors alone. We need scholars working in every area of Jewish Studies to consider AJS Review as their journal and to submit their work. The recent survey of areas of research covered by our members reveals that this is a dynamic and exciting era in Jewish Studies scholar ship. We are witnessing new approaches to traditional fields such as rabbinics and Jewish history, as well as the integration of entirely new fields such as media studies, music, art history, visual culture, and more. As editors, we want to include the best work in all of these approaches and fields in the journal. To achieve this goal, we will rely on you. We ask you to submit your finest work, to answer our requests to referee articles submitted to the journal, and to suggest and review books your colleagues should know about. Without you, our work will not be possible. Even as we continue to adhere to the high standards of our predecessors, we will introduce new features, from new visual presentation of the journal to forums and exchanges. We hope not only to highlight the finest scholarship in Jewish Studies but also to grace the journal's cover with representative samples from holdings relevant to Jewish Studies in various libraries, archives, and museums. We welcome your suggestions and contributions, and we will deeply appreciate your help in the years ahead. Christine Hayes and Magda Teter 185</page></plain_text>
