Oxford University Press, 2001. xvi, 306 pp. 316</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Since the publication of the first Qumran scrolls more than half a century ago, the schematic 364 day solar year of Jubilees has been posited as a major is- sue in the schism of the Qumran community from mainstream Judaism. She- maryahu Talmon was among the pioneers in assessing the impact of this calendar upon the life of the Qumran community, as best illustrated by the Yom Kippur con- frontation with the Wicked Priest who came to suppress the sect's observance of the fast on a date in conflict with the prevalent lunar calendar. Talmon's thesis is that the sect, like the author of Jubilees, viewed the observation of the moon as leading to corruption of the ideal 364 day calendar in which the holidays and all dates were perpetually fixed to particular days of the week. Whether and how the sect made correction for the annual deficit of one and one quarter days is not known, but presumably they had only disdain for the arbitrary methods of lunar intercalation. With the publication of Qumran calendrical texts now nearing completion, it is natural to ask how this thesis holds up in the light of new Cave 4 fragments. Fortunately, we have two recent Oxford volumes which are relevant to this ques- tion. One is the official publication of calendrical texts from Cave 4 as volume XXI in the Discoveries in the Judaean Desert (DJD) series. The other is a broad histo- ry of the Jewish calendar from the second century BCE to medieval times by Sacha Stern. As to the first volume, it is gratifying to note that Talmon, assisted by J. Ben- Dov, is its primary editor, thus testifying to his continued active contribution to Scroll scholarship. Here he publishes seventeen fragmentary calendar documents, almost all of the mishmarot type, that is, using the rotations of the twenty-four priestly courses listed in Chronicles for dating festivals and other events in a six- year cycle of the Qumran calendar. Uwe Glessmer edits fragments of a schedule of daily prayers to be recited sequentially during a month. This schedule, as noted by Glessmer, may have important bearing on the rabbinic liturgy. Ben-Dov is the editor of a fragment of a longer cycle of 294 years-6 jubilees of 49 years-in which every period of three years is identified by its sign, the name of the priest- ly course serving during the first week of the period. In his general introduction to the volume, Talmon restates his premise that the Qumran calendar shared the antilunar position of the book of Jubilees. The Damascus Document, one of the foundational works of the community, does in- deed make reference to the chronological system of the Book of Jubilees, and as Talmon demonstrated long ago, the mishmarot lists of annual festivals on fixed days of the week presuppose the schematic 364-day solar calendar. However, as il- lustrated by the early astronomical Book of Enoch, not all proponents of the 364- day year were oblivious to the need for synchronization with the lunar calendar. In fact, in this volume, Talmon, himself, publishes 4Q320, which "is intended to achieve a concordance of the divergent 354-day lunar year with this 'ideal' ephemeris" (p. 33). 4Q321 designates two days in each solar month, one around the middle of the lunar month with the obscure designation duqah, and the other not named (Talmon designates it X), around the end of the month. The nature of these two days is still the subject of much conjecture among scholars. Michael Wise deduces from another Qumran text that duqah refers to the full moon, while 317</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews the X day was probably the day of its last visibility. Talmon and Israel Knohl have suggested that duqah was the night after the full moon when it begins to wane, and that X was the last day of the lunar month. In his opinion the purpose of recording these days inclining toward lunar darkness was to warn the members of the sect about the sinister influence of the moon. This baleful lunar hypothesis contrasts sharply with 4Q503, a Qumran litur- gical text which sets forth prayers to be recited daily in accordance with the vary- ing portions of light and darkness in the moon, a method of measuring lunation also described in Enoch. As I had occasion to point out in 1986, 4Q503 shows that lunar observation or calculation was used for liturgical purposes at Qumran, de- spite the antilunar polemics of Jubilees. In his learned but noncommittal evalua- tion of the evidence (The Dead Sea Scrolls after Fifty Years, pp. 213-278), Uwe Glessmer maintained that the moon and "lots of darkness" occur only in passages reconstructed by the editor. This is not quite accurate, as one can verify by look- ing at the phrase puin rnbu visible on plate XLI frg. 39 of M. Baillet's edition. Thus, with regard to 4Q321, it seems more plausible to suppose that the two days designated each month were intended for synchronization with the lunar cal- endar rather than as a warning against it. This option appears to be recognized by Talmon (p. 36) as at least a possibility once a comprehensive study of the entire Qumran calendrical corpus is completed. The theme of Stern's challenging history of the Jewish calendar is that Jew- ish calendar reckoning in antiquity was characterized by its diversity. Using mod- em astronomical tables for the visibility of the new moon in different parts of the ancient world, Stern analyzes specific Jewish dates recorded in various sources from the late Roman period. From a ketubah from Egypt in 417 CE, dated to the 20th of Kislev, it is inferable that Passover, 14 Nisan started on March 17. The ver- nal equinox that year was on March 19, but Stern notes that contemporary reck- onings of the equinox were all later than March 19 or 20. So it appears that this Passover was not in accord with the rabbinic rule that the 15th of Nisan cannot pre- cede the tequfah (b. Rosh ha-Shanah 21 a). Stern suggests that the Jews in Egypt made their own calendrical determinations, as did other Diaspora communities. But even in southern Palestine, the fifth-century tombstone inscriptions from Zoar seem to indicate that the rabbinic rule of the equinox was not followed. Moreover, Stern is of the opinion that whereas various Amoraic calendrical rules were grad- ually formulated, the present-day form of the fixed rabbinic calendar emerged only in the Geonic period. The medieval tradition that Hillel the Patriarch instituted it in the 4th century is not supported by any talmudic evidence. Based on his thesis that festivals could be observed even in late antiquity on totally different dates from one Jewish community to the next, it is interesting to see how this affects Stern's evaluation of the efforts by communal authorities to in- stitute uniformity in earlier periods. With regard to the Qumran solar calendar, he tends to cast doubt on its significance as a cause of sectarian schism. He specu- lates that it might have been intended only as an idealistic model and not really put into practice. The polemics in communal texts against those who go astray with re- gard to the festivals, he argues, may refer not to their dates, but to the manner of celebrating them. He admits that the Yom Kippur confrontation described in the 318</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews Habakukpesher and highlighted by Talmon (see above) gets close to evidence for solar sectarianism, but even here he points to other interpretations, more conge- nial to his theme of coexistent diversity: "If the Teacher of Righteousness and the Wicked Priest were both observing, for instance, a calendar based on sightings of the new moon, then on this occasion they may simply have sighted the new moon on different days" (p. 17). This speculative suggestion sounds very much like a retrojection of the fa- mous confrontation between R. Gamliel, the Nasi, and R. Joshua over the new moon and the proper date for Yom Kippur, recorded in Mishnah Rosh ha-Shanah. Although I have argued previously that the schematic solar calendar, so laboriously tabulated at Qumran, does not preclude lunar synchronization, Stem's interpreta- tion strikes me as a dubious effort to turn the plate upside down. General readers, who often shy away from the technicalities of calendar reck- oning, should be assured that Stern's volume is not only very clearly written; it is a challenging and exciting foray into the links between the measurement of time and a millennium of Jewish social history.
