New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000. xiv, 748 pp. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years serves as a kind of handbook for the study of the synagogue in antiquity. It discusses every major site, every ma- jor text and most major issues and secondary sources. It is indeed a worthy suc- cessor to Samuel Krauss' Synagogale Altertiimer (Berlin and Vienna), published in 1922. Comparison of this volume with that of Krauss shows the intention of each author to be inclusive of all that was known about the synagogue in an en- cyclopedic fashion. This comparison also shows how much more we know of the ancient synagogue than Krauss did. This is crudely expressed by sheer number of pages in each volume. While Krauss produced a book of 470 pages in length, Levine's magnum opus is a whopping 748 pages. Archaeological discoveries in Is- rael and the Mediterranean basin, as well as texts discovered or published (most significantly from the Cairo Genizah) have greatly increased our sources for the history of the synagogue. In addition, new methods for the study of ancient Ju- daism, its literature, and its material culture have facilitated a complete rethinking of the history of the synagogue. Unlike Krauss' important volume, however, Levine's work has a very spe- cific thesis. Levine, who for purposes of due disclosure it should be noted served as my dissertation advisor, argues that the synagogue's "primary importance throughout antiquity was as a communal center" that was "fundamentally con- trolled and operated by the local community" (p. 3). While there was great diver- sity amongst ancient synagogues, "the institution exhibited a remarkable unity as well" (p. 3). Levine sees continuity in "the range of activities and types of reli- gious functions conducted therein, as well as orientation, ornamentation, symbol- ism, and sanctity, were in varying degrees common to synagogues throughout an- tiquity," and is expressed in both literary and archaeological sources" (p. 4). With the destruction of the Temple, Levine argues, the synagogue "evolved" greatly, particularly in its religious aspect. "The synagogue had become-according to Rabbi Isaac, borrowing a phrase from the prophet Ezekiel (11:16)-a miqdash me at, a 'lesser' or 'diminished' holiness" (p. 4). Levine attributes this transfor- mation "first and foremost" to internal Jewish developments, but "no less impor- tant" to the "evolving" Empire-wide social contexts in which the synagogue func- tioned, and particularly to growing Christian influences. The remainder of the volume is dedicated to fleshing out this thesis, which in general terms reflects the current consensus of scholars that Levine has done so much to form and inform. The book is divided into two parts and nineteen chap- ters. Part I, "The Historical Development of the Synagogue," includes: "Origins," "Pre-70 Judaea," "The Pre-70 Diaspora," "The Second Temple Synagogue-Its Role and Functions," "Late Roman Palestine," "Byzantine Palestine," and "Dias- pora Synagogues." The chapter on synagogue origins reflects well the structure of the book. Levine is cautious to represent all major primary evidence and scholarly positions on this and indeed on every issue in the book, positing also his own interpretation. 112</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews On this question of synagogue origins, Levine believes that the Biblical city-gate was the forerunner of the synagogue. The synagogue at Gamla is a bridge for Levine between the Biblical city gate and the later synagogue, as Gamla was con- structed near the gate (p. 34). Levine considers this to be a "fortuitous indication of a synagogue setting continuing the earlier city-gate tradition." While this is by no means the last word on a very opaque subject, Levine's theory certainly pro- vides food for thought. A book of this breadth is bound to include interpretations that scholars in the field might not find to their liking. I am not satisfied, for example, by Levine's interpretation of Tosefta Sukkah 4:6, the description of the great "double stoa" of Alexandria. Levine considers this text to reflect closely a synagogue building and community that existed in late-first-century Alexandria. To my mind, this text is reflective of a Second Temple period synagogue, and in at best a very general way. There was surely at least one large synagogue in Alexandria, and this text may reflect real knowledge of a large synagogue there. The text that stands be- fore us, however, has been molded by Tannaitic conceptions, reflecting aggadic and halakhic motifs that are well documented in Tannaitic literature. The Tannaim used Temple motifs in "constructing" this fantastic description of the Alex- andrian synagogue. The immediate purpose of this text is to exemplify the "glo- ry" of Alexandrian Jewry and its synagogue. The use of Temple forms in this text was undoubtedly stimulated by the developing use of Temple imagery within their own synagogues. While I am not in any way committed to the notion that Rabbinic sources cannot be used to illustrate the first century (an approach that is often taken to extreme), it has long been my contention that this text is best seen as a projection of Tannaitic values upon a distant, apparently destroyed, syn- agogue. The second part of the volume, "The Synagogue as Institution" includes chapters on "The Building," "The Communal Dimension," "Leadership," "The Patriarch (Nasi) and the Synagogue," "The Sages and the Synagogue," "Women in the Synagogue," "Priests," "Liturgy," "Iconography: The Limits of Interpre- tation," and, finally, "Diachronic and Synchronic Dimensions-the Synagogue in Context." Many of the themes that Levine discusses here have been the sub- ject of his own preliminary specialized studies, though in the current volume one may sense continued reflection. Levine's discussions here supersede his earlier articles. The chapter on iconography, a subject that Levine has not pre- viously discussed in a sustained manner, is mainly descriptive of current re- search. Lee Levine's The Synagogue is a truly monumental undertaking. It is des- tined to be the standard handbook on the ancient synagogue and its history.
