Hanover, NH: Brandeis University Press/University Press of New England, 2003. xix, 226 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S036400940700075X The first impression that this handsome volume gives the reader is of an album celebrating synagogue architecture and design. However, a closer examin ation reveals something a great deal more interesting. Hubka, a professor of archi tecture at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, has produced an astonishingly detailed study of a single synagogue following its rededication in 1731?the wooden synagogue that stood in Gwozdiec, a small town in present-day Ukraine. His aim is to identify the different cultural elements that went into its con struction and design in order to understand how this most typical of Jewish build ings functioned in the context of a small town in the deep southeast of what was then the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In order to achieve this ambitious goal, he adopts a multidisciplinary approach combining research in historical architecture, social history and the history of culture?popular and elite, written and iconographie, Jewish and Polish. This he does true to his vision that the syna gogue combined within it elements drawn not only from Jewish tradition but also from the cultural vernacular of its surroundings. Perhaps the most astonishing aspect of this study on the material culture of early modem Polish Jewry is that its subject?the wooden synagogue of Gwozdiec?no longer exists, having been destroyed during the Holocaust. This in no way deters Hubka from pursuing an in-depth investigation of the building, as it, like many other wooden synagogues, was the subject of research and documen tation by Jewish and non-Jewish scholars in the prewar years. Thanks to their work, an extensive portfolio of pictures, plans, and diagrams can be compiled from materials in various archives and museums (including the Tel Aviv Museum of Art). These serve as Hubka's primary source material, allowing him to elicit remark able details. Much of this material is presented in high-quality reproductions, allow ing the reader to assess for him- or herself the merits of much of Hubka's thesis. If the pictorial sources are of a high standard, the same cannot be said of the documentary materials on which the study is based. Gwozdiec was a small town with a Jewish community of some 150-250 people that presumably has left few traces in the historical record. The Polish archival sources on the community's growth and development in the eighteenth century that are used in the research seem sparse indeed. Hubka presents no documentary materials dealing with the community's decision to build its synagogue in the seventeenth century (the date of its initial construction remains unknown) and to remodel it in the eight eenth. Even his assertion that the owners of the town?the noble Kalinowski family?gave financial and material support to the synagogue's remodeling is backed up by secondary sources alone (35, 54, 179). Sources of Jewish prove nance are equally scarce. We have no community pinkas from Gwozdiec nor any direct references to the synagogue building in rabbinic literature, so we can only guess what the Jews of that time and place thought of it. This presents a problem for Hubka, who is concerned with demonstrating just how well the 409</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews synagogue integrated into the warp and woof of its contemporary society, Jewish and non-Jewish. However, the reader is left with an uneasy sense that much of the argumentation is not as well backed up as it should be, and the author's basic vision is not invalidated, namely, that the synagogue represented a hybrid form of building that functioned naturally in both its Jewish and non-Jewish environ ments through its "vernacular design method." This is elucidated in the third chapter on the synagogue's architecture, in which Hubka not only provides a highly detailed picture of the synagogue but also places it within two building traditions: that of synagogue architecture and that of eastern European wooden architecture (which was, of course, largely non-Jewish). It is in this chapter that the author's comparative methodology really comes into its own. Surviving pictures and plans allow parallels of form and style to be clearly identified despite the lack of documentary evidence. Gwoz diec, Hubka claims, combined typical synagogue features?east-west directional axis, placement and design oibimah and ark, highly decorated walls, vaulted ceil ings, and an impressive multitiered roof (this last was most typical of the wooden synagogues)?with highly idiosyncratic elements, including a square rather than rectangular floor plan (part of the prayer space's conceptually cubic shape), a very narrow viewing slit for the women, and an astonishing cupola added to the vaulted ceiling in the eighteenth century, designed to give the interior the feeling of a tent. Hubka explains these aspects largely in terms of the designers' desire to conform to various zoharic strictures concerning synagogues, with the cupola intended to symbolize the biblical Tent of the Tabernacle. This proposition of a zoharic design scheme, is, however, contradicted by his supposition concerning the actual building of the synagogue. Hubka writes, "it seems only remotely possible that Jewish architects, designers, or builders played any central role in the creation of the Gwozdiec synagogue or similar syna gogues in the region" (47). He does not explain which non-Jewish architects, builders, or designers would have been able to incorporate so many features drawn from the Zohar. On the other hand, the idea that non-Jewish builders and designers played a central role in constmcting the building is borne out by the par allels that Hubka draws to non-Jewish architecture and building techniques in eighteenth-century Ukraine. These were many and varied, from the log-walls, the use of shingles, and the structure supporting the roof (though this was modified following the addition of the cupola) to the tiered roof itself. In addition, he points to the extensive use of vaults and cupolas in masonry church buildings as a poss ible influence for the adoption of such baroque elements in the Gwozdiec synago gue. All these features meant that it formed a clearly recognizable part of the eastern European architectural landscape. Once again, however, Hubka is careful to point out the features that were unique to the Gwozdiec synagogue?and others of its type. Thus, although tiered roofs were a common building feature in the region, complex tiering of three or more layers seems to have marked out the wooden synagogues from their surroundings. Furthermore, in comparison with church buildings, which often had highly decorated exteriors, the exterior of the synagogue was largely unadorned. Hubka ascribes this fact to a conscious attempt to avoid the negative 410</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews attention that ostentatious Jewish architecture might have brought in a non-Jewish environment.1 However, in this regard, he also points to what seems a significant phenomenon: Though the law stipulated that a synagogue could not be any higher than the local Catholic church, a comparison of the different buildings in Gwoz diec shows, in Hubka's words, that "if the height of the church bell towers is dis counted, synagogue roofs were generally taller than those of equivalent-sized churches." Fear of attracting hostile reaction from Christian society does not seem to have prevented the Jewish community from building a massive and highly distinctive house of worship that would have been one of the most easily recognizable buildings in a small town such as Gwozdiec. Probably the most distinctive feature of the building, as of many of the wooden synagogues in Ukraine, was its highly decorated interior. The synago gue's walls and ceiling were almost completely covered with frescos and other painted decorations, including geometric designs, portrayals of animals, and other details drawn from nature, as well as boxes framed various Hebrew texts. Having shown the latter in pictures and provided an appendix with a full English translation of the Hebrew texts (though unfortunately not the texts them selves), Hubka is at pains to identify their sources. Though two of the Jewish artists identified themselves in Hebrew texts painted on the walls, Hubka has no primary source material on which to rely in identifying their sources and can only base himself on suppositions. As far as the pictures are concerned, Hubka offers a range of texts drawn from the Zohar that describe various forms of wildlife in order to argue that it is this fun damental work of Jewish mysticism that served as their inspiration. He could very well be right, but he is unable to provide any more proof than a similarity between the words written in the thirteenth century and the pictures painted in the eighteenth. At an early stage in the study, the author argues that "in essence, the interior was informed by Jewish culture while the exterior was influenced by non-Jewish, regional cultures" (23). In line with this division, he devotes relatively little space to examining possible non-Jewish influences on the painted interior. For example, Hubka makes no attempt to compare the synagogue's decorations with local church frescos, even though he offers a pertinent photograph of the wall paintings from the seventeenth century wooden church in Debno, not far from Gwozdiec. It is a shame that no further details are given of this possible?and potentially very suggestive?comparison. In fact, the interior/exterior model of Jewish cultural development adopted by Hubka in the foregoing quotation has now been largely replaced by a view of Jewish culture that integrates elements from Jewish and non-Jewish traditions into a unified hybrid whole. This phenomenon is, in fact, wonderfully demon strated in the final chapter, in which the author discusses the eighteenth-century remodeling of the synagogue and the addition of the internal cupola. By examin ing the design features that accompanied the remodeling, Hubka shows that 1. He speculates that there might also have been an influence from Islamic/Sephardic traditions of minimum exterior expressions on buildings of worship (50). 411</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews the cupola was clearly meant to give the interior of the building the feeling of a tent. Various texts painted on the walls mention the biblical Tent of the Tabernacle. However, the motifs adopted by the designers clearly copy elements from an Ottoman form of tent, known in Poland from at least the seventeenth century. This is a beautiful example of the way Jews created for themselves a hybrid culture that was at once completely Jewish and still integrated within it elements from the culture of their non-Jewish neighbors. In fact, this vision of Jewish culture as a hybrid stands at the very heart of this fascinating study. Hubka uses the synagogue as metaphor for the ways in which Jewish society in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, while often dis tinctive and separate from general society, was at the same time deeply integrated into it. Though his sources do not always allow him to back up his argumentation in a satisfactory manner, his basic vision is borne out by the pictorial sources he provides. Despite some weaknesses, therefore, this book is a trailblazing study which will open new vistas for future research on Jewish cultural history.
