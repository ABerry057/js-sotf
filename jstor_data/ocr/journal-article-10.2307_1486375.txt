<plain_text><page sequence="1">PAPAL AND ROYAL ATTITUDES TOWARD JEWISH LENDING IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY by KENNETH R. STOW The question of Jewish usury is usually perceived in straightforward terms. The Church unilaterally opposed Jewish lending, and the kings did all they could to promote it. In the long run, however, the utility of Jewish lending diminished, and the forces of the Church were thus able to prevail. The kings, too, soon began to outlaw Jewish lending.' In reality the issue was not only more complicated, but the truth was nearly the reverse of the picture just drawn. Within the Church there were differences of opinion. The canonists and theologians built a theoretical wall which allowed no true interest whatsoever to be taken,2 and certain purists among the prelates demanded that reality conform strictly to this theory. In contrast, the popes explicitly and purposefully condoned and promoted the practice of Jews who lent at a controlled rate of interest. The kings, on the other hand, especially from the later thirteenth century, adopted the posi- tion of the prelate purists. At their own initiative, they set out with deter- 1.

The Attitude of the Papacy Papal legislation on usury first appeared in the twelfth century.3 It was not, however, until 1198 that the question of usury and the Jews was first raised. In a letter to the archbishop of Narbonne,4 Innocent III declared that no usury was to be taken from Crusaders, and any that had been taken was to be returned. The clergy was to pressure Christian lenders into obey- ing this decree, while the princes, in their role as "coactive powers" in the service of the Apostolic See, were to ensure Jewish compliance.5 Seventeen years later, Innocent III reiterated and amplified the prin- ciples of the 1198 letter in the decree on crusading issued at the Fourth Lateran Council, Ad liberandam.6 Besides binding Jews to remit interest, the decree also specified that the actual debts owed by Crusaders were not to be cancelled outright. Rather, along with the interest, their payment was postponed until the return of the Crusader home. Another canon issued by Innocent III at the Fourth Lateran Council, Quanto amplius, referred to borrowers in general. It declared that Jews were obligated to remit solely "immoderate impositions" (de immoderato gravamine), not all interest, as was the case with Crusaders. And, further, while it did not expressly allow any interest to be taken, it nevertheless pro- 3. See the general discussion of churchmen and their economic views in J. W.

From 1198 to 1215, the span of his pontificate, Innocent divided those who borrowed from Jews into two groups: Crusaders, who were privileged with moratoria on the principal of their loans and the remission of interest paid before their departure, and all other Christians, who were protected against only "immoderate usury" (immoderatas usuras.) Moderate interest, by implication, was considered thoroughly acceptable. Even Crusaders were eventually liable to pay it. This policy was continued by Innocent III's successors. In Aragon in 1228, at the Council of Narbonne in 1227, and, once more, at the Council of Beziers in 1246, papal legates reaffirmed the acceptability of moderate interest. As the presiding officials at the two councils, the archbishops of Narbonne, Peter III and then William de la Brou, duly noted, it was the legates who initiated the following decree: Because the Jews severely oppress Christians by the exaction of usury, and since usury has been universally forbidden by the Lord, we have caused it to be decreed by the Council that Jews shall never receive any immoderate usury (usuras).8 Had the present negative wording of the concluding phrase been replaced by a positive formulation-Jews may receive only moderate inter- est (interesse)-the decree would leave no doubt as to papal intentions.9 Usury begins where moderate interest leaves off. And, this is clearly what the Narbonne-Beziers decree, with its roots squarely in Quanto amplius, is supposed to mean. It was true usury which the popes prohibited, not a reasonable rate of return. 7. X. 5, 19, 18. See too, Grayzel, XIIIth Century, p. 306, and the comments of McLaughlin, "Teachings," p. 99 and Nelson, Idea, p. 16. The latter raise the issue of the inconsistency between practice and canonistic theory, and they do refer to Quanto amplius. But they never ask that which is a fundamental question of this essay, namely, was the implied permission of Quanto amplius to accept moderate interest the result of a consciously followed policy based on clearly defined principles. On the contrary, McLaughlin and Nelson both indicate that the inconsistencies between the usury canons were determined by the exigencies of the moment. 8. See Grayzel, p. 317 (Mansi, 23: 21) and p. 332 (Mansi, 23: 701), for the French Councils and Y. F. Baer, Die Juden im christlichen Spanien, 2 vols. (Berlin, 1936), 1: 147, for the Aragonese text. 9. See below for the reason why the popes preferred the negative terminology.</page><page sequence="4">164 KENNETH R. STOW This interpretation of papal decrees and canons gains support from numerous letters which the popes drafted to deal with practical situations. In these letters, Innocent III, for example, frequently reiterated the special borrowing privileges of Crusaders, but he never once hinted that non- Crusaders too should benefit from such favors.' The popes also stressed the restrictive side of Crusader benefits. Gregory IX reminded the French clergy that the rule of restitution was valid only for interest collected before the departure of the Crusader. Otherwise, the pope stipulated on two separate occasions: "Those who are at present unable to pay their debts to Jews shall not incur the burden of usury until such time as their death or return is definitely known... " Gregory further took care to distinguish between the eventual right of the Jews to collect interest from Crusaders and the absolute prohibition against collecting which Christian lenders had to respect." The popes were also constant in applying the rule of "immoderate inter- est." Innocent III complained of those secular princes who compel Chris- tians to pay "most exorbitant usuries" on debts to Jews, even after the Jews have received back "the principal and more besides," by which he was refer- ring to some normal and acceptable rate of interest in contrast to the "exorbitant" sums demanded by the princes.'2 Honorius III, in response to an inquiry of Blanche of Champagne, chided the prelates who officiated in her territories. Some of them, "not content with the decrees promulgated by this [Fourth Lateran] Council," he noted, "were usurping undue jurisdic- tion over the [Countess's] Jews." Clearly unhappy with the texts of Quanto amplius and Ad liberandam, the clerics were ignoring the decrees and instead trying to force the Jews to return the interest they had received from all 10. Grayzel, Xlllth Century, pp. 132, 134 and 136. 11. Grayzel, Xlllth Century, pp. 180 and 218; cf. the similar wording in the Milbemet miS- vah of Meir b. Simeon, MS Parma 2749, fol. 72v. A related issue is the collection of revenues from Jews who had been "given" to monasteries by their secular lords. (See Aryeh Grabois, "The St. Denis Jews and their Role in the Development of the Monastery," Zion 30 [1965]: 115-19). Some of this money, if not all, derived from interest. Accordingly, in his De regimine ludaeorum, in A. P. D'Entreves, ed. and trans., Aquinas Selected Political Writings (Oxford, 1959), p. 85, Thomas of Aquinas forbade princes to tax Jewish income. Nevertheless, Gregory IX attacked Frederick II (Grayzel, XIIIth Century, p. 192) for withdrawing Jewish revenues from the monks of Mt. Cassino. The dispute was over these revenues alone; whence, Gregory must have been operating on the basis of the theory now being argued that Jewish lending at interest could be legitimate. 12. Grayzel, XIIIth Century, pp. 126-27.</page><page sequence="5">ATTITUDES TOWARD JEWISH LENDING 165 borrowers.13 But, as Bishop Otto of Minden explained in 1270, when the Fourth Lateran Council spoke of "immoderate" interest, it meant that a rate of four dinars per mark per week could be charged.14 It was this, or a similar interpretation, which Honorius insisted on having observed. Needless to say, the popes had no intention of showing partiality to Jews by permitting immoderate interest. What the canons permitted, the Jews should have, but no more. In contrast to his approval of the 20 percent interest rate allowed by James I of Aragon, Gregory IX wrote angrily to the bishop of Palencia that the Jews of that diocese do not fear "to extort immoderate usury." He repeated this charge more specifically in a letter to the archbishop of Compostella, complaining that Jews were taking "exor- bitant usury from Christians in spite of the decree [Quanto amplius] of the General Council."'5 Apart from excesses, the only other reason invoked by the popes for can- celling interest due to Jews appears to have been that of physical danger to the Jews themselves. In 1233, Gregory IX issued a letter to the French hierarchy demanding an immediate halt to the torture and kidnapping which borrowers seeking to extricate themselves from the debts they owed to Jews were then perpetrating. Gregory could have tried to end the crisis simply by reminding the clergy that violence was forbidden and that con- tracts must be honored. But, beyond the rapine, which he condemned, in this instance he had to take into account the fact that the violence had com- menced shortly after Louis IX had outlawed all Jewish lending.'6 In view of the situation, he therefore concluded that it would be more prudent "to observe [all] legitimate contracts and agreements," "with their usury, however, cancelled (usuris omnino cessantibus)." Yet, he prefaced this deci- sion by noting that everything which had transpired "was contrary to the 13. Grayzel, p. 150. 14. Julius Aronius, Regesten zur Geschichte der Juden im Frankischen und Deutschen Reiche (Berlin, 1902), p. 313, no. 741. This rate also appears in Baer, Spanien, 1: 147; and the Milhemet misvah (= MM) of Meir b. Simeon, MS Parma 2749, fol. 71r. It equals 86 2/3 percent, which seems high. The matter needs clarification, especially because Meir b. Simeon does not state the time period for calculating the rate. However, Doc. 109, pp. 170-71 in R. W. Emery, The Jews of Perpignan in the Thirteenth Century (New York, 1959), refers to "ratione libre IV den. per mensem." That equals 20 percent only, which is surely what Meir b. Simeon meant; and per- haps the bishop did too. Cf. n. 35 below for more information on Meir's work. 15. Grayzel, pp. 182 and 207. 16.

STOW contracts into which [the borrowers] had entered."" Only emergencies, such as this, could justify violating the rule that moderate interest must be paid as contractually specified. Valuable information on the permissibility of moderate interest is pro- vided by late thirteenth century notarial records from Perpignan which reflect on legal proceedings involving Jews who were charged with writing contracts calling for an overly high rate of interest. Time and again, these records suggest that at the end of the proceedings the Jewish lender was never deprived of all his profits. This is especially true in private, out of court settlements. The Christian borrowers must have known that should these cases come to open ecclesiastical court, the judges-who could act against usury only on the basis of a papal writ issued specifically for the occasion-would likely award the Jews some rate of moderate interest, probably the 20 percent normally sanctioned in Aragon and Perpignan at that time.'" In short, for the popes of the thirteenth century, as, incidentally, a letter of Alexander III not concerning Jews, and composed as early as 1163, had once made abundantly clear,'9 the prohibition of immoderate interest meant precisely that. A moderate rate of interest, openly charged, was to be considered the norm, at least as far as Jewish lenders were con- cerned. All this notwithstanding, the fact is that the approach of the popes to Jewish lending differed sharply from that of the canonists. The latter were unswerving in their opposition to interest of any kind and especially to "manifest," or openly paid, interest, which they adjudged unquestionably and invariably usurious.20 The discontinuity between papal practice and canonistic theory is apparent from the editing carried out by the canonists 17. Grayzel, XIIIth Century, p. 200 and cf. pp. 268 and 272 where Innocent IV insists that "legitimate contracts" be fulfilled, obviously with the interest paid. It should be noted that in 1320, John XXII prohibited above principal payments on contracts in Macerata. But here, the contracts contained an obligation to pay the huge hidden interest of 300 percent. See Solomon Grayzel, "References to the Jews in the Correspondence of John XXII," Hebrew Union College Annual 23 (1950-51), pt. 2: 58-59. 18. These cases are discussed in Emery, Perpignan, pp. 88-94. The conclusions for the out of court settlements are mine. It is worth adding that Perpignan was hardly the only place where Jews were tried for usury by Church courts. Each instance must be studied separately to understand the motivation of the prosecution. 19. McLaughlin, "Teachings," p. 99 and McLaughlin's comments therb. Cf. Nelson, Idea, p. 16 and my comments in n. 7 above. 20. This is McLaughlin's central thesis, which has been unfailingly accepted; cf.

In 1210, the letter entered the Compilatio III, the collection of canons commissioned by Innocent III and edited by the papal notary and subdeacon, Peter of Benevento. Known by its incipit, Post miserabilem, the edited canon differed markedly from the original letter. The original applied expressly to Crusaders alone. The edited text shed its restrictive context and applied universally. The Jews were to remit any interest they had taken, and they were to remit it to all their deb- tors. This edited text, moreover, entered the decretals of Gregory IX in 1239, and, so, became in theory the binding law of the Church.21 The canonists were also responsible for the negative phraseology, "never receive immoderate interest [or] usuries," which appears regularly in con- ciliar decrees, as well as in Quanto amplius. Their insistence on such phrase- ology, even when the positive formulation, "may receive moderate interest," which conveyed papal intentions would have clearly been more appropriate, may be understood by examining the way they interpreted Quanto amplius, which, like Post miserabilem, was incorporated into the Decretals. Compar- ing these two canons, the pivotal decretal commentaries of Hostiensis and Raymond of Pennaforte concluded that the prohibition of "immoderate interest" in Quanto amplius must be read as a prohibition of any interest whatsoever.22 Otherwise, Quanto amplius would contradict Post miserabilem irreconcilably. This resolution was arrived at, however, on the basis of purely linguistic considerations. It aims at explaining away a legal crux by the sole device of harmonizing the language of conflicting texts. It is also tendentious, because, had they so chosen, the canonists could have returned to the original Post miserabilem letter which, it will be recalled, applied only to Crusaders. The conflict between the edited Post miserabilem and Quanto amplius would have simply been eliminated. Most of all, the resolution of the canonists avoids the real problem: Why did Innocent III consistently draw a distinction between "immoderate" and "no interest whatsoever" in the first place? The attempt of the canonists to harmonize the texts of 21. See Emil Friedberg, ed., Quinque Compilationes Antiquae (Leipzig, 1882; reprint ed., Graz, 1956), p. 131, for the text; and Emil Friedberg, ed., Corpus luris Canonici (Leipzig, 1879-81), X. 5, 19, 12: Post miserabilem, for the editorial process. 22. See the texts in McLaughlin, p. 99. The canonists asked if the prohibition of "immoder- ate" implied the permission of the opposite, "moderate." It did not, they concluded, because of the blanket prohibition of the edited Post miserabilem. Obviously, this is a word game; the can- onists were expert in the history and fortunes of near contemporary texts, especially those which began as conciliar decrees. Conclusions other than those dealing with the method of the canonists and their theory of usury may be drawn here only with great care.</page><page sequence="8">168 KENNETH R. STOW Quanto amplius and Post miserabilem, therefore, points nowhere except to their pressing need to maintain a rigid theoretical stance in opposition to all openly paid interest. Their zeal for theoretical purity on the subject of usury in fact appears to have led them to try and circumvent certain other canoni- cal exigencies which the popes, who were themselves well trained in the intri- cacies of canon law,23 believed they must respect. The popes were particularly limited by the canonical rigor of the Con- stitutio pro ludaeis, the heading Innocent III had used to preface the bull, Sicut ludaeis.24 This text, soon to enter the Decretals, accorded the Jews the protection of the Church and insisted that there be no innovation in their privileges and good customs. To prohibit usury entirely, contrary to decades of practice, would have violated Sicut. Indeed, by common consent, the "good customs" clause of Sicut was considered nearly sacrosanct.25 Clement IV, for example, had warned in a letter sent in 1266 to James I of Aragon that while the tract which Nahmanides composed following his 1263 dispu- tation at Barcelona with Paul Christian ought to be confiscated, neverthe- less, the privileges otherwise granted the Jews must be left undisturbed. Similarly, Innocent IV conceded that if offending books were to be burned, those Jewish writings free from insult to Christianity might not be pro- scribed.26 The question of Jewish lending at interest could not then be resolved 23. Innocent III studied law at Bologna and Innocent IV's Apparatus on the Decretals is one of the major commentaries on that text. 24. For the text, see Grayzel, XIIIth Century, p. 92; on the merits of Sicut, see Grayzel, "The Papal Bull, Sicut Iudaeis," in Studies and Essays in Honor of A. A. Neuman (Leiden, 1962), pp. 243-80. 25. On the common observance of the Jews' customary rights, see Thomas Aquinas, De Regimine ludaeorum, in A. P. D'Entreves, Aquinas Selected Political Writings, pp. 85-86, where Thomas argues that the defense of customary rights in Sicut precludes novel and arbitrary taxa- tion of Jews, even by the secular princes to whom the Jews were servi camerae. Cf. the remarks of Gregory IX, in Grayzel, XIIIth Century, p. 200, of Innocent IV, in Grayzel, p. 272, and most explicitly of Clement IV, cited in Peter Browe, Die Judenmission im Mittelalter und die Pdpste (Rome, 1942; reprint ed., Rome, 1973), p. 76: "Sed in quantum concessa eis a sede apostolica privilegia patiuntur," thus informing James I of Aragon in 1266 that the papal order given him to censor the Talmud was not to be used as a pretext for abritrary confiscations, etc. Grayzel, however, in "Popes, Jews and Inquisition from 'Sicut' to 'Turbato' " in Essays on the Occasion of the Seventieth Anniversary of the Dropsie University (Philadelphia, 1979), pp. 151-88, now claims that, at most, the popes paid lip service to Sicut, while their other actions negated any potentially positive effects of the bull. Whether this or Grayzel's more optimistic view in his first Sicut article is the more valid one must now be decided. 26. See Browe, Judenmission, p. 76 for Clement IV's letter.

As Gregory IX wrote to the king of Navarre in 1247: The king must not allow his barons to take an oath against the repayment of "honest loans" taken from Jews. Such an oath would violate both the "good cus- toms" of his royal predecessors and "legitimate and canonical regulation" as well-in other words, the "good customs" of both the king and the Jews.27 To be sure, the argument about "good customs" had its limits. Profiting from the labors of the canonists, the papacy, from about 1245, began to claim that it possessed direct jurisdiction over certain Jewish customs and practices. In particular, the popes asserted that they were entitled to suspend the observance of those Jewish practices which perverted morality and con- travened Divine Law, namely, the Old Testament Law of Moses. On this basis, they said, the Talmud had been burned at Paris.28 Yet, usury too was "forbidden by the Lord," as the Canon of 1227 at Narbonne had explicitly declared. As such, usury should have been no more acceptable than the offensive passages of the Talmud. Stating in his Summa that the Jews sinned morally through usury, Raymond of Pennaforte was making exactly this point.29 On this ground, it was hardly obligatory to sanction moderate interest rates in order to safeguard the Jews' canonical privileges. Nonetheless, the papal justification of Jewish lending activities was indeed based in no small measure on the need to preserve the rightful canon- ical privilege of the Jews. And, as will be seen, this justification was both legitimate and consonant with the accepted economic norms of the Church. It also had the strength to overcome the objection that Jewish lending was a moral sin. But, beyond that, the popes consented to the practice of allowing moderate interest because, unlike the pure theoreticians, they had no alter- native. They simply had to confront reality, which, in the thirteenth century, they had sufficient institutional maturity to do.3 27. Grayzel, p. 272. "Honest loans" is a transparent euphemism for interest bearing loans, as its context makes obvious. 28. See this point in Amos Funkenstein, "Changes in Patterns of Christian Anti-Jewish Polemic in the Twelfth Century" (Hebrew), Zion 33 (1968): 125-44 and a revised English ver- sion, "Basic Types of Anti-Christian Polemics in the Late Middle Ages," Viator 2 (1971): 373-82. 29.

Needless to say, the works on this subject are legion. See Ullmann's notes for references.</page><page sequence="10">170 KENNETH R. STOW One particularly vexing problem that demanded the adjustment of theory to the exigencies of reality was that of oaths. Loan contracts invari- ably contained oaths registering borrowers to fulfill the obligations they had undertaken, including the obligation to pay interest. These oaths were unbreachable, and when the Church sought to have certain classes of bor- rowers, in particular Crusaders, released from their oaths, its only recourse was to appeal, if sometimes threateningly, to the lenders. They alone could absolve those who were obligated to them.3' Were the lenders to refuse, the quixotic situation pictured in the canon Debitores32 was bound to arise. A product of early usury legislation and issued under uncertain circum- stances by Alexander III, Debitores has two distinct parts. The first orders that the oaths which obligate borrowers to repay interest must be observed. The second directs ecclesiastical and secular authorities to ensure that the lender gives the manifest interest he thus receives back to the borrower. This was hardly a workable procedure, which is why various papal letters stressed the need to have borrowers freed from their oaths. The real function of Debitores, therefore, was to point to the type of difficulty in which theoretical purity might have to be made compatible with actual fact. The problem specified by Debitores was even more difficult when the lender was a Jew. For some reason, the Church was not anxious, and may in fact have felt unable, to press the Jews to release borrowers from their oaths. In 1247, for instance, Gregory IX wrote to the king of Navarre that oaths against the repayment of "honest loans" [made by Jews, and obviously in contradiction to oaths requiring payment] were forbidden.33 The 1233 letter cited above also emphasized the need "to observe legitimate contracts and agreements."34 Most pointedly, the original 1198 Post miserabilem letter and the Fourth Lateran canon, Ad liberandam, both call on Christian lenders to absolve their debtors from the oaths they had taken. But these two texts are silent with respect to the oaths taken in favor of Jews. This attitude is con- 31. On the dissolution of such oaths, see McLaughlin, pp. 15-16. 32. X. 2, 24, 6, and see Baldwin's comments, Masters, p. 273. The canonists also had to deal with ab illo (C.14, q. 4, c.12), also known as the Ambrosian exception, which permitted the tak- ing of usury from enemies, and which, to be sure, they claimed (e.g., Raymond of Pennaforte and Hostiensis, cited in McLaughlin, pp. 138-39 and cf. the complete summary of opinions presented by Marquardus de Susannis, De ludaeis et aliis Infidelibus [Venice, 1558], pt. 1, chap. 11, pars. 3-6) in no way applied to Jews receiving interest of any kind from Christians. 33. Grayzel, Xlllth Century, p. 272. 34. Grayzel, p. 200.</page><page sequence="11">ATTITUDES TOWARD JEWISH LENDING 171 firmed by Meir b. Simeon in his Milbemet misvah (ca. 1270).35 As one of his arguments for the validity of Jewish loan contracts, he propounds that the pope, even in his role as the Vicar of Christ, may not annul oaths.36 Oaths, then, were an obstacle when it came to dealing with Jewish lend- ing. But, if that was so, the fact that Jewish lending almost invariably fell into the category of notorious usury because of its undisguised nature posed a difficulty that was insurmountable. There was no way to sanction such usury canonically. To demand its cessation, however, would have required the use of force, and as the popes knew, and the kings would soon discover, force was ultimately powerless against lending and the taking of interest. Indeed, the ultimate difficulty the popes had to grapple with in the case of Jewish lending was the simple impossibility of eliminating it without elimi- nating the Jews themselves. This was a solution that no pope was ready to consider. The popes were thus forced to adopt a compromise. Excessive interest could be acceptable under no circumstances, nor could the failure to remit interest to Crusaders ever be sanctioned. Here, it was necessary to depend on the effectiveness of coercive measures to ensure obedience, if only for the lack of an alternative. The case of moderate interest was, however, signifi- cantly different. Both borrowers and lenders appear to have accommodated themselves to the fact of moderate interest. As the records of lending at Perpignan attest, such interest was regularly paid, whether as the result of a simple contractual obligation, an amicable out of court settlement, or per- haps even a court order. A consensus must have existed that moderate interest produced a fair return, enabling lenders to continue their work, or at least survive, and, at the same time, protecting borrowers from exploita- tion. But this situation suited papal needs perfectly. It respected the right of the Jews to live within Christendom and maintain their legitimate customs, 35. Milhemet misvah (M.M.), MS Parma 2749.

Robert Chazan has translated portions of this tract in a number of articles, e.g., "A Jewish Plaint to St. Louis," Hebrew Union College Annual 45 (1974): 287-306. A Jewish appreciation of Christian teachings on usury may also be seen in the polemic, Sefer Yosef Ha-meqanne, ed. Judah Rosenthal (Jerusalem, 1970), esp. p. 32, where the Bishop of Sens insists on the return of the principal of a loan which had been disguised as a business partnership, together with a reasonable profit. In this case, the Jew had avoided taking manifest interest. 36. M.M, fol. 228v.</page><page sequence="12">172 KENNETH R. STOW and it also precluded the attainment of Jewish superiority over Christians through economic exploitation, the central reason for the regulation of specifically Jewish lending practices in the first place. In the absence of such exploitation, moreover, there was no need to charge Jews with immoral acts or with the corruption of Mosaic Law. The strictures of Raymond of Pen- naforte could be safely and conveniently forgotten. In this light, as well as in the light of the other difficulties just discussed, the popes must have concluded that there was not only very little hope of suppressing moderate interest, but that there was very little to be gained by doing so. Accordingly, decrees against Jews accepting such interest were never issued. Still the popes were not so quick to abandon theoretical integrity. For one thing, to permit interest openly and formally was out of the question. For another, the popes wanted it known unmistakably that there was a definite limit to the interest rate which would be tolerated in practice. Once surpassed, ecclesiastical censure would be swift in forthcom- ing. Therefore, in theoretical expressions, the popes astutely elected to accept the negative formulations and terminology of the canonists, in par- ticular, the use of the terms "immoderate" and "usury." In practice, they intended "moderate interest" to be benignly overlooked. So too, because of their general inviolability, although not because of their immediate pur- pose, the oaths calling for the payment of interest were to be enforced. This compromise solution to the problem of Jewish lending was, of course, rooted in the pragmatic, but it must not be seen as purely that. It brought together, after all, extremely diverse issues. It thus clearly derived from a fundamental principle of Canon Law, the achievement of "harmony from dissonance,""37 a principle illustrated vividly by none other than Sicut ludaeis with its balance of the permissible and the prohibited in order to justify Jewish residence in Christian lands. To be sure, one might argue that in the case of Jewish lending the harmonization proceeded more from thir- teenth century realities than did the realities from the harmonization. But, then, just this ability to align theory and practice was a hallmark of at least the most influential of thirteenth century popes, Innocent III.38 37.

Most well known is his decision concerning the prohibition on business dealings with idolators three days prior to and after their feast days (B.T. 'Avodah Zarah 2a).

In the thirteenth century especially, the canonists were primarily academicians, professors of law, who had to keep theoretical considerations before themselves at all times, in their scholarly commentaries in particular. Not that they operated in a climate divorced from reality. Indeed, John Gilchrist has cogently argued that the canonists were realistic when it came to economics.39 Ray- mond de Roover and J. W. Baldwin too40 have proposed that churchmen were well aware of and encouraged such matters as open competition. They also elaborated doctrines like that of the just price in order to promote and not stagnate economic life. Most important, the canonists defined thirteen categories of transactions in which profits that were barely distinguishable from interest were considered fully justifiable.4' With all this in mind, Gil- christ has concluded that the prohibition of interest was intended to apply directly only to manifest usury, that is, to the kind of interest taken by notorious usurers such as pawnbrokers.42 Yet, as noted above, notorious usurers is exactly what the majority of Jewish lenders were, at least in canonical terms. Thus, none of the cate- gories, theories or rationales which were used to acquit Christian lenders of the charge of taking interest could be made applicable to the Jews. Thir- teenth century canonists were so persistent in interpreting "immoderate" as though it were a euphemism for "none at all" for just this reason.43 In the matter of Jewish lending, they could not have made common cause with the popes, even if they had wanted to. Their normal advocacy of economic activities had to give way in the face of stubborn theory. By the fifteenth century, however, legal opinion had come to acknowl- edge the papal policy. No canonist or civilian ever admitted that usury could be directly permitted. But the Common (regnant) Opinion of the lawyers did decree that the pope might dispense with the prohibitions against taking interest. Even better, he might follow a legal fiction (dissimulatio) and suspend the punishment for violating the prohibitions.44 39.

STOW Once it is seen that these fifteenth century lawyers were more often than not practicing jurists, their deviation from pure theory is easily understood. Unlike the canonists of the thirteenth century, whose arguments were heard mostly in the classroom and who could, when necessary, permit themselves the luxury of distinctions of an exquisite character, the lawyers of the fif- teenth century had to deal with reality. Together with the popes, they had to bring the conflicting tendencies within the law itself into a theoretical har- mony, yet in such a way that the law and its underlying principles were made consonant with the exigencies of daily life. This approach would persist well into the seventeenth century. Only in 1682 did the popes close the Jewish loan banks located throughout the Papal State.45 2. The Attitude of the Kings In view of the foregoing, the remark of Meir b. Simeon that the pope allows a fair percentage of interest46 must be taken at face value. Since, moreover, it appears in a letter Meir wished he could have sent to Louis IX, the king of France, the remark is particularly noteworthy.47 Meir's purpose was to point to the sharp distinction between the pope and the king in the matter of interest. If the pope allowed the taking of moderate interest, Louis IX had forbidden the collection of any interest whatsoever. The king, in fact, had done more than that. On occasion his predecessors had ordered In particular, Andreas Siculus, Consilia, 5 vols. (1516), 4: no. 16; Antoninus of Florence, Summa, 3 vols.

Henry III and Edward I of England,so Philip III and Philip IV of France, and, albeit inconsistently, James I of Aragon,5' all tried to limit or halt Jewish lending at one time or another. They were, however, unable to do so, which disquieted nearly everybody, and the issue of lending eventually became a factor leading to the expulsion of the Jews from Eng- land and France.52 Quite obviously, the reasoning followed by the kings in their lending policy was not that of the popes. But, then, papal lending policy did not receive undivided clerical backing either. In conformity to the edited text of Post miserabilem with its absolute prohibition of interest, the 1209 Council of Avignon declared that "Jews should be restrained from the exaction of usury [any interest] . .. in accordance [sic] with the law of the Lord Pope, Innocent III."'3 Papal legates too did not always follow papal wishes. Although its presiding officer was a papal legate, the Council held at Albi in 1254 first renewed the Avignonese canon just cited and then enacted on its own that "no ecclesiastical or secular judge may compel Christians to pay any usury whatsoever to Jews or to any other persons."54 Still, the initiatives which produced such legislation were not necessarily 48.

Whether the on-again off-again usury prohibition of James I of Aragon, who was also attentive to Dominican wants with respect to censorship of the Talmud, public disputations and forced preaching, place him in the same category as Louis IX and Edward I is a moot point. See the texts in Y. F. Baer, Die Juden im christlichen Spanien, 1:148. Philip the Fair, too, established a policy that is not easily grasped. In 1292, he prohibited all usury, an order he repeated in 1299, when he also specified that he was returning to the policy of Louis IX; yet he did agree at those times and again, in 1303, to allow the collection of the principal, at least on nonusurious loans, roughly parallel to the formal position of the canonists.

At the Council of Beziers in 1255-presided over by William de la Brou, the man who had adopted the concept of "immoderate interest" at Beziers in 1246, but who now was having second thoughts-statutes were approved which ordered Jews "to desist from usury, blasphemy and magic"; officials were put on notice to be on guard lest the Jews receive any usury, and a definition was proposed: "By usury we mean anything above the prin- cipal." All of this legislation was proposed in the name of Louis IX.55 The kings were thus playing a conspicuous role in suppressing Jewish lending. This activity is particularly well illustrated if the outcome of the 1213 Council of Paris56 is compared with that of the Council of Beziers just mentioned. In 1213, Philip Augustus was still endorsing Jewish lending. Indeed, at Philip's request, Innocent III had but recently censured the Eng- lish student of Peter the Chanter, and his own Cardinal legate, Robert Courson, for preaching inflammatory anti-usury sermons.57 Courson was also the chief officer at the 1213 Paris Council. It is no wonder then that, wary of provoking the king a second time by challenging him on the subject of the Jews, Courson and the other prelates at the Council refrained from issuing even one canon condemning specifically Jewish usury-even though they issued thirteen other canons against usury in general. In the reign of Louis IX, however, matters changed drastically. The king attacked Jewish lending frontally, and, as at the Council of Beziers, clerics soon began fol- lowing suit. Louis IX was moving toward the same end envisioned by Archbishop Odo of Sully. At a Parisian synod in 1200, the archbishop warned all Chris- tians that they must not engage in commercial activities with Jews, and especially contractual ones.58 Like the popes, Odo had understood that con- tracts meant oaths, and oaths meant the unavoidable payment of interest. The end to all commercial relations with Jews, therefore, was the only way to eliminate interest. Louis IX may not have decreed outright that all com- mercial activities between Jews and Christians be broken off, but by institut- ing proceedings in 1260 to have interest already paid restored to those who paid it, he was doing effectively just that.59 55.

Early in the thirteenth century, Bishop Robert Grosseteste spoke of the oppression of Jewish usury. But the context of his remark was the need to allow Jews to live peacefully within Christendom, if within carefully defined limits.60 Openly identifying himself with the general Jewry policy of the popes, Grosseteste undoubtedly accepted their position on lending too. By usury, therefore, he meant immoderate interest only. In contrast, Stephen Langton, another student of Peter the Chanter, might have been expected to adopt the radical position espoused by other members of the Chanter's circle. Nevertheless, reminiscent of the events of the 1213 Council of Paris, at the Council which met at Oxford in 1222, Langton, then arch- bishop of Canterbury, refrained from broad pronouncements and limited himself solely to demanding that Jews pay tithes on the profits they had acquired through lending (ab interesse).6' Not surprisingly, the king of Eng- land, Henry III, was still giving Jewish lending his full support. Indeed, in 1218, Henry III had warned certain bishops to steer clear of the usury ques- tion, "as the bishops have no concern with our Jews."62 Near the end of his reign, however, and under the influence of his son, the future Edward I, Henry III agreed in 1269 to the statute which prohibit- ed any future loans secured by baronial lands. Edward I, as king, went further, and in the 1275 Statute on the Jews, he outlawed lending com- pletely. It is possible that in 1287 Edward projected a return to a 431/3 per- cent interest rate, reasoning that a controlled rate was preferable to the rates of an exorbitant character which the clandestine lending engendered by the 1275 statute had produced,63 but, notably, the king rejected this plan in favor of a more extreme solution. In a post-1290 document, he justified the expulsion as the only means through which he could insure an end to usury and so "guarantee the honor of God and the well-being of his kingdom."64 He had, he claimed, been obligated to bring a halt to the "heinous offense" and "abasement of our people" caused through lending. With the king pro- fessing sentiments like this, it is no wonder that the Franciscan archbishop of Canterbury in the 1280s John Peckham, could rail "about the devasta- 60. H. R.

STOW tions of usury (de voragine usurarum)" in the same way he insisted on con- versionary sermons and the restriction of the Jews to one synagogue alone in London.65 The shift in royal policies, which brought the kings to take such an active role, if not the initiative itself, in opposing Jewish lending, may be explained by understanding why such terms as "heinous offense" and "well-being of the people" began to appear in royal documents concerning lending. The adoption of these terms suggests that the kings had come to identify with the outlook of those clerics for whom all lending, Jewish or otherwise, was anathema. This outlook is best seen by observing the activities and expressions of Foulques de Neuilly and Robert Courson. Foulques spent the early years of the thirteenth century delivering sermons in which he called for the cancellation of debts to Jews, including their principal amounts.66 Usury, he argued, contained the power to destroy the social fabric. What he meant by this claim may be seen in the nearly utopian significance attached to usury by Robert Courson. In 1213, Courson called on the pope to con- voke a council whose prime function would be to decree that all men must earn their sustenance by the sweat of their brow. Thus would be removed all usurers, all factious men and all robbers; thus would charity flourish and the fabric of the churches again be builded; and thus would all be brought back again to its pristine state.67 In Church circles such utopian language led invariably to the question of the Jews. Were not the Jews, by virtue of their theological status, the con- stant reminder of unfulfilled millennial and utopian yearnings? And were not the Jews, even more so, the symbol of all that was anti-Christian?68 If usury was delaying the arrival of the long-awaited age of Christian bliss, then surely usury had within it an intrinsically Jewish element. This point was made patently at the 1213 Council of Paris. Usurers were declared worse than heretics and accounting schools frequented by Chris- 65. C. T.

In particular, the taking of interest began to be identified with "judaiz- ing," the term used by clerics since the ninth century to characterize the worst of heresies, indeed, as a synonym for heresy itself.71 Such an identifica- tion between judaizing and lending had already been made explicitly by Bernard of Clairvaux in the mid-twelfth century.72 In the thirteenth cen- tury, Peter the Chanter referred to Christian lenders denigratingly by saying: "These are our Jews (Isti iudaei nostri sunt)."73 There also appeared innova- tions such as "Jewish clerks (iudaei clerici)," an obviously cynical designa- tion for clerical lenders.74 But the habit of labeling the unwanted and the disconcerting as judaizing was not the exclusive possession of churchmen. Kings too used the term, especially when they were referring to non-Jewish lenders. The property of these lenders, for example, was regularly confiscated upon their deaths. For, it was said, engaging in the profession of Jews, these Christian lenders too were Jews, at least in the legal sense.7 Most striking, in 1276 Edward I instructed his justices: "To institute proceedings against Christians who judaize by exacting usury on money lent (De inquirendo super Christianis judaizantibus, eo quo pro pecunia usuras extorquent)."76 These examples make it reasonable to assume that the kings, like the radical clergy, had 69.

STOW come to see in lending a potent source of social corruption which had to be extirpated. Lending, in fact, was disturbing to the kings for much the same reasons as it was to the clergy. As the studies of de Lagarde, Strayer and Kantor- owicz have amply shown,77 the later thirteenth century witnessed a grow- ing spiritualization of the notions of crown and kingdom. The kingdom was now evolving into the patria, a quasi-sacred body, and, if so, the stewards of that body, the kings, had to protect it from corruption. The ecclesiastical authorities could, of course, be entrusted with the rooting out of corruption in the realms of theology and ritual. Corruption through notorious lending at interest, judaizing in one of its most pernicious aspects, however, was a matter for kings. Accordingly, Louis IX and Edward I insisted on bringing the fundamental question of whether interest would be at all permitted under direct royal control.78 Such royal interference and especially initiative in deciding the legiti- macy of matters like lending and usury, which had heretofore been left to ecclesiastical regulation, marked a new departure. Kings may have always wanted to see themselves as reformers, but, in the past, that role was one not easily undertaken. In the Carolingian period, for instance, reform meant capitulation to episcopal tutelage, a virtual surrender of the kingdom into the hands of the bishops.79 From the mid-eleventh century, reform meant a head-on clash with an aggressive papacy suspicious of royal motives and jealous of "ecclesiastical liberties." The popes, of course, never renounced 77. On these trends see Gabriel Le Bras, Institutions ecclksiastiques de la chretiente' midihvale (Paris, 1964), pp. 565-96; E. H. Kantorowicz, The King's Two Bodies (Princeton, 1957), chap. 5, passim; and Joseph Strayer's studies in Medieval Statecraft and the Perspectives of History (Princeton, 1971), esp.

(Paris, 1956), 1: 183-88. 78. Corruption through contact with Jews was also a theme local officials dealt with, e.g., for southern French laws from the thirteenth century which viewed actual physical contact of any kind with Jews as a source of infection, see Maurice Kriegel, Les Juifs lafin du Moyen Age (Paris, 1979), pp. 40-47. 79.

Nevertheless, by the end of the thirteenth century, these claims retained little more than theoretical force, as Boniface VIII so ignominiously discovered. Correspondingly, the thirteenth century wit- nessed large increases in royal power and stability, most notably, the eman- cipation of the kings from ecclesiastical advisors as their intimate councils began to be composed almost exclusively of laymen,80 and, no less impor- tant, a growing popular devotion to the ideal of the kingdom, a devotion which began to rival that previously accorded to matters of a purely spiritual and churchly nature. If, in other words, kings now wished to insert them- selves into spiritual affairs,8' the way was open. It must be stressed that this activity of the kings in spiritual affairs was not a product of political expediency. Philip IV certainly was concerned about questions of jurisdiction and prerogative when he directed his sene- schals in 1293 that no arrests by papal inquisitors were to be allowed with- out royal approval. Yet, in the same directive, he took care to republish and give his support to Gregory X's version of Turbato corde, a bull which ordered inquisitorial action against Jews who sought to proselytize or to aid converts returning to Judaism. The king was therefore no less anxious than the pope about the alleged offenses themselves.82 This was even more true in the case of usury. Here, the anxieties of the kings, not to mention their poli- cies, seem to have outstripped the apprehensions of the popes by far. Thus, the rhetoric of those kings who spoke of protecting their peoples from abasement and infection and who generally expressed the most pious of sen- timents when they acted against usury must be taken with complete serious- ness."3 They had combined their new-found ability to act in spiritual mat- ters with their sense of duty to crown and kingdom and with their own per- sonal sense of piety and devotion; the result was a thoroughgoing attack on usury. What these kings truly dreamed of, moreover, was to rid their kingdoms 80. See C. W. Hollister and J. W.

STOW of all usurious activity. Edward I certainly wanted to free himself from his Italian bankers. But his huge debt, which, on occasion, he tried to ignore, made such a mdve out of the question.84 In France, attempts were made to be rid of the Lombards, and, as John Mundy pointedly suggests, for reasons which had much in common with those used as pretexts for ousting the Jews, including xenophobia and the consciousness of the start of the rise of the national state."5 It was, however, only the usurious activities of "their Jews""6 over which the kings were able to exercise true control, and here, as seen, they did act decisively. This action has commonly been ascribed to economic and other practi- cal motivations. In England, Edward I was no longer able to benefit from the Jews as had his predecessors. Repeated tallages had severely reduced Jewish lending capital, and baronial pressure had brought an end to loans secured by fees and other forms of landed property."7 Such loans had been the most potent source of royal profit from the Jews as the result of for- feitures which were followed by the transfer of the defaulted lands and estates first to the Jews and subsequently to the crown or favored retainers.88 In addition, as the ability of the Jews to provide revenue decreased, Italians had arrived to replace them. None of this, however, justified Edward's attempt to extirpate Jewish lending root and branch. He could have always reorganized Jewish lending to keep both it profitable and his barons quiet, as he contemplated in 1287. Alternatively, he could have expelled the Jews and confiscated their prop- erty in 1275, or at his accession in 1272, if his true end was financial gain. Rather, he may very well have desired to protect the Jews-at the behest of the Church, as he said in 127589-but, nonetheless, in an economic status which did not include lending as their means of livelihood.

The same conclusion applies to the thirteenth century kings of France, and perhaps more obviously so, for French Jewry had not been as financially depleted as that of England. And the rhetoric of the French kings, who threatened to expel the Jews rather than permit them "to infect [the] land with their poison" of usury, was quite clearly pitched extremely high.90 Thus, in establishing a policy toward lending, and Jewish lending in par- ticular, the kings had allowed matters of a purely spiritual nature to blunt their good economic sense. If the popes had displayed institutional maturity by finding a way to harmonize theory with reality, the kings now revealed the inchoate state and the lack of sophistication of thirteenth century secular institutions. Incapable of working out a balanced program of moderate interest rates, they chose to pursue the theoretical and the ideal, the com- mon good of the patria and the safety of their souls, to the detriment of their true economic needs. The accusation of Meir b. Simeon that not the pope and not any church- man or group of churchmen, but the king himself was forcing the Jews to go hungry,9" and endangering their physical existence was, therefore, quite in order. The king, Meir indicates continuously, has violated the rule of the Jews' right to maintain their "good custom," the rule so assiduously upheld by the popes. But Meir also understood what was motivating Louis IX. Why, Meir asks Archbishop William de la Brou of Narbonne, had he changed his position. In 1246, he had followed the pope and accepted the idea of moderate interest; in 1255, he capitulated to the demands of the king and forbade interest altogether. Had the archbishop, Meir wonders in amazement, decided that rather than from the pope, he should "Learn from the king"! Did he now believe that the king "knew more of religion than he [himself]?" What Meir really wanted to know, of course, was why the king, St. Louis, had made himself the arbiter in a matter so clearly spiritual; why, going beyond the popes,92 he had decided that usury was so great a social threat that it had to be uprooted in so drastic a way. 90.

When in fifteenth century Italy, Fran- ciscan preachers, like Bernardino da Feltre, railed about the corruption Jewish lending was wreaking on society and demanded the expulsion of the Jews as the only possible remedy, the example they were following was not that of clerical forerunners alone, and certainly not that of the popes.93 It was no less, and perhaps even more so, the example set over a century and a half before by the kings of England and France.
