<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EMERGENCE OF A JEWISH NATIONALIST CONSCIOUSNESS IN EUROPE DURING THE 1860s AND 1870s by YOSEF SALMON A discussion of the emergence of a modern Jewish collective conscious- ness in Eastern Europe does not require us to address the question of the beginnings of a movement, which also has an organizational aspect. The phenomenon under discussion-at least in its initial stages-was not orga- nized; there were no membership cards, bylaws, or party conferences. It is my contention, however, that the emergence of a Jewish nationalist move- ment was connected to, and dependent upon, the prior emergence of a col- lective consciousness. Thus, on the one hand, our discussion is not based upon the phenomenological definition of nationalism, which is not a simple matter, while, on the other hand, we view the institutionalized nationalist movement as a consequence of a process of consciousness-building. Mine is a syncretic approach, the advantage of which is that it does not observe a historical process from an intellectual or theoretical point of reference for- eign to the process. It should be noted that the Jewish collective consciousness, as it devel- oped in the second half of the nineteenth century in the circles we will AJS Review 16 (1991): 107-132 107</page><page sequence="2">108 YOSEF SALMON discuss, was not monolithic. Its values, expressions, and institutions were pluralistic from the very beginning. Rabbi Zevi Hirsch Kalischer and Rabbi Judah Alkalai did not have the same views, and both differed from David Gordon, who, in turn, differed from Moses Hess. These four men were active by the 1860s. Those who followed in the next decade, such as Perez Smolenskin, Judah Leib Gordon, and Moses Leib Lilienblum, differed in outlook from their predecessors and from one another. Nonetheless, despite the great diversity of opinions and positions, there was a common denomi- nator that united all of them in a single process that was channeled into the Jewish nationalist movement as it took shape in the last two decades of the nineteenth century. The Jewish collective consciousness in Eastern Europe, however, was not necessarily of local origin. It evolved, primarily, among Eastern Euro- pean Jews who had been exposed to the Jewish culture of Western Europe and had become aware of the problems of Jewish identity under the condi- tions existing there. Regarding periodization, The time before 1881 is divided into two periods: 1830-1856, and 1856-1880. During the first period, a new collec- tive consciousness took shape through the Haskalah movement, and not merely to provide a solution for real problems, as Weinryb argues.' It came about partly because Jewish ethnicity was being examined in the light of col- lapsing traditional Jewish attitudes, and also because of romantic tendencies and the emergence of new literary genres in Hebrew and Yiddish that exert- ed a cumulative influence upon their readers. This article will concentrate on the second period (1856-1880), during which a militant nationalist platform evolved in Eastern Europe in reaction to the assimilatory trends in Western and Central Europe. The historical cir- cumstances of this era-the unification of Italy; Napoleon III's policy of supporting downtrodden national minorities; the Jews finding themselves caught in the middle in the Polish revolt of 1863; pressure and persecution in Romania, starting in the mid-1860s; the rise of international Jewish organi- zations in France, Austria, and England; the Odessa pogrom of 1871; the This article is based on a lecture delivered at a seminar on Jewish nationalism sponsored by the Institute for Advanced Studies of the Hebrew University, Jerusalem (November 1981). 1.

Two Types of Maskilim A distinction should be made between two opposing types of modern Jewish collective consciousness. Utilizing the term maskil, which refers to a Jew who adopted-wholly or in part-modern values and thought processes as opposed to traditional Jewish attitudes, we may denominate these two categories as observant maskil and secular maskil. The first category included rabbis like Kalischer, Mordecai Eliasberg, Mordecai-Gimpel Jaffe, Samuel Mohilewer, and Joseph Zevi Hirsch Duenner, and the writers Yehiel Michael Pines and Jehiel Brill. These men were moderately modern in outlook, within a traditional framework. Even in a formal geographic sense they lived in Western and Eastern Europe at one and the same time, due to the frequent changes in Poland's boundaries in the period from the partitions through the Congress of Vienna. In terms of Jewish culture, those who lived in Germany were remnants of the traditional Ashkenazic Jewry of the eighteenth centruy and the beginning of the nineteenth. In Western Europe this Jewry became a conspicuous minority as early as the middle of the nineteenth century, while in Eastern Europe it succeeded in maintaining its majority position until the end of the century. The above-mentioned individuals publicized their ideas in pamphlets and books, and in the Hebrew press, chiefly Ha-Maggid and Ha-Levanon. The second group included radical secular maskilim who took a nationalist-maskil position: Moses Leib Lilienblum, Perez Smolenskin, Judah Leib Gordon, Judah Leib Levin, Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, and others. They expressed themselves in the Hebrew press (Ha-Melitz, Ha-Shahar, Ha-Zefirah) and in the Russian and Yiddish Jewish press. An intermediate position between these poles was occupied by David Gordon, the acting editor of Ha-Maggid, Samuel Joseph Fuenn, the editor of Ha-Karmel in Vilna, and Joseph Kohen-Zedek, the editor of Ha-Mevaser in Galicia. All of these groups were able to find common ground in the Hibbat Zion move- ment. Their main literary activity on the subject of Jewish nationalism took</page><page sequence="4">110 YOSEF SALMON place during the 1870s and 1880s. We shall follow the development of the collective consciousness among these groups chronologically. Periodical Literature as a Medium The second half of the 1850s and the first half of the 1860s were marked by the development of public political consciousness in all of Europe and especially in Eastern Europe. The accession of Alexander II in Russia aroused high hopes among both Jews and non-Jews. The end of the Cri- mean War and the signing of the Paris peace treaty (March 30, 1856), together with the Ottoman government's publication of reforms regarding minorities within the empire (Hatt-i Humayun, February 18, 1856), made emigration to Eretz Israel seem possible and feasible. It was during this period that the press became a medium that not only provided information but shaped public opinion. The rise of the Hebrew press was part and parcel of this development. The first of the Hebrew newspapers was Ha-Maggid in Lyck. Ostensibly it was meant to provide its readers with information about what was happening in the wide world; in practice, it constituted a forum for the discussion-and creation-of Jewish political aspirations and the crystallization of Jewish public opinion. The use of Hebrew was justified on the grounds that it is the "main bond which joins all the dispersed of Israel together." The editor, Eliezer Lipmann Silbermann, was apparently unaware of the quasi- nationalist significance of this policy. When David Gordon was appointed as deputy editor in 1858, he added a new section to the paper, "Ha-Zofeh le-ha-Maggid," devoted to Jewish scholarship. This might seem to have been a neutral area as far as collective aspirations were concerned, but the renewed interest in this field was motivated by a romantic desire to return to the past. Indeed, the establish- ment of the Makizei Nirdamim ("Awakeners of the Sleepers") Society by Silbermann in 1862 was a direct consequence of Gordon's venture. As Silbermann wrote in his announcement of the society's founding: "In this periodical [i.e., Ha-Maggid] I went forth for the honor of the holy tongue, to revive and uplift it, for the glory and benefit of our brethren, the children of Israel, living with us here. And now I desire to do something as well for the honor of the Torah and wisdom specifically, and to act kindly with the</page><page sequence="5">JEWISH COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS IN EASTERN EUROPE 111 dead, to revive them"2 The preoccupation with Jewish scholarship had romantic rather than apologetic motives. For Lithuanian Jews, living in a small Prussian town near the Russian border, this in itself is not surprising; however, their paper was directed to a public who had for many years been struggling against the Reform movement, which sought to eliminate Hebrew, not only as an everyday language, but even as the language of ritual. This was also the time when the Hebrew novel was born. Abraham Mapu's Ahavat Zion ("Love of Zion") appeared in 1853, and in 1857, the first part of Ayit Zavu'a ("The Hypocrite"). From 1858 to 1861 Ha-Maggid had been conducting an intense discussion on the revival of Hebrew as a liv- ing, everyday language. In the course of this discussion, quasi-nationalistic interpretations were given to Mapu's writings, and it was argued that the revival of Hebrew as a literary language would strengthen romantic popular sentiment: "which tens of thousands of Jews have enjoyed from generation to generation, for they found the delights of 'days of yore,' the language of the people, in it."' Thus the Haskalah and the nationalist movement were linked by the fact that maskil authors, aided by the patrons of the Has- kalah in Russia (Yusel and Horace Guenzburg, M. Weinstein of Kiev, Leon Rosenthal of St. Petersburg),4 were writing literary works that had quasi- nationalist implications of which their benefactors were ignorant. The Society for the Colonization of Palestine The Society for the Colonization of Palestine (Colonisations-Verein fuer Palaestina) was founded by Chaim Luria (Lorje) in Frankfurt on Oder in 1860, and that same year the Alliance Israelite Universelle was founded in Paris. Luria's exact motives are unknown, but they were unquestionably connected to developments in Western Europe, possibly including the failure of the Revolution of 1848. The organization he founded had impor- 2. Ha-Maggid, 1861, no. 36, p. 225. 3. Y.

Luria's initiative had the limited goal of making the Jews then living in Eretz Israel self- sufficient. From the press reactions to his proposals, however, one might think that the society was a political movement aiming to colonize Eretz Israel with Jews. Any such project was rejected on principle by the journal of German Orthodoxy, Der Israelit, and on practical grounds by Ha-Maggid,5 although a year later its editorial board reversed its position.6 Rabbi Kalischer's ideas preceded the establishment of the Colonisations- Verein fuer Palaestina or the Alliance Israel1ite Universelle. As early as the 1830s he had formulated an interpretation of messianism that combined human initiative with miraculous redemption, as is clear from his letter to Rothschild in 1836. The Colonisations-Verein fuer Palaestina pub- lished Kalischer's Derishat Ziyyon ("For the Sake of Zion"), which suited and even exceeded the thinking of the society's founders.7 The passages from Derishat Ziyyon cited by Moses Hess, and the fact that the society adopted Derishat Ziyyon and Rome and Jerusalem as its ideological plat- form, indicate the nature of the essays and the Colonisations-Verein. The purpose was also clearly stated by Rabbi Judah Alkalai: "The ingathering of the exiles in a single company in the land, one people in the beloved land." At the same time, however, the support given the Colonisations-Verein by people like Akiva Lehren, the head of the Pekidim and Amarkalim of the Holy Land in Amsterdam, shows that its modern, nationalist character was not clear to everyone. At any rate, from the publication of Derishat Ziyyon in 1862 until his death in 1875 Kalischer devoted himself to the dissemina- tion of his ideas, which were set forth in two editions of the book, dozens of essays in the Hebrew press (mainly in Ha-Levanon and Ha-Maggid), and hundreds of letters to virtually every prominent contemporary Jew. In light of this it is natural to ask how the public reacted to his ideas. 5. Der Israelit, year 1 (1860), no. 16, pp. 194-195; Ha-Maggid, 1860, no. 33, pp. 129-130. In our opinion, Kressel erred in his evaluation that the response of Ha-Maggid was stronger than that of Der Israelit. See G.

B. Z. Yehoshua and A. Kedar (Jerusalem, 1978), pp. 21-37.</page><page sequence="7">JEWISH COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS IN EASTERN EUROPE 113 Several important rabbinical authorities-among them Rabbi Jacob Mecklenburg, the rabbi of Koenigsberg, Rabbi Simhah, the head of the rab- binical court of Lubraniec, and Rabbi Elijah Guttmacher of Grodzisk Wielkopolskis-gave writs of approval (haskamot) to Derishat Ziyyon but did not accept Kalischer's nationalist ideas. Similarly, at least some of the supporters of the Colonisations-Verein fuer Palaestina were concerned only with the society's minimalist program of settling Jews already in Eretz Israel in agricultural colonies and therefore can hardly be considered nationalists. Rabbi Guttmacher fluctuated between Kalischer's views and the traditional position but had the same reservation as Azriel Hildesheimer and other Ger- man rabbis-the fear that Eretz Israel might be resettled by nonobservant Jews. At that time two programs connected with Eretz Israel were competing for the support of traditional Jews in Western and Central Europe. The first was the Batei Mahase ("Shelters") Society, founded in 1858 and headed by Rabbis Michael Sachs, Azriel Hildesheimer, Jacob Ettlinger, and Isaac Dov Bamberger, all of whom were leaders of traditional Jewry in Central and Western Europe. The other was the Hevrat Yishuv Eretz Yisrael (as the Society for the Colonization of Palestine was called in Hebrew). The Batei Mahase received general support, unlike the Hevrat Yishuv Eretz Yisrael, because it was neutral on the national question. Moderate Orthodoxy sup- ported the Batei Mahase but not the Hevrat Yishuv Eretz Yisrael. Radical Orthodoxy, in contrast, supported neither society. Ludwig Philippson, the editor of the Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums, and other moderate mem- bers of the Reform movement were potential supporters of the Batei Mahase Society but not of the Hevrat Yishuv Eretz Yisrael; radical reform- ers like Abraham Geiger rejected both. In Eastern Europe the Hevrat Yishuv Eretz Yisrael was supported by Samuel Joseph Fuenn of Vilna, Rabbi David Freidman of Karlin, Israel Joshua Trunk of Kutno, and Rabbi Isaac Elhanan Spektor of Kovno. They were not Jewish nationalists in the modern sense. At most, they were backing what they saw as a constructive enterprise on behalf of the Jews in Eretz Israel. Their sense of pan-Jewish responsibility is beyond doubt, but it was totally devoid of anything resembling the modern nationalist ideology. Although these same men were later active in the Hibbat Zion movement, of 8. Ha-Maggid, 1862, no. 32, pp. 250-251.</page><page sequence="8">114 YOSEF SALMON which Fuenn was one of the pillars, it is debatable whether, even at that later stage, they possessed a religious-nationalist outlook comparable to that of Rabbis Kalischer, Mohilewer, and Reines. At any rate, it is clear that during this period Ha-Karmel, Fuenn's periodical, reflected a typically maskil approach, meaning that it was focused inward, concentrating solely upon improving the way of life and educational level of Russian Jewry. It should be noted that the later Eastern European Orthodox opposition to pan-Jewish initiatives with a modern, nationalist coloration was already evident in the 1860s, mainly on the part of German Orthodoxy and the Jewish leadership in Eretz Israel. Such opposition found expression in Der Israelit, Ha-Maggid, and Ha-Levanon, and its slogan was the verse "Unless the Lord builds the house, its builders labor in vain on it" (Ps. 127:1)-in other words, the restoration of Eretz Israel should be by an act of God; human initiative constituted a rebellion against the divine will. A generation would have to pass, however, before these reservations were translated into operative measures: in Galicia and in Hungary by the first half of the 1890s, in Russia and Poland only at the end of that decade. David Gordon and Ha-Maggid It was Ha-Maggid, the most widely distributed Hebrew newspaper of the time, which gave momentum to the nationalist ideas, and the person who formulated them was David Gordon. In this article we will not analyze Gordon's ideology.9 Gordon lived on the border of Western and Eastern Europe; he had had a general education, and could read Russian, English, and German. He was thus both equipped and located to observe the whole Jewish world. An eclectic, he absorbed the different trends and combined them, integrating the ideas of Hess and Kalischer in his arguments. He was also aware of political and millenarian Christian statements favoring the return of the Jews to Eretz Israel, such as that of Ernest Laharanne. Gordon was an Eastern European Jew with a traditional education who was exposed to Western trends, both Jewish and general. He believed that 9. See Y. Salmon, "David Gordon ve-Iton Ha-Maggid: Hilufei Emdot la-Le'umiyut ha- Yehudit 1860-1882" [David Gordon and the Ha-Maggid newspaper: His changing positions toward Jewish nationalism, 1860-1882], Zion 47 (1982): 145-164.</page><page sequence="9">JEWISH COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS IN EASTERN EUROPE 115 the nationalist drive to build a Jewish state in Eretz Israel was the only pos- sible means of unifying the Jewish world's many different streams into a comprehensive, functioning unit. It would also reconcile what he called "the righteous and the enlightened." On the intellectual plane as well, Gordon integrated the traditional Jewish way of life (albeit with a willingness to introduce social reforms in the spirit of the Haskalah) with aspirations for political modernization. In his words, "The Jewish mission is to proceed forward on the political issues and in the knowledge necessary for man qua man, but to be on guard ... in everything pertaining to our holy religion." He defined himself as an intermediary between Reform and Orthodoxy, a definition that would also apply to Moses Hess and Joseph Natonek, and to some degree to Rabbi Kalischer. In Gordon's view, the traditionalists were sealing themselves off from the outside world, while the reformers were abandoning all that was distinctive in the Jewish experience; thus each group was endangering the Jewish aspiration "to be a unique nation on earth, as in ancient times and days of yore." Gordon did not negate the emancipation, but he was convinced that its achievements were a "tem- porary success" limited to specific countries.'0 On the one hand, Gordon's thinking took on this pessimistic cast when the Jews were caught in the crossfire in the Polish revolt of 1863.1 On the other hand, he was borne along by an optimistic confidence that France would assist in the building of the Jewish state in Eretz Israel, a confidence inspired by the pamphlet published by Ernest Laharanne in 1860.12 Ha-Mevaser in Galicia The Galician Ha-Mevaser was a Hebrew newspaper similar to Ha- Maggid. It too stood between traditional circles and the radical Haskalah. In its first issues Hebrew served merely as a vehicle for disseminating modernism; later on, however, the romantic attitude toward Hebrew was conspicuous, in an attempt to restore the language's pristine splendor. Hebrew was the "heritage of our forefathers," a remnant of earthly Jewish 10. According to Gordon. See Ha-Maggid, 1863, no. 14, p. 106. 11.

Laharanne, La nouvelle question d'Orient (Paris, 1860).</page><page sequence="10">116 YOSEF SALMON nationalism.'3 The romantic approach was also apparent in the prominence the paper gave to news items regarding Jewish communities in remote places and in its interest in the geography of Eretz Israel. The synthesis of Torah and modernism, of the observance of the commandments and the nurturing of national pride, was expressed in Ha-Mevaser's masthead motto: "To strengthen religion and exalt the Torah, to glorify the honor of the Jewish nation to the greatest extent possible, to make the holy tongue beloved by its readers." Ha-Mevaser, unlike Ha-Maggid, was not pessimistic about emancipation. It evaluated the outbreaks in Germany as having been brought about by "the remnants of our enemies." Ha-Mevaser can also be categorized as a conservative maskil journal, however, for its interest in such values as the revival of Hebrew, Wissenschaft des Judentums, and Eretz Israel placed it on the border of national romanticism. Ha-Mevaser's posi- tion on the settlement of Eretz Israel was minimalist, and the paper mainly focused on aid to Jews already living there. The social ascent of Western European Jewry, as exemplified by outstanding families like the Rothschilds and the Camondos and by individuals like Montefiore and Cremieux, and the establishment of organizations like the Alliance Israelite Universelle, made a strong impression upon Ha-Mevaser. It saw these achievements as signs of the success of the emancipation, in the sense of international recog- nition that "Israel will be considered as one of the nations." This recognition was not, however, to be translated into concrete nationalist activity in the historical homeland.'4 Ha-Karmel in Vienna and Ha-Melitz in Odessa What echoes did the mood of national awakening in Prussia and Galicia produce in the Hebrew press in Russia? Ha-Karmel in Vilna, published and edited by Samuel Joseph Fuenn, did not support the Hevrat Yishuv Eretz Israel at all, but was entirely devoted to the encouragement of moderniza- tion and productivization. The Hevrat Marbei ha-Haskalah ("Society of the Increasers of Enlightenment"), founded in Odessa in 1862, completely occu- pied Fuenn, and satisfied his aspirations. Animated by the same optimism 13.

Strains of the mission of Israel idea, which was more characteristic of Western European Jewry, were echoed in the pages of Ha-Melitz in such formulations as "to proclaim the name of God in the world" and "so that all inhabitants of the land will learn how to rule the passions of the flesh." On the other hand, Ha-Melitz championed the development of Jewish national pride and, in the name of Israel's divine mission, was totally opposed to assimilation. The two journals treated Hebrew solely as an educational tool. On such matters there was a large gap between Ha-Melitz and Ha-Maggid. Ha-Melitz had no position on practi- cal questions or on the nationalist programs which found their expression in Ha-Maggid. Regarding such issues it made do with reports of the opposing views and did not itself take a stand. Ha-Levanon in Mainz Most of the readers of Ha-Levanon, which was published in Jerusalem in 1863-64 and afterwards moved to Paris and Mainz, were concentrated in Eastern Europe. During its Jerusalem period, Ha-Levanon gave extensive coverage to the local Ashkenazic community's reaction to the ideas of Kalischer and the Hevrat Yishuv Eretz Israel. Headed by Rabbi Meir Auer- bach, Jerusalem's Eastern European community rejected the proposals on practical grounds and also because of the principle that condemned any human effort to bring about the redemption. In time, however, the editorial board was so impressed by the activities in Europe on behalf of agricultural colonization that it promised to publicize the activities of Hevrat Yishuv Eretz Israel, and even supported the settlement in Moza, a village just out- side Jerusalem. Ha-Levanon was similarly impressed by the interest Chris- tians were taking in the return of the Jews to Eretz Israel: "This vision shows us the finger of God, hinting to the people of the Lord that its salvation shall not tarry; the days are drawing near when it shall be said to Zion: 'Arise!' "'5 Ha-Levanon also provided Kalischer with a platform from which he could 15. Ha-Levanon, 1863, no. 7, p. 44 n.</page><page sequence="12">118 YOSEF SALMON confront traditional Eastern European Jewry. Hevrat Yishuv Eretz Israel and Rabbi Kalischer disagreed with the supporters of the Yishuv Yashan (the old, pre-Zionist Jewish community in Eretz Israel) on such decisive questions as the ideological basis of the Halukah (distribution of charitable funds from abroad to the Jews living in Eretz Israel), as opposed to the modern national approach, which rejected it, or limited its importance. As time went on it proved impossible to restrict the discussion to the question of productivization. By the summer of 1863 positions were clearly defined, and, as a result, Hevrat Yishuv Eretz Israel began losing supporters. It final- ly disintegrated for this reason and also because of leadership problems. New Intiatives to Settle the Land of Israel After Hevrat Yishuv Eretz Israel collapsed, several groups arose that were prepared to carry out its program-groups of Jews in distress, both in Eretz Israel and abroad, who wanted to settle on the land in Eretz Israel. But no one was willing to back them. The Alliance Israelite Universelle con- sistently refused to aid groups that wanted to emigrate to Eretz Israel. At the same time, however, it should be noted that the Hevrat Yishuv Eretz Israel in Frankfurt was not merely an isolated episode. Other organizations were founded in its wake-in Frankfurt on Main in 1865, in Berlin in 1870, the Ahavat Zion Society in Bamberg, and others. All of these constituted attempts to revive the mood which had prevailed at the beginning of the 1860s and then faded out. The debate regarding the settlement of Eretz Israel was renewed in the years 1866 to 1868, energized by hopes that the Alliance Israelite Universelle would make it possible for the Hevrat Yishuv Eretz Israel program to be actualized. As a result of pressure-and appeals-from Jews in Serbia, Lithuania, and Eretz Israel, the Alliance, in 1866, agreed in principle to sup- port agricultural colonization. Although the decision was limited in scope, the interested parties now had more than their mere desires to rely upon. Hopes were further raised by the distressed situation of Romanian Jewry after the unification of Wallachia and Moldavia into a single state (1859-64) and the assumption of power by King Carol I. Rabbi Joseph Natonek's mis- sion to the Ottoman government in the summer of 1867, after his visit to the Alliance Israelite Universelle center in Paris, also contributed to the opti- mistic atmosphere, as did reports from Eretz Israel that internal security had</page><page sequence="13">JEWISH COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS IN EASTERN EUROPE 119 improved. These hopes quickly faded, however, when, on January 15, 1866, the Alliance turned down a request by the Jews of Sabac (Serbia) that it help them emigrate to Eretz Israel and settle there. The Alliance encouraged them instead to go to America. A similar request from Ponevezh (Pane- vezys) was also rejected in the summer of 1867. Charles Netter's visit to Eretz Israel in the summer of 1868 concluded with the decision to establish Mikveh Israel (March 1869), a disappointing decision even when compared with the modest hope of settling the Jews of Eretz Israel on the land. The Board of Deputies of British Jews, which sent its president, Moses Monte- fiore, to visit Eretz Israel in March-April 1866, adopted an approach simi- lar to that of the Alliance Israel1ite Universelle. Montefiore's reports indicated that the Jews of Eretz Israel were willing to take up agricultural work, but he did not address himself to the idea in its entirety, as had the Hevrat Yishuv Eretz Israel. Montefiore advocated helping Jews who were not happy in Eretz Israel to return to Europe; as for those who were willing to remain there, he proposed building houses and farming colonies for them-"to act beneficently with our brethren the children of Israel in the Holy Land." Ha-Maggid was occupied during these years with the struggle to solidify the gains of emancipation and with refuting the argument that Orthodoxy had ideological reasons for opposing emancipation. Regarding the national idea, "The vision is still for the appointed time [i.e., it is too soon] to speak of this matter [even] among ourselves."'6 Reactions to the Reform Conventions The "appointed time" came with the conferences of the Reform move- ment in Kassel, Leipzig, and Augsburg in the years 1868-1871. By revitaliz- ing the positions Reform Judaism had taken in the 1840s, these conferences provoked a forceful Orthodox response. Kalisher and his German Ortho- dox opponents blamed each other for Reform's achievements. Since Kalischer viewed all events through a messianic-nationalist prism, the Reform victories were, in his eyes, a sign that his was the generation of the Messiah, in accordance with the midrash that "in the messianic age, inso- lence will prevail" and "before the Redeemer comes the lawless will out- 16. Ha-Maggid, 1867, no. 2, p. 12.</page><page sequence="14">120 YOSEF SALMON number the steadfast." Here, for the first time, Kalischer publicly criticized German Orthodoxy, claiming that "many of the geonim [great rabbinic scholars] in Russia" supported him.'7 During the course of the debate, all activities not identified with the Hev- rat Yishuv Eretz Israel came under attack, including those of Batei Mahase, the Alliance Israelite Universelle, and the Hevrat Dorshei Zion Society in Paris, founded by Joseph Blumenthal. The difference between nationalist propaganda and charitable and philanthropic work, which had been blurred for some time, was now increasingly stressed. The spokesman for the Ortho- dox of Russia in this debate was Rabbi Alexander Moses Lapidot, who later became one of the most vigorous supporters of the Hibbat Zion movement until the crisis of the mid-1890s. He stated in an essay in Ha-Levanon: "We shall not yield on the question of emigration to the Holy Land; only the pious and the men of deeds [i.e., Orthodox Jews] shall go up to serve the Lord, and to pray for the welfare of their dispersed brethren and for the entire world." According to Lapidot, the Haskalah had failed because the Orthodox, identifying it with the Reform movement, had concluded that it posed a threat to traditional halakhic observance. The damage caused by Reform would be corrected, not by emigration to Eretz Israel, he said, but by waiting faithfully for "the son of David, our righteous Messiah."'8 An anonymous writer in Ha-Levanon charged that the Hevrat Yishuv Eretz Israel's plan for Jews to become farmers would cause "the total uprooting of our religion," since agriculture could not provide observant Jews with an adequate livelihood, especially in Eretz Israel, where they would have to observe agricultural commandments which are applicable only there. The reply to Reform is "to increase the yeshivot [talmudic academies], and to support those studying Torah and Torah scholars, and they will oppose them [i.e., the reformers] with the wisdom of the Torah."'9 The debate over the Reform conferences caused a clear polarization between the nationalists and their opponents of all camps. 17.

Several options were considered in the months that followed: productivization in Russia, emigration to America, emigration to Eretz Israel. The latter option had few supporters. Ha-Maggid served as a forum for the discussion of the other two. In Prussia a number of societies named Tomkhei Dalim be-Russia u-be-Polin ("Supporters of the Poor in Russia and in Poland") were found- ed, on the initiative of the editorial board of Ha-Maggid, which gave its support to Jews who desired productivization in Russia. The paper criti- cized the traditional leaders in Russia for having failed to take significant steps to correct the situation, thereby adding its voice to Fuenn's recommen- dation that societies for agricultural colonization and vocational training be established in Russia. Ha-Maggid's extreme criticism left the journal open to charges of noncredibility, not only among extreme traditionalists, but even among traditional maskilim. Ha-Maggid also endorsed the Le-Ezrat Aheinu Benei Yisrael be-Rusland ("For the Assistance of Our Brethren the Children of Israel in Russia") Society, which was founded in Berlin by Reform circles, with the aid of the Alliance Israel1ite Universelle. When traditional Jews became suspicious of this new organization, for fear that it would be a means of introducing religious reforms, Ha-Maggid was forced to withdraw its support. Even in its most trying hours, Russian Jewry reject- ed all efforts by Western Jewry to interfere with its internal life. Kalischer, for instance, was willing to cooperate with Moses Hess but strenuously opposed any cooperation with the Reform movement. In Kalischer's words: "A person cannot live together with a snake." Observant Maskilim in Russia in the late 1860s and early 1870s In the midst of this controversy, the only voice in Eastern Europe to call for a revival of the work done by the Hevrat Yishuv Eretz Israel was that of Yehiel Michael Pines, who played a central role in the Hibbat Zion move- ment until he left it in the mid-1890s. Typologically, he was what we have called an observant maskil. This group accepted the Haskalah's critique of</page><page sequence="16">122 YOSEF SALMON East European Jewry's way of life and communal leadership, especially after it was reinforced by the economic crisis at the end of the 1860s. As we have seen, the spokesmen for the Hevrat Yishuv Eretz Israel in the West had assigned various Jewish communities to be the bearers of the national redemption in accordance with contemporary circumstances. From the end of the 1860s these were the Jews of Eastern Europe. Pines, unlike Lapidot, took up the challenge, for he was cognizant of Russian Jewry's need for productivization-in Russia itself, in America, or in Eretz Israel. Emotion- ally, he preferred Eretz Israel "for the feeling of love for the land of our fathers"; practically, however, he was willing to accept any framework that would be able to provide "bread for the thousands afflicted by the period, and lift the honor and situation of Israel."20 What was new about this trend, in comparison with its predecessor, was its awareness of the social predicament of Russian Jewry; and, as a result, its nationalist program included social elements. Productivization was advo- cated not merely because it would enable people to live in dignity, but also as a prerequisite for national existence: "The land is the basis and the foun- dation upon which a political society and the national sanctuary will be brought together." In Pines's view, the spiritual crisis of East European Jewry ("the honor of the Torah and wisdom have been exiled from Israel") was a consequence of socioeconomic conditions. Thus he was able to make a distinction between philanthropic activities on behalf of Eretz Israel, such as those of the Alliance Israel1ite Universelle ("feeling compassion [and] mercy for their tortured and oppressed brethren"), and the initiatives of the Hevrat Yishuv Eretz Israel, which sprang from a "feeling of love and piety for the land of our fathers." According to Pines, the answer to the national question was also the solution to the spiritual crisis; were the Jewish people once again to work the soil in Eretz Israel, the nation's pristine splendor would be restored, and it would be an era in which "the honor of the Torah and wisdom will not be exiled from Israel." These ideas were later developed by Rabbis I. J. Reines and M. Eliasberg, demonstrating that their circle's nationalist conversion was not one-dimensional.21 The Reform conferences and the discussion on the future of Russian 20.

Gordon was quite candid. Stating unequivocally that the national revival in Eretz Israel would consist of the ingathering of the exiles, he charged Geiger with aiding the enemies of the Jews to destroy them as a national entity. Pines argued that Jewish nationalist aspirations were consistent with the general nationalist awakening in Europe, "for the hope and desire of our nation to be a special independent people is not against the spirit of the time, but rather is founded on it."23 Similarly, he said, the claim of a Jewish mission in the world was groundless, for in the modern world it was France, and not the Jewish people, which was the torchbearer of a universal civilizing mission. Gordon called upon the Alliance Israel1ite Universelle to abandon philanthropy and harness itself to the national movement ("national base"), i.e., to act on behalf of "the ingathering of our dispersed ones to the land of our fathers."24 Alliance and the Settlement of the Land of Israel The Alliance Israel1ite Universelle's decision to found Mikveh Israel (1870) further nourished the nationalist awakening. With this decision, which maintained Mikveh Israel as an agricultural school for the Jews of the East, the Alliance satisfied those who were pressing it to help Jews in distress emigrate to Eretz Israel, thereby freeing itself of any hint of nationalism. Ha-Levanon, which in the meantime had moved from Paris to Mainz, now began to change its position. Under the editorship of Jehiel Brill, who would later bring to Eretz Israel the group of farmers who founded the settlement of Ekron, the journal moved closer to Ha-Maggid, despite the support it received from German Orthodoxy. The latter apparently did not oppose the 22.

The founding of agricultural colonies in Eretz Israel accorded with humanitarian principles, in that those working the land lived by their own labor, and created an opportunity for redemption; as Brill wrote: "The truth will be seen in this, that we please its [Eretz Israel's] stones and find favor in its soil." He also scathingly criticized the Halukah and interpreted the emancipation as a sign that the time to return to Zion had come.25 The Nationalist Awareness in Russia in the 1870s Around the beginning of the 1870s the center of the national awakening moved from Posen and eastern Prussia to Russia-mainly to Lithuania, Byelorussia, and Odessa. Three Hebrew journals brought the nationalist idea to the public: Ha-Shahar in Vienna, Ha-Maggid in Lyck, and Ha- Levanon in Paris and Mainz. Ha-Maggid and Ha-Levanon reflected the opinions of traditional maskilic circles, while Ha-Shahar represented a new breed of radical maskilim who been converted to Jewish nationalism. The former two journals served as a platform for Jews from Eastern Europe and were read mainly in Russia and Poland. The young author Reuben Asher Braudes described the emancipation of Western and Central European Jewry as the beginning of a national Jewish revival. "And now we too shall arise and awaken, we too are alive and exist, we too are a nationality in the inhabited world, and if even now we are not for ourselves, who will be for us?" Braudes saw the Alliance and the British Board of Deputies as harbingers of the Jewish national revival. Reproaching the Jews of the Ukraine for not coming to the aid of Lithuanian and Byelo- russian Jewry during the famine years, he compared their failure to respond with the response of the Jews of Western Europe: "The time has come for you [Ukrainian Jews] too to be concerned about the community, and for you too to awaken, to be of one mind, and to be infused with the fraternal spirit."26 In comparison with the other trends, the traditional-maskil ideology of Rabbis Kalischer and Alkalai was distinguished by its straightforward, 25.

Since these two men had become nationalists not in reaction to external pressures, contemporary events influenced them only tactically, as indica- tions that the chances for realizing their aspirations had improved. Thus Kalischer had no qualms about passing the banner of his vision from one group to another as current circumstances and needs warranted. By way of contrast, Gordon and Pines did not have a well-formulated program, since they had not yet abandoned their modernist hope for emancipation and productivization. In other words, while Kalischer had a post-emancipatory approach, Gordon and Pines were still in the pre-emancipatory world (Gordon's ambivalence between West and East is evident in his writings). This ambivalence was most prominent among radical maskilim. If we follow the development of Judah Leib Gordon, Perez Smolenskin, and Moses Leib Lilienblum until the pogroms of the 1880s, we find many convolutions: sup- port for the old maskilic dream of integration within the Russian state, or desperation and disappointment which found a shelter in nationalist hopes, either within or outside a European context. Smolenskin and Judah Leib Gordon continued to have mixed feelings even after the pogroms, which was not the case with Lilienblum, who crossed the Rubicon. At the same time it is difficult to avoid the impression that Smolenskin and Lilienblum felt that their willingness to respond to the demands of the gentile world would not receive a favorable response. The maskilim of the period had already analyzed this ambivalence. Smolenskin, for example, distinguished between belles lettres and publicistic writing. Belles lettres dealt with internal Jewish life, while publicistic writing confronted the surrounding society's attitude toward the Jews, and it was this form of writing which expressed his nationalist position. Similarly, Judah Leib Gordon's Russian essays confronted the attitudes about the Jews found in society at large while his Hebrew essays called for an internal Jewish reform. Judah Leib Gordon Some of the milestones in the lives of central figures in this group are ger- mane to our discussion. Throughout the 1860s Judah Leib Gordon unequi- vocally justified Russian attitudes toward the Jews and was always ready to cooperate with government efforts to force modernization upon them. His</page><page sequence="20">126 YOSEF SALMON famous poem "Ashka de-Rispak" ("The Shaft of a Litter"; 1867) includes the line: "Foreigners will no longer persecute us-we are our own persecu- tors; our hands are not bound-the iron is in our own souls." The same position was expressed in two earlier poems, "Hekizah Ami" ("Awake, My People"; 1863), in which he coined the aphorism "Be a man when you go forth, and a Jew in your home," which became the slogan of the Haskalah movement in Russia,27 and "Derekh Bat Ami" ("The Way of My People"; 1865). Gordon's unwillingness to give up the messianic dream found expres- sion in a Ha-Melitz article entitled "Binah le-To'ei Ru'ah" ("Wisdom for Those Erring in Spirit"),28 a polemic against the society Mazdirei-Ha- Rabim "those who justify the majority." In this essay he unwaveringly main- tained that Jewish national redemption in Eretz Israel was contingent upon internal reforms along maskil lines. The details of the reforms he demanded are not relevant to our discussion, but it is important to realize that his stand amounted to "conditional nationalism."29 Against this background, there was a lengthy debate between Lilienblum and Gordon after the pogroms of the 1880s,30 with Lilienblum rejecting Gordon's reservations and conditions for a nationalist solution. Of chief interest to us is the debate conducted by Judah Leib Gordon in 1870. It was opened by Lilienblum with two essays in Ha-Melitz, "Orhot ha-Talmud" ("The Ways of the Talmud") and "Nosafot le-ha-Ma'amar Orhot ha-Talmud" ("Addenda to the Essay 'The Ways of the Talmud'"), and included other writings published between 1868 and 1870.3~ The demand for a reformation of Jewish law by men who had been educated in yeshivot and used arguments based on rabbinic sources prompted observant 27.

The demand for halakhic reform, which was first presented systematically in Russia, fitted in with the program proposed in Western Europe at the Reform conferences in Leipzig, Augsburg, and Kassel. The parties to the dispute both rejected Western Reform in everything connected with Jewish national aspirations. Judah Leib Gordon, in "Binah le-To'ei Ru'ah," and especially in the "Hashma- tah" which was published in Ha-Shahar in 1871,32 identified completely with David Gordon's essay "Davar be-Ito" ("A Word in Its Right Time"). The main thrust of this essay, however, was a scathing criticism of the tradi- tionalists that held them responsible for everything that was wrong in Jewish society. Judah Leib Gordon did not feel that Jewish national aspirations would be realized soon or even in his lifetime. After the pogroms he still jus- tified the anti-Jewish claims of lack of productivity, religious fanaticism and backwardness; but in his estimation the Russian government had reconciled itself to the pogroms, and therefore he began to favor emigration. At first he recommended America as the destination, then he began to advocate Eretz Israel. A few months later, however, he returned to his former belief that Jews should build a future in Russia. Perez Smolenskin Perez Smolenskin took an entirely different route. Smolenskin had painted a pessimistic picture of the future of the Jewish people in exile after the Polish revolt of 1863. There is no doubt, however, that his encounter with Western Jewry, when he settled in Vienna in 1868, is what determined his approach to these issues. In the opening piece in Ha-Shahar, Smolenskin relates how he once heard a liberal rabbi declare, "I wish that I had the ability to uproot the Hebrew tongue," and then had said to himself, "Those who despise the Hebrew tongue will despise the Hebrew people. They will have neither name nor remembrance among Israel. They are traitors to their people and their faith." As this early essay shows, Smolenskin's national view was primarily cultural, concentrating on the preservation of the national language, Hebrew. Our language, he wrote, will "give us glory and strength, it will tie 32. J. L. Gordon, "Hashmatah" [Deletion], Ha-Shahar, year 2 (1871), pp. 154-156.</page><page sequence="22">128 YOSEF SALMON us with cords to be called by the name of Israel." A program of this kind, however, would not solve the social problems afflicting the Jews, he said, for it was entirely romantic, Hebrew being "the sole monument, the sole memory left to us from the culture of our Temple." Smolenskin did not abandon the aspirations of the Haskalah: "We shall be like all the nations to pursue and attain knowledge, to abandon the evil path of ignorance, to be loyal inhabitants in the lands of our dispersion." His nationalism was romantic, since it concentrated on symbols and memories. It had a limited cultural element, and was infused with abstract aspirations: "The belief that an end to our exile will come, that the day will come when the monarchy will return to the House of Israel, is neither a shame nor a disgrace for us."33 A different direction was apparent in Smolenskin's first programmatic essay, "Even Yisrael" ("The Rock of Israel"), a critique of an apologetic work by Dr. Adolf Jellinek.34 Smolenskin's analysis of anti-Semitism in this essay added a new dimension to his nationalist views: "It was not religion alone, nor envy alone, nor the love of wisdom alone, nor even the three together which kindled the fire of this hatred. . . . The reason is because the Jews' situation is bad, success has abandoned them, therefore they have become an object of mockery and scorn among the nations." It cannot be denied, he wrote, that "there is one people from one end of the world to the other which will be gathered by the name Israel, and united by the spirit of their faith." Smolenskin rejected the mission of Israel idea so beloved by Reform Judaism and cited fact after fact to prove that the Jews did not have the superior qualities attributed to them by reformers and liberals. "It will entirely suffice us to be considered as one of the peoples, and not to aggran- dize ourselves above all the nations; we shall gird our loins with strength to make it one people in the land, and figures like Shylock will aid us much more than figures like Nathan the Wise to effect this thing."35 In his Hebrew writings Smolenskin was the first to cite anti-Semitism as an element in nationalist ideology. He did not persevere in this position, however, but wavered between stressing positive nationalist motifs (mainly romantic), and arguing that the proper response to anti-Semitism was for 33. P.

This national entrenchment is to be understood only in the sense of building up strength. In "Even Yisrael" sensitivity to the social predicament of the Jews pushes aside any proposal for halakhic reform or for integration in the surrounding society, although the national response is not essentially a social response. To the aspirations of the "renewers," Smolenskin replies with derision: "They will first remove the chains their enemies have placed on them, and the reins which they have placed on their souls they will remove with their own hands, they will revive those enveloped by famine in the land of Russia, they will hold back those about to kill in the land of Romania if they extend their hand to them, and then they will preach words of love and fraternity to all the peoples."36 Like his predecessors, Smolenskin stood in the middle ground between the Jews of Western Europe, both Reform and Orthodox, "the way of the renewers which does not please me,"'37 and the Orthodox of Eastern Europe. His encounter with Western European Jewry drove him to defend Eastern European Orthodoxy more and more. In this he differed with Judah Leib Gordon, who continued to attack Eastern European Orthodoxy all his life and refused to endorse Hibbat Zion because of the role played by the Ortho- dox in Eretz Israel. Smolenskin was the first to turn the Jewish religion into a national institution. Since the 1870s he had not championed earthly nationalism, for "the religion of Israel is one society which joins together and unites the hearts of Jews wherever they are, therefore we must regard it not only as the religion of faith, but as a kingdom and language and all other institutions which will draw closer the hearts of the other peoples, to make them one people." His approach to religion was national-functional, and therefore he urged that Jews relate to it by criteria resting on this basis: "Heaven forbid that we touch one of its elements, lest the entire building be entirely undermined, leaving no remainder and name for this people, and we be as traitors, not only to the faith, but to the people as a whole.""38 Smolenskin spoke in operative terms of international recognition of Jews as a national minority, thereby anticipating by many years the national claims that Jews would make in their countries of residence. He also spoke 36. Ibid. 37. P. Smolenskin, "Am Olam" [Eternal people], ibid., year 3 (1872), p. 5. 38. Ibid., p. 81.</page><page sequence="24">130 YOSEF SALMON of the need for a national Jewish organization which would lead the people, "the teachers of the generation." The details of Smolenskin's national theory are not relevant to our discussion; it is replete with contradictions and unexplained twists; he both negated the idea of a Jewish mission and approved of it; he offered different explanations for anti-Semitism. We must note, however, that Smolenskin was the teacher and guide for national iden- tification throughout the 1870s. It was he who discovered and encouraged Eliezer Ben-Yehuda. Not surprisingly, therefore, when he arrived in Russia at the beginning of the pogroms, he was greeted by the young as the prophet of the generation. Nor is it surprising that even after he withdrew his sup- port for the idea of the earthly redemption, sometime after the pogroms, the young, including the BILU pioneers who went to Eretz Israel, still turned to him as the spiritual teacher of the renewed national movement. Moses Leib Lilienblum As for Moses Leib Lilienblum, who saw himself as a disciple of Judah Leib Gordon, his writings reveal a clearer and more logical line than those of his predecessors. The optimism of the 1860s runs through his essays until 1871. He knew the Slavophilic literature and its anti-Semitism from the out- set, but attributed this to "a few dark spots that will not cast a pall over the gold of the land of Russia, which is full of justice and love of man, and will not revolve around their shame.""39 He was impelled to publish his essays in favor of religious reform by his confidence that the government intended "to give us the same law as that of all the peoples, if only we will improve our ways,"40 and that "now better days will come to us and our children, yearn- ing for the life of the land, to be like every man."41 Subjected to criticism by traditional maskilim, he declared in "Devar ha-Tikunim ba-Dat" ("The Matter of Religious Reforms") that his position on a reform of the Hala- khah was basically different from that of Geiger and his associates. He wanted a reform springing "from the needs of life," he said, but the Reform 39. M. L. Lilienblum (Herlikhtzahn), "Vilkamir," Ha-Karmel, 1866, no. 23, p. 178. 40. See above, n. 30, and esp.

Lilienblum clearly insisted that there was no basis for giving up the traditional belief in the return and also rejected the idea of the mission of Israel embraced in the West. The pogrom in Odessa in 1871 undermined Lilienblum's confidence in the future of the Jews in Russia and intensified his feeling that anti- Semitism was a permanent phenomenon over which the Jews had no con- trol;42 from then on he supported earthly nationalism. Lilienblum opposed Mapu's Russian patriotism,43 demanded "a small piece of land in Turkey,"44 and supported the program of H. Gedaliah for the purchase of Eretz Israel (1876).45 It was only during the years 1878-81 that he again became optimis- tic about the future of the Jews in Russia, stating that this would depend upon how the Jewish problem was explained to the authorities.46 In 1881 he returned to the Haskalah slogans of the 1860s.47 On February 20, 1881, he belittled the rumors of an impending attack on the Jews planned for the approaching Easter holiday, claiming that the Middle Ages were over.48 In the summer of the same year he called for political independence, not because of the new anti-Semitism, but because of the inner longing of the Jewish people. Israel, he said, was a natural nation, and deserved to be a political nation.49 Only in September did Lilienblum come to see the pogroms as the negation of the Haskalah and emancipation.

From March 1882 he engaged in a protracted and bitter debate with Judah Leib Gordon, countering the latter's "maskilic" arguments against Hibbat Zion. There are parallels between the views of David Gordon and those of Judah Leib Gordon, Smolenskin, and Lilienblum, as well as those of Pines and his colleagues. The shared elements outnumber the disputed ones: all of them rejected the various courses taken by Western Jewry, including Ortho- doxy; similarly, they all rejected the entrenched insularity of Eastern Euro- pean Orthodox Jewry. The differences between them arose from their differ- ent points of reference. Closest to the Western position was Smolenskin in Vienna, who was intimately involved in the Haskalah but nontheless criti- cized not only Western Jewry but also the harbinger of the Haskalah, Moses Mendelssohn. The closer someone's point of reference to the West, the more sympathetic he was toward the world he had previously criticized, the world he had left. David Gordon stood on the boundary between the two worlds, and his criticism of both balances out. Lilienblum lived in Odessa and was mainly concerned about the Jews of Russia and their relations with the sur- rounding society; the various manifestations of Western Jewry are reflected in his writings only as a distant echo. As for Pines and his circle, they lived in the very heart of the Pale of Settlement, in Lithuania and Byelorussia. The threat they felt came more from the radical maskilim of Odessa and St. Petersburg than from Geiger and his colleagues in Berlin. Their sense of obligation to their non-Jewish surroundings was weak, and therefore their passage to Eretz Israel in time of trouble was easier. And finally, Judah Leib Gordon lived from 1872 in St. Petersburg, serving as the secretary of the Hevrat Marbei Haskalah; for him, Western Jewry was beyond the horizon. His philosophical struggle ranged between the classical hopes of the "profes- sional" maskil and the frequent disappointments emanating from the nerve center of the Russian government and the Russian intelligentsia.
