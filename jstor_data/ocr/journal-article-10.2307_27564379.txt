Hamburg: Ellert &amp; Richter Verlag, 2006. 296 pp. doi:10.1017/S0364009408001360 For some time now, Thomas Meyer has been one of the more indefatigable researchers and writers in German on themes pertaining to the modern intellectual history of German Jewry. His frequent contributions to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and Die Zeit in particular are gems of historical detail and concision. Now he has published a biography of Ernst Cassirer, and we can be grateful to have such a deeply researched survey of the life and work of this extraordinary philo sopher of the early twentieth century. It is fair to say that Cassirer is not the sort to arouse boundless enthusiasm. Sober, moderate in temperament, politically progressive, but disinclined to contro versy, Cassirer was the very paradigm of the Jewish Bildungsb?rgertum. For the rebellious generation that followed, his temperaments were too staid, too ration alist: Gershom Scholem attended Cassirer's lectures on pre-Socratic philosophy; Benjamin attended the neo-Kantian Heinrich Rickert's lectures. Neither found them inspiring. But Cassirer's philosophical acumen was unmistakable. He was born into a family of merchants in Breslau, where his father was a faithful member of the Jewish community and an active participant in its burial society. About Cassirer's early life, Meyer says very little (except that "puberty brought the usual crisis"). The book takes off only when Cassirer quit the family home for Munich, where he immersed himself in the arts, music, and literature. The passion for culture ran in the Cassirer line: His cousins Paul and Bruno were prominent Berlin art dealers who helped to promote the Berlin Secession and were partly responsible for igniting the Central European passion for French Impressionist and post Impressionist artists, especially Vincent van Gogh and Paul C?zanne. In the winter semester of 1894-95, Cassirer went to Marburg to study with the neo Kantian philosopher Hermann Cohen, known in the Jewish community as "the second Maimonides." Cassirer's early interests followed faithfully in the model of Cohen's transcendental philosophy as a critique of scientific epistemology: His dissertation on "Descartes' critique of mathematical and natural-scientific knowledge" was followed by his first book, "The Scientific Foundations of Leib niz's System," in 1902. Until Cohen's death in April 1918, Meyer tells us, Cassirer and his teacher worked as a "team," despite a strong dissimilarity in philosophical disposition. Unlike Cohen, Cassirer knew little about the Jewish religious tra dition, and, while the Marburgian developed bold theories of ethics and politics, Cassirer cleaved almost exclusively to issues of scientific epistemology; his writ ings on the history of knowledge and theories of scientific method appeared in rapid succession: The Problem of Knowledge in Modern Science and Philosophy (1906), Substance and Function (1910), and Einstein's Theory of Relativity (1921). There are lingering questions to how much Cassirer's difficulties in securing a professorship were due to antisemitism. His habilitation (the German higher postdoctoral degree) was delayed for seven years beyond what was expected, partly because of disapproving comments from Alois Riehl (one of two examiners, 435</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews along with Wilhelm Dilthey), who was himself a strong critic of Hermann Cohen. But Cassirer's career moved forward nonetheless. In 1916 he published Kant 's Life and Work, a graceful synthesis that warrants reading even today; it was surpassed only recently by Manfred Kuehn's biography in 2001. The real breakthrough came in 1919, when Cassirer finally received a perma nent position at Hamburg, where he would remain throughout the 1920s. His new post afforded Cassirer not only security but also inspiration to strike out in new directions. In Hamburg he met Aby Warburg, a wealthy intellectual maverick whose unique library became a model for his own speculations in myth, language, and culture, as presented in his most original philosophical achievement, The Philosophy of Sym bolic Forms, published in three volumes from 1923 to 1929. In March and April of 1929, Cassirer went to Davos, Switzerland, for a now-famous disputation with Martin Heidegger. Meyer's summary of this event is thorough and full of surprises (not least of which are the rare photographs of Cassirer and Heidegger posing on Grand Hotel Belvedere's outer walk). Today, many consider this exchange the begin ning of the end, not only for Cassirer himself but also for the broader tradition of Central European Jewish liberalism, of which he was one of the most prominent representatives. But Meyer is careful to note that after Davos, the two men remained in contact; Heidegger even invited Cassirer to speak at Freiburg in 1931. Nor was Cas sirer at this point the object of antisemitism: for the academic year 1929-30, he was appointed rector at Hamburg. Cassirer was, in fact, the fourth identifiably Jewish academic to hold a rec torship in a German University. But with 1933 came catastrophe. Cassirer was decommissioned from his Hamburg post in accordance with the Third Reich's new racist legislation. (Ironically, it was precisely at the same moment that Heidegger assumed his post as rector at the newly Nazified Freiburg University.) Ernst and his wife Toni now embarked on a series of temporary academic posts, first at All Soul's College in Oxford, then in G?teborg, Sweden, and finally, after a transatlantic crossing by steamship, at Yale University and Columbia. During these final years, Cassirer wrote in English and completed several works, including An Essay on Man, a shorter and more accessible summation of his earlier philosophy of symbolic forms. He had been at Columbia University for less than a year when he collapsed from heart failure on April 13,1945. Among the more surprising images that Meyer has reproduced for the book is a photo of the university's notice announcing two deaths: "Ernst Alfred Cassirer, 1945, Visit ing Prof, of Philosophy" and, right above this, "Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 1882 1945, President of the United States." For Cassirer's burial at Cedar Park Beth El Cemetery (Westwood, New York), the traditional prayer was offered by "a young rabbi and a participant in his course, Arthur Hertzberg." This was followed by music by Mozart. It was a suitable combination for one of the most brilliant scions of Central European Jewry. Meyer's book is full of astonishing detail and is a true joy to read. One can only hope it attracts some attention on this side of the Atlantic. Especially in Germany, interest in Cassirer's philosophical contributions has exploded in the last two decades, taking instruction from the synthetic philosophical treatment by John Michael Krois, Cassirer: Symbolic Forms and Eistory (1987). Krois, 436</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews who now teaches at Humboldt University in Berlin, has been instrumental in calling back to life the ideas of a philosopher that for many years were considered virtually defunct. There were, of course, occasional glimpses of Cassirer's spirit in the English-speaking world: Suzanne Langer 's 1942 Philosophy in a New Key, and Nelson Goodman's 1978 Ways of Worldmaking (the first chapter of which Goodman read at the University of Hamburg on the occasion of Cassirer's hun dredth birthday). These cases aside, serious scholarship on Cassirer in the English-speaking world has been rare indeed. Why this is so deserves some reflection. Perhaps it is attributable to the fact that what counts as "continental philosophy" on this continent continues to draw much of its inspiration from the works of ?migr? intellectuals whose primary focus was pol itical and social thought (Hannah Arendt, Leo Strauss, Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, etc.), while Cassirer's thoughts on politics were comparatively uninspired. His posthumously published The Myth of the State (1946), written during his final phase of exile in the United States, is surely his least successful work. Perhaps it is also because, ever since the famous Davos disputation of 1929, Cassirer's repu tation has seemed irreparably damaged. His interlocutor, Martin Heidegger, cast a strong spell over the audience in Switzerland, and even today it remains a common place view that Cassirer lost not only the debate but also the guarantee of an enduring intellectual legacy. In the postwar era, existentialism and phenomenology gained a significant following in the United States, whereas neo-Kantianism, along with Cassirer's post-neo-Kantian cultural philosophy, seemed nearly forgotten. Not so in Germany. With communism's collapse and the (eventual) success of reunification, a newly moderate strain of cultural philosophy has arisen for which Cassirer is arguably the most formidable representative. New scholarship on Cassirer includes works by Heinz Paetzold, Andreas Graeser, Oswald Schwem mer, Steve Lofts, and Michael Bosch, a critical volume edited by Dorothea Frede and Reinold Schm?cker, and another by Dominic Kaegi and Enno Rudolph. Even J?rgen Habermas has acknowledged his debt to Cassirer in an essay, "The Liberat ing Power of Symbols" (originally in German, 1997). Into this crowd already thick with commentaries arrives Thomas Meyer with his thorough and painstakingly researched biography. It is a welcome addition, and truly indispensable for anyone interested in the details of Cassirer's life and work. Peter E. Gordon Harvard University Boston, Massachusetts</page></plain_text>
