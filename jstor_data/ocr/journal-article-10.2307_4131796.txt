New York: Columbia University Press, 1999. xiv, 337 pp.; Tel Aviv: Ha- Kibbutz Hameuchad, 2002. 304 pp. (Hebrew). Rarely is there such synergy between literary texts and a critic's personal convictions as there is in Yael Feldman's latest book. Strong positions and emo- tional ties often prove a double-edged sword, especially when ideology dictates the interpretation. In the present case, the deep bond between the fictional narratives and the scholar is mostly beneficial, lending Feldman's writing exceptional verve and drama. Feldman skillfully synthesizes modern feminist theories and critical tools with her deep knowledge and understanding of psychological, cultural, and so- 159</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews ciopolitical currents in modern Israel. The detailed discussions of two feminist precursors, Virginia Woolf and Simone de Beauvoir, may be needed more in the Hebrew edition of the book than in the English. To feminist critics in this country, the works of these two writers are well-trodden fields, underlying much of femi- nist scholarship of the 1970s and early 1980s. The undeniable necessity of this dis- cussion in the Hebrew edition is in itself a cultural comment, proving that Israeli feminist criticism, as well as feminist fiction, has lagged behind European and American trends. Feldman has set out to correct this obvious gap with a study focusing on the fiction of five Israeli women writers: Shulamit Lapid, Amalia Kahana-Carmon, Shulamith Hareven, Netiva Ben Yehuda, and Ruth Almog. Her research agenda is ambitious: she scrutinizes the Hebrew works in the light of recent European and American theories of gender and literary creativity, attempting to find out whether and how the Israeli fiction conforms to paradigms set forth in other social and cul- tural climates. She examines the extent to which the Hebrew examples, bred in an environment plagued by a geopolitical and psychological state of siege, add a new wrinkle to these theories. She also uncovers the feminist intertexts in some of these writings, which Israeli criticism has failed to recognize. Women's liberation as a political movement has had its roots in the modern ideas of enlightenment and progress. On the face of it, modern feminist writings should be enhanced by both modern egalitarian ideas and the postmodern spirit, which is committed to re-reading Western history and literary canon from an off- center vantage point, giving voice to the rejected and the marginal. But things did not work out as neatly as these formulas would suggest. First, as Feldman explains, postmodernism also postulates the fictiveness of the autonomous subject and as such the feminist claim for autonomy within the postmodern context is problem- atic in itself. Secondly, in the particular context of Zionist and Israeli mentality, the plot thickens: the suppression of the individual voice in preference of the collective "we," part of labor Zionist ideology and the pressing needs of a nation-building process, has been a problem encountered by both male and female Hebrew writ- ers. But it has especially complicated the dilemma of women writers struggling to emerge from both a long tradition that silenced the woman's voice and a new ide- ological and political reality, which demands the surrender of individual creativi- ty to the national effort and the shared collective destiny. Feldman asks why women writers such as Shulamit Lapid or Amalia Kahana-Carmon were unable to create a female Kiinstlerroman, "a portrait of the artist as a young woman." The answer, she says, lies in a combination of the marginal role of women in Jewish history and literary tradition, which has produced an insecure female artistic ego, and the overwhelming national narrative which has been the driving force of both male and female writings. The writer Ruth Almog, who published thinly veiled autobi- ographical stories in 1969 and 1979, felt guilty that she allowed herself to become immersed in her own internal life when "larger" issues of national importance dominated public life and discourse. In her study of Shulamit Lapid's widely popular novel Gei Oni (the story of the Galilean settlement Rosh Pinah) Feldman identifies the strategy employed by 160</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews the novelist to correct the gender imbalance in Israeli historical narrative. The welding of two genres, she says, has enabled the writer to reconstruct nostalgical- ly an era imprinted in the national memory with heroic masculinity and at the same time insert the female voice and presence and thus speak to a more "feminist" age. Feldman places Ruth Almog's Roots of Air (ShorsheiAvir) within the mod- ern critical and literary corpus, which has reread and rewritten Charlotte Bront 's Jane Eyre with a feminist twist. She sees Jean Rhys' novel, Wide Sargasso Sea (in which the heroine is Mr. Rochester's insane first wife, a marginal character in Jane Eyre) as a direct influence on Almog's novel, especially in its treatment of female madness. Feldman raises many important issues, too numerous to discuss in this re- view. She meticulously maps out the diverse theories and sub-theories of gender and creativity that have sprung up in the past several decades. Her extensive dis- cussions of literary paradigms and critical theories are nicely balanced by direct interpretive encounters with the fiction itself. Finally, one cannot but reflect on the leap that modern Israeli criticism has made from Baruch Kurzweil to Yael Feldman. Kurzweil's critical essays, brilliant, often groundbreaking and polemical, showed disregard for any system of schol- arly documentation, referencing, and attribution. Yael Feldman's study is a model of painstaking canvassing and classifying of a large body of theories pertaining to questions of gender and the creative process; charting their philosophical, socio- historical, and psychological roots; and uncovering their universality as well as limitations when applied to women's fiction in Hebrew. No Room of Their Own is a major contribution to both the study of Hebrew fiction and critical theory. It deals masterfully with fascinating stories within their local environment while also plac- ing them within an international cultural framework and critical discourse.
