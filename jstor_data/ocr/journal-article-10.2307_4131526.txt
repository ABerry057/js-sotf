And, even after the professionalization of medicine in the thirteenth century, Chris- tian physicians continued to look to the Bible, in addition to their license, as the source of their authority.3 Indeed, many Christian physicians who received med- ical degrees went on to pursue higher degrees in theology.4 It is therefore not sur- prising that several Christian theologians used medical theories in the service of theology.5 This nexus between science and faith was not limited to Christianity. Al- though Jews were excluded from universities, some aspiring Jewish physicians 1.

In fact, Kabbalah emerges contempo- raneously with the rediscovery of Galen and Aristotle in the Latin West, and some thirteenth-century kabbalists endeavored to discern divine secrets with the aid of this new knowledge. There is, however, no such thing as knowledge in the abstract. Michel Fou- cault has taught us that no knowledge exists outside of the confines of a given cul- tural context.8 And the inequality of the sexes in medieval culture9 expressed itself in medieval men's medical and theological conceptions of women.10 The mystical rationales for the laws of the menstruating woman are a case in point. In Leviticus, menstruants were deemed ritually impure for cultic practice (15:19) and prohibit- ed to their husbands in a catalog of forbidden sexual relations (20:18). After the 6.

Isaac the Blind (1165-1235), one of the first kabbalists in Provence, and Nahmanides (1194-1270), the leader of the Jew- ish community in Barcelona, both used medieval natural philosophy and science in the service of kabbalistic theology to explain the mystical secret inherent in this prohibition. Isaac the Blind adopts a Galenic model of menstruation to locate the menstruating woman within the sefirah of Judgment, the locus of evil in the se- firotic realm. Nahmanides, by contrast, uses an Aristotelian model with far more devastating results: medieval medicine, natural philosophy, and Kabbalah rein- force one another to create an image of the menstruating woman as the human in- carnation of the demonic other side (sitra' '"ahra'). Isaac the Blind and The Origin of Menstrual Blood The Mishnah identifies five different types of impure menstrual blood. These flow from the "room," or "fountain" (makor), terms traditionally used for the uterus." In one of the earliest kabbalistic discussions of gynecology, Isaac the Blind refines this anatomical description, defining the term makor as the left sec- tion of the uterus. According to this reading, impure menstrual blood, described by the Mishnah as coming from the makor, flows not from the entire womb but rather from the left section alone. Isaac explains that only sinister blood is impure be- cause "all things which come from the left, the side of stern Judgment, are gov- erned by impurity, as it is written, 'from the North shall evil break loose"' (Jer. 1:14).12 The menstrual flow is thus the material manifestation of the powers of stern Judgment; its red hue reflects the fiery color of its source. Isaac the Blind's theology of menstruation demonstrates a nexus among kab- balistic theosophy, medicine, and natural philosophy. Medieval scientific attitudes toward menstruation were governed by ancient Greek science and philosophy. The low esteem in which women were held in Ancient Greece expressed itself in con- temporary gynecology in a dichotomy of left and right.'3 In his article, "On the Pre-eminence of the Right Hand," Robert Hertz explains that dualism was essen- tial to the social organization of developing societies. "On the one side, there is the pole of strength, good, and life, while on the other there is the pole of weakness and evil ...

The right rep- resented everything sacred, strong, and male, while the left represented the pro- fane, weak, and female.'5 This assumption was implicit in Greek culture and became the basis of Hel- lenistic medical conceptions of sexual differentiation.16 For example, the Hippo- cratic Superfetation explains that the right and left testicles emit semen independently. Semen emitted from the left testicle engenders females, and semen from the right, males. Other Hippocratic writings suppose that sex is determined by the placement of the seed in the uterus. If seed is placed on the left side of the uterus, the child will be female; if placed on the right, the child will be male. 7 Lat- er, Galen supplies physiological justification for Hippocrates' understanding of sexual differentiation. Hippocrates assumed that the human womb, like the wombs of other mammals, contained two or more pockets. Aristotle compared the womb to testicles and concluded that the uterus must also be made up of two parts.'8 Galen believed that the chambers of the uterus correspond to the number of teats. Since women have two breasts, the human uterus has two distinct cavities, a right and a left.19 The right side of the uterus receives cleansed blood from the large blood vessels, the vena cava and the "artery from the great artery," while the left side of the uterus receives bloods that "do not start from the great vessels them- selves, but from the vessels passing through the kidneys." Galen explains that "the left testis in the male and the left uterus in the female receive blood still uncleansed, full of residues, watery and serous, and so it happens that the temperaments of the instruments themselves that receive the blood become different. For just as full blood is warmer than blood full of residues, so too the instruments on the right side, nourished with pure blood, become warmer than those on the left."20 The sex of the child is thus determined by the conditions in which the seed grows.

Qual- itative differences between men and women, therefore, begin in utero. Males are engendered from superior material, in warm and dry conditions, on the highly val- ued right side of the uterus, while women are created from residue in the cold and wet left. Women's inferiority is thus explained biologically. These Hippocratic and Galenic ideas on sexual differentiation are absent in the Talmud.2' Rather, the rabbis present an understanding of sexual differentiation akin to that of Democrites and Aristotle. Many ancient physicians believed that both men and women possess generative seed that combines to create a fetus. Male seed is semen while female seed is either menstrual blood or the vaginal fluid emit- ted during sexual arousal.22 Democrites asserted that sex is determined by which of these seeds prevails in the uterus after sexual intercourse.23 Aristotle maintains Democrites' essentially "combative model" of sexual differentiation, yet denies the existence of generative female seed.24 Semen alone generates the form of the fe- tus, whereas menstrual blood merely provides the material. Aristotle compares this process to making cheese: just as rennet curdles milk to create cheese, male seed creates the child out of female matter. Thus, rather than attribute sexual differ- entiation to the interaction of two types of seed, Aristotle attributes it to the kind of nourishment available to the child in utero. Semen, being form, will strengthen the fetus and create a male, while menstrual blood, being material, provides nour- ishment sufficient only to create a female. Gender depends upon which type of nourishment prevails. "If the male semen gains mastery, it brings [the material menstrual blood] over to itself" engendering a male. "If it [semen] gets mastered, it changes over either into its opposite [a female] or else into extinction."25 The Talmud explains that ifa woman emits her seed first, the child will be male, where- as if the male emits his seed first the child will be a female. Although the rabbis cite a biblical proof text as their source, they seem in fact to present a simplified version of the Democrites and Aristotle. When the first emission of seed is over- shadowed by the second, the second sex prevails.26 21.

Note that the Talmud does not systematically follow Aristotelian biological theory. For example, B. Nidah 321</page><page sequence="6">Sharon Faye Koren Isaac the Blind uses this biological theory to interpret theosophical myster- ies. Sefer Yezirah (Book of Creation), for example, classifies the Hebrew letters 'aleph, mem, and shin as the "three mothers of the alphabet." God seals the male with the combination 'emesh (wux) and the female with 'asham (twx). Commen- tators undertook to explain why the male is identified with the combination 'aleph, mem, shin and the female with the 'aleph, shin, mem, that is to say, why the inver- sion of the letters should determine a change in gender. Isaac the Blind finds his answer in the talmudic theory of sexual differentiation. Just as a woman's seed is the first component emitted in the production of a male child, the female element 'esh (fire), associated with the letter shin, is the first element in the creation of a male, producing the term 'asham.27 Just as a man's seed is the first component emitted in the production of a female child, the male element, mayim, associated with the letter mem, is the first element in the creation of a female, producing the term 'emesh.28 Isaac the Blind offers another interpretation of the rabbinic theory of sexu- al differentiation to justify the purity laws of the parturient. He compares the strug- gle between the male and female seeds in the uterus to the conflict between Judgment and Mercy in the sefirotic realm. When a woman emits her impure red seed first, the pure, white, male seed will prevail. White will prevail over red, right over left, and Mercy over Judgment, and a male child will be born. Because puri- ty triumphs, the parturient remains impure for only seven days. When, however, a man's pure white seed is emitted first, it comes under the domination of impure red female seed; here, red will prevail over white, impurity over purity, Judgment over Mercy, and a female child will be born. The parturient will remain under the influence of the dominant impure forces for fourteen days.29 The Talmud was not Isaac the Blind's only source of medical knowledge. He also drew upon contemporary scientific theory. Though not a physician himself, Isaac the Blind lived near one of the greatest centers of medical learning in Me- dieval Europe, the College of Montpelier. Although Jews were officially forbidden to matriculate, many Jews studied with members of the faculty independently. Moreover, his father, Abraham ben David, had written Ba'alei ha-nefesh, a guide to proper sexual behavior influenced by contemporary Christian attitudes toward sexuality.30 It is therefore likely that Isaac was familiar with popular medical ideas. 3 1a presents the Galenic idea that both men and women emit seed that contribute to the development of the fetus. Male seed is sperm, which generates the child's bone, sinews, nails, brain, and the whites of the eyes. Female seed is menstrual blood, which engenders skin, flesh, blood, hair, and the pupils of the eye. 27. The element fire is intrinsic to the sefirah of Judgment. Women, who are created in Judg- ment, are therefore hewn from this elemental fire. Isaac of Acre Sefer me'irat 'einayim 154. 28.

For a different under- 322</page><page sequence="7">Kabbalistic Physiology Greek medicine remained influential long after the ancient period. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Syrian Christians began to translate Greek medical texts and the Septuagint into Syriac. Expelled by the Byzantine Church, Nestorian Christians from Syria found refuge in Iran, where they quickly built a school and a hospital. The Muslims who captured Persia in 636 appreciated the Nestorian ef- fort and encouraged translation of Syriac medical works into Arabic. Galen exert- ed greater influence on Arabic medicine than Hippocrates, Soranus, or Aristotle.31 His gynecological theories were systematically codified in Arabic medical treatis- es and later transmitted to medieval Europe by means of Latin translations.32 Con- stantine the African was the first to introduce Galenic gynecology to the Latin West in his Pantegni, a translation of al Majusi's Al Kunnas al Maliki.33 By the twelfth century, Galenic gynecology was the standard in medical education and the oppo- sition between the right and left chambers of the uterus became established in the medieval scientific imagination.34 Since a number of the translators were Jewish (the most notable being the standing, see Harry Friedenwahl, "Jews and the University of Montpelier," in The Jews and Medicine: Essays (New York: KTAV, 1967), 241-252. On Abraham ben David's receptivity to Christian ideas, see Jeremy Cohen, "Rationales for Conjugal Sex in RABaD's Ba'alei ha-Nefesh," Jewish History 6 (1992): 65-78. 31. Monica Green explains that "Galen's triumph in gynecology was due in a large part not to anything having to do with gynecology per se, but rather to his overwhelming preeminence in medi- cine in general-a preeminence which was itself due to the appealingly systematic and even symmet- rical form of his medical theories."

To be sure, Western Eu- ropeans did not completely abandon the medical sciences in the early Middle Ages. Medical works were translated in North Africa and Ravenna. Yet the scope of these studies was more limited. Western European physicians valued the practical use of medicine over its theoretical study and were therefore more attracted to Soranus than to Galen. Only four of Galen's works were translated into Latin before the eleventh century and only one of these, Ad Glauconem, mentions the uterus. Green, "Female Phys- iology and Disease," 130-173. 33. M.

This understanding gave rise to a belief in a seven chambered uterus: three on the right, three on the left, and one in the middle. The odd number of chambers gave rise to a third gender pos- sibility-the hermaphrodite. This theory is found in the Pseudo-Aristotelian De Spermate, popular in the Latin West in the twelfth century. On the development of this theory, see Friedolf Kudlien, "The Seven Cells of the Uterus: The Doctrine and its Roots," Bulletin of the History ofMedicine 39 (1965): 415-423; Siraisi, Medieval and Early Renaissance Medicine, 91-96. Jews were also familiar with this theory. As early as the fourteenth century, the exegete David ben Yehudah he-Hasid describes the sev- en chambers of the uterus, claiming that he learned of the theory from an unidentified Ga'on and ibn 'Ezra.

The reverse of this situation only happens exceptionally.""37 Just as Isaac the Blind used Talmudic medicine to support his theosophical exegesis, he adapted medieval gynecological theories to fit his kabbalistic needs. The dichotomy between right and left is ubiquitous in Kabbalah.38 The left was de- nominated feminine, impure, and evil, while the right was denominated male, pure, and good. The Galenic theory of the bicameral uterus offers biological evidence for this kabbalistic precept. Thus Isaac the Blind fuses Galen's anatomical theory with talmudic tradition and restricts the rabbinic definition of the term makor, the source of impure menstrual blood, to the left section of the uterus. The sinister se- firah of Judgment, like the left chamber of the uterus, becomes the repository of uncleansed impure blood that contributes to the engenderment of female children. Just as the medical theory that women are produced on the left side of the uterus supports philosophical conceptions of female inferiority, the belief that women and menstrual blood originate in the left chamber of the uterus supports the kabbalis- tic belief in the evil nature of the nidah.39 35.

A fetus can be created only out of pure female blood. Menstruating women therefore cannot contribute to the ma- terial creation of a fetus because their blood is impure.40 Indeed, "how could men- strual blood create a fetus when it is itself a deadly poison that can kill any living being who drinks or eats it?"41 Any fetus that actually eats menstrual poison will die; any trace of menstrual blood in the uterus will inflict either leprosy or boils. The Torah therefore forbids sexual relations with menstruating women because they cannot engender healthy offspring.42 Nahmanides then shifts the emphasis of his commentary from the "medical risks" of menstrual blood to the dangers of the nidah (menstruant) herself. Nah- manides reports that a menstruant who gazes into a ferrous mirror at the beginning of her flow will cause red drops, like drops of blood, to appear on the metal. "For the harmful and evil nature of the issue produces an odor and this foul air attach- es to the mirror just as a basilisk kills with its gaze." This evil influence may infect a man just as it does a mirror, and contaminate his mind and body. Nahmanides reads this notion into his Torah commentary interpreting the Levitical phrase "her nidah will be upon him-" as Biblical proof for menstrual contagion.43 Nahmanides supports his claim on the basis of empirical evidence, stressing that these powers are not folkloric fantasies but "actual experiences." He consid- ers the menstruous gaze "one of most miraculous works in nature"44 and warns of the very real danger of menstrual pollution. In his commentary on Leviticus 20:18-If a man lies with a woman in her infirmity and uncovers her nakedness, he has laid bare her flow and she has exposed her blood flow-Nahmanides ex- plains that the menstruating woman is like a fountain (makor) of blood that must not be exposed lest she spew forth her evil and destructive waters. She is therefore taboo to "the holy seed" (Isa. 6:13) for all the days of her impurity, until she im- merses herself in water, for only then will she be purified in her mind and body and become completely clean.45 Nahmanides' focus on the dangers of the menstruant in his Torah commen- 40.

Leviticus 15 lists four cate- gories of people with issue-the man with an abnormal discharge (zav), the ejac- ulant, the menstruant (nidah), and the woman with abnormal discharge (zavah)- who are barred from the Temple cult because of the demands of ritual purity. The priestly authors, however, only explicitly describe the zav and the zavah as ritual- ly impure (tam'e). This absence is not an oversight. Rather, it likely reflects the priestly authors' reaction to the practices of other Near Eastern Cults who believed that menstruants were dangerous because they were possessed by impure spirits.46 Indeed, according to Leviticus 15:20-25, menstrual blood contaminates, not the menstruant. She renders impure only that which lies beneath her-that is, objects that could become polluted by menstrual blood. Thus, in contrast to other Near Eastern cultic leaders, who concentrated on exorcising spirits of impurity from the polluted, Israelite priests distanced impurity from the menstruant herself to the items that she touched, partly in order to suppress the notion that her impurity con- stituted any kind of possession or contagion.47 Nahmanides' Torah commentary is unusual among his writings in its treat- ment of nidot. His Hilkhot nidah and his Hidushim 'al masekhet nidah show no disparagement of menstruating women.48 Moreover, Nahmanides was a physi- cian, and we know that he treated gynecological problems.49 Elsewhere he de- scribes the menstrual flow as a natural "cleansing of surpluses [of blood]" and disagrees with R. Solomon ben Isaac and Abraham ibn Ezra, who suggest that menstruation is a sickness.50 How could Nahmanides, a physician with medical 46.

Rather than dissuade Nahmanides, his scientific education was precisely what introduced him to the concept of the menstruous eye. During the course of the thirteenth century, gynecological theory shifted from the Galenic tradition to the Aristotelian, with unhappy consequences for the status of women in both Jew- ish and Christian society.51 Nahmanides, thirty years Isaac's junior, incorporated these new ideas into both his Torah commentary and into his sermon Torat ha-shem temimah to support his theology.52 Aristotle believed that females were "incomplete males."53 Maleness was the norm and femaleness a "lack of maleness." Men represented active, spiritual form; women represented passive, material matter.54 Among ancient authors, Aris- totle alone denied that women produce seed. Aristotle also construed menstruation differently. Most Greek physicians believed that menstruation had a purgative function. Hippocrates, for example, believed that women, being spongier than men, cannot expel fluids easily and must therefore menstruate. Men can expel waste by other means.55 Galen similarly explains that men are warmer than women and therefore better able to purge themselves of superfluous fluids through phys- ical activity, perspiration, and excretion. Women, whose humor is cold, must men- struate in order to excrete excess fluid and maintain their humoral balance.56 Here, too, the menstrual flow is purgative.57 Aristotle, however, takes a different ap- ogy, see Sefer ha-nisyonot: the Book of Medical Experiences Attributed to Abraham Ibn Ezra, ed. and trans. J. O. Leibowitz and S. Marcus (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, Hebrew University, 1984), 221-257. 51. Aristotle's biological ideas were probably no more sexist in conception than those of his contemporaries. No Greek philosopher thought well of women. However, the prestige of Aristotle also contributed to his broad influence, and his biological theories fueled antifeminist arguments in other disciplines. For example, in his Politics, Aristotle writes that "the relation of male to female is natural- ly that of the superior to the inferior-of the ruling to the ruled."

Amenorrhea was therefore considered very unhealthy because it results in the retention of waste. Note that Avicenna does not believe that amenorrhea is a sign of illness. Rather, he argues that some very strong women are more like men and are able to purge themselves of excess blood through 327</page><page sequence="12">Sharon Faye Koren proach. He understands blood to be bodily nourishment, and deduces that blood not used as nourishment becomes bodily residue. Men, who are hot and dry, are able to convert this residue into a generative force, that is, semen, whereas in women, who are cold and wet, it remains "unconcocted" and must be excreted in the form of menstrual blood.58 Menstrual blood is, therefore, a manifestation of female incapacity. The "menstruous gaze" that Nahmanides reports emerges from this Aris- totelian view. In Aristotle's treatise On Dreams, we read that menstruation afflicts the entire female body. Because the eyes contain so many blood vessels, they are particularly susceptible to this "feverish disorder of the blood." Hence, a fiction about the ocular powers of the menstruant: "Just as that which is heated and be- comes hot may heat something else in turn, one not only sees, but the very act of seeing creates an effect."59 Therefore: if a woman looks into a highly polished mirror during the menstrual period, the surface of the mirror becomes clouded with a blood-red color (and if the mirror is a new one the stain is not easy to remove, but if it is an old one there is less difficulty) . . . The reason for this is that . .. when menstruation takes place, as a result of a feverish disorder of the blood, the difference of condi- tion in the eyes, though invisible to us, is none the less real; and the eyes set up a movement in the air. This imparts a certain quality to the layer of air ex- tending over the mirror, and assimilates it to itself; and this layer becomes the surface of the mirror.60 This fiction was a fruitful one. Pliny, for example, claimed that menstruants could dull mirrors.61 In the middle ages, the menstruant was explicitly associated with the basilisk, a poisonous serpent whose glance or breath was believed to cause exercise, medicine, nosebleeds, or other wounds.

In On the Generation ofAnimals, Aristotle claims that menstrual blood is distinct from other bloods in the body. It is a residue that the womb collects during the course of the month. Accordingly, menstrual blood would neither cause a "general disturbance" in the blood nor a swelling in the body. Moreover, Dean-Jones argues that there was no menstrual taboo in classical Greek society. Menstruat- ing woman were not scorned any more than nonmenstruating women. For example, Aristotle and Hip- pocrates encourage men to have sexual intercourse with menstruants. Dean-Jones therefore concludes that this excerpt was originally a gloss in the margins and was interpolated into the text in the Hel- lenistic period. She asserts that men introduced menstrual taboos in the Hellenistic period in order to subjugate an increasingly liberated class of women.

Both the basilisk and the menstruant emit their poison through their eyes and corrupt the air. The air then transmits the poison into the eyes of others. After the thirteenth-century rediscovery of Aristotle in the Latin West, nat- ural philosophers conflated the popular association of the menstruant and the basilisk with the account of the menstruant in On Dreams. Albertus Magnus, for example, explained that because the eye is a very passive organ, menstrual flow can easily infect the eyes of a menstruant and emit a vapor that infects everything she sees.63 Associating menstruants with basilisks, he warns his readers to "to be- ware of every woman as one would avoid a venomous serpent and a horned dev- il."64 The Secrets of Women, a popular treatise erroneously attributed to Albertus Magnus, expatiates upon the dangers of the menstrual eye: It should be noted that old women who still have their monthly flow, and some who do not menstruate, poison the eyes of children lying in their cradles by their glance ... This is caused in menstruating women by the flow itself, for the hu- mors first infect the eyes, then the eyes infect the air, which infects the child. This is the opinion of the philosopher in the book on Sleeping and Waking.65 The text goes on to associate the menstruant with the basilisk remarking that menopausal women are particularly venomous because they cannot purge them- selves of their bodily toxin.66 All women are said to emit menstrual poison through 62. Medieval bestiaries drew upon the Roman and Hellenistic legends of the basilisk. On the basilisk, see Pliny Natural History 8:33, 57; Aelian On Animals 2:7:97. In the 1180s, Neckham claimed that the basilisk was born out of a cock's egg. The egg was first formed from the waste matter of the kidneys and sexual organs and later developed in the intestine of a five- or six-year-old male chicken. Neckham based his understanding on Aristotle, who claimed that older roosters develop a substance resembling an egg underneath their midriff. This myth fostered the confusion between the basilisk and the cockatrice. T. H.

The text draws a further connection between serpents and women: "If the hair of a men- struating woman be taken and placed under a dung heap or clod of earth or where dung was made dur- ing the winter or summer by virtue of the sun there, will be engendered a long and powerful snake." Jacquart and Thomasset, Sexuality and Medicine, 76.

This method of transmission corresponds to medieval notions of contagion believed to be an ef- fect of corrupted air. Menstruation thus becomes a communicable disease to which the menstruant alone is invulnerable, for she, like the basilisk and other snakes, is immune to her own poison.67 Thus by the thirteenth century, the focus of physi- cians and natural scientists has shifted from a purgative to a polluting function of the menstrual flow.68 This understanding informs Nahmanides' Torah commentary.69 While the Talmud often associates women, menstruants, and snakes70 and mentions magical ocular powers,7' Aristotelian natural philosophy influenced Nahmanides com- mentary on Leviticus. In his only other disparagement of menstruants in his Torah commentary, he cites "ancient philosophers" as his source for the menstruous eye. He explains that Rachel does not rise to greet her father Laban because in ancient days menstruants kept themselves very isolated. They were de- scribed as niddot (the banned ones) because they neither approached nor spoke with people. For the ancients in their wisdom knew that their breath is harm- ful, their gaze is injurious and makes a bad impression, as the philosophers have explained. I will mention their experience in this matter in the future. 72 Moreover, in his famous sermon, "Torat ha-shem temimah," in which he justifies the use of science for the service of Torah, Nahmanides states that the laws "pro- hibiting marital relations with his wife-that is, in the days of her menstruation- is due to natural law." And, at the end of the section on menstruants, he quotes from 67. Jacquart and Thomasset, Sexuality and Medicine, 75, 129. This understanding gave rise to the myth of the venomous Virgin, a tale that Jacquart and Thomasset describe as "the literary justifi- cation for the fear of the poison within women's bodies." Ibid., 191-192; cf., the medieval commen- taries to Lemay, Women's Secrets, 130-131. Drawing upon Aristotle, Paracelcus explains that imagination was a celestial force that was able to lift man to the divine realm. Imagination is a mag- netic force that the imaginer draws into himself and then impresses upon another person. The female imagination can be transformed into a spirit that acts by means of its material manifestation-men- strual blood. This menstrual spirit can cause an epidemic. Pagel, Paracelcus, 122. Thomas Liibler, known as Erastus of Baden (1523-1583) denounced Paracelcus' understanding of the power of men- struants, explaining that spirits cannot emerge from the eyes of the menstruating woman, nor can men- strual blood be harmful because it provides the original matter for the fetus.

There are two distinct superstitions known as the evil eye: 1) the belief that some people are able to harm others at a glance, and 2) the belief that jealous demons will begrudge men all forms of happiness. Men endeavor to protect themselves against this second form by disguising good fortune or by use of prophylactic amulets and phrases (Trachtenberg, Jewish Magic and Superstition, 54-56). See also Rivka Kern Ulmer, "The Power of the Evil Eye and the Good Eye," Judaism 40 (1991): 344-353; idem, The Evil Eye in the Bible and Rabbinic Literature (Hoboken, NJ: Ktav, 1994). 72. Nahmanides' commentary to Gen. 31:35, 2:177. 330</page><page sequence="15">Kabbalistic Physiology his biblical commentary and specifies Aristotle as the author of the menstruous eye, stating: There is also a natural manifestation of the [harmful effect of menstrual blood]. Aristotle has written in his book-and it is a true experience-that if, at the beginning of her issue, a menstruant woman were to intently concen- trate her gaze upon a glass mirror, there would be appear on the glass a red spot resembling a drop of blood as large as a grain of mustard. Now if [the im- age of the blood] cleaves to the glass, how much more will it cleave to the child, the power thereof being as that of a viper which slays by sight.73 Thus Nahmanides not only identifies Aristotle as his source, but, like Albertus Magnus, draws upon medieval folklore to call menstrual blood a lethal poison and compare the gaze of the nidah to the gaze of a basilisk. This notion contributes to an etiology of leprosy. Both Jewish and Christian traditions had long associated menstruation with inflammatory skin conditions but no previous Jewish source offered an explicit physiological explanation for the cor- relation.74 Once menstrual blood is understood to be a poison, the link becomes clear: a dose of poison will kill an embryo and the slightest trace will affect fetal development. The exterior skin illness becomes nature's way of ridding the body of the dangerous blood and poison.75 Moreover, medieval physicians did not dis- tinguish between leprosy and venereal disease because leprosy was perceived as a punishment for sexual excess.76 Sexual relations with menstruants, a form of sex- 73.

An incorrect Latin translation of IV Ezra produced an association between menstruating women and monstrous births in the Christian tradition. The original Hebrew or Aramaic reads, "women will give birth to monsters" as a harbinger of the end of days. The Latin translation reads "mulieres parient menstruatae monstra," that is, "menstruating women give birth to monsters." Thus the Council of Nicea (325 CE) warned that husbands who ap- proach their menstruating wives risk elephantiasis and leprosy for themselves and their unborn chil- dren.

He explains that scientific knowledge-defined here as that knowledge that is grounded in ob- servation of the phenomena, especially as this stands in contrast to knowledge that is received through the Jewish tradition or extracted from the very texts of Torah-has a certain validity. However, empirical study of the natural world, detached from any metaphysical, other-worldly considerations, is in the opinion of Nahmanides, simply not a very worthwhile undertaking.79 Why then does Nahmanides adopt contemporary medical and scientific concep- tions of menstruants and why do these conceptions figure only in his Torah com- mentary and in his Sermon "Torat ha-shem temimah?" The Menstruous Eye and Kabbalah Nahmanides believed that the Torah contained divine secrets. Consequent- ly, his Torah exegesis, rather than his legal writing, became the main venue for his kabbalistic interpretations. This methodology explains his unique treatment of menstruants in his exegetical works. In his halakhic and medical material, Nah- manides interprets menstruation as a physical condition and portrays menstruation as a natural state of being; in his Torah commentary and in his sermon, by contrast, he incorporates Aristotelian natural philosophy and folklore in the service of his mystical theology to allude to the kabbalistic mystery of menstruation.80 77. Although officially forbidden, many Christians did engage in sexual relations with men- struants. By the thirteenth century, the church itself softened its stance. For example, while many Do- minicans believed that married couples who engaged in sexual relations during menstruation sinned, they lessened the degree of sinfulness from mortal to venial (Dyan Elliot, Spiritual Marriage [Prince- ton: Princeton University Press, 1993], 150-151); see also Payer, The Bridling of Desire, 106. 78.

Idel argues that Nah- manides was a conservative kabbalist who would refer only to received kabbalistic traditions, unlike Isaac the Blind and his Geronese students, Ezra and Azriel, who incorporated philosophical ideas into kabbalistic traditions and reduced their beliefs to writing. Nonetheless, in order to maintain his own traditions in the face of the growing influence of the Geronese School, Nahmanides inserted some es- oteric interpretations into his Torah commentary (Idel, "We have no Kabbalistic Tradition," 51-73; idem, "Nahmanides: Kabbalah, Halakhah and Spiritual Leadership" in Jewish Mystical Leaders and Leadership in the Thirteenth Century, ed.

Wolfson, by contrast, believes that Nahmanides had a more innovative approach to biblical exegesis and a defined hermeneutical method (Elliot Wolfson, "'By Way of Truth,'" AJS Review 14 [1989]: 103-178). 332</page><page sequence="17">Kabbalistic Physiology Kabbalists believed that everything in the terrestrial world reflects the divine realm. Thus, the human being reflected a sefirotic realm symbolically conceived of as primordial man. Studying human physiology was, therefore, a means to un- derstanding divine processes.8s Kabbalists, moreover, were particularly interested in purity laws because physical purity was essential for mystical pursuits.82 Indeed, Nahmanides directly associates the need for menstrual separation and mystical pursuits in his sermon "Torat ha-shem temimah," where he immediately follows his discussion of the ocular power of menstruants with a discourse on "the wisdom 'that is hidden from the eyes of all living and is broader that the sea,' " that is, the Kabbalah.g3 Moreover, in his Torah commentary, Nahmanides mentions the re- strictions of the Beraita de Massakhet Niddah, a spurious Tosefta document dated to Geonic Palestine that enumerated the dangers of menstruants and barred them from the sancta.84 Thus Nahmanides' understanding of menstruants is not solely a product of his adaptation of Aristotelian natural philosophy. Rather, his incorpo- ration of medieval scientific ideas dovetails on notions about menstruants already extant in the Jewish tradition, and he uses both of these in his Torah commentary to throw light on the mystery of the menstruating woman. Nahmanides usually introduces a kabbalistic tradition with the words "by way of truth." In his commentary on Leviticus 18:19, however, he compares the 81.

Nah- manides believed that miracles demonstrated divine knowledge, providence, and creatio ex nihilo, and these he considered divine mysteries.85 For example, he be- lieved that creation out of nothing refers to creation from "ayin (nothing), the point through which the sefirotic world was created. His classification of the menstru- ous eye as a miracle may likewise refer to a divine secret.86 Moreover, Nahmanides believed that the laws of forbidden sexual relations-which include sexual rela- tions with menstruants-were kabbalistic mysteries.87 The Bible states that a man who has sexual relations with a menstruating woman is punished by karet, a tech- nical term which literally means extirpation, but which the Rabbis interpret as pre- mature death. Kabbalists believed that the punishment refers instead to the destruction of the soul. Most of the thirty-six transgressions that carry this penal- ty are sexual in nature. Because sexual misdeeds bring forth inviable offspring, the sexual transgressor is repaid in kind: just as he extirpates the life of a potential soul, his own soul will be extirpated through karet.88 Nahmanides alludes to an association between sexual misdeeds and karet in his Torah commentary. Leviticus states that those who engage in forbidden sexu- al relations are exiled from the land of Israel. Why sexual transgression should be punished by exclusion from the land becomes clear when the verse is deciphered kabbalistically. Nahmanides interprets the land of Israel in two ways: literally and kabbalistically as the Shekhinah. One who engages in illicit sexual activity is lit- erally expelled from the land of Israel and symbolically from the Shekhinah.89 He who engages in sexual relations with a menstruating woman, the last of the cata- log of illicit sexual relations, is punished by the far more serious penalty of karet, extirpation.90 Exile allows the possibility of return; karet is permanent. By analo- gy, we may infer that Nahmanides would consider one who engages in sexual re- lations with menstruants as forever cut off from communion with the Shekhinah.91 The Menstruant, Sod ha-'ibur and Gilgul Later kabbalists were troubled by the idea that the soul, the divine element in man, could be destroyed. In order to save the soul from complete annihilation, kabbalists conceived of the idea of metempsychosis (gilgul), whereby a guilty soul could transmigrate through other bodies as penance.92 Nahmanides alludes to this 85.

A man who has relations with a menstruous woman will trans- migrate into a Gentile woman, one who has sexual relations while in the con- dition of nidah.97 The author of the Sefer ha-kanah offers an alternative and suggests that one who has sexual relations with a menstruating woman may transmigrate after death into the body of a leper, a punishment particularly suited to the crime: when a woman is a nidah, she is outside and distanced. When one has rela- tions with her, he causes all the impurities to enter the Hekhal. He will there- fore return to earth as a leper who sits alone, banned like a nidah, outside of the camp. One who transgresses any of the laws of forbidden sexual relations is liable to the punishment of karet and the nidah comprises all of the 'ara- yot.98 Beyond the purely physical connection between the leper and the menstruant that Nahmanides had suggested, Sefer ha-kanah adds a more ontic relationship: Lep- ers and menstruants are both banned, nidah, from the community of the holy.

Nahmanides 'Students Nahmanides hoped that his uninitiated readers would be satisfied with his references to the Kabbalah and forbade the uninitiated to delve into the text's deep- er meaning. This, of course, was an invitation. The prohibition aroused the curios- ity of so many scholars and laymen that it created "a major kabbalistic activity of interpreting those passages on which Nahmanides specifically prohibited further speculation."99 Nahmanides' own students heeded their master's desires and trans- mitted kabbalistic traditions only orally. Their students, in turn, however, enlarged upon Nahmanides' exegesis in writing.'00 Four students of Rabbi Solomon ibn Adret wrote supercommentaries on Nahmanides. Many other exegetes, such as Isaac of Acre, Bahya ben Asher, and Menahem Recanati, wrote biblical commen- taries based upon Nahmanides' work. All these exegetes assume that Nahmanides revealed the "mystery of the separation from the nidah" in his exegesis on Leviti- cus 18:19.101 The supercommentaries convert Nahmanides' references to natural philoso- phy into the terms of kabbalistic myth. For example, Bahya ben Asher and Shem Tov ibn Ga'on explain that a menstruant's gaze will not only cause blood spots to appear on a mirror but on other forms of polished metal such as a dagger blade. Rather than attribute this power to bad air (ruah rac), as in Aristotle's theory of con- tagion, however, Bahya ben Asher and Shem Tov ibn Ga'on read ruah rac mytho- logically as "bad spirit." They explain that evil spirits of impurity transfer menstrual impurity from its origin on the divine left to terrestrial women by pos- sessing women at the onset of their flow.'02 These spirits empower the nidah, en- abling her to alter the nature of a mirror or a sword.'03 Thirteenth-century kabbalists thus explicitly formulate the long expurgated belief that spirits of im- purity possess menstruants.104 For the Catalonian kabbalist Bahya ben Asher, for instance, the issue of the 99.

The Mishnah describes impure men- strual blood in terms of grapes and wine.105 Bereshit Rabbah identifies grapes as the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge: Eve sinned when she squeezed these grapes and gave them to Adam.1'06 Thirteenth-century kabbalists associate Eve's sin of squeezing the grapes to the flow of impure blood. They explain that there are two types of grapes: white grapes represent the benevolent sefirot, and red/black grapes represent stern Judgment. Eve sinned by squeezing the black/red grapes of the left side. In so doing, she attached herself to evil and introduced death and de- struction into the world.107 Her punishment, menstruation, fits her crime: Eve's blood must spill because she spilled both human blood and the red juice of the grapes of Judgment.108 Bahya ben Asher applies this analogy to all menstruants, explaining that: Eve was punished with the blood of menstruation because it has the same ap- pearance [as the wine, the symbol of harsh Judgment] and it is discharged from her with the same appearance. And this is the mystery of the Scripture's lan- guage when it described a kind of wine in terms of blood. As it is written, "and from the blood of the grape you drank foaming wine" (Deut. 32:14). And it is written, "he washes his garments in the blood of grapes; and his vesture in the blood of grapes" (Gen. 49:11) ... This is the reason that the sages, may their memory be blessed, said that man produces white [seed], while woman pro- duces red [seed]. The sin of the mother [Eve] and her daughters is similar with respect to the wine, which causes the evils of the world . . . .09 Wine, grapes, and the color red are all symbols of stern Judgment in nondualistic presentations of evil. Menstrual blood is the external mark of women's affinity to the sinister sefirah. Just as Judgment is the seventh sefirah, Leviticus deems men- struants impure for seven days;' 'Ijust as Judgment secretes wine lees, women dis- charge menstrual blood."I' Echoes ofNahmanides in Castile Nahmanides and his interpreters directly influenced Castilian attitudes to- wards menstruants.

[There is] anoth- er deep issue in the mystery of the law of the nidah and the need to separate from her, and what I have said is sufficient." 12 We may infer his meaning from a similar discussion in the Zohar: There is no defilement in the world greater than that of menstruation. The de- filement of menstruation is more severe than any other type of defilement. The man [who has such intercourse] becomes impure himself, and renders impure all those who are near to him. Wherever they go they drive the Shekhinah away. Furthermore, he brings a grievous illness upon himself and the child that he begets, for once a man has relations with a menstruant, the impurity takes hold of him and remains in every part of his body. At that moment, a spirit of im- purity is cast upon the child that is begotten, and he will live all his days in a state of defilement for his very foundation rests on a defilement that is greater and stronger than any other, for as soon as a man approaches a menstruant woman, the impurity takes hold of him, as it is written, "her impurity is com- municated to him" (Lev. 15:24).' "' For Aristotle, menstruants are contagious because they have bad air; for de Leon, menstruants are contagious because spirits of impurity possesses them. Elsewhere, the Zohar further mythologizes this understanding and refers to menstrual pollu- tion as "the mystery of the primordial serpent.""14 Rabbi Shim'on bar Yohai ex- plains: 115 We have learned that one hundred and twenty-five different types of impuri- ty descended to the earth, which are united with the side of the powerful ser- pent. We have learned that twenty-seven of the greatest ones unite with women and cleave to them. Woe is he who approaches her at this time. For he who ap- proaches a menstruant will cause a defect above. Because through this sin the powerful serpent is awakened, and he casts his filth in a place that does not need it. And he unites with the female (the Shekhinah). And the hair of the male grows, and the female is polluted and her hair and nails grow. And at this point stern Judgment is awakened in this world and all are polluted. As it is written, "because he has defiled the Lord's sanctuary" (Num. 19:20). The sanctuary of the Lord is polluted by the sins of men. We have learned that which is written, "and I will put enmity between you and the women" (Gen. 3:15).

Twenty-four types of [impurity] are aroused above and below. Her hair and nails grow and [through this] judgment is awakened in the world. And when a woman wishes to purify herself she must cut the hair that has grown during the days of her impurity. And she must cut her nails and all similar filth.1 16 Samael, the leader of the demonic other side (sitra' 'ahra') of impurity, is re- sponsible for the one hundred and twenty-five different types of human pollution. He instills women with the twenty-four gravest forms."7 These spirits of impuri- ty possess women and occasion their menstrual flow."8 Menstruating women thus become the terrestrial incarnation of the demonic realm. Thirteenth-century kabbalists drew upon natural philosophy, medieval med- icine, and folklore in order to understand the mystery of the menstruating woman. But their scientific inquiry itself was marked by a certain gender bias. Kabbalists demonstrated certain cultural predispositions about women and when these dove- tailed with the existing prejudices against women within the medical community, it resulted in a misogyny that affected both women's healthcare and heavenly as- pirations. In medieval folklore, the menstruant is likened to a snake filled with ven- om. In Castilian Kabbalah, the primordial serpent fills the menstruant with his own venom and transforms her into a demonic force. Thus in thirteenth-century Kab- balah, the menstruant is endowed with not only earthly but also supernatural pow- ers. The dangers that she can pose and the means by which medieval kabbalists hoped to deter these dangers had a profound effect on the image and status of Jew- ish women in medieval society.
