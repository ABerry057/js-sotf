Detroit: Wayne State Universi- ty Press, 2003. 446 pp. Marianne R. Sanua offers a balanced examination of a largely unexplored topic, the Jewish Greek subsystem that developed on American college campuses in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and thrived until the closure, merger, or reorientation of many of these organizations in the 1960s and early 1970s. One of the first studies to take the Greek system seriously and recognize it for the social and cultural force it was during its heyday in the early part of the twentieth century, Sanua's book provides readers with rare access to the aspira- 409</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews tions, concerns, and ideals of a large segment-estimated between one fourth and one third-of the American Jewish college-going population of this time period. Sanua begins her book by justifying her focus on the Greek system-one can almost hear through her prose the challenges she must have faced along the way from those who did not take the Greek system or its Jewish subsystem seri- ously enough to warrant study. She states that fraternity and sorority records pro- vide a wealth of material through which to track how so many Jewish collegians managed to surmount the obstacles of recent arrival, limited means, anti-Semitism, and closed college admissions policies, among other challenges, to climb the lad- der to middle-class prosperity within a short period of time. In addition, because they detail the actions and concerns of a large segment of the college-going Jew- ish population, these records allow Sanua to focus on "ordinary" Jewish people- the men and women who went to college, married, raised families, worked in busi- nesses and in the professions, and otherwise represented the typical Jewish-Amer- ican bourgeoisie-rather than just on the religious leaders, labor leaders, radicals, or intellectuals who were the sources and foci of most other identifiably Jewish writings at this time. Finally, given that these records were written by Jewish Greeks for the eyes of their fraternity brothers or sorority sisters only, the memos, letters, speeches, journal reports, magazine articles, and other documents of Greek-society life contain a candidness and a freedom that did not exist outside of Jewish-only or largely Jewish organizations. As such, these records provide San- ua with a window into the desires and concerns of an important, yet understudied, segment of the Jewish population, and she mines them for much that they have to offer. Founded to provide support and solidarity to Jewish collegians who were ex- cluded from membership in the historically Christian Greek-letter organizations that ran the extracurriculum on many college campuses, the Jewish fraternities and sororities developed to fill a wide variety of needs: They offered room and board for those who might be barred because of their religion from the local rooming houses; they offered social outlets and introductions to members of the opposite sex who might make appropriate dating partners and even potential marriage mates; they offered vocational training and access to jobs and internships; and they offered a sense of familiarity to Jewish students who had left their hometowns and familiar environs and traveled to faraway parts of the country in search of a col- lege education at an institution that welcomed or at least tolerated their enrollment. Overall, these organizations offered both tacit and overt instruction to their mem- bers in how to be "good Americans"-how to blend in as much as possible with the mainstream campus culture around them, in the hopes that this would allevi- ate anti-Semitism. "The rules were: watch your manners, behave like ladies and gentlemen, avoid impropriety, keep your head low, be good and loyal citizens, and contribute to the welfare of your community" (249). Just how Jewish these organizations were and should be, and whom they claimed as members, were highly contested questions. By and large, their answers depended on which group was in question and who within the group was doing the answering. Some fraternities, such as Zeta Beta Tau, were founded specifically as Jewish organizations, with a constitution and ritual steeped in Jewish tradition; oth- 410</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews ers, such as Pi Lambda Phi, explicitly shunned sectarianism; still others, such as Phi Epsilon Pi, chose to leave the issue up to individual members to decide, and they decided differently at different points in time. Some groups appealed to native-born, relatively well-off, German-Jewish collegians. Others attracted the children of more recently arrived, less well-off Russian immigrants. Sanua's ex- ploration of these distinctions among the groups and the ways the different frater- nities and sororities chose to separate themselves from coreligionists they labeled "hopeless"-usually because they looked "too Jewish" or spoke too loudly or with an accent-make for some of the more interesting and complex discussions in the book. Internal prejudice and shunning at the hands of fellow Jews hurt as much as, if not more than, that encountered at the hands of non-Jews. Sanua's skill at deal- ing with this issue enables the reader to understand both how those excluded by their own must have felt, and yet at the same time recognize how important it must have seemed to many Jewish Greeks to set themselves off from and above those they considered coarse or vulgar, in the vain belief that fine manners and proper comportment would help them prove their worth to others, especially non-Jews, on campus. Indeed, much of the history of the early Jewish Greek subsystem as ex- plored by Sanua is filled with tension. For example, the Jewish fraternities (and, to a lesser extent, sororities), like their non-Jewish counterparts, made much of the vocational access they enabled, with insiders not only advising fellow frater- nity members on careers and strategies but also providing them entree to desir- able internships and jobs. But not only did the Jewish groups aid their members in seeking careers; at the same time they trod an almost contradictory path-go- ing to great lengths to keep many of their own out of some professions, in the be- lief that the oversaturation of Jews in fields such as medicine and law would contribute to anti-Semitism and lend credence to myths of Jewish world domina- tion. Another tension Sanua explores nicely deals with how Jewish Greeks both welcomed and resisted the dropping of "sectarian clauses" (also called "exclu- sionary clauses" because they named who could or could not join an organiza- tion) in the post-World War II era. On one hand, as men and women who themselves struggled against prejudice, Jewish Greeks largely considered the lowering of barriers a good thing; on the other hand, the very raison d'etre of their organizations, to provide solidarity to those shut out of the historically Christian Greek societies, would disappear if the older and more established groups agreed to take in Jewish members. Going Greek is best when it explores broad themes and questions within the Jewish collegiate Greek system-how the different groups responded to anti- Semitism and closed door admissions policies; the ways the different organizations wrestled with how "Jewish" a Jewish fraternity should be; how the fraternities and sororities responded to external events, such as the Depression, the rise of Hitler, and the two World Wars. There are times in the book when the author seems to get bogged down in details, as though once she found this treasure trove of undiscov- ered (by scholars) documents, Sanua wanted to use them all. In addition, she pro- vides far more insight into the mechanisms of the men's organizations than she does into the women's-a fact she recognizes but does not adequately explain. 411</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews Still, this is an important, provocative, and highly readable study, and it deserves close attention by scholars and lay readers alike.
