Rutherford, N.J.: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1982. 339 pp. Readers in search of a grand theory of Jewish economic behavior will be disappointed by Harold Pollins's Economic History of the Jews in England. Pollins eschews the kind of comprehensive theory-building associated with the names of Marx, Sombart, and Weber in favor of a more sober and factually reliable approach. In covering the full sweep of Anglo-Jewish history since the resettlement of 1656, he sets himself a more modest but no less difficult task: providing a careful description of three centuries of Jewish economic activity in a society where relevant data about that activity are difficult to come by, and, when patterns do display themselves, infusing the descriptive material with unobtrusive middle-range theories appropriate to specific circumstances.</page><page sequence="2">110 BOOK REVIEWS If there is a central theme running through Pollins's work, it is the rela- tive insignificance of Jews in shaping economic life in Britain. Unlike their counterparts in the less-developed regions of Europe, where native entre- preneurial talent was weak, English Jews worked in a society economically in advance of the rest of the world, at least until the end of the nineteenth century, in which there were few fields ripe for economic penetration by outsiders. There were, of course, areas of economic life in which Jews were highly visible: the diamond and coral trade and the precious metals trade in the eighteenth century, the old-clothes trade in the late Georgian period, country peddling in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the mass production of cheap clothing from the 1830s to World War II, urban property development in the postwar years. However, the prominence of Jews in these areas can hardly be construed as decisive in determining British economic development. Britain's preeminence in the nineteenth century was built on agriculture, coal mining, iron and steel production, engineering, textiles, shipbuilding, and railways. As Pollins points out, "in these industries' formative years in the eighteenth century the Jews played no part," while in the nineteenth century only a handful became industrial- ists by comparison with the much larger number who achieved distinction in more traditional areas of Jewish enterprise, such as finance, stock broker- age, overseas commerce, and retail trade. Interestingly, most Jews who entered the areas that were the backbone of the Industrial Revolution were not native-born English Jews but recent arrivals from Germany who settled in the provinces, such as Ludwig Mond (chemicals), Jacob Behrens (textiles), Gustave Edward Wolff (shipbuilding), and Bernhard Samuelson (engineering). Pollins notes the German origins of these provincial industrialists without explaining, unfortunately, why they were attracted to the new industries while Jews whose families had arrived in England two or three generations earlier were not. (Another distinguishing characteristic of these Jewish industrial pioneers was their propensity to abandon Judaism and assimilate completely into the dominant elites of the communities in which they settled, a characteristic perhaps linked to their initial attraction to economic endeavors outside the usual sphere of Jewish interests.) The failure of Jews to play a critical role in English industrial growth does not mean, of course, that there was nothing distinctive about Jewish economic activity. The occupational profile of Anglo-Jewry at any time between the resettlement and World War II was as skewed toward com- merce-and particular fields within trade-as that of any other Western</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 111 Jewry. In the case of communities where Jews were excluded by discrimina- tion from key professions and occupations, it is not difficult to understand the lopsided economic structure of those Jewries. But such an explanation, Pollins argues, will not work in the case of England, where new Jewish immigrants were "emancipated defacto" and "formal limitations on Jewish life were minimal." Thus, for example, Ashkenazi immigrants in the Georgian period who took up peddling were not forced to do so because entry to the artisanal crafts was regulated by the City of London companies. In fact, the companies' control was limited to the one square-mile of the City of London; non-Jewish craftsmen elsewhere in the metropolis were willing to take on Jewish apprentices; and Jews who did experience difficulty in following a craft in London could set up in the provinces, where the market for luxuries was rapidly expanding. Why, then, did these immigrants, and, indeed, most other English Jews in the past three centuries as well, show so little interest in breaking away from certain well-trod occupational paths when external constraints were no longer a consideration? In a brief concluding chapter, Pollins offers a number of suggestions as to why this should have been so. He stresses, in particular, the occupational background of the different waves of immi- grants and their tendency to pursue the same trades they had followed prior to their migration. The Jewish tobacco workers of Victorian London, for example, carried on in the same employment they had known in Amster- dam. Similarly, the trades of the Eastern European immigrants-petty commerce and small workshop manufacturing-accompanied them in their migration to Britain. In addition, the presence of Jewish employers in certain areas of the economy may have acted to channel Jewish workers into these same areas. This would certainly explain the absence of East End Jews in engineering and dock-working. As Pollins notes, "A Jew would feel more comfortable working for a Jew; even if conditions of work were poor he would not be exposed to possible taunts, snubs or outright hostility because he was Jewish." The willingness of some Jewish employers to honor their workers' religious sensibilities may also have acted to concentrate Jews in certain trades, although this point should not be stressed too much, Pollins feels, since the Jewish working class "did not have a high reputation for religiosity." A further determinant of the structure of Anglo-Jewish economic life was the previously mentioned maturity of the English economy, which foreclosed expansion into new areas that in other societies were open to Jewish initiative. Perhaps the most attractive feature of this work is its very scope. Pollins</page><page sequence="4">112 BOOK REVIEWS is not a timid scholar, content to work his own narrowly delimited territory, fearful of synthesis and speculation. His Economic History of the Jews in England, while not intellectually daring, is bold in terms of the great mass of historical evidence it seeks to master. In a few instances, the author was able to draw on previously published studies of specific topics, such as Gedalia Yogev's Diamonds and Coral: Anglo-Dutch Jews and Eighteenth-Century Trade and Joseph Buckman's Immigrants and the Class Struggle: The Jewish Immigrants in Leeds, 1880-1914. But for the most part he has had to rely on less satisfactory printed sources, such as memoirs and biographies of suc- cessful entrepreneurs; histories of particular industries, towns, and trades; journalistic surveys of Jewish life and labor; and articles from the Transac- tions of the Jewish Historical Society of England. Due to the scope of his project, Pollins, quite understandably, has not utilized unprinted archival materials like business records or personal correspondence. Thus, his account is weaker in evidence and more speculative in some places than others, and should be considered not so much a definitive synthesis as a thoughtful guide to the current state of our knowledge and a stimulus to further research and reflection. To say this, however, is not to minimize its value. By casting his net so widely, Pollins has performed an important service for students of both Anglo-Jewish history and the social history of Western Jewry. Pollins's dependence on secondary sources has also influenced the organization of his survey. The preoccupation of previous researchers with the sweated trades of the immigrant community at the end of the last cen- tury and the trade unionism to which they gave birth has led the author to emphasize this episode in Anglo-Jewish economic history without accord- ing equally important developments their proper due. The growth of the new community receives a chapter of its own, as do the immigrant trades, Jewish trade unionism, and the working class in the interwar years. On the other hand, the dissolution of the Jewish working class and the movement of their children and grandchildren into lower-middle- and middle-class occu- pations are dealt with only cursorily. Yet this transformation, which began in the interwar period and intensified after 1945, was as decisive as the arrival of the Eastern European immigrant wave several decades earlier. Unfortunately, this shift in the makeup of the community remains un- chronicled, while research into the old East End and its counterparts in the provinces continues space. To this observer, it appears that nostalgia for a world that has been lost-as well as left-wing political sympathies-have</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 113 determined much of the current research agenda in Anglo-Jewish history rather than other, more dispassionate criteria. Now that Pollins has so care- fully outlined the full course of Jewish economic history in England and thereby made more readily apparent the gaps in our knowledge, others will perhaps be encouraged to explore these neglected topics.
