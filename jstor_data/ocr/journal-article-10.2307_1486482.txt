Brill, 1992. viii, 209 pp. The issue of method in the reconstruction of Israelite history is one that attracts periodic attention in the field literature. For the most part, abstract 6. The linguistic dating of material by McKenzie is not as rigorous as that used by Avi Hurvitz; cf., e.g., Hurvitz, A Linguistic Study of the Relationship Between the Priestly Source and the Book of Ezekiel: A New Approach to an Old Problem, CRB 20 (Paris: J. Gabalda, 1982).</page><page sequence="2">164 BOOK REVIEWS formulas for approaching antiquity lack the nuance, the suppleness, that actual attempts to grapple with history should and sometimes do evince. Perhaps the most tangled issues involved are the epistomological ones: what do we know, what surmise, what intuit, and on what basis do we do so? In one sense, Klaas Smelik's Converting the Past does not address these issues: four of its five chapters are case studies--of the so-called Ark Narrative; of the Mesha stela and its historical implications; of the narratives in Kings and Isaiah concerning Hezekiah; and, of Kings and Chronicles on Manasseh. For the most part, literary questions occupy Smelik's attention, as they should that of any good historian. However, he also offers an opening essay on using the Bible as a history. Smelik's second chapter makes the important point that the Ark Nar- rative culminates not in 2 Samuel 6, with the introduction of the ark into Jerusalem, but in fact in the incorporation of the Ark into Solomon's temple. Astonishingly, Smelik denies any basis in written or oral sources here. While conceivably the ark's history intentionally denies the importance of mere symbols, the conclusion that it ciphers the Babylonian exile is contraindicated by Smelik's literary observation: unless the Former Prophets through the reign of Solomon all prefigure the Exile and Restoration, which seems unlikely, the integration of the ark into the ongoing narrative suggests a concern for legitimating the Temple that certainly stood in Jerusalem from the 10th century on. The notion that an exilic author invented an exile of the ark alone in the 11th century so that his contemporaries could draw their own conclusions as to its eventual return is interesting, but highly notional. Smelik also treats the literature on Hezekiah and Manasseh as reflecting exilic concerns. In the latter case, this is selfevident, as 2 Kings 21-25 blame the exile on that king. Smelik notes how deftly the narrator shifts from Manasseh's sin to the people's guilt, and contrasts this with Chronicles, in which Josiah's successors, not his grandfather, cause the exile (though again guilt is shifted onto the nation in 2 Chr 36:14-16). But what is most striking in these two texts is that Kings never penalizes the Davidic dynasty, and ends with a note about the scion of that line; by way of contrast Chronicles ends, assuming it is not continued in 1 Esdras, without reference to the dynasty's role in the Restoration. What Smelik does not sufficiently take into account, in the case of either Hezekiah or Manasseh, is the convergence of the main political allegations in the biblical texts with extrinsic records, whether epigraphic</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 165 or archaeological. For example, the Chronicler either knew or surmised that Manasseh had refortified the western part of Jerusalem, and that he had reinstalled officers into the fortresses of Judah; Assyrian texts and the stratigraphy of the 7th century make both claims highly plausible. Under the circumstances, Smelik's overture to the text as devoid of historical intention lacks historiographic dimension. This is not to say that these studies lack other dimensions. Smelik is a keen reader of text, and his treatments brim with insights. His treatment of the Mesha stela, building on previous work by Maxwell Miller and others, is arguably one of the finest treatments of that inscription and the events surrounding it, exhibiting a superb sense of historical geography and a feel for the nature of the inscription, which is not organized on chronological principles. Yet he relies heavily on aspects of 2 Kings 3 to reconstruct the period and the geography, while denying that its geography or description of events is reliable, except where "unique" claims are made. The problem is not his use of the biblical narrative, which is by and large judicious. The problem is rather his assumption that elements of the miraculous and other problems related to causation and characterization in ancient historiography necessarily imply either deliberate fabrication on the part of the historian (as distinct from oral or other sources) or the unreliability of other claims in the narrative. Ultimately, it is the theoretical question, not the practical one, that taxes Smelik most sharply. Of course he is right to claim that ancient annalists and the authors of display inscriptions put things in the best possible light for their (usually royal) sponsors. But in analyzing such materials, based only on internal evidence and a reconstruction of events derived from it, Smelik shows that the texts furnish historical information-for example, that the Western coalition facing Shalmaneser III at Qarqar in fact beat him off. Despite disarranging the historical data by their obvious bias, our materials do not altogether obscure them: there was a battle at Qarqar in 853, between Shalmaneser and a number of western kings, including Ahab son of Omri, king of Israel; the Assyrian did not make permanent gains or further inroads in the immediate aftermath of that battle. Smelik's general view, that Israelite narrators responsible for Samuel- Kings knew little history, allowing them complete scope for fabrication, is tempered somewhat by the recognition that some information in those books is corroborated elsewhere. He concedes, for example, that information about</page><page sequence="4">166 BOOK REVIEWS Tiglath-Pileser must stem from a source. But these Biblical narratives, which differ in genere from those of the Pentateuch or Joshua, do not just place neo-Assyrian and Isaraelite/Judahite kings in their proper order (Omri, Ahab, Jehu, Joash, Ahaz, Hezekiah, Manasseh; Tiglath-Pileser III, Shalmaneser V, [Sargon], Sennacherib, [Esarhaddon, Asshurbanipal]). They also locate both Mesha of Moab, Hazael, Ben-Hadad, and Rezin of Damascus, and Shishak in precisely the right chronological and geographical arenas. Certainly no contemporary historian takes the moral/cultic assessments of the historical books seriously, any more than one would appeal to divine intervention as a form of historical causation. But equally, these texts demonstrably convey accurate information: of battles and confrontations, of regnal sequence and length, of territorial and political developments, that did take place. It is the job of the historian, thus, to discern when to rely on assertions, and when to impute them, or the spin being put on them, to the interest of the ancient authors or their sponsors and audiences. For this, there are no hard and fast rules: only, the better one understands the intentions expressed by the text and its disarrangements of events, the better one can perform the task. Smelik shows himself adept at both aspects of the historical enterprise, which makes it doubly peculiar that he should find. that enterprise, and the sources he must rely on in undertaking it, so thoroughly disqualified in theory.
