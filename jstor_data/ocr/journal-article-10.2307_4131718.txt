Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. xii, 210 pp. In this book, based upon his Lancaster-Yarnton Lectures in 1996, David No- vak argues that natural law has always played a central role in Jewish thought and discourse. He also argues that natural law ought to be seen in a positive light; in other words, this is a work of constructive theology as much as it is a survey of the influence of natural law in Jewish intellectual history. Its "historical" side shows itself in Novak's interpretations of various biblical narratives; the stories of Cain and Abel, Abraham and Sodom, and Abraham and Abimelech are coherent only if we recognize that the characters share a conception of a universally valid moral law based upon reason rather than revelation. In addition, the long record of in- vestigation by Jewish thinkers into the reasons for the particular commandments (ta 'amei ha-misvot) suggests both that Jews have sought to explain the substantive content of revelation in rational terms and that, in Novak's words, "more often than not the rules cannot be cogently applied unless we have some understanding of what these rules intend" (p. 64). The efforts by such luminaries as Saadiah Gaon and Maimonides to devel- op teleologies of Jewish law-"an essential component of natural law thinking" (p. 120)-are offered as evidence that these mainstream rabbis regard knowledge of the revealed law as insufficient in the absence of a rationale that itself is not de- pendent upon revelation. And Novak sides with those Judaic thinkers who hold that the concept of Noahide law represents "an authentically Jewish way to engage in thinking natural law" (p. 191). Although he acknowledges that not all will agree with this assessment, "it is enough for any Jewish thinker to be able to connect himself or herself with a sustained subtradition within the overall tradition itself, even if that subtradition has a counter subtradition" (p. 192). The "theological" side of Novak's argument lies in his claim that natural law makes it possible to conduct Jewish moral discourse in a world composed of many cultures, to make claims of moral meaning in the name of Judaism that are simul- taneously understandable to non-Jews. Within a particularly Jewish context as well, natural law serves as an indispensable critique and refinement of our under- standing of the positive law of the covenant of Sinai. These claims allow Novak to respond to those traditionalists who reject natural law as unnecessary on the grounds that the revealed misvot by themselves are the exclusive authority in Ju- daism. To Novak, the misvot do not function, and never have functioned, in isola- tion from rationale; "theology cannot simply avoid philosophy without appearing absurd in the process" (p. 177). At the same time, Novak rejects the stronger claims made by some natural law advocates that reason alone is a sufficient ground for all law. All law emerges from particular cultures; natural law can critique this cul- tural grounding but cannot replace it. In Jewish terms, natural law cannot function without revelation, which establishes the basic Gestalt of Judaism as "a full and abiding relationship between God and a people on earth"(p. 61). Novak's argument is compelling, assuming that one does not assume an "ex- treme" position of either the theological or the rational-philosophical variety. It may be weakened, though, by its tendency to conflate the concepts of natural law 384</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews and reason. Reason or rationality is surely an inescapable precondition for theo- logical thought. Just as human beings cannot hope to express themselves in con- versation in the absence of a common linguistic structure that makes meaningful communication possible, we might say that religious meaning, too, depends upon the existence of a shared intellectual framework (including accepted understand- ings of such notions as justice, right, good, and evil) that precedes any specific rev- elatory act. Yet, the inevitable existence of reason as an aspect of Jewish religious discourse may not prove that Judaism recognizes a doctrine that we would cus- tomarily identify as natural law. As the late Professor Marvin Fox noted, the very term "natural law" is conspicuous in its absence from the writings of leading Jew- ish religious thinkers, including those of the rationalists Saadiah and Maimonides. Those who respond that Judaism nonetheless recognizes natural law, albeit not by that name, may have a point. Then again, it is possible that they are "defining nat- ural law down," broadening and generalizing the concept so as to identify it with the sort of reason that virtually all would agree most certainly functions in Jewish religious discourse. In this way, the existence of natural law within Judaism be- comes less controversial. It also becomes less interesting. Still, Novak's essay is a cogent presentation of the issues, an important state- ment by a leading contemporary Jewish theologian.
