<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lawrence Fine. Physician of the Soul, Healer of the Cosmos: Isaac Luria and His Kabbalistic Fellowship. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2003. xiii, 480 pp. It is perhaps unorthodox to begin a book review by citing something from the acknowledgments. In this case, however, I think it is quite apt. Describing his early foray into the study of Jewish mysticism, Lawrence Fine writes, "It was [Alexander] Altmann who said to me, in one of the earliest conversations I had with him after I arrived at Brandeis, that 'nobody understands Lurianic Kabbala, not even Scholem,' referring, of course to the preeminent historian of Jewish mys- ticism, Gershom Scholem." It is a comment, I imagine, that Scholem may have 367</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews even agreed with! In any case, Fine's book is an attempt, and one of the best to date, to try to make sense of the labyrinthine world of Lurianic Kabbala. Scholem argued that Lurianic metaphysics was a system developed as a response to histor- ical phenomena, that is, the Jewish expulsion from Spain, and was largely a cre- ative interpretation of, and commentary on, the Zohar. Neither Scholem nor his student Isaiah Tishby devoted any significant space to the historical context of Lurianic Kabbala or its particular cultural milieu, or the possibility of external in- fluences on this mystical circle. Both assumed Luria had historiosophic and not cultural/historic concerns. This trajectory has, until recently, been the accepted framework of Lurianic scholarship. Over the course of the past twenty years, this perspective has changed sig- nificantly. Among others, Fine has published scholarly articles that challenged Sc- holem's idea that Luria's central concern was metaphysical and historiosophic. Throughout his work Fine argues that Luria, while a superb metaphysician, was in fact focused on people, particularly on his own circle of students, and was not the disinterested, albeit charismatic, ascetic Scholem made him out to be. Fine states his thesis clearly enough: "This book regards Lurianic Kabbala as an embodied phenomenon. By this I mean primarily two related things. First, people were at the heart of the Lurianic enterprise ... Second, Luria and his dis- ciples were far more interested in the life of praxis-both at the individual level and at the level of social community-than in speculative or theoretical matters" (p. 9). This claim, which underlies the entire project, is groundbreaking because Scholem's thesis, which had its own ideological foundation having nothing to do with Luria, has largely framed our reading of the material in question. I must briefly return, once more, to the acknowledgments to posit that Fine's own ap- proach is no more objective than Scholem's was. Fine states, "As I look back, I be- lieve my interest in studying intentional community had something important to do with my own experiment in community during the early 1970s [referring to his time with Havurat Shalom in Somerville, Massachusetts]." So, just as Luria served Scholem's mid-century Zionism quite well, Luria serves Fine's late-century Dias- pora "Jewish Renewal" approach quite well. This is no critique but, in fact, a com- pliment-to Scholem and Fine and, I suppose, to Luria. The extent to which a thinker's work can be employed in light of one's being-in-the-world is a testament to the elasticity and durability of its message. The impact and influence of personal and historical context is, of course, inevitable and even constructive as long as the textual tradition explored is done with precision, care, and open-mindedness. Such is the case with both scholars mentioned here. Since, according to Fine, "the person" stands at the center of Luria's work, it is appropriate that he begin with the person, that is, Luria himself. The problem with this, and perhaps the reason no one has yet attempted to reconstruct Luria's life and personality from a scholarly perspective (hagiographies abound, but those mostly muddy the waters), is that we know very little about his life. We know lit- tle about his life before coming to Safed from Egypt, and he only lived in Safed a short 18 months before dying of a plague in the summer of 1572. To confront this, Fine paints a fine picture of Egypt during the period of Luria's youth as the only possible way of imagining (and all we can do is imagine) what Luria's early life 368</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews must have been like. He reproduces a few important letters and court documents in which Luria is mentioned, giving us at least an external sense of the person. Try- ing to counter Scholem's contention that Luria was a man who lived in the cosmos, Fine argues that, as far as we know, he was an upstanding member of the Jewish community in Cairo (pp. 37-39), served on its rabbinical court, and was involved in commercial trade. My only question about these initial chapters is that Fine sets Luria deeply in an Islamic context but does not investigate, or even discuss, the likely Islamic influences on this thought. There is no entry for "Islam" or "Muslim" in the index and most of the references for "Sufism" relate to medieval predecessors of Luria (e.g., Bahya ibn Pakuda). There is a reference to Sufi influence on grave venera- tion (p. 275), but given the intellectual context of Luria's life in Egypt, which Fine presents in the first chapter, Safed's tolerant Ottoman context, and our knowledge of an existing Sufi circle in Safed connected to Ibn Arabi (Safed was a fairly small community at that time), it is surely possible that Islamic influence spread farther than the particular custom of grave veneration. While this is surely not a crucial point, I think that it would work to Fine's benefit to deepen his revision of Scholem's historiosophic thesis by placing Luria more solidly in the "real world" of culture and ideas. In Chapter 4, Fine gives us a lucid and well-informed description of Lurian- ic myth. His ability to clearly explain the complexity of this system without get- ting overly entrenched in the never-ending details is a tribute to both his writing and his thinking. In some places, however, this style also results in washing over what this reviewer believes are important points. For example, on page 144 he dis- cusses the project of tikun though ritual observance (mitzvot). This is central to Fine's thesis that Luria's focus on metaphysics is primarily in its service to piety. While there are two full chapters devoted to tikun, the reader, especially one unfa- miliar with this world of ideas, is left without a theoretical discussion of what tikun actually is, not as it relates to mitzvot or to prayer, but more generally; what does Luria mean by the term tikun? There is one paragraph that begins this explanation, but it does not go far enough. Fine's chapter on gilgul (the reincarnation of souls) is one of the best and most important chapters in the book. It places this important yet under-explored trope as a lens through which Luria contextualizes his own vocation and his own circle as replaying the drama of the near (rabbinic) and distant (biblical) past. In fact, what Fine argues, and he does so convincingly, is that the complex story of the gilgulim of biblical chapters in the Lurianic corpus is all, or mostly, about con- temporary figures and his belief in his circle as holding the possibility of redemp- tion. Scholem's historiosophic thesis is significantly weakened, when the personalities of Luria's disciples become the main focus of his attention and not simply an interesting footnote to Lurianic cosmology. To put gilgul as the center- piece of the Lurianic system, Fine redirects our attention away from mythic histo- ry and toward Lurianic psychology. There are a few issues I would like to raise in this fine study. First, on page 188, Fine takes up the question of Luria's relationship to the law. This is a crucial issue, both for Fine's thesis and for the study of Lurianic Kabbala more generally. 369</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews Here Fine argues that what may have saved Kabbala in general from the dustbin of Jewish history is its "orthodoxy." He states, "For all their novel-even radical- mythic and theological notions, the Kabbalists had remained committed to the meticulous observance of the mitzvot, the precepts or commandments that consti- tute the basic stricture of Jewish law." Kabbalists, he continues, could "get away with" what critics deemed "offensive and bizarre conceptions of God" because they remained halakhic Jews. On the surface, there is little one could argue with here. We know that Kabbalists adhered to traditional conceptions of halakhah and that their descendants, to this day, continue to do so. However, isn't the hyper- nomian turn, that is, the turn toward piety as obligation, also deviance, especially when it determines that the stricter behavior is not only recommended but also mandatory? Given historical circumstances, largely resulting from the emergence of Hasidism in eastern Europe and the popularization of Lurianic custom through Sephardic leaders such as R. Joseph Hayyim of Baghdad and R. Hayyim Sofer, au- thor of KafHa-Hayyim on the Shulkhan Arukh, traditional Jewry east and west has largely, albeit not totally, accepted Lurianic "custom" as normative. But one who reads Luria's works will notice that these behaviors are presented as not merely suggested stringencies but, in fact, obligatory as part of the tikun to which Fine al- ludes in his book. So, while I agree with Fine descriptively, I think that many Kab- balists did not simply adhere to halakhah, traditionally defined, but, particularly in the case of Luria, conflated halakhah and custom in a way that revolutionized halakhic practice. The line dividing law and piety is effaced when the pious be- havior is conflated with "the law." The fact that most of his innovations were strin- gencies (humrot) is not an adequate response. Arguably, taking humrot and making them obligatory is theoretically no less problematic from an "orthodox" perspec- tive than making obligatory nomos voluntary. I for one do not think Luria was "or- thodox" at all if by that we mean one who accepts the authority of tradition as the ultimate criteria of religious behavior. Second, up to this point I have not touched upon the most recent thesis re- garding Lurianic Kabbala, espoused by Moshe Idel. In numerous studies, Idel has argued that Scholem's thesis is mistaken regarding the centrality and trajectory of Lurianic teaching. That is, he argues that Luria's influence, both in practice and in theory, was far less than Scholem claimed, most specifically regarding Sabba- teanism and Hasidism, and that ecstatic influences were far more predominant. Idel's larger project of revising Scholem's history of Kabbala views Scholem's er- ror regarding Luria as a fundamental flaw in his historiography. On page 5, Fine cites Idel's thesis and then proceeds to question it. However, his challenge begins with the word "nevertheless," hardly the language of critique, yet continues to make the case for widespread Lurianic influence. In the footnotes to this page Fine copiously cites Idel's major essays where his thesis is developed without any com- ment. If Fine adheres to Idel's thesis regarding the dissemination of Lurianic Kab- bala, this is fine. However, I think Fine's underlying thesis, and one of the things that make his book so important, is that he offers an important challenge to Idel's revision of Lurianic influence. That is, Fine's revision of Scholem challenges Idel's position on the marginality of Luria, which, of course, is based on Scholem! By arguing 370</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews that Luria's lasting contribution to Judaism, and the one he may have held in high- est esteem, was not metaphysical but, rather, was about "devotion and practice" (including custom and law) (p. 5), and, as such, spread to a much wider audience than the illuminati, Fine is offering his reader another way of assessing the signif- icance of Luria. Physician of the Soul presents to date one of the more comprehensive stud- ies of the Lurianic school and an intriguing challenge to Idel's revision of Lurian- ic Kabbala. It should be taken with utmost seriousness by scholars in the field and scholars in religion. Its lucidity and accessibility make it a book for both experts and non-experts in the study of Jewish mysticism. It will have lasting and signifi- cant impact on the study of Lurianic Kabbala and its influence, and on the study of Kabbala more generally.
