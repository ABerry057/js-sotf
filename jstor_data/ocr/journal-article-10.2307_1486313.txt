<plain_text><page sequence="1">SABBATAI SEVI IN ENGLAND by MICHAEL McKEON Boston University Several years ago Gershom Scholem's authoritative work on the seventeenth century messianic figure Sabbatai Sevi, first published in Hebrew in 1957, appeared in a revised English translation.' The importance of Scholem's work for an informed understanding of the Sabbatian move- ment and for the general study of religious and political movements must be acknowledged by all readers. The relevance of Sabbatai's career in the Le- vant to the specific historical context of post-Restoration England may be less evident. If the English involvement with Sabbatai is compared with the excitement generated in other European countries by his appearance, the English connection cannot fail to appear questionable. The Jewish com- munity in London was a relatively small one at the time of Sabbatai's ascen- dancy,2 and the mass of contemporary material on which Scholem has drawn to document this extraordinary episode in Jewish history includes lit- tle that was produced for or by "English Jews." Moreover, Scholem takes pains to discredit the common notion that English Christian speculations on 1.

The research for this article was completed before Scholem's study was made available to non-Hebrew-speaking audiences. Readers will find that many of my sources are cited in that study, although more are not. My special use of these sources is determined of course by the quite different aims that underlie my work. I have made a number of factual and informational revisions of the article in response to Professor Scholem's generous and close reading of it. Needless to say all errors, and all interpretations of the historical data, remain my own responsibility. 2.

Scholem, pp. 101-2, 152-54. Scholem's point that the Sabbatian movement was most basically a function of Jewish intellectual traditions rather than of Christian stimuli certainly is well taken and well argued, and I do not intend to revive this particular mode of asserting the English-Jewish connection in the history of Sabbatai. At the same time, his rejection of the idea that Christian eschatology may have influenced Sabbatai seems more comprehensive than pre- sent knowledge permits. Scholem attributes to earlier scholars the suggestion "that Sabbatai's father, Mordecai Sevi, had heard from the English merchants, whose agent he was, all sorts of rumors about the impending restoration of Israel to their land in the apocalyptic year of redemption 1666. Mordecai Sevi would report these rumors at home and create in his house a messianic atmosphere whose origin was ultimately non-Jewish" (p. 153). Scholem continues: "There is not a shred of evidence to show that Mordecai Sevi's employers were millenarians, and we may positively assert that they could not have mentioned 1666 as a messianic year. The propaganda for this date made its appearance in Dutch and English literature in the fifties only, that is, after Sabbatai had left Smyrna. There had, of course, been a few medieval writers who had interpreted the 'number of the beast,' 666, in Revelation 13:18 as a prophecy of the coming of Antichrist in the year 1666, but these isolated views were not widely known" (pp. 153-54). Three objections may be made to this argument. First, millenarian ideas and expectations might well be disseminated by merchants who were not themselves strict believers in mil- lenarianism. In the later seventeenth century, merchants were an important medium for the communication of all sorts of news between different countries, and they were bound to have a wide variety of attitudes toward the information they encountered and passed on. Second, Sab- batai was an experienced and well traveled man, and there is no reason to suppose that any ac- cess he might have had to Christian millenarian and messianic ideas would have been limited to the reports of his father's employers (or, consequently, to the period of his habitation with his father). Third, even if Christian eschatology had been unavailable to Sabbatai through chan- nels other than those provided by his father's business associates, there is no reason to locate the origin of seventeenth century eschatological speculation on 1666 as late as the 1650s. Indeed, Scholem is unable to pinpoint the date of Sabbatai's departure from Smyrna more precisely than the period between 1651 and 1654 (pp. 150-5 1), and there was considerable dis- cussion in England, both before and throughout this period, of the belief that 1666 would play a significant role in the sacred drama of the last things and the Second Coming. In the following sources, 1666 is most often associated with the ruin of Antichrist (usually identified with Rome), but other eschatological events are mentioned as well (place of publication of all seventeenth century tracts cited in notes is London unless otherwise specified): Henry Archer, The Personall Reign of Christ upon Earth. ...

How and in what form did the unparalleled developments in the Levant from 1665 to 1667 first become known to English-speaking people? What contribution was made by the Sabbatian movement to Christian es- chatology and to the expectations aroused among its devotees by the ap- proach of the "wonderful year" 1666? What was the range of response to the movement among English observers; what was its ideological or sectarian meaning to contemporaries? In confronting these questions I will, of course, rely heavily on Scholem's analysis and documentation of Sabbatai's career. However, my use of exclusively English (or English-associated) sources, and the specific demands of my inquiry, will lead the present discussion into somewhat different territory from that covered by Scholem's work. Readers who wish to know what was happening in the Levant during the 1660s can do no better than to consult that work; my primary interest is in what the English thought was happening, and in what relevance they thought it had to their own most immediate concerns. I The Jews occupied an ambiguous position in seventeenth century England, as the inconclusive conference on their nominal readmission in 1655 demonstrated.4 The cautious acceptance of Jews into the London trading community during the following ten years was achieved in the face of considerable commercially and religiously oriented antisemitism and protest. The materialistic fear of "the bloud-sucking Jews," the "Horseleeches of every Commonwealth" who drain nations of their money and then move elsewhere, is never far, in these outbursts, from the spiritual apprehension that "considering the fantastical opinions and heresies now Lantern ...(1653, Publications of the Spenser Society, no. 16 [1874], p. 42); William Burden, Christs Personal Reign on Earth ...

The conversion of the Jews was the fond expectation of all good Christians, who understood it, and their subsequent restoration to their homeland, as events which would precede and signal the long awaited second advent of Christ. Thus, just as there existed good commercial arguments, to counter those already cited, for the readmission of the Jews into England, so their presence in that Christian country was susceptible to convincing religious rationalization as well. In fact, much of the extra-commercial sup- port given to the cause of the Jews' readmission in the mid-1650s was based on the conviction that it was part of a providential design to expose the Jews to the salvationist zeal of English Protestantism. From the Jewish perspec- tive, of course, any significant change in the geographical or mental status of the Jewish nation had the very different import that the end of the dispersal and of God's judgment against the tribes of Israel was at hand, and they were being restored to their homeland in preparation for the terrestrial com- ing of the Messiah. Hence those English observers who were so radically in- fluenced by the "Hebraizing" tendency of Puritanism as to identify its elect with the chosen of the Old Testament might look with favor on the Jews' readmission in the belief that in these last times, it was a sign of England's national election that the original Israelites should be "restored" to the New Jerusalem.6 In short, the variety of special interests in the question of England's accessibility to the Jews at this time is only one manifestation of a 5.

On the other hand, the readmission to England also could be seen to fulfill the prophecy that the scattering of the Jews "from one end of the earth to the other" (Deut. 28:64) would precede the Messiah, since in medieval Hebrew, words meaning "the end of the earth" served as the standard term for "England" (Angle-terre): see Scholem, p. 339.</page><page sequence="5">SABBATAI SEVI IN ENGLAND 135 larger and more general eschatological concern over the present and future status of the Jews. According to the numerological calculations of Hebrew scriptural ex- egesis, the year 1648 had great meaning in the continuing expectation of the coming of the Messiah.7 Scholem has shown that Sabbatai's proclamation of himself as the Messiah in that year received little publicity and evoked no public outcry.8 Even so, there are documents in English which make obscure allusion to a messianic appearance in 1648 and to its repercussions for several years thereafter. In a tract printed in 1653, a Jewish convert to Christianity revealed that his conversion had been aided considerably by the response of others to the disappointing disconfirmation of their expecta- tions for 1648. The convert relates that it came to pass ... in Anno. Dom. 1648. there arrived a Rabie, by name Elias, from ... lerusalem ... into Dutchland or Holland, who, whensoever he came into the lewish Synagogues, preached or declared, that their Messias should come in or during that present year.... By this imaginary account, the prophet Elias commanded a good deal of conviction, for he was showered with gifts by eager and excited followers; and yet "the Messiah, whom they expected, did come that year no more than he ever will, which is not at all. . . ." The exemplary nature of this episode for the author is revealed as he continues his narration: But so it happened, that hereupon the learned Jewes of Moravia, living upon the Frontier of the Realm of Hungaria, who belonged to the Germane Emperor, summoned a meeting to consult about the aforesaid matter of their Messiah's not coming, as was expected; and finding no foundation in the Scripture to own any such foppery, they did joyntly and unanimously relin- quish that their groundless assertion, and not onely so, but did with the like unanimity confess and acknowledge, that lesus Christ, whom the Christians worshipped, was the true Messiah, and that none other was to be waited upon or expected, until his second coming to judge the quick and the dead. ....' 7.

Still, both the currency of the news regarding the fortunes of the Jewish nation, and some of the specific details of this report, are substantiated by other contemporary English writings (although all of these reports probably derive from the same original source). One author, writing in 1647, anticipated the immi- nent fall of Antichrist and the terrestrial coming of Christ. He had been con- vinced by a variety of signs, including the knowledge that even those people the Jewes, according to certaine and credible information, are at this time assembling themselves together into one body from out of all countreys, wherinto they have been driven with a resolution to regaine the holy land once more out of the hand of Ottoman ....'o Furthermore, an Englishman confirmed five years after the event that in 1650, "a great Councel of Jews," three thousand strong, had met in Hungary to debate the possible authenticity of Christ's messianic status. No mention is made here of a previous disconfirmation, and the result of the meeting is not mass conversion, but an agreement to meet again in three years' time. Yet many present suspect that their Messiah has already come in the person of Jesus Christ, and the author is informed that the Jews look favorably on Protestants-London divines in particular-because of the love manifested in their continuous hope for a Jewish conversion. The author has been persuaded by his friends to publish this account "because they do conceive it to be a preparative and hopeful sign of the Jew Conver- sion ... ." fused in his account owing to misinformation in the source on which he was obliged to rely for knowledge of the tract's import: see pp. 154-55.

In 1651, for example, an astrologer predicted the fall of the pope, the salvation of the Jews, and the coming of Christ, all to be accomplished within the next three years. Thus in his prophecy for September of 1652, he inquires: "Are the Jewes marching towards Jerusalem or no? Let them take sober advice, the time is not yet."'2 In conversation with the royalist mathematician William Oughtred in 1655, John Evelyn was warned "of some extraordinary event to happen the following yeare," possibly the conversion of the Jews "by our Saviours visible appearance. .. ."*3 During the 1650s, Henry Oldenburg, the first secretary of the Royal Society, was already maintaining a voluminous and heterogeneous correspondence with intellectuals and scientific virtuosi throughout Europe. In 1657 he enthusiastically solicited the opinion of Menasseh ben Israel, the Amsterdam rabbi who led the campaign for read- mission, on the subject of a manuscript he had recently seen on the Conti- nent which prophesied the imminent restitution of the Jews and the coming of the Messiah-"I say the coming, meaning that which you take to be the first and we are persuaded will be the second ..."14 Oldenburg was so struck by this prophecy that he copied it into his commonplace book,"5 at- tributing it to "HABITE EN SION," whom he identified in his letter to Menas- seh as one "Lambermont." The manuscript is a mixture of exhortation to readiness for the Jews' coming conversion and detailed numerological demonstration, based on Daniel and Revelation, that "le grand et notable iour du Seigneur" will begin in 1663.16 As Cromwell's Protectorate gave way which also documents the messianic excitement surrounding Sabbatai's second proclamation (see below). 12.

A controversy over whether or not the natives of America were in fact the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel endured from 1650 to 1661.17 A tract of 1658 reaffirmed the imminence of the conversion to Christ, telling how Jews soon will begin to read the New Testament and how they already acknowledge their guilt for having killed the true Messiah. In the middle of the tract is printed a letter to "J.D." (Joannes Duraeus) from Peter Serrarius (Pierre Serrurier), the Dutch millenarian who in a few years was to be so instrumental in bringing Sabbatai's actions to the con- sciousness of English readers. Serrarius reports having had recent conversa- tions with the leader of a delegation of Jerusalem Jews to Amsterdam, who evinced, through "Cabalistical Notions" and other sentiments, an impres- sive appreciation of the close similarity between Jesus Christ and his own conception of the Messiah."' In the following year, a collection of sundry prophecies assured its readers that as soon as the "Great Turk" and the pope had been destroyed-that is, by 1663-"the despised and dispersed Jewes" would be ready for conversion, "and that by meanes of English Divines... ."'9 Another tract envisioned the subjugation "of the Pope by the Christians, and of the Turk by the Converted Jews...."20 In 1662, Samuel Hartlib-chiliast, educational reformer, and fellow of the Royal Society-and John Worthington engaged in a sanguine correspondence concerning "news of the Jews' fasting and humiliations. . . ," and the implication that "the redemption of Israel is drawing near . ..."21 Their in- formant was Serrarius, who published, in the same year, a tract warning the general public that Christ, on his way to greater things, was about to recol- lect and convert "the dispersed nation of the Jews."22 In 1664, a millenarian 17.

The author cautioned the Jewish nation to expect a great battle between the Turk and Christendom; ... then shall you arise, and under the Ban[njer of King Charles with an Army of a hundred forty and four thousand; twelve thousand of every Tribe go to your one Land, and possess it for ever and ever; and you shall believe in Jesus Christ, who is your everlasting King.... He adds: "I am sure we shall be delivered in a short time both Jew and Gen- tile. And King Charles Steeward [i.e., Stuart] is Gods chosen Vessel to deliver us all .... ."23 It is clear from the variety of predictions and prophets that these notices cannot all be part of a unified campaign to prepare the world for the second coming of Sabbatai Sevi in 1666. Rather, they are evidence that something was in the English air regarding the restoration of the Jews, and that when Sabbatai reappeared in mid- 1665, observers of apparently diverse ideologies and connections-royalists, republicans, amateur scientists, professional astrologers, Puritan prophets-were ready to entertain news of him with some enthusiasm. Having brought his chronicle of prophetic events up to a certain point, the clergyman-pamphleteer Nathanael Homes added this portentous note: As for the present year 1665 (within five dayes now expiring) I have not medled with the occurrences thereof; because of them, Mens Pockets are full of Letters; their Hands full of Gazetts; their Eares full of Reports and Tidings; and their Eyes sufficiently perceive the Jewes cease Trading, pack up, and are Marching.24 George Wither, poet and chief Cassandra for England over the past forty years,25 by 1665 had acquired sufficient circumspection regarding the work- 23.

They, who are now reported to call themselves Israelites, and to be the Posterity of those who were carried out of their own Country before the Babylonish Captivity, and said to have been ever since obscured, as it were, from the world, and now repairing to possess the inheritance of their Forefathers, are not to us ascertained to be such as they are famed, or to have made that egress, and progress lately reported; For, we have yet received no Letters, that I hear of, from any of our Merchants or Factors trading in or near those parts; (but all seems to come from one root26) I shall therefore believe neither matter of Fact, nor what some conjecture will be the conse- quence of that rumour, till better evidence thereof; nor will miscensure their charitable hope, who already believing what they hear, conceive it may pos- sibly be a Preparatory, to that Conversion of the Jews which is by them ex- pected.27 As we shall see, Wither did not have long to wait for letters from "our Merchants or Factors," but this doubt regarding the reliability of his news sources was only one reason for his caution: For, it seems not to me improbable (considering the near approaching of Christs Kingdom) but that, the grand Anti-Christ, and all other petty An- tichrists with their confederates, will improve their several Mysteries of ini- quity to the utmost, that their Supream Prince the Devil, may gather together a Rabble pretending to be Jews extraordinarily congregated, by Divine Providence, to delude those who profess a belief in the true Messias already come.28 Thus the news of Sabbatai and "that impression which I perceive it hath upon many" threaten to realize the danger which is always potential in the concern of Christian eschatology with Jewish affairs-the danger that con- 26.

Taken together, these sources span a period from the sum- mer of 1665 to the summer of 1667, and provide the material for a history of the events in the Levant as they became known to English speaking people. II Rumors that the Jews, and especially the Ten Tribes, were marching toward Jerusalem first became fairly common in England in the autumn of 1665.3' Letters from Scotland, which were collected and printed with other letters in several tracts before the end of the year, tell slightly conflicting ver- sions of the story that a ship, cast up in Aberdeen by a storm on October 23, was manned by a crew that spoke "broken Hebrew" and rigged in blue (or white) silken threads with satin sails on which were inscribed: "THESE ARE OF THE TEN TRIBES OF ISRAEL, which was to discover them to be Jews: Their 29.

And many last year were in expectation To hear thereof, ere now, a confirmation. Wither died in 1667, disappointed in at least some of his expectations for the year of the beast. 31.

Being in a spirit of Judaism, in great power, led by a holy man, doing great miracles, and all things answering the description of the Messias, they may ex- pect that it would be a testimony that the Christians and other people and Na- tions should be gathered in to the Jews, and not the Jews into Christ. The informant replies that they having suffered great afflictions for the sins of their fathers, are now come out from Idolatry, to live according to the purity and perfection of the Law, and shall from thence be raised to the knowledge of Christ; he under- standeth this of a Nation to be born in a day, and their Convertion to be their birth . .. he further saith, That all the Churches called by the Name of Chris- tians, are full of vanity, and that they must be purified to whom Christ will teach his truth, and from them shall run a stream overflowing the whole world, whereby the Powers of the world shall be overthrown, and the right of Christ in and with his Saints shall then begin to be established; He pitches much upon 1666. and confidently believes, That all the Prophesies of the Old and New Testament Centers in it, it being the time that shall give beginning to that holy and Spiritual Kingdome.37 Thus the complacency which is evident in the reflex assumption that only their imminent conversion to Christianity could mobilize large numbers of Jews is tempered considerably by the important proviso that faith in Christ has nothing to do with contemporary Christianity.

Information concerning the Jews during this period was not confined to the tracts wholly devoted to that subject. By December, a correspondent of William Sancroft, Dean of St. Paul's, was relating all he knew concerning the Jews' recollection, and, like George Wither but for different reasons, earnestly debating its credibility. He has received several letters regarding "the Generall calling of ye Jews," and asks Sancroft his opinion of them. I am not apt to Credit much of this, for I ...

Few in this place believe it, but many wish for it. You will tell your friend what you hear and judge of this matter. For myself, so long as this news is not conveyed from Constantinople by trustworthy men, I cannot believe it, since that city is most of all concerned in it.39 It was in the same month of December that reports from the Middle East, relayed through the United Provinces and elsewhere, began to be printed in the official English newspapers, which were controlled by Charles II's Secretary of State and Surveyor of the Press and were the sole beneficiaries of the Court monopoly of licensed news. The official response to Sabbatai- who is for the first time identified by name in these accounts-mixes didac- tic doubt with a casual sort of belief. The newspapers connect the reports "about three months ago" of the lost Tribes of Israel with later news that a prophet, having secured the support of the rabbis of Jerusalem and of a number of Turkish rulers by "working several miracles," has foretold the 38.

This particular report, from Haarlem, ends with the following observation: It is strange, that not onely the Jews here, but some hundreds that own the name of Christians among us, think themselves concerned in it, though the wiser sort of people sufficiently understand the cheat.40 A letter from Smyrna dated November 30, which the Gazette did not print for two months, fills in with scornful incredulity some of the details of Sab- batai's rise to prominence-his "banishment" from Smyrna "five or six years ago" for claiming messianic status; the dependence of his present authority on the slavish adoration of both "the multitude" and the "chiefest of the Jews," so "that no Jew dare open his mouth against him . . ."; his promise "within a few days to raise a dead man from the Grave."41 At least six42 more tracts devoted entirely to the Jews were printed early in 1666. The majority of these tracts clearly refer to Sabbatai and to his prophet Nathan even though they are largely composed of letters dating from autumn of the previous year, and all of them provide a perspective on Jewish affairs generally more sympathetic (if still characteristically Christian) than the one we have encountered in the Court newspapers. Two of the tracts are virtually identical and consist primarily of a letter signed by Serrarius, who recounts, as he first learned of these events on November 17, the early rejection of the prophet "Nathan Levi" at Jerusalem and his subsequent vindication at Gaza. One of Nathan's miracles was to have entered the sepulchre of the prophet Zechariah, raised him from the dead, and obtained his forgiveness for the sins of his people. Nathan has anointed "Rabbi Sabothas-Levi" King of Judea, and plans to travel with him to Constantinople to receive the crown from the Turkish sul- tan himself. A letter from the Spanish ambassador in Rome adds the reac- tion there to the news of a new king and prophet in Judea-"that now the 40. Gazette, no. 8, December 7-11, 1665.

Serrarius concludes with his own Christian application: ... as now they went to the sepulchre of Zachary the Prophet, to bemoan their sins against him; so the time shall come, that they shal go likewise to the Sepulchre of Jesus Christ, whom their Fathers once Crucified; and then will the King of Glory appear, and this King, Sabothi-Levi, and all other Kings, will submit unto Him.43 A third tract, although printed in February and aware of events contem- poraneous with this date, names neither Nathan nor Sabbatai and is largely devoted to the lengthy narration of an episode whose legendary quality recalls the earliest tracts of the previous autumn, which told of the restora- tion of the Jews before more specific details of the Sabbatian movement had become available. The substance of this episode is that in Persia, represen- tatives of the Ten Tribes of Israel have obtained the safe passage of neighboring Jews to Jerusalem with the aid of natural prodigies clearly reminiscent of Exodus.44 After printing the letter which contains this narra- tion, the compiler of the tract, rather than making the customary Christian assumption that recollection may well mean conversion, observes that Jewish confidence of their restoration increases daily-"which (it seems) our Christians, for the most part so (as it were) envy: and so can hardly believe any such thing."45 Here, as in A New Letter from Aberdeen, the reflex Chris- tian bias is absent; but whereas the former tract envisions a compromise between Jewish and Christian messianism, this one would seem to relegate the two prophetic systems to distinct and uncomprehending worlds with no common ground of expectation. There remain two other tracts of early 1666 which openly publicize the identities of the prophet and the Messiah whose reputations they extend. One records that Nathan, having embarked for Smyrna "to speak with our 43. The Wonder of all Christendom; and Great Miracles, Wrought by The Famous Nathan, A Prophet of the Jewes....

Unquestionable miracles and a proliferation of prophets, dead and resur- rected, guaranteed his belief in the event. The belief of others was secured by less dramatic and orthodox means: ". . . the Bashaw [i.e., pasha] of Gaza giveth certain Credit to all our Prophet saith, for the said Bashaw hath a Brother which is a great Astrologer, who assures him of the truth." The two and a half tribes are converging on Gaza and are scheduled to arrive in the near future, an event which is soon confirmed by another letter. "As for the king Sabbathai, the Jews here [in Amsterdam] keep close what is of him...." Even so, it is known that he has arrived in Constantinople accompanied by his four (elsewhere, four hundred) prophets from Aleppo, "and was reverently received, and led about publickly by the Grand Signior [i.e., the sultan]."46 The latter eminence, it is said, "will be content to yield him the Crown of whole Palestine." Yet a letter of February 9, 1666 from Paris tells that Sabbatai is claiming, not to be the Messiah, but to have been raised by divine revelation for the purpose of gathering the Jews together and teaching them to know the Messiah when he comes. Even so, he has the con- stant aid of prodigies and miracles, and of the prophet Elijah himself, who has persuaded many who were at first hostile to accept Sabbatai with amity. In the case of the sultan, persuasion meant not only the miraculous ap- pearance of Elijah, but also a shower of gigantic hailstones and a two-day period of darkness. In short, Sabbatai has emerged from his time of waiting and has "demonstrated he did act in the name of God. . ." The number of prophets increases daily; in June the redemption of Israel "will be published throughout the whole World."47 At the end of this particular tract, the author of the concluding letter gives a short excerpt from one of the prayer books which were composed by Nathan to celebrate the present coming and which 46.

In late January, the English consul at Aleppo alluded obscurely to the "great trouble" which the Jews of his locale are likely to encounter "about a prophet of theirs. . . ."5 The official Gazette reported, in a number of issues, the alliance of Jews and Arabs under the militant Jew "Giorobaon" (Jeroboam), a native of Aden, "who by his powerful Oratory, hath in a few days reduced all the Citizens to his Devotion... ." Drawing thousands of Semitic peoples to his side "in order to free them from their slavery to the Turk," Giorobaon soon takes Medina and Mecca, destroys the tomb of Mohammed, and presses on toward the Holy Land.52 By mid- March, reports have transferred this militancy to Sabbatai, who "leads no less then a hundred thousand after him, and is very severe against all Turks killing all they meet with."" The letter itself, from Constantinople, is dated February 9. The following issue of the Gazette54 carries a communication from Smyrna dated a full month earlier, in which Sabbatai's followers, although numerous, are said to be pacific, and hence "the Turks do not yet oppose them." As of this writing, Sabbatai is still en route to Constantino- ple, "to demand the Land of Promise from the Grand Seignior [i.e., the sul- 48. See A New Letter Concerning the Jewes ..., p. 6.

Writing at the same time that these two issues of the Gazette ap- peared, Oldenburg repeats the earlier report that "ye pretended king . . . is said not to assume ye dignity and office of ye Messiah, but to lead to him.""5 Many of the writings which have been cited thus far are conscious not only of the eschatological, but also of the commerical, implications of the affairs they discuss. Of Constantinople we are told that "the most part of the Jews here meddle no more with Trading, but prepare to go for Jerusalem...."56 In Smyrna, "our Trade has been of late much obstructed in these parts, all the Jews being in a kinde of distraction upon the arrival of Sabadai...."57 At Jerusalem, the followers of Nathan abstain "not onely from all Vanity, but from Merchandizing and Trading; and especially from Exchange (which Nature terms to be meer Usury) ... this change of heart . .. is not only so in Judea, but also at Legorn and Venice ... ."58 Thus from Leghorn have em- barked "60 Jews bound for Alexandria, ... in particular a Doctor of the Law, with all his family in search of their new Prophet,""59 while within Leghorn letters are received from the Jews of Alexandria "to send them no more Business, they will have no further thoughts of it, but of higher Matters."60 The legendary account of the Persian Jews who set off for Jerusalem with ambassadors from the Ten Tribes is preoccupied with the monetary ramifications of their departure. The king of Persia objects to being deprived of the Jews' riches; he is reassured that what is sought is "the naked Persons of those men, leaving behind them all their Wealth and Houses"; after the departure, the Persian people conspire to seize the estates of the Jews, are struck with a temporary blindness, and ruefully resolve to follow the pilgrims and to persuade them to take their wealth after all, there being "some Divine Thing... under these Events.""6 This preoccupation could be observed, by English readers, to have force closer to home than Persia or the Levant.

This reaction bypasses the real significance of the encounter between the commercial and the eschatological factors in these Christian accounts, but a closer examination of the phenomenon must be deferred until the bare narration of Sabbatai's affairs, as seen from the English perspective, has been completed. According to some sources, the sultan's indulgence toward Sabbatai ended upon his arrival in Constantinople. First denounced as a traitor to the Ottoman Empire, they say, Sabbatai was forced to submit to the massacre of his followers and to a variety of personal indignities, and was at last flayed alive and decapitated.68 A different source, on the other hand, reports that Sabbatai, having been "proued . . an Imposture" by the sultan's Great Vizier, was given the choice of enduring disgraceful display or obtain- ing the payment of a large ransom by the Jewish nation. The writer speculates that the latter course will be followed, "and tis well if they so es- cape, but twill bee some tyme before [they] can regaine their C[redit] which is noe small Detriment to trade."'' By the summer of 1666 it had become clear that Sabbatai had been, not killed, but transferred to the castle prison in Gallipoli, "whither," in the words of an official newspaper, "the poorer sort of people flock to see him, but the richer pull their necks out of the col- ler, as having been already sufficiently fleec't for such Visits."70 A more sympathetic letter asserts that as long as the Messiah was in Constantinople, he was treated with the respect owing to his eminence. Domiciled in one of the sultan's palaces, Sabbatai was allowed "the free exercise" of all religious ceremonies and complete liberty in receiving visitors and in going abroad himself. A "pillar of fire surrounded with severall starres was seen hovering over th[e] place where he was . . ," as the Messiah awaited a sign from God that the time for a public manifestation had come.

And as before, in "this seeming place of restraint" Sabbatai is treated like one of the sultan's "Chiefest Commanders," awaiting only the arrival of Nathan to proclaim the redemption of Israel with great wonders and miracles.7 This sanguine explanation of the removal to Gallipoli was not necessary, according to the Gazette, for the followers of Sabbatai in Smyrna, who were instructed in a letter from him to stand fast, and not to waver in their opinions, for he had yet eight months left [i.e., at the end of April?] to work their restauration to Jerusalem, which he promises not of himself, the Prophesy proceeding from a great Seer at Gaza [i.e., Nathan], who likewise foretells that their long expected Messia must be a man of suffering, before he can arrive at his Triumphal Throne .... 72 Hence the English were being told as late as October that the hopes of the believers remain undimmed as long as Sabbatai stays in prison, since he, "at a distance, has so besotted them, as to turn their solemn Fast for the Destruction of the Temple into a Jubile, for the solemnity of his birth day...."73 And the hostile summary of the Sabbatian movement which the astrologer Wil- liam Lilly provides in October and directly connects with long-standing Chris- tian expectations for the "wonderful year" of 1666 can only remain inconclusive with regard to the fate of the Messiah.74 It was as late as November that the train of events of the past few months was reported to the English public by the Gazette, in its final notice concerning Sabbatai. Repeating some of its earlier observations on the foolish credulity of the Jews, the Gazette gives only the barest outlines of this climactic episode in Sabbatai's career.

This is the official and humiliating account of Sabbatai's apostasy two months after it had occurred.76 Yet English merchants in Leghorn were receiving fuller and more circumstantial news within three weeks of the event. On September 25, their correspondents in Smyrna report the rumor that Sabbatai, having been ordered to Adrianople, "within two daies Journey of said Citty was Cutt off by Emperiall Command. . . ."77 Their newsletter of October 9 corrects this story and promises now to informe y[o]u of the end of the Jews frenzie in seeking a Messiah wherin shall not Spare to giue you a large and True acco[un]tt the beleuing beguiled Jews flocked to him to the castles from all parts, by whole familes, men, women &amp; Children amoungst which was a Learned Jew from Germany78 (some say Polonia [i.e., Poland]) who communed with him in the castles 7 or 8 daies, and finding his pretences, Arguments, and hopes vaine; went unto ye Turkish Mosque and turned Turk, declaring that this Sabatai Sevi was an Im- posture and unless were taken of the Jews would rebell against the Grand Sig- [nio]r....

First, although their status as merchants was (as we have seen) no prerequisite for such comments, the writers are quick to note the commercial implications of Sabbatai's apostasy: ... those people [the Jews] will suddenly returne againe to theire sences, &amp; Trade will reuiue, for 'tis not to bee expressed how farr they were gone in delusion....

A long letter of November 5, 1666 allows us entry into the mind of one who, like many Christians, approached news of a messianic movement with utter seriousness, and therefore, being Christian, with considerable am- bivalence.

We see this ingenuous Christian struggling with the unyielding puzzle of a promise whose exhilara- tion almost obscures the differences between the second coming of Christ, for which the author yearns, and the first coming of an alien deity-the in- eluctable Jewishness of Sabbatai and his movement. The effect is one of massive simplicity, as if Nathan's pronouncements were momentary lapses in one who knows better, as if Sabbatai's claim to godhead, and the Jewish people's adoring concurrence with this claim, were obscure and irresponsi- ble deviations from the masterplan entitled "The Conversion of the Jews." That the leader of the Jews should finally have chosen to convert, not to Christ, but to Mohammed, must have come as an astonishing blow to all veteran saints of the English revolution and its incessant overturnings, for whom the present commotions of the Jews were the last of those signs of the 86.

The alternative to the shock of disconfirmation was, of course, to allow the hope of false prophecy by Antichrist to replace that of Jewish reformation by Christ, and in this context Sabbatai's surprising conversion to the Turkish god might also appear to be "a dessein agst Christianity," no longer baffling because infused with the aura of the anticipated, apocalyptic confrontation between the Turk and all Christendom.87 We may conclude our investigation into English reactions to the d6noue- ment of Sabbatai's drama by returning to two observers whose views we en- countered earlier, while Sabbatai's fortunes were still ascendant. The first is Henry Oldenburg, who remains interested but noncommittal to the end of the affair. Writing in early November to the under-secretary of state Joseph Williamson, Oldenburg thanks him "for the care of my two letters. One of them from Amsterdam expresses some doubt of ye news concerning ye Jewish kings being turn'd Turk. ... " The letter which he quotes summarily relates Sabbatai's apostasy, and continues in an apparent contradiction: But our Jews here belieue no such matter, but rest confident, that this work will goe on. It was heretofore generally thought, yt when he went to the Grand Sign[io]r, it would cost him his life, but now he is entertain'd with honor, and has no harm done him, they conclude he must be turn'd Turk."8 Whatever the reason for this contradiction, the sanguine sentiments of the letter no doubt derive from the amazing, indefatigable Serrarius, who wrote to Oldenburg in the middle of 1667, his millenarian spirits and his deter- mination only whetted by the mysteries of divine dispensation: As for the Jews their hope revives more and more. Those of Vienna having sent an Expres to Adrianopolis, do writ, that their Man doth affirm, to have spoken with Sabithai Sebi and found him, not turned Turck, but a Jew as ever in the same hope and expectation as before. Yea, from Smyrna by way of Marcelles [Marseilles] we have, that at Constantinople the Jews return to their fasting and praying as before: and so doe some here [in Amsterdam] likewise. 87.

It has been customary for some modern historians to reduce the eschatological factor in seventeenth century English belief to a sharp and ideologically significant disjunction between progressive rationalism and regressive superstition.90 This reduction receives some support from the convenient formulations of contemporary royalists like John Evelyn, who looked back to English excitement over the Sabba- tian movement as principally an emanation from "the Heads of Phanatical Enthusiasts, who Dreamed of a Fift Monarchy ... ,"91 but it does not do justice to the phenomenon as we have come to know it in the preceding pages. True, official sources like the licensed newspapers were rather con- sistently scornful of the messianic activities they described, and a number of the most enthusiastic observers made clear their sympathy for ideas and in- stitutions which were recognizably opposed to the Stuart establishment. Thus Oldenburg's commonplace book transcription of Le reveille matin des Juifs anticipates the coming of "une cinquieme ... monarchie";92 Serrarius is quite frank in his millenarianism93 and unashamedly associates himself with Henry Jessey, the well known Baptist minister;94 and a letter in one of 89. Correspondence of Oldenburg, 3:447, no. 652, July 5, 1667. 90. This habit of thought has been corrected most notably by William M. Lamont, Godly Rule (London, 1969) and Keith Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic (London, 1971). The present argument also aims to revise the equally prevalent notion that this antithetical at- titude, once eradicated from revolutionary England, may safely be understood to date from the Restoration of Charles II. 91.

The dichotomy of "rationalism versus superstition" is no more useful in dis- tinguishing seventeenth century scientists from prophets than it is in separating royalists from republicans or Anglicans from dissenters. Some of the most "enthusiastic" eschatological prophecy of the Restoration period-including the enormous amount centering on the year 1666--was produced in aid of the royalist and Anglican cause and approved by enthusiasts of the Royal Society, for the noblest work of empiricists still lay in the reconciliation of the new discoveries with the old systems and cor- respondences.98 Many English observers made the obvious connection between news from the Levant and the great expectations for 1666 which were already quite familiar to them,99 and for this reason alone it is not surprising that Sabbatai should have been so thoroughly Christianized and Anglicized in the English accounts. Never far from the minds of observers was the ques- tion, "What is the larger meaning of these Jewish activities?" and the most frequent response was to attribute to them a Christian significance. Thus the continual expectation of an imminent conversion to Christ; thus the fear that the publicizing of Jewish hopes-seen as a conscious stratagem of the Jews and/or of Antichrist-will produce the wrong kind of conversion;'00 95.

What seems most constant in many of the writings we have examined is a fundamental excitement at the restoration of the Jews, and it is not always so clear that their conversion, too, is necessary to this emotion. 02 Even more, the editor of the tract concerning the Persian Jews finds in the Christian response to Jewish restoration no thought of conversion, but only "envy."l03 Finally, the authoritative informant who is cited in the letter of October 10, 1665 pointedly refuses to interpret the commotions of the Jews as evidence sup- porting either orthodox Christian, or traditional Jewish, messianic expecta- tions. They are instead the prelude to the "reconversion," by a select Jewish band, of unregenerate Christians to the true Christ; they are the means of es- tablishing the rule of Christ and his saints in an earthly, yet "holy and Spiritual Kingdome."'04 It seems significant that this vision, unusual in its attempt to reconcile Jewish and Christian hopes, should also seek to reconcile the material and the spiritual in its particular version of the kingdom to come, for this recon- ciliation provides a way of understanding the persistence of the commercial factor in eschatological speculation on Sabbatai. One might well object, of course, that there is nothing special to be understood here. The commercial factor is a given of antisemitic stereotype-the hypocritical Jew whose pretence to being distinguished ("chosen") for his spiritual qualities masks a soul of venality and materialism. What better type of the "bloud-sucking Jew" than Sabbatai Sevi himself, who, when all else fails, prefers the material comforts of an honorary post in the sultan's court to the ultimate sacrifice of religious martyrdom? It is true that Sabbatai's apostasy might be taken by Christians to fulfill this stereotype, just as his messianic claim could be seen as a device for "fleecing the poorer sort of people."10' But it is important to recognize that the predominant hostile image of the Jew in commercially conscious reports by Christians is less that of the materialistic and hypocritical pseudo-Messiah than that of the impractical and credulous 101.

This is not to deny that the juxtaposition of eschatological and commercial factors was a great reality of the Sabbatian movement. Anxious remarks that the Jews' abandonment of their trade might have repercussions far beyond the mercantile community were to some extent justified and certainly to be expected from agents of English trading com- panies, and they were made frequently by skeptical Jews as well as by non- English Christians. Nevertheless, there persists a sense that the reality of the movement provides an occasion for the expression of anxieties that pre-exist and extend well beyond it, quite possibly for others besides the English. These anxieties, however diverse their expression, seem to reduce to one central problem: What are the material implications of spiritual behavior and belief.?-a problem which in its very nature entails the corollary: What will be the spiritual results of material activity? The common English vacil- lation between the eschatological and the commercial implications of the movement is best seen, I think, not as an unconscious display of the writers' material hypocrisy, but as a manifestation of their constant preoccupation with nothing less than the problematic relation between the material and the spiritual realms of human experience. Ample evidence of this preoccupation in accounts of the Sabbatian movement suggests that the history of Sabbatai constituted a major crux for the English investigation of the material- spiritual relationship. We may go further than this and hypothesize that the interest in Sabbatai was a late, perhaps the final, expression of seventeenth century England's fascination with the "Hebraic" frame of mind, an ex- traordinarily important phenomenon which may be explained, in part, by the light which Hebraic thought was capable of shedding on this dialec- tic.'06 What aspects of life in seventeenth century England, and during the Restoration period in particular, might cause people to become unusually preoccupied with the relationship between the material and the spiritual? What aspects of Hebraic thought, as the English understood it, might lend 106. From this perspective the traditional antisemitic stereotype appears to be less an ex- planation of a specific historical fact-the persistence of the commercial factor in es- chatological speculation on Sabbatai-than a rather more general historical fact which is itself in need of explanation. An obvious realm of investigation would be the social and economic relations traditionally accorded to Jews within medieval and early modern Christian com- munities. The following discussion might in turn suggest a prior avenue of thought-that the effort to define Jews as an alien religious persuasion dominated by certain economic proclivities has roots in the Christian perception of Judaism as a dangerously seductive reconciliation of the spiritual and the material.</page><page sequence="34">164 MICHAEL McKEON themselves to the fruitful consideration of this relationship? Any limited at- tempt to deal with these questions must, like the present one, have recourse to vast generalization. Sabbatai's second appearance roughly coincided, in England, with a heated renewal of the toleration debate which had fed public controversy throughout the seventeenth century. However the post-Restoration context altered the terms of discourse in certain basic respects. A primary tenet of many participants in this debate was that England had two great "interests," religion and trade. John Humfrey provides a convenient for- mulation: ... there is a double Interest (I apprehend) to be distinguished and considered: That of Religion it self, and that of the Nation. The advance of Religion does consist much in the unity of its Professors ... according to the Scripture. The advance of the Nation does lie in the freedom and flourishing of Trade, and uniting the whole Body in the Common benefit and dependence on the Government. '07 The task of controversialists was to reconcile these interests, if such a feat was possible. More specifically, the argument of proponents of toleration was that the apparent dichotomy of spiritual and material considerations was a false one: by successfully seeking the religious interest of England Charles II could simultaneously fulfill its political and economic interests. This argument was based on two related claims. The religious interest of England lies, as Humfrey says, "in the unity of its Professors," a condition which will come when all dissenters are reconciled to their government, but which will never be achieved so long as they remain alienated by such legislation as the Clarendon Code. Furthermore, since dissenters comprise the majority of the "trading part of the nation," the political accommoda- tion of dissent will serve England's commercial interest as well. The sub- tleties of this argument are considerable but need not detain us. What is most significant, in the present context, is the reliance on an essentially political or economic criterion of interest, the attempt to reconcile spiritual and material concerns by elevating a standard derived from the latter category to the status of an overarching principle. Opponents of toleration found their most telling argument in the total 107. A Case of Conscience ... (1669), pp. 12-13.</page><page sequence="35">SABBATAI SEVI IN ENGLAND 165 rejection of this intellectual strategy of appealing to interest. As Herbert Thorndike expressed it, men may amuse themselves, with the instance of the United Provinces; which, they say, flourish in trade and riches, by maintaining all Religions. But the question is of Religion, not of Trade, nor Riches. If it could be said, that their Religion is improved, with their Trade, the example were considerable. But, they that would restore and improve the Religion, that flourished in England thirty years ago, must not take up with the base Alloy of that which is seen in the United Provinces. Nor is this a reproach to them, but a truth of Gods Word; that Religion and Trade cannot be both at once at the height.'0s Thorndike would require Humfrey to pay greater heed to his own defini- tion: the religious interest consists not simply in the unity of its professors, but in a unity "according to the Scripture"; and he would dispute to the end the idea that Scripture sanctions the principles embodied in Protestant dis- sent. But although the supreme criterion of interest seems to be replaced, in Thorndike's analysis, by the supreme criterion of religion, his concluding observation has a very different import. "Religion and trade cannot be both at once at the height": the implication of the passage is that religion does in- deed have supremacy, but that its province is a separate one which exercises no beneficial sway over commercial arrangements. The two cannot coexist in prosperity, for the criteria by which each is judged to prosper are, by the general laws of divine arrangement, quite clearly opposed, perhaps even contradictory. It is Thorndike's, and not Humfrey's, attitude which most directly approximates the common approach in modern thought to the rela- tion between the spiritual and the material spheres, but it is the policy of religious toleration which Humfrey advocates, and the policy of free trade with which it is closely associated, that triumphed in the years succeeding this debate. R. H. Tawney described long ago the historical transformation which reached its crucial stage in the seventeenth century: The theory of a hierarchy of values, embracing all human interests and ac- tivities in a system of which the apex is religion, is replaced by the conception of separate and parallel compartments, between which a due balance should be maintained, but which have no vital connection with each other.... 108.

Religion has been converted from the keystone which holds together the social edifice into one department within it .... 109 The point may be made in a somewhat different manner. The decay of hierarchy in seventeenth century England was a dialectical process in which socioeconomic and ideological change reinforced one another-in which unprecedented mobility and the disorienting divergence of power, wealth, and status were both the cause and the consequence of a growing conviction that the ethical and the social pyramids of English life were far from cor- relative. In the face of expanding capitalist enterprise and the creation of un- anticipated dilemmas in social ethics, the Anglican establishment's policy came to consist in deploring the amorality of commercial relations rather than in propounding new and authoritative schemes of religious morality suited to the new economic and social context. 0 It was, rather, the propo- nents of "liberty" in religion and trade who still envisioned a unitary "hierarchy of values, embracing all human interests and activities"-except that the apex of this pyramid was no longer religion but interest. Liberal Anglicans of the Restoration period arrived at the same position from a somewhat different direction; in 1664 John Tillotson was preaching: "This is the Wisdom of Religion, that upon consideration of the whole, and casting up all things together, it does advise and lead us to our best Interest.""' We have devoted sufficient attention to the subject to perceive that dur- ing the seventeenth century, an enormous change in attitudes toward the relation of the material to the spiritual was underway, and that one attempt to redefine this relation was being made during the 1660s, in the toleration debate on religion and trade. We may understand people like Humfrey and Tillotson to be engaged in a last effort to forge a monistic system of "spiritual materialism," an effort whose limitations were predetermined by the increasing secular materialism of the age which produced it. It is my 109. Religion and the Rise of Capitalism (New York, [1926], 1958), pp. 15, 228. It will be ap- parent from the following comments that I believe Tawney hastens somewhat the speed with which the complete transformation in attitude toward religion was achieved. 110.

"Many will allow [Christ] a kingdom in heavon," Serrarius observed in the summer of 1667, "but not on Earth. .... but other was the Expectation of the Saints at all times.. .."~I2 Christian millenarianism has from the beginning been greatly indebted to the messianic idea in Jewish thought, for an essential premise of this idea is the expectation of a fully historical and terrestrial coming which is of course simultaneously infused with profound spiritual meaning. The history of the Catholic Church is the history of a gradual repudiation of millenarian materialism by orthodox commentators, until the Reformation and especially the English Puritan movement made the millenarian frame of mind once again relatively respectable."3 The ex- traordinary appeal of millenarian expectation for many participants in the English revolution was that by asserting the direct engagement of God in the present political, social, and economic alterations, it made of their material struggle a spiritual event and gave to their spiritual hopes a material means of fulfillment. In the millenarian tracts of the revolutionary decades, mystical allusions to the prophetic books of Scripture are often inseparable from very programmatic specifications of how Christ's earthly reign will- has already begun to-transform the daily social and economic relations of the English common people. And this hope did not die with the Restoration. In January 1661, Thomas Venner and his band of Fifth Monarchy Men swept through the streets of London to the cry of "King Jesus," in a very notorious, if not the very last, attempt to usher in forcibly the millennial reign of Christ on earth. This brief uprising was accompanied by the dis- semination of a tract which sought to set out the rebels' aims. After traditional, apocalyptic anticipations of the character of Christ's kingdom, the tract proceeds to observe that some may be ready. . . to mistake, and misapprehend us; some to malicious ends, not knowing what we mean by the Kingdom of Christ, as if some strange thing ... were intended, as that Christ should immediately appear to head an Army .... by the Kingdom of Christ, or that part of it ... which respects the Government of a well ordered Common-wealth, we mean ...

That all the poor of the Land might be set to work, and we might have no beggars: That a due regulation be made with respect to the Natives, in the Manufacture and Trade of the Common-wealth: That there be no transporting of Leather unwrought, Fullers Earth, or other Commodities that may spoil the Manufacture of the Land, and impoverish the poor Tradesman: That Timber be preserved and in- creased: And whatsoever can be named of a common or publick good, we mean by the Kingdome of Christ....114 The seventeenth century Kingdom of Christ is clearly, in this version, a spiritual fulfillment of very earthly and material values. Recently Frances Yates has drawn attention to a related dialectic in the thought of seventeenth century Baconian Puritans, whose revolutionary advocacy of incremental and progressive scientific experimentation may be seen as "a somewhat materialist interpretation of the work they must do in preparation" for the millennial coming of Christ."5 The gulf in substance and expression that separates post-Restoration ideologies-millenarianism, Baconianism, latitudinarianism, proto- liberalism-should not be allowed to obscure for us what is still common, at this crucial historical moment, in their increasingly divergent visions. Implicit in the cause of Sabbatai Sevi, as in the reign of Christ upon earth and in that wise religion which leads us to our best interest, was this basic as- surance: that there is a direct and a just correspondence between the laws of the spirit and the laws of the flesh, that religion can and will manifest itself in our earthly activities. The English preoccupation with commercial and es- chatological considerations in Sabbatai's story is restless, even irritable in tone, because there the relationship appears most often as a dilemma to observers, who fear the truth of the maxim "that religion and trade cannot be both at once at the height." The prevailing tone is an indication of how deep the problem lies, but beneath this restlessness there is the powerful impetus to discover a solution to the dilemma. Something of the sort may be seen in one of the tracts on the Jews which appeared early in 1666. It is un- doubtedly significant that this tract is the most legendary of all those 114.

The story is that of the Persian Jews, who learn that the price of following the ambassadors of the Ten Tribes into Jerusalem will be the sacrifice of all their worldly estates to the king of Persia. When the Jews took these Conditions for their departure, very grievously, the Embassadors admonished them, that they should not lay it to heart, or be un- willing to leave those temporals, who should find better things; neither should they lose those Temporals: for these God would reserve for them safe and sound. Thereupon they go forth, following the Embassadors, leaving their Habitations and Estates behind them."6 This is the reward which the history of Sabbatai Sevi and the idea of Jewish messianism held forth to English observers-not so much the best of both worlds as the affirmation that their world was single and inviolate. If social and economic change, by transforming utterly the face of Restoration England, inevitably frustrated the need for affirmation to which it had given rise, there was that much more reason for its continued and passionate in- dulgence. 116.
