Westport, CT: Praeger, 2002. xvi, 272 pp. Israel, and before that the idea of a Jewish state in the traditional homeland, has long captured the imagination of many, if not always most, American Jews. The close connection between Jews in Israel and the United States intensified as the events of the last century unfolded, especially the Holocaust, the struggle for Israel's independence, and then the unending effort to safeguard that independence and ensure security. The 1967 Six-Day War, the run-up to which conjured up im- ages of another calamity, had a profound effect in the Diaspora, driving home the reality of Israel's precarious security and the state's central importance in modern Jewish life. That watershed produced a relatively short-lived period when it seemed that American Jews were united in their support for Israel. But, since 1977, that "sacred unity" has been called into question as sharp divisions have appeared- exacerbated by controversial Israeli government decisions and the pressures of the peace process since 1991. In retrospect, one wonders whether the brief decade from 1967 to 1977 was a unique respite from habitual Jewish disunity and infighting. After all, both be- fore 1948 and during the first nineteen years of the State's existence, American Jews exhibited considerable ambivalence and diversity of opinion. And, since 1977, there have been what Seliktar calls "deep divisions" that weakened what had become an Israel-centered civil religion. By the turn of the century, as control of the Israeli government seemed to be shifting dramatically every few years, the in- tensity of the conflict between supporters of the two main Israeli orientations were more intense than ever. Of course, all these developments did not occur in a vacuum. American Jews were part of a relationship involving the governments of Israel and the United States. In what Seliktar calls a triadic relationship, American Jews acted political- ly to try to influence the policies of the two governments, while each government tried to use American Jews to further its goals vis-a-vis the other government. This process has led to a crisis within American Jewry, whereby the community finds it increasingly difficult to speak with one voice and to confront political realities with a display of unity. Seliktar does reach some important conclusions. One has to do with the way in which American Jews have reacted to the frequently changing signals emanat- ing from Jerusalem since 1977. Given their well-known penchant for liberalism, American Jews have generally been comfortable with Labor-led governments in 412</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews power and considerably less at ease when Likud has been at the helm. This is due in part to the stylistic differences of expression between the two parties but also to substantive differences. For most of the twenty-seven years since 1977, whenever Likud has been in control there have been significant divergences between Israeli policy and American policy, thereby creating tension. The current period, with Ariel Sharon and George W. Bush leading their respective governments, is proba- bly atypical for the extent of policy convergence. But this has not lessened the cognitive dissonance felt by so many American Jews with what Seliktar calls a "lib- eral-universalist" orientation. Nor has it eliminated the gap between them and fel- low Jews with a "nationalist-Orthodox" orientation, which of course parallels the Israeli situation. Seliktar helps us to understand the triadic relationship through a painstaking examination of the entire period since 1948. Much of that is familiar ground, but she provides continuity to the analysis by virtue of her impressive command of the innumerable organizations that have appeared on the American Jewish scene over the decades. Some of them have come and gone, while others have demonstrated staying power. But when viewed in their totality, her point about the lack of unity within the community is evident. However, many of these organizations are elite bodies that lack extensive grassroots memberships. Is it possible that American Jews at the individual level are not as concerned with the details of policy as their organizational leaders? That might have been the case thirty or forty years ago. But now there is public opinion data that indicate that the rank and file of the commu- nity frequently is divided except in a very basic sense (the existence of a secure Is- rael) and that increasing numbers are less involved with Israel than was the case in the past. Ultimately key questions for American Jewry are whether the younger gen- eration will commit to the political struggle on behalf of Israel to the same extent that their parents have and whether they will find the present turf and ideological battles between organizations relevant. One final observation: the value of this worthy effort is seriously diminished by an embarrassing number of spelling, word usage, and factual errors. Even prop- er names are misspelled.
