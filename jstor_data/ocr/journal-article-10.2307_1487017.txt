<plain_text><page sequence="1">Howard Eilberg-Schwartz. The Savage in Judaism: An Anthropology of Israelite Religion and Ancient Judaism. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990. xii, 289 pp. The purpose of this book, as the author states in his preface, is "to col- lapse the distinction between Judaism and savage religions." The title of the book, The Savage in Judaism, indicates that he intends to do this by demon- strating that the "savage" element in Judaism is sufficiently pronounced to make such a distinction unjustified. However, he also emphasizes that the term "savage" is "passe" and "pejorative," that new anthropological insight "has discovered no savages," and that the natives of New Guinea, Australia, and the Congo "are not 'savages' whose cultural and religious practices are inferior to those of the West" (p. 1). The author's position boils down to these propositions: (1) Traditional scholarship postulated a sharp distinction between Judaism and savage religion. (2) That position is "passe," etc. (3) It can be demonstrated that in ancient Judaism there are features or elements similar to (or identical with, or parallel to) those found in the cultures of New Guinea, etc. (A discussion</page><page sequence="2">92 BOOK REVIEWS of these features is the central subject of the book.) (4) Hence you have "the savage in Judaism." I find a serious logical flaw in this series of propositions. If the presence of certain features in the cultures of New Guinea, etc., is not an indication of the savage nature of those cultures, how can similar (or identical, or parallel) features in ancient Judaism indicate the presence of the "savage" in that culture? Leaving aside problems of terminology and logic, what does The Savage in Judaism offer the reader? It begins by reviewing the distinction made until the twentieth century between Judaism and savage religions, emphasizing throughout that such contraposition was based on a pro-Judaism prejudice. Then it discusses a few selected "practices from Israelite religion and ancient Judaism" to show that in them Judaism was "savage." In this part we learn about metaphors in the Bible centering on animals, about circumcision, about menstrual and other impurities, and about contamination. In the brief conclusion, titled "Savaging Judaism," the author claims that what he undertook in his book was "a salvage operation"--"an attempt to salvage the Enlightenment critique of Judaism, which saw no fundamental differ- ences between Judaism and savage religions." At the very beginning of the book the author pays homage to some of the scholars who preceded him in his endeavor to point out similarities between biblical and "primitive" religions. He discussses James G. Frazer and Wil- liam Robertson Smith, whose "works collapsed the longstanding dichotomy between Judaism and savage religions" (p. 11), and says that "apart from Frazer's The Golden Bough and Folklore in the Old Testament there has been no attempt by anthropologists to make Israelite religion or ancient Judaism a serious focus of inquiry until the work of Mary Douglas and Edmund Leach" (p. 17). This statement may or may not be valid if referring only to authors who wrote in English; it is patently erroneous if it refers, as its phrasing indicates, to "biblical interpreters" in general, for it ignores, among others, the "attempt" made by Oskar Daihnhardt in his Natursagen: Eine Sammlung natur-deutender Sagen, Mdrchen, Fabeln und Legenden, vol. 1, Sagen zum Alten Testament (1907), and P. Saintyves in his Essais de Folk- lore Biblique: Magie, Mythes et Miracles dans l'Ancient et de Nouveau Testa- ment (1922)-both certainly as important as Frazer's work. In his eagerness to demonstrate the existence of the "savage" in Judaism the author becomes guilty of occasional arbitrary misrepresentation of bibli- cal narratives. Thus, for instance, he says that the story of the 'aqedah "expresses the idea that God is sometimes willing to accept animals in place</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 93 of human sacrifices" (p. 135). The word "sometimes" implies that at other times God is unwilling to accept animal sacrifices and demands human sacrifices-a view not supported by any biblical passage. Feminists will be happy when reading (on p. 27) that "when a writer struggles to perfect a line or verse, she eventually finds 'just the right word' even though she cannot always say why that word 'works' better than others." One is reminded of the feminist emendation of Gen. 1:27: ". .. male and female created She them." Stylists, on the other hand, will be unhappy when reading phrases such as "the anthropological study of Judaism releases a savage critique of Judaism itself" (p. 28). "Savage" as an adjective can mean uncultured, rugged, fierce, ferocious, untamed, primitive, barbarous, crude, cruel, piti- less, furious, ill-tempered, etc. (thus according to Webster). Which of these meanings does the author have in mind when he characterizes his critique of Judaism as "savage"? Psychologists will be impressed by the powerful ego displayed by the author, as manifested by constant references to himself. On one single page (p. 25), for example, he uses such expressions as "I have attempted," "alert- ed me," "I have tried," "I move beyond," "my thinking," "my reading," "my quest," and so on, no less than eighteen times. Despite the above strictures, The Savage in Judaism makes interesting reading. It is a testimony to the degree to which biblical interpretation in general, and specific biblical passages in particular, after having given rise to a library-full of studies, still have the power to agitate the mind and imagi- nation of a modern anthropologist.
