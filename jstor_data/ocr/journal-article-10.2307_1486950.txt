<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dorothy Sly. Philo's Perception of Women. Brown Judaic Studies 209. Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1990. vii, 258 pp. Though, as its title informs us, this is a book on Philo's perception of women, its method serves to elucidate some important aspects of how Philo should be read. It is conceptually well thought out, excellently organized, and presented with a developed sensitivity for the subtleties of Philo's thought. The major part of the book is devoted to Philo's description of the female figures of the Bible in terms of two states, woman (gyne) and virgin (parthenos). "Womanhood" in Philo's writings is found to be "a state or condition of life marked by menstruation, marital relations, and childbear- ing, which symbolize evil, defilement and corruption. Virginity is the absence of these signs of womanhood. It is a state of elevation beyond the physical constraints of womanhood and, as well, beyond the moral states they symbolize" (pp. 216-217). Various facets of this conceptualization are carefully studied, beginning with Eve, the archetypical woman. In accord</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 289 with Philo's concept of justice as a cosmic principle decreeing the rule of the superior and the submission of the inferior, Eve is seen in a positive light as long as she is under firm masculine control. Philo's treatment of the other female figures of the Bible is similarly ana- lyzed. In addition to the major dichotomy of woman and virgin, which is reflected in no less than six chapter headings, the category woman is further subdivided, in chapter 10, into ladies (astai) and harlots (pornai). The former represent those "who work within the social framework established by men" (p. 217), while as for the latter, "man must choose between fight and flight" (ibid.). At the same time, according to Philo's conceptualization, "the great women of Scripture were not really women but virgins" (p. 218). In the penultimate chapter Sly notes that Philo's perception of contem- porary women is a repetition of the themes already treated-and here too womankind is divided between ladies and harlots, the latter category includ- ing anyone who does not live a life of virtual seclusion, devoted to home, husband, and children. Respecting this chapter, I have several reservations. I am less than convinced that apologetic was a major factor in Philo's atti- tude toward contemporary women. Sly's previous argumentation is a suffi- cient, and, to me at least, a more satisfactory explanation. Also, since Judaism in Philo's day had a mass of traditional customs and traditions- the raw material from which the rabbinic sources grew-one is clearly not justified in comparing Philo with the Bible and concluding that any devia- tion therefrom was original with him. Prior to drawing such a conclusion one must first monitor the rabbinic sources. I will confine myself to a single example of what I am referring to, which, though not serious, is misleading in that it fathers innovations on Philo which are hardly legitimately his own. Sly states that Philo's addition of the phrase "men and women alike" to the description of the convening of the people at Sinai-which she claims was "for men only" in the Bible (or at the most that the women's presence was not acknowledged)--"is indicative of a desire to portray Judaism as relevant to the age" (p. 189). Rabbinic midrash takes it for granted that women were part of the assembly at Mount Sinai; see Mekhilta, Yitro 2, and in greater detail Shemot Rabba 28:2 to Exodus 19:3, which is taken to refer to the preparations for the Sinai revelation: "This is what you are to say to the house of Jacob (and what you are to tell the people of Israel)" (Exodus 19:3). .... Why first to the women ["house" is a rabbinic euphemism for "wife"]? ... God said, "When I created the world I commanded Adam only, and afterwards Eve was commanded, and she went</page><page sequence="3">290 BOOK REVIEWS and ruined the world; now if I do not address the women first they will bring the Torah to naught." Though Shemot Rabba is much later, it is a compilation of earlier sources which themselves have a long history, while the Mekhilta is a tannaitic mid- rash compiled not so much later than Philo. Hence Philo was clearly in tra- ditionally good Jewish company, and probably merely reflecting the con- temporary understanding of the biblical text. Even when the rabbinic sources also reflect Hellenistic patterns, their notice is no less important, for only thus can we locate this or that facet of "Philonic Judaism" within or outside the traditional contemporary "consensus." To return: a special chapter at the beginning of Sly's book is devoted to background material, with a justified stress on the relevant Greek, partic- ularly philosophic, sources, which are also brought en passant; for a partic- ularly felicitous example, see pp. 101-102, where Timaeus 69e-70a, 77b and Quaest. Gen. IV 15 are juxtaposed(parallel rabbinic material is totally absent). The book also contains some interesting topics not directly related to women which are brought as necessary preliminaries to the main discus- sion. A particularly fine example of this is the short r6sum6 on pp. 132 ff. of the differing scholarly views on the significance of Philo's use of mystery lan- guage, which introduces the seminal passage de Cher. 42-48. Summing up, Sly writes that "a basic conception of the proper relation- ship of the sexes forms the substratum to all Philo's remarks pertaining to male-female distinctions. The key term is 'control"' (p. 219). While Sly accepts the major premises of Richard Baer's Philo's Use of the Categories Male and Female, (a) that Philo designates the lower, carnal part as female and the higher, spiritual part as male, (b) that virgin and male are, on the soteriological level, equivalent, and (c) that Philo uses sexual language on the cosmic level to depict interactions between forces which are strong, superior, and active, and others which are weak, inferior, and passive (p. 219), she disagrees with his conclusion that Philo advocated complete sever- ance of the soul (the male or virgin) from the concerns of the body (the female), thereby resolving what on Baer's terms was conflict between Philo and the Jewish perception of the physical creation as good (see Gen. 1:31). She argues that "Philo's calls for quitting the body are rhetorical, and that the theme of his work is control of the lower elements rather than separation or elimination," since Philo explicitly states that "the words, 'Depart out of these' are not equivalent to 'Sever thyself from them absolutely,' since to issue such a command as that would be to prescribe death (Migr. 7-8)" (pp. 219-220, emphasis added).</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 291 Sly concludes that "on the individual, social or even cosmic level, the feminine, when it is harnessed, loses its danger, and enhances the mascu- line. .... Philo envisioned reality as a hierarchy in which the interaction of the successively higher elements could be expressed in sexual terms.... Jewish and Greek traditions converged on this point" (p. 221). Then return- ing at the very end to Philo's attitude to human women, she finds it to have been "Philo's conviction that woman's need is to be controlled by man and her function is to serve his ends. . . . He simply did not raise the question of her spiritual growth. Hers was to be a derivative solution. The spiritual accountability he urged upon men had no counterpart in the women's quarters" (p. 223). The considered argument which leads to these conclusions is what the book is all about. It is worth reading. Naomi G. Cohen Haifa University Haifa, Israel</page></plain_text>
