Albany: SUNY Press, 1999. viii, 379 pp. The challenge of writing a book on Kabbalah for the educated reader is to communicate the range of Kabbalistic experience, belief, and teaching without ob- scuring the subject or diluting its meaning. This book accomplishes that task with thoroughness and lucidity. The author draws upon a rich array of sources and pre- sents a thorough panorama of Kabbalistic teachings in a clear and readable style despite the fact that it is a translation from Hebrew. Although it is intended as an introductory text written for the educated pub- lic, the book is not an introduction geared for undergraduates or for a lay reader. It is densely packed and presupposes fluency in Jewish studies. It is, however, a valuable book that can be recommended to advanced undergraduates or for student research assignments. The book is a helpful and concise alternative to the interpre- tive sections of Isaiah Tishby's Mishnat Ha-Zohar. The author writes a readable synopsis of the basic teachings of the Kabbalah and draws on a wide historical ar- ray of sources. It has advantages over other introductions to the Kabbalah: It is comprehensive and includes references to the most recent scholarly research. While it does not break new ground in research on Kabbalah, it accurately reflects the state of the field. The first part of the book focuses on the experience of the Kabbalist. Hal- lamish defines Jewish mysticism as the encounter with the divine presence, the deeper sense of being close to God. He explains that the more intense the effort to get to know God, the nearer one gets to the mystical level. The author, however, adds that Kabbalah is not otherworldly transcendentalism. He captures the heart of the Kabbalistic experience succinctly: "Here, then, is the secret of the Kabbalah's pow- er: Man ascends to God, and thereby gains strength. He gains strength-not in or- der to stand equal to God but in realizing himself as a human being." The author presents the conflicting tendencies within Kabbalah alternately to conceal mystical teachings and to circulate them. He explains how Kabbalah preserved religious conformity and fostered innovation at the same time. He ex- plores the moral and intellectual qualifications of a Kabbalist and the conditions, cri- teria, and restrictions that have historically limited access to the Kabbalah. He traces the meaning of the prohibition on teaching the esoteric subject matter of Ma 'aseh Bereshit and Ma 'aseh Merkabah through Mishnah, Heikhalot literature, and 140</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Kabbalah. He also stresses the Kabbalistic expectation that a student has been grounded in modes of rational thinking and discourse before turning to Kabbalah. The chapters on the preparations for the mystic ascent and techniques for achiev- ing mystic revelation are among the best explanations available in English. De- spite the author's focus on the experience of Kabbalah, he does not embrace Moshe Idel's evaluation of the ecstatic dimension in Kabbalah. The second part of the book-on the basic Kabbalistic concepts-does not break new ground. It does, however, present a broad array of sources that are not otherwise available in English. He lets the sources speak in their own words. For the most part, he presupposes that the reader of the book is literate in Jewish con- cepts, sources, and history. Occasionally, he will make a scholarly aside or refer- ence. My major criticism of this study is that it often treats Kabbalah as a consis- tent movement with common patterns of life and values. He speaks of Heikhalot, Zohar, and Hasidism in the same breath and presents Kabbalah as one unified tra- dition. Can one draw conclusions from Nachman of Braslav's teachings on hit- bodedut about Kabbalah's approach to solitude in general? Two different translators rendered the original Hebrew text into English. The translation is generally accurate but there are occasional inconsistent trans- literations (e.g., simssum, sedek) and weak copyediting (e.g., Neoplatonians, Neo- platonists). Sometimes the author presents the material and lets it speak for itself. At oth- er times he presents and analyzes the material from other perspectives, as when he describes Yosef Karo's maggid or heavenly messenger as the human un- conscious or superego. Sometimes he raises major topics but then does not devel- op them, such as the Kabbalistic view of human sexuality in relation to the an- drogyny of the Sefirot or Kabbalistic messianism. At other times, he introduces but does not elaborate interesting themes such as the use of chant, divine names, and dreams. These are small omissions in an otherwise thorough and important contribution to the literature on Kabbalah in English. David S.
