<plain_text><page sequence="1">Alex Weingrod. The Saint of Beersheba. SUNY Series in Israeli Studies. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1990. viii, 147 pp. One of the most striking features of North African Jewish and Muslim popular religiosity is hagiolatry, or the veneration of holy men. Much has been written on Muslim saint cults, and there is a growing literature on the Jewish phenomenon in English, French, and Hebrew. Alex Weingrod's new book is an important addition to this literature. The book deals with the veneration of a Jewish saint (zaddiq) practiced by North African Jews in Israel. This is not a transplanted cult, such as those organized for holy men buried in North Africa (e.g., David ou Moshe, who has several shrines in Israel), but rather one that developed in the new country around the tomb of a local saint, Rabbi Chaim Chouri (Hayyim Khtri), who has come to be known as "the Saint of Beersheba." Weingrod, an anthropologist, based his book upon field observations over several years at the annual pilgrimage held at the hillula (lit., "wedding celebration," but in North African usage the saint's death day, i.e., the day he becomes wedded to the Divine). Chapter 1, "Zaddik" (pp. 1-22), relates how this man from the island of Jerba off the coast of southern Tunisia came to be regarded as a saint. A well-known religious scholar in Tunisia, Rabbi Chouri emigrated to Israel in 1955 and died there two years later at the age of seventy-two. It was only after his death that tales of his miracles began to be told, and there developed an entire hagiography surrounding the man and his life. Weingrod recounts how Rabbi Chouri's son and son-in-law planned his hillula as a family observance, and how very quickly it grew spontaneously out of</page><page sequence="2">314 BOOK REVIEWS the family circle into a full-blown pilgrimage attracting 20,000 to 25,000 participants each spring. Chapter 2, "Text" (pp. 23-46), documents and interprets Rabbi Chouri's hillula as cultural text. Weingrod attempts to answer such questions as: What activities and behaviors take place during this pilgrimage? Who takes part in the festivities? Why do the celebrants come, and what brings them to the cemetery? Nearly all who come to the cemetery are either Tunisian or Moroccan. The discussion regarding the ratio of female and male, ages, and occupations is particularly interesting. Clearly the celebrants belong to the lower and lower-middle ranges of Israeli society. Weingrod also explains the reasons for this popular outpouring to pray for the rabbi's guidance, intervention, and healing power, and to obtain blessings from the rabbi's sons, who claim no charismatic powers themselves (although the passing of such powers from father to son is well attested in this tradition, as, for example, in the case of Baba Sale and Baba Barukh), but merely recite blessings in the sacred presence of their father's grave. Weingrod rightly observes that pilgrims come not only for healing and to enhance their moral and spiritual qualities. They come for powerful social reasons as well. A hillula, after all, is a joyful celebration and a place where the celebrants can fully express themselves in a Maghrebi Jewish cultural context. Having dealt with the hillula of Rabbi Chaim Chouri as "Text," Weingrod then turns to it in chapter 3 (pp. 47-68) as "Performance." The performance unfolds in three acts that flow one into the other. The first act comprises the celebration at the Chouri Synagogue on the Sabbath preceding the hillula. The second act takes place on the day of the pilgrimage at the cemetery. The final act is the secuda, or communal meal. There is a discussion of the spontaneous activities: "prayer, visits, picnics, ululating, gossiping, singing, lighting candles, sharing food, and for a few, dancing" (p. 55). The "center stage" is the main sacred space, where at first glance the action appears chaotic, as the separation between the sexes breaks down almost entirely. Men and women, who are supposed to stand on opposite sides, all cluster around the rabbi's grave; though the men try to control the women's actions, the latter simply ignore them. This is a happy occasion for some, reaching to a pitch of ecstasy, while it records many moments of liminality and accord. Several processes and two themes are offered in chapter 4, "Process" (pp. 69-91), centering around the historical, textual, and contextual. The author</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 315 demonstrates how the pilgrimage is closely connected with cultural processes taking place within contemporary Israeli society, which has adopted ethnic pluralism in place of the earlier mizzug galuyyot, or melting-pot policy. The resurgence of hillulot and other public rituals specific to particular Oriental Jewish communities that have settled in Israel, such as the Mimouna of the North Africans and the Sahrani of the Kurds, is a statement of the newfound ethnic power and pride of these communities and ultimately a rejection of the institutional Ashkenazism of Israeli society. The pilgrims at the hillula affirm and rekindle their ethnic identity not only through their participation, but by the wearing of ethnic dress for such rituals and celebrations. The comparisons between Israel and other cultures in chapter 5, "Com- parison" (pp. 93-111), are valuable to general anthropologists and students of religion, although for North Africanists a comparison to native Tunisian or Moroccan saints and culture, which are more closely related than those of West Indians in London, would have been welcome. Weingrod does discuss the Near Eastern Muslim wdlf and Maghrebi Muslim marabout (pp. 13-14), but only very briefly. The book is beautifully enhanced by twenty-one photographs depicting various scenes at the pilgrimage. The astute observer will notice a wealth of fascinating details that graphically illustrate and in some cases supplement the text (e.g., women wearing pants and middle-aged women without headcoverings). The study amply answers the questions it raised. It also pursues certain themes consistently, such as the process by which a new saint and shrine literally have been created, after which the author conceptualizes and interprets this set of events within the social, cultural, and political contexts of contemporary Israeli society (see p. 2). Weingrod succeeds in demonstrating how the hillulot have a tight religious and symbolic structure. His research is a significant addition to the general anthropological literature on pilgrimage and ritual pioneered by Victor W. Turner and others. It is also an important addition to the growing body of literature dealing specifically with North African Jewish hagiolatry and with cultural expressions within Israel. Yedida K.
