<plain_text><page sequence="1">JEWS, REGALIAN RIGHTS, AND THE CONSTITUTION IN MEDIEVAL FRANCE by WILLIAM CHESTER JORDAN It is fashionable to imagine a great dichotomy between the feudal monar- chies in the West and the brittle, particularistic entity of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation.' To Voltaire's mean-spirited gibe that the latter was neither holy, Roman, nor an Empire might be added that it was also not really German, since millions of Netherlanders, Italians, and Slavs, as well as Provengals and Savoyards, lived within its territorial limits. France and England, the stereotype goes, had achieved a precocious unity, at least in the thirteenth century. Nothing could be clearer, one might conclude, than the contrast between the great kingdoms of the West and the so-called Empire. The fashionable cliche even affects our understanding of Jewish life in the Middle Ages. Fritz Backhaus put the commonplace this way: "The territorial division (Zersplitterung) of Germany prevented a comprehensive expulsion [of the Jews] as could be carried out in England, France, and Spain."2 This neat dichotomy is inadequate. At best it makes sense in a comparison between England and Germany. Only in England, a few exceptions aside, were the claims of a paramount lord, the king, to the control and exploitation of the Jews more or less uncontested by other secular authorities or by ecclesiastics 1. A very early version of this paper was presented at the Twenty-fourth Annual Conference of the Association for Jewish Studies (December 14, 1992) under the title, "The Supremacy of the Crown and the Public Good: The Expulsion of the Jews from France (1306) as an Episode in Constitutional History." At the kind invitation of Professor John Moore, I gave a lecture at Hofstra University, October 26, 1994, based on a revised version of that paper. 2.

The very simplicity of the English situation arose out of its specialness, indeed its uniqueness.3 A virtual royal monopoly of political authority over Jews accompanied the first immigration of Jews to England, presumably under princely sponsorship, in the wake of the Norman Conquest. There were no Jews in England before 1066. It may very well be the case that in the twelfth century--the first century of their settlement--there was a handful of minor jurisdictions that claimed dominium over Jews in England. Usually translated "lordship," dominium might be better rendered "ownership" when applied to a lord's authority over Jews. Such claims in England by any lord other than the king were ephemeral at best. Insofar as any other lord ever claimed dominium over Jews in England, it was because of a special grant from the king, a "boon"--or free gift--bestowed by the crown. Consequently, when the crown decided to end the experiment of Jewish settlement in England in 1290, it merely expelled all Jews. It did not have to negotiate, cajole, or seek the permission of anyone else to do so. The Jews in medieval England, in legal, indeed in constitutional terms, were the king's Jews. Nothing could have been more different than the situation in France.4 Within the area of Europe now called France, at least fifty barons claimed dominium over the Jews in their fiefs. And this authority extended even to the power to expel them from their lands without permission from anyone else. Indeed, Jews were expelled by French baronial authorities a dozen or more times in the Middle Ages. In 1182 the crown in the person of Philip Augustus did so in what might be called baronial fashion, that is, solely from its own directly governed fiefs, the so-called royal domain, whose extent was far smaller than that of many other baronies over which it claimed, but exercised very little, suzerain lordship. In the 1190s a number of minor French lords who claimed dominium over Jews expelled their Jews. The thirteenth century saw a continuing series of expulsions by numerous feudal lords: Brittany, 1240; Gascony, 1287-88; Anjou and Maine, 1289; Niort, 1291; Nevers, 1294. Zersplitterung, to put it another way, does not seem to have been limited to the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. 3. The best survey of the English situation, from which the information to be summarized comes, is H. G. Richardson's English Jewry under the Angevin Kings (London, 1960). A new synthesis, by Robert Stacey, is on the horizon. 4. The summary of the situation in France is abstracted from my French Monarchy and the Jews from Philip Augustus to the Last Capetians (Philadelphia, 1989).</page><page sequence="3">JEWS, REGALIAN RIGHTS, AND THE CONSTITUTION 3 I have argued elsewhere that the very multiplicity ofjurisdictions in France was a positive factor for the politically savvy Jewish leadership, which could sometimes, if not always, play one lord off against another in times of crisis.5 There was also tension between the dispersal of power that such a multiplicity of lordships implied and the emerging ideology and practice of an increasingly authoritarian state in thirteenth-century France. In brief the argument is the following. To begin with, Jews were a particularly appropriate group about whose relation to the crown especially strong theoretical claims of the supremacy of the crown might be made. There were other groups, like serfs, on which equally strong claims might be staked; and there were issues, such as minting rights (rights of striking money and authorizing the coinage), on which spokesmen for the crown were also willing to make especially powerful claims about its authority. All of these claims were expressed in ideologically charged language about "regalian rights" and the "common good." We can learn a great deal by considering all three of these matters comparatively rather than in isolation as they have ordinarily been treated in the past. The particular nature of the claims made about the crown's authority with regard to Jews, to serfs, and to rights of coinage evolved considerably in the thirteenth century, becoming more and more comprehensive. The mounting extremeness of these claims and the governmental actions that flowed from them, especially with regard to the coinage, provoked an aristocratic reaction at the end of the thirteenth century. Indeed, by 1305 the reaction became so serious that the crown seemed to reduce its claims-on the issue at least of the coinage. The necessity of doing so was humiliating. In retaliation, however, and in order to refurbish its tarnished image, the crown deliberately repeated its comprehensive claims to paramountcy. It chose to do so by a draconian policy toward the Jews, an expulsion, but an expulsion of a most radical type, one that extended to all Jews, not just royal Jews, and not just from the royal domain but throughout France. One could add that the crown's authoritarian streak in this regard would manifest itself only a few months after the expulsion of the Jews by the equally extreme claims to paramountcy that underlay the attack on and ultimate suppression of the Order of Knights Templar. These two gestures were successful in that the king and those close to him regained confidence in their own ideology. 5. In a paper presented at Cornell University, November 4, 1990, entitled, "Jews in Medieval England and France: The Jurisdictional Contrast."</page><page sequence="4">4 WILLIAM CHESTER JORDAN The confidence won in this successful assertion of supremacy in the matter of the Jews and the Templars proved illusory. The crown would later again arbitrarily manipulate the coinage, as if there were no constraints on its authority. It discovered, however, and to its chagrin, that the aristocracy was still unprepared to accept the crown's view of the comprehensiveness of royal authority. The aristocratic reaction then worsened, indeed became rebellion in 1314; and a strategic partial retreat was once more in order. Only one of many proofs of this-but a proof directly relevant to the argument of this essay-is the way, in 1315, the crown decided to deal with Jews and serfs, the groups over which it had made equally extreme claims of supremacy in the thirteenth century. Jews, Serfs, and Coinage What was there about Jews, serfs, and the right to mint coins that suggested to thinkers by the thirteenth century that their relation to the crown was special? First, with regard to Jews, ideas that had circulated since the time of the Roman Empire and which were articulated, as well, in the Carolingian period maintained that royal or Imperial authority enjoyed a monopoly of punitive power over Jews. This was probably a commonplace by 1200, certainly in Imperial circles. As Jean-Luc Fray has put it, "The protection of Jews is a regalian right which the emperor concedes to his great vassals.... The exercise of this guardianship is a sovereign right and cannot be impeded by subaltern officers."6 Such privileges as were exercised over Jews by the vassals of the emperor were granted in terms that made this plain. We have instruments of concession or confirmation that show this to be the case in Luxembourg and throughout the Rhineland.7 Although French juristic writers of a royalist bent and Romanist training shared the ideology, they still had not fully worked out its implications in the early thirteenth century. The question of serfs is perhaps more complex.8 We can get at it by considering the passage from one status (unfreedom) to another (freedom). If 6.

I am not concerned here with the juridical analogy made at the time between Jews and serfs (judei tanquam servi, judei servi camere sunt, etc.), on which see Jordan, French Monarchy, pp. 133, 243-244.

Shulamith Shahar, "Some Observations on the Use of the Term Servi in Relation to the Jews of France" (in Hebrew), Michael 12 (1991).</page><page sequence="5">JEWS, REGALIAN RIGHTS, AND THE CONSTITUTION 5 serfdom was merely a relationship between two parties (free lord and unfree serf), then the decision of the parties to change that relationship should have concerned no one else but them. Nonetheless, as Maitland was aware, ideas about serfdom went back to ideas about chattel slavery; the sanctioning ability to change the status of a chattel slave (a thing), to make it come alive as a human being, ultimately went back to public power: "To turn a thing into a person," Maitland wrote, "is a feat that can not be performed without the aid of the state."g But, as the quotation continues, underlining the practical difference between slavery and serfdom, "to make free as against yourself one who is already free as against all but you, this you can easily do, for it is hardly a matter of public law." Nonetheless, from the older idea there survived vague notions of the preeminent interest of the prince in determining matters of status. Again, the precise implications of these notions were still being worked out in France in the High and late Middle Ages.' On the question of coinage, the evidence is less vague. Charlemagne himself, whose acts, preserved in formula books, provided a model and goal for feudal princes, had made the argument that coinage was a regalian right. And he came close to enforcing it, decreeing a royal monopoly in 805. Others who minted coins did so because the emperor bestowed the privilege on them (Ganshof called these "exceptional cases"); what the emperor bestowed he could revoke." In fact, over time more and more princes acquired the power to strike coins. The question was, Under what conditions and with what justifications could such powers be revoked? These, too, were issues still contested at the beginning of the thirteenth century in France. Claims to Paramountcy in the Thirteenth Century The thirteenth century saw the articulation of a radical set of notions about royal power with respect to Jews, serfs, and coinage. The key step affecting Jews took place in 1230, with the Ordinance of Melun, in which 9.

Janet Sondheimer (Ithaca, N.Y., 1971), p. 97.</page><page sequence="6">6 WILLIAM CHESTER JORDAN the crown argued its supremacy by asserting its regalian right to prohibit Jews from migrating from one dominium to another.12 Before 1230, at least back to 1198 and possibly before, what had happened was the following. Every time it became clear that a lord who claimed dominium over Jews wanted to tax his Jews heavily or "take" them (impose a captio, as it is called in the unapologetic language of the contemporary documents), Jews themselves made calculated decisions and sometimes chose to migrate to other jurisdictions. Many lords received them or tolerated their presence because of gifts from the immigrants. These gifts (or bribes), though large, were far less damaging to the wealth of the immigrants than a ruthless taking of their property would have been. The way for a lord planning a great taking of his Jews to avoid this problem was for him to negotiate non-retention treaties,13 agreements that in substance said, "I, a lord, am going to take my Jews. Undoubtedly some or all of them will try to run away; you, neighboring lords, promise not to accept them into your domains." Ideally each lordship became a prison house from which there was no escape. And we possess numerous examples and references to agreements of this kind from 1198 to 1230.14 The problems were threefold. Lords tended to make temporary agreements rather than permanent ones, or, at least, to act as if the treaties were temporary. Second, many lords-for whatever reason-did not join in such agreements or antagonized other lords by making their price for joining too high. Finally, the failure of any single border lord to ratify a non-retention treaty undermined the whole effort. One way out--one escape route-was all that was needed for people who felt oppressed or who suspected the coming of a captio. In May 1210 the crown of France very effectively negotiated a whole series of non-retention treaties. And then it proceeded to mulct the Jews in the royal domain in a most effective captio.'5 But the crown was not always so fortunate in getting other lords to agree not to accept its Jews into their fiefs. The reluctance, for example, of the Count Palatine of Champagne 12. Layettes du Tresor des chartes, ed. Alexandre Teulet et al., 5 vols. (Paris, 1863-1909), II, no. 2083.

Jordan, French Monarchy, pp. 66-70.</page><page sequence="7">JEWS, REGALIAN RIGHTS, AND THE CONSTITUTION 7 from 1223 on to readily enter these agreements with the crown made the procedure-already time-consuming and costly--ever less effective. In 1223 the crown asserted that it had a right by fiat to compel all barons to obey a non-retention policy (an assertion that obviously derived its intellectual justification from the ideas about regalian rights discussed earlier), but the crown did not press the point. The Count Palatine of Champagne refused even to put his seal to a document that made such an assertion. And the crown, too uncertain to order the count to obey anyway, finally agreed to negotiate a separate instrument with the lord of Champagne which seemed to suggest that all its lofty assertions of authority made a dead letter.16 By 1230, however, when the Count Palatine was in a desperate struggle with a group of barons and needed the support of the crown, he made no further objection to the crown's assertion of its paramount right to impose non-retention on all barons by fiat. The crown, seizing the moment, did more: it resurrected the older Carolingian notions of its authority. It could not only decree a policy. It seemed to suggest that on the matter of Jews it could do more. Some authority had to exist to adjudicate disputes over any alleged violations of the non-retention policy. The crown asserted that it-and it alone-would provide the forum for the resolution of such disputes. This was implicitly an argument from the need to assure the common good. Moreover, the Ordinance of Melun, which, as noted, expressed these views, declared that whoever held and acted on a contrary opinion was to be regarded as a rebel and might be treated as such. The Ordinance of Melun, though it has never been evaluated this way before, was in reality not just the first piece of legislation in France since the time of the Carolingians (a fact which has long been recognized), it was specifically the first piece of treason legislation in French history.17 By defining refusal to accept the crown's instructions on non-retention of fugitive Jews or its judgment in a reserved case as a breach of faith tantamount to rebellion, the legislation effectively expanded archaic, feudal notions of disloyalty--direct betrayal of the king or personal harm to his dignity (such as sleeping with his wife)-into a much more conceptual or modem doctrine. 16. For a full discussion of all the issues surrounding the ordinances and negotiations of 1223, see ibid., pp. 93-104. 17. This does not mean that the status that the Ordinance of Melun defines for the Jews was as radical a departure as the constitutional aspects of the Ordinance; cf. Gilbert Dahan, Les Intellectuels chretiens et lesjuifs au moyen dcge (Paris, 1990), p. 67.</page><page sequence="8">8 WILLIAM CHESTER JORDAN The crown was making the same assertion with regard to arguments over runaway serfs and manumission of serfs. Lords who had disputes over fugitive serfs had to have them adjudicated in royal courts, regardless of whether they were immediate vassals of the king. And lords needed, it began to be said in the thirteenth century, and it became the predominant view by the end of the reign of Saint Louis, the confirmation of the crown in order to emancipate serfs. To some degree, then, determinations of personal status--questions of freedom and ownership of human beings-were also being articulated as regalian rights. Disputes over runaway Jews and runaway serfs were cas royaux, "royal cases." The so-called Etablissements de saint Louis, a compilation of statutes from around 1270, puts it this way, "No vassal or noble can free his serf in any manner [i.e., even without full manumission, elevate his legal status] without the assent of his lord and paramount lord, according to the usage of the lay court."'" Slightly later, the famous treatise by Philippe de Beaumanoir, written for a vassal of the French king, showed that this view appears to have been accepted, however reluctantly, by the nobility. One can sense the reluctance in the quotations. For those trying to be freed from their servitude it is a good thing to have their freedom confirmed by the sovereign from whom their lord holds. .... By the present custom, serfs, male or female, may procure their freedom and that of their children, if they can obtain it from their lord and by the authority of his sovereign.19 The doctrine of the king's sovereign right over the coinage was also sharpened and, ultimately, expressed fully in the mid-thirteenth century. The old argument was restated, namely, that even though many lords (more than twenty-five) had coinage rights in France, they all held them on sufferance from the crown. The wide distribution of such rights, it was said, in no way undermined or constrained the crown's right to manage the coinage in the 18 . Les Etablissements de saint Louis, ed. Paul Viollet, 4 vols.

This view lay behind Saint Louis's willingness in the 1250s and 1260s to design a new royal coinage that would run throughout the kingdom. It lay behind his decision to mint in gold (and to restrict minting in gold to the crown), to limit the circulation of baronial coinages to the baronies in which they were struck, to establish exchange rates among all baronial coinages (including the sterling that circulated in Gascony), and to do so by fiat; and, finally, it lay behind the saint-king's willingness to revoke baronial coinage rights where the quality and soundness of the coins struck were inferior. Coinage was a regalian right (even though devolved), and the king could exercise the right even over against the privileges of other barons for the common good.20 These assertions caused so much consternation that they were debated by the university faculty at Paris.21 At least one baronial chronicler was unmitigated in his condemnation; these assertions in his view led not to the legitimate recovery of devolved rights but to simple acts of usurpation.22 The Manipulation of the Coinage and the Aristocratic Reaction One could concentrate on other issues, of course, because the devel- opments being described are expressions of something like the hubris that began to affect many aspects of French royal policies in the later thirteenth century. Whatever one may say about Saint Louis's pretensions as a king, however-and they were certainly overarching and authoritarian-every claim he made to paramount lordship was still circumscribed by a profound sense of his own fallibility, indeed sinfulness, his deep respect for customs that were not in clear violation of morality, and his absolute acceptance of the spiritual lordship of the papacy. Yet, and this is not surprising, his legacy--the power of his image as a king-informed the aspirations of his successors, especially his grandson, Philip the Fair. 20.

It was expressed in different ways. It indulged in a willful and successful attempt to tax the clergy in the 1290s "for the defense of the realm," although the clergy was immune from taxation without its own prior consent.23 It found expression, too, in the arbitrary arrest of a bishop in 1301 for so-called treasonous words (he called the king, Philip the Fair, an owl, handsome but stupid, and vented his dislike of the domination of southern Frenchmen by northerners). The seizure took place despite every bishop's immunity in France from arrest and incarceration in a secular prison. Finally, the court's attitude also found expression in a defiant posture toward the pope over just these matters, while at the same time mouthing platitudes about loyalty to the papacy.24 Philip the Fair, according to recent revisionist readings, was a "flexible," "pragmatic" man with a "tenderer" conscience than Saint Louis's.25 This is not the received view, nor does the revision convince me. One could, of course, look at the history of these events in a wider context of Western European state-building, in which case the unique malevolence traditionally imputed to some of Philip's policies seems less spectacular. On June 17, 1308, to provide one illustration, King Haakon V of Norway peremptorily abolished the upper ranks of the nobility in his kingdom whose privileges he deemed excessive.26 He declared it an act of treason should any regency council in his absence appoint men to these ranks, and he seized all fiefs of the nobility into his hands, only to regrant them under new and, he felt, more appropriate conditions of tenure. Did he have the power to do so? For over six hundred years chroniclers---royalist and baronial-and historians have debated the proposition. But of one thing there can be no doubt, his assertion of authority was clearly an attempt to emphasize the regalian origin 23. See now Jeffrey Denton, Philip the Fair and the Ecclesiastical Assemblies of 1294-1295, Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 81 (Philadelphia, 1991). 24. The best discussion of these incidents and their profound political implications may be found in Joseph Strayer, The Reign of Philip the Fair (Princeton, 1980), pp. 260-279. 25.

If there is, then, at many levels a far bigger and more complex story here than one merely about Jews, serfs, and coinage in France, nevertheless, the choice of these three matters in the French case seems reasonable because the outcomes in the execution of the crown's claims differed so much. These differences came about despite the extreme similarity of the jurisdictional claims the crown was making about Jews, serfs, and rights of coinage. Examining the differences will lay bare the tension between the official assertions about the French medieval constitution and the realities of the exercise of political power in France. This will give substance to the easy assertion that all political ideas were contested in the Middle Ages--which is true but banal. When and why, then, do the stories begin to diverge? When and why do the histories of these claims about regalian rights over Jews, serfs, and coinage begin to differ? The critical period opens in the 1290s. Let us begin with coinage. It has long been agreed that King Philip the Fair's manipulation of the coinage in the 1290s (triple revaluation to the crown's credit; i.e., saying that each coin automatically had three times its customary value)-had a very unhappy effect on many important groups, especially creditors.27 To be sure, the hyperinflation that resulted from it did stimulate economic growth at a time when, as Guy Bois has pointed out, stagnation (or blocage) had become characteristic of the economy.28 When the inflation caught up with government spending, so that it was no longer in the government's interest to keep the coinage weak (as administrators called it), and when strong aristocratic criticisms were heard, the crown revalued downward. This antagonized other groups--debtors and petty consumers. But the devaluation in 1305 back to pre-manipulation levels was equally deleterious to the economy as a whole, putting breaks on the real if uneven growth since the late 1290s. The anger of the aristocracy over the manipulation of the coinage in the first phase, the calls for a return to the good coinage of Saint Louis, Philip's grandfather, and the sense of betrayal of the saint's memory imputed to the king by the creation of such bad money left a terrible impression 27. For a lucid summary of the points made in this paragraph, see Strayer, Reign ofPhilip the Fair, pp. 394-396. 28.

Beyond this, his retreat from his policy was more than a little coerced, as aristocratic factions urged defiance of the crown. But, of course, in the 1290s Philip the Fair was merely invoking the same view of the paramountcy of the crown in the matter of coinage to effect his revaluations that his grandfather could have invoked; Philip would have argued that he did what he did only over a matter where he could legitimately do so, that is, where he had a regalian right to do so. Moreover, he would have argued that he acted in the best, indeed necessary, interest of the political nation, for the additional purchasing power the crown achieved by revaluation helped prosecute the wars--in Gascony and Flanders-in which France found itself involved. Thus, the aristocratic and popular reaction to his exercise of regalian right in necessity and for the general welfare, given the confidence of such expressions of royal supremacy before, was beyond his understanding and, ultimately, drove him to retreat: widespread unrest-for a time the king went into hiding--made him, in Joseph Strayer's words, "very cautious after this experience."29 The Reassertion of Paramountcy: The Expulsion of the Jews and the Attack on the Templars The humiliation of 1305, however, had to be undone. The king's caution over the coinage issue was balanced, now, by an almost visceral need to reaffirm the royal supremacy. Philip the Fair could have made all sorts of gestures. What he chose to do is revealing. He chose to humiliate the Jews.30 He might have done so and earned some praise from ecclesiastics, nobles, and the popular classes in any number of ways. But what he did do-expel all royal Jews and all Jews under the dominium of other lords, by fiat-was radically different from anything any French king had ever done before. Why did he make this assertion of paramountcy? It is not enough to say that he got more money doing this than he would have got in even a very ruthless taking that did not involve expelling other barons' Jews, for he was wise enough to let the nobles affected have the property of their expelled Jews. Rather, the expulsion of the Jews of the royal domain--along with all baronial Jews-allowed the king to reassert, in the immediate aftermath of 29. Strayer, Reign of Philip the Fair, p. 396. 30.

It was, in my view, a deliberate assertion of constitutional power at a time when the emerging view of the constitution was under attack to such a degree that it looked as though it might be abandoned by the crown itself. It was, at first sight, a brilliant move. The choice of groups-the already isolated Jews, whose expulsion could be defended, at least by a king who called himself christianissimus ("Most Christian"),3' as an obvious act for the common good--and the willingness to split the take with the already financially pressed barons assuaged the public conscience; and it did so, even as the crown reinforced assertions of its paramountcy that had been temporarily checked because of the coinage issue. The next year an equally stunning attack on the Knights Templar, one of the religious orders of knights who fought in the crusades, would again make the point of the supremacy of the crown, though it is harder to fathom why they were targeted.32 Scholars tend to argue back from the charges later made against themn-mostly lies elicited by torture-namely, that they worshipped the devil, engaged in sodomy, and were avaricious.33 It is true that since the fall of the last crusader outpost in the Holy Land, Acre, in 1291, many more Templars were forced to spend their time at their monasteries (or, as they were called, commanderies) in France and elsewhere, but the monks retained, to a remarkable extent, the "heroic image" of earlier years.34 Perhaps disagreements among them led to rumors and a few nasty innuendos. It is also true that the international network of their commanderies had given them an important role as national and international bankers. And no one trusts bankers. But after the king had the Templars arrested, their accounts were audited, and it was found that they had been remarkably honest bankers. 31.

They had served, after all, as his royal treasurers. Moreover, it was at the Templar headquarters in Paris in 1305 that the king had gone into hiding when events looked like they might get out of hand that year because of the manipulation of the coinage.35 What else would they have talked about with the king in the midst of a fiscal crisis about the coinage in which he had fled to their headquarters for safety-what else besides the effect of his manipulations on the royal finances and relations with debtors and creditors? Any serious criticism (or comment that could have been construed as criticism) at that time--that is, when Philip the Fair was suffering the humiliation of having to seek refuge in his own kingdom from those who denounced his authoritarian pretensions-coupled with invidious remarks about the Templars afterwards from their enemies would be sufficient explanation for his arrest of these churchmen. And to reiterate a point made earlier, the arrest would again emphasize, indeed reaffirm, the supremacy of the crown and its regalian obligation (found in the coronation oath) to protect the church-interpreted here as excising corruption from the church.36 The Constitutional Crisis of 1314-1315: Jews and Serfs One cannot conclude the story on this note, which makes it seem as though the crown was successful in maintaining this most extreme assertion of its authority. The fact is that it thought that it had succeeded. And so, in 1311 the king tried again to revalue the coinage.37 Never a stupid man, he only overvalued it by 20 percent, nothing like the 300 percent he had imposed in the 1290s. He expected to be obeyed. I believe that he felt very deeply that he had to make something like this gesture, and that it had to focus ultimately on the coinage, where he had been stymied before, in order to fully restore the dignity of the crown and to confirm its regalian theory of power. But, as Joseph Strayer noted, "again there was a storm of protest, and 35. Strayer, Reign of Philip the Fair, p. 396. 36.

But, then, that is precisely the point: the king's act had much more to do with his sense of the dignity of the crown and the assertion of his regalian rights than with financial need. Forced to back down again in 1313 and faced with a series of rebellions in 131 4-one of the rallying cries of which was the insistence on the limitations on the crown's authority to manipulate the coinage--the king died fundamentally uncertain about the limits of his power. Whether he was uncertain about the legitimate, if unenforceable, extent of his authority may still be doubted. Nevertheless, the actions of his son, Louis X, give some insight into what had been learned at the center of royal government. Desperate for money to pay the debts incurred in containing the rebellion against his father, the young king undercut whatever moral capital his father had once commanded for expelling the Jews and accepted money from Jews in 1315 for their resettlement in the kingdom.39 He did this only after running a trial balloon by his barons to see whether they would tolerate it. Even more revealing, perhaps, on the constitutional side of the crown's problems is the decision it took to free the serfs in 1315 for a large sum of money which they were to pay.40 Yet, Louis X did not free serfs who belonged to his barons (and promise the barons the money), as his father might have done in the greatest days of his authority. To be sure, one could argue that the king simply did not want the money which baronial serfs would have paid for their freedom to get into his barons' hands. This argument, however, is difficult to accept. Louis X was willing, after all, to have former baronial Jews who would be important fiscal resources for his barons return to their baronial homelands. That was the trial balloon he had sent up which was earlier referred to. More likely, Louis X simply could not get his barons to give up their rights over their serfs. He could not get them to acknowledge his supremacy in the matter-his right to act despite their opposition-had he tried. Or, better put, he did not take the chance of making any such assertion of paramountcy in the difficult circumstances of 38. Ibid. p. 396. 39.

Conclusion Fritz Backhaus, with whom this paper began, got it wrong. True, the Germans never managed a comprehensive expulsion of the Jews in the Middle Ages, but this was not because of their jurisdictional divisions. If that had been enough, the French could not have done so in 1306. The fact of the matter is that the French crown embarked on the radical path toward comprehensive expulsion precisely and deliberately because it thought that with regard to Jews it might successfully implement a theory of royal supremacy that could challenge the particularism to which the kingdom, almost as much as Germany, was a hostage. The expulsion was not an expression of the preexisting unity of the state; it was a carefully chosen weapon used to demonstrate to the political nation that the crown had not given up on trying to implement some kind of effective paramountcy. In light of the reversals of a few years later, it was not all that successful a weapon. But it made a point, established a precedent, that would not be forgotten. To be sure, the particularism of the French state persisted for centuries, and we must not read Louis XIV's France back into the Middle Ages. But the attempts in the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries to formulate an ideology of the absolutist state, and the effort to make that ideology effective, however equivocal the results, were essential to laying the foundation for the monarchy of the Sun King.</page></plain_text>
