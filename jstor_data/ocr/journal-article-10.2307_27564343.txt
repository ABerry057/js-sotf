Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2006. xii, 307pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001128 Numerous discussions of the Jewish encounter with race in America have emerged in the last ten to fifteen years, most of them falling into two camps. 197</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews The first camp, comprising books on black-Jewish relations (or what Adam Zachary Newton refers to as "blackjewishrelations" in Facing Black and Jew, 1999), is largely written by Jewish scholars about the Jewish encounter with black America, focusing on the putative "alliance" between the two groups and generally lamenting the breakdown of relations in the past twenty-five years. The second camp, including books on issues of whiteness, immigration, and assim ilation, argues that in becoming Americans, Jews also became white (or vice versa). Most eloquently articulated by Matthew Jacobson in Whiteness of a Different Color,1 this narrative asserts that Jewish immigrants, like other immigrants from eastern and southern Europe, were stigmatized as "dark" at the turn of the century, but as the legitimacy of the racial science on which this designation was based gradually eroded in the 1930s and 1940s, Jews found themselves included with other "white" Americans as "Caucasians." Eric Goldstein's The Price of Whiteness builds on the arguments of both camps, offering a superb overview of the history of Jews and race in America that takes into account the subtleties and nuances of this highly complex subject in ways only hinted at in earlier studies. Early in the book, Goldstein takes issue with the too-simple conclusions of many works on whiteness, which argue that Jews wholeheartedly embraced white ness, at the expense of both black Americans and their own ethnic/racial (or what he generally calls "tribal") identity, in order to achieve socioeconomic success in America. Instead, he prefers to explore "how Jews negotiated their place in a complex racial world where Jewishness, whiteness, and blackness have all made sig nificant claims on them" (5). The book resists the notion that the "whitening" of immigrants was simply "a power play from below," arguing that native-born whites, "bent on preserving a stable and optimistic vision of their national culture" (5), also had a strong stake in seeing Jews as white. Likewise, the book refuses to view American Jews as monolithic group. The Price of Whiteness pays careful atten tion to gender, national background (nineteenth-century immigrants from Germany had a different relationship to racial issues than early twentieth-century immigrants from eastern Europe), and especially regional differences, distinguishing among the often radically disparate responses of southern and northern Jews to shifts in racial attitudes. The Price of Whiteness is meticulously researched, bringing to light valuable primary sources on Jewish attitudes toward race, such as southern Jewish newspa pers, that rarely find their way into broader works on whiteness. The early chapters and the final epilogue offer the most exciting new material and original readings of well-known sources. Though essential to the story, much of the detailed material in the middle chapters, especially in Part III, "Confronting Jewish Difference, 1919? 1935," rehearses analyses already offered elsewhere. The opening chapter on late nineteenth-century Jewish self-definition offers a surprising and counterintuitive take on Jewish tribalism and racial identity in the nineteenth century. The chapter uses a wealth of evidence to show how, as long as race was not necessarily 1.

This argument also sets up a crucial narrative thread for the entire book: This is not a book about the move from race to ethnicity but rather a story about the waxing and waning over the course of the twentieth century of race as an important category of self-definition for Jews. In the epilogue, Goldstein offers a bold and refreshing analysis of contemporary debates over multiculruralism and intermarriage. He takes to task scholars who insist on an oversimplified understanding of black Jewish relations in the 1960s, showing how the different historical and economic conditions of the two groups have always made mutual cooperation a complicated undertaking. And the book concludes with a convincing demonstration of the tena city of race as a marker of identity for Jews, using examples as disparate as the increased interest in genetic testing of Jews (both prenatal testing and testing to establish the genetic origins of historical Jewish groups) and the recent success of Heeb magazine, which celebrates Jewish physical distinctiveness?body shapes, hairstyles, and so on. With its refreshing arguments and careful attention to detail, The Price of Whiteness is essential reading for anyone interested in the complexity of Jewish racial identity in America.
