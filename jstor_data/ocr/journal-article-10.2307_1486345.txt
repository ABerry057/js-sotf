<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FOUNDING OF A GEMILUT HASADIM SOCIETY IN FERRARA IN 1515 By DAVID B. RUDERMAN University of Maryland Between 1515 and 1517, a voluntary association for gemilut hasadim was established by members of the Jewish community of Ferrara. This event was recorded in two Hebrew manuscripts containing the association's initial constitution, the first drawn up at the time of its establishment in Ferrara, and the second, shortly after for the neighboring community of Modena. The existence of these two manuscripts is important both in de- picting an essential development in the burgeoning Jewish community of Ferrara (and perhaps in Modena as well) and in providing another major source in an area of Jewish history lacking sufficient documentation, es- pecially in this relatively early period of the beginning of the sixteenth century. Jewish voluntary associations had existed long before the formation of the Ferrara fellowship and continued to flourish in Italy and Eastern Europe long after its establishment. Historians have noted this develop- ment in the medieval Jewish community but have concentrated on the period of the late sixteenth through eighteenth centuries, the time of the greatest proliferation of such societies, and the period yielding the most 233</page><page sequence="2">234 A GEMILUT HASADIM SOCIETY IN FERRARA substantial documentation of their activities.' However, in light of the paucity of sources before the late sixteenth century, the origin and early development of the medieval Jewish association remains relatively ob- scure. Moreover, the question of how these earlier organizations related to and influenced the dramatic rise and diffusion of the later societies has never been adequately clarified. Nor has the reason for the substantial increase in the sheer number of these organizations in the late sixteenth century been sufficiently explained.2 To the best of my knowledge, the association in Ferrara is one of the earliest organizations of its kind in the Italian Jewish community; its con- stitution is probably the earliest extant charter of such an organization throughout Italy. Could an examination of the text and context of the regu- lations of Ferrara afford a most welcome opportunity to reexamine a number of basic questions about the nature of the Jewish voluntary associa- 1. See J. Marcus, Communal Sick Care in the German Ghetto (Cincinnati, 1947), as well as the most recent monograph of A. Farine, "Charity and Study Societies in Europe of the Sixteenth-Eighteenth Centuries," Jewish Quarterly Review, n.s., LXIV (July-October 1973), 16-47, 164-75. See also the extensive bibliography on the Jewish voluntary association mentioned throughout this study. 2. Farine, op. cit., pp. 32-33, for example, lists six reasons for the increase in the number of these societies in the sixteenth century: the influx of Spanish Jewish im- migrants into Italy, North Africa, the Ottoman Empire, and Holland; the influence of the Kabbalah in Palestine; the trend in the Christian neighborhood; the tradi- tional feeling of gedakah; the growth of Jewish communities and the presence of disparate congregations in the same community; the social need of the lower middle class unable to attain to central leadership of the community. While some of these reasons may help to explain the dramatic rise of the societies, most of them remain as unproven assumptions, lacking sufficient documentation or adequate clarification. The assumption of Spanish Jewish influence on the rise of the societies is problematic and is discussed below. The kabbalistic influence was apparent, but it could not account for the proliferation of the societies beyond the fact that there existed groups for midnight prayer and burial which clearly were under such influence. Nor, without more substantial evidence, could it fully explain the attraction of these organizations in communities not necessarily affected by kabbalistic ideas emanating from Safed, especially in the early part of the sixteenth century. The traditional feeling of zedakah and the apparent Christian influence were constants, evident long before this period, which could hardly be employed as explanations for dramatic changes in the sixteenth century and after. The question of Christian influence is also dis- cussed below. The growth of communities and of disparate congregations is clearly a factor, but it does not in itself provide ample reason for the spread of this par- ticular type of organization. The social need of the middle class may provide a partial explanation; but without adequate documentation regarding the social stratifi- cation of the Jewish communities in general, especially in Italy, and regarding the membership of these societies in particular, such an assumption remains essentially unproven at present.</page><page sequence="3">DAVID B.

Specifically, does the Ferrara sodality provide a missing link between the early medieval associations, especially in Spain, and the later organizations of Italy and Eastern Europe? Was the character of the Ferrara organization the same as or different from both the earlier and later societies? What circumstances led to the establishment of the Ferrara association at such a relatively early date; and are these circum- stances also relevant in assessing the rapid formation of similar Jewish sodalities throughout the rest of Italy and elsewhere? And finally, what can the specific circumstances of this society reveal about the conjectured transmission of this societal form from Spain to Italy and finally to Prague and the rest of Eastern Europe by the end of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth centuries? The constitution of the Ferrara association elicits two further related questions, raised generally by earlier historical studies but never thoroughly explored. Firstly, does the case of Ferrara help to explain the function this society played in the development of the Jewish community as a whole? Secondly, what parallel structures in the Christian community were in existence at the same time as this society and what apparent influence, if any, did they have on its formation?3 The limited amount of existing evi- dence concerning the medieval Jewish voluntary association (as well as its Christian counterpart) hardly affords a complete answer to any of these questions. Yet a comparison of the available information with the specific evidence for Ferrara can at least raise these questions again and may even provide a partial and tentative answer to some of them. The Sources of the Ferrara Association and the Picture They Delineate The library of the University of Haifa possesses the major source for our study, the association's initial constitution, which was written in He- brew and drawn up at the time of the society's founding. The manuscript in which it is found contains three additional constitutions of the associa- 3. Farine (op. cit., p. 33) states that in some cases, the society preceded the com- munity organization, but he fails to develop the point. Regarding the possible Chris- tian influence, he dismisses the whole question by simply stating that there is no proof for such an examination: "By way of comparison, it is possible that Christian influences were behind the increase in the number of societies and the spread of their activities, just as it is possible that the existence of Jewish associations influenced the Christians. However, lacking proving data [my emphasis], it is logical to say that the influence might have been reciprocal" (ibid., p. 174).</page><page sequence="4">236 A GEMILUT HASADIM SOCIETY IN FERRARA tion, revised throughout the next century and a half. At the end of each of the four charters the names of both the male and female contributing mem- bers are listed.4 A parallel charter, evidently suggested for Modena, is located in the private collection of the late Professor Isaiah Sonne, now housed in the Isaac Ben Zevi Institute in Jerusalem. While the Haifa manu- script lacks the last seven and a half articles of the society's constitution, the Sonne manuscript is complete. Both manuscripts are nearly alike, except that the title of the first indicates that the society was founded in Ferrara in 1515, while the title of the second states that the society was founded in the neighboring community of Modena in 1516.6 Without knowing of the existence of the first manuscript, Sonne determined (in a handwritten note at the beginning of his manuscript) that the constitution for Modena had originated in Ferrara. This he concluded on the basis of an error in his manuscript: the scribe had left the name of the city of Ferrara in article 24 of the constitution, instead of changing it to read Modena. Unlike the first manuscript, the second contains no list of its founding members, nor is the scribe who copied the document mentioned by name. Besides the list of members in the first manuscript, however, the name of the scribe, Abraham Farissol, the cantor and communal scribe of Ferrara's Jewish community," is inserted. 4. The library of the University of Haifa has kindly permitted me to publish this manuscript, which appears below. I also used a microfilm of the manuscript in the Central Archives of the History of the Jewish People in Jerusalem, Microfilm HM 5231. 5. This second manuscript is catalogued as n. 4061 in the collection of the Ben Zevi Institute, and is entitled: '1"7' ,;T,'TEl D'Tofln ,"l13 1"2f1 witlnj' 6. Since the style of writing of the first document is clearly that of a Spanish Jew, it seems likely that it is only a copy of the original document copied by Farissol himself. The scribe of the second document signed his name as Ploni b. Ploni. Sonne suggested that he also was Farissol, but there is no solid evidence for such a con- clusion. It appears that his manuscript was intended, but never actually used, to found a society in Modena. J. Marcus, op. cit., p. 65, n. 93, was also aware of this second document, which Professor Sonne had personally shown him. On Farissol, see my doctoral dissertation, submitted to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in June 1974 under the guidance of Professor Haim Beinart, entitled "Abraham Farissol: An Historical Study of his Life and Thought in the Context of Jewish Communal Life in Renaissance Italy" (in Hebrew), as well as my Hebrew lecture to be published in the proceedings of the Sixth World Congress of Jewish Studies held in August 1973 in Jerusalem, entitled "Abraham Farissol's Iggeret Orhot 'Olam in its Historic Context," and my article "Mercurio Giovanni da Correggio's Appearance in Italy as Seen through the Eyes of an Italian Jew," to appear in a future issue of Renaissance Quarterly.

RUDERMAN 237 The initial nineteen stipulations of the society were formally drawn up on the sixteenth of Elul, 1515 in the synagogue of Ferrara. An examina- tion of these articles indicates that the functions of the association were multiple. Firstly, it constituted a burial society with the explicit tasks of making funeral arrangements, building the coffins, washing the bodies of the dead, and accompanying them with the mourning families to the ceme- tery. After the burial, it was responsible for assisting the immediate mourners by preparing for them their first meal and making provisions for a quorum (minyan) for the seven successive days of the personal mourn- ing period in their own home. It also assumed the responsibility of keep- ing a minimal supply of ten boards and two hundred nails on reserve for emergency use in building coffins.' The society's second function was to visit and care for the sick, especially the poor. The representatives chosen by the society were instructed to be prepared even throughout the night hours to rise to assist the ailing. Provisions were also made to extend tem- porary economic relief to any poor individual who took sick.8 Besides these two main functions, the society also saw as its proper role the main- tenance of communal peace, at least as it directly affected the membership of the organization. A specific regulation of the association called for any feud between two parties to be settled by the following Sabbath through the intervention of the representatives of the society. For any additional delay, the guilty party would be obliged to pay a punitive fee. The society also saw as its obligation the exactment of punitive fees for anyone who physically struck another individual either with the fist, a stone, or a metal weapon, the fine being commensurate with the seriousness of the blow.9 The society was organized in the following manner. Two representatives (berurim) were appointed for a stipulated period of time who were re- sponsible for appointing the various rotations of members charged with the specific tasks of the society. An additional member was assigned the responsibility of collecting the funds of the society and of making the record of the organization's income and expenditures accessible to the membership. The berurim would appoint the various members by lot to carry out specific tasks of the association on a rotating basis. The berurim were also responsible for maintaining the peace within the society and for 7. See text below, articles of the gemilut hasadim association, Ferrara, pars. 2, 4, 8,9. 8.

The major authoritative body of the society was the general membership meeting held during the first week of every month. The sexton (shammash) was responsible for fixing the exact time of the meeting and the berurim assigned a special individual to inform the members of the time of the meeting. The berurim were held responsible for meeting all of their obligations or of finding a replacement if they were themselves unable to complete a certain task. Similarly, any member assigned a specific task was requested to find his own replacement if he was unable to fulfill his obligation. Members were also required to inform the berurim of failure to carry out each task and the reason for the failure. The berurim, however, were not accountable for any specific task they failed to execute personally.'0 The means by which the society raised the required funds to operate effectively were most ingenious. As a voluntary association, it devised numerous ways of extracting donations from its membership. The initial part of the society's fund was based on the collection of monthly dues from each member, payable at the beginning of each month. If a member chose to leave the society he was required to pay a heavy fine. However, if a member was forced to leave Ferrara, this fee was not binding. At all joyous occasions, such as births and weddings, a member was requested to pay the society an additional donation. At every general membership meet- ing, members were charged additional dues." Yet the fund raising of the society was not restricted exclusively to monthly dues and compulsory donations. The society also devised an elaborate system of punitive fines for maintaining the internal discipline of the organization and as a source of additional revenue. Anyone who refused a request of the berurim was immediately fined. For the prolonga- tion of a feud, the guilty party was taxed for every Sabbath that passed until his feud was resolved. A member who failed to meet his obligation to attend a minyan at a house of mourning was exacted a minimal fine. Any member that brought injury to the society in any way was most heavily fined. Excessive swearing in God's name was punishable by fine. Any disruptions or speaking out of turn were punishable by fines proportionate to the seriousness of the offense. Fines commensurate with the seriousness of the misdemeanor were also exacted for striking another person.1' In 10. Ibid., pars. 1, 5, 11, 12, 16. 11. Ibid., pars. 6, 7, 13, 16. 12.

RUDERMAN 239 order to discourage any member from leaving the society, it was specifically mentioned that no member could remove himself for rejecting any of the agreed stipulations of this constitution. Nor could a member resign for refusing to accept directives of the society's representatives that were sup- ported by the majority of the membership.'3 In spite of this elaborate system for raising revenues, most of these regu- lations soon proved unenforceable. Individuals simply ignored any demand to pay a fine to the society for the offenses they had committed. This fact was candidly admitted in an amendment to the original charter of the or- ganization in Adar 1516. In an attempt to reinforce these punishments, it was declared that all offenders would be issued a formal document of in- debtedness to the society. If they still refused to pay their fines, they would be publicly shamed by an announcement of their sin at public prayer on Mondays and Thursdays, when the Torah was read. They were also to be excluded from being counted in a minyan and from being called to the Torah and from all other honors bestowed on members of the community, until their fine had been paid.'4 In the following year, additional amendments were appended to the original charter. The society's officers were now empowered to issue new amendments to the original constitution with the approval of a quorum of six men, thirty years of age or over. Regarding the task of caring for the sick, one new stipulation took into account the appointment, by lot, of ten representatives to fast for a seriously ill member if his loved ones had already gone to the synagogue to pray for him or if they had decided to change his name in order to avert the divine judgment.'5 A number of the other new stipulations dealt with the powers of adjudication of the so- ciety's officers. They were instructed to arbitrate disagreements between members in the absence of a permanent rabbi. Each of their judgments could be made over a maximum period of ten days, however, in case con- sultation with a rabbi was necessary. Another regulation dealt with the fines meted out to those refusing to appear for judgment before society representatives, who sat in judgment every Monday and Thursday follow- ing the time of public prayer. To eschew the responsibility of serving as one of the society's officers was undoubtedly a serious offense and was 13. Ibid., par. 19. 14. Ibid., par. 20. 15.

The last amendment dealt with the society's shammash. His responsibility was to inform the officers of the society in the event of a member's death. In general, his word was never to be doubted; ignoring his call to perform a commandment was punishable by a fine.'" The problems of internal discipline and opposition to the society as a whole by certain individuals were obviously real difficulties the association encountered in its short existence. Two of the new stipulations dealt especially with these problems. Any individual who dared to criticize or ridicule the society or its officers was severely fined. In certain instances, fines were not sufficient to restrain some persons from disapproving or treating the society with disrespect. In these more severe cases, the of- ficers of the society were instructed to write the name of the offender together with his offense, even if he was not a member of the association, and post it for public notice on the wall of the synagogue. If the offender became ill, he or his household would be denied any public support until he repented of his sin. If he did finally repent, he would be reinstated as a full-fledged member of the community.l7 The final amended charter of the association was signed by fifty-seven men and fourteen women. While there are no extensive statistical data of Ferrara's Jewish community at this time, it is obvious that not every mem- ber of the Jewish community was a member of its gemilut hasadim society. Although Joseph b. Mordecai Norzi signed the document, Emanuel Norzi and his sons, the most affluent Jews of Ferrara, were conspicuously ab- sent.'8 The charter itself referred to the existence of Jews in Ferrara who not only failed to join the society but chose to ridicule its existence. The extent of the nonparticipation of the Jewish community in this society is impossible to determine; but the fact that there were individuals who chose to remain outside the association's domain, and were even conspicuously vocal in their opposition to it, testifies to the inherent weaknesses of the voluntary association. 16.

Among those names who are recognizable are certain prominent families who had lived in Ferrara for a large part of the fifteenth century. Such individuals as Emanuel b. Jacob da Monselice, Emanuel b. Uziel da Monselice, Solomon da Lamasah, Joshua Fano, Joseph Norzi, Magnifica da Monselice, Rosa da Colonia, Yohta da Colonia, and Rosa Fano ob- viously belonged to families of banking magnates established in Ferrara and northern Italy.'9 A good proportion of the names of the signatories indicate their Franco-German background.20 Only three of the names were related directly to the original twenty-one families of Spanish 6migr6s that arrived in Ferrara at the invitation of Ercole I in 1493: Abraham de Calo, Abraham b. Joshua de Calo, and Isaac Levi Sfaradi.2' Of the small proportion of names that are easily identifiable, at least in regard to place of origin, the majority of individuals seem to come from either France or Germany, or from families which had resided in Italy for a long period of time. Only a small number seem to be Spanish immigrants. Either most of the original Spanish families had already left Ferrara in this short period of time or the vast majority of them simply declined to join this association dominated by Jews of Ashkenazic origin. Whatever the case, the associa- tion, like the entire Jewish community with its one synagogue, was com- 19. Abraham da Colonia acquired a bank together with Elia da Monselice in Mantua in 1481.

Baer has pointed out that this problem of historical continuity clearly parallels the same difficulty of determining the relationship between the medieval Christian guilds and the earlier Graeco-Roman associations. In Spain, where there is first evi- dence of Jewish voluntary associations in the thirteenth and fourteenth cen- turies, the question of cultural transmission is further complicated by the existence of the earlier Moslem heritage and its effect, if any, on the evo- lution of these Jewish societal forms. At least one can safely say that the medieval associations were indebted to the earlier Talmudic prototypes in their adoption of the rabbinic phraseology of "bikkur holim," "gemilut hasadim," etc., and more generally in their traditional concern for social welfare in their communities.24 The first evidence of a Jewish voluntary association in Spain is recorded as early as the age of Solomon Ibn Adret (1265-1310), who mentions the existence of a Jewish burial society in the community of L6rida. Adret recorded the rules of this society, which had been drawn up by a commis- sion of five members appointed by the society. They included a society entrance fee, the raising of funds through subscriptions and endowments, and the investment by the berurim in profit-making enterprises on behalf of the society. The society also raised money by lending out its resources 22. One signatory, Isaiah Farissol, may have been a relative of Abraham, perhaps even his son, if Abraham had in fact married. 23.

By the middle of the next century, similar so- cieties are documented in Huesca and Saragossa. In 1323, the statutes of the Huesca burial society were enacted. While the primary function of this association was to bury the dead, it also included as one of its duties the visiting of the sick. The specific stipulations, approved by the local gov- ernment, included the formation of seven rotating subgroups, each with its own director. When an individual died, the entire society would gather in the synagogue where the deceased prayed on the Sabbath. On happy occasions the entire society would also assemble together. The Huesca society was partially professional in character in that, excluding its services to mourners, members were paid for their functions. Special regulations also dealt with the triennial payment of dues, the ostracism of feuding members, and the punishment of those guilty of moral turpitude.26 In Saragossa, a grave-digging association is recorded in the tax ordi- nances of the Jewish community for 1331.27 In 1336, a craft fellowship of Jewish shoemakers was also organized in Saragossa. This society repre- sented a sick-care and mutual-aid guild. Members attended the weddings and circumcisions of their fellow members, and on such occasions, special donations to the society's funds were requested. All members visited the sick on the Sabbath and appointed representatives to visit them twice a week; they also attended to the dying in their last hours. An elaborate system of donations and punitive fines was enacted by this organization in order to raise sufficient finances for its public fund. Special provisions also existed to deal with discord between the members, including ostra- cism, if such an extreme course was deemed necessary.28 25. Marcus, op. cit., pp. 61 ff.; 1.

Yehiel, Nissim b. Reuben, and Simon b. Semah Duran. An association of gravediggers is recorded in Valencia in 1369, in Barce- lona in 1391, and in Murviedro in 1414. All of these societies possessed similar stipulations: the gathering of the members at the deathbed, the washing of the body, the appointment of an individual to announce the death ("cride los muertos"), the accompanying of the body to the ceme- tery, the burial, the preparation of the first meal for the mourners, and the attendance at the minyan in the house of the immediate mourners during the shiv'ah period.s0 The emergence of these fellowships was not limited to Spain. In medie- val Germany and southern France, such associations are recorded in Mil- tenberg, near Mayence, in 1329, and in Perpignan in 1380. In 1481 there is evidence of such a fellowship existing in Vilna.31 After the mass immigration of Spanish-Portuguese exiles in 1492, var- ious voluntary associations were founded in Salonika, beginning with the Talmud Torah association of 1520.32 By the middle of the sixteenth cen- tury, the proliferation of these pious associations proceeded at a rapid pace first in Italy and then throughout Eastern Europe. By the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the documentation of these societies is far more com- plete.33 An additional factor in the rise of these associations in Safed and in some of the Italian communities may have been the revival of kabbalistic theories concentrating especially on the spiritual care of the dying and on the composition of special liturgies on the deathbed.34 In Italy itself, scattered references to voluntary associations before the second half of the sixteenth century are found in Florence, Mantua, and 29.

By the following century, beginning with the. Man- tuan and Roman Jewish associations, the establishment of a plethora of voluntary associations throughout every major Jewish community in Italy soon became a common phenomenon. Records of these associations are most plentiful for the Jewish communities of Rome, Emilia, Venice, Mantua, Padua, and Verona."G In Ferrara, there is evidence of the existence of at least four different Jewish associations by the second quarter of the seventeenth century."7 Closely related to Venice, the Prague Jewish com- munity founded its first fellowship for aiding the poor and sick and burying the dead in 1564. This organization served as the model for all subsequent 35. Simonsohn, op. cit., p. 400, gives the date of the founding of a kuppat gemilut h.asadim in Mantua as 1534. The oldest charter of the society, however, is not extant before 1560. D. Carpi, Ha-Yehudim be-Padova bi-Tekufat ha-Renesans, doctoral dis- sertation submitted to the Hebrew University (Jerusalem, 1967), p. 92, mentions the existence of a Jewish craft organization in fifteenth-century Padua. M. D. Cas- suto, Ha-Yehudim be-Firenze bi-Tekufat ha-Renesans, translated into Hebrew from the Italian by M. Artom (Jerusalem, 1967), p. 163, cites scattered references to communal welfare organizations in Florence in the same century, p. 163. 36. In Rome, the first gemilut hasadim society was established in 1554 and was soon followed by a large number of similar societies in the seventeenth century. Cf. H. Vogelstein and P.

This brief survey of the evolution of the Jewish voluntary association in the medieval period should already indicate the obvious difficulties involved in comparing the nature of the Ferrara association with that of earlier associations, especially in Spain. Not only are the complete charters of the Spanish associations of the fourteenth century extant only in a few rare cases, but the charters for these associations in the fifteenth century are also lacking. Nevertheless, a general comparison between the two Spanish associations of Huesca and Saragossa with that of Ferrara would reveal both common and disparate elements. Unlike the Huesca burial society, the members of the Ferrara fellowship were never paid for any of their services. In both societies, there is mention of a rotation system, even though it is described in more detail in the Huesca regulations. Unlike the Saragossa brotherhood, the Ferrara association was not a craft guild but was open to the entire Jewish population. All three associations had simi- lar means of collecting their funds, similar responsibilities of visiting and caring for the sick and for burial of the dead, and included special pro- visions for the maintenance of social order and individual morality. Widening this comparison to include the later Italian societies as well as those of Central and Eastern Europe, one can readily agree with Marcus that while no two societies are exactly alike, they are usually similar in their broad outlines."39 Ferrara's regulations share with numerous other societies the same provisions for appointing permanent and temporary officials, detailed rules of conduct, various methods for collecting funds, periodic meetings of the entire membership with its officers, fines for vari- ous offenses committed against the society, and general procedures for the care of the sick, the burial of the dead, and assistance to the mourning family. Like other societies, the Ferrara fellowship was plagued with the problem of group discipline and of enforcing its punitive decisions on individual members. The general methods of repeated fines, public sham- ing, and even expulsion from the society as a whole, utilized by the Ferarra association, are often found in the other societies as well. The ingenuity of the officers of the Ferrara association in raising money is repeatedly 38. Marcus, op. cit., pp. 68 ff. The subsequent development of these associations is adequately discussed by Marcus throughout the remainder of his book and need not be summarized here. See also Farine, op. cit. 39.

RUDERMAN 247 displayed by officers of other societies: special collections on holidays, donations for honors in the synagogue, charity boxes at times of public prayer, special collections at public meetings, donations in honor of weddings, circumcisions and bar-mitzvahs as well as the elaborate system of fines for refusing office, absence from meetings and from fulfilling vari- ous responsibilities, talking at meetings, feuding with members, resigning or being expelled from the society, etc.40 The Ferrara association, like other societies, also allowed the active participation of women in its ranks. Though women were probably excluded from participation in most other communal functions, the association provided them with an outlet for their charitable concerns and organizational abilities.'1" Clearly not unique in most of its stipulations, the Ferrara document still reflects its own special ambience. The obsessive concern for group discipline and the inability of the organization either to successfully enforce its decisions or totally command the respect of the entire Jewish community demonstrates quite well the lack of any centralized structure of communal control in this early stage of development.42 In the absence of any highly developed communal structure, the creation of a voluntary association would seem to represent one of the first stages of centralized communal activity in Ferrara. Obviously displaying the inherent weaknesses of its 40. See Marcus's summary, ibid., pp. 95-104; and generally, Farine, op. cit. 41. See Baron, op. cit., I, 349; Farine, op. cit., pp. 27-28. 42. While Jews had settled in the environs of Ferrara from at least the thirteenth century (see V. Colorni, "Ebrei in Ferrara nei secoli XIII e XIV," in Miscellanea di studi in memnoria di Dario Disegni [Turin, 1969], pp. 69-106), the first signs of organized communal activity only began to manifest themselves, however, in the second half of the fifteenth century. In 1418 two citizens of Ferrara already repre- sented their community at the Jewish synod in Forli. (L. Finkelstein, Jewish Self- Government in the Middle Ages [New York, 1924; reprinted New York, 1964], p. 282.) By 1451 a Jewish communal cemetery was first established in Ferrara at San Girolamo. In 1458 the wish to establish a synagogue was expressed by the Jewish community of Ferrara; and in 1466 a formal request of this nature was presented to Duke Borso. (See A. Pesaro, Memorie storiche sulla communith israeli- tica ferrarese [Ferrara, 1878], p. 12 and A. Balletti, Gli Ebrei e gli Estensi [Modena, 1914 (Reggio-Emilia, 1930) ], p. 95.) In 1469 the first evidence of the existence of the office of cantor as well as some structured Jewish community is found in a source observed by both Pesaro and Balletti (Pesaro, p. 13; Balletti, p. 95). In 1487, Ser Melli's will to the Jewish community of Ferrara, presenting a permanent place of worship to the community, mentions two new communal functionaries, the sham- mash of the synagogue and a teacher for the poor children of the synagogue. (See A. Pesaro, "Ser Samuele Melli," II Vessilo Israelitico, XXXV [1877], 221-23.) Thus, besides a synagogue, cantor, teacher, and sexton, there is no evidence of any other communal structure in Ferrara prior to the founding of this association.</page><page sequence="16">248 A GEMILUT .IASADIM SOCIETY IN FERRARA voluntary character, the society nevertheless aspired to assume the same functions a fully developed community would more effectively discharge in a later period: provision for essential social services, maintenance of public order, judicature between disputing parties, and the raising of public finance. While voluntary associations and a centralized community structure eventually existed side by side in Ferrara as well as in other Jewish communities, the association, at this time, provided the only active cell of general communal activity, besides prayer and study centered in the synagogue. The Circumstances Leading to the Establishment of the Ferrara Sodality What then was the primary impetus in the formation of the Ferrara asso- ciation? One possible suggestion has already been made that the rise of the Jewish voluntary association in Italy is directly attributable to those Span- ish Jewish exiles who reached Italy, bringing with them the same societal patterns they had known in Spain. These same patterns were not only nur- tured in Italy and the other countries of the Mediterranean basin, but were eventually transmitted to Prague and then to the rest of Central and East- ern Europe.43 This might seem to explain the phenomenon of the Jewish association of Ferrara: the arrival of the Spanish exiles at Ferrara served as a catalyst which stimulated the Jewish community to establish its chari- table fellowship. This explanation, however, at least with regard to the special circumstances of Ferrara, is not totally satisfactory. In the first place, without adequate documentary evidence on the existence of volun- tary associations in the Spanish Jewish community during the period imme- diately prior to the exile, the conclusion that the Spanish 6migr6s were totally familiar with this form of organization and then transported it to their new surroundings represents at best an educated guess. Still more problematic is the evidence which the Ferrara constitution does in fact present. Twenty-one Spanish Jewish families were settled in Ferrara as early as 1493."44 Yet the gemilut hasadim society was not established until 1515, twenty-three years later. Why a time lag of so many years if indeed these exiles were actually concerned with establishing the same communal 43. This is the conclusion of Grunwald, "Aus Spanien und Portugal," p. 367; Marcus, op. cit., p. 65; and Farine, op. cit., pp. 32, 172-73. 44. See Modena's article mentioned above.</page><page sequence="17">DAVID B. RUDERMAN 249 structure they had left in the Iberian peninsula? Even more difficult to ex- plain is the clear evidence of the signatories themselves; the majority of the founding members were not of Sephardic origin. They were French, German, and Italian. Only two of the original Spanish Jews who reached Ferrara actually signed the document of 1515, along with a third Jew of Spanish origin. While one need not reject outright the possibility of some Spanish influence on the decision to organize the Ferrara sodality, this influence in itself is not sufficient to explain the rise of the society. Another possible influence may have been the parallel development of similar organs of Christian piety in the non-Jewish community of Ferrara as well as in Italy as a whole. Most of the studies mentioned above hardly consider seriously the question of the Christian influence as a factor in the rise of the Jewish voluntary associations. In spite of the traditional roots of social concern found within the Jewish community itself, the obvious similarities between the Christian confraternity and the Jewish voluntary association cannot be discounted altogether.45 Marcus alone has generally discussed the similar patterns of the Christian and Jewish organizations. Both professed similar goals of education, prayer, and philanthropy, all subsumed under a common religious zeal. In the broad outlines of their organizational structure, both Jewish and Christian fellowships maintained an autonomous social jurisdiction, a bureaucratic framework of officers, entrance fees, dues, donations, and fines, and often carried out the double functions of caring for the sick as well as the dead. The primary difference between the two, according to Marcus, was that for the Jew, the association acted merely as an instrument of social welfare; for the Christian, it en- compassed an entire way of life.46 The evolution of the Christian pious association in Italy has been pri- 45. Jewish historians who have mentioned the parallel between the medieval Christian and Jewish charitable associations include F. Baer, "Der Ursprung ... " p. 244; Carpi, op. cit., p. 86; Simonsohn, Mantua, p. 399, n. 129 (who then adds that the special relationship between the Christian guild and its Jewish counterpart is in need of additional study). In this same light, Simonsohn later compared the parallel structure of the medieval Christian guilds with that of the medieval Jewish com- munity of Italy. See his "The Jewish Community in Italy and the Christian Corpora- tion" (Hebrew), in Dat ve-Hevrah (lectures delivered at the Ninth Convention of the Historical Society of Israel in December 1963) (Jerusalem, 1964), pp. 81-102. See also Farine, op. cit., pp. 32-33, 174 and n. 6 and 7 above; and especially Marcus, op. cit., pp. 72 ff. 46. Marcus, op. cit. Clearly Marcus's last generalization needs qualification, es- pecially with regard to the different kinds of Christian confraternities. See my sum- mary of Pullan below.</page><page sequence="18">250 A GEMILUT IJASADIM SOCIETY IN FERRARA marily documented by the researches of Gennaro Monti.47 What is evident from his work is that the Christian associations preceded the Jewish ones by centuries. In Ferrara, for example, the first Christian sick-care associa- tion, La Compagnia di S. Maria Novella, was founded as early as 1354. In Bologna a similar association can be traced back to the thirteenth cen- tury.4S Most recently, the exhaustive treatment of associations of Christian charity in Venice by Brian Pullan has shed considerable light on an area clearly lacking sufficient historical treatment."49 While Pullan's discussion is based almost entirely on Venetian sources, it can sketch some kind of general perspective in which to set other Italian cities, including Ferrara. Regardless of the differences in the constitutional arrangements under which Venetians and Ferrarese lived in the sixteenth century, they were both invariably ruled by an aristocratic elite, whether determined by birth or by wealth, which usually showed a primary commitment to its own self- serving interests."5 Moreover, Venice and Ferrara were both Catholic so- cieties, exposed to the same international religious movements, which transcended the boundaries of their particular states. In some respects, the Venetian solutions to the problems of poor relief were highly individual- istic, reflecting the particular social and political ambience of Venice. But in many other respects, the solutions were highly conventional, simply mir- roring trends and developments widespread throughout other Catholic Ital- ian cities. Most important, Venice in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries shared with all of north and central Italy, as well as Western Europe as a whole, similar conditions of spiraling population growth and dislocation, war, famine, and disease. These common conditions were ultimately more significant in shaping a similar program of poor relief in most Italian states than any particular circumstances affecting each individual community's differences. 1 47.

The fact that Pullan himself is aware of the applicability of his conclusions to other Italian communities throughout his work can hardly be missed by his reader. Initially he defines his study as one dealing with, among other things, the problem of the poor, which "can, moreover, throw a certain light on a broader historical question not confined to the Venetian Republic, the question of the treat- ment of the poor in a Roman Catholic society in the ages of Reformation and</page><page sequence="19">DAVID B. RUDERMAN 251 Pullan describes the evolution of the various Scuole, the several forms of religious societies existing among the Venetian laity between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries." In the earlier period, the Scuole Grandi func- tioned not only as devotional societies but also as philanthropic associa- tions. In the later centuries, the separate orders were essentially divided between rich and poor. The system evolved whereby the rich passed a lim- ited proportion of their wealth down to the poor, doing so formally in the name of the Christian ideal of brotherhood. The Scuole ultimately existed to make Venetian religion and charity appear magnificent in the eyes of its citizenry and to attract politically starved citizens into the service of the Venetian state. Over the centuries, these Scuole soon lost their penitential character, becoming increasingly worldly and ostentatious. A clear de- marcation soon existed between societies of rich and poor members. All of these associations were eventually absorbed into the structure of the state, expressing its official propaganda, providing dignity, employment, and honor to its estate of citizens, and serving its established resident, "respectable poor"' 5 About 1500, however, the emergence of new structures of Christian charity significantly altered the existing organizational patterns. A new awareness of the problems of poverty and disease and a new concern for the societal outcast were heightened by a combination of economic, social, and intellectual forces affecting Italian society as a whole. The most ob- vious stimuli to this renewed social consciousness were the recurrent out- breaks of disease and war at the turn of the century. After a relative equi- librium of peace and prosperity for most of the second half of the fifteenth century, Italian society now faced the challenge of widespread warfare and incessant epidemics on a scale previously unknown. One of the bitter side- effects of the ravaging French armies in Italy at the end of the fifteenth Counter-Reformation" (Pullan, op. cit., pp. 10-11). Compare also his comments on pp. 12, 13, 35-36, 38-39, 199, 202 ft., 232 ff., 279. On a similar situation regarding poor relief in Catholic Lyon in the sixteenth century, see N. Z.

On the economic problems of Italy as a whole in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, see the Cambridge Economic History of Europe, IV (Cambridge, 1967), 33 ff. 52. In a similar manner to the above, Pullan writes: "Venetian Scuole can there- fore be studied in the knowledge that they were no isolated phenomenon" (ibid., pp. 38-39). Earlier he declares that the Scuole Grandi of Venice were simply the Venetian version of a form of religious fraternity, the Scuola dei Battuti, which was very widespread throughout Italy (ibid., p. 12). 53. Pullan, op. cit., pp. 63-186.</page><page sequence="20">252 A GEMILUT HASADIM SOCIETY IN FERRARA century was the rapid spread of syphilis throughout Italy. Bubonic plague was also a potent killer during this same period. Besides these physical stimuli, Christian humanism also acted as a powerful force in contributing to a new attitude toward the poor by emphasizing consistent and righteous conduct rather than the mystical facets of religion. Throughout all of West- ern Europe, the volume of systematic social legislation issued by city au- thorities in the first quarter of the sixteenth century grew significantly. During this same period, Italy experienced a comparable increase in the number of lay and clerical societies which combined evangelism with relief for the poor, and which shared both the preoccupations and attitudes of the public legislators. Most famous of all these fellowships was the Com- pagnie del Divino Amore, founded in Rome in 1513, and comprising both priests and laymen devoted to charity and evangelism. This society devoted special attention to the care of the outcast and systematically maintained hospitals for the care of the chronically ill.54 Both in their old and new forms, the Christian charitable associations of Italy in general, and Venice in particular, thus paralleled those of the Jew- ish community only in their most general goal of philanthropy motivated by religious zeal. The earlier Scuole, which were clearly tied up with the political state in aspirations and economic functions, had little opportunity for contact or influence upon the Jewish community. The newer evangeli- cal associations, in their deep religious coloring, their public flagellations and processions, also parted company with their Jewish counterparts by placing unusual emphasis on the exclusively Christian roots of their enter- prise. Of course, Pullan's portrait of the Christian association is still based primarily on the situation in Venice. A parallel portrait of the situation in Ferrara would strengthen further the tentative conclusion deduced from Pullan's evidence that Christian influence upon the Jewish sodality was minimal or virtually nonexistent. Most desirable would be the opportunity to compare at close range a constitution of a Christian voluntary associa- tion in Ferrara drawn up at about the same time as that of the Jewish asso- ciation. While the sources for such a comparison are admittedly incom- plete, the opportunity to study the charter of a Ferrarese confraternity from 54.

RUDERMAN 253 the same period does exist, at least in one instance. Among the numerous associations founded during the reign of Ercole I in Ferrara, the Scuola di San Martino, established on April 1, 1490, was one of the most famous. The statutes of this confraternity survive in a manuscript located in the Biblioteca Ariostea of Ferrara.55 The shortcomings of comparing the statutes of this society with that of the Jewish community are obvious: the Jewish regulations were composed more than twenty-five years after the Christian ones; the Christian society was exclusively preoccupied with char- ity; the Jewish group had multiple functions in addition to poor relief; and the Jewish statutes are more detailed than the very general Christian provisions. Yet in spite of the time lapse between the founding of the two societies, the San Martino association could hardly have differed funda- mentally from contemporary and later Christian confraternities in Ferrara and elsewhere in Italy.56 Moreover, in view of its public importance and 55. Biblioteca Ariostea of Ferrara MS. CL. I, 346 (hereinafter cited as BAF CL. I, 346), entitled "Capitoli della compagnia chiamata la scola de' poveri vergognosi sotto la protezione di S. Martino." On poor relief in Ferrara during the reign of Ercole I, see Gundersheimer, op. cit., pp. 186 ff., especially his description of this association, pp. 189 ff., which first led me to examine its articles. See also by the same author, Art and Life at the Court of Ercole I D'Este (Geneva, 1972), pp. 89-96. 56. The fact that the statutes of the Ferrarese confraternity were highly conven- tional and almost identical to those of numerous other Christian societies throughout Italy during this period can be easily documented. Paschini has described the founding of the S. Girolamo society in Florence as early as 1442 by S. Antonino, which served as a model for most subsequent societies in Italy. Like the Ferrara confraternity, it was founded primarily to aid the "poveri vergognosi" (for a defini- tion of this term, see below). Like the Ferrara confraternity, its membership included twelve laymen, chosen for their honorable character and extreme piety. Also like the Ferrara confraternity, the procedures for the collection and distribution of charity were conducted in secrecy (see Paschini, op. cit., pp. 4 ff.). The statutes of Bologna's Confraternitd dei poveri vergognosi sotto il titolo di S. Nicolo in 1511 were also identical in purpose and structure to the societies of Florence and Ferrara (ibid., pp. 6 ff.). Similar societies were founded in Faenza, Verona, Vicenza, Pavia, and Orvieto during the same period, all expressly concerned with the problem of the "poveri vergognosi" (ibid., pp. 7-10). Moreover, the first Compagnie del Divino Amore founded in Genoa in 1497 was not radically different in its goals and or- ganization from these earlier poor-relief societies, including that of Ferrara. Its statutes (published by Pietro Tacchi Venturi, in Storia della Compagnia di Gesh in Italia [Rome, 1930], vol. I, pt. 2, pp. 25-42) reveal obvious similarities to those of Ferrara, with their emphasis upon prayer and penitence, the honesty and good char- acter of the members, and the secrecy of their work. According to Paschini, the society of Genoa served as a model for numerous other confraternities founded in Rome, which then proliferated throughout Italy during the first half of the six- teenth century (see Paschini, op. cit., pp. 11 ff.).</page><page sequence="22">254 A GEMILUT HASADIM SOCIETY IN FERRARA governmental support, it may even have served as a model for subsequent organizations of poor relief in Ferrara. The other shortcomings notwith- standing, the usefulness of comparing the two sets of statutes needs no fur- ther justification. To my knowledge, no such comparison of even two such dissimilar voluntary associations has ever been made. The Scuola di San Martino was founded for the expressed purpose of providing for the "poveri vergognosi" of Ferrara. This specific group in- cluded persons of high social standing or gentle birth who had suffered recent reverses of fortune which had plunged them into poverty.57 This newly created problem of poverty is explained in terms of worldly mis- fortune, especially the recent war with Venice, which had ravaged the population of Ferrara.58 From the beginning of the statutes, the religious zeal motivating the founders of the confraternity is evident. To the foun- ders, poverty is repulsive because it leads to a condition of moral depravity. Thus charity is instrumental in strengthening the moral fiber of society.59 The Christian society was organized as a self-perpetuating body con- sisting of thirteen members: a priest and twelve laymen, clearly reminiscent of Christ and his disciples.60 It is evident from the statutes that appointment to this confraternity signified a heightened status to the participants; each of these notables is explicitly mentioned by name.61 An elaborate system of collection and distribution of funds is also delineated. A prior was appointed on a monthly basis to keep precise records of the society; the collection box was strictly supervised by him and always kept under lock and key. Funds for charity were collected at major places of assembly 57. On the definition of "poveri vergognosi" and their significance for Venice and elsewhere, see Pullan, op. cit., pp. 229, 373. 58.

RUDERMAN 255 throughout the city, and especially at mass, by several designated mem- bers. Each member of the society was responsible for a specific district of the city; he was charged with adequately providing for the needy in his area."62 No excessive funds were allowed to accumulate; except for certain material goods, all charity had to be distributed soon after it was collected. The moral character of both the benefactor and the recipient was also emphasized. Each member of the society had to be morally scrupulous in performing his sacred tasks; he had to make regular confessions at desig- nated areas and times. Likewise, only the "honorable poor" were worthy of the society's donations. Because of the respected stature of these needy persons, an effort was made to distribute the charity surreptitiously in order not to embarrass the recipients."63 Thus the system of redistributing a portion of the wealth to provide for the "shamefaced poor" seemed to work quite efficiently. Not only was every area of the municipality of Ferrara effectively canvassed both for donations as well as for handouts, but the efforts of the society seemed to enjoy the universal support of the entire community. The confraternity could expect the blessings of the Church, the bishop, and Ercole's court. As an organization supported by the aristocracy of Ferrara, it could readily expect easy access to the major sources of wealth in the city, including the coffers of the honorable duke himself.64 Thus, in many ways, the Jewish association was essentially dissimilar from the Christian society. Its support clearly was intended for all members of the small Jewish population of Ferrara and not only for its "shamefaced poor," and its functions went beyond the mere providing of funds for the needy. In addition to burial and care for the sick, its responsibility for maintaining communal peace, at least within the confines of the society, has already been emphasized above. The organization of the Jewish con- fraternity, based on a rotation system and general membership meetings, had little in common with that of the Christian association. Its elaborate system of collecting fines and donations was also unique and bore little resemblance to the relatively simple procedures for Christian fund raising.

Unlike the Christian association supported by both church and state, the Jewish group displayed most blatantly the inherent weaknesses of a truly volun- teer association. It could expect only partial support from its membership; its most glaring deficiency was its utter inability to enforce any of its de- cisions effectively. Of course, the goals and procedures of the Jewish and Christian organi- zations were not totally dissimilar. The religious motivation of their mem- bers is continually emphasized. Both societies shared the same concern with maintaining high moral standards, and only those with honorable character could benefit from the services offered by both societies.65 More- over, both associations provided a heightened sense of social status and involvement to those who actively participated in their activities. In both associations, names of the honored members were singled out for special recognition. Yet without ignoring these obvious similarities, the articles of the Scuola di San Martino leave little doubt that the Jewish and Christian associations had virtually no relationship to each other. Thus, both Chris- tian poor relief in Venice, as described by Pullan, and that of Ferrara, described in the articles of the San Martino confraternity, illustrate quite convincingly that the establishment of the gemilut hasadim society in Fer- rara cannot be attributed to Christian influence. Perhaps a more suitable explanation can be found, however, in the evi- dence-summarized above-which Pullan presents concerning all of north- central Italy, including Venice. While his discussion indicates a lack of any direct influence by the new Christian societies on their Jewish counter- parts, the situation from which both societies arose was essentially the same. The wars and epidemics which swept across Italy throughout the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth centuries undoubtedly af- fected Christian and Jew alike. Ferrara, like Venice, saw large numbers of its population decimated by the constant recurrence of deadly plagues in the first quarter of the sixteenth century. Frangois Tissard, a visiting French scholar and associate of Abraham Farissol, testified that he fled Fer- rara for Bologna because of the epidemic which closed the entire University 65. Note the similarity of tone regarding the sinner violating the rules of the Jewish association (see text below, par. 24) with the following: "Inviolabilmente ob- servande che a persona di mala fama &amp; inhonestamente vivente mai elemosina fusse fatta se non in articulo de neccessita extrema" (fol. 16).</page><page sequence="25">DAVID B. RUDERMAN 257 of Ferrara in 1505.66 As a result of this plague, thousands perished in Fer- rara alone in the wake of the horrendous famine in the summer of that year.67 Emanuel Norzi, the most powerful Jew of Ferrara, died sometime after 1524 as the result of another ravaging epidemic, which swept over all of northern Italy and plagued Ferrara for over five years.G8 After Ercole's death in 1505, his son Alphonso introduced the city to one of its most try- ing periods of warfare and bloodshed for more than a decade.69 When Christian society began to respond to these difficult socioeconomic condi- tions through the creation of more effective voluntary associations, a sim- ilar response was probably demonstrated by the Jewish community. How- ever, instead of following models of Christian devotion and piety, the Jew- ish community looked to its own models embedded in its traditional sources. Excluded by the Christian fellowship, the Jewish society of Fer- rara sought a solution to its genuine need by drawing inspiration from the Rabbinic ideals of zedakah, and the specific idea and structure of its asso- ciation from Spanish-Ashkenazic precedents. The model which the Jewish community of Ferrara finally adopted must have eventually enjoyed a relative degree of success. With minor changes, the structure of the association established in 1515 remained essentially intact for more than a century, as evidenced by the three constitutions appended to the original document. The original gemilut h.asadim society most likely provided a working model for the formation of additional asso- ciations in seventeenth-century Ferrara. Moreover, the existence of an exact replica of the Ferrara regulations in the name of the Modena Jewish community testifies to the wide influence these formulations had outside the boundaries of Ferrara. In short, the articles of Ferrara's gemilut hasadim society, in helping to clarify the circumstances of the founding of a voluntary association in one specific Jewish community in Italy, may also offer some plausible explana- tion for the rapid diffusion of such societies throughout Italy and Eastern Europe during the next two centuries. Long before the Counter-Reforma- tion, the establishment of the Jewish ghetto in Italy, or the spread of the 66. On Tissard's visit to Ferrara, see N.

It did not arise directly out of Christian influence nor out of any special efforts by Spanish Jewish exiles to recreate a communal struc- ture familiar to them in their country of origin. The Ferrara Jewish sodal- ity represented a united achievement of various elements of the community in offering an immediate solution to the dramatic problems of poverty and illness facing the entire Italian populace on a scale previously unknown at the turn of the sixteenth century. More than any apparent influence, the problems of economic and physical survival were those that most con- cerned the founders of this initial communal institution of social activity in Ferrara. Sharing similar physical and economic conditions, other Italian Jewish communities may have imitated the example of Ferrara years before the political and social climate changed adversely for Italian Jewry in the middle of the sixteenth century. And because of the deteriorating circum- stances of Jewish life in Italy, the development of new organs of poor relief among Italian Jews, initiated at the beginning of the sixteenth century, was rapidly accelerated by the end of that century.</page><page sequence="27">APPENDIX THE CHARTER OF THE GEMILUT HASADIM SOCIETY OF FERRARA 1515 * i)"i) T$SD 099y ~'TT) 110' 73n1 5 In00 1 'D 11W oDKml '910'Cpi 13 n13171737100 1";IY $19 1"t32 1"Y' ip"pi); 'WN1~ ng0000 NW1'D ~' 13 aDC p n'100 0192 020 nl, yP~~I2 O'W31ip31 .lllr ,',l l~ 'T't ' $ 2 " '" , ;1nl 5DS nl1@991 110@$5 " nKm'31 09@V 293 a'100 n1992 n7202 10003 'ItN $3C5 0935 ;l'1 TiNK 71 0131 1'1'3T' '1WN110 10~ 1K23 09i~ 3 .1111 '1303 0231331 13'~3CV~r PlDT3 DW20 "nl~ ;11; ;lyy3; WW900 KSitS NW B"i) n0330; n~ itS DhI 7": NW19 i"7 It,,' I t1?0 DtNl U~,N 100 5y 0 ,1l' Di"Ca , 'i,' 1wN 3.11'3'1ND1 3"3 S11"10 '31713 : 18900; 'ttrN nl183001 D'N3in Di 15N1 .,V'r 1 ;T I ,'I D '111 il' I 017 ,"00 2 0j31Y'21 "T1"r ,'It] ,;lb DI;I Dr'"il ';T n1m1873 r N "inux , 3 n017 , n m,n nnm 11 mn 1 IS D"nm n91 1"n 0'1 11ni' n10'3300 nf11n3 Di$ 11001 D'D~ YBS 1r }12132 121312 178i3'11 ;I;lt 1 '70 D'TDM~ .i'i'W itU 71 0K;13100 5N ;1131000 131 -rt'D ;Irvu ;ri ti 1100 nlNE1001r ;rb D'WV3N 0023 1122 N17BS1 117295 0'11313 1';' 001 1; 1S;1$ TV'111 P 20~ '3 5Yt ' 0039 Y(fIS1 ]102Y~'133 PVN 03fl0 D'100l mt79 00~ '11109) 13"17 7'110' '11ND1 ;iND 17NU~ 'D3; D'lum f 11091 D*$5h 13 A TVn '0 I~11335 001791 D'O'1l nl1992 ;ru'p'2 DT'S ftU' ~trN ~n liNb 0 10 n1N; 000~ P03 N TE7N; D;-r n1799 JIln 'inK ?1N1 7'1102' '133 TV Di'%5 f10991 012291 D"in; it3 51 DnlN nEN~vS 7C13 (10181 na00 '7N 1'7Y .021N DYWlt1891 DnS'$ D'92ND ill 1 Dillip *This text is based essentially on the document of the Ferrara society located in the library of the University of Haifa.

The problem is further com- plicated by the common distinction in the sixteenth century between monies of account and actual currency in everyday circulation. (On this distinction, see The Cambridge Economic History of Europe, IV [Cambridge, 1967], 378-79.) It is interesting to note that the basic coin used here is the bolognino, the coin of Bologna and not the ferrarino, its equivalent in Ferrara. (Cf. D. G. Carli-Rubbi, Delle monete e dell' instituzione delle Zecche d'Italia dell'antico e presente sisrema di esse, 4 vols. [Mantua, 1754] I, 281.) According to Carli-Rubbi and the data supplied by the charter itself, one bolognino is equivalent to six quattrini and twelve danari (probably equated here with the term, peshutimn, based on the Talmudic peshita). Six bolognini equal one testone. Dinarim bolognini (paragraph 18) are probably the same as bolognini and perhaps dinarim (paragraphs 14, 22, 26). The precise value of the more valuable gold ducat coin mentioned in paragraph 27 is not known to me. Compare Carli- Rubbi, I, 281-88 and 294-312 for Bologna and Ferrara, and F. C. Lane, Venetian Ships and Shipbuilders of the Renaissance (Baltimore, 1934), pp. 251-52 for Venice as well as the tables in W. A. Shaw, The History of Currency, 1252-1896 (New York and London, 1896; reprinted New York, 1967), for Venice, Florence and other Italian cities.</page><page sequence="29">DAVID B.
