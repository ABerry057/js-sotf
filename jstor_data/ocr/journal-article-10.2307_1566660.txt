<plain_text><page sequence="1">Miriam Peskowitz. Spinning Fantasies: Rabbis, Gender and History. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997. xiv, 249 pp. In this book, Miriam Peskowitz adds a strong voice to the chorus of those who are rethinking the ways in which the texts and artifacts of Roman-period Judaism are studied, interpreted, and transmitted. Using gender as the central category of analysis, Peskowitz presents a thoroughgoing critique of the ways scholars have constructed knowledge of this period of Late Antiquity. As she writes, "this book is about how the early rabbis used fantasies about spinning and the spinning of fantasy to make gender into sense" (p. 24). The unique contribution of this book is in the fundamental questioning of how scholars go about the business of putting rabbinic texts (mainly the Mishnah and the Tosefta) and artifacts (looms, spindles, and whorls) into contemporary discourse. Peskowitz starts by pointing out that the Mishnah and the Talmud, as classics of the</page><page sequence="2">112 BOOK REVIEWS culture, come burdened with a centuries-long tradition of how they should be read. The first step in a critical engagement with these texts is, then, "locating the contours and limitations of the available traditions for interpreting the Talmud" in order to "clear some space for other ways of reading these texts" (p. 30). The most immediate move is to rethink those discussions in the Mishnah that seem to be describing real life. There is no preexisting woman or category of women that the mishnaic texts refers to; rather, the women in the Mishnah are rabbinic constructs, "one-dimensional personae named by their legal status and their relations to men" (p. 32) and to property. This approach also forces the feminist scholar to refuse to look for proto-feminist heroes or allies amongst the sages of the Mishnah. It is a strategy that reads for ambiguity in the early rabbinic texts rather than for "truths and answers" (p. 45). Going one step further, Peskowitz demonstrates the ways in which the descriptions of labors and the regulation of labors by gender-appropriateness are also the product of rabbinic fantasies. Rather than a window into real life, the descriptions of the labors that women do, especially the focus on spinning and weaving, are "part of an Empire-wide trade in images and meanings for textile workers, women, and men" (p. 72). Roman notions of gender-respectability supplied the rabbis with the images by which to construct an idealized vision of women (e.g., as spinners) that symbolized a utopian vision of a simpler, more perfect and invented past. At the same time, the regulation of male labor, and the overlapping areas in which men and women might have labored together, provides insight into the rabbinic policing of the continuum of male desire. Rereading labor as part of the rabbinic fantasy, Peskowitz then argues that the loom itself is gendered. The Mishnah associates women exclusively with an antiquated loom technology, no longer in use by the time of the Mishnah, while men are associated with both the older and the newer technologies. This segregation by gender identified the older, less efficient, and less economically viable technology with the bodies of women and then "use[d] women and femininity to represent the old, the antique, the nostalgic" (pp. 91-92). Once again, this critical analysis of rabbinic descriptions of technology forces the reader of rabbinic texts to pay attention to the constructed and gendered nature of even those details that seem to be drawn from "real life."</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 113 Through a comparison of Proverbs 31 and the mishnaic regulation of a wife's labor and duties to her husband in M. Ketubot 5.5, Peskowitz argues that it is vital to pay attention to the histories of domesticity, and attend to the ways in which the Mishnah constitutes the wife as a household worker, rather than accept these categories as natural. In the same vein, Peskowitz argues against seeing family as "an inevitable social structure" (p. 109). Reading against modem popular and scholarly interpretations of rabbinic marriage as characterized by "fairness" and "mutual exchange," Peskowitz points to the ways that marriage is systematically unfair, with the burden of accommodation falling always on the woman. Ultimately, this book is concerned with policing our historic imagination. "Our modern ways of making the past make meaning offer no salvation and little redemption. Relations with the past are never innocent. They are always gendered, and often with ill effects" (p. 171). While Peskowitz calls for a new way of writing history that allows ambiguity and contradictions and does not rely on binary oppositions, this task is left for the future. On the whole, Peskowitz's skepticism is convincing, and her central focus on gender is welcome and refreshing. She is at her strongest in "reading in detail" (to borrow Nomi Schor's phrase) and allowing these details (and contexts) to overturn accepted and unquestioned understandings of mishnaic texts. This reader would have appreciated more such readings, as many of the chapters revolve around one or two mishnahs. The argument is weaker when the skepticism is relaxed and Peskowitz attempts (e.g., in discussing mutual exchange and marriage) to delineate a trajectory of contestation and subsequent resolution between the Mishnah and the Tosefta. This trajectory relies on a simplified view of the relations between these texts that is not warranted or argued for in the book. These, however, are minor points. This book stands as an important contribution to the field of Jewish Studies, one that will force other scholars to be more cautious, judicious, and aware in their readings of rabbinic texts and their reconstructions of Roman-period Judaism.
