<plain_text><page sequence="1">Anthony J. Saldarini. Scholastic Rabbinism: A Literary Study of the Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan. Brown Judaic Studies, no. 14. Chico, Calif.: Scholars Press, 1982. x + 161 pp. In 1975 Professor A. Saldarini published a revised version of his Yale University doctoral dissertation, The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan (Abot de Rabbi Natan): Version B (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1975), which included an introduction, translation, and commentary to this text. In the present volume, Saldarini continues his research into 'Avot de-Rabbi Natan and its place in the rabbinic corpus. After a brief introduction, he turns first to M. 'Avot, which he terms, somewhat anachronistically, "Pirke Abot" (p. 1). He intends to treat M. 'Avot along with the two versions of ADRN, since he sees these three docu- ments as essentially three versions of the same corpus. He outlines the liter- ary structure and themes of M. 'Avot. He sees it as belonging to the genre "saying collection" with affinities to biblical Wisdom literature and to the Greco-Roman "school" literature. He argues for second-century formula- tion, with further development and consolidation in the third century. Saldarini sees ADRN A and B as having essentially the same structure, with many differences within the sections. The sections may be defined as follows: (1) the chain of tradition, (2) sayings of Yohanan ben Zakkai's five disciples, (3) four chapters on the destruction of the Temple, (4) the four who entered the "garden," (5) additional sages and sayings, and, finally, (6) enumeration sayings. The chain of tradition is subjected to detailed scrutiny. Throughout his book, Saldarini is careful to study the two versions independently and then to compare them carefully to one another and to M. 'Avot. His study of the chain leads him to conclude that both versions speak to a school of rabbis and that both share the primary emphasis on Torah and its study. He agrees with J. Goldin that at times version B stresses good deeds where A stresses</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 117 Torah study. Nonetheless, he concludes that the chain, like similar Greco- Roman texts, "suggests a school setting for its origin and the establishment of teaching authority as its purpose" (p. 78). Saldarini's investigation of the Yohanan ben Zakkai material leads him to a similar conclusion. It is these sayings which pertain most directly to the school setting and which betray the greatest evidence of Greco-Roman parallels. His investigation shows that the remaining sections of the ADRN display much looser organization and editing than the first two. The two final chapters deal with literary and historical conclusions. Although we have three fixed texts now, M. 'Avot, ADRN A, and ADRN B, these texts are said by the author to have been more fluid in antiquity. At some stage, the traditions were passed down orally. For this reason, parallel materials in the three texts do not exhibit verbal identity. Whereas the text of M. 'A vot was fixed as part of the history of the redac- tion of the Mishnah, that of the two versions of ADRN developed indepen- dently. The three works, taken in their present form, betray the interests and goals of scholastic groups. A terminus ante quem can be established for ADRN in that it appears, in Saldarini's view, to be quoted in the Sheiltot in the mid-eighth century. It must be pointed out, however, that the fact that the Sheiltot quote a story in a version closer to that of ADRN than to that of the Babylonian Talmud only means that such a version of the story was in circulation. It in no way proves that it was part of a redacted text or that the author of the Sheiltot knew it as part of such a text. Indeed, the Sheiltot contain many variant ver- sions of passages in the Babylonian Talmud, and these often derive from the oral traditions prevalent in different yeshivot. Saldarini rightly rejects A. Guttman's dating of the mishnaic tractate 'Avot to ca. 300. Rather, 'Avot "took shape during the second century" (p. 140). Saldarini argues further that since the recension of 'Avot upon which the two versions of ADRN are based is different from that of M. 'Avot, "it is probable that all three variations on the tradition developed contemporane- ously in the second century" (p. 140). He sees the process as continuing into the third century. It was in this century that "substantial editing of the second century material" (p. 141) took place. In sum, then, Saldarini argues for the simultaneous development of M. 'Avot and the two versions of ADRN. He sees it as impossible to reconstruct an Ur-text, even basing it on the common elements in all three traditions, because of the oral/literary character of the material. Nonetheless, he claims that these documents attained substantially their present form by the end of the second century.</page><page sequence="3">118 BOOK REVIEWS Significant additions in terms of stories, sayings, and exegeses were added in the third century. We have summarized his discussion regarding the dating in detail, since it seems that here Saldarini has reached conclusions which are not in fact borne out by close literary analysis of the text. It is certainly true that the material in both versions of ADRN is what we usually designate as tannaitic. In using this designation we mean that it purports to be from, or is attribut- ed to sages of, the tannaitic period. Our text is then tannaitic in the same sense as are the so-called tannaitic or halakhic midrashim. Yet it is generally agreed that these texts were redacted in fifth-century Palestine. Put more simply, "tannaitic" works may have been edited in the amoraic period. Indeed, as H. Albeck argued, the Tosefta and the halakhic midrashim in their present, redacted form were unknown to the Palestinian and Baby- lonian Talmuds. Rather, the material in these collections, termed baraitot, circulated in other, preredactional forms. Since evidence points to the redac- tion of these "tannaitic" works in late amoraic times, the same possibility ought to be given serious consideration regarding the versions of ADRN. The only way to test this suggestion is to undertake a close study of the redactional characteristics of the versions of ADRN. Based on the study of selected portions of the work, it seems to this reviewer that we are dealing here with a text which shows evidence of late redaction. Often, we find that varying versions of the same baraita' are presented together, one after another. It is not uncommon to find two versions of the same statement in version A and a third in version B. The text shows evidence of post-tannaitic redaction which goes way beyond that in the Tosefta and the halakhic midrashim. The redactors of the versions of A DRN have taken the baraitot in their various versions, found in the earlier collections, often redacted in the amoraic period, and combined them into longer and certainly more loosely redacted texts. This secondary redaction, in our opinion, is typical of late editing, which is far more extensive and yet less sophisticated from a literary point of view than that found in the so-called tannaitic midrashim. We would agree with Saldarini that ADRN is indeed based on a version of 'Avot which is contemporaneous with the version found in the Mishnah. Indeed, such a version would probably predate the redaction of the Mishnah by Rabbi Judah the Prince. Yet the collection of the material in ADRN probably occurred primarily during the amoraic period, just as the halakhic midrashim and the Tosefta were collected at that time. Later, perhaps even post-talmudic, redactors were responsible for the loosely edited and poorly redacted additions to this material, whose literary seams are so clearly and</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 119 readily distinguished. The final versions, then, would be redacted in the same period as such collections as Pirke Rabbi Eliezer and the post- talmudic tractates edited by Higger. Our disagreement with Professor Saldarini regarding the dating of the final redaction of this text, as well as of its relation to the 'A vot material, in no way detracts from our appreciation of his excellent contextual analysis of the document. He has thoroughly demonstrated its literary character as well as its basic ideology. His studies will help to advance greatly the necessary reevaluation and restudy of this important and to a great extent bewildering text. Lawrence H.
