<plain_text><page sequence="1">Harry M. Orlinsky and Robert G. Bratcher. A History of Bible Translation and the North American Connection. Society of Biblical Literature Centennial Publications. Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1991. xi, 359 pp. This volume is the happy product of the cooperation between two distin- guished scholars, one in the Hebrew Bible, the other in the New Testament. Let it be pointed out at once that if any potential reader is intimidated by the somewhat forbidding title, it should be known that the book is written in a lively, often amusing style, and that its vast amount of factual information and anecdotage is engagingly presented. Nevertheless, it is a serious work of scholarship.</page><page sequence="2">170 BOOK REVIEWS An ancient midrash attributes the first translations of the Torah to the time of its revelation at Sinai, and it regards them as having been executed by God Himself in no less than three languages: Latin, Arabic, and Aramaic. The omission here of any mention of Greek is most likely to be explained by the later Jewish rejection of the Septuagint when it became the official version of the Christian community. The juxtaposition of the aforecited midrash to another, more famous, one about God having first offered the Torah to all the other peoples of the earth, who rejected it, implies an understanding that translations of the Scriptures were intended for the gentile world. Still, the first translations were made by Jews to answer the needs of Jewish communities. Of course, a translation is basically a concession to popular ignorance, and few things are as inevitable as the institutionalization of ignorance. The early translation of the Jewish Scripures into the vernacular Greek and Aramaic, testifies to the decline of a knowledge of Hebrew among the Jewish communities of Alexandria and Western Asia. The need for translations of the Christian Bible correspondingly registers a shift from Greek to Latin and then from Latin to newly developed popular European tongues when the classical languages were no longer understood. However, Jews, unlike the Church, never accorded sanctity to a translation. Only the received Hebrew text was and is sacred, authoritative, and inviolable. Furthermore, a translation, however faithful to the original language it may attempt to be, perforce freezes one particular understanding of the text. It thereby undermines its interpretive flexibility and saps its exegetical vitality. It violates a cardinal principle of rabbinic hermeneutics namely, the multiple sense of Scripture. No wonder that the religious leaders always viewed translations with suspicion. The work under review is a comprehensive survey of the history of Bible translations, with particular emphasis on the North-American contribution which is subjected to a thoroughgoing, detailed examination. It is divided into eight chapters, supplemented by an appendix on "The Canadian Connection," a bibliography of works consulted, and two indexes, one of subjects, authors, and titles, and a second of selected biblical and related passages cited in the text. Copious footnotes are provided. The chapters are arranged, more or less, in chronological order, based on Orlinsky's wellknown theory of "Four Great Ages of Bible Translation." This periodization appears to the present reviewer to be more convenient than precise. In fact, the caption is somewhat artificial, and the import of the adjective is quite unclear. The parameters of the "Ages" are given as 200 B.C.E.-the fourth century C.E., the</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 171 fourth century-1500, 1500-1960, 1960 to the present. Where then, would a lesser age fit in? The publication of the Revised Standard Version is listed as registering an intermediate stage, the harbinger of the Fourth Great Age, which is recorded as having begun on June 5, 1955 with the first session of the Jewish Publication Society's newly constituted translation committee (p. 185). The criteria for determining an "Age" are sound enough, though whether "age" is the right term is debatable. The identifying characteristics are: the receptor language, derivation from a primary version, theological bias, and philosophy of translation, that is, whether slavish literalness or "dynamic equivalency" be maintained. The authors take pains to sketch the economic, social, and political factors that contributed to the making of Bible translations. They also touch briefly on the struggle with ecclesiastical authority that the efforts entailed. This is an interesting and instructive topic in its own right, and one wishes that it had been dealt with in greater detail. The hostile reaction to the RSV on the part of Christian fundamentalist groups is described: Orthodox Jewish denunciation of the 1917 JPS translation is mentioned; but surprisingly, nothing is said about right-wing Orthodox condemnation of the new JPS English version, much of it displaying deplorable ignorance of elementary facts. The book also ignores one or two recent so-called "translations" emanating from certain Jewish circles in New York. Despite their success as a commercial enterprise, the English is abominable, the renderings are frequently untenable, and any sign of historical and linguistic expertise is non-existent. They should take their place among the many examples of quirky and eccentric "Bible translations" well documented in this history. This would add to the rich store of delightful tidbits with which the book abounds. A laudable feature of the work under review is the emphasis on the influence of Rashi, Abraham ibn Ezra, and David Qimhi upon subsequent translations of the Bible. It is to be hoped that the suggestion made on page 26 will be taken up by a competent student. Considerable space is properly devoted to the history and defining characteristics of the new JPS translation, now known as The Tanakh, a venture which Orlinsky himself initiated and to which he contributed so much. In this connection, the authors include invaluable scholarly notes on many prominent cruces in the Hebrew and Greek Bibles. Every student of the Scriptures will benefit enormously from the clear, precise, and learned expositions. This reviewer registers one critical observation concerning the</page><page sequence="4">172 BOOK REVIEWS treatment of Psalm 2:12 to which three pages are devoted (pp. 160-163). The well-known emendation nashqu be-raglaw found in the Kittel Biblia Hebraica, is unreservedly accepted. However, it has been overlooked that the Hebrew verb n-sh-q never takes the preposition b-. Significantly, this celebrated emendation has itself been "corrected" in the latest Stuttgartensia edition by replacing the be- with le-. This, though, vitiates the impact and rational of the textual argument, as everyone familiar with the issues will realize at once. But this is a minor point in a book so rich, informative, and well written as this. Nahum M. Sarna Brandeis University Waltham, Mass.</page></plain_text>
