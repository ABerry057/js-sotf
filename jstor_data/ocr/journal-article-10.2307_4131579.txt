<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vicky Caron. Uneasy Asylum: France and the Jewish Refugee Crisis, 1933-1942. Stanford Studies in Jewish History and Culture. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999. 730 pp. In this balanced and careful study, Vicki Caron examines the evolution of French policy toward central European Jewish refugees between 1933 and 1942 from three interrelated perspectives: governmental policy, public opinion, and Jewish organizational responses. For each of these themes, Professor Caron offers a comprehensive analysis and important new insights on the connections between policies and attitudes at the end of Third Republic and during the first two years of the Vichy regime, 1940-1942. In their pathfinding 1981 book, Vichy France and the Jews, Michael Marrus and Robert Paxton charged that Vichy antisemitic legislation, and apparent public support for it, logically grew out of the hardening policies and attitudes toward refugees during the 1930s. While Caron's portrayal of pre-Vichy policy and pub- lic opinion will hardly give comfort to defenders of the late Third Republic, she prefers the image of a twisted and open road. Pressed by an insistent economic campaign of middle-class pressure groups, the right-leaning Radical governments from 1933 to 1936 instigated a police crackdown on refugees. The government also placed occupational quotas on foreign artisans and implemented a ten-year wait- ing period before even naturalized citizens could practice law or medicine. Al- though not explicitly antisemitic, these measures targeted occupations practiced by Jewish refugees and reflected the attitudes of many that this "invasion" of Jew- ish refugees brought unfair and frequently corrupt competition. After two years of the Popular Front government, the right-leaning Radical 159</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review government under Daladier resumed power in 1938 and the situation of Jewish refugees again deteriorated sharply. Caron has made excellent use of the Foreign Ministry archives to show the nefarious influence of Georges Bonnet, Daladier's xenophobic and antisemitic foreign minister. Confronted with a substantial in- crease of refugees in 1938, Bonnet and Daladier implemented harsh measures to stem the flow of these "waste products" from Germany, Austria, and Poland. Through an exhaustive examination of journals and the press Caron also demon- strates that the xenophobia and antisemitism that in the early 1930s had been the reserve of the extreme right now spread to broad stretches of moderate public opin- ion. This included much of the so-called moderate clergy, which some historians have argued had become philosemitic in the 1930s. Increasingly fearful of an im- pending war and encroaching socialism and communism, many Frenchmen saw foreign Jews as warmongers and Communists. "Better Hitler than Stalin" became the popular slogan of the day. When the war broke out in September, 1939, the French government ignored the opportunity to enlist the willing refugees into the army and instead interned tens of thousands as enemy aliens in over eighty in- ternment camps. Nevertheless, Caron maintains, the path to Vichy was not direct. In early 1940, the French government, in response to foreign and domestic pres- sure, improved conditions in the camps; by May it had released all but a few thou- sand of the refugees. Tragically, the government re-interned the refugees when Germany invaded Western Europe. Caron demonstrates, however, that there was another France, mostly on the Left, that was sympathetic to the plight of the refugees. Refugee supporters mount- ed public campaigns in 1934 and 1935 defending France's tradition of asylum, and when the Left came to power in May, 1936, the Popular Front government eased restrictions and promised new hope. Caron disagrees with those scholars who have argued that the Popular Front government offered much goodwill but little practi- cal help. She maintains that the Popular Front government was unable to abrogate earlier restrictive legislation because of hostile public attitudes toward refugees and the vitriolic campaign against the Jewish Prime Minister, Leon Blum, which was organized by right-wing groups. Nevertheless, Caron demonstrates that the Popular Front government did significantly ameliorate the plight of refugees al- ready in France. She also gives high marks for Blum's efforts to circumvent pro- tectionist attitudes by promoting settlement of refugees in French colonies and in agricultural colonies in the southwest of France. Caron positions herself between those who condemn native French Jewish or- ganizations for not having helped Jewish refugees and those who argue that they did all that was feasible given public opinion, government policy, and the financial and administrative challenges resulting from the flood of refugees. Caron divides the French Jewish response into two periods: 1933 to 1936, when Jacques Hel- bronner and the Comit6 National directed and pursued a hard-line policy toward Jewish refugees; and 1936 to 1940, when the leadership-was replaced by Ray- mond-Raoul Lambert and the Comit6 d'Assistance aux Rofugids (CAR)-which supported a far more compassionate policy. For the earlier period, Caron agrees with Maurice Rajsfus's charges that the native Jewish leadership failed to provide ade- quate philanthropy and refused to press the French government for a more liberal 160</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews refugee policy. She points out that Helbronner, at that time a member of the Con- seil d'.tat and the government's representative to the League of Nations High Com- mission on Refugees, shared many of the negative stereotypes toward Jewish refugees and even pressed the government for a more restrictive refugee policy. From the beginning, however, there were native Jewish leaders and organi- zations who supported a more tolerant government policy. When the Popular Front came to power, this more liberal leadership-under the sympathetic direction of Lambert and the newly organized CAR-replaced Helbronner as the spokesper- sons for the native Jewish community. Lambert represented a younger generation of Jewish leaders who sought a more even balance between their obligations to French national interests and concerns for their Jewish compatriots. Lambert and CAR increased aid to the refugees and immigrants, helped them to find jobs, and lobbied the government to regularize the status of those already in France. After the fall of the Popular Front government, they also campaigned against the poli- cies of Daladier and Bonnet. Caron claims that by 1940 the former ideological gap between the native Jewish leadership and the Gourevitch Committee, whose leadership came from foreign Jews in France, had been substantially closed. While these chapters on the Jewish response offer a more nuanced view of the Jewish leadership than earlier scholarship, I believe that Caron underplays the degree of tension that remained between native Jews and foreign Jews. Studies on French Jewry during the Holo- caust by Jacques Adler, a moderate critic of the native leadership, and even Richard Cohen, a moderate defender, indicate that the distrust between native and foreign Jewish organizations persisted and inhibited rescue and relief efforts during the critical Vichy years. In an important final chapter Professor Caron cautions against over- simplifying the parallels between Vichy and late Third Republic policies and atti- tudes. Third Republic policies toward refugees were not primarily or overtly anti- semitic, nor did Third Republic governments place occupational quotas on native Jews. Vichy even innovated when it came to the internment camps by explicitly targeting Jews, including many legal immigrants. Even in regard to public opin- ion, where Caron finds more continuity, she carefully distinguishes Third Repub- lic opinion by pointing out that it always included strong public voices in sympa- thy with the refugees, and that even as late as the winter of 1940 majority opinion shifted in favor of more humanitarian policies. While Caron is certainly right to indicate these differences, there is a curious paradox in her mitigated defense of the Third Republic in this chapter. For Caron, the period 1933 to 1945 marked the last battle in France's long civil war that be- gan in 1789 over what kind of country it should be: a liberal, democratic, secular republic open to debate and economic modernization or an authoritarian, hierar- chical, and Christian country opposed to modernization. She maintains that since Jews had become the most prominent symbol of the first model, the Jewish Ques- tion emerged as the central theme and barometer of that identity struggle in the 1930s and 1940s. Caron places herself in the middle, between those earlier post- war defenders of French republicanism who argued that Vichy was not the real France and more recent historians and critics who point to the continuities between 161</page><page sequence="4">AJS Review the late Third Republic and Vichy. Yet, the massive weight of Caron's evidence on public opinion, and to a lesser extent on governmental policy, leads one to con- clude that France of the 1930s was gravely besieged by the forces of intolerance and reaction, if not captured by them entirely. Caron's important study shows, al- beit sometimes grudgingly, that the step from the Third Republic to Vichy, while not inevitable, was shorter than many historians have been willing to acknowledge.
