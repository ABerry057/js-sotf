"Yeinam ": sahar be-yeinam shel goyim 'al gilgulah shel ha- lakhah be-olam ha-ma'aseh. (Principles and Pressure: Jewish Trade in Gentile Wine in the Middle Ages.) Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 2003. 184 pp. Among the stranger assertions made by Werner Sombart in The Jews and Modern Capitalism was that "it can be proved with great certainty that the Jew's freedom from the evil effects of alcohol (as also from syphilis) is due to his reli- gion."' Yet, the Jewish religion, unlike Islam, never prohibited alcohol per se,2 and even when "kosher" wine-untouched by gentiles-was in short supply, beer or more potent beverages could be found by those so inclined. More to the point is S. D. Goitein's trenchant remark in the final (and posthumously published) volume of his A Mediterranean Society that "the proverbial sobriety of East European im- migrants to the United States should not be taken as inherent to the genes of the race."3 Although Maimonides in his Guide memorably described "gatherings with a view to drinking intoxicants" as "more shameful than gatherings of naked peo- ple ... who excrete in daylight sitting together," he was clearly speaking there more as philosopher than halakhist.4 In the medieval "Geniza society" in which he lived, as we learn from Goitein, all "important matters, such as sending a son overseas or promising a bequest, would be arranged at a drinking bout."5 Unfortunately, we have no Geniza for the Jews of medieval Europe, but through his stethoscope-like sensitivity to the nuances of halakhic discourse, Haym Soloveitchik brings alive for us, in his recent monograph (rooted in his 1967 mas- ter's thesis at the Hebrew University), the complex realities of a Jewish world in which the production, consumption, and especially trade of wine were central fea- 1.

In his careful treatment of the reciprocal relations between halakhah and so- cioeconomic realties, Soloveitchik follows in the pioneering footsteps of his late teacher, Jacob Katz, to whom this book, like its predecessor, is dedicated.6 He has also made excellent use of recent studies by such contemporary German scholars as Alfred Haverkamp, Annegret Holtmann, Franz Irsigler, Gerd Mentgen, and Franz- Josef Ziwes, not to mention Roger Dion's classic Histoire de la vigne et du vin en France des origines au XIXe siecle (1959). Thus, like the Jewish wine trade in the high Middle Ages, Soloveitchik's book reflects the combined efforts-sometimes cooperatively and sometimes independently-of Jews and gentiles. And, like some of the best wines of all ages, it is complex and bold, with subtle traces of acidity.7 Its complexity stems from the fact that it combines economic and agricul- tural history with the history of halakhah, and even throws in, for good measure, some homespun anthropological theorizing. And the history of medieval halakhah, as Soloveitchik has already demonstrated in previous studies, can be meaningful- ly pursued only by meticulously comparing both printed editions and manuscripts, and by seeking what he has called "the crucial angle of deflection that is necessary for any demonstration that extraneous factors were impinging on the course of im- manent developments."8 At first, in the eleventh century, the rabbis of the Rhine- land, which was famous for its wines, reluctantly permitted the acceptance of gentile wine as payment in kind, but prohibited entrepreneurial trade in what was for them (according to Soloveitchik) not only a ritually prohibited but abhorrent commodity. Abstention from such lucrative trade by Jews who lived in proximity not only to the best vineyards but to the largest river in the region was no simple matter. (Imagine modern Swiss Jews abstaining from working in the banking in- dustry on account of the biblical prohibition of taking interest on loans!) Medieval European rabbis, some of whom figure prominently in the book under review, found ways, as Soloveitchik masterfully demonstrated in an earlier study, of over- coming halakhic obstacles that stood in the way of Jews engaging in loan-bank- ing.9 When it came to trade in gentile wine, however, he now shows us that Franco-German scholars of the eleventh and twelfth centuries almost willfully ig- nored intellectual solutions that virtually beckoned, and that were later "discov- ered" by rabbis of no greater intellectual distinction. Through what he calls "the law of unintended consequences," Soloveitchik argues, the earlier reluctance of ha- lakhists to permit trade in gentile wine caused their coreligionists to became in- 6.

Note, for example, the absence from the bibliography of Abraham Grossman's Hakhmei zar- fat ha-ri'shonim (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1995) although that work contains an enormous chapter, of more than a hundred pages, devoted to Rashi and his writings. It is only fair to note, however, that Grossman's discussion of Rashi's position regarding "wine of the gentiles" (155-56) omits any refer- ence to Soloveitchik's seminal article on the subject (see next note). 8.

The boldness of the book lies not only in its broad theses on the interrelations between halakhah and economic history, but in its attempt to reveal-and take am- ple cognizance of-the distinct personalities of its dramatis personae, especially those who were members of the northern French dynasty originating with Rashi, the Jewish commentator par excellence. These include Rashi's "tempestuous" grandson, Rabbenu Tam of Ramerupt-a dazzling dialectician with a crippling writing block-and the latter's nephew (and Boswell), R. Isaac of Dampierre, whose unassuming introversion Soloveitchik, who knows a thing or two about dy- nasties, compares to that of Ri's great-grandfather (24-25). In an earlier study Soloveitchik described Rashi as resembling "more than any other figure of the [Jewish] Middle Ages ... Keats' poet, in that he seems 'to have no self, to have no identity, but to be constantly informing and filling another body.' " Rabbenu Tam, through whom flowed, according to Soloveitchik, "the imperious sense of bringing a freshly wrested vision of truth to the world," was also colorfully described there as having a "leonine personality."' Some readers of the present study may also feel that through its author flows "the imperious sense of bringing a freshly wrested vi- sion of truth to the world." This often makes for stimulating reading, but it may also be responsible for some unfortunate omissions, which will hopefully be rectified in the larger study to which this book is a prolegomenon (13, 63, 67). Soloveitchik argues, as he did already in 1978,11 that those rabbis who avoid- ed finding halakhic solutions for Jewish trade in gentile wine were influenced by such psychological factors as disgust and revulsion (32, 43, 61, 65, 80, 95, 98- 100, 102, 113-15, 118-19), especially, he now asserts, during the decades after 1096 when, following Gavin Langmuir, he sees European anti-Judaism as having become less "rational" and more "pathological" (115-18).12 He does not explain, however, why these same mental barriers did not prevent leading medieval Euro- pean rabbis (including R. Eliezer b. Nathan, who took a highly conservative stand on the question of trading in wine) from permitting not only the acceptance as pawns, but actual trade in, a range of ritual objects closely related to the "idola- trous" Christian religion-chalices, ecclesiastical garments, and candles for light- ing in church.'13 Would these objects not have aroused no less disgust than wine produced (or touched) by gentiles? Moreover, in his new book he goes a step further to assert that the Jews (or at least rabbis) of medieval Germany and northern France regarded wine touched by gentiles as virtually "taboo" (see 16, 59, 61, 63, 74-75, and especially 113- 10.

And Sig- mund Freud, in Totem and Taboo (first published in 1913), prior to setting out his own powerful theory linking taboo with emotional ambivalence, summarized the recent discussions of N. W. Thomas (in the eleventh edition of the Britannica) and the German scholar Wilhelm Wundt, who regarded the essence of taboo as the fear of demons. Soloveitchik, however, who mentions none of these worthy predeces- sors, offers his own "scientific" definition: "Separation from or aversion to some- thing beyond the degree required by a society's own rational postulates," that is, by those postulates a particular society accepts as rational (16). By this definition using a timer to listen to the radio or watch television on the Sabbath (as opposed to merely turning on the lights) would be considered taboo among modem Orthodox Jews, because the logic of using the timer to circumvent the prohibition should apply (at least in the Diaspora) to radio and television as well. Yet, the early twentieth-century scholars have stressed "the immanence of the sanction" normally attributed to the taboo. As Margaret Mead put it: "If the term is to be employed effectively in comparative discussions," it must be restricted to situations of where the prohibition implies "such inherent danger that the very act of participation will recoil upon the violator." The recoil, in Mead's view, can also be psychological, so that the term would also apply to "those aspects of behavior which are rooted in the individual personality to such a degree that they are so au- tomatic and emotionally charged that the personality suffers inevitably from their infringement."'15 Applying this to the Middle Ages we might say that a Jew who discovered that a piece of meat he ate was actually pork (or even rabbit) rather than beef might indeed have recoiled in horror, just as-to move closer in the Freudian direction- he would upon discovering that the somnolent woman with whom he had sexual relations on returning home late one night after a long trip was his sister rather than his wife. But would this have also been the reaction of a medieval French Jew on discovering that the excellent Burgundy he had just sipped had been taken from the wrong barrel, or had been poured by his new Christian servant? I think not, and I suspect that Soloveitchik would agree. If so, why the great reluctance on the part of halakhists to permit trade in gentile wine side by side with trade in chalices and ecclesiastical garments? 14. See R. R.

In his view taboos are "prohibitions of primeval antiquity, which were at some time externally imposed upon a generation of primitive men," and which "concerned activities towards which there was a strong inclination." The persistence of a taboo, he argued, indicates that "the orig- inal desire to do the prohibited thing must also persist among the tribes concerned. They must therefore have an ambivalent attitude towards their taboos." At the un- conscious level "there is nothing they would like to do more than violate them, but they are afraid to do so; they are afraid precisely because they would like to, and the fear is stronger than the desire."16 The triumph of fear over desire, and the am- bivalence which often yokes them uncomfortably together provide, I would argue, a useful perspective from which to observe developments in the history of ha- lakhah-both in the Middle Ages and more recent centuries. Jacob Katz, in his classic Exclusiveness and Tolerance, argued that the rela- tive leniency of Rabbenu Tam regarding the permissibility of trading in gentile wine in contrast to his instinctively stricter position against drinking it derived from the fear, buttressed by Talmudic sources, that drinking wine with Christians would lead to closer social and sexual ties than were desirable.17 Although Soloveitchik now takes issue with his late teacher on this matter, arguing that Rabbenu Tam and his nephew R. Isaac were simply concerned with the danger that a time-honored stricture would collapse (108-12), the question is not so much what these rabbis had reason to fear, as what the logic of taboo (as understood by Freud) would cause them to fear-namely, what they and their coreligionists most desired. Soloveit- chik has aptly quoted Keats on the elusive poet behind the poem, but there is room also to quote Shelley, who in Epipsychidion (1821) described his heart as "wrecked in that convulsion / Alternating attraction and repulsion."'8 Medieval European Jews, like their Christian neighbors, consumed, as we learn from Soloveitchik, large-and sometimes enormous-quantities of wine (37-39), which like coffee in modern times was not merely a popular beverage, but a conduit of sociability. Wine symbolized, then, the narrow line that ultimate- ly separated Jews from Christians, even if and when ties of friendship developed between them-a line, paraphrasing Freud, that there was nothing they would like to do more than cross, but which they were afraid to cross, and they were afraid "precisely because they would like to." Chalices and ecclesiastical garments, pre- cisely because they were so closely associated with an abhorrently alien religion, did not give rise to the same level of ambivalence, and therefore did not need to be 16.

But the simple sociability of sharing a bot- tle of wine with a Christian neighbor-and perhaps also his wife-was in some ways more seductive (despite, I would argue, the rise of pathological anti-Judaism), and therefore, following Freud, more frightening. By denying themselves, at great expense, more than a marginal role in the lucrative wine trade,19 the Jews of France and Germany-and especially their rabbis-allowed, Freud might say, their deep fear of intimacy with the Christian world to triumph over the dangerous desire to achieve such intimacy. I mention this only as an alternative thesis to the one Soloveitchik has ad- vanced so eloquently in his scintillating book. Perhaps in his forthcoming study he will reconsider or amplify some of the arguments he has made in this briefer one. We have reason to look forward to a work that will be not only bold and complex, but also full-bodied. Whether it will be certifiably kosher, however, is less certain.

To the many sources Soloveitchik cites on the profitability of the wine trade may be added the comments of the Franciscan friar Salimbene de Adam in the mid-thirteenth century. Passing through Auxerre, in the northern reaches of Burgundy, Salimbene, who was a native of Parma, was surprised to find that "the men of this land do not sow or reap, nor do they store anything in barns, but they send wine to Paris, because they have a river right at hand ... and they sell it for a good price, which pays entirely for their food and clothing." These comments, from Salibene's Cronica, are quoted in both George Duby, Rural Economy and Country Life in the Medieval West, trans. C. Postan (London: Ed- ward Arnold, 1968), 140, and L. K. Little, Religious Poverty and the Profit Economy in Medieval Eu- rope (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1978), two books that Soloveitchik might have added to his bibliography, which also contains, as is inevitably the case, some typographical errors. The English ti- tle of Ariel Toaff's Love, Work, and Death: Jewish Life in Medieval Umbria is garbled, and on the same page (171) the title of the German journal Aschkenas is misspelled. "Jews' College" is the correct punc- tuation of the London institution referred to on pp. 103, 173. Finally, the Oxford college referred to on p. 14 is Christ Church rather than Christ College, as fans of Brideshead Revisited might recall. 360</page></plain_text>
