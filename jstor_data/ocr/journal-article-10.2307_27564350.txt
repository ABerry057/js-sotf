<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael Stanislawski. A Murder in Lemberg: Politics, Religion, and Violence in Modern Jewish History. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2007. vi, 152 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001190 A Murder in Lemberg is Michael Stanislawski 's account of the events surrounding the poisoning of Rabbi Abraham Kohn, the progressive preacher of the Lemberg temple and the district rabbi, at the height of the 1848 revolution. The first half of the book is a summary of the historical context. The second half, devoted to the trial and its aftermath, is drawn from hitherto unknown archival material, including the appellate court file (henceforth CF). Stanislawski 's discovery of this material enables him to examine the case in greater detail and to reveal for the first time that the alleged murderer's conviction was reversed on appeal, a reversal that was upheld by the Austrian supreme court. This is a discovery and addition to the historical record for which the author should be congratulated. Unfortunately, the author has chosen to weave a tale of conspiracy and intri gue that is unsupported by the historical evidence and rests on questionable read ings of the sources, including the court file, which this reviewer has studied. Though he concedes that "technically, the murder of Abraham Kohn must remain an unsolved case" his own verdict is clear: Hersch Orenstein and Jacob Herz Bernstein conspired to murder the "Reform rabbi" because, as leaders of the Orthodox, they resented his religious innovations, and as the "chief tax farmers" of Lemberg, they resented his repeated attempts to abolish the candle and meat taxes. To this purpose, they "most likely" hired a hit man, Abraham Ber Pilpel. Orenstein and Bernstein were indicted for conspiracy to murder, together with other accomplices. Pilpel was initially found guilty of murder, but the Lemberg appellate court found that his guilt was not sufficiently proven; its reversal was upheld by the Viennese supreme court. The others received "not guilty verdicts," and their acquittals were upheld by the higher courts because of the "utter politicization of this case in reaction to the Revolution of 1848." It is "within the realm of distinct possibility" that the prosecutor and the 1.

From the author's retelling of the case, it seems that politics, religion, and money ruled the day; justice, at any rate, was not served. A careful reading of the court file, however, reveals that Orenstein and Bernstein were never even indicted, much less tried or acquitted, for murder or conspiracy to murder. As a result of pressure from the progressives, they were arrested shortly after the alleged murder and jailed for around six weeks while accusations against them were investigated. For lack of any substantial evidence, they were released on October 17, 1848.1 Moreover, there is no mention in any contemporary record, including the court file, of Orenstein and Bernstein being "tax farmers," much less the "chief tax-farmers" of the Jewish community. Orenstein was the scion of a wealthy rabbinic family. Bernstein was described as a "merchant" in a report written by the Austrian governor of Galicia, Franz Stadion.2 Several months before the alleged murder, Orenstein and Bernstein disclaimed any connection to a petition against the abolition of the candle and meat taxes.3 As for Pilpel, the author claims that "all the adult witnesses immedi ately and without hesitation" picked Pilpel out of a lineup conducted by the prosecutor Filons and that only Kohn's eight-year-old daughter did not. Yet according to the court file, only the daughter and another adult, the neighbor Esther Waitz, were involved, and both failed to identify Pilpel as the man who had entered the Kohn and Waitz kitchens.4 According to Stani slawski, Pilpel went to a barber for a haircut a few days after the alleged murder "in order to change his appearance." But according to the court file, Pilpel was led to the barbershop by the progressive Radomski, who, recognizing him, deposited him with the barber for safekeeping while he summoned the National Guard. Pilpel's subsequent haircut was not con sidered by the appellate court indicative of any criminal intent, as he did not go to the barbershop voluntarily.5 The release of Orenstein and Bernstein set off protests by the progressives that included playing Katzenmusik (discordant music) outside Filons 's home, smashing his windows, and mocking him in the press.6 Fearful for his safety, he resigned from the case. If the tone of the Austrian supreme court's decision reflects a certain antipathy to the progressives, as Stanislawski claims that it does, it need not be explained as "politically and religiously based." The pro gressives cast aspersions on the conduct of the trial from the beginning; accused the judge and prosecutors of favoritism, negligence, and accepting 1.

Stanislawski does not sufficiently appreciate the Habsburg context. For example, he asserts that the functions of a rabbi in the Austrian empire included "denouncing to the Austrian authorities any community members who departed from traditional Jewish practice, such as the observance of the Sabbath." The source cited relates to a specific incident when Kohn was rabbi in Hohenems: After repeated warnings, Kohn complained to the authorities about house renova tions performed publicly on the Sabbath by one of his wealthy congregants (public disturbance of religion constituted a criminal offense). A complaint lodged by an individual is not a "rabbinical function." Another example: Stanislawski calls the Lemberg temple "Reform," even though its charter stipulated that the service was to be conducted according to the Vienna and Prague models, without any injury to Jewish law and religion, with order and decorum, sermons in German, and a choir. The Orthodox rabbi Zvi Hirsh Chajes, in his anti-reform 1849 work, Minhat kena'ot, stated that the synagogues in Vienna, Prague, Pest, and Lemberg did not countenance any devi ation that lacked a basis in Jewish law.7 Why, then, does the author insist on the term "Reform"? Because of his assertion that Kohn abolished the requirement that women cover their hair in synagogue. Now it is well known that women of the middle and upper classes in nineteenth-century Europe rarely left their houses without a fashion able hat, certainly not to attend religious services.8 So it is unlikely that any woman sat in the Lemberg temple with her hair completely uncovered. What Kohn opposed primarily was the custom of wearing the Stirnbinde, a scarf decorated with precious stones and jewels, because of the economic burden it placed on families, as the author notes. Nor did Kohn call for the abolition of the custom of married Jewish women covering their hair "because it is also insulting to the dignity of contemporary Jewish women." What he opposed was the post-talmudic custom of women shearing their hair before marriage. Kohn never says anything like the assertion attributed to him; on the contrary, he writes that he has nothing against a married woman covering her hair as a symbol of modesty if she wishes to do so, especially if nothing is added to the talmudic prohibition and the meaning of the symbol is not forgotten. Similarly, Kohn never writes in his article on mourning customs that Polish Jews "are renowned for their backwardness and fanaticism" or that they are "bar baric" and "primitive." Kohn did maintain that certain mourning customs were inappropriate for German Jewish sensibilities and that, for the sake of religion, they ought to be abolished. But to this end, he suggested that a supreme religious authority (Ober-Religionsbeh?rde) be convened to decide on the matter, a 7. Kol sifrei Mahariz Hayut II (Jerusalem, 1958), 990-93. 8.

Despite these criticisms, A Murder in Lemberg is an engaging and provocative book that rescues from oblivion an important chapter of Galician Jewish history. It highlights such issues as the introduction of religious innovations, the clash of old versus new elites, and the involvement of the Austrian government in Jewish com munal politics, all during a period characterized by various tensions on the local and imperial levels. The book will surely stimulate further debate on these issues. Rachel Manekin University of Maryland College Park, Maryland</page></plain_text>
