<plain_text><page sequence="1">Edward Hoffman. The Way of Splendor: Jewish Mysticism and Modern Psychol ogy. Updated twenty-fifth anniversary edition. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Little field, 2007. xiii, 209 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001396 I don't recall whether I read Edward Hoffman's The Way of Splendor when it first appeared twenty-five years ago, but, like many who were searching Judaism for some spiritual sustenance in those years, I may have come across it. In many ways, this book typifies what was being published in English on Kabbalah at that time: works that were nominally influenced by Gershom Scholem's history of Jewish mysticism yet had no academic pretensions or overt attachment to the Orthodox world. They were primers for a thirsty Jewish audience, awash in generalities, and selected mystical texts deployed to show that, indeed, Kabbalah was not some occultist, medieval superstition that we had been taught in Jewish schools but contained real spiritual sustenance and worth. Hoffman's angle was that he was a student of Abraham Maslow, the founder of transpersonal psychology and creator of the "peak experience" method that became popular with the American counterculture, many of whom were also reading Aldous Huxley, Allen Ginsburg, and Ram Das and dropping acid. In short, it was a wonderful time to be alive. This review is not based on that book, but on a new and updated twenty-fifth anniversary edition. When I began to (re)read this book, I hoped for some nostalgia (maybe a flashback or two) and expected to be mildly inspired. As I read on, I came to realize how much had changed (and/or how much I had changed) and how much this book, once an essential entryway into Jewish spirituality, was now hopelessly outdated and, in fact, illustrated the naive nature of an era many of us hold so dear. The book describes Jewish mysticism as a harmonious, blissful series of deep and even humanistic observations, a doctrine that anticipates the great dis coveries of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, and much of psychology by hundreds of years. Albert Einstein is described as a "twentieth-century kabbalistpar exellence" (49). Regarding Freud's anxiety about having completed what he considered his life's work at an early age with the publication of Interpretation of Dreams in 1899, Hoffman notes, "Here again, we witness the hidden influence of the Kabba lah on one of the most important explorers of the human mind in western civiliza tion" (148), citing a story told about Rabbi Yekutiel Teitelbaum, who was alleged to have said, "Every person is allotted by heaven a term of service lasting for a certain number of years. Had he [the person in question who died young] 445</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews waited to commence his term at a more mature age, he would have enjoyed a longer life." Hoffman also implies that Jung's familiarity with Kabbalah may have influenced his theory of synchronicity and "meaningful coincidences" (147). None of this, of course, is substantiated in any way but is simply taken for granted to push the thesis that Kabbalah anticipated almost everything. It was just what our countercultural ears wanted to hear. Hoffman argues that the Kabbalah offers a vision of organicity offering a full integration of body and mind, an anti-ascetic and world-affirming view of the human condition (39, 54-60). The gnostic and neo-Platonic dimensions of Kabba lah, its dark myth of the demonic, its demonization of the Gentile and deeply dis turbing vision of women are nowhere to be found. As much as I tried to invoke a second naivete as I read on, I found myself saying that, for good or ill, too much has happened in the study of Kabbalah for this book to be taken seriously any longer. It is not that I think Heinrich Graetz was right?I do not. I think Kabbalah offers us a sometimes wonderful, often troubling, vision of the world. Its interpre tive creativity is remarkable and its daring gesture to both support and undermine rabbinism is unprecedented in Jewish literature. I am also not criticizing in principle the continued attempt by theologians to revise, reread, and reformat Kabbalah to conform to contemporary spirituality. That is something quite differ ent from an apologia that gives us a Kabbalah that seems, at least to me, almost unrecognizable. The Way of Splendor is simply too simplistic, historically unin formed, and sometimes too facile to serve as a good model in 2008. A few examples: Hoffman makes no distinction whatsoever between me dieval Kabbalah and hasidic teachings or stories. It is as if there is an uninterrupted continuum between the Zohar (thirteenth century) and the Baal Shem Tov (eigh teenth century). Even within Hasidism, we see a lack of any analytic sensitivity. Rabbi Nahman of Bratslav is cited in conjunction with Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liady (the first master of Chabad). Anyone who has read beyond the popular literature knows the vast differences between the two worldviews embodied in these two thinkers. This is not to say they cannot be compared and contrasted? it is only to say that Hoffman does not seem to recognize any of the obvious differ ences. Many of the hasidic stories used in this book seem to be taken from Martin Buber's two volume collection of hasidic tales. While, in principle, this is fine, there has been much scholarly work showing the extent to which these tales tell us more about Buber than they do about Hasidism. None of this seems to matter, which I find troubling in 2008. The term "meditation" is uncritically referred to as identical to the Hebrew term devekut (cleaving to God) without any equivocation or analysis (75), and Jewish mystics, Hoffman claims, have "always preached" the doctrine of divine contraction popularized by Luria in the sixteenth century (43). The kabbalist Rabbi Isaac Luria is said to have led a procession to the open fields outside Safed on Sabbath eve, where he sang psalms, played musical instruments, and recited the liturgical poem Lekha Dodi (124). I am not familiar with any source that states they played musical instru ments in this ritual, not to mention that Lekha Dodi was likely composed after Luria's death in 1572 and only became part of the Sabbath eve ritual in subsequent generations. 446</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews As I am not a student of psychology, transpersonal or otherwise, and I cannot attest to the accuracy or depth of Hoffman's analysis of contemporary psychology. I can only say, and this only speculatively, that the psychological part of the book seems to be embedded in the early or late 1970s and has not taken into account the more nuanced and critical dimension of this science. But all this is really beside the point. Hoffman gets to the crux of his thesis in the last few pages. He writes, To summarize, then, once the Kabbalah's abstruse symbolism is penetrated, this ancient tradition hardly appears as a hodgepodge of garbled mumbo jumbo or nonsense. To be sure its terminology is difficult and initially unfa miliar to Western ears ... yet it seems evident that the Jewish esoteric system offers a remarkable comprehensive, lucid, and consistent picture of the human mind. It is striking that in nearly all respects, the new psychology has converged on the exact portrayal of our inner make up that the Kabbalists for centuries have espoused. (170) I can essentially agree with everything here but the last sentence. To argue in 2008 that the "kabbalists" (and this term itself is problematic because it suggests there is, essentially, one Kabbalah) have anticipated all of modern psychology is a bit of a stretch. But this is essentially the problem with the book?it ahistorically and uncritically presents Kabbalah as a system that anticipates modern psychology when, in essence, the book "creates" its own synthetic version of Kabbalah made in the image of transpersonal psychology. I would not have written this review twenty-five years ago. Yet the publi cation of a twenty-fifth anniversary edition suggests at least two things. First, that the updated version sufficiently responds to scholarship between the first edition and the second. Second, that the book still has value twenty-five years later. The first condition, in this reader's opinion, has not been met. In terms of the second condition, the value of this book (other than being a primer for the newly religious or spiritual seekers) is as an artifact of a specific era, a time when syncretism was the rage, when East meets West still held some cachet. As an artifact, it is important for those who will write the history of this effervescent and creative (and naive) period. To be perfectly honest, I would likely not have been in a position to write this review had Edward Hoffman and others like him not written books like The Way of Splendor twenty-five years ago. For that, I am grateful to him and others. However, given where we are today, I must say that in terms of a substantive book about Kabbalah and psychology, The Way of Splendor has not stood the test of time.
