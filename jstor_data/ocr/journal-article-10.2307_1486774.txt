<plain_text><page sequence="1">Allan Nadler. The Faith of the Mithnagdim: Rabbinic Responses to Hasidic Rapture. Baltimore: John Hopkins University Press, 1997. 254 pp. Those interested in Lithuanian Jewish culture owe a debt of gratitude to Allen Nadler, who opens up his fine study on the Lithuanian rabbinic elite, the Mithnagdim, by noting the lack of prior scholarship on their theology and the crucial need for such studies. He focuses on R. Phinehas of Polotsk, a late-eighteenth-century Lithuanian preacher, who traveled widely in Belorussia fighting Hasidism. R. Phinehas had a close association with the Vilna Gaon for many years and was chosen for the study because "he was not an exceptionally original or innovative thinker. In Phinehas's writings we have the rather prosaic reflections of an ordinary rabbi and popular preacher of the day" (p. 10). The book focuses on R. Phinehas's polemical works, and reflects the options that the preaching of the Mithnagdim held out for the masses. Chapter 1 discusses the Vilna Gaon's objections to the Hasidic doctrine of God's immanence in physical objects. According to the GRA, one cannot dis- cuss theological positions from God's perspective, and therefore discussions</page><page sequence="2">404 BOOK REVIEWS of God's ultimate unity transcend the limits of human understanding. Nadler refutes the common mistaken notion that these epistemological limits imply that Mithnagdim envisioned a distant transcendent deity, divested religion of its experiential elements, or were opposed to Kabbalah. The Vilna Gaon was a mystical kabbalist who discussed mystical ascents, illuminations, and many paranormal religious experiences. However, he limited these supernal flights to the elite. Nadler considers R. Phinehas of Polotsk to have been the embodiment of this Mithnaged theology, which maintained a socially conservative and pessimistic doctrine toward the ability of the masses to achieve certain types of religious experiences safely. The second chapter continues this exposition by showing the opposition of the Mithnagdim to popularizing Kabbalah and teaching it to the vulgar masses. In achieving kabbalistic experiences, R. Phinehas articulated a worldview that limited cleaving to God to a post-mortem beatitude. In contrast, Nadler finds the Hasidim to have been optimistic about the inherent godliness of the material universe. The third chapter presents the Hasidic valuation of prayer over study and the Hasidic quest for ecstatic prayer, as compared to the Mithnagdic limitation of the popular prayer of the masses to a simple recitation of the words of the petitionary prayer. Chapters 4 and 5, together with Phinehas's death poem, translated in an appendix, contain the most original parts of the Mithnaged worldview and of Nadler's work, the ascetic focus on death. The Vilna Gaon, as mentioned above, opposed all forms of physical enjoyment, family life, and other distractions from learning Torah. The renowned puritanism of the Gaon inspired the Mithnagdim to take literally the rabbinic exhortation to live on bread and water, and to regard any desire for this-worldly pleasures as sinful. Accordingly, R. Phinehas, as a follower of the Gaon, preached a dualistic asceticism based on tight control of one's actions and avoidance of physical pleasure, although he censured mortification of the flesh. According to Phinehas, who here calls for an attitude similar to the contemplation of death among the Puritans or in Enlightenment thought, one should contemplate one's future death, and through it see the vanity of life. The physical world can lead only to shame and degradation, and this-worldly life gives no cause for anything but pessimism. Death offers the only means of salvation, provided that one has prepared, while still alive, to meet one's maker. The wicked ignore their deaths and are caught in the snares of human arrogance and egotistical impudence. This part of the book deserves further study to delineate the differences between the other-worldly asceticism and the</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 405 deathbed rituals found in the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century kabbalists and the role of death among Mithnaged thinkers. Nadler points out the optimism of the Vilna Gaon's unflinching belief in the beatitude available in the world-to-come, and his pessimism regarding those who did not observe the Torah and faced the horrors of reincarnation. However, the book's method of first presenting the Vilna Gaon on a topic and then presenting R. Phinehas leads to a blurring of the lines between the beatific optimism of the former and the populist pessimism of the latter. One example is sufficient; a quotation cited from the GRA, "'Very good'---this refers to death" (p. 115), is used to compare the Gaon to Phinehas on the importance of contemplating death, yet in the original the passage continues, "of the physical to allow spiritual life." The Gaon did not share R. Phinehas's focus on death; physical asceticism was sufficient to permit intellectual contemplation. The book does not distinguish clearly what Etkes termed the lamdan-hasid--the follower of the Vilna Gaon's elite path of mystical illumination and beatific optimism--from the adherent of the generally accepted pessimistic ideology. Chapters 6 and 7 deal with the educational philosophy of the Mithnagdim and the role of Torah study in their curriculum. R. Phinehas is shown to have anticipated all of R. Hayyim of Volozhin's criticisms of Hasidism by decades and to have created an ideology that supported the aristocratic assumptions of the rabbinic leadership before the onslaught of the masses. Nadler portrays the exclusive study of Talmud as restrictive compared to the optimism and expansiveness of Hasidism and Haskalah. He considers the greatness and power ascribed to Torah study by the Mithnagdim to have been "a distinctive effeteness and an intellectual snobbery" (p. 164). Similarly, their interest in medieval rationalism, rejection of supernatural faith, and educational reform, which prior scholarship wanted to make into a form of proto-Haskalah, are deemed restrictive compared to the sense of autonomy and this-worldly progress of the Enlightenment. Since the Gaon was clearly not proto-Haskalah, the comparison of R. Phinehas to the autonomous reason of the Enlightenment is unfair. Comparisons to other modern religious-education movements with a conservative agenda, like the Jesuits, would have been more productive. Mithnagdut as an ideology existed because of the strong determining influence of the Vilna Gaon and the subsequent internal struggles for self- understanding among adherents of this position. Nadler's study reminds us that even socially conservative movements are subject to their own internal dynamics and ideological struggles. Lithuanian sobriety was not solely a reactionary movement before the rise of Hasidim or the Haskalah. Today,</page><page sequence="4">406 BOOK REVIEWS two centuries after the Gaon's death, the term Mithnaged has lost its original meaning and is used to describe those inclined to choose rationalism and study over prayer, ritual, Kabbalah, or religious experience. Nevertheless, one still sometimes encounters a conservative social theory that reserves many aspects of Judaism for a rabbinic elite, recalling the original Mithnagdim and their Burkean rhetoric against the populace. Some readers of Nadler's book will find that the lack of a biographical sketch and a clear presentation of the context of R. Phinehas's work make it difficult to understand his importance. Also, when discussing social history, the work occasionally does not differentiate between eighteenth-, nineteenth-, and early twentieth-century positions. These caveats aside, Nadler has employed both critical acumen and wide erudition to produce an important work on the theology of the Mithnagdim.
