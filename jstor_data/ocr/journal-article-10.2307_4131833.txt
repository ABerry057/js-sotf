Waltham, MA; Hanover, NH: University Press of New En- gland for Brandeis University Press, 2004. xvii, 201 pp. Perhaps the best way to evaluate a book is from the perspective of its stated objectives. Are they clearly stated, and worth pursuing? Has the author met the ob- jectives he set for him/herself? What then are the objectives of An Orthodox Dreamer: Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik and Boston's Maimonides School? Correctly observing that very lit- tle has been written about R. Soloveitchik as "community architect and educator" in Boston, especially during the early years of his career, between 1932 and 1945, the author explains that the book is designed to help fill exactly this void, as the book's very title suggests. What complicates, matters, however, is that just a few lines later the author himself states, "in its more limited focus this book is about a well-known school and its leader" (p. 1), an objective reflected in the title as well. But these two ob- jectives, valuable as each separately is, are hardly identical, and this leads to a cer- tain ambiguity in the book's conception. If the book's aims are broader in focus, and primarily about an under-studied period in R. Soloveitchik's life, then we have no need to learn the lyrics of Maimonides' School Song, nor do we need consid- erable space devoted to the post-Soloveitchik era of the school, among other top- ics more appropriate to a straightforward history of the school. What we would need, however, is a more extensive discussion of R. So- loveitchik's virtual ostracism from the local Orthodox rabbinate and alienation from the Jewish community, during parts of the period under discussion, mostly relating to his views on inter-religious cooperation and the position he took on kashrut supervision. Although these matters are indeed raised in the book, they do not receive the full treatment they deserve, and of which the author is capable, be- cause of the book's "limited focus" on the Maimonides school. On the other hand, a book exclusively about the history of the Maimonides School would not have done justice to the importance of its founder, and would lack greater significance for the history of American Judaism, which a book about R. Soloveitchik un- doubtedly possesses. Despite this ambiguity in purpose, however, all told this is a very valuable book. The author is scrupulous about placing the history he examines in the broad- er context of the history of the Jewish community and trends in American and Jew- ish education. There is considerable use of archival material, including the min- utes of the school, and issues of the local Jewish newspaper, and the use of extensive interviews with alumni, faculty, and parents of students in the school. We gain fascinating insight into the role of R. Soloveitchik's wife in the life of the school, including the founding of the high school, and the personal largesse of the Soloveitchiks in supporting the school. We discover how R. Soloveitchik insisted on rigorous quality in both Jewish and general education, and how he himself sought to convince Maimonides graduates to attend college. Moreover, we learn that a surprisingly modest percentage of Maimonides' graduates attended Yeshiva University-whose central figure was R. Solovetichik himself!--which the school 194</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews seems to have believed offered an inferior education, more directed to the rabbinate than to successful careers beyond. Perhaps the most contentious features of R. Soloveitchik's Maimonides School were its coeducation and its insistence on providing equal exposure to Tal- mud for female as for male students. Unfortunately, we possess very little in the way of documentary evidence about R. Soloveitchik's actual position on these mat- ters. Were they concessions to the needs of a fragile mid-century Bostonian Or- thodoxy, or did they represent ideal modes of Jewish education in modernity? Far- ber's own discussion-he tries to be fair to all sides-cites a plethora of secondary sources, and is therefore obviously limited. Farber himself comes down on the side of the "modernists," but the argument of the "modernists" is largely ex silentio, while the argument of the "traditionalists" is based on at least anecdotal evidence, as problematic as that might be. This leads me to a larger point. The author profoundly identifies with the ideology of the school as he understands it. "During the five years that I taught at Maimonides ... its philosophy became the preoccupation of my life. I believe that all my colleagues would agree that when I left Boston in 1995 I should have re- ceived a high school diploma" (p. xv). This is a noble sentiment, but it interferes to some extent with the sobriety nec- essary for an honest assessment of the school and its founder. The book sometimes sounds, to this reader at least, like a cheerleader for the Modern Orthodoxy the au- thor takes it to represent. But the language of a school, its public relations materials and curricular goals, built to satisfy the needs of 1950s and 1960s Boston Orthodoxy does not necessarily speak directly to the ideological battles that have come to shape the Orthodoxy of the 1970s and beyond. This is a point that must not be obscured. The author contends that the book's "central argument" is "that though R. Soloveitchik founded the Maimonides School capitalizing on existing trends in the era, his leadership and vision revolutionized the American Orthodox community as a whole, in Boston and beyond" (p. 2). This reader was unconvinced that the case for this conclusion had been fully made, for reasons too involved to enter into here. But it is an argument that should be heard, and this volume makes an impor- tant, well-documented contribution to the historiography surrounding this period of American Orthodoxy and one of its most influential leaders.
