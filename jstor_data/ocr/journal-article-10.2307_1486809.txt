<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lawrence Langer. Holocaust Testimonies.: The Ruins of Memory. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1991. 216 pp. Nearly five decades after the liberation of the concentration camps, how does the Holocaust live on in people's memories? Its painful history can now only be retrieved through an act of imagination that we have come to call, paradoxically, "historical remembrance." Imagination and memory, or poetry and history, have enjoyed a dubious symbiotic relationship since the time of Aristotle's Poetics. One cannot live if totally divorced from the other, yet neither appreciates the presence of what seems to be its antithesis. Such struggle is found even in books dedicated exclusively to preserving Holocaust memory. A case in point is Lawrence Langer's Holocaust Testi- monies. Through a dissecting of survivors' videotaped testimonies, Langer discovers an unconscious movement away from horrendous facts. He asserts that the suffocating pressure of recalling Auschwitz often drives vic- tims into the sanctuary of conventional language and willful imagination. Based on the Fortunoff Video Archives for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale University, Langer's work is the first book-length study of videotapes of survivors' accounts. Such an approach to the legacy of the Third Reich had been attempted by other scholars, among them James E. Young in his Writing and Rewriting the Holocaust (1988). But what was the subject of a mere chapter in Young now grows to two hundred pages of sensitive reading and analyzing of both written and oral texts. With the same kind of deftness that he displayed in his earlier books, albeit in regard to written narratives, Langer surgically removes the interviewee's layers of membrane, exposing the naked memory that still pumps and bleeds decades after surviving the concentration camp. For instance, in the opening chapter, Langer advances the concept that</page><page sequence="2">126 BOOK REVIEWS Holocaust survivors harbor two warring memories-one deep, the other common-in order to account for the subtle changes of story, voice, pauses, and even gestures in their testimonies. The common memory, however ban- al and inadequate, serves as a stabilizing force and clings to a world-view and a self-image that are essentially benevolent. But this life-affirming pos- ture is constantly disrupted by the deep memory which wells up from the survivor's "buried self," the best example of which would be the gaze of a corpse Elie Wiesel receives when he looks into a mirror at the end of Night. Langer is right to suggest that such opposite pulls exist more visibly in oral than in written testimonies, for video narratives are "barer," devoid of writ- ing strategies that tend to veil the horrific experience. Yet the best of Holo- caust memoirs, similar to oral ones, also preserve that ambiguity of life and death, which Langer himself has explored in his other works. Langer arranges the clashes of these polarized mental states into five chapters. But the chapter titles remind me of Robert Jay Lifton's psycholo- gical studies of Hiroshima victims and Nazi doctors. The divisions are vague and repetitive. Are not "deep" memories also "anguished" ones, and does not the "buried" self indicate a "divided" self. In fact, chapters 1 and 2, on whose titles these questions are based, resemble each other so much that the same metaphor of Auschwitz as a layer of skin beneath the normal skin is used by survivors to describe both (see pp. 5, 53). For that matter, is it not true that "humiliated" memory, the title of the third chapter, bears more than a semantic similarity to "tainted" memory, that of the fourth? Con- trived in the vein of stilted psychological terms, these chapter titles do little to specify the area of discussion. Nor does reading each segment help very much in elucidating the interchangeable "memories" or "selves." This weakness reflects the difficult task of sorting through hundreds of videotapes in search of mental nuances. First of all, the massive, daunting amount of materials already poses a serious threat to any attempt at regi- mentation. Secondly, hairsplitting terms have to be devised to describe the elusive conflicts within the self. It is quite ingenious, considering the task at hand, that Langer could perceive the fine distinctions of five types of memory; however, the reader is likely to be overwhelmed by the fragmenta- tion of videotapes and lose track of the various strands of Langer's argu- ment based on, after all, similar psychological responses to the atrocity. The most enlightening aspect of the book, nonetheless, is Langer's shrewd and merciless peeling away of the "grammar of heroism." Non-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 127 survivors, including interviewers, and a number of survivors use convention- al language and metaphors, such as "pluck and guts," to offset the nihilistic force of memory. Langer cites interviews, one after the other, to invalidate this clinging to normalcy. Poised and meticulous, Langer demonstrates that the urge to live and to forget will perennially be juxtaposed with the obses- sion with death and remembrance. Langer has successfully mapped out for the reader the hidden fabric of Holocaust memory, found in the subtext of videotaped testimonies.
