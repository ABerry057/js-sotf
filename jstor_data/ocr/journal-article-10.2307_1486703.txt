<plain_text><page sequence="1">376 BOOK REVIEWS Leila Leah Bronner. From Eve to Esther: Rabbinic Reconstructions ofBiblical Women. Gender and the Biblical Tradition. Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 1994. xxii, 214 pp. The purpose of this book is best presented by the author herself at the very end of her "Conclusions" on p. 186: "The reconsideration and reinterpretation of texts is an exciting project, and I hope that this study might be taken as part of a larger trend toward looking at the women of the Bible and Talmud afresh, and that it encourages further studies in the emerging tradition of depatriarchalizing interpretation." Leila Leah Bronner seeks to contribute to the goal of assembling nonpatri- archal interpretations of some of the narratives concerning women in Hebrew Scripture by presenting and analyzing some of the materials concerning these women found in rabbinic literature. In addition to an autobiographical preface, introduction, conclusion, bibliography, and indices of names, subjects, and rabbinic references, the book contains eight chapters dealing with the follow- ing topics respectively: Eve, Serah daughter of Asher, Hannah, the ups and downs of daughterhood (Dinah daughter of Jacob, Tamar daughter of King David, the daughters of Lot, the daughters of Zelophehad, the daughter of Jephthah), harlots (Tamar and Rahab), and prophetesses. In her first chapter, "Aggadic Attitudes toward Women," Bronner points out: Deborah, Huldah and Esther ... achieved a stature unparalleled by any woman of rabbinic literature.... The preceding examples suggest that biblical literature was not as inflexibly gender-conscious regarding leadership as was the Talmud.... Moreover, there is no mention in biblical sources of anyone in authority discussing the propriety of women acting in a leadership role, as the later talmudic sages would do centuries later when discussing Deborah, Huldah, and others.... The societal and religious structure [of the rabbinic period] placed women outside the corridors of influence and power and gave them only the limited instruction they would need to function as homemakers.... Given this societal and halakhic context, it is remarkable that the aggadic treatment of biblical women who ventured beyond these circumscribed spheres was so forthcoming. (pp. 14-16) In the body of her book Bronner assembles and discusses various passages from rabbinic literature, from the Aramaic translations of Hebrew Scripture,</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 377 and even from the Zohar, some of which enhance the status, role, and alleged accomplishments of female characters in Hebrew Scripture, and some of which denigrate the status, roles and alleged accomplishments of female characters in Hebrew Scripture. Especially intriguing are the various quotations from ancient and medieval Jewish and Samaritan literature assembled in chapter 3, "Serah bat Asher: The Transformative Power of Aggadic Invention," which suggest that alongside of the tendency to denigrate biblical heroines there operated a tendency to create heroines almost out of whole cloth. Since, however, as Bronner's set of quotations shows, the treatment of Serah bat Asher as heroine was shared by early and late rabbinical literature and the fourth-century C.E. Samaritan Memar Marqah, perhaps the special treatment of Serah bat Asher derives not from imagination but from subordination to ancient oral traditions. More fundamentalist Jewish scholars would see an abundance of tradition and a minimum of imagination at the root of the rabbinic retellings of biblical narrative, while nonfundamentalist scholars tend to maximize imagination and minimize tradition. It should go without saying that for the primarily Christian audience to which the publisher of Bronner's study addresses itself, it would be most useful to know which of the exegeses and/or eisegeses quoted by Bronner could be shown to represent authentic oral traditions going back to the Israelite period and which represent simply the opinions of some Jewish leaders of late antiquity and the Middle Ages, which have no compelling interest for most students of the sacred books commonly called the Old Testament. Had Bronner chosen to examine in depth, either for any one heroine or for a group of heroines, who are the rabbis or schools of rabbis or documents or periods which tend to denigrate heroines, and who are the persons, schools, or documents which tend to enhance the image of heroines, we might have the beginnings of an historical criticism of rabbinical literature from the standpoint of patriarchalizing or nonpatriarchalizing exegesis. Such an examination of the various Targumim, the Talmudim, and the various midrashic works according to their respective provenance would be most useful for what it might be able tell us about the prehistory of patriarchal and feminist hermeneutics. Such a study might also provide historical perspective better to understand the ongoing contemporary debate as to whether the study of the status of women in the world of Hebrew Scripture is a legitimate branch of the academic study of the Bible. Unfortunately, however, Bronner's work does not in any way distinguish between individual rabbis who may have been open to depatriarchalizing</page><page sequence="3">378 BOOK REVIEWS exegesis and those who may have engaged in misogynic eisegesis of biblical narratives concerning women who achieved high status. Nor does she tell her readers very much about the relative dating of the sources she uses. It might be useful to know, for example, that the Aramaic rendering of the Early and Later Prophets, Targum Jonathan, is alleged in the Babylonian Talmud to have been composed early in the tannaitic period, and that sages quoted in Babylonian Talmud, Megillah 14b, who find difficulty with the fact that Huldah and not Jeremiah was consulted concerning the meaning of the book of the Torah found in the Temple in 622 B.C.E. belong to the early amoraic period. The worst thing about Bronner's book is that it contains assertions for which there is no textual basis. Typical is the following: "The Targum looks favorably upon Huldah's public role and explains the word bamishneh as a place of study where she instructed men in the law" (p. 175). In the end-note to this statement Bronner refers the reader to Tg. Ps-J. on 2 Kings 22. In fact Tg. Ps.-J. is the common scholarly designation of an Aramaic paraphrase of the Pentateuch from the seventh to eighth century C.E., the printed editions of which commonly attribute it to a disciple of Hillel named Jonathan ben Uzziel, the traditional author (according to Babylonian Talmud, Megillah 3a) of the Targum on 2 Kgs. 22, which is called not Ps.-J but Targum Jonathan. It would have been extremely useful for English readers had Bronner stated 2 Kgs 22:14 rather than leaving the reader to go through the Hebrew text looking for mishneh and the Aramaic Targum looking for the tradition attributed to it by Bronner. In fact, the Targum uses two words, bet 'ulpdnd ' "house of study." The Targum's interpretation is, it should be noted, a reasonable although probably an incorrect interpretation of mishneh, which can mean "place of studying (Torah)," although in its original biblical context in both 2 Kgs. 22:14 and Zeph 1:10 it means "the second (district)," and it probably designates the suburbs of the City of David which developed on the Western Hill of Jerusalem toward the close of the First Temple period.' In fact, the tradition attributed to the Targum by Bronner is found in printed editions of the medieval biblical commentary of Rashi (1040-1105 C.E.). It is absent, however, from the authoritative medieval manuscripts of his commentary. At the end of chapter 8 Bronner states, "There was no monolithic view 1.

It is abundantly clear that for Bronner, who grew up in a Hasidic home where "the [Hebrew] Bible was never taught by itself; its every word was mediated through rabbinic sources" (p. ix), a summary of what some rabbis from the beginning of the Christian era to the High Middle Ages said about biblical heroines is a natural outgrowth of her biography. It is not clear what value this collection of data has to offer the larger world of Bible scholars, Bible readers, and the just plain curious, beyond the author's making accessible in one handy volume a collection of statements, some of them philogynic and some of them misogynic, found in Jewish and Samaritan writings spanning roughly the first fifteen hundred years of the Christian era.
