The members of this new editorial board wish to acknowledge, on behalf of the entire Association for Jewish Studies, the devoted labors of their predecessors. In particular we note the efforts of Professors Lloyd P. Gartner and Nahum M. Sarna, who served as consult- ing editors for volumes VI-VIII, of Dr. Charles Berlin, who served as managing editor for volumes I-V, and of Professor Benjamin Ravid, who served as associate editor for volumes IV-VIII. Above all, we wish to single out Professor Frank Talmage for special praise and thanks. Frank Talmage single-handedly created a major new journal. His indefatigable work, his careful editing, his insistence on the highest standards - all these traits are well-known to his colleagues and amply reflected in the excellence of the journal which he edited for the first eight years of its existence. The Associa- tion for Jewish Studies and the entire Jewish scholarly world will remain indebted to Frank. The new editorial board hopes to remain faithful to the central objectives adumbrated in both theory and practice by Frank Tal- mage during the period between 1976 and 1983. To be sure, change is inevitable, and some alterations have already been introduced. The most obvious are the new semiannual schedule of publica- tion and the inclusion of reviews in the journal. Ultimately the success of the AJS Review depends upon the support of its writing and reading consti- tuency. The new editorial board must turn to the membership of the Asso- ciation for Jewish Studies - and beyond it - with requests for articles and reviews, for help in evaluating materials submitted for consideration, and for reactions to works published. We trust that the support provided to Frank Talmage and his fellow editors will prove to be our lot as well. The Board of Editors</page></plain_text>
