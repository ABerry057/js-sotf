<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rachel Heuberger. Aron Freimann und die Wissenschaft des Judentums. Tiibin- gen, Germany: Max Niemeyer Verlag, 2004. 419 pp. Bibliographers, archivists, and librarians supply the materials without which the work of historical scholars would not be possible. Yet too often, their enterprise is simply taken for granted. We forget that the vocations in which they engage possess their own history and that their most outstanding practitioners deserve remembrance when we write of the development of Jewish scholarship. At Hebrew Union College, Jacob Rader Marcus and Herbert Zafren used to give a course for graduate students on Jewish bibliography, displaying and discussing all of the classical works in the field from the seventeenth century onward. The orientation it gave the students was invaluable. Today, we have the two very helpful volumes by Shimeon Brisman-A History and Guide to Judaic Bibliography (1977) and A History and Guide to Judaic Encyclopedias and Lexicons (1987)-yet I wonder how many graduate students have looked at them carefully. 218</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Beyond all dispute, Moritz Steinschneider was the greatest of the Jewish bibliographers. He set the standard for the field, especially with his periodical Hamazkir-Hebrdische Bibliographie and his catalogue of the Hebrew books in the Bodleian Library in Oxford. Both attest to an extraordinarily detailed knowl- edge of the field, perhaps unequalled since. Most would agree that the outstanding Jewish bibliographer of the following generation was a scholar whose name is much less familiar: Aron Freimann (1871-1948). It was he who carried the Steinschneider tradition into the twentieth century while improving on the work of his master in various ways. Yet until Rachel Heuberger, who took over Freimann's position as head of the Hebraica and Judaica collection of the Frankfurt Municipal and University Library in 1991, chose to write her doctoral dissertation on the life and work of her predecessor, Freimann's significance had not been sufficiently apparent. Freimann was an Orthodox Jew, a graduate of the Rabbinerseminar in Berlin, whose lifelong passion was Jewish bibliography. His position in Frankfurt, which he held for thirty-five years, gave him daily access to the most important Judaica collection in Germany-much of it, sadly, destroyed during World War II. He not only built the collection into one of high prominence but also was able to use it for his various bibliographical projects. Like Zunz and Steinschneider, Freimann did not serve in the practical rabbinate but was one of the few German Jewish scholars able to devote himself almost exclusively to his work. His scholarly connections reached around the Jewish world and stretched beyond parties. He was proud of being a government official, his worth recognized by those to whom he was responsible in the Frankfurt library. Fortunately, the Frankfurt Jewish community contained generous Jewish donors who made possible the remarkable expansion of the collection. Beginning in 1900, Freimann coedited and then edited the successor biblio- graphical journal to that of his mentor Steinschneider, titled simply Zeitschriftfur Hebrdische Bibliographie, divesting it of the latter's frequent sarcastic comments regarding the shortcomings of other scholars. Over the years, he also produced cat- alogues and various bibliographies for manuscripts, printed works, and incunabula that continue to be useful. (In an appendix, Heuberger provides the first complete chronological listing of Freimann's published writings.) Freimann also played a significant role in the organization of Jewish scholarship in Germany. He had a hand in such major projects as the encyclopedic Germania Judaica, the revival of the Mekize Nirdamim society that published Hebrew manuscripts, the Zeitschrift fir die Geschichte der Juden in Deutschland, and the formation of the bibliophile society, Soncino-Gesellschaft. Freimann remained in Germany until he was forced to flee to the United States in 1939. During his last years in New York, he worked in the Jewish Division of the New York Public Library. Heuberger divides her study into two parts: a Freimann biography and a study of his bibliographical work, the latter presented within the context of the development of Hebraic and Jewish bibliography from its origins among Christian Hebraists of the seventeenth century. Freimann's life was by no means a closeted existence within the walls of the library. He was among the leading figures in German Jewish modern Orthodoxy during his time and the last chair of the 219</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Frankfurt Jewish community before the Holocaust. Thanks to discoveries in archives in Germany, Israel, and the United States, Heuberger has been able to provide a rich and rounded biography. Freimann's own approximately 400 scho- larly writings extend beyond bibliography to historical studies and reflect his remarkable breadth of knowledge. The author puts Freimann's life into the broad- est context (appropriate for a dissertation but perhaps less so for a published volume) so that we also get a very full account of both the development of Wis- senschaft des Judentums in Germany and the enterprise of Hebraic bibliography among Christian and Jewish scholars from Johannes Buxtorf the Elder on down to Freimann's time. This urge for completeness, which results in abundant, often lengthy and learned footnotes, makes the book valuable as a research resource unto itself, but it does require some effort to get from cover to cover. During World War II, the most valuable items in the Frankfurt Judaica and Hebraica collections, which by 1939 had grown to about 40,000 volumes, were removed for safekeeping while most of the collection was destroyed during Allied bombings. Despite the loss of the volumes themselves, the annotated Judaica catalogue that Freimann prepared continues to be a valuable biblio- graphical tool and, in the estimation of some, Freimann's most "lasting contri- bution." Heuberger has been able to find out little about Freimann's personal qualities; like many German Jews, he was a very private man. But she has re- acquainted us with a figure whose enabling contributions to the multiple enterprises of Jewish scholarship should not be overlooked. Michael A.
