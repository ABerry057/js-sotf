Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2006. xiii, 278 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001244 It is always a pleasure to read anything written by James Kugel. He writes with authority, insight, erudition, and a dash of humor. His great contribution to the field of early biblical interpretation has been to demonstrate compellingly that embellishments to the biblical narrative found in the so-called rewritten Bible literature of the Second Temple period, such as Jubilees and the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, are uniformly the product of exegesis. This means that they are not simply the fruits of the authors' imaginations?legends, to use Kugel's term?but rather the result of reading scripture closely and carefully. There are several important implications to these findings. One is that while these expanded narratives, as Kugel calls them, may have become popularized, they are originally a production of high culture, created by those capable of reading the Bible with a trained eye. A second is that rabbinic midrash is not as significant a break from earlier biblical interpretation as was previously thought. Kugel's research indicates that the difference between the way the rabbis and their predecessors engaged in midrash lies less in the realm of methodology and more in the formal and structural arena. While the writer/exegetes of the Second Temple period fuse their interpretations with the original biblical narrative, scripture and its interpretations are clearly demarcated in classical rabbinic midrash. Thus, the call by Steven Fraade to turn from the question of how the rabbis did midrash to the question of why they did it that way is given greater impetus by Kugel's conclusions, for it is in fact the manner more than the substance of midrash that is uniquely rabbinic. Kugel's latest book, The Ladder of Jacob, follows in the footsteps of his earlier work, In Potiphars Eouse. As Kugel puts it, his focus "is not so much on the what of ancient biblical interpretation ... as on the how of its development including, prominently, an attempt to untangle the interrelationship of various interpretive texts and traditions" (4). In four of the book's seven chapters?the first contains the introduction?Kugel addresses the early interpretations of four biblical narratives: Jacob at Bethel, the rape of Dinah, Reuben's sin with Bilhah, and the Judah-Tamar narrative. Chapter 5 analyzes early traditions 403</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews concerning Levi's ascent to the priesthood, while Chapter 7 offers a new reading of 4Q369, a Dead Sea Scroll fragment that has been published under the title "Prayer of Enosh"?mistakenly so, according to Kugel. Two aspects of Kugel's scholarship in this book merit particular emphasis. The first is his use of exegetical motifs?another Kugelian term?to resolve philo logical issues. According to the Testament of Levi, the brothers' offer to intermarry with the Shechemites, provided they circumcised themselves, was a sincere one. Kugel uses this datum to argue convincingly that a reading found in only one manu script of the testament, according to which Levi counseled against making such an offer, is the correct one (43?48). His reading of 4Q369, according to which the subject of the prayer is Israel rather than Enosh, and the prayer's reference to God's "firstborn" is not to some messianic figure that anticipates Jesus but rather to Israel, once again is a fine illustration of the attention one needs to pay to the exe getical elements of the Dead Sea Scrolls when attempting to interpret them. A final observation is in order. The presence of multiple and even contradic tory exegeses of particular passages in Second Temple expanded narratives? Kugel uses the jarring term "overkill" to refer to this phenomenon?demonstrates that the ubiquity of multiple interpretations in rabbinic midrash, often preceded by the term davar aher (another interpretation or alternatively), is not unique to rab binic literature. Here, once again, what is peculiar to rabbinic midrash is the pres entation of each interpretation as a discrete view. Is this indicative of a rabbinic desire to give greater recognition to the interpreter or is it done to give less auth ority to the interpretation? This question awaits further investigation.
