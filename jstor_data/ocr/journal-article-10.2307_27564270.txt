T?bingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2002. 279 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000323 In the present volume, Alexei Sivertsev adds his voice to a growing group of scholars who are attempting to go beyond and often circumvent the methodologi cal orthodoxies established by the Goodenough/Smith school during the late twentieth century. Sivertsev's study is a revision of his 2001 New York University doctoral dissertation, which was written under the direction of L. H. Schiffman, a scholar who has spearheaded and supported the reexamination of the Good enough/Smith paradigm. In this tightly argued, scholarly volume, Sivertsev examines Jewish aristo cratic households in late antique Palestine, focusing on the family of the Nesi'im, the Patriarchs. Sivertsev argues that during the third century, this family is best interpreted as "a local city-based aristocratic clan." He suggests that this clan became prominent as a result of the gradual conversion of the 180</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews national aristocracy during Second Temple times into local municipal aristocracies within the Roman province of Palaestina. The author goes on to discuss the specific functions played by Jewish aristocratic clans. These include religious, administrative, legislative, and judicial functions. In the introduction to this volume, Sivertsev discusses the historiographie context for understanding Jewish self-government in Roman Palestine and pro duces the now almost ritual discussion of rabbinic literature as a historical source. The first part of the book asks the question, "Jewish Patriarchs: Civic Mag nates or Political Leaders?" The question is discussed in three chapters. The first chapter, "Political and Civic Leadership in the Roman Near East and the For mation of the Second-Third Century Jewish Aristocracy," discusses the general problem of the ambiguity of titles in sources from the Roman Near East. The second chapter focuses on the titles Nasi and Patriarch as possible designations for Jewish civic officials, followed by the meat of the discussion: "Gamalielean 'Nesi'im': National Leaders or Local Magnates?" Not surprisingly, Sivertsev's answer to this question is that the patriarchs saw themselves as both. In his words, "Throughout the third-fifth centuries CE. the Jewish ruling elite displayed many of the essential characteristics common among the contemporary Near Eastern aristocracies as a whole. One of them was a remarkable ease with which members of leading aristocratic clans would claim (or at least imagine) for themselves royal status. In the Jewish case, patriarchal claims of Davidic pedi gree, along with regularly used royal literary imagery did the trick" (93). The second part of the book discusses "Jewish Aristocratic Households and Their Public Functions in Third-Early Fifth Century Palestine." Here Sivertsev provides chapters on "Clan-Based Public Institutions during the Second Temple Period," "Aristocratic Households and Their Functions in the Rabbinic Period," "Private Courts and Judicial System in Rabbinic Palestine," and finally, "Private Synagogues and Houses of Study in 3rd-5th Century Palestine and Their Connec tions with Aristocratic Households." In this section, as throughout the book, Sivertsev's study is thoroughly grounded in a deeply rooted sense of philology and an understanding of the secondary literature, in the instincts of a comparativist who is interested in setting Jewish culture within the broadest possible cultural context, and in a tone that is refreshingly uninterested in questions of the "status" (or nonstatus) of the Patriarchate with regard to the rabbinic community. The discussion of synagogues is exemplary for what it does not show. That is, that literary and textual remains of Palestinian synagogues are ambiguous in the extreme?if not providing negative evidence?for the types of aristocratic euge terism that Sivertsev is looking for. His discussion of rabbinic study houses is par ticularly enlightening specifically because of the prevalence of such eugeterism within that context. It is surprising that among the evidence cited, Sivertsev does not mention the lintel from Dabbura in the Golan Heights, inscribed as it is in Hebrew: Zeh bet midrasho she-laRabbi Ele'azar ha-Kappar. Though the discoverer (Dabbura is not yet excavated) suggested a relatively early date for this text?the mid-third century?my own hunch is that this inscription is two or three centuries later than the life of Eleazar ha-Qappar (a fifth-generation tannd) and reflects a hagiographie impulse. I wonder whether by the Byzantine 181</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews period, this inscription may have served not to mark the earlier bet midrasho shel Rabbi Ele 'azar ha-Kappar but to rabbanize the landscape of Byzantine Palestine (a process that quickened in subsequent centuries). Be that as it may, a mention of this fascinating artifact might have been warranted. Similarly, the "small synago gue" from Beth Shean, a building that has been tentatively identified as a study house, might have been relevant to the discussion. The third part of this study deals with the "Creation of the Bureaucratic Apparatus in the Early Byzantine Empire and the Jewish Ruling Elite." The infe licitous English of this title points to a minor problem of editing in this volume. Though he is not a native English speaker, Sivertsev has done a Herculean job of making a very complex subject accessible and even enjoyable to read. Still, one might think that in a competitive publishing environment such as now exists in Jewish studies, the publisher of a book of such formidable cost would provide the service of copyediting and that the author would not be liable for the last steps before the book is printed. This volume deserves better, and the pur chaser who must pay this exorbitant amount deserves more from the publisher. Part III discusses "Jewish Governing Structures and their Place in the Roman Near East," "The Formation of the Patriarchal Administrative Apparatus in the Fourth Century," and "The Jewish Patriarch and the Formation of the Bureaucratic Apparatus in Fourth Century Byzantine Empire." Here, as through out the volume, Sivertsev thoroughly contextualizes his sources and the living communities they reflect. Private Households and Public Politics in 3rd-5th Century Jewish Palestine is an excellent and well-argued study of the role of private households, and particu larly of the Patriarchal house, in late antique Palestine. With it, the author joins an international community of scholars who are attempting to go beyond the ques tions that bound the hands of historical research on Jewish culture in late antiquity for much of the last third of the past century in North America. Sivertsev's volume belongs in every library that collects deeply in Jewish and Roman studies. Steven Fine Yeshiva University New York, New York</page></plain_text>
