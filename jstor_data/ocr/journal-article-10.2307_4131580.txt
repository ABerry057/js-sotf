New York: New York Universi- ty Press, 1998. xvii, 366. First published in October, 1991, the Nation of Islam's anonymously au- thored The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews has spawned a veritable cottage industry of scholarship addressing its central claim that Jewish merchants "dominated" the Atlantic slave trade.' One can only wonder whether, someday soon, there may be an essay or book refuting the Farrakhanites' tract for every Jew who ever traded a slave. Eli Faber's Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade is the latest, least polemical, and arguably most important contribution to the new literature on Jews and the slave trade. An indefatigable researcher into the history of Anglo-American Jew- ry, Faber deploys his mastery of archival materials on both sides of the Atlantic to reinforce the conclusion, already reached by Jacob Rader Marcus over a quarter of a century ago, that the Jewish role in the trade was minimal. He breaks new ground by showing not only that British and American Jews were marginal play- ers in the Atlantic slave trade, but that this odious traffic did not contribute signif- icantly to the economic development of either old world or new world Jewry. Faber's focus is on Great Britain's trans-Atlantic commerce during its pre- eminent period as a slave trading power. Between the late seventeenth and early nineteenth centuries, nearly half of the almost seven million slaves transported from Africa to the Americas were carried on British ships. Faber uses Spanish and Portuguese surnames on British merchant lists to identify Sephardim. He cross- checks less distinctive patronymics against synagogue rolls, naturalization lists, testamentary records, tombstones, and genealogical studies to confirm the Jewish identity of other, often Ashkenazic families. His comprehensive samples for both 1.

From Bristol to Barbados and Nevis to Newport, the general picture that emerges amidst regional variations is of very limited Jewish participation. Jewish merchants in Great Britain were extensively involved in international trade in textiles, gold, silver, and diamonds, but not slaves. None invested in the Roy- al African Company until 1691, two decades after it was chartered. Subsequently, they preferred investing in the Bank of England and the East India Company. Jews do not seem to have been among primary owners of, or even consistent minor in- vestors in, the slave fleets of London, Bristol, and Liverpool. Overall, Jewish in- volvement in Britain's eighteenth-century slave trade was "minute in the extreme." In the western hemisphere, individual Jewish firms, such as Lindo, Aguilar &amp; Dias in Jamaica, emerged as important slave retailers during the 1780s, but they were the exception to the rule. Between 1742 and 1769, of 149,705 African slaves imported into Jamaica, only 665-four tenths of one percent-were carried on ships owned by Jews. The Jewish role in the re-export trade of so-called "refuse Negroes"-ill or infirm slaves who were rehabilitated for resale to the Spanish Main-accounted for about six percent of such slaves sales during most of the eighteenth century. Yet it was enough to foster an enduring image of Jews as the "used car dealers" of the slave trade. In terms of slave ownership, the Jewish share on Britain's Caribbean islands varied between one and two percent. In the planta- tion economy, which employed over nine-tenths of the slaves, Jewish masters were almost unknown, though Jewish traders were accused of corrupting field hands by trafficking with them in stolen goods. In the cities, Jews were as likely or even more likely to own slaves as non-Jews, but Jewish owners typically owned fewer slaves than their non-Jewish counterparts. Jewish masters were also credited with giving their slaves Saturdays off in addition to Sundays. In the mainland colonies that matured into the United States, the preeminent slaving entrepot, Newport, Rhode Island, ranked a distant fourth behind London, Liverpool, and Bristol, which sent in excess of 10,000 slave trading voyages to Africa during the eighteenth century. Jewish merchants, notably Aaron Lopez and his father-in-law, Jacob Rodrigues Rivera, were responsible for 34 of Newport's over 900 slave trading voyages-under four percent-between 1709 and 1807. Slave trading has left an indelible imprint on Lopez's reputation, but it should be borne in mind that only ten percent of his seaborne ventures involved slaves. Faber does not address the question of motivation. Given their proficiency in Spanish and Portuguese, and their network connections with the New Christians of Latin America, why did the Jewish merchants of the British Empire and the bud- ding United States fail to carve out a larger niche for themselves in the Atlantic slave trade? Were they inhibited solely by economic calculations of risk vs. reward? Or did ethical scruples also play a role? We know that by the 1780s the manumission societies of Philadelphia and New York attracted some Jewish support. Despite unanswered questions, Faber's book is a methodologically innovative, exhaustively researched case study of Jewish participation in the most important national branch of the Atlantic slave trade. Future researchers can use it as a mod- el for studying the involvement ofethno-religious groups in varied slave-trade con- 163</page><page sequence="3">AJS Review texts, with the caveat that the value of studies singling out Jews may have reached the point of diminishing returns.
