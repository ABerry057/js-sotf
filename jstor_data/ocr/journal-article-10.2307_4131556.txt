Sirraga INTRODUCTION The Sephardic community of Hamburg was founded by Portuguese conver- sos who had settled in the Hamburg area during the three decades prior to 1611. In that year, after receiving permission to form a Jewish community in Hamburg, the conversos purchased from Christian IV, king of Denmark, a tract of land near the town of Altona for use as a cemetery. During most of the time period discussed in this article, Altona was under the crown of Denmark, while Hamburg was an in- dependent Hanseatic city ruled by a senate of burghers. Today, Altona is a district of the city of Hamburg, within walking distance of the city's historic center. The Sephardic settlement in Hamburg grew in parallel with the one in Am- sterdam, nurtured in Jewish religion and culture by rabbis and other scholarly vis- itors, mostly from Italy or Amsterdam. However, apparently by the the 1650's, this growth had slowed down considerably compared to that of Amsterdam, probably because of lack of space within Hamburg, and because the countryside was en- dangered by factors such as the frequent wars of Denmark. The community con- tinued to be important until around 1697, when a large, abrupt increase in taxation by the city drove away the wealthiest members of the community.' In the eighteenth century, the Hamburg Sephardic community became prac- tically a satellite of the one in Amsterdam. It remained essentially stable in its mod- est numbers and resources until the French occupation of Hamburg during the Napoleonic Wars (1811), whose consequences severely depleted the community's resources. During the nineteenth century, most of the remaining members emigrat- ed or lost their Sephardic identity, either by marriage into the Ashkenazi commu- nity, or by abandoning Judaism. By the Nazi era, the community was very small. We thank Dr. Martje Postma for very substantial assistance in Hamburg. We are also most grate- ful to Robert Singerman, Judaica Librarian at the University of Florida in Gainesville, for invaluable help over more than ten years. We thank Prof. Rochelle Weinstein for sharing much valuable informa- tion and Rabbi Samuel Z. Fishman for important comments. In Hamburg, we also thank the Jewish community for access to the cemetery over many years, Herr Jiirgen Sielemann of the Staatsarchiv for invaluable help with primary sources, Dr. Ilse-Marie Riittgerodt-Riechmann of the Denkmalschutzamt for access to important photographs, and Prof. Dr. Monika Richarz, Prof. Dr. Ina Lorenz, and Dr. Al- ice Jankowski, of the Institutfiir die Geschichte der Deutschen Juden, for access to their institute's pho- tographs. 1.

One of their oldest cemeteries, containing the graves of notables like Jacob Emden and Jonathan Eybeschuetz, borders the Sephardic cemetery in Altona.2 Related Work on the Altona Cemetery A comprehensive history of the Hamburg Sephardic community has never been written, although important books have appeared, such as the one on the com- munity's seventeenth-century economic history by Hermann Kellenbenz.3 The main reason for the absence of a community history may be that most communi- ty records were lost in the Hamburg fire of 1842.4 Concerning the Altona cemetery, specifically, there exist several sources of information. One source is the records of the burial society, Irmandade de Guemilut Hasadim, which cover the years 1675-1760 in a very incomplete and inconsistent way.5 In 1874, two officials of the community, A. R. Rocamora and S. I. Sealtiel, listed the visible graves by name and date, assigning a sequence number to each stone.6 Another listing of graves was published by Grunwald in 2.

Amazingly, Grunwald lists as partially illegible some stones that were in perfect condition in 1999. The most comprehensive list- ing is the one contained in Alfonso Cassuto's unpublished Dissertation, which was left unfinished in 1933, the year in which the Nazis rose to power.8 Cassuto emi- grated to Portugal around that time. A detailed summary of the work done since the Second World War has been published by Rochelle Weinstein, who has worked on the Altona cemetery for roughly two decades.9 Moreover, Michael Studemund-Hal6vy has edited two books of papers on the cemetery and the community;' 0 he has also co-authored one book," has published several papers,12 and has recently published an ency- clopedic book on the cemetery.'3 Kenneth Brown has published a fair number of excerpts of Iberian literature associated with Hamburg Sephardim, including sev- eral Altona epitaphs.'4 Important information on the history of the cemetery has which are denoted by the prefix "RS".

Scope and Goals of this Article Our work, which started in 1986, has concentrated on recording and ana- lyzing epitaphic texts in the Sephardic Altona cemetery. We have recorded about 1650 epitaphs, nearly all texts extant on the cemetery grounds, many of them only fragmentary. In 1874, Rocamora and Sealtiel counted about 1806 tombstones. The difference in numbers gives a rough estimate of how many stones have been total- ly destroyed by war, vandalism, and weathering. For this article, as in a previous one,"8 we are selecting a small sample of epitaphs that illustrate the religious and cultural life of Hamburg Sephardim. In this article, the selection is limited mostly to the seventeenth century. The reasons for this limitation and other aspects of the selection are explained in the next sec- tion. Most of the selected epitaphs contain Portuguese or Hebrew poems, which we analyze in a preliminary manner in order to point out the major linguistic, lit- erary, and religious trends of the time that influenced their composition. Author- ship is not explicitly discussed, unless it is fairly evident. For the Hebrew poems, the basic references used are two well-known books by Dan Pagis19 and, in one neth Brown and Reyes Bertolin Cebridn, "Spanish, Portuguese, and Neo-Latin Poetry Written and/or Published by Seventeenth-, Eighteenth-, and Nineteenth-Century Sephardim from Hamburg and Frank- furt (2)," Sefarad, vol. 61 (2001), pp. 3-56, hereafter cited as "Spanish, Portuguese, and Neo-Latin Po- etry (2)." Like BLHS, these two articles appeared after the basic version of the current article was ac- cepted for publication. 15.

A. Brombacher on Amsterdam's Sephardic rabbi and poet, Selomoh ben David de Oliveyra (d. 1708).20 For the epitaphic texts presented in this article, we are relying exclusively on our transcriptions. If a version of an epitaphic text has been published before, this fact is indicated and explained at the appropriate point in the presentation. The un- published epitaphic texts that were copied for Cassuto's Dissertation and Grab- schriften were consulted only for a cursory comparison, which resulted in no changes to our transcriptions or analysis. We disagree with Cassuto on many epi- graphic details of the epitaphs selected for this article; moreover, Cassuto did not consider literary aspects that are important to our discussion. In this article, Portuguese epitaphic poems in seventeenth-century style are translated to modern Castilian (in addition to English), because a rendition in a modern Iberian language brings out prosodic elements without the hindrance of archaic spelling and engraving errors. Castilian is more convenient for us, and it is not irrelevant, because the style of these poems dates from a time when Por- tuguese and Castilian literature were more closely linked than now; in fact, one or more of these epitaphic poems may have been translated from Castilian. No Castil- ian version is given for the Portuguese poem from 1770, because its spelling and style are more modern.21 Pitfalls of Epigraphy Retrieving the original text of a poem from a stone inscription is a time-con- suming and highly subjective enterprise.22 The root of the problem is not just 20.

Brombacher, Hofne Zetim, Handen Vol Olijven, De poezie van Selomoh D 'Oliveyra rabbijn en leraar van de Portugese Natie in de 1 7e eeuw te Amsterdam (Handfuls of Olives, The Poet- ry of Selomoh d'Oliveyra, Rabbi and Teacher of the Portuguese Nation in the 17th Century in Ams- terdam), Ph.D. thesis, Leiden (1991), hereafter cited as Olijven. 21. The following conventions are also used in this article: (a) Following an informal tradition among historians of western Sephardic Jewry, this article spells personal names, Hebrew months, and the like in the way that they are found in traditional Portuguese documents, e.g., Isaac or Ishac instead of Yitzchak, Moseh instead of Mosheh, Tisri instead of Tishri, Tebet instead of Teveth, etc.; similarly, modern Iberian accents are often omitted from surnames of seventeenth-century Sephardim. (b) Fol- lowing Sephardic practice, the title "H.H." (he-hakham ha-shalem: the complete sage) is used at times with the names of full rabbis, i.e., persons qualified to be consulted on complicated halakic problems. (See I. S. Emmanuel, Precious Stones of the Jews of Curagao, Bloch Publishing Company, New York (1957), which is hereafter cited as Precious Stones; the abbreviation "H.H." is defined on p. 494, and hakham is explained on pp. 84 and 560. In seventeenth-century Sephardic documents and epitaphs, the title hakham is sometimes used alone even for a full rabbi.) (c) In the transcribed epitaphs, letters that appear inside parentheses "( )" are considered erroneous, and letters in brackets "[ ]" are suggested cor- rections to the text; i.e., these letters are not currently complete on the stone, as they may have eroded or maybe were not even engraved. (d) Differences in the sizes of engraved letters are often not shown in this article; moreover, spaces are inserted between words that are engraved without spacing, and en- graved punctuation marks are often omitted or rendered in a different way. 22. See, e.g., J. A. Brombacher, "Poetry on Gravestones: Poetry by the Seventeenth-Century Portuguese Rabbi Solomon de Oliveyra Found in the Jewish Cemetery at Ouderkerk aan de Amstel," in Dutch Jewish History, Proceedings of the Fourth Symposium on the History of the Jews in the Netherlands vol. 2 (Tel-Aviv 1986), Van Gorcum, Assen, The Netherlands (1989), pp. 153-165. 57</page><page sequence="6">Marian and Ramrn E Sirraga weathering and damage to the stone.23 The main problem with seventeenth-centu- ry stones is the often poor quality of Hebrew lettering, which does not make a clear distinction between somewhat similar letters. The most common ambiguities are among letters in each of the following sets: (n, n, and sometimes ri), (n, %, and sometimes an eroded a), (n, -, and sometimes 1), (a and a), and even (n and in). In many cases, the distinctive features of letters were engraved rather faintly and have eroded with time. Deciphering engraved poetry requires many hours of work to evaluate the possibilities and essentially compose a poem in the style that one expects. Clear- ly, the risk of self-deception is always present. On the other hand, quite valuable historical information would be lost, if only information that is absolutely certain is ever published. Nevertheless, we believe that publishing judgmental texts entails the responsibility to publish corrections of important errors, when these are dis- covered. Hence, an appendix is included with corrections to some major epi- graphic errors in "Episodes", our first paper on the Altona cemetery. LITERARY TEXTS IN ALTONA EPITAPHS The Altona cemetery has a surprisingly large proportion of literary compo- sitions in Hebrew. With only approximate counting, the number of seventeenth- century epitaphs containing at least a few verses in Hebrew appears to be in the order of 40-60. By contrast, the number of seventeenth-century stones with at least a few verses in Portuguese seems to be about 6-10. Accurate numbers are difficult to give, because one must distinguish between poetry and florid prose, sometimes in very brief portions of text; moreover, at times one must detect ver- sification within textual arrangements that tend to conceal the verses they contain. In the future, one may also discover records of epitaphic poetry for stones that no longer exist. The numbers given above are particularly surprising, because the number of Portuguese words on seventeenth-century tombstones appears to be at least equal to the number of Hebrew words. Moreover, most seventeenth-century tombstones, even rabbis' stones graced with extensive Hebrew poetry, contain at least a few lines of Portuguese text. Clearly, the Portuguese language was not avoided in epi- taphs, even by fairly devout persons. All numbers given in this section are based on a cursory literary classification of roughly 1650 copied epitaphs from all centuries. The relatively small number (46-70) of seventeenth-century epitaphs containing versification in any language reflects the fact that most inscriptions consist of trite epitaphic formulas filled in with names, dates, and maybe a few items of personal information. Notwithstanding the uncertainties in counting, the large proportion (at least four to one) of epitaphs 23. In Altona, many of the seventeenth-century stones are better preserved than eighteenth- or nineteenth-century stones. In fact, the nineteenth-century stones are in the poorest condition, because (a) their engraving tends to be the most superficial, (b) the stones tend to be smaller and of inferior quality, and thus more susceptible to weathering and vandalism, and (c) these stones were laid along the periphery of the cemetery, the region most damaged during the Second World War. 58</page><page sequence="7">Sephardic Epitaphs in Hamburg's Oldest Jewish Cemetery with Hebrew verses to those with Portuguese verses is not in doubt for seventeenth- century stones. For the eighteenth century, the situation is similar but not as lopsided: 40- 60 epitaphs with Hebrew verses and 6-20 with Portuguese verses, including two poems (or rhyming prose) in Castilian. The numerical spread 6-20 reflects an in- creased difficulty one encounters in distinguishing between poetry and florid prose in eighteenth-century Portuguese epitaphs. Incidentally, during this century, the proportion of Portuguese and Hebrew words in epitaphs seems to tilt in favor of Portuguese. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the languages used in the epi- taphs are almost exclusively Hebrew and Portuguese. The total number of epitaphs with mostly Castilian text is about 10-15, depending on one's perception of Castil- ian text. Isolated Castilian expressions do appear fairly often in seventeenth-cen- tury Portuguese inscriptions: a particularly frequent example is the phrase del Dio (of God), which was apparently borrowed from the Ferrara Bible, a 1553 transla- tion of the Tanakh into Castilian, whose versions were in wide use among western Sephardim.24 In the nineteenth century, there is a very clear transition to epitaph- ic formulas in German, particularly after the Napoleonic Wars. One also finds an 1838 epitaph written in French and one in English dating from 1868, shortly be- fore the closing of the cemetery around 1870. We have found no obvious versifi- cation in German, French, or English.25 The Altona cemetery may have had a larger percentage of literary texts among its Hebrew epitaphs than most other Sephardic cemeteries; however, this possibility is now probably unverifiable. The total number of Hebrew literary texts in Altona was probably smaller than the number that originally existed in larger Sephardic cemeteries, such as that of Salonika. Detailed numerical comparisons based on extant stones or epitaphic transcriptions from the past would be essen- tially meaningless, because many stones have been lost in all cemeteries, and tran- scribers of epitaphs have generally handled literary compositions in an arbitrary and unsystematic way. In fact, many transcribers probably opted for totally omit- ting, without mention, any literary composition that they could not readily repro- duce in toto, even if they copied the nonliterary part of the epitaph.26 Epitaphic transcriptions can give some indication of the geographic loca- tions in which epitaphic poetry was most cultivated by Sephardim. In the New World, a fair amount of Hebrew epitaphic poetry seems to have existed in the 24.

This rough sketch is not concerned with secondary linguistic influences, such as the occa- sional use of Dutch words or Dutch spelling in Portuguese epitaphs, or the rare use of Aramaic ex- pressions in Hebrew epitaphs. 26. E.g., BLHS often does not alert the reader to the number of Hebrew lines omitted from a given epitaph, although the existence of an omission is generally indicated; whether omitted Hebrew lines include verses is often left unstated. 59</page><page sequence="8">Marian and Ramdn F Sdrraga Sephardic cemetery of CuraQao,27 while apparently much less existed in the ceme- teries of Barbados28 and Jamaica.29 In Europe, the unpublished epitaphs of Am- sterdam30 need to be investigated for literary texts (assuming each epitaph was copied in toto). Among published epitaphs from Salonika,31 one does find a fair number of poems. We know of no lists of Sephardic epitaphic transcriptions for Bayonne, London, or Italy. At least some epitaphic poetry from North Africa has been published.32 Selection of Sample Epitaphs This article presents a selection of mostly seventeenth-century Portuguese and Hebrew epitaphs, which should convey a preliminary impression of the liter- ary and religious influences that shaped the Hamburg community during that cen- tury. The selection is necessarily lopsided because of the numbers given above; i.e., it includes some of the best Portuguese literature in Altona, but it does not even approach a representative sample of the Hebrew literature. Although Altona's He- brew poetry has a great variety of prosodic styles, the selection of Hebrew poems in this article has been limited mostly to one basic style, explained later, which is fairly typical of seventeenth-century stones. One guideline used in choosing sample epitaphs has been to focus on in- fluences from the Iberian Siglo de Oro (golden century), which is summarized be- low. Three of the four selected Portuguese epitaphs are clearly products of that pe- riod. The fourth is a 1770 poem that is totally different in style and thus helps delineate the Siglo de Oro period by contrast. Most of the selected Hebrew poems exhibit a parallel development in Hebrew of the literary devices and tastes typical of the Siglo de Oro, e.g., the penchant for succinct, emotionally restrained forms of expression, the use of paradox, etc. One long epitaph in Hebrew and Portuguese is included because it contains an elaborate emblem-riddle, a type of multilingual composition used mostly for entertainment during festive occasions, such as wed- dings, but usually not in epitaphs.33 Not surprisingly, the Hebrew poem in this epi- taph is quite different from the others in its literary style.

The next two subsections summarize some aspects of the Siglo de Oro and their importance to the Iberian and Hebrew literature of seventeenth-century Seph- ardim. The purpose is only to remind the reader of certain linguistic, literary, reli- gious, and historical circumstances that are particularly relevant for understanding seventeenth-century epitaphs in Altona. Especially important is the popularity of paradox as a literary device, and even as a view of the world, among authors of the Siglo de Oro. This world view was also suffused with pietistic symbolism, some of which was shared by Iberian Jews, Christians, and Moslems alike. The last sub- section explores reasons why Altona epitaphs have much more Hebrew than Iber- ian literature. Statements by the Sephardim themselves are used to shed light on this question. Influence of the Iberian Siglo de Oro The Iberian Siglo de Oro was a period of roughly 150 years (c. 1530-1681) in which Iberian literature flourished, influenced by Italian literary models and stimulated by the prominent role that the Iberian Peninsula played in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe. In the world of literature, the end of the period is gen- erally taken to be the death of the dramatist Calder6n de la Barca (1600-1681). More generally, events outside the Iberian Peninsula also moved Sephardic liter- ary interests away from the Siglo de Oro during the Eighteenth Century. For ex- ample, as a result of the War of Spanish Succession (1701-1714), the crown of Spain lost all its territories in Italy and Flanders and most of its influence in Eu- rope; hence, Iberian literary models became more remote and progressively less influential on Sephardim living in Italy and Northern Europe, while non-Iberian ideas and literary styles gained in influence (e.g., the controversial ideas of the French Enlightenment). During the eighteenth century, the bulk of Hebrew litera- ture in Altona epitaphs seems to evolve from a theme of confident pietism to a mor- alizing emphasis on the vanity of life, as if trying to counteract a secularization of the community; however, the significance of this evolution is not discussed here. This article focuses on the earlier seventeenth-century period and its vestiges on eighteenth-century stones. Five aspects, or historical circumstances, of the Siglo de Oro are especially important for understanding seventeenth-century Altona epitaphs: (a) the close re- lationship between Portuguese and Castilian literature during this time, (b) the great influence of Italian literary models, (c) the literary devices, particularly the affinity for paradoxes and riddles, that characterized the Siglo de Oro, (d) the me- dieval cultural syncretism among Jews, Christians, and Moslems in the Iberian Peninsula, which persisted into the Siglo de Oro, and (e) the Iberian interest in pietistic mysticism, which among Jews expressed itself as affinity for the Kabal- lah. The following paragraphs elaborate briefly on these items. Aspect (a), the closeness of Portuguese and Castilian literature, is highlighted by the fact that, during the earlier part of the Siglo de Oro, some literary figures wrote in both languages. For example, the Portuguese poet Gil Vicente (c. 1470- 61</page><page sequence="10">Marian and Ram6n F Sarraga c. 1536) composed many verses in Castilian, while the popular Castilian preacher and Dominican monk Fray Luis de Granada (1504-1588) wrote moral treatises in Portuguese.34 Between roughly 1580 and 1640, Portugal was under the crown of Spain, and hence Portuguese converso merchants and financiers developed close contacts with Spain, sometimes receiving university educations in Spain, and even settling in Spain prior to their final departure from the Iberian Peninsula.35 In the case of Hamburg Sephardim, Kellenbenz has discussed at length the importance of contacts with Spain in the areas of international commerce and diplomacy.36 Because of this background, one is not surprised to find a fair number of Castil- ian words in the Portuguese epitaphs of Altona. Aspect (b), the influence of Italian literature, was reinforced by the extensive territories that the crown of Spain controlled in Italy during the Siglo de Oro. Italy had a decisive influence, both on Iberian literature, and on Sephardic Hebrew liter- ature.37 Moreover, in sixteenth-century Italy, former conversos started to form their own Ponentini (western) communities, which were organizationally independent from the Levantini (eastern) communities of Sephardim from the Ottoman Empire and North Africa.38 Prominent Ponentini communities were founded in cities such as Venice, Livorno, and Ferrara, and the Sephardic communities of Amsterdam and Hamburg later followed the model of the Ponentini. In spite of their organizational independence, the Ponentini always maintained close contacts with the Levantini; e.g., major Amsterdam rabbis, such as Joseph Pardo (d. 1619), Ishac Uziel (d. 1622), Jacob Sasportas (c. 1610-1698), and Selomoh Ayll6n (c. 1655-1728), were Levantini who had been rabbis in Islamic countries before settling in Amsterdam. Aspect (c) entails particular stylistic and thematic preferences of the Siglo de Oro that are discernible in some Altona epitaphs. A prominent stylistic feature was a certain succinctness of expression in which a nuance of a word can have a decisive role in conveying the meaning of an expression. As a result, the reader 34. Luis de Granada and other Iberian Christian authors influenced the Sephardim of Amster- dam, as discussed in Henry Mechoulan, "The Importance of Hispanicity in Jewish Orthodoxy and Het- erodoxy in Seventeenth-Century Amsterdam," in B.

The interaction between Italian and Iberian Hebrew literature is discussed, e.g., in HIidush u-Masoret, pp. 247-355. 38. The customs and interactions among the various Jewish groups in seventeenth-century Italy are described at length in Giulio Morosini, Via della Fede, Stamparia della Sacra Congregatione de Propaganda Fide, Rome (1683). The Sephardic apostate Giulio Morosini (c. 1612-1683), formerly known as Semuel ben David Nahmias, wrote this detailed book in order to provide Catholic preachers with background information for their proselytizing efforts. 62</page><page sequence="11">Sephardic Epitaphs in Hamburg's Oldest Jewish Cemetery was required to reflect carefully on the language used. Another prominent feature was a predilection for paradox as a literary device to emphasize a concept or sen- timent. Riddles of many types were also quite popular with the reading and the- atergoing public of that period. Again, the reader was required to ponder all pos- sible associations of the language used. Poetic compositions were also subject to fairly strict rules of style prescribing the roles of sets of verses within a category of poems, e.g., in a sonnet or an octave. Some of these literary devices are quite similar to features already present in the Hebrew literature of the medieval An- dalusian period; nevertheless, the Siglo de Oro exerted an influence by subtly mod- ifying older features that it supported.39 Aspect (d) of Siglo de Oro literature flowed from the cultural syncretism that had gradually developed in the Iberian peninsula because of the close contact among Jews, Christians, and Moslems.40 On the Christian side, twentieth-century research devoted particular attention to the Castilian poetry of the monastic mys- tics Juan de la Cruz (1542-1591) and Teresa de Avila (1515-1582). Juan de la Cruz was of essentially Moorish converso lineage,41 while Teresa de Avila was of Jewish converso extraction. Her paternal grandfather, Juan Sanchez, was penanced by the Inquisition of Toledo in 1485 for "judaizing" practices.42 Syncretistic ele- ments in the works of these two authors attracted the attention of the Spanish In- quisition: Juan de la Cruz was investigated,43 and Teresa de Avila was questioned about the literary imagery she used in her religious treatises.44 The Altona epitaph of Hazan Jacob Cohen Belinfante, analyzed below, echoes a religious theme of Juan de la Cruz and Teresa de Avila. It is highly im- probable that these mystics influenced Hamburg Sephardim; however, a common general background is quite likely. For example, Inquisition records show that some conversos returning to Judaism had close relatives in the Catholic clergy and monastic orders;45 hence, a common social and cultural background is to be ex- pected. Striking examples of borrowed religious metaphors and moralizing phrase- ology are found in the Iberian literature of some Sephardic and Catholic authors from that period.46 Linguistic and thematic influences are also known to have en- 39.

Particularly strik- ing for a Jewish cemetery are the images engraved on the stones.49 Syncretism is also noticeable in the epitaphic texts. For example, in Portuguese epitaphs, the first day of the week is usually called domingo, which comes from the Latin dies do- minicus (the Lord's day), an expression that is clearly of Christian origin. Instead of domingo, the number of the day could have been used quite readily, because Portuguese uses numbers to denote weekdays, i.e., all days other than sibado (the Sabbath) and domingo; in fact, a few Altona epitaphs do give the day's number in- stead of domingo. An analogous case of insensitivity to borrowing exists even to- day among Portuguese- and Castilian-speaking Christians, who regularly use the exclamations oxald and ojald (may it be so), although these words originated from an Arabic expression that essentially says: "may Allah wish it so." The final relevant aspect (e) of the Siglo de Oro is the pietistic mysticism that characterized religious thinking in Iberian society. This background proba- bly predisposed at least some former conversos to the corresponding trend with- in Judaism, viz., the Kaballah. In fact, the Kaballah was a prominent ingredient of religious life in all seventeenth-century Sephardic communities, whether in Is- lamic countries, Italy, or Northern Europe.50 Altona epitaphs reflect some, but not all, aspects of this interest. Clearly absent are explicit references to the theosophic elements of the Kaballah; similarly, the language of amulets seems unimpor- tant.51 On the other hand, one often sees phrases that have special meanings in Kabbalistic pietism and ethics; e.g., the phrase ,n wm ('ish hai: a living man- i.e., a holy man) is common.52 Typically, Kabbalistic phrases in epitaphs refer 47.

Examples of kabbalistic allusions are presented below in connection with Hebrew epitaphs. A general source for the kabbalistic background of seventeenth-century epi- taphic terminology is the 1651 book, Sefer Nishmat IHayyim, written in defense of the immortality of the soul by one of Amsterdam's foremost Sephardic rabbis, Menasseh Ben Israel (1604-1657).54 Nishmat Hayyim does not treat some aspects of the Kaballah, such as the theosophy.55 Interestingly, the aspects omitted from Nishmat IHayyim are among the ones not mentioned explicitly in Altona epitaphs. Perhaps, both the book and the epitaphs were intended for the same type of audi- ence, i.e., former conversos, or their children, who had learned Hebrew and un- derstood basic Kabbalistic pietism (possibly by analogy with the syncretistic pietism of the Siglo de Oro) but were unfamiliar with the esoteric Kaballah. Seventeenth-Century Sephardic Literature and Moses Gideon Abudiente Throughout the seventeenth century, western Sephardim retained a high de- gree of interest in Iberian Siglo de Oro literature.56 Literary groups were formed, at least sporadically, in Amsterdam57 and Livorno,58 such as the Academia de los Sitibundos (academy of the thirsting), which performed theatrical plays of Iberian authors. In another example, the inventory of books previously owned by the de- ceased Semuel Abas of Hamburg (d. 1691), which were auctioned in Amsterdam, includes works of Calder6n de la Barca, as well as the Talmud, Midrashim, and Kabbalistic literature.59 A fair number of Iberian literary compositions of Sephardic authors have been conserved.

See, e.g., the edition: Menasseh Ben Israel, Sefer Nishmat Hayyim, (Jerusalem: Yerid ha- Sefarim, 1995), hereafter cited as Nishmat IHayyim; its relevance notwithstanding, this book contains ideas that may have been rejected even by pious Sephardim. 55.

H. Saul Levy Morteira (c. 1596-1660).62 The play was first performed in Amsterdam on Shabuoth 5384 (1624).63 One of the actors was Moses Gideon Abudiente (c. 1610-1688), who later became one of the most in- fluential Hebrew poets in seventeenth-century Hamburg.64 Although the sequence of events is not known, it is clear that Abudiente married Jesurun's daughter Sara, and that Abudiente, Jesurun, and their families eventually moved to Hamburg.65 Jesurun was buried in Altona in 1634, and Abudiente in 1688.66 Abudiente's par- ents and some siblings were also buried in Hamburg.67 Abudiente was the Sephardic Hebrew poet who was most closely associat- ed with Hamburg during the seventeenth century. All available evidence indicates that he lived there from about 1633, or earlier, until his death in 1688. Abudiente published in Hamburg a short Hebrew grammar, written in Portuguese, with the title Gramatica Hebraica [sic], which is dated 3 Elul 5393 (1633), when Abudi- ente was about 23 years old.68 This grammar includes practical tips on various items, ranging from the pronunciation of the sheva to composing Hebrew verses in an elegant style.69 Abudiente also authored a collection of 102 octaves in Hebrew named 'Avne Shoham (onyx stones).70 These octaves were composed in a refined style, quite 61.

E.g., the poems conform to Ital- ian guidelines on the role of each verse in conveying the message of an octave; in addition, they obey a fixed "quantitative-syllabic" meter (in the terminology of Pagis), which represents a compromise between Italian and Andalusian metrical forms.7" Although 'Avne Shoham was never published, it has survived in several manuscripts.72 The copy of 'Avne Shoham at the Bibliotheca Rosenthaliana was vocalized by the well-known Sephardic poet and author, David Franco Mendes (1713-1792), who admired Abudiente's style and had some of Abudiente's verses published in the well-known periodical of the Haskalah period, Ha-Me 'asef73 Franco Mendes' vocalization of 'Avne Shoham is used below as an arbitrary basis of comparison when discussing an anomalous vocalization required by the meter of an epitaphic poem. The Excellence of Hebrew: Excerpts from the Gramatica Hebraica The preface of Abudiente's Gramatica Hebraica contains several dedications by supporters, some of whom later became prominent members of Hamburg's Sephardic community. These dedications are quite revealing of the enthusiasm for the Hebrew language shared by Sephardim of various backgrounds, even conver- sos who had been educated as Christians. This enthusiasm helps explain the promi- nence of Hebrew literature in Altona epitaphs. Some excerpts from the dedications are presented below, together with summaries of the authors' backgrounds.74 The first excerpt is an epigram in Latin by the physician, Jacob Rosales (c. 1590-c. 1662). The epigram follows a lengthy poem, also in Latin, that is not in- cluded here.'" Kellenbenz has pointed out that Rosales, alias Manuel Bocarro Frances, had an excellent education for his time.76 He studied in a Jesuit school in Lisbon and later attended the universities of Coimbra, Alcali de Henares, and Montpellier. He signed the 1652 consolidation document of the Hamburg syna- gogues,77 but he left Hamburg shortly thereafter. The epigram reads78: Hic docet in Lingua proprioq[ue] idiomate Moses Linguam coelestis, dictaq[ue] sancta Chori: Jerusalem, and Oxford University. Although the introduction to 'Avne Shoham mentions 102 octaves, two octaves are essentially repetitions. For further information on the manuscript versions of 'Avne Shoham, see "Abudiente and His Literary Creation." 71. See Hidush u-Masoret, pp. 294-299; however, Pagis' analysis of Italian innovations might not apply to Abudiente's poetry in every detail. This article does not consider such issues. 72.

After Daniel's poem is the following poem (which is read down the columns) by a Joseph Frances:83 Entre as chamas corruscantes Nos 9elestes orizontes, Tremulos os firmes montes Humildemente arrogantes. Nos foi dada a ley; mas antes Que a communique Moss e Porque com arte nos de Luz de seus pontos altivos Nos soberanos archivos Profundos misterios, ve.

Mas neste horror de Babel Em vez do em Sinay; permitte Deos, que esta arte facilite Quanto o Galut difficulta E o que de Mosseh sepulta Outro Mosseh resqucite. This poem by Joseph Frances explicitly refers to the Kaballah in line two of the second column.84 It also makes an implicit reference to cabalistic concepts in the phrase Luz de seuspontos altivos (light from its lofty points). The poem has two oxymorons that reflect how common a literary device oxymorons had become in Iberian literature. The first one, Tremulos os firmes montes (the firm mountains trembling) fits well in the context, but the second one, Humildemente arrogantes (humbly arrogant), seems rather forced. In each column, the rhyme is abbaa ccddc. The last dedicatory poem is a sonnet by Ishac Abas, which ends with a line that is typical of Siglo de Oro literature: Titulo adquirireis de Apolo Hebreyo (you (a living being that talks), it is well shown (this fact clearly shows) that language is a mirror of the heart, an image of the mind, with which by means of discourse, as if with a fine brush, the loftiest con- cepts of the soul are painted in a live portrait. Now, how many karats of superiority does the holy tongue have over the rest, in (its) mystery (capacity to express divine mystery), in (its) excellence, in (its) con- ciseness, and in (its) signification (power of expression), may he judge (this) who has (at least) a small notion of it (the holy tongue). And so that it can be exercised with all (its) perfections, it is opportune that it be (exercised) using rules of grammar. And since up to now we lack one (a grammar) in our lan- guage, we must give thanks to R. Moses Gideon. ...

This poem appeared also in "Spanish, Portuguese, and Neo-Latin Poetry (1)," p. 26. The poem's author is probably the Joseph Frances who was called "el Camoens de Hamburgo."

Poem by Joseph Frances: Amid coruscating flames / in the celestial horizons, / as the firm mountains trembled, / humbly arrogant, / the Law was given to us; yet before / Moses transmits it, he sees / profound mysteries / in the archives of the Sovereign, / (shown to him) so that he may give us, artfully, / light from its lofty points. // Israel was receiving / a doctrine cabalistic, / now (given) to us, as it were, clandestinely, / in (our) cruel captivity. / Yet in this horror of Babylon, / instead of the case on Sinai, God allows / that this art (the cultivation of Hebrew) should facilitate / all that which the Galut (exile) makes difficult. / And that (gift) of Moses, which (the Galut) buries, / may another Moses (Abu- diente) raise to life. // (The slashes indicate roughly where the Portuguese lines end, and double slash- es indicate the end of a column. However, the word order has been changed, especially in lines 6-10, in order to make the poem more intelligible in English; moreover, the puntuation of the Portuguese text has been ignored.) 69</page><page sequence="18">Marian and Ram6n E Sarraga will acquire the title, "a Hebrew Apollo").85 Such a title is quite typical of the Re- naissance and the Baroque, yet quite contrary to the spirit of the Talmud. The Altona cemetery has tombs that could be the graves of some of the men who endorsed Abudiente's Gramatica. Dr. Baruch Namias is almost certainly the one buried in RS1122 with date 15 Sebat 5444 (1684). Joseph Frances could be the one buried in RS855 with date 1 Nisan 5441 (1681),86 and Ishac Abas could be the one buried in RS494 with the partially legible date [6] Tamuz 54[05] (16[45]). The dates for Baruch Namias and Joseph Frances suggest that these men were roughly of the same age as Moses Gideon Abudiente. These endorsements indicate why Hebrew appears often in Altona epitaphs and why Hebrew literary compositions are not rare in these epitaphs. First, the widespread use of Hebrew must have resulted from the central role that Hebrew played in the religious thinking of an influential core of community members. Sec- ond, since Hamburg's former conversos valued literature in general, they natural- ly fostered a literary use of their most cherished religious language. Hence, the oc- currence of Hebrew literature is understandable; however, the rather small proportion of Portuguese literary compositions is not fully explained. In particu- lar, it is remarkable that the ratio of literary over nonliterary epitaphs is much smaller in Portuguese than in Hebrew. Perhaps future research will shed light on this question. EPITAPHS MAINLY IN PORTUGUESE The first three Portuguese epitaphs presented below, those of Jacob Alves de Vargas (1622), Sara Miriam Senior Coronel (1635), and Jacob Cohen Belinfante (1761), clearly show the influence of the Siglo de Oro, e.g., in their concise forms of expression and in the use of paradox within the poem for Cohen Belinfante. No claim is being made that these epitaphs are great works of literature, although they contain probably the best Siglo de Oro Portuguese poems in Altona. As noted be- low, the conciseness of Siglo de Oro style sometimes leads to difficulties of inter- pretation. By contrast, the fourth epitaph, that of Rachel Hana Abudiente (1770), be- longs to the period of Romanticism in literature. It is included here to highlight the differences between Siglo de Oro epitaphs and those of other periods. Jacob Alves de Vargas The first sample epitaph contains simple moral maxims and terse expres- sions of praise for the deceased, Jacob Alves (Alvares) de Vargas. The inscription was chiseled on a flat tombstone of great size (probably the most massive flat stone in the cemetery); the stone has two engraved numbers: 36 and 37. The spelling of Portuguese words is quite bad and inconsistent. For exam- 85. The poem by Ishac Abas is found in "Spanish, Portuguese, and Neo-Latin Poetry (1)," p. 27. 86.

In particular, almost every letter "H" is chiseled as a "K", and words are not separated from each other on the stone. The "C" is not distinguished from the "C". The transcription below shows many of the engraving errors, except some that would be extremely confusing to the reader. The Castil- ian text adjacent to the verses serves in part as a pointer to engraving errors at their locations in the text. The verses have seven to nine syllables per line. (Two adja- cent vowels may count as one syllable.) The rhyme is aabba cddcd deded. By contrast, the engraving of the Hebrew epitaph is much better. The He- brew text has no poetry, only a standard text and a scriptural quote. The phrase niii nayn nx (this is the monument of the grave of... ) is a standard initial for- mula for Sephardic Hebrew epitaphs in Altona during the first half of the seven- teenth century. Afterwards, the nxT (this) is dropped. The abbreviation a"s (C1ipa nn: here is buried), which is quite common in Ashkenazi epitaphs, is almost never used on Sephardic stones: it appears in at most a handful of the approximately 1650 in- scriptions we have copied.

(c) The "D" in "DO MAO" (stanza two, line four) may have an "E" engraved within the letter "D", as if the intended expression had been the quasi-Castilian form "DE O MAO;" similarly, a bias towards Castilian orthography may explain the phrase "EN HO CORACAO" (in the heart-stanza three, line two), unless the reading should be "E NHO CORACAO" (and in the heart), with "NHO" as a variant of the standard "NO". The phrase amor maior que honestidade (a love greater than decorum: stan- za three, lines 2-3) may mean that Alves de Vargas gave assistance to certain per- sons even at the risk of evil gossip. This type of explanation avoids interpretations that question the character of Alves de Vargas. Disparaging remarks on the con- duct of the deceased would be uncharacteristic of Altona epitaphs. The engraved "HOSPICOS" (stanza three, last line) could be explained as a spelling error for os ricos (the wealthy), but closeness to the wealthy is not a no- table virtue. Another possible reading is ospicds (the drunks); however, "closeness to drunks" suggests negative implications that seem out of context. The most prob- 87.

In line two of the Hebrew epitaph, the anomalous vocalization .'nY is used to preserve the meter; a precedent for this type of anomaly is found, e.g., in poem 41 of 'Avne Shoham. In both the Hebrew and Portuguese texts,89 the phrase "Miriam's well" al- ludes to the death of Miriam, the sister of Moses (Num. 20:1-2), as explained in the Talmud (Taan. 9a): " ixin pntnoi a'n rnn... Oanr1 ninr i"n (a well because of Miriam's merit ... [when] Miriam died, the well was taken up). Therefore, the well symbolizes, first of all, the benefits that Sara Miriam used to bring to her family before her death. Moreover, cabalistic literature mentions Miriam's well as still available to special persons, such as Haim Vital, who drink from it in order to un- derstand the secrets of the Kaballah.90 Analogously, the source of Sara Miriam's life has not ceased to exist with her death. This point is elaborated by the rest of the Portuguese text. In the Portuguese phrase "O ETERYO TAL," the word "TAL" does not have the usual meaning of tal in Portuguese or Castilian (e.g., un hombre tal = such a man). Here "TAL" is the Hebrew word for dew (5u), which is associated with the resurrection by the traditional exegesis of several biblical verses, particularly Is. 26:19: ... ."15 n.ilx.5 uv ,- ~3? ,y -a -to . -a p .. . ( .. . awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust, for Thy dew is a dew of lights ... ). The biblical phrase "dew of lights" explains the epitaphic expression "ETERYO TAL" (ethereal dew), where an adjective derived from classical Greek (ethereal) is used to denote a biblical con- cept-a device typical of Renaissance and Baroque literature. The Portuguese poem for Sara Miriam Senior Coronel has interesting simi- larities with the poem by Joseph Frances that was included earlier among the ex- 89. Epitaph of Sara Miriam Senior Coronel: Hebrew: Here is the end for every lord and lady; / here they leave behind their ornament and the glory of their beauty; / here is hidden the life of Sara's years (cf. Gen. 23:1); / therefore, you may call my name: "Miriam's well." And Sara died / on the sec- ond day of Pesach (16 Nisan) of the year 395 (1635), / in the shortened form (of the date). Portuguese: Here, where vanity is finished, / the Lord's domain commanded it, and may They have glory; / here Sara Miriam was buried; / from here she went to enjoy the eternal glory. / I will be called Miriam's well; / here my name remains as a memory; / here, cut down as a flower, I will be (made) new, / when the ethereal dew rains over me. // Grave of Sara Miriam / Senior Coronel; and Our Lord called her / for Himself at the age of 25 / years on 4 April 1635. // Here rests the blessed memory / of Mrs. Sara Miriam Senior Coronel, cut down before her time, wife that / she was of Isaac Senior / Coronel, whom God called on the 2nd day of Pesach, year 5395.

For example, both poems use Hebrew words inside Portuguese text (viz., tal and galut), and both contain similar styles of pietis- tic allusions. The Portuguese Epitaph of Hazan Jacob Cohen Belinfante The two Portuguese stanzas presented below are an excellent example of Siglo de Oro literature, although they were engraved on the much later (1761) tombstone of Hazan Jacob Cohen Belinfante.91 Future research may well show that these stanzas were copied from some earlier Siglo de Oro composition, which could have been written in Castilian as well as Portuguese, since the syllable count (seven per line) and the rhyme are the same in both languages. RS873-Hazan Jacob, son of Joseph Cohen Belinfante (24 Nisan 5521 / 1761) (Portuguese epitaph only) TAO BEM ESTO[U] COM MEU MAL DESPOIS QUE PERDI MEU BEM QUE O BEM ME PARECE MAL E O MAL ME PARECE BEM A DITTA DE MERECER NAO A PUDE BEM LOGRAR SEM PRIMEIRO PADECER A CABO DE BEM PENAR Tan bien estoy con mi mal despuds que perdi mi bien; que el bien me parece mal y el mal me parece bien. La dicha de merecer no la pude bien lograr sin primero padecer, a cabo de bien penar. In the first line, the "U" added in "ESTO[U]" was definitely never engraved on the stone92; however, the message of the two stanzas flows better, if one makes this addition.93 In this message, Belinfante tells the reader that his reward after death is so good that having undergone death seems like good fortune to him; on the other hand, those who appear to have good fortune-because they are still physically alive-seem unfortunate to Belinfante, because they are missing the type of reward that he has. This message is conveyed, in a fashion typical of the Siglo de Oro, by means of a paradox, viz., "O BEM ME PARECE MAL E O MAL ME PARECE BEM" (good fortune seems bad to me, and bad fortune seems good to me). The paradox is reminiscent of the well-known oxymoron of the mystics Juan de la Cruz and 91. See "Episodes" pp. 694-696, and compare the subsequent version in Betahaim, p. 70; see also "Spanish, Portuguese, and Neo-Latin Poetry (1)," p. 13, and BLHS, pp. 268-269. 92. Portuguese epitaph of Jacob Cohen Belinfante: I am so well off with my misfortune, / af- ter I lost my good fortune, / that good fortune seems like misfortune to me, / and misfortune seems like good fortune to me. / The joy of deserving, / I could not really achieve it / without first suffering, / as a result of suffering well. 93. We are indebted to an anonymous lector of AJS Review for pointing out this correction. The same correction was made in Betahaim, p. 70; however, the rest of that translation differs from the one presented here. In the translation of "Episodes", pp. 694-696, we missed the probable "ESTO[U]" and assumed "TAO BEM" meant tambnm, since both expressions were often written as ta6 bem [sic] in seventeenth-century Sephardic documents. 75</page><page sequence="24">Marian and Ram6n F Sirraga Teresa de Avila, muero porque no muero (I die because I do not die).94 The antiq- uity of this sentiment is shown by a twelfth-century poem of Judah Halevi,95 which says to the Lord: m'in n "rn Iwn i u pa7! ,n xn qe p -inr (if I am far from Thee, my death is in my life, and if I adhere to Thee, my life is in my death). The verses of Judah Halevi provide the general sense of the paradox con- tained in the clause: "O BEM ME PARECE MAL E O MAL ME PARECE BEM." The second stanza of the epitaph also explains this sense; i.e., bad fortune seemed like good fortune, because suffering led to the joy of deserving the world to come. Incidentally, the paradox "O BEM... " also has the interpretation that the author's life had become so wretched that he was happy to die and escape his suffering. Even if the author of the epitaph intended this interpretation as a secondary mean- ing, the last stanza imposes a primary religious interpretation. Recall that the ac- ceptance of suffering in order to achieve joy is also echoed in the 1622 epitaph of Jacob Alves de Vargas: "SE DO MONDO QVER VICTORIAI / SAIBA SOFRER E CALLAR" (if he wants victory over the world, he should know how to suffer and keep quiet). Rachel Hana Abudiente The 1770 epitaph shown below96 contains a Portuguese poem whose mode of expression is definitely uncharacteristic of the Siglo de Oro and fits much bet- ter in the period of Romanticism. Typical of this period is the melancholy manner in which this poem dwells on the impression of the young woman's breath, her live- liness, and the contrast with the still image imposed by death. Well-known literary devices of the Siglo de Oro, such as paradox, are missing. The Portuguese poem consists of ten verses with basically eight syllables apiece and rhyme abbaa ccddc.

Both Juan de la Cruz and Teresa de Avila introduce their poems, which are different from each other, with the same words: Vivo sin vivir en mi y de tal manera espero, que muero porque no muero (I live without living in myself, and I am hopeful to such a degree, that I die because I do not die). Note the subtleties in both the similarities and the differences between these words and the verses of Judah Halevi that follow in the main text. 95.

As a general rule, sev- enteenth-century epitaphs rely more on the perspicacity of the reader. Incidental- ly, the stone lacks some of the tildes shown above to mark the gematria letters of the date 530; nevertheless, the gematria letters were engraved larger than the rest, and hence there is no ambiguity. This eighteenth-century inscription contains substantially more punctuation marks than the norm on seventeenth-century stones. In general, more recent Al- tona epitaphs show increasing concern with punctuation, especially in the non- Hebrew text. A detailed discussion of this feature and its ramifications (e.g., the intrusion of German punctuation) is beyond the scope of this article. Moreover, punctuation marks are not reproduced exactly in this article. 97. Epitaph of Rachel Hana Abudiente: Hebrew: It is / the monument of the grave of Rachel to this day (Gen. 35:20). // Behold it is speaking to the eye of the reader: / (even) if (as regards) the body, its foundation is in my chamber, / yet the soul I throw aside (1 Sam. 20:20) to the light of life, / and behold Rachel is in the shadow of the Almighty, the Creator. / She departed to her eternal house on the day of the eve of the holy Sabbath, 2nd of the month lyar, / in the seder and parashah: "and on being completed the days of her purification" (Lev. 12:6): 530 by gematria of the letters marked by tildes.

In lines two and three of the Portuguese poem, JA is engraved on the stone instead of jd (now, already); more- over, the tilde on the stone is the mirror image of the modem tilde used here. In line four, there is no accent, at this time, on the engraved JA. EPITAPHS PRINCIPALLY IN HEBREW The first two Hebrew epitaphs in this section are not poems but examples of eccentric texts. The 1658 epitaph of Ishac de Jacob Cohen Lobato was written to- tally in Aramaic but following a common Hebrew pattern for Sephardic epitaphs. It is the only one of its kind in the cemetery. In the 1637 epitaph of Reina Saruco, the engraverjumbled the phrases of a standard epitaphic pattern. There is only one other epitaph with jumbled phrases in the cemetery: the 1639 inscription of Ester de Andrade (RS 1163). The third epitaph, the 1703 inscription of Abraham Ishac Cohen Lobato, is presented here, because it contains a unique example of an emblem-riddle of the type studied by Dan Pagis in Sod IHatum. However, the Hebrew poem of this epi- taph is quite different from the other Hebrew poems presented below, i.e., those of H. H. David Cohen de Lara (1674), Jacob Ishac de Lima (1669), and an unnamed person (1648). These last three poems follow a fixed meter, and their style of pre- sentation is similar to Siglo de Oro paradigms for cultivated poetry. The author of Cohen de Lara's epitaph was the Amsterdam rabbi, H. H. Selomoh de Oliveyra, as explained below. The authors of the last two poems are unknown; their style is sim- ilar to that of 'Avne Shoham. Ishac, Son ofJacob Cohen Lobato, and Reina Saruco The two anomalous epitaphs presented below most probably reflect eccen- tric tastes of the persons who chose the epitaphs. The epitaph of Ishac, son of Ja- cob Cohen Lobato, is the only inscription composed totally in Aramaic and cur- rently visible in the cemetery. The inscription of Reina Saruco is one of two epitaphs in which the phrases of a common Sephardic epitaphic format have been scrambled on the stone. Two versions of Reina Saruco's epitaph are shown below: (a) the actual arrangement of the letters on the stone, and (b) the intended text, un- scrambled and vocalized.

The Aramaic text is too lengthy to be regarded as a natural extension of the talmudic quote. Apparently, the person who chose the epi- taph's language was rather fond of Aramaic, e.g., a person for whom Aramaic was a novelty, such as the boy Ishac or maybe his father Jacob Cohen Lobato. The scrambling of phrases in the epitaph of Reina Saruco'o1 is too extensive to be attributed to confusion on the part of the engraver. The nearby stone of Ester de Andrade (RS1 163), dated 7 Iyar 5399 (1639), exhibits the same kind of scram- bling, which is not found on any other extant stone in the cemetery. The Hebrew lettering on both stones has a particularly wavy style, as if designed to make read- ing more difficult. Nevertheless, the epitaph's message is clear even to a novice in Hebrew; hence, the purpose could not have been to conceal in an effective way the 98. Epitaph of Ishac Cohen Lobato: Hebrew: For this / beauty, as it dissolves in the dust, / I am certainly weeping (Ber. 5b). It is / the son of Jacob Lobato / the Cohen, whose name was / Ishac, and he is called away from his blooming (the flower of his health) / and from the age of ten years he de- parted / on the day of the Sabbath, 9th / of the month Elul, year / 5418 of the world. (In line seven, the initial vav and mem are only conjectural, as a crack in the stone has destroyed major portions of these and other letters. The last line can be read also as "year of the resurrection to eternity," if one vocalizes (as above) the gematria for 5418 as the Hebrew word for "resurrection". The double meaning was clear- ly intentional, because the heh denoting the millenium was placed at the end of the number, i.e., in the position required by the Hebrew word.) Portuguese: Ishac, son of Jacob / Cohen Lobato; he died / on the Sabbath, / 9th of Elul / 5418. (The "V" in "FALESEv" is engraved smaller on the stone, as shown above.) Compare BLHS, p. 572, where the Aramaic text is omitted. 99. In fact, the passage in Ber. 5b has :n instead of the 1-an engraved on the stone. 100. In line nine, the reference to the month would be syntactically more appropriate as: 5~1Kiwi xr'. 101. Epitaph of Reina Saruco: This is the monument of the grave of the elderly, modest, and honored woman, the lady Reina Saruco; she departed to her eternal house on the 18th day of the month Elul, year 5397. May her soul be bound in the binding of life. (Among seventeenth-century Sephardim, it was common to give a feminine ending to the family surnames of women; hence, the Hebrew text says "Saruca" instead of "Saruco".) This epitaph is found also in BLHS, pp. 777-778. 79</page><page sequence="28">Marian and Ramfn F Sarraga identity of the buried person. One possibility, which is purely speculative, is that Reina Saruco and Ester de Andrade acquired their tombstones, and had most of the engraving done, before they died; however, they did not want to own stones an- nouncing their deaths in advance, and hence a symbolic scrambling was pre- scribed. The scrambled epitaphs date from before the 1652 consolidation of the Hamburg synagogues; perhaps, peculiar epitaphs were more tolerated during this early period. The Emblem-Riddle ofAbraham Ishac Cohen Lobato The epitaph below was published by Rochelle Weinstein in "Storied Stones," pp. 583-589, which discusses in detail the artistic elements of the stone monu- ment.102 The entire epitaph is reproduced here in order to analyze a literary riddle inserted in the text by the author. This type of analysis was not included in "Sto- ried Stones." The original monument of this grave consisted of a solid stone block, in the shape of a prism, resting on two supports. A precise knowledge of this shape is not needed to follow the discussion, if one treats terms such as "prism" or "support" merely as labels. The reader is urged to look at the photograph shown on p. 588 of "Storied Stones."103 RS585 WE-Abraham Ishac Cohen Lobato (age 61) (24 Tamuz 5463 / 8 July 1703) Top of the prism: Prism side 1: -in ýipn -Ixturfy -Inv ý 1V K~i7 ~51 III 651Y I0~xi ) 17 .3 '-vy ,n rr -,I p n! 3.a I-IM '7r73Vjl lrl'7ý111- Tilb a Prism side 2 p-*-,tm-7xn t3-Txn'~ miaxa nivinim in -1:;--7 qlma - y tnjm~ In X" jrs IyT 102.

He calls them multilingual "riddles with picture and text," or "emblem-riddles." Generally, these riddles were composed for entertainment during festive occasions, especially weddings. Well-known authors composed the riddles as public challenges, and the winner was the first person who could find the solution and also explain how the solution fits in the riddle. Prizes were awarded to the winner. Pagis explains that the formulation of a riddle could have many parts. For example, almost always there was a picture accompanied by some maxim and one or more poems. The main language was Hebrew, but maxims and poems in Ital- ian, Portuguese, and Castilian were common. Even Aramaic was used. In addition, finding the solution might require recognizing a word of a different language in- side a poem, as in the case of the Hebrew word tal in the Portuguese epitaph, shown earlier, for Sara Miriam Senior Coronel. Allusions to the Kaballah are found in some riddles. The first known "emblem-riddles" in Hebrew literature appeared in Italy in the 1640s. They were apparently adaptations of riddles that abounded in the Ital- ian and Iberian literature of the time. According to Pagis, the first adaptations may have been the work of the rabbi, cabalist, and poet Moseh Zacuto (c. 1610-1698), who became well-known as an author of this type of riddle. Zacuto was born in ei- ther Amsterdam or Hamburg and pursued at least some rabbinical studies in Poland.109 He apparently returned to Hamburg and lived there for about seven years before moving to Italy around 1642-3.110 Zacuto was one of several men of exalted man, the honorable Abraham / Cohen Lobato; / he departed on the first day (of the week), / 24th of the month / Tamuz, year 5463. / May his soul be bound in the binding of life. The burial of Abraham Cohen Lobato appears on p. 72 of the Irmandade records with the name "Abraham Ishac." 108. Support side 2: And under the stone I was buried / on the very day I was born, / year 5463 (1703). Support side 3: On the stone I was born / on the very day I was buried, / year 5402 (1642). Sup- port side 4: On the 8th of July I was born, / and on the stone I fell, / and with it (the stone) I covered myself, / and on the same day was my / end. 109. See J.

A solution to the riddle is sug- gested by Dan. 12:3: tW5. tvan.n t ':-J1,7 '~-'.. Y_'Pi,7 -171 U-m57. t ".7_! .-i.... (and those who understand will shine like the brightness of the sky, and those who lead people in a just path [will shine] like the stars forever and ever). Conse- quently, to poets, the word "star" became a metaphor for the soul of a just person, especially one who leads others in the correct path.'13 A just person takes a place (i.e., is born) among the stars on the day of death. Hence, support side 1 portrays the shining star ofAbraham Cohen Lobato. The oth- er sides are read in the order 3, 2, 4. In the text, the speaker alternates between Co- hen Lobato's soul (the star) and his body. Side 3 says that Cohen Lobato's body was born in the year 5402 (1642) on a birthing stone (cf. Exod. 1:16);114 more- over, he was born on the same numerical day and month of his future death (only a hint here, but inferred from side 4). Side 2 restates the coincidence of the nu- merical day and month, while giving the year of death as 5463 (1703). Side 4 says, in part, that the coincidence of day and month refers to the common date; i.e., Co- hen Lobato was born on 8 July 1642 and died on 8 July 1703. Since Hamburg changed from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar in 1700,"" the birth date could be the 8th of July of either calendar. Side 4 requires Cohen Lobato's star for a full explanation. The message seems to be that: (a) Cohen Lobato's star was born on the day of his death (NASY ... E NO PROPIO DIA FOY MEU FIN); (b) on that day, the rays of the new star fell on a stone (E SOBRE A PEDRA CAHI); and (c) this stone was used to carve Cohen Lobato's tombstone (E COM ELLA ME CUBRI). The text on side 2 of the prism fits well with this solution. In fact, this text says that Cohen Lobato's soul went into the hidden light, where "light" is a hint to the solution. Pagis often mentions this type of hint. The phrase hidden light is a ca- balistic expression referring to the light of heavenly reward, which the Lord hid 111.

No suggestion is being made here that this 1703 epitaph was directly influenced by Zacu- to, although it belongs to the genre possibly started by him. 113.

Other poems of Selomoh de Oliveyra were also used in epitaphs outside Amsterdam. E.g., the verses on the Altona stone of Hazan Joseph Namias (RS971), published on p. 701 of "Episodes", are the last six lines of a poem composed by Selomoh de Oliveyra for HIakham Semuel de Casseres of Amsterdam. (See Olijven, p. 194.) The same six verses are found in the 1754 epitaph ofH Iakham Ishac Rephael Abarbanel Souza in the Sephardic cemetery of Bayonne, France (which we saw in the sum- mer of 1999). 84</page><page sequence="33">Sephardic Epitaphs in Hamburg's Oldest Jewish Cemetery The lettering of both inscriptions is quite faded by now; in fact, their Second World War photographs are partially illegible. For the epitaph of H. H. David Co- hen de Lara,118 the text was completed by comparing the version in Olijven with a photograph from the 1920's.119 In the case of Jacob Ishac de Lima,120 the fading letters are further obscured by protruding gray veins in the shining white marble of this monument; however, a rubbing of the stone shows most of the letters clearly. Apart from the engraving, the quality of de Lima's stone certainly conveys an im- pression of opulence, while Cohen de Lara's stone is decidedly more modest. H. H. David Cohen de Lara (c. 1610-1674) distinguished himself as a schol- ar, authoring several works in Castilian and Hebrew. 21 He was a forceful early op- ponent of the pseudomessiah Shabbetai Zvi even before Shabbetai Zvi apostatized to Islam. In fact, Cohen de Lara used to turn his back to the hazan as the latter led a prayer for Shabbetai Zvi that had been added to the synagogue service in 1666, before the apostasy. On the evening of Yom Kippur for the year 5427, Dr. Baruch Namias de Castro (apparently the same man quoted earlier from Abudiente's Gra- 118. Epitaph of H. H.

Riby appears often in seventeenth-century doc- uments such as the Protocol.) Compare BLHS, p. 540. 119. See photograph labelled DA 27.062 at the Hamburg Denkmalschutzamt, which was at- tached to a card with the name of Max Halberstadt of Hamburg. This photograph already shows a crack in the stone, but the affected text (shown above in brackets) was reconstructed using the Amsterdam draft on p. 199 of Olijven. Olijven was also used to resolve ambiguities in reading the letters bet and kaf from the stone. On the other hand, the Amsterdam draft has In instead of ta in the last line of the octave, and here the stone is quite clear. Olijven also includes an additional word in line four, which is not on the stone and would violate the meter, but Olijven also indicates that this word was crossed out in the Amsterdam manuscript. 120. Epitaph of Jacob Ishac de Lima: Jacob, whose name was called Isaac, / will smile at his fate in the end of days; / though he left (Hamburg) and died in his youth while still afar, / his maturi- ty is a grave here, among those who are to rise; / it (the grave) is for him like a ladder to ascend to Heaven. / I will praise the son ofa living man, a wholly just man, / even if today he sleeps in the midst of silence, / tomorrow he will be enriched with a lofty hand (i.e., in an outstanding way). // He is the gentleman, and exalted, the honorable / Jacob Ishac de Lima, resting in honor; / he departed on the fourth day (of the week), on the fourth (day) / of the fourth month, and he was brought to / the tiled floor (see below) of his forebears and siblings, in his plot, / on the eve of the Sabbath, year: "and I / have trusted in Thy kindness; may my heart rejoice / in Thy salvation" (429 by gematria). (The quote is from Ps. 13:6. The phrase "tiled floor" - fourth line from the bottom - probably alludes to an arrangement of Sephardic tombstone slabs, which are laid horizontally side by side quite close to one another.) The entry for Jacob Ishac de Lima in BLHS, p. 561, omits this epitaph altogether. 121.

Only the sogerim rhyme, but instead of a uniform rhyme, the rhyme here is aabb. The first two lines are somewhat ambiguous, because the verb 'u; n can mean either "darkened" or "made pleasant" and can be transitive or intransitive. The word "sun" in the first two lines probably refers to Cohen de Lara's scholar- ly accomplishments, and the setting of the sun while still shining, in line two, probably alludes to Cohen de Lara's death before finishing the publication of his scholarly work.123 The second meaning of ,'1'n (made pleasant) simply stresses the greatness of Cohen de Lara's accomplishments. In line three, the "sun" is a metaphor for Cohen de Lara's reward, which is noted in line four.124 In line three, the word "sun" could also refer to Cohen de Lara's soul; in this sense, the "sun" would be a more glorious version of Abraham Cohen Lobato's "star", discussed earlier. The octave for Jacob Ishac de Lima has the same rhyme, abababcc, as the poems of 'Avne Shoham; the meter, shown above, is one of the variants found in 'Avne Shoham. Strictly speaking, the octave's milra' rhyme is violated by the final word pn3r in line five, whose stress is mil'el. This anomalous rhyme of prvn is not found in 'Avne Shoham; however, a similar case occurs in at least one Amsterdam epitaph, the 1673 inscription of Ishac de Jacob Pinto.125 In classical Andalusian poetry, the mixing of mil'el and milra' had been acceptable, but it was becoming objectionable in seventeenth-century Italy.126 The octave for de Lima illustrates the technical virtuosity required of poets who tried to adhere to a fixed meter. The vocalization -jpy- in line one exemplifies a type of meter-preserving exception used in 'Avne Shoham. However, the vocal- ization tarns3 in line six is not an exception, because it has a scriptural prece- dent, albeit unique, in Ps. 18:26. In essence, this example is to be regarded as a tri- umph of the poet, who managed to follow the meter without deviating from biblical vocalization. The use of biblical Hebrew as the standard of a refined style is a clas- sical Andalusian principle reiterated in Abudiente's Gramatica Hebraica. Inci- dentally, the use of ,-j in the fashion of lines seven and eight became quite popu- lar as a meter-preserving device. Line three of the poem for de Lima, "though he left (Hamburg) and died in his youth while still afar," may seem puzzling, because one may think that Jacob Ishac would not have been buried in Hamburg if he had died elsewhere. However, p. 52 of the Irmandade records describes precisely this situation: Em R Hodes tamus 7 [5447] = demos sepoltura a Samuel de lima quefaleceo em Copenhagen 122. For an account by H. H. Jacob Sasportas, who lived in Hamburg at the time, see Tsitsat Novel Zvi, pp. 132-133; the incident is also reviewed in Sabbatai Sevi, p. 580. 123. See "David Cohen de Lara," p. 344. 124.

(On 7 Tamuz [5447/1687], we gave burial to Semuel de Lima, who died in Copenhagen and was buried at the feet of his brother Jacob de Lima.) This Semuel de Lima must be the one buried in RS 1467, dated 29 Sivan 5447, under a stone that in 1999 still lay at the feet of the stone of Jacob Ishac de Lima. Cemetery records show no other de Lima stones that fit the Irmandade description. Since Semuel de Lima's body was taken to Al- tona for burial on a trip lasting roughly one week,127 it would not be surprising if the body of his brother Jacob had been handled in a similar way.128 A cabalistic flavor is evident in the poem for Jacob Ishac de Lima. The ex- pression -in ut 1p (son of a living man, quoting 2 Sam. 23:20) is a cabalistic des- ignation for a holy man.129 Similarly, the word ladder in line five alludes to Ja- cob's ladder (Gen. 28:12), which acquired additional connotations in the Kaballah. In the last line of the poem, the word .t . is used in the sense of Ps. 92:16 or Prov. 28:25. Nevertheless, there is an ambiguity in the vocalization, which can be: Tn;?" .r p~.i (enriched in an outstanding way), as shown above, or nim I-l_ 1~ (a feast in the hands of a worm). Obviously, the first rendition must be the primary meaning, although the second one provides a closer rhyme with rvy. In fact, the second meaning may have been also intended by the author in order to contrast the obvious physical reality with the spiritual reality he saw in the world to come. Am- biguous vocalization as a device for expressing paradox is certainly not found in Iberian languages; nevertheless, the motivation for expressing contrasts succinct- ly by means of ambiguity was present in the ideals of Iberian Siglo de Oro litera- ture. A Seventeenth-Century "Wandering Aramaean " The epitaph below emphasizes an exile, real or metaphorical, of the deceased from his original home. One is reminded of the "wandering Aramaean" of Deut. 26:5. The poem follows the style of Avne Shoham, including strict adherence to the meter by using rather uncommon, but scripturally based, vocalization. The epitaph is presented below in two versions. On the left is the actual lay- out of the lines on the stone, showing the apparent lettering with brackets around the locations that are most difficult to decipher. On the right is a vocalized re- arrangement of the text, which shows that the epitaph is an octave with a mil'el ab- baabcc rhyme and meter as indicated. (The initial 'n is considered outside the met- rical poem.) 127. The trip's duration of roughly one week follows from the date of death on the stone, 29 Sivan, and the date of burial in the Irmandade record, 7 Tamuz. 128. Jacob de Lima's epitaph says he died on a Wednesday and was buried on a Friday, pre- sumably two days later; hence, Jacob could not have died as far away as Copenhagen.

E.g., line one could be: 'n-,n x'ian' -a-n In (behold I was soft like an only son-i.e., soft because of God's kindness), or even: ,nn ,v ' n, 1 I n 1-In (be- hold I was oppressed, thus alone). The word in (behold) could also be read as In (charm, attracting favor). Within the epitaph, the same letter may occur in differ- ent sizes and styles. In some places, only a portion of an engraved letter is visible. In at least one place, a presumed vav resembles a nun or gimel; in another place, a yod was engraved like the upper part of a dalet. Below the first line, other debatable decisions were made to obtain the epi- taphic text shown above. In line three, one could argue that the engraved 1 (or) should be Ix (indeed) or even rT (then), since the disjunctive implication of "or" clashes with the context; however, Abudiente's Gramatica Hebraica includes 130. Epitaph without a name: Lord, behold I was dwelling like an only son (i.e., isolated); / God is father and mother (to me), my parents, whom I left behind; / or (i.e., and) God is the only one of those who took me in whom I loved; / may He nourish my soul for the light I have hoped for (cf. Job 3:9); / may she (the soul), redeemed by the religion, flee to God (whom) I have desired; / for in the jaws of destruction, I kept in mind the (future) brilliance; / my strength (meritorious deeds) will restore (me) to health in God in the day of (my) death; / although I shall walk a distance in the valley of the shadow of death (Ps. 23:4). (These lines and the line numbers in the discussion refer to the rearranged poem.) Portuguese: On 27 / Sivan 5408, fourth day (of the week), 7 June 1648. (This date is Julian; the Gregorian date is 17 June 1648.) Compare BLHS, pp. 853-854, where the Hebrew text is omitted. 88</page><page sequence="37">Sephardic Epitaphs in Hamburg's Oldest Jewish Cemetery "and" as a meaning for 1x.131 Also in line three, the word ,'ax (those who gather me) is read as in Prov. 10:5; however, one could also read ,rnx (my lights), assum- ing that the gimel is a mistaken engraving of a vav. In line four, the yod in m ', re- sembles the upper portion of a dalet; hence, one tends to think that the missing ver- tical stroke of the dalet has eroded. In the same line, the word 1-x on the stone resembles wii5, but the bottom stroke of the possible tsadi seems, on closer in- spection, to be only damage on the stone. Also in line four, the translation of'rn'n, as "my soul" follows the usage in the Kaballah,132 which is based on Ps. 22:21 and Ps. 35:17. In line six, the meter is preserved by adopting a nonstandard vocaliza- tion of b5nr ,?,'n -, which has biblical precedents in Job 40:26 (T0,n) and Lam. 1:2 (mror). In the last two lines, the meter is preserved by rejecting readings that would be more natural, such as nuj 5tr Kx.3n, in the penultimate line, and 1.5i-, in the last line. Assuming the exile of the deceased is not entirely metaphorical, one could speculate that he may have been a converso who had left his parents in the Iberian peninsula. Perhaps the name of the deceased was omitted intentionally for fear that spies of the Inquisition might read the epitaph and cause problems for his fami- ly.133 The name may also be hidden within the epitaph. For example, the phrase 'nwvp 5xt Kxin, in the penultimate line, might be an allusion to a name like Rephael Castiel.134 The 1687 epitaph of an Elyakim Castiel (RS1285) uses similar lan- guage, including the word ,nwp, in an allusion to the name of the deceased. EPILOGUE The preponderance of Hebrew poems in Altona within a period of roughly 200 years starting in 1611 is a strong indication that, during this time, the Sephardic community had an influential core of persons who could read and appreciate He- 131. See Gramatica Hebraica, p. 143, where four possible meanings of 1K are given, including the Portuguese e (and); see also poem 36 in 'Avne Shoham, where 1K is used in a sense that is clearly not disjunctive. 132. See, e.g., Kabbalah, pp. 157-158. 133. It is well-known that the Inquisition received reports from informers about former con- versos living as Jews in Hamburg, although it is unknown how well informed the Jews were about such reports. For sample reports, see Cecil Roth, "The Strange Case of Hector Mendes Bravo," Hebrew Union College Annual, Cincinnati, Ohio, vol. 18 (1944), pp. 221-245; P. A. d'Azevedo, "O Bocarro Frances e os Judeus de Cochim e Hamburgo," Archivo Hist6rico Portuguez, vol. 8 (1910), pp. 15-20 and 185-198; I. S. Revah, "Une famille de 'nouveaux-chretiens': les Bocarro Frances," Revue des JEtudes Juives, vol. 16 (CXVI) (1957), pp. 73-87; and the 1661 and 1662 denunciations by a Semuel Aboab to the Spanish Inquisition in Madrid contained in Archivo Hist6rico Nacional, Inqu., lib. 1127.

An Ester, orphan of a Rephael Castiel, is listed among candidates for the dowry drawing of Amsterdam in 5419 (1659), eleven years after the date on the tombstone. (See the unpublished doc- uments of the Sephardic dowry society in Amsterdam, Dotar, stored at the Amsterdam Gemeen- tearchiefunder label GAA, PIG 1143, p. 299.) In addition, Kellenbenz mentions a Rephael Castiel in connection with Danzig; see Sephardim an der Unteren Elbe, p. 83.These references show that a Rephael Castiel did live in the relevant timeframe, and they do not exclude the possibility that this Rephael Castiel had died in Hamburg in 1648. 89</page><page sequence="38">Marian and Ram6n E Sarraga brew literature. This core group included more persons than just the rabbis, ha- zanim, and teachers; e.g., it must have included the men whose epitaphs carry only the title ha-maskil ve-navon (an understanding and prudent man, i.e., a learned scholar).135 Additional persons were probably involved, at least as a moderately knowl- edgeable audience that applauded Hebrew literature and stimulated its cultivation. Such an audience should have had a better than elementary education in the Tanakh, Talmud, Kaballah, and other traditional literature. In the case of Amsterdam, it has been noted that some ordinary persons (i.e., Sephardim who did not pursue full- time positions as rabbis, cantors, or teachers) received a solid education in tradi- tional Judaica.136 Therefore, one could make the tentative assumption that at least some ordinary persons in Hamburg received a similar education. The number and quality of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Hebrew epitaphs in Altona are con- sistent with this assumption. APPENDIX: SOME CORRECTIONS TO OUR PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED EPITAPHS The inscription below for a Batseba, with no family name given, was pub- lished in "Episodes," p. 667, with epigraphic errors. By making better use of a bib- lical concordance and comparing with the stone, one obtains the superior version presented below. Also included is the inscription of Sara Abigail Rachel, wife of Benjamin Mussafia, which was published in "Episodes," p. 677, with an incorrect translation and no meter. The version below includes both the layout of the letters on the stone and a vocalized rendition of the poem in the first eight lines of the in- scription.

All lines have the same rhyme except the seventh, and each line has eight syllables (count- ing the sheva as needed) except the seventh.137 Clearly, this poem is quite differ- ent in style from the octaves of 'Avne Shoham. In the inscription for Sara Abigail Rachel Mussafia,138 the vocalization demonstrates the meter and brings out the Aramaic expressions in the first line. Such use of Aramaic is very rare in Altona epitaphs. Another peculiarity of this epitaph is the clearly intentional ambiguity of the word -nw at the end of each line. These two features suggest that the poem's author was the philologist Dr. Benjamin ben Immanuel Mussafia (c. 1606-1675), who lived in Hamburg until the 1640's and published a well-known manual on biblical philology, Zekher Rav; in fact, Sara Abigail Rachel was the wife to whose memory Mussafia dedicated the first edi- 137. Epitaph of Batseba: Blessed be the Lord. / Alas, how will she stand out among brothers (cf. Hos. 13:15) / like a rose among thorns (Cant. 2:2)? / And like a flowering (plant) that brought forth blossoms (Gen. 40:10), / Batseba was announcing (future) apples. / You are on high with angels, / and in your mother's room they weep; / this cry has hastened your perfume (Cant. 1:12), my daughter, / to give the fragrance of a sacrifice offering (Ezech. 20:28). // Blessed be the Lord. / In the first day of the week, on the 14th / of the month Iyar, year / five thousand and three / hundred and eighty-six / of the creation of the world. (The number 70 in the epitaph for Batseba is engraved at the upper right-hand corner of the stone.) Compare BLHS, pp. 852-853. 138. Epitaph of Sara Abigail Rachel Mussafia: May a stone tell, since my wife went away, / that Abigail (is) with God, her Master; / Rachel adhered to her Lord; (to Him) she looked (also possible: she sang); / to go on the path of the upright, He released her. (This translation is only one of several possible, depending on how the final word row is vocalized in each line; the slashes refer to the lines of the vocalized text.) The rest of the epitaph reads: On the evening after the Sabbath Nahamu (the one following the 9th of Ab), year 5394, the honored Sara Abigail Rachel, wife of Benjamin Mussafia, ceased (to live); may she be remembered for praise. Compare BLHS, p. 662. 91</page><page sequence="40">Marian and Ramrn F Scrraga tion of Zekher Rav (Amsterdam 1635).139 The preface to this edition contains a moving speech in which Mussafia addresses his deceased wife Sara in Heaven, summarizing her life. Sara was born in Adar II 5372 (1612) as the only daughter of Dr. Semuel da Silva (most probably RS1049 WE, d. Gregorian 3 January 1631)140 and his wife Ribca (RS1047 NE, d. 1634), sister of Mussafia's mother. Sara received the additional names Abigail and Rachel because of life-threatening illnesses she contracted during her life. She married Mussafia on 13 Sivan 5388 (1628), but her children did not survive. Mussafia also states that Sara died of smallpox in Hamburg and that he had her buried in Altona. The date he gives for her death agrees with the epitaph.141 The fact that Sara's epitaphic poem combines Aramaic with Hebrew, as in the Talmud, violates a principle of elegant style listed in Abudiente's grammar; however, talmudic usage would not be surprising from Dr. Benjamin Mussafia, who also made an influential contribution to the philol- ogy of the Talmud in his Musaf he- 'Arukh (Amsterdam 1655). Incidentally, even Abudiente's 'Avne Shoham includes a few verses in Aramaic. Finally, "Episodes," p. 695, contains a mistranslation of ,rnwn 'nrin twnin (searching the innermost recesses) in the Hebrew inscription for Jacob Cohen Be- linfante, because the relation of this phrase to Prov. 20:27 was missed. Other prob- lems in "Episodes" will be discussed elsewhere. Marian and Ram6n E Sairraga Warren, Michigan 139. We are indebted to Drs. F. J.
