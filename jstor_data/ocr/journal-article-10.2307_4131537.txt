Reconstructing National Identity: The Jews of Habsburg Austria During World War I. Studies in Jewish History. New York: Oxford Univer- sity Press, 2001. 304 pp. Considerable attention has been focused on Habsburg Jewry, especially the Jews of Vienna, before World War I. Several works have also dealt with the Jews of Austria and the other Habsburg successor states during the interwar years. Un- til now, no books have explored in depth the experiences of Austrian Jewry during the First World War. This past year, however, two books, Marsha L. Rozenblit's Re- constructing National Identity: The Jews ofHabsburg Austria During World War I and David Rechter's The Jews of Vienna and the First World War, appeared to fill this lacuna in the scholarly literature. Although these books cover the same period and share much the same material, their scope and approach are very different. Reconstructing National Identity is the more ambitious and broader of the two works. It is a very well researched, focused, and carefully thought-out study 373</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews of the impact of World War I on the identity of the German-speaking Jews of Hab- sburg, Austria. From the outset, the author posits a tripartite identity for Austrian Jewry before, during, and even after World War I: They were Austrian by political loyalty; German (or Czech or Polish) by cultural affiliation; and Jewish in an eth- nic, as well as a religious, sense. It is hard to miss Rozenblit's thesis, since she con- stantly reiterates it while demonstrating and documenting it quite convincingly throughout the book. Reconstructing National Identity effectively combines the methodologies of cultural, social, and political history in portraying a complex Jewish society dur- ing wartime. Rozenblit utilizes a wide range of primary and secondary sources, es- pecially archival materials, newspapers, letters, and memoir literature. Given the widespread press censorship during the war, much of this primary material is dif- ficult to deal with, yet Rozenblit handles it extremely well. The book covers a wide geographical range, with its focus constantly shifting from Vienna to Bohemia and Moravia, then to Galicia and Bukovina, while analyzing the multiple identities of Eastern and Western Jews, Liberals, Jewish Nationalists, and Orthodox. Some chapters also provide a thought-provoking comparative perspective on Jewish identities, contrasting Austrian Jewry in a multinational state with French and Ger- man Jews on the one hand and Hungarian Jews on the other. Rozenblit constantly emphasizes the loyalty of Habsburg Jewry to Austria and their devotion to Kaiser Franz Josef. But she also stresses the fact that during World War I, while fighting valiantly on behalf of their country, Jewish soldiers were also fighting on behalf of their fellow Jews in Russia. She demonstrates that Austrian Jews were much more enthusiastic about fighting a "holy war" against Russia than serving on the Italian front. The author discusses at length Jewish re- sponses to escalating anti-Semitism during and immediately after the war and the disappointment expressed by many Jews that their loyalty went unrecognized. My two favorite chapters in this book bring to life everyday activities dur- ing wartime as seen from a Jewish perspective. In Chapter 3, "Mobilizing the Home Front," Rozenblit vividly portrays the plight of Jewish refugees from Gali- cia and the efforts of various Jewish communities, particularly Jewish women, to help them. In Chapter 4, "The Experiences of Jewish Soldiers," she deals with the relationship between Jewish soldiers on the front, their families, and the organized Jewish communities of Austria, exploring the role of chaplains and the provision of kosher food within the Habsburg army, as well as the varied Jewish identities and experiences of soldiers from diverse backgrounds. Marsha Rozenblit's main conclusion is that the Jews of Habsburg Austria tried to maintain their tripartite identity during and after the war, despite the breakup of multinational Austria-Hungary into multiple nation-states. Most Jews, she claims, still clung to the idea of being loyal citizens of the new states in which they lived, speaking German, Czech, and so forth as the case might be, but identi- fying themselves as Jews rather than as Germans or Czechs by ethnicity or na- tionality. This solution worked reasonably well in interwar Czechoslovakia, but not in the new Republic of Austria or elsewhere. Rozenblit argues that although the overall situation changed dramatically as a result of the war, Jewish identity, for the most part, did not. 374</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews David Rechter's The Jews of Vienna and the First World War, a study in the ethnopolitics of the Jewish community of Vienna during World War I, is a slimmer volume with a much narrower focus and approach. The work started out as the au- thor's doctoral dissertation at Hebrew University, under the supervision of Ezra Mendelsohn, Jonathan Frankel, and Robert Wistrich, who are among the leading authorities on Jewish political history. This book is quite competently researched and written, but it does not contain a great deal that is really new to anyone famil- iar with Austrian Jewish politics in the early twentieth century. It relies heavily on the archival materials at the Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People in Jerusalem and the Jewish newspapers published in Vienna during the war, as well as secondary sources. This work should really be entitled Jewish Politics in Vienna rather than The Jews of Vienna, but I admit that I already usurped that particular title for my own book, published by Indiana University Press in 1991, before I shifted my empha- sis from political to social history. Rechter's study demonstrates some of the pit- falls of writing a purely political history of a Jewish community, especially during wartime, without much social context. The Galician Jewish refugees who were in Vienna, but not really of Vienna, remain statistics; Jewish soldiers are barely men- tioned, although they appear on the cover photo; mass movements-whether youth movements or Jewish Congress movements-are posited, but not fully document- ed; and since no elections or referenda were held during the war, the focus remains entirely on a handful of Jewish leaders, whether Jewish Nationalist, Liberal, or Or- thodox, who might, or might not, represent the views of the Jews of Vienna. While reading this book, at times it's hard to remember that there was actually a war go- ing on. Rechter's study, which treats Vienna as the embodiment of all of Austrian Jewry, seems to miss the mark on occasion and to overstate its arguments. As a mi- nor quibble, I have to point out that, unlike his fellow Zionist precursor Jehuda Haj Alkalaj, Zvi Hirsch Kalischer was not born in Sarajevo but in Posen, a different borderland. Rechter ignores the involvement of Jews, especially members of the younger generation, in the Austrian Social Democratic Party and often seems to exaggerate the importance of the Jewish Nationalists during and immediately af- ter the war. In his chapter on "Warring Youth," he emphasizes the role of Siegfried Bernfeld in the development of an Austrian Jewish youth movement under Zion- ist auspices during World War I. However, Bernfeld did not remain a Zionist for very long, and neither did many of the youth who belonged to the organization he had created before the war. His efforts did not lead to a strong and viable Zionist youth movement in Vienna. Before the war, some students at the University of Vi- enna were very active Zionists, but during the war, most male students were serv- ing in the army; they were the real "warring youth." After the war, more Jewish young people in Vienna became involved in socialist than in Jewish Nationalist politics. Rechter certainly did not support his assertion that Jewish politics during and after the war can be seen as a "children's crusade" (p.101). Similarly, in the chapter he calls "In Pursuit of Unity," Rechter chronicles the total lack of unity among Viennese Jews during and after World War I. Unlike the American Jewish Congress that successfully emerged during the war, the Con- 375</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews gress movement in Austria never got off the ground, but instead got bogged down in internal disagreements between the Viennese Jewish Nationalist leader Robert Stricker and the Prague Zionist spokesman Siegmund Kaznelson. Neither the Lib- erals nor the Orthodox ever supported the idea of a Jewish Nationalist-dominated Congress. Just as the youth movement equaled Bernfeld, the Congress movement equaled Kaznelson; both attempts failed to develop into anything meaningful. Rechter, who seems to believe the rhetoric of the Jewish Nationalist press, exag- gerates the significance of the Jewish National Council and its temporary success in implementing some of its program immediately after the war. His final chapter, "A Jewish Revolution" merely proves that no real revolution took place within the Jewish community of Vienna after World War I, despite the revolutionary upheaval all around. Perhaps it is unfair to compare a narrow study in communal politics by a more junior scholar, based on his dissertation, with the work of a senior scholar, who created a fascinating synthesis within a broader framework. Marsha Rozen- blit and David Rechter agree on the staunch loyalty of Austrian Jewry to Franz Josef and the multinational empire and both adopt a Zionist interpretation of Jew- ish identity and politics in Austria during and after the war, but Rozenblit's analy- sis of the data seems more nuanced and evenhanded than Rechter's. Instead of emphasizing the centripetal force of Vienna, Rozenblit compares the attitudes and behaviors of Viennese Jews with those of Jews in Bohemia and Moravia, as well as in Galicia and Bukovina. Sometimes, as Rechter would have it, Viennese Jew- ish leaders, whether Liberals or Jewish Nationalists, were indeed the spokesmen for all of Austrian Jewry during and immediately after World War I, but in other instances, Rozenblit proves convincingly that that was certainly not the case. Re- constructing National Identity is a path breaking study that makes an important contribution to our knowledge of twentieth-century Jewish and Central European history and our understanding of World War I and Jewish identity. The Jews of Vi- enna and the First World War provides a more limited contribution to the existing scholarship on Viennese Jewry and Jewish politics. Although it sheds light on Jew- ish youth movements, as well as Liberal and Jewish Nationalist communal politics in wartime, Rechter's competent research will undoubtedly be overshadowed by Rozenblit's landmark study.
