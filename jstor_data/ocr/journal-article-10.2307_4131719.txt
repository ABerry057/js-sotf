<plain_text><page sequence="1">Judith Laikin Elkin. The Jews ofLatin America. New York: Holmes &amp; Meier, 1998. xv, 339 pp. Until the late 1920s, the subject of Latin American Jewry was not of great interest to Jewish scholars. It only burst forth with the beginning of the persecu- tion of the Jews in Nazi Germany, especially in the years when they were forced to seek a refuge in any country willing to give them a life-saving visa. During this period, guides, leaflets, and books about all the Latin American countries were published, providing information about their histories and the presence of Jews. There was also some discussion, naturally, of the expectations for immigrants to remake their lives. In the first years of the postwar period, specialized books and encyclopedias began to appear, including the voluminous Enciclopedia Judaica, published in Mexico in 1948, which for the first time dedicated appropriate space to each of the Latin American countries and entrusted the writing of these articles to Jewish spe- cialists residing in the various countries. Later, between 1966 and 1975, the Buenos Aires branch of the American Jewish Committee published several volumes under the title Jewish Communities in Latin America, which expanded the treatment of the history, presence, and or- ganization of Jews in these countries of the New World, providing recent infor- 385</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review mation and essays by leading figures of Latin American Jewry. Around the same time, in 1976, Judith Laikin Elkin presented the results of her investigations of the history of the Jews of Latin America in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in her unpublished Ph.D. dissertation at the University of Michigan. Since then this well-known scholar has specialized in the study of Latin American Jewry. Her first book, Jews of the Latin American Republics, appeared in 1980, and her subsequent book, whose revised edition we are reviewing here, was published in 1998. Although it is true, as Elkin says in the preface to her new book, that since 1979 "more research has been published on Latin American Jewry than in the pre- vious one hundred years," the material she uses is not always trustworthy, and at times her sources must be subjected to strict rectification and evaluation. To mention but one instance, in her discussion of the Jews in Mexico, she uses estimated data stating that "the Jewish population of Mexico in 1905-10 var- ied from seventy-five [families] to fifteen thousand " (p. 61), a figure that shows how imprecise Jewish demographic studies were at the beginning of the twentieth century. Further on, the author of the source of this information, Corinne Azen Krause (The Jews in Mexico [Mexico City, 1987], p. 68, n. 9 ) mentions "a Jewish banker, Jean Baptiste Jecker," information which she took from another author without checking it properly. Could a Jewish boy, in the middle of the last centu- ry, have been named John the Baptist? Unfortunately, this information also appears in Judith Laikin Elkin's book (p. 39). During the first decades of the nineteenth century, only a few thousand Jews were to be found anywhere in Latin America (p. 47). It must be recalled, however, that until the end of the century, the stream of European immigrants (excluding, naturally, those from Spain and Portugal), while not large, was very important for the development of agriculture, technology, and science. That is why several Latin American countries sought to increase the immigration from Europe, facilitating the arrival, mainly in the Argentine, of numerous Jews flee- ing the pogroms in tsarist Russia from 1889 onwards. The available statistics show that only a small percentage of the Jews leaving Russia found a new home in Latin America in the years before World War I. Thus, between 1901 and 1914, the total number of Jews arriving in the main centers of immigration in Latin America, Argentina, and Brazil, amounted to 96,000, hardly more than arrived in Canada, while the United States absorbed, in the same period, more than 1,346,000. Possibly as a reaction to the increase in immigration and to the special treat- ment European immigrants were given as compared to the native population, na- tionalist ideologies came into being in several Latin American countries. On the one hand, this trend showed a preference for the old creole traditions, and on the other, it fomented a negative image of the Jews, turning to the well-known antise- mitic allegations popularized in France, Germany, and tsarist Russia in the second half of the nineteenth century. After World War I, the suspicion that Jews from Rus- sia might be secret Bolsheviks was added. Thus, during a strike at an ironworks in Buenos Aires, when an effort was made to determine who had been stirring up the workers, rumors spread that those responsible for the agitation were immigrants, especially Catalans and Jews. A pogrom resulted from the violent repression of the 386</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews striking workers during the so-called Tragic Week in January 1919. Private homes and stores were looted, libraries destroyed, and 800 persons arrested, of whom 80% were Russians. Among the hundreds of dead and thousands of wounded, many were Jews. This exaggerated nationalism was echoed by a substantial number of Ar- gentineans and paved the way for Nazi and fascist propaganda, which found so many adepts in influential circles of the Argentinean Republic. It was they who lat- er drew up the regulations for the country's immigration legislation . An extensive part of The Jews of Latin America is devoted to Argentina, for it was the Latin American country that accepted the greatest number of Jewish im- migrants. At the outset, in the agricultural colonies financed by Baron Maurice de Hirsch and founded by the Jewish Colonization Association (JCA), thousands of Jews attempted to remake their lives in new settlements located in different provinces of the Argentine. However, by the first decades of the twentieth centu- ry, Buenos Aires and other cities were receiving the greater part of the immigrant stream. Statistics published in recent years show that in 1909, approximately 19,000 Jews were living in the agricultural colonies, 16,500 or so in Buenos Aires, and around 13,000 in other cities of the province. By 1917, Argentina was home to an estimated 110,000 to 113,000 of the 150,000 Jews then living in Central and South America and in the Caribbean (p. 68). If we consider, as well, that even at present more than half of Latin American Jewry is concentrated in Argentina, it is clear why so many studies of Jews in this part of the New World focus on that country. Elkin's book thoroughly analyzes the difficult process of initiation into Argentina's economic life, as well as the Jewish communal organization that developed there. She begins by examining the formation and failure of the Jew- ish agricultural colonies and the long and difficult process of social and economic integration of the first generation of immigrants. "Sephardim and Ashkenazim began their life as pedlers" (p. 134), she explains, selling small and portable items of mass consumption, and cloth. In many cases, those who did not have the capital to purchase merchandise obtained initial loans without interest from mutual aid societies established by immigrants. However, the second and third generations of Argentinean Jews had to traverse a slow and difficult road before they were able to join the country's middle class. Still, in 1960, about a third of Argentinean Jews were in business, almost 20% made their living as industrial workers, and only 10% were in the free professions (p. 151). Although a small percentage of the Jewish populace ascended to the wealthy upper class, a con- siderable number lived below the poverty level. Thus, in 1990, some 5,000 Ar- gentinean Jewish families received subsistence from their communities, as did 12% of the Jews remaining in Peru in 1988 (pp.155-156). Equally alarming, in the same year, 35% of the children attending the Jewish school in Lima needed scholarships. The profound political and socioeconomic changes in Latin America over the last few decades led Elkin to rewrite her chapter "The Jewish Street," which had been published under the same title in Jews of the Latin American Republics (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1980). In it, she discusses the or- 387</page><page sequence="4">AJS Review ganization of Jewish communal life in Argentina and in other Latin American countries such as Uruguay, Brazil, and Mexico. Her account of the beginnings and the evolution of the main Jewish institution in Latin America, the kehillah, is ex- cellent. This institution, from its origins until the present day, has maintained a mo- nopoly on burial; credit organizations (which began as an aid to destitute immi- grants); charitable agencies for the poor, sick, and aged; and the network of Jewish schools, communal press, libraries, youth groups, and also, sometimes, sports clubs. In Argentina, this umbrella organization is known as AMIA, but similar organiza- tions are found in other Latin American countries. Although "characterized by a highly centralized and rigid bureaucracy" in some sectors, AMIA was in the past and still is the country's main Jewish institution. Nevertheless, the fact that even in 1970, 70% of its members were over fifty years old, and 17% were over seven- ty (p. 187), suggests that it has lost its appeal for the new generations of native- born Jews, who are more interested in participating in the secular world of the uni- versities and in the cultural and political worlds of their respective countries. Is there a connection between the lack of interest in Jewish institutions among younger people and the alarming decrease in the Jewish population of Latin America over the past few decades? The chapter entitled "Latin American-Jewish Demography" allows us to draw some conclusions. In her earlier book, Elkin said that "some 550,000 people who were identifiable Jews were living in the Latin American republics in 1960, 310,000 of them in Argentina" (p. 191). Now, with 1990 as the reference year, these figures are dramatically reduced to 430,000 per- sons in Latin America, with 30% of them, which is 208,000, in Argentina. Similar reductions are mentioned for the other Latin American countries. The reasons for this decrease include emigration, for economic and politi- cal reasons, to Israel, the United States, and Europe. Other studies indicate that the death rate is at times greater than the birth rate, and point out an increase in inter- marriage. It is necessary to discuss the reliability of the figures for the Jewish popula- tion of the Americas given in Table Four. Let us take as an example the permanent change in the figures for the Jewish population of Chile. Up to the 1950s, the to- tal is said to have been 35,000 people (Jewish Communities in LatinAmerica, 1966, p. 52), a figure provided by the country's Jewish leaders. The figure was reduced to 28,000 in the first edition of the earlier Jews of the Latin American Republics (p. 193). In 1994 the figure is again reduced: only 15,000 Jews are mentioned in Chile in the American Jewish Year Book (1996). A socio-demographic study by the Representative Committee of the Jewish Institutions, an organization which links all the Jewish institutions in Chile, mentions a total of 19,000 persons. Now, thanks to a study by the German historian Irmtrud Wojak in 1994, it is known that around 13,000 German-speaking refugees arrived in Chile between 1933 and 1941. Of these, only 1,500 families joined the B'ne Isroel community, founded by German Jews. The others did not join any Jewish institution at the time. We must assume that most of them did not appear in any internal census of the community. Nor do later censuses include Jewish residents of Chile who, for what- ever reason, are not active in Jewish communal life and do not belong to any Jew- ish institution. 388</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews In light of this, is there really so alarming a decrease in the Jewish popu- lation of Latin America, or could it be that the published studies only consi- der persons who have a connection with Jewish institutions? Whether the re- duction in reported Jewish population reflects a decrease in population, or a de- crease in Jewish activity that facilitates identification in population surveys, if the trend continues, it may endanger the survival of organized Jewish life in Latin America. Anyone who wishes to learn about the problems of Latin American Jewry will find it essential to read Elkin, whose numerous publications on Latin Ameri- can Jewry make her one of the most distinguished scholars in the field. This vol- ume's numerous notes and lengthy bibliography will facilitate further research by readers seeking a deeper understanding of the question of the future of the Latin American Jewry and the strategy for Jewish survival in Latin America.
