<plain_text><page sequence="1">Marc B. Shapiro. Between the Yeshiva World and Modern Orthodoxy: The Life and Works of Rabbi Jehiel Jacob Weinberg, 1884-1966. London: Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 1999. 283 pp. Jehiel Jacob Weinberg was, and remains, one of the outstanding figures of Modern Orthodoxy, along with David Zvi Hoffmann, Isaac Herzog, and Joseph B. Soloveitchik. Shapiro's exemplary biography marks the onset of a new stage in biographical scholarship about leading Orthodox personalities, moving beyond the hagiographies (which brought the figures to attention while affirming the Or- thodox community) and the pioneer studies of Aharon Sorasky and Aharon Rak- effet-Rothkoff, and is a mandate for Judaic scholars to study the other greats (in- cluding the Hofets Hayim, Hayim Hirschensohn, Meir Shapiro of Lublin, Nathan Birnbaum, Hayim Ozer Grodzensky and Jakob Rosenheim). This book tells us what it takes to be a pathfinder in the world of twentieth-century Orthodox Ju- daism: the courage to carry a Hegelian-like dialectic about religious options to conclusion in a world of societal turmoil and historical trauma. As Weinberg moved from Slobodka to Pilwishki (Lithuania), to Giessen, Berlin, and then through the Warsaw ghetto, detention camp in Wiilzburg, and finally to Montreux, he existentialized the struggle between the isolated talmudic culture of Eastern Europe and the Talmud cum secular culture of the West and its synthetic conclu- sion. Weinberg was a man of the sacred. He recalled how the Musar great, Yitshak Blazer, spoke on the Yom Kippur before he went to Palestine, dressed in his white Kittel and wrapped in his Tallit: "Here was a man, a giant who had not stopped studying all his life, sobbing his fear that he had not fulfilled his duty to the Almighty.... Whenever Yom Kippur night arrives, I relive that sacred hour, the holy face, the awesome scene, the timeless faith" (p. 9). He found a vessel for the sacred in the Knesset Yisrael Yeshivah of Slobodka, where Nathan Zvi Finkel grafted introspection to improve one's human character onto study of the Talmud, and then in the yeshivah world of Pilwishki. For Weinberg of Pilwishki, the intel- lectual and moral identity of Judaism was to be found only in the traditional Jew- ish communities of Eastern Europe, where it was severed from general culture. Jewish ethics were to be drawn from the divine will, not extracted from universal categories; secular studies were of themselves useless in terms of the sacred cen- ter: "Those who say that we should grab the coat corners of our young ones who are led astray and attract them with the beauty of Japhet so that we bring them into 175</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews the tents [of?] Shem are making a great mistake. For when the spark of self-sacri- fice has vanished from the heart, hope for Judaism is lost" (p. 27). However, Weinberg left his Eastern European world for medical treatment in Germany, war broke out between Germany and Russia preventing return, and he began to see things differently. He recognized the need to go beyond the Tal- mud to cope with changing times. Before, he was willing to sacrifice the outer core of Jewry, which looked to secular culture because it was detached from the center. Now he was willing to turn from the center for the moment to face surrounding historical realities. He advocated scientific study-as a student of Paul Kahle and as an instructor of Bible and Rabbinics at the University of Giessen-and he as- sumed the leadership of the Berlin Rabbinical (Hildesheimer) Seminary, known for its prerequisite of secular education and advocacy of Wissenschaft des Juden- tum's study of Jewish texts. Before, he discounted the role of religious laymen in the survival of Judaism, which he believed depended upon Torah study. Now he saw the need to combine Torah study with professional training. He embraced Samson Raphael Hirsch's Torah 'im derekh 'erez (Torah and culture) doctrine, which he had earlier rejected. Before, he idealized the ghetto's isolation; now he "came to agree with Hirsch that it was the ghetto which had caused a major dis- tortion in Jewish values. It was the ghetto and other persecutions which had turned Judaism into a religion of ritual and the synagogue" (pp. 154-155). Before, he shared company with Israel Meir Hacohen and Eliyahu Dessler; now he belonged alongside Hanokh Ehrentreu and Yeshayahu Wolfsberg. Still, none of this meant a dilution of his sacred commitment to Blazer's God. He grounded the Seminary stu- dents in the Lithuanian yeshivah method of Talmud study-it was a precondition for using the critical approach. In 1934, Grodzensky encouraged Weinberg to transform the Berlin Seminary into a yeshivah, "because one must ascend in holi- ness, not descend." But Weinberg's ascent was in place-he just no longer needed to turn his back to the secular universe, or separate piety from science, art, politics and professional life, to keep it so. Then came Kristallnacht, the Warsaw ghetto, and detention camp in Wiilz- burg-and after that, twenty years in Montreux. Weinberg would not go to the Land of Israel: "There are different worlds there, which reject and hate one anoth- er. I am part of two worlds; and which one should I choose when I go there?" (p. 176 n. 16). In true dialectical fashion, the "thesis" of sacred life in Pilwishki included the seed of "antithesis": namely, Finkel's approach to Musar, which stressed the dignity of humanity, the condition for the possibility of openness to the humanistic dimension of secular and scientific study, and the notion that be- sides studying the laws of kashrut, students should strive to enable Judaism to be- come a spiritual force for humans. The antithesis in Germany contained the Lith- uanian method of Talmud study, so that when the talmudic vessel of sacred ascent moved west it was not diluted but potentially strengthened by critical and histori- cal analysis. There were two spheres, each containing something of the other, po- tentially or actually. After the chaos of the Holocaust, Weinberg settled into his own isolated world in Montreux, as a renowned halakhist distilling the cultures of East and West into rulings of historical impact for Judaism. Writing Samuel Atlas about his geographic loneliness, he expressed the holiness that imbued his synthesis as 176</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews he contemplated the end: "Only the pure righteous ones are at peace with death, because they believe that it is a gateway from life to life, from degraded life to ex- alted life, and even then they do not want to die" (p. 174). In her comprehensive essay, "Between East and West: Modernity and Traditionalism in the Writings of Rabbi Yehiel Weinberg,"1 Judith Bleich characterizes Weinberg as an intermediary who interpreted Zionist aspirations to the non-Zionist Orthodox, fears among the religious secular nationalists, women's rights to the devout, text-critical study to rabbinic scholars, and pilpul to academicians. Beyond this mediating function, Weinberg's whole life was a progressive internal reconciliation of the two sides. Why, or more importantly, how, was he supposed to split himself asunder and choose academic scholarship/torah Cim derekh 'erez in the Holy Land? Shapiro's mastery of rabbinic and historical sources, the fact that no relevant archival or published source is untouched, the superb contextual studies (Eastern European views of German Orthodoxy, Jewish educational changes in the inter- war period, shehitah legislation, Grossgemeinde vs. Austrittsgemeinde), the 1,037 enriching and critical footnotes, make this a classic. With the story of Weinberg's life and work now complete, it is time for the intellectual historian's questions. Was the relationship between the Lithuanian yeshivah and the Berlin Seminary as du- alistic as scholars take for granted-or did the respective proponents rather reside on opposite sides of a continuum, such that all involved belonged to a larger syn- thesis? How did the biographical reality of Weinberg's circumstantial move to Ger- many relate to his ideological transformation; would he have changed ideas with- out his geographical change in perspective? Was his early identification with Musar (as I suggest) a prelude to his later openness to historical developments of scholarship? How may his initial gratitude for Hitler's fight against Communism and atheism be understood in the context of his German Orthodoxy? Why did he have so much to say about the Jewish state, but so little about the Holocaust? Gershon Greenberg American University Washington, D.C.</page></plain_text>
