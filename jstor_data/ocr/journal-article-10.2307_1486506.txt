Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1992. xxi, 121 pp. Among the basic problems confronting Jewish life today are questions pertaining to Jewish survival, the determination of who is a Jew, the role (and now, also, size) of the State of Israel, and the role of the Diaspora. For the contemporary Jewish intellectual, perhaps, a more serious philosophical problem is the nature of Judaism itself. Is Judaism a timeless, universal set of beliefs and rites of passage, or, rather, is it a passage fashioned in different times and climes? Are Judaism eternal and Judaism temporal, i.e., Judaism influenced by the general intellectual and moral culture and taste characteristic of a given era, compatible, supportive, or in conflict? The question of how much Judaism is revelation and how much it is history, of course, can be traced to the literature of the Torah, the prophets, and Second Temple times. That the question is solvable in reason and revelation is suggested by an understanding of the Divine-human encounter in Abraham's soliloquy over Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 18), of Moses' persuasive demand for divine teshuvah, followed by God's retort over the Golden Calf apostasy (Exod. 32), of theodicy and the Jobean Voice out of the Whirlwind, and of the prophetic and wisdom literature; and also, in the rabbinic mind, by the dictum that "everything a scholar will ask in the future was already known to Moses at Sinai" (Tanhuma [Buber], Ki Tisa 17 [58b]; Exodus Rabbah 47.1), on the one hand, and "[We] teach more Torah [than . .] received at Sinai" (Pesiqta de Rab Kahana 12) and "[Torah] is not in Heaven" (Baba Mesi'a 58b), on the other. This was further solidified by the mystical and rationalist schools in the medieval period. Enlightenment and emancipation brought a radical departure from tra- ditional thought patterns and aspirations. In the sentiment of Mordecai Kaplan, emancipation destroyed the authority of the Jewish community and enlightenment offered ideological justification for surrendering the authority of Jewish tradition. The organic relationship of God-Torah-Israel (religion, culture, peoplehood) was now challenged by reason and egalitarianism. Count Clermont-Tonnerre's declaration to the French National Assembly in 1791, "To Jews as individuals, everything; to the Jews as a nation, nothing," and the positions adopted by the French Great Sanhedrin in February 1807, though</page><page sequence="2">238 BOOK REVIEWS bestowing equal civic rights upon Jews, began the process of redefining Jewish doctrines and values. Further, influenced by the ideas on individual self-determination and indi- vidual rights advanced by Hobbes, Locke, Kant, and others, post-emancipation Jewish savants sensed tension with their commitment to group solidarity and authority. Thus, the dilemma in modem Jewish thought indicated in the title of Michael Morgan's book and elaborated in the foreword: "how can a modem, liberal (= autonomous) Jew recognize the authority of the past, of tradition, of Halachah and rabbinic law, and of the community and, at the same time, adhere to the priority of personal self-determination, autonomy, and free decision, and hence of the present, of the individual, and ultimately of the human over the Divine?" (p. xv). The essays in this book-papers previously published or given at scholarly meetings-reveal a marvelous variety on the dilemma between reason and revelation. Chapter 1 discusses Y. H. Yerushalmi's Zakhor (Seattle, 1982), which posits that modem Jewish historiography cannot define Judaism by a priori definitions (the claim from tradition) and further that Moses Mendelssohn, in his response to Spinoza's disposal of the ceremonial law (discussed further in chapter 2), already appreciated the rupture brought about by modernity. Chapter 2 suggests that the counterpoint to Mendelssohn's point of obligatory ceremonial or ritual law (contra Spinoza's position in his Tractatus theologico-politicus) is Judaism as divine religion not in conflict with pure reason. This helped transform the conception, held by many in the Age of Enlightenment, that Judaism was a religion of ecclesiastical power, salvation, mysticism, and theology to one of reason synonymous with natural religion. Chapter 3 uncovers Mendelssohn's personal anguish, never fully resolved in his religious, political, and philosophical thinking, over the particularity of the Jew grounded in Divine Providence and liberalism. The compatibility of Jewish orthodoxy and objectivity, and the claim of a genuine Jewish philosophy, are weighed in chapters 4 and 5 on Leo Strauss as a Jewish thinker. Strauss's intellectual commitment to objectivity, universality, and Hobbesian individualism combine to rule out the latter, but his disillusionment with mid-twentieth-century secularism, including relativism, materialism, and abuses of state power, kindled for him an appreciation for the transcendent in history, not unlike M. Buber and E Rosenzweig's advocacy of less reason and more spirituality.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 239 A critique of Peter Berger's experience of "signals of transcendence" is found in chapter 6. Experiential Jewish knowledge disallows a demarcation of Judaism into the sacred and the profane-at best a unity, and at worst, an explosive but singular entity-and this in turn precludes Berger's descriptive sociological analysis from being true of Judaism. Why so? In Berger's sociological truths, as Morgan correctly observes, there is no imposing imperative (religion begins with man), but for the Jew there is obligation and accountability brought on by ethnic allegiance and/or Sinaitic religion. Morality for a post-Auschwitz world (what it is, what it is not, and what it must be) is the focus of chapters 7, 8, and 9. Shoah and history, obligatory and voluntary covenant, Hidden Face and Commanding Voice, novum and ethics are some of the concerns raised by the author in discussion with the thought of theistic Holocaustians Irving Greenberg, Eliezer Berkowitz, and Emil Fackenheim. The latter's existential position presents the question of whether religious and philosophic thought can transcend its historical setting, and this is examined in conjunction with the dialectical problems suggested by Franz Rosenzweig's Star of Redemption in chapter 10. Temporality, conditionality, and remoteness are features of modern Jew- ish expression, and the view that these have been constants in historical Jewish self-consciousness since Spinoza and Mendelssohn is defended in chapter 11. Finally, chapter 12 evaluates four stages of contemporary Jewish thought in America: the postwar religious revival; moral commitment beyond parochialism, viz., the civil rights and antiwar movements; the genteel abandonment of (Israel's) Jews before-during-after the 1967 Six-Day War, and the Jewish return, slow but consistent, to tribalistic matters of concern, in ritual, community, and education; and the current stage, back to the unfinished agenda of tradition and crises. What is proposed is a rethinking of Jewish peoplehood, nationalism, and religion as defined by the issues of continuity and change and of historicity and transcendence ushered in by the era of the Shoah and the Third Jewish Commonwealth. Despite a thesis that is at times overdrawn and repetitious, Morgan's book represents the kind of meticulous research which is in the best tradition of Jewish literary scholarship. Exegetical and literary analysis of primary and secondary sources provides direction and substance for a mature analysis of an important but elusive disputation: the hand that rocks the cradle of Jewish civilization, is it divine or human or both? The impact of this dialectic in the cultural and intellectual history of the Jews occurred in</page><page sequence="4">240 BOOK REVIEWS two accelerating waves: the introduction of biblical monotheism (revelation, theophany, commandments), sustained by rabbinic Geistesgeschichte, and the Age of Modernism (science, intellectualism, reason), which sounded for many a death knell to a belief in a personal God; the results of current efforts to make sense of the divine-human encounter in a post-Auschwitz age beyond reason and revelation will conciliate the third. But how to understand the enduring traits of revelation and memory in the Judaism of tomorrow? For some it is the fire of Torah and/or nationalism; but fire destroys what nourishes it. For others, Jewishness is the proverbial (!) Tree of Life, enriching and preserving itself by death and decay. Morgan's cogent treatise defends the latter view. He is equally interested in assigning the who and what and in understanding the how and why. Sufficient reason to highly recommend, though the irenic narrative may tax the endurance of a casual reader. Zev Garber Los Angeles Valley College Van Nuys, Calif.</page></plain_text>
