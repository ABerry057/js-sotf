<plain_text><page sequence="1">Diana Lichtenstein. Writing Their Nations: The Tradition of Nineteenth- Century American Jewish Women Writers. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1992. x, 176 pp. At first glance, this would appear to be a serviceable study of a relatively neglected portion of American literary history. Diana Lichtenstein, in her own words, has attempted "to provide a broad view of a tradition" as well as "a literary-historical context for the many American Jewish women writers who follow" (p. 9). This claim is immediately belied, however, by the proviso that the book will limit its purview mainly to "Sephardic and German Jewish women, rather than the more popularized and recognizable Eastern European Jewish women" (p. 8). Lichtenstein goes on to instance Mary Antin and Anzia Yezierska as two of the "more popularized" Ashkenazic writers whom she will not deal with. Such a scheme poses several problems. First, I am not aware of any flood of popular interest in, and comment on, writers like Antin and Yezierska. Second, how can one provide "a literary-historical context for the many American Jewish women writers who follow" in the twentieth century by systematically excluding a crucial element in the story? In fact, Lichtenstein's own scheme oddly mimics the very story she tells-that of the anxiety felt by the relatively well-established Sephardic and German Jews in the face of the huge influx of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe in the 1880s and after. Thus the plan of the book tropes its theme: the politics of exclusion. Lichtenstein ends with a chapter on Edna Ferber as the representative (German-American) Jewish woman writer of her time, in whose work "the themes of the nineteenth-century tradition metamorphized [sic] in the twen- tieth" (p. 130). If Ferber represents a metamorphosis of the anxieties and</page><page sequence="2">264 BOOK REVIEWS concerns of nineteenth-century German-Jewish-American women writers, it is a sad commentary on the way that "tradition" was moving, for her work is suffused with middlebrow enthusiasm for assimilationist boosterism that is truly embarrassing. America, Ferber writes, "is the most vital, amazing, stirring, goofy, thrilling country in the whole world, and I care about it in a Big Way" (p. 141). This is the quotation Lichtenstein uses to cap her argument: that Ferber's "own passionate pledge of American loyalty," like "the declarations of other writers in the tradition," such as Emma Lazarus's, "emanated from a spirit of allegiance to America, the country that permitted Jews to be Jews" (ibid.). Well, America "permitted" Jews to be certain kinds of Jews, it could be said; and we can follow the contours of that process in the work of Philip Roth and many other Jewish-American writers before and after him. Indeed, I think Lichtenstein missed the opportunity to choose a perhaps more interesting representative German-Jewish-American woman writer from the first half of the twentieth century--namely, Fannie Hurst, a number of whose early stories (in Humoresque, for-example) provide a more critical view than Ferber offers of the promises and problems of Jewish life in America. Lichtenstein's major claim about the plight of female Jewish-American writers in the nineteenth century, which essentially derives from the work of feminist scholars such as Carroll Smith-Rosenberg, Barbara Welter, Linda Kerber, and Kathryn Kish Sklar, is that the "myth" of the Mother in Israel, like that of True Womanhood, trapped Jewish women writers in the home and in the role of wife, mother, and the guardian of religious values, leaving them ambivalent and diffident about their literary ambitions. What Lichtenstein does not stress is that secular writing by Jews, female or male, was really just getting started in the nineteenth century. There simply was no Jewish Hawthorne (to adopt Jane Tompkins's scenario) with whom a Jewish Susan Warner or Harriet Beecher Stowe had to compete. Jewish-American women who wanted to be writers effectively needed to invent their careers from whole cloth, and they did as well as might be expected at a time when Victorian propriety circumscribed the attitudes and productions of almost all authors. It was not, in fact, her doting (albeit controlling) father, Moses, and his proper upper-middle-class Jewish home that limited the ambitions of Emma Lazarus, any more than Edward Dickinson's pure and terrible heart and restricted opinions managed to keep Emily Dickinson down. The latter's</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 265 morbid fear of public exposure was the limiting factor in her case, though of course it kept her from publishing, not from writing. Emma Lazarus largely shared that fear; but she did publish and reach out, not only to Thomas Wentworth Higginson, but also to the Emersons (Waldo, Lidian, Ellen) to Robert Browning, to Henry and William James, and to a number of other literary figures, female and male. Though Lazarus is the centerpiece of Lichtenstein's presentation of nineteenth-century Jewish-American women writers, the constricting myth of the Mother in Israel, in my view, simply did not affect her. If, to cite Lichtenstein, "as a woman and as a Jew [Lazarus] would not achieve the status of a Longfellow or Bryant" (p. 7), that probably had more to do with Lazarus's inherent limitations than with a stifling family life or with the politics of canon-making. There is little evidence to uphold the notion that Lazarus was stigmatized because of gender or race. On the contrary. As a woman and as a Jew Lazarus was considerably lionized by the presumably patriarchal literary establishment of her time. Lichtenstein's claim that Emerson's exclusion of Lazarus from his anthology Parnassus taught her "that she should never again completely trust America's rhetoric of equality for all" and "compelled Lazarus to recognize her precarious status in the world of American letters, because she was both a woman and a Jew" (p. 55), seems to me somewhat overheated. Poe and Whitman were also excluded. What conclusions should we draw therefrom? If, in fact, the politics of canon-making were vicious, venal, or invidious in the nineteenth century, the principles at work seem to me not entirely clear. It might be worth considering that in our own time of "dissensus," multiculturalism, and presumed respect for sexual and gender difference, Lazarus's work is still almost never anthologized, despite its obvious merit and importance. In all the 1,263 pages of the recent Columbia Literary History of the United States she is mentioned not once (ditto Fannie Hurst). What sort of politics are at work here?
