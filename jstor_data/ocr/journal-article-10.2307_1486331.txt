Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London: University of California Press, 1981. xxix, 235 pp. Most portrayals of the internal life of Russian Jewry until the Revolution present a skewed picture of that community. Narratives on the period up to the 1881 pogroms center on the slowly developing small minority of</page><page sequence="2">298 BOOK REVIEWS Maskilim, while works dealing with the post-1881 era focus their attention on the formation of Jewish political ideologies and mass political move- ments. Though it is readily acknowledged that the majority of Jews remained within the traditional framework, with the exception of the small Mussar movement, the life of the Orthodox masses and the functioning of traditional institutions have not attracted extensive scholarly attention. Regarding the growing nucleus of Russified Jews both within and parti- cularly outside the Pale of Settlement, the situation is not much better. One generally finds a "who's who" chronicling of Jewish notables (including apostates) who achieved some renown in Russian society, but with little analysis of how Russified Jews wrestled with their Jewish identity, with anti- Jewish discrimination, or even with the process of Russification itself. On the last point, our understanding of the difficulties involved has been deepened through the work of Alex Orbach, Michael Stanislawski, and Steve Zipperstein, all of whom have gone beyond the limited model of ideological Haskalah to look at the wider process of secularization and attempted integration into Russian society. Except for the selections in Lucy Dawidowicz's Golden Tradition, the English-reading public has had scant opportunity to know the inner world of Russified Jews first-hand. The identity problems of such Jews were no less acute than those of their accul- turated coreligionists in Germany, France, or the United States. The recently translated memoirs of the famed Russian-Jewish attorney Oskar O. Gruzenberg (1866-1940), written during his post-Revolutionary exile in Western Europe, offer some fascinating insights into the mentality of one such Russified Jew. Yesterday is not a full chronological autobiography, but with several notable gaps (e.g., on the background of his family and on his marriage), Gruzenberg presents highlights of his childhood, his primary and professional education, and his distinguished career as a defense attorney. Along the way, he treats us to a series of thumbnail sketches of notable figures of the Russian legal profession. The major theme that runs through Gruzenberg's memoirs is his involvement with the world of the law, which he portrays as an island of comparative decency and justice within the corrupt tsarist system. Here he could defend political prisoners or Jews arrested on ritual murder or espionage charges, confident that he could depend on his legal ability plus the essential fairness of Russian juries and jurists. Editor Rawson has added to the original Yesterday Gruzenberg's essay (published posthumously) on the trial of the St. Petersburg Soviet, which rounds out the list of his most important cases, and which contains incidentally Gruzenberg's views on Stalin and Trotsky. The volume under</page><page sequence="3">299 BOOK REVIEWS consideration also includes an editor's introduction which provides useful background information on the Russian judicial system and a rather less insightful introduction to Russian Jewry. A glossary of names, an annotated bibliography, and an index close out the work. Though Yesterday concentrates mostly on Gruzenberg's legal career, the student of Jewish social history will find it an interesting, if problematic, primary source. As with all memoirs, one wonders how much the views of the elderly Gruzenberg in exile have been projected back into earlier stages of his life. Even with this cautionary note aside, Yesterday opens a window on a complex inner world. The opening sentence of the memoir is most telling: "The first word that reached my consciousness was Russian" (p. 1). Gruzenberg is a Jew who carried on a lifelong love affair with the Russian language and culture, whose family marked time not in months or years, but by the appearance of a literary review or a collection of Russian verse. Characteristically, Gruzenberg does not tell us that his total immersion in Russian culture was the result of careful planning by his Maskil father (intro., p. xv). Gruzenberg's Jewish heritage (pp. 17-22) consists of personal experience of anti-Jewish discrimination, rites of mourning, and some unspecified self-study of Jewish history at the age of twenty-eight after the death of his child. As he tells it, only his exposure to the extremes of Jewish poverty in an unnamed village moved him to something approaching identi- fication with the Jewish people. Even here, though, he sees himself as a man obligated to aid all those who suffer. Since Jews had few defenders against tsarist tyranny, Gruzenberg could not abandon them, even at the cost of being misapprehended as a Jewish "nationalist." The thirteen-year-old Gruzenberg will say Kaddish for his father as an act of filial loyalty rather than piety, but will tell no one at school the reason for his daily lateness. Gruzenberg's descriptions of Jews in hs memoirs, as compared to his por- trayals of Russians, have a decided outsider's tinge to them (even after fifty years he doesn't exactly know what to make of a strange Russian convert to Judaism-pp. 13-14). Yet this same Gruzenberg refused to consider apostasy as an option, even though it meant giving up on a teaching post and serving sixteen years as a "lawyer-in-training" when Jews were denied admittance to the bar. His list of cases shows him as a devoted defender of Jews against injustice. A strange combination of affirmation and denial is at work within Gruzenberg. He is neither a model Deutscherian "non-Jewish Jew" nor a Jew totally at home with his Jewish identity. Yesterday commends itself to students of Jewish history for another reason. Gruzenberg's concise case histories of miscarriages of justice during</page><page sequence="4">300 BOOK REVIEWS World War I (pp. 125-168) present in a most vivid manner a period of Jewish suffering which has been overshadowed by the horrors of the Holocaust, but which is crucial for understanding later developments. Surprisingly, the major disappointment of Yesterday is Gruzenberg's sketchy memoir of his most famous case of all-the Beilis trial. Despite Gruzenberg's subsequent access to the secret police files relating to the case, there are no stunning revelations or insights. Gruzenberg does not even offer his impressions of the defendant Beilis. Sadly, he mentions only in passing his defense of David Blondes some eleven years before on similar charges. Detailed comparisons would seem warranted. The ironies of history are such that Gruzenberg the man of law had more of a role under the tsarist regime he despised than under its successor, and that in his exile years Gruzenberg the Russified Jew developed a more positive attitude toward Zionism. Nevertheless, Yesterday is not a work of despair or regret. It offers the historian a valuable glimpse of a type of Russian Jew that merits careful attention and analysis. Gershon C.
