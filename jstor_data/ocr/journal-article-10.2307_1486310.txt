Such an occupational hazard inevitably plagues all branches of historiography, but it is more prevalent in the efforts to unravel the mysteries of "darker" epochs, like those of Western Europe in the early Middle Ages. Not only does scanty source material limit the historian's treatment of this period, but the peculiar interests, motivations, and backgrounds of medieval writers restrict the legitimate use of the few documents which do exist. The medievalist's eye must be at once discerning and critical, careful not to overlook any evidence but wary so as not to misuse it, even if no other sources point to contradictory conclusions. With the hope of demonstrating the truth and complexities of these generalizations, this study will consider one of the most exciting and fascinating theories in all of Jewish historigraphy: the notion that the Jews of Carolingian France lived as a highly privileged group under the authority of royally appointed nesi'im-princes or patriarchs (singular nasi)- descendants of the House of David who resided in Narbonne. As we shall see, this story first appeared in documents of the twelfth and thirteenth cen- turies, but it has been retold, embellished, and evaluated by Jewish historians ever since. Accordingly, our own discussion will depart from the theory's most recent and thorough exposition in Arthur Zuckerman's work, A Jewish Princedom in Feudal France, 768-900, the preparation of which led its author through massive amounts of primary and secondary source material. Princedom asserts that the Jews of Narbonne, having collaborated with King Pepin the Short to end Moslem rule over their city in 759, received in return for their aid extensive royal grants of land and privileges, including the right to judicial and religious autonomy under the rule of their own leaders. In 768, Pepin made good on his promise when he received in a lega- tion from the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad the Davidic exilarch Natronai, also called Makhir, whom he renamed Theodoric, betrothed to his sister Alda, and installed in Narbonne as patriarch of the Jews. In so doing, Pepin also hoped to fortify his southwestern border with the Umayyad Saracens in Spain and to use the Jews to establish his kingship as the true successor to that of the Bible, both by sending them to negotiate with the Caliphate for control over Jerusalem and simply by marrying into the family of their own royal seed. Charlemagne confirmed the grants of his father in 791, and the Jewish leaders, who played crucial roles in numerous Frankish military campaigns, became still more firmly entrenched in their status as vassals and fideles of the king. Count William of Toulouse, son and successor of</page><page sequence="3">THE NASI OF NARBONNE 47 Makhir, was the same Jew Isaac whom Charlemagne dispatched on a mis- sion to the caliph Harun-al-Rashid and who arranged for transfer of authority over Jerusalem to the king, facilitating the latter's coronation as Holy Roman Emperor in 800. Thereafter, the respective heirs of king and nasi continued in this close relationship, preserving the elevated status of Frankish Jewry until the onset of the tenth century, when Carolingian rule came to an end. To evaluate this thesis thoroughly, one must consider not only those sources which deal, either directly or indirectly, with Carolingian institution of the Jewish princedom but also those which had hitherto provided our basic knowledge of Jewish life in this period. I In support of the core of its argument-i.e., that the original grants of Pepin and Charlemagne established the patriarchate-Princedom has aligned a sizeable number of primary sources in both Latin and Hebrew. The first is a letter of Pope Stephen III, written to Archbishop Aribert of Narbonne in 768, protesting that with the permission of the Frankish kings Jews owned land and employed Christians as servants.3 Because Stephen writes "sumus dolore tacti, usque ad mortem anxiati" and has addressed his letter not only to Aribert but also "omnibus potentatibus Septimaniae et Hispaniae," Princedom assumes that the point in question could be none other than Pepin's grant of a large portion of Narbonne to the Jews in ex- change for their aid.4 Quite apart from the doubtful authenticity of this letter,5 several other questions may be posed as to its real intent. Stephen writes to Aribert and all the magnates of Septimania and Spain, but nowhere does he mention the location of the land actually possessed by the Jews. Need it necessarily be situated in or around Narbonne?6 If so, it is most surprising that the pope does not demand that Aribert, himself a powerful landholder in Narbonne, undertake any corrective action. Or might the pope merely be issuing a general plea against Jewish landownership and employment of Christian 3. PL, 129:857; the letter is also reprinted in Princedom, pp. 382-83. 4. Princedom, pp. 50-58, 72-73, 86, 89, 100. 5. Migne, loc. cit., lists the letter as one of Stephen VI. S. Baron, SRH, 4:260, n. 60, sug- gests that it might have been written by Stephen V or Stephen VI, and other scholars see its origin as even later; see Princedom, p. 52, n. 8. 6. P. Carbonel, Histoire de Narbonne (Narbonne, 1954), p. 112.</page><page sequence="4">48 JEREMY COHEN laborers, possibly issued to many dioceses and included but once in the papal register? Princedom sees a reference to fulfillment of a royal pledge to the Jews when Stephen remarks: "praesertim cum hujusmodi patribus Hebraeorum promissa ab electo jurislatore illorum Mose, et successore ejus Josue, his conclusa et terminata finibus, ab ipso Domino jurata et tradita istis in- credulis, et patribus eorum sceleratis, pro ultione crucifixi Salvatoris merito sint ablata." Zuckerman concludes that "the phrase his conclusa et ter- minata finibus appears to be out of place" or else that some other words have fallen out and translates "[how much the more] those concluded and entered into for these territories." In other words, he paraphrases, "if God Himself can, in consequence of the Crucifixion, abrogate promises made to the Jews touching on eternal matters, then assuredly a terrestrial king may well do so in mundane matters."' It is possible, though, that the phrase "his... finibus" makes perfect sense without emendation, meaning not these territories-i.e., those in and around Narbonne-but rather their ter- ritories, since hic can at times denote possession.8 The promises made by God to the Jews, then, "conclusa et terminata" in their territories-i.e., Palestine-were later abrogated in punishment for the crucifixion of Jesus, and the Jewish commonwealth there was destroyed; ergo, Jews must always remain subordinate to Christians, a very standard papal demand throughout all of the Middle Ages. If this is the case, Pope Stephen might well be reacting fervently, upon his consecration,9 to no more than Jewish ownership of land and employment of Christians in Frankland in general, conditions that existed long before the fall of Narbonne.0o Princedom adduces two other Latin documents that speak of Carolingian royal grants to the Jews, both of which originated in the French monastery of Lagrasse. One is the thirteenth-century epic," Gesta Karolini 7. Princedom, pp. 10, n. 6; 17, n. 18. 8. Charlton T. Lewis and Charles Short, A Latin Dictionary (1879; reprint ed., Oxford, 1969), p. 853. 9.

As will be seen further below, Zuckerman must date the Gesta in the middle of the thirteenth century to preserve its independence from other documents containing similar stories. He acknowledges, though, that some authorities do maintain an earlier date for the epic, Princedom, pp. 61-62, 67, n. 36; see also A. Grabois, "The Legendary Figure of Charlemagne in Medieval Hebrew Sources [Hebrew]," Tarbiz 36 (1966): 31-38, and F. Ed. Schneegans, ed., Gesta Karoli Magni ad Carcassonam et Narbonam (Halle a. S., 1898), pp. 39-40.</page><page sequence="5">THE NASI OF NARBONNE 49 Magni ad Carcassonam et Narbonam, which recounts the conquest of Nar- bonne by Charlemagne. The epic relates'2 how the Jews of the city tried to convince its Moslem ruler to surrender; when he refused, they approached Charlemagne with a gift of 70,000 silver marks, offering to cooperate with him in return for self-rule under a Davidic king from Baghdad once Nar- bonne would fall. Charlemagne agreed, the Jews aided in defeating the Moslems, and the Frankish king fulfilled his promise, giving the Jews one third of the city. Acknowledging the common medieval motif of Jews betraying cities,'3 scholarly skepticism as to the historical credibility of the Gesta in particular and all chansons de geste in general,'4 and the view of many authorities that the Jews had nothing to gain by giving up Moslem for Frankish dominion,'5 Zuckerman himself admits, "the testimony of the Gesta may, of course, be relegated to the realm of fantasy."'6 Nevertheless, Princedom does argue for the validity of the document, claiming that it paints a realistic picture of Charlemagne accepting the Jews as his fideles'7 and that as an independent source, it corroborates the letter of Stephen III. In both documents, the Jews give the Frankish monarch money in exchange for his cession of land direct- ly to them.'8 Princedom posits that the Gesta has assimilated the figure of Pepin into the heroic personage of Charlemagne, who characteristically dominates the chansons de geste.19 The questions of Charlemagne and not Pepin capturing Narbonne, the Jews becoming royal vassals, and the connection between the Gesta and Stephen III's letter will all be considered further below, but it remains for us to assess the value of the Gesta account in and of itself. As opposed to the view that Pepin (or Charlemagne) gave the Jews their land and rights in Narbonne, the Gesta gives the distinct impression that they held them 12.

The section on the Jews begins, "Judei autem in civitate per- manentes in sortibus suis cognoverunt quod Karolus caperet civitat- em ... ."20 Princedom, misunderstanding the word sortibus, translates, "Ap- prised by their magic arts of an inevitable Frank victory ... .";2 how then ought one understand the word permanentes? Yet if we take sors to mean, as it indeed may,22 a free hereditary landholding, the Latin becomes clear, and the Jews emerge as having held their land before Narbonne fell. The Jews then proceed to address Charlemagne: "Preterea rogamus vos ut semper sit in Narbona rex de gente nostra, quoniam ita debet esse et est hodie. Et ex parte ipsius nos ad vos venimus et est de genere Davidis et Baldachi et mittit vobis per nos LXX milia marchas argenti."23 Again the Gesta already ascribes to the Jews what Princedom tries to prove they first received with the Frankish conquest of Narbonne. Princedom's theory also fails to accord with the Gesta's distinction between the Jews and the Frankish hero Aymeric of Narbonne, which implies, both during the battle and during Charlemagne's subsequent distribution of land, that Aymeric was not Jewish.24 Yet Zuckerman claims that Aymeric, here appearing in events of 759, is only another name for Makhir, the first nasi of Frankland, imported from Baghdad in 768!25 The historicity of the Gesta account appears altogether suspect when the Moslem ruler Matrand, in a passage not cited in Princedom, refuses to sur- render and the Jews, despite Matrand's prohibition, announce their inten- tion to negotiate with Charlemagne.26 Would they have revealed their plans of collaboration to Matrand himself?

Et Aymericus venit ad palacium regium et Judei reddiderunt ei eum et posuerunt vexil- lum Karoli superius." After the victory, Charlemagne, "sedens in palatio in sede regali ceptrum eciam tenens circumdatus infinita multitudine virorum nobilium Aymericum de Narbona fecit coram se venire dicens ei: Aymerice, terciam partem civitatis dedi archiepiscopo, aliam terciam Judeis; reliqua pars erit vestra."

The other Latin document from Lagrasse no longer exists, but Princedom refers to, though never quotes in full, a brief report of it by Alex- andre Dumege in 1829: 11 existait avant la revolution dans les archives de l'abbaye de la Grasse, un manuscrit dans lequel on lisait que, sous l'empire de Charlemagne, un roi des juifs, qui descendait de la race du prophete Daniel, poss6dait dans Narbonne un quartier de la cite, et que ce roi envoya l'an 791, a Charlemagne, une ambas- sade de dix israelites, pr6sid6e par Isaac, l'un des plus riches juifs de ce temps. Ces ambassadeurs offrirent a l'empereur soixante-dix marcs d'argent, et le prierent de conserver a leur nation la privilege d'avoir toujours dans Narbonne un roi particulier. Charlemagne acc6da ia leur demande, et leur donna en outre la partie de la ville de Narbonne oil ils 6taient 6tablis.33 Despite the similarities between this and the Gesta account, Princedom argues vehemently that they represent distinct historical sources:34 Dumege mentions the date 791; the Gesta narrates the fall of Narbonne in 759. Dumege calls the king of the Jews a descendant of Daniel, the Gesta "de genere Davidis."35 Dumege relates that the Jews paid Charlemagne 70 27. Ibid., p. 180, 11. 2367-69. 28. Zuckerman, Princedom, pp. 93-96 and elsewhere, himself emphasizes how important a role the lack of a reigning Jewish king played in Christian polemics against the Jews. Surely the two leading Christian clerics would have recognized the theological implications of allowing a Jewish king in Narbonne. 29. Princedom, p. 39. 30.

Zuckerman reports, "Dumege left no doubt that he himself never saw the manuscript in question, which apparently is now lost. He merely transmit- ted a resume of its contents."40 Nor does Dumege explain how he learned of the document-whether he heard or read of it, whether or not his informant actually saw it. Furthermore, those details which Princedom deems variants between this text and the Gesta actually do more to prove a common origin. Dumege's informant might have easily confused David and Daniel; even if not, the intent in mentioning the biblical figure in each case was to prove the Frankish Jewish ruler's royal lineage.41 The difference between 70 and 70,000 marks can be ascribed to a simple error in scribal transcription, especially since the abbreviations for both thousand (milia) and marks (marchas) would have begun with "M." The sum of 70,000 marks also seems highly unlikely; a silver mark was worth one half of a pound, and no community could have delivered a sum of 35,000 pounds and simultaneously have of- fered more.42 The different numbers of Jews in the respective delegations to Charlemagne is likewise not unreconcilable. The Gesta narrates that the Jews "elegerunt Ysaac et alios X et cum LXX milia marchas argenti eos ad 36. Ibid., p. 178, 1. 2342, and p. 180, 1. 2358. 37. Ibid., p. 178, 1. 2342. 38.

Philip Grierson, "Commerce in the Dark Ages: A Critique of the Evidence," Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, 5th ser., 9 (1959): 134, writes of the amounts of one or two thousand silver pounds, paid by cities in tribute to Justinian, that "such large sums were no doubt excep- tional."</page><page sequence="9">THE NASI OF NARBONNE 53 regem Karolum miserunt."43 Dumrge's "ambassade de dix israelites, pr6sid6e par Isaac," even without allowance for distortions of hearsay, might well have consisted of eleven men too; in each case, at the very least, the leader Isaac is mentioned separately from the group of ten envoys. Finally, any other objection notwithstanding, one small detail in Dumrge's manuscript proves beyond a doubt that it could not have been Charlemagne's lost capitulary of 791. For the documents to have been the same, as Zuckerman indicates, the 791 charter would have had to contain an account of the embassy to Charlemagne, including mention of the seventy marks of silver offered the king.44 The silver mark, however, either as a measure of metal or as a specific coin, did not enter continental Western European currency before the tenth century, when it first appeared in Cologne, and its usage in France did not begin until even later. The word "mark" itself is of Scandinavian origin; its first known usage occurred dur- ing the reign of King Osbright, a mid-ninth century pagan Norse ruler of Northumbria, and could not have entered French vocabulary before the raids and invasions of the Northmen.45 Two Hebrew sources also appear to shed light on the issue of the nasi of Narbonne. One is a lengthy gloss in the Adler manuscript of twelfth century Abraham ibn Daud's Sefer ha-Qabbalah.46 The gloss expounds upon the great community of Jewish scholars in Narbonne, deriving the origin of the community's leadership from the Davidic exilarchate in Babylonia. The text relates that at Charlemagne's request, the king (obviously the caliph) of Babylonia sent the Frankish king Rabbi Makhir, whom Charlemagne en- dowed with control over one third of Narbonne upon its capture from the Moslems and who married a local noblewoman. Makhir and the Jews of Narbonne lived under the security of royal protection, and an unbroken chain of the nasi's descendants continued to fill the patriarchate through the twelfth century. Princedom makes a great effort to establish the historicity of the SHQ gloss as well as its independence from those texts already considered. In pleading for its credibility, Zuckerman stresses several small details: the charter granted by Charlemagne to the Jews in the gloss, he writes, appears 43.

The "good laws" (buqqim lovim) of the gloss must therefore be the lost document Dumege describes, a charter Charlemagne is- sued in 791.47 Second, the gloss states that Charlemagne gave these laws "out of his love" (me-'ahavato) and protected Makhir's "property and honor" (ha-nahbalah ve-ha-kavod), which Princedom translates respectively as ob amorem and hereditas et honor-honor referring specifically to public office-phrases unique to Carolingian charters.48 And third, the gloss's mention that Makhir and his family were "close to the king" (qerovim la- melekh) Princedom interprets as common medieval Hebrew usage of that phrase to denote actual familial relationship to the ruling house;49 this suits the claim that Makhir married Pepin's sister Alda.5o On the basis of these elements in the SHQ account, Princedom dismisses the similarities between it and the Gesta, insofar as they might reveal any mutual interdependence of the two texts. Charlemagne's role in capturing Narbonne is ascribed here not to the dramatic needs of the chanson de geste but to the blending in the SHQ gloss of two historical incidents: Pepin's con- quest of Narbonne in 759 and subsequent installation of Makhir with Charlemagne's confirmation of his father's grants in 791.51 The division of the city between Makhir, Aymeric, and the archbishop constituted an addi- tion to the story several centuries later, when various factions were vying for power in Narbonne.52 Princedom also dates the SHQ gloss in the twelfth century, well in advance of the thirteenth century Gesta.53 The reliance on the SHQ gloss's description of Charlemagne sealing but not signing his charter and use of phrases supposedly unique to Carolingian privilegia depends almost entirely on the assumption that Charlemagne did indeed issue the Jews a charter in 791, the manuscript in Dumrge's report. We have already demonstrated, however, the impossibility of a document of 791 containing the details of Dumrge's story. (And Dumege's report, it will be recalled,did not date the document in 791 but only reported the incident as occurring then.54) Moreover, mere mention that the charter was sealed 47.

Zuckerman dates the SHQ gloss before 1195 and probably closer to 1160 because the nasi Qalonymos, whom the gloss describes as "still alive and young" ('odenu hai u-vabur),62 died in 1195, a conclusion drawn since he no longer signs of- ficial documents with "his associate Levi b. Moses" after that year.63 Yet the SHQ gloss also recounts the genealogy of another branch of the patriarchal family, beginning with Rabbi Moses the Parnas, the brother of the present nasi's grandfather, and ending with Rabbi Moses' great-grandson, also named Moses.64 Where does Levi ben Moses enter the picture?

Furthermore, the gloss speaks of this second nasi Moses as already dead: "there was none like him in his time as great sage, rabbi, and judge." How could this Moses be dead and the nasi Qalonymos, a generation older, be "still alive and young"? If "bahur," which Zuckerman has translated as "young," here really means strong, exalted, or healthy,65 Qalonymos might be a very old man-the only way to understand "'odenu bai u-vahur"-and the document could have originated much closer to the beginning of the thirteenth century.66 Some scholars, as we have seen, date the Gesta in the very early 1200s, or still earlier; and even a thirteenth century date for its composition makes certain the previous existence of the folk traditions em- bodied in it. The problems we encountered in trying to date the SHQ gloss raise the possibility that it represents an amalgam of several distinct documentary traditions that do not accord perfectly with each other-e.g., genealogies for two different dynastic branches of the patriarchal family. Zuckerman too es- pouses this view67 in order to read out of the gloss the division of the city into three parts among Aymeric, the archbishop, and Makhir, a motif also found in the Gesta.68 (And as with the Gesta, Princedom does not consider the textual distinction between Aymeric and Makhir; they are completely separate personages.) The accuracy and internal unity of the gloss become even more suspect when we weigh the facts that the gloss was not a product of ibn Daud's pen but a later forged addition to Sefer ha-Qabbalah and that the manuscript containing the gloss dates from late fifteenth century Provence.69 It thus could well have undergone the influence of the same 65. For such a meaning of -nrn see commentaries of Ibn Ezra to Exodus 14:7 and Psalms 89:20 and of Rashi to Song of Songs 5:15; see also Eliezer Ben Yehuda, A Complete Dictionary of Ancient and Modern Hebrew [Hebrew], 8 vols.

Just as Princedom overlooked the effects of non-historical epic tenden- cies in the Gesta account of Narbonne's fall, so too does it fail to evaluate the literary nature and intentions of the SHQ gloss. The gloss appears very close to the end of SHQ, just as ibn Daud finishes his history of the Spanish rabbinate and right before he recapitulates and concludes his entire work.70 The discussion of Jewish leadership in Spain aimed to establish the con- tinuity of the genuine rabbinic tradition from the Babylonian academies to the Iberian Peninsula, and ibn Daud begins it with the story of four Babylo- nian rabbis taken captive at sea, two of whom eventually reached Spain and rose to positions of communal leadership there.7" As the most recent editor of SHQ concludes, this tale "is a fiction and was probably not intended by its author to be read as factual history."72 For "ibn Daud felt that fables were a means to a higher end .... Historical facts as such were probably of little value to him."73 In very much the same way, the Provencal author of our gloss proposes the independent and prior legitimacy of the rabbinic authorities in Nar- bonne, who retrace their own lineage to Babylonia even farther back in time than the captive rabbis.74 To do so, he draws upon a well known legend, which did not have to be historically correct as long as it served his purpose. While we shall investigate the motif of King Charles and the Jews slightly further below, suffice it here to note several elements shared by both the gloss and ibn Daud's tale of the four captives: In each, the local monarch welcomes the new rabbi from Babylonia,75 a nasi heads the local Jewish community,76 and the discussion ends with the observation that local scholarship has since fallen from its zenith.77 Reference to Charlemagne's bequest to the Jews occurs also in Milhzemet available to Rabbi Abraham Zacuto while writing a similar work in 1510.

Princedom's claim for the authenticity of this source relies completely on two textual details. It translates the royal promise, or havtahbah, to the Jews as securitas, a technical term alluding to Charlemagne's alleged charter of 79180-the assumption for which, as we have seen from Dumege's report, is entirely unfounded-and the statement that the Jews fought together with Charlemagne and his successors "faithfully" (be-'emunah)8' as fidelitas, describing a lord-vassal relationship between kings and Jews.82 Once more we shall postpone our consideration of the Jews as royal fideles and deal immediately with the overall applicability of the Milbemet Misvah to Zuckerman's thesis; as in several of the previous documents, there are discrepancies. While Princedom aims to establish the king's grant to the Jews of Narbonne-i.e., those in the city at the time of the siege-Meir speaks of the Jews as present among the ranks of Charlemagne's attacking army. The Jews, writes Meir, have lived under royal protection "for a long time, since the days of King Charles up to the present, as he and his succes- sors captured many territories, all with the physical and monetary assistance of the Jews, who aided them faithfully and who themselves entered the thick of battle, giving up their lives to save the kings and magnates who were with them."83 Meir's story appears to possess the same legendary character as the 78.

These three sources and Dumege's manuscript share numerous similarities; they all originated in southern France probably over the span of no more than a century. Is it not likely that they all were influenced, as Princedom sug- gests,88 by a local tradition, but yet one which might have been more legen- dary than factual? Charlemagne appears countless times in medieval Hebrew literature; as does no other medieval monarch, he alone plays an important role in Jewish folklore, and many different accounts tell of his settling Jews in his kingdom.89 Not only do some of these sources mention locales other than Narbonne, but scholars have shown how the figure of Charlemagne often represents other kings who followed him.90 Jewish sources also underwent 84.

On the basis of an eleventh century Latin account of a Jew Qalonymos, the name attributed by the SHQ gloss to many of the Narbonnese nesiim, who sacrificed himself to save Emperor Otto II,91 much like the incident in Milbemet Mi4vah, J. Aronius maintains: "Was bei Otto II historisch ist, ist durch die Uebertragung auf Karl Miirchen geworden. Dieses Miirchen, in einer Fassung nur Familiensage, ist in Narbonne entstanden, vielleicht infolge absichtlichen Endichtung, viel- leicht nur durch die Einwirkung anderer dort heimischer Sagen, mit denen es denn verbunden worden ist."92 More recently, A. Grabois has advanced the interpretation that the SHQ gloss and Milbemet Misvah combined Jewish traditions with the local Provencal hagiographical view of Charlemagne as seen in the Gesta of Lagrasse. Because twelfth century Narbonnese Jewry did have considerable landholdings, the author of the Gesta felt obliged to account for their seigneurial rights. Aware of Stephen III's letter, he gave them their treacherous role in Narbonne's fall. But just as his view of Charlemagne emanated from his twelfth century literary needs, so his description of the Jews derived from their status in the Narbonne of his day: owners of allodial lands who had to pay a special annual tax.93 The author of the SHQ gloss, argues Grabois, must have had the Gesta account available to him. Then in the next century, Meir ben Simeon's rendition of the story included the new thirteenth century feudal custom of a lord rewarding the heirs of a vassal who has fallen heroically in battle.94 Grabois concludes: From an examination of the subjects of the legend of Charlemagne in medieval Jewish compositions, we realize that this legend did not develop on the basis of the actual deeds of the Frankish emperor. The authors of the medieval Jewish sources adapted to their needs the echoes of his legend as they 91. lohannes M.

Sed ea preteriens, suscipere hunc recusavit. Ille autem littoris presidia petens, invenit adhuc ludeum stantem, seniorisque dilecti eventum sollicite exspectantem."

Accordingly, there was no possibility of exposing the legendary figure of Charlemagne to a Jewish frame of reference until it had been created among the nations of Europe.95 Whether or not one may accept all the particulars of Aronius' and Grabois' arguments, their general thrust confirms our analysis of the sources: while the Jews may have held land in and around Narbonne even from before Carolingian times, nothing as yet warrants the conclusion that Pepin and Charlemagne did indeed institute a Jewish princedom there, granting the Jews extensive legal privileges. It is true, however, that the SHQ gloss includes several particulars not contained in any other of the docu- ments thus far examined. These details, the figure of Makhir and the patriarchate of Narbonne, along with Princedom's corollary evidence, de- mand further scrutiny. Who was this Makhir, who the SHQ gloss states came to Narbonne, answering a Frankish request to the caliph for a descendant of the Jewish royal House of David? Can this incident be confirmed by any other piece of evidence, or must we relegate it too to the realm of the legendary? Zuckerman subscribes to the former alternative and calls attention to Rabbi Sherira Gaon's tenth century epistolary history of the Babylonian academies, which mentions that around the year 770, the Davidic exilarch Natronai was deposed and came to the West.96 Princedom alludes to variant readings of France (Sarefat) and Spain (Sefarad) for 'Iggeret Rav Sherira Ga'on's reference to the West (Ma'arav), argues that from the perspective of the Babylonian Sherira any one of these terms could have applied to Nar- bonne, and concludes that Natronai and Makhir are one and the same.97 Stating that "it is well known that the exilarchs of Baghdad frequently had at least two names," Zuckerman feels he can equate the two personages because "Makhir would emphasize the biblical lineage of Natronai."98 And since a written question posed to Rabbi Hai Gaon states that Natronai 95.

In the case of Spain (Sefarad), Zuckerman has confused the editor's in- terpretation of the West (Ma'arav) with a variant reading, 101 but with regard to France (Sarefat), it is impossible to determine the origin of Zuckerman's error. H. Graetz and L. Ginzberg both agree that Ma'arav refers to the Maghreb, a name for Moslem North Africa, or at best Moslem Spain, and that Natronai could not possibly have emigrated to Frankland.'02 The same responsum that speaks of Natronai's hurried trip to the West reports that he arrived in Spain, not France, and that he subse- quently returned to Babylonia!103 Moreover, while Princedom understands Sherira's account to state that Natronai had already served as exilarch for several years, Graetz and Ginzberg show otherwise. Sherira's remark, "he had been exilarch for some years previous to this," refers not to Natronai but to a different person.104 Natronai himself was a usurper, deposed by a joint session of both Babylonian academies and exiled by the Moslem caliph.'05 Despite Zuckerman's belief that Natronai changed his name to 99.

In any case, when at times Sefarad and Sarefat are confused in geonic texts, neither one ever refers to Provence; see Henri Gross, Gallia judaica (Paris, 1897), p. 537. One might note that Zuckerman's reference to this passage, Princedom, p. 81, n. 16, (1) refers only to the introduction to Sefer ha-'Ittim by its editor Jacob Schor and (2) confusingly connects this reference to a passage in the text of Sefer ha-'Ittim, p. 256, without at all informing the reader of this. 104.

Yet if Makhir's existence does not emerge as a verifiable, historical fact, the patriarchate of Narbonne as an institution does. Not only does the author of the SHQ gloss list genealogies of known families of nesiim, but Princedom also brings three other twelfth century sources that mention them. Their existence at that time no one may deny; but do they appear, as Zuckerman maintains, to be accepted as the unique descendants of Jewish royalty, holding the allegiance of Jews in those lands whichhad comprised Carolingian Frankland? Benjamin of Tudela visited Narbonne in 1166 and wrote in his travel log that the present nasi Qalonymos, whom the SHQ gloss also mentions, "descended from the seed of David as recounted in his family tree,"'0' and had received properties from the local rulers. Princedom next adduces a statement of Peter the Venerable, who had written of the Jews twenty years earlier, ridiculing them for not having their own king: "As for me, I will not accept that king (as something worthy of ridicule) whom some of you claim to have in Narbonne, the city in Gaul, others in Rouen. I will not accept a Jew as King of the Jews except [one] residing in and ruling the Kingdom of the Jews."'8 And third, Princedom refers to a direct quotation of a monk named Theobald, a convert from Judaism-and thus supposedly a more reliable source-in Thomas of Monmouth's work on St. William of Norwich: "Wherefore the chief men and Rabbis of the Jews who dwell in Spain assemble together at Narbonne, where the royal seed resides, and where they are held in the highest estimation ...."109 Beginning with the third of these documents, we find that the evidence has been misused. Thomas of Monmouth does not quote Theobald directly 106. If Natronai would have sought a biblical name to emphasize his Davidic lineage, why Makhir and not a name emanating from the House of David? Makhir was the son of Manas- seh, the son of Joseph; see Numbers 26:29. 107. Marcus N.

Moreover, the key word in this ex- cerpt must be that the royal seed resides in Narbonne, but this word does not appear at all in the Latin text, and the nineteenth century translators have added it in brackets."' From the context, one need not conclude that the "semen regium" dwelled in Narbonne. Princedom also gives the impres- sion that it is the royal seed which is "held in the highest estimation," but the Latin "et eorum maxime viget gloria" makes it clear that it is rather the Jewish notables, the plural antecedent of eorum, as opposed to the singular semen. One might well discount the credibility of this statement altogether in consideration of the viciously anti-Jewish character of Thomas' whole work, written to record the first medieval charge of ritual murder against the Jews, which here portrays the annual convention of a world-wide Jewish con- spiracy to murder Christian children. Princedom has similarly omitted a key sentence from its quotation of Peter the Venerable. After Peter refuses to accept those who purport to be kings in Narbonne or Rouen, he adds: "I declare that I shall not accept as king of the Jews just anyone living in Gaul, Germany, the Far East, Africa, Aquilonia, or wherever Jews may live.""2 With this included, Peter implies that there exist such personages who claim to be of Jewish royal descent wherever Jews reside and that the patriarch of Narbonne might not be such a unique case. Indeed, the modern editor of Bpenjamin of Tudela's diary translates the Hebrew word nesi'im in the description of Narbonne neither as princes nor as patriarchs but simply as "illustrious men.""' We recall 110. Thomas of Monmouth, The Life and Miracles of St. William of Norwich, ed. Augustus Jessopp and Montague R.

Narbonne was no exception. S. Baron comments on such medieval Jewish leaders throughout the diaspora: Whether adopting the same titles of princes of captivity (or, more proudly, of all Israel) and geonim, or resuscitating the ancient designations of nasi and nagid, the provincial chiefs claimed supreme authority in their respective do- mains. Even when an Egyptian nagid declared that he held sway over the peo- ple of the Lord "by permission of our master the exilarch under whose royal sceptre we and all of Israel come, and all of us gain our strength through the true God and the authority of his princely office, may it be elevated," it was but a literary flourish and may not even have referred to the Babylonian prince of captivity.'I5 The patriarchate of Narbonne did exist in the twelfth century, but neither with the origin nor the international prestige that Princedom ascribes to it. II Although they do not deal explicitly with the Jewish community of Nar- bonne, Zuckerman argues that various other documents confirm the ex- istence of the patriarchate and of the privileged class status of the Jews dur- ing Carolingian times. Of these, we would do well to consider three Hebrew and two Latin sources. First, Princedom cites a midrashic interpretation of Genesis 49:10, "The scepter shall not depart from Judah nor the ruler's staff from between his feet until Shiloh comes . . .," which applies this often messianically under- stood verse to a character named Makhir."'6 This exegesis is presently found in several texts of Bereshit Rabbah, whose modern editor, Ch.

While other manuscripts did include excerpts from the later, European work, Albeck places the redaction of the corpus in which Makhir appears in Palestine of the fifth century."9 He could not have entered the text in a Carolingian setting. Second, Princedom calls upon a medieval Jewish apocalyptic work en- titled 'Aggadat Rabbi Yishma'el, which predicts that the messianic era will arrive 700 years after the beginning of Roman dominion in Palestine.'20 The editor of this document, J. Even Shemuel, maintains that the apocalypse originated in Palestine, and because of the lack of any Moslem influences in it, has to have dated from the end of Byzantine rule there in 638. This would suit the calculation of the text, since the Romans under Pompey had taken Jerusalem seven centuries earlier, in 63 B.C.E.'21 Zuckerman, on the other hand, figures 700 years from the destruction of the Temple, giving the apocalypse a date of 768, and concludes that it was written with the knowledge that the Davidic Makhir had arrived from Baghdad and was about to assume leadership in a newly formed Jewish princedom, symboliz- ing the end of Roman rule over the Jews.

Zuckerman has also erred in stating that no one has yet been able to determine the identity of this Makhir. Albeck himself, Bereschit Rabba 3:1258-59, offers two possible explanations: that this Makhir was (1) the son of Manasseh, who begged Hezron, the son of Judah, to marry his daughter (1 Chronicles 2:2 1), or (2) the son of Ammiel who received David during his flight from Absalom (2 Samuel 17:27ff.). Either would fit the context of the midrash, which notes about Makhir "that he came and prostrated himself" (nithabbel) before the feet of a descendant of Judah, the son of Jacob being blessed by his father in Genesis 49:10-in this case Hezron or David.

Byzantium, as ruler of Palestine, was a Christian nation as well as a goi naval, which might not have to connote barbarians but possibly, as in one talmudic usage, those who do not accept Judaism.'28 The Byzantine Emperor Heraclius, who tried to rid his empire of Judaism and whom Even Shemuel calls "the Amalek of the eve of the end of days," reigned from 610 to 641 and would have provided the author of the apocalypse with a much more recent Haman.129 (A mid-eighth century Frankish author probably could not have been alive to remember the decrees of any Visigothic king.) And the oncoming Arab onslaught in the Levant, which drove the Byzan- tines from Palestine, could have been viewed as the imminent conflict among Gentile peoples; for even Princedom emphasizes how this kind of apocalyptic literature had to have immediate relevance in order to achieve its propagandistic objectives.'30 Princedom holds that the aggadah was writ- ten after Natronai-Makhir had arrived in Frankland via Marseilles early in 768 and had journeyed to his winter quarters in Metz,'3' but before Easter 122.

Still more important, it is a grave error to label a Davidic exilarch the Messiah ben Joseph. In Jewish messianism, this figure comes as a precursor to a Davidic messiah and has to be slain before the lat- ter may arrive; for two kings could not share one throne, and only the Davidic messiah represented true royalty.'33 The last Hebrew document we shall consider is a letter from Frankish Jewry (Qehillot FranSia) begging an unnamed Jewish dignitary to help secure the end of colaphization, a practice whereby the Jews of Toulouse, in punishment for allegedly once betraying the city, had to supply the Church every Easter with thirty pounds of wax; he who delivered the offering received an often injurious blow on the throat.'34 The reference to the ad- dressee as nasi,'35 the writer's interruption of Jeremiah 51:5 right after the word "Judah" when he turns to describe the addressee,'36 and the writer's descrip- tion of the dignitary as "a choice and excellent plant" (neta' muvhar u- me'ulleh-as if from the seed of David),"'7 all lead Zuckerman to conclude that the letter is addressed to the nasi of Narbonne and affords us an exam- ple of his great influence. This is corroborated by reference to a similar story in an eleventh century biography of Bishop Theodard of Narbonne, in which the Jews try to enlist the support of one Duke Richard against the colaphization.'38 Princedom emends the text, reading Bernard for Richard and Count for Bishop, the office of a Bernard whom the hagiographer does 132.

Princedom admits that "the compiler of the Vita in its present form is... desirous of glorifying his hero Bishop Theodard of Narbonne (885-893) at the expense of the Jews."'4' In particular, writes Zuckerman, "all students of the Vita agree that its charge of treason against the Jews of Toulouse, whom it represents as having surrendered that city to the Saracens, is purely fictitious."'42 As for the text of the letter, the term nasi could have referred to any Jewish dignitary; the quoting of only a seg- ment of a biblical verse in place of the whole was common Jewish practice and need not have been of particular consequence in the case of Jeremiah 51:5;143 and nothing explains why a "choice and excellent plant" must refer to the scion of David. Moreover, Zuckerman never adequately answers the arguments of J. Mann, who first published the letter, for identifying the ad- dressee as Hisdai ibn Shaprut. Mann considers the possibility of the dignitary being a nasi of Narbonne but rejects it because the letter seems to be directed by French Jewry as a whole to a Jew abroad. Narbonne was much too close to Toulouse for the writers to designate themselves collec- tively as Qehillot FranSia-and, for that matter, for them to explain the process of colaphization as if the addressee may not have been familiar with it.'44 Instead, because this letter was found in the Cairo Genizah with other correspondence of HIisdai and because the ambassadors of the nasi here are identical with those who served Hisdai elsewhere, Mann feels confident in asserting his conclusion.'45 139.

Four of Louis' extant charters concern Jews; from them Princedom tries to establishI46 that the Jews of Frankland collectively enjoyed a very privileged legal status, to the extent that Jewish notables entered into bonds of fidelitas with the king, a relationship reserved for the most respected of royal vassals and supposed- ly hinted at in the Gesta and Milfhemet Misvah. Zuckerman stresses that "there was no substantive differentiation in the legal status of all Jews in the Carolingian Empire of this period,"'47 in order to demonstrate that the Jewish community at large, under the leadership of the Narbonnese nesiim, received official recognition and a degree of political autonomy. The first of these charters in the imperial formulary, issued to a Rabbi Domatus and his kinsman Samuel, takes these two Jews under imperial protection, allowing them "secundum legem eorum vivere."'48 Zuckerman maintains that the charter applies to other Jews as well, because in forbid- ding Christians from harming its recipients, it proclaims: "neque vos ipsi praedictis Hebreis hoc ulterius facere praesumatis neque iuniores vestros ul- lis facere permittatis";149 the word ullis supposedly refers to Jews other than Domatus and Samuel.0so Yet in making this equation, one must not overlook the lack of any possible antecedent for this indecisive pronoun other than "istos Hebreos," "memoratos Hebreos," "suprascriptos Hebreos," or "praedictos Hebreos,"-i.e., Domatus and Samuel themselves. Moreover, this clause appears within the limited context of the ban on Christian attempts to baptize Jewish slaves and cannot apply to the other privileges in the charter. Princedom similarly argues that the next charter in Louis' formulary, granted to several Jews of Lyons "cum pares.eorum,"'5' applies generally to all Jews of that city, pares meaning peers. 52 Likewise, the third grant issued to Abraham of Saragossa'53 is said to protect the Saragossan Jewish com- munity, because it affords judicial protection in cases "adversus eum vel 146.

But even in Carolingian times, commendatio and oaths offidelitas were technical terms denoting very well defined processes. To be precise, for one to become one of these power- ful royal fideles he had both to commend himself into royal hands, a secular act, and to swear a special oath of fidelitas or fealty to the king, a religious rite performed over sacred relics. While not all those who performed com- mendatio swore fidelitas, every fidelis did.162 After Charlemagne became emperor, every imperial subject in 802 had to swear allegiance to him in a formula that superseded the process prescribed in a decree of 781;'63 the new 154.

Abraham of Saragossa very conspicuously did not take any oath of fidelitas to Louis; he therefore did not become a fidelis.'68 Rather, throughout the three charters, this term appears in its generic sense of one who is simply faithful to the king.'69 The fourth charter, not contained in the imperial formulary,'70 Zuckerman agrees concerns only individual Jews. "That is so because it in- tended to replace an earlier document of which they had been forcibly deprived."''7 Princedom then views the three formulae, because of similar contents and phraseology, as reflecting a no longer extant capitulary of Louis the Pious concerning the Jews mentioned in the Lyons charter,'72 which supposedly confirmed Charlemagne's "lost" capitulary of 791.17' And the resultant approach toward the Jews as a single privileged class is apparently verified in a charter to a group of non-Jewish merchants,'74 164.

And final- ly, there is no reason why the lost capitulary of Louis would have to be a confirmation of that of Charlemagne in 791; for we have seen that no evidence at all exists for such a grant on the part of Louis' father. Rather, it is more probable that the lost capitulary would have confirmed still existing edicts of Charlemagne'77 dealing entirely, as would befit the reference to the capitulary in the Lyons charter, with judicial procedure.'78 As Kisch and, in Zuckerman's words, "virtually all students of the subject" conclude, the charters of Louis the Pious apply only to individual Jews;179 neither do they depict Jews as fideles, nor do they disclose the contents of any capitulary Charlemagne might have issued in 791. The last documents of consequence that Princedom discusses are letters of Archbishop Agobard of Lyons, which according to Zuckerman "outline the power and function of the Nasi of the Jews in the 820s."180 During this decade, Agobard wrote five letters that dealt with the Jews-two to cour- tiers of Louis the Pious, two to Louis himself, and one to the archbishop of Narbonne.'88 In them, the prelate complains primarily of the haughtiness and arrogance of the Jews toward Christians, of undue royal protection of the Jews that often led to the persecution of Agobard at the hands of the imperial missi and magister ludeorum, and in particular of a royal ban on Christian missionizing among Jewish slaves. Zuckerman posits that Agobard attacked the Jews primarily on account of their ownership of lands which once, believed the archbishop, had belonged to the Church. The Jews were well represented among the key honorati whom Agobard challenged on such grounds at the Imperial Diet in Attigny in August, 822; he did not 175.

Rather, Agobard directed his offensive at the Jewish slave population, hoping to get at Jewish land by eliminating its labor force.'82 The royal charters of which Agobard claims the Jews boast, maintains Princedom, are confirmations of the privilegia of Pepin and Charlemagne in 768 and 791. The magister ludeorum, whom Agobard calls Evrardus, Zuckerman identifies as Heribert, the son of the Count of Toulouse/Nasi of Narbonne William-Isaac and himself a well paid highly dignified government official living at the imperial court in Aix.'83 This summarizes Princedom's interpretation of the letters, but what have they taught about the Jewish patriarch? Not once does Agobard mention him, not even in his letter to Narbonne. Princedom stressed the alarm of Pope Stephen III in 768 at the theological implications of the patriarchate;184 should not Agobard, famous in history for his anti-Jewish prejudice, have reacted at all similarly? One marvels further at the fact that Agobard never in his letters refers to "illegal" Jewish landholdings, in Princedom's view his prime target. Agobard hated the Jews; not only did he cry out at their arrogance toward him, but he wrote a long tract to King Louis'85 outlining how the pious in the history of the Church spurned the Jews and a letter to a fellow archbishop urging practical discriminatory measures against them.'86 Had Jews been present at Attigny in 822 among the lay honorati, a man like Agobard would have had no compunctions about maligning them publicly; his silence hints, as some authorities con- clude,'87 that the Jews did not hold much land under the Carolingians. 182.

Princedom, p. 97; here we find a major contradiction in the logic of Zuckerman's argu- ment. In the same breath, Princedom, pp. 93-99, he discusses (1) the taunts of the Christians at the Jews, based on Genesis 49:10, denying legitimacy to Judaism since it could not boast of a ruling king and (2) how the patriarchate of Narbonne helped satisfy the Jewish need for such a prince (a fact of which Pepin was aware, p. 109). How would a Christian monarch, who, ac- cording to Zuckerman, pp. 29-34, himself desired to be the sole successor to the Davidic kingship of the Old Testament, have allowed the Jews to pursue their own messianic goals at his expense?

For Agobard, who viewed holding the Jews in disrepute as a religious obligation,'88 wrote that he would be willing to honor the magister if the lat- ter would return the kindness; amidst such mutual respect, the only possible argument would arise "propter augmentum doctrinae," hardly a matter he would take up with a Jew.'89 And twice Agobard refers to Evrardus as one of the royal missi,190 positions which Jews probably would not have filled. An evaluation of Zuckerman's use of the French chansons de geste,'19 from which he learns-all because of the identification of Makhir, sup- posedly dubbed Al-Makhiri, with the Frankish hero Aymeric of Narbonne'92-the genealogy of the nesiim, their role in Frankish relations with the Caliphate, and their involvement in Carolingian royal politics, lies outside the purview of this study. Yet it is hoped that our consideration of the documents allegedly having direct bearing on the Nasi of Narbonne as well as those pertaining to the general status of Jews in Carolingian France can justify two kinds of conclusions. First, with regard to our specific knowledge of Frankish Jewry, it is indeed probable that Jews did own some land during the Carolingian period and did receive, on an individual basis, some special privileges from the kings. By the eleventh or twelfth century, Jews clearly did refer to the leaders of their community in Narbonne with the title of nasi. Nevertheless, none of the available evidence argues for the existence of any extensive privileges enjoyed collectively by Frankish Jewry during the eighth or ninth centuries or the elevated status of any Jewish dignitary in the Carolingian court. Second and perhaps more significant is the methodological point driven home by theories like this one. Close examination of the twelfth and thirteenth century sources mentioning the nasi has revealed their authors' common geographic origin, contemporaneous access to popular legends of the founding of the Narbonnese patriarchate, and peculiar ulterior motives for adopting them: the Gesta's rationalization for Jewish landholding, the 188.
