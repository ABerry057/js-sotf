<plain_text><page sequence="1">TRENDS IN THE STUDY OF MEDIEVAL HEBREW LITERATURE by DAN PAGIS Hebrew University The vast body of premodern Hebrew literature is usually termed "medi- eval"-a somewhat misleading term, partly based on the assumption that in most countries the Jewish Middle Ages lasted until the Emancipation in the eighteenth century. However, as is well known, this literature was by no means monolithic. It comprised such disparate schools and styles as por- tions of the liturgy dating back to late Roman times, the Palestinian and Eastern piyyut (liturgical poetry) of the Byzantine and Moslem periods, the famed Hebrew-Spanish school and its ramifications or parallel schools in Provence, North Africa, Turkey, and the Yemen, other important centers like Germany and France, and an entire millennium of Hebrew poetry in Italy whose later stages coincided with, and were influenced by, the Renais- sance and the Baroque. Israel Davidson's monumental bibliography, en- titled in English Thesaurus of Hebrew Mediaeval Poetry,' actually spans more than a millennium and a half, or, as its Hebrew title states, "from the canon- ization of the Bible to the beginning of the period of Enlightenment" (in the late eighteenth century). Alternative terms to "medieval" seem scarcely clearer; "postbiblical" tacitly and misleadingly excludes the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, while "premodern" includes the Bible. 1.

At different periods, Hebrew literature developed in a variety of centers- from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean, and from Egypt to England. While one center was beginning to rise, others were flourishing or declining; still others had vanished. They were not united by a single tradition, not even as far as their most obvious common factor-the use of Hebrew-was con- cerned, since various schools at various stages used different historical layers of Hebrew or introduced linguistic innovations of their own. Hebrew litera- ture based itself on several major traditions, and continuously modified them in language, theme, genre, form, rhetoric, and poetics. This wealth and complexity confronted the scholars with serious metho- dological problems, further complicated by the physical state of the material and the oblivion into which it had fallen. The scholars had first to salvage the texts from scattered and fragmentary manuscripts, to clarify their pro- venance and age, and to establish the best possible reading and the identity of the author. To a great extent these tasks, still far from being completed, occupied the first generations of scholars, who devoted themselves to textological and his- torical, rather than literary, research. The study of medieval (or postbiblical and premodern) Hebrew litera- ture-mostly poetry and to a lesser extent rhymed narratives, drama, poetics and prosody-goes back to the Wissenschaft des Judentums of the nineteenth century,2 when such luminaries as Zunz and Steinschneider, among others, turned their attention to it, although they often combined it with other Judaic studies. In our century the study of this literature emerged as a field in its own right, though not always cultivated according to its own needs. In the last forty years or so it seems to have flourished. J. Schir- mann, in his annual bibliographies, The Study of Poetry and Piyyut,3 which deal with the research done since 1948, has already listed'some three thou- 2.

Though comparatively few are important contributions, most reflect a general awakening of interest which, in Israel, transcended the scholarly realm and to a certain degree affected the general reader. Israeli readers began to enjoy the grandeur and sublimity or the humor and wit of medieval poetry, which was made accessible to them by Schirmann's Heb- rew Poetry in Spain and Provence4 and other anthologies, and was inter- preted for them in critical essays. Some poems were set to new music. Yehuda Sommo's sixteenth century Comedy of Marriage, probably the first real Hebrew play, was revived on Israeli stages. Immanuel of Rome, Alha- rizi and other medieval authors of maqdmas supplied the material for plays and musicals. From the turn of the century, poets too were attracted by their medieval predecessors: Bialik by Yehuda Halevi and other Spaniards, Tchernichowsky and later N. Altermann by Immanuel of Rome, and Fich- mann and Leah Goldberg by such Renaissance poets as the then newly dis- covered Yoseph Zarphati, to cite only a few examples. However, despite all its scholarly achievements and (unintended) literary impact, the study of medieval Hebrew poetry still has a long way to go-or rather several long ways, in different, though related, areas. I shall confine myself here to four of the most important. 1. Textology In 1924, in the introduction to his Thesaurus, Israel Davidson wrote: Just as the Jewish people are scattered the world over, so is the religious poetry of the Jews scattered among thousands of volumes, buried in obscure manu- scripts, covered over with the dust of ages, hidden in the remotest corners, dis- jointed, distorted, neglected and unknown. And the fate of Jewish secular poetry is even more deplorable. For a great part the liturgy has at least been kept intact by the Synagogue, while the secular poetry has had no such guard- ian to protect it from oblivion.5 Since the 1920s, however, the editing of texts has greatly advanced. From the literary fragments of the Cairo Geniza alone many scholars, among 4. Ha-shirah ha-'ivrit bi-Sefarad u-vi-Provans, 4 vols. (Tel Aviv-Jerusalem, 1956; 2d ed., 1972). 5. 'Osar, English preface, p. xxxvii.</page><page sequence="4">128 DAN PAGIS them Davidson, Zulay, Schirmann and Spiegel deciphered and edited a large amount of unknown works and brought to light poets who had been forgotten for centuries. On the other hand, until recently, the salvaging, cataloging and editing of Geniza literary fragments progressed in a rather haphazard manner. As is well known, this vast treasury contains, para- doxically, mainly torn and incomplete manuscripts which, following tradi- tion, were stored up when they were no longer in use. Since the manuscripts had been acquired by various collectors and libraries, many poems had to be reconstructed from minute fragments dispersed in different countries and even continents. Bibliographical and textual data were scarce and not read- ily available, and misreadings and oversights could not be avoided. Even Davidson's Thesaurus, which relied mainly on printed books, and system- atically listed some 35,000 poems according to their incipits, often mistook slightly different versions for different poems and overlooked others, al- though Davidson conscientiously supplied several important addenda.6 As far as manuscripts were concerned, the situation was even worse. From the Geniza alone, the literary material is so vast, varied and dispersed that sys- tematic results can only be achieved through comprehensive surveys. Gone are the days of Solomon Schechter who ardently but quixotically attempted to master the material almost single-handedly. Only systematic teamwork can really cope with it, yet most scholars still seem reluctant to share their work with others. There have been, however, several notable exceptions. The first was the Institute for Research of Hebrew Poetry founded by Schocken in Berlin, later transferred to Jerusalem, and now unfortunately defunct. From the 1930s to the 1950s, H. Brody (its director), J. Schirmann, M. Zulay and A. M. Habermann collaborated in textological, bibliographical and literary endeavors, and published, with others, seven volumes of texts in the Studies of the Research Institute for Hebrew Poetry.7 In the late 1950s a Microfilm Center was founded at the National Library in Jerusalem which now houses photocopies of Hebrew manuscripts from collections the world over. The literary part of this material led to the foundation of a new Research Institute of the Piyyut in the Geniza, sponsored by the Israel Academy of 6. Vol. 4, a supplement to vols. 1-3, was published in 1933; an additional "Supplement to the Thesaurus," Hebrew Union College Annual 12-13 (1937-38): 715-828, is also included in the second edition of the 'OSar (1970) at the end of vol. 4. 7.

Here the fragments or complete poems which run into tens of thousands are listed not only by their incipits (as in Davidson's Thesaurus) but also by their form, rhyme, refrain, acrostic, genre, and other data. The correlation of this data enabled the Institute, within four or five years, to reconstruct hun- dreds of poems, to supply many better versions of already published texts, to discover forgotten authors, and to trace important stages in the develop- ment of liturgical poetry, mainly in the East. Among several collections pub- lished by individual scholars before the establishment of the Institute, J. Schirmann's New Hebrew Poems from the Geniza8 is outstanding in the variety and importance of the material and in its detailed study. The histori- cal material in the Geniza, too, held in store some literary surprises. Here the most dramatic discoveries were made by S. D. Goitein. Along with his studies of the records pertaining to Jewish society and culture he published autograph letters of Yehuda Halevi and letters relating to this famous poet which shed light on the last years of his life, his late poems and his journey to Eretz Israel.9 For all its importance, the Geniza is only one of many literary treasures still hidden. Hundreds, if not thousands, of unknown poems are to be found in codices and even in printed books-mah.zorim with piyyutim, poetry collections, and other sources from various periods and centers, in- cluding Western and Eastern Europe. Their systematic study has barely begun. However, in the last decades textological research has also produced several important editions of individual authors. In 1938 Zulay collected and published the works of Yannai, the great paytan of early Byzantine Palestine, discovered only in this century.'0 Important Ashkenazi and early Italian Hebrew authors have been edited by Klar, Habermann, Urbach and others. " Major discoveries were made even in the famed Spanish school. 8. Jefim Schirmann, Shirim hadashim min ha-genizah (Jerusalem, 1965). 9. S. D.

S. Sassoon in 1934 in an unvocalized version. Samuel Hannagid suddenly emerged not only as a major figure among Heb- rew-Spanish poets, but as the literary father of them all. In the late 1940s and early 1950s vocalized and annotated editions of his Ben Mishlei and Ben Qohelet were published by Sh. Abramson and of his divan by A. M. Habermann; a more extensive edition of the divan was published by D. Jar- den in 1969.12 It was not until much later that a reliable edition of Ibn Gabirol's poetry was available. The Bialik-Rawnitzky edition of the 1920s, though influen- tial, was inadequate, since the editors had to rely on garbled versions and less than reliable sources. A few years ago, Jarden published a new two-volume edition (still incomplete) of Gabirol's liturgical poetry. It is an irony of edit- ing history that Gabirol's secular poetry, previously published in part and in mutilated versions, was not made available until 1975. When it finally appeared, however, it did so in two rival editions, one by Jarden, and the other, which includes the main extant source (Schocken MS 37), by Schir- mann, who had begun this work forty years ago, in collaboration with Brody.'3 Other poets too had to be very patient indeed. Moses Ibn Ezra's secular poetry was splendidly edited and annotated by Brody. The first volume of this edition appeared in 1935 in Germany; the second was printed in 1942 in Jerusalem from galleys salvaged from the Nazis; but the third appeared only in 1977, more than forty years after the completion of the editor's work.14 Moses Ibn Ezra's Kitcb al-mukhcadara wal-mudhdkara, the main poetical treatise of the Hebrew Spanish school, written in Arabic in about 1135, was generally known only in the fluent but free 1923 Hebrew version of Ben Zion Halper.

Among recently collected works of individual authors are E. Fleischer's editions of Shelomo ha-Bavli and of the so-called Anonymous Paytan,'6 I. Levin's first volume of his edition of Abraham Ibn Ezra's devotional poetry," and A. Mirsky's edition of Yose ben Yose, the first paytan known by name.'8 The list is much longer. Unfortunately it does not include the most famous Hebrew medieval poets, each the leading poet of his own school: Eleazar ben Kalir (or Killir), the prime figure of the Palestinian piyyut, famed and sometimes denigrated throughout the ages, and Yehuda Halevi, the "sweet voiced," "national" poet of the Hebrew Spanish School and probably the best known of all. Kalir has profited from many years of de- voted work by Shalom Spiegel but still awaits publication. Yehuda Halevi was edited by Brody at the turn of the century in a rather inadequate man- ner.'9 Brody had intended to revise this edition, but he died in 1942, with his plans uncompleted. To this day most editions of Halevi are either garbled reprints of Brody's or selections from it. But then, Bialik's works too still await a complete and reliable edition. 2.

Most of the technical, preliminary studies necessary for all engaged in the final evaluation are still missing. In the course of the last decade the situation has improved somewhat. Several technical preliminary studies have been added, as well as broader surveys dealing with the evolution of themes, forms, and genres throughout long periods of time, yet limiting themselves to certain aspects or parts of lit- erature.2' An all-embracing literary history still seems a long way off. In the nineteenth century and up to the 1950s most attempts at literary historical surveys were either incidental chapters in general Jewish histories or seemingly specific works which nonetheless conceived their subject in the broadest possible sense and described poetry, narrative and drama together with purely philosophical, exegetical, and halakhic writings. What is more, they sometimes confused literary with social and cultural history or with biographical notes. When referring to poetry proper they rather tended to accept the evalua- tion of medieval authorities and to use them as historiographical evidence. For example, Albarizi in the Tahbkemoni22 humbly referred to his own gene- ration in Christian Spain as mere followers of the great classical Andalu- sian tradition. Modern scholars promptly repeated this view and branded postclassical poets in Christian Spain as epigones of Andalusia. But Alba- rizi's modesty was more or less conventional. He himself also expressed the opposite view: in other passages of the same book he proudly and justly laid claim to literary originality,23 as did later postclassical poets like Todros Abulafia.24 However, the main problem was not the overlooking of such details. Sweeping generalizations about periods and trends had their root in a deeper acceptance of authority. Some scholars set up classical, i.e., Anda- lusian examples of style, form, and genre as aesthetic and historical criteria. For example, in the rich and yet confined realm of rhymed narrative Alba- rizi's Tabkemoni, the most typical "genre-pure" Hebrew book of the 21. E.g., Ezra Fleischer, in Shirat ha-qodesh ha-'ivrit bi-yemei ha-beinayim (Jerusalem, 1975), traces the development of this poetry from its beginnings and its relation to the liturgy in Eretz Israel, the Eastern diaspora, Spain, Italy, Germany and France; Dan Pagis, Hiddush u-masoret be-shirat ha-bol: Sefarad ve-'lalia (Jerusalem, 1976). 22.

Other books of rhymed narrative were judged by their proximity to the "pure" genre, the closer the better. Thus there evolved a cyclical concept of ascent (authors preceding Alharizi), climax (Albarizi himself) and decline (the subsequent centuries) which was largely a fallacy. The development of Heb- rew rhymed narrative is more complex and does not yield to such general- izations. It comprised several genres, some only slightly related to, or completely independent of, the Alharizi-Alhariri pattern. They followed other Arabic or Christian-European patterns, and indeed often produced innovations of their own. Several of those quite remote from the typical maqdma are among the most delightful. In a wider circle of references, the entire postclassical poetry and fiction of Christian Spain was considered inferior to that of Andalusia, although it, too, produced original poetry, more humorous and varied than that ofthe refined and aristocratic Andalusian School. In a still wider circle of reference, the entire Hebrew-Spanish school was considered a criterion for other centers, such as Italy. Hebrew poetry flour- ished in Italy for more than a thousand years, from the ninth to the end of the nineteenth century. Although it absorbed many elements from Spain in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, it developed, from the fourteenth cen- tury onwards, its own special style, which blended Hebrew-Spanish ele- ments with ever increasing Italian influences in forms, prosody, imagery, themes, genres and poetics. Thus the Hebrew-Italian school, from the fourteenth century onwards, at various stages reflected the early and high Renaissance, the Baroque, and the Arcadia school. It also absorbed ele- ments from the Spanish poetry and verse-drama of the Siglo de Oro, brought over by Spanish or Portuguese Marrano poets who escaped to Italy or Holland and reverted to Judaism. All this went to produce strikingly varied poetry (with almost no trace of Andalusia), like that of Jacob Frances, recently collected by Pnina Naveh,25 and that found in other Renaissance and Baroque Hebrew-Italian works published by Schirmann more than forty years ago.26 And yet Hebrew-Italian poetry is still consi- dered by some scholars as deriving mainly from medieval Andalusia with only traces of the early Renaissance. Indeed, we even come across this view in the Encyclopedia Judaica of 1971. 25. Kol shirei Ya'aqov Frances (Jerusalem, 1969). 26. Mivbar ha-shirah ha-'ivrit be-'ltalia (Berlin, 1934).</page><page sequence="10">134 DAN PAGIS Historiographical concepts referring to treatises on poetic theory seemed to be even more vague. Let us consider briefly the case of Meteq sefatayim, a treatise on poetics written in 1678 by Immanuel Frances, brother and fellow- poet of the above mentioned Jacob. Immanuel not only explained and illus- trated the use, in Hebrew poetry, of Italian forms like the sonnet, the terzina, ottava rima and canzone, all of which involved a break with Anda- lusian prosody, but also expressed the essentially Baroque poetics of barifut (i.e., acutezza), and encouraged a nonclassical use of talmudic and later Hebrew in poetry. Yet, when this book was first published by Brody at the turn of the century,27 the German scholar Martin Hartmann attacked the edition, and dismissed the treatise itself as well as its predecessors in six- teenth and seventeenth century Italy as mere repetitions of classical, Anda- lusian poetics.28 In Hartmann's view, Abraham Ibn Ezra's twelfth century normative arabizing prosody was the ultimate fixed law for one and all. He did not realize that it was precisely the development of Hebrew prosody in Italy, as revealed by Frances, among others, that most clearly reflected the dynamics of the center. But Hartmann's view still seems to be tacitly accepted, and post-Andalusian poetics were not found worthy of special study. Evaluative historiography, then, adhered to rationalistic, neoclassical standards: careful measure, clear though ornamented style, purity of genre, symmetrical structure, purism in the use of classical (i.e., biblical) Hebrew to the exclusion of later layers, strict adherence to grammar, precise (i.e., quan- titative Andalusian) meters and forms. The dynamics of Hebrew literature were largely ignored. Schirmann once said of Hebrew literary medievalists that they were too immersed in details to see the forest for the trees. We may add that even when they looked around they seemed to see a petrified forest rather than a living one. 3. The Study of Literary Sources and its Limitations The study of literary sources has long been a traditionally favored pur- 27. Immanuel Frances, Meteq sefatayim [written 1678], ed.

Hartmann (Frankfurt, 1894).</page><page sequence="11">MEDIEVAL HEBREW LITERATURE 135 suit, taking many forms, such as the meticulous listings of biblical verses used in a work (even of incidental phrases not serving as allusions); listings of foreign sources (mainly from the Arabic)-motifs and formulations borrowed from poems, proverbs and so forth or, in the field of rhymed narratives, the enumeration of parallels covering scenes or entire plots. The pursuit of sources as such, obviously important for cultural history, is only a preliminary stage in literary study; yet it was often confused with the main task. Many interesting sources have been brought to light, but seldom used in analysis and interpretation. An important exception is the famous "mosaic" style, which has been acknowledged as an original creation in which biblical quotations often changed or even reversed their original meaning, sometimes for humorous purposes.29 But nonbiblical sources were mainly listed without any literary comment. Such lists seemed to imply that much of medieval Hebrew literature was a net of borrowings, not to say plagiarisms. But if we reexamine the parallels within their context, we per- ceive that these borrowings, too, were in fact used for new purposes, and acquired a new significance in the later work. Thus it is important to note that Yehuda Halevi, for example, based one of his devotional poems on an Arabic love poem.30 However, it is no less important to note, first, that he did not make an exact translation, but rather rephrased a given motif adding a completely different conclusion, and, second, that he transposed the motif from secular to divine love, thereby entirely changing its meaning and, in fact, creating a new poem altogether. It is, of course, true that much of medieval poetry was openly and inten- tionally based on literary conventions, but the concept of originality was scarcely less vivid than it is today. Poets and writers used to complain about plagiarists or defend themselves against charges of plagiarism, though the border between legitimate and illegitimate borrowings ran along different lines from those that we are used to. Even rhetorical improvements of given formulations, if used in a somewhat different context, were granted the status of originality; but this concept, as stated in Moses Ibn Ezra's Poetics, was only the given minimum. In fact originality transcended subtle varia- tions in rhetorical texture and manifested itself more clearly in structure, intent, ideas, themes, and genres. Most studies of sources, then, content, as it were, with the mere discovery of parallels and borrowings, often missed 29.

Occasionally they even seemed to obscure the obvious structure and argument of a work. For example, Zabara's Book of Delight3' is con- sidered a prime example of misogynist literature because it includes some fiercely antifeminist stories, mostly known from other sources; among them is the story of the Matron of Ephesus, used by Petronius in his Satyricon and by various medieval authors. And yet, within the context of Zabara's book this and other such stories actually reverse their argument. They are put into the mouth of a scheming villain who tries to set a simpleton against his wise and faithful wife by defaming the character of woman in general. The sim- pleton realizes the truth only when it is too late. In the context, the narrator takes great pains to emphasize the reversal in argument, but scholars ignored this, since they considered the Book of Delight to be a compendium of independent fragments loosely held together by a frame-story; however it has in fact a central original plot, in which various borrowed stories are in- cluded to function as relevant parts. The half-truths of mere source-listing shrink even more when such list- ing is found to be only selective. One study on Hebrew-Spanish dirges presents them mainly as a derivation from the Arabic dirge of pre-Islamic (Jahiliya) and early Islamic times. But the Arabic influence came from later Abbasid and Andalusian poetry rather than from the Jahiliya; more to the point, the Hebrew-Spanish school often harked back to biblical models as well. This is particularly true of dirges. Hebrew-Spanish dirges clearly blended Arabic elements with the ancient Jewish tradition of this genre and constantly alluded to, or quoted from, biblical dirges like David's lament on the death of Saul and Jonathan, and from talmudic dirges, like Bar Kipok's "If a flame fell on cedars." There were moreover other relevant aspects to the genre. For example, the social and religious function of many dirges, and incidentally of wedding songs as well, placed them at the border between secular and liturgical poetry. For this reason dirges and wedding songs were the only nonliturgical genres of the Andalusian school that occasionally neglected the strict Arabic forms, rhyme schemes and meter that were obli- gatory in all secular poetry of the school; instead they used the freer and more varied forms and prosody of the piyyut. Even when we deal with sources alone we cannot grasp the essence of this school except as a synthesis between biblical and Arabic sources, and occasionally talmudic, Far East- ern and European sources as well. But we should stress the transformation 31. Joseph Ibn Zabara, Sefer sha'ashu'im, ed. Israel Davidson (New York, 1914; 2d ed., 1925); The Book of Delight, trans.

We are concerned not only with what is common to many works, but also with what is specific to the single work, including the specific use it makes of its sources. 4. Literary Analysis of Medieval Hebrew Poetry and the Study of its Poetics In his above mentioned address, J. Schirmann also raised certain prob- lems concerning literary analysis and evaluation. For many of our scholars, the study of Hebrew poetry has merely served as a means of clarifying important facts in other fields. . . . The valuable studies undertaken in Hebrew poetry (as far as they exist) are nearly all on border- subjects of literary research, such as history and linguistics, while the only real aim of the student of poetry is the analysis of a poem as a literary and artistic creation. To build on a firm foundation, he has to prefer certain works and ignore others. What are the tools that he can summon to his aid? From the Middle Ages until the beginning of modern times, an antiquated "poetics" held sway among us, which itself deserves to be investigated . .. and which has not yet entirely disappeared from the writings of our literary critics. For a number of years now, there has been an upheaval in literary research in Europe and successful attempts have been made to bridge the generations and to apply new methods of examining the literary writings of old. Let us hope that we shall arrive at a similar change in the field of Hebrew literature. But we shall have to proceed carefully and with circumspection, since a mechanical transfer of foreign concepts to the sphere of Hebrew writing is liable to lead to a distortion of its image. These remarks were not aimed at the scholarly work which had already been done on stylistic and formal aspects. M. Zulay had brilliantly com- pared the Kaliric and the Saadianic styles from a philological standpoint;32 A. Mirsky had detected formal prototypes common to the midrash and the ancient piyyut.33 More recently, E. Fleischer traced the development in genres, forms, and style of the piyyut in the light of its liturgical function in various periods and rites.34 But such studies were rare and, moreover, did 32.

As for straightforward literary criticism, the situation was as dismal as Schirmann had described. In this field, too, several attempts had already been made at the time to analyze and evaluate medieval Hebrew poetry, especially that of Spain. But besides textological problems-some early analyses had been based on cor- rupt texts and insufficient data-the very methods of analysis and evalua- tion had to be clarified. From this point of view the attempts at literary criticism can be roughly divided into three groups. One group included impressionistic and evalua- tive essays written by critics whose main concern was modern poetry, and, in their more lighthearted moments, by medievalists who usually dealt with textological or historical issues. Their impressions and evaluations differed widely even with regard to one work or poet, variously described as, say, pedantic and stern or youthful and passionate. Moreover, some of the critics used the ancient material to restate their own views on contemporary lite- rary issues. Tchernichovsky's book on Immanuel of Rome, Yaakov Stein- berg's article on Moses Ibn Ezra, or Franz Rosenzweig's profound analyses of Yehuda Halevi's poems seemed to belong to modern Jewish literature or philosophy, rather than to impartial scholarship, while many peripheral evaluations could be altogether dismissed. Another group focused on medieval poetics from a relativistic view- point. Its first prominent representative was David Yellin, who in his book Torat ha-shirah ha-sefaradit35 considered medieval rhetorical norms as the main method for the analysis of medieval poetry and the main criterion for its evaluation. Yellin relied on the tropology with which Moses Ibn Ezra concluded his aforementioned Poetics, but to a certain extent con- fused tropology and literary theory, ignoring the fact that Ibn Ezra himself devoted more space to general theoretical discussions than to the list of topics and figures. Thus, even though Yellin provided a valuable handbook, he limited himself, as did some of his followers, to definitions and illustra- tions of medieval rhetoric (torat ha-qishutim), and barely touched upon other aspects. This seemed to amount, in practical criticism, to a mere enu- meration of tropes and figures-a simplistic approach which often missed the poem itself. A third group of critics which emerged in the 1950s and 1960s and whose 35.

It intro- duced a severely "intrinsic" approach, a close reading of the single poem and its analysis. This trend, derived from the school of New Criticism and its followers, had successfully been introduced in the study of modern Hebrew poetry. However, in the medieval domain, Zemach and some others, while relying on Schirmann's observations about "antiquated" medieval poetics, went much further and denied the relevance to literary analysis not only of medieval poetics, but also of historical perspective in general. They pro- claimed that each poem, regardless of its period, was either timeless as litera- ture or not worth the trouble.36 Thus, though showing flashes of critical insight, they attributed to medieval poems modern devices and concepts which, at least in part, were incompatible with the text. Schirmann rejected the seemingly outdated and mechanistic medieval poetics as being too limited for analysis and modern evaluation; on the other hand, he cau- tioned against a too free use of modern criteria. Just where the golden mean was to be found remained an open question. The problem should now be redefined, and distinction made between tools for analysis and norms for evaluation. We can analyze a medi- eval poem by examining texture and structure, themes and tone, tradition and innovation, regardless of our own literary taste. Even though the results of the analysis may not conform to our taste, because the specific style examined is remote from present day concepts, we can understand the text and the poetic theory which it implies. Here, as elsewhere, poetic theory is not absolute and timeless, but on the contrary historically specific. Within Hebrew literature alone there were several essentially different poetics. Each reflected and affected its contemporary poetic practice by both describing its norms and prescribing them according to its own concepts, of which some were clearly stated while others were only implied. The concept of the poem as ornamented speech or a cunning artifice was essentially incompatible with, say, the concept of the poem as an inspired self-expression. Such con- flicting views had far-reaching implications concerning styles, forms, or genres. Thus the specific poetics of a specific school or trend was not only relevant for analysis but indeed one of its major foundations. Besides, the poetic treatises were not as mechanistic as they seemed. Hebrew-Spanish poetics, for example, was richer by far than the tropology explained by Yel- lin; it also discussed broad issues in the light of the particular secular poetry 36.

True, during the Middle Ages such isses were not system- atically examined, and others no less important, like structure or genre con- ventions, were barely touched upon. However the basic assumptions of the theory shed light on these issues, too, in the coloring of the school. If Moses Ibn Ezra's two treatises on poetics had not survived, they could have been partly reconstructed, on the basis of the poetry of his time, but of course with much less certainty. Wherever there was formulated normative poe- tics, the poetry was never oblivious to it. Indeed, practically all Hebrew theoreticians in Spain and Italy and elsewhere were poets in their own right and often referred to their own works along with those of others. They were also aware of discrepancies between theory and practice, and their reaction to this varied, depending on how they viewed tradition and convention and on how flexible they were in their normative demands. In any case, the ten- sion between poetry and poetics was in itself an important aspect of this literature.37 In the analysis as distinct to the contemporary evaluation of premodern Hebrew poetry we should, then, make use of the various treatises on poetics, even though they are fragmentary. They are not primitive documents of one static theory, but specific reflections of specific periods and centers. Yet the study of poetics and its interaction with the poetry of its period has been hitherto limited to the Golden Age of the Andalusian school,38 which, though extremely influential, did not reign supreme. An important desideratum is the elucidation of individual styles. They 37. The poets' awareness of the tension between theory and practice was a measure of poetic trends in different periods. Compare, for example, Moses Ibn Ezra (ca. 1138) who apo- logized for not being able to realize all norms he himself had prescribed (Mub4l/ara, fol. S15=Shirat Yisra'el, p. 156=Sefer ha-'iyyunim, pp. 218-21) with, say, seventeenth century Hebrew authors in Italy and Holland who encouraged formal and rhetorical innovations trans- cending the Hebrew-Spanish norms-e.g., Samuel Archivolti, 'Arugat ha-bosem (Venice, 1602), pp. 118-19, Joseph Jedidiah Carmi, Kenaf renanim (Venice, 1626), fol. 3a; Solomon Oliveyra, Sharshot gavlut (Amsterdam, 1665), pp. 37-38. A clear break with Hebrew-Spanish tradition in the name of poetic freedom was proclaimed by Moses Hayyim Luzzatto (Rambal) in a manuscript of his Leshon limmudim (before 1727), ed. A. M.

As is the case with the literary study of schools and poetics, the sty- listic study of individual authors, too, has only recently begun. Much, then, has still to be accomplished. The delay, or even neglect, in the literary study of Hebrew premodern poetry, narrative, and poetics, was partly due to technicalities-textological problems, the sheer amount and diversity of the material, and the small amount of work devoted to it as compared with other branches of Judaica, but the delay was also due to lack of clear critical methods and a rather static approach which quite obscured the great vari- ety of the field. Whether we deal with general trends or with a single poem, we should always see them in the dual light of tradition and innovation, authority and revolt. Medieval Hebrew literature was at times magnificent, at other times limited, disrupted by calamities and fighting for existence; but it always underwent change, because it continued to live.</page></plain_text>
