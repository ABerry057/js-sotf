<plain_text><page sequence="1">David N. Myers. Re-inventing the Jewish Past: European Jewish Intellectuals and the Zionist Return to History. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995. viii, 278 pp. Re-inventing the Jewish Past is an outstanding work of both institutional and intellectual history. It offers a pioneering narrative of the Hebrew Uni- versity's Institute for Jewish Studies and throws new light on the intellectual biography of those who taught there. The thread linking the institutional and intellectual components of the book is the relationship between historicism, historiography, and nationalist ideology in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Of the many theories of nationalism which have been voiced over the past two decades, David Myers favors those that emphasize the role of the intelligentsia in inventing (Eric Hobsbawm) or imagining (Benedict Anderson) national communities. Myers finds particularly useful the ideal type of the Western-educated colonial native who creates a national historiog- raphy by appropriating the colonial power's discourse about his own society and producing new conceptual structures, informed in part by indigenous traditions, but also by his own bifurcated identity. Indeed, the divided identity of the colonized intellectual is essential to Myers's analytical framework, for he sees modem Jewish scholarship, from the Wissenschaft des Judentums through the products of the Hebrew University, as suffering from a "split personality" (p. 21): a divided commitment to Western scholarly norms, on the one hand, and the preservation and celebration of Jewish collective identity, on the other. Much of the first half of the book is a well-crafted history of the Institute for Jewish Studies from its founding in 1924 to 1948. Myers's graceful narrative is especially admirable given the fragmented state of the archival materials with which he worked. Myers nicely traces the multiple conflicts that surrounded the Institute from the beginning, e.g., between those who wished</page><page sequence="2">264 BOOK REVIEWS the university to be a research institution and those who favored an emphasis on teaching; between traditionalist rabbis on the diaspora-based administrative committee and iconoclastic scholars like Joseph Klausner in Jerusalem; and between Chaim Weizmann, seeking maximal Zionist Organization control over the Hebrew University, and the university's chancellor, Judah Magnes. Hopes for rational and planned development of the university were stymied, as in so many other cases in the history of the Yishuv, by a lack of funds and constant crises, such as the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, which transformed the IJS into a rescue station for German Jewish scholars. Political infighting also took its toll; debates over the acceptability of modem biblical criticism delayed the introduction of Bible studies until 1938, thirteen years after instruction in Talmud had begun. In the second half of the book, Myers moves on to a close analysis of the scholars associated with the IJS during its first decades. His analysis centers around three issues: uniformity (whether a master narrative, in particular a pronouncedly Zionist one, united their work), novelty (to what extent their scholarship truly represented a paradigm shift, a rupture with the Wissenschaft des Judentums), and objectivity (whether their rejection of the apologetic intent and tone of Wissenschaft in fact resulted in detached scholarship). As to the first issue, Myers states emphatically that the scholars of the IJS did not form a school, and that major ideological and methodological differences divided them. They were not all staunchly Zionist. Those who were rarely championed the biblicism, Palestinocentrism, and scorn for the diaspora which characterized stereotypical Zionist ideology. In a chapter devoted to Yizhak Baer, Myers points to this historian's attachment to religious as opposed to political history and to the Middle Ages as opposed to the biblical period. A chapter on Ben-Zion Dinur, whose nationalist sentiments were less nuanced than Baer's, notes Dinur's glorification of the diaspora community as a repository of the Jewish Volksgeist, which, Dinur believed, was now coming to rest in its original and natural home. The second and third issues, those of novelty and objectivity, are closely re- lated. Historiographical revolutions, Myers notes, claim to break cleanly from previous paradigms, but continuity, in fact, does exist. True, the Jerusalem scholars, like Jewish historians throughout the world in the early twentieth century, rejected the literary and theological bias of the Wissenschaft des Judentums and incorporated analyses of social and economic factors in the shaping of Jewish history. But they retained the Wissenschaft's illusory ideal that the study of the Jewish past could be both critical and detached, on</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 265 the one hand, and a catalyst for a revived Jewish culture, on the other. In an analysis of the literary critic Baruch Kurzweil's notorious critique of Gershom Scholem, Myers asks, "How could [the Jerusalem scholars] claim to apprehend the past as it actually was if their primary objective was to reshape the visage of contemporary Judaism? And how could these 'spiritual leaders' reshape Judaism when their critical methods produced so many contextualized Judaisms?" (p. 173). Indeed, Scholem, perhaps the most brilliant of the Jerusalem scholars, and the subject of the final chapter of Myers's book, could not offer a new, unifying Jewish myth, because an ironic approach to myth precludes engagement with it. For Scholem, Zionism offered only a process, an entree into innovative ways of thinking about Judaism, but this was a process which, by the terms of its existence, could have no telos. Paradoxically, the Jerusalem scholars claimed objectivity in their schol- arship in order to implement a nonscholarly agenda. For example, Baer's obsession with the allegedly corrosive effects of emancipation and material prosperity on modem Jewry deeply influenced his scholarship on Christian Spain. He scathingly depicted the Jewish upper classes in medieval Spain as oppressive toward the pious Jewish common folk and as assimilationist to boot. Just as the practitioners of Wissenschaft des Judentums had their bogeyman, Hasidism, and could claim objectivity by mistakenly equating self-criticism with detachment, so did Baer pillory upper-crust Sephardic Jewry in order to attack certain trends in contemporary Western Jewish society. In Baer's scholarship, as in Dinur's, the piety of the common man preserves the Volksgeist. Hasidut, whether in the form of the scattered pietists of the Second Temple period, the elite mystics of medieval Germany, or the mass movement in modem Eastern Europe, was perceived as a great reservoir of national energy. In general, the institutional and intellectual components of Myers's book blend well together. Myers could have made more of the origins of the institutional separation, favored by many of the IJS faculty, of Jewish history from that of the rest of humanity. Myers claims that the division of Jewish, European, and Middle Eastern history into separate units at the Hebrew University reflected "idiosyncratic patterns of institutionalization" (p. 112, n. 19), but such a pattern has counterparts elsewhere. (At South Korean universities, for example, "national," "western," and "eastem" history are all taught out of separate departments, with pride of place accorded to the first, and with profound methodological differences dividing the three.) Also, although</page><page sequence="4">266 BOOK REVIEWS there are passing references throughout the book to the Jerusalem scholars' teaching activities, both its institutional and its intellectual components would have been strengthened by a somewhat more substantive discussion of the scholars' pedagogic activities. As Myers is well aware, Re-inventing the Jewish Past is a child of our era. "My own work," he writes, "takes shape in the age and spirit" of the "post-Zionist" age (p. 12), in which a new generation of Israeli historians has attempted a critical reassessment of the origins of the state, and the Zionist ideological assumptions which informed previous scholarship have been called into question. Indeed, there are interesting parallels between the Jerusalem scholars and the "new Israeli historians" of the past decade. Like the Jerusalem scholars, the new historians have asked questions which previous generations of scholars avoided, and have produced scholarship of enduring value. But, also like the Jerusalem scholars, the new historians claim to be radically innovative and objective, when, in fact, they owe much to previous scholarship and are no less ideologically engaged than their predecessors. Regardless of these and other presentist implications, Re-inventing the Jewish Past is, ultimately, an elegy for interwar European Jewish culture and the brilliant scholars which it produced. Although the book traces the familiar route "from Berlin to Jerusalem" of the IJS scholars, it also has much to say about the less-known (albeit less exotic) route "from Berlin to Cincinnati" taken by the likes of Eugen Taiubler. In its range, erudition, sensitivity, and graceful presentation, this book represents a singular contribution to our understanding, not only of Zionist history, but of modem Jewish history as a whole.
