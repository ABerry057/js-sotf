<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jon D. Levenson. The Death and Resurrection of the Beloved Son: The Transformation of Child Sacrifice in Judaism and Christianity. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1993. xiv, 258 pp. For decades biblical scholars have debated whether human sacrifice was practiced in ancient Israel, the flames of argument fanned by apologetic concerns. On one side are those who deny the very possibility of such an abomination, on the other those who see allusions to it in a variety of biblical passages. This book belongs squarely in the second camp. As its author bluntly observes: "Israel did not always abominate the sacrifice of the firstborn son, and some biblical passages are best taken as an endorsement of the practice" (p. 126). At the same time, Jon Levenson goes considerably beyond simply taking sides in a long-standing debate. In a creative move, he manages to</page><page sequence="2">130 BOOK REVIEWS turn what is usually regarded as an embarrassment into the Bible's central theme, and even that of subsequent Judaism and Christianity, by tracing the ways in which human sacrifice came to be replaced by a variety of other practices, including circumcision, the levitical priesthood, monetary ransom, naziritehood, the Passover sacrifice, and in Christianity the death of Jesus, as well as narratives relating to them. In his own words: "A basic element of the self-understanding of both Jewry and of the Church lies in stories that are the narrative equivalent of these ritual substitutions-narratives, that is, in which the firstborn or beloved son undergoes a symbolic death. .... The beloved son is marked for both exaltation and for humiliation" (p. 59). "This transformation . . . metamorphosized a barbaric ritual into a sublime paradigm of the religious life" (p. x). Predictably, the Aqedah story (Genesis 22) plays a central role in this process, centering as it does on God's command that Abraham sacrifice his favorite (ydhfd) son. (To his credit, Levenson usually defines the theme as the sacrifice of the favorite or beloved offspring rather than of the firstborn, since birth order is ambiguous in several of these accounts; as he notes, paternal favoritism often springs from a father's preference for a particular wife, e.g., Sarah, Rachel, and Bathsheba, rather than the child's relative age.) So read, the Aqedah becomes the Bible's substitution narrative par excellence. Despite the novelty of this treatment and its conceptual appeal, it is not the only way the Aqedah story can be or has been interpreted. Indeed, the very weight which rests on it in Levenson's construction is one of his book's potential weaknesses, particularly since Genesis 22 need not be understood as legitimating human sacrifice. After all, Abraham's act is not presented as ordinary behavior, something that could or should be expected of every Israelite, but rather as an extraordinary response from one whose obedience to God reached an unparalleled level. Nor must the ram be understood as a substitute for Isaac. The narrator's statement that Abraham offered the ram instead of his son could mean that Abraham reverted to more ordinary ways of expressing gratitude and subservience to God rather than that the animal was intended as a formal substitute for his son. A further problem has to do with the inferences drawn from the various "sublimations" of child sacrifice that are uncovered here. To be sure, the Bible does present some of these as substitutes for human sacrifice, but that does not mean that human sacrifices had ever actually been required, but only that these other practices were understood as making it unnecessary ("If we did not do these things, then we would have been expected to sacrifice our children .. .").</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 131 This is most apparent in the case of the redemption of firstborns (Exod 13:13, 34:20). Although this may have come to be connected with their exemption from the priesthood (Numb 3:12, 8:16), the Bible contains no evidence that they had ever actually functioned as priests, nor does it claim that they had. Rather, the narrative suggests that they were (theoretically, at least) supposed to have served in this capacity but were exempted from it in this way. To be sure, such practices may then be considered theological ideals, but that is far different from saying that they ever took place. Similar arguments can be applied to circumcision, naziritehood, and the other practices which Levenson regards as having supplanted firstborn sacrifice. Levenson frequently sees the root ntn ("give"), which may refer to sacrifice in Exod 22:28, as implying a connection between child sacrifice and various other practices and passages (on p. 48 he describes it as "a telltale verb"). However, as the debate about the existence of human sacrifice clearly shows, the word does not literally mean "sacrifice," nor is it limited to such contexts. For example, it is also applied to the transmission of property (Gen 24:36, 25:5, Job 42:15, cf. 2 Chr 21:3), which could equally well provide the conceptual background for many of the passages cited here. This book contains much that is valuable beyond its central thesis, including incisive readings of many individual biblical passages. An example of these is the way in which it challenges the common view that Genesis 38 interrupts the flow of the Joseph story as a whole by demonstrating literary connections between that chapter and its larger context. Elsewhere, Levenson connects the Joseph story to the Aqedah, as well as to Ugaritic myths of Baal (p. 149), demonstrating the breadth of his learning and his skill at drawing dramatically different materials, ranging from the early cultures of the ancient Near East to classical Judaism and Christianity, together in one grand sweep. He is also capable of coining expressive terminology, as in his reference to the earliest attestation of a motif that was later taken typologically in the New Testament as a "preenactment." Overall, then, this book brings together material from a wide range of sources, even while keeping its focus trained squarely on the Aqedah, in order to explore an important theological theme in both biblical and postbiblical traditions. The project carries with it a wealth of insights that are connected to its suggestive and provocative major thesis. Christians may be comforted to find this "preenactment" of their prevailing myth in the Hebrew Bible; how many Jews will recognize their tradition in this telling remains to be seen.
