<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jonathan J. Price. Jerusalem under Siege: The Collapse of the Jewish State, 66-70 C.E. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1992. xiv, 361 pp. In this revised doctoral dissertation, J. J. Price attempts to write an "internal" history of the First Revolt against Rome that moves away from the usual emphasis on the progression of events to a more analytical assessment of "neglected details" (p. xiii). Although Price is dependent upon Josephus for clues, he is determined to pursue topics and information that were only peripheral concerns of the first-century historian, such as desertion, water and food supplies, and the composition of the Jewish army. Price focuses on developments in Jerusalem that he believes are pivotal to an understanding of the revolt as a whole, a revolt that was characterized by stasis: "The revolution grew partly out of faction, weakened and sputtered from the start because of faction, and changed course ineffectively and without purpose because</page><page sequence="2">406 BOOK REVIEWS of faction, exhausting and consuming its own people" (p. xii). This premise makes Price's presentation all the more interesting as he demonstrates that disunity was not endemic to specific groups of rebels, as Josephus would have it, but rather was pervasive, affecting every component of Jewish society. Price sees the rebels as sharing an "intolerance both of the establishment and of each other" (p. 17). They should not be regarded as unified groups of revolutionaries who were inspired by apocalyptic texts, since their charismatic leaders did not resort to these writings to gain a following. Moreover, the disparate messages found in apocalyptic literature were hardly of much use for the formulation of distinct or coherent political stances. Perhaps surprisingly, Price maintains that the Zealots were related to the sicarii inasmuch as both adhered to the fourth philosophy. At the same time, they were not identical, since their leaders, members, and roles were different. As for the aristocracy, it too was affected by significant differences and factionalism. In War, Josephus would have us believe that the aristocracy stood united in opposition to the rebels, as he constantly resorts to the formulaic "Jewish leaders and high priests" as opposed to "the revolutionaries." In Antiquities, however, the historian notes how the aristocrats would rely on the revolutionaries to fight their battles. Price shows how the aristocracy can be broken down into "pro-Romans," revolutionary high priests," "revolutionary priests," and "revolutionary lay nobility," resulting in a "free-for-all at the top levels of society" (p. 29). Josephus in fact tried to hide the complicity of the nobility with the rebels. Twelve thousand nobles may have been lost once the fragile coalition of 66 C.E. fell apart, but many of Josephus' own class should actually be seen as "committed revolutionaries" (p. 94) who joined the new leadership in prosecuting the war. Price does not shrink from musing about what might have been had the Jews managed to overcome their disunity. The Jews' strength in battle was precisely the result of their reliance on small weapons and hand-to-hand combat, which the Romans could only counter with cavalry and archers. Had the defenders of Jerusalem rationed their food and strategized, they might have been able to hold out longer. Price has left most of his detailed analysis to the fourteen appendices that comprise approximately 40 percent of his book. These include discussions of War as an historical source, external sources, numbers, chronological problems in War, the Jewish army, Jewish weapons, food, water, desertion, R. Yohanan b. Zakkai, famine, hand-to-hand combat, archaeological notes,</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 407 and Titus' view of deserters. This reader found the presentation somewhat disjointed. It would have made better sense to present related themes in consecutive appendices. This, however, is a minor quibble, as some of Price's most interesting and at times debatable observations can be found in these excursuses. For instance, Price is particularly adept at getting behind Josephus' famine motif, which it turns out is used to dramatize the cruelty of the rebels. Price notes that famine, because of its gradual development, was a convenient theme for Josephus to interject into the narrative at will. Price is able, nevertheless, to extract useful information about the extent of famine during the siege. He also believes that much else could be learned if human and animal skeletal remains from the Jerusalem area were subjected to the same type of scientific analysis used by prehistoric archaeologists. Important questions pertaining to disease and diet might be answered, which in turn would shed further light on the extent of famine and even help distinguish, with greater certainty, between Roman and Jewish destruction layers. Price correctly notes (p. 252) that Dio Cassius and Josephus contend that famine and not thirst was a problem for the Jews during the siege of Jerusalem. Price argues that the one remark of Josephus concerning the dearth of water, War 5, 409-410, pertains to 69 C.E., i.e., before the arrival of the Romans. At this point, the level of the Siloam and other springs may indeed have been low, as Josephus claims, due to seasonal fluctuations in precipitation. Price is perhaps a bit too quick to dismiss T. Parah 9:2, where R. Judah alludes to the lessening of the waters of the Shiloah (Siloam) during a time of polemos ("war"). Price is correct that the tradition does not specify which polenmos is intended, but it is conceivable that R. Judah (or any of his mid-second-century contemporaries) to whom the statement is attributed would have had the First Revolt, in which Jerusalem was of course central, in mind.' Moreover, if later testimony is any indication, independent traditions about the Siloam undoubtedly existed. Thus Eucherius, the fifth-century bishop of Lyons and pilgrim, observed that the Siloam was known to gush, and that it also "does not flow continuously but only on certain days and at certain hours." The historian of the Crusades, William of Tyre (ca. 1174-1188), remarked that the 1. At M. Sotah 9:14, polemos is used in reference to the frictions in the time of Vespasian, "Quietus," and Hadrian. In this instance, however, events concerning Jerusalem are clearly not the issue.</page><page sequence="4">408 BOOK REVIEWS Siloam at times has "a deficiency due to slight drainage."2 The point is that the rabbis may very well have preserved an authentic, independent recollection or at the very least a reasonable approximation of what happened. Even if they did not have the First Revolt or, more precisely, the siege of Jerusalem in mind, their awareness that the Siloam's water could dry up is enough to cause us to wonder whether the similar phenomenon alluded to by Josephus was more of a problem than previously thought. In his treatment of the escape of R. Yohanan from Jerusalem (Avot de Rabbi Natan A:4 B:6; B. Gittin 56a-b; and parallels), Price vacillates between complete rejection of the details of the story and acceptance of the circumstances and context, which he judges to be essentially accurate. Price acknowledges his minimalist approach to rabbinic sources, arguing that talmudic stories should be treated as fiction unless they can be confirmed by outside sources. Nevertheless, he concedes that it would be interesting to see whether the Yohanan legend "could stand as history" (p. 265). His conclusion: The escape/departure of Yohanan, as opposed to his encounter with Vespasian, is judged to be more plausible if not historical because the "rabbinic tradition has at least not invented the circumstances of R. Johanan's escape . . . the context is real" (p. 265). Although Price has little confidence in the encounter with Vespasian, he has no difficulty resorting to the allusion to Vespasian that opens the entire account (e.g., Avot de Rabbi Natan A: "When Vespasian came to destroy Jerusalem"; B: "When Vespasian came and besieged Jerusalem") to date the departure of Yohanan. Here he rejects the usual tendency to emend the rabbinic sources to read "Titus" (instead of Vespasian) because Vespasian was indeed near Jerusalem in June 69 C.E., as indicated in War 4:551. This is an extremely important corrective. However, given the formulaic nature of the allusion to the arrival of Vespasian in Avot de Rabbi Natan (cf. A:6 end; and B:7) and the fact that in B. Gittin and Lamentations Rabbah (1:31) the notice is not even connected directly to the Yohanan account (p. 266, n. 5), not too much should be made of this point, at least not where the date of Yohanan's departure is concerned. Interestingly, Price devotes an entirely separate appendix to a discussion of Titus' treatment of deserters in which he demonstrates that the Romans sought to preserve 2. See F. E.

Here he admits that Yohanan may very well have turned to the Romans, who were only too willing to encourage the establishment of religious institutions. Yet Price sticks to his criteria for judging rabbinic materials, and concludes that Yohanan's escape and meeting with Vespasian must both continue to be regarded as "unhistorical" despite his useful foray into the thorny area of rabbinic historiography. In the end, Price succeeds in directing our attention to the internal details of the insurrection. His book is an important contribution because it breaks new ground and forces us to think about the nitty-gritty of the First Revolt. Stuart S.
