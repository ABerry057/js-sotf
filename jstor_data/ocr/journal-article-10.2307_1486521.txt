<plain_text><page sequence="1">HAIM GOURI AND "THE JEWISH PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED" by REUVEN SHOHAM The poet Haim Gouri is a central figure among the artists of the generation of the War of Independence and one of the first Israeli poets and novelists to express experience of the Holocaust. Gouri, who was born in Tel Aviv in 1922, was sent to Europe in 1947 to smuggle Jewish Holocaust survivors into Palestine. Subsequently, he served in the Palmach and fought in the battles in the Negev in 1948. He attests that his encounter with the survivors of the Nazi camps changed his life, and that the experience became an obsessive theme throughout his work.' This article focuses on two complementary subjects: (1) Gouri's perception of Jewish history and the effect of his encounter with Holocaust survivors in the formulation of his autobiography; (2) the concrete shaping of the experience of this encounter in his first three books 1. See his books of poetry, from Pirh.ey esh [Flowers of fire] (Merhavya, 1949) to Ha-ba aharay [The one after me] (Tel Aviv, 1994); his novel 'Isqat ha-shoqolad (Tel Aviv, 1965; 2nd ed., 1995; English translation by Seymour Simckes, The Chocolate Deal, New York, 1968) is devoted to the almost impossible attempt to observe the remains left by the Holocaust through the eyes of the victims. See also his book Mul ta ha-zekhukhit [The glass booth] (Tel Aviv, 1962) containing his newspaper essays on the trial of Adolf Eichmann; and his documentary films The 81st Blow (VHS video edition, Ergo, 1992), Flames in the Ashes (VHS video edition, Ergo, 1992), and Last Sea (VHS video edition, Ergo, 1997). The English reader can now find a fine selection from Gouri's poetry in Stanley F. Chyet, trans., Words in My Lovesick Blood (Detroit, 1996). This collection includes several texts concerning Gouri's traumatic encounter with Holocaust survivors during his 1947 mission to Europe (pp. 6-7, 28-33, 62-65, 70-71, 80-81, 104-105, 122-123, 228-231).

This article may contribute to a question and to a debate. The question is, Where does one find a real literary reaction to the Holocaust in Israeli literature? Is it only from Uri Zvi Greenberg and Aharon Appelfeld, as, for example, A. B. Yehoshua and Alan Mintz think, or is it earlier, in Gouri's first book, Pirhey esh (1949)?4 As for the debate, this is the dispute between the so-called new historians and the conservative historians of the Zionist movement over the patronizing attitude of the Yishuv and the sabras toward the survivors of the Holocaust.' 2.

In the third part of his book, especially the last chapter, Mintz examines the beginnings and the main literary manifestations concerning the Holocaust in Hebrew literature in the 1950s and the 1960s: Uri Zvi Greenberg's Rehovot ha-nahar [Streets of the river], pp. 165-202; Aharon Appelfeld's novels, pp. 203-238; Hanoch Bartov, Pis 'ey bagrut (English trans. by David S.

Concerning Gouri's writings, Mintz, like most of Gouri's critics, did not consider his poetry on the Holocaust written before The Glass Booth and The Chocolate Deal, in Pirhey esh (1949), Shirey hotam (1954), and Shoshanat ruhot [Compass rose] (Tel Aviv, 1960). See also Robert Alter's essay "Confronting the Holocaust," in After the Tradition (New York, 1969), pp. 163-180. Alter, like Mintz after him, deals with Gouri's The Chocolate Deal (pp. 171-175), together with Amichai's novel Lo me-'akhshav, lo mi-kan (pp. 166-170) and Bartov's Pis'ey bagrut (pp. 175-180), without mentioning Gouri's attempts to deal with the Holocaust in his poetry.

Several poets and novelists contemporaneous with Gouri, among them Hillel Omer, Amir Gilboa, Yizhar Smilansky, and Aharon Megged, introduced antiheroes and speakers who voiced anti-establishment and oppositional opinions after 1949, in order to pierce the new bureaucratic atmosphere that dominated the "morning after" the War of Independence. Gouri's characters, by contrast, especially in the three books mentioned above, are planted in the very soil and spirit of the mainstream position. In all three books, no trace of the weary hero is to be found, except for occasions when the hero meets his defeated people in Europe; but more of that later. Even subsequently, with his fourth book, Shoshanat ruhot,7 and afterwards, as a nostalgic poet8 or novelist, Gouri's poetry and prose mainly reflect this position, affirming most of the chief manifestations of the Jewish experience and Eretz Israel. Because his poetry is not oppositional, it is also usually innocent of satirical and ironic elements aimed against the predominantly secular Israeli ethos dominant in Eretz Israel before and immediately after the War of Independence. This runs counter to the historical and sociocultural climate of the twentieth century, which is ready to demolish almost every myth and ideal of the social and cultural establishment. He himself attests: "In a certain period I was one of the 'court poets' of the Palmach. It was a marvelous time of absolute identity between the setting and the personality, between the whole and the individual."9 Gouri, then, is in principle a mainstream poet, not in the narrow political sense, of course, but in the broad meaning of identity with the heroic struggle of his people, with "the Jewish people who have been seriously injured" as he puts it in the poem "Rashei perakim le-yoman" ("An outline for a diary").'" He unconditionally identifies with the entire web of Jewish history, 6. Gershon Shaked, Hebrew Narrative Fiction, 1880-1980 (Hebrew), vol. 4 (Tel Aviv, 1993), pp. 14-45. 7.

Like Hanokh Bartov," Gouri was, and is, one of the contemporary Hebrew poets most attached to the fate of the Jewish people and the Israeli situation. He eschews the criticism of the so-called new postmodernist historians'2 and the ironic poetics that set the tone from the mid-1950s through such poets as Yehuda Amichai, Natan Zach, and David Avidan. Here is what he says of himself and his generation: All in all these writers [i.e., Gouri's contemporaries] were, so to speak, identifiers with the principles of the Israeli revolution. They were not alienated from it, because they felt that it was vital and just, that they were a part of those oppressed and in danger. From this, too, emerges the phrase I have used (in Shoshanat ruhot, p. 97), "The people spoke in the first-person plural."'3 Gouri's identification with the continuing revolution of the Jewish people and their historic, "messianic," destiny is the starting point of the Indepen- dence poetry, and also of his entire oeuvre from the beginning to the point he has reached today. Such poetry must necessarily observe the unifying factor on the metahistorical plane, not the divisive, the separating, and the disconnecting. He declares: I hear from Jews such questions as, "Hasn't the price of redemption done harm to the traditional attributes of the Jewish genius?" I have said more than once that "the full account isn't complete yet," as Brenner puts it, and it is too soon to judge the spiritual face of such a variegated and amazing society as Israeli society. I refuse to believe that the redemption will actually be linked to spiritual castration.14 11. See, e.g., Bartov's novel Pis 'ey bagrut (above, n. 4). 12. See, e.g., his lively response to Idith Zertal's research: The Gold of the Jews (above, n. 5). In this essay, "On Books and What There Is Among Them" (Hebrew), in Alpaiym, no. 14 (1997): 9-30, Gouri responds harshly to Zertal's main hypothesis that Ben-Gurion brutally exploited the survivors in his struggle against Britain to win over public opinion in Europe and the United States; and he rejects the idea that the Yishuv and the sabras patronized the Holocaust survivors. He cites much evidence from The Brigade by Bartov, a sabra like himself, who also rejects the new post-Zionist ideas. 13.

Davar, February 23, 1979.</page><page sequence="5">HAIM GOURI AND "THE JEWISH PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED" 77 In an interview with Miri Paz he said: In the moving and uplifting eulogy delivered by Chief of Staff Ehud Barak at the graveside of the late General Nehemia Tamari, he noted that Nehemia was named after Nehemia Schein, a member of Kibbutz Ein Harod, who fell on the "Night of the Bridges" in June 1946, a night when the Palmach fighters blew up several bridges in order to prevent the entry of Arab and British reinforcements into Eretz Israel. Nehemia Schein, who was an extraordinary figure of a fighter and intellectual, was my captain in A Company of the Palmach. At the age of 16 Nehemia Schein wrote of "the assembly of all the generations," to which he belonged. I feel like him: the gathering of all the generations in Eretz Israel and in the Jewish people. Only the assumption of all the components of identity, of all the contradictions in this, prevents spiritual depletion. I contain within me all the components of belonging, which some tend to belittle because "presentism" is fashionable and spiritual fair.15 The feeling of so totally belonging to the history of the Jewish people, with its mass of contradictions, exists through an inexplicable optimism and faith in the people's future. This optimism is realized despite Jewish history, not necessarily because of it. Indeed, Gouri replaces the actual course of history with a mythological tale. Historical occurrences are perceived from within and from a mythic perspective in which isolated events are always part of the metahistorical cycle, even though God has forsaken the world. The place of the poet, or the place of the speaker or his autobiographical narrator, in this mythic story is clear. If history acts in accordance with the laws of the myth of rebirth and redemption, with God or without him (in Gouri's poetry), its hero, too, is part of the myth.'6 This is how the words sound when they are transposed from Gouri's credo to his literary elaboration and to his autobiographical creation, Re'u'el: "--So who the devil am I then!?" the hero asks, and continues, "This is me, and this is my life! As if some blemish has been laid on me. A burning scar. Oh land, land, what are you doing to me?" Re'u'el, as a true sabra, a native son of the land of Israel, alienated as an adolescent from his people but intimately attached to 15.

Unexpectedly, the answer is given by the generations of the Jewish people throughout their wanderings all over the world. The people's answer, abridged as necessary, is this: You are ours, Re'u'el, ours. You alone carry all the years. You have been at all the stations, and you will not choose any other biography for yourself. True, you have never set foot inside a synagogue, you have shed the burden of the mitzvot, but you are ours, and we shall not relent. Ben-Porat Yosef. You will tell our glory. Wherever we have been, you have been. Since that Covenant of the Pieces and the Night of Angels and the Ladder, and the wrestling match before dawn. At all times, in all the wanderings, our dear brother, our heretical brother. You too went down to Egypt, and you too came up from there for the festival. And when you tried to conduct vile selections among us, and strike out the inapplicable, as in questionnaires, we taught you that a man may choose his wife, but he does not choose his mother and his father. Because you belong to us, and the roots of your soul are here, among us. Therefore you will do well to accept with great joy the privilege that has befallen you of belonging to this noble family, oppressed and elect. ... Because you need us more than we need you. Because without us you are chaff and dust in the wind, and without you we are a people. (Ha-haqira, pp. 217-218) Re'u'el, the author's autobiographical protagonist and narrator, states his condition, in light of all the transformations of Jewish history, as an endless myth of exile and redemption. The Jewish people refuse to release the sabra hero, refuse to afford him the opportunity to be a son of the land alone. They oblige him to be a son of his people too, despite his own desire, almost in opposition to the Zionist ethos in which the hero grew up in the 1930s, an ethos of much Land of Israel and little, if any, People of Israel. The imposition of the Jewish people onto Re'u'el stems directly from the poet's traumatic encounters with camp survivors when he was a Haganah emissary. The section preceding the above quotation'7 concerns the tragic meeting that "changed my life," Re'u'el states.18 It entirely rid him of the seeds of the Canaanism that had sprouted in him as a typical sabra educated in the Zionist ideology of the first 'aliyot.

He cut loose from the roots."20 In an interview with Nili Carmel-Flumin he related: One of the encounters that changed my life was one that took place during a bitter Central European winter, in the Rothschild Hospital in Vienna. I came upon what was left of the Jewish people in Europe. That unforgettable meeting shattered all the autism and narcissism that until then had in some way marked my personal biography. At that moment I was instantly jolted out of my lifelong ways, complacency and pride, out of the feeling of being a fine youth from Eretz Israel, out of the plague of the Canaanite virus, and into the need for self-definition, which decreed that I must assume the totality of the Jewish people's past. There, among distant relatives, unknown, wrapped in overcoats distributed by the Joint, the terrible miscomprehension within me became clear, 19. Benjamin Tamuz, "World's Number Two Canaanite," in Haim Chertok: We Are All Close (conversations with Israeli writers) (New York, 1989), pp. 105-117. The poet Yonatan Ratosh was the leader and ideological "prophet" of the Canaanite movement in the 1940s and 1950s in Eretz Israel. After the War of Independence a very small group of young people gathered around him and around the periodical Alef, edited by Ratosh, and after him by the poet Aharon Amir. Twenty-three issues were published between 1948 and 1953. The group called itself "The Young 'Ivrim," but the poet Avraham Shlonski gave it the pejorative name Kna'anim. Ideologically and poetically, this movement wanted to renew the most archaic elements of the ancient cultures that had existed in the biblical time and area. The most famous of its members were the novelist Binyamin Tamuz, the poet Aharon Amir, Uzzi Oman (Ratosh's brother), the sculpture Yitzhak Danziger, Ezra Zohar, Amos Keinan, and Boaz and Yair Evron. On Ratosh and the Canaanite ideology in English, see Yoram Brunovsky, "Yonathan Ratosh: Poet and Ideologist," Modern Hebrew Literature, Summer 1984, pp. 5-12; James S. Diamond, Homeland or Holy Land? The Canaanite Critique of Israel (Bloomington, 1986). The name of Gouri's hero, Re'u'el, means "comrade of God," re 'a shel ha-'el. But he also has an almost "Canaanite" origin according to the mentions of the name in the Old Testament: Re'u'el is the name of Esau's son (Genesis 36:10); also of the father of Zipporah, Moses's wife (Exodus 2:17, Numbers 10:9), and it is one of the names of Benjamin's son (1 Chronicles 9:9). This name attests to its basic connection to the Canaanite movement. 20.

It has never released its grip on me since.21 So much for Gouri's personal testimony about his own and his speakers' attitude to the Jewish people and, more particularly, to the place of the Holocaust in its spiritual, national, and cultural identity. In the following I wish to examine what occurs in this domain from a poetical aspect, in his poetry, and I shall focus principally on his first three books, Pirhey esh, 'Ad 'alot ha-shahar, and Shirey hotam; I treat the poetry section in 'Ad 'alot ha-shahar as an integral part of Pirhey esh, as is evident from the second edition of Pirh.ey esh (1961).22 The first collections of poems deserve special attention because they contain the first sparks of Gouri's poetical worldview and of the place of the Holocaust in the fashioning of his "I". Here are to be found cornerstones and landmarks for the future that expand and deepen with the passage of the years. The literary section of Pirhey esh may be subdivided into four parts: 1. "Sderat ha-yasmin" ("Avenue of Jasmine"): This part centers on a youthful speaker and his innocent girl, about to take to the road and set out on life, wandering around a romantic and moonstruck world, devoid of elements of defined time and place. 21. Nili Carmel-Flumin, "Mi-Pirhey esh le-Ayuma," meeting with Haim Gouri following the publication of his new book of poems, Ayuma, in Yedi'ot aharonot, February 9, 1979. These statements are repeated in Ha-haqira (p. 211). There the investigators actually accuse Re'u'el of plain antisemitism: "You choose evil and the repulsive and the ugly [in reference to the description of "Diaspora-like" Jewish figures]. This is an antisemitic trait. There is within you a full measure of self-hatred. You are ashamed of yourself, your people, your brothers. You would like to be someone else" (p. 215). In the interview with Miri Paz (n. 11), the poet related how he was cured of the "Canaanite virus" after the encounter with the survivors of the extermination. "The encounter constituted another essential element in my identity. In Budapest I chanced upon a memorial service for the victims of the extermination. A certain rabbi, who spoke Hungarian, recited in the manner of the expositors a Hebrew verse: 'I seek my brothers' (Genesis 34:16). Around me I heard sounds of weeping, then I recalled Joseph in search of his brothers, the shepherds in the Valley of Dothan. I became a member of this body that began there and continued as far as the gray streets of Central Europe." 22. 'Ad 'alot ha-shahar is Gouri's war diary, written during and after the battles in the Negev during the War of Independence. Its last part is the poem cycle Kelulot [Wedding].</page><page sequence="9">HAIM GOURI AND "THE JEWISH PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED" 81 2. " 'Of ha-nedudim" ("Migrant Bird"): Here the young hero departs on a difficult journey to foreign lands, in the heart of destroyed post-Nazi Europe, with a sudden transition into a defined social and historical world. 3. "Shirim mi-thokh yalqut ha-sad" ("Knapsack Poems"): Here too there is a sharp passage to the reality of Eretz Israel, to the overriding atmo- sphere of the War of Independence and the land of the Mediterranean noon. 4. "Kelulot" ("Wedding"): The poet added this cycle from 'Ad 'alot ha-shahar to the second edition of Pirhey esh (1961); these are poems of battle and conquest, bringing what began in "Knapsack Poems" to a climax. Here the speaker and his comrades reach their goal, the mountain of God, the holy center, having traversed the path of fire and triumph. These four parts are characterized by thematic foci resting mainly on features of narrative and atmosphere that change from part to part, but together they create a single whole: the hero on a quest that in the end is fulfilled-salvation of the people and the country. Not surprisingly, this narrative and thematic structure presents a hero who operates within a romantic-mythic tale adapted to the circumstances of time and place.23 For this purpose the poet provides his autobiographical speaker, the sabra, with an archetypal heroic biography. The two central plots in this biography are the adventure-filled quest and the story of the battle.24 These two elements are what eventually lead the hero to the goal that awaits him. This quest, as may be expected, derives from some flaw--physical, metaphysical, or psychological--that the hero has an unconquerable compulsion to set right. Frye believes that the most important element of the romance and the mythical tale is the adventure, whose beginnings lie in a flow of minor events, leading to a climax in which the goal is apparently achieved. This is the intermediate quest, which consists of four stages. Only two of them are of concern to us: 23. For a wide-ranging discussion of the mythical romantic quest in these collections, see Shoham, "Be-siman kutonent ha-pasim." Northrop Frye, in The Secular Scripture: A Study of the Structure of Romance (Cambridge, Mass., 1976), pp. 1-32, argues that from a literary poetic viewpoint there is no difference between a mythical tale and a romance tale. 24. See Joseph Campbell, The Hero with a Thousand Faces (New York, 1956); Lord Raglan, The Hero: A Study in Tradition, Myth and Drama (New York, 1956); Northrop Frye, Anatomy of Criticism (Princeton, N.J., 1957), pp. 186-205.</page><page sequence="10">82 REUVEN SHOHAM (1) the agon is the initial stage of the dangerous quest, in which the hero tests his strength in a series of minor incidents that prepare him for the chief thing, the stage of pathos; (2) the pathos is the decisive life-and-death struggle against the antagonist, the enslaving and uprooting monster. This mythic pattern includes a formal archetypal biography that embraces the hero's life from birth, through adolescence, departure for the struggle, the struggle and ritual death, to the final recognition that he attains. On this mythical course the hero is the savior, the representative of the powers of spring, fertility, and the rising sun, while the antagonist, as the antithesis, is associated with aspects of decline: winter, darkness, barrenness, and old age.25 In the "'Of ha-nedudim" city we find ourselves at the first stage of the overall quest, which began to emerge in "Sderat ha-yasmin," namely the agon. Already in "Sderat ha-yasmin" it was becoming evident that the protagonist-spokesman, despite being a youth of the night, who moves tirelessly in the darkness over fields and in the forest, in fact represents the daylight that is about to break at any moment. He moves constantly across sacred soil and in a sacred time, which by metonymy turns him into a sacred youth. Of all the seasons of the year, the only one that does not figure in "Sderat ha-yasmin" is the freezing winter. The spokesman proves to be a potentially sunlit hero, garbed, not surprisingly, in a "coat of many colors" (Genesis 37:4), and engrossed entirely in a "quest with passing time." arovil ninb ) n. nny I have crossed peaks and crests.

Gouri, Pirhey esh, p. 17.</page><page sequence="11">HAIM GOURI AND "THE JEWISH PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED" 83 The chosen spokesman lives and walks in the night, but his destiny and his goal are linked to the dawn that is about to break at any instant over the holy ground in the course of holy events. The insertion of the "coat of many colors" into the grueling quest for light attests not only to his being his father's favorite son and to his future sunny fate but also to the reason for the quest: search and concern for his brothers: "I seek my brothers."27 In " 'Of ha-nedudim" the center of gravity shifts from the restless and aimless wandering of "Sderat ha-yasmin" to the fateful quest. The speaker is thrust toward concrete and bruised historical reality, which will necessitate his maturing from a potential hero to an active hero to prepare him for the stage of pathos, the final confrontation with the forces of evil, in order to rescue his brothers. "Sderat ha-yasmin" was a locality lacking any feature of time and place, a sort of world of a distant tale. But now we pass into the very heart of post-Nazi European civilization. The first meeting with the terrible European world is "Be-veit ha-netivot" ("At the Railroad Station," ibid., p. 25). This title, that of the opening poem, places the spokesman at a symbolic junction of the world of doing and the modem quest. The hero with the coat of many colors has reached a parting of the ways at a defined time and place. The texts in this part of the cycle depict a state of destruction, winter, and barrenness, for Europe generally and the Jewish people in particular. The poems are replete with specific names of towns, streets, rivers, and events associated with the horror that has overtaken Europe, thus turning the terrible from something abstract into something real and concrete in time and place. The wanderings in this Europe acquire a character of "agonies and suffering, and fighting from doorway to doorway" (p. 25); the chill of the transport station is cruel, "the mire reaches up to the knees, / and the village lost in a cloud disappears in thousands of darknesses." Europe is gripped in an icy winter, with teeming rain (ibid.): "the streets are battered with rain. / Black scenes of no light" (p. 31), and "on the horizon are banks of clouds and the snow falls dismally" (p. 38); "on Kerend Ter (a square in Budapest: poet's note) the snow of December falls" and "death so white drifts toward me" (p. 54); and so on. Winter, which was absent in "Sderat ha-yasmin," sweeps in with full violence in the second part of the collection, symbolizing the hunger and freezing cold that European civilization suffers after the war. In the traditional manner this winter has to be driven off in order for the city, the community, or the tribe to be saved from its claws. The climax of this 27.

In "Yoman leily" ("Night Diary") he strides through the razed streets on the banks of the Danube at night, when suddenly from the surrealist city "someone appears (an ice-cold hand)," some unknown person who takes him on an guided night tour of the places where the atrocious acts were committed: "Here they shot them with lead bullets, / they fell, and didn't make a sound, / the names were carried off with the river current."

To the road, empty and terrible. To the trains leading eastward, To the forests at the sides of the path, To the cursed land of the Poles. (pp. 28-30) Europe is locked in the "heart of the great darkness," frozen, and even "the statues of heroes are silent with their horses" (p. 31). The known heroes are frozen in stone, so someone must take their place. Where there is no hero, the speaker senses himself to be the one upon whom the mantle of the hero has fallen. In hostile, indifferent, and destroyed Europe he seeks himself and his brothers in a labyrinth whose Minotaur has indeed been vanquished; but the desolation and barrenness associated with it are still evident in everything and cry out from every comer, begging for a savior and salvation. In this part of the collection the speaker seemingly diverges from the image of the potential savior hero of "Sderat ha-yasmin." He is still on a rigorous quest, but he is portrayed as a dual character, uniting the hero and the antihero into a single entity. On the one hand he is a stranger, adrift, in keeping with modem Western literature and in the style of the tehiya generation and its "hero" ha-talush: He "walks on... walks on" (p. 27), and it is not within his power to save because "I am a foreigner and a stranger" (p. 31), "a man's body heated with a soul" (p. 33). On the other hand, the portrayal of the "stranger," the antihero, does not exhaust the speaker's essence. As an outsider the distance between him and the archetypal savior is great, but by modem standards "a man's body heated with a soul" sounds well compared with the spirit of heroism that prevails in twentieth-century</page><page sequence="14">86 REUVEN SHOHAM literature, peopled with "hollow men." Indeed, as we read further, we find increasingly distinct features alluding to the hero's heroic "origins" as part of the speaker's psycho-poetics in Pirh.ey esh. As noted, the poem that opens the " 'Of ha-nedudim" cycle is "Be-veit ha-netivot." In it the speaker characterizes the "we" as those who are sworn to give themselves over entirely, to love as a supreme value, not merely going through the motions or at the command of the superego.29 .-on, ,r- nno inart I-, x ,..,i Let us walk again on the empty roads---to the poem.

We did not bid farewell to things we loved once. We just have been sworn to love, until death carries off our life. We were only good and simple, in silence and in thunder. Only our soul in its complete innocence submitted to sadness, And day-old wrinkles, soundlessly, slowly bloomed in the garden of our cheeks. (p. 25) 29.

Only an innocent hero who identifies unconditionally with the tribulations of his tribe and his brothers can rise to do heroic deeds. The direct characterization of innocent youths, devoting themselves until death to the things they love, is supported by three attributes that reinforce one other in a single direction: they are good, they are simple, and above all their souls are not just innocent but "very" innocent. It is they who stand, in their perfect innocence, before the destroyed, misshapen, post-Nazi Europe. Against perfect goodness is posed perfect negation, which has to be annihilated through "agonies and suffering" in "fighting from doorway to doorway," and all because "we have been sworn to love, until death carries off our life." But the innocent speaker and his comrades utterly identify not only with the suffering of the battered tribe in wounded Europe but also with their existence that they left behind (with the "things that we loved once"). The speaker, here and everywhere else in Gouri's poetry, refuses to allow reality to alter him, to change him from an innocent man into a bitter, sarcastic, and satirical figure. He refuses to be transformed from a man with a naive sense of the world, believing that the good end will indeed come, into a man with a tragic sense of the world, knowing that the good end is an illusion and a mirage. He and his comrades walk again "on the empty roads--to the poem" despite knowing the agonies and the suffering and the ceaseless fighting; despite acquaintance with the fear that bristled "in the women's eyes," and the sucking mire that reaches "to the knees." Despite all these things, and not because of lack of experience, the poem ends on an optimistic note, which only a speaker who is innocent enough can formulate: "And let us look for a brief moment skyward, and we shall be kissed with the road, our road."'0 The innocent heroism in the speaker's personality is frequently linked with another city, the bright heavenly blue one, which the troubadour-hero has left behind him, namely, the white city of the summery land of Israel (p. 32). It is from that summer that he draws his strength in times of crisis: "nitp in "" Im -lix pinl pP y r"9- p I 30.

Summer huge and strong, light shed on distant cities. The flames dart about in my eyes; where shall I turn? ("Two Poems of Quarter VI," p. 39) At the end of the poem we hear almost a bragging declaration, when the speaker addresses God, having presented himself as "a man who strays from the path" in the city of the night. Out of modesty, and to distance himself from his alter-ego, he shifts to the third-person: "Remote God, if on thousands of horizons the sparks from your burning fire have gone out, / Take a brand from the light of his eyeballs, and illumine your world for a fleeting instant" (p. 40). This then is the sunny hero, the savior of the people, who offers the fire in his eyes to the remote God whose fire has gone out. The detached stranger feels his mission in his fingertips, a mission assigned to him by "a Divine Residence of reflections," which is a psychological substitute for the classic Presence of God (ha-shekhina). The hero draws the reserves of his strength from his innocent and vivid childhood: "And your soul," he declares to his own alter-ego, "is purer than springs and summer." Then he adds: will answer me a noise with waving of hands And my locks move in a strong wind.31 31. Locks of hair are traditionally associated with heroism, e.g., the case of Samson. For ironic variations on this subject, see Bialik's "Megilat ha-esh" [The scroll of fire] in Kol kitvey</page><page sequence="17">HAIM GOURI AND "THE JEWISH PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED" 89 This is the law of procreation beyond the time, Which alters their light, and their face is two, And a fine, tall God sets up his plumb lines. ('Ad 'alot ha-shahar," p. 42) The "flowers of light" are akin to the "flowers of the fire," the heralds of redemption, and therefore they are in a reciprocal relationship with the fine, tall God, who sets up his plumb lines for the day of judgment and redemption together (Amos 7:7-9). The speaker augments and modifies Amos; whereas the prophet set up only one plumb line, and it was for destruction, Gouri's speaker sees many, but they are plumb lines for building the redemption of Israel. In the poem "Silo shel ha-'ish" ("The Shadow of the Man"), the connection between the European quest and the mission (which is not imposed on him unwillingly but grasped by him almost by force) is still more obvious. He followed the dusty paths, His two eyes the hunger. He stretched out his hurt hands, H. N. Bialik [Collected works] (Tel Aviv, 1971), pp. 102-109; and Amichay's poem "Ani rotse la-mut 'al mitati" ["I wish to die in my bed] in Shirim, 1948-1962 [(Poems, 1948-1962] (Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, 1963), p. 82. The locks of the speaker that are ruffled in the wind in Gouri's poem are free of all irony, and thereby he establishes a link with other heroes with a forelock and curly hair in the War of Independence literature, e.g., the character of Uri in Hu halakh ba-sadot [He walked in the fields) by Moshe Shamir (Merhavia, 1947), who has "a lock of hair, a nomad's turban, a knapsack" (p. 9). Omer Hillel in his poem "'Al mekhonit mas'a doge bi-khvish Haifa-Tel Aviv" [On a Dodge truck on the Haifa--Tel Aviv road] in Eretz ha-sohora 'yim [Land of noon] (Tel Aviv, 1957), p. 28, has his speaker say: "Love your lock of hair, black or blond, which laughed in the wind!"

(p. 45) He hears a commanding voice, sending him on his mission: "Go, gather the posies of flowers" in order to reach "the meanings of things" (p. 46). At times he does indeed feel that he has missed "the carriage of eagles, its wheels smashed" (p. 48), but for all that he feels that he "is going up to those skies," and in his vision he returns again to the "blue, gay summer, endless," that floats toward him from the valleys of Eretz Israel, which are also the source for his verses and poems. The ending of this part of Pirhey esh with the poem "Zekher kayis" ("Memory of Summer") evokes the wintry reality of Europe contrasted against the summery reality of Eretz Israel.

The gentle boy with the handsome eyes of "Sderat ha-yasmin," who grew up and went off to discover himself in " 'Of ha-nedudim," indeed finds his summer mission in "The Land of Noon," where not only the mission but also the prize awaits him, in the form of a pair of brown arms that clasp his neck, as part of the story of salvation. He cannot save his brothers in Europe, but he is able to accomplish his mission, even for the surviving remnant, there in the land of noon. And indeed, at precisely this stage we move to the third part of Pirhey esh, the "Shirim mi-tokh yalkut ha-sad" cycle, which together with the "Kelulot" cycle constitutes the climatic stage in the mythical-romance fabric of Gouri's early poetry, the stage of pathos. But as we are concerned with the encounter of the poet with the remnants of the Holocaust, I bypass this stage to reach the Shirey hotam. * * *</page><page sequence="19">HAIM GOURI AND "THE JEWISH PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED" 91 Shirey hotam is divided into five parts, which show a distinct connection, despite some essential changes, with the structure of Pirhey esh. 1. Part I is parallel to "Sderat ha-yasmin" and is marked by moonstruck individualism. At its center we find the wayfarer, who wanders away from civilization along the nocturnal paths of the countryside, main- taining an intimate relationship with some female "you" who at times is flesh-and-blood, at times a divine figure, and at times a personification of the motherland. Toward the end we are witness to glimmerings of the collective experience of the war, which is the essence of the second part. 2. Parts II and IV are parallel to "Shirim mi-tokh yalqut ha-sad" and "Kelulot." At their center the poet places the memory of war, the Land of Israel with its summer landscapes, and the complex of the ties, his own and his comrades', with the land and with those who fell in battle. 3. Part III largely contains poems of ars poetica, and in this respect it is exceptional in this collection, as it has no parallel in the poet's early work. 4. Part V is parallel to " 'Of ha-nedudim" in Pirhey esh; at its center is the Holocaust and the speaker's attempt to contend with its consequences. This part, the middle part in the first edition of Pirhey esh, closes Shirey hotam. Since it concerns the speaker's encounter with the surviving remnant, we shall consider only this fifth part, which may be given the title "Ha-aviv ha-shahor" ("The Black Spring"), from the title of the third poem in the cycle.32 In these poems the antihero, the outsider, of " 'Of ha-nedudim" returns yet again, but with a notably different quality from elsewhere. Here God functions as a father figure, in contrast to the goddess mother figure which appears in the other parts of the book. The female "you" revealed in the previous parts is associated with the figure of the Great Mother, alternately the bearer and burier of her children. The ties of the fighters, the sabras, with the Great Mother are made on an archetypal chessboard, linked to the great female fertility divinities like Anat,33 the Canaanite goddess, sister, and wife 32.

By contrast, when the speaker comes upon the wicked stepmother in the land of post-Nazi Europe, the traditional, divine father figure returns, so to speak, of itself. According to the tradition, this Father-God is to maintain with the entire people of Israel the relationship of a merciful father with each and every one of the persecuted tribe, and of a powerful, omnipotent husband to his bride, the stricken people of Israel. Now the Great Mother is replaced by the female "you" who represents the people of Israel, the Jewish people that have perished: "This night I took the stone heavy with silence / Up from the valley to the mountain. / There is the habitation of your solitary tomb."34 The stranger lays his head on the stone, like his forefather Jacob (Genesis 28:11-20) and it turns into a tombstone on the grave of the female "you," the murdered people of Israel. ,ni~ rT) -'ri - n mw The one who did not bind his head rnimiri0 mE n.

(p. 104) This dirge is marked entirely by the statement of facts and definitions concerning the relationship between the Father-God and his people. The rhetorical arrangement that the speaker constructs is based on an alternating anaphoric oration to God. In this arrangement the speaker alternately addresses the same recipient, God, with two traditional construct cases: "God of... X" and "Father of... Y." These two interchange unvaryingly throughout the discourse. The poem prepares a grand address to the Father-God in the spirit of the normative Jewish tradition, or alternatively a screaming protest of the type of Bialik's "Be-'ir ha-harega" ("In the City of Slaughter"): "Forgive me, wretched of the world, your God is as poor as you," but not a single one of the expectations is realized. At the end of the text there is no demand to God to use his mighty arm, nor is there any stridency or ridicule regarding the Father-God's impotence. God is the Father of all the X and God of all the Y, but it seems that this does not commit him to anything. This runs counter to the expectation that the God of all the world and the Father of the rejected will step forth to defend them. The technique creates expectations without fulfilling them or disappointing them. It leaves the facts hanging in the air without a formal conclusion. On the one hand, there appears the incapacity of the Father to act for his people, for "the children who turned into cinder";</page><page sequence="22">94 REUVEN SHOHAM and on the other hand, there is an intimation of the spiritual inadequacy of the speaker, "who did not bind his head" (with phylacteries), to contend with the divine Father. The words are uttered as if in condemnation, but remain hanging in the air, awaiting a reader who will add the request, the entreaty, the protest, or the sarcastic mockery. The position expressed by these words is especially effective because in at least two earlier poems (in Part I) the speaker refers to God in the two ways mentioned. On the one hand he denies God--"And over my head the clouds meander / and the heavens are empty of God";35 on the other, in the poem "Baqasha" ("Request"), he affirms God and has faith in his power to act: the speaker addresses God and requests that he protect the hero--"Guard him," a plea repeated anaphorically every other line (p. 29). The appearance of the Father-God is therefore dual, indecisive between affirmation and denial, and this perhaps is what explains the speaker's tendency or need to replace the Great Father with the Great Mother, even though she, by virtue of her inner essence, is a mother who devours her sons and buries them within her. But whoever is swallowed into the womb of Mother Earth has not died in vain. He yields himself to the supreme act of life, the act of fertility: "Afterwards you will return," the living speaker promises his dead comrade in the poem "Az" ("Then"); "Like the warm and heavy fertility. / And your hair is fields. And your two eyes are lakes" (p. 38). To die and be buried in the feminine bosom of Mother Earth, of the Land of Israel, means fulfillment of the mythic mission: assurance of fertility and continuity of life. By contrast, according to the prevalent perceptions at the time, to be incinerated in the ovens of Auschwitz was a wasted, unheroic death, making no contribution to the ethos of the people's redemption and potency, and it takes place before the eyes of the Father, who was supposed to be active but became passive. Gouri activates a thematic scheme here for which the two founding fathers of Hebrew poetry at the beginning of the century were perhaps responsible. On the one hand, there is Haim Nahman Bialik, who in his "Be-'ir ha-harega" ("In the City of Slaughter") has God speak and puts in his mouth the dreadful words referring to the pogrom at Kishinev, frankly blaming the slaughtered: "You the fallen are fallen for nothing, and neither I nor you / Do we know why you died and for what you died / And there is no purpose to your death, just as there is no purpose to your life."36 on the other hand, there is Saul Tchernichowsky, in whose ritualistic poem "Re'i, 35. See the poem "Betekh" [Your house], ibid., p. 25. 36. Bialik, Collected Works (Tel Aviv, 1971), p. 97.</page><page sequence="23">HAIM GOURI AND "THE JEWISH PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED" 95 adama" ("See, Earth") the Jewish father laments the death of his young sons in battle, as he buries them in the soil like seeds in the Mother Earth of Eretz Israel: "Now you cover all these up. Let the plant flourish in its due time! / A hundred gates of glory and strength, sacred to the people of the homeland! / Blessed be their sacrifice in the secret of death, the ransomer of our life in splendor."" Gouri's speaker, in the previous parts, is one of the potential seeds, meant to be planted in the bosom of the Great Mother. He accepts the mythical verdict, is ready to lay down his life, to be bound for sacrifice, as an integral part of existence in the holy, mythical time in which he is living.38 In this respect the position of the speaker is identical to the normative position of the Jewish settlement in Eretz Israel, which accepted these two contrary perceptions as in accord with two different existences: one characterizing the passivity of being sacrificed, that of the fathers' generation on European soil; the other heroic, embodied in the sacrifice of the sons on the soil of Eretz Israel. Both these perceptions, up to a point, explain the attitude of Gouri's speaker to the two sacrifices. Gouri's chief deviation from these norms is linked first of all to the tradition of "Be-'ir ha-harega" and not necessarily to the tradition of "Re'i, adama." His speaker does not accuse the murdered and the slaughtered of going "like sheep to slaughter." Their deaths may have no purpose, but he does not berate them with all the accusations leveled against them by God in "Be'ir ha-harega." The helplessness of those who were burned arouses the pity, no less the guilt feelings, of him who remains alive.

And he is the weeping, and the echo is in the mark of his voice. (Ha-'aharon" ["The Last"], p. 99) The guilt feelings of the living facing the dead have appeared earlier-for example, in Part I of the cycle " 'Al ha-halomot" ("On Dreams") (p. 31), but there the guilt carries no disgrace. The subject is a fighter who has put his life at risk, as have his comrades, the heroic fighters, and blind fate makes the choice: this one to die, that one to live. But before the millions of dead Jews of the incinerators, of whose sacrifice no one sang, and whom almost no one sought to avenge, the Jews who remained silent when led to the ovens of Auschwitz, the tanned sabra stands impotent, as in "Ha-aharon." And he lies in me, supine like a corpse: Because I did not throw my beheaded skull into the sewage, And did not ask for the death of my wretched soul, And the look of my mother from the fire did not pierce me like a And I did not feast my heart on the mice of the plague. (pp. 99-100) He who was burned was selected to be "Nahshon, one of the first," to be "a daily delicacy for the ovens" (p. 100). The man of the ovens becomes a memento of sin for the sabra, the proud son of the land, and not an object for arrogant pity. The sabra hero sheds his heroism and stands a stranger and an outsider not only before aberrant Europe but chiefly before him whose "death was jealous of the death of a dog" and whose "head is as heavy as an entire people" (ibid.). Memory, the memory of the war, the comrades, the fallen, which has been so central a subject throughout the book, does not lose its force here either, but undergoes a change of direction and meaning.</page><page sequence="25">HAIM GOURI AND "THE JEWISH PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED" 97 In the earlier parts memory operated on two planes. On the one hand it fills the speaker as part of the heroic being of the veteran fighter, as part of his yearning for the heroic in the War of Independence, and as part of his heroic Eretz Israel existence. On the other hand, the same war veteran cannot forget his dead comrades, because they always return, obstinately forcing themselves into his mind in the poem "'Al ha-halomot": "The one whom I buried stands before me with his smiles. / The one whose candle I put out came back to touch" (p. 31). In this case memory causes suffering, which seeks the consolation of forgetfulness. But forgetfulness is a remote possibility, because the dead return to touch the living; they are, as it were, merciless, demanding, and the speaker attests of himself that "as if from out of the depths / I open up my life to the shadow of their body. / I know: ... / This is my throat alive in their fist" (ibid.). The request for forgetfulness is an effort to push the dead out of consciousness and at the same time an attempt to become free of the guilt feelings about this forgetfulness. The fighter who has returned from the battlefield tries to live a normal life, to come to terms with the dead, to accept the loss, to be healed. Whoever remains alive at the end of the fighting wishes to become reattached to life, as in the poem "Ha-heshbonot ha-arukim" ("The Long Accounts") (pp. 36-37). But before the dead on European soil matters are otherwise. The speaker does not seek forgetfulness, because he knows that it is the most available and most natural option for him. He does not know the burned ones personally, they were not his comrades on the march and in battle. Therefore he is obliged to swear himself and others to remembrance forever: "And there is no peace for the forgetter, the betrayer / of the memory" ("Ha-aviv ha-shahor" ["The Black Spring"], p. 99). There is something terrifying in this memory that is about to be erased, expunged, of the strange unknown dead who elicit guilt feelings regarding those pale, unlovely Jews with the "gold-teeth smile,"39 they not of Eretz Israel. Here forgetfulness is a real option, and one so simple that it is necessary, absurdly, to wage war against it with vows and oaths. But we avail ourselves of these vows of remembrance and oaths only when we are aware of the shameful wish to forget those whom we wish to forget and must not. Gouri's speaker is aware that this guilt feeling is liable to find escape in forgetfulness or in a profound amnesia. As if there really were no escape from loss of the threatening memory, the speaker addresses the dead Jew right from the opening stanza, thus: "Please forgive the forgetters one 39. Ha-haqira (1980), p. 215.</page><page sequence="26">98 REUVEN SHOHAM thing! / They are more deserving of mercy than you" ("Ha-zekher" ["The Memory"], p. 98). It is difficult to accept that those who forget deserve mercy more than the victims, but what is decisive here is the fact that the speaker conjures himself and others to avoid the consolation of amnesia. The dead do not have the power to come back to the sabra in dreams and relentless grab him by the throat, as do his "fighting comrades" here on the soil of Eretz Israel. They belong to a different existence, which the speaker and his comrades do not share. Therefore, the speaker is obliged to encircle himself with vows and oaths whose purpose is to shore up memory. To sum up, the guilt feeling in Shirey hotam is double. On the one hand, it is the guilt of the hero who has failed in his mission of saving his people from the valley of death in Europe. On the other, it is guilt over the fact that he is unable even to remember his people because he does not know them at all, and he knows that he is liable, all too easily, to sink into forgetfulness. The double guilt feeling leads the speaker to a state of helplessness. He is drawn in a similar way as in Pirhey esh, but more markedly as the antihero, as an alienated stranger. The fact that this is how Shirey hotam ends is perhaps not accidental. In Pirhey esh the parallel section, "Of ha-nedudim" ("Migrant Bird"), is set as the opening and the introduction to the heroic battle, at whose conclusion the hero (with his brothers) redeems the land and the tribe from the claws of the dragon. In Shirey hotam the parallel part concludes the collection. That is, the major-key, springlike ending of Pirhey esh is substituted by a minor-key, wintry ending of one who tried to save his people and failed. Here a fresh avenue opens for a further hypothesis that may explain the metamorphosis that occurs in the character of Gouri's hero in Shoshanat ruhot ("Compass Rose," 1960). In this fourth book of poems one clearly discerns changes in Gouri's poetics in consequence of the new, ironic, poetic climate of the 1960s (introduced to modem Hebrew poetry by poets like Yehuda Amichai, Natan Zach, David Avidan, and Daliya Rabikovitz). In addition to the new poetic influences, the changes may also be part of the development and personal tempering of the poet: the sunlight hero of the early collections, the one of fire and dawn, makes way in Shirey hotam for a veteran soldier, yearning for his heroic past, but also filled with guilt for his failure to fulfill his role in the great battle for the salvation of his people on European soil, and thus his involvement in its catastrophe, even though he</page><page sequence="27">HAIM GOURI AND "THE JEWISH PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED" 99 fulfilled his mission in Eretz Israel. From here it is only one step, perhaps, to the portrait of the Odyssean hero, standing weary and wise at the crossroads, which is Shoshanat ruhot.40 Here too one finds a difference between Gouri's attitude to the survivors and the attitude of the novelist Aharon Appelfeld or the poet Abba Kovner. Appelfeld and Kovner survived the death camps. They knew the Holocaust from within, and therefore their point of view is from the eyes of the survivors themselves. Gouri's viewpoint (at least in his three first books), like that of his contemporary the novelist Hanoch Bartov, is from without, albeit with sympathy and guilt feelings regarding the survivors. His novel 'Isqat ha-shoqolad41 is the first real attempt to overcome this limitation in order to express the horror as seen by the victims themselves, to shed his autobiographical and lyric "I." An experiment like this was possible for him only after he attended the Eichmann trial as an eye-and-ear witness for the daily La-merhav.42 In this collection of essays one can find a statement like this: When this material was taken up by the prosecution and made part of the bill of indictment, when these documents broke out of the silence of the archives, it was as if they were now speaking for the first time ... and that their latent potential had been suddenly actualized. The process released the enormous energy that comes with the realization "now I understand!"43 This realization and understanding gave Gouri the insight and courage not only to see the horror from within but to express it from within. Therefore, Alan Mintz's statement that "the story [of the Eichmann trial] rebounded upon the writer [Gouri] and changed him""44 is only partially true. His first encounter with the survivors (1947) had already changed him, as we saw above, and the Eichmann trial was only the catalyst in a very painful process that enabled Gouri to feel and express the inexpressible. At the trial, Gouri attests, he learned 40. See his poems "Oto 'erev be-Mabion" [This evening in Mabion] and "Odysseus" in Shosanat ruhot, pp. 85-86, 115-116. 41.

Each of the prosecution witnesses was, therefore, the hero of an act of rescue. I refer to the rescue of the testimonies of these unfortunate people from the danger of being perceived as all alike, all shrouded in the same immense anonymity.45 Alan Mintz is right when he states that in The Chocolate Deal Gouri manages to get out of himself as a sabra in order to express not only the guilt feelings of his generation but the impossible and surrealistic world of the survivors.46 However, Gouri succeeded in this only after many efforts in his poetry from the late 1940s to the early 1960s. The long and painful process culminated in The Chocolate Deal, but this novel is certainly not the end of the theme in Gouri's poetry. University of Haifa Haifa, Israel 45.
