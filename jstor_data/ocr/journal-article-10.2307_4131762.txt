<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael Walzer, Menachem Lorberbaum, Noam J. Zohar and Ari Ackerman, eds. The Jewish Political Tradition. Volume Two: Membership. New Haven: Yale Uni- versity Press, 2003. 656 pp. For too long, scholars have denied that "Jewish political thought" constitutes a viable field of study. Without a sovereign state, scholars argue, Jews lacked oc- casion to debate the questions of power, obligation, and authority that preoccupy Western political theorists. The Jewish Political Tradition offers a devastating re- buttal to this argument, for it reconstructs a continuous and vibrant tradition of Jewish political thought. Edited jointly by Michael Walzer, an eminent political theorist, and Israeli scholars associated with the Shalom Hartman Institute, this ambitious anthology (two of four volumes have now been published) pairs pri- mary texts spanning Jewish history with commentary by contemporary scholars. Uncovering political reflection in genres previously ghettoized as legalistic or the- ological (e.g. Midrash, responsa, biblical exegesis), the editors open up an excit- ing field for research. But The Jewish Political Tradition is not merely of scholarly 407</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews interest. Inviting readers "to join the arguments of the texts, to interpret and eval- uate, to revise or reject, the claims made by their authors," the editors insist that the tradition remains a vital resource for contemporary Jews (8). Indeed, the proj- ect makes an audacious (and salutary) contribution to Israeli debates: Against ad- vocates of a state ruled by halakhah, the editors contend that traditional Jewish texts sanction toleration, pluralism, and the secularization of politics. In Volume II, the broad question of membership is addressed in chapters on election, social hierarchy, gender hierarchy, converts, heretics and apostates, and gentiles. One of the volume's great achievements is to remind us that "Who is a Jew?" is itself a political question, the subject of controversy, debate, and negoti- ation. Although Jewish thinkers offer myriad answers to the question, their debates generally revolve around two axes: Thinkers both delineate communal boundaries and articulate (or, in later periods, interrogate) hierarchies within the community's borders. The editors link "the possibility of pluralism" to these exercises of bound- ary drawing (3). To the editors' chagrin, certain strands within the tradition advo- cate chauvinism, zealotry, and dogmatism. To their credit, the editors forthrightly acknowledge the ethnocentrism of figures like Yehuda Ha-Levi, whose "genetic account of election" imputes racial superiority to Jews (12). Other strands prove more hospitable to exchange with gentiles, and pluralism among Jews. For example, commentator Donniel Hartman reads Maimonides' tolerant approach to Karaites as a template for interdenominational coexistence. Although Maimonides deems Karaite theology heretical, he preaches tolerance of individuals whose deviance is not their own fault-who were born and raised as Karaites. Moreover, in a re- sponsumn, Maimonides concedes that Karaites are monotheists who share select Rabbanite goals (e.g., praising God, eliminating idolatry) and therefore deserve re- spect. Hartman exhorts contemporary orthodoxy to adopt the latter, ostensibly less patronizing argument for tolerance as a model for interaction with nonorthodox Jews: To foster "mutual accommodation," the orthodox should celebrate nonortho- dox Jews' monotheism and downplay their "heretical" beliefs and practices (359). Hartman's Maimonidean recipe for tolerance is preferable to dogmatism and heresy hunting, which also have traditional warrants. However, nonorthodox Jews may judge Hartman's conciliatory approach an insufficient foundation for plural- ism: To the "heretic," arguments with normative Judaism may have greater weight than areas of consensus. When Hartman dismisses the heretic's challenge as inci- dental, compared to his or her monotheism, he insulates orthodoxy from radical criticism. Hartman's commentary is symptomatic of the volume's approach to plu- ralism. Although contributors uphold diverse religious and political viewpoints, the volume's organization does not always reflect this diversity. Too often, debates about membership are reconstructed from the perspective of the pious. For exam- ple, in the chapter on "Heretics and Apostates," the premodern authors are all stal- warts of normative Judaism. The editors devote an entire section to "Rabbanite Attitudes Toward Karaites" but omit Karaite attitudes toward Rabbanites. Volume I, on "Authority," does excerpt a Karaite text. But in Volume II, the editors' selec- tions validate normative Judaism's decisions about who remains inside, and who is heretical. 408</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Other chapters offer a more expansive view of tradition, enfranchising voices once deemed marginal. Volume II registers women's protests against "reli- giously-sanctioned hierarchical distinctions" and documents secular Zionist redef- initions of Jewish peoplehood (109). While the editors depict secular Zionism as a challenge to orthodox criteria of membership, at times they risk enshrining Zion- ism as a new orthodoxy. According to the editors, premodern Jews defined mem- bership largely through a theological lens. With the advent of modernity, new membership criteria emerge to challenge, and ultimately shatter, the religious mo- nopoly. The editors trace this modern renegotiation to Zionism: "But ethnic, like religious, membership had no secular referent in Jewish history from 70 CE until the end of the nineteenth century, when Zionist writers worked out a new under- standing of Jewish nationhood" (6). When the editors credit Zionists with devel- opment of secular identity, they elide the contribution of Bundists, Yiddishists, and secular humanists. Indeed, the volume implicitly privileges the state of Israel as the most fertile ground for the Jewish political tradition: four of six chapters conclude with (admittedly fascinating) examples from Israeli case law. Immersed in Israeli debates, the editors overlook one of their most powerful insights: Throughout Jewish history, the absence of sovereignty did not mean the absence of politics, because politics takes many forms. More attention to debates in the con- temporary "diaspora" would highlight ways that Jewish membership diverges from Western citizenship. Further, in the absence of an institution, such as the Israeli Supreme Court, which was established to resolve "the hard questions of member- ship," "diaspora" debates remain open-ended and, in a strong sense, political (7). Without a binding legal arbiter, individuals must assume responsibility for nego- tiating the bounds of their own communities. Of course, this remarkable volume is an invaluable resource, and source of inspiration, for these ongoing debates, whether they take place in Israeli courts or American synagogues, universities, and community centers.
