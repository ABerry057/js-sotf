Vol. III: The Family, Vol. IV: Daily Life. Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London: University of California Press, 1978 and 1983. xxi, 522 pp. and xxvi, 487 pp. When Professor Goitein died on February 6, 1985, he had just recently completed and sent off to the publisher the fifth and final volume of his magisterial work, A Mediterranean Society. The book is not only the cul- mination of forty years of Geniza research, in which Goitein had already established himself as the undisputed master, but drew upon a lifetime of scholarship in both Jewish and Islamic studies. The result is one of the most intimate, illuminating, and engrossing reconstructions of a medieval society ever written. Like most truly great works of scholarship, its importance goes far beyond the confines of its specific subject, the Jews of the Islamic Mediterranean from the tenth through the thirteenth century. Because of the relative integration of Jews during this period into the secular aspects of the broader society in which they lived-a fact corroborated by the Geniza documents themselves-this work offers an unparalleled insight into Islamic society at large, particularly into those facets of society which are rarely revealed in the Arabic chronicles and literary sources. Then, too, the book has broad implications for all students of Mediterranean and general</page><page sequence="2">158 BOOK REVIEWS medieval studies due to what Professor Goitein dubbed "The Unity of the Mediterranean World in the 'Middle' Middle Ages."' But most importantly, A Mediterranean Society is a model of how social history as a totality might be studied. In the first volume, Goitein reconstructed the economic life of this society. In the second volume, he surveyed the organization of the Jewish community, its institutions, and its relations with the dominant society and the state. From this depiction of the macrocosm, he proceeded to focus his lense in Volumes III and IV, here under review, upon the microcosm of the family and the physical realia that constituted the material environment in which people lived. (The final volume, which is soon to appear, will focus in upon the individual from the perspectives of what the French would call mentalites et sensibilitis.) In accordance with the overall guiding principle of proceeding from general to particular, in Volume III, Professor Goitein addresses the subject of the extended family, and more particularly the patriarchal family, which in the Geniza world was the primary familial group with which a person identified himself. The primacy accorded to the family is reflected in a variety of ways: in the honor paid to ancestors and agnates through lengthy and solemn memorial commemorations in the synagogue, in the preserva- tion of pedigrees, in the naming of children, and in the widespread practice of endogamy, especially in the form of first-cousin marriage. Interestingly, marriages between uncle and niece seem to have been rare among Jews at the time, perhaps reflecting the negative attitude toward such unions held by all of the other groups in society (Muslims, Christians, and most vociferous- ly the Karaites). The centrality of the extended family was also reflected in joint economic endeavors, which were very common. More significantly, the society at large-Jewish and Muslim-held a person's kith and kin to be financially responsible for him beyond the strict limitations of either the halakha or the shari'a. Despite the social, economic, and legal importance of the extended family, the Geniza records do not indicate that clannish enclaves were the norm, as they were in Yemen, for example, in more recent times. The reason for this, explains Goitein, was primarily economic. Urban property was expensive, and few families could afford to buy blocks of domiciles. Nevertheless, families tried to stay close together. 1. S. D. Goitein, Studies in Islamic History and Institutions (Leiden, 1966), pp. 296-307.

The social ideal, the pre- cise steps taken in arranging and contracting unions, the economic aspects, and the social safeguards are all discussed in detail. The Jews of the medieval Islamic Mediterranean were essentially monogamous even without having a Herem of Rabbenu Gershom. Long before restrictive clauses began appear- ing in Egyptian marriage contracts in the twelfth century, it was already "local custom" recognized by the Jewish court that a man could not take a second wife without the consent of his first spouse or without granting her a divorce, an act which had financial consequences serious enough to give the husband pause. Custom and later express stipulations also gave the wife a veto with respect to the acquisition of slavegirls for the house. Indeed, Goitein interprets the data as suggesting that the latter were considered far more of a cause for concern, due to the prevailing mores of the dominant society, than was the possibility of a second wife. Although the Jewish minority adopted some of the legal terminology of the surrounding majority, Goitein discerns major differences between the Jewish and Muslim institutions of marriage in actual practice at that time, particularly with regard to the property rights of the wife, whose position in Jewish law and customary usage was considerably better than that of her Muslim counterpart. The longest section in Volume III is devoted to the nuclear family. The texture of relations between husband and wife and between parents and chil- dren is examined. Here Goitein candidly wonders, "Can we ever hope to penetrate the arcanum of married life in an age and region so removed from us . . . ?" He points out that the Geniza texts in this instance must be consi- dered as presenting a slanted picture. Official documents by their very nature reflect problems of domestic life (including marital squabbles, wife beating, sexual inadequacies, prolonged separations, and divorce), while due to the strict conventions of the time, private correspondence is extreme- ly circumspect with regard to females generally and says very little at all about the relations between man and wife. In spite of these limitations, Professor Goitein has been able to elicit a considerable body of information from the sources. The picture of the relations between parent and child is far better docu- mented. In a male-oriented society such as the Geniza world, sons were of course preferred, for religious, social, and economic reasons. However, there is no lack of texts showing the genuine affection of a father for his daughter. It was considered auspicious for the first child to be a girl, since</page><page sequence="4">160 BOOK REVIEWS this not only warded off the evil eye that threatened the birth of firstborn sons, but also provided a mother's helper to assist in the care of future sons. Furthermore, Goitein concludes that "even among common people, blaming a wife for producing a girl must have been regarded as improper." It is striking that in a society where blood ties were regarded so highly, frequent mention is made of foster children. Raising orphans, both boys and girls-and in the case of the latter, providing for their marriage-was consi- dered to be a highly meritorious act. In times of disaster, such as the Crusades, there was an increase in the number of orphaned and homeless children to be cared for. Although adoption is not a concept in either hala- kha or shari'a, Goitein deduces that "the Jewish courts had considerable experience in these matters," on the basis of a detailed record of an actual adoption, referred to in a carefully formulated document as a "sale." The problems of widowhood, divorce, and inheritance complete the chapter on the nuclear family. Divorce was frowned upon, but was appar- ently much more common than in later European Jewish society. Custom and social pressures made divorce more complex and less one-sided in actual practice than in talmudic legal theory. In many if not most of the divorce cases for which detailed information is available, Goitein suspects that the wives were the initiators of the proceedings. The financial settle- ments recorded in the Geniza do not seem to have been pro forma, but, on the contrary, were extremely variegated. The last chapter of Volume III leads us into "The World of Women." The position of women in the Geniza world was by no means unified. Geo- graphy and rank were significant factors. Despite the prevailing ideals of modesty, subordinance, and seclusion, women in Egypt were less restricted during this period than in other Muslim lands. Women sometimes did ven- ture into the public domain to earn a livelihood, to appear in court, and to travel. There were even some independent women, hitherto known to us only from literary representations in The Thousand and One Nights. Some women were educated and literate, although on the whole the educational gap between males and females was great. Still, Jewish society was far less segregated than Muslim society. Jewish homes rarely had separate women's quarters. "There was privacy, but no purdah." Volume IV, Professor Goitein informs us, was originally supposed to have been the final one and to have included both the physical outer envi- ronment and the spiritual inner world of the Geniza people, with the main emphasis upon the latter. However, he confesses, as his work progressed, he came to the realization that "what really occupied the mind" of the Jews whose voices come through to us in the Geniza correspondence were "prac-</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 161 tical matters and physical objects." He is quick to caution the reader not to conclude that religion did not permeate medieval life. It did for Jews, Chris- tians, and Muslims. But for the most part "religion formed the frame rather than the content of the daily existence." And so, the fourth volume is a detailed vade mecum depicting the city, the home, clothing, adornments, food, and drink that constituted the realia of the medieval Middle Eastern Jew's daily life. Already by the tenth century, the Jews of the Islamic world had become a predominantly urban people. The city, therefore, was the natural environ- ment of the Geniza people. Using Fustat as his primary example, Goitein leads us through its quarters, bazaars, and alleys, pointing out caravan- serais, public buildings, ruins, other landmarks, and even the sewage system. The medieval Islamic city was not a city in the Weberian sense. It "was a place where one lived, not a corporation to which one belonged." Neverthe- less, people had strong sentiments for their watan ("hometown" in medieval Geniza usage), which they expressed in writing. They also had a notion of concern for their fellow townspeople which was captured by the term baladiyya. On the other hand, medieval Jewish society was a mobile one, and the bond between a man and his hometown was like a marriage. It could be severed. After touring the city, Goitein leads us into the home of a middle-class family and provides a meticulous description of the structure and its layout. The tour takes us from the underground storage chamber (matmara) to the main floor, or gd'a, and the upper portion of the house ('alw), which might consist of more than one floor (tabaqa). On the way we are even provided with glimpses of the pantry and the ventilation shafts. The first two appen- dixes at the end of the volume outline in tabular form an overview of the purchase and rental costs of urban domestic real estate. The furnishings of the interior are described next. As in the later Islamic world, there was very little in the way of wooden furniture in the house other than a few chests for storage. Cushions, mattresses, carpets, mats, and curtains were the norm. Other objects in the living quarters were lamps, candlesticks, braziers, and censers. On the basis of the abundance of lighting appliances brought by Jewish brides as part of their trousseaux, Goitein believes that middle-class homes were better illuminated in the Geniza period than was the case in the first half of the nineteenth century as described by Lane. After furnishings comes a description of housewares, down to such details as the flyswatters (some had silver handles!) used by people while dining to keep away the ubiquitous pests. People were quite clothes-conscious during the Fatimid and early Ayyu-</page><page sequence="6">162 BOOK REVIEWS bid periods, and the Jews were no exception. Throughout most of this time, the Islamic discriminatory laws regulating dhimmi dress were not in force, and therefore much of the information from the Geniza is of the highest importance for general Islamic costume history. Layers of robes, elaborate turbans for males (including schoolboys), and a variety of headdresses and veils for women were standard attire. Clothing could be colorful, ornate, and of costly fabrics, such as silk, brocade, and fine linen. Special garments for Sabbaths and holidays were considered absolutely de rigueur for any self-respecting person. The hundreds of ketubbot from the Geniza indicate that middle- and upper-class Jewish brides normally brought a consi- derable wardrobe with them as part of their wedding trousseaux. Unfor- tunately, there are no such detailed lists of the personal wardrobes owned by men, although data on male attire can be gleaned from correspondence, commercial inventories, and other documents. The great variety of jewelry that is carefully described in the Geniza trousseau lists and other documents, such as wills, are invariably of gold, silver, and gemstones. Costume jewelry was certainly worn by the masses of women, since beads, corals, cowry shells, and other such items appear fre- quently and in great quantities in Geniza mercantile documents. Whether they were worn by Jewish women, we can only guess. The account of how people adorned their bodies is followed by an expo- sition of how they nourished them. Bread, of course, was the staff of life. An average family needed about an irdabb (about 70 kilos) of wheat per month. Whenever possible a family tried to store up a year's supply as a hedge against price fluctuations. As is common practice in many Muslim countries up to the present, dough for bread was prepared at home and taken to a public oven for baking. Vegetables were also a major constituent of the medieval Jewish diet. Fowl and meat were reserved mainly for Sabbaths and festivals. Household accounts for meat and groceries show how a middle- class family's budget looked both on weekdays and special occasions. Wine, beer, and various soft drinks were the usual beverages. In talmudic and ancient times, wine had been an integral part of the daily Jewish diet. During the Islamic Middle Ages, however, it appears that wine-substitutes, juices, and sherbets largely replaced wine as the weekday drink of middle-class Jews. The survey of material culture concludes with a brief discussion of riding animals. A mount was a status symbol to which, Goitein points out, people related in a number of respects that parallel modern man and his car. A respectable member of the middle class could afford a modest riding beast</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS 163 costing around 4 to 6 dinars. A common workingman could not. Very few Jews were in a position to purchase thoroughbred mules and elegant saddlery, which in any case was considered to be dangerously ostentatious for a non-Muslim. A man who heard rumors that his brother had received an expensive mule and saddle from an Arab chieftain wrote to warn his brother of gossip and prayed that God would preserve him from the evil eye. In citing this Geniza letter, Goitein in one stroke has taught us about family ties, material culture, social relations, and the concerns of Jews living in medieval Muslim society not to be overly conspicuous. Here, as in so many instances, Goitein's discerning eye finds those personal details that breathe real life into his historical reconstruction. Professor Goitein was a great humanist, a master teacher, and a consum- mate artist. In Volumes III and IV of A Mediterranean Society, he offers us a remarkable and indeed a majestic vision of the ordinary aspects of the life of the Jews of the medieval Muslim world. Norman A.
