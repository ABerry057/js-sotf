<plain_text><page sequence="1">David M. Gunn and Danna Nolan Fewell. Narrative Art in the Hebrew Bible. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. xvi, 263 pp. D. M. Gunn and D. N. Fewell's Narrative in the Hebrew Bible is a welcome addition to the growing body of works on biblical narrative. It beautifully combines theoretical narratological analysis with original readings of specific biblical texts. Although issues are approached in the manner of an introduction, offering clear and helpful definitions and attempting to place the current literary study of the Bible in its historical context, the material is certainly of interest to specialists as well. An extensive bibliography adds to the book's scholarly value. The book begins by seeking to place the literary criticism of the Bible within the larger history of biblical interpretation. A survey of the varied ways that Genesis 4 has been read over the millennia focuses this discussion. While such a survey is wonderful in conception, the actual review of exegesis is problematic, particularly from a Jewish perspective. Philo and Targum</page><page sequence="2">128 BOOK REVIEWS Jonathan are chosen to represent the Jewish tradition. These two ancient commentaries reflect a narrow segment of the premodern Jewish interpretation of the Bible. The wealth of medieval Jewish biblical commentary is in many ways a precursor to the modem literary criticism of the Bible. Yet Fewell and Gunn seem to be unfamiliar with medieval Jewish sources. They also omit any reference to modem Hebrew writing on the Bible, except some that is translated into English. My point is not that any work on biblical literature must refer to the full range of Jewish commentary, but that the representation of Jewish exegesis in Fewell and Gunn's book is highly skewed. This problem of comprehensiveness is then compounded by the authors' overwhelming reliance on Robert Alter, to the exclusion of most other significant modem literary critics. The chapters that engage in purely textual analysis make for enjoyable as well as enlightening reading. Fewell and Gunn regard what is "in the text" as the result of subjective determinations. Accordingly, they feel free to psychologize and to otherwise produce rich and diverse interpretations. The interpretive chapters of the book clearly demonstrate the wide range of the Bible's potential meaning. The selfishness of Judah, the education of Jonah, and the bravery of the Jews in the Book of Daniel are each extensively explored. In a particularly insightful chapter, the authors present a novel interpretation of the binding of Isaac. They identify the central question of Genesis 22 as whether Abraham, who has thus far been willing to sacrifice every member of his family in one way or another, will be willing to risk his own safety to save his son. Will he bravely refuse God's request, thus putting himself at considerable risk? In essence, Abraham failed the test, but he did prove, at least, that he feared God as much as he feared others. Similarly unconventional readings are made possible by Fewell and Gunn's use of feminist criticism. By approaching the text from a nonpatriar- chal point of view, they add another dimension to the narrative. They identify as an issue the theme of the woman who suffers as punishment for a man's sins, such as Bathsheba, who loses her son in 2 Samuel 11, and David's concubines, who must live as widows in 2 Samuel 20. It is in these readings that Fewell and Gunn maximize their psychologizing in order to support their readings. They consistently "read in" praise of the woman, often at the male character's expense. For example, as they see it, Jephthah's daughter selflessly goes out to greet her father with the intent to save others from being victimized by his reckless vow. She will be his only victim. In this view,</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 129 Jephthah's daughter reproves her father, showing him his recklessness and cruelty, and passing sentence upon him. In another reading, they understand Absalom in 2 Samuel 13 as dismissing Tamar after she is raped by Amnon, and do not credit him for avenging her demise. While to many, Absalom's motives for waiting to act are strategic-first seeing if David would respond, and then letting Amnon become complacent-Fewell and Gunn take his motives to be political: "to possess the kingdom" (p. 151). They lend no credence to the fact that Absalom ultimately names his own daughter after the sister whom he loved, Tamar, thus allowing her name to live on (2 Sam 14:27). While I agree that there is no single "true" interpretation that renders any others false, it is troubling to me that Fewell and Gunn do not allow for positive male characters in biblical narratives that also feature females. By seeming to counter-read the text, Fewell and Gunn do not provide the foundations for reading the Bible within the constraints of linguistic and rhetorical considerations and with attentiveness to the text in its full complexity. However, their readings "against the grain" may lead readers to view texts from a fresh perspective. Ora Horn Prouser Jewish Theological Seminary of America New York, N.Y.</page></plain_text>
