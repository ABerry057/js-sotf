Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1998. 246 pp.</page><page sequence="2">156 BOOK REVIEWS The centerpiece of this study, Ost und West, was a widely distributed magazine published in Berlin between 1901 and 1923 by westernized Jews who had migrated to Germany from Eastern Europe. Ost und West was in the vanguard of the embryonic Jewish cultural renaissance in late Imperial Germany that blossomed during the Weimar Republic. It was the first of several Jewish periodicals in Germany to promote the East European Jew, or Ostjude, to a German Jewish audience. The magazine highlighted Jewish life in Eastern Europe in numerous articles, illustrations, and short stories in translation by Yiddish writers. If the "enlightened" Western Jew, or Westjude, personified an ossified form of Judaism, the Ostjude, characterized by his organic connection with all aspects of the Jewish experience, represented the "authentic Jew." According to Brenner, the objective of this enterprise was to "market" Jewish particularism or a "pan-Jewish ethnic identity"--that is, a synthesis of the eastern tradition with Western enlightened Judaism-to West European Jews in general and German Jews in particular. The inaugural issue of Ost und West expressed the hope that the magazine would bring the "culturally different elements of Judaism closer together." Implied in this official program, Brenner argues, was an exhortation to West European Jews to welcome Jewish diversity. The main protagonist of Brenner's study is Leo Winz (1876-1952), a transplanted Ukrainian Jew and cultural Zionist who evolved into the savvy and prosperous publisher of several Jewish periodicals, not the least of which was Ost und West. Winz was part of a wave of Russian Jewish students who flocked to Germany, and especially Berlin, from the 1880s to 1914, not merely to flee from persecution but because Germany symbolized freedom and social mobility. Notwithstanding their attraction to the West, Winz and his associates remained poised between two worlds, maintaining their steadfast commitment to the culture of Eastern European Jewry. In the world of Jewish journalism, Winz was a pioneer in the use of sophisticated media techniques to broaden the appeal of his magazine's message-the advocacy of a minority consciousness among West European Jews. Particularly enlightening is Brenner's discussion of the mutability and interchangeability of the positive and negative stereotypes of the Ostjude and Westjude. After only three years of publication, the positive stereotype of the Ostjude in Ost und West was gradually superseded by the negative image of the shallow, materialistic, self-hating Westfude. Winz and his associates felt compelled</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 157 to assail the Westjude because the positive repackaging of the East European Jew alone was insufficient to guarantee the victory of a pan-European Jewish identity. The negative image of the Western Jew in Ost und West reflected a redirected strategy to appeal to the fear of loss of Jewish identity through assimilation. These bipolar stereotypes could coexist because they represented flip sides of the same coin; both were marketing techniques designed to advance the cause of a pan- European Jewish identity. Brenner's book has much to commend it. It is a valuable exploration of the maturation of the Jewish periodical press in early twentieth-century Germany. In addition, it nicely dovetails with several earlier studies of the meeting of the cultures of the Jewries of Western and Eastern Europe, each with its own set of spiritual values and cultural codes. In particular, Brenner's emphasis on "marketing identities" nicely underscores the guilt-free commodification and appropriation of an idealized image of the Ostjude in late Imperial Germany. Its examination of the attraction of women to the message in Ost und West is especially illuminating. The plight of East European Jews appealed to the philanthropic inclinations of German Jewish women, while negative stereotypes of the Western Jewish male parvenu expressed their distaste for male social climbing. For all of its many merits, this study ultimately begs the question. In support of his thesis, Brenner assumes the formative influence of Ost und West on Jewish self- consciousness. I find the basis for this assumption-the magazine's considerable circulation and the occasional brouhaha created by one of its editorials-rather attenuated. Brenner was unable to find contemporary attestation of the impact of Ost und West on individual Jews. By the same token, he gives short shrift to the maturation already in late Imperial Germany of an indigenous German Jewish identity with its amalgamation of German and Jewish culture. According to Brenner, Ost und West was marketed to appeal in particular to middle-class German Jews, especially women. To be sure, Ost und West and similar German Jewish periodicals enriched the construction of a bourgeois German Jewish identity, but a form of Jewish orientalism does not seem to have played a significant role in the daily life of the great majority of middle-class German Jews before 1914. In a similar vein, Brenner overstates the extent to which the positive evocation of the Ostjude engendered German Jewish open-mindedness to ethnic Jewish pluralism. The favorable image of the Ostjude in the Jewish press before 1914 may have</page><page sequence="4">158 BOOK REVIEWS sensitized German Jews to the plight of Eastern European Jewish war refugees and whetted the appetite of an elite minority in the Weimar period to sample East European Jewish music and theater, but sympathy for and admiration of the exotic other are not tantamount to acceptance. Indeed, Brenner argues that Winz increasingly abandoned the positive stereotype of the Ostjude in favor of the negative stereotype of the Westjude because the former failed to resonate among German Jewish readers. Brenner also concedes that relations between German Jews and the migrants from Eastern Europe were often far from friendly. The impression made on German Jewry by the encounter during World War I of German Jewish soldiers on the eastern front with East European Jews doubtless marked a watershed in German Jewish identity. But the German Jewish cultural renaissance in the Weimar Republic was impelled in equal if not larger measure by the community's collective experience of antisemitism during World War I and in its aftermath, which left the majority of German Jews with a bewildered sense of insecurity, disillusionment, and betrayal. Notwithstanding the valuable insights provided by this and similar books, perhaps the time has come to expand the research agenda in this area from an examination of the German Jewish perception and instrumentalization of the Ostjude to explorations of the mental and material life of flesh-and-blood East European Jews in German cities and towns. It would be interesting to know the first impressions of the "greenhorn" from Brody or Tarnow upon settling in Leipzig or Stuttgart. What were their working conditions like? What kinds of spiritual and emotional compromises were they compelled to make in their new surroundings? How did they represent themselves to one other in their own vibrant periodical press published in Germany in Yiddish, Polish, and Russian? Valuable research in this direction has already been done for several other Jewish communities, from the Leopoldstadt in Vienna to the Plezl in Paris to the Lower East Side. But with a couple of notable exceptions (e.g., Ludger Heid, Maloche-nicht Mildtatigkeit: Ostjfidische Arbeiter in Deutschland, 1914-1923 [Hildesheim, 1995]), this is still largely uncharted-and therefore beckoning--territory in German Jewish historiography.
