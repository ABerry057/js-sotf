<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Christopher R. Seitz. Zion's Final Destiny: The Development of the Book of Isaiah; A Reassessment of Isaiah 36-39. Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1991. xii, 228 pp. Although Christopher Seitz's study focuses especially on Isaiah 36-39, it must be considered in relation to the current debate on the formation of the Book of Isaiah as a whole. Appearing at the centennial of the publication of Bernhard Duhm's epoch-making commentary on Isaiah, Seitz's volume attempts to redirect scholarly attention away from a dominant concern with establishing the original literary works of First, Second, and Third Isaiah. He maintains that Duhm's commentary prompted readings of Second Isaiah that placed the prophet outside of the land of Israel among the exiles in Babylonia. This resulted in an overly historicized approach to Isaiah for the last one hundred years that overlooked Duhm's original concern with the means by which the works of three Isaiahs were combined to form a single book. Presupposing recent studies that point to the pivotal role of Isaiah 36-39 within the structure of the Book of Isaiah, Seitz attempts to address this question anew. Essentially, his study proceeds from two questions: (1) what were the nature and form of the developing Isaiah traditions? and (2) why was the message of the eighth-century prophet extended into the exilic and postexilic periods? Based upon his analysis of Isaiah 36-39, Seitz argues that "the Book of Isaiah grew out of a concern to understand and then adumbrate Zion's final destiny" (p. x). He calls into question prevailing scholarly approaches that exclude Isaiah 36-39 from the Isaiah tradition, based upon Gesenius' 77</page><page sequence="2">78 BOOK REVIEWS original arguments that Isaiah 36-39 derives originally from Kings, and that a smoothed-over version of this narrative was placed at the end of First Isaiah to close off the collection. He argues that 2 Kings 18:14-16 appears to be an editorial insertion into the Kings narrative that was motivated by the Deuteronomistic History's concern with the continued Assyrian threat to Judah during the reigns of Manasseh and Josiah; it is therefore not a deletion from the Isaiah version that was designed to idealize Hezekiah. According to Seitz, the portrayal of Hezekiah was positive from the beginning. Based on his arguments that the rejection of foreign alliances in Isaiah 1-35 is consistent with the portrayal in Isaiah 36-37 of a righteous Hezekiah who conforms to the will of YHWH, Seitz affirms K. Smelik's view that Isaiah 36-37 constitutes a unified narrative that was set originally within the Book of Isaiah. Seitz maintains that the purpose of this narrative and the early Isaiah tradition was to remind Manasseh to conform to the will of YHWH and thereby to alleviate the Assyrian threat, based upon the model of Hezekiah's faith and obedience. The composition of the narrative concerning Hezekiah's illness in Isaiah 38 presupposes that of Sennacherib's death in Isaiah 36-37; it correlates the illness of Hezekiah with that of Jerusalem (cf. Isa 1:5b-6) to demonstrate the benefits of faithfulness. The narrative concerning the Babylonian embassy to Hezekiah in Isaiah 39/ 2 Kings 20:12-19 originated in the Deuteronomistic History's concern with the Babylonian destruction of Judah in 597-587. The subsequent inclusion of this narrative in Isaiah facilitates the transition between First and Second Isaiah and the book's concern with Zion's final destiny in light of the Babylonian exile; it emphasizes that Isaiah's final word was not recovery, but exile. Seitz points to images of Zion's vicarious suffering in Second Isaiah as an indication of Zion's final destiny, but a full analysis is left for a future study. There are a number of points on which Seitz's work can be criticized. It is difficult to understand why a narrative that is generically consistent with the Book of Kings should originate in the Book of Isaiah with its prophetic oracles. The correspondences between Isaiah 7:1-9:6, with its mixture of narrative and oracular material, and Isaiah 36-39 suggest that the former was modeled on the latter, and that the latter originated outside of Isaiah. His observations on the intrusive character of 2 Kings 18:14-16 are to the point, but the editorial addition of these verses hardly demonstrates an original setting of the Hezekiah narrative in the Book of Isaiah rather than in</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 79 Kings. I. W. Provan has demonstrated that an earlier version of the Hezekiah narrative may well have concluded a Josianic edition of the Deuteronomistic History in which Hezekiah served as a model for Josiah. Clearly, such a narrative would need to be adjusted in light of the fall of Jerusalem in 587. Hezekiah's capitulation to Sennacherib demonstrates that even a righteous monarch suffers in the Book of Kings, and his reception of a Babylonian embassy anticipates the catastrophe. Why then should 2 Kings 20:12-19 be carried over into Isaiah, and not 2 Kings 18:14-16? Finally, Seitz's argument that the disobedient Manasseh needed to be reminded of the rewards of righteousness rings somewhat hollow when one reads that he was dragged off to Babylon by the Assyrians in 2 Chronicles 33:10-13. These criticisms should not overshadow Seitz's contribution to the dis- cussion of Isaiah 36-39 and its relation to the formation of the Book of Isaiah as a whole. He has broken the strictly historical mold by which scholars have considered these chapters and has pointed to their pivotal role in joining the two halves of the Book of Isaiah. But most importantly, he has pointed to the fact that the seeds of the growth of the Book of Isaiah are to be found within the tradition of First Isaiah itself. The Book of Isaiah grew not because Isaiah was a prophet of judgment alone; rather the tradition indicates that Isaiah articulated a future for Zion even in the face of the Assyrian threat. In short, Seitz's work will be foundational for all future research on the formation of the Book of Isaiah. Marvin A. Sweeney University of Miami Coral Gables, Fla.</page></plain_text>
