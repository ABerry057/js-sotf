<plain_text><page sequence="1">Raphael Patai. The Jewish Alchemists: A History and Sourcebook. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994. xiv, 617 pp. For many years alchemy was defined in many dictionaries and encyclo- pedias as the immature chemistry of the Middle Ages or as a collection of nonscientific, superstitious beliefs characterized by efforts to transmute base metals into gold and a search for the elixir of life. Both definitions are partial and full of prejudice. Today it is accepted that alchemy played an important role in the intellectual history of mankind. Great scientists like Sir Isaac Newton had a vivid interest in alchemy, and the "great art" had an honorable place as a literary theme and an artistic motif; in addition it was an element in certain medical practices and theories, and played a central role in the development of technology. Similar kinds of prejudice occurred in relation to the role of Jews in the</page><page sequence="2">172 BOOK REVIEWS practice, development, and diffusion of alchemy. It was commonly said that Jews had no role in this field; that "Jews and alchemy don't walk together." Until Raphael Patai's Jewish Alchemists: A History and Source Book, this assumption went unchallenged. But new research on alchemy and the Jews has come to light. Patai's book is a milestone in attempting to locate and reevaluate the place of alchemy in Jewish culture over the last two thousand years, from the Hellenistic period until the nineteenth century. This enterprise has required very hard work and a breadth of knowledge, not only because of the length of time it covers and the ever-changing cultural milieu in which the Jewish people have lived through the ages, but mainly because this book is probably the pioneer attempt to establish the place of Jews in the field of alchemy, using both Jewish sources (some of them virtually unknown until now) and non-Jewish sources which quote Jewish alchemists or Jewish works in the field. In this book Patai reveals the alchemical affiliation of some outstand- ing Jewish thinkers, such as the famous Safed kabbalist Hayyim Vital (1542-1620). Here Patai gives an extended analysis of a manuscript which shows Vidal's alchemical knowledge. It is impossible within the scope of this review to analyze all the information that Patai provides on Jews who were connected to alchemy. About the intellectual work of one of them, Benjamim Mussafia from Hamburg (chap. 34), I have previously conducted some research and hence have some specific remarks to make. First of all, Patai does not quote directly from Mussafia's work on alchemy, Me Zahav (Epistola de Auro Potabili), which is accessible in photostatic copy at the Friedenwald Collection at the Jewish National and University Library. Instead Patai uses a secondary source, Jakob Schudt's Jiidische Merkwiirdigkeiten (Frankfurt and Leipzig, 1714-18), in particular volume 3, pp. 327-339. The second point is that Patai does not quote or mention another Jewish physician, Jacob Rosales, who lived in Hamburg at the time of Mussafia and was also attached to alchemy. The fact that at least two Jewish physicians who lived in the same city are known to have been attached to alchemy seems an important point for research on the place of alchemy in Jewish culture. More interesting still is the fact that neither Mussafia nor Rosales used alchemy in his medical practice, and there is no proof that they made any alchemical experiments. This means that to them alchemy was more a theoretical than a practical field of interest and that they practiced medicine in the traditional Galenian manner rather than in connection to alchemy, as according to the Paracelsian school. Why their</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 173 writings show a close connection to alchemy is therefore a question that begs for an answer. Maybe this kind of "contradiction" was more common in the history of alchemy than we imagine. Perhaps the most interesting personage discussed by Patai is the Comte of Saint-Germain, the mysterious eighteenth-century alchemist, diplomat, and adventurer who was reputed to be immortal and omniscient. Patai shows some indications that Saint Germain might have been a Jew. Here we have to ask a central question: if someone like the Comte of Saint-Germain was a Jew, how is this fact relevant for research on Jewish intellectual history and Jewish thought? In other words, is it reasonable to describe someone like the Comte of Saint-Germain, who played no role in Jewish thought, and whose Jewishness, in any case, is an open question and a conjecture, as a "Jewish alchemist"? Patai himself tries to answer this question in the conclusion of his book ("A Profile of Jewish Alchemy"), but it is very interesting that the title of the final chapter differs significantly from that of the book. "Jewish alchemists," the phrase used in the title of the book, implies an attempt to establish the place of Jews in alchemy, rather than some kind of "synthesis" between Jewish thought and alchemy, but in the closing chapter Patai writes about "Jewish alchemy." The difference here is not just semantic, for it would appear that Patai, at the end of the book, relies on apologetics. For instance, he writes that Jewish alchemists "saw in alchemy a God-given gift, and therefore considered engaging in alchemical work a God-pleasing religious activity" (p. 518), but it is not clear why such behavior should define "Jewish alchemy." Almost every alchemist, Jewish or not, saw his art as a kind of religious activity; there is no proof that any Jewish religious practice was influenced by alchemy. More relevant than this is Patai's good work and great effort, which have opened a field for new research. Patai himself sketches the main contours of this research when he writes, in regard to a possible comparison between the place of alchemy in Jewish thought and the place of Kabbalah and Hasidism: Although Kabbalah and Hasidism reflected outside influences, they were specifically Jewish phenomena. Jewish alchemists, on the other hand, even though they played an important role in the origin, development, transmission, and spread of alchemy, were nevertheless only a small group of adepts in comparison to the large number of non-Jewish alchemists. . . . although</page><page sequence="4">174 BOOK REVIEWS Kabbalah and Hasidism were mass movements among the Jewish people ... alchemy was always confined to a few individuals. (p. 7) Despite their small number, individuals who were preoccupied with alchemy, as Patai shows us, were present throughout Jewish history. Learning about them and their works is now, after this book, an obligation for Jewish scholarship. Francisco Moreno-Carvalho Hebrew University of Jerusalem Jerusalem, Israel</page></plain_text>
