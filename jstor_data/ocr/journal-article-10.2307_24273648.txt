This article contextua lizeslizes the particular rabbinic dilemma of study versus sustenance within the the broader context of the Zoroastrian tradition and its critique of the ManichaeanManichaean Elect. The rabbis shared with their Zoroastrian contem porariesporaries not only the perception of a religious tension between agriculture agriculture and the pursuit of religious studies, but also a multifaceted array array ofpossible solutions that attempt to harmonize, mitigate, or other wise wise resolve this theological and practical tension. While the basic conflict conflict between study and sustenance is already formulated in tannaitic works,works, it is argued that the unique perspective offered by the Babylonian Talmud engages, and perhaps reacts to, the Iranian tradition. Introduction The question of the extent to which ascetic ideology and practice is reflected in talmudic culture has long occupied the minds of scholars and remains a hotly debated issue to this day. The essentialist and ideologically motivated dis course that held sway during the nineteenth and most of the twentieth century' has been replaced by a more sophisticated and nuanced discussion in recent decades,2 which acknowledges the wide array of meanings and practices I would like to thank Jeffrey Rubenstein, Yaakov Elman, and Prods Oktor Skjaervo for their invaluable comments and suggestions. 1.

By his definition, asceticism is "the exercise of disciplined effort toward the goal of spiritual perfection (however understood) which requires abstention (whether total or partial, permanent or temporary, individualistic or communalistic) from the satisfaction of otherwise permitted earthly, creaturely desires.5'5 Using a similar methodology, Michael Satlow and Eliezer Diamond have independently concluded that the ideal of talmud torah functions in rabbinic culture as an ascetic ideology, as the rabbis often advocate intellectual, spiritual, and physical toil, as well as different forms of abstention and restraint, in the course of Torah study.6 This does not mean, of course, that asceticism is the only prism through which the rabbis viewed the study of Torah, nor does it indi cate that all the rabbis shared this point of view, but simply that asceticism is one of several lenses through which the rabbis construed the ideology of talmud torah. As Satlow writes: Culture,Culture, by Eliezer Diamond, JAAR 73, no. 3 (2005): 911-913; Lawrence M. Wills, "Ascetic Theology before Asceticism? Jewish Narratives and the Decentering of the Self," JAAR 74, no. 4 (2006): 902-925; Yishai Kiel, "'Al ta'anit u-meni'at mazon ba-talmud ha-bavli le-'or ha-'ide'ologyah ha-zoro'astrit," Jewish Studies Internet Journal 12 (2013): 1-28. 3. General studies relating to asceticism tend to distinguish between different types of ascetic expressions. Scholars have distinguished between total and partial abstention; permanent and tempor ary forms of renunciation; individualistic and communalistic forms of asceticism; negative renunciation and affirmative spiritual training; the ascetic training of one's body, soul, and will to pursue religious perfection and "dualistic" forms of asceticism that advocate an ontological departure from the body; "mystical" asceticism aimed at one's unification with the divine and asceticism that is intended to sup press the body; the escaping of the world and inwardly asceticism; and so on and so forth.

As such, talmud torah cannot be viewed as a sui generis religious activity. By construing talmud torah in this manner, the rabbis were participating in the broader spiritual landscape of late antiquity, of which asceticism was an important component. Although their means differed, ancient rabbis, pagan philosophers, and church fathers were all engaged in a similar quest to perfect the individual through physical and mental discipline in order to bring him or her closer to the divine.7 Drawing on the understanding of talmud torah in terms of ascetic ideology, this article seeks to examine a set of talmudic traditions that portray a theological, exe getical, and practical tension that emerges from the confrontation of the ideal of ceaseless and perpetual study of Torah, on the one hand, and the notion of worldly occupation, on the other. This fundamental tension is emblematically expressed in Sifrei Devarim through the juxtaposition of two verses. On the one hand, it is stipulated that "this book of the Torah shall not depart out of your mouth; you shall meditate on it day and night5' (Joshua 1:8),8 but, on the other hand, it is said that "you shall9 gather in your grain, your wine, and your oil" (Deuteronomy 11:14).10 While some form of conflict between spiritual pursuits and mundane needs characterizes ascetic systems in general, this article will contextualize the particu lar rabbinic dilemma of study versus sustenance within the broader context of the Zoroastrian tradition and its critique of the Manichaean Elect. The rabbis shared with their Zoroastrian contemporaries not only the perception of a religious tension between agriculture and the pursuit of religious studies, but also a multifaceted array of possible solutions that attempt to harmonize, mitigate, or otherwise resolve this theological tension. While the basic conflict between study and sustenance is already formulated in tannaitic works, the unique perspec tive offered by the Babylonian Talmud invokes, and perhaps reacts to, the Zoroas trian and Manichaean traditions. Despite the predominance of the ideal of talmud torah in the rabbinic culture of Sasanian Babylonia,11 most Babylonian rabbis seem to have supported the "balanced" model attributed to R. Ishmael, which combines talmud torah with worldly occupation.12 Two Babylonian narratives, however, take issue with the "exclusive" model attributed to Rashbi, which demands complete dedication to a life of Torah, whether of Israel as a whole or at least of certain individuals 7. Satlow, "Talmud Torah," 205. 8. The translation of all biblical verses follows the NRSV with minor changes and adjustments. 9. While the verse is intended as a blessing, which follows Israeli obedience to the Lord's com mandments ("and you will gather in"), it was interpreted in certain rabbinic circles as a maxim ("and you shall gather in"). 10. Sifrei Devarim, 'Ekev, pis 42, to Deuteronomy 11:14 (ed. Finkelstein, p. 90); B. Berakhot 35b. 11. While talmud torah was an important ideal in rabbinic Palestine as well, it appears to have culminated in the rabbinic culture of Babylonia. See for instance: Jeffrey Rubenstein, The Culture of the Babylonian Babylonian Talmud (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003), 16-38. 12. See especially B. Berakhot 35b. 277</page><page sequence="4">YishaiYishai Kiel who are sufficiently sustained.13 The Babylonian narratives—namely, the story of 'Ilfa and R. Yohanan,14 and that of Rashbi's cave15—follow a similar twofold structure, in which the exclusive model is initially pushed to its limits, presenting an unbridgeable opposition between a redemptive life of study and a mundane life of employment that, sooner or later, leads to one's death. This extreme interpret ation of the exclusive model is not found in the tannaitic works and appears to be unique to the Babylonian construal of Rashbi's position. Subsequently, both nar ratives artfully critique the extreme opposition between study and sustenance and offer salvation to those engaged in the pursuit of a livelihood. Similarly to the rabbinic dilemma, the Herbedestan16 inquires whether a priestly student should pursue his priestly studies or engage in the "guardianship of property."17 The text provides two alternative solutions that, by and large, mirror the rabbinic positions of R. Ishmael and Rashbi. While the Avestan and the tannaitic presentations of the dilemma share several elements in common, the Pahlavi and Babylonian versions of the dilemma are more intimately con nected. While the Avesta and the tannaitic works refer to a general notion of studying (Torah or priestly studies) against worldly occupation, the Babylonian narratives and the Pahlavi commentary shift the focus of the dilemma towards the notion of going away to a locus of academic study, which intensifies the con flict between study and domestic obligations.18 13. The nuances of Rashbi's position according to the different tannaitic works will be con sidered below in detail. 14. B. Ta'anit 21a; the story is analyzed in Jeffrey Rubenstein, Stories of the Babylonian Talmud (Baltimore: John Hopkins University Press, 2010), 41-61. Previous studies on this story are referenced on 247 n. 1. 15. B. Shabbat 33b. 16. The Herbedestan is a Young Avestan work that was preserved in part alongside its Pahlavi translation and commentary. A critical edition of the Herbedestan was published by Firoze M. Kotwal and Philip G. Kreyenbroek, The Herbedestan and Nerangestan, vol. 1 (Paris: Association pour l'Avancement des Etudes Iraniennes, 1992). The relevant texts will be analyzed below in detail. 17. For the precise meaning of this term, see below. 18. It makes no difference to my case whether the Babylonian and/or Zoroastrian "academies" refer to an institutionalized setting or merely to a master-student circle. For this long debated issue, see David Goodblatt, "The History of the Babylonian Academies," in The Cambridge History of Judaism, vol. 4, The Late Roman-Rabbinic Period, ed. Steven T. Katz (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), 821-839; Jeffrey Rubenstein, "The Rise of the Babylonian Rabbinic Academy: A Reexamina tion of the Talmudic Evidence," Jewish Studies Internet Journal 1 (2002): 55-68. Isaiah Gafhi has argued for the existence of an institutionalized academy already during the amoraic period; see Isaiah Gafhi, "Yeshivah u-metivta," Zion 43 (1978): 12-37. For further developments of the academy during the geonic period, see Robert Brody, The Geonim of Babylonia and the Shaping of Medieval Medieval Jewish Culture (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998), 35-53.

Both Rashbi and the Manichaean Elect are thus similarly scrutinized, cri ticized, and caricatured for their extreme renunciation of agriculture; for "destroying the world"; and for the denial of salvation to those who engage in worldly occupation. Needless to say, neither Rashbi's position in the tannaitic works nor the Manichaean theology ought to be construed in such a manner. It is rather the polemical perspectives of the Babylonian redactors and the Zor oastrian critics that are at stake here. While certain Babylonian and Zoroastrian authorities accepted the precedence of study over sustenance, the talmudic narra tives and the Pahlavi critique of Manichaeism wage war against extreme forms of renunciation, as they attempt to reaffirm worldly engagement as a mitzvah or a kirbagkirbag (a meritorious deed). The extreme version of Rashbi's position in the Babylonian Talmud, akin to the Manichaean perspective according to the Zoroastrian critique, is reflected most vividly in B. Shabbat 33b in the context of the famous narrative about Rashbi's flight from the Romans and his ascetic adventures in a cave. The talmudic narra tives about Rashbi have been previously examined by several scholars and have been thoroughly treated from various historical and literary perspectives.19 The cave story was recently examined by Michal Bar-Asher Siegal and Charlotte Fonrobert, respectively, from a comparative perspective. Bar-Asher Siegal20 viewed the story in the context of a set of monastic traditions21 stemming from trained 'on the road', so to speak, while the Zand may refer to more centralized centers of learning, presumably in Sasanian times."

The comparative study of the Babylonian Talmud has taken three major trajectories over the past decade, associated with three distinct cultural milieus that can contribute to our understanding of the text. One major strand underscores the role of eastern forms of Christianity in shaping the content and structure of the Babylonian Talmud;24 a second strand emphasizes A brother went to see Abba Silvanus on the mountain of Sinai. When he saw the broth ers working hard, he said to the old man, "Do not labor for the food which perishes [but for that meat which endures unto everlasting life] [John 6:27], Mary has chosen the good portion [Luke 10:42]." The old man said to his disciple, "Zacharias, give the brother a book and put him in a cell without anything else." So, when the ninth hour came the visitor watched the door expecting someone would be sent to call him to the meal. When no one called him he got up, went to find the old man and said to him, "Have the brothers not eaten today?" The old man replied that they had. Then he said, "Why did you not call me?" The old man said to him, "Because you are a spiritual man and do not need that kind of food. We, being carnal, want to eat, and that is why we work. But you have chosen the good portion and read the whole day long and you do not want to eat carnal food." When he heard these words the brother made a prostration saying, "Forgive me, Abba." The old man said to him, "Mary needs Martha. It is really thanks to Martha that Mary is praised." It was said of Abba John the Dwarf, that one day he said to his elder brother, "I should like to be free of all care, like the angels who do not work, but ceaselessly offer worship to God." So he took off his cloak and went away into the desert. After a week he came back to his brother. When he knocked on the door, he heard his brother say, before he opened it, "Who are you?" He said, "I am John, your brother." But he replied, "John has become an angel, and henceforth he is no longer among men." Then the other begged him saying, "It is I." However, his brother did not let him in, but left him there in distress until morning. Then, opening the door, he said to him, "You are a man and you must once again work in order to eat." Then John made a prostration before him, saying, "Forgive me." 22.

Without denying the importance of the monastic and Greco-Roman components of the cave story, the religious concerns embedded in this story may also be located in the Zoroastrian world and its religious polemic against the Manichaean Elect. Cultural and religious expressions are rarely, if ever, produced in complete cultural isolation. Even "internally-oriented" communities are penetrable, whether consciously or subconsciously, by the surrounding cultures, and the case of Jewish Babylonia is no different. It has been demonstrated, moreover, by Yaakov Elman that the elite rabbinic culture of Sasanian Babylonia was particularly susceptible to acculturation.27 This does not necessitate, of course, the envisioning of a process of direct "influence," in which the rabbis are said to acquire doctrines, practices, or motifs directly from other cultures.28 When general cultural categories are at and Rabbis on Noah's Righteousness in Light of the Jewish-Christian Polemic," in The Book of Genesis in in Jewish and Oriental Christian Interpretation, ed.

Thus, for instance, Michel Foucault's oft-quoted formulation of "genealogy" inverts the model of direct influence, seeking instead multiple determining elements and a complex of relations 281</page><page sequence="8">YishaiYishai Kiel stake—such as the basic dilemma of spirituality versus livelihood—it is all the more difficult to discern particular channels of cultural impact. However, whether or not actual "borrowing" took place, the contextualization of the rabbinic conflict over the value of asceticism within contemporaneous religious formations significantly illuminates our understanding of the dilemma and its proposed sol utions. Rather than speculating about possible channels of "influence," therefore, the general "fuzziness" of boundaries between rabbinic Judaism and adjacent reli gious cultures should be acknowledged, along with the vibrant and complex set of cultural relationships which this description entails.29 The Rabbinic Conflict The theological and practical tension that exists between the ideal of cease less study of Torah and agricultural occupation is famously formulated in Sifrei Devarim as an exegetical juxtaposition of two contradicting verses. ואספת למי נא' לפי שני לא ימוש וגו' שומע אני כמשמעו תל' לרמי ואספת וגו' דרך ארץ דיברה תורה דב' ר' יש' ר' שמע' בן יוחי או' אין לדבר סוף קוצר בשעת קציר חורש בשעת חריש דש בשי שרב זורה בשעת הרוח אימתי אדם לומד תורה אלא כש יש' עושין רצון המקום מל(כ)[א]כתן נעשה על ידי אחירין שני ועמדו זרים ורעו צאנכם וגו' וכשאינו עושי רצי המק' מלאכתן נעש' על ידי עצמן ולא עוד אלא שמלאכת אחירין נעשת על ידן שני ועבדת את איביך וגו'.30 "And thou shall gather in [your grain, your wine, and your oil]" [Deuteron omy 11:14], Why is this written? Since it says "[This book of the Torah] shall not depart [out of your mouth; you shall meditate on it day and night]" [Joshua 1:8], I might think that this injunction is to be taken literally. Therefore it says, "And thou shall gather in"—the Torah [itself] speaks of worldly occupation. This is the view of R. Ishmael. R. Shimon ben Yohai says: There is no end to it; [if a person] reaps in the reaping season, ploughs in the ploughing season, threshes in the season of heat, and for any given phenomenon. See Michel Foucault, "Nietzsche, Genealogy, History," in Language, Counter-Memory,Counter-Memory, Practice: Selected Essays and Interviews, ed. Donald F. Bouchard, trans. Donald F.

Similarly, one may argue that by "influence" we need not assume "borrowing" of novel elements that weren't present before. "Influence" may refer to general stimuli that bring into pro minence features that have been present previously but were less important. On this point, see M. Smith, "II Isaiah and the Persians," Journal of the American Oriental Society 83 (1963): 415 421.

Thus, when Israel performs the will of the Omnipresent, their work is performed by others, as it says "And strangers will stand and feed your flocks." But when Israel does not perform the will of the Omnipresent their work is carried out by themselves, nor is this all, but the work of others too is done by them, as it says "And you will labor for your enemy." Sifrei Devarim proposes two alternative solutions for this religious dilemma, which are respectively attributed to R. Ishmael and Rashbi. According to R. Ishmael, both the exegetical and practical conflicts can be resolved by promoting a balanced lifestyle that combines agriculture and spiritual pursuits. Scripture does not mean that one should not cease from the study of Torah in the literal sense, but rather that one should study the Torah to the best of his ability whilst sustaining his basic worldly needs by pursuing an agricultural occupation. Rashbi, on the other hand, advocates a more extreme lifestyle that is purely dedicated to the study of the Torah. As long as the people of Israel perform the will of God (by studying the Torah and obeying the commandments) their material needs will be sustained by others. If they do not perform the will of God, however, they will not only sustain their own material needs but will be forced to sustain the needs of others.31 R. Ishmael offers not only a hermeneutic solution to the contradiction between the two verses, but also a practical lifestyle that neutralizes the theological conflict. Rashbi, on the other hand, solves only the hermeneutic contradiction between the verses, as he interprets the pursuit of agricultural occupation as the unfortunate con sequence of disobeying the will of God and not as a positive injunction. On the other hand, the solution that he offers is not very practical, to say the least. Is one expected to refrain from agricultural occupation and simply hope that he will be sustained by others or by God? Perhaps Rashbi's position can be better understood in light of another tannaitic statement attributed to him in the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael. מיכן היה ר' שמעון בן יוחי או' לא נתנה תורה לדרוש אלא לאוכלי המן הא כיצד היה יושב ודורש ולא היה יודע מהיכן הוא אוכל ושותה מ(י)היכן הוא לובש ומתכסה הא לא נתנה תורה לדרוש אל' לאוכלי המן ושניים להן לאוכלי תרומה.32תרומה.32 From here R. Shimon ben Yohai said: The Torah was only given to be expounded by those who eat manna. How is this so? A man is sitting and expounding and does not know wherefrom he will eat and drink, wherefrom he will clothe and cover himself, thus the Torah was only given to be expounded by those who eat manna and, second to them, those who eat terumah. 3 31. For Rashbi's position, see also Sifrei Devarim, 'Ekev, pis. 40, to Deuteronomy 11:12 (ed. Finkelstein, pp. 83-84); Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, Masekhta de-Shabbeta I, to Exodus 35:2 (ed. Horovitz-Rabin, pp. 342-343). 32. Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, Masekhta De-va-yis'a 3, to Exodus 16:4, according to MS Oxford (cf. ed. Horovitz-Rabin, p. 161). 33. For the role of terumah in this context, cf. Y. Shevi'it 9:1 (38d); B. Shabbat 33b; Bar-Asher Siegal, "Literary Analogies," 157-158 n. 20. 283</page><page sequence="10">YishaiYishai Kiel The Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael suggests that the extreme lifestyle of ceaseless study advocated by Rashbi only applies to people who are miraculously sustained, such as the consumers of the manna in the desert, or to priests who can live off the priestly gifts. This does not apply to an average person who must necessarily sustain himself by pursuing an agricultural occupation. Although it is possible to interpret Sifrei Devarim in light of the Mekhilta passage, which suggests that only very few individuals are actually required to maintain a life of ceaseless study, this is not the only possible interpretation. It is equally possible that Rashbi's position according to the Sifrei Devarim is much more extreme than that attributed to him in the Mekhilta. While the Mekhilta acknowledges the fact that the vast majority of people cannot lead a life of pure dedication to the study of Torah, the Sifrei Devarim may not share this mitigating stance, as it appears to demand ceaseless study from Israel as a whole.34 One way or another, what appears to be common to the tannaitic formulations of Rashbi's pos ition is the notion that those who maintain a life dedicated to study (whether demanded of Israel as a whole or only of certain individuals) are, or ought to be, sustained by others (whether by the labor of other nations, a heavenly miracle, or by the priestly gifts). A related tannaitic dispute preserved in M. Kiddushin 4:14 and T. Kiddushin 5:15-16 concerns the question of teaching a profession as part of the education process. While certain authorities hold that one should teach his son a profession, others maintain that one should teach him only the Torah.35 The latter stipulate that Torah confers not only reward in the world to come, but in fact sustains one's needs in this world.36 One should thus immerse himself in the study of Torah and not worry about worldly occupation. These positions seem to mirror the pos itions attributed to R. Ishmael and Rashbi in Sifrei Devarim. It seems, however, that the dispute between R. Ishmael and Rashbi is emble matic of a much broader discrepancy that is evident between different rabbinic texts. While some sources bespeak the importance of agriculture and a livelihood, others imply that a life of Torah requires complete dedication, poverty, and 34. The different versions of Rashbi's position in this regard are discussed in Rubenstein, TalmudicTalmudic Stories, 342-343 n. 81; and cf. Moshe Beer, "Torah ve-derekh'erez," Bar-Ilan Annual 2 (1964), 134-162. To further complicate the matter, the Babylonian Talmud preserves a completely con tradictory tradition (B. Menahot 99b; B. Nedarim 49b) that attributes to Rashbi the seemingly "Ishmae lite" idea that the recitation of the Shema suffices to fulfill the obligation of "the Torah shall not depart out of your mouth" (Joshua 1:8), and the idea that worldly occupation brings honor to its performer. Bar-Asher Siegal, "Literary Analogies," 161-162 n. 28, suggests that the extreme and moderate interpretations of Rashbi's position in the Sifrei and the Mekhilta reflect the differences between the Ishmaelite and Akivan schools. While I agree with her that Rashbi's position is not monolithic in the tannaitic works, I believe that the classical division between the Ishmaelite and Akivan schools is not applicable in this case, since unlike the Mekhilta passage that was quoted, Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, Masekhta de-Shabbeta 1, to Exodus 35:2 (ed. Horovitz-Rabin, pp. 342-343) expresses an anonymous position that is akin to the more extreme interpretation of Rashbi's position displayed in Sifrei Devarim, 'Ekev, pis. 42, to Deuteronomy 11:14 (ed. Finkelstein, p. 90). 35. M. Kiddushin 4:14; T. Kiddushin 5:15-16; B. Kiddushin 82b. 36.

Be that as it may, the talmudic discussion in B. Berakhot 35b, which immediately follows the dispute between R. Ishmael and Rashbi, explicitly engages the balanced model of R. Ishmael and rejects Rashbi's exclusive model. In response to the tannaitic dispute, several amoraic authorities introduce a nuance of R. Ishmael's position, which combines the study of Torah with agricul tural occupation. א' אב״ הוו רבני דעבדי כר' ישמע' ואיקיים בידייהו תלמודייהו ואיל רבנן דעבדי כרי שמעי בן יוחי ולא איקיים תלמודייהו בידייהו א' להו רבא לרבנן במטותא מינייכו לא תיתחזו קמאי לא ביומי ניסן ולא ביומי תשרי כי היכי דלא ליטרדו במזונייכו כולי שתא א' רבה בר חנה א' ר' יוחנן משום ר' יהודה בר' אילעאי בוא וראה שלא כבדורות ראשונים דורות אחרונים דורות ראשוני עושין תורתן קבע ומלאכתן עראי זה וזה נתקיימו בידם דורות האחרונים עושין תורתן (קבע) עראי ומלאכתן [קבע] וזה וזה לא נתקיימו בידם.38 Abaye said: There were rabbis who followed the advice of R. Ishmael and their study lasted in their hands; but there are others who have followed R. Shimon ben Yohai and their study did not last in their hands. Rava said to the rabbis: I beg you not to appear before me during the days of Nisan and Tishrei, so that you may not be anxious about your food supply during the rest of the year. Rabbah b. Hannah said in the name of R. Yohanan, report ing in the name of R. Yehudah b. 'Ila'i: Come and see what difference there is between the earlier and the later generations. The earlier generations made the study of Torah their main occupation and their ordinary work subsidiary to it, and both lasted in their hands. The later generations made their ordinary work their main occupation and their study of the Torah subsidiary, and neither lasted in their hands.39 37. The talmudic sources that stress the importance of agriculture and worldly engagement include M. Avot 1:11; B. Berakhot 8a; B. Nedarim49b; B. Niddah 70a. For the arrangement of Issachar and Zevulun, see Bereshit Rabbah, Va-yeze, par. 72:5, to Genesis 30:16 (ed. Theodor-Albeck, 841 843); Va-yehi, par. 97:9, to Genesis 49:13 (ed. Theodor-Albeck, 1220); Va-yehi, par. 99, to Genesis 49:13 (ed. Theodor-Albeck, 1281); Vayikra Rabbah, Kedoshim, par 25:2, to Leviticus 19:23 (ed. Mar goliot, 570-571); B. Sotah 21a. For a much more ascetic perspective, see for instance: M. Avot 6:4-5; B. 'Eruvin 55a. Some versions of the rabbinic narrative about R. Eliezer's youth relate that Eliezer abandoned the agricultural work of his father's field in favor of Torah, thus disclosing an uncompromis ing tension between Torah study and agricultural occupation. Beyond the abandonment of agriculture in favor of Torah, other ascetic features pertaining to the study of Torah are also displayed in this story, as R. Eliezer is said to have abstained from food for many days in the course of his pursuit of Torah. For the different versions of this narrative, see Bereshit Rabbah, Lekh Lekha, par. 41:1, to Genesis 14:1 (ed. Theodor-Albeck, 397-398); Tanhuma, Lekh Lekha, par. 10, to Genesis 14:1 (ed. Buber, 67-69); Avot de-Rabbi Natan A:6 (ed. Schechter, pp. 30-31) B:13 (ed. Schechter, pp. 30-31); Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 1 (ed. Horowitz, 20). See also Diamond, Holy Men, 23-33. 38. B.

Ishmael's balanced model, and the former even asserts the impracticality of Rashbi's position, as "there are rabbis who have followed R. Shimon ben Yohai and their study did not last in their hands." Even the third position attributed to Rabbah b. Hannah in the name of R. Yohanan, who reported in the name of R. Yehudah b. lla'i, does not seem to differ fundamentally. The idea that Torah should be the main occupation while ordinary work remains subsidiary seems to be precisely what R. Ishmael (or the Sifrei) had in mind when he exclaimed that Torah should be accompanied by worldly occupation. In addition, there are two Babylonian narratives (B. Ta'anit 21a and B. Shabbat 33b) that subversively reduce the exclusive position of Rashbi ad absur dumdum by portraying the tension between study and sustenance in terms of the oppo sition between redemptive life, on the one hand, and death on the other. This extreme portrayal of Rashbi's position in the Babylonian narratives and the critical stance taken by Abaye and the redactors of the narratives towards the exclusive model are absent from the tannaitic works and thus seem to be characteristic of a Babylonian mindset. B. Ta'anit 21a recounts the story of two sages, 'Ilfa and R. Yohanan, who decide to quit their studies in order to make a living. Sitting near an unsound wall, R. Yohanan hears an angel proposing to kill the two rabbis because "they forsake eternal life and busy themselves with temporal life" (מניחים חיי עולם 40,(ועוסקים בחיי שעה while another angel responds that one of the sages has a great future ahead of him. Upon this revelation, R. Yohanan resolves to return to his studies and eventually attains a position of leadership in the academy. 'Ilfa is informed that had he remained in the academy and studied he would have attained an even higher status. Subsequently, 'Ufa proposes a most dramatic challenge to prove his mastery of Torah, as he suspends himself from a sailyard of a ship and promises to fall into the river if he cannot solve every legal question presented to him. The story of 'Ilfa and R. Yohanan was recently examined by Jeffrey Ruben stein in his Stories of the Babylonian Talmud.41 Rubenstein aptly observes that the first half of the story delineates two possible paths. The angel's assertion that "they forsake eternal life and busy themselves with temporal life" presents a very clear dichotomy between a life of Torah and a life of worldly occupation. The second convinced, however, that R. YehudahTs position in B. Berakhot 35b is closer to Rashbi's position than to R. Ishmael's position in the Sifrei. The notion that one's occupation should be only secondary to his study of Torah does not necessarily contradict the opinion of R. Ishmael regarding the necessity of worldly occupation (see also M. Avot 4:10). R. Ishmael would probably have agreed to a formulation, according to which worldly occupations are subsidiary to the main pursuit of Torah. 40. This expression is absent from the Palestinian Talmud, but appears four times in the Babylonian Talmud (B. Ta'anit 21a, B. Shabbat 33b; B. Shabbat 10a, B. Bezah 15b), see: Rubenstein, TalmudicTalmudic Stories, 131-133. For monastic parallels, see Bar-Asher Siegal, "Literary Analogies," 186-187 (Sayings of the Desert Fathers, Silvanus 4, in: ed.

Previous studies on this story are referenced on 247 n. 1. 286</page><page sequence="13">Study versus Sustenance half of the story, however, conveys the message that despite ,Ufa's dedication to supporting himself he has by no means "forsaken eternal life," but in fact excelled in Torah as well. This ending collapses the oppositions set forth in the first half of the story and suggests that Torah and a livelihood can go together.42 The exclusive position attributed here to R. Yohanan is akin, no doubt, to Rashbi's position according to the tannaitic sources. In fact, elsewhere, the Babylonian Talmud relates that R. Yohanan was indeed sustained by others in pursuit of his studies.43 Be that as it may, the extreme opposition between study and sustenance in the first half of the story, in which the pursuit of a worldly occupation nearly leads to the sages' death, is unparalleled in the tannaitic presentation of the exclu sive model. The redactors of this narrative seem to have consciously rejected the exclusive model, by implying that 'Ilfa has done both and succeeded 44 Rashbi's position is revisited by the Babylonian redactors in B. Shabbat 33b in the context of his flight from the Romans and ascetic adventure in the cave 45 Jeffrey Rubenstein convincingly observes that Rashbi's retreat from the world occurs in the narrative in two consecutive stages 46 First, Rashbi withdraws to the academy and leads a life of partial asceticism, while later on in the story he completely withdraws to an isolated life in the cave. In the academy he eats hand made bread and drinks water brought to him by his wife, he wears handmade clothes, and enjoys the companionship of his fellow scholars. In the cave, on the other hand, he is sustained by natural food (carobs and spring water), he is completely naked, and studies Torah in isolation (or only with his son). Likewise, when Rashbi eventually emerges from the cave and reenters society, he does it in two consecutive stages, first after twelve years of isolation and then once again after another year in the cave. נפקו חאזו אינשי דקא כרבי וזרעי אמי מניחין חיי עולם ועוסקין חיי שעה כל מקום שנתנו עיניהם נשרף יצתה בת קול ואמרה להן להחריב עולמי יצאתם חזרו למערתכם הדור ואזול ואיתיבו תריסר ירחי שתא במערתא אמרי משפט רשעים בגיהינם שנים עשר חדש יצתה בת קול ואמרה להם צאו ממערתכם נפקו כל היכא דהוה מחי ר' אלעזר הוה מסי ר' שמעון אמי לו בני דיו לעולם אני ואתה חאזו לההוא סבא דהוה נקיט בידיה תרי מדאני דאסא אמרו ליה הני למה לך אמי להו לכבוד שבת אמרו ליה ותסגי לך בחד אמי להו חד כנגד זכור וחד כנגד שמור אמר ליה לבריה חזית כמה חביבה מצוה עלייהו דישראל.47 42.

Seeing people ploughing and sowing, they exclaimed, "They forsake eternal life and engage in temporal life!" Whatever they cast their eyes upon was immediately burnt up. Thereupon a heavenly voice came forth and cried out, "Have you emerged to destroy my world? Return to your cave!" So they returned and dwelt there for twelve months, saying, "The punishment of the wicked in Gehenna is (limited to) twelve months." A heavenly voice then came forth and said, "Go forth from your cave!" They came out. Wherever R. Eleazar wounded, R. Shimon healed. He said to him, "My son! You and I are sufficient for the world." They saw an old man holding two bundles of myrtle. They said to him: "What are these for?" He said, "They are in honor of the Sabbath." They said: "But one should suffice you?" He said: "One is for 'Remember [the Sabbath day]' [Exodus 20:8] and one for 'Observe [the Sabbath day]' [Deuteronomy 5:12], He said to his son, "See how precious a commandment is to Israel." Ofra Meir observes that Rashbi's position displayed in this narrative is compatible with the position attributed to him in the tannaitic works, according to which ded ication to Torah must entail complete renunciation from worldly occupation.4 Bar-Asher Siegal has further suggested that the change of mind that Rashbi experi ences between his first and second emergence from the cave reflects the differ ences between the Sifrei and the Mekhilta. When he first comes out of the cave, Rashbi expects everyone to study the Torah constantly, while criticizing others who pursue agricultural work. This approach seems to follow the position attrib uted to Rashbi in the Sifrei, according to which as long as the Israelites fulfill the will of God, their needs will be taken care of. Upon his reemergence, however, Rashbi says to his son "You and I are sufficient for the world," which indicates his understanding that not all people can lead this extreme way of life. This new realization echoes Rashbi's position in the Mekhilta, according to which only those who are miraculously sustained or those who are sustained by others can devote their entire lives to the study of Torah.49 It seems to me, however, that the Babylonian narrative represents a signifi cant shift from the tannaitic representations of Rashbi's position. In the Babylo nian narrative Rashbi's position is much more extreme than any tannaitic account. In the talmudic story, Rashbi does not merely assert that one ought to engage a life completely devoted to study, but reproaches others who do not follow his ways. In his frustration he burns up everything he casts his eyes upon, thus expressing the idea that everything in the world is worthless besides a life of complete dedication to Torah. Rashbi's position is thus pushed to its limits by the Babylonian redactors, in an attempt to criticize the exclusive model he maintains. The critical stance echoed in the heavenly voice that cries out "have you emerged to destroy my world?" and Rashbi's realization that he deserves to be punished like the wicked in hell, are likewise absent from the tan naitic works. Below, we shall see that this extreme tone towards Rashbi's 48. Meir, "Sipur," 155. 49. Bar-Asher Siegal, "Literary Analogies," 161-162 n. 28. 288</page><page sequence="15">Study versus Sustenance exclusive position is reminiscent of the Zoroastrian depiction and critique of the Manichaean Elect. To be sure, even after Rashbi is sent back to the cave and finally reemerges, it seems that he still doesn't get it. The assertion "You and I are sufficient for the world" is not merely a realization that not everyone is able to maintain his and his son's son's extreme lifestyle for lack of sufficient sustenance or some other contingent reason, but an essential statement concerning the exclusivity and ontological superiority of those who study Torah ceaselessly to all other humans who are engaged in worldly occupation.50 Only upon his meeting with the old man does Rashbi finally realize that alternative paths to God are open to the layperson, via the fulfillment of God's commandments.51 This classification represents a significant shift from the tannaitic portrayal of Rashbi's position in the Mekhilta, which at best acknowledges that there are contingent differences between people who are sustained by the manna or the priestly gifts and can thus pursue a life of complete dedication to Torah and others who are forced to engage in worldly occupation. The tannaitic versions of of Rashbi's position do not convey a sense of a social and ontological dichotomy between those who ceaselessly study the Torah and others who are engaged in worldly pursuits.52 A similar point is made by the Babylonian redactors in the narrative of 'Ufa and R. Yohanan. The narrator initially relates that only one of the two sages is des tined to greatness—a prediction that is realized only through R. Yohanan's choice to dedicate his life to Torah—while the pursuit of a livelihood nearly leads to the death of the two sages. The first part of this narrative can thus be compared to the first part of the cave narrative, in which Rashbi still believes that "You and I are sufficient for the world." The ontological opposition between 'Ufa and R. Yohanan collapses, however, by the end of the story, as the narrator suggests that 'Ilfa too achieved greatness in Torah despite his engagement in commerce. The conclusion of both talmudic narratives, therefore, is that religious merit can be gained even through a life which is not solely dedicated to study. 'Ufa achieves 50. The connection between the exclusivity Rashbi expresses in B. Shabbat 35b and his asser tion that only very few people are worthy of salvation according to B. Sanhedrin 96b and B. Sukkah 45b, will be discussed immediately below. For a somewhat different understanding of Rashbi's state ment, see Bar Asher Siegal, "Literary Analogies," 191. 51. While the encounter with the old man does not necessarily convey a realization on Rashbi's part, of the value of agriculture and worldly occupation, it suggests nevertheless that alternative paths are open to nonscholars via the fulfillment of God's commandments. It must be kept in mind, however, that, from a literary perspective, the encounter with the old man represents an attempt to rectify Rashbi's original critical and harsh stance towards those who plough and sow their fields. Indirectly, then, Rashbi's new realization upon his encounter with the old man seems to bear on his general attitude towards agriculture and worldly occupation as well. It is possible, although by no means certain, that the myrtle signifies this connection. 52. On the "exclusive" approach of the Babylonian rabbis in general, see esp. Richard L. Kalmin, The Sage in Jewish Society of Late Antiquity (London: Routledge, 1999), and compare: Secunda, "Reading the Bavli in Iran," 340-341; Yishai Kiel, "Samkhut hakhamim ba-talmud ha-bavli: hebetim zoroastriyim," Shnaton Ha-mishpat Ha-'ivri 27 (2012-2013): 131-174. 289</page><page sequence="16">YishaiYishai Kiel greatness in Torah despite the fact that he had left the academy in pursuit of worldly occupation, and Rashbi finally realizes, through his encounter with the old man, that religious merit can also be gained by nonscholars who engage in mundane pursuits. The notion that "You and I are sufficient for the world" is connected with another tradition that is attributed to Rashbi in both Talmuds.53 כן הוה ר' שמעון בן יוחי או'. אני ראיתי בני העולם הבא ומעוטי(ה)[מ] הן. אין תלתין איבון אנא וברי מנהון. אין תרין אינון אנא וברי אינון.54 "R. Shimon ben Yohai said: I have seen the people of the world to come, and they are few. If there are three, I and my son should be counted among them. If two, I and my son are they." In sum, the tannaitic dilemma of study versus sustenance is, in some respects, reflective of a fundamental concern that characterizes the ascetic worldview in general. Any system that gives expression to an ascetic ideology, however defined, is bound to address the basic tension that exists between the spiritual pur suits advocated by that particular system and matters of bodily sustenance. For the rabbis, the spiritual pursuit par excellence was the study of Torah, which was occasionally perceived as being at odds with agricultural occupation. Beyond the general ascetic concerns that underlie the rabbinic dilemma, however, there are particular religious concerns embedded in the Babylonian accounts of this dilemma, which differ from the tannaitic representations, and, at the same time, seem to parallel the Zoroastrian approach towards the opposition of study and a livelihood and its critique of the Manichaean Elect. Study versus Sustenance in Zoroastrianism Zoroastrianism is commonly believed to be a nonascetic or even antiascetic religion that affirms the essential goodness of the material creation in general and the human body in particular.55 This conception originates from one of the most 53. Meir, "Sipur," 156. 54. Y. Berakhot 9:2 (13d); B. Sanhedrin 96b; B. Sukkah 45b. The Babylonian version uses the unique term בני עליה (those who ascend). B. Sukkah 45b also attributes the following statement to Rashbi; "I can exempt the whole world from judgment." 55. For the basic non-ascetic and anti-ascetic tendencies in Zoroastrianism, see for instance Robert C. Zaehner, The Dawn and Twilight of Zoroastrianism (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1961), 265-283; S.A.

Sarah Coakley (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), 155-166. Several scholars have noted, however, the existence of mitigated or "soft" ascetic expressions in Pahlavi literature and especially in the andarzandarz literature (wisdom literature in Pahlavi). See for instance Shaul Shaked, "The Pahlavi Andarz Literature," (PhD diss., University of London, 1964), 225-247; Shaked, "Payman: An Iranian Idea in Contact with Greek Thought and Islam," in From Zoroastrian Iran to Islam: Studies in in Religious History and Intercultural Contacts, Collected Studies Series CS505 (Aldershot: Variorum, 1995), 217-240.

Humans are, therefore, enjoined to protect and preserve the good creation of Ahura Mazda from the vicious attack of the evil forces. The promotion of human and animal fertility and agricultural cultivation are perceived, in this context, as essential elements in the battle against evil, from early on in the Iranian tradition. The following traditions con cerning the importance of agriculture, cultivation, and fertility appear in the Young Avestan work, Videvdad.56 O Orderly maker of the world of the living with bones, where thirdly of this earth is there most happiness? Then Ahura Mazda said: Wherever, O Spitama Zarathustra, one sows barley and grass and food-bearing plants most, or when one irrigates dry land, or when one drains waterlogged land.57 For this earth is not happy, which lies long unploughed, which should be ploughed by the plougher, wishing for that boon: to be dwelled upon ... One who cultivates this earth, O Spitama Zarathustra, with the left hand and with the right, with the right hand and the left. He brings gain to it, just like a loving man a loving wife, lying on a spread-out bed. He brings her a son or (some other) benefit.58 When the barley is *laid down the daewas59 sweat.

O Orderly maker of the world of the living with bones, who fifthly satisfies this earth with greatest satisfaction? Then Ahura Mazda said: Wherever, O Spitama Zarathustra, one one cultivates this earth for the Orderly Man, (and) puts (it) in Order 61 The Videvdad reveals an unambiguously positive approach towards agricul ture, while the idea of cultivating the earth unfolds as a religious value in its own right and as the manifestation of fundamental theological principles. In light of this Zoroastrian doctrine, Arthur Voobus has surmised that the ascetic attitudes towards agriculture expressed by various monastic groups in late antiquity "must have appeared as a living insult among the feelings shared by the society."62 While his observation is generally correct, it is important to understand that the Zor oastrian polemic against "noncultivation" was not directed at various forms of refraining from agriculture in favor of other spiritual pursuits, which were found among Christian monks (and among the tannaim), but rather at more essential forms of rejection of agriculture, which emphasize the inherent evil in such pursuits, as advocated by the Manichaeans. In fact, in spite of the prominence of agriculture in Zoroastrianism, certain Zoroastrian authorities—not unlike their Christian and rabbinic contemporaries—advocated the precedence of religious studies (of the Avesta and its traditional commentary, the Zand) over agricultural occupation. In line with the rabbinic texts we have explored, the Zoroastrian sources address a very similar conflict between the study of Avesta and Zand and worldly sustenance. While there were religious authorities who preferred agriculture even when the neglect of one's religious studies was at stake, there were others who believed that the study of Avesta and Zand comprises the highest religious value and ought to be pursued even at the expense of agricultural cultivation. Significantly, although there were sages who were inclined towards one of these religious ideals more than the other, both ends were considered to be righteous and meritorious by all. The following text from the Pahlavi translation and commentary on the Avestan Herbedestan delineates the basic dilemma at hand in terms of a conflict between the pursuit of priestly studies—interpreted by the glossators as going "to the place of the priestly studies" (herbedestan)63—and the "guardianship of 61.

Pahlavi herbedestan (when it doesn't refer to the Avestan work bearing this name) often functions as an abstract noun designating priestly studies, but in other cases it refers to the actual 292</page><page sequence="19">Study versus Sustenance property" (xwastag salarih).64 The presentation of the legal dilemma is followed by several solutions offered by different religious authorities. The basic dilemma is presented in section 3.1; section 3.2 stipulates that "guardianship of property" takes precedence over going to the place of the priestly studies; section 3.3 asserts that it is better to perform priestly studies than to "resolve (take care of) the menstrual month" (dastan mah wizardan),65 a technical Pahlavi term that place where the priestly studies were conducted. The latter seems to be implied in the present case since the act of going away to the herbedestan is emphasized. 64. Pahlavi salarih designates legal guardianship. The notion of family-guardianship (dudag- (dudag salanh)salanh) refers to the guardianship of a father or his successors over a girl, entailing the right to give her away in marriage. The present notion of "guardianship of property" (xwastag salarih) refers to the maintaining of property, often the family's estate. Occasionally, salanh also refers to the guardian ship and protection of ritual fires. While the term does not necessarily denote agricultural activity, in the present context Pahlavi "guardianship of property" glosses the Avestan notion of "keeping the members of the flocks in full number or out of harm," thus suggesting an agricultural context (although there seems to be a shift from the Avestan notion). The different types of salanh (guardianship) are discussed in: Rivayat of Emed son of Asawahist 5; Dadestan TDenlg 58; Rivayat of Adutfarnbay 3. See: Hjerrild, Studies Studies in Zoroastrian Family Law, 19—76; Macuch, "Disseminating the Mazdayasnian Religion," 261-262. 65. In their edition of the Herbedestan (vol. 1, p. 35), Kotwal and Kreyenbroek assume that dastandastan mah wizardan means "observe (the rules for) the monthly cycle," that is, a reference to the seclu sion of a woman during her menses prescribed in Pahlavi Videvdad 16.1-2, according to which a men struating woman is instructed to go to the "place of menstruation" (dastanistan) or the "menstrual hut". See also Yaakov Elman, "Marriage and Marital Property in Rabbinic and Sasanian Law," in Rabbinic Law Law in Its Roman and Near Eastern Context, ed. Catherine Heszer (Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2003), 227. The Zoroastrian laws of menstruation are discussed in Shai Secunda, " 'Dashtana - Ki Derekh NashimNashim LiA Study of the Babylonian Rabbinic Laws of Menstruation in Relation to Corresponding Zoroastrian Texts" (PhD diss., Yeshiva University, 2007), 299—482. There are several problems with this interpretation, however, the most pertinent of which is the fact that a reference to menstrual seclu sion seems to be out of place in the context of a discussion concerning the conflict between "guardian ship of property" and "priestly studies." I have recently examined, together with Prods Oktor Skjservo, the different occurrences of this term in Pahlavi literature and we have concluded that it more likely refers to the marital obligation of a husband to sustain and nourish his wife, especially during the men strual cycle at which time she is unable to provide for her own needs. Thus, for instance, Pahlavi Videv dad dad 3.33 discusses the inability to perform religious and ritual activities, including the "resolving of the menstrual month," without proper nourishment of the body (translation by Prods Oktor Skjasrvo and myself): Then they recite this Avestan text [that is, they do their priestly studies better]: For nobody without nourishment is capable [If he does not eat - then he is not capable]. Whoever is not victorious in the acts of righteousness [If (he performed) a very good dwazdah-homastdwazdah-homast (the twelve days hdm ritual), if he does not eat - then he is not capable]. Whoever is not enduring in the act of performance [agriculture], whoever is not enduring in the act of "seeking sons" [fertility] [who is very able to take care of the menstrual month [dastan mah wizardan], if he does not eat—he is not capable]. For the entire bony existence lives from eating [until the end of the determined time]; they would die from not eating [Abarg said: this means, when he dies—he is a non-eater]. For a thorough examination of this passage, see Kiel, "'Al Ta'anit," 20-23. For other occurrences of this term, see for instance Denkard 8.20.95, 8.23.20, 8.36.12; Rivayat of Adutfarnbay 12. 293</page><page sequence="20">YishaiYishai Kiel refers to the marital obligation of a husband to sustain his wife during her men strual period (and it follows, therefore, that priestly studies are also more important than the "guardianship of property"); section 3.4 suggests that the "resolving of the menstrual month" is more important than the "guardianship of property."

The Pahlavi glossators interpret this dilemma in terms of a conflict between going to the priestly academy (herbede stan)stan) and maintaining the property {xwastag salarih). The Zoroastrian dilemma is thus construed in a way similar to the rabbinic dilemma of study versus suste nance. Not unlike the rabbinic dispute, the Zand juxtaposes the positions of several religious authorities and does not attempt to provide a unified or harmonized answer. The rabbinic presentation of the dispute between R. Ishmael and Rashbi is thus quite similar to the reconstructed dispute in the Herbedestan. Both rabbis and dastwars, furthermore, link the ideals of study and sustenance to scriptural verses stemming from the Bible and the Avesta, respectively. The Pahlavi construal of this dilemma is, in fact, particularly akin to the Babylonian version of the rabbinic dilemma. While the tannaim address an abstracted notion of study, the Babylonian narratives introduce into the discussion a more formal locus of study. The dilemma of ,Ilfa and R. Yohanan is not merely whether they should pursue learning or livelihood but rather whether they should remain in the "academy" or not. Likewise, in the Babylonian version of the cave story, Rashbi initially withdraws from the world to the rabbinic "academy." While the notion of the "academy" in itself does not seem to be a significant factor in the talmudic and Zoroastrian presentations of the dilemma, the emphasis on going going away to a designated locus of study underscores and intensifies the already existing conflict between study and sustenance. If one must travel away from his home to pursue religious studies he is all the more prevented from attend ing to his domestic obligations. A similar shift is thus evident from the Avesta to the commentary of the Zand and from tannaitic literature to the Babylonian narra tives. In both cases a more abstracted dilemma was replaced by a focus on a desig nated place of study (the Zoroastrian herbedestan and the Babylonian yeshivah), an element which intensifies the conflict between study and sustenance.69 While scholars have recently situated the Babylonian academy in the context of the development of the Christian schools of Edessa-Nisibis and Ctesi phon,70 they have largely ignored the similarities between the Babylonian 68.

Kotwal and Kreyenbroek, vol. 1, 32-35. 69. To be sure, it makes no difference to my case whether the rabbinic and/or the Zoroastrian learning settings in the Sasanian period consisted of a full-blown academy or merely of a master disciple circle. 70. For the development of the Babylonian academy during the Sasanian period and its connec tions with the Christian schools, see Goodblatt, "History of the Babylonian Academies," 821-839; Rubenstein, "Rise of the Babylonian Rabbinic Academy," 55-68; Rubenstein, Culture of the Babylo nian Talmud, 16-38; Gafni, "Hiburim," 567-576; Becker, Fear of God, 62-97; Becker, 295</page><page sequence="22">YishaiYishai Kiel academy and the Zoroastrian herbedestan. It is thus noteworthy that unlike earlier manifestations of the present dilemma, in the Babylonian Talmud and the Zand the notion of going away to a locus of study plays a prominent role, as it is perceived as an integral part of the "Sasanian" experience of pursuit of religious studies. The image of the scholar who travels from city to city in pursuit of religious studies is well documented in the Babylonian Talmud, as evident for instance in the following observation made by Rav Yosef: "Those are the students of the sages who carry their legs from town to town and from country to country to give and take [=discuss] concerning the words of God."71 The emergence and intensification of the conflict between study and various domestic obligations in Babylonia should thus be seen in this light.72 The differences between the Pales tinian and Babylonian customs in this respect have been previously noted by several scholars: unlike their Palestinian contemporaries who generally tended to postpone the age of marriage so that they can study without disturbance, the Babylonian rabbis typically married at an early age and eventually left their homes for long durations in pursuit of religious study.73 The distinct conflict that emerged in Babylonia between study and sustenance (as well as the conflict that emerged between study and marital relations)74 should be understood in the broader context of Sasanian culture, in which Zoroastrian authorities confronted a similar dilemma regarding scholars who had to leave their homes for long periods of time in pursuit of religious studies. The rabbinic (and monastic) dilemma concerning study as opposed to sus tenance was thus hardly alien to the mindset of certain Zoroastrian authorities, who would have been quite comfortable with the decision of certain individuals to pursue their priestly studies at the expense of agriculture, sustenance, and other domestic obligations. The conflict that emerges between religious learning and concern for a livelihood is not an essential conflict between ontologically opposing ideals, but rather a matter of religious precedence.75 Even those who argue that religious studies should be pursued at the expense of agriculture (Rashbi in the tannaitic sources and the position represented in Herbedestan 3.3-4) do not maintain an essentially negative perception of agricultural labor.

Thus, for instance, already in Bereshit Rabbah, R. Eliezer is said to have left his home for a prolonged stay at the academy (see above). 73. See especially Boyarin, Carnal Israel, 134-166; Michael L. Satlow, Jewish Marriage in Antiquity Antiquity (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996), 30-38; Diamond, Holy Men and Hunger Artists, 128-130. 74. Boyarin, Carnal Israel, 134—166. 75. This is particularly true for Zoroastrianism, where agriculture is a religious value in its own right, but also for rabbinic culture. R. Ishmael, for instance, regards agricultural pursuits as the fulfill ment of a biblical verse. 296</page><page sequence="23">Study versus Sustenance They simply hold that in light of a contradiction between the two pursuits, study prevails. In fact, the monk who approaches Abba Silvanus on the mountain of Sinai, or Abba John the Dwarf—mentioned in the Apophthegmata Patrum— also does not uphold an ontologically negative perception of agriculture; he simply believes that agriculture might stand in the way of higher religious aspirations. That said, in the Babylonian narratives, the redactors confront a much more extreme rejection of agriculture that is projected back onto the figure of Rashbi. True, in these narratives too, the perceived problem with agriculture is that those who engage in it neglect the perpetual study of Torah. However, unlike the tannaitic accounts, the Babylonian narratives address the extreme proposition that those who engage in worldly pursuits "forsake eternal life" and are in some way or another worthy of death. Upon their emergence, Rashbi and his son burn up everything they see, while the angels nearly kill R. Yohanan and 'Ilfa for their ill-advised decision to engage in commerce. While the Babylonian redac tors reject this position altogether, it is significant that such an extreme perception of agriculture is confronted only in the Babylonian tradition. Indeed, the talmudic rejection of the extreme position that denies the value of engaging in worldly occu pation invokes another aspect of the Zoroastrian discourse, which was formulated in the course of its polemical encounter with Manichaeism. Manichaeism and Worldly Occupation In The Manichaean Body in Discipline and Ritual, Jason Beduhn artfully demonstrates that Manichaeism cannot be construed only on the basis of its theol ogy or what he terms "the gnostic interpretation of the religion." Rather, he asserts, attention must be shifted to the actual embodiment of Manichaean theology in everyday ritual and practice.76 It is, therefore, a combination of practice and gnosis that constitutes Manichaeism. The most basic structural characteristic of Manichaeism, which unified the many disparate communities that identified with Manichaeism from the Roman Empire to China, is its division into two subcommunities or classes of adherents. Sources from every region in which Manichaeism was found, both internal normative and external-polemical, attest to this basic religious division. On the one hand there were the "Elect,"77 and on the other hand there were the "Audi tors"78 or "Hearers".79 The fundamental structural division into Elect and Auditors was reflected in two distinct regimens of discipline and norms. One of the most important norms for the Elect, which was upheld to a much lesser degree by the Auditors, was the 76. Jason D.

In several confessional texts we find the following utterances typical of the Elect's regimen: Non-injury Non-injury Precept [pw 'zrmy'h cxs'p$\... But I torment and injure at all times the five elements [mrd 'sp[nd]t\, the fettered light, which is in the dry and wet earth.

The Manichaean avoidance of agriculture and other worldly occupations in the name of the principle of noninjury and especially the division of two distinct regimens of discipline for the Elect and the Auditors were often put to scrutiny by Christian, Muslim, and Zoroastrian critics.83 Thus, for instance, Augustine writes concerning the Manichaean doctrine; 80. This confessional Sogdian text, parts of which are in Middle Persian, is preserved in MS. M 801.475-532. Translation follows Beduhn, Manichaean Body, 43. 81. Beduhn, Manichaean Body, 44. 82. MS.

The anti-Manichaean polemical treatises include the work of Augustine of Hippo (late fourth and early fifth century), the Panarion of Epiphanius of Salamis (fourth century), the Catecheses of Cyril of Jerusalem (fourth century), the Acta Archelai of the otherwise unknown Hegemonius (early 298</page><page sequence="25">Study versus Sustenance For they are convinced that plants and trees possess sentient life and can feel pain when injured, and therefore that no one can pull or pluck them without torturing them. Therefore, they consider it wrong to clear a field even of thorns. Hence, in their madness they make agriculture, the most innocent of occupations,occupations, guilty of multiple murders. On the other hand, they believe that these crimes are forgiven their auditors because the latter offer food of this sort to their elect in order that the divine substance, on being purged in their stomachs, may obtain pardon for those through whose offering it is given to be purged. And so the Elect themselves perform no labors in the field, pluck no fruit, pick not even a leaf, but expect all these things to be brought for their use by their Auditors.84 The first point that Augustine makes is that agriculture is a neutral occupation and should by no means be considered as an act of violence and injury. His second point, however, concerns what he believes to be the double standard of Manichae ism, as "the Elect themselves perform no labors in the field, pluck no fruit, pick not even a leaf, but expect all these things to be brought for their use by their Audi tors." It is thus not only the fact that the Elect condemn agriculture that troubled critics such as Augustine, but also the fact that the Elect have the Auditors do their "dirty work" for them, while they get to avoid the torturous and harmful affliction of the swallowed Light. The Zoroastrian dispute with Manichaeism takes on a unique form in Denkard 3.199-200, which is particularly pertinent in the present context.85 The basic doctrines of Zoroastrianism are presented in this text as a set of ten counsels expounded by the righteous Adurbad, while the doctrines of Manichaeism (or at least their Zoroastrian interpretation) are presented as an opposition to these coun sels voiced by Mani. The accuracy of the Zoroastrian portrayal of the Manichaean doctrines is not as crucial for our purposes as the way Manichaean theology and practice were perceived by the Zoroastrian critics. The Manichaean principle of "noncultivation" is presented as follows: fourth-century), the anti-Manichaean treatises of Titus of Bostra and Serapion of Thmuis (both fourth century), the work of the Middle Platonist Alexander of Lycopolis against the Manichaeans (early fourth century), the works of the Syriac fathers Ephrem (fourth century), Theodore bar Konai (eighth century), and new manuscripts of Serapion of Thmuis and Titus of Bostra, and the Muslim polemic of Al-Nadim in his Fihrist ul-ulum and al-Biruni in his Athar-ul-Bakiya and India. For refer ences, see Beduhn, Manichaean Body, 2-4. To this I might add several Zoroastrian texts in Middle Persian, such as passages from Denkard book 3 and the final chapter of the Skand GumanTg Wizar. The Zoroastrian anti-Manichaean polemic is discussed in Dieter Taillieu, Negende-eeuwse Zoroas trischetrische anti-Manicheische polemieken in Skandgumanig wizar en Denkard (Leuven: Katholieke Uni versiteit, 2004); Taillieu, "Pazand nisami Between Light and Darkness," in Iranica Selecta, ed.

Unlike Augus tine's conviction that agriculture is the most innocent of occupations, in the eyes of the Zoroastrian author of the Denkard, Mani's decree of "noncultivation" destroys "the store of existence and the food consumption and possession of humanity in the world." Only in a religious context where agriculture constitutes a religious merit in its own right is the avoidance of it considered destructive. Indeed, it is this perception of the Manichaean theology of noninjury and avoid ance of agriculture that is mirrored in the talmudic criticism of Rashbi's recon structed position. To be sure, the reasons for the Elect's avoidance of agriculture are funda mentally different from the reasons that are given by rabbinic and monastic texts, as the former seek to uphold the Manichaean principle of noninjury of the swallowed Light while the latter simply attempt to channel all human energies in the direction of spiritual pursuits. Despite these differences, however, a similar structural division of society vis-a-vis the activities of agriculture and gnosis emerge from the Manichaean doctrine and the talmudic understanding of Rashbi's position in the cave story. Both the talmudic reconstruction of Rashbi's position and the Manichaean discipline maintain a similar division of society, in which only the abled Elect (cf. בני עליה) completely refrain from agri cultural occupation and devote their entire time to gnosis, while all the other people are expected to supply their needs. The Sifrei's idea of sustenance by others is reinterpreted in the talmudic cave story through the figure of Rashbi's wife who brings food to the study house, just as the Mekhilta's notion of the manna is transformed in the Babylonian narrative into the miraculous spring and carob tree. Rashbi does not only refrain from agriculture, however, as he com pletely withdraws from all worldly activities and reaches a state of stillness in the cave, akin to Manichaean discipline. To be sure, the argument is not that Rashbi's figure in the talmudic narrative is reflective of the Manichaean doctrine or even of Zoroastrian misconceptions about Manichaeism. Rather, the talmudic discussion of Rashbi's avoidance of agriculture in favor of gnosis may be fruitfully situated in the broader context of adjacent religious traditions. The talmudic concerns surrounding Rashbi's 86.

Thus, when Rashbi first emerges from the cave and burns up everything he sees, he is reproached by a heavenly voice for "destroying the world," just like the Manichaean Elect are criticized for destroying the "store of existence and the food consumption and possession of humanity in the world" in the Zoroastrian account. Secondly, Rashbi says to his son "You and I are sufficient for the world"—trigger ing Rashbi's typical assertion that: "I have seen the people who ascend, and they are few. If there are three, I and my son should be counted among them. If two, I and my son are they"—invoking an exclusive theology that denies religious value to the acts of most people.87 While the Auditors partook, in one form or another, in the Manichaean notion of salvation,88 the Elect were often criticized by outsiders for their "redemptive exclusivity," which denies salvation to the Auditors who do not engage in their ascetic disciplines. The relations between the Elect and the Auditors are thus described by the Zoroastrian critics as abusive and unfair, as they are said to "amass the souls of the demons, which are called Auditors, by greed." Eventually, the Babylonian narrator has Rashbi realize his misconception and acknowledge the significance of worldly occupation, as he ultimately under stands (very much in line with Zoroastrian doctrine) that engagement in agricul tural activity is by no means akin to "forsaking eternal life in favor of temporal life." While his encounter with the old man does not directly confront the issue of agriculture and mundane labor (as it focuses on the value of the command ments), it must be considered that this encounter serves, from a literary perspec tive, to rectify the original encounter of Rashbi with the world, in which he harshly delegitimized the people whom he saw ploughing and sowing their fields for "forsaking eternal life." In the end, Rashbi no longer seems to maintain that "those who ascend are few" or that those who engage in agriculture "forsake eternal life." He finally realizes that there is more than one path leading to God. In sum, supplementing the monastic and Greco-Roman elements that were previously discerned in the cave story, the cave story and its ramifications for the question of study versus sustenance may also be situated within the broader context of the Zoroastrian tradition and its critique of Manichaeism. This examin ation thus demonstrates the indispensability of a contextualized reading of the Babylonian Talmud, which takes into account a wide array of literary sources 87. Alternatively, the statement "You and I are sufficient for the world" may trigger the more moderate notion, according to which the few elect "exempt the whole world from judgment" (also in B. Sukkah 45b). 88, Beduhn, Manichaean Body, 29: "The division into a strictly regimented, "selected" or "righteous," class and a less restricted support class constituted the basis and prerequisite of Mani chaean religious life. Neither pole of the community could obtain salvation without the assistance of the other. This point scarcely need be made with reference to the Auditors; Manichaean literature repeatedly reminded them of their utter dependence on the benevolence of the Elect. On the other hand, some modern scholars have ventured the opinion that only the Elect belonged properly to the Manichaean community, and that the Auditors constituted a clientele upon whom the only injunction was support of the Elect. Such a position is not borne out by the sources, which, as will be shown, clearly articulate a regimen for Auditors." 301</page><page sequence="28">YishaiYishai Kiel and religious traditions that confront issues quite similar to the concerns expressed by the rabbis. Similarly to the rabbinic dilemma, the Herbedestan inquires whether a priestly student should pursue his priestly studies or engage instead in the "guar dianship of property," and provides two alternative solutions that mirror the rab binic stances of R. Ishmael and Rashbi. While the Avestan and tannaitic presentations of this dilemma share several elements in common, the Pahlavi and Babylonian rabbinic versions of the dilemma are more intimately connected. While the Avesta and the tannaitic works refer to a general notion of studying (Torah or priestly studies) against worldly occupation, the Babylonian narratives and the Pahlavi commentary shift the focus of the dilemma towards the notion of going to a locus of academic study, a fact that underscores and intensifies the conflict between scholarship and various domestic obligations. Another important feature shared by the Babylonian narrative and Pahlavi literature concerns the critique of the exclusive model—attributed to Rashbi and the Manichaean Elect, respectively. Both Rashbi and the Manichaean Elect are similarly scrutinized, criticized, and caricatured for their extreme renunciation of agriculture; for "destroying the world"; and for their denial of salvation from those who work in the world and do not devote their lives to gnosis. To be sure, neither Rashbi's position in the tannaitic works nor the Manichaean doctrine ought to be construed in such a manner. It is rather the polemical perspective dis played by the Babylonian redactors of the cave story and the Zoroastrian critique of Manichaeism that are comparable. While certain Babylonian and Zoroastrian authorities accepted the precedence of study over sustenance, the talmudic narra tives and the Pahlavi critique of Manichaeism wage war against the extreme for mulations of the renunciation of worldly occupation, as they attempt to reaffirm practical pursuits as a mitzvah\kirbag (a meritorious deed). It is difficult to determine whether the redactors of the Babylonian narrative were conscious of the Zoroastrian critique of the Manichaean Elect, whether they were aware of it at all, when they crafted their version of the cave story. In light, however, of the existence of comparable patterns of thought concerning learning versus livelihood in the talmudic and Pahlavi literatures, it would seem plausible to deduce that the Babylonian rabbis and Zoroastrian dastwars shared a similar outlook regarding the problem. This, in turn, evoked a similar attempt to scrutinize the exclusive positions of the Manichaean Elect and Rashbi, in order to reaffirm the milder and more balanced worldview they shared.
