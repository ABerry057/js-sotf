The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1979. 189 PP.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 133 According to its cover, this book "offers a lucid and systematic exegesis of Rosenzweig's Star of Redemption," and it is claimed that the value of the work is that it "serves simply as a first orientation, and thereby, at the same time, stimulates more comprehensive and more thorough research." The exegesis certainly is systematic. Ms. Freund's plan for introducing novices to the content of The Star of Redemption (henceforth referred to as The Star) is sound. Rosenzweig's classic in modern Jewish philosophy minimally pre- supposes familiarity with the thought of Schelling, and it is unquestionably desirable to see The Star within the framework of Rosenzweig's earlier and later writings. Hence, Freund precedes her discussion of The Star itself with an outline of Schelling's philosophy and Rosenzweig's other writings. Also, her decision to discuss each part of The Star separately within the frame- work of Rosenzweig's distinctive use of dialectic is sound. Certainly the third part does synthesize the seemingly distinct first two parts even though each of the three parts exhibits a unity of its own. However, at least to me, Ms. Freund's exegesis does not seem to be lucid at all, and because it is not lucid the text does not succeed in either providing the reader with a first orientation or stimulating a desire to learn anything more about Rosen- zweig. Consider the following examples: 1. Remember that this book is intended to introduce readers to The Star. Now, in the original German text it is possible to assume that the reader has some background and interest in modern German philosophy (in which case a survey of Schelling's positive philosophy may not be neces- sary), but that assumption cannot be made in the case of the English transla- tion, since its readers are more likely to be interested in Rosenzweig because he is a major figure in modern Jewish thought and probably have little back- ground or interest in German philosophy as such. In this context, particu- larly if English readers have had some slight exposure to The Star, the opening paragraph of the introduction is mystifying. For example, Rosenzweig deals with the individual's actual existence, that which is termin- ated by death; he speaks of the individual's hic et nunc, of his actions and deci- sions in the realm of concrete reality. This philosophy is not an exposition of theoretical principles. It is not concerned with man in general in abstract time, but rather with the individual human being, designated by a proper name, liv- ing in his particular time. (p. 3) Now readers familiar with German philosophy (who, again, cannot be the intended audience for this English translation) and Rosenzweig's thought can understand the point that Ms. Freund is making, even though the lan-</page><page sequence="3">134 BOOK REVIEWS guage used to make this simple point (viz., that Rosenzweig bases his thought on the life of particular individuals in space and time rather than on an abstract species, man) is unjustifiably complex. But readers who do not have this background and who have already attempted to read The Star will be dismayed. They will note, for example, that while one third of the first part of The Star is about man, the "man" discussed is completely abstract. Furthermore, they will also note that while "man" in the second and third parts does temporal things like pray and eat, the individuals performing these acts are not members of the human species, like John Smith the Chris- tian and Morris Silverman the Jew, but rather are "the Christians" and "the Jews," which seem to be nothing other than lower-order abstractions, viz., subspecies of the species man. Now, against the background of what Hegel did, Rosenzweig's thought is concrete, but against the background of American and British thought (i.e., the background of the intended reader of this book), Freund's introduction appears to be wrong. It is not the kind of statement to begin her explanation; it is a possible claim only as a conclu- sion to a description of the use of categories in modern German philosophy. 2. The passage quoted above contains a footnote that takes an obscure statement in the text and compounds the crime. What is required, minimal- ly, is some kind of explanation (again, given the intended audience) of what kind of individuals Rosenzweig's individuals are (i.e., in what sense and with what justification Rosenzweig can begin his work speaking about indivi- duals who are God, the world [rather than objects], and man [rather than men and women]), but what the note says is the following: Martin Heidegger also turns against the I of idealism in reproaching Descartes for not having analyzed the nature of existence (die Seinweise) of the I am (sum) in his cogito ergo sum. ... Similarly, Martin Buber refers to the abstract and consciously capitalized I as "the shame of the world spirit that has been debased to mere spirituality." (p. 3) Now, you can distinguish between Ich and ich, but what would i be as a word as opposed to I? Clearly in this case the German and not the English ought to be given. But it is not. On the other hand, we are given other foreign words, e.g., sum, that add nothing to the meaning of the note except to exclude readers who only read English, namely, the intended audience for this English translation. This is a minor point, but it is representative of the inconsistency in pedagogy in a book whose raison d'"tre (to follow the</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 135 Freund style) is to introduce Rosenzweig to people who stand outside of his intellectual tradition in German culture and philosophy. More seriously, what do the comments of Heidegger and Buber in this footnote to the very first paragraph of the text have to do with what Freund said? I have some guess about it, but it is only a guess. Furthermore, at this stage of the text there is no reason to assume that the reader knows anything about idealism, let alone "the I of idealism," or why Descartes' "I think; therefore, I am" has a special role to play in analyzing "the nature of existence," or what such an analysis has to do with what Freund says in the body of the text. 3. What is perhaps most disturbing in reading this book is that to a great extent sentences seem to be strung together independently, having little con- nection with each other. Often paragraphing seems to be arbitrary, because each sentence is a distinct paragraph. Consider the following example from the second paragraph of the book: Death discloses the end of creation and hence forecasts its regeneration in revelation. The death of creation demands the love of revelation which is as strong as death and can overcome it. Death also demarcates the boundaries between revelation and redemption, for only the latter signifies the final defeat of death. (p. 4) Now, there is some relationship between these sentences - each says some- thing about death. But each sentence makes an entirely different kind of claim, each of which needs explication for the poor initiate to the thought of Rosenzweig. Why does death disclose the end of creation? What does it mean to "disclose the end of creation"? What does "hence" mean, i.e., how does it follow that because death discloses the end of creation it forecasts its regeneration in revelation? What do creation and revelation have to do with death at all? What is "the death of creation"? Does creation, like people, die, or is the death of creation some special kind of death as opposed to other kinds of death? How can death demand anything? People can make demands; God can make demands; how does death make a demand, and given that it does, why does it demand the "love of revelation"? What has revelation to do with love? Why is love associated with revelation and death with creation? What does it mean to overcome creation? And so forth. Now all of these questions can be answered with considerable exegesis, and all of these statements should be made at some point in the text. (In fact some of them are repeated and discussed in the body of Freund's book.) But these</page><page sequence="5">136 BOOK REVIEWS statements appear in the very first pages of the book by way of introducing students unfamiliar with Rosenzweig and his world of thought to The Star! The examples I have taken are from the beginning of the book, but I could give examples from practically any paragraph any place in the work. It is not the case that what is obscure in the beginning becomes clearer as you read on. On the contrary, with each paragraph and each chapter Rosenzweig appears to be more obscure, and accordingly interest in him declines. The book simply is useless as it now stands to fulfill the function for which it was intended, viz., to be an introduction to the thought of Rosenzweig. I regret this judgment for two reasons: First, there is a need for such a book to be written. Nahum N. Glatzer performed an invaluable con- tribution to the study of modern Jewish thought by acquainting the English- speaking world with the life of Rosenzweig (N. N. Glatzer, Franz Rosen- zweig: His Life and Thought, New York, 1953). Through his writing English- speaking readers discovered the .significance of the man Rosenzweig and became open to learning what that man had to say. Next William Hallo made it possible for English speakers to study Rosenzweig's best thought (F. Rosenzweig, The Star of Redemption, W. Hallo English trans., Boston, 1964). But without considerable background in German culture it is not easy to understand what Rosenzweig says. Now there is great need for some book to open this door for interested students, but, unfortunately, Freund's book is not the right one. Second, the book shows that Ms. Freund has considerable knowledge of what Rosenzweig says. The problem is not what she knows; the problem is how she has presented it and how her presenta- tion was translated into English. Hidden in the depths of this text, dispersed through its pages, are several moments of insight into Rosenzweig's thought that should be of value to those who already are at home in Rosenzweig studies. A notable example of this is her discussion of how Rosenzweig's method of construction differs from Hegel's use of dialectic. According to Freund, to attempt to connect the three parts of The Star as a dialectic in the way that Hegel and Schelling reasoned is a mistake. In their logic the antithesis flows from the thesis, and the synthesis results from the movmement back and forth between the thesis and antithesis. Hence, the first two major steps are mutually dependent on each other. However, in Rosenzweig's method of reasoning, called "construction," the relationship of thesis and antithesis is different. Rather, these are opposites that develop independently and not from each other. Thus, the Course is not a conse- quence of the logic of the Elements; rather the Course is an independent, given starting point, coequal with the Elements (p. 97). Similarly, concern-</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 137 ing Rosenzweig's most general logical terms, viz., "Yea," "Nay," and "And," the Nay does not flow from the Yea; rather they are coequal, pri- mordial logical expressions (p. 105). This is an important point. If Ms. Freund is right, she has isolated an important logical presupposition of Rosenzweig's thought as distinct from Hegel's and Schelling's that is a key to understanding why and how Rosenzweig "secures the same primordiality for Judaism and Christianity. They are no longer to be regarded as having emerged from each other, although they are successive in time" (p. 106). Also of interest are multiple passages in the text where Ms. Freund invokes Hermann Cohen's use of differential equations in calculus to understand what Rosenzweig says about God in parts 2 and 3 of The Star (e.g., pp. 89-90, 105). But these moments of insight are too few to justify the enor- mous effort it takes to read through seemingly endless pages of poorly writ- ten, unclear, and unconnected sentences.
