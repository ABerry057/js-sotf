<plain_text><page sequence="1">282 BOOK REVIEWS Norman A. Stillman. Sephardi Religious Responses to Modernity. Sherman Lecture Series 1. Luxembourg: Harwood Academic Publishers, 1995. xiii, 99 pp. In this short volume, Stillman tackles a controversial theoretical debate that has turned ideological with the flourishing of Sephardic studies in the last three decades. Stillman bravely set himself to answer the question of whether Mediterranean and Oriental Jews, like their Northern European counterparts, played any role in the process of modernization, and if so, how. The debate is grounded in a widespread scholarly view that Oriental Jewish societies have not attained the modernization that typifies their European brethren. This view is sustained by recent sociological data (gathered mostly in the Israeli context) testifying to a strong Sephardic and Oriental Jewish inclination to a more cohesive religious tradition, and placing all Oriental Jewries in the order of tradition as opposed to modernity. In my opinion, this view suffers from two major flaws. First, there is no clear sociological, cultural, and historical definition of modernity. Second, its main support was derived from the absence of scholarly work on Sephardic and Oriental history until about three decades ago. The end result of the debate, in many instances, has been to deny Sephardic and Oriental Jews any status in modem history, and to make them, as Eric Wolf would put it, "a people without history."' Stillman's volume aims to overcome these two flaws, first with his encyclopedic and exhaustive scholarship on Sephardic history,2 secondly with his use of a sociological conceptualization of the process of modernization. The originality of Stillman's methodology is to be found in his focus on the religious dimension of Oriental Jewish modernity. We see how Oriental rabbis, through a sophisticated and secularly learned literature, addressed the question of Jewish modernity in their theological discussions. Stillman uses rabbinical sources written by sages from Morocco, Egypt, Iraq, and Sarajevo, most of whom lived in the nineteenth century and the first decades of the twentieth, and displayed a typical tolerance for the profound changes taking place in Middle Eastern society. Despite some complaints about the decline of traditional religious practice, and the weakening of the patriarchal 1. Eric R.

The theology of Egypt's Rabbi Raphael ben Simeon and Rabbi Elijah Bekhor Hazzan was strongly influenced by their travels through the Mediterranean region and into Europe, and by their knowledge of secular literature in several European languages. Indeed these sages viewed secular education as the foundation of modernization, which they did not oppose. Rabbi Moses Hazzan of Alexandria (d. 1863) reflected about secular education, and especially the matter of foreign language instruction, which he thought was necessary to Jewish children's cultural development. Even a European-centered educational institution like the Alliance Israelite Universelle, according to Stillman, did not encounter vigorous opposition from the rabbis of North Africa and the Middle East. In his authoritative responsa Ben Ish Hayy, the renowned Rabbi Joseph Hayyim of Baghdad (1833-1909) expressed tolerance toward local Jews who desecrated the Sabbath and gave instructions about how to instill respect for the holy day in gentile coffeehouses. Rabbi Hakham Somekh of Baghdad (1813-1889) reflected on the development of new technologies in a response to a question from a Jew in India, and ruled that riding a train on the Sabbath within the city limits was allowed. Finally, Stillman reports on the attitude of Sephardic rabbis to Zionism, a secular nationalist ideology born and developed in Central and Eastern Europe, to which they gave a religiously oriented approach, as in the writings of the Bosnian-bom Rabbi Judah Alkalai. Stillman's last chapter relates this ideological history to the current place of Oriental Jews in Israeli society and politics. Here we find a different vision of the Zionist project and of the Jewish national experience, which is more deeply rooted in the communities' religious traditions. Such an attitude is reflected in the growing political significance of the ever more popular pilgrimages for the veneration of deceased rabbis. Overall, Stillman's project gives the reader a very insightful perspective on Sephardic modernization, one that points to the rabbinical discourse on modernity, in addition to analyzing the actual modernization of Sephardic Jews. As Stillman reminds his readers, but only en passant, modernization reached the Sephardic world by way of Europeanization (p. 13), that is, through the experience of colonialism. I would have enjoyed further reading about how the rabbis related to the colonization of Jews, and to the socio-</page><page sequence="3">284 BOOK REVIEWS economic hierarchy it entailed. Also, the book would have been much richer if it had included some consideration of the modernization of domestic ritual practice, not just in Israel but, for example, in France, Canada, and Latin America. Stillman's volume is overall a necessary reading for any serious student of modern Jewish history. Joalle Bahloul Indiana University Bloomington, Ind.</page></plain_text>
