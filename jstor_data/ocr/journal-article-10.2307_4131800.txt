Notably, much of this scholarship has been in the form of articles. Dafna N. Izraeli, et al, in Sex, Gender, Politics: Women in Israel (Tel Aviv: Hakibbutz Hameuchad, 1999) (Hebrew), provide a comprehensive bibliography in this regard, both for Hebrew and English publications. Sered and Kahn's book- length studies are welcome and necessary contributions to the field. Both anthro- pologists demonstrate, in overlapping yet different ways, the daily and material ways in which Zionist practice and ideology manifest in and through women's bod- ies. Susan Sered's work, as her evocative and declarative title suggests, posits an ostensibly broad thesis. Initially, I anticipated reading a theoretical examination of maternity, modesty and militarism, interpreting Sered's use of "sick" metaphori- cally. Sered's introduction, however, clarifies her intent: "Israeli women are sick- er and die younger then their counterparts in other western countries. Over the past decade the life expectancy of Israeli women has ranked in the vicinity of thirteenth to seventeenth in the world-trailing after Greece and Ireland, whereas the life ex- pectancy of Israeli men has remained among the highest in the world-ranked sec- ond or third, following only Japan and Sweden" (p. 1). Sered then demonstrates how the issues of maternity, modesty, and militarism-issues that feminist schol- ars of Israeli culture have long identified as lynch pins in the construction of Is- raeli gender identity-shape "the cultural politics of somatization" (p.1). Sered's scholarship builds on the earlier work of feminist scholars such as Nira Yuval-Davis, who is credited with the terms "womenandchildren" and "wom- en as bearers of the collective," enlisted in a demographic war. Sered takes Yuval- Davis' terms and the theoretical analysis underpinning them further by interfacing the examination of public policy and Knesset debates, for example, with an ethno- graphic study of birthing mothers and women soldiers. In Chapter One, "Collec- tive Representations of Motherhood," Sered maps out the trajectory by which Is- raeli female citizenship came to be conferred through motherhood. Citing Nitza Berkovitch's illuminating examination of the passage of the Equal Rights Law (1951), Sered delves further into Knesset debates on the issue of "Government Means for Encouraging Natality in the State" (p. 23). One means of encourage- ment was the institution of grants given to birthing mothers. The discussion of birth grants in and of itself is not new among feminist scholars. Sered's discus- sion, however, demonstrates the complex and variegated political motivations ex- pressed in the Knesset debates surrounding this issue. There was considerable political pressure to condition the grant on a hospital birth, thus giving the state- sponsored medical authorities control over the birthing process. Underlying the in- 169</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews sistence on hospital births and medical superiority, presumably for the sake of the health of the mother and child, is a fundamental mistrust in the ability of women and their bodies to "do it right." The state must take over, in essence, because what is at stake are the state's children. The following four chapters flesh out, quite literally, the corporeal compo- nents of Sered's argument: "The Reproductive Body," "The Militarized Body," "The Ritualized Body," and "The Scrutinized Body." The titles foreground the theme that runs through the book: Israeli women's bodies as the nation. In other words, women are objects of the nation, never subjects, and as such, women, by definition, are never ideal citizens. As bearers of the nation, women have the re- sponsibility of producing the next generation but have neither political nor per- sonal power to determine how this could or should be done. As soldiers in the IDF, largely relegated to auxiliary roles with little ability or opportunity to prove them- selves in a military capacity, women soldiers are evaluated predominantly as sym- bols of control and orderliness, called upon to beautify and soften the harsh mili- tary environment. Women have responsibility with little or no authority. Sered's attention to the Israeli women's level of responsibility vis-a-vis their lack of political, social (i.e., membership in decision-making bodies), and personal authority is noteworthy. As Sered notes, psychological research has demonstrated that physical and psychological well-being correlates with social status. "Women soldiers," writes Sered, "neither mothers nor true warriors, are in a problematic liminal state. It seems to me that the intense concern with the neatness and sexu- ality of women soldiers is an expression of that liminality. The 'proper' sexuality of the neat and attractive 'CHEN' [the recently disbanded Women's Corps] soldier signifies that she is on the appropriate path to suitable motherhood within the col- lective" (p. 86). I assigned Sered's book in two recent Jewish/women's studies classes. While most students found the book illuminating, several Jewish studies students argued that Sered's prose suffered from hyperbole, a fact that made it difficult for those students to evaluate her claims on their merit. While the charge of hyperbole may, unfortunately, ring true in some instances, I sense that the students' resistance to Sered's book lies more in the fact that her indictment of the enlistment of women's bodies in the Zionist cause is not easily heard by the mainstream Jewish studies student. The difficulty my students had is demonstrative of the failure of Jewish studies both to incorporate gender as a category of analysis in Jewish and Israel studies and to expose students to feminist analysis. Sered's examination of mater- nity, militarism, and modesty exposes these failures, calling into question as- sumptions generally held by the average Jewish studies student on American uni- versity campuses. Susan Kahn's study on assisted conception is in many ways a continuation of Sered's examination of the meaning of maternity in Israel. Kahn, however, delves deeper into the meaning of Jewish identity vis-a-vis assisted conception. Ever-developing reproductive technologies make it possible, and for some neces- sary, to consider the Jewishness of sperm, womb, and ova. Such determinations and distinctions are important in different ways, as Kahn demonstrates, to Ortho- 170</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews dox and non-Orthodox Israelis. Yet all share an adulterated and enthusiastic em- brace of reproductive technologies. "A word about Israeli pronatalism is crucial here," writes Kahn, "for the overwhelming desire to create Jewish babies deeply informs the Israeli embrace of reproductive technology" (p. 3). If Jewish women, then, are "bearers of the [Jewish] collective," Kahn's book explicates the ways in which assisted conception and its widespread and growing use is an outgrowth of this attitude. The "objective" field of Kahn's research is compelling. Kahn writes that in the mid 1990s, "there were more fertility clinics per capita in Israel than in any other country in the world (twenty-four units for a population of 5.5 million, four times the number per capita in the United States). Moreover, Israeli fertility spe- cialists have emerged as global leaders in the research and development of these technologies.... [A]ll the new reproductive technologies, including artificial in- semination, ovum donation, and in-vitro fertilization, are subsidized by Israeli na- tional health insurance" (p. 2). In Chapter One, entitled "The Time Arrived and the Father Didn't: A New Continuum of Israeli Conception," Kahn enumerates eight stages of assisted con- ception, from choosing to use assisted conception, through entering a relationship with a fertility clinic and choosing sperm, to post-natal concerns of "narrating" the absence of a father. This chapter addresses the use of artificial insemination among non-married women, heterosexual and lesbian, in Israel. Through her de- scription of the process, well chosen selections from her narrators, and insightful analysis of both, Kahn demonstrates the primacy of childbearing among Israelis in general and how Israeli women have internalized the belief that motherhood is an Israeli woman's duty and mission. "If you're not a mother, you don't exist in Is- raeli society," Kahn quotes a social worker in a Jerusalem fertility clinic (p. 9). What is striking in Kahn's description of the insemination process is the de- gree of control exercised by the fertility clinics in this case. For example, Israeli Ministry of Health regulations have held that single women must first be screened before being "approved" for artificial insemination. According to Kahn most women are "approved" and yet the very process of screening positions the clinics, and hence the state, in a paternalistic role vis- a-vis the women seeking insemina- tion. (This exercise of control by various medical or mental health authorities re- curs throughout Kahn's research as well as in Sered's work and is demonstrative of the state's policing of women's bodies). The way in which women "choose" a sperm donor is at once outrageous and profoundly telling of Israeli state paternalism, attitudes toward race and class, lack of respect for individual choice, and the supremacy of the collective interest in re- producing Jews. From the personal accounts provided by Kahn, it becomes clear that ultimately the women have very little choice, and it often comes down to the nurse sitting across the table from the client saying in a maternal voice something to the effect of, 'Don't worry, I'll find someone just right for you.' Kahn notes that women were encouraged to choose someone who resembled them, "which in most cases meant 'light' or of Ashkenazi origin" (p. 37). "Certainly," writes Kahn, "there is no official policy that mandates the matching of Ashkenazi donor sperm with Ashkenazi unmarried women, but the informal practice of sperm selection 171</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews seems to suggest that it is desirable to observe and maintain ethnic difference in this process. That the long simmering tensions between Jews of different ethnic origins in Israel should be played out in the realm of assisted conception is not sur- prising, for this is the realm in which cultural dramas become most vivid" (p. 37). Kahn's prose is mellifluous and her adaptation of alternative models of kin- ship to the particular dynamics of Israeli culture is scintillating. Departing, for ex- ample, from Kath Weston's model of kinship in Families We Choose: Lesbians, Gays, Kinships, Kahn argues that unmarried Israeli women bearing children through ar- tificial insemination have no intention of challenging either so-called traditional family structures or the biological relationship between parents and their offspring. "The social consequences of their reproductive choices," explains Kahn, "are much less ambitious in their origin and more profound in their result: for what they have done is reveal inadvertently that heterosexuality and marriage have never had a monopoly over reproduction in the Jewish imagination; in the Jewish imagina- tion it is Jewish children born to Jewish mothers who have conceptual monopoly over reproduction, regardless of how they are conceived" (pp. 44-45). Over the course of the next three chapters, Kahn discusses the legal and re- ligious elements in these cultural dramas. In Chapter Two, Kahn discusses the Nachmani case, wherein an Israeli couple, Ruti and Dani Nachmani, underwent fertility treatment, resulting in eleven frozen embryos. As Ruti Nachmani had pre- viously undergone a hysterectomy, the couple hoped to use the frozen embryos with a surrogate mother. Before brokering such an agreement, however, the cou- ple divorced. Ruti Nachmani wished to proceed with a surrogate agreement, but the fertility clinic housing the embryos refused to release them because Dani Nachmani denied his consent to Ruti's use of the embryos, arguing that this would force him into fatherhood. Ruti Nachmani turned to the Israeli Supreme Court. In its initial decision, the court held in favor of Dani Nachmani's right not to become a parent. Subsequently the court agreed to hear the case again with wider panel of judges, at which time it ruled in Ruti Nachmani's favor. "In a surprising reversal of its earlier decision," writes Kahn, "the court ruled that Ruti's right to be a par- ent is more important than the right not to father children and ruled that she should be given custody of the embryos. In the words of Judge [sic] Tsvi Tal: 'the inter- est in parenthood is a basic and existential value, both for the individual and for society as a whole. In contrast, there is no value to the absence of parenthood' " (p. 67). The Court's language is somewhat disturbing when considered in the con- text of the abortion debate, both here and in Israel, and women's right and ability (in terms of social acceptance) to choose not to bear children. Moreover, it sug- gests that women have an inalienable right, as it were, to mother, while women in Israel lack equal civil rights in general. As Kahn, notes, however, the religious au- thorities (rabbinic writings on the issue), the civil courts, and public opinion are each heavily informed by an image so deeply imbedded it is unquestioned: that motherhood is the deepest desire of all women and should be pursued at all costs.... Consent for the new reproductive technologies is all but universal in Israel, a pronatalist state 172</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews where the despair of the barren women has deep cultural roots. Indeed one could argue that Ruti Nachmani's battle for motherhood echoes that of the bib- lical matriarch Rachel, who lamented: 'Give me sons or else I am dead' (Gen- esis 30:1)" (p. 70). Kahn's discussion in Chapters 3-5 of rabbinic approaches to reproductive technology is revealing. She demonstrates that rabbis, like anthropologists, ask questions about kinship, and hence the analytical tools of anthropology are useful for the examination of rabbinic deliberations on kinship. Interestingly, the devel- opment of reproductive technologies in concert with the deepest concern for the "reproduction" of Jews has all but vacated the relationship between Jewish kin- ship and Jewish biology in the rabbinic imagination. What is most illuminating in Kahn's book for those concerned with the relation between Israel as a Jewish state and Israel as a democratic state is the connection and confluence Kahn finds be- tween rabbinic understandings of kinship and reproductive technologies, and the approach to these by the largely secular, or non-orthodox, Israeli public. The state, for example, could not support, either theoretically or financially, reproductive technologies that produced babies not deemed halakhicly legitimate by the rab- binic authorities. The rabbis would prefer that single women not use artificial in- semination at all, but their choice to do so does not raise significant halakhic dif- ficulties for the rabbis. However, rabbinic authorities concur that married women resorting to artificial insemination (in cases of male-factor infertility) should use sperm donations from non-Jewish donors, thus avoiding the problem of mamzerut, among other halakhic problems. (A child born from a sexual union between a mar- ried Jewish woman and a Jew not her husband is illegitimate, "mamzer," and is not permitted to marry another Jew. A union between a married Jewish woman and a Gentile does not make the resulting child illegitimate). In conclusion, both Kahn and Sered's books provide a captivating read, but more importantly, they are required reading for any scholar of Israeli culture, and eminently useful for courses on Israeli culture as well as those addressing Judaism and gender.
