Albany: State University of New York Press, 1995. xiii, 283 pp. Elliot Wolfson's comprehensive study, Through a Speculum That Shines: Vision and Imagination in medieval jewish Mysticism (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994), has been recognized as a work of great significance in the overlapping disciplines of religious and Jewish studies. As scholars</page><page sequence="2">404 BOOK REVIEWS digest the conclusions of Wolfson's sweeping overview of the Jewish philo- sophical, poetic, and mystical traditions, certain concerns have come to the fore. Scholarly reception of the work has been somewhat preoccupied with Wolfson's identification of a phallocentric mythos in Kabbalah. This nascent tradition originates in antiquity and is recrudescent in both the Zohar and the Lurianic tradition. In fact, the scope of Wolfson's research has been far broader than this convenient reduction. These collections of earlier articles, some of which date to 1987, demonstrate that the direction of Wolfson's ideas has proceeded along two paths: the definition of ambiguous gender roles and functions in kabbalistic mythos, and the evolution of mystical symbolism from its origin in ancient mystery traditions to kabbalistic movements in their classical periods. The volume entitled Along the Path addresses a number of themes in kabbalistic mythos. In the essay entitled "The Image of Jacob Engraved upon the Throne," Wolfson uncovers an important link between the theosophical system of the hasidei Ashkenaz, pietists of the thirteenth-century Rhineland, and subsequent schools of thought. Although studies by Alexander Altmann, Asi Farber, and Joseph Dan had traced the extent to which these pietists received and transmitted the earliest traditions of the Merkavah literature, Wolfson identifies a startling aspect of this tradition. The German pietists also expressed the relationship of the Godhead to the created world in sexual terms, marking a direct relationship between the theology of the German pietists and the theosophical kabbalists of Spain and Provence. Two "cornerstones" of theosophical Kabbalah, the mythologization of the divine realm as male and female, and the consequent theurgic nature of the commandments, appear in Ashkenazic texts in the critical moment of transition from -the arcane doctrines of the Merkavah to the dynamism of medieval Jewish mysticism. Wolfson identifies these elements from a reading of extremely difficult and arcane manuscripts. In the article "The Tree That Is All," Wolfson examines a tradition re- garding the cosmic tree in the earliest theosophical kabbalistic text, the Bahir. Wolfson identifies the tradition as having its origins in Jewish-Christianity, as filtered through intermediate Neoplatonist influences. Wolfson suggests the possibility that "within the framework of Jewish-Christianity older Jewish mythologoumena were preserved that are discernible in the Hebrew text of the Bahir" (p. 66). Although Wolfson demurs from suggesting precise avenues of transmission, the article suggests a new paradigm for the examination of</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 405 ur-traditions of Western spirituality. The role of the sacred tree as demiur- gic intercessor between the divine and the profane is also phallocentric, a penetration o fdivinity into the secular and mundane world. A similar penetration is uncovered in the essay "Walking as Sacred Duty," which addresses themes of itinerant, mendicant pietism in the central corridor of mainstream Kabbalah, leading from the Zohar through the Safed Renaissance to Polish Hasidism. The romantic wandering portrayed in the first tradition evolves, in Safed, into an eroticized union with the Shekhinah, who is represented by the land of Israel. Classical Hasidism continued this portrayal of walking as a means of expressing the union of the male and female aspects of the divine, as well as gathering and redeeming the scattered sparks that the zaddik encounters on the way. The gender studies in Circle in the Square address well-known themes in theosophical Kabbalah, although Wolfson often departs from the most widely held understandings of these theme, up-ending them in favor of new understandings that are faithful to the intent of the text in question. The Torah is portrayed in feminine terms in the earliest mystical and aggadic texts, as noted in the essay "Female Imaging of the Torah."In subsequent Kabbalah, the Torah came to be portrayed in masculine terms, but Hasidic theologians restored the earlier motif. Wolfson illustrates this phenomenon by analyzing S. Y. Agnon's poignant "Tale of the Scribe," illustrating the resonance of this image in traditional Judaism. The articles "Circumcision, Vision of God and Textual Interpretation" and "Erasing the Erasure" address issues drawn overtly from the phallocentric undercurrent in Kabbalah. This tradition is based on the existence of masculine libidinal energy in the divine that is the agency of revelation (according to the metaphors, halakhic figures, and literary tropes attendign circumcision) and creative anergy (particularly in the tradition of the buzina de-kardinuta, the "hardened spark" of the Zohar's creation texts). Finally, Wolfson redefines the antue of divien union in his article "Crossing Gender Boundaries," arguing that rather than a mundane technical model, the union of the male and female aspect of the divine is a transformative act, incorporating a strong element of androgyny. The union proposed by classical Kabbalah does not glorify the masculine and feminine models, but rathe their transformation. Wolfson's studies reveal an unwillingness to be burdened with the con- clusions of the past and a rejection of glib, platitudinous understandings of Jewish mythology and symbolism. This rejection of cant in the pursuit of the core traditions of Western spirituality reflect a restless searching spirit</page><page sequence="4">406 BOOK REVIEWS that has been realized in the comprehensive studies made by this important scholar.
