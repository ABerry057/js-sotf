<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hannah K. Harrington. The Impurity Systems of Qumran and the Rabbis: Biblical Foundations. SBL Dissertation Series 143. Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1993. xv, 313 pp. This dissertation, produced under the direction of Jacob Milgrom and Daniel Boyarin, compares the hermeneutical perspectives on Scripture which yield the contrasting contamination systems of the Qumran community and the early rabbinic literature. The author proposes "to uncover the motives of the sectarians and the Rabbis in developing their impurity systems in the manner in which they do" (p. 1). Her conclusion is "that much of what appears to be innovation in contrast to biblical principles is actually a valid, astute reading of Scripture itself' (p. 1). As a result, Hannah K. Harrington urges the reader to view "the sectarians and the Rabbis [as] careful exegetes who had a sacred regard for the divinely appointed Torah. Their concepts of impurity grow out of Scriptural roots rather than out of different stock" (p. 1-2). After an introductory review of research on the issue (pp. 1-43), the book is divided between the Qumran material (pp. 47-110) and the rabbinic material (pp. 113-260). A brief summary of conclusions is followed by appendices on the role of purity in Pharisaic table fellowship (pp. 267-281) and a synoptic chart of scriptural, sectarian, and rabbinic perspectives on purity (pp. 283-291). The bibliography is excellent. Lacking is an index of citations from primary sources. In light of the flood of new texts and materials in Qumran studies, Harrington has chosen an opportune moment to review the legal traditions of the community on cultic contamination. She has industriously collected the various sources, old and recent, and has done a fine job of drawing</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 143 out the connections between the sectarian constructions of legal themes and the various scriptural texts which inspire or support them. This, of course, involves a good deal of reconstructive interpretation, for the Qumran texts rarely represent the exegetical logic which yields their specific legal norms. Nevertheless, her description of the sectarians as rather strict constructionists of scriptural law who wish to "utilize Scripture's silences to increase con- tamination or purification rulings in order to safely avoid transgression of Scripture" (p. 264) seems well taken. As a result, this section of the volume is an important point of departure for further discussion of this issue. When dealing with rabbinic materials, of course, Harrington is required to confront the massive scholarship of Jacob Neusner, as well as the Neusner-Sanders debate on the social function of Pharisaic purity rules (pp. 267-281). Her contribution here is a revisionist one, in line with her larger attempt to reconstruct the exegetical reasoning which links the later rules to scriptural texts. While agreeing in substance with Neusner's articulation of the contamination system of Mishnah-Tosefta, Harrington disputes his (and E. P. Sanders's) view that fundamental elements of that system stand in contradiction to, or, at least, in asymmetrical relation with, scriptural rules. The thrust of her discussion of the rabbinic rules is to demonstrate that the Mishnah and Tosefta approach Scripture not as a collection of atomistic rules referring only to themselves, but as an integrated web of meaning in which implications drawn from the language of one rule must be applied to the interpretation of other related rulings. As she puts it: "The Rabbis are not inventing a new purity system. ... They are rather reading Scriptural laws as a system. There are gaps in the purity laws of the Torah which must be filled in order to establish the whole system .... [These] are filled by the Rabbis in accordance with principles identified in the text itself' (pp. 114-115). It is difficult to imagine why any historical student of ancient Judaism would presume to deny this-including Neusner. His work on rabbinic legal thought persistently sought the role played by rabbinic readers in constructing systemic "lines" with which to connect the "dots" represented by scriptural rules. What Neusner claimed to discern is the agenda-or hermeneutic standpoint-which helped account for the patterns of meaning within which rabbinic readers located the scriptural texts. That hermeneutic standpoint was not "scriptural" (in the sense of constituting Scripture's intended meaning) because it could not be. Readers are not the texts they read, and their readings are always constructions of the text, not the text itself. Neusner's simple point was to show how the rabbinic system of purities represented a distinctive</page><page sequence="3">144 BOOK REVIEWS reading of scriptural evidence, a reading shaped by the particular interests which sages brought to their texts. Reading Neusner as I do, I find Harrington's presentation of him a bit of a caricature. Neusner, no less than Harrington, is vitally interested in reconstructing the rabbinic conversation with scriptural texts. The burden of Neusner's work on the law of purities was, likewise, to measure the rabbinic construction of the scriptural system with that of Scripture itself. Where Harrington differs from Neusner is in her estimate of the symmetry between the two systems and the degree to which rabbinic sages were conscious of their own role in the production of scriptural meaning. She sees far greater symmetry between the two systems and interprets this as an indication of the degree to which rabbinic readers felt bound by scriptural guidelines. Neusner, by contrast, sees greater asymmetry and interprets this to indicate a rather self-conscious effort to sweep scriptural rules into a new discursive framework. This is, in itself, an appropriate area for productive dispute. But I am not convinced that Harrington's estimate of rabbinic reading offers much of a hermeneutical breakthrough. Indeed both her work and Neusner's suffer from a certain woodenness in their portrayals of rabbinic reading. Both scholars seem to assume that we can fix the "original" meaning of a biblical text as an established benchmark against which to evaluate the validity of all later "interpretations." In order to highlight the innovativeness of the rabbinic system, Neusner seems to have preferred the most exegetically parsimonious renderings of the "original meaning" of Scripture. Harrington is correct to point this out. But it is not obvious that her own drawing of the systemic "lines" between Scripture's "dots" is any more "original" to the intentions of those who drew up the various scriptural codes or those who edited them in their current form. Nevertheless, she has indeed provided a rich sense of the systemic possibilities of scriptural purity law and an enhanced appreciation of the complex web of meanings which link rabbinic, Qumranic, and scriptural legal traditions. In sum, there is somewhat more smoke in this work than fire. But there is enough of the latter to illumine important questions regarding early Judaism's preoccupation with cultic contamination.
