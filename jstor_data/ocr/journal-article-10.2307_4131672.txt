Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2004. 351 pp. In 1755, the young Moses Mendelssohn presented his friend Gotthold Ephraim Lessing with a short essay. The essay was the culmination of numerous conversations between the two that centered on the meaning and value of Spinoza's philosophy. At the time, Lessing had been writing defenses (Rettungen) of maligned Christian figures. Mendelssohn imitated this practice and wrote a defense of Spinoza at the time one of the most detested thinkers in Germany. Unknowingly, Mendelssohn inaugurated a literary genre-the Spinoza defense. Thinkers, philosophers, and scholars as diverse as Johann Gottfried Herder, Heinrich Heine, and Nachum Sokolow have all sought to rescue Spinoza, and, judging from two recent works, this desire has not ebbed. Nancy Levene's Spinoza 's Revelation: Religion, Democracy, and Reason is a synoptic interpretation of Spinoza's opus treating his metaphysics, theology, politics, and biblical interpretation. Levene seeks to take the heterodox edge off Spinoza. Though there is a long tradition of reading Spinoza as a duplicitous atheist, in recent times Leo Strauss has given this line of interpretation great currency. For Strauss, Spinoza represents the paradigmatic example of an esoteric writer. Although Spinoza often writes as if he believes in revelation, theism, and natural morality, careful inspection of Spinoza's writings shows that these are red herrings meant to divert attention from Spinoza's unstinting naturalism, atheism, and amoralism. *I thank Michael Satlow for very helpful comments on an earlier draft of this essay. I, however, take full responsibility for the views expressed here. 427</page><page sequence="2">Michah Gottlieb In setting out his interpretation of Spinoza, Strauss focuses almost exclu- sively on Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-Politicus (TTP). Within the TTP, Strauss claims to find contradictions that render Spinoza's intentions suspect. Strauss's rule in interpreting Spinoza is simple: "In case of a contradiction, the statement most opposed to what Spinoza considered the vulgar view has to be regarded as expressing his serious view."' Strauss birthed a generation of devoted students, including Yirmiyahu Yovel and Steven Smith, but there is another group of important scholars, such as Errol Harris and Alan Donagan, who have resisted Strauss's esoteric reading of Spinoza. For these scholars, there are no contradictions in the TTP for, read carefully, Spinoza naturalizes positive Judaism and Christianity in that work. Levene is clearly part of the anti-Straussian camp, and though he is rarely men- tioned, Strauss's ghost hovers over her work. What distinguishes Levene from other anti-Straussians is her attempt to recover Spinoza for Jewish religious thought. In con- sequence, rather than considering the metaphysics of the TTP "naturalized," Levene claims that the metaphysics of both the Ethics and the TTP are close to the "biblical" view of God. As she puts it, "not only is Spinoza's a biblical God, with a biblical concept of creation; Spinoza's God is in fact far closer to biblical theology and phil- osophy than many, perhaps most Jewish theological positions through the ages" (240). For Levene, what is "most at stake in Spinoza's philosophy is human freedom" (xi). This involves the imperative to become like God-the ultimate standard of freedom. God's freedom is a function of God's being causa sui, or self-created. Human beings can achieve similar freedom through their knowledge of things according to their causes or ethical actions. Levene seeks to undercut the claim that Spinoza distinguishes between a "higher" salvation for the elite philo- sopher that is cognitive and a "lower" salvation for the masses that involves obe- dience to ethical norms. According to Levene's reading, Spinoza considers it "just as valuable" to live according to ethical norms as to know things according to their causes, as both involve "struggle and labor" (234). The endeavor to interpret Spinoza as a religious thinker is not new. It goes back to the eighteenth-century German Romantics. In recovering this approach to Spinoza and trying to articulate it for contemporary theology, Levene does an important service. She likewise advances our understanding of Spinoza by stres- sing the centrality of freedom for him. But I wish that she had executed her recov- ery of Spinoza differently. As Levene ranges over a huge amount of material, to do justice to her argu- ments would require much more space than is available for this review. Therefore, I will dwell on one of the central concepts in her book, namely her interpretation of Spinoza's claim that God is "self-caused" (causa sui). In exploring Spinoza's contention that God is "self-caused," Levene draws a sharp contrast between Spinoza's conception of God and the "God of the philoso- phers," which she attributes first and foremost to Aristotle. For Levene, Aristotle's 1. Leo Strauss, Persecution and the Art of Writing (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1952), 186. 428</page><page sequence="3">Defending Spinoza? God is "uncaused," existing necessarily from eternity. In contrast, Spinoza's God is "self-caused," which she takes to be a contrasting concept meaning that "God's creation of the world is simultaneously of himself' (56). Human beings have an ethical imperative to imitate God by becoming "independent, original" (57). This mirrors the biblical injunction to "be holy for the Lord your God is holy" (Leviticus 19:2). As Levene puts it, "In moving from an uncaused God to one that is self-caused, Spinoza is revising the human project, from what is meta- physically impossible to become like an uncaused God, to what is suggestively possible, to become causa sui, independent original" (57). Although this reading of Spinoza is suggestive, I find it philologically suspect and philosophically problematic. First, in glossing "self-cause," Spinoza writes in the very first definition of the Ethics, "By cause of itself, I understand that whose essence involves existence, or that whose nature cannot be conceived except as existing." This is a formal ontological claim involving necessary existence rather than a claim about self-creation. As Harry Wolfson puts it, "causa sui means causelessness ... self-sufficiency, and hence actual existence."2 Indeed, Spinoza did not originate the term causa sui-it was in current usage as a Latin equivalent of Descartes' etrepar soi and was first invoked by pseudo-Justin Martyr in the fifth century.3 Fur- thermore, the whole notion that God "brings himself into existence" seems quite pro- blematic, for how can something bring itself into existence unless it already exists? To claim that causa sui is identical to the biblical notion of creation likewise seems anomalous. If the Aristotelean unmoved mover does not seem identical to the biblical God who speaks and brings things into existence, then Spinoza's God seems no closer. As Yehezkel Kaufmann has shown long ago, what distinguishes Genesis from its mythical counterparts in the Ancient Near East is its lack of theog- ony-a far cry from a God who "creates himself." I am likewise unclear how the levitical injunction to "be holy because God is holy" reflects the idea of being inde- pendent and original. Similarly, the idea that Spinoza praises an expressionist ethic of "self-creation" seems doubtful. Whereas Nietzsche translates the Enlighten- ment's valuation of human power, freedom, and creativity into an ethics of aesthetic personality expression, Spinoza seems to be much closer to the Stoic quietist ethic, according to which freedom derives from adjusting oneself to reality. In sum, Levene opens an important direction for contemporary theology-the reappropriation of Spinoza as a religious thinker. But what makes Spinoza so fasci- nating is that he presents an intriguing theological model that is profoundly unbibli- cal: Spinoza does away with miracles, free will, and divine providence while holding out the possibility of worldly salvation through recognition of our unity with God. In my view, Levene's goal would have been much better served had she stressed the refreshing unfamiliarity of Spinoza's decidedly unbiblical God. Like Spinoza 's Revelation, Willi Goetschel's Spinoza's Modernity: Mendels- sohn, Lessing, and Heine seeks to defend Spinoza. But Goetschel's agenda is 2.

Goetschel thinks that Spinoza's thought has been "marginalized," ren- dered "invisible," and subject to "erasure" (3). But it is not the history of Jewish thought that concerns Goetschel. Rather it is that Spinoza has been "ignored" (3) by Western philosophy when in fact he represents a "key moment in the formation of modem critical thought" (3). For Goetschel, the significance of Spinoza can be appreciated through the "Jewish" interpretation of his work given by three key thinkers-Mendelssohn, Lessing, and Heine. It is this line of interpretation that makes clear the "Jewish dimension in Spinoza's thought as a key to understanding his philosophical project in critical terms" (4). What is this "Jewish" line of interpretation? The term that Goetschel conti- nually returns to is the "scandal" of Spinoza's Jewishness. For Goetschel, bio- graphy and thought are intimately connected. Spinoza's thought is "Jewish" and is defined by its tendency to bridge the universal and the particular, which opposes Western universalism and anticipates postmodernism. This bridging of the universal and particular manifests itself in Spinoza's undercutting the tra- ditional mind/body dichotomy, valorizing the affects and imagination, separating religion and state, and appreciating the contingency of all philosophical and theo- logical discourse. Goetschel seeks to recover this interpretation of Spinoza, which was recognized by his German Jewish interpreters but subsequently forgotten. Goetschel's book is divided into four parts. In the first part, we get another synoptic account of Spinoza's philosophy exploring his ontology, epistemology, theory of affects, theory of religion, theory of interpretation, and politics. The second, third, and fourth parts examine Mendelssohn's, Lessing's, and Heine's "receptions" of Spinoza. I will focus on Goetschel's lengthy, hundred-page discussion of Mendelssohn's reception of Spinoza because these are the two thinkers with whom I am most familiar. Goetschel is to be lauded for rejecting some of the conventional wisdom about Mendelssohn. I am particularly sympathetic to his discontent with the margin- alization of Mendelssohn among most Anglo-American philosophers and with his attempt to recover the contemporary significance of Mendelssohn's thought. Fur- thermore, in seeking to "examine [Mendelssohn's] thought as a whole" (86), Goetschel is correct in rejecting the bifurcation in Mendelssohn studies, which treats Mendelssohn's philosophical work in isolation from his Jewish writings. Goetschel likewise does a service in moving the discussion of Mendelssohn's relation to Spinoza beyond the usual platitudes concerning Jerusalem 's reliance on the TTP. But in treating Mendelssohn's relationship to Spinoza, Goetschel's meth- odological approach is unclear. In the introduction, Goetschel speaks of a "Jewish reception of Spinoza" (5), but in the section on Mendelssohn, he hedges, speaking of "a particular constellation [of shared concerns] that lead Men- delssohn to arguments and formulations similar to those we find in Spinoza" (90). In fact, Goetschel suggests at least three notions of Spinoza's relation to Mendels- sohn, Lessing, and Heine: (1) a "Jewish" interpretation of Spinoza's writings; (2) Spinoza as a decisive influence on the way these thinkers formulated their ideas; and (3) a confluence of ideas that derives from common concerns "even though direct influence may seem out of the question" (90). 430</page><page sequence="5">Defending Spinoza? Whichever of the three notions Goetschel is arguing, I find many of these "family resemblances" (90) between Spinoza and his Jewish successors unconvin- cing. For example, Goetschel tells us that Mendelssohn's account of "the paralle- lism between mind and body ... points ... towards the unique way in which Spinoza grasps these issues" (95). In reality, the affinities between Mendelssohn's and Spinoza's views of the mind-body question derive from Mendelssohn's Leib- nizianism and can be attributed to the fact (noted by Mendelssohn himself) that Leibniz's preestablished harmony was inspired by Spinoza's psychophysical par- allelism. Mendelssohn's approach to the mind-body problem mirrors Leibniz's and breaks from Spinoza insofar as both Mendelssohn and Leibniz regard final causality as a key explanatory principle. Goetschel likewise thinks that Mendelssohn's aesthetic theory, under- girded by a "dynamic, non-hierarchical" (109) understanding of the affects, brings him "into close vicinity" (ibid.) to Spinoza. But although aesthetics was the field in which Mendelssohn arguably made his most important contri- butions, Spinoza is distinguished by his indifference to aesthetics.4 Mendels- sohn's important influences in the field of aesthetics include Leibniz's Elementa Juris Naturalis, expanded on by Wolff in his 1738 Psychologia Empirica, Baumgarten's famous 1750 Aesthetica, and Burke's 1750 Philosophi- cal Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful. Now perhaps Goetschel is claiming that Mendelssohn adopted Spinoza's theory of the affects, which helped him introduce important innovations to the aesthetic tradition that he had received. Goetschel puts particular emphasis on Spinoza's "revaloriz[ation]" of the imagination, which not only represents objects but also "plays a central role in our knowledge of the world" (52). But to claim that Spinoza "revalorizes" the imagination is surprising, considering Spinoza's fre- quent derogation of imagination as a source of confused and inadequate ideas (cf. Spinoza's critique of the prophets and his ranking imagination as the lowest of the three types of knowledge). Though imagination has a role in Spi- noza's epistemology, Goetschel requires a much more detailed argument to show how this amounts to a "revalorization" of the imagination. This would involve comparing Spinoza's conception of the imagination to his philosophical contemporaries and immediate predecessors, especially Descartes. But Goetschel's entire discussion of Spinoza's conception of the imagination occurs on a single page (52) without a single reference to a primary text. With regard to political theory, Goetschel claims that Mendelssohn's "rigor- ous separation of state and church" (159) recalls Spinoza, who, in hyphenating the theological and political, "presses the point of the problem of their interpenetration and the need for the separation and recognition of the respective independence of each from the other" (65). But the idea of a rigorous separation between church and state, though questionable in Mendelssohn, is untenable for Spinoza. One 4.

In general, I find Goetschel's use of sources idiosyncratic, for he often ignores sources that do not fit with his thesis. Thus, he surprisingly does not even mention Mendelssohn's most extended treatment of Spinoza, lecture 13 of the Morgenstuden (Morning Hours). The reason Goetschel ignores this lecture is that it is an extended refutation of Spinoza that contradicts Goetschel's theory of a "Jewish" appropriation of Spinozistic ideas. Indeed, instead of treating lecture 13 of the Morgenstuden, Goetschel devotes a chapter to lecture 14, in which Mendelssohn discusses Lessing's "refined Spinozism"-a supposed confirmation of Mendelssohn's appro- priation of Spinoza. But Goetschel fails to mention the crucial fact that in that very lecture, Mendelssohn offers an extended refutation of "refined Spinozism." Although I am sympathetic to Goetschel's attempt to uncover contemporary significance for Spinoza and his "Jewish" readers, I am unclear as to how Goetschel interprets these figures. Thus, Goetschel claims that Mendelssohn's introduction of some minor correctives to Leibniz's metaphysics shows that Mendelssohn wishes to set forth "a critical reminder of the problematic nature of the conditions of philo- sophical discourse, its contingent character, and, as a consequence, the impossibility for closure and final determination in philosophical reflection, whose very element is defined by fluidity and motion" (91). Similarly, the fact that Mendelssohn's 1755 works Die Philosophische Gesprdche (The Philosophical Dialogues) and Ober die Empfindungen (On Sentiments) are written in dialogue and epistolary form, respect- ively, shows that "Mendelssohn brings a new air to philosophy ... in a form that reflects a new dialogical way of thinking that is wary of the pitfalls of the monolithic construction of systems" (87). But these claims are greatly underdetermined by the evidence. Instead of seeing Mendelssohn's minor corrections to Leibniz as articulat- ing a new conception of truth, why not see them as attempts to perfect Leibniz's insights and thereby reach objective truth? Similarly, Mendelssohn's use of dialogue to write philosophy had a distinguished history from Plato to Berkeley's Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous (1713). Ober die Empfindungen was directly modeled on Lord Shaftesbury's 1709 The Moralists, A Philosophical Rhapsody (including the names of the epistolary protagonists). Goetschel likewise overreads Mendelssohn's claim that universal religious truth can be known to all through reason or common sense. For Goetschel, this shows that Mendelssohn believes "any Eurocentric or other kind of limited view of history is principally challenged and shown to be opposed to both true religion and reason" (125). But doesn't the fact that Mendelssohn claims that the conception of God upheld by the European religious Enlightenment (unique, omniscient, omnipotent, good) is the "true" conception knowable by all recall the very Eurocentrism that Goetschel sees Mendelssohn opposing? Indeed, rather than basing his analysis on Spinoza's German Jewish interpreters-Mendelssohn, Lessing, and Heine (though I am unsure why the Lutheran Lessing is deemed a "Jewish" interpreter of Spinoza)--Goetschel seems to rely on a Continental school of Spinoza interpretation that derives from such postmodern luminaries as Gilles Deleuze and Antonio Negri. But 432</page><page sequence="7">Defending Spinoza? someone who is unfamiliar with this tradition of Spinoza interpretation is likely to get lost when encountering Goetschel's interpretation of Spinoza. The idea that Spinoza, Lessing, Mendelssohn, and Heine articulate compel- ling conceptions of the relation of the universal to the particular is an intriguing one. But Goetschel would have done better treating each figure in their historical specificity rather than trying to draw what appears to this reviewer to be an artifi- cial line of "Jewish" descent from Spinoza through the others. In sum, although treatments of Spinoza such as Levene's and Goetschel's seek to defend Spinoza by showing his anticipation of contemporary intellectual trends, in my view, they actually show insufficient regard for their hero. For in dis- regarding the profound ways in which Spinoza's assumptions diverge from our own, both Levene and Goetschel annihilate Spinoza's "Otherness," if you will. If Spinoza merely anticipates contemporary thought, then he seems dispensable. But if he transports us to an alien intellectual environment that can make us rethink contemporary assumptions, then I can imagine no better defense of Spinoza.
