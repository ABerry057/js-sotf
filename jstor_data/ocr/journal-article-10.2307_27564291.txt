As a journalist and essayist, he con tributed to and was read widely in a staggering number of Jewish periodicals in central Europe?several of which, such as the first Jewish nationalist periodical in the German language, Selbst-Emancipation?he founded and edited himself.2 1. To date, four monographs have detailed Birnbaum's life. The latest is my own, a dissertation titled "Nation, Peoplehood and Religion in the Life and Thought of Nathan Birnbaum," submitted to Stanford University. The second is an unpublished dissertation from Dusseldorf written by Michael K?hntopf-Gentz; the third a monograph on Birnbaum's Zionist thought published in Hebrew by Joachim Doron, titled Ha-guto ha-tsiyonit shel natan birnbaum (Jerusalem: Ha-Sifriyah ha-Tsiyonit hal-yad ha-Histadrut ha-Tsiyonit ha-holamit, 748 [1988]); and finally, a study of Birnbaum's use of language in the development of his ideology, Identity, Society, and Language: The Odyssey of Nathan Birnbaum by linguist Joshua A. Fishman (Ann Arbor, MI: Karoma, 1987). These, along with a few article-length pieces by Robert Wistrich, Barbara Galli, and Emmanuel Goldsmith, represent all of the academic work on Birnbaum. None of these works, with the exception of my own and K?hntof-Gentz's dissertation, are full-length biographies; each takes a methodological or temporal point of departure and emphasizes one aspect of interest in Birnbaum's career. Most significantly, however, none but my own makes extensive use of the most important repository of primary documents pertaining to Birnbaum, the Birnbaum family archive in Toronto. (The one exception to all of these is a short biographical piece written by Solomon Birnbaum, Nathan Birnbaum's oldest son and in whose home his papers are preserved.) The archive, maintained after Solomon Birnbaum's death by his son, David Birnbaum, is an exhaustive collection of Birnbaum's publications, manuscripts, correspon dence, and secondary pieces about Birnbaum collected both during his life and after. In total, it houses documents numbering in the tens of thousands, perhaps the most complete known collection of papers of a major European Jewish intellectual maintained in private hands. Thanks to the hospitality and gen erosity of the Birnbaum family?including the archive's main curator, David Birnbaum and his wife Jytte, as well as David's brothers Eleazar and Jacob, who provided full access to the archives, as well as useful assistance and commentary on my work?I have been able to engage comprehensively with Birnbaum's intellectual legacy. In particular, the letters exchanged between Nathan Birnbaum and Theodor Herzl provide a fascinating and intimate window into the Jewish nationalist debate and nego tiation leading up to the 1897 Zionist Congress in Basel. 2. Birnbaum was a founder, principal editor, and contributor to no fewer than five periodicals, including the first Jewish nationalist periodical in German, Selbst-Emancipation; its successor, 241</page><page sequence="2">Jess Olson Yet today, little of his legacy is known, and his massive literary and intellectual production has received surprisingly little attention from Jewish historians. To his contemporaries, that he would be relegated to such a fate probably would have been surprising. Several testimonials show that he was regarded as a pivotal figure in rurn-of-the-cenrury Jewish intellectual life. One sterling example that reflects his stature in the minds of those same contemporaries can be found in a recent biography of Franz Kafka.3 When Kafka attended one of the Jewish cultural evenings at Prague's Jewish Town Hall, the Bar Kokhba club, or the Caf? Savoy?some of which he was instrumental in organizing?he usually spent his time indulging his interest in observing the faces of other atten dees, not necessarily paying attention to the speaker. But on at least two occasions he was engaged enough to actually record his thoughts: once when Martin Buber addressed the assembly, the other when Nathan Birnbaum did. Kafka found Buber uninspiring and pat, but his reaction to Birnbaum 's words was quite different. The vision Birnbaum spun of the vibrant Jewish nation to be found among the Yiddish speaking masses of eastern Europe struck a strong chord with Kafka. Birnbaum's words seem to have played at least a part in Kafka's own well-known ruminations on questions of his Jewish identity. And by no means was Kafka alone in his reaction; Franz Rosenzweig, argu ably the central Jewish philosopher and theologian of the early twentieth century, described Birnbaum as the "living exponent of Jewish intellectual history."4 Kafka's and Rosenzweig's testimonials share a thread with so many of Birnbaum's associates, from his youth to his old age: Birnbaum was both a captivating and J?dische Volkszeitung', Neue Zeitung, the Yiddish D"r birnboyms vokhenblat; Der Aufstieg; and Der Ruf He was a major contributor to and editor of the Berlin Zionist organ Zion, the Jewish cultural periodical Freistatt, Ost und West, Martin Buber's Jude, and Die Welt, as well as to an innumerable number of other periodicals?Jewish and non-Jewish?published throughout Europe. 3. Rainier Stach, Kafka: The Decisive Years (Orlando: Harcourt, 2005), 63. Stach describes Kafka's affinity for Birnbaum thus: "Nathan Birnbaum, who coined the term Zionism and was Herzl's challenger, offered a different interpretation [from Buber], On January 18, 1912, at 'folk song night' at the Bar Kokhba in Prague, he declared, 'The eastern Jews are a complete, joyous and vital people, with a strong and original humor.' This preeminent (and now forgotten) cultural Zionist could not pass up the opportunity to see a performance of the actors in the Caf? Savoy. Kafka hung on every word of Birnbaum's lecture." Stach asserts that Kafka did not mention Birnbaum in his famous diary; in fact, he did make the following entry on January 24, 1912: "Folksong evening. Dr. Nathan Birnbaum is the lecturer. Jewish habit of inserting 'my dear ladies and gentlemen' at every pause in his talk. Was repeated at the beginning of Birnbaum's talk to the point of being ridicu lous. But from what I know of L?wy I think that these recurrent expressions, which are frequently found in ordinary Yiddish conversations too, such as 'Weh ist mir!' or 'S'ist nicht' or 'S'ist viel zu reden,' are not intended to cover up embarrassment but are rather intended, like ever-fresh springs, to stir up the sluggish stream of speech that is never fluent enough for the Jewish temperament."

Letter from Franz Rosenzweig to Max Landau, February 1924, cited in Steven Ascheim, Brothers and Strangers: The East European Jew in German and German Jewish Consciousness, 1800-1923 (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1982), 114. 242</page><page sequence="3">The Late Zionism of Nathan Birnbaum inspiring presence and a deep and original thinker. Berthold Feiwel, himself a dis tinguished Zionist and a longtime associate of Birnbaum, wrote in 1924, I remember distinctly what his form and his effect for us was ... [H]e was the first. And when the movement for national rebirth became a reality for the first time, it was impossible to forget that he forged the path and knew the right way, and thus earned the thanks of his people; [and although] he has revised and renewed his decisions constantly to be true to himself, it is he, Nathan Birnbaum, [whose] name remains nothing less than our symbol and lodestar.5 But no testimonial says as much about Birnbaum's influence on Jewish history as the simple fact that it was a word he coined in 1892, Zionism, that came to be the definitive term for Jewish nationalism.6 Though he is most often remembered, when at all, for this single contribution to the Jewish political lexicon, Birnbaum's involvement in Jewish intellectual history was immeasurably deeper. The comments of his contemporaries are a useful measure of his past importance, but even a cursory glance at his intellectual r?sum? shows that his legacy deserves a thorough reassessment. His nationalist and prolific literary career began when he was only seventeen, the youngest among a dynamic group of Jewish nationalist student activists. After he left Zionism sixteen years later, Birnbaum continued to be a powerful public voice in Jewish politics and culture. He embraced the Yiddish language and the culture of eastern European Jewry, and he was welcomed as a native son, becoming the principal transmitter of the eastern Jewish Volksgeist to Martin Buber, among others.7 He ran for public office in 1907 in a Reichsrat electoral district in Galicia.8 His fascination with Yiddish-speaking Jewish autonomism reached its apex at the First Conference of the Yiddish Language, the only of its kind, which he organized with Chaim 5. Berthold Feiwel, "Ein Brief," Von Sinn des Judentums: Ein Sammelbuch zu ehren Nathan Birnbaums (Frankfurt am Main: Hermon Verlag, 1924), 14-15. 6. The first use of the adjective zionistische occurs in the article "Um Ehre und Wohlfahrt unseres Volk," Selbst-Emancipation I, no. 1 (April 1, 1890), and the noun Zionismus appears in "Die Siele der j?dische-nationalen Bestrebung, II" Selbst-Emancipation III, no. 4 (May 16, 1890). 7. As Ascheim details in Brothers and Strangers, Ost und West was part of a small but important German-Jewish avant-garde preoccupation with the eastern European Jewish aesthetic known as the J?dische Rennaisance (the term was coined by Buber in the initial issue of Ost und West). For Buber, this period of intellectual development, documented in his essays in Ost und West, led directly to his 1908 turn to Hasidism, the foundation for much of his most important later thought. Birnbaum, however, served much more as senior guiding force to the Ost und West circle. In Ascheim's words, it was Birnbaum who "was a prime mediator, interpreter, and champion of Ostjudentum to West European Jewish intellectuals" {Brothers and Strangers, 114). 8. A photograph, preserved in the Buczacz yizkor book (as well as in the Birnbaum family archive) dramatically demonstrates Birnbaum's notoriety. It shows Birnbaum being greeted by a crowd of hundreds of well-wishers for his election (including a teenage S. Y. Agnon, who would write about the 1907 election). Birnbaum would go on to lose the election, although archival sources indicate a distinct pattern of electoral fraud perpetrated by the Polish political machine behind Polish nationalist candidate Stefan Moysa. 243</page><page sequence="4">Jess Olson Zhitlovsky.9 Finally, in his final intellectual transformation to Orthodox religious belief, he was quickly ushered into the upper echelons of the Agudat Yisrael by Jacob Rosenheim, one of the central leaders of Europe's largest Orthodox Jewish political party, and remained a serious contributor to Jewish intellectual dis course.10 But one feature remained constant for his entire life: to his contempor aries, he was always carefully watched, a voice whose ideas caused, time and again, waves of controversy and concerted debate. But after his death in 1937, Birnbaum's name slipped into obscurity. Much of the reason for this was the course of history itself. When Birnbaum abandoned Zionism and ultimately appeared to adopt the position of its ultra-Orthodox opponents, he was remembered as one who had picked the wrong side. Equally damaging was his decision to cast his lot with the ideology of doykayt, the belief that the national struggle of European Jewry would be solved in the Diaspora, not through mass immigration to Palestine. His infatuation with the "East," the expressions of eastern European Jewish identity, folkways, and most famously, the Yiddish language, shifted his focus away from Palestine entirely in seeking a home for the cultivation of Jewish national culture. When the events of the 1930s increasingly showed that this hope was a cruel delusion, the credibility of Birnbaum and all who shared his opinions was critically undermined. Finally, Birnbaum's turn from secularism to religious Orthodoxy?the opposite of the standard narrative of the Jewish intellectual?led many to dismiss his ideas as at best flighty, at worst unstable.11 Thus, it does indeed seem that Birnbaum, in his many transformations, often picked the wrong side, and he paid dearly for it. Perhaps Ahad Ha'am's character istically acerbic description of Theodor Herzl, "fortunate in life and fortunate in death," if inverted, is the best description of Birnbaum's career.12 Though often 9. For an exhaustive study of the Czernowitz Yiddish-language conference, including essays by both Birnbaum and Zhitlovsky describing their respective roles in the conference, see Max Weinreich, Di ershte yidishe sprakh-konferents: barikhten, dokumentn un opklangenfun der tshernovitser konfer ents, 1908 (Vilna: YIVO Bibliotekh, 1931). 10. See Rosenheim's contribution to the 1924 Festschrift written in honor of Birnbaum's sixtieth birthday, Von Sinn des Judentums. Additionally, Rosenheim's correspondence preserved in the Birnbaum family archive extensively details the relationship)?sometimes fraught?between Birn baum, Rosenheim, and the Agudah. 11. A fine illustration of the animosity held among Zionist biographers and historians toward Birnbaum is to be found in Ernst Pawel's biography of Theodor Herzl, The Labyrinth of Exile (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1989). He dispenses with Birnbaum in one short passage: "Nathan Birnbaum, one of [the] founders [of Austrian Zionism], is generally credited with having been the originator of the word 'Zionism,' the one solid achievement in a career full of bizarre convolu tions... Within a little band of uncommonly contentious and opinionated individualists, the hot tempered and hirsute Birnbaum probably qualified as the most volatile and aggressive" (271). However, as I demonstrate in my article "Nathan Birnbaum and Tuvia Horowitz: Friendship and the origins of an Orthodox ideologue," Jewish History 17, no. 1 (2003): 1-29, there is good reason to take seriously Birnbaum's embrace of Orthodoxy as a viable and pragmatic intellectual choice, as well as an intellectually compelling one. 12. This quotation is taken from Steven Zipperstein, AhadHa 'am: Elusive Prophet (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993), xvii. 244</page><page sequence="5">The Late Zionism of Nathan Birnbaum prescient and insightful, he had the unfortunate fate of seldom catching the fickle high tide of Jewish public opinion. But on a close examination of his writing, it becomes clear that his work deserves to be taken seriously on its own merits. For not only did Birnbaum explore more of the intellectual courses and allegiances that spoke to so many of the Jews of Europe at a particularly fruitful time in Jewish intellectual history, he also explored them and wrote about them with rare depth and sophistication. His writing on a vast array of issues provides a unique and largely untapped perspective on early twentieth-century European Jewish politics and culture. As this study will show, the role that he and his ideas played in one of the most storied moments in modem Jewish politics?the birth of Zionism as a mass movement?was significant, and its details shed nuanced light on the move ment's early history. An excellent starting point to begin this reassessment of Birnbaum's conten tious legacy is the moment at which it became contentious: the period of his estrangement from Zionism. In early 1896, just before the release of Theodor Herzl's Der Judenstaat, Birnbaum was at the height of his influence in the van guard of a new Jewish nationalist ideology. If there was one figure to whom other Jewish nationalists could point with near unanimity as a key figure in central European Zionism, it was Birnbaum. But in less than eighteen months, he had embarked on a course of confrontation and conflict with Herzl that wrecked his position, more than a decade in the making, at the precise moment when Zionism was coalescing into a viable political entity. Although he would remain an important voice in Jewish nationalist issues for many years, he would never again be in a position to have so momentous a chance to participate in the realization of a vision he had done so much to create. In fact, any reassessment of Birnbaum's life and its importance to modem Jewish intellectual and political history must start by understanding this choice. This is particularly essential given the number of crucial sources available, many of which are housed in the underutilized Birnbaum family archive and go far toward resolving outstanding questions. These include not just Birnbaum's writings during the period but also, even more illuminating, the unpublished docu ments and correspondence that surrounded his decision. These sources reveal that the origins of Birnbaum's departure from Zionism are significant not only for what they tell us about Birnbaum's career and personality but also for what they show about the intellectual conflicts that shaped the early Zionist movement of the late 1890s?the tantalizing paths not taken, directions in Jewish nationalism that fell by the wayside in Zionism's early years. Just as interesting is what these materials reveal about the relationship between Nathan Birnbaum and the man widely regarded as the true hero of Zionism, Theodor Herzl. A great deal has been made?much of it by Herzl himself and subsequent historiography indebted to Herzl's famous diary?of Birn baum's supposed abandonment of Zionism during the early 1890s, before Herzl published Der Judenstaat. But in reality, little of Birnbaum's thought was heretical among the varieties of early Jewish nationalist and Zionist ideology. Indeed, many of his ideas would ultimately find a place, in one form or another, in the wider Zionist movement in the ensuing years. There was little to distinguish Birnbaum's 245</page><page sequence="6">Jess Olson position from what would come to be termed the "cultural" Zionism of Ahad Ha'am and the Democratic Faction, a fact that was widely acknowledged by Birn baum's associates and sympathizers.13 Much more important in Birnbaum's departure from the movement was the poisonous relationship that developed between him and Herzl. When combined with Birnbaum's evolving thought about the meaning of Jewish nationalism, this relationship fundamentally shaped the crucial choice he made between Herzl's arrival at a Zionist worldview in 1896 and his own formal departure from the Zionist movement in 1899.14 Understanding this transitional period and its role in the early theoretical and strategic direction of the Zionist movement is crucial. It shows, first, the varieties of thought about key issues that were present in Zionism on the eve of its major moment of coalescence. Though Birnbaum would be perhaps the first victim of the concretization of Zionism's aims and ideology, his approach to Jewish nation alist theory?and his confrontation with Herzl?would prefigure an essential conflict that would reemerge famously during the Sixth Zionist Conference. Furthermore, Birnbaum's unique perspective and experience as an early leader in central European Jewish nationalism is the cornerstone of a much more compre hensive r??valuation of Birnbaum's full life of ideas. "He Was the First": Birnbaum and Zionism before Herzl At the end of the 1880s, Nathan Birnbaum's leadership position among Viennese Jewish nationalists seemed unassailable. His credentials were sterling. As a seventeen-year-old, with fellow Vienna University students Reuben Bierer and Moritz Schnirer, Birnbaum played the enfant terrible in the trio's taboo breaking nationalist club.15 This informal group, with the addition of a few 13. This fact is born out by several articles Birnbaum wrote around 1902-3 during the so-called Ahad Ha'am affair, a particularly vitriolic Zionist family fight. After the 1902 publication of Herzl's novel Altneuland, Ahad Ha'am wrote a biting criticism of Herzl and his ideas about Zionism. Although Ahad Ha'am had long been a critic of Herzl, this particular instance prompted Max Nordau, possibly with the tacit approval of Herzl, to launch an excessively personal and bitter attack on Ahad Ha'am. This attack, against a man who was seen as an almost prophetic figure in Jewish nationalism, led, in turn, to a public outcry against Nordau and Herzl, including an open letter by Martin Buber and another by Birnbaum. Over the next several months, Birnbaum dedicated detailed thought to the meaning of Ahad Ha'am's Zionist legacy, and its harmonization with his own thought. See Achad Ha-am: Ein Denker und K?mpfer der j?dischen Renaissance (Berlin: J?discher Verlag, 1903); and "Die j?dische Bewegung," Der Weg (August 20, 1903). 14. It is Robert Wistrich's chapter, "The Metamorphoses of Nathan Birnbaum," more than any other secondary source, that charts the interplay between Birnbaum's ideology and his relationship with Herzl in his turn from Zionism. However perceptive this article is, however, it ascribes a great deal more to the "socialist" elements of Birnbaum's thought (Herzl's own not credible description of Birnbaum in his diary) in the early 1890s than is warranted; likewise, as with most other historiography on Birnbaum, it does not contain any reference to or account for the materials available in the Birnbaum archive, in particular the Herzl-Birnbaum correspondence. 15. See Moritz Schnirer's account of the founding of Kadimah in Festschrift zur Feier des 100 Semesters des akademischen Verbindung Kadimah (Vienna, 1933). He describes Birnbaum as an "exceptionally intelligent, earnest young man filled with a glowing love for Judaism" (15-18). 246</page><page sequence="7">The Late Zionism of Nathan Birnbaum more sympathizers and the galvanizing presence of Peretz Smolenskin, quickly incorporated as Kadimah, the first Jewish nationalist student society in central Europe. From there, Birnbaum's stature continued to grow as the main presence behind the newspaper Selbst-Emancipation, the public voice of nascent Jewish nationalism in Vienna. His work for the cause of proto-Zionism was tireless; upon earning his law degree, he soon abandoned legal practice to devote all his time and energy to the newspaper and to the promotion of Jewish nationalism.16 Birnbaum's influence did not end at the boundaries of Vienna. Through his writing and frequent journeys and wide correspondences throughout central Europe, he was connected to and revered by young nationalists from Sophia to Lvov to Berlin.17 It was to Birnbaum that western Zionists turned to assess the importance of a new Zionist journal out of Odessa, Ahad Ha'am's Ha-shiloah, and it was to Birnbaum that the editor himself turned for contributions to its pages.18 When, two decades later, the young Zionists of Prague convened to form the Bar Kokhba society, it was to Birnbaum, by then long departed from the Zionist scene, that they looked for inspiration.19 In dozens of essays written over the course of the 1880s and 1890s, Birn baum sketched his view of the philosophical foundations of Jewish nationalism, joining his two biggest influences, Peretz Smolenskin and Leon Pinsker. Birn baum had imbibed from a young age Pinsker's profound despair at what he saw as an incurable strain of antisemitism in European culture.20 Pinsker's views that Jews were inassimilable into European culture, not because of their own fail ings but because of the malady of Jew hatred, and that the only possibility for the survival of the Jewish people was to abandon Europe and create a Jewish state 16. Nathan Birnbaum, "Gegen die Selbstverst?ndlichkeit," in Festschrift zur Feier des 100, 28-30. 17. This was aided in no small part by the confluence of personalities that Birnbaum encoun tered in his first months of matriculation to Vienna University. Both Bierer and Schnirer arrived in Vienna with respectable r?sum?s of involvement with the Hovevei Zion. Schnirer, upon completing his medical education in Vienna, practiced medicine in Sophia, Bulgaria, and was a leading figure in the Hovevei Zion there. 18. See Nathan Birnbaum's review of the inaugural issue of Ha-shiloah in Zion, his contri butions to its pages, and the translation of his article "Kulturk?mpfe im alten Israel," 1896. 19. See Hillel Kieval, The Making of Czech Jewry (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988), 101, for a description of the role of Birnbaum and his early Zionist colleagues on the Prague Bar Kokhba. Both Hugo Bergmann and Martin Buber were more than casual acquaintances of Birnbaum's; both corresponded with him, with Buber's correspondence numbering several letters. 20. The influence of Pinsker on Birnbaum and the other Kadimah founders was profound, and indeed it was their adulation and propagation of the ideas in Pinsker's seminal Autoemancipation that formed the core of early Jewish nationalism in Vienna. Pinsker's influence on Birnbaum is hard to over emphasize. Although Birnbaum would point to a national consciousness that started during his days in the Gymnasium, it is clear that the appearance o? Autoemancipation at almost precisely the moment when Birnbaum entered Vienna University had a major impact on his embrace of Jewish nationalism (see Nathan Birnbaum, "Gegen der Selbstverst?ndlichkeit," 28-29). Indeed, his first anonymously pub lished essay, "Die Assimilationssucht," is deeply indebted in tone and content to Pinsker's essay of a year earlier. And of course, the name of the official organ of Kadimah, Selbst-Emancipation, was an explicit homage to Pinsker. 247</page><page sequence="8">Jess Olson struck a deep chord with Birnbaum. His youthful interaction with the Hebrew writer Smolenskin, one of the central early figures in the revival of Hebrew as a modern literary language, led Birnbaum to embrace the idea of the Hebrew language as the centerpiece for the regeneration of Jewish culture.21 Aside from the need for physical salvation through nationalism and statehood, in Birnbaum's view and in the views of the other Kadimah members, the Jewish nation had experienced a dangerous cultural decline and desperately needed to rediscover the vibrancy and dynamism of its unique history and culture. Having lost a living tie to an "authentic" culture over the long Diaspora, whether they had aban doned it willingly for the salon or the baptismal font or had blindly surrendered it to the meek defeatism of ossified religious dogma, the Jews as a nation were in deep crisis, their future in question. According to Birnbaum's early writings in Selbst-Emancipation and Seru babel between the years 1884 and 1892, the goal of Jewish nationalism was not just to establish a land for Jewish refuge but also to restore a lost culture. It would not resemble the integration-oriented western European Jewish society nor the pre-Enlightenment Jewish communal structure but instead a new, largely imagined national identity of preexilic Israel. Hebrew would be the national language of the Jews, replete with its own rich literature and artistic production.22 Jews would once again live in and cultivate the land of Israel, observe as national holidays (not, it is important to note, as particularly religious ones) the festivals of the Jewish calendar, and erect a civic, reasoned religion in place of the dusty reli gious formalism of the Diaspora.23 Importantly, it was the activity of educating the Jewish people in exile, of bringing to them not only the knowledge of history, language, and culture but especially the requisite political consciousness needed to create a Jewish nation state, that was as important as?if not more important than?seeking a means of establishing an actual state. It was not that Birnbaum was uninterested in pursuing statehood, but if actual statehood for the Jewish 21. Peretz Smolenskin was a catalyzing figure not only in Birnbaum's early nationalist awaken ing but also in the formation of the Kadimah movement itself. Both Birnbaum's and Schnirer's recollec tions of the founding meeting of Kadimah in 1883 record the presence of Smolenskin as an honored guest. Both also agree that it was Smolenskin who, after vigorous debate among the young nationalists, proposed the name "Kadimah" for the student group, which all accepted. See Nathan Birnbaum, "Gegen der Selbstverst?ndlichkeit"; and Moritz Schnirer, "Gr?ndung der Kadimah: Nach Mitteilungen des Ehrenburschen, Medizinalrates Dr. M. T. Schnirer, Wien," in Festschrift zur Feier des 100. 22. Testimony to the commitment of Birnbaum and other members of Kadimah to master of Hebrew is a small grammar, compiled by Birnbaum and another member of Kadimah, to instruct other members of the society in the rudiments of the language. This document is preserved in the Birn baum family archive. 23. Birnbaum's most comprehensive and organized single essay on these ideas is the lengthy 1893 pamphlet Die nationale Wiedergeburt des j?dischen Volkes in seinem Land, als Mittel zur L?sung der Judenfrage, which, like Leo Pinsker's Auto-emancipation, was a central reference point for early Zionists. It was also, interestingly, this pamphlet that Birnbaum enclosed with his first letter to Theodor Herzl in 1896. Interestingly, Birnbaum added a noteworthy caveat in the note to Herzl attached to the essay?that he no longer believed in a number of the principals it laid out. See the February 24, 1896, letter from Birnbaum to Herzl. 248</page><page sequence="9">The Late Zionism of Nathan Birnbaum people in Palestine was never displaced as an ultimate goal, it was nevertheless the more distant one. By the middle of the 1890s, however, Birnbaum's ideas were undergoing an increasingly pronounced evolution. His youthful days as an enthusiastic Zionist and his largely uncritical belief in the Utopian vision of the rebirth of Hebraist culture and secular nationalism gave way to a more jaded, mechanistic view. More and more, Birnbaum began to distrust what he referred to as "adolescent" ideals, in particular that of the Zionist identity as a panacea for solving both the existential struggles of identity faced by European Jews and their material struggles.24 Instead, Birnbaum began to conceive of the Jewish situation in Europe through a new theoretical kaleidoscope that encompassed elements of mechanistic socialist determinism, racialist theory, and pragmatism. Moving away from the familiar early cultural Zionist dream of monolithically recreating the Jewish nation as if writing on a blank slate, he started to conceive of the choices facing the Jewish nation as far more complex, requiring more nuanced and differentiated solutions. Even as he articulated the ideas that for decades to come would inspire many to envision a Hebraized Zionist nation state in Palestine, the maturing Birnbaum began to deemphasize some of the pillars of a Zionist worldview. Particularly in the period between 1892 and 1896, Birnbaum's thought diverged from the path of Hebrew culture, antisemitism, and statehood. Most pronounced was his shift in focus from the demands for statehood and cultural revival to the more day to-day plight of the Jewish population throughout Europe. The steady increase in violence against Jews, from the anti-Jewish riots of the early 1880s, to the periodic emergence of blood libel accusations even in Vienna's own backyard of the Czech lands (the Leopold Hilsner case of 1899), to the success of antis? mites such as Karl Lueger in Viennese politics, convinced Birnbaum that Jews had to act as quickly as possible to create a broad and vital national identity and use that awareness to act decisively for their interests in the Diaspora. Thus, although he continued his activities in the Zionist movement, Birn baum's opinion of "what was to be done" to relieve the struggles of European Jewry began to diverge from the coalescing Zionist line. As time went on, Birn baum became preoccupied with exploring the meaning and implications of Jewish nationhood. He mused about the creation of a new type of nationalist party identity, a "Jewish People's Party" {J?dische Volkspartei), which he defined as a more pragmatic, ecumenical approach to Jewish politics based on a common perception of Jewish national "being" rather than a particular political doctrine.25 Although these interests were not, in his view, equal to abandoning Zionism?in fact, he saw them as the logical next step in its evolution?they did cause some to question his commitment to the movement.26 24.

Though there is little direct evidence of statements publicly questioning Birnbaum's com mitment to Zionism, Herzl's comment in the diary entry that followed their first meeting, that Birnbaum 249</page><page sequence="10">Jess Olson Ultimately, historical contingency and Birnbaum's own choices did not allow this "People's Party" model of Zionism, nor Birnbaum's other evolving con cepts of Jewish nationalism within a Zionist framework, to mature.27 The arrival of Herzl precluded this; he had little use for Birnbaum's theorizing. For a brief time, between the summers of 1896 and 1899, Birnbaum tried to work within the frame work Herzl had set forth, for a number of reasons. He recognized Herzl's over whelming momentum and popularity and realized that he could not easily counter it. Additionally, he genuinely seemed to view Herzl's movement as a viable means to reach his own nationalist goals, if he could gain a position of influ ence over the new movement and Herzl himself. But at the same time he was having his first meetings with Herzl in the spring of 1896, Birnbaum was actively developing a detailed, theoretical con ception of Jewish nationalism starkly different from his positions years before. In a series of essays, the most important a lengthy pamphlet titled Die j?dische Moderne, Birnbaum described a completely different understanding of the meaning of Jewish nationalism, both as an ideology and as it could be practically applied to the European Jewish condition. Written at almost exactly the same time as Herzl's much more famous pamphlet, Der Judenstaat, Die j?dische Moderne offers a fascinating alternative to Herzl's perspective. It is not really a "road not taken"; like many of Birnbaum's ideas, it reflects a growing trend in much Jewish nationalist thought, both then and after. Yet it is very much a contrast to Herzl's well-known conception of national ism as laid out in Judenstaat, and as such, it provides valuable insights into the ultimate seeds of dispute between the two nationalists. Die j?dische Moderne originated in a speech delivered to the Kadimah society in early 1896, around the time Birnbaum was becoming acquainted with Herzl. Published under the pseudonym Mathias Acher, the essay is partly historical presentation, part philosophical argument, and part statement of policy and political action for the future of Jewish nationalism.28 Many of its points are restatements of positions that Birnbaum had long held: the failure of Jewish assimilation, its reasons, and repercussions, and the necessity of Jewish national autonomy in some form, preferably in a Jewish state, although Palestine is not specifically mentioned in the article. Likewise present is "had already left Zionism and gone over to Socialism," implies that such rumors were circulating. See Herzl's diary entry for March 1, 1896. 27. Or at least not to mature on Birnbaum's watch. There is a great deal in common with the way in which Jews approached Zionism?particularly the "General Zionist" platform of Yitzkhok Gr?nbaum?in the elections of the interwar Polish Sejm. See Ezra Mendelsohn, Zionism in Poland: The Formative Years, 1915-1926 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1981), 74-75. 28. The pseudonym "Mattias Acher," Birnbaum's most famous pen name (as demonstrated by Berthold Feiwel's comments), was coined in 1895 in an article titled "Die j?ngste politische Partei Galiciens" {Die Zeit, 1895). So popular was the persona that it became almost interchangeable within Jewish nationalist circles with Birnbaum's given name; in many instances, Birnbaum's lectures were announced under this name. 250</page><page sequence="11">The Late Zionism of Nathan Birnbaum persistent anti-elitism, his oft-repeated castigation of Viennese and western Jewish leadership for their commitment to bankrupt assimilation and liberalism. New, however, at least in such a systematic form, is a sharp critique of Jewish nationalists, especially Zionists. It is this criticism?really a sustained reconsi deration of the roots and meaning of Jewish nationalism?that is the heart of the essay, not the tired castigation of the assimilationist establishment. It is what makes the essay a crucial gauge in the transformation of Birnbaum's ideol ogy over the mid-1890s. The essay starts with a litany familiar to any reader of Selbst-Emancipation or J?dische Volkszeitung detailing the misguided mentality of the assimilationist Jew?but with some subtle differences. To begin with, Birnbaum defines the nature of the assimilationists' error as a fundamental misreading, or even ignor ance, of history. They seem unaware of the sorry results of the numerous historical attempts at assimilation. "What the present theory of assimilation is concerned with is well known in Jewish history's succession of aborted searches for assim ilation. These movements all incline to the same general result: the people as a whole remain unscathed, and the movements themselves come to their own destruction."29 All that differs between the German, French, Hungarian efforts and the assimilationist movements of antiquity?those of the Persia, Greece, and Babylonia?are the particulars. Had the modern assimilationists been sensitive to history, they would have realized that the type of assimilation they sought and that demanded by the host society were completely at odds. Birnbaum does not deny that Jews succeeded in a form of assimilation. It was, unfortunately, the wrong kind. "If we compare these so-called assimilated Jews with their surroundings, we find that their perspectives and their attitudes are circumscribed within a fam iliar set of ideas and notions, which are shared in common with all European people of culture; however, when it comes to the specifics of national unique ness, it is completely deficient."30 Jews failed to understand that their notion of assimilation into European society?which was really the creation of a new cos mopolitanism?was as alien to a national sensibility as their abandoned faith. What the German, Frenchman, Czech, or Hungarian desired was not some kind of strange "European" Jew but a fellow German, Frenchman, Czech, or Hungarian. It is with this detail that Birnbaum pivots to the most novel idea in the essay, nothing less than a full-blown theory of history based on the concept, in Birn baum's terms, of "racial materialism." This term, with its obvious (and conscious) Marxist overtones, would become the foundation for much of Birnbaum's think ing about race and nationalism. Like many, Birnbaum found the basis of Marx's theory of dialectical materialism, particularly its eradication of external, transcen dent forces from their theoretical position as the engines of history?in other words, the turn to materialism?a fundamentally compelling position, and from 29.

Ibid., 4. 251</page><page sequence="12">Jess Olson a young age.31 But as moving as the Marxist d?mystification of history was, Birn baum believed that Marx, Engels, and their followers?particularly the mechanist and quietist Social Democrats?had erred in identifying the engine of history as economics and class conflict. In fact, Birnbaum suggests, not without some irony, that this misguided focus on economics?a singularly Jewish obsession when thinking about the situation of the Jewish people?was something that Marx, his followers, and the Jewish assimilationist haute bourgeoisie shared. "Why, exactly, should the economic structure of society?itself an abstraction? be accorded the honor of being figured as the stuff of history? The stuff of human history can only be humanity itself"32 Economics, Birnbaum argues, is merely an intellectual abstraction that masks the essential motivating force of historical change, humanity itself, and the one unique and natural drive central to human existence, racial unity. "The historical event comes to being through human nature, decidedly in part from the racial-unity {Gattungseinheit), in part from the differentiation of man. From these flows the economic, from these the racial- and national history. Both are manifold in one another, and their common work is history."33 As insightful as the basic Marxist critique of the transcendent and the embrace of materialism was, it had missed the mark, a mistake continued and compounded by "everyday historical materialism."34 Though not an extra ordinarily insightful critique of Marxism, Birnbaum's point nevertheless offers an interesting twist. In his analysis, it is the nation that dictates the develop ment of human history?or rather, its elemental component, race. "The firm foundation of nationality is always and above all race, as well as its means of development and refinement; it is through racial culture that nationality [develops]."35 Race is thus the crucial determining factor in the development of human history. This explosive assertion requires pause, particularly because of the per nicious use to which such conceptualizations have been put and because of Birnbaum's close proximity?late nineteenth-century Vienna?to many of the most controversial racialists. Although Birnbaum's focused discussion of race is unusual in its placement at the center of a major political-philosophical system (as Birnbaum clearly intended Die j?dische Moderne to detail), most nationalist thought at this time and place?the heyday of nationalist theory, not just in the multinational Austro-Hungarian Empire but also in much of European and American thought?had at its core racial or naturalistically ethnic overtones. Birnbaum, in fact, was remarkably sensitive to the racialist implications of nationalism. He took great pains to distance himself from the likes of Chamberlain 31. See Birnbaum's discussion of his youthful intellectual development in his pamphlet Von Freigeist zum Gl?ubigen (Zurich: Verlag Artzenu, 1919). 32. Die j?dische Moderne, 10. 33. Ibid., 10. 34.

That he would focus on these two in particular is not surprising, given their sensational presence in Viennese public debate. Chamberlain, later renowned for his marriage to Eva Wagner and for his place in Hitler's pantheon of antisemitic forbears, was at this time at work on his antisemitic epic Origins of the Nineteenth Century. Weininger, a young and prolix eccentric, was also present, at work on his immensely popular masterpiece of misogyny and antisemitism, Geschlecht und Character (Sex and Character), which he would publish just before his suicide in 1903. Regardless of any superficial resonance with these confirmed racists, Birn baum's conception of race is decidedly benign. Though he views it as the deter mining factor in human differentiation, and one that individuals have little power to change, he never describes it in the biological terms of his contempor aries. Nor does he seek to bring in the other key component of nineteenth century racialism: quasi Darwinism. To Birnbaum, national?that is, racial? culture is not a competitive advantage bestowed by nature on one group and not another, as the racial Darwinists believed. Their position, which Birnbaum calls "chauvinism," is false and ludicrous, its presence a danger to all: From this comes national awareness as it is usually understood in Europe, and with it all the sins that have been committed [in its name] in this empire ... [But] between the recognition of these historical factors and chauvinism lays a wide chasm. Chauvinism has no scientific basis.37 Birnbaum's nationalism, as opposed to chauvinism, is not necessarily malig nant. Rather, it is the key ingredient of human social adaptation and survival. Jews, as with all other peoples, achieve their full sense of historical being through their national?that is, racial?existence. However, nationalism, as a social mechanism, does have a dark side. Like all group impulses, it has an affi nity to engage with that which is similar to it and to reject that which differs as a threat to its hegemony. The Jewish people in exile, in denying and resisting their natural, national impulse, exhibited social behaviors that were terminally different to national being. Thus, in failing to embrace their being as a nation, the Jews brought upon themselves the hatred and destructive fury of other nations. Although a dire situation, for Birnbaum, this realization is cause for opti mism. It is, as Pinsker had asserted years before, a natural, rational problem, and thus has a solution. "I do not believe in an eternal national hatred myself, at least not in terms of racial culture."38 It is only because of the peculiar situation of the Jews in Europe, the rise of European nationalism, which tended to turn on Jews as an obvious target, 36. See "Ueber Houston Stewart Chamberlain," Die Welt (November 22 and 29, 1901); "Etwas ?ber Houston Stewart Chamberlain," Ost und West (December 1902); and "Weininger und das Judenthum," J?dische Volksblatt (January 27, February 24, and March 24, 1905). 37.

Ibid., 14. 253</page><page sequence="14">Jess Olson where Jews have been found, they have been found in too great a number to be left alone in the crowd, and too small a number to command respect ... This powerlessness is the foundation of the inevitability of the national fric tion between Jews and non-Jews, and lends Jew hatred its particular 39 potency. Birnbaum believed that the solution to this problem had already shown itself to be the unapologetic embrace by the Jewish people of their national destiny and iden tity. By realizing their nationhood, the Jews would both elevate the self-esteem of the Jewish people, allowing them to realize their true historical destiny and being on the world stage, and relegate to history the persecution of Jews as powerless and nationless. "The Jews possess at this moment all which would be required of a state in order to be able to come to being and to succeed; they have a unified nation, they have at their disposal a full measure of physical, economic and spiritual power, they possess now more as well in the political sense than they have before."40 Whether Birnbaum's musings on race and national destiny were novel to his readers, what was new and, indeed, shocking to his past Zionist readers was where he went from there. It was the strengthening of the nation and its character, its sense of esteem and self-knowledge, that was the key project of the Zionist and the Jewish nationalist, not the immediate creation of a homeland. "[Jewish national being does not] depend on the land. The reclamation of the land itself is rela tively easy, one might even say an automatic undertaking, whether it is fulfilled now with economic weapons, or, as in our case, with our own modem weapons of spirit and capital."41 This is Birnbaum's most important early statement on his turn from an "orthodox" Zionist position. Birnbaum is quite conscious of this and takes his critique to its logical end: a foundational questioning of the goals of Jewish nationalism. Logically, this leads Birnbaum to rum to Jewish national organizations themselves. For a little over a decade, Birnbaum observes, there had been in exist ence more or less organized groups that understood the necessity of a Jewish national awakening, known as "Zionists" or "Jewish nationalists." Over time, the two terms had (mistakenly) become synonymous. However, drawing a sharp distinction between "Zionism" and "Jewish nationalism," Birnbaum turns on Zionism. The movement was, as a whole (and, he acknowledges, attributable in no small part to his own writings), a romantic ideology, a misdirected attempt to resolve the Jewish question that, although based on a sound foundation, had focused on the wrong structure. Obsessed with the need to establish a homeland, paramount to any other priority, the Zionists erroneously assumed that the exist ence of a Jewish state alone would solve the Jewish problem. They had made the error, going back to Birnbaum's critique of Marxist materialism, in siding with Engels in the belief that only status as "masters of their own house" would 39. Ibid., 15. 40. Ibid., 36. 41. Ibid., 36. 254</page><page sequence="15">The Late Zionism of Nathan Birnbaum liberate them from their troubled history. They had, as a result, committed the same error as the Marxists and removed the human center from their consideration of the material of history, turning the land itself, and the quest for a state, as an idol. Like all other idols, however, it would prove to be empty.43 Rather than focus on land and its acquisition, it was the duty of the Jewish nationalists to strengthen the nation and let the land take care of itself. One of the most serious threats to this aim, Birnbaum argues, was the subjugation of Jewish nationalism?particularly Zionism and its striving for the creation of a Jewish national being?to party politics. The descent into party politics would be a strong temptation for the Jewish nationalists. After all, "The German nationalists are a party, the irredentists are a party, why shouldn't the Jewish nationalists also be a party? Why not? Because [the Jewish nation] departs from every assumption of a party."44 Entrance into the political fray by true Jewish nationalists would merely undermine the creation of an integral national being in exchange for the very chauvinism and jingoism that had tortured the Jewish people for so long.45 Furthermore, to create a Jewish national party would be to create an artificial unit with no meaning in the context of Jewish national being: "Nationality is so reflexive an aspect of the people, that it makes no sense to have a movement, in which this obvious state of affairs is made explicit."46 It was at precisely the turning point of Zionism from a parochial, rarified movement of idealists into a true mass movement that Birnbaum was writing along these lines. It was, in a sense, a latent tendency, the suppressed id of Jewish nationalism that craved to answer antisemitic nationalist chauvinism in kind, that Birnbaum warned against. Written, as it was, at the same time as Herzl's Judenstaat, it is possible that Birnbaum aimed part of the pamphlet at the greatest enabler of this very attitude, none other than Herzl himself. In any case, the point that Birnbaum leaves with in Die j?dische Moderne is a warning about the dangers political engagement held for the purity of the Jewish national cause, and he gives a strong indication that he saw things quite differently from Theodor Herzl. In retrospect, it is likely that he would not have lasted in any case in the large-scale, mass Zionist movement, especially as envisioned by Herzl. As it was, he did not have to wait long to find out. "I Had the Misfortune to Recognize the Truth of Zionism": Birnbaum and Herzl The year 1896 fundamentally disrupted the parochial and closed world of Jewish nationalism. Where once it had been possible for the early Zionists, writing their own journals and debating arcane points of Zionist theory, to 42. Ibid., 21. 43. Ibid., 23. 44. Ibid., 26. 45. Ibid., 26. 46. Ibid., 30. 255</page><page sequence="16">Jess Olson gamer enough support among the few Jewish nationalists to float a number of different ideas, the publication of Theodor Herzl's Der Judenstaat ended this. To the Zionists, Herzl appeared out of nowhere. Although all probably knew of him through the columns he wrote as one of most gifted feuilletonists in the Neue Freie Presse, then perhaps the most respected paper in the German language, he had never shown, at least publicly, the slightest interest in the obscure world of Jewish nationalism. After his pamphlet appeared, however, this did not matter. With shocking suddenness and complete indifference to?and usually ignorance of?the preexisting world of Jewish nationalism, its hierarchies and squabbles, Herzl appeared, asserted his ownership of the movement, began his crusade of diplomacy with world leaders, and organized the First Zionist Congress?all in the sixteen months between February 1896 and August 1897. The sheer velocity with which he transformed the Zionist scene, totally reconstructing the fifteen year-old movement in his image and to suit his vision, left the old Zionist guard reeling. Very quickly after Herzl's appearance, an ultimatum emerged that con fronted all those who had preceded him, including Birnbaum: Either join with his movement?a movement whose accomplishments seemed, on their face (and thanks in no small part to Herzl's genius for self-presentation), to dwarf in a year what the staid Zionist societies had done in ten?or fall by the wayside. Herzl made this choice clear as he succeeded in recasting the entire movement. For the small cadre of leaders, such as Birnbaum, who had felt unconstrained in shaping the ideals of the movement, there was uncertainty as to how to cope with the sudden challenge. The roots of conflict between Herzl and Birnbaum began early in their relationship?in fact, even before they had met. But despite the rancor that would eventually sabotage any possibility of the two working on a common cause, what is immediately most noticeable about the two men are their many similarities.47 Both were the children of migrants to the large urban centers of the Austro-Hungarian Empire?Herzl's father Jakob to Budapest and the Birn baums to Vienna. They had almost identical educations (the Gymnasium, the gateway to an elite university education), and both were law students and received their degrees from Vienna University (Herzl completed his in 1884, the same year in which the young law student Birnbaum and his colleagues formed Kadimah). Both made their livings primarily through their talents with the written word: Herzl was more widely familiar to a popular audience through his feuilletons in 47. Indeed, they even looked remarkably similar. This is underscored by a letter from much later in Birnbaum's life, sent to him by Tuvia Horowitz, a young hasid and member of the Vizhnitzer Rebbe's (R. Yisroel Hagar) household, with whom Birnbaum carried on a lengthy correspondence after his turn to Orthodoxy. In the letter, Horowitz describes his persecution by other hasidim in his community because of his suspicious correspondence with a "western doctor." So serious were their charges, he writes, that he was forced to defend himself in front of his uncle and justify his errant act. His crime was twofold: He had corrupted the youth of the community by teaching women Hebrew grammar and Jewish history, and he "had a picture of a Jewish doctor who goes about bareheaded, which seems to be a picture of Dr. Herzl (he meant your picture)." 256</page><page sequence="17">The Late Zionism of Nathan Birnbaum the Neue Freie Presse, whereas Birnbaum was more narrowly familiar to the readers of both his self-edited papers and journals and his publications in other sources. Both even aspired to accomplishment in the belles lettres as playwrights and poets. But their similar occupations, educations, and backgrounds belied some deeper differences. Herzl's father had turned his business prowess into an Alger esque rise to become the head of a major Budapest banking firm and married into the Budapest Jewish elite; Birnbaum's mother and father had remained two among the marginal lower-middle-class Jewish masses that flooded Vienna from throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire during the mid-nineteenth century. While too much could be made of these social distinctions, the inter actions between the two men show an awareness of their relative status at play. Herzl was a wealthy, well-dressed, and well-connected journalist with an aristo cratic detachment so prized in Viennese society. He was clearly disdainful of the poorer, straight-spoken, and marginal Birnbaum, who made no secret of his des perate financial circumstances or his belief that he was entitled to far more than he had received. It has been speculated that this social difference was a key element in the conflict between the two men. But despite all, the two had remarkably similar backgrounds, and it was the similarities in their experiences and their tempera ments that made both men Zionists while, at the same time, forming the basis of their alienation and mutual dislike.48 Both were products o? fin-de-si?cle Vienna, and they experienced acutely the alienation produced by the deflation of the liberal promise?and, it seemed, liberalism itself?as such individuals as Karl Lueger and Georg Ritter von Sch?nerer succeeded in building entire political careers on platforms of antisemitism.49 They both experienced the frustrations and anxiety of living as Jews in Vienna, the neurotic city described so aptly by authors such as Arthur Schnitzler, Robert Musil, and Karl Kraus. They also shared certain personality traits that made cooperation difficult. Both felt they had earned propriety over Zionism; both had vaulting ambition in their desire to best serve their people; and neither could tolerate much dissention or criticism from others. Birnbaum, for his part, was deeply resentful of Herzl's ease in totally dominating the Jewish national movement, thanklessly disregarding all those on whose shoulders he (for the most part unknowingly) stood. Herzl, despite his practiced indifference to the air of dilettantism that he could not, to some, ever efface, resented the condescension to which he was subject from the old Zionist guard, including Birnbaum. Add to this the general organizational strife present in any political movement, and especially in those as revolutionary 48.

Schorske, "Politics in a New Key," in Fin-de-Si?cle Vienna: Politics and Culture (New York: Vintage Press, 1981). Although focusing exclusively on Herzl in the context of Viennese Jewish nationalism, much of his discussion of the tenor of nationalist politics sheds light on Birnbaum's political career as well. 257</page><page sequence="18">Jess Olson in nature as Zionism, and the pattern of petty concerns and frequent misunder standings, and it is no surprise that the two would be unable to share the same rostrum for very long. Regardless of their similarities and differences, they were not personally acquainted before February 1896. Birnbaum probably knew of Herzl either through his work in the Neue Freie Presse or because of his keen interest in the theater, but Herzl made it clear that he had never heard of Birnbaum. This changed with the publication of Der Judenstaat in February 1896. The booklet, as Ernst Pawel records, was first revealed in a summary in the Jewish Chronicle on January 17. The summary was translated into German and printed in Oesterrei chische Wochenschrift in mid-February, and the pamphlet was finally released in book form around February 14. Reaction to the pamphlet in Vienna was "swift and sardonic."50 Among the notices was a review published on February 22 in Die Zeit by Nathan Birnbaum. This article marked Birnbaum's first discussion of Herzl in print, and thus it is a useful indicator of his early views. Despite a tone of condescension that underscores Birnbaum's review, he took Der Judenstaat seriously?much more so than either the elite mainstream press (including the chagrined editors of Neue Freie Presse) or much of the Zionist and Jewish press.51 In his opening, Birnbaum notes that Herzl's work is already "interesting," in that [T]he author calls himself a "Zionist" in the most resolute meaning of the young word. This alone would justify the general interest [it has received]. Zionism is [now] taken to be a modern movement. Now, if an adequate cri terion to consider a movement modern is the re-consideration of an old ques tion under a new perspective, and [finding in it] an initiative with substance, an indisputably grand goal, and [relevant to] the spirit of the times, then surely Zionism is such a movement.52 Though there is certainly a patronizing air in these words, Birnbaum nevertheless welcomes Herzl to his part in the development of the movement?albeit more as a barometer of the movement's maturation than its agent. But some of Herzl's com ments, particularly those dismissive of the previous efforts of Zionists, he finds much more troublesome. As the essay continues, Birnbaum's tone becomes far more critical, even, in Pawel 's language, sardonic: An even more original step here for us [is] his proposal for realizing the Zionist ideas. Up to now, Zionists proceeded either under the cloak of their latest goal towards the "false principle of the gradual infiltration of Jews," without regarding [the fact] that "normalization [of immigration] leads to a 50.

Or, it leads to a national-political, and under certain conditions also a national-religious campaign, [shaped] first and foremost around bringing the Zionist ideal to the people, or a combination of both methods. What however, such a Zionist?aware, for the most part, of his general lack of influence?hazards delicately with gentle suggestion, Dr. Herzl has the courage and the candor to speak forth clearly and simply. "Immigration has only then one meaning, if it is the foundation of our certain sovereignty." And he unravels around this foundation of the Jewish state a plan.53 As he delves into Herzl's concrete proposals, Birnbaum is unenthusiastic. He devotes a substantial part of the article to detailing Herzl's program as laid out in Der Judenstaat, giving a summary of the functions of the Jewish company, the society of the Jews, and the various plans for a scientifically based, social utopia under the leadership of the best and purest of the Jewish people. In the end, however, Birnbaum hones in on Herzl's words that he finds most outrageous, for they touch on the subject closest to his heart: the issue of Jewish cultural regen eration, which Herzl summarily dismisses. "Then, it will ... appear," Birnbaum writes, [I]f Dr. Herzl's opinion on the matter: "this return-to-old culture stuff, which many Zionists want, is foolish," and "we are a modern people, and want to be the most modern"?to which outside of some of his detailed proposals stand in direct contradiction?has any hope of vindication. Much will depend upon the establishment of the "Society of Jews", which Dr. Herzl is prepared to convene in London. In any case, the author of Judenstaat is entitled to take credit [for the fact] that the Zionist movement is to be dissuaded indirectly from a national day-to-day politics, to which it must always be left to react. No modern-thinking person can be unsympathetic to a true new people's party, upon which will be established a new state of modern life.54 The strained comments on Herzl's opinion of the "return-to-old culture stuff would not have been lost on those acquainted with Birnbaum's writing. This facile dismissal by a man entirely uninitiated in the Zionist world of Birnbaum's life's work and his most deeply held opinions clearly offended him. Although Herzl professed not to know Birnbaum, he could not have picked a better way to provoke him. But Birnbaum did not rush to attack or polemicize against Herzl?reflecting how little Birnbaum considered him a threat?but rather took it upon himself to educate him. In the opening to the correspondence between the two men, Birn baum thanks Herzl for the copy of Der Judenstaat that he had sent (seemingly after Birnbaum's review was published!) and responds by sending him one of his own pamphlets, Die nationale Wiedergeburt des j?dischen Volk in seinem 53. Ibid. 54. Ibid. 259</page><page sequence="20">Jess Olson Land (The National Rebirth of the Jewish People in Their Own Land). That the pamphlet was intended as a primer for Herzl is suggested by the note accompany ing it, which states, "the author today has an entirely different worldview, and thus he is no longer able to endorse the entire contents of his writing. In any case, he remains, so far as his goals are concerned, a Zionist with his whole heart."55 In other words, Birnbaum was more interested in tutoring Herzl than speaking to him as an equal. Birnbaum's enticing comment, one of the most explicit indi cations of his changing opinions vis-?-vis Zionism, nevertheless indicates his feeling that Herzl needed some introduction to the thought he had disparaged in Judenstaat, starting with his own work. However presumptuous, or even patronizing, his intentions were, that Birn baum seemed willing both to engage in a dialogue with Herzl, as well as provide him with some guidance in negotiating the labyrinth of Jewish politics, shows that he saw potential in Herzl as a force in Zionism. Even if he was only a useful measure of the presence that Jewish nationalism had in the minds of Viennese lay people, Herzl had a public presence few Zionists had; most of them, like Birn baum, existed publicly only insofar as they were known among other Jewish nationalists. At any rate, his tone?particularly the need he felt to underscore his continued commitment to Zionism?indicates that he took Herzl's interest in Zionism seriously. The flood of interest that accompanied the publication of Judenstaat did not subside very quickly. Numerous articles, letters, and commentaries appeared, offering a spectrum of different opinions on the pamphlet. As the weeks passed after the article's appearance, Herzl became a fixed presence on the nationalist scene, his words making him a sensation. Soon after Birnbaum's review appeared in Die Zeit, in the same letter with which he sends a copy of Die nationale Wiedergeburt, he pressed Herzl for a face-to-face meeting. Herzl, in the meantime, was becoming apprised of the figures on the Zionist scene, including Birnbaum. He was initially reluctant to meet Birnbaum; citing a lack of time, he noncommit tally hoped that they have a chance to meet in the future.56 Birnbaum persisted, and finally they agreed to meet on March 3 at Herzl's apartment. This meeting was the impetus for the entry from Herzl's diary quoted earlier. As it shows, Birnbaum particularly irritated Herzl, a reaction doubtlessly predestined by his earlier pedagogic mailing (and he may well have also read Birnbaum's review of Judenstaat, although he does not say so). Herzl's diary entry leaves little room for speculation about his feelings toward Birnbaum after their first meeting. The diary, a crucial historical document that has had a great influence on how many within the movement have been cast in the history of Zionism, has had a particularly unfortunate impact on Birnbaum. From the beginning, and for no immediately obvious reason, Herzl portrays him as a liability to Zionism, little more than an egotistical, money-grubbing blowhard 55.

In his first entry that discusses Birnbaum, Herzl identifies a set of themes that would continue to frame his per ception of him for as long as the two men had any association: Birnbaum is unmistakably jealous of me. What the baser sort of Jews put into vulgar or sneering language, namely that I am out for personal advantage, is what I catch in the intimations of this cultivated gentleman. The predicted rancor, within and without, is already there. I judge Birnbaum to be an envious, vain and obstinate man. I hear that he had already turned away from Zionism and gone over to Socialism, when my appearance led him back again to Zion.57 To these charges would be added a score of others: that Birnbaum was only involved in Zionism for financial gain; that he claimed to be the "founder" of Zionism; and that he intentionally disrupted Zionist events?particularly the Basel congress?in order to topple Herzl's leadership. Of the many complaints Herzl makes about him, two are repeated frequently and are the most serious in his indictment of Birnbaum's character. The first is that Birnbaum had abandoned Zionism by the time of Herzl's arrival on the scene in 1896; the second is that he had embraced socialism in its stead, although what is meant by "socialism" and why it is necessarily in conflict with Zionism is never clear from Herzl's words. The implication of these two judgments is that Birnbaum had forfeited any claim to represent a voice within Zionism and that whatever claims he made after Herzl's appearance were therefore made with malignant intentions. Interestingly, Herzl projects onto Birnbaum many of the same charges that had been lodged at himself by others. He imagines that Birn baum is fundamentally dishonest and willing to exchange his years of earnest service to Zionism for an opportunistic payoff. More damaging, he is portrayed as an obstructionist, a man who out of jealousy and pettiness would hinder and sully the sacred work of "Zion"?work he no longer believed in personally? before seeing himself pushed aside. Though Herzl's diary is an indispensable source, in this case it has been the cause of a persistent misreading of Birnbaum's activity during the 1890s. As we have seen, and further as Birnbaum's own extensive bibliography during the period shows, he had not really abandoned Zionism, and he certainly had not, nor would he really ever, stray from his intense Jewish nationalist convictions.58 57.

In fact, many of Birnbaum's major statements on Zionism were written during this time, including Die nationale Wiedergeburt des j?dischen Volks in seinem Lande (1893); Die Zionistische Bewegung (1895); Der Zionismus (1896); his address to the Basel congress in 1897, "Zionism als Culturbewegung"; and Zwei Vortr?ge ?ber Zionismus (1898). During this time, Birnbaum edited his own Zionist journal, J?dische Volkszeitung (the final incarnation of Selbst-Emancipation) until its 261</page><page sequence="22">Jess Olson Certainly, his writings reflect a vision of Zionism that was often at odds with Herzl's. Herzl never hid his disinterest in the so-called cultural aspects of Jewish nationalism that were so dear to Birnbaum, at least until he laid out his own, very different image of the future state in the novel Altneuland', at this phase, he felt there was little effort to spare for such frivolous concerns. Rather, all energy was needed to negotiate, create institutions, and raise funds to allow for the mass movement of Jews, as soon as possible, to a state of their own. Even if there were resources to spare for such concerns as constructing some sort of Jewish national identity, Herzl had little regard for such fantastic ideas as creating a Hebrew-speaking new Jewish nation ex nihilo. Certainly, Birnbaum was far from the only member of the movement who shared differing views of the priorities of Zionism. Many, particularly the "Russian" faction, inspired by Ahad Ha'am, shared a vision of Zionism that was much closer to Birnbaum's than to Herzl's, but remained within the movement?indeed, within a decade, they had triumphed over Herzl for control of the movement. In the spring of 1896, however, the initial meeting of minds between the old vanguard of Zionism and its future in the form of Herzl fared badly. The only first hand reflection on the meeting, Herzl's own, shows that the meeting was a failure. At best, the four participants completely misunderstood and misread each other; at worst, Birnbaum and his colleagues confirmed Herzl's belief that Jewish nation alism as such did not exist without him in any meaningful way. The meeting cer tainly put at risk any possibility of a mutual partnership (or even respect) between Herzl and the established Jewish nationalist camp. Herzl's words reveal that he felt the meeting to be a vindication of his low expectations about the state of the Jewish nationalist organization: that it was nothing but a disorganized confederation of aimless cranks. This assessment was, of course, self-serving to Herzl's personal agenda of "creating" the idea of the Jewish state of his own initiative, which left little room for antecedents and competition for leadership. However, regard less of his prejudice, Birnbaum and the others seem to have done little to present a united or coherent front. But there must have been some sense that the meeting was positive, if not to Herzl than to Birnbaum and the others, for Birnbaum was confident enough after ward to take a shockingly bold and (as it would turn out) disastrous step in their relationship. He sent, only a day after their meeting, a letter that not only cemented Herzl's feeling that Birnbaum was a worthless partner in Zionism but also laid the foundation for Herzl's conviction that Birnbaum had no real interest in the movement other than as a way out of his desperate financial situation. On March 4, Birnbaum writes, I have long had the desire, through both my inclination and ability, to inter vene in new ways in the [Zionist party's] drive?however for a long time I closing in 1896, as well as the Berlin journal Zion from 1896 to 1897, and he was a regular contributor, until very late, of materials to Herzl's own Zionist newspaper, Die Welt. 262</page><page sequence="23">The Late Zionism of Nathan Birnbaum have ceased to do so, in part because of the leaden paralysis and disorganiz ation within the Zionist camp, in part beacuse of personal circumstances. The latter situation is unfortunately still very much at hand, and it is to in the end abolish [this situation] that I turn directly, with these words, to you ... Indeed I also have reason to fear that you will misconstrue this letter, and I point out this fear, for I know that there is no philistine or inconsequential person before me. I come to you to ask for help,?help which for you, I believe, would not cause significant exertion ... Briefly: I had the misfortune to recognize the truth of Zionism?from which you have remained shielded?already in my 16th year. To these ideals I have given my entire passionate personality, and [in the mean time] shut myself out of any other career that I could have accomplished with my own talents. I have pressed myself into a dark, unknown corner of literature?with the result being a constant degeneration of my financial situation. Dear honored doctor! I have endured such distressing times, the horrors of which I cannot begin to give you a clear idea. Only through a pitiful secretarial post and through constant indebtedness am I able to hold back the floods, and I stew along with my wife, mother and children ... I am faced with my wits' end ?and only because of my realization of these circumstances in the end, and after a long struggle with myself, have I decided to turn to you. You have the influence, consideration, and power to help me. I beg you affectio nately, send your advice! Although our acquantaince is so young, I believe, that there is a bond woven between us, which makes it acceptible for me to ask of you: save me from certain destruction, and preserve with me Zionism! Should you not, however, act upon my request, I ask you to please show your kind discretion?also about Zionism?and be certain, that I also will do so?thus I will maintain and continue to fulfill my duty as a Zionist.59 A sympathetic reader of this letter could not help but be moved by the degree of desperation and frustration that must have led Birnbaum to write it. Little of the letter is an exaggeration; neither Birnbaum's assertions of his centrality to the movement from its inception nor the details of the hardships he had endured for its sake. Indeed, to the sympathetic reader, the letter might have been read as it was: the reluctant debasement of a very proud and capable man for the sake of his very survival. Birnbaum, as his life's work had shown, was willing to sacrifice all for the cause he had passionately embraced; now he was at the end of his rope. Unfortunately, Herzl was not a sympathetic reader. The candor and distinct lack of social grace exhibited by this letter did nothing but offend the urbane columnist. Birnbaum seems to have believed that Herzl would be moved by his recounting of how poorly his sacrifice for Zionism had been rewarded; he likewise was under the impression that the two had established a rapport?a "bond"? either as gentlemen or as allies in a common cause. Although neither assumption counteracts the embarrassing nature of the letter?compounded by the fact that the 59. Birnbaum to Herzl, March 4, 1896. 263</page><page sequence="24">Jess Olson two had only met the day before?he was mistaken on both counts. The letter dis gusted Herzl and, more damagingly, confirmed his belief that whatever Zionist movement had existed prior to his appearance had been bereft of any responsible leadership. His diary recounts the incident in passing, without surprise, as if he expected little else, noting only that he loaned Birnbaum 20 guilders, a notation he makes only to prevent him from later manufacturing an accusation of tightfist edness to use as ammunition against him.60 Yet he does not express his disgust to Birnbaum, who took the loan as a posi tive reception of the tale of his plight. Emboldened, he presses for even more assistance: My situation has worsened still further. [To repay] the first debt before me, I have little more than hours. Only through arranging for more short term credit have I been able to hold the water back. The maturation of these debts is fast approaching, and if I cannot pay, my good name and every other possibility for my existence will be destroyed ... I only ask you, to consider the rapid assistance that must be found. What is this sum against the many thousands, which you will bring in from your press organization or paper next week? Please bear in mind: who has served this cause more than I, who from the beginning his Zionist life's way sacrificed the little inheritance of his father (c. 1500 fl.) ... ? Who of the miserable hundred or so fellow fighters has served more, has come to such shame as I, who for ten years of my life, dedicated my health, my career, my existence in labor for the state-based rebirth of the Jewish people ... I will truly repay all over time. You yourself, dear honored doctor, have looked me in the eyes, [and know that] before long I will be undone. And outside of that, I have the strictest assurances from Professor Singer, that he will soon create a position for me ... I have no other hope than you.61 There is no clear indication as to whether Herzl continued to loan Birnbaum money; this letter does not make it into the diaries. But Herzl did reply to Birnbaum in a letter a few days later and, surprisingly, brings up the possibility of creating a salaried position within the new Zionist movement for Birnbaum: I have spoken with Mr. Wolfsohn from Cologne, that we may, with the help of Zion [the Berlin Zionist periodical] etc., create a paid post of Secretary of the Zionist Movement for you. Mr. Wolfsohn is speaking today with Dr. Schnirer, and these gentlemen will do what is necessary to bring this into being, and by so doing, help you until you can find a situation on your own.62 60.

Herzl to Birnbaum, April 26, 1896. 264</page><page sequence="25">The Late Zionism of Nathan Birnbaum This charitable letter, so starkly different from his private thoughts about Birn baum, requires an explanation of Herzl's possible motives. Remarkably, although he clung to the idea with a vengeance afterward, Birnbaum did not (at least in his correspondence) request a salaried position within the Zionist movement; it seems to have been Herzl's idea entirely?he even made preliminary arrangements before writing to Birnbaum. Making Birnbaum an employee of the Zionist move ment with a modest salary was itself a sensible way of dealing with him; despite his uncouth letters, Birnbaum scarcely exaggerated his commitment to Zionism or his sacrifices (and, although he does not mention it explicitly, the loyalty of his colleagues), and paying him to continue his work within the movement could have been strategically useful. Indeed, Herzl would have had much to gain by bringing Birnbaum into the movement in such a manner, and this was perhaps part of his thinking. As a newcomer, Herzl was bedeviled (as he himself admits) by accusations of dilettantism. Birnbaum had the Zionist bona fides he lacked; thus, to have Birnbaum's support for his efforts could help bolster his stature as a committed Zionist. At the same time, by making Birnbaum financially beholden to the movement and to himself, Herzl may have thought that he could exert some control over him, neutralizing him as a potential rival. The idea of creating a paid position within the movement for Birnbaum?or at least in telling him about it?was a choice that Herzl would come to regret, as it played a central part in their bitter clash at the Basel conference the next year. In the end, the position of general secretary, at least for the time being, came to naught; instead, Birnbaum was brought to Berlin to work on the new journal of the Berlin Hovevei Zion, Zion, which Herzl eyed as a potential organ for his move ment.63 Birnbaum relocated for a second time with his family to Berlin in the summer of 1896. This provided some temporary financial relief, with the result that Birnbaum soon began to assert his independence from Herzl's line. He was not alone in this; although the Berlin Hovevei Zion were, on the whole, supportive of Herzl, seeing in him both a vehicle for rapid growth of Zionism as well as a dynamic public figure, they did not hesitate to voice their opposition when Herzl's policies conflicted too much with their own?to his intense frustration. The friction between Herzl and Birnbaum began not long after the latter's move to Berlin. Birnbaum fired the opening salvo by taking on Herzl's direct diplomatic approach, particularly his ill-advised trip to Istanbul.64 A controversial decision, Herzl's choice to engage in unilateral negotiations as a representative of the Jewish people with the sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Abdulhamid, was a failure. Not only was he not granted an audience with the sultan, neither as a representative of the Jewish people nor as a journalist, but by making open assertions about the desire of the Jews to establish a homeland 63. This arrangement did not come quickly enough for Birnbaum. Underscoring the disastrous state of his finances, Birnbaum sent an agitated letter, complaining that he had not yet heard from Wolf sohn, and then yet another letter on May 5, reiterating his financial situation and begging for an immedi ate loan. Birnbaum to Herzl, May 1, 1896; Birnbaum to Herzl, May 5, 1896. 64.

Abandoning the earlier Zionist policy of subtle infiltration into Palestine, the slow building up of colonies designed not to draw the attention of the Ottoman authorities and raise fears of another nascent nationalities problem to plague the already troubled multinational empire, Herzl ham-fistedly confirmed the sultan's worst fears. This had the immediate result of raising the profile of the early Zionist colonies, already strug gling, as well as more pronounced assertions by the sultan of his total opposition to organized Jewish settlement in the Ottoman Empire, particularly in Palestine. In the aftermath of Herzl's Ottoman trip and its unfortunate repercussions, Birnbaum chose to challenge Herzl's belief (which he did seem to hold) that he in any way represented Herzl's interests among the Berlin Zionists. Beginning a heated exchange, Birnbaum cites lack of time and resources to advance Herzl's cause in Berlin, but ultimately indicates the true motives for his inactivity: resentment of his unilateral activity. Until today [because of] my situation, which has occupied all of my time, I have had not an hour to do this. For the same reason I also cannot complete any "probe work" and therefore until now I have had not been able to make use of your suggestions. Naturally this will soon happen ... I would be very obliged to you, if you would occasionally give me some information regarding your actions.65 Herzl's response takes umbrage at the accusation he was acting dictatorially (in addition to correcting Birnbaum's word usage): "One makes {begeht) a mistake; one does not commit (verbricht) one." A cutting start?and the tone of Herzl's letter does not improve: Perhaps I have made mistakes ... [however] they were not anything for which you should answer me in such a hateful tone. I will answer no more about them. Do not forget, that I must do everything by myself. These platonic declara tions of agreement don't help me or anyone at all ... If there perhaps were or are in Berlin or anywhere else Zionists who believe that I have ever acted as a dictator, [then] these people do not know that I stated explicitly in Paris and London that I would undertake the leadership of this mission if I received a guarantee that they would carry out the things initiated by me verbally in Constantinople?with unhopedfor luck. Because this did not happen, I must naturally go forth alone, not from my own desire. Once I have begun, I shall not leave no matter how great the disappointment and thankless ness and misery that it may give us.66 Birnbaum was well aware of the anger that he had raised by opposing Herzl, an anger he recognized as that of a man who was not accustomed to having his 65.

I have not found these communications of resistance from these Jews as intolerable as you have. I know at least as much about this as you, if not more. I hear voices that do not reach your ears. What I predicted to you has come true: to the last Zionists in all countries have become hostile to you. The Zionist papers hound you, and all charge precisely that you, through your behavior, have made the colonies of Palestine vulnerable. However, as it is said, I would want little for myself were I to see the smal lest acknowledgment of certain mistakes which you have made [verbrachten]] up till now ... There is not room nor time in a letter to discuss which mistakes these were. Perhaps there will be an opportunity to discuss them in person. I'll only indicate that I?and I am correct when I speak for all Zionists, whether they accept you or not?[believe] your secrecy in this undertaking does not come cheaply ... Once more I ask that you not be angry about my candor.67 Birnbaum continued the trend that he had initiated upon his move to Berlin: that of assuming the role of an unofficial voice of the Zionist street that Herzl ignored at his peril. There is more than a hint in his words of a man on the defensive, strug gling to maintain his relevance in a movement about compromising on the prin ciples he had worked to establish and increasingly forgetful of the contributions he had made. Herzl was unwilling to forget the advantage Birnbaum took of his weakened position among Zionists after the Istanbul trip; nor did Birnbaum give him much reason to trust his motives as 1897, the year of the First Zionist Congress in Basel, progressed. For his part, Birnbaum frequently tested the boundaries of Herzl's leadership. Herzl, for his part, marginalized and even embarrassed Birnbaum when he could, taking what opportunities he had to remind Birnbaum of his place. The year 1897, a pivotal year in the history of Zionism, was a tipping point from Birnbaum's perspective, showing him the limits of his future within Herzl's movement. By the spring ofthat year, Herzl's failures in the direct "diplomatic" approach had led him to assent to a general conference of Zionists.68 As discus sions regarding the arrangements for a congress progressed in February and March, the decision that the congress would be held in Munich raised the visibility and leverage of the Berlin Zionists, in particular Wolfsohn, Bodenheimer, and Willy Bambus but also Birnbaum. In a preliminary meeting in Vienna around March 10, a committee made up of, among others, Bambus, Yehoshua Thon, and Birnbaum met with Herzl. This meeting, recorded in Herzl's diary, afforded 67. Birnbaum to Herzl, November 5, 1896. 68. See Vital, Origins of Zionism, 298-353. 267</page><page sequence="28">Jess Olson him yet another opportunity to put Birnbaum in his place as the latter once again attempted to show unauthorized initiative. The reason for conflict on this occasion was Birnbaum's request for backing from Herzl and the Zionist movement for his plan to run for election to the Aus trian Reichsrat on a Jewish nationalist platform. The idea of opening a new front in Jewish nationalism through the ballot box was one on which Birnbaum had been ruminating for some time?at least since 1886, the year he published an article advancing a "Jewish People's Party." It indicated Birnbaum's increasing sense of self-esteem among the Berlin Zionists, at some distance from Herzl's immediate presence in Vienna. Birnbaum was, after reeling from his sudden loss of influence, once again finding his feet and attempting to strike out on his own and pursue his own ideas. Herzl, with gratuitous cruelty, put a quick stop to Birnbaum's efforts. Herzl's hostility to Birnbaum, beyond his dislike for Birnbaum's idea, is on clear display in his diary: Birnbaum was more self-assured and inwardly more hostile to me than ever. He wanted my financial and moral support for his candidacy in the election district of Sereth-Suczawa-Radutz, a candidacy that had been offered me as well, which I refused and he undertook at the last moment. Considering the late date?there is only one week to the election?I denied him my support, because an unsuccessful attempt could compromise the mystical prestige of our movement in Galicia. He will never forgive me for this, no. Incidentally, just for the sake of being elected he wanted to make personal compromises with the social politicians, Social Democrats, and others, and run as a representative of a Jewish People's Party (which does not even Though we have no record of Birnbaum's response, presumably Herzl did not err in his suspicion of Birnbaum's anger. The satisfaction Herzl derived from refusing Birnbaum, almost palpable, indicates that he got the reaction he had sought. That Herzl's refusal of Birnbaum was particularly disingenuous is shown by the fact that a month earlier, he had himself not only embraced the idea of running a Zionist candidate for the Reichsrat, but also he, Moritz Schnirer, and Oser Kokesch had decided to support two candidates, Dr. Leon Kellner and Dr. Abraham Salz, in their bids for the Reichsrat and turned down running for office himself. Herzl's refusal to support Birnbaum, seemingly based on firm elec toral realities, was more likely the result of his dislike of Birnbaum's independent action. His charge that Birnbaum only chose to run at the last minute, in a district in which, supposedly, he had been asked to run (although he indicates in an earlier entry that he had been asked to run in Kolomea, not Sereth-Suczawa-Radutz, which were different electoral districts) is unfounded?in fact, we have no confir mation of how long Birnbaum had been actively pursuing election.70 Moreover, the repetition of the key themes of a conversion to Socialism and a defection 69.

Herzl, Diaries, January 29, 1897. 268</page><page sequence="29">The Late Zionism of Nathan Birnbaum from Zionism (for the sake of a "Jewish People's Party") cast even more suspicion on his motives for squelching Birnbaum's candidacy.71 Birnbaum's, however, was not a total loss; as the spring of 1897 progressed, Herzl began to find the Berlin Zionists increasingly intractable to his demands and requests?attributable in no small part to Birnbaum's status among them. A month after the Vienna meeting, Herzl's diary records the "perfidy" of Bambus (whom he had earlier believed his strongest and ablest ally among the German Zionists), who had sent a response to the congress announcement released to the Jewish press, calling into question the full commitment of German Zionists to the undertaking. "His purpose is clear," Herzl writes, "he wants to make me appear a braggart, to undermine the congress ... Bambus gives the pretext that the Munich Jews are beside themselves and are protesting against the holding of the congress in Munich."72 Herzl's skepticism of Bambus 's motives is somewhat misplaced; in fact, the German-Jewish establishment was very uncomfortable with the Congress being held in Germany. Nevertheless, his suspicions of treachery?confirmed in the final sentence of his entry, "perhaps it is only plain envy on the part of the Ber liners who are afraid that I shall get all the leadership in my hands"?revolve, again, around his sense of a challenge to his authority. Seizing again on a moment of weakness, Birnbaum attacked?again in the rational, popular voice he had honed in his relations with Herzl?in an article designed to expose once and for all Herzl's aim of controlling Zionism with an iron fist. Writing in Zion, Birnbaum pounces in "On the Munich Congress" on Herzl's announcement, apparently given without any warning, that a key pro cedural element of the Munich congress was to be abandoned. This was an agree ment, reached during the Vienna meeting, that there would be two committees in the congress, the first an "internal" one, composed of Zionist party members who would settle purely technical, procedural issues, and a second "external" one, the rank-and-file of the movement, that would take the lead in making the proceedings open to the wider Zionist public. Herzl, by executive fiat, had undermined the democratic nature of this arrangement by asserting a much broader power of the executive committee, allowing it to appoint the full leadership of the movement. Now Dr. Herzl, standing at the head of the congress organization commission, has either not grasped the deeper meaning of this two-part separation, despite his pronounced inclination towards opportunism, or else he has simply been slain by his unfortunate temperament. However this might be, he has as well as irreparably ruined by means of his announcement [that] the Zionists will be nominated by Zionists ... in a style not distinguishable from a dry business announcement. A party struggle has broken out which threatens those outside [the movement]. I no longer know how far Dr. Herzl's love 71. Herzl was most likely not mistaken in his assertions about a "Jewish People's Party"; however, he revealed his ignorance of Birnbaum's publications. As early as 1894, Birnbaum had put forth the idea of a "Jewish People's Party" {J?dische Volkspartei), though he conceived of it as a Zionist entity. 72. Herzl, Diaries, April 24, 1897. 269</page><page sequence="30">Jess Olson for these theatrics goes ... I would truly not shed a tear if [this congress] died ... [It would be preferable] to the deep pain I would feel if certain gloomy pro phecies that the congress will be proclaimed above all a horrendous fiasco are fulfilled.73 Striking again a populist voice, Birnbaum believed that this action was nothing less than the removal of the Zionist movement from the "people" (Volk), who should be its greatest strength, and the triumph of "practical" Zionism?that is, the Zionism that eschewed mass, popular action in favor of elite-funded infiltra tion of Palestine. For Herzl to adapt such a position, Birnbaum suggests, was not only a betrayal of his own claims to leadership of Jewish nationalism but of the entire Jewish people. To Birnbaum, "the people (das Volk) is everything," and the practical elitists could never capture the enthusiasm or the zeal of the people with its "half-man" tactics.74 Zionism must be made a movement of the Volk, and the "'practical' and romantic must be made a real movement," which was prevented at all costs from becoming "the plaything in the hands of chance, a serious matter for the general public entrusted to some investor ... from the caprice of a segment of Jewish cultural philistines to become the will of the people."75 When the congress convened in August 1897, in Basel rather than Munich, the smoldering enmity between the two men finally burst into open conflict. Though much of Birnbaum's behavior irritated Herzl, the attempt by some of Birn baum's followers (only Moshe Schalit is specifically named) to force a motion to create a paid general secretariat and to nominate Birnbaum for the position was, in Herzl's mind, Birnbaum's most telling treachery. He believed it to be confirmation of the base motives that had dictated Birnbaum's entire involvement with Zionism. In Herzl's words, Another critical moment?when the Birnbaum scandal occurred. This Birn baum, who had deserted Zionism for Socialism three years before I appeared on the scene, poses obtrusively as my "predecessor". In his brazen begging letters, which he wrote me and others, he sets himself up as the discoverer and founder of Zionism, because he has written a pamphlet like many another since Pinsker (whom, after all, I had not read either). He now had a few young people make the proposal that the secretary general of the Actions Committee be elected directly and paid by the Con gress. And this creature, who at the first National Assembly of the Jews has no other thought but to get himself voted a stipend, has the nerve to compare himself to me. And as in his schnorring letters, here, too, the audacity along with his begging. The secretary-general, as trusted representative of the Congress, is supposed to counter-balance the other twenty-two members of the Actions Committee! 73.

Ibid. 270</page><page sequence="31">The Late Zionism of Nathan Birnbaum I declared that I could not imagine how under such circumstances anyone would accept a seat on that committee. The motion fell through ignominiously. It was the only discordant note at the Congress.76 This entry is pure Herzl: the dramatic unfolding of events worthy ofa feuilleton in the Neue Freie Presse, his hyperbole ("the only discordant note"), the emphasis on his unappreciated self-sacrifice for the movement, his proud ignorance of the body of Zionist literature that had preceded him (even Leon Pinsker!). Of these qualities, it is his telling comment that Birnbaum, a "creature," had the nerve to compare himself to Herzl that perhaps best characterizes his relationship not only with Birn baum but with all those who would claim some precedence or ownership of the Zionist movement not granted by Herzl himself. Also striking, he repeats the charge that Birnbaum had left Zionism long before Herzl came on to the scene, thereby forfeiting any authority over the movement, and that he had left Zionism for some nebulous "socialism." Whether the events of August 27 were the "only discordant note" of the First Zionist Congress, the anger they inspired in Herzl did not go unnoticed by Birn baum. Indeed, Birnbaum even attempted to mend the damage, giving a sense that he thought, perhaps, he had finally gone too far. He pressed the issue by apologiz ing for the disruption, distancing himself from its actors, and again, appealing to Herzl's charity. In a letter of September 7, 1897, only eleven days after the events recorded with such vigor in Herzl's diaries, Birnbaum writes the following: [Even] before the well-known events of the congress occurred, which further intensified the continuing misunderstandings between us, I sought to declare my loyalty to you and your intentions. Concerning the scene that marred the last sitting of the congress, I wish to assure you ... that I in no way instigated it, and strongly disapprove and condemn it. I also ask you sincerely not to consider the indiscretions of these gentlemen inexcusable, but rather judge them leniently. The gentlemen did not act with the intention of treading on you or undermining the congress, but rather out of a deep commitment to my cause. The vague fear that there could never be any end to my suffering led them to disrupt [the congress] with such an inappropriate act. If you consider these facts, dear esteemed doctor, you would consider the incident more mildly. You would also thereby have found the key to the mystery of our?how shall I put it??alienation. It is nothing but my tragic situation, which stands like an evil demon between you and other men on one side, and me on the other. The humiliating way that I must provide for the larger part of my sustenance, reduces my social status, and calls forth a feeling of constant oppression from within me, and destroys my impartiality. If I were to draw in full detail the seriousness?no, the atrociousness?of my situation, you would [perhaps] seek a long-term solution. You would leave no stone unturned, and certainly not deny any sustenance for one like 76.

It is noteworthy that Birnbaum does not make mention of the suggestion, made almost a year earlier by Herzl himself, that he be given a similar position in the nascent movement; perhaps this was in the mind of both. Herzl, however, was hardly mollified. He complains in his diary that Birnbaum had mobilized all of his supporters, "playing all his cards" in support of his being appointed sec retary general. He repeats yet again the charge that Birnbaum had already aban doned Zionism "for three years, having gone over to Socialism." He mocks again Birnbaum's role in the early years of the movement, "Despite this he had spread around Basel that without Birnbaum, Herzl and the Basel Congress would not have been possible. Great applause!"78 In the end, however, Birnbaum triumphed, and he served in the capacity of general secretary of the Actions Com mittee for approximately a year. His victory was a pyrrhic one, however?his last as a Zionist. After his appointment to the Actions Committee, ironically, Birnbaum's influence in the Zionist movement declined rapidly. This was partly attributable to Herzl's continued, relentless marginalization of his potential opponents within the movement, which is vividly displayed in his diary by the contempt with which he treats the Actions Committee, supposedly the central organizational committee of the Zionist movement that rose out of the congress of 1897. He refers to it as the "inaction committee" and jabs at Birnbaum personally: "Dr. Birnbaum, 77. Birnbaum to Herzl, September 7, 1897. 78. Herzl, Diaries, September 9, 1897. 272</page><page sequence="33">The Late Zionism of Nathan Birnbaum the 'general-secretary,' has as his only general secretion to date a document which guarantees him employment for one year and against which he wants to rent furniture."79 He makes clear his unwillingness to treat the committee as an institution to which he is accountable, even while offering a (rare) compliment to one of its members: "My good Schnirer, who is certainly as honest as the day is long ... demanded as the most important thing an 'agenda' for the Actions Committee. But behind this guilelessness there may be the wish to inter fere with me."80 In the end, Herzl used an accusation of Birnbaum's machinations against him as a pretext for ignoring the Actions Committee altogether. On March 12, 1898, Herzl writes, "I never bring up my plans and actions in the meetings [of the Actions Committee], because Birnbaum is taking the minutes as secretary general?and 'gathering material' for his future indiscretions." Birnbaum, he com plains, was a "typical enemy" who could not be eliminated from the committee because he "threatens he will starve," who would eventually "bring disgrace to the movement yet."81 By April 1898, Herzl had abandoned the pretence of working with the Actions Committee altogether: Birnbaum quietly incites against me, at the University, acts the part of Colum bus and martyr of Zionism, while I am Amerigo Vespucci and the usurper ... Undercurrents even in the Action Committee. Individuals are offended because they are not 'informed' of anything. Yesterday I brought Schnirer to reason about why I have to work alone, now as before. The committee is an unserviceable instrument. Only indiscretions are com mitted. No one is able to help; for various reasons they are in no position to do Birnbaum and his pretensions to act as a "martyr of Zionism," the unwillingness of Birnbaum and others to grant Herzl full license to act on behalf of Zionism?these were Herzl's ultimate reasons for disavowing the usefulness of the Action Com mittee. While these hint at a much deeper element of Herzl's conflicts with the movement and can hardly be reducible to the influence of one individual, Herzl placed the lion's share of the blame on Birnbaum. By the end of 1898 and Birnbaum's tenure as general secretary of the Actions Committee, however, his part in Herzl's frustrations was made moot by Birnbaum's own withdrawal from Zionism. Although he did not formally resign from the committee until 1899, Birnbaum's work with the committee had ceased, as had his submissions to Zionist periodicals?although he would con tinue, over the following years, to submit an odd article to Die Welt and Zion. Indeed, Herzl signaled awareness of his triumph over Birnbaum in 1899, when 79. Herzl, Diaries, September 24, 1897. 80. Ibid. 81. Herzl, Diaries, March 12, 1898. 82. Herzl, Diaries, April 11, 1898. 273</page><page sequence="34">Jess Olson he wrote an unusually friendly letter inquiring why Birnbaum was no longer sub mitting material to Die Welt and inviting him to do so. Birnbaum, preserving his pride to the extent that he was still able, declined.83 Whether he retained the support of this followers who had pushed the congress to appoint him to the sec retariat is irrelevant, for by then he had lost all affection for the movement, as well as all intellectual interest. Conclusion A major motivation for Birnbaum's drift away from Zionism was no doubt the unyielding struggle with Herzl that he could not avoid. In the end, Herzl's pre sence and popularity, as well as the power of his vision and his ability to present it in a moving way to a broad audience, made him an irresistible force. Nor did he allow for dissention or argument from his vision, particularly from those who lacked sufficient organization or strength, such as Birnbaum and his supporters. Although he seems to have been able to muster enough support for a successful revolt on the floor of the Basel conference on his behalf, it proved to be a weak one. Although it did prefigure the final, much more successful insurrection in the Zionist movement during Herzl's lifetime, that of the "Democratic Faction" in the Sixth Zionist Congress, Birnbaum's revolt lacked the cohesion and unity of ideals of the later rebels. In the end, Herzl's early claims about Birnbaum, that he had "left Zionism," became a self-fulfilling prophecy, but hardly because of the intellectual duplicity that Herzl alleged. Rather, there was a complex set of reasons that led Birnbaum to finally leave Zionism, both the organized movement (which he did in 1899) and the ideology itself (which he did a few years later). The unrelenting struggle with Herzl was clearly a major part, as we have seen. The documents?including Herzl's diary, the correspondence between Herzl and Birnbaum, and Birnbaum's writings on the movement during the crucial years 1896-99?show that the two men were engaged in a protracted war, and though Birnbaum may have won a battle here or there, the larger progression of the struggle was not in his favor. Whatever the many reasons the two men could not work together?and clearly there was fault on both sides?ultimately, only one of them could have his way: Either Birn baum would get the voice and recognition he felt he deserved after a long and largely selfless devotion to Jewish nationalism, or Herzl would establish absolute party discipline and ideological unity, along lines he alone determined. Herzl succeeded. As for the nature of Birnbaum's fraught relationship with Zionism after Herzl, however, many misconceptions have persevered in the historiography of the movement. Many of these originated with Herzl himself, and it speaks to the success he and his supporters had in remaking the early Zionist narrative in his image that Birnbaum has found little place in the story?and, in the eyes of some, that place is entirely a negative one. My narrative here should serve, at 83. Herzl to Birnbaum, 1899; Birnbaum to Herzl, 1899. 274</page><page sequence="35">The Late Zionism of Nathan Birnbaum least in part, as a corrective to Herzl's portrayal. Such an evaluation depends in no small part on a clear understanding of the evolution of Birnbaum's thought in the years immediately preceding and during Herzl's arrival. As his activities and par ticularly his writing in this period shows, it was a crucial phase in Zionist history including the planning and execution of the Zionist conference and the years immediately following. On close examination, we find that Birnbaum was very much the intellectual and public presence of the cast that many of his contempor aries?among them early Zionists Moritz Schnirer and Berthold Feiwel, national ists such as Chaim Zhitlovsky, to major figures in Jewish intellectual history like Martin Buber and Franz Rosenzweig?saw him. Birnbaum's complex consider ation of issues of Jewish peoplehood and nationalism, of which we have examined just a small part in the text ofDie j?dische Moderne, were unique and original and, along with the multitude of other essays that make up his life of work, show a vibrant and little-explored side of the evolution of Jewish nationalist thought. As the historiographie narrative of early Zionism develops and matures, it is increasingly important that the breadth of ideas about Jewish peoplehood and nation be studied and understood. And indeed, Birnbaum's nationalist thought, when fully examined in its context, is hardly that of a marginal figure. The very fact that Birnbaum, among all those with whom Herzl contended in his rise to dominance in the movement, dominates so much time and rancor in his diary shows the centrality of his conten tion with Birnbaum in early Zionist history despite the scant attention that has been paid to it. Clearly a major conflict, with momentum enough to actually disrupt the sessions of the Basel conference itself, Birnbaum's challenge to Herzl's hegemony in the Zionist movement has gone virtually unnoticed, as with most of Birnbaum's impact on Jewish nationalism. But, as Berthold Feiwel noted, Birnbaum's deepest preoccupation was not popularity but rather that the ideology or tactic he embraced was true to his inner most belief. This is not to suggest that he was uninterested in public opinion or in garnering a wide following. On the contrary, he cared a great deal about tapping the deepest reserve of a common Jewish peoplehood in order to call all Jews to his way of thinking. And in a way, he succeeded in doing so, though not as he would have liked or even perceived. In the end, what he might have seen as his greatest failure?to ever see one of his ideas embraced by a majority of the Jewish people ?reflects for us his greatest discovery. European Jewry in the early twentieth century had not one but many deep reserves, many streams of commitment and ideology, all integral to the fabric of European Jewish existence. When Rosenz weig referred to Birnbaum as the living exponent of history, he was right on more than one level. As we have said, Birnbaum not only belonged to but often led in many of the major intellectual trends of pre- and interwar European Jewry. More deeply, however, he had an innate (if unconscious) sense, an almost instinctive drive to seek out and explore in the deepest and most intimate sense the meaning of these many trends in his voluminous writing. This quality, simply put, is of unique importance to Jewish historiography. Here is a man who participated and reflected, constantly, obsessively even, on his intellectual path from his youth, who was not afraid to reexamine his beliefs, even to 275</page><page sequence="36">Jess Olson contradict himself.
