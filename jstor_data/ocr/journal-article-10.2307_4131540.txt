Lawrence: University of Kansas Press, 2003. xv, 343 pp. Historians of the Third Reich have long noted that Nazi Germany's actions on the battlefield and occupation policies were governed both by conventional mil- itary and radical ideological considerations. Much attention has been devoted to the problem of separating the two strands analytically, to determining which ac- tions and policies should be labeled as primarily one or the other and which ele- ments within the regime thought and behaved mainly according to conventional versus ideological notions. In recent years it has become common to place Ger- man military operations before June 1941 under the "conventional" rubric and to 381</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews date the "ideological" war from the invasion of the Soviet Union, which began in that month. On the other hand, whereas the German army was once widely thought to have constituted a bastion of conventional thinking even after the ideological war had been launched, scholars have increasingly implicated it in the perpetration of ideologically rooted crimes (particularly the murder of Jews on the eastern front). Alexander Rossino's detailed study of the German invasion of Poland in Sep- tember 1939 challenges the common belief about the origin of the ideological war even as it reinforces the trend toward implicating the Wehrmacht. In his words, "the morally corrosive influence of National Socialism ... manifested itself in the dead- ly racial-political policies that the SS, police, and German army implemented against Poland's civilian population, both Christian and Jewish," from the very out- set of the September campaign (p. xiii). Moreover, what Rossino represents as the unprecedented brutality of that campaign should not be understood simply as a re- sponse to battlefield exigencies made possible by earlier German tactical and tech- nological breakthroughs but as a premeditated, coordinated effort to destroy the foundations of Polish society and ethnically cleanse captured areas that were to be incorporated into the German Lebensraum. To his mind, there is a direct link be- tween the manner in which German forces acted toward Polish Jews during the opening of World War II and the systematic mass killing of Jews throughout Eu- rope that followed the invasion of the U.S.S.R. two years later: "The brief war with Poland in September 1939 was the first step in the overall escalation of National Socialist racial . . policies . .. that ultimately resulted in genocide" (p. 235). Historians of twentieth-century European Jewry thus have an interest not only in this particular book but also in the broader historiographical discussion of the conventional and ideological aspects of Nazi policies. Indeed, sophisticated contemporary Jewish and Polish observers, such as Moshe Kleinbaum and Jan Karski, tended to interpret German actions during the September campaign and the ensuing months in which the German occupation regime took shape in con- ventional terms, stressing the arbitrariness and immediate instrumental value of German behavior. If Rossino's analysis of those same actions is correct, then those observers were actually given ample indication that the German occupiers were behaving not arbitrarily but with a clear, long-range, catastrophic ideological goal in mind. His work might thus be used in support of their claims by those who take the Jewish leadership to task for not seeing the handwriting on the wall soon enough. But is Rossino's analysis correct? Much of it depends upon public and pri- vate statements by Hitler, Himmler, Heydrich, and other eventual architects of the final solution. Rossino tends to take such statements at face value, although sev- eral decades of historical analysis would suggest that such is not always a reliable practice. When he infers ideological goals from actions instead of words, as he does when examining German reprisals against Polish insurgents, for example, he is on sounder ground, but his conclusions speak mainly to German policy toward Poles, not Jews. Rossino notes correctly that German forces drove Jews en masse from the western Polish provinces that were to be annexed directly to the Reich and that even some Jews from the remaining Polish territories were pushed over 382</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews the demarcation line into the Soviet occupation zone, but these (long-known) facts do not prove that in 1939 the leaders of the Third Reich already foresaw that the entire General gouvernement would eventually be made judenrein, let alone that all of its Jews would be murdered. There is greater novelty in the evidence he pre- sents of Wehrmacht-SS cooperation in the persecution and deportation of Jews during the first month of the war. It may indeed be true that "the seeds of successful collaboration between the army and the SS [in the mass killing of Jews] later in the war were sown in Poland in September 1939" (p. 120), but Rossino has not shown that that future collaboration was foreordained. The great merit of this book is that it demonstrates the extent to which norms of brutality toward occupied civilian populations were present in the German army from the very outset of World War II. The data Rossino has unearthed on this score may necessitate revision of some current opinions concerning the decisive role of the Soviet campaign in the process of brutalization. However, it would not be wise to use this book as a basis for understanding the origins of the final solution, let alone for evaluating the behavior of Jewish leaders in Poland before actual mass killing began.
