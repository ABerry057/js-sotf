<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FIRST JEWS FROM ALEPPO IN MANCHESTER: NEW DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE by YARON HAREL Professor Meir Benayahu's collection of documents includes a contractual agreement between some Jewish merchants in Aleppo and a hakham by the name of Yeshaya Attia. In it, Attia undertakes to go to the city of Manchester in England to serve as the spiritual leader of a colony of Aleppine merchants there. The document is very important because it enables us to fix, with a high degree of probability, the date of the founding of the Aleppine community in Manchester, the first of many communities of Jews from Aleppo in the West. The document also sheds light on the reasons why Jews emigrated from Aleppo to Manchester and the way in which they organized into a community in their new home. This article traces the background of Jewish emigration from Aleppo to Manchester and the model that the mother community of Aleppine Jewry adopted in dealing with communities made up of emigrants from Aleppo.I Emigration from Syria Significant emigration from Syria began in the mid-nineteenth century, but the scholarly literature dealing with it hardly mentions Jews, focusing mainly on Christians and to a lesser degree on Muslims. P. Hitti, for example, in his study of the religious life of Syrian immigrants in the United States, This article is dedicated to the memory of Raphael Elyadin, my teacher and friend. 1. The Hebrew text of the document will be found at the end of this article. I am grateful to Prof. Meir Benayahu for having placed it at my disposal. AJS Review 23/2 (1998): 191-202 191</page><page sequence="2">192 YARON HAREL states that Jews are omitted because they are an element of American Jewry and not of the Syrian immigrant communities.2 Until recently, scholarly writing on nineteenth-century Jewish emigration in general has also almost totally ignored the movement of Syrian Jews to the West. This is probably because of their relatively small numbers, compared to the mass emigration from Eastern Europe. As a result, the settlement of Syrian Jews in Western countries has hardly been touched upon by researchers and is mentioned in only a few studies.3 Jews began to leave Syria during the period of Egyptian rule (1831-1840), mainly going to Egypt, but also to areas not under Egyptian control.4 The restoration of Ottoman domination in 1840 and the introduction of reforms that promised equality before the law for non-Muslims exacerbated the interethnic tensions in Syrian cities.5 The situation reached its highest pitch with attacks by the Muslim inhabitants of Aleppo (1850) and Damascus (1860) on the Christian residents of their cities.6 The unrest culminated in a wave of Christian emigration to safer havens. A considerable number of families, particularly from the middle and upper classes, settled in Beirut, Egypt, Turkey, and Europe.7 Although Jews were not bothered in these incidents, one may assume that as a non-Muslim minority they felt the ground quaking beneath their feet. As they undoubtedly realized, there was no guarantee that they would not be the target of the mob's anger the next time around. Hence, 2. P. K. Hitti, The Syrians in America (New York, 1924), p. 109.

First and foremost, however, it was economic considerations that mo- tivated the Jewish emigration from Aleppo. Since the eighteenth century, Aleppine Jews had been very active in trade with the ports of Europe, and Jewish commercial houses had become the most important in the city, particularly those established by "Francos," Sephardi merchants from Europe who settled in Aleppo for business reasons and became permanent residents.8 The presence of the Francos was beneficial to the local Jewish businesses, which began to develop and prosper through their involved in international trade, especially with Europe. In the mid-nineteenth century, foreign trade had a strong effect on the Syrian economy. Thanks to the special customs duties granted to the European powers and to the lower prices of goods manufactured in European factories, imports from these countries, particularly from England, increased. The growing demand for Western products in the cities of the Middle East further enhanced the profits of the importers. With the passage of time, international trade moved from the European commercial houses and became concentrated in local ones. The reasons for this were both economic and political. In the past, trade with Europe had been mainly in Western hands via merchants from Europe who had settled in Aleppo, since the European commercial houses had no way to develop direct contacts with local merchants. As the means of communication and transport improved, thanks to the new steamships that "compressed" the Mediterranean Sea, Aleppine businessmen visited French, English, and other major European commercial cities. At the same time, merchants from Europe came to Aleppo. In this way, direct contacts were established, and both sides prospered. Toward the middle of the nineteenth century, Aleppine commercial families began to send sons or employees to represent them in Europe, thereby saving the cost of paying commercial houses in Europe to serve as their agents. Such developments made it pointless for foreigners to maintain commercial establishments in Aleppo, and this enabled the local Jews to further expand 8.

Lutzky, "The 'Francos' in Aleppo and the Effect of the Capitulation on Its Jewish Inhabitants" [Hebrew], Zion 6 (1941): 46-79; Y Harel, "The Status and Image of the Picciotto Family in the Eyes of the French Colony in Aleppo" [Hebrew], Michael 14 (1997): 171-186; idem, "The Controversy over Rabbi Ephraim Laniado's Inheritance of the Rabbinate in Aleppo," Jewish History 12, no. 2 (1998) (in press).</page><page sequence="4">194 YARON HAREL their businesses.9 As a result, many local Jewish commercial houses began to import goods from London, Manchester, and Liverpool. The Jews of Aleppo played an increasingly greater role in international trade. In 1857, for example, there were nine Jews among the sixteen Aleppine merchants holding foreign nationality who submitted a petition asking the British consul, Skene, to urge the Ottoman authorities to build a jetty in the port of Alexandretta (present-day Iskenderun), through which most of Aleppo's import and export business was conducted.10 Eight years later, twenty-eight Jewish merchants were among the forty-nine Aleppine importers and exporters who submitted a complaint submitted to the same consul, this time asking him to press the Ottoman authorities to cancel the planed transfer of the customs house from Aleppo to Alexandretta. The conclusion is inescapable that in this period Jewish merchants controlled over half of the trade with England.l" The political explanation stems from the shaky sociopolitical situation in Syria, particularly due to Muslim hostility toward the Christian population. Following the riots mentioned above, Europeans became increasingly appre- hensive about continuing to do business in the Syrian market. They were replaced by natives of Syria who settled in European cities, and hence also took over most of the profits from the export trade to Syria.12 Manchester as a Destination The industrial revolution that began in England in the eighteenth century engendered many kinds of changes, including the accelerated development of capitalism, changes in the status of workers, population movements and 9.

The textile industry was one of the major beneficiaries of the far-reaching changes in manufacturing and international trade it brought about. For hundreds of years, cotton cloth from the East, woven on manual looms, had been in great demand in the Western market. Now, English factories were able to produce cloth of very high quality at lower prices. There was a growing demand for high-quality, inexpensive British textile products, and Manchester was the foremost producer and exporter. The demand extended to countries like Syria, which had once been leading producers of textiles. British textiles not only competed with local goods, but outsold them. As a result, the manufacture of textiles in Syria, even for local consumption, became unprofitable, and the exportation of textiles from Syria ceased to be a lucrative business, as it had been in the past. In fact, the entire Ottoman empire was relegated to the sidelines of the world economy, which was now centered in capitalist Europe."1 Thanks to its commercial importance, Manchester attracted a great many immigrants from all parts of Europe and the Middle East. In addition, the relative tolerance enjoyed by Jews in England, which provided them with a refuge from the afflictions they suffered in their countries of origin, turned it into a "land of promise" in the second half of the eighteenth century.14 Most of these immigrants were poor people who engaged in peddling and petty trade in London, Manchester, and other port cities. Some of them, though, were wealthy men who took advantage of the burgeoning economic development and engaged in commerce, banking, and the stock market.5 Several established commercial houses in Manchester to export textiles to their home countries and other places.

The document is dated 1859, and it mentions "several years" during which Jews from Aleppo were emigrating to Manchester. It therefore seems that the emigration from Aleppo to England, as a permanent and ongoing phenomenon, began in the second half of the 1850s.20 This date is consistent with the periodization of Ottoman economic development in the nineteenth century. The years from 1820 to 1853 are regarded as the era during which foreign trade expanded under British hegemony, causing a decline in many branches of manufacture in Syria, particularly in textiles.21 Nevertheless, as the document shows, the emigration occurred only after the fact. At the outset, the Jews from Aleppo had no intention of settling in Manchester, but only planned to remain there for a limited time. Once they began to enjoy financial success and to feel 16. F.

A Distant Satellite Community The Sephardic community in Manchester was made up of descendants of Jews expelled from Spain and Portugal in the fifteenth century and recent immigrants from Baghdad, Morocco, and Aleppo. The Middle Easterners organized into communities separate from the other immigrant communities. Unlike the Ashkenazi Jews, who settled in the northern and southern parts of the city, the immigrants from the Middle East were concentrated only in the north of Manchester. Their isolation from the Ashkenazim increased their sense of being foreigners and their desire to strengthen their identity on the basis of their country of origin. Since the Aleppine Jewish merchants from Aleppo in Manchester were organized in a separate community under the leadership of a merchant by the name of Ezra Sherem, they maintained a distinctly independent identity even among the city's Sephardim.22 Was there, already at this stage, a deliberate desire to remain apart from the rest of the Sephardi community? We do not possess enough information to reply to this question.23 In any event, the organization of Manchester's Aleppine Jews into a separate community was made possible, to a great extent, by the support they received from their trading partners who had remained in Aleppo. The latter felt obliged to do their utmost to help their compatriots abroad create the conditions for a full Jewish life.24 This commitment stemmed from the Aleppo community's long-standing tradition of responsibility for its satellite communities. These communities, among them Kiliz, Idlib, Urfa, Aintab, and Antioch, generally depended on the Aleppo community for their spiritual needs, such as a rabbinical court and religious personnel.25 Since 22.

On the supply of teachers and ritual slaughterers from Aleppo to the satellite communities, see Neymark,</page><page sequence="8">198 YARON HAREL these communities did not produce talmudic scholars of their own, they utilized Aleppo's reservoir of scholars and hired rabbis for fixed periods of time. The rabbis who took such positions had to be capable of fulfilling all the necessary functions, ruling on halakhic questions, representing the community before the authorities, and carrying out all the work of religious personnel--cantor, shofar blower, teacher, mohel (circumciser), and shochet (ritual slaughterer).26 The rabbis who went to the satellite communities were often great Torah scholars who were willing to accept posts in places that were not Torah centers either in order to earn a livelihood or to advance their personal status.27 Until the mid-nineteenth century, Aleppo was surrounded by an inner circle of satellite communities. During the second half of the century, an outer, distant circle of new satellites was founded. This group was made up of the colonies of Aleppine emigrants in Cairo, Manchester, Milan, New York, Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Sao Paulo, and many other cities throughout the world.28 Although these communities were not geographically close to Aleppo, they had very strong spiritual-psychological ties to it. To a great extent, these daughter communities almost entirely preserved the Aleppo lifestyle in many ways. Their language continued to be Arabic, their cuisine was Aleppine, and their form of prayer and customs were the same as those of their community of origin.29 In addition, when emigration to the West first began, it was not thought of as permanent but as a temporary situation.

See, for example, the list of the virtues of Rabbi Abraham Dueck HaCohen, who left Aleppo to serve as the rabbi of the Antioch community in the third quarter of the nineteenth century, as they are enumerated by S. Dueck HaCohen, in Emet Me'eretz (Jerusalem, 1910), pp. 27a-28a, n. 4. 27. See at length in Harel, "Changes in Syrian Jewry," pp. 75-76. 28.

Chira, From Aleppo to America (New York, 1994), and Sutton, Magic Carpet. 29. On the preservation of the Aleppine lifestyle in other countries, see, for example, Sutton, Aleppo Chronicles. Identification with the community of origin and close ties to it were characteristics of Syrian emigration in general. See Halliday, "Millet of Manchester," p. 168,</page><page sequence="9">THE FIRST JEWS FROM ALEPPO IN MANCHESTER 199 Since the earliest emigrants did not take their families with them,3" they sent the greater part of their income home, and this too militated for very close ties to the mother community. The constant flow of newcomers from Aleppo reinforced the link with the home community, for they brought news and letters from friends and relatives in Syria. In its relationship to the distant satellites, Aleppo Jewry adopted the same model it had applied to the inner circle of satellite communities. This explains why the merchants who had remained in Aleppo undertook to send the hakham Yeshaya Attia to perform the religious functions required by the young community taking shape in Manchester. The pattern of Aleppo sending a rabbi or Aleppine emigrants abroad inviting one became an almost permanent feature of the formation and organization of Aleppine communities worldwide. As an example, we can cite Rabbis Shaul David Sutton, David Moshe Sutton, and Isaac Secheibar, who served in Buenos Aires, Rabbi Mordechai Attia, who was the head of the Aleppo community in Mexico City, and Rabbi Yaacov Kassin, who served for many years as rabbi of the Aleppine Jews in New York.3 At the outset, the deliberate and conscious self-segregation of immigrants from Aleppo probably stemmed from a desire to alleviate their sense of foreignness in their new home by creating a familiar setting that reminded them of their community of origin. Later on, however, this desire for isolation may have been reinforced by a belief that the leaders and rabbinic scholars of Aleppo were superior to those of other communities.

Moreover, the signatures of the parties to the agreement do not appear in the copy. The identities of the signatories are not known to me from other sources, although the family names are well attested in Aleppo, and most of them were counted among the community's financial aristocracy. 5?m ri,,ix ,=nv n my 7-n5,i xr,5 ow, in"nor. 5 4X" ) "rno' 111n nlnN", t ni5 ' '"11 ,'-r:2naj triv-ni-, Dxi 7-qix? rinn ?, rn tr-inm rinin "nio9m tri 'v m 1rn w ix xr-1 t', pnwx:,' 2 -j:)tN ' ,,,, ,z ioiw0 n" 9nff -1Y -)) 5 y vn tv7-,a1Y 8S"! ,,, tr-v-,rnmn-m 13 ally m-pn vj~xiwi ninin nyy .'In " .3 .*01 OMr .7 .7?Z3 7'9SY -.111ID-9  .YE; .8 .7nn ?6r .9 .1'V .11 .} $31 91ZW IDB 7 NY .12 .~t ? .13</page><page sequence="11">THE FIRST JEWS FROM ALEPPO IN MANCHESTER 201 09wr [oz]ini 7nximi unwri 1vK jjjjIm% -.t 14:)If 9 irrim nnS -gnn-r px riny 7-m mV111-p 111-i 11-ij-pl jj1-j 0!) 1 1 X:21 07112-9 16 ,l 6 D;IU loyVo 111iiT 0n8 01n TDN '1-nin v9-inxmwm? irpl iy ix m2 '9nrm im-9 m-9 - 0rr 1rm? u nw 00 .nimp ',m= ix [TIl'N Dmi-=2 ?13:) 121 wN 7-: N2 Y931 m-911 $.19?lv 21 7gI 7n tftln ?:) 22 nwom 0-1S-.- -.S121-."-: &amp; m Yrpnni :gfrlfn12011-1 nimt = 19riv tri? nirm? mi ,in=:2r n:2% v~7 Yi:2-p nY orm1Y mn135 Dl 0-.J?
