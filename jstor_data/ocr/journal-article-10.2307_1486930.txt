<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ken Frieden. Classic Yiddish Fiction. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1996. xiii, 364 pp. With the publication of three major studies, 1996 was a landmark year for Yiddish scholarship. For nearly a quarter century, English readers had to contend with there being only one scholarly book on Yiddish fiction--Dan Miron's out-of-print A Traveler Disguised: A Study in the Rise of Modern Yiddish Fiction in the Nineteenth Century (Schocken, 1973). Miron's classic has now been resurrected in a revised edition by Syracuse University Press, while David Roskies's A Bridge of Longing: The Lost Art of Yiddish Sto- rytelling is available from Harvard University Press. The third study is the book under review, Ken Frieden's Classic Yiddish Fiction. I would like to start with a caution: anyone seeking the usual thematic, quasi-literary information in Frieden's book will be sorely disappointed, because he is not repackaging hackneyed modes of interpretive practice. Instead, he defines the genre by way of literary aesthetics and rhetorical methods. He does this by focusing on Abramovitsch (Mendele Mocher Sforim), Sholem Aleichem, and I. L. Peretz, the three giants of Yiddish fiction. In discussing Abramovitsch, Frieden draws attention to the essential distinction between the author and his better-known pseudonym, Mendele the Book Peddler. According to Frieden, Abramovitsch employed this device to create distance and avoid criticism for having scrutinized the popular beliefs of his readers. As Frieden puts it, "Mendele's mock blessings emphasize the error of trusting blindly in divine providence, when the world so painfully confronts us with contradictory conditions.... He leads his readership from traditionalism to enlightenment, charting their course alongside Mendele's own journey toward a critical outlook in an ironic mode" (p. 91). I should note that Frieden is not a formalist, since he does draw</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 319 upon crucial historical, political, social, and religious sources to buttress his arguments. Proceeding chronologically, and with an eye to Mendele's development from pure social critic to satiric/parodic novelist, Frieden focuses on Dos kleyne mentchele ("The Little Man," 1864), Dos vintchfingerl ("The Magic Ring," 1865), Fishke der krumer ("Fishke the Lame," 1869), Di takse ("The Tax," 1869), Di klyatsche ("The Mare," 1873), and finally, the one best-known to readers of English, Kitser masoes Binyomin hashlishi ("The Travels of Benjamin the Third," 1878). In his discussion of Mendele, Frieden provides many valuable insights into some rarely discussed works of the Yiddish canon. Thanks, perhaps, to his book and the one by Roskies, a Mendele renaissance seems to be underway, what with the impending publication of his novellas and short stories by Schocken's Library of Yiddish Classics. (Sholem Aleichem and Peretz have already been featured in this great series edited by Ruth Wisse.) Frieden uses a similar methodology in the Sholem Aleichem chapter: identify the literary and nonliterary forces that shaped his artistic career, then follow up with a discussion of representative works to illuminate the thesis. An important contribution here is Frieden's assertion that Stempenyu, an early, perhaps ground-breaking work, is in fact a spoof of the typical European romance genre: "Stempenyu is a kind of Jewish Casanova who breaks hearts in every town" (p. 147). But, more importantly, we learn that Sholem Aleichem's "Jewish Novels" were intentionally designed to break with conventions of European romance, for "even when they verge on becoming love stories, their predominant goal is satire rather than seduction" (p. 141). This, I believe, is the first time Sholem Aleichem has been viewed primarily from a European literary perspective, a totally valid approach considering the wealth of non-Jewish, non-Mendele sources flowing into his creative process. The tension between the urge to produce literary realism/social reformative types of texts and the equally powerful drive toward surrealistic, fantastic literature is well documented in this study. Those familiar with the literature know that this conflict did not cease with Sholem Aleichem but persisted with many Yiddish writers of later generations. Frieden's choice of works in this chapter is understandable; the Tevye episodes and the famous "Railroad Stories" are perfect illustrations of the kind of rhetorical aesthetic he attributes to the master of the Jewish tale. In a bold move, Frieden confronts some prevailing opinions (Halkin, Harshav, Miron) on Tevye's much-debated quotations, offering this view: "these quotations are</page><page sequence="3">320 BOOK REVIEWS a sophisticated literary device by which Sholem Aleichem chips away at the simple mimetic illusion" (p. 166). I believe that more than one approach can be used to explain this aspect of Tevye's character. On the whole, Frieden's aesthetic formulations are applicable to the works cited, but those who know the entire Sholem Aleichem fictional corpus may wish that he had dealt with lesser-known, if not superior, works. I am alluding, of course, to Kasrilevke, In the Storm, Menachem Mendl, and The Hoax. These novels are different from Tevye and the Railroad cycle, and require serious treatment, perhaps in a more extended study of Sholem Aleichem's fiction. While Mendele and Sholem Aleichem were clearly the founders and masters of Yiddish narrative fiction, Peretz was unquestionably the intellectual "Tzaddik" of his time. He was a guide to countless aspiring writers, a strong voice in the Jewish community at large, and a respected figure in Polish intellectual circles. He was a man who aspired to become a Polish writer, toyed with socialism, spent several months in prison for subversive activities, and practiced law for a living. Of course, he was also a man who fought in the fierce language battles about whether Hebrew or Yiddish was the Jewish national language, a social scientist who undertook a long journey through the Polish countryside and wrote about it in great detail, and a collector of hundreds of Jewish folktales, eventually "Farperetzt," rewritten in the unique Peretz style and brought out as Folkstimleche geshichtn ("Folk Stories"), and Hasidish. Though not covered by Frieden, Peretz's fiction encompasses some fine poetry and drama. In formulating Peretz's aesthetic, Frieden points to a combination of modernistic taste, romantic bent, and "improvisatory style expressing his impulsiveness" (p. 256). Drawing on Shmuel Niger's work on Peretz, Frieden manages to capture the essence of this complex, even paradoxical, Jewish writer. As he rightly points out, it seems that Peretz chose short literary forms-the essay, the short story, the one-act play-because they suited his highly polemical writings on a host of social problems. Thus, in the stories he employs irony and fantasy to address issues like corruption among the laity, cynicism among the enlightened, and self-righteousness among the pious. While in the earlier chapters Frieden is occasionally adventurous, in the Peretz section he stays solidly on the beaten path. But he avoids being repetitious. In fact, he is surprisingly at his best when he skillfully integrates the work of his predecessors into a smooth, concise, narrative. Ruth Wisse's excellent Peretz studies, I. L. Peretz and the Making of Modern Jewish Culture, and her introduction to the I. L. Peretz Reader no doubt paved</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 321 the road to a better understanding of this writer in his sociopolitical milieu. Frieden builds on this scholarship, contextualizing it within the framework of the three Yiddish classics as well as the wider parameters of modem Jewish culture and literature. Classic Yiddish Fiction is unique for its comprehensive view of the field, its solid critical foundations, and its exhaustive bibliographical information. While we have much cause to celebrate Frieden's book, it is sad to reflect that the dwindling number of Yiddishists may mean that it is the last scholarly endeavor of its kind. Let anyone who believes otherwise remember the title of Peretz's short story: "Az men zogt meshuge, gleyb" "If they tell you you're crazy, believe it." Michael Taub New York, N.Y.</page></plain_text>
