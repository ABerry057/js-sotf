DALIN Introduction For close to fifty years, Cyrus Adler was one of American Jewry's most influential communal leaders and public servants. Taking part in the found- ing of the Jewish Publication Society (1888), on whose various committees he would serve as chairman throughout his life, Adler was a founder of the American Jewish Historical Society (1892), and its president for more than twenty years. Together with Louis Marshall, Jacob Schiff, Oscar Straus, Felix Warburg, and his cousin, Judge Mayer Sulzberger, Adler played an instrumental role in organizing the American Jewish Committee (1906), and served as its president from 1929 until his death in 1940. During his thirty- two years (1908-1940) as president and chief administrative officer of the Dropsie College for Hebrew and Cognate Learning, Adler shaped the insti- tution into one of the preeminent institutions of higher Jewish learning in America. When Solomon Schechter died in 1915, Adler succeeded him to the presidency of the Jewish Theological Seminary, with which he had been 55</page><page sequence="2">56 DAVID G. DALIN closely associated since its founding in 1886, while remaining president of Dropsie as well. Serving as president of the seminary for twenty-five years, Adler played a central role in the founding of the United Synagogue, whose presidency he also held. As such, it can be said without exaggeration that Adler was one of the most influential leaders and important personalities in the Conservative movement. During his distinguished public career, which spanned half a century, the one Jewish public cause in which Adler did not take a leadership role was that of Zionism. As Simcha Kling has so aptly noted, "whenever the rela- tionship between Conservative Judaism and Zionism is discussed, it is always pointed out that the latter has been an integral part of the former since its inception and even before . . . except for Cyrus Adler."' Adler's non-Zionism was a product of a number of factors, one of which was certainly his unique environment and upbringing. Unlike so many Jewish leaders of his generation, Adler's roots were not in Eastern Europe, but rather in the American South. Born in Van Buren, Arkansas, in 1863, while the Civil War still raged, Adler would throughout his public career be, first and foremost, a proud and patriotic American, for whom the specter of dual loyalty would always be anathema. For Adler, who revered and studied Thomas Jefferson as he did the ancient rabbis,2 and who spent close to twenty years as an official of the U.S. government, the political Zionism formulated by Theodor Herzl at the first Zionist Congress in Basle in 1897 posed the potential threat of "strings" to his allegiance as an American citizen, to which he would always be sensitive. Adler's non-Zionism was, as we shall suggest, predicated upon his vigorous opposition to Herzlian political Zionism, which envisioned the I would like to thank Professors Ismar Schorsch, Paula Hyman, and Jonathan D.

While recognizing that Palestine held a unique historical and religious significance for world Jewry, Adler felt that to affirm the creation of a separate Jewish state and nationality would endanger the rights secured by Jews in America and throughout the emancipated world, and create a problem of dual loyalty. A fundamental difference between Zionists and non-Zionists such as Adler centered on the question of "whether the Jews need a separate State to survive or not; whether the place of the Jews in the spiritual unfolding of mankind is the whole world or delimited to Palestine as a distinct political entity."3 Adler and other non-Zionists in the years prior to World War I considered large-scale Jewish immigration to Pales- tine-a central objective of the Zionist program-politically futile as long as the Ottoman Empire ruled Palestine. While they did not regard mass Jewish immigration to Palestine as practical or even desirable during this (pre-1917) period, they did appreciate the urgency of having a haven for the persecuted Jews of Eastern Europe. Therefore, as we shall discuss in some detail in this study, Adler and other non-Zionist leaders were actively involved in investigating Jewish immigration and colonization possibilities in other lands. After World War I, non-Zionists such as Adler recognized that with the defeat of the Ottoman Turks and the beginnings of the British Mandate, a part of the Jewish people could migrate to Palestine, but they maintained that the majority of Jews would stay in America and other countries wherein they enjoyed equal civil and religious rights.4 And yet, in the aftermath of the Balfour Declaration, as we shall suggest in this study, Adler became increasingly receptive to the nonpolitical aspects of the Zionist program, and to cooperation between the Zionist movement and non-Zionist leaders like himself. Adler was a non-Zionist rather than an anti-Zionist, in that he supported the Balfour Declaration, which "viewed with favour" the establishment of a Jewish "home" or homeland in Palestine, rather than the Herzlian objective of a politically secured Jewish state. For non-Zionist leaders, "Palestine was to be 'a' rather than 'the' national home, a cultural and social but never a political structure."5 This distinction between a Jewish home for those who wished it and the politically sovereign state of the Jewish people was a crucial one for defining 3.

Ibid., p. 22.</page><page sequence="4">58 DAVID G. DALIN the parameters of, and differences between, non-Zionism and anti-Zionism. Non-Zionists such as Adler were committed to the Balfour Declaration and its nonpolitical ramifications, and were ready to support Zionist work in Palestine without sharing its political aims, a commitment that anti-Zionists were never ready to make. In contrast, the anti-Zionists, from whom Adler would carefully dissassociate himself, rejected the Balfour Declaration outright, and stubbornly refused to cooperate with both Zionists and non- Zionists in their shared nonpolitical endeavors for the expansion of the Jewish Agency, and for the building and development of Palestine, during the 1920s. Stuart E. Knee's definition of non-Zionism as opposition to a Jewish state but not to "Jewish immigration to Palestine, or [to] the revival there of religio-cultural Judaism"6 would accurately characterize the position of Cyrus Adler after 1917. While remaining opposed to the reestablishment of Jewish political sovereignty in Palestine, Adler, as a non-Zionist, was ready to cooperate with those within the Zionist movement who sought "to estab- lish in Palestine a center for Judaism, for the stimulation of our faith, for the pursuit and development of literature, science and art in a Jewish environ- ment, and for the rehabilitation of the land."7 Thus, as we shall note, Adler and his non-Zionist colleagues were not only ready to cooperate with the Zionist leadership in fostering the economic development of Palestine, but were increasingly ready to actively cooperate in promoting the growth and development of agricultural, scientific, charitable, and educational institu- tions in Palestine. In their willingness to work closely together with the Zionist movement for the rehabilitation of Palestine, it can be argued, the non-Zionists were much closer to the Zionist leadership than to its virulent- ly anti-Zionist opponents. Adler had long viewed Palestine as the spiritual center, or home, of world Jewry. He and other non-Zionists favored the creation of a Jewish cultural center in Palestine, at least in part, because "they were concerned with the cultural and spiritual predicament of American Jews facing assimi- lation."" In this respect, as more than one scholar has suggested, Adler was influenced by the cultural Zionism of Ahad Ha-Am, whose conception of 5. Ibid. 6. Stuard N.

Non-Zionism, for Adler, was predicated in part upon the belief that Jewish spiritual and cultural creativity and survival were possible in Palestine as well as in the American Diaspora, an assumption that the anti-Zionist leadership of American Reform Judaism were (prior to the mid-1930s) unwilling to accept. Anti-Zionists, as Richard K. Harkavy has noted, refused to even acknowledge the possibility that a Jewish cultural center in Palestine might benefit American Jewry. To do so, they believed, "would be an admittance that Jewish life in the diaspora was a failure."9 Non-Zionists like Adler, however, as Harkavy has so aptly put it, differed from the leadership of the Zionist movement in that they envisioned a Jewish cultural center in Palestine as "enriching Jewish life everywhere but not replacing it."'I Adler's steadfast non-Zionism was undoubtedly shaped in part by the German-Jewish world in which he was raised and lived. For Cyrus Adler, who was on his mother's side a Sulzberger, had been born into one of the leading families of American Jewry's German-Jewish upper class. Moving to Philadelphia from Arkansas after his father's death, Cyrus Adler grew up comfortably in the rarefied world of the German-Jewish aristocracy of which his uncle David Sulzberger and his cousin, the prominent Phila- delphia jurist and Jewish communal leader Mayer Sulzberger, were so much a part. The attitudes and prejudices of this Jewish world of wealth and privilege, so far separated from the very different world and culture of the Eastern European Jewish immigrant masses, whom Adler never really iden- tified with or understood, were shared by Adler throughout his career in Jewish public life. Adler was a pivotal and unique member of the "Our Crowd" German- Jewish leadership group, comprising such influential Jewish figures as Schiff, Marshall, Mayer and Cyrus Sulzberger, Oscar and Nathan Straus, Harry and Herbert Friedenwald, Daniel Guggenheim, and Judah L. Magnes, to name but a few, who organized the American Jewish Committee and who would exercise a profound and far-reaching influence on the direc- tion and reorganization of American Jewish communal life from the end of the nineteenth century through the first three decades of the" twentieth. In the eyes of many East European Jews, especially those identifying with the 9. Ibid., p. 23. 10. Ibid., p. 162.</page><page sequence="6">60 DAVID G. DALIN Zionist movement, Adler and his "uptown" colleagues of the American Jewish Committee represented the personification of shtadlanut and non- Zionism in American Jewish public life. And yet, Adler was in many respects a unique, as well as a representa- tive, figure within this German-Jewish leadership group. Adler's success as one of the preeminent Jewish public servants of his era lay in his unique ability to bridge worlds which early in the twentieth century had little common ground. A religiously observant Jew, knowledgeable in the field of Jewish scholarship, he was also well-known and respected in the world of American government and scholarship. To cite but one example, his dis- covery, while an officer of the American Philosophical Society, of the so- called Jefferson Bible created a scholarly sensation even before its publica- tion, with an introduction by Adler, in 1904," at the express authorization of Congress. Having achieved a distinguished record of twenty years of governmental service in Washington, D.C., during which time, as assistant secretary of the Smithsonian National Museum, he held one of the highest appointive political offices ever occupied by a Jew in the United States, Adler enjoyed the respect and "ear" of senators and presidents in each administration from Theodore Roosevelt to Franklin Roosevelt. A tireless communal leader and a creative and constructive administrator, Adler was uniquely able to interpret the needs of the traditional-minded Jews to the men of wealth and influence in American Jewry. Indeed, even those who disagreed with Adler over a number of issues, Zionism included, never questioned his devotion to Judaism nor denied that his views should be given the most serious consideration. And yet, his aloofness from Zionism and steadfast opposition to the democratization of American Jewish public life limited his relations with those to whom he was closest in his observance of Judaism. Almost alone amongst the leaders of the Conservative movement of his generation, Adler refused to identify with the cause of political Zionism or to join the ranks of the Zionist movement. Adler remained, to the amazement of many, a committed non-Zionist, a true lover of Zion who remained continuously distrustful of the Zionist movement.

Such a critical study, I believe, is long overdue. Ira Robinson's excellent new edition of Adler's correspondence has pro- vided us with much new material relevant to a critical study of the subject.13 It is my hope that the following examination of Adler's complex attitudes and relationship to Zionism will contribute, in some small way, to a better understanding and appreciation of what is perhaps the most puzzling and inexplicable chapter in the public life of one of twentieth-century American Jewry's most significant communal servants. The Beginnings of Non-Zionism: Adler, Herzl, and the Mesopotamian Plan Upon convening the first Zionist Congress in Basle in 1897, Theodor Herzl and his fellow leaders of the emerging Zionist movement had announced their objective "to secure for the Jewish people a publicly recog- nized, legally secured home in Palestine." The Basle program generated heated public debate and controversy within the American Jewish leader- ship circles of which Adler was a part. Looking, as always, at the "practical" aspects of the problem, Adler was doubtful whether Palestine with its limited resources could indeed solve the Jewish refugee problem or whether Jewish immigration into Palestine would even be allowed by the Turks. Adler recommended an alternative haven for the persecuted Jews of Eastern Europe: Syria and Mesopotamia. Adler had been considering such a "non-Zionist" scheme for the coloni- zation of Mesopotamia since the early 1890s, when he had first visited the Near East on a special assignment for the United States government. In 1887, following the completion of his Ph.D. in Semitics at Johns Hopkins, Adler had been appointed curator of the Department of Oriental Antiquities at the Smithsonian National Museum. In 1888, as an official of the National Museum and representative of the United States government, Adler had arranged an exhibit on biblical archaeology and Palestinian objects at the 12.

DALIN Centennial Exposition of the Ohio Valley, which was followed soon there- after by a series of exhibitions which he arranged for the United States government in Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis. When it was proposed to celebrate the four-hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America with an International Exposition in Chicago in 1892, President Benjamin Harrison appointed Adler special commissioner of the Columbian Exposi- tion. In this capacity, Adler traveled to Turkey, Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Syria (and later to Palestine), to secure exhibits and to present the official invitations to the countries and secure their active participation. His travels as special commissioner were a "striking success." In each of the countries he visited, great interest was developed in the Columbian Exposition. Governments, as well as manufacturers and merchants, "were induced to subscribe the necessary funds" to assure the representation of their native industries and cultural enterprises at the exposition.14 The presi- dential appointment as commissioner was, moreover, a "singular distinc- tion" for Adler, who, as a young government official, was just embarking on the first chapter of a distinguished public career in Washington during which time he would earn a national reputation based on the extraordinary talent for adminstration, creative planning, and practical statesmanship that would later serve him in such good stead during his years as president of Dropsie College and the Jewish Theological Seminary. Equally important, as Louis Finkelstein has recently pointed out, wherever Adler went on his fifteen-month journey throughout the Near East, "he sought out the Jewish community and its leaders, discovering the sufferings under which so many Jews lived."'5 During the seven months he spent in Constantinople, Adler became friendly with the grand vizier, Kiamil Pasha, and had the opportunity to discuss with him "the part that Turkey might play in the solution of the Jewish problem."'6 More conscious than ever of the oppression of the Jews of Russia and of their need for a refuge, Adler sought permission from Kiamil Pasha and the Turkish govern- ment to allow mass Jewish immigration to Palestine. Kiamil Pasha argued that Syria and Mesopotamia would be more "practical" havens for the Jews of Europe, an apparently convincing argument that Adler soon began to espouse. In 1892, Professor Paul Haupt, the eminent Assyriologist of Johns 14. Neuman, Cyrus Adler, p. 34. 15. Louis Finkelstein, Preface to Robinson, Cyrus Adler Letters, p. 5. 16. Neuman, Cyrus Adler, p. 36.</page><page sequence="9">CYRUS ADLER, NON-ZIONISM, AND THE ZIONIST MOVEMENT 63 Hopkins University and Adler's dissertation adviser and close friend, published a pamphlet advocating the same "Mesopotamian plan" for the resettlement and colonization of Russian Jews."7 At Adler's suggestion Haupt, who had earlier studied Mesopotamia as a region for possible German colonization at the request of Bismarck, met with Oscar Straus and Mayer Sulzberger, who shared Adler's interest in the plan. The Mesopo- tamia scheme, conceived several years prior to the first Zionist Congress in 1897 and later referred to as the "Cyrus Adler plan" by Theodor Herzl,'8 was predicated upon the non-Zionist assumption that "the best region for the settlement of the Russian Jews ... undoubtedly" was Mesopotamia and Syria rather than Palestine. Adler's dedication to this plan, which led to his rift with Herzl, helps to explain, in some measure, his nonsupport for the first Zionist Congress' Basle Program and for the early goals of political Zionism. It is more than a little surprising that in his autobiography Adler does not record the fact that in 1896, after "consultation with Mayer Sulzberger and Oscar Straus," he initiated correspondence with Herzl, wherein he outlined his program for the settlement of East European Jewry in Mesopo- tamia and Syria rather than in Palestine. Nor does Adler discuss, in either of his two published books, the relevant fact that he enclosed copies of Haupt's pamphlet with his letter to Herzl, and that, much to his chagrin, Herzl failed to respond to his letter for more than two years. Adler's letter to Herzl is worth quoting in its entirety. Recognizing the fact that more than half of the Jews of the world are now living in countries in which they are regarded as aliens and subjected to the most degrading political, social and economic restrictions, I have become convinced that in the next century a series of very considerable migrations will be rendered necessary. Various organizations are now engaged in colonization in Palestine and Argentina and these I think should be advised to proceed along the lines they have hitherto followed. I do not think that a large percentage of immigration to Palestine should now be encouraged as I feel sure that the country is not able to absorb people rapidly, and besides it would probably raise such oppo- sition on the part of orthodox Christians as to bring about expulsion of such as are already settled there. 17.

DALIN Judging from what I have heard you have larger plans in mind and I accordingly invite your attention to two countries in Western Asia- Mesopotamia and Syria-both of which in my opinion should be seriously considered. I take the liberty of sending under separate cover several copies of a plan for colonization in Mesopotamia which was carefully worked out some years ago. I have reason to think that you may find agencies among pro- minent persons in Paris which would assist in colonization in Syria. When in Beirut some years ago, I met with a gentleman who had acquired large tracts of land as an agent for persons in Paris with the view of Jewish settlement. Mesopotamia offers the greatest facilities. Besides it has more than once been the home of the children of Israel, where they acquired the discipline and rehabilitation which enabled them to reconstruct their nationality. Both reli- gious sentiment and Biblical precedent would favor the repetition of this plan. There are practicable reasons for it rather than a settlement in Palestine which would encounter opposition at the start and prevent colonization from strengthening itself sufficiently to acquire power and permanency to build up and maintain itself. A large part of the lands belong to the Turkish Crown and could be purchased directly from the Sultan. It would be to his interest to have a strong, thrifty and aggressive population settled there. A sine qua non in the case of all persons settling in any part of the Ottoman Dominions should be their willingness to give up their previous subjection or citizenship. In making these suggestions I wish you would understand that I am speak- ing only for myself and for a few of my friends, some, I may add, of distin- guished political and diplomatic experience a conference with whom suggested this communication. My letter should not be construed as implying anything more than it explicitly says. I would say however that there is no official Jewish opinion in this country, as you probably know, although a number of rabbis more particularly of Reformed congregations have condemned your proposed conference in advance. But such opposition or disapproval, I would characterize as being rather individual opinions than in any sense representa- tive either of the Jews in this country of much influence who would be glad to see some extensive plan of colonization in the east established and they are not without hope that eventually an independent state might grow up. All of this should be left to the slow operation of time but it may well be aided by intelli- gent and statesmanlike action. Should the Conference see fit to entertain the notion of colonizing either in Syria or Mesopotamia I should be glad to know of it and I may be able to put you in the way of some useful suggestions. I have no desire to appear in this matter and you can if you wish make any of these suggestions on your own initiative. On the other hand I have not the slightest objection to the use of my name.</page><page sequence="11">CYRUS ADLER, NON-ZIONISM, AND THE ZIONIST MOVEMENT 65 I am living in the country of my birth, am sincerely attached to it, and feel neither the desire nor need to change it. But I cannot forget the fact that more than half of the men of my faith and blood are being subjected to a daily mental torture which in the end will have results more horrible than death. That they should leave the countries in which they are persecuted becomes a necessity. That they should turn to the East is natural. That their brethren in more favored lands should guide and assist them is but a duty. That they may have many hardships I can well believe. But it is better to perish in a noble struggle than to live a life of servitude. If you and your confreres can form a plan which will realize this end then those who now call you visionaries and dreamers will learn that it is of such that leaders are born. My hope is that the wisdom of your body will be equal to its singleness of purpose-that you will do all things slowly-and that no matter what discour- agements come in your path you will be strong and of good courage.,9 Herzl may, as Abraham A. Neuman has speculated,20 have been too much preoccupied with the preparations for the first Zionist Congress and "too little informed" about American Jewry and its leadership to take seriously the communication of an "unknown" correspondent; nor, proba- bly, did he recognize the potential diplomatic and financial resources which American Jewish leaders such as Adler, Sulzberger, Straus, and their asso- ciates might have lent in support of the emerging movement for political Zionism. Whatever the explanation, Adler never received an acknowledg- ment of this letter to Herzl. It was not until two years later, toward the end of 1899, that he did get a message from Herzl, forwarded by Professor Richard Gottheil of Columbia University, the first president of the Federa- tion of American Zionists. By this time, however, Adler had already become unequivocally opposed to the political Zionism that Herzl and his col- leagues at Basle espoused. Thus, in response to Herzl's belated correspon- dence, Adler wrote the following cold reply: Before the first Congress at Basle, I took the liberty of forwarding a copy of the same document to you together with a memorandum on the subject, of which I also send you a copy. I am bound to say in all frankness to you, there- fore, that since the various Congresses have met and the Zionist programme has been formulated, my judgement has led me away from believing in the 19.

DALIN success of the plans thus far announced. I consider a "publicly, legally guaran- teed home" for the Jews in the Ottoman Empire an impossibility and I further believe that any guarantee given would be valueless.21 These letters are obviously of historical import. Strangely ignored by many historians of American Zionism, the Adler-Herzl letters are signifi- cant historical documents for analyzing and illuminating the emerging non- Zionist opposition of Cyrus Adler, Mayer Sulzberger, Oscar Straus, and their circle to the political Zionism of Herzl. The fact that Adler did not refer to them in either of his two principal books--especially in his autobio- graphy, I Have Considered the Days-has both fascinated and perplexed scholars who have previously sought to analyze Adler's public career and evolving attitudes toward Zionism. Not the least interesting aspect of these letters, as Herbert Parzen has noted, is "that they contain the full arsenal of arguments" employed by non-Zionists and Zionists alike, including the non-Zionist slogan of Jewish colonization anywhere but not in Palestine.22 Adler, moreover, was a prolific correspondent who was not used to having his advice and counsel go unheeded. He was understandably "miffed" by Herzl's failure to even acknowledge his letter, a fact that may have helped shape his emerging opposition to the leadership and tactics of the Zionist movement. The intervening years between Adler's first and second com- munications with Herzl, whom Adler would never meet, had created a wide and seemingly unbridgeable chasm between Herzl and the American non- Zionist leadership that Adler, Sulzberger, and Straus represented. His second letter to Herzl marks the beginning of Adler's public opposi- tion to the kind of political Zionism that Herzl envisioned. It is in this response to Herzl's letter that Adler made a clean break with political Zionism, citing the practical objections to the fulfillment of the Zionist program that he had come to share with other prominent non-Zionist leaders of the American Jewish community. Indeed, Adler's letter to Herzl may well be considered the first public articulation of the emerging Ameri- can Jewish non-Zionist position, for which Adler would remain one of the most unrelenting spokesmen for the next twenty-five years. 21.

In so doing, he alienated, perhaps inadver- tently, the most politically influential leadership group within American Jewry, which, by 1899, had become increasingly inimical to political Zionism. For while, as Adler admitted to Herzl, he was only speaking for himself and "for a few of my friends," it was indeed a group with "distin- guished political and diplomatic experience," not to mention political clout, for whom he spoke. Oscar Straus, who was (from 1898 to 1900) serving his second stint as United States minister to Turkey, and would, in 1906, become the first American Jew appointed to a cabinet post, enjoyed easy entry into government circles and the "ear" of the president and his administration. And Sulzberger, who had been elected to the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas on the Republican ticket, was, together with his friend and political confidant Louis Marshall, one of the pillars of the Republican party at the very time that the leadership of the nascent Zionist movement was beginning to seek political support within high circles in Washington and London in order to further the Zionist program and objec- tives. During a period in which the Republican party was in power in the United States, their active support for, and participation in, the Zionist movement would have been invaluable. Of all the lands proposed for Jewish settlement during the decade fol- lowing the first Zionist Congress in 1897, Mesopotamia most intrigued the American Jewish leadership group of which Adler, Sulzberger, and Straus were a part. Strategically situated between Africa and Asia, historically the birthplace of Abraham, Mesopotamia was repeatedly noted as a desirable alternative to Palestine by the non-Zionist leadership in the United States. Adler, Straus, Sulzberger, and Jacob Schiff continued to advocate the "Cyrus Adler plan" for the Jewish colonization of Mesopotamia for several years following Adler's second letter to Theodor Herzl. In 1903, when Turkey granted a concession permitting the extension of the Berlin-to- Bagdad Railway down to the Persian Gulf, Adler and Straus recognized the implications the railway would have in world politics and the implications it could have for Jewish settlement. Straus and Adler alerted Jacob Schiff to the possibility of opening up Mesopotamia for colonization in conjunction with the railway, especially if Jewish bankers participated in financing the project. Since Schiff's friend, the British financier Sir Ernest Cassel was also interested in the railroad, Schiff subsequently sent him information on the</page><page sequence="14">68 DAVID G. DALIN Haupt-Adler scheme.23 As late as 1909, as Naomi W. Cohen has noted, Adler, Schiff, and other members of the Executive of the American Jewish Committee met with Straus just prior to his departure for Constantinople, where he was to begin his third tour of duty as American ambassador, to discuss the details of a Mesopotamian settlement.24 By that time, however, in the aftermath of the Turkish Revolution of 1908, "realities mitigated against success." The new Turkish government, under the influence of the nationalistic policies of the newly entrenched Young Turks, increasingly discouraged Jewish immigration to all parts of the Ottoman Empire. Conservative Judaism and Zionism: The Position of Cyrus Adler When his close friend Solomon Schechter joined the ranks of the Zionist movement in 1906, Cyrus Adler alone amongst the leadership of the Conser- vative movement remained inimical to the Zionist cause. From its earliest days, even before it had become a distinct movement, the leadership of Conservative Judaism had "wholeheartedly embraced the Zionist idea."25 As Moshe Davis has pointed out, Zionism was "an integral part of the program of thought and action" which the Historical School developed in the closing years of the last century and which it "transmitted" to the Conservative movement.26 With Herzl's call for the first Zionist Congress in 1897, most members of the Historical School participated actively in Zionist affairs. Marcus Jastrow, for example, took "a very deep interest" in the Zionist movement and was elected vice-president of the Federation of American Zionists.27 Benjamin Szold's active participation in Zionist societies is, as Moshe Davis notes, documented in the American Hebrew press of the 1890s.28 The first intercollegiate Zionist society, the Young 23.

Indeed, upon his arrival in America in 1902, Schechter had gone so far as to state that "Zionism divorced from the religious idea is a menace." However, Schechter could not long resist the "cherished dream of Zionism," although he recognized that "the dream was not without its nightmares."30 In an essay explaining his decision to join the Federation of American Zionists in 1906, he wrote: "To me, personally, after long hesitation and careful watching Zionism recommended itself to me as the great bulwark against assimilation. .... Zionism ... is the Declaration of Jewish Independence from all kinds of slavery whether material or spiritual.""' Many years later Louis Lipsky would comment: "It was Dr. Schechter ... who made the Jewish Theological Seminary an insti- tution for the graduation not only of Rabbis, but also of Zionists. Without exception, its Rabbis ... have carried the message of Zionism to all parts of America."32 Indeed, a study of seminary alumni indicates that in 1914, the last year of Schechter's presidency, over 60 percent of the graduates of the seminary's rabbinical school were active and self-declared Zionists.33 The leading members of the seminary faculty brought in by Schechter-Louis Ginzberg, Israel Friedlaender, Israel Davidson, and Mordecai M. Kap- lan-were all Zionists.34 Indeed, with the encouragement of Schechter, Professors Friedlaender and Kaplan became the "chief proponents" of Ahad Ha-Am's cultural Zionism, which they adapted to the American 29.

DALIN scene.35 It was, perhaps, Professor Louis Ginzberg who most succinctly enunciated the prevailing attitude toward Zionism of most of his colleagues on the seminary faculty and within the Conservative rabbinate, when he said: "Jewish nationalism without religion would be a tree without fruit, Jewish religion without Jewish nationalism would be a tree without roots."36 With the death of Solomon Schechter in 1915, Cyrus Adler became acting president of the seminary and president of the United Syangogue. As such, as we noted earlier, he was the acknowledged leader of the Conserva- tive movement. He was at the same time, however, the only leader of Conservative Judaism to remain outside the ranks of the Zionist movement. On the issue of Zionism, Adler found himself in the paradoxical situation of being on the side of Reform, "on the side of the religious party that had repudiated the religious tenets which he strove to maintain all his life."37 On the other hand, his own colleagues in the institutions of the Conservative movement were to be found in "the ranks of the Zionist party" to which he was strenuously opposed. His continued and vocal antipathy to political Zionism through the mid-1920s remained, for many within the Conserva- tive movement, an inexplicable contradiction which they were unable to empathize with or understand. The extent of Adler's antipathy to political Zionism, and the friction that it generated within the Conservative movement, can be gauged by his role in a bitter controversy that shook the fifth annual convention of the United Synagogue of America, of which Adler was then president, in July 1917. Convened just four months prior to the issuance of the Balfour Declaration, at a time in which favorable Jewish public opinion was crucial for generat- ing official political support in Washington on behalf of the declaration, the convention proposed the following resolution: "Be it Resolved that the United Synagogue of America joins with the Zionists throughout the world in voicing the claim to a legally recognized and internationally secured homeland for the Jewish people in Palestine." Although an amendment to the resolution was immediately proposed substituting "Jews" for "Zion- ists," Adler stringently protested. I strongly object to this resolution, which I think is against the constitution of the United Synagogue. The constitution of the United Synagogue on the subject of Palestine has one phrase-to preserve in the service the reference to 35. Kling, "Zionism in the Early Days," p. 267. 36.

That is the agreement on that point that we reached when the United Synagogue was organized. I stand here representing a congregation which has never authorized me to vote in favor of the Basle programme. I shall not vote for it; I shall not be bound by it. This is a matter of principle and conscience which no vote can force upon a man. I shall not discuss the Zionist programme here. I may discuss it at some future time, when I consider it wise and pertinent to discuss it. But I submit that this is not the place nor is it proper that by a vote of this body I shall be put in a position of assenting to something to which I do not now assent.38 A second controversial issue debated at the United Synagogue conven- tion, involving representation at the sessions of the American Jewish Congress, led to Adler's resignation as president of the United Synagogue. As part of the struggle for control of Jewish organizational life, the creation of a congress had, of course, been a source of tension between the American Jewish Committee, of which the United Synagogue was an affiliate, and the leadership of the American Zionist movement. By the summer of 1917, Adler remained a bitter foe of the congress, while Louis Marshall and other prominent members of the American Jewish Committee had, in the spirit of communal compromise, come to accept the idea of the congress as a fact of Jewish organizational life. Indeed, at the annual meeting of the American Jewish Committee in November 1915, a resolution had been passed whereby Marshall and a majority of the leadership of the committee had decided to abandon their opposition and "switch over to the Congress movement." When this resolution was passed, Adler had "denounced the Congress movement as fraudulent" and declined to have his name considered for reelection as a member of the AJC's executive committee.39 The United Synagogue's decision was one with which Adler could not concur. Hence, when it was proposed by the delegates to the United Synagogue "that the Convention proceed to the election of a delegate to the American Jewish Congress," Adler immediately announced his opposition with the threat that he would resign his office if the resolution were approved. I rise to say that I am entirely opposed to that resolution or to the election of a delegate to the Congress from this body, and that I will not associate myself 38.

I desire to announce here that in no circumstances will I feel bound in any way by the act of that Congress.40 Despite Adler's dissent, the resolution was resoundingly passed. Professor Israel Friedlaender was elected as the delegate to the congress, and Adler adamantly refused to accept reelection to the presidency of the United Synagogue. Moreover, when the first meeting of the pro-Zionist American Jewish Congress was held in Philadelphia in December 1918, attended by most of the members of the American Jewish Committee, Adler and Felix Warburg, alone amongst the committee's membership, did not attend. Adler's uncompromising opposition to Zionism, as reflected in his minority dissent from the prevailing consensus at the United Synagogue convention, produced tensions between Adler and the seminary faculty, almost all of whom (as we noted earlier) were committed and outspoken cultural Zionists. It may, for example, it is reasonable to assume, have been one of the several sources of friction between Adler and Professor Louis Ginzberg, who, as acting president of the United Synagogue in 1919, urged greater participation in the very "Zionist enterprise" that Adler continued to heatedly oppose. I believe that the time has come when the United Synagogue should take an active part in the work for the restoration of Palestine. Most of the members of the United Synagogue, congregations as well as individuals, are enthusiastical- ly engaged in the kind of work, and it is high time that the voice of our organi- zation be heard in a matter so deeply affecting the spiritual life of the Jews.41 The uncompromising nature of Adler's persistent opposition to the Basle program and the political aims of Zionism, as evidenced by his behavior at the United Synagogue convention, seems especially inexplicable in compari- son with the mellowing attitude toward political Zionism being articulated by other prominent German-Jewish communal leaders, such as Louis Marshall and Jacob Schiff. In fact, the conventional interpretation that Adler's antipathy toward Zionism prior to the 1920s was shaped primarily by the attitudes of the Schiff-Marshall leadership group of which he was a part, and that, as Simcha Kling has tried to argue,42 he was in fact "a non- 40.

On the contrary: It can be argued on the basis of his newly published correspon- dence that by 1917 Adler's "non-Zionism" had become much more strin- gent and uncompromising than that of most of the other Jewish communal leaders in his social circle. Take, for example, Louis Marshall, Adler's confi- dant as chairman of the board of overseers of the Jewish Theological Seminary and longtime president of the American Jewish Committee. It was Marshall, as Jerome C. Rosenthal had correctly suggested, more than any other contemporary "uptown" German-Jewish leader, "who eloquently voiced . . . sympathy for the early Zionist efforts in the first decade of the twentieth century."43 Marshall, although agreeing with Adler in his opposi- tion to the Basle program and Jewish nationalism, was more open-minded with respect to the Zionist movement. During the first decade following the first Zionist Congress, "he had not so much opposed the movement as shown little interest in it because he thought it impractical."44 Unlike Adler, Marshall stressed that though "he was neither Zionist nor Jewish national- ist," he rejected the argument that Zionism was "incompatible with loyalty to America."45 It is also reasonable to assume that Marshall's close associa- tion with his brother-in-law, Judah L. Magnes, brought him into close contact with "the cultural Zionism of the American type" that was gaining increasing credence in American Zionist circles during the first decade of this century. Cultural Zionists such as Magnes, Harry Friedenwald, Schechter (after 1906), and especially Israel Friedlaender began "to reinter- pret Zionism in terms that were better suited to American Jewish realities," and to "create bridges" between themselves and Jewish leaders such as Marshall. Unlike Marshall, however, Adler remained curiously indifferent to their appeal, despite the fact that so many of these cultural Zionists were religious Jews like himself, and strongly identified with the goals and institu- tions of Conservative Judaism. Adler also remained antagonistic to political Zionism far longer than his friend and colleague Jacob Schiff, who until 1917 had been counted amongst the American Zionist movement's most vocal opponents. In December of that year, Schiff, the outstanding Jewish philanthropist of the era and one of 43. Jerome C.

DALIN the most influential patrons of the Jewish Theological Seminary, announced his readiness to join the Zionist movement. Writing to the future president of the Zionist Organization of America, Judge Julian Mack, Schiff stated that he had become convinced of the desirability to seek the establishment of a Jewish homeland-and logically this should be Palestine-where the Jewish people would be again enabled to develop under their own institutions and in their own atmosphere Jewish life and ideals in their purity, and become once more a center from which the Jews throughout the world could draw religious inspiration and Jewish cultural development.46 And yet, as Professor Evyatar Friesel has noted in his thoughtful analysis of the episode, Adler could not understand Schiff's dramatic "conversion" to the Zionist cause, and greeted it with critical skepticism, rather than with enthusiastic support. "When Zionism adopts Judaism," wrote Adler, "I believe a basis can be found on which all Jews will unite in promoting Jewish settlement in Palestine, but I would consider a settlement in Palestine on an anti- or non-religious basis the greatest misfortune that has happened to the Jews in modern times."47 Subsequently, when Judge Mack, in his first offi- cial act as president of the newly formed Zionist Organization of America, invited Schiff, Marshall, and Adler to become "Shekel paying" members of the organization, Adler alone amongst the trio refused to consider joining. "I cannot accept," Adler wrote to Mack at the time. "The Zionist pro- gramme as I am sure you know from our frequent conversations is not adequate to satisfy my Jewish views with regard to the restoration of Pales- tine."48 Also, Adler was on occasion less tolerant and understanding of Zionist leaders whom he did not respect or trust than other non-Zionist American Jewish leaders. Take, for example, his thoughts concerning the Anglo- Jewish Zionist leader Israel Zangwill, about which the recently published Adler letters shed much new light. In the aftermath of the seventh Zionist Congress, held in Basle in 1905, a faction within the Zionist movement that advocated acceptance of the British government's offer of a Jewish territory within the protectorate of East Africa broke off from the movement.

Adler's attitude to this program, however, in opposi- tion to that of such colleagues and friends as Oscar Straus and Mayer Sulz- berger (who were among Zangwill's leading supporters), was the same as his attitude toward Zionism-total rejection. Moreover, his correspondence with Israel Zangwill, whom Adler had known through his work with the Jewish Publication Society since the early 1890s, reveals that his attitude to Zangwill's leadership within the Jewish community, and to Zangwill per- sonally, was more antagonistic than one would ever imagine from reading the comments on Zangwill in Adler's two published books. Adler wrote to Zangwill on November 1, 1905, in part as follows: In replying to your letter, I shall speak with the absolute frankness which its importance demands. I cannot recognize that you are a fitting leader in Israel and I cannot follow your leadership. Critic, poet, novelist and dramatist you are, and, as such, I have admired you ... but at no time in all our contact have I ever taken you seriously as a leader in Israel or even suspected that you took yourself seriously. Your whole trend as a literary man dealing with Jewish things has been to project yourself outside of your own people in order that you might the better see them, and it seems to me that your habitual thought and your habitual life should have suggested to you, were your powers of introspection as great as your faculty of observation, that to other hands must be left the captaincy of the Jewish people.49 Adler's heretofore unpublished correspondence with Zangwill is, to say the least, distinctly at variance with the praise in which he eulogized Zangwill in an address delivered at a memorial meeting for Zangwill in 1926, and reprinted in Adler's Lectures, Selected Papers, Addresses, pub- lished in 1933.50 It is similarly at variance with his more tolerant and under- standing assessment of Zangwill in his autobiography. His uncompromis- ingly hostile attitude to Zangwill and the program he espoused, as his correspondence with Oscar Straus indicates, came as a source of surprise and concern to some of his more tolerant non-Zionist colleagues. Straus wrote to Adler, expressing surprise and apparent displeasure at the "rude- ness and insulting tone" toward Zangwill conveyed by Adler in the above 49.

Adler responded to Straus, justifying his attitude toward Zangwill as follows: You speak of my rudeness and insulting tone toward Zangwill. I think that neither of these charges are justified. . . . I considered my letter to Zangwill for several days and toned down as much as I could consistent with my telling him what I understood to be the truth. I might have told him that he was incapaci- tated on many grounds from being a leader . . . because he was a traitor-a traitor to Herzl and a traitor to the Jewish people.... I, too, am in earnest about this territorialist organization and I believe that its final or partial success would be a greater disaster than was brought by Shabbati Zevi. It is more likely to end as did the Ararat project of Mordecai M. Noah, and so I am all the sorrier to see men of standing and sobriety asso- ciated with it.5~ The paradoxical nature of Adler's relationship to Zionism has been noted by most students of Adler's public career. It can be said, without exaggeration, that Adler's attitude to Zionism and the Zionist movement was a study in contradictions. Adler's staunch opposition-indeed antipathy-to political Zionism prior to the 1920s was more uncompromis- ing, and continued far longer, than that of his non-Zionist colleagues, such as Schiff, Straus, and Marshall. And yet, there were limits to the extent and vituperation of Adler's non-Zionism. In October 1918, to cite but one example, Adler "unconditionally refused" to join in sponsoring a public meeting "in opposition to the Zionist Movement" being organized by Dr. David Philipson of Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati. Philipson and a group of Reform rabbis, all "rabid anti-Zionists," had called this meeting at a time when Zionism was at the "pinnacle of triumph" in the aftermath of the Balfour Declaration, issued the previous November. Forever the staunch non-Zionist, Adler refused to associate himself with the tactics and assumptions of the more virulently anti-Zionist forces within the Reform movement, led by Philipson and Hebrew Union College President Kauf- mann Kohler of Cincinnati.52 Schiff, Marshall, Oscar Straus, and Henry 51.

First, Chaim Weizmann and other Zionist leaders began to play down the ideology of Jewish nationalism and to stress "practical projects to meet the challenge of transforming deserts and swamps into an economically sound country." The growing realization that Palestine remained the one land of refuge open to Jewish victims of persecution was another factor. While, as Naomi W. Cohen has noted, Adler, Marshall, and their non-Zionist colleagues could never support the Zionist argument "which denied any possibility of meaningful Jewish survival in the Diaspora," and would never actively encourage American Jewish emigration to Palestine, they did "recognize in Palestine a haven for East European Jewry."54 Finally, following the Balfour Declaration, the United States government, through the Wilson administration, had official- ly approved the establishment of a Jewish homeland, an especially impor- tant consideration for the politically influential and sophisticated non- Zionist leadership group to which Adler belonged. The Zionist vs. non-Zionist debates of a decade earlier no longer held any meaning, since the Balfour Declaration and the Mandate had raised the dream of a Jewish homeland to a reality. With the approval of the U.S. Congress for the estab- lishment of that homeland, non-Zionists could now for the first time "move forward to work for Palestine" as loyal American citizens, "untroubled by spurious charges of dual loyalty.""5 By the early 1920s, Jewish leaders not formally affiliated with the Zionist movement, such as Adler, Marshall, Straus, and Irving Lehman, had come to feel that if the United States government could actively support the movement to establish a Jewish homeland, "every Jew was morally bound to respond in a positive way as (Chico, Calif.: Scholars Press, 1981), chap. 1; and Michael A.

DALIN well." Thus, Louis Marshall cautioned the non-Zionists that "indifference ... can do us a thousand times more harm than all the Ku Klux Klans and Henry Fords."56 Adler and the non-Zionist leadership of the American Jewish Committee had, moreover, never admitted that the "question of Palestine" was the "exclusive preserve" of the Zionists. Adler had often "waxed indignant" at the claim that only Zionists could do work in Pales- tine. "I do not agree with any man that ... Palestine is the sole concern of the Zionist Organization," he had earlier stated. "The restoration of Palestine, except as far as the Reform movement is concerned, has always been the aim of the Jewish people, and nobody and no organization can speak for the Jewish people and say that it has the sole right to deal with it."57 Adler reaffirmed his view that non-Zionists could work on behalf of Palestine by his growing determination, throughout the 1920s, to continue to help out in the development of the land. Encouraging non-Zionist finan- cial support for Palestine through business, cultural, scientific, and agricul- tural projects, Adler was instrumental in establishing (in 1924) a new investment company, the Palestine Economic Corporation.58 Adler's experience as the representative of the American Jewish Committee at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 had, moreover, further convinced him of the importance of Zionist-non-Zionist cooperation in 56. Ibid. 57. Neuman, Cyrus Adler, pp. 128-129. 58. It is important to note that Adler's genuine and abiding concern for Jews throughout the world motivated him to aid in the efforts for Jewish agricultural and educational develop- ment in Palestine even prior to the 1920s. Thus, for example, when Solomon Schechter of the Jewish Theological Seminary asked Adler to join Louis Marshall, Mortimer L. Schiff, and himself on the American board of trustees of Haifa's Technion, Adler accepted. Always willing to promote the "practical" work of Jewish colonization in Palestine, Adler had (in 1909) urged support for the Jewish Agricultural Experiment Station at Athlit as a means of raising the agricultural productivity of Palestine. He, like Louis Marshall, Jacob Schiff, and other Jewish leaders, became interested through meetings with a young agricultural scientist named Aaron Aaronsohn, who had discovered how to grow a prototype of wheat, barley, rye, and oats. World-renowned German botanists and the United States Department of Agriculture had praised Aaronsohn's discovery. In writing to Louis Marshall, Adler introduced Aaronsohn as "a man who has made impor- tant agricultural discoveries .... I believe that if he can carry out his plans, the agricultural regeneration of Palestine can be accomplished; that moreover, they have the greatest impor- tance for all dry lands as indicating a form of reclamation which does not imply the great expense attached to irrigation" (Cyrus Adler Letters, no. 136, p. 1: Letter to Louis Marshall, November 8, 1909). Adler wrote letters of introduction for Aaronsohn to Marshall, Schiff, and Professor Morris Loeb, urging that "the man and his ideas are worthy of a mighty push" (ibid., no. 136, pp. I and 2).</page><page sequence="25">CYRUS ADLER, NON-ZIONISM, AND THE ZIONIST MOVEMENT 79 pursuit of common goals. The four months that Cyrus Adler spent in Paris in the spring of 1919 were, as Moshe Davis has pointed out,59 "one of the most significant periods" in his public career. While Louis Marshall was officially the president and spokesman for the Committee of Jewish Delega- tions to the Peace Conference, he worked closely with Adler in negotiating and articulating the positions arrived at by the Zionist and non-Zionist members of the committee at Paris. Marshall and Adler "regarded them- selves, and were regarded by others, as a team."60 Their Committee of Jewish Delegations, while involved primarily in securing minority rights for the Jews of Eastern Europe, supported the Zionist program vis-a-vis Pales- tine as well.61 The committee's theme was Jewish unity, and Adler, as the representative of the non-Zionist AJC, played an instrumental role in bringing non-Zionist and Zionist delegates to the Peace Conference together to achieve this end. Adler was, for example, instrumental in bring- ing Marshall and American Jewish Congress representative Judge Julian Mack together, thus establishing "the basis for a unified approach" between Zionist and non-Zionist members of the delegations.62 He worked closely with the European Zionist leader Nahum Sokolow as well. The non-Zionist press "cemented the budding relationship" forged by Adler and Marshall "by displaying an indomitable faith in the peace-makers' ability to solve the Jewish problem in Europe through agreements with the states of Central and Eastern Europe and in Palestine via British assumption of the man- date,"63 which was essentially the Zionist program as well. Adler's change of attitude toward Zionism was also attributable, in part, to the change in leadership of the World Zionist Organization, after its acrimonious Cleveland Conference of 1921, from Brandeis to Weizmann. Adler's attitude toward Zionism prior to 1921 had been shaped in some degree by his dislike and distrust of the men who constituted the American Zionist leadership, Stephen S. Wise and Louis D. Brandeis in particular, and the democratization of Jewish public life which they espoused. Adler, as many of his contemporaries and associates have attested, was above all an aristocrat, and while he was a firm defender of democracy in American life, 59.

DALIN this belief did not necessarily carry over to Jewish affairs.64 Adler's long- standing personality conflicts with the leadership of the Federation of American Zionists were, beginning in 1915, accentuated during the battle over the issue of the American Jewish Congress. Adler had long considered the leadership of the Federation of American Zionists a "highly unpalata- ble" group with whom to work. Weak in membership and funds, the FAZ nonetheless "attracted orators and journalists who took particular delight in sneering at the American Jewish Committee for its undemocratic organiza- tion, discreet methods, alleged political conservatism and lack of Jewish heart."65 Adler and his colleagues of the committee interpreted the Zionist methods of mass appeal, geared especially to the new immigrants from Eastern Europe, as an effort to capture the leadership of the American Jewish Committee. Thus, in June 1915, for example, Adler wrote in com- plaint to Solomon Schechter as follows: In the Jewish political world, [Louis] Marshall, [Jacob] Schiff, Judge [Mayer] Sulzberger and myself are now the principal objects of attack and we are denounced as being unfit for the management of Jewish affairs. A very strong and determined movement.. . are making a political campaign for the purpose of securing an American Jewish Congress and definitely in my opinion for the purpose of overthrowing the American Jewish Committee.... It is part of a general Zionist programme for the capture of Jewish organiza- tions and the calling of an international Jewish Congress under Zionist auspices.66 The urbane and charming Chaim Weizmann posed no such threat. On the contrary: Weizmann, like Adler, had disliked Theodor Herzl, as he and 64. Louis Lipsky has commented that Adler "refused to go along with the democratic trends in Jewish life. . . . he seemed to think that democracy was an alien notion in Jewish life." In his leadership style, Lipsky has suggested, Adler was, at least during most of his career, "critical and caustic, dictatorial and intolerant."

Herman Rubenovitz, one of Adler's contemporaries and his coworker in the organization of the United Synagogue, would later comment that Adler was "a firm believer in maintaining the established order whereby leadership in Jewish affairs was to be left to certain prominent families of wealth and public spirit. He was entirely out of sympathy with the democratic trends in Jewish life which became manifest at the turn of the century" and found expression in the Zionist movement and the Zionist-inspired campaign for an American Jewish Congress.

Weizmann, like Adler, was now ready to avoid all discussions of Zionist political ideology, and all questions of statehood, in a common program devoted to the economic and agricultural development of Palestine. By the early 1920s, Weizmann could explain that Zionists like himself would be happy to work on a nonideological basis alongside those who did not share their particular philosophical views. Indeed, Weizmann approviingly quoted Judge Mayer Sulzberger's comment that "it is sometimes good to do the right thing even for the wrong reasons,"67 an attitude with which the always pragmatic Adler could easily concur. In fact, it can be argued that in terms of their personalities and leader- ship styles, as well as their political pragmatism, Adler and Weizmann had much in common. Weizmann, like Adler, was by nature an aristocrat who had a profound distrust of the Jewish masses and their role in Jewish affairs.68 Yosef Gorni's characterization of Weizmann could well have applied to Adler as well: His "elitist aristocratic bent . .. based on his belief in the serving elite, set him apart from the masses whom he ... pitied but by whom he was also repelled."69 Weizmann and Adler shared, moreover, an autocratic leadership style that left little room or tolerance for opposition. Weizmann, like Adler, had disliked Theodor Herzl. Both were openly con- temptuous of some rivals-e.g., Adler's continual antipathy toward Israel Zangwill and Stephen Wise,70 as evidenced in his correspondence, and Weizmann's well-known and often bitter rivalry with David Ben-Gurion- and did not hesitate to employ insulting language against those with whom they disagreed. To his political opponents Weizmann "bore a constant grudge and never forgave them,"" a trait exhibited by Adler as well. Adler 67. Urofsky, American Zionism, pp. 320-321. 68.

Wise on this Board is not likely to make for my continued cooperation, at least, if I have to sit in the room with that gentleman very often." Cyrus Adler Letters, no. 470, p. 3: Letter to Judah L.

DALIN could never forgive Brandeis and Wise for opposing him on the congress issue, and thus would not ally himself with the Zionist movement until they had been ousted from its leadership, and had been replaced by Weizmann. Adler, Weizmann, and the Jewish Agency The change in personalities within the leadership of the Zionist move- ment after 1921 thus significantly influenced Adler's relationship to the movement. Chaim Weizmann, unlike Herzl, Wise, or Brandeis, shared Adler's pragmatism, sought Adler's advice, and respected his political judgment. Indeed, Adler's changing attitude toward Zionism and coopera- tion with the Zionist movement during the 1920s can be attributed, in no small measure, to the politically shrewd initiative taken by Weizmann to seek the involvement of Adler and other prominent non-Zionists in the practical affairs and goverance of the Yishuv. He intended to achieve this by expanding the Jewish Agency, the body which served as the "official liaison" with Great Britain on matters affecting Jewish Palestine. The first step toward a Zionist-non-Zionist rapprochement was taken in 1924 when Adler and Louis Marshall agreed, at Weizmann's urging, to assemble "a full-scale conference of non-Zionists" to discuss participation in an enlarged Jewish Agency and the establishment of an investment corporation to aid the economic development of Palestine. On February 8, 1924, Adler, Marshall, Herbert Lehman, and Judge Horace B. Stern-all pillars of the German-Jewish non-Zionist community-sent out a letter to 150 pro- minent Jews not affiliated with the Zionist Organization of America. "The time has come," said the invitation, "when we firmly believe that the duty rests upon the Jews of this country who are not members of or affiliated with the Zionist Organization, to consider seriously their relations to the econo- mic problems of Palestine and to its cultural and industrial upbuilding."72 Initial opposition to Weizmann's plan disappeared when Adler and his non-Zionist colleagues accepted the term "Jewish National Home" in the preamble of the Jewish Agency's constitution.73 In 1928, a committee of seven non-Zionists, including Adler, was appointed to name the forty-four American members of the enlarged agency. Weizmann's long-sought-after goal was finally achieved at Zurich in the summer of 1929. Weizmann was 72. Urofsky, American Zionism, p. 318. 73.

Among the eminent non- Zionists who attended the first meeting of the expanded agency at Zurich were Leon Blum, Albert Einstein, and Cyrus Adler. While Adler would later disclaim any significant role in the creation and development of the expanded Jewish Agency, he must certainly be credited with being one of its most influential architects and farsighted leaders. A month after the Zurich meeting Louis Marshall died, and Adler assumed his role and responsibilities as the leading non-Zionist member of the agency, serving both as president of the agency's council and as chairman of its adminstrative committee. With characteristic dedication and effectiveness, Adler would subsequently participate in the management and decision- making of the Jewish Agency for close to a decade. Through his work on behalf of the agency, which occupied much of his time and correspondence between 1929 and 1932, Adler gained a new respect for Chaim Weizmann, corresponded with him regularly, and supported him on a number of public issues. And, as the several references to Adler in the published letters and papers of Chaim Weizmann indicate, Adler's growing respect for Weizmann did not go unreciprocated. Weizmann began, increasingly, during these years, to value Adler's political advice, support, and friendship.74 A few days after the sessions of the expanded agency concluded in 1929, riots broke out in Palestine. They were followed by the issuance of the Pass- field White Paper, which announced the British government's decision to curtail land sales and Jewish immigration to Palestine. The Revisionists within the World Zionist Organization and the Jewish Agency Executive, led by Vladimir Jabotinsky, blamed the White Paper on Weizmann's policy of cooperation with the British, and sought his ouster from leadership. Adler, however, spoke eloquently in Weizmann's defense, claiming that "the blame for the White Paper could not be laid.. . on the shoulders of Weizmann."75 In subsequently urging Felix Warburg to reconsider his decision to resign from the Jewish Agency Executive, he reminded Warburg of the importance of the participation of non-Zionists such as themselves within the newly expanded agency that Weizmann had created. 74. See, for example, Weizmann's Letters to Felix M. Warburg of November 22, 1929, January 16, 1930, January 17, 1930, February 28, 1930, and June 26, 1930.

DALIN If you withdraw, it will involve the withdrawal of many other non-Zionists in the Agency in this country and possibly some abroad. One has to contemplate what the final effect will be. Of course, I cannot predict the coming elections to the Zionist Congress, but with the announcement of your withdrawal I imagine a considerable part of the support of Weizmann would fall. The Revisionists, joined by the Mizrachi, would I think probably control the Congress.76 Adler's response to the Passfield White Paper was not delimited to support for his new friend and colleague, Weizmann, in the internecine struggles of the Zionist movement. Adler responded vigorously in the public arena as well, "denouncing the British for hypocrisy and tearing the White Paper to shreds."''77 At a public meeting in Philadelphia, he declared: "Our effort in Palestine may be delayed [but] it cannot be stopped."78 The riots that led to the Passfield White Paper had begun with Arabs attacking Jews at the Wailing Wall. Wanting to disprove Arab contentions, Weizmann asked Adler to prepare a memorandum to be submitted to the League of Nations clarifying Jewish rights to the Western Wall, an under- taking that Adler could not refuse. As he wrote to the British historian and Zionist leader Louis Namier: "The request, originally conveyed by Doctor [Chaim] Weizmann through Mr. [Felix M.] Warburg, places upon me a great responsibility which I am far from anxious to have, but which I do not feel that I have a right to shirk if it is the deliberate judgement of everybody concerned that I am the person to undertake the task.""79 In his lengthy memorandum, published in book form in 1930,80 Adler succinctly outlined the argument for Jewish rights at the Wall and endeavored, as he wrote to Weizmann, "to establish the historical basis for the Jewish claim that for at least one thousand years they have had free access to the Wall for the pur- pose of prayer.""' Adler's effort was an unequivocal success. His book proved to be "a masterly presentation of the historic rights of Jews," and "a model of scholarship."82 Indeed, the volume proved to be "so convincing" 76. Ibid., p. 10. 77.

After the British withdrew the worst features of the White Paper, Adler withdrew from the leadership ranks of the Jewish Agency to devote his time and energies to his manifold communal responsibilities as president of the seminary, Dropsie College, and the American Jewish Committee. When Louis Marshall died in September 1929, Adler had succeeded him as committee president. Together with Judge Horace Stern of Philadelphia, Adler sought "to stir the impulses and imagination" of the American Jewish Committee's influential non-Zionist leadership "in the spirit and for the cause" of the Jewish Agency for Palestine.83 While president of the com- mittee, Adler continued as an active and valuable member of the Jewish Agency, devoting much of his increasingly scarce time, and a great deal of his correspondence, to its activities and programs. For example, when the British issued another White Paper following the 1936 riots, one which suggested the partitioning of Palestine, Adler drafted an "alternative" proposal for the Jewish Agency Executive to consider. Achieving peaceful relations between Jews and Arabs in Palestine was another goal of Adler's during the 1930s, which he hoped to further through his work within the Jewish Agency. One of the most "intractable and elusive problems" Adler ever faced, it was one to which he devoted much energy and correspondence during his last decade.84 As one of the pivotal figures within the leadership of the Jewish Agency during the 1930s, Adler provided the necessary link between the non- Zionist world, for which the American Jewish Committee was spokesman, and the realization of the Zionist program that only non-Zionist coopera- tion and support could help to achieve. Adler reminded the Zionist leader- ship of the agency of the seminal role played by the non-Zionist leadership of his American Jewish Committee in financial contributions to Palestine since 1929,85 and even threatened to resign from the agency if the non- Zionists within the body were to be made "the target of constant reproach."86 Adler did not resign, however, but contined to work for Zionist and non-Zionist cooperation and succeeded in shaping the consensus 83.

DALIN between Zionists and non-Zionists upon which the success and achievement of the Jewish Agency for Palestine was based. This was, perhaps, one of Cyrus Adler's greatest contributions to Jewish public life during the 1930s. Conclusion One of the most gifted and farsighted Jewish public servants and communal leaders of his generation, Adler played a pivotal role in the creation and development of an extraordinary number of Jewish institutions and communal enterprises. A Jewish public figure who was able to uniquely interpret the needs of religious Jews to the wealthy German-Jewish philan- thropists of American Jewry, Adler inspired awe and respect (if not affec- tion) in all the various groupings of the Jewish community, including those opposed to him. It would thus be difficult to overestimate the potential ramifications that Adler's active involvement with the American Zionist movement might have had. What Evyatar Friesel has said of Jacob Schiff can, I think, legitimately be said of Adler as well: "His joining the Zionist Movement would certainly have been a considerable moral victory for the Zionists, and a strong impetus for the movement in the United States.""87 Unlike Julian Mack and Nathan Straus, among others in his social circle, Adler would never formally identify with or join the Zionist movement. Unlike Schiff and Marshall,88 he would never even come close to officially joining the Zionist ranks. And yet, during the 1920s he played perhaps the pivotal role in forging the rapprochement between the Zionist and non- Zionist leadership within the Jewish Agency for Palestine, and played a significant role in the growth and development of that most important of Zionist institutions. In so doing, it may be argued, he helped to make the Zionist movement of that day more "respectable" to the non-Zionist leader- ship of his social circle, while at the same time guaranteeing the continued participation and financial support of the non-Zionist leadership of the American Jewish Committee in the work and program of the Jewish Agency. This was, to say the least, not an insignificant achievement. It was, arguably, an accomplishment that a Stephen Wise, Judah Magnes, Israel Friedlaender, or even a Solomon Schechter could never have achieved. It 87. Friesel, "Jacob H. Schiff Becomes a Zionist," pp. 56-57. 88.

Indeed, it can be argued that after the death of Marshall, no other American Jewish communal figure but Adler could have succeeded in bringing such a rapprochement about. To have been thus able to shape such an alliance, and working consensus, between the non-Zionist American Jewish establishment of his era and a section of the World Zionist movement may well be considered one of the more important accomplishments of Adler's varied and distinguished public career. Thus, paradoxically, within the last decade of his life, and without ever adhering to Zionist ideology, Cyrus Adler made a profound and endur- ing contribution to the Zionist movement of which he never formally became a part.
