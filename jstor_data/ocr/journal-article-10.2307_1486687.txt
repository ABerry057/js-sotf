It is particularly significant for members of these faiths who are engaged in interfaith dialogue. Robert A. Everett, a pastor of the United Church of Christ, has done an immense amount of primary research over many years while writing the dissertation on which this book is based. The result is a compelling account of the spiritual journey of an Oxford-trained theologian who until 1929 had no special expertise or interest in Judaism. Parkes adhered to the common Christian view-still widely held today-that the Jewish tradition "was an arid and meaningless legalism, and I had seen no reason to waste time in studying it."' He felt that Judaism lacked true spirituality and that its most vital ideas had been developed more fully by Christianity. Parkes's transformation began in 1929, when the International Student Services asked him to make a study of antisemitism at European academic institutions. For the rest of his life Parkes continued to study and write about Judaism and Christianity, particularly the Jewish-Christian relationship and what he termed the disease of antisemitism. He was enriched in his understanding of Judaism by his contacts with many of the most prominent Jewish scholars of the day, including Herbert Loewe of Oxford and Claude Montefiore of Cambridge, and later in life with such Jewish thinkers as Martin Buber and Abraham Joshua Heschel. Everett develops in great detail Parkes's evolving view of the Jewish tradition and the effect which this had on his view of Christianity. The transformation was gradual, but already by the 1930s and 1940s his ideas were quite radical for most Christians-and would be so even today. For example, Kenneth Cragg, a prominent scholar of Islam and a bishop in the Anglican Church, claims that Parkes's views were "in radical breach with his own Scripture."2 Everett captures for us the essential points in Parkes's thinking on Judaism that most Christians would find problematic and helps us to understand Cragg's strong reaction.

According to Parkes, the New Testament distorted the true nature of Pharisaic Judaism. Influenced as he was by the modernist movement, Parkes accepted biblical criticism and rejected the infallibility of the Bible. It was, he said, inspired, but not infallible. 2. Parkes argued that the Christian distortion of Jews and Judaism, particularly the charge that the Jews had killed Jesus, was the major cause of antisemitism and was responsible for the Holocaust. He stated: "I do not believe that Christendom can for long continue to ignore the fact that here lies the ultimate reason why six million Jews died in the Holocaust" (p. 315). 3. Parkes pioneered the view that Christianity must acknowledge the validity of the Jewish tradition. He proposed a "theology of equality" (p. 252). Since he saw Judaism as a valid religious tradition, he opposed Christian missions to the Jews, a stance which was particularly problematic for Bishop Cragg. One weakness of Everett's book is its dissertation style, with its very long quotations. Since this is the authoritative book on Parkes, I feel that more time could have been devoted to revising it. I also question Everett's claim that "in many ways, Parkes was an early proponent of religious Pluralism" (p. x). Although it is clear that Parkes was a pluralist toward Judaism, Everett makes no attempt to present his attitude toward other religions. From my own reading of Parkes, it is clear to me that he believed Islam not to be quite equal to Christianity or Judaism. Parkes seemed surprised that some Jews felt a special affinity for Islamic theology, because for him the God of Islam was not as rich and complex as the God of the Jewish and Christian traditions.3 Nevertheless, I fully agree with Everett that Parkes is a seminal figure for Jewish-Christian dialogue, one who deserves a great deal more attention than he has received in interfaith circles. For members of all faiths who want to liberate their traditions from arrogant triumphalism, James Parkes can serve as an excellent model. Harold Kasimow Grinnell College Grinnell, Iowa 3.
