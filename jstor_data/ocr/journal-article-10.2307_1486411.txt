<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE STORY AS A HERMENEUTIC DEVICE by OFRA MEIR The various versions of the story about the daughter of Nakdimon ben Gurion may be used to explain two phenomena: (a) the story as a her- meneutic device, by which the very act of presenting the verse as part of the story imparts to it a new meaning, which differs not only from the peshat (plain meaning), but also from the other exegeses of the sages concerning this same verse and (b) the modification that results in this new meaning because of the diversities in the different versions of the story. The first part of this study is devoted to a presentation of the commen- tary on the Song of Songs 1:8 in accordance with the plain and homiletic meanings. In the second part, the various versions are grouped according to the degree of similarity between them. Parts 3, 4 and 5 deal with each of these groupings. In the sections where the aforementioned phenomena are presented, an attempt is made to provide an explanation for the interdepen- dence between the different versions on the one hand and the literary com- pilations on the other. 1. There is general agreement today among biblical commentators that the Song of Songs is a compilation, although opinions differ as to the number NOTE: This article was translated by Michael Gordon (Jerusalem) and Deborah Nothmann (Haifa). 231</page><page sequence="2">232 OFRA MEIR of literary units which made up the scroll.' Most commentators view the verses, Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that veileth herself beside the flocks of thy companions? If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents (1:7-8), as a self-contained song, but they do not concur in its interpretation. The main point of contention is the identity of the speaker in verse 8. Whereas most commentators believe that the verse is the shepherd's answer to the shepherdess,2 C. D. Ginsburg believes that the verse is spoken by the daughters of Jerusalem,3 and in Tur-Sinai's opinion the verse is a continua- tion of the young woman's words in verse 7. According to this last view, the woman cites the mockery of the shepherd: "Why should I be as one that veileth herself beside the flocks of thy companions who, if I asked them about you would mock me and say to me: If you do not know where your beloved is, then forget about him and come with us by the footsteps of the flock and feed thy kids with us beside the shepherds' tents."4 The different identities assigned to the speaker do not affect the content as much as the tone of what is said; those who believe that the words are said by the beloved see the answer as instructions, given in a positive spirit, to the shepherdess on how to reach the place where her beloved can be found; those of the opinion that the words are not spoken by the shepherd interpret them as irony or mockery of the young woman, whose beloved is far from her. The difference between the methods employed by Bible scholars, whose efforts are primarily directed toward understanding the text as its author wrote it, and the methods of the sages in their exegesis of the Bible in general 1.

He writes: "The court ladies, hearing the rustic girl say that she wishes to be with her shepherd, tell her ironically to go, and be employed in the low and toilsome occupation of a shepherdess, rather than enjoy the exalted and easy life of a royal favourite" (C. D. Ginsburg, The Song of Songs [London, 1857], p. 136). Note also his other interpretive comments. 4. N. H. Tur-Sinai, Ha-Lashon ve-ha-sefer, 3 vols.

Is it positive or negative? True, most of the sages ascribe verse 7 to Moses and see verse 8 as God's response, which instills Moses with confidence that God will take care of the people of Israel, but there are some who see the response as a foreboding vision for Moses and the generation of the wilderness: "'Go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock.' He [God] said to him [Moses]: the entire generation will meet its end, and the same will happen to you" (Song R. 1.7) or "'and feed thy kids.' He said to him, kids enter, goats do not enter" (ibid.). 2. The story is found in eight literary compilations of the sages,7 but there are two versions in one source (Babylonian Talmud, henceforth: B.T.), so that there are actually nine versions in all. The relationship between the ver- sions is more complex than comments of scholars would indicate. For example, L. Finkelstein writes on the Sifre version: ... and the incident came down in two versions, one of the Sifre, Mekhilta, ARN, B.T. Ketubbot 66b, according to which the incident occurred to Rabbi Yolhanan ben Zakkai, and it seems that the older version is that cited by B.T. Ketubbot 67a, the Palestinian Talmud and the Tosefta, end of Chap. 5, Pesiqta Rabbati and Lamentations Rabbah, according to which the narrator is R. 5. Isaac Heinemann illustrated them well in his book Darkei ha-'aggadah (Jerusalem, 1954). For exegesis on the Song of Songs see also E. E. Urbach, "Derashot .HaZaL u-ferushei 'Origenes le-Shir ha-Shirim ve-ha-vikkuab ha-yehudi-noveri," Tarbiz 30 (1960-61): 148-50. 6. Heinemann, Darkei, pp. 130-36. The verses are taken as one unit in: Sifre, Num., 138-39; Song R. 1:7 (a few pericopae); Exod. R., 2:4; Tanbuma Exod. 14; Tanbuma (ed. Buber), Exod. 12; in Exod. R. 3:4 there is exegesis only on verse 7 (in a fashion similar to earlier exegeses, but in the Almighty's response verse 8 is missing); in Sifre, Deut., 305 (ed. Friedmann) and in ARNa 17, verse 8 is cited (as support for Moses' words to Joshua), and in the Mekhilta (henceforth: Mek.), Shirata, 10, ed. Horowitz-Rabin, p. 149 (Lauterbach, 2: 77) there is exegesis on the verse (without citing the speaker, but here also it refers to the generation of the wilderness): "The kids enter but not the goats." For another exegesis on verse 8 see B.T. Shab. 33b. 7. The versions appear in the article itself or in the Appendices.</page><page sequence="4">234 OFRA MEIR Eleazar b. R. Zadok, and he says he saw the girl in Acre picking barley grain beneath horses' hoofs.8 This division according to the names of the sages does not take into account other differences which, I feel, make it necessary to divide the ver- sions into three groups: (1) the version of the Tosefta (henceforth: Tos.), Palestinian Talmud (henceforth: P.T.), Lam. R., B.T. (the first story), and Pesiqta Rabbati (henceforth: Pes. R.); (2) the version of the Sifre, B.T.

The division is according to the number of versions, and no chronological order is intended.</page><page sequence="5">THE STORY AS HERMENEUTIC DEVICE 235 and which tersely recount only as much as is necessary for the halakhic con- text of the stories. However, an examination of the structure and style of our passage reveals that the narrator's concern goes beyond the halakhic issue of "he grows rich, she rises with him, he grows poor, she does not fall with him" and even though the first part of the story looks as if it can stand independently, it is neatly connected to the second part. The narrator presents the female figure through her father's name. The function of the name Nakdimon ben Gurion is to emphasize her being the daughter of an extremely wealthy man,'0 a member of Jerusalem's wealthy class before the destruction of the Temple-and this is the only hint that the story took place before the destruction. The sages allot an enormous sum to the woman-500 denarii of gold a day just for perfumery," and even though her father's name testifies to great wealth, the reader or listener would expect her to be completely contented. This expectation is heightened by the emphatic statement that "she was but 10. The tradition about his wealth is preserved in B.T. Git. 56a; Lam. R. 1:17 (? 31); and in the group B stories. Even though all of them are later than the Tosefta, the very mention of the name makes it seem likely that the narrator and the audience knew of his wealth and pos- sibly even of the tradition about the amount in the ketubbah from her father and father-in- law (see 4.1). 11. The phrase "each day" (be-khol yom) appears in the P.T. (Appendix I) and Lam. R. (Appendix II) versions. In the Genizah fragments of Lam. R. the phrase "each year" appears. In Rabinowitz's opinion (Z. M. Rabinowitz, "Geniza Fragments of Midrash Lamentations" [Hebrew], Proceedings of the Sixth World Congress of Jewish Studies (Jerusalem, 1977), 3: 439), the version is enlightening, because the story in other versions is "questionable and exaggerated, for would not five hundred denarii a day be sufficient?" One version, however, cannot overshadow all the others and the phrase "each year" does not coincide with the levir- ate laws (see n. 12; in Lam. R. the phrase "and she was only awaiting the levir" does not appear). The sages' verdict is tied to the halakhah "the bridegroom undertakes [to provide] ten denarii for her basket [of perfumes] for each and every portion" (Mishnah Ket. 6:4, Tos. Ket. 6:6). See Lieberman's discussion Tos. Kif., p. 277, and Rashi writes (Ket. 66b, s.v. "la-quppah"): "the Mishnah does not specify whether it is each day, each Sabbath, each month or each year." In the B.T. discussion the question of time is raised and the issue is left unsolved (teiqu), but there are grounds for the B.T. exegetes' observation (see Tosafot, s.v. "le-yom rishon o le-khol yom va-yom" and see Shitah mequbbeet and Menahem ha-Meiri on B.T. Ket. 66b) that the allotment of ten denarii a day for each portion would have depleted the husband's resources quickly and it is reasonable that the allotment was given one time only. Rashi, in his explana- tion of our story in the B.T., renders i', 1n as "for one day's needs" and the Tosafot's words point to this same interpretation, but the sum for one day's needs seems illogical, even for someone extremely wealthy. In light of the B.T. version "for that day," one might infer that the sum was given one time only on that particular day, but the Palestinian sources remain hard to fathom. Whatever the case, the phrase serves to make the woman's unexpected reac- tion more severe.</page><page sequence="6">236 OFRA MEIR awaiting the levir." A woman in this category is fed out of her husband's assets for only three months'2 and, in contrast to an ordinary widow who does not know what the future holds for her, a widow awaiting the levir awaits a known husband, and does not have the same need to adorn herself in order to find favor.'3 The narrator recounts these facts in an artistic, thoughtful fashion, while deviating from the natural order of the account. We would expect an informative account of the facts to read like this: "It is related of the daughter of Nakdimon ben Gurion, who was awaiting the levir, and the sages allotted her. .. ." The narrator puts the effect before the cause, makes the active part a subordinate clause, and emphasizes that "she was but awaiting. . . ." In this manner he intensifies the expectation of satisfaction and sharpens the confrontation now revealed between her and the sages, and between her expected reaction and her actual one; she curses them and says, "May you give such to your own daughters." What makes this remark a bitter curse is not the amount spoken of, but the fact that the curser is a widow. The curse of a rich daughter whose expectations know no bounds and who does not recoil from addressing the sages in this manner evokes no response at the conclusion of the first part of the story. In the second part, the narrator quotes R. Eleazar. According to rab- binic sources there were evidently two tannaim by this name,14 but it is reasonable to assume that our story refers to R. Eleazar b. R. Zadok, who lived in Jerusalem before the destruction of the Temple and moved to Yav- neh after it. The names Nakdimon and R. Eleazar point to the likelihood that the first part of the story took place before the destruction of the Temple and the second part afterwards. In this part the narrator also reverses the order of events: he opens with what R. Eleazar said and only later mentions what R. Eleazar saw before this. The rabbi commences with the oath, "May I behold the Consolation." Since the rabbi's credibility is not subject to doubt, it seems that he is motivated to use an oath because the incident related is especially hard to believe. In Ben-Yehuda's dictionary (Vol. 7, p. 3609) the phrase "May I behold the Consolation" is explained as an oath in a positive sense: "I will see the consolation of Israel,""' but a second definition-"verification and 12.

Gilat, Encyclopedia Judaica (Jerusalem, 1971), s.v. "Eleazar ben Zadok." 15. Similarly, in Even Shoshan's dictionary: "So I will be privileged to hear the heralding of the redemption of Israel, as it is right that. ..."</page><page sequence="7">THE STORY AS HERMENEUTIC DEVICE 237 reinforcement of a man's words by means of a curse about a condition which will be carried out by God"'6-aligns with the explanation of the Tosafot: "It is the language of a curse in terse form, meaning he will not be able to witness the consolation of Zion if .. ." (B.T. IHag. 16b, s.v. "'er'eh ba- nebamah").,7 The juxtaposition of the woman's curse at the end of Part A and the oath-curse at the beginning of Part B strengthens the connection between the two parts and shapes the fate of the woman as punishment for her behavior. Despite the obvious contraction in the time that elapsed between the two events and the disregard of its duration, it is clear that not only had time passed between the woman's curse and what R. Eleazar saw in Acre, but that time had also passed between the encounter in Acre and the telling of the story. It is only reasonable that when R. Eleazar saw the daughter of Nakdimon picking barley grains, he did not know what had transpired between her and the sages." Therefore it seems that the verse he uttered held a twofold meaning. When he saw a daughter of Israel from one of the wealthiest families in Jerusalem hungry for bread, he recited the verse out of pain for the fate of the woman who, like her people, was humiliated and desolate after the destruction, and the meaning he imparts to the verse is: "If thou know not"-if you did not know what lay in store for you, "O thou fairest among women"-you from the nation's wealthiest [people], "go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents"-how fate has turned against you, and you are down- trodden and seek barley to break your hunger in the fields of strangers. And it would not be unreasonable to suppose that symbolic meaning on a national level accompanies the story: the wealthy girl symbolizes the chosen people and her bitter fate the bitter reality after the destruction of the temple. In an initial reading of the verse the emphasis is more on the deep pain at the fate of the woman and the nation than on an attempt to rational- ize that fate. When R. Eleazar's words are placed after Part A of the story, the words "if thou know not" take on the meaning, "you, who did not 16. Ya'aqov Rubin, Hebrew Encyclopedia (Jerusalem, 1979), s.v. "Shevu'ot u-nedarim." 17. In our case: if what I said is incorrect. It is interesting to note Rashi's second interpre- tation (B.T. Makkot 5b, s.v. "'er'eh ba-nehamah"): "he swears his sons will die and I will not see consolation for them." 18. Perhaps this is an additional reason for the language of the oath at the beginning of his words.</page><page sequence="8">238 OFRA MEIR know how to respect the sages, and did not understand the relative value of money." Consequently, the appellation "fairest among women" takes on an ironic dimension and the continuation of the verse, which is applied to her bitter fate, can be interpreted as punishment for her deed. Even if there is in this latter meaning an allusion to the nation's sins which brought about the destruction, what stands out is the direct connection between the woman's specific deed and her actual punishment. This connection shows that in the initial meaning there is an expression of genuine pain, but this results from insufficient knowledge of all that has transpired. The dissonance between the picture of picking grains beneath horses' hoofs and the picture of going out in the footsteps of sheep and feeding kids by shepherds' tents indicates that what R. Eleazar saw was not fabricated to complement the verse, but that the picture of the woman evoked a view of the verse as symbolic of the scene before him.'9 In view of the double mean- ing of the verse quoted by R. Eleazar, the reality throws new light on it and is itself elucidated in light of the verse. Exegetic interpretations of verses offer an additional meaning to the surface interpretation through a partic- ular hermeneutic method, but when a verse is interwoven into a story the additional meaning stems from the very integration of verse and narrative. 3.2 The story in P.T. (Appendix I) comes in a halakhic context similar to that of the Tos.,20 and Part A of the story closely parallels the Tos. version, except for two variations: a) the story opens with, "It is related of Miriam the daughter of Simeon ben Gurion." The change from Nakdimon to Simeon can be explained either as a printing error (see n. 25) or as an echo of the tradition preserved in the B.T. regarding the change in ben Gurion's first name.21 At any rate, in Lam. R. and Pes. R. (Appendices II and IV) the daughter of Nakdimon is called Miriam, and it appears that the reference is to the same story. Recording the woman's first name does not flesh out her image but is, perhaps, testimony to her being known in her own right; b) at 19. This conclusion contradicts that of Naomi Cohen in her article, "The Theological Stratum of the Martha b. Boethus Tradition." Harvard Theological Review 69 (1976): 187-95. There may even be grounds for citing the story's connection to a historical event. This tie is strengthened by the mention of the place-Acre-which was a Roman colony in the period of the Destruction (see Atlas Carta, p. 78). 20. In the halakhic context: "This was said in what regard? The poor of Israel, but also the honored of Israel-each according to his own honor." See above and Tos. Kif, p. 277. 21. "They taught his name was not Nakdimon, but Boni" (B.T. Ta'anit 20b and see Lieber- man, p. 270, n. 40).</page><page sequence="9">THE STORY AS HERMENEUTIC DEVICE 239 the end of Part A there is the addition: "R. Aha said, 'and we answered her with Amen.' " R. Aha was an amora,22 and his words are a late response to the account in Part A, which the editor of the passage chose to add. The phrase "we answered" is not appropriate to a long delayed response, and probably the phrase should have been "and they answered," or else it may be understood as "we would have answered." The Amen is said despite the woman's awaiting the levir, and if this is not a printing error (see below), it seems that R. Aha was so impressed by the size of the allotment that he overlooked the fact of her widowhood. In Part B of the P.T. version R. Eleazar's words are cited, but they vary from the Tos. version and are not parallel. In this part there are two promi- nent variations: (a) R. Eleazar swears that he saw the woman "tied by her hair to the horse's tail in Acre"; (b) he applied to her the verse, "the tender and delicate woman among you, etc." (Deut. 28:56-57). This passage, taken from the tokhaah, is caustic (especially verse 57) and is somewhat appro- priate to the former variation, but it is likely that the entire section from R. Aha's words through the conclusion is an error or distraction. This assump- tion is based upon four facts: (1) the verse from Deut. in Lam. R. (1:16, ?47), in the P.T. preceding our story, and in B.T. Git. (56b) is connected to the story of Martha b. Boethus;23 in this story from the P.T. R. Aha's response is cited, and since the story does not mention that Martha was a widow, responding Amen to her curse at being allotted two se'ah of wine a day is more reasonable than responding Amen to a widow; (2) the link between the verse from the Song of Songs and Part A of our story is also maintained in the Lam. R. and Pes. R. versions;24 (3) hunger is a more fitting punishment for avarice than is the degradation of being tied to a horse's tail; (4) the depiction of hunger in verses from Deut.-parents eating their children's flesh-is not only lurid and cruel, but also inappropriate to a widow (who has no children) awaiting the levir.25 22. R. Aha, mentioned often in the P.T., was in the fourth generation of Palestinian Amo- raim. See Hanokh Albeck, Mavo la-talmudim (Tel Aviv, 1969), pp. 316-18. 23. For the verse's connection to the story, see Naomi Cohen, n. 19 above. 24. Regarding the B.T., see 3.4. One should note that the Song verse comes as an addition- al verse, said by R. Eleazar at the end of the story about Martha and before our story. 25. Z. W. Rabinovitz (Sha'arei torat 'ere$ Yisra'el [Jerusalem, 1940]) p. 388 suggests that the version be corrected and writes: "'They taught it once happened that Miriam the daughter of Nakdimon ben Gurion.' This is like the B.T. 66b and Tos. Chap. 5, and Sifre Ni$avim, 305, and ARN Ch. 17 [in none of these sources does the first name Miriam appear-my note], and Pes. R. Chap. 30 ?9, and Lam. R. 1:17 ?51. 'That they allotted her,' etc. said R. Aha, 'and they</page><page sequence="10">240 OFRA MEIR Nonetheless, it is likely that the version in the P.T. indicates that Part A of the story was initially a story unto itself, and that its being bound with R. Eleazar's response represents a later development in tradition (this conjec- ture has a certain amount of support in the B.T. version; see 3.4). Even though the Tos. version is more convincing than the P.T. version from a literary standpoint, the dimension of punishment for sin is more poignant in the P.T. version. 3.3 Part A of the Lam. R. version (Appendix II) is similar to the P.T. version (and unlike the Tos.) in two things: it opens with the first name "Miriam daughter of Nakdimon" (in the P.T.: "Simeon ben Gurion") and ends with R. Aha's response: "Nevertheless we answered her with Amen." The sub- stantive change (there are also slight stylistic alterations) is the elimination of the fact that the woman was awaiting the levir. The absence of this infor- mation simplifies the structure of Part A, mitigates the severity of the con- frontation between the woman and the sages, and leaves room for the later response of R. Aha; since the woman is not a widow, R. Aha may have felt that the fulfillment of this sort of curse was desirable. R. Aha's comment helps to elucidate the contrast between the woman's exaggerated expecta- tions and the opinion of the sages and those listening in. Part B of the story is close to the Tos. version, with the addition of this exegetical note: "do not read 'thy kids' (1,n''u), but 'thy bodies' (,n,~i)." This addition transforms the open symbolic description of feeding the kids into a more concrete description of the figure picking barley grains, and it lessens the dissonance between what is described in the verse and what R. Eleazar saw.26 It is difficult to determine whether the exegetical addition was stated by R. Eleazar, or whether it came later. Even though the changes in Part A diminish the severity of the woman's behavior, Lam. R. also preserves the dual nature of R. Eleazar's words and the perception of the woman's fate as punishment for her deeds. 3.4 The B.T. account (Appendix III.A) is related by R. Judah in the name of Ray regarding halakhah: "the bridegroom undertakes (to provide) ten did not follow her words with Amen.' R. Eleazar ben R. Zadok said 'May I behold the Conso- lation if I did not see her picking barley grain beneath horses' hoofs in Acre, and I applied to her this verse: 'If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the foot- steps of the flock, etc.' (this is according to all six aforementioned sources)." 26. See Maharzu's (Ze'ev Wolf) explanation, s.v. "gediyyotayikh".</page><page sequence="11">THE STORY AS HERMENEUTIC DEVICE 241 denarii for the basket."27 Following the story (Appendix III.B) the amount of the daughter of Nakdimon's ketubbah is mentioned explicitly (as in the Tos., she is referred to only by her father's name): "a million denarii of gold from her father's house, besides [the sum] from her father-in-law's house." It is not stated that she was awaiting the levir. The sages allotted her "four hundred coins of gold for the perfume basket for that day," and the Tosa. commented (s.v. "she-pasequ"): "although according to the figures in her ketubbah there were a million denarii of gold, they should have allotted her more according to the rate of ten denarii per portion; since she did not need more, they did not allot this to her."28 Instead of "she cursed," it merely says "she said to them: may you give such to your own daughter," and the story concludes, "and they answered her with Amen." The complex of changes modifies the severity of the daughter of Nak- dimon's behavior. True, she grows angry, and there is a touch of insolence in her words; but in light of the halakhah and the amount stipulated in the ketubbah, her anger has some basis. The sages' responding with "Amen" indicates that they did not view her response as a serious matter. Even though the story creates the image of a rich, spoiled daughter acting unworthily, in context it illustrates primarily the problems inherent in the Mishnah's having to determine the amount necessary for perfumery propor- tionate to the amount of the dowry-especially in cases involving the extremely wealthy. Accordingly, the story does not end with R. Eleazar's words, which are cited later in the passage (Appendix III.D) and discussed" below (4.2). 3.5 In Pes. R. (Appendix IV) the story appears in a part of the Nabamu pas- sage based on the contrast between the dire foreboding (which was fulfilled!) in Jeremiah's prophecy and the hope for the future expressed by Isaiah. This fact explains the inclination of Pes. R.'s editor to sharpen the dimension of sin and punishment, and despite the blatant changes-which have no paral- lel-he preserves the woman's status as a widow awaiting the levir. The variations, in brief, are as follows: a. Miriam daughter of Nakdimon comes to R. Zadok so that he can 27. Above, n. 11.

After the woman's reaction there is an additional passage which describes the daughter of Nakdimon, whose hair has fallen out because of the famine, and who meanders in the market with her father and meets R. Zadok. He does not recognize her, asks her father to identify her, and her father replies: "This is the very Miriam whom you allotted such and such for the Sabbath and she cursed you." c. After the father speaks R. Zadok says: "May [evil] come upon me if I have not seen her picking bran of barley grains in the dung of cattle and I applied to her this verse: 'If thou know not, O fairest among women, Go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock.' " The first two alterations flesh out the sin and punishment aspect. The cursed R. Zadok is the one who sees with his own eyes the woman's punish- ment and the father's words uphold viewing the disgrace of starvation as punishment for the curse. The third change seems artificial, and eliminates the dual meaning of the verse. Perhaps one may infer from the language of the oath that R. Zadok reported to the sages about his encounter and his response; but because of the elaborations and changes it is not clear when he saw her picking bran of barley grains, and why he did not read the verse in the presence of the father and daughter.29 Whatever the case, the verse uttered is an unequivocal expression of punishment of a woman who has transgressed. 3.6 The differences in the group A stories (those discussed above) give rise to the following conclusions: a. The Tos. version seems to be the earliest,3" and at any event it is the superior version from a literary standpoint. The way time is handled imparts a double meaning to the verse, which is actually created by the integration of the verse into the story. This interpretation differs from other rabbinic exegesis of the verse in four ways: (1) the verse is uttered by a sage and not a 29. William Braude (Pesikta Rabbati [New York and London, 1968]) translates the verse as follows: "If thou are not known, O thou fairest among women, it is because thou followest upon, etc." (p. 589), and in n. 15 he cites the accepted translation. Braude's translation is based on R. Zadok's question to the father-"Who is this young woman with you?-(the section is missing from the printed texts and is present in the Parma MS), but in the Hebrew source the verse is cited literally. I feel it preferable to bring the interpretation as a footnote and to cite the original in the text, rather than vice versa. 30.

Despite the textual difficulties and alteration in the P.T. version, it appears that this version and Lam. R. are the closest to the Tos., and the three versions may be seen as parallels of the same source, with certain edi- torial changes. c. The editor of the sugya in the B.T. had a quite ancient tradition (from Rav), which evidently originated in Palestine. It is difficult to determine whether this tradition in its original form contained two parts to the story, or whether each part was recounted separately. Whatever the case, the edi- tor of the sugya understood Part A as an independent unit, and his percep- tion of the daughter of Nakdimon's conduct differed from the perception apparent in all the Palestinian versions. The B.T. version reflects the contri- bution of the editing to the story's meaning (see 4.2). d. Despite the blatant changes in the Pes. R. version it reflects the Pales- tinian tradition, not the Babylonian. The elaborate, detailed, explanatory, unequivocal structure testifies to a relatively late reworking of earlier rab- binic sources.34 4.1 (a) It once happened that R. Yohanan ben Zakkai was riding an ass, and his disciples followed him, 31. This separation exists in a number of exegeses; see above n. 6. 32. The interpretation is common in the Middle Ages as well, but I refrain from expand- ing upon the issue here. 33.

The story appears in the Sifre after Moses' words to Joshua: "The people that I am delivering to you are still kids, are still babies, do not be strict with them, etc.," and he says, "When Israel was a child, then I loved him" (Hosea 11:1). In the Friedmann edition the following is added: "and so he says 'and feed thy kids by the shepherds' tents.'" Even though the verse is missing from the Finkelstein edition, it is apparently because of the verse that the story is included in the passage, but the connection between the contents of the passage and the story is quite loose. The fact that the Sifre story is longer than those of group A stands out at first glance, but despite the duration of narrative time, the narrated time and narrative time are nearly identical, and the entire story is actually one part38 which relates the encounter between R. Yohanan ben Zakkai (henceforth: R. Yohanan) and the daughter of Nakdimon, which occurred some time after the Destruction. Thus the complex and intriguing time structure of the group A stories is missing in the Sifre version. The story opens with a harmonious description of R. Yohanan riding an ass with his disciples behind him (a), and the harmony is disrupted by the sight of the girl (b). From the word "Arab" one may infer that R. Yohanan could tell that the girl was Jewish but could not specifically identify her. By contrast, the girl immediately identified him, but tried to conceal her own identity and asked for something to eat (c). Both her covering her face with her hair-she had nothing else-and her request for food add to her degra- dation. At the sight of the girl's shocking poverty and, perhaps, because of her attempt to conceal her face, R. Yohanan asks her identity (d). Her answer (e) heightens his shock, which is expressed by his silence; the nar- rator's repetition of "she said to him" indicates that when R. Yohanan hears her father's name he says nothing. It is doubtful whether the girl at this point correctly senses what R. Yohanan feels, or what his silence implies. Her attempt to remind him that he signed her ketubbah (f) stands in contrast 38. The division into units is intended to shorten the discussion and the comparison.</page><page sequence="16">246 OFRA MEIR to her earlier attempt to conceal her identity (b) and shows his silence to be due either to his not remembering or to his incredulity at her situation. His address to the disciples (g) reveals that he remembers not only signing the ketubbah (h), but even the large amount specified (i) and the happy, opulent ways of her father's household (j)-but the miserable scene he is witnessing conjures up the terrible pain of the Destruction and its aftermath. The fate of the daughter of the wealthy class becomes a symbol for him of the fate of his people. The pain and sorrow stem from his awareness that Israel's fate was not brought about because of the Gentile nations' power or the Almighty's capriciousness, but rather was an inevitable result of the people's conduct. R. Yohanan shifts from the memory of the girl's recent past to an expres- sion of pain for the present with the words: "And all my life I have looked for [the meaning of] this scriptural text" (k) (see n. 36). Without negating the simple meaning of the verse or possible interpretations, the rhetorical phrase stresses the role of the scene as both an incentive to understanding the deepest meaning of the verse and also the close mutual relationship between it and reality. The meaning derived from the verse (1) and its exegesis (m) is interpreted at length at the conclusion of the story (n-p). R. Yohanan interprets the fate of the nation as punishment for sin. However, there is no mention of a particular sin committed by the girl, but a very general statement concerning Israel; if they do not perform the will of the Almighty "their fate is in the hands of a low people." The first part of the verse--"if thou know not"-has a dual meaning, whichever it is applied to-the girl or the nation; as an expression of the fate of the girl: (1) if before you did not know what lay in store for you, now that you are by the footsteps of the flock, you know: (2) if it is no longer possible to recognize you, this is because you are by the footsteps of the flock.39 As an expression of the fate of the nation: (1) if you did not understand the significance of your fate, know that "whenever Israel does the will of the Omnipresent, etc."; (2) if you did not know how to do the will of the Omnipresent, you go out and feed your bodies at the hands of a low people.40 The conclusion 39. Following Braude's translation, n. 29, which I feel is appropriate here also. 40. Compare the second interpretation with Rashi, s.v. "im lo ted'i," B.T. Ket. 67a. Regarding the Arabs, see Elimelech Epstein-Halevi, Ha'aggadah-ha-hislorit-biyyografit (Tel Aviv, 1975), pp. 257-58. Although it is reasonable that the choice of Arabs echoes a historical fact (in Halevi's opinion), it would not be far wrong to suppose the play on words ,'Ya (shepherds) ~y (Arabs) had some influence.</page><page sequence="17">THE STORY AS HERMENEUTIC DEVICE 247 "beneath the feet of cattle of a low people" smoothly connects, both in form and content, the opening picture (b) to the verse and its exegesis. 4.2 In the first five segments of the B.T. version (Appendix III. B), there are three minor variations in addition to several major ones. The minor varia- tions are: (1) in (a) the word "ass" is followed by "and he was leaving Jeru- salem"; (2) in (b) the words "who was" precede "picking" and instead of "feet" comes "dung"; (3) in (c) instead of "R. Yohanan" it just says "him." The major variations are as follows: (1) after the girl says she is the daughter of Nakdimon ben Gurion (e) the following is added: He said to her: My daughter, the wealth of your father's house, where has it gone? She said to him: Is there not a proverb current in Jerusalem, The salt of money is diminution, and others say benevolence. And (the wealth) of your father-in-law's house, where is it? She said to him: The one came and destroyed the other. 7137 n*3 ,,,'I'9, X?nna 7,nn 7ID X, ? -92.- :*I nxN ?NX,7n 1,92M n,9 ?W 71nn :n* "x .-t nx ",7nxiit x2 :* n'rnx ?xvn 7,n "]9nn n,='l?u .-on. xn,1 , on The elimination of R. Yohanan's silence modifies the initial reaction to the depressing sight and delays the surge of thoughts, and in place of these comes a query as to the disappearance of her father's great wealth. Her reply is indirect, but unequivocal: the wealth was lost because her father did not give charity.41 She explains the loss of her father-in-law's wealth42 as a result of cooperation between the two wealthy families. Silence reigns after this, but it is different from the silence in the Sifre version. Here the sorrowful thought relates not only to the girl, but also to 41. Rashi interprets the proverb (s.v. "melah mamon beser") thus: "Whoever wants to salt his wealth-that is to preserve it-will regularly deplete it for charity, and this depletion is the wealth's continued existence. And others say 'benevolence' (Ton): he shall practice benevolence from it, and her father's household did not practice charity properly, and its wealth dissipated." See also Samuel Edels, s.v. "melab mamon heser" and the commentary 'Anaf Yosef (in 'Ein Ya'aqov), s.v. "'amerah lo, rabbi, la ke-dein," Halevi, ibid., p. 258, writes: "The proverb, 'the salt of money is missing should be understood at face value: money has no salt which can pre- serve it for a long time." According to his interpretation, the daughter does not blame her father for the loss of the money, but the discussion (Appendix III. C) makes the interpretation of the rishonim seem more acceptable. 42. Her father-in-law's identity has not been preserved in rabbinic sources, but see Tos. Kif., p. 270.</page><page sequence="18">248 OFRA MEIR the nation's wealthy who brought about their own destruction. Similarly her question, which breaks the silence, cannot be interpreted as a desire to know if the rabbi remembers her, but rather as an additional attempt to arouse his sympathy for her plight.43 (2) R. Yohanan's response does not include (j-m)-the customs of her father's house, the verse and its interpretation. R. Yohanan only mentions the sum in the ketubbah, "a million denarii of gold from her father's house aside from [that of] her father-in-law's house" (in contrast to the far lesser sum mentioned in the Sifre [ij), after which "R. Yohanan wept and said: Happy are you Israel when they do the will of the Omnipresent, etc." (the rest is as in the Sifre [n-p]). The B.T. narrator, who has the girl accuse the father of not giving charity, centers R. Yohanan's reaction on the girl's situation and her words, without the mediation or contribution of the verse. The opening "Happy are you Israel" at first seems inappropriate to the atmosphere or to the verb "wept," but it does fit in with the optimistic motif of his initial words.44 In the B.T. as in the Sifre, the girl's conduct is not at fault, but the aspect of personal punishment appears-even though it is for the conduct of her father, who did not do the Almighty's will. This passage is followed by ques- tions about Nadkimon's behavior: "Did not Nakdimon ben Gurion prac- tice charity?" A baraita which seemingly contradicts this is cited: "Surely it was taught: It was said of Nakdimon ben Gurion that when he walked from his house to the house of study, woolen clothes were spread beneath his feet and the poor followed behind him and rolled them up,"45 meaning that he did practice charity. But two answers are given: "If you wish I might reply: He did it for his own glorification. And if you prefer I might reply: He did not act as he should have." Either answer implicates Nakdimon in his daughter's plight. (His conduct in light of the account is discussed in the sugya, Appendix III. C). True, in the Sifre as well, the woman's and the nation's fate are seen in the framework of reward and punishment, but while the girl's specific pun- 43. Even though this interpretation can fit the Sifre version also, because the narrator in the two versions is not interested in finding a solution for the plight of the girl, it seems prefer- able to use this interpretation here only. Here, not only is the former interpretation untenable, but perhaps the daughter of Nakdimon is afraid that R. Yohanan has reservations about her because of her father's behavior. 44. See Samuel Edels's interpretation, s.v. "'ashrekha": "He said happy art thou in both cases because in truth both contradictory situations are to Israel's advantage, etc." 45. The passage, with a few variations, is found in the Sifre as part of R. Yohanan's words.</page><page sequence="19">THE STORY AS HERMENEUTIC DEVICE 249 ishment is part of the story, her sin can only be inferred from the general axiom that "when Israel does not do the will of the Omnipresent. . . ." By contrast, in the B.T. the transgression is specified in the story, and even though it is attributed to the father, it moves the story closer in spirit to the stories of group A. Indeed, at the end of the discussion on Nakdimon's conduct comes the following baraita: "R. Eleazar b. R. Zadok said: May I behold the Consola- tion, etc." along with the exegesis, "Do not read" (Appendix III. D). Even though the baraita is brought as an independent unit, the oath and the words "I saw her"-without specification of whom-show R. Eleazar's words to be part of a context involving a female figure, and in light of the subject at hand and the parallels in other texts, it is only reasonable that the reference is to the daughter of Nakdimon. The question is, in what context did R. Eleazar say what he did, according to the Babylonian tradition? Whether the latter baraita was cited at a certain stage as a reaction to the first story in the B.T., or whether it came in a different context, which we do not have, the editor of the discussion at hand chose to render it as a reaction to the second story, thereby mitigating its forcefulness, for two reasons: (1) the slight alterations in the picture of the girl in the second story and in R. Eleazar's words46 do not compensate for the actual repetition; (2) even though the Song of Songs verse comes as an innovation in relation to R. Yohanan's words, its position after these words emphasizes the different rhetorical structuring of the idea behind R. Yohanan's words more than it does the originality of the response. Therefore, two questions arise: (1) why was the baraita brought at all and (2) why was it placed here and not after the first story? As for the first question, it may be a case of preserving tradi- tion for its own sake, but it seems to me that the baraita added to the discus- sion two things that the editor did not want to relinquish: (1) R. Eleazar's testimony preserves the double meaning of his words as well as the element of understanding the nature of the sin which brought about the punishment (compare with 3.1); (2) without the baraita, the discussion would not echo the concept of the Bible's interpreting reality and vice versa-and so the matter transcends the question of the verse's contribution to the story. As for the second question, the baraita's coming after the first story would have 46. This is also the reason why it is doubtful that in the original context R. Eleazar responded to the second story in the B.T., even though from a chronological standpoint it is possible for R. Eleazar to have responded to a story about R. Yohanan.</page><page sequence="20">250 OFRA MEIR led to an interpretation of the girl's fate as a consequence of her conduct alone. This contradicts the spirit of both the first story with its moderate criticism of the daughter of Nakdimon, and the second story, which arouses empathy toward the girl. Coming after both stories, the baraita allows us to view them as complementary. The same rich daughter who sneered at 400 denarii of gold for perfumery, the girl whose father did not practice charity, was the one who picked grain after the Destruction and to whom R. Eleazar applied the verse. The worthlessness of money vis-a-vis the power of doing the Omnipotent's will finds cogent expression here. 4.3 The ARN version (Appendix V) opens with the sentence: "One time Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai was walking in the market place." Instead of (c) and (d) comes the section: He said to her: My daughter, who are you? She kept silent. Again he said to her: My daughter, who are you? She kept silent. She said to him: Wait for me. She wrapped herself with her hair and sat down before him. She said to him: Rabbi, I am the daughter of Nakdimon ben Gurion. R. Yohanan's pleas to the girl for answers, her repeated refusals and her not requesting, "Rabbi, feed me" while identifying herself, all serve to delineate the girl's shame, alongside her attempt to preserve some of her honor despite her degradation. As in the B.T. version, R. Yohanan at this point queries her on the whereabouts of the money. The girl gives the same replies as in the B.T. and upon hearing them, R. Yohanan addresses his disciples (mentioned for the first time here) and says: All my life I have read this Scriptural text, "If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, Go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, etc." and not learnt [the meaning of] what is written, Till I came today and learnt what was written, that Israel has been surrendered to the lowest of peoples, and not merely to a low people, but to their cattle dung. The passage parallels (k), (1), (o) and (p) in the Sifre, but the elimination of the optimistic motif of the reward (n) found in the Sifre and B.T., and the addition of the section in which the girl accuses her father, elucidate the sin and bolster the aspect of punishment (as compared to the B.T.). Even though the excess verbiage in (k) detracts, the verse can be interpreted as in the Sifre-except for one thing: if the phrase "if thou know not" applies to the girl, this would contradict her knowing about her father's deeds-unlike</page><page sequence="21">THE STORY AS HERMENEUTIC DEVICE 251 R. Yohanan, who hears of these deeds from her. The more obvious meaning of the phrase, therefore, is the one concerning the fate of the people, and the more personalized meaning is overshadowed. Until this point the ARN version seems to follow a natural development and seems to lie between the Sifre and the B.T. versions. The remark about having discovered the meaning of the verse combines with the perception of the sinfulness of not practicing charity, and the sum of the ketubbah is ignored. However, the matter of the sum and that of the customs of her father's household ([f], [h], [i] and [j] in the Sifre version) follow the rabbi's words (the portion is introduced with the word "again") and upset the struc- ture of the story. After reaching an oratorical climax, why should R. Yoha- nan reminisce about former wealth? The power of the sections in the Sifre and B.T. on the past lies in their heightening the contrast between the girl's current and former situations. In ARN, the reference to the past is grafted superfluously onto the end of the story. 4.4 Our discussion of the group Ba stories may be summarized as follows: a. The three versions contain nine elements which testify to their stemming from the same source: the names of the characters; the correspondence between narrated and narrative time; the presence of disciples to whom R. Yohanan addresses his response; the portrayal of the girl picking grain beneath the feet of Arab cattle; her wrapping herself with her hair; her encounter and conversation with R. Yohanan; the sum of the ketubbah which R. Yohanan signed; R. Yohanan's seeing the rich girl's fall from former greatness as a symbol of the Destruction; and the interpretation of the girl's and the nation's fate along lines of reward and punishment despite the girl's innocence. b. All nine of the common elements determine the meaning of the Sifre ver- sion and endow the verse with dual meaning on both the national and indi- vidual planes. The Sifre version, lacking any reference to a particular sin, is the furthest of the three from the group A stories and appears to be the earliest version in this group. c. Presenting the first story in the B.T. as that of R. Judah in the name of Ray while the second story is brought as a baraita ("the rabbis taught"), reinforces the assumption that two different traditions existed regarding the daughter of Nakdimon. However, it is difficult to decide whether presenting R. Eleazar's words as a baraita was a separate tradition or whether they were separated from the first story for editorial purposes. Whatever the case, the editing is clearly felt in the carefully thought out assemblage of the</page><page sequence="22">252 OFRA MEIR elements of the discussion and in the shaping of the stories themselves. Only in the B.T. does the verse come as a response to both of the stories taken together-and despite its separation from them, it gains special, impressive significance in light of both the stories. Therefore, I see the changes which accrue in the B.T. vis-a-vis the Sifre as reflecting the editor's (editors'?) viewpoint and not ARN's influence (see also conclusion d). d. There are two possible conclusions concerning the ARN version, the least accomplished version from a literary standpoint: (1) it is the earliest version in the group and served as the model for the Sifre, which eliminated the girl's silence and the accusation of her father and incorporated linguistic, stylistic and editorial changes-and also for the B.T., which included other changes: this possibility is supported by the widespread assumption that ARN was compiled in a relatively early period;47 (2) this is the latest version in the group and is based on the B.T. version and the tradition in the Sifre. My own inclination toward the second possibility stems primarily from the addition of the section: "Is there not a proverb current. . . ." The appear- ance of Aramaic in the middle of a Hebrew tannaitic text (the story in the B.T. is brought as a baraita) testifies to a later reworking of an earlier source. In the B.T. the structure of the story is understandable because of the way the story fits into the context of the sugya as a whole. But in the ARN, where the context is similar to that of the Sifre (and like the Sifre the connec- tion between story and context is loose)-there is no explanation for the addition of the section and it seems that its appearance is due to the influence of the B.T. Furthermore, the excess verbiage in (k), the transfer- ence of the encounter location to the market48 and the reduced correspon- dence between the various parts of the verse and the image of the girl all savor of the character of later rabbinic texts. e. In both ARN and the B.T. the meaning of punishment as derived from the verse is related to the father's sin; but only in the B.T., with the citing of R. Eleazar's words, are the two meanings of the early Palestinian sources pre- served. 5. Once R. Yohanan b. Zakkai was going up to Emmaus in Judea and he saw a girl who was picking barley-corn out of the excrement of a horse. Said R. 47. See Finkelstein, above n. 8. 48. Picking grain under the feet of cattle is more probable outside the city. Yet it is inter- esting that in the Pes. R., undoubtedly a relatively late midrash, the encounter is also in the market.</page><page sequence="23">THE STORY AS HERMENEUTIC DEVICE 253 Yohanan b. Zakkai to his disciples: What is this girl? They said to him: She is a Jewish girl. And to whom does this horse belong? To an Arab horseman, the disciples answered him. Then said R. Yohanan b. Zakkai to his disciples: All my life I have been reading this verse and I have not realized its full meaning: "If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, etc." You were unwilling to be subject to God, behold now you are subjected to the most inferior of the nations, the Arabs, You were unwilling to pay the head-tax to God "a beqa' a head" (Exod. 38:26), now you are paying a head-tax of fifteen shekels under a govern- ment of your enemies. You were unwilling to repair the roads and streets leading up to the Temple; now you have to keep in repair the posts and stations on the road to the royal cities. ,* nnn ,,yrnv n-,2 ? n ,v nnx - rm-r9 ,rnI-1 D fx w ,I  pT 7:7m'I , "9- (Mekhilta, Ba-hIodesh 1, ed. Lauterbach, 193-94; ed. Horowitz-Rabin, p. 203) The elements which the Mek. and group B versions have in common are the time structure, R. Yohanan, the disciples and the sight of the girl pick- ing barley grain. Furthermore, as in the ARN and Sifre versions, R. Yohanan discovers the true meaning of the Song verse on seeing the girl. However, there are nine significant differences: (a) Only in the Mek. is the location Emmaus in Judea. Emmaus's location between Jerusalem and Yavneh is appropriate for a story about R. Yohanan after the year 70. (b) The girl is picking barley grain out of horse dung. The substitution of dung for feet (the change is also found in the B.T.) emphasizes the degrada- tion. (c) R. Yohanan questions the disciples about the girl's nationality, either because he could not tell for sure or because he wanted to direct their atten- tion to the shocking sight; at any rate, the girl is neither the daughter of Nakdimon nor a daughter of a rich household; she has no specific identity.</page><page sequence="24">254 OFRA MEIR Although the word "girl" (n,'n) is not usually appropriate for a married woman, here it is appropriate. (d) The prominence of the contrast between "she is a Jewish girl" (wn nnsv) and "to an Arab horseman" (in s~i) hinges on a play on words, which reflects the degradation of being subjugated to an Arab, of all people.49 (e) There is no discourse whatsoever between the girl and R. Yohanan. Even though the details of the discourse in the group B stories dramatize the appalling fall from affluence, the girl who turns to R. Yohanan for help finds no salvation. In the Mek. the problem does not arise at all. (f) A Jewish girl-anonymous and unlinked to any particular socio- economic class-serving as a symbol of the nation is a powerful image. The results of the Destruction transcend the loss of money. (g) The verse gains added significance through the threefold repetition of Israel's sins and punishment, which ties in well with the Destruction and the loss of political independence.50 (h) The three direct addresses to the disciples, introduced by "You were unwilling," dull the pain and convert the verse into an unequivocal castiga- tion of the nation in its current situation, without expressing the optimistic note of "whenever the people do the will of the Omnipresent." (i) Even though in the Mek. as well it is the spectacle of the girl which evokes the true meaning of the verse, R. Yohanan does not apply the verse to her (unlike R. Eleazar), and unlike the group B versions, R. Yohanan does not speak to her. The dual meaning is dramatically altered: "If thou know not, thou fairest among women" is applied to the nation-which not only knew, but refused-and "go thy way forth, etc." is the inexorable punishment of national subjugation. It should be noted that the spirit of the story fits the structure of the exegesis of which the story is a part. The question of reckoning time, which derives from the verse, "In the third month since the children of Israel went 49. Compare with Halevi, above n. 40. 50. E. E. Urbach ("Ha-Yehudim be-'argam bi-tequfat ha-tanna'im," Bebhinot 4 [1953]: 70), writes: "unbiased inspection of this story shows that the entire issue of 'you did not want, etc.' is a later addition. R. Yohanan, upon witnessing the spectacle, read out only the verse 'if thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock.' The person who adds this draws the conclusion from the story, and this addition is absent in all the parallel sources, etc. The addition should be ascribed to the time of its being included in the compilation." In my opinion, the whole story in the Mek. is the result of editing. We have no reliable way of examining the history of the story before the editing, and rabbinic stories reflect the compilers' standpoints more than they do the reality of the periods narrated.</page><page sequence="25">THE STORY AS HERMENEUTIC DEVICE 255 forth out of the land of Egypt" (Exod. 29.1) is, in the exegesis, built around four central events: the exodus from Egypt, the building of the Temple, the Destruction and the subjugation to others. The Destruction and subjuga- tion are explained as direct results of the refusal of the children of Israel to comply with God's will. "They did not want to make appointments for its construction, so they will appoint for its destruction, etc., they did not want to make appointments for themselves, they will appoint for others, etc."; the Song of Songs verse and two verses from the tokhabah chapter (Deut. 28:47-48) are cited as support for this interpretation. Already in this intro- duction the verse from the Song of Songs is directly applied to the people of Israel, and together with the verses from Deuteronomy, it takes on a severe implication: the nation which did not do the will of its God received the punishment of subjugation and famine. As a matter of fact, even following the story, the harsh language persists in the exegesis of the Deuteronomy verse. What is the connection between the Mekhilta version and the others? The history of rabbinic traditions before their transcription is enshrouded in an uncertainty which may never be dispelled. Therefore, it makes most sense to view the Mekhilta version as a third version, independent of either the group A or B versions-and to refrain from attempting to fix its date. Even so, one particular comment made in Wacholder's thought-provoking article on the date of the Mekhilta5' deserves a response. In n. 38, (pp. 127-28) he writes the following about our story: [It] seems to follow Avot de-Rabbi Nathan XVII, p. 33a [a posttalmudic source] rather than B. Ketubot 66b-67a; or Sifre, Deut. 305; or Tos. ibid, V 10, p. 267; or P. ibid V, end, p. 30c. For only Avot de-Rabbi Nathan, and after it the Mekhilta, attributes the story to Yohanan ben Zakkai; the Talmudic sources and the Tosefta cite here Simeon ben Eleazar. I assume that the last line is a printing error, for the story is in fact attributed to R. Eleazar b. R. Zadok. However, even after the correction the note is not precise. As we have seen, the name R. Yohanan appears in four versions (including the B.T. version), while the name R. Eleazar b. R. Zadok occurs in three Palestinian versions and in the B.T. baraita which follows the two stories. Wacholder believes the ARN is a later source and, by 51. Ben Zion Wacholder, "The Date of the Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael," Hebrew Union College Annual 39 (1968): 117-44.</page><page sequence="26">256 OFRA MEIR tracing the Mek. version to ARN, he supports his overall thesis that the Mek. is a later source. Wacholder's statement that the Mek. "had a real author" (p. 142) can explain its superb literary sense and style and its judi- cious brevity (qualities uncharacteristic of other late compilations), but it does not explain the essential elements of content which have no parallels in other sources and which testify to the Mek.'s being an original version. Except for the presence of R. Yohanan, there is no real similarity between the ARN and Mek. versions. It is thus that the Song of Songs verse is seen to take on different mean- ings in light of the variations in the versions-and that, simultaneously, the meanings of the verse determine the nature of the versions. By incorporat- ing a verse into a story, the sages could derive additional meaning from a verse, different from the meaning given in other rabbinic sources and entirely dependent on the framework of the story.
