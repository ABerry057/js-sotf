Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1986. x, 204 pp. At first blush, the courtier-rabbis of the Andalusian Hebrew "Golden Age" (ca. 950-1150) seem a most improbable breed of literati and an even more unlikely brand of clerics. On the one hand, they were deeply attached to Jewish tradition and meticulous in their observance of Jewish law; on the other, they were aficionados of Arabic paideia in Hebrew dress. How is it that an entire class of rabbinic scholars could have come to embrace Arabic rhetoric and style to the point of composing bacchic Hebrew wine songs or, more remarkably, lyrical songs of love for beloved "gazelles," male as well as female? Thematic innovations such as these signify but one dimension of the new direction in which the poets took Jewish culture and Hebrew litera- This review article was accepted for publication in 1987 and scheduled to appear in Vol. 13.

From the formal point of view Andalusian Hebrew poetry was an even bolder innovation, its peculiar fusion of biblical Hebrew locution with Arabic prosody and style a deviation from traditional poetic norms. It took a good deal of ingenuity and a willingness to compromise both Arabic quan- titative meters and principles of Hebrew grammar, but the first two genera- tions of Golden Age poets managed to transpose the distinctive prosodic patterns of Arabic to biblical Hebrew. Dfinash ben Labrdt (mid-tenth cen- tury), the first poet of the school, tinkered with only eight different meters. Within fifty years of Dfinash. Samuel the Nagid (993-1056) would employ no fewer than sixty-one meters-fourteen basic meters each with several variations. How, one wonders, could the poets have felt at ease superimpos- ing the prosodic norms, thematic framework, and style of Arabic poetry upon the sacred language of their Scripture? Such troublesome questions of motive and consciousness cannot be dis- counted as the product of our own insatiable (and often inventive) quest for contradictions. No sooner had the poets begun "to chirp in the days of Hasdai [ibn Shaprfit] the Nasi" than opposing voices were heard within and without the community of poets. Indeed, even during the heyday of the school, the poet Moses ibn Ezra (ca. 1055-1138) criticized his more irascible contemporaries for their excesses with a conventional motif (e.g., hijd' [invective]), and no less a Hebrew poet than Judah ha-Levi (1075-1141) assailed the Hebraicized Arabic meters with which he had spellbound the Jews of al-Andalus. A third apparent paradox of the Andalusian literary-creative process lies in the juxtaposition of the poets' secular verse with their piyyulim, a different species of Hebrew poetry appealing to a traditional set of ideals. Andalusian liturgical and devotional poetry (whose volume dwarfs the secular diwdns) was deeply influenced by the style and prosody of secular verse, but it was an ennobling and sublime rather than entertaining poetry given over to the communal or individual passion to draw closer to God. As liturgical poets the courtier-rabbis of the Golden Age strike us as "poets of high serious- ness" seeking Truth; but as secular poets they present themselves as "poets of wit and whimsy," that is, as skilled practitioners of the art of manipulat- ing language and hence reality. These two literary art forms, one inspira- tional, the other pleasurable, accommodated the courtier-rabbis' opposing world-views. But it should not seem odd if in actual practice they combined the serious with the playful and trifling, and the sacred with the profane. The ideal man lived in both worlds and found the ambiguity most attractive.</page><page sequence="3">OF RHETORIC, REVELRY, AND RABBIS 121 Conventional scholarship has consistently interpreted the poets' Arabi- cizing style and extravagant indulgences with the language of Scripture as manifestations of "cultural nationalism." This is not an unwarranted con- clusion when we consider that the poets frequently claimed to be defending the honor of Hebrew against the inimitable model of Arabic. To be sure, an ideology of Hebraism did sweep the Jewish literati of Andalusia in response to the regnant ideal of al-'arabiyya (Arabism). Jewish intellectuals were most anxious to demonstrate the eloquence of the Hebrew language and the stylistic elegance of the Hebrew Bible because it was no longer sufficient to simply regard Scripture as the true divine revelation. For the Hebrew Bible to compete with the "inimitable" Qur'in it now had to be seen as both beau- tiful and persuasive; that is, it had to stand out as a paradigm of aesthetic and rhetorical perfection. Philologists, grammarians, and exegetes took upon themselves the responsibility of rereading the Hebrew Bible in light of these new stylistic ideals (as well as in light of medieval rationalism). Poets found another way in which to contribute. Since Arabic scribes and poets freely dabbled in turning classical Arabic speech into Arabic poetry, it was only a matter of time until Jewish secretaries and courtiers would try their hand at Hebrew versifying in the new style. For all its thematic revelry in wine, women, young men, and song, the true pleasures of Golden Age Hebrew poetry come from its stylistic luster. It is often inadequately understood that the Hebrew poets were entranced by a rhetorical ideal of life perfectly suited to courtly culture. The purpose of this ideal, as it had been in late antiquity, was "to create pleasure and to win approval."' Poetry was a vehicle of entertainment, a means of generating literary pleasure as well as making an impression in the world of the court. This concept of literature and the attitude toward language it embodies (ornatus) were far removed from the manner in which the poets understood language as scholars of Jewish law or the way they employed it in their litur- gical compositions.2 The secular poem was thought of as a construct that came about when the poet decorated autonomous themes with the tricks of his trade-rhetorical ornamentation. A poet's originality and brilliance thus 1. Werner Jaeger, Paideia: The Ideals of Greek Culture (Oxford, 1944), 2:144, cited by R. A. Lanham, The Motives of Eloquence: Literary Rhetoric in the Renaissance (New Haven, 1976), p. 3 n. 1. 2. The rhetoric found in liturgical and devotional poetry is, in theory, purposeful rather than playful. It is rhetoric in service of a higher ideal rather than rhetoric for its own sake.</page><page sequence="4">122 ROSS BRANN lay in his ingenious refinement of convention, in his dazzling wordplay and puns, in his zestful ploys and literary ruses. A delightful illustration of how the rhetorical impulse contributed to the creation of Andalusian Hebrew poetry is the account of a literary dare pre- served in the dtwdn of Samuel the Nagid.3 Yehosef ha-Nagid's (Samuel's son and editor) superscriptions relate how the Nagid was in attendance at a liter- ary gathering during which some luscious apples were served. To one of the poets in the group the apples suggested a piquant line of Arabic verse (on the theme of apples and love), which naturally he recited. Quite in keeping with courtly etiquette, a second poet attempted a poetic Hebrew "translation." The company then apparently goaded the Nagid into composing a Hebrew rendition of the original line, whereupon Samuel improvised not one but two versions. A moment later the Nagid upstaged himself by extempora- neously rattling off an additional thirteen variations on the theme! This anecdote certainly signifies a master's reputation for virtuosity, and it neatly captures the competitive yet charming ambience of an Andalusian literary circle as well. I prefer to think of it as exemplifying how imaginative thema- tic leaps were subordinated to fascination with style and figuration, and how rhetorical ornamentation was elevated to a principle of the poet's art.4 For all its many pleasures, medieval Hebrew literature (both poetry and rhymed prose) can be an exacting and elusive form of literary discourse on account of its intricate language and style. To command its texts one must first know how the poets construed the language of the Hebrew Bible and how they constructed medieval Hebrew on the basis of that classical linguis- tic paradigm. This means that medieval exegetical texts as well as lexicogra- phic and linguistic literature must be open books to the student of medieval Hebrew poetry. Correspondingly, the model of Arabic poetry and poetics and the influence of the Arabic language on medieval Hebrew are profound. The latter matrix affected Hebrew syntax and semantics; the former dictated the tropology, motifs, prosody, and rhetorical style. These areas of inquiry 3. Diwan shemu'el ha-nagid; Ben Tehillim, ed. D. Yarden (Jerusalem, 1966), pp. 274-278. The anecdote is related in the superscriptions to poems 114-128. 4. A similar argument can be made to explain the poets' fondness for tajnts (paranomasia) mannerisms (cf. Moses ibn Ezra's Sefer ha'anaq), epigrams (cf. the Nagid's Ben mishlei), and other such "exquisite trifles."</page><page sequence="5">OF RHETORIC, REVELRY, AND RABBIS 123 and discourse do not even take into account the social, political, and intel- lectual history of the Jews of the Iberian peninsula or of adjacent Islamic domains, all of which is requisite knowledge for anyone hoping to approach Andalusian Hebrew poetry on intimate terms. And increasingly we are find- ing that Romance and Provenqal literary traditions may be able to illumin- ate aspects of Hebrew literary creativity in Spain (from the twelfth century onward) that cannot be explained within the framework of Islamic society and Arabic culture. This formidable syllabus suggests that medieval Hebrew poetry merits consideration as something more than a national literature. But paradoxically, due to the demands it imposes on the reader and perhaps on account of its often eccentric mannerisms, "popularity" and a secure place in any canon have eluded it. Following the demise of the Golden Age, Andalusian Hebrew poetry was kept alive by exclusive circles of connoisseurs. Medieval copyists in Christian Spain, Provence, Italy, Yemen, and Iraq quietly culled and trans- mitted the secular dfwans of the Andalusian masters.5 They preserved this poetry in manuscript, imitated it, synthesized and transformed its traditions, and in the end created their own styles of Hebrew poetry in both secular and liturgical composition. If they often seem unduly infuenced by the Andalu- sians' inflated claims to literary preeminence, it is because these "outsiders" were indoctrinated by writers such as Moses ibn Ezra, Judah al-Harizi, and Abraham ibn Daud and by the itinerant cultural propagandist Abraham ibn Ezra. Subsequent generations of Mediterranean and Yemeni Hebrew writers were infatuated with the Golden Age paradigm but selective in their appro- priation of it. Yemeni Jewish society, for instance, was governed by a cultural conservatism foreign to the Andalusian ethos. Its poets devoted themselves exclusively to piyyul, though they drew upon the figures of Andalusian secular verse for their sacred songs. By contrast, Hebrew poets in Italy occasionally mimicked the Andalusians, but mostly they were busy incorporating the latest Renaissance and baroque literary fashions into Hebrew. Post-Andalusian medieval and Renaissance Hebrew poets may not have written Golden Age-style Hebrew verse, but they studied their 5.

Nineteenth-century early-modern Jewish scholar- ship then discovered the "historical relevance" of medieval Hebrew poetry in both its secular and its liturgical forms. Research into the field of medieval Hebrew literature in general and Andalusian Hebrew poetry in particular can now be said to have moved out of the shadow of its primitive stages. Textual reconstruction of the Hebrew dfwdns is not yet complete,6 but invigorated by the literary finds in the Cairo Genizah it is a task well in hand. Our understanding of the normative poetics of the Andalusian school has progressed well beyond the one- dimensional descriptive poetics of David Yellin,7 due primarily to the late Dan Pagis's stylistic analysis of Moses ibn Ezra and the interrelationship between literary theory and poetry in that poet's work.s While literary- critical studies of specific texts have lagged, somewhat impressive advances have come in literary-historical and literary-theoretical studies. The first chapter of Pagis's Change and Tradition in the Secular Poetry, for instance, established the fundamental diachronic framework for further inquiry into Andalusian Hebrew verse.9 Pagis was the first scholar to synthesize what had been learned about the sociohistorical context of Hebrew poetry since Joseph Weiss's brief but seminal essay "Tarbut h.agranit weshirah h.agranit" (1947),1o in which it was argued that Golden Age Hebrew verse ought to be understood as reflecting the setting and values of courtier society in Islamic Spain. Hayyim Schirmann can be said to have applied this approach to the poetry in all of his work, but until Pagis no scholar had attempted to articu- late a comprehensive statement of what was known of the innate connection between secular Hebrew poetry and Jewish society. Scholars of medieval Hebrew poetry, responding to Pagis's cue as well as to developments in contemporary literary theory, are increasingly interested in the broad sociohistorical context from which Andalusian Hebrew poetry 6.

This direction in critical perspective has brought about a profound change in the kinds of questions asked of medieval Hebrew poetry and consequently in the methods employed to read it. For all their impressive erudition, earlier scholars, with the exception of Schirmann, demonstrated little in the way of what we would call literary sensibility. They variously regarded medieval Hebrew literary texts as quasi-documen- tary source material for the sociopolitical history of Spanish Jewry, as a philological resource for the history of Hebrew linguistics, as proof-texts from which the poets' biographies might be reconstructed, and as the basis for source-critical annotation of biblical and rabbinic Hebrew allusions embedded in the poems or source-critical inquiry into the Arabic models from which Hebrew poets worked. A modified version of the source-critical approach still lingers because some scholars are intent upon exhuming either biblical allusions or non-Hebraic sources as the key to the composi- tion of the text. Such work has been undeniably useful, but it has also been misleading and seemingly unaware of its own premises. Apologetic or ideological agendas have also clouded research into Anda- lusian Hebrew poetry ever since it assumed a place of honor in the "civi- lized" canon of nineteenth-century Jewish scholarship. Early-modern scholars, disdainful of the austere piety of piyyul, appropriated the secular poetry of the Golden Age as a historical model of enlightened Jewish cul- ture. To a certain extent the tables have turned, for it is now asserted that in the span of things Jewish the Andalusian school was but a fad, the passing fancy of a distinct class of Jews. According to this revisionist logic, shirat ha-bol may be relegated to an isolated corner of Hebrew literary history for two reasons. First, because the poets' obsession with literary elegance barely found its way to other strata of Andalusian Jewish society; and second, because Golden Age secular poetry had no lasting impact on the course of Hebrew literature, in contrast to, say, the Andalusian piyyul A fall-back position for those unable to deny the vibrancy of secular Hebrew poetry is, as we observed, to sacralize it by regarding it as the formal literary expres- sion of the new doctrine of cultural nationalism. In this transparently 11. Two interesting applications of this perspective are Joseph Yahalom, "Poetry and Society in Egypt: An Examination Based on the Attitude to Judah ha-Levi's Secular Poetry" [Heb.], Zion 45 (1980): 286-298, and Raymond P.

A poet like Moses ibn Ezra who subscribes to both Jewish and Arabic cultural norms is consequently stigma- tized for his "assimilationist" tendencies.12 Paul Zumthor's incisive articulation of the problem of reading medieval texts might well be applied to Andalusian Hebrew poetry: "The ultimate term we aim for is really to bring the ancient text into the present, that is, to integrate it into that historicity which is ours. The pitfall is that in doing so we may deny or obscure its own historicity: we may foreshorten the his- torical perspective and, by giving an achronic shape to the past, hide the specific traits of the present."'3 Pagis's second book dispelled many of the generalizations and misapprehensions noted above. He showed that secular medieval Hebrew literature from Muslim Spain to Renaissance Italy devel- oped continuously; that the popularity of this literature resulted in its wide- spread dissemination and influence; that "cultural nationalism" was but one of a bundle of factors contributing to the vitality and success of the school; and that secular Hebrew literature coexisted, often in "creative dissonance," alongside piyyul. Raymond Scheindlin's work also signals an abrupt departure from earlier approaches, a departure which promises to clarify the significance of medieval Hebrew literary texts, amplify the complexity with which we regard them, and enhance the refinement with which we can read them today. Scheindlin's methods deftly circumvent both of Zumthor's interpre- tive time-traps. Like Pagis before him he scrutinizes medieval Hebrew poetry on its own terms, that is, in light of the conventions and codes which circumscribe the range of meanings a text may have, but with a discriminat- ing, modern critical eye toward the structures, contradictions, and social function of its discourse. He first tested this method in his "Rabbi Moshe 12. For example, N. Allony, "The Reaction of Moses ibn Ezra to 'Arabiyya," Bulletin of the Institute for Jewish Studies 1 (1973): 19-40; and idem, ed., Ya'aqov ben El'azar: Kitab al-kamil (Jerusalem, 1977), pp. 6-8. 13.

Scheindlin showed that far from being the ars poetica for which it had always been taken, Ibn Ezra's Kitcb al-muhdkiara wa-'l-mudhcdkara (The Book of Discussion and Conversa- tion)'5 signified an ambivalent defense of the poetry of the Andalusian school. His innovation was to regard Ibn Ezra's text as a document of Andalusian Jewish culture rather than as a prescriptive book of poetics. This insight led him to examine the unusual structure of the book and the puz- zling configuration of its arguments. Now Scheindlin has brought this criti- cal perspective to bear on Andalusian Hebrew poetry itself. According to his new book, WVine, Women, and Death: Medieval Hebrew Poems on the Good Life, the path to understanding the Andalusian poets' peculiar blend of poetic sophistication and traditionalism lies in perceiving the Jewish culture of al-Andalus as a model of "creative acculturation" which supported "two opposing principles of life": this world and its pleasures (dunya), and the world of God and ultimate reality ('akhira) (p. 28). Wine, Women, and Death was conceived as an introduction to the liter- ary and cultural universe of Andalusian Jewry during the two hundred years from 950 until 1150. A few disgruntled readers will undoubtedly take issue with Scheindlin on this account, averring that so expert and adept a writer as he should direct (that is, restrict) his insights to a truly worthy audience, namely those who inhabit the privileged turrets of the academy. To be sure, the author himself implies that his book is intended for the novice rather than the initiate. However, I would caution curious academics not to be put off by his modesty. In this case the contrast of audiences may be somewhat more apparent than real, because, while the anthological form of the book may be popular, its contents are not. Throughout four splendid chapters, the author takes great care to render highly "esoteric" material accessible to the nonspecialist, but comparativists, especially Arabists and Hispanists and even scholars of other epochs in Hebrew literature who know of the "Golden Age" of Hebrew culture in Muslim Spain but find its texts either inaccessible or forbidding, will discover a "garden of earthly delights" in Wine, Women, and Death. 14.

Hebrew wine poetry, modeled after the 'Abbisid Arabic genre of khamriyydt, is the subject of the first chapter; Hebrew courtly love poetry, of both the homosexual and heterosexual gender modes, based on the Arabic ghazal genre, constitutes the second chapter; and meditative and reflective poems derived in part from zuhdiyydt ("ascetic") and gnomic verse make up the third. Each of the three chapters of poems is preceded by an introduction to the particular genre and its con- ventions, including a discussion of the social setting and intellectual context from which the genre emerged. The genre introductions and the texts, trans- lations, and analyses are themselves prefaced by a concise but penetrating introduction to the period, the poets, and their culture. This framework enables the reader to follow the detail of the comments on the poems as well as to appreciate the typically medieval interplay between convention and innovation about which the poets' creativity revolves. Scheindlin's analyses of the poems-highly suggestive textual notes, really-are tantalizingly brief. They have been framed as guides to reading the poem rather than as exhaustive explications or presumptuous "definitive interpretations." Instead, Scheindlin invites the reader to explore variant English translations and other readings. This is a subtle way of emphasizing respect for the poems and for the process of reading them anew. Scheindlin's methodological stroke is to break down the rigid and artifi- cial distinctions that have been erected between Hebrew poetry and other manifestations of Andalusian culture. Unlike interpreters who tend to reify the medieval Hebrew poem as a text unto itself, he proposes that we think of the Golden Age poem in relation to the system of culture from which it comes. This approach takes the reader into the heart of the Andalusian experience: the sights, sound, and smells of the Andalusian garden; the etiquette of quaffing at a wine soiree; the manners of courtly love; and the ideal world of Neoplatonic philosophy. Scheindlin cracks the artistic, social, and intellectual codes the poets employed to produce their poetry, and in so doing he has given us a new way of looking at the poems. A literary-intellectual profile of the four most important Hebrew poets represented in his collection of poems supports Scheindlin's expansive con- cept of the relationship of Hebrew poetry to Andalusian culture. Samuel the Nagid was a Hebrew grammarian, a rabbinic scholar, an exegete, and in all likelihood a religious polemicist; Solomon ibn Gabirol devoted himself to</page><page sequence="11">OF RHETORIC, REVELRY, AND RABBIS 129 philosophical studies, and when he was very young he seems to have been involved in grammatical research; Moses ibn Ezra was a philosopher, a liter- ary critic, and a literary theorist; Judah ha-Levi was a Jewish theologian and a physician; and Abraham ibn Ezra (not represented in the collection) was an exegete, a Hebrew grammarian, and a scientist. All but the Nagid were also prolific liturgical poets. Knowledge, then, was not so fragmented a commodity as we are accustomed to think. But even more to the point is the realization that the poetic imagination was touched by virtually every man- ner of experience, form of culture, and thought. To the modern sensibility, undoubtedly the most engaging issue to arise from reading Andalusian Hebrew poetry is the question of what was meant by its love poetry. Quite naturally, there is a desire to grasp at the social and biographical implications of the lyrics of love. Did the courtier-rabbis actually dally with maidens and young men, or did they merely ogle them? Or is it correct to regard the entire genre as the product of the literary imagination, and if so, to what end? These were questions of some sensitivity even during the Golden Age. The Nagid's son Yehosef, for instance, intro- duced his father's diwan with an apologetic declaration: the erotic themes in Samuel's poetry are metaphors signifying the love between God and Israel! The genre of love poetry found an adroit defender, though an ambivalent one, in Moses ibn Ezra. Moses maintained that love poetry was not in- herently bound to experience ("one could compose a [fine] love poem with- out ever loving"), and he justified erotic language and themes by observing that they are well represented in the Hebrew Bible and therefore sanctioned by tradition. Andalusian Hebrew love poetry is a subject historically approached with caution. Had the Hebrew poets somehow been outsiders to Andalusian- Jewish society rather than its courtier-rabbis, I suspect that the issue of their intention would not have become so highly charged. The uniqueness of the poets of the Golden Age is that they stood at the very center of Andalusian Jewish society, serving as its scholars and communal leaders. Ignaz Gold- ziher, the great Islamicist, commented that medieval Arabic poetry (whose sukhf [obscenity], Scheindlin notes, can make Hebrew poetry seem like "chasteness itself") represented something of a protest against the strin- gency of orthodox Islam and its hypocrisies.'6 Arabic poets too were always 16.

Stern (Albany, 1967), vol. 1, pp. 35-36.</page><page sequence="12">130 ROSS BRANN close to the courts, the centers of political power and patronage. But unlike the courtier-rabbis of Jewish society, they never served as the 'ulamd' of Muslim society. The insolent ironies and mock-subversive tones of Hebrew poetry thus present the reader with a different set of ambiguities. Roughly thirty years ago Schirmann and Nehemiah Allony locked horns in a contentious polemic concerning the extreme case: the significance of homosexual love poetry." Essentially, Schirmann referred to a "literary homosexuality" inspired by the Arabic model. He allowed, however, that the conventional thematic framework bespoke sublimated feeling, and he did not rule out the possibility (remote, he felt) that the poems might reflect the actual experience of some poets. Allony would not even concede the con- cept of a "literary homosexuality" when it came to the rabbis of al-Andalus. The genre, he asserted, was nothing more than a stylistic exercise. The poets' devotion to Hebrew, the sign of their cultural nationalism, required that they match Arabic eloquence and rhetoric in every detail of literary fashion. Other scholars have since entered the fray, but the terms of the controversy have changed little since Schirmann and Allony. Scheindlin's contribution to this debate is an excellent illustration of his method for reading all of Golden Age poetry. Following Schirmann and Pagis, he argues that the stylized form and conventional nature of the material do not invalidate the possibility of experience or the sincerity of feelings expressed, "whether they arise from real love or imaginary love." Scheindlin, however, redefines the issue. The reader is advised to leave aside the historical and biographical questions which absorb us, to focus on more relevant literary questions. What is the conception of love that is expressed in the poems? How did the genre serve the poets' artistic needs? Scheindlin suggests that the Golden Age love poem is actually a ritual celebration of the relationship between an "observer and beauty observed" rather than "that of lover and beloved" (p. 79). Moses Ibn Ezra's muwashshah (strophic poem) "Daddei yefat to'ar" ("Caress a lovely woman's breast") (pp. 90-95) might first appear to be an exquisite specimen of an insolent love song. Scheindlin, however, is able to demonstrate how the poem proceeds from a Neoplatonic world-view to lay out "a whole theory of pleasure" in which 17.

We are dealing with a literature of ideal types in which the individuality of the beloved and the experience of the poet are secondary to the communal, that is, the class ideal in the service of beauty. Homosexual love poetry, the author asserts, is but a variation on the theme of adoration of beauty. I have tried to suggest that this book, for all its lack of pretense, is of sur- passing importance because of its inventive approach to Golden Age poetry. Yet it is likely that the book will be recognized principally for its transla- tions, which are, arguably, its most distinctive achievement. Scheindlin has invested an inordinate amount of ambition, time, and energy in devising ways to render Andalusian Hebrew verse into poetic English. His superb translations seem all the more remarkable when compared with prior efforts, which were, with one exception, uninspired and faulty.'" Only T. Carmi, whose fine The Penguin Book of Hebrew Verse (1981)9 includes a substantial corpus of Andalusian Hebrew poetry, succeeded in rendering this poetry into meaningful English. Carmi, a gifted American-born Israeli poet, is thoroughly conversant with American English idiom and eminently capable of producing poetic translations. However, by rendering prose translations of the poems he apparently deferred to the editorial policy of the Penguin Anthology series. The result is that his translations neatly con- vey the thematic content of medieval Hebrew verse but leave its formal and stylistic elements, which is to say its elegance, fallow by comparison. Aspects of medieval Hebrew poetry previously hidden from the reader in translation can now be studied from Scheindlin's diaphanous renderings. For example, the sound of rhetorically balanced word-play and the rhyth- mic "rise and fall" of every verse toward its inevitable monorhyme were sensations essential to the experience of hearing a medieval Hebrew or Arabic poem. To capture affects and effects such as these, the author sacri- fices lexical precision and normal syntax in order to recreate the style and tone of the Hebrew. To simulate rhythm he employs familiar English rhythms (mostly a variety of iambic meters), and for idioms he draws upon various registers of English, from the archaic (but not arcane) to the deci- dedly contemporary ("Altogether wasted me" [p. 103]). Since, as I have 18. See, for example, Leon J. Weinberger, Jewish Prince in Moslem Spain: Selected Poems of Samuel ibn Nagrela (Tuscaloosa, Ala., 1973), and David Goldstein, The Jewish Poets of Spain, revised and expanded edition (New York, 1971). 19. New York, 1981.</page><page sequence="14">132 ROSS BRANN tried to make clear, the medieval Hebrew poem prizes the rhetorical style in which the poet recasts the conventional materials that are its content, Scheindlin's translations are truly poetic because they are calculated to sug- gest the sound as well as the sense of the original texts. Readers who know Hebrew may debate the translator's liberties with a given line, but they would find it baffling to counter his philosophy of translation or its execu- tion with another model as apposite to the stylistic nuances of Andalusian Hebrew verse. To return briefly to the issue of audience: One of Scheindlin's avowed purposes in writing the book was to elicit interest in the Golden Age as a paradigm of creative cultural interaction (p. ix). It is not so much that he aims to "enlarge the canon" of Hebrew literature, which too often is restrict- ed to the Hebrew Bible and modern Israeli letters. Rather, he inducts readers into the literary pleasures of medieval Hebrew poetry in the hope of persuading contemporary Jewry that creative cultural interaction between Jews and non-Jews is both desirable and possible without compromising what he loosely refers to as "Jewish identity." He serves notice that his "intention is not apologetic," but his statement of purpose at least (articulat- ed in the foreword, introduction, and afterword) seems somewhat argu- mentative. Finally, Wine, Women, and Death is brimming with confidence in lan- guage, learning, and life-the very elements that engrossed the elites of Muslim Spain with such vitality. The reader is treated to a sense of the enchantment with language and literature and the enthralling power of beauty to which all of the peoples of al-Andalus were keenly attuned. At every turn it is obvious that the author shares these values, and he communi- cates them to his readers in a prose style that is masterfully artful while seemingly effortless. Readers enlightened by Scheindlin's approach to Andalusian secular Hebrew poetry will wait impatiently for the companion volume in which he promises to cast his scholarly spell on the liturgical and devotional poetry composed by the same courtier-rabbis who in their worldly guise reveled in the lyrics of love and death.
