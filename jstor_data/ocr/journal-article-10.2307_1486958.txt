Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1988. 176 pp. In this new book, Gordon Newby has undertaken the first major examination of Arabian Jewish history since H. Z. Hirschberg's Yisra'el ba- 'Arav (Tel Aviv, 1946) and Y. Ben Ze'ev's Ha-Yehudim ba-'Arav (Jerusa- lem, 1957). Rather than merely recapitulating the data that Hirschberg and Ben Ze'ev had collected from Greco-Roman, rabbinic, and Arabic sources, and from archaeological evidence, and of course considering the additional work that has been done in the past three decades, Newby has tried to reas- sess the materials at hand, to ask of them new questions, and to extract from them new constructions. The result of this effort, though not always satisfy- ing, is generally engaging and thought-provoking. After introducing Arabia in the first chapter, Newby reviews in the second chapter the Arabic legends concerning the origins of the Jewish com- munities of the peninsula as recorded primarily in the Kitdb al-Aghdni, the great collection of lore compiled by the tenth-century Muslim scholar Abu 'l-Faraj al-ISfahani. He criticizes some of the early orientalists, who were too apt to be influenced by this legendary material. For Newby, much of it is merely foundation legends following recognizable topoi. He then somewhat disjunctively-and not as fully as one would like-argues for the impor- tance of linguistic evidence for the strongly integrated Jewish presence in Arabia at the very dawn of Islam. The setting for chapter 3 is Late Antiquity. Against this backdrop, the relations among Jews, Arabs, and Romans are reviewed. Newby hypothe- sizes the existence of Pharisaic (or Pharisaic-like) Jews in Arabia at the time of the Bar Kochba revolt. Although Jews had already been settled in Arabia for centuries, it was only after the suppression of the uprisings against Rome that Arabian Jewry's number was considerably augmented by fleeing refu- gees, and according to Newby, "it is after this that Arabian Judaism begins to flourish" (p. 32). The Arabian Jewry to which most of the book is dedicated is that of northern and western Arabia (al-IHijiz). However, in chapter 4 the early- sixth-century kingdom of the Jewish Himyarite ruler Yuisuf As'ar Dhui Nuwis is discussed in relation to Arabian Jewry as a whole and in order to</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 315 better understand the religiopolitical atmosphere that prevailed in Arabia in the century preceding the advent of Mul.ammad. Chapter 5 reconstructs aspects of Hijazi Jewish cultural life, while the following chapter reviews their none-too-felicitous relations with the Prophet of Islam. In attempting to portray the messianic and eschatological mindset of these Jews, Newby leads the reader on an extended excursus through the enchanted forest of Jewish mysticism in Late Antiquity. It is perhaps here, more than anywhere else in the book, that he offers innovative suggestions and explanations for the fragmentary glimpses of Arabian Jewish life and practice found in the Islamic sources. For the most part, however, these two chapters follow the well-trodden path paved by S. D. Goitein and others, and are completely in consonance with them. In chapter 7, Newby takes up the the question of whether Jews continued to inhabit Arabia after their reported expulsion by the second caliph, 'Umar I (ruled 634-644). After reviewing many of the often fantastic travelers' reports that have come down through the ages, Newby concludes that "the Jews of northern Arabia probably did survive in some form for a long per- iod after the rise of Islam, but how long and to what extent is impossible to say at this time" (p. 104). He cautiously avoids going as far as Itzhak Ben- Zvi, who believed that independent Jewish tribes may have survived in the region until as late as the eighteenth century, and indeed may have contin- ued to survive thereafter as crypto-Jews. Newby also rather boldly takes issue with Bernard Lewis on the overall importance of Arabian Jewry in the greater scheme of Jewish history. The book concludes with an "Afterword on Historiography," which, though very thoughtful and thought-provoking, is somewhat too theoretic- ally general. There are reviewers who delight in pointing to the occasional misprint as if it were typical of the work as a whole. I am not such a reviewer, but I must observe that the book should have been much more carefully edited. There are far too many typographical errors throughout. The inconsistencies in the transcription of Arabic words and names are very bothersome, and some are simply rendered incorrectly (e.g., Mu'awiyya instead of Mu'awiya). There are also one or two surprising mistranslations. For example, in a pas- sage from the Kitdb al-Aghdni, the Ara'bic phrase azharand 'lldh 'alayhim is rendered "God caused us to appear before them" (p. 15), whereas the idio- matic translation should be "God gave us victory over them."</page><page sequence="3">316 BOOK REVIEWS Despite these criticisms, this is a welcome book that offers the first sur- vey of its kind in English and provides much food for thought and further discussion.
