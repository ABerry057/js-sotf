Jewish Studies, Music Scholarship, and the Tilt Between Seminary and University1 by Judah M. Cohen In this essay, I explore the history of what has conventionally been described as "Jewish music" research in relation to parallel developments in both ethnomu sicology and Jewish studies in the American academic world during the twentieth century. As a case study, I argue, the issues inherent in understanding Jewish music's historical trajectory offer a complex portrait of scholarship that spans the discourses of community, practice, identity, and ideology. Subject to the prin ciples of Wissenschaft since the second half of the nineteenth century, Jewish music study has constantly negotiated the lines between the scholar and prac titioner; between the seminary, the conservatory, and the university; between the good of science, the assertion of a coherent Jewish narrative in history, and the perceived need to reconnect an attenuating Jewish populace with its reinvented tra ditions; and between the core questions of musicology, comparative musicology, theology, and modern ethnomusicology. Yet significantly, the study of Jewish music has also been at variance with the canonical trajectory of both fields: By the mid-twentieth century, as ethnomu sicology and Jewish studies began to (re)establish themselves in the university setting, most scholarly Jewish music activity took place in the seminary environ ment. Such a situation did not result mainly from some special attribute of music's nonliterary nature (an argument still invoked by some Jewish studies scholars) or Jews' ever-negotiated Western/non-Western status (an issue of particular complex ity in fields such as ethnomusicology, where this difference matters). Rather, as I attempt to show in this essay, the history of a "Jewish music" discipline in the twentieth century can be better comprehended through a framework of happen stance, personality, academic topography, and resource availability, paralleling 1.

Shortened ver sions were given at the 2004 Annual Meeting of the Association for Jewish Studies and the 2005 World Congress of Jewish Studies.

Cohen similar processes taking place in the construction of the fields of ethnomusicology and Jewish studies but yielding different results.2 It is impossible to consider the history of Jewish music study in the United States without recognizing the immense influence the rise of Jewish studies in the American academy had on it. According to Paul Ritterband and Harold Wechsler, America was the first place where universities took Jewish studies seriously (for a variety of reasons) and, as such, opened up American venues for learning and debating Jewish topics. Before the start of the twentieth century, with the excep tion of "classical" Hebrew language instruction, anyone wishing to study Judaism on an academic basis in America or Europe had to do so either in a seminary or in some form of Jewish "teacher's college." Even Leopold Zunz's concept of a Jewish Wissenschaft could not find its place in the university system before Amer ican institutions significantly opened their doors after the Second World War.3 Likewise with music: As Geoffrey Goldberg has discussed in detail, systematic Jewish music study in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Europe typically took place in state-sponsored teacher's "trade" schools (Lehrerseminare), where students tended to learn repertoires and traditions within a relatively narrow frame work of practice.4 The particularly American development of Jewish university studies effected a perceptual sea change in the meaning and context of Jewish learning in the United States. Whereas in the seminaries, education in Jewish subjects often served to reinforce belief and ensure the continuity of particular forms of Jewish practice and practitioners (on which seminaries depended for survival), Jewish study in the university typically earned discursive space on three fronts: as a historical and legal precedent to Christianity and the rest of the Western world, as a civilization that created foundational works of Western literature, and, later, as a people that never quite fit with the historical narratives of Western civilization. University study also, more importantly, exposed Jewish topics to broader disciplinary issues, a set of academic standards that valued evi dence over religious faith, and a new scale of erudition in the guise of the college degree (culminating in the PhD). Thus, from about the turn of the twentieth century, the very idea of what it meant to study Judaism in the United States broad ened and bifurcated into a university/seminary dynamic in a manner markedly different from Europe. This dynamic serves as the basis for my essay. "Jewish music" has thus far largely been explored within two frameworks: "tradition," which follows the 2. Philip V.

It is one thing, for example, to talk about concepts such as the "synagogue modes" (a system of musical scales and tone patterns believed to underlie much of Jewish chant) as a crucial com ponent of synagogue music for centuries, if not millennia. But it is quite another to suggest that Cantor Josef Singer codified the synagogue modes in earnest in 1886;7 that Abraham Zvi Idelsohn connected them with the Arabic maqam system and provided rules for harmonizing them in the early twentieth century;8 that Isadore Freed contextualized them within the Western music canon in 1958;9 and that Eric Werner asserted their ancient nature as a determi nant for Jewish identity throughout the second half of the twentieth century.10 Likewise with the study of Jewish music in general: The way in which scholars think about the topic today relies in large part on the ideology, politics, projects, and arbitrary decisions of those who achieved the status of Jewish music auth orities in the past. Such figures constitute actors in history whose actions helped define both the spaces and the conditions by which Jewish music would be analyzed, practiced, and evaluated. I orient my discussion here around two of the primary figures who fostered the institutional study of Jewish music in America: Abraham Zvi Idelsohn and Eric Werner. Today they are known primarily by their written contributions to the scholarship on music in Jewish life; in this study, however, I will touch on their pedagogical and administrative activities, which in many ways served a more crucial role for the practical understanding of continuity in Jewish musical studies. Their contrasting yet connected stories will, I hope, shed light on the broader cultural questions associated with music and Jewish scholarship in twentieth-century America. *** 5.

Cohen Throughout the early years of American Jewish studies, especially among practicing Jews, the seminary and the university maintained a tenuous relationship with each other.11 Several university-based Jewish studies faculty members (then typically housed in the university's Semitics department) held both rabbinic and doctoral degrees, a practice that continues into the twenty-first century. Moreover, when societal or economic conditions threatened to reduce the place of Jewish studies in the universities, seminaries became an important place of refuge. As I will describe, such fluctuation may have played an important role in the rise of a field of Jewish music. The start of the twentieth century, according to Ritterband and Wechsler, saw the continuation of several initiatives to include Jewish learning within the American university. After World War I, however, most of these attempts fell apart as a new wave of antisemitism, xenophobia, and immigration quotas swept the country.12 Both the Jewish Institute of Religion and Yeshiva College came into existence during this time (in 1922 and 1927, respectively); Hebrew Union College, the Jewish Theological Seminary, and other institutions of Jewish learning, meanwhile, began to expand and diversify their Jewish studies offerings in hopes of assuming the responsibilities of higher-level Jewish instruc tion. In a sense, the seminaries activated an ambition to "view universities as com peting, not complementary, institutions."13 Although detractors argued that a seminary could not attain the academic standards of a university, others saw few alternatives for Jewish learning. It was in this environment, in 1924, that Hebrew Union College would hire Abraham Zvi Idelsohn.14 Later known as the "father" of Jewish musicology, Idelsohn benefited from the seminary's alternate academic and ideological standards. Born in Latvia in 1882, Idelsohn had a yeshiva education and gained his musical knowledge through cantorial apprenticeships, a short tenure at Berlin's Stern Conservatory of Music, a great deal of travel to different European Jewish communities, and a one-year stint as a hazzan in Johannesburg, South Africa. Around 1907 he moved to Jerusalem, where, over the next fourteen years, he collected liturgical melodies from the various populations of Jews who had settled there from around the world; he attempted unsuccessfully to open an "Institute for Jewish Music"; he wrote the oratorio/musical drama Jiftah, started choirs, taught music and liturgy classes, and served as a hazzan in different capacities; he compiled and published anthologies of songs; and he became an important figure in the area's communal musical activities. Idelsohn also retained scholarly connections 11. Ritterband and Wechsler, Jewish Learning, 33-44. 12. Ibid., 128. 13. Ibid., 140. 14.

Shortly after leaving Palestine (perhaps due to ill health), Idelsohn traveled to the United States, where he spent 1922-23 building a national reputation as a Jewish music authority while serving as the cantor in New York for Mordecai Kaplan's Society for the Advancement of Judaism.15 After speaking at the annual meeting of the Reform movement's Central Conference for American Rabbis in the summer of 1923, the organization organized a national lecture tour for him.16 Several months later, in March 1924, Cincinnati's Hebrew Union College hired Idelsohn to catalog a recently acquired collection of music manuscripts from late nineteenth-century German cantor and musicologist Eduard Birnbaum, and to occupy a temporary position as a professor of liturgy and Jewish music. When the college officially appointed him to a full and perma nent faculty position in September 1925, Idelsohn became the only tenured pro fessor of his kind in the United States.17 Idelsohn's appointment preceded important trends in both the music and Jewish studies fields, coming five years before Cornell University established the nation's first chair in musicology18 and anticipating the rebroadening of post biblical Jewish studies offerings starting in the 1930s. Despite the precision of Idelsohn's scholarship, however, his qualifications as an instructor were less than standard within academic circles, particularly in comparison with other pro fessors specializing in Jewish topics. Only nominally trained in a German music conservatory, Idelsohn's major claim as a Jewish music practitioner came through his experience as a cantor (or hazzan)?a respected figure to much of the Jewish population, and clearly prestigious enough to secure a seminary appointment. But even with his years of research and his publication record, Idel sohn's accomplishments could not achieve the imprimatur of a university-trained scholar. His detailed writings offered a high level of professionalism and, in many ways, resembled the efforts of contemporary twentieth-century American musical fieldworkers such as Alice Cunningham Fletcher, Frances Densmore, and Helen 15.

Cohen Heffron Roberts.19 Fletcher, Densmore and Roberts, however, had far more aca demic training and university experience. Idelsohn, without a doctorate (or, for that matter, even a university degree), could earn recognition as a folklorist and a lirurgist of the Jewish people, and his works would be hailed as important. While celebrated within the Jewish academies of learning and honored by prominent university-based colleagues in prominent academic pos itions,20 however, he held little chance of crossing into the broader university system. As an instructor, moreover, Idelsohn left much to be desired. Rabbinical stu dents who took his courses at Hebrew Union College bemusedly recounted class sessions consisting almost entirely of his reading aloud from draft and published versions of his Jewish Music in Its Historical Development.2 His place at Hebrew Union College therefore seemed more oriented around his responsibilities to the Birnbaum collection than around his ability to turn out musically adept Reform rabbis, let alone students prepared to further his intellectual projects in Jewish music study. As a result of both an apparent lack of pedagogical skill and a lack of admin istrative support for the academic study of Jewish music at the Hebrew Union College campus, Idelsohn thus left few disciples who could continue his lines of inquiry, and none who could enter a university's music program. The seminary atmosphere in which he worked required him to teach almost exclusively rabbinic students, who viewed their musical training mainly as a way to enhance their reli gious vocations.22 Though he achieved a contemporary reputation as a prominent figure in both Jewish studies and comparative musicology, Idelsohn and his con siderable publication record nonetheless remained relatively isolated, and his active status as a musicologist was contexrualized within the framework of reli gious Jewish life. By the time he retired from his position in 1934, both music 19. Fletcher, Densmore, and Roberts all conducted musical fieldwork in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century with Native American populations. Their publications, like those of Idelsohn, focused largely on transcribing and contextualizing their own field recordings and observations, in part as a way to preserve the musical practices of endangered cultures. Like Idelsohn in relation to Jewish music, Fletcher, Densmore, and Roberts have been credited as important progenitors of the field of eth nomusicology. See, e.g., Walter Hough, "Alice Cunningham Fletcher," American Anthropologist, n.s., 25, no. 2 (1923): 254-58; Charles Hofmann, "Frances Densmore and the Music of the American Indian," Journal of American Folklore 59, no. 231 (1946): 45-50; and Charlotte J.

Several of Idelsohn's scholarly works, for example, saw publication thanks to grants from academic institutions, such as the Vienna Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Council of Learned Societies.

The one significant exception was Baruch J. Cohon, the musically talented son of Idelsohn's colleague Samuel S. Cohon and as close to a disciple as Idelsohn would get. Cohon's 1950 article on Jewish chant patterns, published in the Journal of the American Musicological Society, made him an heir apparent to Idelsohn's work, though Cohon had little subsequent scholarly output. See Baruch Joseph Cohon, "The Structure of the Synagogue Prayer-Chant," Journal of the American Musicological Society 3, no. 1 (1950): 17-32. 34</page><page sequence="7">Whither Jewish Music and Jewish studies had begun to expand in earnest as separate fields in American universities; yet Jewish music study would remain parked in the seminary, justified but also limited by the importance Idelsohn gave it as a central element of Jewish liturgy and ritual. From a practical perspective, however, Idelsohn's impact on Reform Judaism likely paved the way for a "scientific practice" of Jewish music in syna gogues throughout the United States. According to Edgar Siskin, a student of Idel sohn's at Hebrew Union College, Idelsohn seemed to inspire less by instruction than by example. He had not been the first music instructor at the seminary; at least two other music instructors had preceded Idelsohn in the previous decade alone.23 Yet Siskin identified Idelsohn's major impact on the rabbinic students as his efforts to "[change] the music and liturgy of the chapel services" at Hebrew Union College by serving as the college's first hazzan?a significant shift in performance practice.24 During services, Idelsohn would "us[e] the auth entic Jewish traditional modes, marking a radical departure from the Germanic music of classical Reform worship."25 Siskin's perception of a genuine shift in worship aesthetics, combined with an explanation of the shift that could have been supplied by Idelsohn himself, may well have inspired further openness to a potential cantorial program, a vision that would be realized by Idelsohn's successor. The vast breadth of Idelsohn's work, meanwhile, inscribed Judaism into musical discussions at a particularly salient time for Jews in the world theater. Reviews of Idelsohn's 1929 Jewish Music in Its Historical Perspective, the first book on Jewish music to be published through a major American press, lauded the author for his ability to weave a substantial Jewish thread into the mainstream discourses of Western musical history, as well as his adeptness at bringing together deeply scattered musical aspects of the Jews into a coherent, linear, and logical narrative.26 Idelsohn's work also received wide attention as a touchstone for auth enticity in public discussions and displays of Jewish sound. The Christian Science Monitor cited Idelsohn's claims that the Protestant hymn "Leoni" (The God of Abraham Praise) borrowed its melody from eighteenth-century singer Myer Leon's setting of Yigdal, and that "Nun freut euch" (Now Rejoice) served as 23. One instructor was Jacob Singer, who also lectured at the University of Nebraska (Idelsohn Collection, MUS 4, E-367); the other was A. Irma Cohon, whose book ,4? Introduction to Jewish Music in Eight Illustrated Lectures (New York: Bloch/Council for Jewish Women, 1923) is considered one of the first English-language works to address the topic. 24. The figure of the cantor or hazzan, which was largely associated with eastern European Jewish communities, had made only limited inroads into the predominantly German Jewish American Reform movement by this time, employed largely as a creative musical director and singer in a few prominent congregations (see Mark Slobin, Chosen Voices: The Story of the American Cantorate [Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2002], 45^9). Idelsohn's status as an eastern European-born cantor trained in Western musical skills and analysis methods thus allowed him to be a voice of both tradition and modernity at Hebrew Union College. 25.

Larger-scale works, such as the 1933-34 pageant "The Romance of a People," also borrowed heavily from Idelsohn's The saurus as a means of invoking Jewish musical ancientness and authenticity.28 Yet although composers, rabbis, and laypeople hailed Idelsohn's oeuvre as a central measure for determining "authentic" Jewish sound and incorporated his findings into their own projects for promoting Jewish identity and culture, little space remained for methodological dialogue or academic critique. Few, if any, mainstream music scholars had the learning or leaning to do anything but support Idelsohn's work. Subsequent attempts at scholarly writing on Jewish music by scholar-practitioners such as Lazare Saminsky and Israel Rabinovitch tended to present prescriptive ideas for energizing contemporary "Jewish music" rather than engaging in ongoing debates being held among musicolo gists.29 Jewish music study thus remained, after Idelsohn, a matter of origins, ancient survivals, self-preservation, and authenticity?politicized lines of argu ment that were particularly appropriate at a time when "Jewish" achievement faced an increasing threat at the hands of Nazi pseudoscience.30 27. Idelsohn, Jewish Music, 171, 173, 220-21; Christian Science Monitor, "Hymnal Notes: No. 281," December 9, 1932, 151 ; and Christian Science Monitor, "Hymnal Notes: No. 371," February 20, 1933, 11. At least in the case of "Leoni," Idelsohn seems to have refined knowledge already in cir culation in Jewish circles, if not elsewhere. The history of the hymn had been culled from a relatively thorough review of nineteenth-century secondary sources by Francis L. Cohen in The Jewish Encyclo pedia (see Joseph Jacobs, Goodman Lipkind, and Francis L. Cohen, "Lyon (Leoni) Myer," in Jewish Encyclopedia [New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls, 1901-6], 7:229; and Francis L. Cohen, "Yigdal," Jewish Encyclopedia, 12:607, 610), and that account was later cited in a series of popular lectures on Jewish music by A. Irma Cohon, six years before Idelsohn published his Jewish Music in its Historical Development (Cohon, An Introduction to Jewish Music, 181-82). Idelsohn, however (who cites several of the same sources but does not credit Cohen), appears to have been recognized as the person who brought this information to a broader audience. 28.

Isaac Van Grove and Meyer Weisgal's pageant "The Romance of a People," a massive work performed at the Chicago World's Fair, in New York City's Kingsbridge Armory, and in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Detroit, employed a chorus of two thousand singers and thirty-two soloists (out of up to 6,200 total players) to offer a six-episode history of the Jewish people. The pageant accompanied its earliest scenes with orchestrated melodies selected from Idelsohn's Thesaurus (Citron, "Pageantry and Theatre," chap. 2 and 3). 29.

Philip V. Bohlman notes that Idelsohn's research received a similar (though not identical) treatment in Israel; see Bohlman, "Inventing Jewish Music," in Schielfer and Seroussi, Yuval, vol. VII, 48-59. 30. Note that the field of Jewish folklore and ethnology was itself underdeveloped, particularly in the 1930s, when scholars saw ethnographic research mainly as a tool for examining "primitive" peoples. According to Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, one of the main proponents of ethnography in the United States, Franz Boas "tried to protect Jews from ethnography, because he saw cultural differ ence as a liability in the fight against anthropological theories of race" (see Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, "Imagining Europe: The Popular Arts of American Jewish Ethnography," in Divergent Jewish 36</page><page sequence="9">Whither Jewish Music While Idelsohn conducted his work in Cincinnati, similar efforts to bring music into the seminary environment had been taking place at New York's Jewish Theological Seminary, the central clergy training institution for the Conser vative movement of Judaism. According to Neil Levin, the institution had hired cantors to teach sporadic practical courses in "hazzanuth" from the late 1880s and even appeared to have graduated three students as hazzanim by the turn of the century.31 Israel Goldfarb, one of those graduates (who was later ordained as a rabbi by the seminary as well), provided consistency to the seminary's cantor ial offerings starting in 1921, when he came on to teach the seminary's hazzanut courses for rabbinic students; he continued to provide instruction for twenty one years. As opposed to Idelsohn, however, Goldfarb's experience with Jewish music was almost exclusively practical, learned primarily through study with cantorial instructors, familiarity with secondary sources, and personal melodic composition. Neither Goldfarb nor his younger brother Samuel (who laid the groundwork for similar classes at the seminary's Teacher's Institute) supplemented their work with original research.32 The Jewish Theological Seminary, meanwhile, tried unsuccessfully to collaborate with the local Cantors Ministers Association to set up cantorial training institutes in the 1920s, con tinuing a string of failed attempts by local cantorial organizations to raise the standards of knowledge and performance for the profession. Yet in all these efforts, the agenda focused on institutionalizing professional skills rather than fostering scholarly ones. The Goldfarbs made effective instructors largely because of their ability to devise and disseminate a philosophy of musical practice within the Conservative movement of Judaism, not because of their academic music credentials. Outside the seminary, meanwhile, another initiative to promote Jewish music research began under the guise of Mailamm (Makhon 'erez yisra 'eli te mada 'ei muzikah, America-Palestine Institute of Musical Sciences). Founded in 1932 by a combination of musicians and Jewish patrons of the arts, including several transplanted members of the former St. Petersburg Folklore Society, the New York-based Mailamm embraced a broad, sui generis agenda aimed at legit imizing Jewish music study and performance.33 These efforts aspired to create a scholarly, international platform for exploring Jewish music and included an unrealized attempt to raise contributions for a music department and music Cultures: Israel and America, ed. Deborah Dash Moore and S. Ilan Troen [New Haven, CT: Yale Uni versity Press, 1995], 155). Kirshenblatt-Gimblett goes on to say, however, that in the realm of cultural display, ethnography was a valuable tool for showing Jewish vibrancy (156), paralleling in some ways the artistic reaction to Idelsohn. 31.

Cohen library at the recently established Hebrew University, support for composer and Jewish music scholar Solomon Rosowsky's work on cantillation, sponsorship of Palestine's first national song competition, and the staging of numerous salon style "musicale" and concert hall music performances.34 Ultimately, however, Mailamm amounted to little more than an insiders' professional arts movement. The organization's scholars overwhelmingly identified as cantors, conductors, and composers, and their network of activity never seemed to step significantly beyond a cycle of performances, public lectures, and the creation of an expanding number of subcommittees. Mailamm thus could not organize itself to the point of gaining firm institutional commitment or academic recognition, and eventually it collapsed under its own financial burdens.35 As Mailamm tried unsuccessfully to install musicology in Palestine's Hebrew University from afar, noted musicologist Robert Lachmann made similar efforts to include Jewish music in the curriculum of the budding university from within. Ruth Katz implies that despite Lachmann 's PhD and scholarly repu tation (which included editorship of Berlin's Zeitschrift f?r vergleichende Musik wissenschaft during its brief run from 1933 to 1935), he failed in part because the university's leadership had relatively little regard for music at the time. That the music he promoted lay outside the Western canon, was collected using ethno graphic methods, and included materials from the non-Jewish communities in Palestine made his mission all the more difficult.36 Perhaps Lachmann's refusal to ally himself with the World Centre for Jewish Music in Palestine, another well-populated group of musicians that tended to base its progress on perform ances and popular publications rather than ethnographic scholarship, further isolated him.37 In the end, however, Lachmann 's best efforts led only to a well received but ultimately short-lived and underfunded Archive of Oriental Music, which eventually faded from the Hebrew University's mission. His premature death in 1939 delayed any hope of a music department at Hebrew University until the 1960s and returned the greatest potential for pursuing academic Jewish music study at the time to New York City.38 34.

German ?migr?s Hanoch Avenary and, in particular, Edith Gerson-Kiwi continued scholarly Jewish music activities throughout the 1940s and 1950s. Gerson-Kiwi, who received her doctorate from the University of Heidelberg in 1933 and subsequently worked with Lachmann in Palestine, took over Lachmann's collections and continued his work, both teaching on Jewish music and amassing additional field recordings with support from 38</page><page sequence="11">Whither Jewish Music It is thus telling that Idelsohn's successor at Hebrew Union College, Eric Werner, eventually left the college's primary campus in Cincinnati for the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion campus in New York City (formally created in 1950) in order to facilitate a more sustainable form of higher Jewish music instruction?one that embraced a wide vision of the field. Attempts to institutionalize Jewish music programs had until then been subject to a sort of double-conscious identity. Nearly all the nation's most ardent students of Jewish music had been able to sustain their interests through regular employ ment as synagogue organists, choir directors, or cantors; for them, a legitimate Jewish music studies program (often envisioned in the form of a cantorial school) would help professionalize the vocation of the Jewish synagogue musician and add weight to their self-appointed status as arbiters of musical taste in the synagogue. In the universities, meanwhile, musicologists such as German Jewish ?migr? and New York University professor Curt Sachs (and to some extent, anthropologist George Herzog) pursued a more classically oriented vision of Jewish music as an exemplar of ancient musical practices and a prede cessor to the great Western musical tradition.39 Werner, once installed in his pos ition at Hebrew Union College in 1938, aimed to straddle these two areas of discourse professionally while finding ways to bring them together as a field. Ulti mately, he would keep the center of Jewish music study within the seminary setting, emphasize a higher standard of academic research, espouse a vision of the Israeli Ministry of Education and Culture and the Hebrew University's School of Oriental Studies (see Gerson-Kiwi, "Musicology in Israel," Acta Musicologica 30, fase. 1/2 [1958]: 23; and Jehoash Hirshberg, Music in the Jewish Community of Palestine 1880-1948: A Social History [New York: Oxford University Press, 1995], 202-203). Johanna Spector also spent two years in Israel in the early 1950s on a private grant and even tually approached the American Friends of the Hebrew University with a request to start an ethnomu sicology department; according to Spector, the Friends turned her down due to more pressing needs in other areas (see Johanna Spector, transcript of oral history interview conducted by Janet S. Bookspan [New York: American Jewish Committee, Oral History Library, 1974/1977], Dorot Jewish Division, New York Public Library, 115-27). In the mid-1960s, Gerson-Kiwi brought her scholarship to Hebrew University's Jewish Music Research Centre (1964) and Tel Aviv University's new Department of Musicology (1966; established, incidentally, by Eric Werner), having successfully negotiated the decades-long institutional lacuna in Jewish music study at the university level (see Katz, Lachmann, 228, 236-37; Edwin Seroussi, "In Memoriam: Hanoch Avenary (1908-1994)," M?sica Judaica 13 [1991-92]: 93-97; and idem, "In Memoriam: Edith Gerson-Kiwi (1906-1992)," M?sica Judaica 12 [1993-94]: 75-77; for more on this period, see Amnon Shiloah and Edith Gerson-Kiwi, "Musicology in Israel, 1960-1980," Acta Musicologica 53, fase. 2 [1981]: 200-16; and Amnon Shiloah, "Music Scholarship in Israel," in The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, vol. 6, The Middle East, ed. Virginia Danielson, Scott Marcus, and Dwight Reynolds [New York: Routledge, 2002], 1057-68). Nearly all Lachmann's material, meanwhile, has survived and exists currently at the Hebrew University's Jewish Music Research Center (see Katz, Lachmann, 235-38). 39.

Cohen Jewish music as crucial to the development of Christian chant, and promote a reju venated cantorate as the new mass purveyor of Jewish music scholarship. Werner's doctorate in musicology from the University of Strasbourg and his training at the feet of such scholars as Curt Sachs, Guido Adler, and Martin Buber qualified him for broader academic acceptance in the United States.40 His faculty experience in both the Saarbr?cken Conservatory and, after the Nazis came to power, the Jewish Theological Seminary in Breslau?as well as his status as a composer?uniquely positioned him to negotiate the multifarious nature of Jewish studies in the United States. Throughout his American career, Werner thus used his post to promote Jewish music as a viable academic field while at the same time trying to show that thorough research could also ameliorate the state of American Jewish worship. Similar to Idelsohn, Werner's initial responsibilities upon arriving at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati involved teaching Jewish music courses to rabbinic students, directing the chapel choir, and working in the Birnbaum collection. Werner made it a point, however, to forge connections with other Jewish music colleagues in New York, and consequently, he maintained a presence in their emerging Jewish music collaborations. One of these initiatives, a follow-up organ ization to Mailamm called the Jewish Music Forum, would become an incubator for what was perhaps Werner's most successful project: establishing a school of sacred music. Jewish Music Forum meetings, which started in the early 1940s, aimed to give Jewish music study an air of academic legitimacy on several fronts: In addition to holding concerts and public lectures, the forum sponsored day-long symposia at which celebrated academics from outside the inner circle of Jewish music were invited to speak. In 1943, for example, Curt Sachs, George Herzog, and A. A. Roback spoke on "The Bases of Jewish Music."41 Yet the group also aimed to take steps toward institutionalizing their field. One year after the Sachs, Herzog, and Roback panel, the forum held a roundtable on "The Need for an Academy of Jewish Music."42 Werner, though not present at that meeting, took up the call. The following December, at a meeting in Cincinnati, Werner spearheaded a new organization called the Society for the Advancement of Jewish Liturgical Music?a direct offshoot of the Jewish Music Forum aimed specifically at creating an institute for the scientific study and practice of music in Jewish religious life.43 Between 1945 and 1948, Werner piloted a pan-denominational effort that would lead to such an institution, helping to give Hebrew Union College a foot hold in New York City and bringing Werner into prominence on the New York 40.

Werner's plan, in the footsteps of similar calls by Park Avenue Synagogue cantor David Putterman and Rabbi Israel Goldfarb, was to create a Jewish music institution centered around a combination of practical and academic training, and to manifest that training in a single, tradition-embodying figure: the cantor.45 By training a new generation of cantors, Werner hoped, he would create a platform for researching Judaism's ancient musical heritage while putting that research to practical use in the American synagogue. Like the unrealized blueprints for earlier American cantorial schools, Werner's involved state accreditation: Cantors would be both academic and traditional religious figures, with each side reinforcing the other. Along with cantorial training, more over, Werner envisioned a doctor of musical arts program, presumably to forge a complementary and symbiotic system of researchers and practitioners within the context of the seminary, in addition to certificate programs for honing the skills of other synagogue music specialists.46 The School of Sacred Music opened in New York on October 16, 1948, and largely conformed to Werner's plan. Yet even though it quickly gained the license to confer bachelor's degrees and within a couple of decades would be conferring the master's degree, no doctorate of any sort materialized. This lacuna created a crucial space at the top of the theoretical research agenda, leaving cantors to fill the void as America's most knowledgeable authorities in Jewish music.47 The problems with housing an academically oriented institution within a seminary environment soon became apparent. Jewish music, Werner and several in the Jewish Music Forum had reasoned, could be framed as a form of "essential" Judaism?a unified essence relatively unsullied by denominational divisions, and one with the potential to serve a project for Klal Yisrael (roughly, "the whole of Jewry"). The cantor consequently became, in their eyes, a unifying figure who, with the proper training, could restore a sense of tradition to any form 44. This process is chronicled in detail in Cohen, "Becoming a Reform Jewish Cantor," 62-117. 45. Ibid., 81-83, 90-93. 46. Ibid., 62ff. 47. One key exception to the lacuna of Jewish music doctorates is Johanna Spector, who came to study with Werner as a "visiting student" in the School of Sacred Music's opening class and sub mitted her thesis on cantillation (presumably under Werner's supervision) to the University of Cincin nati in 1950 (see Edith Gerson-Kiwi, "Musicology in Israel," 24; and Johanna Spector, "A Comparative Study of Scriptural Cantillation and Accentuation" [PhD diss., University of Cincinnati, 1950]). Spector soon became the resident ethnomusicologist at the Jewish Theological Seminary's Cantors Institute, teaching classes she defined as ethnomusicology as early as 1955 ("Survey of Courses in Ethno-Musicology and Related Subjects," Ethnomusicology 1, no. 6 [1956]: 10-11). Although recog nized as an ethnomusicologist (see, e.g., Donald M. Winkelman and Barbara Winkelman, "Ethnomu sicology in American Universities: A Curricular Survey," Ethnomusicology 1, no. 2 [1963]: 119), she seemed to gain little attention within the field of Jewish studies?perhaps because of her gender, the timing of her degree, and her tendency to study ethnic groups rather than religious traditions. Spector was able to establish a doctoral degree program through a separate "Department of Ethnomu sicology" at the Jewish Theological Seminary (Spector, transcript, 133-34; and Levin, "Music at JTS," 767); yet the degree ultimately became a track in the seminary's existing doctor of sacred music degree, carrying significance within the Jewish world but holding a somewhat lower prestige in the academic world. 41</page><page sequence="14">Judah M. Cohen of Judaism. Once Werner secured the Hebrew Union College's assurances to house the School of Sacred Music, however, other movements started to plan their own cantorial training programs. Four years after the School of Sacred Music opened, the Conservative movement's Cantors Institute started at the Jewish Theological Seminary; two years after that, in 1954, Yeshiva University established its own cantorial school to cater to the Modern Orthodox community. Werner remained the only cantorial school director with a doctorate in musicology; however, the existence of the other schools in veritable protest to Werner's project again illustrated the difficulties involved in bringing the aca demic and religious approaches to "Jewish music" together in a seminary-based program. Throughout his years establishing and directing the School of Sacred Music, Werner exhibited an awareness of scholarly efforts to establish Jewish studies as its own field, and he took steps to bring the study of Jewish music into that con versation. His entry on "Jewish music" in the 1954 Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, for example, was based on a general historical schema that traced the standard divisions of Jewish historical works (biblical, postbiblical, medieval, and modern) while providing openings for comparison with other religions.48 Werner's most widely recognized scholarly work, The Sacred Bridge (first pub lished in 1959, with a second volume appearing in 1984), employed a strategy commonly used by scholars advocating for Jewish studies by reasserting the Jewish origins of much of Christian chant.49 His further claims, presented in their most developed forms in The Sacred Bridge, that Jews and Christians bor rowed musical ideas and motifs from each other in the early Middle Ages, proved an ecumenical coup at the time, bringing him favor with the Catholic Church, which was seeking routes for reconciliation with the Jewish community after World War II.50 Though stationed until well after his retirement in an insti tution that tended to specialize in the practical application of textually focused scholarship, Werner nonetheless actively aimed to cross disciplinary borders through rigorous research and analysis. His assertion of common ground between studies of Judaism and Western civilization could be seen in his works 48. Eric Werner, "Jewish Music," 4:615-36. Such historical divisions are also apparent in Werner's introduction to his edited 1976 volume Contributions to a Historical Study of Jewish Music, though they shifted somewhat to accommodate a more detailed narrative of Jewish musical history. Such a shift seems to reflect the development of Jewish studies and Jewish musical studies as a field by this time, as well as the more focused audience of the book. The introduction's maintenance of a predominantly Jewish historical narrative as a lens for creating an overview of "Jewish music," however, remains significant. 49.

Werner's tactics quickly raised the prestige of both Jewish musical studies and the American cantorate: Recent graduates of the program gained employment in increasing numbers of Reform (and, shortly afterward, Conservative) congrega tions, helping to spread the idea of Jewish music both as an academic pursuit and as a key means for reinvigorating Jewish commitment among congregants. Werner's teachings, disseminated through cantorial graduates of the School of Sacred Music, would eventually become widely accepted?particularly the romance of the Sacred Bridge, which served as a convenient basis for ecumeni cism in many communities, not to mention a platform for interreligious con certizing.52 Cantors themselves, meanwhile, acquired cultural capital as vessels of Jewish tradition, due in large part to their curricular training and (often) signifi cant music theory and composition skills, and began to rank alongside rabbis in the Reform movement as essential members of the clergy. While Werner's ideas helped effect a shift in worship aesthetics in the Reform movement, however, they also presented a form of Judaic education that became increasingly isolated from developments in the mainstream academy. Riding the late 1960s wave of ethnic studies, as well as what Ritterband and Wechsler characterize as a narrowing of scholarly specializations in the academy,53 Jewish studies programs and departments began to expand once again?partly as a vessel for questioning religious (i.e., Christian) hegemonic dis courses, and partly as a social and religious support system for the increasing numbers of Jews seeking university degrees. Typically, these Jewish studies pro grams would initiate themselves by identifying qualified faculty already teaching in the university and then creating a new curriculum and administrative structure based on their interests. Numerous Jewish-identifying faculty taught in music departments and programs during this time; however, very few showed an interest in teaching courses in Jewish music. A survey conducted by the B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundations in 1971, for example, found only five courses related to Jewish music among the hundreds of Jewish studies offerings cataloged across the country.54 Attempts to introduce Jewish music courses by linking qualified seminary 51.

B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundations, Jewish Studies in American Colleges and Universities: A Catalog (Washington, DC: B'nai Brith Hillel Foundations, 1972). Of these five courses, only two were offered through Jewish studies programs or departments: at the University of Southern California (which actually served as a cross-listing for a course offered by the Los Angeles campus of Hebrew Union College) and at the State University of New York at Buffalo (USB274: Chassidic Music as Lit erature). Music departments sponsored the other three: at the University of Miami, Coral Gables (Music 43</page><page sequence="16">Judah M. Cohen faculty with established academic institutions, meanwhile, saw only partial success. The University of Southern California began to include in its catalog a Jewish music course sponsored by the Los Angeles campus of Hebrew Union College from at least the early 1970s (one of several courses cross-listed by the two institutions through prior agreement). But Johanna Spector's attempts in 1967 to forge an academic connection between the Jewish Theological Seminary's department of ethnomusicology and Columbia University's anthropology depart ment fell through.55 The study of Jewish music, it appears, remained largely relegated to pro fessional programs in seminary settings during this time period, for a number of reasons. The standards and methods of Jewish music research that Werner espoused had set the bar unnaturally high for young scholars, particularly those who had not been deeply ensconced in the field from childhood. Werner's approval, as the occupant of the only Jewish music professorial position in the country, proved notoriously difficult to obtain. A high level of Jewish music scho larship, additionally, was irreproduceable in his cantorial school environment, par ticularly by cantorial students for whom musical tradition needed to take a definite form. Finally, the School of Sacred Music's lack of a doctorate left it, in essence, a training institution for those who wished to gain irrefutable cantorial credentials.56 Thus, by creating a new cantorate, Werner came to experience the same issue for which he had criticized Idelsohn?namely, that none of his disciples could fill his place. Considering few people to be on a level to challenge his work, moreover, Werner's own scholarship suffered, and he occasionally even resorted to dogma, high rhetoric, misreadings of sources, and fabrication to support his increasingly rigid scholarly ideas.57 100: The Music of Hebrew Culture), at the City University of New York/Brooklyn College (Music 10.3: Jewish Folk Music), and at Hofstra University (Music 121: Jewish Music). 55. Levin, "Music," 780. 56. The one exception, Judith Kaplan Eisenstein, received her doctorate under Werner from the Hebrew Union College in 1966 (see Eisenstein, "The Liturgical Chant of Proven?al and West Sephardic Jews in Comparison to the Song of the Troubadours and to the Cantigas" [PhD diss., Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, 1966]). Eisenstein, however, had already built a considerable career as a teacher and promoter of Jewish music within Jewish communal life by the time she began her doctoral studies, particularly through her prominent roles at the Jewish Theological Semin ary's Teachers College and at the New York-based National Jewish Music Council. After receiving her degree, moreover, Eisenstein went on to teach at Hebrew Union College and the Reconstructionist Rab binical College and continued to publish and compose almost exclusively for Jewish communal audi ences (see Peter Steinfels, "Judith Eisenstein, 86, Author and Composer," New York Times, February 15, 1986). 57. See, e.g., Peter Jeffery's review essay of the second volume of Werner's The Sacred Bridge, Jewish Quarterly Review 58, no. 4 (1987): 283-98; and Jeffrey Sposato's critique of Werner's Mendels sohn scholarship, The Price of Assimilation: Felix Mendelssohn and the Nineteenth-Century Anti Semitic Tradition (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), 24-34. Both claim that Werner misread key sources that he argued supported his arguments. See also Helmut Hucke, "Toward a New Historical View of Gregorian Chant," Journal of the American Musicological Society 33, no. 3 (1980): 438 n. 7. 44</page><page sequence="17">Whither Jewish Music Not until the 1970s, when graduate students began to study Jewish music within the context of university music doctoral programs, did the nature of the field began to change. In some cases, people who are today identified as Jewish music scholars conducted their initial training in other fields, notably, Mark Slobin, whose conducted his dissertation fieldwork in Afghanistan.58 Others crossed over into Jewish studies while gaining a foothold in other subfields; Kay Shelemay, for example, identified herself with African (specifically Ethio pian) studies at least as much as Semitics and Jewish studies in the first years of her dissertation research. Scholars such as Ellen Koskoff and Philip Bohlman, meanwhile, completed their doctorates on specifically Jewish topics, though with advisors who had specialized in other fields.59 Increasingly, these stu dents' methodologies shaped a field that differed from that of Werner, marking important distinctions between seminary and university. Whereas Werner sought to separate "authentic Tradition" from "pseudo-Tradition" in Jewish music, these ethnomusicologists tended to utilize a paradigm that explored discourses and values discussed within the communities themselves, challenging imposed ideas of historical tradition and highlighting musical practices ignored or roman ticized in classic historical Jewish music trajectories. Several, as a result, ended up finding allies among Israeli musicologists?whose national program focused on investigations of its "ethnic" Jewish communities?more so than among Ameri can seminary programs. It is only the generation of scholars that emerged in the 1970s who, in the United States, have trained within a secular university setting and worked with advisors who could themselves claim both credentials in ethnomusicology and specialization in Jewish music. Involved in a university-based dialogue about the methods and means of studying music in Jewish life, these scholars began to take on the mantles of their university-based mentors, learning how to mediate mainstream discourses of knowledge with the parallel musical world of cantors and lay scholars that Eric Werner helped create. The results of such efforts led to a change in the landscape of Jewish music research: scholars such as Kay Kaufman Shelemay, Mark Slobin, Ellen Koskoff, and Philip Bohlman came to Jewish music topics that fit their own research interests independently from semin ary agendas; they secured jobs in music departments; they all situated themselves centrally in the field of ethnomusicology, with each serving as president of the 58. Mark Slobin, Music in the Culture of Northern Afghanistan (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1976). 59. Parallel developments took place in other emerging realms of Jewish studies. Among other social sciences, for example, a move toward studying one's "own" culture began to take shape in the mid- to late 1970s, around the same time that Jewish studies programs began to proliferate in earnest (see, e.g., Victor Turner, foreword to Number Our Days: Culture and Community among Elderly Jews in an American Ghetto, by Barbara My erhoff [New York: E. P. Dutton, 1979], ix-xiii). Anthropologist Barbara Myerhoff, for example, began as a scholar of Native American communities before researching and writing Number Our Days (see Myerhoff, Peyote Hunt: The Sacred Journey of the Huichol Indians [Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1974]). Likewise, scholars of Jewish folklore such as Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett pursued Jewish topics with mentors who did not themselves specialize in Jewish realms. 45</page><page sequence="18">Judah M. Cohen Society for Ethnomusicology; and they advised their own students in a broad range of dissertation topics, Jewish and (mostly) otherwise. Consequently, in 1994, Hebrew Union College hired New York University-trained ethnomusicologist Mark Kligman, a student of Kay Shelemay, to fill the post formerly occupied by Eric Werner. The recent Oxford Handbook of Jewish Studies included a chapter on music by Philip Bohlman.60 And scholars who study music in Jewish life have increasingly become central to ethnomusicology and visible within Jewish studies.61 As figures associated with a still-forming subfield approximating "Jewish culture and the arts," they continue to keep the broader academic fields in sight while remaining in dialogue with seminary-produced religious musical figures and other Jewish music professionals. Perhaps, in this way, music study will eventually thrive in both the university and the seminary, with each pursuing its own ends while maintaining a mutually beneficial dialogue. *** The field of Jewish music continues to hold an ambivalent position on the borders of musicology, ethnomusicology, and Jewish studies. The topic continues to be relatively peripheral to Jewish studies programs (even with the recent rising interest in "Jewish culture and the arts") and rarely corresponds to the "world areas" desired by universities that hire ethnomusicologists. Yet as I have suggested in this essay, the reason this situation exists may be attributable, in part, to the par ticular choices that early Jewish music scholars made upon their arrival in the United States, the resources available to them to continue their studies, and the insti tutional spaces they had the opportunities to fill. Several factors helped to shape the trajectory of Jewish music research throughout the twentieth century: the self imposed mission of the major figures of Jewish musicology to improve the state of American Judaism through music scholarship; the administrative housing of Jewish music studies and programs in seminaries; the largely peripheral status of Jewish music to central concerns of American musicology; the eventual trans mission of Jewish musical knowledge through an academicized cantorate; and the resulting lack of Jewish music PhD students until the 1970s?and even then from different, often nonliturgical backgrounds. When university-based Jewish studies programs began to emerge in earnest in the 1960s and assembled their inter disciplinary array of professors, few scholars had arrived in the music departments to add their voices to the discipline. Likewise, ethnomusicology's postwar "rebirth," as chronicled by Philip Bohlman,62 received acknowledgment by Eric Werner but seemed to have little effect on his Jewish music agenda at Hebrew Union College. 60. Bohlman, "Music." The placement of Bohlman's essay toward the back of the volume? between essays on art and theater?still speaks to the peripheral nature music (and, more generally, the arts and social sciences) holds within Jewish studies. 61. Kay Shelemay, for example, was recently elected to the American Academy for Jewish Research, and Philip Bohlman has served as the chair of the University of Chicago's Jewish studies program. 62. Bohlman, "Ethnomusicology's Challenge to the Canon." 46</page><page sequence="19">Whither Jewish Music There is obviously much more to do in pursuit of understanding the dynamics of Jewish music study, in routes that range well beyond the duality of the seminary and the university. Where, for example, do the numerous influential composers of music associated with Judaism figure into this schema, and what is their role in the maintenance or reconsideration of Jewish tradition in music? particularly in terms of their affiliation with both seminary and university music programs? How did the financial infrastructure of the concert hall, the Broadway theater, and the synagogue lead many to expect those studying Jewish music to confirm identities in their work rather than challenge them? How did American trained, Israel-bound musicologists in the 1960s and 1970s (such as Alexander Ringer and Eliyahu Schleifer) relate to Werner and other American Jewish music scholars?63 And how do several prominent female Jewish music scholars from the mid-twentieth century figure into this narrative?particularly Johanna Spector, Judith Kaplan Eisenstein, Irene Heskes, and Tsiporah Jochsberger, all of whom had a considerable impact on American Jewish music scholarship and practice yet struggled to receive adequate recognition within the male-dominated academic Jewish studies scene?64 Addressing these questions and others will add further nuance to a complicated and important story detailing the relationship between American Jews, music, and the academy. Also crucial to this discussion is the question of how the state of Jewish music study, and its multisited nature within religious and intellectual institutional life, has served to provide explicit or implicit answers about what Jewish music is to a population that is constantly seeking ideological self-assurance. In addition to addressing intellectual discourses, music researchers at both the seminary and the university continue to wield enormous (if occasionally unintentional) influence on practical matters of Jewish sonic identification; their combinations of social, intel lectual, and spiritual authority, often through publications, continue to serve as imprimaturs for many aspiring artists and religious practitioners (just as they did in the past).65 For researchers such as Idelsohn, Werner, and others, this kind of schema played an important role in the Jewish music agenda: Their 63. Schleifer, for example, earned his PhD from the University of Chicago in 1979 with a dis sertation on a colonial Mexican manuscript and went on to advise graduate students at the Hebrew Uni versity, in addition to creating and directing the year-in-Jerusalem program for first-year Hebrew Union College cantorial students from the United States. 64. Spector, Eisenstein, and Jochsberger, notably, completed their doctorates in 1950, 1966, and 1972, respectively (see Marsha Bryan Edelman, "Jochsberger, Tziporah H. (b. 1920)," in Jewish Women in America: An Historical Encyclopedia, ed. Paula Hyman and Deborah Dash Moore [New York: Routledge, 1997], 1:701-702; and idem, "Spector, Johanna (b. 1915)," in Hyman and Moore, Jewish Women in America, 2:1297). Heskes pursued doctoral studies under Eric Werner but did not complete them (see Eliott Kahn, "Biographical Note," in the online description of the Irene Heskes Collection at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, http://www.jtsa.edu/prebuilt/ archives/music/heskes.shtml#bs). 65. Consider, for example, the Milken Archive of American Jewish Music (http://www.milkenarchive.org), a massive archiving and recording project founded in Los Angeles in 1990. Since 2003, the archive has published dozens of compact discs and sponsored a major Jewish music conference under the artistic directorship of Neil Levin (assistant professor of music at 47</page><page sequence="20">Judah M.
