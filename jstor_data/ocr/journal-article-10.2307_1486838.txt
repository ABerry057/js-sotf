<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stefan C. Reif. Judaism and Hebrew Prayer: New Perspectives on Jewish Liturgical History3 Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993. 437 pp. Stefan Reif's Judaism and Hebrew Prayer deserves attention, especially as encyclopedic books on Jewish liturgy are rare, and because this one comes from the pen of a scholar who directs the Taylor-Schechter Genizah Research Unit at Cambridge. It recapitulates essays published elsewhere, constituting Reif's retrospective statement on the shape of liturgical research. Against the backdrop of a decade in which the textual paradigm of liturgical research has had little new to say, Reif begins by asking what the nature of such study should be (chap. 1). Assuming that it should be textual and historical, he considers the extent to which biblical Judaism is liturgical in the sense that rabbinic Judaism is (chap. 2); how synagogue liturgy evolved from a relatively unstructured tannaitic oral amalgam into a fixed geonic prayer book (chaps. 3-5); how a geonic text evolved subsequently into medieval rites (chap. 6) and then into a printed siddur (chap. 7); and how that</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 425 siddur fared in modern times (chap. 8), especially with the rise of movement identities (chap. 9). Reif's account is implicitly teleological, since it takes as its norm what came to be known as the "traditional siddur"; it explicitly prejudices Orthodox versions of that work, declaring them to be its proper "historical continuation" (p. 295). But unlike most accounts, this one does not prejudice antiquity at the expense of anything post-geonic. As Reif tells it, biblical Jews were not liturgical, though postexilic leaders did experiment with public ceremonial and a theology of divine inscrutability and human sinfulness that would occupy the rabbis later. When the cult ended, rabbis debated the relative priority of prayer, Torah, and ma 'asim tovinm as the new essence of Judaism. Torah study and its attendant ma'aim tn ovim won (p. 67), though geonic literature valuing prayer overlooks the talmudic preference for Torah and good works as the real rabbinic leitourgia. Since Joseph Heinemann, almost all scholars have conceptualized tan- naitic liturgy as oral, implying the coexistence of many parallel but different ad hoc prayer "scripts" intended for oral performances that had no necessary continuity beyond a single performative instance. Movement was not (as earlier philologists imagined) from a simple and original canonical Urtext to a multiplicity of rites all more or less outgrowths of the purer original, but the other way around: from a cultural system that encouraged alternative liturgical performances to one that preferred textual fixity. Reif must be read as a polemic supporting Heinemann against Ezra Fleischer (see especially pp. 119-121), who recently revived the pre-Heinemann theory of a tannaitic fixed liturgy, dating it, however, only after 70 C.E.1 Reif is already on record in deferential opposition to Fleischer on both counts: the liturgy was oral, he holds, but even in its orality, it was at least influenced by postexilic biblical models.2 But why would a tradition without a fixed text opt for a prayer book in the geonic era? Reif responds (in part) by emphasizing the newly available codex, which he traces to ninth-century Babylonia (p. 148), precisely the time of Seder Rav Amranm. In perhaps his strongest chapter, Reif then traces the Amram corpus through Europe, updating Zunz's pioneer work on ritual development by surveying most medieval prayer corpora to posit literary lines of development. Arriving ultimately at seventeenth-century Poland, he 2. Tarbiz 59 (1990): 397-445. 2.

Liturgy now becomes the study of that book: how enlightened maskilim "correct" its grammar, while reformers alter its theology. This sweeping account is not easily followed. As a collection of essays that appeared elsewhere originally, the book suffers from redundancy (e.g., pp. 122-132, which were necessary in the original, but are repetitive here). Moreover, the style is dense, since the author favors lengthy sentences that qualify and overqualify each claim, and elephantine paragraphs running two to three pages in length (e.g., pp. 309-313). But density arises also because Reif eschews the specificity of normal historical explanation. Typical is his treatment of the geonic curtailment of creativity, which he attributes to "crests and troughs ... periods of innovation ... followed by years of conservative retrenchment" (p. 147). Though true enough, this begs the question of just why retrenchment occurred when and where it did, why in Babylonia not Palestine, for instance, and why by geonim only in the ninth century, especially since (by Reif's own admission) the bound codex was used "a few centuries earlier" (p. 148) by Christian communities, so that the technological cause he favors cannot be held fully accountable. The point is not simply that Reif and I have a long-standing disagreement on whether we should explain the "crests and troughs" of liturgical creativity or fixity in political terms, associating fixity (as I do) with cultural systems such as the Babylonian, where successful canonization of authority permits control of religious expression.3 It is that Reif prefers not only recourse to technological capacity (the codex, the printing press) but more significantly, something akin to Aristotle's material cause, in this case the internal dynamic of the halakhah (see p. 366, n. 29)4 with its "natural" (!) ebb and flow, not necessarily linked to empirically demonstrable events external to itself. Such claims are not easily captured in a narrative designed for readers seeking historical specificity. This thus turns out to be a lengthy book, filled with extensive discussion; but the argument is often frustratingly general in nature. Still, Judaism and Hebrew Prayer recapitulates one very fine scholar's 3. See my Canonization of the Synagogue Service (Notre Dame, Ind., 1979). 4.

It deserves careful reading both by those within the textual paradigm who want to know the state of the question, and by those (like myself) who treat liturgy as a key to culture, but who must still grapple with textual data, even as those data are reformulated for other than textual ends. For Reif, and against my own view,5 liturgy is thus still a text, not (for example) a ritual script or a symbolic encoding of the worshippers' universe. Its rites vary according to textual selectivity, not sociological self-perception. And of all available versions, one is most authentic, namely, the Hebrew text patterned after the Babli, Rav Amram, and then the rishonim and acharonim of Europe, who ultimately codified its wording as halakhically proper. I do not subscribe to any of these a priori definitions, but I do recommend Reif's treatment as a cogent and serious presentation of his position, a reliable and well-documented work by a man who has read both secondary sources and primary texts, and who weaves them together in a thoughtful and responsible way.
