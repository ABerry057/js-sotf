Zipperstein "The near-mythic heder, the shtetl, the Holocaust, the extent of Jewish learning in Eastern Europe-these elements, bordering on the sacrosanct in recent Jewish memory, are the focus of this remarkably insightful work by Steven J. Zipperstein, who, using newly discovered archives, takes us, with stylistic clarity and scholarly self- control, into a startlingly new and challenging landscape of Jewish history and history writing."-Chaim Potok The Samuel and Althea Stroum Lectures in Jewish Studies Clothbound, $30.00 Paperback, $14.95 Along the Edge of Annihilation The Collapse and Recovery of Life in the Holocaust Diary David Patterson "Patterson helps us to understand the various factors that motivated individuals to take up their pens even at the risk of their lives. One not only gets a profound sense of what Jewish victims experienced in their souls but at the same time one learns a great deal about Judaism and the Holocaust from an author who is imbued with a lofty sense of the moral, ethical, and spiritual grandeur of the Jewish faith." -Milton Teichman, Marist College A Samuel and Althea Stroum Book Clothbound, $35.00 Paperback, $19.95 Available from your bookstore or call 1-800-441-4115 UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON PRESS P.O.
