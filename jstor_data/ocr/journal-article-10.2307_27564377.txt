New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006. xii, 414 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001347 This is an ambitious and wide-ranging book, described by its author as a "linear history of [Jewish] martyrdom that stretches from the Hellenistic period to the dawn of the modern era" (1). It offers a detailed examination of episodes of Jewish martyrdom from late antiquity to the Black Death, drawing on a wealth of secondary sources and citing generously from primary sources. For the nonspecialist in search of a survey of Jewish martyrdom in the premodern period, there is no other such work. For scholars, the book highlights some import ant issues that need to be addressed further, among them the following: What can we know about the origins, functions, and meanings of martyrdom traditions in different Jewish cultural orbits? What conclusions can we legitimately draw about Jewish attraction to, discomfort with, or ambivalence about martyrdom, in any given milieu? And, given the nature of the sources, how can we responsibly analyze shifts in Jewish attitudes and commitments over time and space? While Shepkaru has devoted a great deal of thought to these issues, his book, which grew out of a dissertation, is better at raising questions than at offer ing persuasive conclusions. To write a book on Jewish martyrdom, to begin with, one needs some sort of working definition. Is "martyrdom" going to be regarded as a single root behavior or as a changing cluster of behaviors and ideas that at some point acquires the name kiddush ha-shem? Overall, Shepkaru seems unsure. Initially he proposes the former. He points to "the fundamental martyrological characteristic of consciously choosing death over life in the presence of oppres sors" (12). The subjects of his study, he declares, are Jews who have died a "volun tary death," whether they have allowed others to kill them or have killed themselves (5). But the reader is periodically unnerved by a change in course. Shepkaru disqualifies the refugees in 1 Maccabees, who were killed after they refused, in their own words, to "obey the command of the king to profane the Sabbath day" (1 Maccabees 2:34), not because they do not fit his initial definition (they do) but because the author of the story did not intend the story to be "a posi tive paradigm" (17)?a new requirement that at least deserves explanation. Else where, he relaxes his definition so as to include Jews who were involuntary victims of pogroms because the term kiddush ha-shem had been relaxed by con temporaries in that way. The final chapter is a very brief discussion of various meanings that the term kiddush ha-shem has assumed over the last five centuries, some of which have nothing to do with death at all, much less voluntary death. Unfortunately, the lack of clarity about what the book is about reflects a more far-reaching lack of clarity about aims and methods. What, the reader may ask, does "linear history" mean? The author explains that he is reading his sources to reflect Jewish life at the time of their composition, not at the time of the events they purport to describe. But it is not clear how this distinguishes him from any other scholar working with old texts. The problem is not one of acknowledging the need to place texts in their proper context; it is one of correctly determining what that context is, that is, of arriving at the approximate 430</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews date of their composition?which is the technical issue at stake in his discussion of antiquity. (I am not qualified to comment on Shepkaru's dating of Chapters 6 and 7 of 2 Maccabees, which is key to his argument.) What Shepkaru actually proposes is certainly not a linear narrative. It is a study of how intercultural dynamics (primarily Jewish-Christian) have shaped Jewish conceptions of martyrdom over time. He cites two books as being influen tial in the development of his approach: Ivan Marcus's Rituals of Childhood (1996) and Daniel Boyarin's Dying for God (1999). But it is hard to see how his conceptualization of Jewish-Christian interactions is indebted to either Marcus or Boyar?n. Shepkaru's discussions tend to imply a simple Jewish rejec tion or imitation of Christian ideals and do not venture very far into the more complex mechanisms that mediate intercultural exchange. This is crucial. If the author's intention is to write a study of the intercultural dynamics that shaped Jewish martyrdom, we would expect the analysis of those dynamics to provide the sinews and connective tissue of the book. Yet much of the book reads like a loosely reasoned commentary on a series of texts, from which Shepkaru draws the following conclusions: (1) that Jews were not attracted to martyrdom, as many scholars have believed, prior to the Roman period; (2) that Jewish enthusiasm spiked under Roman rule in the first century but that rabbinic authorities soon acted to check it as it became associated with Christian behavior; (3) that Jewish ardor for martyrdom flourished in the medieval period in response to Christian persecution; and (4) that the Holocaust has brought about a fundamen tal shift away from the idealization of self-sacrificial death. To his credit, Shepkaru has read broadly in the secondary literature, and he has looked at a great many sources (though some only in translation). The breadth of his vision is refreshing. Chapters 4 and 5, dealing with Byzantine Italy and early eleventh-century France, respectively, deal with relatively unknown territory. But the book falls short of meeting the demands that such an encompassing topic poses. Not only does it lack a solid methodological underpinning, it also betrays difficulties in the mastery of evidence. The glaring omission of events in Spain and Portugal between 1391 and 1492 is a case in point. The six pages (and pertinent bibliography) that deal with the early modern and modern period reveal the author's lack of familiarity with much of the rich and relevant scholar ship for those centuries?which would make evident that Jewish criticism of the martyrdom ideal predates the Holocaust by at least half a century. Finally, even in its details, the book seems to elude the author's control. There are many typogra phical and other editing errors. Put briefly, this book does not achieve what it aims for, and it might have contributed more had it aimed for less. Miriam Bodian Touro College New York, New York 431</page></plain_text>
