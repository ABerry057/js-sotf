New York: New York University Press, 1994. xvi, 142 pp. Until the fall of communism and the dismemberment of the U.S.S.R., scholars studying contemporary Soviet-Jewish life were methodologically constrained. They could read the public press judiciously or examine statistical reports, including population studies, rigorously and creatively; and starting in the middle of the 1960s, they could contact activists directly within the country or even debrief emigres in order to develop analyses and characterizations of the community. However, now that direct access to the population of the former Soviet Union is available, the idea of an in situ ethnographic survey of Jewish life is not only a possibility, it is a reality. Working with a team of local social scientists, Robert Brym, a sociologist with extensive experience in the study of Soviet Jewry, developed a research questionnaire with over 150 items which he used to interview 1,000 Jews between February and April of 1993 in Moscow, Kiev, and Minsk. Because these cities are the principal centers of the three Slavic republics of the newly formed Commonwealth of Independent States, representing the heartland of the Jewish population in the former Soviet Union, they give the researcher the fullest spectrum on contemporary Jewish life. Together with information culled from some of his own earlier studies as well as data developed by others, Brym used the results of his survey to develop a profile of the whole of the Jewish population of the C.I.S. Accordingly, the picture offered here is more than a snapshot of contemporary Jewry in these three cities. Indeed the analysis even includes the author's projections on the continued evolution of the Jewish community through the balance of the decade. Brym explores three distinct and closely related topics. First, he establishes the size of the Jewish population by calculating not only the number of passport-holding Jews, but also those who have or had one Jewish parent and are not at present registered as Jews. Since the system of official identification based on passports permits individuals of mixed parentage to claim the national identity of either parent, Brym rightfully justifies including these potential Jews in his count. Second, he discusses how Jews in the three cities perceive contemporary manifestations of antisemitism, and, in turn, he correlates this new information with what we already know about local attitudes to Jews and their general status within the society. Brym reasons, correctly, that perceptions or manifestations of antisemitism will play a crucial role in each individual's choice of identity as well as future</page><page sequence="2">210 BOOK REVIEWS actions and associations. Finally, Brym offers an extensive commentary on the emigration movement since the middle of the 1960s, including his own observations as to how it will evolve in the coming years. Brym's findings, summarized at the end of the study, are sober and well founded. He did not find a basis for the renewal of a creative Jewish culture among his informants and so was not optimistic about the prospects of a Jewish revival in the C.I.S. in the near future. Instead, he expects to see just under half a million Jews leaving the region in the next five years, with fewer than half of them going to Israel. Thus, Brym concludes that by the end of the twentieth century, a community that 100 years ago numbered well over five million persons and was home to the most vibrant expressions of Jewish life and thought in the world at that time will be made up of approximately half a million aged and fully acculturated Jews for whom Jewish life, identity, and culture will have very little interest. These judgments are fully consistent with the evidence gathered here. Brym has made a significant contribution to the manner in which we study the contemporary life of those we once called Soviet Jews. Because he focused on a broad, randomly selected cross-section of the Jewish population and not just on the elite and its particular views, Brym has offered us a wider and more nuanced picture of this community than has been shown before. Now, with opportunities to continue on this path, others will develop and apply a variety of new instruments to the task in order to continue probing the character of this highly significant Jewish community. These exercises will no doubt elicit a variety of responses which will reflect different moments in the life of that people. Thus, while Brym's conclusions and projections may be open to review, his approach and his efforts are to be acknowledged and commended for the contribution they make to the study of Jews and Jewish life in the former Soviet Union.
