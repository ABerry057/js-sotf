<plain_text><page sequence="1">Herbert A. Davidson. Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on Intellect: Their Cosmologies, Theories of the Active Intellect, and Theories of Human Intel- lect. New York: Oxford University Press, 1992. iii, 363 pp. Alfarabi (d. 950), Avicenna (Ibn Sina, 980-1037), and Averroes (Ibn Rushd, 1126-1198) were the three most thoroughly studied Muslim philoso- phers in the Jewish encounter with Greek philosophy between the twelfth and the sixteenth centuries. Two of the most pivotal issues within this encounter were theories regarding cosmology and intellect. Jewish philosophers debated these theories because they were fascinated by rationality. Pre-Newtonians and pre-Freudians, they were anxious to correlate or identify human minds with the spiritual forces responsible for structural order in the universe, thereby explaining how mortal human intelligence is capable of discovering absolute truths. Disputing the mysteries of reason, the philosophers clashed over the definition of human identity. They offered competing explanations for the psychological experience of imagination and dreams; they diverged in their opinions regarding prophecy; and, they battled over Judaism's promise of personal immortality. These medieval philosophic debates were further complicated by profound disagreements over the proper meaning of Aristo- tle's most obscure and incomplete statements. Herbert A. Davidson's latest monograph, therefore, deals with the most influential figures and the most fundamental topics in what is undeniably the very heartland of medieval Jewish philosophy. Chapters 3 and 4 sort out and elucidate the various texts written by</page><page sequence="2">258 BOOK REVIEWS Alfarabi and Avicenna related to the topics of cosmic emanation, human intellect, prophecy, and immortality. A major section of chapter 5 itemizes the "reverberations" of their ideas on Judah Hallevi, Abraham Ibn Daud, Maimonides, and a host of other medieval Jewish Aristotelians and anti- Aristotelians. Chapters 6 through 8, slightly less than one-half of the entire monograph, sort out and elucidate all of the texts written by Averroes related to his particularly influential notions of cosmic order and intellection. Chapter 7 contains a review of the impact of these Averroan ideas on Jewish thought. Even those sections of the book not directly concerned with "reverberations" impinge on the history of Jewish culture, insofar as most of the original Arabic texts were translated into Hebrew and several of the most important Islamic texts, especially those of Averroes, are extant only in Hebrew. Integrating the study of Jewish philosophy with Islamic philosophy con- stitutes one of the major principles in Davidson's methodology. He formulated this principle explicitly in his earlier and closely related monograph, Proofs for Eternity, Creation and the Existence of God in Medieval Islamic Jewish Philosophy (New York, 1987): "Jewish philosophy is rooted in Islamic philosophy and cannot be properly understood in isolation from it. The reverse is of course not true. . . . Yet when viewed historically, Jewish philosophy does shed light on medieval Islamic philosophy in a number of areas. ... Many of Averroes' writings are preserved exclusively in Hebrew, and Hebrew commentaries furnish the best, and often the sole, access to the meaning of even those preserved on Arabic" (p. 6). Davidson's interests go beyond the interaction of Islamic and Jewish philosophies. Major sections of chapters 5 and 7 in the monograph under review are devoted to tracing the "reverberations" of Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes in Islamic and Christian scholastic thought, e.g., Ibn Bajja, Ghazali, Suhrawardi, and Aquinas. This methodological commitment to cross-cultural, comparative scholarship accords with the principle articulated in his Proofs for Eternity: "Treating the several branches of medieval philosophy-Islamic, Jewish, and Christian-in conjunction with one another is surely justified considering the extent to which they draw sustenance from the same, or similar, sources and are animated by the same spirit" (Proofs for Eternity, p. 6, and the reference there to H. A. Wolfson's statement that "medieval philosophy ... is thus the common philosophy of three religions-Judaism,</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 259 Christianity and Islam--consisting of one philosophy written in five lan- guages--Greek, Latin, Syriac, Arabic and Hebrew"'). Davidson's method for doing the history of philosophy is thereby distinguished from parochial or limited histories written without his expertise in all of the relevant languages and literatures. Chapter 2 proves that Davidson's expertise includes the "discussions of intellect in late Greek and early Arabic philosophy" (p. 5) which served as the background to Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes. Behind the Greek commentators stands Aristotle himself. Characteristically, Davidson opens and closes the monograph with explicit references to Aristotle's De Anima. Throughout, he seems intent on determining whether the medieval philoso- phers got their Aristotle right. Some of the most erudite and useful passages in the monograph are those in which Davidson accounts for the lapses made by medieval philosophers and commentators when they reached "wholly un-Aristotelian" conclusions (p. 346). Starting with Aristotle and tracking his interpreters cross-culturally is another of the fundamental principles in Davidson's methodology. I refer once again to his Proofs of Eternity, where he explicitly described a discipline called the "history of philosophic ideas" which attempts "to trace the history of philosophic constructions rather than reproduce the complete system of any individual philosopher or philosophic school [and whose] concern is chiefly with the history of proofs ... [and] the history of the components from which the proofs are fashioned. The starting point . . . is, with rare exceptions, Aristotle ... [as] often determined by the late Greek philosophers" (Proofs of Eternity, p. 7). This method is well-founded and problematic. Some intellectual historians are less certain of being able to discern authorial intention, other insist on correlating philosophers with their social context. Many seek to demystify philosophy by reducing it to ideologically inspired propaganda on behalf of class interests and ruling elites. Historians critical of Arthur A. Lovejoy's artificially detached "unit-ideas"2 might object to Davidson's "components."3 It would be important to know how Davidson might defend his claim on behalf of medieval philosophy's "same spirit" against the "sociology of philosophy" 1.

Thanks to Davidson's embattled "history of philosophic ideas" and his uncanny knack for sorting out textual and conceptual confusions, the original meaning and subsequent interpretations of Aristotelian cosmology and intellect are no longer so hazy and intimidatingly enigmatic. Finally, in learning from Davidson's meticulous comparison of the reception of Aristotle in three distinct medieval settings, and in profiting from his discussion of the debt owed by Christian and Jewish philosophy (or philosophies) to Islamic culture, historians ought not to miss the opportunity to reconsider their most fundamental presuppositions.
