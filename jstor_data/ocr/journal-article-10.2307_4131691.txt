Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 2004. 351 pp. Our knowledge of German Jewish interwar migration has benefited from intensive research efforts, both contemporary and retrospective, driven largely by the deep impact that the unique circumstances of the refugee movement, a result of the Nazis' rise to power in Germany, had on contemporaries and histor- ians. This movement involved the mass migration of people who had not long before enjoyed prosperity and had been well integrated into the general society. 479</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews They were abruptly pushed out to face the rigid immigration policies of potential destination countries, mostly affected by the economic depression. This refugee movement attracted attention because of its unique composition of human capital, professionally and culturally, including leading figures in the world of arts and sciences. It was the cultural aspect-the transfer of the centers of modem arts and sciences from Berlin and Vienna to New York, Los Angeles, and London-that attracted contemporary attention and shaped its study onward. The uniqueness of this migration was viewed differently in the Yishuv (the Jewish community in Mandatory Palestine), a developing community for which it was a great economic asset and yet an unprecedented challenge-culturally, econ- omically, and socially. Therefore, this wave, which constituted only about 20 percent of the fifth wave of immigration to Palestine during 1933-39 (50,000, including immigrants from Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia), attracted much attention at the time and thereafter. Indeed, among the groups of Olim who immigrated to Mandatory Palestine, the German group was far more studied than the much larger eastern European groups of immigrants.' The main trigger for this attention was the apparent gap between their contribution to the economic and cultural development of the Jewish community in Palestine on one hand and their difficulties in integrating socially and politically on the other, keeping a clear distance between themselves and others through mutual resentment and even antagonism between the Yekkes and the dominating Ostjuden. Guy Miron's fascinating book, which is based on his doctoral dissertation at Hebrew University, fits in with this trend, yet his frame of reference is not the study of migration and absorption. Rather, his aim is to see the immigrants as an "interpretive community" whose members intensively dealt with their individ- ual and collective past experiences to shape their legacy for future generations to come (297), and to explore the impact of the crisis caused by the Nazi seizure of power on the perception of German Jewish history as reflected by the emigrants' own retrospectives on their experiences before and after the rupture. In his research, Miron benefits from two advantages: the availability of numerous studies concerning the German Jewish historical retrospective before Hitler's era and the initiative of immigrating German Jews-both individually and institutionally-to produce a vast amount of autobiographies and memoirs, both published and unpublished. The German Jewish migration experience has been studied intensively, focusing on cultural transfer and analyzing mainly an elite group of intellectuals, artists, and scientists by making use of writings about their experiences as exiles. Miron is innovative in that he does not dwell exclusively on published materials and the elite's expressions but instead draws a wider and more complex picture. 1.

The main sample represents a diversity of types: people who came from big cities or small villages, those who immigrated in the late 1930s as opposed to early immigrants, young and older immigrants, those who wrote about their experiences early and those who wrote later in life, men and women, religious and nonreligious, and longtime Zionists, "new Zio- nists" (those who became Zionists following the rise of Hitler), and non-Zionists. The selection of types serves the purpose to investigate whether and to what extent one can identify a common denominator in the collective posttraumatic memory against the former postemancipation memory of the Jewish fate in Germany, and to what extent one can find archetypes of that memory in the differ- ent individual experiences, in Germany and afterward. Miron makes use of methodologies that are common in the disciplines of psychology and literature and divides his study into two kinds of analyses. First, he deals separately with the two main issues in the memoirs-reconstruction of the German experience (Chap. 2) and the Palestine-Israel experience (Chap. 3). Then he deals with the different types of narration: the narrative concerning the "lost world" (Chap. 4) and the type relating to the "new world or our haven" (Chap. 5). Chapters 6-8 deal with other criteria for typifying the diverse narra- tives: central themes of emphasis such as the role of vocation, gender, or religion; the extent of cohesion in the narratives; and the relation to and use of cultural symbols (books, music, etc.). Not surprisingly, Miron concludes that the trauma caused by the Nazi regime led to a profound change in the German Jewish interpretation of the past. The sense of continuity, progress, and optimism that dominated the poste- mancipation narratives is replaced by agony, despair, and sometimes ironic self-criticism. The crisis shed a new light on the past, and even in the most nostal- gic memoirs of the lost German paradise, there are stories about antisemitism and warning signals of what was to come. However, on this common shift from optimistic to pessimistic perception, one may find a variety of differences. For example, those who came to Palestine before the Nazi era or out of Zionist motivation focus more on the Israeli chapter of their lives and tend to dwell on shady aspects of their German experience. Many writers invented strategies aiming at creating new meaning or connecting a line between their past and present despite the crisis. For example, religion serves as bonding link that gives a positive meaning of fulfillment to the 'aliyah. This is also true for vocation as a link and a sense of fulfillment. Moreover, Miron finds a clear difference between those who immigrated late in life, as well as those who wrote their memoirs right after immigration, who clung to their experi- ences in Germany, and younger immigrants, as well as those who sat down to write their memoirs after decades of living in their new homeland, who focused on their Israeli experience and drew their German past as leading to an Israeli future. One case is especially interesting, that of Shimon Sacks (the spelling is not clear because it appears only in Hebrew), who came to Palestine as an adolescent in 481</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 1939 and wrote his memoirs twice, in 1964 and in 1984. Miron's comparison exemplifies the differences between two memoirs written by the same person, demonstrating how much the memories were affected by time and circumstances from which the past is perceived. Surprisingly, Miron does not take issue with the language in which the memoirs were written. Most autobiographies in the main sample analyzed were written in German. The most extreme example is Gerschom Scholem, who wrote first in German and only later translated his memoir into Hebrew. Yet Miron includes in his list of sources only the Hebrew translations. Taking the impact of the present experience as shaping the picture of the past, one wonders why Miron does not deal with the impact of different social and economic backgrounds or patterns of economic or social integration despite the availability of a diversity of types in his sample. For that matter, the appendix of about fifty short biographies is rather short and only mirrors the very basic facts. True, Miron emphasizes more than once that he does not aim to demonstrate the relevance of the individual subjective memory to the objective and real or factual experience but rather to analyze the perception of that experience. Nevertheless, as much as the affinity to religion or to Zionism, the timing or age of immigration, the general Israeli atmosphere-all dealt with as relevant factors in shaping memory-Miron also should have dealt with factors that shaped the process of immigration and absorption and influenced the perception of the past. Students of immigration may now go one step further, adapting Miron's methodology in order to define and measure the success or failure of immigration, be it among German Jewish or other migrating groups. Miron has thus paved a new path for migration studies at large. Hagit Lavsky Hebrew University Jerusalem, Israel</page></plain_text>
