Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1995. xiii, 197 pp. Paula E. Hyman is one of the foremost experts on Jewish assimilation and Jewish identity in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Western Europe and America. Her books on French Jewry have become classic studies of the ways that Jews coped with the challenges of emancipation and modernity. Hyman has also been a leading historian of Jewish women, writing specifically on female experience and interweaving that experience into the social history of</page><page sequence="2">270 BOOK REVIEWS Jews generally. Her latest book, Gender and Assimilation in Modern Jewish History, the Stroum Lectures delivered at the University of Washington in 1992, analyzes the gendered nature of Jewish assimilation in Western and Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and America in the century between 1850 and 1950. Hyman's new book makes it abundantly clear that all Jewish historians must take gender into account in their work. Drawing on the work of other historians of Jewish women, and using a wide array of previously unexplored sources in Yiddish, Hebrew, and Western European languages, Hyman explores the interplay between gender and two separate but related phenomena: the "process of assimilation," the sociological process by which Jews adopted the cultural patterns of their surrounding societies; and the "project of assimilation," the desire of Jewish communal leaders to embrace assimilation as they reshaped Jewish identity. In a very strong first chapter on Western and Central Europe and America in the nineteenth century, Hyman argues that upwardly mobile and assimilating Jews in those regions successfully adopted prevailing bourgeois values, including the cult of domesticity, the belief that women's true role lay in the private sphere of home and family. Drawing heavily on Marion Kaplan's work on German Jewish women, Hyman demonstrates how Jewish women, relegated to the home as they were, not only persisted in maintaining more of Jewish tradition than Jewish men, but took over from men the task of inculcating Judaism in the next generation. Unfortunately, Jewish men then blamed women for the dangers of assimilation. The situation in Eastern Europe, of course, differed markedly from the situation in the West. Some Jews in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries modernized and secularized, but true assimilation was not possible. Hyman points out that different attitudes toward educating girls and boys among Jews in Eastern Europe enabled many Jewish women to obtain secular education. Moreover, traditional Jewish society always encouraged the participation of women in the public sphere, especially in the economic realm. Thus, Jewish women in Eastern Europe were more vulnerable than men to the lures of the larger society, and indeed, in contrast to the West, more women than men converted to Christianity. Yet because secularization never posed a threat to Jewish survival in Eastern Europe, and because Jewish society there had never adopted the Western bourgeois practice of making women responsible for inculcating Judaism, Jewish men did not blame women for problems in Jewish life. Gender and assimilation interacted in yet another way among the Eastern</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 271 European Jewish immigrants to America. To be sure, the immigrants took for granted that they would Americanize, and women were important agents of Americanization within their families. But because the immigrants themselves were not yet middle class, and had not yet absorbed bourgeois notions of the separation of public and private spheres, Eastern European Jewish immigrant women continued to pursue public roles in the world of work and politics while at the same time protecting their families from the disruptions of assimilation. Moreover, these immigrant women did not become the transmitters of Judaism, as had been the case for assimilating Jewish women in the West in the nineteenth century. Thus, the image of the Jewish immigrant woman, the "Yiddishe Mama," was entirely positive. In her last chapter, "The Sexual Politics of Jewish Identity," Hyman goes beyond the analysis of women's experience and the role of gender in Jewish assimilation to deal with the more problematic subject of relations between the sexes. In Western and Central Europe in the late nineteenth century, antisemitic animosity erupted just as Jews had succeeded in becoming middle class and sought full integration in society. Since antisemites depicted Jews as women--weak, manipulative, and lacking in manly virtues-in order to deprive them of honor and status, Jewish men, especially those who had internalized the criticisms of the antisemites, responded by distinguishing themselves from women, deflecting their anxieties on them, and blaming them for the problems of Jewish life. Hyman provides an extremely convincing argument for why Jewish men blamed Jewish women for the dangers that assimilation posed to Jewish survival. By embracing assimilation, Jewish men had abandoned both Jewish learning, which traditionally accorded status in the Jewish community, and their role in transmitting Judaism to the next generation, a role they had handed to women, whose status was thereby enhanced. In exchange, Jewish men expected to receive status through their success in gentile society, but antisemitism made such recognition difficult. By depicting women in a negative light, Hyman points out, Jewish men expressed their "profound ambivalence about this transfer of responsibility within Jewish families, the enhancement of women's status as guardians of Jewishness, and the further conflation of Jewishness and femaleness" (p. 154). Despite very different circumstances, in America the generation of Jewish men born after World War I also increasingly depicted Jewish women, and especially Jewish mothers, in a negative light. Hyman argues that here too antisemitism played a large role. The period from 1930 to 1947, the one in</page><page sequence="4">272 BOOK REVIEWS which the second generation had successfully Americanized, was also the high-water mark of American antisemitism. Jewish women came to symbolize the conflicts that Jewish men felt about their success in America, especially since women, despite their role in acculturation, had come to symbolize Jewish culture and Jewish continuity, maintaining the boundaries between Jews and gentiles, especially those between their sons and gentile women. Gender and Assimilation in Modern Jewish History provides wonderful insight into the nature of Jewish assimilation in Europe and America, into the experiences of women in the modem period, and into the sexual politics of Jewish life. The only criticism one can level is that as a collection of lectures, it cannot be more than it is. The reader wishes, for example, for a fuller description of the situation of women in Eastern Europe or an analysis of post-World War II America. Criticisms aside, this is an insightful and suggestive book which will surely change our understanding of Jewish assimilation and act as a spur to further research. Marsha L.
