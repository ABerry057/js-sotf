<plain_text><page sequence="1">Donna F. Ryan. The Holocaust and the Jews of Marseille: The Enforcement ofAnti-Semitic Policies in Vichy France. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1996. xviii, 307 pp. Donna Ryan's new book constitutes a welcome addition to the burgeoning scholarly literature on Vichy France's Jewish policies. Ryan's findings do not challenge any of the prevailing assumptions regarding the role of Vichy France in the persecution of the Jews, and she wholeheartedly concurs with the thesis put forth by Michael R. Marrus and Robert Paxton in their Vichy</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 293 France and the Jews (New York, 1981), that the Germans could never have carried out the Final Solution in France as successfully as they did without French collaboration, particularly since there were only 2,500-3,000 German troops stationed on French soil. Nevertheless, by focusing on one important locale in the unoccupied zone, the department of Bouches-du-Rh6ne, Ryan has added greatly to our knowledge of how French bureaucrats, many of whom were not antisemitic zealots, became embroiled in the persecutory process. The department of Bouches-du-Rh6ne provides an interesting test case because it had the largest Jewish population of all the departments in the unoccupied zone (over 30,000 in 1940), due largely to the fact that Marseille, the country's principal port of emigration, served as a magnet for Jews seeking to emigrate in the wake of the German invasion. Marseille also had a sizable population of North African, and especially Algerian, Jews, who were stripped of their citizenship when Vichy revoked the 1870 Cr6mieux decree in October 1940. Like thousands of Central and East European Jews, they were transformed overnight into stateless refugees subject to particularly harsh treatment by the regime. Finally, Marseille was important because it served as the headquarters of the Commissariat General aux Questions Juives (CGQJ); the Union G6n6ral des Israelites de France (UGIF), the Jewish council created by Vichy in November 1941, which remained in Marseille until 1943, when a German crackdown forced it to move to Lyon; and a host of Jewish and non-Jewish relief and emigration organizations. Ryan's principal focus is on the bureaucracy. Like other writers on this subject, she shows that the period from the armistice until the creation of the CGQJ in March 1941 was one of administrative chaos with respect to Jews. Although the Vichy Statut des Juifs of October 1940 targeted native as well as foreign Jews, eliminating them from a wide range of professional activities, Ryan argues that at least until the spring of 1941, native Jews scarcely felt the impact of this policy. Rather, Vichy's attention during this period focused primarily on foreign Jews, who were interned in the fall of 1940. Like others who have written on this subject, including Susan Zuccotti in The Holocaust, the French and the Jews (New York, 1993), and Anne Grynberg in Les Camps de la honte: Les internes juifs des camps franpais, 1939-1944 (Paris, 1991), which strangely is not mentioned in her bibliography, Ryan surveys the harsh conditions that prevailed in the internment camps in southern France, where, as Serge Klarsfeld has shown, some 3,000 foreign Jews died. In terms of explaining why Vichy embarked on the policy of internment, however, Ryan's discussion is not altogether clear. To be sure, Vichy was</page><page sequence="3">294 BOOK REVIEWS intent on reducing the competitive threat posed by foreign Jews, who were heavily involved in commerce and the liberal professions, and indeed, ef- forts in this direction had already begun in the 1930s. Yet Ryan strongly discounts what the regime claimed to be its major goal with respect to foreign Jews-emigration. Like Marrus and Paxton, she suggests that the numerous bureaucratic obstacles to emigration devised by Vichy make it difficult to take this goal seriously. Thus, although the Jewish emigration organization, Hicem, praised the administration in March 1941 for its "benevolent interest" in Jewish emigration and its encouragement of Hicem's efforts "to send overseas as many emigrants as possible," Ryan dismisses this statement as obviously false, and suggests it was made solely for diplomatic reasons (p. 139). On this issue, however, there are many reasons to believe that the regime was entirely sincere in its efforts to foster emigration, and in this respect its policies toward foreign Jews were a direct continuation of policies initiated during the last years of the Third Republic. For the Vichy regime, the major purpose of internment was not to persecute Jews deliberately or to prepare the way for their eventual deportation to the death camps in the East. Rather, by segregating foreign Jews in internment camps, the regime believed that the goal of emigration would be made significantly easier, since these "undesirables" would be ready to leave as soon as their visas arrived. While it is true that Vichy erected numerous barriers to emigration, these arose more from bureaucratic chaos than a deliberate effort to stifle emigration. Moreover, the most significant obstacles did not come from Vichy, but from outside. The Germans, for example, barred all men of military age from departing, and the United States, together with most other Western and South American countries, adhered to extremely restrictive visa policies. Hence, I would argue strongly-and I believe this view is confirmed by archival documents from the French Foreign Ministry as well as the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) archives in New York, neither of which the author drew upon for this study-that the regime was entirely serious about emigration, and that the policy of internment cannot be understood without taking this broader goal into account. With regard to Jewish policy in general, Ryan argues convincingly that a clear direction began to emerge only after the appointment of Xavier Vallat as head of the CGQJ in March 1941. Now, the Vichy regime undertook a census of all Jews; enforced yet another Statut des Juifs, which eliminated Jews from an even wider range of professions and imposed a numerus clausus</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 295 on their participation in the liberal professions and institutions of higher learning; embarked on the process of aryanization, the transfer of Jewish property to non-Jewish controllers; and finally, acceded to German demands in 1942 that French police participate in the roundups of foreign and then of French Jews, to be sent to the death camps in Poland. With respect to this collaboration, Ryan emphasizes the degree to which local officials, especially Maurice Anne Marie de Rodellec du Porzic, the head of the Marseille police, and his assistant, Robert-Stephane Auzanneau, zealously carried out Vichy's bidding, and indeed, it is her main theme that without their enthusiastic collaboration, the implementation of both Vichy and German anti-Jewish policies would not have been so successful. After the war Gaston Kahn of the UGIF accused both Rodellec du Porzic and Auzanneau of crimes against humanity. Rodellec's zeal was so great that even the Vichy police chief, Rene Bousquet, apparently found it excessive, dismissing him from his post in 1943 (although the reasons for Rodellec's dismissal are not altogether clear). According to Ryan, bureaucratic collaboration on Jewish policy proceeded almost unhindered in Marseille, and she furthermore suggests that this generally had the support of pubic opinion. Although many recent works on Vichy's anti-Jewish policy, including Susan Zuccotti's above-mentioned book, Asher Cohen's Persecution et sauvetages: Juifs etfrangais sous l'occupation et sous Vichy (Paris, 1993), and John F. Sweet's Choices in Vichy France: The French under Nazi Occupation (New York, 1986), stress the mixed popular response to Vichy's anti-Jewish policy, emphasizing the degree to which many French citizens opposed certain aspects of it, particularly the deportations, and even frequently helped Jews, Ryan argues that in the department of the Bouches-du-Rh6ne such behavior was extremely rare. The vast majority of the French, Ryan argues, had no objection to antisemitic legislation or the internment of foreign Jews. Moreover, to the extent that many ordinary citizens, as well as members of the clergy, such as the bishop of Marseille, Monsignor Jean Delay, protested the deportations, Ryan suggests they were appalled more by their brutality than by their anti-Jewish character per se. Yet if the Bouches-du-Rh6ne represents the "worst case scenario" with respect to public acquiescence to the regime's anti-Jewish policies, Ryan's discussion nevertheless reveals that significant pockets of opposition existed even here. A number of people, including several Vichy officials, bravely risked their jobs, and were even arrested for following the dictates of conscience. To be sure, Ryan shows that many groups lent their wholehearted support to Vichy's antisemitic agenda. Among the most prominent of these</page><page sequence="5">296 BOOK REVIEWS were the professional groups that stood to gain from the elimination of Jewish competitors: doctors, lawyers, the chambers of commerce, and students. Moreover, Ryan also suggests that there was considerable popular support for the aryanization of Jewish businesses, which in Marseille was carried out on a significant scale; fully one-half of all Jewish businesses here were aryanized. Finally, she also shows that many Jews were apprehended on the basis of personal denunciations, which were frequently initiated by business competitors. Nevertheless, Ryan also reveals significant public disapproval of the regime's Jewish policies. Among professional groups, the architects' associ- ation in Marseille followed its Parisian counterpart in refusing to hand over lists of Jews, at least until 1942 when, under considerable coercion, it turned over incorrect lists. Moreover, the local chambers of commerce, although they never protested the anti-Jewish measures, did object to their being applied to Jewish colleagues who had performed military service. At the time of the mass deportations in the winter and spring of 1942-43, several police officers gave Jews advance warning, allowing them to escape, and by early 1944 the Marseille police were considered unreliable partners in the execution of anti-Jewish actions. As one German official lamented, "The Marseille police force is not with us; I'm going to ask Vichy to clean it out" (p. 204). Moreover, in one of the most courageous acts of protest, the camp commandant at Les Milles, Robert Maulave, refused to participate in handing over internees for deportation during the mass roundups in the summer of 1942, an action that led to his dismissal and ultimately his arrest. As Maulave later explained, he had always envisioned his task as helping Jews to emigrate; never had he intended to send them back to German concentration camps. According to Ryan, there was opposition even at the highest levels of local government. Although she claims that only one high-ranking official, the subprefect of Arles, Jean Seguy, directly protested Vichy's anti-Jewish policies before the end of 1942 (Seguy was arrested by the Gestapo in 1943 for having assisted Jews), others began to voice opposition beginning in 1943. Robert Andrieu, who replaced Rodellec du Porzic as the Marseille police chief, staunchly resisted Nazi demands to turn over Jewish hostages; as he explained to Raymond-Raoul Lambert, the secretary general of the UGIF, he was not "the finger of God" (p. 198). Andrieu was subsequently arrested for resistance activities. The head of the Prefectoral Council, Antoine Zattara, together with several officials in the mayor's office in Cassis, also helped Jews at the time of the deportations. Finally, many churchmen, including Delay, notwithstanding</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 297 significant ambivalence, ultimately protested the deportations, and, as Ryan points out, many clerical orders clandestinely participated in rescue activities. Hence, while Ryan is correct to point out the relative absence of protest against the antisemitic legislation and the policy of aryanization, her claim that opposition to Vichy's antisemitic policies was virtually nonexistent in the Bouches-du-Rh6ne is perhaps too harsh. In particular, her view that Rodellec du Porzic represented the norm seems misplaced, especially since even Vichy officials viewed him as an extremist. Hence, while far too few people followed Maulave's example, not many followed Rodellec's either. The vast majority stood somewhere in between, although Ryan is right to point out that the absence of protest prior to the deportations suggests a significant degree of popular support for Vichy's other anti-Jewish policies. Another important theme of Ryan's book is the role of the various relief organizations. She claims that the major philanthropy operating in the camps in this region was the Quaker-affiliated American Friends Service Committee, although I am not sure this was the case, since the JDC poured huge sums of money into the relief effort, and its activities are barely mentioned. Nevertheless, Ryan deals in an even-handed manner with the efforts of the relief organizations, including the activities of the UGIF, which have frequently come under bitter attack. In particular, the UGIF has been accused of keeping lists of foreign Jews and children housed in Jewish-run children's homes, which eventually made these groups easy targets for Vichy and later German police raids. Other organizations, such as Varian Fry's Emergency Rescue Committee, which worked to secure visas for prominent intellectuals, have been charged with elitism, since they did not deal with the emigration of ordinary foreign Jews. Nevertheless, according to Ryan, the overall impact of the relief efforts was positive, and she argues, rightly I believe, that many foreign Jews would not have survived the first two years of the regime had there not been a significant relief network, especially in light of the sharp impoverishment of the Jewish population due to aryanization, the antisemitic legislation, and internment, all of which stripped Jews of the right to work. Still, Ryan is somewhat critical of the relief organizations, claiming that they did nothing to alert the world to the plight of the Jews, and that they did not do enough to protest the internment policy, in part because the existence of the camps made it far easier to deliver relief than would have been the case had the recipients been scattered over the countryside. On these two issues I believe Ryan's assessment is too harsh. The relief organizations, and especially the JDC, did a great deal to alert the world to the plight of foreign</page><page sequence="7">298 BOOK REVIEWS Jews in France, as any reading of JDC publications from 1940 will show. The extent to which these organizations were successful is indicated by the fact that the New York Times in 1940-41 undertook a campaign to alert public opinion to the fate of foreign Jews in France. Dismayed by this negative publicity, the French ambassador in Washington initiated a countercampaign to explain that foreign Jews had to be interned for economic and security reasons. Indeed, it was largely in response international criticism, especially in the United States and Switzerland, that the Vichy government ultimately appointed Andre Jean-Faure to survey camp conditions in April 1941, an effort which eventually led to many ameliorations and most significantly to the release of many internees. As to Ryan's assertion that the relief organizations turned a blind eye to the evils of internment, I would argue that this charge is somewhat unfair for two reasons: these organizations believed that Vichy's goal vis-ai-vis foreign Jews was emigration, and furthermore, in terms of delivering relief, it was easier to work through the camps. In 1941 the JDC refused to put up money for a plan worked out by another group, the Gourevitch Committee, that would have permitted every refugee with a 1,200 franc guarantee to leave the camps. Had the JDC known these refugees were destined to be deported, there is no doubt it would have given the plan more serious consideration, especially since the French government had agreed to its provisions. To be sure, from a position of hindsight it is easy to say that the organizations deluded themselves as to the regime's intentions, but given the knowledge available to them at the time, together with the fact that Vichy's aim was emigration right up to the spring of 1942, their assumptions made a great deal of sense. Another theme running through Ryan's book is the nature of the Jewish response to Vichy's antisemitic measures and ultimately to the deportations. As mentioned above, she is generally sympathetic to the UGIF, which served as the principal conduit for Jewish relief, and she rightly points out that by 1943 the UGIF was serving in many respects as a resistance organization, since it sponsored a range of clandestine rescue activities, including the fabrication of false papers. Nevertheless, an underlying theme of Ryan's discussion is that native Jews were naive in their response; she argues that the majority of them were caught completely off-guard by the anti-Jewish measures of 1940, and that as late as 1941 they continued to see the regime's antisemitic measures as aimed primarily at foreign Jews. She furthermore claims that one of the leading spokesmen for the native community, Raymond-Raoul</page><page sequence="8">BOOK REVIEWS 299 Lambert, never came to terms with the French government's complicity in the anti-Jewish measures. Once again, this assessment seems too harsh. Native Jewish leaders, and especially Lambert, were well aware by the late 1930s that hostility to foreign Jews would ultimately redound to them, and the fact that the native community created a self-defense organization in 1936 to combat antisemitism, the Centre de Documentation et de Vigilance, indicates that they perceived antisemitism as a serious threat. Moreover, the claim that Jewish leaders like Lambert never came to terms with French governmental complicity is true in the sense that they were profoundly shocked by the enacting of antisemitic legislation, as a reading of Lambert's diary shows. Nevertheless, Lambert did not delude himself that native French Jews would be exempted from antisemitic measures. If Lambert still had any illusions after the French defeat, they were shattered forever by the passage of the first Vichy Statut des Juifs of October 1940. As he wrote in his diary in response to this legislation: "Racism has become the law of the new state. What shame! I still cannot come to terms with this negation of justice and scientific truth. ... All my illusions are shattered [emphasis added].... I cried ... like a man who has suddenly been abandoned by the wife who was the sole love of his life."' Moreover, Ryan notes that nearly half the Jews in the department of Bouches-du-Rh6ne failed to register for the 1941 Jewish census. While it is likely that the majority of them were foreigners, some must have been French. In any case, the failure to comply suggests that many Jews, foreign and perhaps even native, were not altogether naive. Finally, I found somewhat troubling the teleological tone of Ryan's book. Repeatedly, she states that although Vichy never intended to exterminate the Jews, the regime's anti-Jewish policies between 1940 and 1942 "carefully laid the groundwork for the deportations of Jews living in France to the death factories of Auschwitz and Sobibor." To be sure, she is always careful to qualify such statements by saying that "No one in 1940 could foresee precisely where French actions against the Jews would lead" (p. 22), but the constant repetition of this theme suggests that all Vichy actions prior to 1942 were somehow leading up to the Holocaust. While it is technically true that the census of the Jews, their internment, and the passage of the antisemitic laws did facilitate the execution of the Final Solution, it is nevertheless 1. Lambert, Carnet d'un temoin, 1940-43, ed. and annotated by Richard I. Cohen (Paris, 1985), p. 85.</page><page sequence="9">300 BOOK REVIEWS imperative to remember that no one in France, not only in 1940, but even as late as the spring of 1942, believed these policies would lead to the mass murder of the Jews. Hence, while Vichy must take responsibility for its earlier policies, responsibility for the mass murder of the Jews resides squarely with the Germans, notwithstanding Vichy's ancillary responsibility for having lent French police and bureaucratic support to assist them in their dirty work. These reservations notwithstanding, this book presents an extremely well written, thoughtfully conceived, and carefully researched exposition of the fate of Jews in the department of Bouches-du-Rh6ne, particularly during the first two years of the Vichy regime. While it focuses on the local level, it provides a much more general overview of Vichy's anti-Jewish policies, as well as Jewish and non-Jewish relief and rescue activities. Ryan's conclusion that the Final Solution in France was made possible because the "bureaucracy droned on" (p. 220) offers a chilling antidote to Daniel J. Goldhagen's thesis, put forth in Hitler 's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust (New York, 1996), that the Holocaust could not have occurred had not the perpetrators at every level been imbued with a fanatical hatred of Jews. While there can be no doubt that the idea of the Final Solution was the product of such fanaticism, the execution of the Final Solution was all too often carried out by individuals of many nationalities acting out of far more mundane motives.
