All scholarly articles directly bearing on some aspect of Judaica will be considered for publication in AJSreview. Two copies of each manuscript should be sent directly (no prior inquiries are necessary!) to the Editor, AJSreview, Widener M, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA. All correspondence should be directed to that address. 2. No article accepted by AJSreview may appear in any other publication, in whole or in part, in its original language or in translation, before its ap- pearance in AJSreview. 3. Manuscripts must be submitted on regulation weight and size (81/2 X I 1"-not legal size) paper. Xerox copy or photoreproduction of equivalent quality is acceptable. 4. ALL MATERIAL, including footnotes and indented quotes (extracts), must be typed in DOUBLE SPACE. Leave wide margins on every page. 5. A manuscript should be submitted only in its final, completed form. The cost of author's alterations made in galleys will be charged to the author. It should be remembered that a very slight change may result in the resetting of many lines of type. TYPESETTING IS COSTLY! As a matter of policy, AJSreview will not publish lists of corrections. Authors should be as conscientious about the format of their articles as they are about the content. No author's alterations may be made in page proofs at all. Any alterations in the original manuscript must be made by typewriter and not by hand. If a manuscript is not neatly presented, it may be returned to the author for retyping. Standard American proofreaders' marks, as found in any style manual and many dic- tionaries, should be used for making changes or corrections. 6. The general guide for style is A Manual of Style, 12th ed., published by VII</page><page sequence="7">VIII NOTES FOR CONTRIBUTORS the University of Chicago Press. The authority for English usage and spell- ing is Webster's Third International Dictionary of the English Language. While fine writing and elegance are to be prized, excessively rhetorical or exotic language detracts from the flow of an argument. Faddish or pseudo- technical language should be avoided. While a writer should not refer to himself excessively, when he does so, the pronoun "I" should generally be used. The Editors reserve final judgment on all matters of style and usage. 7. Assemble footnotes in separate sheets at the end of the article. TYPE FOOT- NOTES IN DOUBLE SPACE AND LEAVE WIDE MARGINS. Footnotes must be numbered consecutively: 1, 2, 3, 4-not 1, 2, 2a, 3 or 1, 1*, 2, 3. Please recheck manuscript to see that all footnote numbers and all footnotes are present and correspond appropriately. 8. Give place and date of publication (but not publisher) of all works cited except common handbooks. Full first names of authors, unless there are two initials, should be used: Andre Dupont, not A. Dupont; S. W. Baron, not S. Baron. The form of a name as listed by the Library of Congress is generally to be preferred. Place names are given in their customary English form. 9. In referring to publications previously cited in a footnote, short title and not "op. cit." or "loc. cit." should be used. 10. Use Arabic numerals in all references, including volume numbers of periodicals and multivolume works, unless there is a specific reason for us- ing Roman numerals (as in page numbers of a preface). Dates should be written in the traditional fashion: December 12, 1956-not 12 December 1956. 11. Crossreferences to pages within an article cannot be given. One may make a crossreference to a footnote (see above, n. 23) or to a section within an article (see below, sec. 12). If an author feels he must use crossreferences, he should write his articles in numbered sections so as to make this possible. A few simple "see above" or "see below" references are acceptable as well. Please use "above" and "below" rather than "infra" and "supra." 12. Works in manuscript should be cited by library shelfmark and not by catalog number: MS Bodley Opp. Add. 4to, 38-not Neubauer 1373. The recto and verso of a folio are indicated by r and v respectively; columns by a and b: fol. 27va; fols. 16r, 17v. This does not apply to references to the Tal- mud or other printed Hebrew works, e.g., B.T. Sabbath 14b.</page><page sequence="8">NOTES FOR CONTRIBUTORS IX 13. References to a passage extending over several pages should give the first and last page numbers. Do not use f., ff., or et seq. 14. In articles in English, words in Hebrew or other non-Latin characters should not be used unless it is essential to do so. Transliteration or transla- tion is to be preferred. Foreign language material should be confined to footnotes. 15. Articles in Hebrew should follow the format of the Hebrew articles pre- viously published in this journal. 16. The transliteration scheme for Hebrew is as given below. Dagesh b.azaq is indicated by doubling the letter (except for sh and after the definite article or a preposition): ha-bishuvim ve-ha-shiqqulim ba-sefer. While it is recog- nized that some fields employ their own systems of transliteration with many diacritical marks, authors are kindly requested to adhere to our sys- tem whenever possible.

The Editors make every attempt to have manuscripts appraised as expeditiously as possible but no guarantee can be given concerning the amount of time required before a report can be returned to an author. AJSreview draws upon a wide, international body of manuscript appraisers</page><page sequence="10">NOTES FOR CONTRIBUTORS XI who may or may not be members of the Editorial Advisory Council or, in- deed, members of AJS. All manuscripts are read anonymously. The ano- nymity rule requires that no reader may know the name of the author of a manuscript nor may the author know the names of the readers. To ensure this, authors should avoid revealing their identity in a manuscript. Do not use such phrases as "See my article . . ," "I thank my teacher, John Doe," etc. No author nor anyone acting on his behalf may approach the Editors or any other person to ascertain the identity of manuscript appraisers. 18. Upon acceptance of their articles, contributors are requested to submit an abstract of approximately 300 words in English. Short articles (appear- ing in the "Notes" section) should be accompanied by abstracts of approxi- mately 100 words.</page><page sequence="11">AJSreview VOLUME FOUR 1979</page></plain_text>
