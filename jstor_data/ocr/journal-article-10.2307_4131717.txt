Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998. xxi, 280 pp. "What is it that must precede the conveying of history? Must there not be the declaration of a double passion, an eros for the past and an ardor for the oth- ers in whose name there is a felt urgency to speak?" asks Edith Wyschogrod. She continues: "to be a historian ... is to accept the destiny of the spurned lover-to write, photograph, film, televise, archive, and simulate the past not merely as its memory bank but as binding oneself by a promise to the dead to tell the truth about the past" (p. xi). By positing the responsibility of the historian peremptorily as a "promise," thus implying a binding obligation to others, Wyschogrod tilts her dis- cussion of the writing of history away from the cognitive realm and toward "post- modern" ethics. Her intricate reflections are marked by an overwhelming con- sciousness of the uniqueness of our age, in which the historian must breast the cumulative moral impact of the experiences of organized "scientific" murder and genocide and the staggering and disconcerting manipulation of information made 8.

To execute her ambitious analytical design, Wyschogrod resorts to the piv- otal figure of the "heterological historian," a dialogical gravitational center through whom the relational complexity of writing history is unmasked: she-and the fem- inine gender becomes a heuristic imperative-is "a multiplicity of conceptual per- sonae ... a thinker through whom a particular thought-perspective is exhibited, someone frenzied who is in search of what precedes history; the passionate advo- cate of another; the Socratic gadfly who challenges received assumptions" (p. xiii). Here is just a mellow intimation of Wyschogrod's discursive style, and the exem- plification is meant as a warning. For, on the one hand, the themes in the book are enunciated with fascinating passion and intriguing urgency, deploying the kind of sweeping, declamatory advocacy that makes them resonate with the categorical force of relevancy and necessity. On the other, the conception is executed all too often as a rambling tour de force, a tracery of overwrought sentences plodding for- ward breathlessly in the obscurantist, damning virtuosism of cryptic postmodernist argot. The procedure culminates in some memorable utterances: for example, we read, "Death as the ultimate negation is a non-product, a workless work whose val- ue cannot be determined by labor" (p. 247); "the heterological historian can reply to Nietzsche that the diseased body is the destitution of alterity written upon the face of nature, that de-signs its aesthetic surface" (p. 96); "images of the past must first be seen as released from the individual cogito and later from the regimenting conditions of transcendental subjectivity to be replayed before a transpersonal sub- ject" (p. 113); "Can the cataclysm be understood as such an unsurpassable exteri- ority, an outside that cannot be poetized and that fissures communities of imma- nence?" (p. 218). Comparable overcharged miniatures appear with implacable regularity, linguistic matter so dense that the light of my understanding struggled to pierce and defuse, finally resigning to bend around it. For the undeterred, this work exposes insightful comparisons and contrasts, engaging, for example, Kant and Hegel to discuss their conceptions of history in one breath with Derrida and Althusser; or Husserl and Heidegger to confront con- temporary naturalized theories of time and consciousness. But in places I found Wyschogrod's emphases incomplete or misguided. Thus, for example, for all its dramatic appeal, I am puzzled by her insistence on the historian's vocation and re- sponsibility to the dead, those helpless and mute "nameless others" who are sup- posedly given a "countenance," a voice and hope by the empathetic, almost lachry- mose, "heterological historian." For the duty and responsibility of the historian is first and foremost to the living, to whom s/he is bound by social rules of "conver- sation" that demand a commitment to truth in what we say: the historian is, in this respect, a trustee of memory, shaping, nurturing, and safeguarding the ballast of the social self and identity of the present and future generations. Despite all the ambiguous virtues of empathetic understanding, the space that separates us from those whose lives were truncated remains an incommensurable, gaping abyss star- ing at us with its opaque, question-fraught darkness, and no hermeneutic somer- sault can animate it to luminous transparency. Elsewhere, I found her interlude on 382</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews mnemotechnics both thin in expressive depth and redundant to her argument, as if the avid pen could not let go of a succulent sideline in a Lucullan feast of infor- mation. Wyschgrod is at her best in her perceptive treatment of the impact of the con- temporary information-technology revolution and the hypertropy of visual stimu- lations on the writing of history, diagnosing with keen intelligence and a wealth of examples issues of technology's "active interference in the world," and the added burdens and sometimes arduous demands it makes on the historian (chap. 3). The manipulative pyrotechnics that virtual reality affords are of special concern at a time when history is being unscrupulously rewritten and "denied" by warlike coali- tions spurred by sheer power, reckless ideology, and demagoguery. Even the plainest images--lingering in the interstices between perception and judgment and enjoying a privileged status in the popular imagination, as expressed in the mis- guided truism that "images don't lie"-require "narrative orchestration if [their] meaning is to emerge and narratives differ in the claims they make about their ref- erents" (p. I11). Take the recent conflict in Kosovo, for example. One striking im- age of a corpse lying in a crater with, in the background, a truck loaded with oth- er bodies, charred and shredded, became the leading photograph in a number of magazines. The Serbian officials who took journalists to the site claimed the vic- tim was an Albanian refugee killed, like all the others in the picture, in a botched NATO bombing attack. And yet, news editors familiar with the conflict could le- gitimately ask, Who made the crater? Was the body dragged by Serbian forces anx- ious to score a point with international public opinion? Whose bodies are really in the background? And who is the photojournalist who took the picture, does he have an agenda? The photo may have been staged, the bodies may have been reposi- tioned to create an effect. Far from constituting genuine "evidence," then, the pic- ture may contribute to muddle the facts instead of clarifying them.' The forging of collective memory escapes more and more the cudgel of the historian. Dominant power has at its disposal massive means for the control of its self-representation. Indeed, the kind of intense and non-conformist documentary photo essays that the British photographer Larry Burrows produced during the Vietnam War-a body of work that played an important role in undermining the support of American public opinion for this armed conflict-would today be un- thinkable because the reporting profession has undergone a radical transformation since his heroic times. In a climate of increasing assault, the lonely voice of the heterological historian struggles to emerge from moral cacophony and indetermi- nacy to serve as a sure bridge between yesterday and tomorrow.
