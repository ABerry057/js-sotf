We are beset by fears of forgetting it or twisting it out of recognition. Polemics about what to remember and what to forget divide societies all over the world. One of the most fruitful academic perspectives on this anxiety was initiat- ed in the 1980s with the work of the French historian Pierre Nora. Nora formulat- ed a "fundamental opposition" between memory ("the remnants of experience still lived in the warmth of tradition, in the silence of custom, in the repetition of the ancestral") and the "problematic and incomplete . .. reconstruction" that is histo- 213</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review ry.' He then launched the encyclopedic project of documenting the "memory sites" (lieux de memoire) of French consciousness, those sites, both material and sym- bolic, located "between memory and history," which had become invested with his- torical meaning in modern France. His original purpose had been to deconstruct such sites, in modem scholarly fashion to reveal their mythic nature, but, as the re- viewer of an English translation of part of the resulting 5,600-page collective work points out, at its completion Nora conceded, that as a consequence of the speed with which even these constructed sites were passing out of popular memory, "commemoration ha[d] overtaken" his project and it had become "a sort of schol- arly lieu de memoire in its own right."2 For Jewish history, the corresponding theoretician has been Yosef Yerushalmi, whose Zakhor: Jewish History and Jewish Memory, which appeared at the same time as Nora's work, is a meditation on the chasm that separates pre-modern Jew- ish memory, covenantal and cyclical, from modem Jewish historiography.3 In the contemporary world, however, as Nora has copiously demonstrated, history and memory, collective if not covenantal, engage in a complex interplay. Tracing some of the results, specifically in relation to the fabled "traditional" Jewish world of Eastern Europe, is the subject of the two books under review. Both are the work of scholars who have made major contributions to their respective fields, Steven Zip- perstein in Jewish history, David Roskies in Jewish literature. The present works are both collections of essays linked by common metahistorical themes. These themes require the authors, each in their own way, to distance themselves from the normative scholarly voice and assume a much riskier stance. In both cases, the re- sults are more than worth the risk. Zipperstein's purpose, he forthrightly states in his prologue, is "to challenge some of the barriers between professional and popular knowledge of the world" (p. 3). The first of his essays traces the image of the shtetl in American Jewish con- sciousness. He makes use of literary works by writers such as Abraham Cahan, Anzia Yezierska, Isaac Rosenfeld and Philip Roth, not to mention Fiddler on the Roof in order to touch upon "moments of Jewish life that fall between the cracks of the more standard historical narratives about American Jewry" (p. 19). He uncovers a fanta- sy shtetl framed by the hopes and fears of the postwar Jewish migration to subur- bia. This essay is still conventional cultural history. But in the following two es- says the narrator increasingly breaks through his narrative. In both cases, the occasion is an encounter with newly opened Russian archives. In "Reinventing Heders," Zipperstein discovers in the transcripts of Russian Jewish teachers' meet- ings at the turn of the century a clear consensus toward the rehabilitation of the tra- ditional heder in the interests of "national" education. Earlier research, including Zipperstein's own, largely based on the writings of political activists, had suggest- ed a scenario of "assimilationist" teachers "brought around" by the ideologues. What emerges through the new archival window is a sense that more "national" 1. "Between Memory and History: Les Lieux de Mkmoire," Representations 26 (Spring 1989), 7-8.

The new cultural strategies were therefore "at one and the same time, self-consciously conservative yet modem, traditional yet pro- gressive, and nationalist yet different from the nationalism of the well-known, ide- ologically preoccupied political parties" (p. 60). For these Jews, in other words, the heder had begun to function as a lieu de memoire. In the following chapter, Zipperstein engages his own past work even more directly by focusing on his changing understanding of his reasons for studying Jewish Odessa.4 Having relied in his research chiefly on maskilic texts, Zip- perstein believed "until recently" that he was sifting them for "what could be learned about the city's economic and social life, its high, as well as its popular, culture." But after exposure in newly accessible archives to "far more archival ma- terial on Odessa Jews than could be absorbed in ten lifetimes," Zipperstein is led to re-evaluate his relationship to his subject (p. 78). What he realizes is that all along, what had most fascinated him about Odessa was less its hard-headed com- mercial core than its margins, as exemplified in the problematic lives of the au- thors-Mendele, Dubnow, Bialik, Ahad Ha-Am-whose writings he had studied. It was their collective memory, as codified by their disciples, that had been "im- posed on twentieth-century Jewry." But these influential ideologies, Zipperstein concludes, were conceived in an urban environment that was totally indifferent to them. They were conceived, that is, "against [a] backdrop of abiding loss," and it is this loss that is Zipperstein's true subject (pp. 82-83). Appropriately, the last chapter is about writing Jewish history in the shadow of the Holocaust. In flight from modern Jewish "folk memory," that collapses Jew- ish history into a narrative of escalating destruction, Zipperstein and other aca- demic historians had sought "to implode collective memory, to juxtapose as stark- ly as possible the differences between history and myth, scholarship and error" (p. 95). But another experience in the post-communist world, that of visiting East- ern Europe and perceiving these lands, inescapably after all, as "killing fields," leads Zipperstein to a changed stance as a historian. As an example of fine recent history-writing that gains from the commemorative urge that informs it, Zipper- stein cites Theo Richmond's book Konin: A Quest, a monumental and loving at- tempt, rooted in oral testimony, to document the life of a shtetl down to its out- houses.5 And in the past, he rediscovers in his predecessor Dubnow, who invented Russian Jewish history, "demands for a sober historiography" coexisting with "[a] powerful authorization of history as an answer to the needs of the folk" (p. 91). That a Jewish scholar should address "the needs of the folk" is something David Roskies takes for granted. But how to address such needs at the start of the twenty-first century? First of all, with a healthy dose of irony. Roskies calls his book a map to "a vacation in Jewish lands. Alternatively, every chapter treats a dif- ferent subject, in a kind of scavenger hunt with multiple prizes. ... Rousseau has 4.

But the Torah teach- es that the life of each Jew is essentially the same. One map serves all" (p. xi). Here are ironic echoes of Mendele's anxiety a century ago about representing the Jew- ish "ant-hill." But the stops on Roskies' tour are rather up-to-date; following Nora, Roskies calls them "memory-sites." They are what remains when the covenantal narrative has collapsed; at best what is left of the past is "isolated, segregated, repackageable" (p. 9). The tour begins with a bird's eye view of the terrain ahead, from Haskala to the March of the Living. From this perspective, Tevye emerges as a unique and ex- emplary marker, a figure capable of neutralizing, in his own person, the contra- diction between memory and history. "Sholem Aleichem," writes Roskies, "did precisely what Yerushalmi thought to be impossible: he recast the historical predicament of the modern Jew into the language of fatalism and faith" (p. 11). But for the other tour sites, loss is a given. From the Oyneg Shabes Archive of the Warsaw Ghetto, to literary and popular images of the shtetl and the rabbi, to Jew- ish popular song, to the Honor Row of the Workmen's Circle Cemetery in Queens, to the Montreal Yiddish school system, to the figure of the talush, the wayward seeker who "has come to define the moral center and moral angst of present-day Israel" (p. 167), Roskies traces what he calls "a dialectic of loss and retrieval," the construction of memory-sites "fashioned from the prior awareness of loss" (p. x). Even as Jewish small town life, for example, was riven by change and Jews began to feel their past slip away, Jewish writers turned the shtetl into their key protago- nist. "The shtetl was dead. Long live the shtetl!" declares Roskies (p. 49), and traces successive versions of the shtetl from Mendele, Sholem Aleichem and Peretz through Sholem Asch, Bashevis Singer and Agnon to Theo Richmond, Steve Stern and Allen Hoffman. In the hundreds ofyizkor books commemorating Jewish com- munities obliterated during the Holocaust, the movement Roskies traces comes full circle: The shtetl again becomes "a covenantal landscape" (p. 64). Similarly with song. The theater music of the maskil Abraham Goldfaden, who first had men and women sing together on the stage, becomes "traditional" in the New World, while Moshe Nadir's "Az der rebe Elimeylekh," written in New York to parody hasidim, "made it to the top of the neoHasidic hit parade on both sides of the Atlantic" (p. 114). Zipperstein's book is about writing history; Roskies' is about that and also something else. For if in fact "the moment the past is finally laid to rest is the very moment that it reasserts its claim upon the living" (p. 59), we may legitimately question the present, however impoverished, in the name of the future. Indeed, the lessons Roskies learns from "the brief sojourn in utopia" that was Montreal Yid- dish culture is that, first, "all Jews live after the hurban beit hamidrash, the de- struction of traditional faith, but out of that loss, a new and viable culture can be reinvented," and, second, indispensable for doing so is a sound ideology (p. 157). Yet, of all the memory sites Roskies visits, only the Zionist one offers hope for fur- ther renewal because, according to Roskies, "Zionism is protean, inclusive, and heteroglossic. Within the discourse of Zionism the language of exile coexists with the language of covenantal space" (pp. 170-171). Meanwhile, in the exile itself, the milk can that held the archives of the Warsaw Ghetto, now on exhibit at the 216</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews Holocaust Museum in Washington, resembles something that "might just as well have dropped from another planet," and "the literary-historical canon it protected from destruction" remains unknown (p. 40). Second Avenue, that "folk reposito- ry of Jewish collective memory" has been exchanged for "'Sunrise, Sunset,' glitzy, sentimental, mass-marketed ethnic pop." The klezmer revival is "born-again" and the Yiddish folksong revival arrived "a generation too late." The Second Avenue star Aaron Lebedeff's tri-lingual patter, with which Roskies closes his essay on popular song, expands beyond this context as an epitaph for the redemptive possi- bilities of the diaspora as a whole: " Vot ken you makh? Es izAmerike! Amerike un bol'she nitshevo [What can you do? It's America! America and nothing more]" (pp. 117-19). In other words, sometimes dead is really dead. What begins to res- onate here is the old-fashioned Zionist discourse about the emptiness of the galut, a particularly odd turn though when the context is the creativity of the East Euro- pean Jewish diaspora. Never again? Sitting in exile, one is tempted to respond with a sentence from that hoch-diasporist Walter Benjamin: "Like every generation that preceded us, we have been endowed with a weak messianic power, a power to which the past has a claim."6 Michael Steinlauf Gratz College Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 6.
