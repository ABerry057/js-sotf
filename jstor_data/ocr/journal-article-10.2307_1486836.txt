<plain_text><page sequence="1">420 BOOK REVIEWS Barry Dov Walfish. Esther in Medieval Garb: Jewish Interpretation of the Book of Esther in the Middle Ages. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1993. xiv, 386 pp. The well-known talmudic discussion of whether the Scroll of Esther was truly canonical-whether it rendered the hands ritually impure, and whether it was divinely inspired-manifested both the fascination and the doubts that its story elicited among ancient readers. Strewn with motifs from Near Eastern folklore, devoid of explicit reference to God, and patently a product of Jewish experience in the Diaspora, Esther challenged the imagination and the theological sensitivities of the rabbis as much as it testified to the workings of divine providence in human history. By the time that the world of Jewish antiquity gave way to that of the Middle Ages, Esther had successfully qualified as Holy Scripture, but its ability to captivate and to stimulate the mind and pen of the exegete did not abate. On the contrary, as Barry Dov Walfish's monograph ably demonstrates, Esther appealed directly to the perspective of medieval Jewish scholars, who shared with their heroic forebears in ancient Susa much of the difficulty of survival and self-expression as a religious minority in a land not their own. Did Ahasuerus' cooperation with Haman derive from wickedness, weak- ness, or essentially well-intentioned naivete? How ought one to evaluate Esther's willingness to join the royal harem, coupled with her reluctance to reveal her identity as a Jew? To what extent did Mordecai exemplify the qualities of the ideal courtier-or the attributes of good moral leadership as elaborated in Aristotle's Ethics? Does the story of Purim celebrate the victory of biblical theology over an Averroistic inclination to astrology (exhibited by Haman), or does it relate the victory of good constellations over evil ones? To what extent can one explain the workings of the Persian court-e.g., in the trial and dismissal of Vashti-according to Aristotelian standards of justice and political behavior? What lessons does Esther teach the medieval Jew concerning adaptation in the face of hostility and alienation? How does the story offer insight into the divine master-plan for the ultimate redemption of the Jewish people? These are only a few of the many questions that exercised medieval Jewish commentators on Esther, whose responses Walfish has collected in Esther in Medieval Garb, an outgrowth of his 1983 University of Toronto doctoral dissertation. Walfish has surveyed some thirty medieval commentaries, from the days of Rashi through the sixteenth century, and here</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 421 presents a study of their methods, emphases, and ideas. Part I (chapters 1-4) considers the concerns of the various commentaries with Hebrew grammar, lexicography, rabbinic midrash, Kabbalah, and Jewish historiography (in this case Jossipon); their reliance on non-Jewish sources-Aristotle, rhetoric, and astrology; their literary sensitivities to the style and structure of the biblical story; and the theological issues that engaged them. In Part II (chaps. 5-9) Walfish proposes to "leave the exegete's study and step out into the street" (p. 95), assessing the impact of the exegetes' distinctly medieval experience on noteworthy issues in their commentaries: the geography, architecture, and culture of ancient Persia; the realia and prevailing attitudes of interaction be- tween Gentiles and Jews; the nature of the antisemitism confronting Diaspora Jewry; the workings of the royal court; and the relations between Jews and Gentile monarchs. There follow two appendices, including a helpful review of the exegetes and their opera, then bibliographies, and, finally, detailed indices. Esther in Medieval Garb amasses much interesting material, drawing from hitherto-unpublished sources as well as from printed editions, and testifies to the impressively erudite and persevering research of its author. Walfish correctly notes the dearth of works of intellectual history based on the study of biblical exegesis, and he admirably undertakes to focus on the linkage between the cultural and historical context of the commentator and the substance of his commentary. Again, we must suffice with mere mention of several fruits of this endeavor: helpful distinctions between the characteristic tendencies of Northern French, Spanish, and Provengal exegetes (chaps. 1-2); an insightful excursus on the literary analysis of Isaac Arama (pp. 68 ff.); acknowledgment of the "positive influence that contacts with Gentiles had on the development of Jewish thought" (p. 120); identification of particular incidents of Castilian court intrigue which may well have motivated rabbinic reflection on the biblical Haman (pp. 168, 192); and Abraham Saba's provocative contrast between the Ishmaelite ancestry of Ahasuerus and the Edomite roots of Haman (p. 136). As a work of intellectual history, however, Esther in Medieval Garb does not venture far enough. Its organization around themes within the exegetical literature on Esther, and not according to the progression of the biblical story or around the works of particular exegetes (or schools of thought), militates against a concerted treatment of the Scroll of Esther on the one hand, or of developments in the history of exegesis on the other. Owing to</page><page sequence="3">422 BOOK REVIEWS the structure of the volume, the author's conclusions are necessarily brief (less than half a page for each of the nine chapters, under four pages of "concluding remarks" at the end), conjectural, and ultimately inconclusive. Especially in view of the author's learned and painstaking research, I found this particularly disappointing. The author has laid the groundwork for much instructive historical analysis; one can only hope that he will return to the sources he has mined so well and consider their import more thoroughly.
