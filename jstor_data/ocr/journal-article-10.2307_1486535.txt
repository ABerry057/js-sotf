<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rachel Feldhay Brenner. Writing as Resistance: Four Women Confronting the Holocaust. University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1997. vii, 216 pp. Sara Horowitz. Voicing the Void: Muteness and Memory in Holocaust Fiction. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1997. vii, 276 pp. Far from the slackening one might expect more than fifty years into post-Holocaust history, the number of books about the Holocaust continues to multiply. The quality of this writing, moreover, is impressively high in most areas, including the fields of literary and cultural criticism, to which both these books are contributions. To be sure, differences mark individual writings on the Holocaust as on any subject, and Holocaust writings collectively have not entirely avoided the "deformations" against which critics have warned almost from the time of their origin. Even work open to this objection, however, often responds to the exaggeration of a quality that in itself had been a positive factor. Few writers about the Holocaust have been impeded by doubts, let alone denials, that their work has ethical presuppositions and implications; they assume this when they don't argue it, and it is, in any event, evident in the form and content of their writing, virtually a stylistic feature that is all the more notable and compelling because of its usual absence from academic or scholarly works. I mention this moral impulse in writings about the Holocaust because, apart from its general status, its presence is evident and fruitful in Rachel Brenner's account of four women writers caught up in the Holocaust and is the focus of Sara Horowitz's analysis of muteness as a key to the understanding (and before that, the writing) of Holocaust fiction: the limit of silence or linguistic inadequacy which that writing both asserts and attempts to overcome. To be sure, the same moral impulse can sometimes turn the text against its author through the forced judgments or moralizing it encourages (and which at times</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 157 surface in both books). But even then, the issues raised have an instructive weight they would not have in other settings. Brenner's account of writing as resistance sets out from the significant common elements she finds in the four figures whom she considers: Simone Weil, Edith Stein, Anne Frank, and Etty Hillesum. All of them were women born Jewish into fairly assimilated (acculturated?) households; all were writers (most relevantly for Brenner, of autobiographical texts); all perished either as a direct or (in the case of Weil, who starved herself to death in England) indirect consequence of the Holocaust; all of them--this is the core of Brenner's thesis--resisted the Nazi effort at dehumanization by the act of writing and by the "solidarity, sympathy, and identification with [other] victims" evident in that act and in their conduct more generally. (Brenner regards these facets of empathy as also reflecting their identity as women, although this claim remains relatively undeveloped.) Necessarily Brenner recognizes important differences among the four: most notably, that Stein was a Carmelite nun when she was killed in Auschwitz, and that Weil, who was only one step (baptism) away from Catholicism, came as close to overt antisemitism as most antisemites (in- cluding, in her varied writings, a cloak of silence about the Holocaust). But these differences-and others that go unremarked, the most obvious being the age-difference between Anne Frank, barely a teenager when she died, and the others: all are grouped together by Brenner as "intellectuals" and "cosmopolites"--matter less in her view than the content of their writings and their lives, and the relationship between these; specifically, the respective responses of the four to the extremity they faced. Brenner's account is at its best in analyzing the individual responses that shaped the authors' autobiographical writings. This leads in turn to suggestive comments about autobiographical discourse more generally as a means of creating and affirming the self, a process central for Brenner's characterization of the four as participants in the wartime "resistance" against the Nazi attack not only on the Jews but, in Brenner's view, on the humanistic tradition. There has been considerable disagreement, in reference to the Holocaust, about what types of conduct other than overt expressions should count as resistance. The broad definition used by Brenner, which includes the writing of diaries or memoirs, is certainly arguable, although it seems that more needs to be said about the relationship (and differences) among types of resistance. Horowitz posits the feature of muteness or silence as a key to the central theoretical issue affecting the status of Holocaust fiction: the jus-</page><page sequence="3">158 BOOK REVIEWS tification--morally, conceptually-for representing the brute facts of the Holocaust in imaginative form. The arguments against such representations have ranged from the traditional Platonic attack against art as such--art simply as a cognitive and emotive falsification--to more nuanced critiques of Holocaust art as misrepresenting the impersonality of genocide and/or imposing individual artifice (the artist's) on events so severe that they not only speak for themselves (thus, as history) but defy any effort to "improve on" their core representation. Interestingly, Horowitz's apologia for Holocaust fiction is itself couched in representational terms, claiming that such fiction is capable of capturing aspects of the reality of the Holocaust that other forms of representation either miss or realize less adequately; and that the prooftext for this defense appears in the feature of muteness or silence that is prominent as both means and content in the writers she cites. This feature, she suggests--evident in the many characters in Holocaust fiction who are aphasiac or feeble-minded or refrain from speaking, and in the stylistic manner that some Holocaust texts attain through literary devices like discontinuity, "deflated rhetoric," and non-narrated narration-contributes to a collective representation of the inadequacy of expression and comprehension in respect to the Holocaust. To be sure, this inadequacy is not by itself the whole story (for if so the genre would be silence alone). Although the Holocaust "defies our best efforts to know ... [or] to tell," Holocaust writers "simultaneously succeed and fail"-with their success evidently twofold: representing the struggle to tell an event beyond telling (itself a representation of the event), and then in actually recovering at least some memories that can be expressed notwithstanding the limitations of the discourse. This is a powerful counter-argument to the critiques of Holocaust imagina- tive literature that typically find a source in Adorno's denunciation of"poetry after Auschwitz." Horowitz's writing itself, moreover, has a compellingly fluid reach to it-at once judicious and incisive (quite a different representation than the muteness about which she writes), as she moves "tellingly" among figures as diverse as Wiesel and Celan, Ringelblum and Kosinski, Jakov Lind and Primo Levi. Her accounts of these and the other authors she discusses are penetrating as practical criticism and to some extent support her overall thesis. I say "to some extent" because that practical criticism also, to some extent, poses itself against her thesis. The general claim that the Holocaust is incomprehensible and ineffable, which on her account is made apparent in Holocaust fiction by various artistic strategies, has been often cited on more abstract or theoretical grounds, but neither of these approaches means that the</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 159 claim's truth is self-evident or even at all evident. Unless it is meant only as a metaphor for the Holocaust's moral enormity (which it often is, sometimes by Horowitz herself), its literal or empirical status would yet have to be assessed. And on this point it can surely be argued that the voluminous writings and testimonies about the Holocaust have by now yielded at least as much and as clear a comprehension of that event, notwithstanding its enormity, as has been the case for most large-scale historically and morally charged events. Furthermore, Horowitz makes it clear that the fiction on which she focuses is essentially dependent on an historical and conceptual substructure that itself is non- or extra-fictional. However inconsistent, it is no accident, it seems to me, that she includes a finely drawn chapter comparing Ringelblum's Diary and the Lodz Chronicle, or an (admittedly brief) exposition of the philosopher Jean Amery, in a book on Holocaust fiction--not in order to represent the diary or chronicle or philosophical reflection as fictional in the same sense that Lind's Soul of Wood (for example) is, but, as I read it, to confirm the implications of the more obvious "fictions" she analyzes in those other modes of discourse. Against the postmodernist (and sometimes her own) conception that views history, because of its typical narrative structures, as another genre of fiction, Horowitz seems at these junctures to regard fiction as a genre of history. Perhaps fiction, or at least Holocaust fiction, is usefully viewed in such terms, but this would then seem to require, within the now very broad category of historical writing, distinctions of a sort more traditionally drawn externally between fiction and its Others. As further evidence of this uneasy conflation of types of discourse, I would cite the issue of literary evaluation, which goes unmentioned by Horowitz-an absence that by implication places all the authors she considers, and many whom she does not, on the same level. (Appelfeld, for example, whom she mentions only incidentally, and who is an obvious "practitioner" of silence, is one of a number of authors with stronger claims as writers than certain of those she considers.) When she transposes the imaginative writing of authors as different in literary standing as Celan and Wiesel (for example) into quasi-theoretical statements of meaning, their respective writings, at least in that respect, appear as one; and indeed all Holocaust fiction is presumably open to the same sort of transposition. But this hardly allows for the differences among writers of Holocaust fiction from one other or, indeed, from any other writers. What does distinguish them would thus remain to be formulated in terms of fictional discourse or "literariness" itself. To some extent, Horowitz does this when she addresses their writings individually,</page><page sequence="5">160 BOOK REVIEWS but it is not much evident in the conceptual framework of her book-or in the larger (and also evaluative) question of how the representation of muteness in Holocaust fiction compares with its corollaries in other modes of discourse. To address these issues, however, would require elaboration in a work already rich in valuable insights and associations about the structures of Holocaust fiction both collectively and in many individual appearances. Horowitz's book deserves a place among the canonical works on the literary representation of the Holocaust. Berel Lang Trinity College Hartford, Conn.</page></plain_text>
