<plain_text><page sequence="1">Daniel Meir Weil. The Masoretic Chant of the Hebrew Bible. Jerusalem: Rubin Mass, 1996. 397 pp. (English), 31 pp. (Hebrew). Never before have I found a book so hard to review. The learned author spent years researching the most complex material, and probably even more time working out an original theory to account for all the ramifications. The result is a methodical, challenging, but frustrating illustration of the perils of scholarship: how a conscientious researcher, while doing his best to explain everything, can still baffle his readers and lose them. Hebraists have found it much easier to determine the true phonetic value of each of the Tiberias vowel-signs than the vocal pitch corresponding to the written accents (or atm,). The vowel notation is simpler and fairly transparent; not much linguistic acumen is needed to prove that there are seven vowel-qualities like those of standard Italian and Portuguese, including [o] for and [E] for .., even though no regional branch of Jewry has accurately preserved all such features of the Tiberias Hebrew phonology.' The Hebrew system of accents, however, is very intricate and has no close analogue in any other language or textual corpus. To recover the very tones in which the Tiberias Masoretes read the sacred text has scarcely been attempted by any serious Hebraist since the school of Tiberias sank into oblivion many 1. The seven vowels of the Ashkenazic synagogue pronunciation in America and England are due to a rather recent reform-accurate as far as it goes, although leaving other major defects of the Ashkenazic pronunciation of Hebrew uncorrected.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 113 centuries ago. D. M. Weil, who has both a doctoral degree and the title of rabbi, was emboldened to dig for the elusive treasure. His findings are imparted in six highly technical chapters in English (some of them very long), with a substantial summary in modem Hebrew. That he takes pride in his achievement is understandable; but he has an unusual notion of intellectual property. On the reverse of the title page we read with surprise, not a brief routine statement of copyright but this: "Anyone who intends to use the method of reconstruction in this work or the reconstruction itself must submit a written request to the author (Hageonim St 2, Jerusalem 92473) and receive his written approval before publication in any manner. The author is entitled to refuse approval without explanation. Every use of this method of reconstruction or of the reconstruction itself must be accompanied by the author's approval." He is liable to be disappointed, not by the large number of scholars who defy or ignore the attempt to control their use of his research, but by the utter paucity of readers able to follow it at all. That is due, for the most part, to a forbiddingly abstract presentation, which may be justified in principle by the logic of the author's project but demands too much of his readers, expecting them to concentrate upon page after page without any actual quotation of biblical verses, or even a chapter-and-verse reference. Instead Weil refers continually to pertinent pages in several authoritative books by M. Breuer on biblical accents, and-when necessary-explains how he and Breuer disagree. Thus he virtually, though of course not deliberately, warns us that we can hardly grasp his argument unless we look up what Breuer has said on this point--or happen to know about it otherwise. My own experience with Weil's book, but without access to Breuer's, was rewarding well into chapter 3, entitled "The Global Symmetric Model," as long as I could draw on stored-up knowledge of the accents from my past research. But I got bogged down in musicological distinctions which I could not correlate with anything familiar to me. Weil's expertise in music would have profited this less expert reader, had it been communicated adequately. He devotes the first four chapters to a step-by-step reconstruction of the tones that correspond to the written accents of the Tiberias Masoretes. I accept as a theoretical postulate his notes from high F (top line of the treble clef) down to low F but ending back on low G, with further extensions to high G and low D. (Neither B nor E is included in this scale.) I am not convinced, however, that these eight tones from high G to low D--rather than nine or seven or some other number-will best account for the data.</page><page sequence="3">114 BOOK REVIEWS Moreover, my confidence in Weil's grand scheme is diminished by some paradoxical twists as well as mere blunders-forgivable in such an intricate subject but still disconcerting. As I struggled to understand this: Formally expressed: (V a S) (3 a E S) (a' P a U aP a'). For instance, if a is sofpasuq, then a' may be taken as tippeha, zaqef or segol. For either one of these, one has a' P a (p. 54) the misstatement that : can constitute a pair (as : and : 'can indeed) sapped my motivation. For the author ought to have known that the pair of accents in not : but ^ which governs the first half of a verse; ^ never occurs in the second half, which : , closes. The rule about " was cogently stated by William Wickes in English over a hundred years ago,2 besides earlier scholars who wrote in other languages. Weil's greatest paradox lies within his classification of certain accents as leaders and the rest as suspenses; only a leader may form a pair with the next accent. Yet he classes : , as a leader (but ^ as a suspense, pp. 69-78). This is bound to incur the objection that : ends every verse and accordingly it never links its word to the ensuing word, while. does lead right into: , in some short verses, such as These [were] the stages of the sons of Israel by their units; and they moved [from place to place] (Numb. 10:28, cf. Gen. 1:3). Weil supports the odd lumping of , with the leaders by an impressive collateral argument, that the servant or conjunctive , (a'rn) is used only before leaders: (xnmu) , (MM) J. (-19n) I.(,a)I, and so it stands to reason that the collection ' has some affinity to the other four , collocations: "A leader has always merka' as servant and is never served by munah. A suspense has always munah as servant and it is never served by merka'. This rule holds for all disjunctives of classes II and III of Table 3.5" (p. 72). That table, however, leaves out one leader x7piT, which does not conform to Weil's rule. Another table of accents (p. 45) does list" 2.

("and he blessed them," Gen. 1:28). Some additional factor is involved in the occurrence of certain conjunc- tives in the very same word as a disjunctive but on an earlier syllable, and also in the susceptibility of but not , to be placed on two successive words (as in i" ' 1W t "which we shall give back to him," 1 Sam. 6:4). How the differences in distribution between and are related to the differences in their tonality--which is Weil's paramount concern-remains to be discovered.3 He expressly leaves for a later time the accent system of the poetic books-Psalms, Job, and Prophets (pp. 11, 299-300). It has, among other things, complex rules for both , and : of which the latter is absolutely excluded from the system of the twenty-one prose books. At the end of chapter 2, "An Overview of the Reconstruction," he says, that "the impatient reader who wishes to enrich his or her study of the theoretical discussion with some preliminary concrete facts may wish first to skip to chapter 5-Confirmation by Practice-before continuing with chapter 3." I found, however, after giving up on the latter part of chapter 3, that I could not pick up the thread in chapter 5, or at any other point. I did read with profit several scattered paragraphs of chapter 6, "Evaluation and Extensions," where Weil develops some fascinating speculations. He argues quite plausibly that the Masoretic chant itself goes back to the Second Temple, although the written notation belongs to medieval Tiberias. He goes on to suggest that so elaborate a chant was not, in origin, purely vocal but accompanied by musical instruments. At the same time he acknowledges that none of the texts which mention the liturgical music of the Levite performers connect it with the reading of the Torah (p. 312). I can more readily imagine the Levites playing along as they sang the Psalms. Oriented as he is toward musicology, Weil does not get into the accents as a visually coherent and intricate system. Some facets of it would dovetail well with details of his own classification; e.g., the marks which bend toward the left are mostly the ones that he designates as leaders.4 I have dwelt upon the shortcomings of this book because they thwarted 3. In a brief and quite inadequate footnote (p. 134) Weil remarks, "The substitution merka' -- munah before zarqa' (B[reuer] 3.13) falls under the same heading [as the substitution of' for" when one or more unstressed vowels intervene, and for when two or more unstressed vowels intervene]." 4.
