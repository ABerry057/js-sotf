<plain_text><page sequence="1">A SOCIOLOGICAL PORTRAIT OF GERMAN JEWISH IMMIGRANTS IN BOSTON: 1845-1861' by STEPHEN G. MOSTOV Brandeis University In the growing literature on the socioeconomic characteristics of the constituent immigrant groups of America's cities during the mid-nineteenth century,2 German Jews have been sadly neglected.3 The reasons are primari- ly practical ones. Because "Jewish" or "Hebrew" was neither a census nor immigration category during this period, German Jews are difficult to iden- 1. I wish to thank Kathleen Neils Conzen, Professor of History, University of Chicago, who first motivated me to undertake this study and without whose patient guidance and in- sightful editing it could not have been written. I am also grateful to Michael P. Conzen, Profes- sor of Geography, University of Chicago, for drawing the map which appears in this article and to Professors Leon A. Jick and Marshall Sklare. 2. The reader is referred to Dean Esslinger, Immigrants and the City: Ethnicity and Mobility in a Nineteenth-Century Midwestern Community (Port Washington, N.Y., 1975), chap. I and nn., for a succinct summary. The only work, to my knowledge, which includes a separate analysis of Jewish social and economic mobility is Stephan Thernstrom's The Other Bostonians: Poverty and Progress in the American Metropolis 1880-1970 (Cambridge, Mass., 1973), pp. 145-75. Even that, however, is a cursory analysis, based as it is on three samples, the largest of which included only thirty-eight individuals. 3. I am fully aware of the current debate within the field of American Jewish history over the correct nomenclature for the estimated 225,000 Jewish immigrants who arrived in the 121</page><page sequence="2">STEPHEN (.

Even those specifically interested in American Jewish history have seldom gone beyond cursory analyses of the socioeconomic characteristics of the German Jews, reflecting both the traditional emphasis in Jewish communal histories on institutions and their leaders, and the focusing of attention in such social histories as do exist on the larger and seemingly more significant Eastern European Jewish immigration beginning in the 1880s.5 There is no dearth of scholarly evidence that American Jews are a dis- tinctive group socially and economically, as well as religiously and cultural- ly.6 That American Jews' patterns of geographical and occupational dis- tribution, and social and economic status, are unique among the nation's ethnic groups is an assumption nearly universally shared and acted upon by intellectuals, politicians, journalists, and the general public alike. The rele- vant question for social historians is how the contemporary sociological pat- terns of American Jews have evolved, and why they are unique in com- parison to those of other American ethnic groups. There are many possible explanations for American Jewish excep- tionalism.7 Some emphasize the nature of the Jewish historical experience in Europe, in which adaptability to radically new environments was an imperative virtue, and which funneled Jews into mercantile pursuits. Others United States between 1815 and 1880, before the mass immigration of Eastern European Jews began. Since, as is shown in this study, the vast majority came from areas incorporated in Ger- many after 1871, and were German speaking, for convenience and clarity's sake they are refer- red to in this study as "German" Jews, with the understanding that some emigrated from other neighboring areas of Western, Central, and Eastern Europe. For a full discussion of this issue see Rudolf Glanz, "The 'Bayer' and the 'Pollack' in America," Jewish Social Studies (hereafter cited as JSS) 17 (1955): 27-42, reprinted in idem, Studies in Judaica Americana (New York, 1970), pp. 187-202. 4. For a discussion of this problem, which is an ongoing one for demographers and sociologists, see Sidney Goldstein and Calvin Goldscheider, Jewish Americans: Three Genera- tions in a Jewish Community (Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1968), pp. 14-17. Because of the high premium placed on separation of church and state, a question on religion has never appeared in a decennial U.S. census. United States immigration records, however, included the classifica- tion "Hebrews" between 1899 and 1943. 5. Among the most notable exceptions are the numerous articles by Rudolf Glanz, col- lected in Studies in Judaica Americana, and the most recent studies, listed below in note 9. 6. Cf., for instance, Marshall Sklare, America's Jews (New York, 1971), pp. 37-72 and idem, ed., The Jew in American Society (New York, 1974), pp. 93-162, and bibliography, pp. 388-97. 7.

The relative merits of the various explanations aside, one still confronts the as yet unanswered historical question of precisely what the earliest American Jewish social and economic patterns were, and at what point the present patterns emerged. The true character of German Jewish mobility has too often been obscured by a facile invoking of the rags to riches myth. Precise analysis has frequent- ly been sacrificed for apologetic, literary, and polemical ends.8 The few recently completed Jewish communal studies which do include broad-based analysis suggest that the fixation of old with the relatively few German Jews who amassed great fortunes and patronized local Jewish institutions has overshadowed the equally significant, if more mundane, mobility patterns of the German Jewish masses.9 It is time for historians and sociologists to move beyond stereotypic and superficial descriptions of early Jewish mobility, and to begin generating a body of empirically verifiable data. This essay is an attempt, through a case study of Boston Jewry between 1845 and 1861, to go back to the beginnings of significant Jewish immigra- tion to the United States, in order to reconstruct as precisely as possible a demographic and sociological portrait of ordinary first generation German Jewish immigrants. It is hoped that such a portrait, once established, will provide a sound basis for future research into the historical dynamics of American Jewish mobility. The specific chronological limits of the study ex- 8. In the early part of this century German Jewish spokesmen were eager to differentiate themselves in the eyes of the general public from the "new" immigrants from Poland and Russia-a bias which colored their descriptions of German Jewish mobility. For later historians the tendency to describe Jewish communal dissension as a by-product of German- Eastern European rivalry, with class overtones, has perpetuated the usefulness of a stereotypic view of German Jewish mobility. For the most recent discussion of this problem see Oscar Handlin, "A Twenty Year Retrospect of American Jewish Historiography," American Jewish Historical Quarterly (hereafter cited as AJHQ) 65 (1976): 295-301. Stephen Birmingham's best selling Our Crowd: The Great Jewish Families of New York (New York, 1967) has served once more to popularize the mythic image of old. 9.

MOSTOV tend from the beginnings of significant Jewish settlement in Boston through the end of the community's formative period and the eve of the dislocations of the Civil War. Singling out Boston's German Jews for special analysis at first seems an unlikely choice, inasmuch as German Jewish immigration is commonly associated with New York, Philadelphia and the river cities of the Midwest. However, Boston's public data for this period are intact and accessible, and the several published social histories of Boston greatly facilitate comparison of Boston's Jews with other ethnic groups and with the city's population as a whole.'0 Furthermore, since Jews did not emigrate directly to Boston, the com- munity there developed at roughly the same time and same rate as those in the interior cities. Solid evidence can be adduced that Boston's mid- nineteenth century Jewish community was, in fact, quite typical of German Jewish communities dispersed throughout the United States. THE JEWISH BACKGROUND Jews arrived in New York City (then New Amsterdam) as early as 1654, but as late as 1820 the Jewish population of the United States was fewer than 3,000 in a total population of 9.6 million." The first Jews to arrive were predominantly of Dutch, Spanish, and Portuguese descent. Because they were primarily engaged in overseas commerce they tended to settle in the colonies' most active ports, Boston excluded. In 1790 the nation's only Jewish congregations were located in Newport (Rhode Island), New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Charleston and Savannah. By 1820 two-thirds of the nation's Jews resided in but four locations: Charleston, New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond.'2 Thus, at a time when the nation's popula- tion was overwhelmingly rural and agrarian, the incipient American Jewish community was urban and commercially oriented. 10.

Estimating the Jewish population in the United States for any period is a hazardous proposition, and especially so for the nineteenth century. For the most precise estimates of the number of Jews enumerated in the federal censuses of 1790 and 1820, and a discussion of the problems involved, cf. Ira Rosenwaike, "An Estimate and Analysis of the Jewish Population of the United States in 1790," AJHQ 50 (1960): 23-35 and idem, "The Jewish Population of the United States as Estimated from the Census of 1820," AJHQ 53 (1963): 131-49. 12.

Subsequent Jewish immigration to the United States was almost exclusively of Central and Eastern European origin. Sustained Jewish immigration began after 1830, peaked in the 1850s and again in the 1870s, and rose to unprecedented levels in the 1880s which were maintained through 1914. Between 1845 and 1860, the period under consideration, the Jewish population grew from roughly 40,000 to 150,000. 3 The established pattern of Jewish concentration in a few large port cities continued until the large increase in immigration during the late 1840s and 1850s. By 1840 the nation's largest Jewish community was in New York City, where consistently one-fourth to one-half of the nation's total Jewish population has resided down to the present. The number of Jews in New York rose from approximately 15,000 in 1847 to 40,000 in 1860 and 80,000 in 1880.14 The only other American cities with sizable numbers of Jews were Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, New Orleans and Cincinnati. The skewed distribution of the nation's Jews as late as 1840 seems to have been a function of shipping routes from German port cities, religious necessity, and commerical opportunities. Most Jews, as noted below, began as peddlers, petty merchants, tailors, or artisans, and were neither by training nor in- clination interested in agrarian or other rural-based pursuits. The propen- sity of Jewish immigrants to settle in commercial centers became so ax- iomatic in the popular mind that the arrival of Jewish peddlers and small businessmen in a developing outpost came to be seen as an auspicious sign of potential commercial growth.'5 The large increase in the number of Jews arriving after 1845, as well as the rapid growth of cities and rural settlements in the Midwest and West, led to a rapid dispersal of the nation's Jewish population, and the establishment of Jewish communities in areas of secondary settlement. The growth of Boston's Jewish community from literally a handful in 1840 to some 20 13. There are simply no reliable estimates for this period. In the standard secondary sources one or another person's educated guess serves as the basis for subsequent ones. The figure of 40,000 is an extrapolation between an estimate of 6,000 made by Isaac Harby of Charleston, S.C. in 1826 (see S. Gilman, North American Review, July 1826), and a contemporary estimate of 49,000 in 1845, which seems too high (see Cincinnati Miscellany [1845; reprint ed., New York, 1971], p. 171). The 150,000 figure is an estimate inferred in the Occident and American Jewish Advocate (Philadelphia), 12 (1856): 413. 14. Encyclopedia Judaica (hereafter cited as EJ), s.v. "New York City," col. 1070. 15. Cf.

MOSTOV families in 1860 mirrors simultaneous growth in such cities as Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee, St. Louis and San Francisco.16 In addition to these large cities Jews were now increasingly found in smaller cities, and even towns and villages where Jewish run general stores often served as a base for Jewish peddling in rural and frontier areas.17 Isaac Leeser, the editor of the Occident and American Jewish Advocate, a Jewish monthly (weekly after 1859) published in Philadelphia, documented this trend in 1856 when he assiduously compiled a list of all known Jewish congregations in the nation as of that year-a congregation containing a minimum of ten men. He conservatively estimated there to be 118 congregations nationally, 86 of them outside of the Eastern Seaboard, and scattered in 24 states. Significantly, he prefaced this list with the remark that "it is but a few years ago that one could count on his fingers the cities where Israelites had formed separate communities."'1 That the exodus of German Jews to the United States was an integral part of the general German emigration is indicated by the similar emigration curves for both groups between 1820 and 1880. General German emigration was slight before 1830, moderate through 1845, and high during the 1850s and 1870s-thus paralleling the figures for Jews. Precisely what motivated Jewish and non-Jewish Germans alike to set out for America is a com- plicated matter in which economic, technological, political, and psy- chological factors all played a part. Between 1830 and 1845 in Germany the rural lower middle class, which included the majority of German Jews at this time, faced a severe crisis caused by a growth of population without a corresponding growth of economic bases, and by the increased cos- mopolitanization and liberalization of the economy. As local tariffs were abolished, transportation improved, and factories established, rural artisans and traders were faced with an ever shrinking market. With prospects dim- 16. Chicago's Jewish community grew from 20 families in 1840 to 1,500 persons in 1860 (EJ, s.v. "Chicago," cols. 410-11); Milwaukee from 47 families in 1845 to 200 in 1860 (Louis Swichkow and Lloyd Gartner, The History of the Jews in Milwaukee [Philadelphia, 1963], chap. 1); Detroit from 60 persons in 1850 to 200 in 1860 (Rockaway, "Jews of Detroit," pp. 1-38); St. Louis from less than 100 persons in 1840 to 600-700 persons in 1860 (EJ, s.v. "St. Louis," cols. 662-63); and San Francisco's from none in 1840 to 2,500-5,000 in 1860 (Bernstein, "Jews in San Francisco," p. 70). 17. There is a large body of literature on Jewish peddling, but unfortunately most of it is ex- cessively anecdotal. For the most analytic article see Glanz, "Notes on Early Jewish Peddling in America," JSS 7 (1945): 119-36, reprinted in Judaica Americana, pp. 104-21. 18. Occident 12 (1856): 411-13. Leeser's figures are credible both because of his high caliber of reporting and his extensive travel for the sole purpose of visiting Jewish communities. 126</page><page sequence="7">IMMIGRANTS IN BOSTON ming, young men seeking to establish themselves faced the alternatives of becoming proletarianized, leaving for urban centers, or emigrating to a place where, it was hoped, traditional patterns could be maintained.'9 In addition to general factors encouraging emigration, German Jews had their own special motives for leaving. In a number of the German prin- cipalities, Jews were subject to special restrictions and taxes which further aggravated their plight and, in several instances, led to a mass exodus of all young couples from a given village. In Bavaria, a major source of Jewish emigration, the number of Jewish inhabitants in each district was controlled by linking marriages to the number of deaths and selectively granting citizenship. As times grew harder for everyone, there was less inclination among young Jews to attempt to evade regulations and taxes through bribery or deceit. Rather, those who were willing and able emigrated, either for the cities or abroad. The end result, according to the contemporary German Jewish press, was that "in many a place out of a Jewish population of 30-40 families, 15-20 people have emigrated, mainly the young and employable."20 Emigration is by nature selective, but when it entails crossing an ocean and settling in a totally foreign and frontier environment, it is especially so. In the case of German Jews the most urbane and well educated, the most religious, and the wealthiest were not likely to trek to America, since there was little to lure them there. That those who did come were dispropor- tionately young, poor (but not indigent), provincial and poorly educated, and that economic security rather than adventure or personal transforma- tion was their primary goal was bound to affect their patterns of social ad- justment once they arrived. THE ARRIVAL OF JEWS IN BOSTON There was never more than a sprinkling of Jewish families in Boston, or in all of New England for that matter, before the 1840s. Only in Newport, where the stately eighteenth-century Touro Synagogue still stands, had there been a flourishing, albeit ephemeral, Jewish community prior to that decade.2' Only an occasional itinerant appeared in Boston, and the few who 19.

The Touro Synagogue was 127</page><page sequence="8">STEPHEN G. MOSTOV actually settled assimilated into the general population.22 Why Boston and the rest of New England remained virtually Judenrein for so long is a matter of speculation. During the Colonial period religious intolerance was no doubt a major factor, but for the Early National period one must look for more specific reasons, given the virtual absence of all foreign born im- migrants, other than Englishmen and Irishmen, in Boston as late as 1860.23 Oscar Handlin explains Boston's peculiar lack of immigrants as a product of the city's stagnant economy and rigid social structure. He claims that only a group such as the Irish, who emigrated directly to Boston and, upon arrival, "could not go elsewhere because poverty deprived them of the means, and despondence of the desire," would have settled in large numbers.24 For more mobile and ambitious immigrants, Handlin asserts, "as against the promise of the broad fields and the new cities of the west and south, Boston offered few opportunities to those who lacked the twin advantages of birth and capital."25 Closer analysis reveals that Handlin's explanation is not definitive. Despite Boston's relatively low rate of population growth in the early nineteenth century and its loss of shipping preeminence to New York and New Orleans, the city remained the nation's fourth largest (after New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore), with a diversified and dynamic local economy. The basic industries of shipbuilding, textiles, boot and shoe manufacture, leather, printing, brick and glassmaking, and ironworks, which in 1880 accounted for one-half of the state's $150 million annual in- dustrial product, had a continuous history in Boston from the Colonial period.26 By 1840 there were already more than five industries annually producing one-half million dollars worth of goods or more, and another dozen industries producing over $100,000 worth, with a total estimated in- dustrial product of $30 million.27 These statistics suggest that factors more dedicated in 1763, but immediately following the Revolutionary War the Jewish community, like the town itself, virtually disappeared. 22. Rosenwaike, "1790," pp. 24-25; "1820," pp. 141-42. 23. Cf. Handlin, Boston's Immigrants, tables 6-9, pp. 242-46; Knights, Plain People, table 3:2, p. 36. As late as 1850 there were less than 1,800 Germans out of a total population of 137,000, an equal number of Scots, and even fewer Scandinavians. Knights reports that a mere 2 percent of his 1840 sample were born in continental Europe, and only 5 percent as late as 1860. 24. Handlin, Boston's Immigrants, p. 37. 25. Ibid., p. 12. 26.

Handlin may have in part based his conclusions on uncritical ac- 128</page><page sequence="9">IMMIGRANTS IN BOSTON complex than simple lack of economic opportunity must have been at the root of the city's unique ethnic mix. There may have been instead a variety of both rational and incidental reasons, among which shipping routes, natural paths of migration from other port cities, perceived social or religious intimidation, and "frontier fever" would have to be included. A permanent minyan, the ten man minimum required by Jewish tradi- tion to establish a congregation, could be gathered in Boston for the first time in the fall of 1842.28 By 1843 Jews had designated a room in a co- religionist's house as a place for regular prayer, and had organized the Chevra Ahabas Achim (Society of Brotherly Love), which served as a mutual aid and burial society.29 Their first request for exclusive use of a 100 square foot corner of the East Boston City Cemetery having been denied, in July of 1844 the Boston City Council approved the local Jews' second peti- tion for the right to purchase a separate plot of land to be used as a burial ground.30 The Commonwealth granted its first charter of incorporation to a Jewish congregation to the members of Ohabei Shalom in 1845, but a syn- agogue building was not constructed until 1852. Public notice of the nascent community was first evidenced in a letter to the Boston Mercantile Journal on September 23, 1844, in which a Reverend Wells, having attended the Jewish "synagogue," remarked that it was "not a comfortable or decent place for the performance of the service which thousands of years ago swelled through the arches of Solomon's Temple." He further noted that some forty men were in attendance.3' Why Jewish immigrants suddenly began filtering into Boston in the 1840s is explainable in part by a factor previously alluded to, namely, the sheer increase in the number of Jews entering the country. The heightened ceptance of the State Industrial Censuses of 1837 and 1845 which list Suffolk County's in- dustrial product as only $10 million and $13.8 million respectively. Wright and Wadlin, however, directors of the State Bureau of Statistics in 1880, convincingly argue that these early censuses were "exceedingly unsatisfactory, both from many omissions of important industries and methods" (p. 90). The figures cited here are their estimates of the correct totals. 28. Albert Ehrenfried, A Chronicle of Boston Jewry (Boston, 1963),pp. 332-37. 29. Besides providing emergency financial aid, the Chevra and its successor, the Chevra Gemiloth Chesed (free loan society) founded in 1853, also provided for the visiting and as- sisting of the sick, guaranteed a proper burial, and even provided families with funds for the seven day period of mourning. See "Minutebook of the Chevra Gemiloth Chesed," deposited in the American Jewish Archives, Cincinnati, Ohio. 30. Ehrenfried, Chronicle, pp. 338-39. Subsequently Congregation Ohabei Shalom purchased a 10,000 sq. ft. lot on the corners of Byron and Homer Sts. for $200, which was paid for by assessing members $5 each. 31. Ibid., pp. 337-38. 129</page><page sequence="10">STEPHEN G. MOSTOV commercial opportunities in the city following the arrival of Boston's Irish may have been another factor. An inordinate number of the Irish peasants fleeing the famine and tyrannical landlords of their homeland ended up in Boston. A city whose entire population in 1840 was 85,000, received by 1850 over 35,000 Irishmen, and by 1855 more than 50,000-about 30 percent of Boston's total population in that year. The abundant supply of cheap labor which the unskilled and exploited Irishmen provided was a boon to Boston's manufacturers, who had long bemoaned the city's shortage of laborers and relatively high wages.32 But the concentration of Irishmen in Boston's com- pact neighborhoods must have meant also lucrative opportunities for those, like the Jewish immigrants, who specialized in providing consumer goods and services. Also contributing to increased commercial activity in Boston at mid-century were the eight railroad lines extending from the city by 1860, creating a new trading area extending as far west as the Berkshires and north to the Merrimac Valley, with Boston as its hub.33 One further attraction of Boston for Jews during this period, given the large number trained as tailors, must have been the developing ready made clothing industry, which grew appreciably in Boston in the decades following its inception by John Simmons in the early thirties. The invention of sewing machines by Elias Howe in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1846 and I. M. Singer in Boston in 1850 ensured an ever increasing demand for tailors, of whom over 1,500 were locally employed by 1850.34 The precise nature of Boston's attraction to Jewish immigrants in the 1850s is further clarified by an analysis of the characteristics of those who chose to settle there. A DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE Recounting in October 1851 his recent visit to the New England states, Isaac Leeser remarked that "we think that there are at least 120 [Jewish] families in Boston, who though mostly in moderate circumstances, are all 32. Wright and Wadlin, Memorial History, 4: 80. That Boston's manufacturers profited im- mensely from the Irish influx is evidenced in the doubling of the city's annual industrial product to $64 million between 1840 and 1860: see ibid., p. 93. 33.

There is still some disagreement among scholars as to whether tailoring was a skill Jewish immigrants brought with them, or whether they acquired it only after arriving in the United States. 130</page><page sequence="11">IMMIGRANTS IN BOSTON able to support themselves."35 Both Leeser's estimate and the earlier obser- vation of Reverend Wells (a minimum of 40 families in 1844) are in line with the estimates of Boston's Jewish population derived from the sample data. Forty-three sample members are known to have already been in Boston in 1845, and their numbers increased to 81 in 1850, 102 in 1855, and 118 in 1861 (see table 1). If one extrapolates the 2 to 3 ratio of sample members to the estimated total of Jewish families in 1851 to 1861, then there were over 180 Jewish families in Boston by that year.36 The stream of Jewish im- migrants into the city was fairly constant throughout the period under con- sideration, excepting a slight decrease in the late 1850s (see table 1).37 TABLE 1 YEAR SAMPLE MEMBERS ARRIVED IN BOSTONa Year(s) Number Arriving %b 1840-1849 72 29 1850-1854 63 26 1855-1859 47 19 1860-1861 21 9 Unknown 43 17 Total 247 100 Number in Boston 1845 43 1850 81 1853 79 1855 102 1858 101 1861 118 a See note 37 for data limitations. b Equals the percent of total number arriving 1840-1861. 35.

My figures on year of arrival are unfortunately subject to a number of qualifications. The most precise way to gauge when individuals arrived is to consult passenger lists-a laborious task I have yet to undertake. Since a number of Boston's Jews arrived via New York, lists for both Boston and New York would have to be checked. My calculations were based first of all on census data, which list the state in which all members of the family were born. Since most families had children every two years or so, one seemingly gets a good idea of how long they had been in Massachusetts. There is no way, obviously, of determining whether a family first lived somewhere in Massachusetts outside of Boston. For those not found in the censuses I used the first year they were found in the tax assessment lists or city directories. In these cases 131</page><page sequence="12">STEPHEN G. MOSTOV The sources employed in collecting the sample data referred to include manuscript censuses, city directories, and tax assessment lists. The names of persons identified as Jewish-meaning any adult male who would have identified himself as such or would have been so identified by others-were first sought independently of these sources.38 A core of 122 verified Jewish individuals was compiled from available primary and secondary sources. These included periodicals, two lists of persons contributing money to Palestinian emissaries (meshullahim) and the names previously culled from communal records and personal recollections by Dr. Albert Ehrenfried, a long time Boston resident, in a privately published study (see table 2).39 The core members were subsequently traced in the Boston city directories of 1845 to 1861 in order to obtain addresses and occupations, and then in the manuscript federal censuses of 1850 and 1860, the state census of 1855, and city tax assessment lists of 1850, 1855, and 1860.

In the process of tracing names through the various sources an ad- ditional 125 persons presumed to be Jewish were added to the sample, based upon strict criteria. Fourteen were relatives of sample members-that is, they had the same surname and same address as a verified member. Another seventy-one of those added had the same surname as a verified member and a pentateuchal first name, provided the surname was judged to be a characteristically German Jewish one.40 Others added had either distinctive- ly Jewish first names or surnames (for example, "Moishe," "Yitzhak," "Shlomo," "Levi," "Cohen") and lived at the same address as known Jews. Inevitably the sample data contain built-in biases. Jews active in com- munal affairs, and therefore possibly of higher status, were the most likely to be included. Similarly, city directories and censuses are known to have ex- cluded a disproportionate number of unemployed and transient persons.41 40. Cf. Glanz, "German Jewish Names in America," JSS 23 (1961): 143-69, reprinted in Judaica Americana, pp. 278-89. Glanz notes the distinctiveness of Jewish-German as opposed to German surnames. Specifically, -heimer and -steiner endings referred to Jews almost without exception, as did scenic-geographical endings such as -feld, -thal(er), -baum, -berg, -wasser, -dorf. 41. Cf. Knights, Plain People, pp. 127-47; Thernstrom, Bostonians, pp. 265-88. Peddlers were especially likely to be underenumerated because they were self-employed, and likely to be out of town at the time of enumeration. That a number of Jews were being overlooked is evidenced by the eight sample members found in censuses or assessments but not city direc- tories, and by the thirty-one who appeared only intermittently in the city directories. 133</page><page sequence="14">STEPHEN G. MOSTOV Finally, since the public records were not searched systematically for "infer- red" Jews, those who were included were likely to resemble, and therefore possibly unfairly reinforce, the core sample. It is doubtful if such biases can be feasibly eliminated. Mitigating these is the fact that the sample is meant to be representative of those Jews likely to transmit their identity to subse- quent generations. The fact that information was gleaned on some 220 men and their families in a decade in which, by all estimates, there were never more than 200 Jewish families in Boston at one time, seems to suggest that the sample is indeed representative of a large segment of the antebellum Boston Jewish community.42 Determining the precise European origins of Boston's Jews is a difficult task given the vagueness of census descriptions. Nonetheless the sample data provide some valuable insights. Jewish immigrants arriving in Boston between 1845 and 1861 were not a socially and culturally homogeneous group. The major distinction among them was between those from Southwest Germany (Baden and Bavaria), and those from Posen, Polish Prussia, and other parts of Northeast Germany. By 1860 a preponderant number of Boston's Jews apparently came from the northeast German region (see table 4).43 Although both the "Bayers" and "Polishers" lived in the same general neighborhood and both groups were German speaking, cultural and social differences very early led to communal factionalism. Only two years after the dedication of an expensive synagogue in 1852, most of the Bavarian Jewish families seceded and formed what eventually became Temple Israel. They soon built their own structure, established their own 42. The issue of methodological purity in sample selection is a controversial one. However, I agree with the argument recently set forth by Thernstrom, that in dealing with "the complex- ity and messiness that we inevitably encounter when we venture into territory not already well- charted by previous researchers," tolerance for reasonable methodological improvisation is a necessity (Historical Methods Newsletter 7 [1975]: 112ff.). 43. The percentage of sample members from Northeast Germany is an educated guess. What later became the nation-state of Poland was at the time divided between Prussia, Russia, and Austria. That "Polish" Jews of the mid-nineteenth century were in fact mostly from Prus- sia is evidenced by the fact that they were German speaking and were commonly referred to by Bavarian Jews as "hinter Berliners." Cf. Glanz, "'Bayer' and the 'Pollack,'" p. 189. Some of the "Prussians" may have been from the Rhineland (West German) area, but it is doubtful if this applies to very many. Because Bavarian Jews were likely to identify themselves as such, it may also be assumed that many of those identifying themselves as "German" were from Eastern Prussia. Cf. ibid., where Glanz states, "The place of origin listed next to the names of East European Jews is shown as Germany or Prussia, as well as Austria, Poland, or Russia." He estimates that "at least a third" of America's Jews were of Eastern European origin by 1880 (ibid.). 134</page><page sequence="15">IMMIGRANTS IN BOSTON 135 school, and unsuccessfully sued for legal rights to the name and property of the original congregation. The stated reason for the rift was the Bavarians' resentment of the preponderance of "Polish Jews, whose ceremonies are somewhat different," in the original congregation.44 By 1858 a third group, consisting chiefly of persons from Posen, had also broken away and es- tablished Congregation Mishkan Israel. Besides its effect on the internal cohesion of the Jewish community, the relatively large number of German Jews from the Eastern provinces undoubtedly also inhibited social and cultural interaction between Jewish and other Germans in Boston, given the very low proportion of all German emigrants coming from that region (see table 4).

MOSTOV Analysis of the age distribution, marital status, and family size of Boston's Jews reaffirms the selective nature of the Jewish immigration, and reflects the tempo of their demographic integration into the community as a whole. The immigrant character of Boston's Jewish community as of 1850 was clearly reflected in its skewed age structure. Persons over forty were a distinct minority of the adult Jewish population, while fully 40 percent of the adults were age thirty or under (see table 5). By contrast, the median age of Boston's entire adult population in 1850 was thirty-seven. By 1860, Boston's Jewish community had largely shed the immigrant character of its age structure, as reflected in the rise of the median age to thirty-seven and a more normal proportion of old persons (see table 5).

Data for specific age categories are not available. The sample data affirm that Jews emigrating to Boston were not only disproportionately young, but also tended to bring few dependents with them. Typically, a young married couple would settle in the city and then religious practices and liturgy, but more general cultural and social factors were also clearly in- volved. 136</page><page sequence="17">IMMIGRANTS IN BOSTON immediately begin raising a large family.45 Almost two-thirds of the Jewish couples had no foreign-born children, but by 1860 these same couples already had an average of 3.8 children each with 70 percent of them still of prime child-bearing age. Over one-fourth of these families already had at least 6 children in that year (see table 6). Besides the young married couples, there were also a sizable number of young single Jewish men in Boston, and a lesser number of single women. Commonly, one or two brothers settled in the city and were joined in succeeding years by younger brothers. Single Jewish women, by contrast, tended to settle with older married couples rather than with sisters, often earning their board by serving as domestics.46 These demographic characteristics of the Jews settling in Boston between 1845 and 1861 provide a composite picture of a small but growing community of young married couples and single brothers, the majority of whom were from either Southwest or Northeast Germany, and most of whom were in the process of raising large families.

This was determined by noting where children and wives were born. With but three ex- ceptions both spouses were born in the same place, indicating that the majority immigrated together or in close succession. There is, of course, the possibility that the couples met and mar- ried immediately after arriving, but this seems unlikely. Cf. Glanz, "'Bayer' and the 'Pollack,"' p. 190: "... brides were often taken along or sent for a little later." 46. That this was not unique to Boston Jewry is evidenced by the fact that 53 percent of the 151 women admitted to New York's "Jews' Hospital" in 1856 and 1858 reported their occupa- tion as "domestics."

Both this and the fact that most Jewish children were native born augured well for future economic and social mobility. Boston Jewry's residential, occupational, and wealth patterns, however, in- dicate that German Jews' foothold in American urban society was still quite precarious as of the mid-century. PHYSICAL ADJUSTMENT The German Jews' patterns of residential integration into Boston's urban environment provide a different perspective on their socioeconomic status and mobility. A necessary preface to such an analysis is a brief syn- opsis of Boston's unique topographical development prior to 1845. Pristine Boston had been a rough, hilly peninsula whose total land mass was barely one square mile. Practically an island, only a narrow isthmus connected it with the Roxbury Highlands to the southwest. The Back Bay area, which now connects Boston with the western suburbs of Brookline and Brighton, was at the time a mud flat, and much of the present shoreline to the northwest and southeast was swampland. Confined as it was, Boston's land early became expensive and scarce. As the population increased there was a continuing need to create new residential areas, either through simple out- ward extension by bridges, or through the infilling of shoreline and the level- ing of hills. By 1845, although the Back Bay was yet to be reclaimed, the city already had been greatly transformed physically. The compact and socially homogeneous town of 25,000 of 1800 had become a densely populated city of over 100,000. The creation of new neighborhoods, in most cases geographically distinct owing to unsynchronized street patterns and natural barriers, encouraged social segregation. The principal residential sections by this time were the well-to-do West End and Beacon Hill, the densely pop- ulated, predominantly Irish North End and Fort Hill, and the more sub- urban, middle class South End, South Boston, and East Boston (see map).47 Although non-Irish foreigners on the whole tended to be evenly dis- tributed among Boston's various neighborhoods during the 1850s, this was not the case with the city's Jewish population.48 Jews who arrived in Boston in the 1840s and early 1850s settled either in the South End or on certain 47.

By the late 1850s, however, the sample data indicate that nearly all the city's Jews were living within close proximity of each other in the South End (see table 7).

The part of town designated the "South End" has varied so greatly in Boston's history that any use of the term requires precise definition. In the nineteenth century, the South End designated the area between the Central Business District and the Neck-the isthmus connecting the peninsula with Roxbury. The South End "moved" as the business district expanded and the Neck was substantially widened. This process began in 1804 with the filling in of what is now Harrison Avenue and was completed in 1839 when the reclamation of seventy-five acres of mud flats created the South Cove area. As of 1840 the South End thus meant all of Boston south of Summer Street and the Common. Washington Street was the major artery connecting this area with the heart of the city (see map). What is presently called the South End, namely the area surrounding Columbus and Huntington Avenues, was filled in only in the 1870s.49 The specific part of the South End in which most arriving Jews settled was the area surrounding what is today Park Square. Its general boundaries were the Common and Summer Street on the north, the mud flats (Back Bay) on the west, the Neck (new South End) on the south, and Washington 49. Whitehill, Boston, chaps. 5 and 6. 140</page><page sequence="21">IMMIGRANTS IN BOSTON Street on the east. A lesser number settled in the adjacent South Cove area. Between 1845 and 1861, at any one time, two-thirds of the city's Jews, in contrast to only 17 percent of all city residents, lived in the "Park Square" area. As many as 85 percent lived in the South End, as compared to one- third generally (see table 7). The type of neighborhood Boston's Jews lived in provides a preliminary indication of their relative social and economic status within the community as a whole. Property values suggest that the South End of the 1850s was solidly middle class. Less than 10 percent of the 1,632 houses in the city valued at less than $1,000 in 1850 were located in the South End, but at the same time only 30 of the South End's 1,700 houses were valued at more than $20,000. Nearly all houses were in the $2,000 to $6,000 range typical of the city as a whole.50 Socially the South End never developed a special character, in contradistinction to the city's other neighborhoods. The well- to-do for whom the South Cove area was designed simply did not move there. This was originally due to the panic of 1837 and the abandonment of grandiose plans to locate new port facilities there and was later due to the sudden vogue of newly opened parts of the Back Bay. The specific neighborhood where the Jews concentrated was a relatively undesirable part of the South End because of its proximity to the railroad tracks and the mud flats (see map), but was too high priced and inaccessible for the city's poorest residents. Other than the Jews, the neighborhood seems to have been claimed by an odd assortment of artisans and small shopkeepers eager to escape the slums of the North End and Fort Hill but unable to live in the other more desirable suburbs. Handlin characterizes the Irish living there during this period as "largely intelligent tradespeople and mechanics." When the city began to expand once more following the es- tablishment of a horse-railroad line to Roxbury in 1855, the heart of the South End gravitated further away from the central city. The "Park Square" area rapidly declined, and within a decade became "a slum region of tene- ments and lodging houses."5' The fluid socioeconomic character of the South End in the 1840s and 1850s in a city of increasingly well-defined neighborhoods undoubtedly was 50.

Edward Stanwood, "Topography and Landmarks of the Last Hundred Years," in Memorial History, 4: 63. 141</page><page sequence="22">STEPHEN G. MOSTOV a major factor in the initial Jewish settlement. Also influencing this pattern may have been the very railroad depots discouraging others. Because, as we shall see, most of Boston's Jews were peddlers and merchants, access to the hinterland and to shipping facilities was undoubtedly important. This is par- ticularly evident in the North End, where Jews lived almost exclusively on the streets surrounding the depots of the Lowell and Maine railroads (see map). However, once the first Jewish synagogues were constructed on War- ren and Pleasant Streets, it was only natural for the "Park Square" area to remain the center of Jewish settlement. All known Jewish owned butcher shops were within a few blocks of the synagogues, so that availability of kosher meat as well as proximity to communal institutions and strong ethnic ties militated against the generally devout German Jews residing outside of the South End. Even this area of highest Jewish concentration, however, had relatively few Jewish residents. No more than 500 of the 10,428 inhabi- tants of the "Park Square" area in 1860 were Jewish. The dichotomy of social marginality and middle class stability and prosperity evident in Boston Jews' choice of neighborhood also characterized their residential mobility and persistence. Boston's Jews were a group constantly moving from one rented dwelling to another during the 1850s. A conservative estimate of their mobility ratio (that is, total moves/ total residence years) comes out to .301. This means that at least one-third of the Jewish population was changing residence in any given year (see table 8).52 There was no apparent system to Jewish residential movement. The majority of moves were within the same ward, often involving distances of a few blocks.53 Interward moves were equally aimless, with the same family or individual sometimes moving to several different wards over a number of years, only to end up back in the one in which they began. As of 1861, Boston's Jews apparently had not yet found a suitable area for second settle- ment. The instability and lack of roots reflected in the high rate of residential mobility was counterbalanced by an unusually high propensity to remain in Boston. In his study, P. Knights concluded that "the most mobile members of the population were the least persistent," and found that only 30 percent of Boston's foreign-born in 1850 remained ten years later.54 By contrast, 52. 1 say conservative because by using city directories, a maximum of one move per year can be detected. Cf. Knights, Plain People, pp. 60-64. 53. Based upon the sample data 57 percent of all moves were intraward and 43 percent in- terward. 54. Knights, Plain People, pp. 62-63. 142</page><page sequence="23">IMMIGRANTS IN BOSTON close to one-half of the Jewish persons known to have been in Boston in 1850 were still living there in 1860, a persistence ratio even higher than that of Boston's native born, indicating that their residential flux notwithstanding, Boston's Jews must have been reasonably optimistic about their prospects in their adopted city (see table 8).

ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT The most precise indicators of Boston Jews' economic status in the 1850s are their occupational distribution and relative wealth. The distinctiveness of the Jews among Boston's foreign born indicated by their residential con- centration and high persistence is further evidenced in both of these measures. Handlin stresses the extraordinary occupational diversity of Boston's working force as a whole. He specifically points to the German community, in which there was an average of only six persons per occupation, as in- 143</page><page sequence="24">144 STEPHEN G.

Besides their skewed occupational distribution, the types of occupations in which Jews concentrated also set them apart. Adopting with modifica- tions the socioeconomic classification scheme of Knights and Thernstrom, all occupations fall into one of seven categories: (1) menial labor, semi- skilled, and service, (2) petty merchants and peddlers, (3) artisans, (4) clerical and sales, (5) established merchants, (6) semiprofessional, and (7) professional.56 One-third of Boston's entire work force, and one-fifth of the city's employed Germans in 1850 worked in menial, semiskilled, and service jobs, in contradistinction to a mere 2 percent of the Jewish employed (see table 9). Conversely, Jews were four times as likely as other workers to be in an occupation falling in the petty merchant category, and twice as likely to be artisans.57 Even the apparent correlation between the high percentage of Jewish and German artisans is illusory. While most skilled Germans were bakers, shoemakers, and smiths, their Jewish counterparts were almost ex- clusively tailors, opticians and watchmakers, cigarmakers, and furriers. On the upper end of the occupational status continuum, Jews were dispropor- tionately few, with virtually no professionals. The wealth trends of Boston's German Jews, no less than their oc- cupational distribution, attest to their quintessential middle class economic status, despite their essentially immigrant character. For the purposes of this study Jews have been ranked economically according to their taxed wealth (that is, personal and real property), employing criteria developed by Knights. The poorest persons are considered to be those with less than $200, the lower middle class those with less than $1,000, the upper middle class those with up to $10,000, and the wealthiest those with even higher assets.58 56. Cf. Thernstrom, Other Bostonians, app. B, pp. 289-302, and Knights, Plain People, app. E, pp. 149-56. An established merchant is one whose taxed wealth exceeded $1,000. 57. The proportion appears to be somewhat less skewed in table 10, but one must correct for the percentage of Jews included in the "Germans" and "all workers" categories. 58. Cf. Knights, Plain People, pp. 89-93. Knights elaborates upon the limitations and pos- sible biases in tax assessment data. He concludes that wealth was probably understated, es- pecially in the case of individuals with extensive assets. 145</page><page sequence="26">STEPHEN G. MOSTOV The two middle class categories included less than one-third of the city's tax- payers, but from one-half to three-fourths of all Jews (see table 10). The poorest Jews tended to be tailors and peddlers, while the wealthiest were clothing, jewelry, and dry goods merchants. The majority were ensconced in the city's lower middle class, while virtually none, in accord with their oc- cupational distribution, had attained elite status.

Precisely how upwardly mobile Boston's first generation Jewish im- migrants were between 1845 and 1861 is difficult to gauge.59 Indications are that Jews were somewhat more likely than other persons in the city to have increased their taxable wealth during this decade, but a considerable number either suffered a decline in assets or stayed the same. The median in- crease over the ten year period, corrected for inflation, was about $850.60 Patterns of upward mobility for those who were succeeding were fairly con- sistent. Those who began as artisans, such as tailors and cutters, opticians and watchmakers, or cigarmakers would become merchants of these products, establishing clothing, jewelry, and tobacco stores. Petty merchants succeeded through gradually accruing greater inventories, while peddlers often, although not always, established small stores after they had lived in the community for a few years. In general, Jews rarely changed to 59. This is due to the fact that only a relatively small number of Jews were located in more than one tax assessment. 60. The estimated inflation during the decade was 13 percent. Cf. Knights, Plain People, p. 80. 146</page><page sequence="27">IMMIGRANTS IN BOSTON radically new occupations, a reflection both of their economic stability and the degree to which they were specialized. Thus, while on the average one in three sample members was moving every year, only one in twenty was changing to an unrelated occupation. In a pattern reminiscent of earlier observations on age distribution, the distribution of wealth became increasingly skewed as the Jewish community matured and came to more nearly approximate that of the city as a whole. In 1850 and 1855 nearly all tax assessments fell within the $200-$1,000 range, but by 1860 most were either in the $0-$200 or $1,000 plus category (see table 10). Many of those who had arrived in the late 1840s and early 1850s were prospering, while those just arriving were more likely than before to have virtually no money. The key variable in this increasing skewedness was years residing in Boston-more so than age (see table 11). Controlling for both among Boston's poorer and wealthier Jews in 1860, one discovers that while the poorer Jews had lived in Boston an average of only two years, the more prosperous had lived there an average of seven years. Prosperous Jews were somewhat older than their less prosperous co- religionists, but younger than most persons of the same wealth in the city as a whole-one further indication of the economic precociousness of the Jewish immigrants.

CONCLUSION The specific social, demographic, and economic characteristics of Boston Jewry between 1845 and 1861 depict a relatively small community of recent immigrants, at one and the same time cohesive yet heterogeneous, 147</page><page sequence="28">STEPHEN G. MOSTOV prospering yet insecure, and inconspicuous yet distinctive. Most were young adults, "in moderate circumstances," raising large families, yet "all able to support themselves," just as Isaac Leeser so aptly described them. That they were indeed a "community" is evident in their residential con- centration in a part of the South End, in their construction of two syn- agogues, in their founding of burial and fraternal societies, in their fund- raising efforts for Jews in distress both in Palestine and in other parts of the United States, in their issuance of proclamations, and in their establishment of their own schools.61 The factionalism within the community was rooted at first in cultural and later also in economic diversity. Already in the 1850s there was an adumbration of the tensions between Central and Eastern European Jews which were to become so acute a generation later with the beginning of the mass immigration. In its incipient stage, however, the dif- ferences were still largely between German Jews from two different regions. Occupationally, Boston's Jews recreated the pattern prevalent in Ger- many, as they became petty merchants and certain types of artisans. The poorest Jewish immigrants did not become laborers, as did so many of their Irish and German counterparts, but rather became peddlers and tailors. Successful Jews were neither professionals nor semiprofessionals, but rather manufacturers and store owners. Boston's Jews were economically comfort- able but not wealthy. By 1854 they could afford a $7,000 synagogue, but it was an unpretentious wooden structure on a small (thirty-five by seventy- five foot) lot.62 Jewish parents spent $24 a year to send their children to a Jewish parochial school; yet according to a despondent letter writer, many were "little able to bear the burden, being as they are, dependent on their daily toil for sustenance."63 Socially, one would expect Boston's Jews to have been too few and too residentially isolated to have been much noticed by other Bostonians, but such was not the case. In a city as explicitly and formally religious as mid- nineteenth century Boston, the arrival of the first sizable number of Jews caused something of a sensation. The dedication of the Commonwealth's 61. Ehrenfried, Chronicle, pp. 350ff. In 1850 and again in 1861 a combined total of over fifty Jews donated money to be sent to Palestine. In 1856 two B'nai B'rith lodges were founded, augmenting the two burial societies and one women's group. On September 19, 1858, a public mass meeting was held to celebrate Baron Rothschild's admission as the first Jew in the English Parliament. In the same month $240 was sent to the Jewish community of New Orleans to aid victims of a yellow fever epidemic. By 1855 two Jewish schools were maintained. 62. Ibid., p. 342. 63.

The event was extensively covered in the local press, whose reports reflect intense curiosity as to who these peo- ple were.64 Curiosity, however, did not translate into total social acceptance and integration, as is evidenced in the practical exclusion of Jewish children from the public schools by the continued inclusion of religious prayer and study in the curriculum.65 The high residential mobility of the city's Jews further attests to a degree of social instability. Given the socioeconomic status of Boston Jewry between 1845 and 1861, the crucial question is to what extent their experiences were representative of other first generation German Jewish immigrants in other cities in other regions of the nation. The state of the field being what it is, any claim of a definitive answer to this all-important question would be presumptuous. Nonetheless, certain tentative claims can be put forth. The tendency of German Jews to form well-defined but internally fragmented communities is well documented. Jewish communities large and small had both Bavarian and Polish congregations.66 An exasperated Isaac Leeser, attempting to unify and mobilize the nation's Jews in 1856, despaired: "Our strength is frittered away by every community's acting in- dependently of all others; since scarcely two congregations, in any one city even, have a mutual good understanding between them."67 Comparison of the sample data on place of birth with comparable samples of Jews in New York City and Milwaukee is inconclusive, but indicates that different regional subgroups of Jews predominated in different communities.68 In Milwaukee, for instance, as of 1855 there were very few Polish Jews but a 64.

The New York sample is derived from the annual report of "Jews' Hospital" (later renamed Mt. Sinai) in two of its first four years of operation, 1856 and 1858. For each patient admitted (216 in 1856 and 280 in 1858), occupation, age, and place of birth were recorded. The hospital was little more than an infirmary at the time, with a total staff of nine persons (one doctor), and was opened for the specific purpose of treating Jewish patients. It is presumed the patients represented a fair cross-section of New York's lower and middle class Jews. Cf. Occi- dent 14 (1856): 581-82; 16 (1858): 592-93. 149</page><page sequence="30">STEPHEN G.

The seemingly unlikely conjunction of continual residential movement along with a propensity to remain in the same city also was not unique to Boston. Among the German Jews of Columbus, Ohio, who constituted a smaller and more homogeneous community, the tendency was even more pronounced. More than 40 percent of that city's Jews moved in a given year during the 1860s, but virtually no one left for another city.69 The Columbus study also serves to verify the prolific childbearing of German mothers in- dicated in the sample data. Marc Lee Raphael, the author of the Columbus study, made the following observation: ". . . most of the immigrant Jewish families were quite large. The usual pattern, and its consistency is quite remarkable, was for the wife to bear a child every other year. Indeed there is much to suggest that only age or exhaustion put an end to childbearing."70 The highly distinctive occupational distribution of Boston's Jews is strikingly similar to that of German Jews in four other widely scattered cities; New York, Detroit, Columbus, and San Francisco (see table 13). The major discrepancy is in the proportionate number of artisans, which was 69. Raphael, "The Early Jews of Columbus, Ohio," pp. 445-46. 70. Ibid. 150</page><page sequence="31">IMMIGRANTS IN BOSTON significantly higher in the East. This apparently reflected the more highly diversified and specialized nature of the large eastern cities' economies, and the greater amount of manufacturing activity in them. Thus, while most of Columbus's early arriving Jews were clothing retailers, many of Boston's were skilled tailors. Common to the Jewish experience in these four dis- parate cities, however, was the highly disproportionate number of Jews employed as either peddlers or merchants. The 40 percent of Boston's Jews so employed, which was nearly twice the city's norm, was actually the lowest in the four cities for which data are available. Unskilled and manual labor was an occupational category simply not applicable to the nation's Jews. The same can also be said for the professional and semiprofessional categories at the opposite pole of the status scale.

The social and cultural marginality of Boston's Jews reflected in their undistinguished institutions and particular choice of neighborhood also ap- pears to be indicative of other American Jewish communities at the mid- century-excepting, perhaps, those in cities with large German minorities.71 71. On this last point cf. Glanz, "Jews in Relation to the Cultural Milieu of the Germans in America," Judaica Americana, pp. 203-55. 151</page><page sequence="32">STEPHEN G. MOSTOV This was inevitable given the nascent character of most of the nation's Jewish communities. The most persuasive evidence to this effect is, once again, a contemporary admonishment by Leeser: When we are asked for our literature, for our preachers, for our colleges, for our hospitals and asylums, for our chieftains and leading men of authority, [we] have nothing of the kind worth the name to exhibit. ... We should do something which will be regarded as an evidence of our presence in the land. The American people will pronounce our condemnation if, with the progress of our growth, we remain ... where we were placed through the paucity of our early numbers, and the insignificance of the means then at our command.72 In sum, the first generation German Jewish immigrants were a uniquely distinctive component of the mid-nineteenth century American city. Once correctly identified, the social, economic, and demographic characteristics of these Jews can in fact be reconstituted through the use of public data and communal records. The portrait of Boston's Jews presented here is intended to serve as a case study, indicative of the experiences of first generation German Jews in urban centers throughout the United States. Once similar studies on other cities are completed, a more sophisticated understanding of the beginnings and actual paths of Jewish economic and social mobility will emerge. Given the selective nature of the German Jewish immigration, their inclination to settle in urban centers, and their concentration in mercantile pursuits, it is readily apparent that first generation German Jews early on positioned themselves and their progeny on a potentially favorable mobility track. It is equally evident, however, that most first generation German Jewish immigrants were not destined to become the highly sophisticated ty- coons of their invariable stereotype. 72.
