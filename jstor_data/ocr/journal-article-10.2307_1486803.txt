Sheffield: Almond Press, 1990. 192 pp. It was not so long ago that the postexilic period was dismissed by biblical scholars as a time of "decline" and its literature, including the books of Chronicles, with which Rodney Duke's Persuasive Appeal of the Chronicler is concerned, considered both literarily and theologically unimpressive. All that has changed in recent years as the pendulum of biblical studies has made yet another of its periodic swings, bringing renewed interest to the</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 109 work of that era. Duke's volume, which originated as a dissertation at Emory University (1988), reflects that recent reassessment. The author has undertaken the application of Aristotle's concept of rhet- oric to the books of Chronicles. He begins by describing the classical view and then focuses on the biblical material, using the Aristotelian rubrics of logos, ethos, and pathos. The concept is an interesting one; whether Chron- icles was the best place to look for "persuasive speech" within the Hebrew canon (the prophets would have been a more obvious choice) is another matter. Duke relies heavily on a 1972 dissertation by G. E. Schaefer from South- ern Baptist Theological Seminary, "The Significance of Seeking God in the Purpose of the Chronicler," to demonstrate the didactic dimension in Chronicles. In his view, David and Solomon serve there as models, exempli- fying the importance of seeking God for those who had recently returned from the Babylonian exile. In an interesting comment, he even states this to have been the explicit intention of the book's "final composer" (p. 35), a surprising view in a contemporary work of literary criticism, which is more typically interested in how we read a text than in what its author had in mind. In some respects, one might question the significance of this thesis. Reli- gious fidelity is, after all, a central theme in most, if not all, the books in the biblical canon, and the fact that Chronicles expresses this in cultic terms is scarcely surprising given how the book is conventionally understood. Duke's approach raises other questions as well. Without disputing the prominent role accorded royal figures in much of the Bible, it does not necessarily follow that Israel's kings were considered to be role models, par- ticularly for ordinary Israelites, as Duke seems to suggest (e.g., p. 144). To the contrary, the Bible's preoccupation with royalty more commonly leads to the overshadowing of Israel's populace. The suggestion that Saul functions as a foil for David (p. 143) illustrates another problem with this study. In fact, the contrast between David and Saul is much clearer in Samuel's treatment of this period than in that of Chronicles, where Saul's role appears to have been reduced dramatically. This phenomenon is usually attributed to the Chronicler's effort to elevate David by making him appear to have been Israel's first king, with the result being a reduction in Saul's prominence. Since Duke thinks that the Chronic- ler may have believed that his audience was familiar with Samuel/Kings (pp. 110-111), one would have expected the contrast between David and</page><page sequence="3">110 BOOK REVIEWS Saul to be sharper in Chronicles than in its source, the book of Samuel. At the same time, Duke does point to the more mechanical and fatalistic treat- ment generally offered in Samuel/Kings. Any reading of a literary work must ultimately be measured against the text it purports to describe. It is this criterion by which the persuasiveness of Duke's own rhetoric should be judged. In the end, this reviewer remains unconvinced that Chronicles belongs in the same category as a good sermon or that its primary purpose was to encourage readers to embark on li'ves of religious fidelity modeled on those of David and of Solomon. This is not to dispute the possibility that Chronicles' interest in the Solomonic Temple was intended to serve the author's own contemporary interests, but whether it should be characterized as rhetoric directed at a broad group of postexilic Judeans is another matter. The lengthy genealogies with which the book begins are not an effective mode of persuasive speech, nor does the suggested thesis match the impression one receives from reading the book itself, despite Duke's six lists of the various passages which do (or do not) contain what he identifies as the "seeking enthymeme." His effort to read a biblical work in accordance with Aristotelian categories is suggestive, and his attempt to assesss the Chronicler's purpose offers a useful contribution to the ongoing discussion of what the book is trying to say. In the end, however, his results, like those of many recent literary treatments, seem more convincing when presented than when one reads the biblical work they purport to describe. Duke makes a game try, but the Chronicler keeps get- ting in the way. Frederick E. Greenspahn University of Denver Denver, Colo.</page></plain_text>
