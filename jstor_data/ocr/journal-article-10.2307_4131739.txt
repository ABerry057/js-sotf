Cincinnati, OH: Hebrew Union College Press, 2004. x, 272 pp. Genocide, a neologism coined during World War II and now enshrined in in- ternational law, reflects an ancestral phenomenon as old as human history, if not older. It is a secularized version of what our predecessors understood by holy war, just war, andjihad as divine sanctions of murder and mayhem. The twentieth cen- tury anachronistically has applied the term to the Armenian massacres of World War I, and the United Nations today struggles how not to apply its definition to similar actions such as the tragic events in Rwanda, Bosnia, and Sudan, let alone threats of mass terrorist murder by a bevy of religious killers. While our contem- porary market is nearly saturated with books on the rebirth ofjihad in its current terrorist manifestation, and a number of studies have examined the biblical an- tecedents of genocide, Louis Feldman offers a unique perspective on several an- cient rereadings of a revered text that can be read as potentially genocidal. Feldman examines three first-century Jewish texts-Philo's oeuvre, Pseudo- Philo's LiberAntiquitorum Biblicarum (LAB), and the works of Josephus Flavius- none of which paradoxically influenced Jews directly for the next fifteen centuries on the question of the commandment to destroy Amalek and other similar biblical texts that describe or advocate mass murder. But "Remember Amalek!" is only the surface commandment in this discussion. Feldman identifies a number of other cases of mass murder in the biblical corpus beginning with the story of Noah, a moralized version of the Flood story that permeated the ancient Near East. Sodom and Gomorrah, too, represented an ethical interpretation of the total destruction of the inhabitants of these two cities. More selected mass murders included the slay- ing of the first-born Egyptians-including the animals, which raises interesting theological and philosophical questions. Philo offers a sophistic and dismissive re- sponse to the question why animals lacking free will were also killed. Other inci- dents, such as the commandment to exterminate the seven invading (archaeology) or resident (biblical) peoples of Canaan, the slaying of the Hivites of Shekhem, the annihilation of the subjects of Sihon and Og, and the ruthless sack of Jericho. With- in the Israelite family there is the problem of the priests of Nob whom David slew. (No discussion of the near extermination of the tribe of Benjamin is found how- ever.) All of these questions had to be dealt with by analysis or by omission among the three authors. The last major ethical question is the story of Pinhas (Feldman follows the Latin LAB and calls him Phinehas), whom God praises for his zeal- ousness, clearly an embarrassment to Josephus, who witnessed the destruction of Jerusalem as a result of zealous insurgents who cited Pinhas as their icon. These three corpora are usually designated as "rewritten Bible" and hence constitute a precious insight into the ways that first-century Jews in the face of Ro- man power, whether wary of it as in the case of Philo or in fear of it as in the case of LAB and Josephus, adjusted their inherited sacred texts-still pre-Tanakh-to the realities of the Roman Imperium. Hence they danced around the evolving equa- tion of Esau/Edom with Rome, although more could have been said by the author 363</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews on this enigmatic point. The importance of these three texts to contemporary Jew- ish scholarship obscures their recent import. Until the nineteenth century, few Jews were aware of them, let alone studied and commented on them. Except for Sefer Yosippon, in which appear the names of Philo (called Yedidyah) and Josephus (known as Joseph ben Gurion ha-Cohen), their memory would have been lost com- pletely from the Hebrew record. Hence Feldman's careful and comprehensive analysis of these three texts is an important contribution to our ongoing interest in these individuals and their corpus of interpretations. Philo the philosopher was primarily interested in applying the middle pla- tonic methodology of allegory to rewrite ancient texts to the contemporary taste. Just as his sophist and philosophical colleagues were careful to sublimate the vio- lence of their sacred texts (e.g., Homer's two epics), so, too, Philo rewrote the bib- lical stories occasionally ignoring the more problematic examples. Josephus also had to make an apologetic representation of the Bible as well as the recent history of the Jews in light of his privileged status as an honored guest in the emperor's villa. His continued rewriting of his wartime career indicates how deep was the an- tagonism to his position among Jews subject to the Roman Imperium. His inter- pretation of the question of genocide in the texts bears the interesting and serious comparison that Feldman provides. Pseudo-Philo, an enigmatic figure extant only in a (perhaps fourth-century) Latin translation of the Greek, which appears to be based on a first-century Hebrew original, is a pious God-fearing Jew who has few difficulties with such texts that appear to him to be justifiable punishments by God who was prone to burn off the gloss of iniquity from his creation. Feldman's detailed analysis and description of their attitudes towards the texts of destruction in the Scriptures adumbrates later discussions by the rabbis about similar instances elsewhere in Scripture (none of the three, for example, touch on the problem at the end of the Book of Esther despite its relationship to Amalek). And following the rabbinical discussions are the modern secular discus- sions by scholars and others about the nature of genocide traditions and the role of sacred scriptures in their justification and development. Unfortunately, genocide has been one of the central consequences of modern nationalism occasionally jus- tified by resort to scriptural justification in the mix of authorities that constitute the transition from a religious society to a secular one. The transition of Jewish so- ciety in the first century from an independent power to a subdued minority may shed some light on such transitional shifts and allow for some useful observations and perhaps remedies to the chronic chaos contemporaneously designated under the rubric of genocide.
