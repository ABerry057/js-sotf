Albany: SUNY Press, 2000. x, 220 pp. This is a book about "political culture," a concept which, according to Ha- dassa Kosak "encapsulates the cultural and social characteristics of a group and the way these traits are demonstrated through political action" (p. 5). Kosak's book describes the political culture developed by Jews who left the small towns (shtetls) of eastern Europe for the United States between 1880 and the Russian Revolution of 1905. Unaccustomed to large-scale wage labor in an urban, industrial economy, 175</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews these often poorly educated newcomers had to develop new ways of dealing with the difficulties and injustices they encountered in a highly stratified, urban, capi- talistic America. Kosak demonstrates how they did this. Her work is especially valuable because it focuses on late-nineteenth-century immigration, while most historians of East European Jewish immigration focus on the larger, more politi- cally sophisticated post-1905 immigration. Her work is also valuable because of the breadth of its definition of what is "political." It deals with the political life of women as well as men and with political activity in private as well as public spaces, including food riots and parades as well as strikes and unions. As Kosak acknowledges, Cultures of Opposition builds on the culturally ori- ented perspectives of pioneer labor historians E. P. Thompson and Herbert Gut- man. Looking beyond social class, Kosak untangles the web of religious and cul- tural traditions on which the immigrants drew in constructing the new political culture. Like many recent historians of immigration, Kosak finds the roots of im- migrant behavior in America in "old country" traditions. Eschewing romanticiza- tion of Jewish life in the shtetl, she describes the privileged position of the wealth- ier Jews and their dominance in both the religious and secular spheres. Always present in Jewish communities, social stratification and class conflict within these communities grew in the mid-nineteenth-century as the economic policies of the Czarist government reduced increasing numbers to poverty. The sense of eco- nomic and social grievance against "unfair" use of economic privilege in east Eu- ropean Jewish communities was part of the baggage immigrants carried with them to America and one source of the political culture they developed there. Kosak documents other sources. Religious or not, immigrants drew on the biblical traditions embedded in their culture; they identified oppressive working conditions in America with the slavery the Jewish people had endured in Egypt. They also drew on the Marxist ideologies of nineteenth-century Europe. Finally, they drew on traditions and ideas associated with the United States. They had come to the United States because they believed that it was a place of freedom where they could earn a living and be treated with fairness and respect, and they intend- ed to stay. Therefore, they were willing to invest time and energy in making Amer- ica, at least the part of it they encountered, live up to their expectations. In urban America, as in Russia, social and economic stratification in the Jew- ish community produced "unfairness." Kosak identifies the American Jewish be- havior that the newcomers saw as unfair-economic exploitation by the more es- tablished and acculturated German Jews (and later by Eastern European Jews also) as landlords, employers, shopkeepers, and dispensers of charity. More important- ly, she documents the immigrants' resistance. The immigrants' protest against sweatshop conditions and low pay involved not the disciplined bargaining advocated by the American Federation of Labor, but rather "anarchical," often spontaneous strikes; boycotts of offending manufactur- ers; and harassment and even mob violence against employers and scabs. Labor protest, and indeed the entire culture of opposition, was a family affair, with house- wives and children as well as working men and women participating. Consumer as well as workplace issues aroused protest. Housewives organized rent strikes against "unfair" landlords and led boycotts against "exploitive" merchants. Dur- 176</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews ing the "kosher meat riots," women paraded through the streets destroying meat to break what they called the Rockefeller kosher meat monopoly. Kosak provides vivid descriptions of these and other sites and forms of protest. She emphasizes the communal dimension of the new political culture, the fact that popular protest against perceived injustice was supported by a wide range of community institu- tions, including synagogues, lodges, and the Yiddish press. Kosak's book is clearly within the ranks of the newer historical and socio- logical works about minorities that, while acknowledging oppression, emphasize coping mechanisms, strengths, and "agency" among the oppressed. She moves be- yond documenting isolated incidents of resistance to developing the idea of a working class culture of resistance. She argues-convincingly-that this culture was more democratic and participatory than the labor movement represented by the American Federation of Labor, and that its motivation was a desire for "fair- ness" and not for immediate economic gain. Despite the strong, sometimes repe- titious, theoretical framework that runs through Cultures of Opposition, the book is a "good read." Using well selected quotations from immigrant letters and diaries and from the American and Yiddish press, Kosak brings dramatic incidents and fascinating people to life. Cultures of Opposition is a welcome addition to immi- grant history, labor history, and the history of the American Jewish community and should be of interest to the political scientist as well.
