<plain_text><page sequence="1">Esther Fuchs, Omanut hahitamemut: 'al ha'ironyah shel Shai Agnon [Cun- ning innocence: On S. Y. Agnon's irony]. Makhon Katz: Tel Aviv Univer- sity, 1985. 166 pp. Esther Fuchs has written an essentially sound book about Agnon's nar- rative poetics that is marred by a gratuitously polemical rhetoric. As our preeminent modernist, whose production began before World War I and continues posthumously today, Agnon's work has engendered a prodigious tradition of criticism. The layers of this tradition reflect the changes in the spiritual history of the Jewish people as well as the very recent development of modern literary criticism. There were times (in the 1920s) in which Agnon was read as the authentic voice of a lost naive piety; and there were times (in the 1950s) in which he was read as a fabulist who wrote in precisely encoded allegories. For Esther Fuchs, this tradition largely represents a history of error, the record of readers who were taken in by Agnon's cunning. As a corrective, she offers irony as a structural principle capable of adequately explaining the Agnon corpus and lending the proper scientific rigor to the critical enterprise. Fuchs's book has much light to shed on Agnon's art, but the derision with which she relates to the work of other critics is not especially gracious. Yes, there are critics like Meshullam Tochner who absurdly overallegorized Agnon, but then there are others such as Shaked and Band who preserved the balance between theme and structure. Similarly, nothing is easier than adducing the excesses of Kurzweil without acknowledging the new era in Agnon criticism that his work, following Sadan's, ushered in. In fact virtual- ly no one is quoted to good effect in this book; even critics who would seem to be unassailable on these issues are invoked in such a way as to make them seem as if they belong to a prescientific age in Agnon criticism. This is one book in which you can be grateful for not being mentioned; but you will have to read the book through to find out, since there is no index, a fact which places limits on its general utility.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 79 This being said, Omanut hahitamemut makes an original, if presump- tuous, contribution to Agnon studies. Fuchs proposes to take irony as a cri- tical rubric within which to organize many dimensions of the Agnon text. Basing herself on the work of Booth, Frye, and Uspensky (not, significantly, on Derrida), Fuchs conceives of irony as a system of gaps among the various levels and functions of the text: implied author, narrator, character, explicit statement, implied characterization, plot events. Acting in accordance with what she sees as the critic's job, Fuchs seeks to expose the tensions in the work rather than seek some elusive and questionable unity, for in her view it is from these tensions that meaning issues. The key terms Fuchs sees as basic to all forms of irony are "paralepsis" (too much information or detail) and "paralipsis" (too little of the same). In heaping praise upon a character, for example, the narrator typically supplies information that urges the reader to reevaluate the character along less positive lines. (One might legitimately wonder about the wisdom of using a pair of terms differentiated orthogra- phically by so very little.) In describing these gaps, Fuchs uses individual texts as illustrations rather than occasions for interpretation. The text that accompanies her throughout her analysis is Hakhnasat qalah, which serves her purpose very well because it is a narrative that manages to be at once both naive and ironic. Fuchs offers a morphology of the Agnon text under four headings. The first is the irony of point-of-view, which primarily involves the gap between the implied author (Agnon) and his unreliable narrators. This gap is revealed, again, by either a conspicuous excess or an absence. The narrator may go on and on about matters that are essentially trivial or, conversely, he may show little awareness of the truly important issues in the narrative. The second form of irony relates to plot. Agnon's plots, according to Fuchs, tend to fall into three categories: the episodic, the circular, and the digres- sive. In each case the links among plot events are presented as motivated and logical, whereas in fact they are far from being so. On closer inspection what looks like development reveals absurd and arbitrary connections. A happy ending artificially imposed on one of these plots is yet another ironic device that calls attention to itself. Third is irony of character. A character is revealed in an ironic light if there is a discrepancy between the way he sees reality and the sense of reality, especially social reality, implicit in the refer- ential arrangements of the text. The fourth variety of irony involves manipu- lations of the narrative medium itself. Agnon is notorious for playing with his readers and playing with the novel form and the short story form.</page><page sequence="3">80 BOOK REVIEWS Authorial intrusions, overelaborate chapter titles, and deadpan narration of grotesque events are some of the means whereby Agnon ironizes the literary form within which he works. There is much to admire in Fuchs's critical practice. The writing is lucid and to the point, and the examples are well chosen. Most important is the fact that in this book Fuchs is a close and attentive reader of specific texts who is sensitive to the manifold nuances of narrative strategies. Her critical intuition, however, is hampered by the rigidity and assertiveness of the larger framework she had adopted. The claims she makes for the sover- eignty of irony as the key to Agnon are overly imperial: "This book, devoted entirely to irony in Agnon, does not view irony as one among a number of important foundations or techniques in Agnon's work but rather as the principle that organizes the corpus at all levels and serves as the dominant characteristic of all forms and genres" (p. 19). This grandiosity, of which one is in the end unpersuaded, is not harmful in itself. But it leads to a slight- ing of the interpretive and thematic axis of Agnon's work. Despite Fuchs's announced intention only to describe structures and functions and avoid making interpretations (p. 8), there are plenty of interpretations strewn throughout this volume. She states, for instance, that the major theme of Hakhnasat qalah is class injustice. Yet these interpretations are not present- ed and defended with the same scrutiny and attention to the views of others given to her main, formalist agenda. Making irony key does not do much to escape the notorious elusiveness that attaches to this category. Irony has been so universally held up as the mode of modernism and has been so widely identified as the genius of masterworks that its utility as a term is in question. Fuchs does a good job of delimiting and honing the term for application to Agnon, but the absence of a comparative dimension to her study leaves us in a quandary as to how Agnon's irony differs from the irony of such vastly different writers as, say, Henry James or William Faulkner. And, finally, because irony is every- where, it is sometimes tedious to point it out. Fewer contemporary readers of Agnon have been gulled by his cunning than Fuchs imagines.
