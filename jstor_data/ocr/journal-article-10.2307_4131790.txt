<plain_text><page sequence="1">Immanuel Etkes, Ba'al Hashem.: The Besht-Magic, Mysticism, Leadership. Jeru- salem: Merkaz Zalman Shazar, 2000. 327 pp. (Hebrew). During the past two decades, many important works have been published- mostly by Israeli scholars-on virtually every aspect of Hasidism. The writings of David Assaf, Rachel Elior, Zeev Gries, Moshe Idel, Gedalia Nigal, Ada Rapaport- Albert, and Moshe Rosman, to name only the most prominent contemporary scholars of Hasidism, range from sweeping critical re-evaluations of earlier Ha- sidic historiography and theology to close studies of major sects within the Ha- sidic movement. In the course of this outpouring of Hasidic scholarship, the pio- neering work of Scholem and his disciples has been demolished and rehabilitated several times over. Beyond even more detailed studies of later and minor Hasidic sects, it would have seemed, at this late date, that there was little left to add to the discussion of the origins and theology of classical, or "Beshtian," Hasidism. Thus the appearance, in the year 2000, of a new book by Immanuel Etkes dedicated to the "Founder of Hasidism," R. Israel Baal Shem Tov, could hardly be greeted with- out the question with which the author himself begins his introduction: "Why an- other book on the Besht? What can this book hope to add to all that has already been written and published on this topic?" (p. 9). The answers that Etkes' new study of the Besht provides to these self- imposed questions are, as it turns out, both substantial and rewarding. While Baal Ha-Shem: Ha-Besht-Magiah, Mistikah, Hanhagah does include much material with which Etkes has already dealt in previously published articles and reviews, the book presents a clear, comprehensive and delicately balanced overview of the earlier scholarship-in itself not an easy task-as well as the author's own com- pelling view of the "historical" Baal Shem Tov. Among the key questions that Etkes addresses are: (1) What can we know about the Besht based on the limited prima- ry source material available, and (2) how are we to evaluate the Besht's disputed role in the emergence of the Hasidic movement in the decades immediately fol- 145</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews lowing his death? Etkes notes that he had already begun his research on the Besht before the appearance of Moshe Rosman's groundbreaking book, Founder of Ha- sidism: A Quest for the Historical Baal Shem Tov', and indicates that it was his sharp disagreement with many of Rosman's methodological assumptions about the unreliability of Hasidic sources (mainly the Shivhei Ha-Besht), as well as his conclusions about the Besht's place in history, that stirred him to complete his work (p. 13; see also Etkes' detailed critique of Rosman's book on pp. 245-249). One of Etkes' strengths as an intellectual historian is his ability to use his erudition to clarify rather than obfuscate complex matters that have long been mired in scholarly dispute. In reviewing the mass of previous scholarship on the Besht and early Hasidism, he paves a clear path through the thicket of books and articles that have sprouted in recent years. His conclusions are not only well ar- gued and meticulously rooted in a sober analysis of the sources; they are, for the most part, very compelling. The first chapter ("Magiah U-Vaalei Shem Be-Yamav Shel Ha-Besht"), in many ways the most original part of the book, examines in rich detail the devel- opment in seventeenth- and early-eighteenth-century East European Jewish soci- ety of an elaborate culture of folk-superstition rooted in the fear of the tangible evil and demonic forces at work in the world. The most significant aspect of the widespread superstitious beliefs of the Jewish masses in the forces of evil, for our understanding of the life of the Besht and the subsequent emergence of Hasidic leadership, was the important place it allowed for the emergence of a new class of religious professionals in Polish Jewish society, the Baalei Shem. Etkes analyzes a rich selection of primary texts that document the activities of these Jewish ma- gicians and healers, focusing in particular on the career of R. Joel Baal Shem who, in many ways, typified the pre-Beshtian model (pp. 41-51). He shows that by the middle of the eighteenth century, Baal Shemism had become a surprisingly well- defined profession, characterized by magical practices consisting mainly of a va- riety of exorcisms directed at combating an array of evil forces that had taken root in individuals, properties, and sometimes entire communities. What is most strik- ing about the work of the Baalei Shem-and what differentiates it from the path later taken by the Besht-was its self-imposed limitations. These men were, es- sentially, contractors who responded to calls for their services to heal individuals of demonic possession or to cleanse homes that had become haunted by hitsonim, or the forces of evil. They had a limited repertoire of tricks, the most common of which were the writing of kamei'ot (amulets); prescription of lehashim (magical incantations); and performance of segulot (voodoo-like ceremonies) directed at combating the various agents of the Sitra Ahra, or. In Chapter Two ("Yisrael Baal Shem"), Etkes describes the ways in which the Besht conformed to the earlier model of the Baal Shem and, more significant- ly, how he expanded that role and broke with its self-imposed limitations. While he, like R. Joel, responded to individual calls for exorcism, the Besht had a far grander perception of his role and powers. Thus, the Besht addressed issues of much broader communal concern than his predecessors, reflecting his own self- 1. Berkeley, 1996. 146</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews assessment as the spiritual leader-though never chosen or formally appointed by any Jewish community-of the entire Jewish people. One of the striking features of the Besht's personality that emerges here is his astonishing grandiosity, boast- fulness regarding his supernatural powers, and arrogant sense of superiority vis- A-vis other rabbis and Baalei Shem. The Besht harbored absolutely no self-doubt when it came to his divine calling to minister to East European Jewry as a whole or his powers to fulfill that formidable mission. Among the major problems facing the Jewish communities of the Ukraine during the Besht's lifetime were violent anti-Semitic persecutions by the Haida- meks, the economic crisis that faced many Jewish leaseholders of Polish estates, and the declining standards of shehitah. Skillfully using the Hasidic sources that he deems reliable, most notably Sefer Shivhei Ha-Besht, Etkes demonstrates in Chapter Three ("Manhig Shel Klal Yisrael") how the Besht uniquely addressed these major communal concerns. In addition to extending his mandate beyond re- sponding to calls from individuals desiring the benefits of his magical services, the Besht also used mystical prayer and ecstatic experiences (most notably heav- enly ascents) to solve problems tackled by earlier Baalei Shem through a more lim- ited repertoire of magical techniques. Having established the Besht's boldness and self-confidence as a Baal Shem and his expansive vision of both his mystical powers and communal mission, Etkes goes on in Chapter Four ("He-Besht Ke-Mistikan U- Vaal Besorah Be- Avodat Ha-Shem) to re-visit in impressive detail his innovations as a mystic. While, as Etkes points out, there have been many fine studies of early Hasidic mysticism-mostly by Scholem's disciples, such as Rivka Shatz and Joseph Weiss-none have focused exclusively on the teachings of the Besht himself. What we know of "Beshtian" Hasidism is mostly gleaned through the writ- ings of key disciples such as the Maggid of Mezeritch and R. Jacob Joseph of Polnoe, thus, the Besht's own originality as a mystic is lost in the forest of their writings (p. 128). Etkes points to several key elements of the Besht's mystical theology that later became salient features of Hasidism. Most important among them is his deep faith in the absolute immanence of God in the mate- rial universe, out of which flowed the Besht's denial of tangible reality to evil and his rejection of ascetic religious practice. And, Etkes insists, unlike many earlier Kabbalists, the Besht's mysticism grew out of his life experience: It seems to me that it was the Besht who cleared the path for the revolutionary con- ception of Divine immanence in Hasidism. Moreover, it would seem that this new conception did not emerge from the perplexities of a theoretician bound by the four cubits of theosophical speculation, but that it reflects the actual mystical ex- perience enjoyed by the Besht (p. 146). The final chapter of this fine book ("Sefer Shivhei Ha-Besht Ke-Makor His- tori") deals with methodological questions about Etkes' sources for reconstructing the life of the Besht, most importantly, the degree to which the historian can rely on the tales in Shivhei Ha-Besht. Etkes here expands on his devastating review of Rosman's aforementioned book ("Ha-Besht Ha-Histori: Beyn Rekonstruktsia Le- Dekonstruktsia" Tarbiz, 66 [1997]: pp. 425-42), in which he compellingly argued 147</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews that one need not believe in the truth of the details of these tales in order to accept their authenticity and value as sources for understanding the life and times of the Besht and his impact on the subsequent development of Hasidism. Etkes demon- strates how these tales can be parsed and used analytically to great advantage by the historian who is sensitive to their linguistic and theological nuances. There are times when Etkes' study slips into a somewhat pedantic reading of seminal Beshtian texts that have already been overanalyzed by scholars of Ha- sidism. One conspicuous example of such excess is his exhaustive treatment of the famous letter of the Besht to his brother-in-law, R. Gershon of Kutov. At the end of his thirteen-page discussion (pp. 88-100) of this already overworked text, Etkes has not added much to its understanding, beyond elaborating upon Scholem's de- nial that it bears an urgent messianic message. Then again, Etkes certainly suc- ceeds in presenting a convincing case-Scholem's many subsequent interlocutors notwithstanding-that the Besht did not see himself as a messianic figure at all. Quite the contrary, his entire calling was based on the struggle with an unredeemed world, and the conversation with the Messiah during his ascent of soul showed clearly that messianic redemption was not expected by the Besht in his own life- time. However thorough and clear the picture of the Besht that emerges from this book, he remains one of Jewish history's most clouded figures. Even for those who accept all of his methodological assumptions and historical conclusions, Etkes' book raises new ambiguities and paradoxes. I shall deal with two of the most con- spicuous examples. First, central to Etkes' argument about the Besht's originality as a mystic was his denial of any reality to evil forces that had hitherto been confronted with ut- most seriousness by Kabbalists and by Baalei Shem. Yet, in his discussion of the Besht's practice of Baalshemism, Etkes recounts several tales in which the Besht seems indeed to take demonic forces with utter seriousness, including one case in which he deals with a rather cute couple of hitsonim who had been conceived and born in a synagogue as the result of an arrogant baritone Hazzan's vanity during prayer. At the end of the day, sensing the need to get them out of the shul, the Besht finds them alternate housing near a deserted well (pp. 59-60). It is unclear how to reconcile such accounts of the Besht's engagement with hitsonim with his denial of reality to netherworldly and evil forces at work in the world. Second, throughout the book, particularly in the long chapter on the Besht's "circle," Etkes presses the point that the Besht consciously and deliberately culti- vated a group of followers who were meant to continue his work, thus spawning the Hasidic movement. At the same time, Etkes demonstrates clearly that the Besht was possessed of a belief in his uniqueness, suggesting the impossibility of any competent spiritual heirs. In fact, Etkes devotes a long discussion to what he terms the Besht's bil' adiyut, or total singularity, as a mystic and Baal Shem (pp. 78-87), but he never quite resolves the inherent tension between that self-perception and the Besht's allegedly self-conscious role as the harbinger, if not the direct founder, of the Hasidic movement. These problems notwithstanding, Immanuel Etkes has produced a major, highly erudite re-evaluation of the Besht that both clarifies and clearly contextu- 148</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews alizes the work of many earlier scholars, and as well presents a well-documented and deeply learned portrait of the still-mysterious Israel Baal Shem Tov. This book is essential reading for those working in the field of East European Judaism, as well as for anyone interested in the origins and early history of Hasidism.
