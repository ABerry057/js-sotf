Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990. viii, 246 pp. The self-confidence of British historians, who have written now for many generations as if the European continent did not exist, has not been shared by those describing the Anglo-Jewish experience. The Jewish His- torical Society of England, now nearing its centenary, has not only accepted that the history of the Jews of Britain is different, but also that it is unimpor-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 325 tant. The motto of the society might well have been "Amateur history for an amateur community." At best, native Jewish historians have produced apologetica, emphasizing the long-standing nature of Anglo-Jewry and the contributions of the Jewish minority to the tolerant and peaceful British nation. Such complacency, although not yet overcome, has been challenged first by American historians concerned with the recovery of more modern Anglo-Jewish history, and more recently by a group of more radical, profes- sionally trained, British scholars. Todd Endelman, following Lloyd Gart- ner, belongs to the former school, his The Jews of Georgian England a classic account that revealed the potential of Anglo-Jewish social history. Endelman, in the introduction to his ambitious new survey, makes his historiographical stance clear. He distances himself from "the amateurs grouped around the Jewish Historical Society of England [who] lacked the conceptual rigor and critical viewpoint characteristic of professional his- torical scholarship" (pp. 211-212, n. 4). Nevertheless he criticizes the new professional school for its "preference for poor Jews rather than rich ones" (p. 212, n. 6). Due to such imbalance, argues Endelman, "they have shown little interest in exploring the maintenance of group loyalties-or their disso- lution-over the course of Anglo-Jewish history" (p. 8). The author is perhaps too dismissive of the "new school." Whole areas of the Anglo-Jewish experience, such as the history of Jewish radicalism, women's history, immigrant life, and many others, have been rescued from oblivion. This achievement has been all the more remarkable given the lack of Jewish Studies positions in British universities. Indeed, there is not and has never been an academic post devoted to Anglo-Jewish history. Even so, Endelman is absolutely correct to highlight the absence of studies covering Anglo-Jewish identity. In this sense, given the vacuum in which he was working, Endelman's Radical Assimilation is a remarkable achievement. In just over two hundred pages of text, the author manages to distill close to three hundred years of English Jewish history. Following his past trade- mark, Endelman does so in elegant prose, witty but never flippant about his subject matter. Endelman is aware of the peculiarity of Anglo-Jewish his- tory, but he does not mistake its oddity, the anti-intellectualism and search for invisibility of its elite, for insignificance in terms of world Jewry. This, then, is an important book, but it is not one without serious flaws. Endelman is faced with the daunting task of placing in context the experi- ences of a community which started in the age of mercantilism and was based on a few wealthy families, to one in 1945 living in a late industrial</page><page sequence="3">326 BOOK REVIEWS society which was half a million strong. It would seem churlish to criticize a study which covers so much ground and includes thirty pages of notes for not using all the available sources. Endelman is, however, too bold when he suggests that quantitive source material does not exist and "it is impossible to measure statistically defection from the Anglo-Jewish community at any time in its history" (pp. vii-viii). Information on those who left the com- munity, aside from the impressionistic and generalized accounts of contem- poraries, is, it must be stressed, available. Such archival sources do require extensive work if patterns of intermarriage, conversion, and disaffiliation are to be charted. For the nineteenth century, when the process which Endelman highlights escalated, patterns can be established by correlating the detailed information available in census returns, and in synagogue and other Jewish institutional records. Endelman compensates for the absence of these sources by a vigorous analysis of memoirs, correspondence, literary sources, and other materials of a nonquantitive nature. It is true that these are of tremendous value, especially in the hands of a sophisticated historian. Dry statistics cannot provide the subtleties and nuances required for the study of Jewish identity. On both sides of the Atlantic, the number- crunching activities of the new social historians have somehow managed to remove individual experiences. In the specific case of Anglo-Jewry, the deci- sion to distance oneself from the community, to marry out, or to take the extreme step of converting to Christianity was, to an extent, always unique. Generalizations thus become difficult and potentially dangerous. Even so, the absence of statistical data leaves Endelman open to the criticism that his work is, like that of some of the contemporaries he quotes, impressionistic. This is particularly the case with the last chapter, which deals with the twen- tieth century, and which could have benefited from an exploration of recent oral history projects. Unlike the historian of the Jewish communities of Ger- many, Austria, or Hungary, the Anglo-Jewish specialist does not have the statistics ready at hand. It is to be hoped, therefore, that a new generation of Jewish historians will be encouraged to locate the materials buried and scat- tered across Britain that would enable Endelman's hypotheses to be vigor- ously tested. The main thesis of this provocative study is that Anglo-Jewry has been and is increasingly being killed by kindness. Endelman suggests that the numerical decline of Anglo-Jewry, paricularly marked since 1945, is not due to antisemitism and a desire to escape prejudice, but in fact the reverse. Nowhere else in Europe has antisemitism been so weak a political force, violence so lacking, and liberalism so dominant. Endelman does not argue</page><page sequence="4">BOOK RKlVIIEWS 327 that antisemitism was absent, but that when it did surface it was only a minor irritant to Anglo-Jewry, an amorphous and rarely threatening phen- omenon. Instead, Endelman concludes, "In their own benign way, legal toleration and social acceptance challenged group continuity more effective- ly than did overt persecution in the period before World War II" (p. 209). He continues that it was not toleration per se that has caused the decline of Anglo-Jewry, but its English variant, which "made possible the successful integration of English Jews [but] was hostile to the notion of cultural diver- sity" (p. 209). Yet ultimately the question remains: why did Anglo-Jewry engage to such a remarkable degree in "radical assimilation"? Here Endel- man separates himself from the new radical school of Anglo-Jewish his- torians. The latter, led by the historian of Manchester Jewry, Bill Williams, has highlighted the limitations of tolerance. Williams in particular suggests that there is actually an "antisemitism of tolerance." Endelman holds back from this less positive interpretation, pointing out that Britain is a voluntary society, unlike other European countries, and there is no formal, written Jewish emancipation contract. Yet for a community so removed from vio- lence, it is remarkable how Anglo-Jewry, since readmission in 1656, has suf- fered from a constant and pervasive fear of antisemitism. This fear, which has conditioned so much of its behavior, has had a stultifying impact on Anglo-Jewish identity. Its enormous impact, cutting across class, ethnic, and gender lines, has continued throughout three centuries, bringing into question Endelman's belief in the benign nature of British culture. Todd Endelman must nevertheless be congratulated for opening up the study of Anglo-Jewish identity in this stimulating account. He has located an intriguing topic in an area littered with minefields; it is a brave book which will no doubt be challenged by future scholarship. Endelman again reinforces the importance of studying the neglected or trivialized Anglo- Jewish minority. It is ironic, but highly significant, that it has taken an American scholar to put Anglo-Jewish history on the map. Tony Kushner University of Southampton Southampton, England</page></plain_text>
