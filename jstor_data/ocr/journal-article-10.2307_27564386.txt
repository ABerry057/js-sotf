Jerusalem: Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, 2006. 539 pp. doi: 10.1017/S036400940800143 8 History, it was once said, is the juncture where image, myth, and reality meet. Sometimes they merge, at other times they clash, and in other instances they just brush against each other, causing one or more to shift slightly, raising dust in its wake, but not completely changing course. Aviva Halamish's latest book, dealing with official Zionist immigration policy during the 1930s, subtly and successfully does all three at different times. In addition to its being a path breaking study in various political and bureaucratic aspects of Yishuv immigration history, it also provides us with new insights into other aspects of that topic that have previously received historical attention. The image is that of what is colloquially known as the "Fifth Aliyah," the fifth wave of immigration to pr?state Israel that took place during most of the 1930s. Popularly known as the "Yekke Aliyah," the large number of German Jewish immigrants to Palestine during this period and their vociferous contri butions to the state in the making created the myth that German Jews were the majority of immigrants during the 1930s. Any other groups were seen as playing second or even third fiddle to this major group of immigrants. The reality of this immigration wave is what Halamish skillfully weaves into her narrative and analysis of Zionist immigration policy during the 1930s, in which 455</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews she shows how Jews from German-speaking countries were far from the majority of immigrants during any particular period of this wave of immigration. However, Halamish's fascinating study does not focus on the immigrants but primarily on the framework that allowed them to reach Palestine: Zionist immigra tion policy was carried out within a schedule formulated by British government dic tates. A quick glance at this framework shows it delineating four categories of immigrants: capitalists and invited immigrants not entering the workforce, such as students, labor immigrants, and dependants. Zionist entities only had bearing on the human composition of the third of these groups, and its size was dependent on the economic absorption capacity at any particular time. Using a plethora of sources, Halamish escorts us into four circles in which she probes the nature, recep tion, and results of Zionist immigration policies during the 1930s. The first is the external political circle, the relationship between the Zionist organization and the British over the question of aliyah. The second is the internal political circle? the debates that took place within the various groups of which the Zionist organi zation was composed. The third was the operative circle?how the mechanics of Jewish immigration during the 1930s actually took place, starting with the sub mission of immigration forms until the actual absorption of the immigrant in Pales tine. The fourth is the ideological circle, the concepts of which explained what ultimately became the immigration process as described and analyzed in this study. Although a description and analysis of bureaucracy, on which the book con centrates, can often turn into a statistical maze in which the uninitiated quickly lose their way, not to mention their interest, Halamish has successfully risen to the chal lenge. Interspersing political analysis with descriptions and explanations of the human factors that guided policy, she presents Zionist immigration policy during the 1930s in an extremely readable and understandable form. The section devoted to immigration policy vis-?-vis women is one of the more fascinating topics in the book, in which she discusses a neglected aspect of gendered immigration of the time. Here we learn of various ways in which female immigrants were discrimi nated against, making the "dual race against time" double hard for women wishing to make 'aliyah as "workers." For example, while male immigrants in this category could automatically list their wives as dependants and bring them to Palestine during this period, female immigrants could not. Additional topics worthy of note are her discussion of the "transfer agreement" that enabled German Jews to transfer a large portion of their capital to Palestine, and her analysis of the key by which immigra tion certificates were distributed among various countries. Yet another unique facet of the book is the fact that Halamish takes the term "immigration policy" to its zenith, not stopping her tale at the moment that the immigrant set foot on Palestinian soil but continuing the process, discussing the bureaucracy behind immigrant absorption and not only immigration. It is interesting to note that the author, a veteran and well-respected historian of Yishuv immigration1 who coined the oft-quoted expression ha'apala netulat 1. The Exodus Affair: Holocaust Survivors and the Struggle for Palestine (Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1998). 456</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews ma apilim (illegal immigration sans immigrants) when describing the focus of many studies dealing with illegal immigration to Palestine, chose to analyze the reality of the "Fifth Aliyah" by concentrating on aspects of policy. In brief flashes of digres sion she hints at the human interest stories of both policy makers and immigrants that stood behind official stories of policy, immigration, and settlement. Bearing in mind the scope and length of the book, it is understandable that these forays into the personal are circumscribed, and readers can only hope that she will even tually publish a study of the "other side," the immigrants themselves. Equally, if not more important, is to hope that the book will soon be translated into English so that non-Hebrew readers will be able to acquaint themselves with the image, myth, and reality of the "dual race against time"?the final years when immigrants from Europe could still make their way to Palestine before the Holocaust descended on them and engulfed European Jewry in flames.
