<plain_text><page sequence="1">Robert G. Goldy. The Emergence of Jewish Theology in America, Blooming- ton: Indiana University Press, 1990. 149 pp. Current Jewish theological activity focuses on the study and regenera- tion of midrash and on theoretical reflections on the rules of interpretation. We have yet to give this theological activity an official name. But, thanks to Robert Goldy's succinct and highly readable narrative, we can locate its pre- history. Today's hermeneutical theology succeeds the American Jewish neo- Orthodox existentialism that Goldy calls, after Will Herberg, the New Jewish Theology. Goldy has offered a very helpful intellectual history of the contributions four thinkers made to the development of this New Theology after World War II: Herberg, Abraham Joshua Heschel, Emil Fackenheim, and Joseph Soloveitchik. According to Goldy, American Jewry remained in the theological dol- drums until the late 1940s. As observed by Samuel Cohon, Eugene Boro- witz, and Milton Himmelfarb, "there were Jewish theological seminaries with no theology" (p. 7). Goldy reports that this antagonistic attitude toward theology has been attributed to several sources: the American prag- matic tradition, ignorance of the European and classical languages of theo- logy, preoccupation with the welfare of a young community, exposure to modern naturalism and secularism, and an indigenous preference for prac-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 353 tice over theory. By 1959, however, David Silverman could declare that "we are in the midst of a theological renaissance" (cited on p. 43). Goldy reports that the literature of the period attributed the change to several factors. Postwar disillusionment with secular optimism and universalism bred a "spiritual hunger" and "search for transcendence." A third generation of Jews was concerned to reappropriate the traditions and values relinquished by the second generation. An emergent generation of rabbi-theologians established new Jewish journals to stimulate theological dicussion. Emigre intellectuals introduced the new existentialist trends in European thought. Perhaps most significantly, Jewish thinkers were stimulated by the revival of Protestant theology in the United States, as introduced by Paul Tillich and, in particular, by Reinhold Niebuhr. Herberg is in many ways the hero of Goldy's book, the one whose conversion back to Judaism led him to argue, first and most forcefully, that what had happened to him should happen to us all. This makes Niebuhr another hero, since Niebuhr's Moral Man and Immoral Society converted Herberg to neo-Orthodoxy the way that the Yom Kippur service converted Franz Rosenzweig. Goldy's book is strongest as a microhistory of the New Theology move- ment; most colorful in its descriptions of the Rabbinical Assembly audiences and liberal essayists who sought to ignore or actively resist the new theologi- ans' calls for renewed theological activity. The book's second contribution is to identify the movement's most significant features. Goldy suggests that, as displayed prototypically in Herberg's work, the New Jewish Theology called for a return from a science- and philosophy-centered study of religion to a God- and Bible-centered study. It was a reminder of human sinfulness and of the need for repentance. A crisis theology, it emerged from out of a post- war generation's loss of faith in the positivisms of modernity, and it identi- fied Judaism itself as a religion born of the crises that have marked Israel's history. Its categories thus emerged from out of Israel's own history, framed by the language of the Bible and by Hebraic categories of understanding. Its philosophic language was existentialist, and its theological discourse was dialectical, emphasizing the paradoxical character of religious experience and the dynamic and dramatic character of humanity's relationship with God. Goldy notes how, following Tillich's rather than Karl Barth's form of neo-orthodoxy, Heschel, Fackenheim, and Soloveitchik sought ways of establishing a partnership between their biblical or rabbinic theologies and general philosophy and culture. In Goldy's view, Heschel sought to main-</page><page sequence="3">354 BOOK REVIEWS tain a healthy dialectic between his subjective "depth theology" and the descriptive inquiries of ordinary theology. Fackenheim sought to correlate religious immediacy and critical reflection, mediated by a critically informed midrashic mode of thinking. Soloveitchik offered a subtle, "neohalakhic theology" as his way of delivering the "kerygma of faith" to the modern "man [or woman] of culture." In his brief concluding comments, Goldy suggests that American Jewish theologians have failed to stimulate in practice the mediation of faith and public culture they have articulated so well in theory. He also suggests that the new Jewish theologians' religious existentialism provides the grounding for an enduring practice of Jewish theology. I believe that Goldy's second suggestion could stand some revision in light of the first. Enduring Jewish theologies have been grounded in enduring canons of reason, capable of guiding institutional as well as intellectual development. Among these canons have been syncretized versions of Neoplatonism, Aristotelianism, and then modern liberalism or Kantianism. Twentieth-century existential- ism signals the demise of the modern canon but does not by itself guide the development of a postmodern canon. Today's Jewish hermeneutical theolo- gians are turning, instead, to postexistential as well as postmodern philoso- phical and literary sources: for example, Gadamerian and related hermeneu- tics, semiotics and literary pragmatics, deconstruction, critical theory, and varieties of feminist criticism, all applied to theories of textuality and of text-based ethics. However polyphonous contemporary discourse may sound to modern ears, it is not the sound of unreason, but only of a new her- meneutical canon of reason. As Jewish theologians participate more self- consciously in this canon, their work will begin to acquire institutional as well as intellectual power. Their work will also, by the way, begin to reveal its connectedness to previous canons. Peter Ochs Drew University Madison, N.J.</page></plain_text>
