<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nechama Tec. Defiance: The Bielski Partisans. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. xiii, 276 pp. Tuvia Bielski became famous as a resistance hero fighting successfully against the terrors of the Nazi Third Reich in the early 1940s. From his base of operations in the Nalibocka Forest (primarily) in western Belorussia,</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 459 he helped organize and led the largest armed Jewish self-help otriad in the rescue of Jews in World War II. In 1945 he settled in Eretz Israel, where he remained until 1956. Unassuming, without formal education, and totally apolitical, he never aspired to political or military leadership there, nor, in the postwar years, did he attain more than average financial success, working as a cab driver and then as a truck owner. Hunted by Nazis, vilified by Russian partisans, cursed by Belorussian and Polish antisemites, this fearless Jewish leader was envisioned by his brigade of forest Jews as a Bar Kochba, a Maccabee, a King David on horseback. Nonetheless, at the time of his death in Brooklyn, New York, in 1987, he was virtually forgotten by large segments of world Jewry. Nechama Tec, University of Connecticut sociologist and Shoah survivor, hopes to change this by bringing to light the untold story of Bielski's larger-than-life heroics and the accomplishments of his partisan brigade, a project inspired and encouraged by her previous work on righteous Christians who saved Jews. The incidents described here fit together with her own Shoah memoirs, Dry Tears (New York, 1982); her book on Polish rescuers and Jewish survivors, When Light Pierced Darkness: Christian Rescue of Jews in Nazi-Occupied Poland (New York, 1986); and the story of Brother Daniel, a Jew by birth and Catholic by religion, who passed as half German and half Polish and saved hundreds of Jews and Christians, In the Lion's Den: The Life of Oswald Rufeisen (New York, 1990). Like a multilayered matrushka doll, Tec's nonfiction is not only about altruism but about the emotional and conceptual longing that occurred before, during, and after the act of rescue. As a slice of history in behavioral terms, Defiance does not feel dated, like a museum curio. The informants, most of whom are survivors of the Bielski brigade, express their interest in group organization and discipline very directly-most explicitly in their accounts of the building of a forest community and of the group's daring escape from a major German assault during the "big hunt" (summer 1943); and as a result their story, while admittedly daring, is not unusual. The informants' contribution-the yin and yang of destruction and destiny, of evil and good-is not exactly a novel either, yet it remains interesting because Tec's prose, halting at times but well-spirited, is admirable. What is unparalleled, however, is the book's pivotal query-in a time of horrific distress and distrust, what constitutes Jewish concern for others? and</page><page sequence="3">460 BOOK REVIEWS its central philosophy-the Jew as victim and rescuer. It is not hard to be moved, on the one hand, by the ethical paradox posed by Bielski's credible conviction, "It is more important to save one Jew than to kill twenty Germans," and on the other, by the passionate scream of a seventy-five-year-old Jewish partisan when he killed a captured SS man, "God, my grandfather was not a murderer, my father was not a murderer, but I will be a murderer." In the whole of Jewish history, there has been no more murderous an age, no period more villainous for the Jew, than the Shoah. With so much that is painful to remember-dislocation, despair, death-the generation after Auschwitz is one in which forgetting is fundamental. Yet, paradoxically, we occupy a time of ethnic cleansing and tribally administered mass death, and for this reason we are unable to close our eyes, cover our ears, and comfort our conscience. We are obligated to confront our shameful amnesia by hearing the victim's cry, "Do not forget," and Tec's book makes clear and distinct the voices of ordinary men and women who contributed to this clarion call. To follow the fate of memories of atrocity to self-preservation to rescue, Tec does her local-history homework, conducts numerous interviews with as many participants and apologists as will speak to her, and allows us to catch an accusation here, a confession there-through the usual stages of denial, explanation and counterclaim, sordid recollection, recognition and acceptance. Also, her sensitive portrayal of the rise and fall of Tuvia Bielski as a charismatic authority figure is insightful and sound. Regrettably, there are several errors in transmission: Lanham, Maryland, not New York (note 13, p. 225); Encyclopaedia (not Encyclopedia) Judaica (pp. 208, 227, 228); and Har Hamnuchot, not Haar Hmnuchot (p. 261), in Jerusalem, final resting place of Bielski. Yet it is evident that the author is thoroughly conversant with her subject. Readers may find themselves looking with new respect at Jewish morality, compassion, and self-regard under fire.
