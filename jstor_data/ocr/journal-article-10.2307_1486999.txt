Cambridge, Mass., Harvard Uni- versity Press, 1988. vii, 232 pp. In his full study of the life and literary production of one individual, Abraham Yagel (1553-ca. 1623), David Ruderman succeeds in creating a penetrating and insightful description of the intellectual currents among Italian Jewry during the late Renaissance and the Baroque period. The main title of this book may suggest--especially in light of popular notions of Italian Jewish history as well as of Kabbalah, magic, and science-that the book is about marginal or exotic aspects of Jewish life. However, Ruderman establishes conclusively that the major Jewish figures of the period, influenced by trends in the general Renaissance, pursued Kabblah, magic, and science (which then included medicine, nature, astronomy, astrology, chiromancy, demonology, metempsychosis, and theology) and that they did so as an expression of their attachment to traditional rabbinic values and practices. Moreover, Ruderman has carefully traced the interconnectedness between religion, science, and the occult during this period, showing how they are related in Yagel's writings. In addition, he successfully challenges long-standing assumptions that these categories themselves accurately reflect much more complex intellectual currents. Ruderman aserts that Gei Hizzayon, a detailed autobiographical account by Yagel of his misfortunes, was an unprecedented attempt at auto- biography in premodern Hebrew literature, and he argues that it reflected a growing awareness of self. He also describes this work as a "partial auto- biography" (p. 10), an "imaginary heavenly journey" (p. 76), a "mysterious romance" (p. 76), "in a manner transparently reminiscent of Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy," and "his fantastic heavenly odyssey" (p. 12). In his multiple characterizations of Gei Iizzayon, Ruderman commendably identifies an important stage in the development of Jewish autobiography. Many of the very features that might lead one to think that it is not an auto- biography, such as descriptions of dreams, discussions with the dead, and adventures of the soul outside the body, are in fact also found in Leon Modena's seventeenth-century Hayyei Yehudah, often called the first Hebrew autobiography. Moreover, it is these inventive aspects which must be considered essential to an autobiography.' Many other features of Gei 1. See the essays in Mark R. Cohen's The Autobiography of a Seventeenth-Century Venetian</page><page sequence="2">230 BOOK REVIEWS Hizzayon reveal the growing sense of self during this period in Jewish history that led to the writing of Jewish autobiographies. These include the ethical will (of Yagel's father) with which it begins, the extensive discussion of mun- dane personal events such as business transactions, the attempt to discuss matters of personal emotional concern such as premature death and birth defects, and the relation of picaresque stories, often in the first person and presented as a confession, which seem to be as much a product of fantasy as reality. Beyond their pioneering attempts at writing Hebrew autobiographies, Yagel's and Modena's lives are amazingly similar in many areas, specifically those that have led scholars to place them at the periphery of Jewish life: Yagel was often dismissed as an apostate-for no valid reason according to Ruderman; and Modena was dismissed as a heretic-also for no valid reason. Both men's lives were marked by "financial failures, unreliable business partnerships, constant anxiety, and severe loss of time" (p. 18). Both were concerned with a wide range of illnesses, especially "melan- cholia": Yagel as a professional physician and Modena as a professional patient. Very few of either man's major works were published in his lifetime, and the works that were published were of "limited scope" and importance, though not without significance as regards their attempts to popularize Judaism. Yagel wrote a summary of the principles of Judaism for children, Leqah Tov, based on a Catholic catechism. Similarly, Modena, in preparing his published aids for Jewish education, borrowed from popular magic, remedies, riddles, and mnemonic techniques. He also translated into Hebrew and revised the best-selling Christian ethical work Fior di Virtu for Jewish audiences. In general, both tried to harmonize Jewish teachings with non-Jewish learning. Ruderman explicitly mentions the similarity between Yagel's efforts in this direction and Modena's explanation that God rebuked Job for neglecting the study of nature (p. 72). A major difference between Modena and Yagel, which is crucial to Ruderman's book, is that Modena challenged those Jews who believed in gilgul, metempsychosis or the transmigration of souls. Yagel, on the other hand, asserted that this belief was a cardinal principle of Judaism, though the idea that a human soul could transmigrate to animals was obnoxious to Rabbi: Leon Modena's "Life of Judah" (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1988), especially the one by Natalie Davis (also cited by Ruderman, p. 174, n. 35).</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 231 him. Ruderman's analysis of the broader context of Yagel's discussions about gilgul rings true for everything we know about Modena as well. Cen- tral to both men's discussions is the fact that metempsychosis was rejected by the church. Modena deleted references to gilgul from his revised version of the Riti in 1638 following a close brush with the Venetian Inquisition when the first edition was published in Paris in 1637. The Catholic rejection of metempsychosis, as well as its enthusiastic adoption by Lurianic Kab- balah (a school of Kabbalah not really central to either Modena or Yagel), may have been enough of an incentive for Modena to reject this belief. Ruderman shows convincingly that Yagel's discussion of the temporary transmigration of souls to animals was influenced by the Catholic idea of purgatory, while at the same time he associated purgatory with the rabbinic idea of gehinom. In Kabbalah, Magic, and Science, Ruderman expertly draws on a wide range of the scientific, religious, and occult literature of the period and gracefully makes use of many unpublished manuscripts. The translated cita- tions from these long-neglected texts are lucid and tantalizing. Ruderman's analysis reflects a thorough and judicious use of recent scholarship in all these fields. The copious references in the notes to manuscripts and to pri- mary and secondary materials are a tribute to Ruderman's thoroughness as a scholar. This book not only elevates Yagel from his position as a "curious footnote" to "the long history of creative encounters between Judaism and Western civilization"; it also shows Ruderman's own scholarship as an impressive result of this encounter. We therefore eagerly look forward to his soon-to-be-published complete translation and analysis of Yagel's Gei .Hizzayon. Howard Adelman Smith College Northampton, Mass.</page></plain_text>
