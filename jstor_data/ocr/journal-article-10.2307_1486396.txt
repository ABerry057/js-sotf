<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JEWISH ELITE AND THE CHILDREN OF THE POOR: JEWISH APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS IN NINETEENTH-CENTURY FRANCE by LEE SHAI WEISSBACH The desire of the Franco-Jewish elite to foster the acculturation of French Jewry during the nineteenth century is a theme that has been explored in considerable detail in recent years. Historians of French Jewry have described the development of an ideology that identified Judaism primarily as a religion, have analyzed the attempts of various communal institutions to mitigate Jewish distinctiveness, and have demonstrated that the leaders of French Jewry adopted a policy of social integration both because they were attracted to the mainstream culture of France and because they felt that acculturation was the implied price of empancipation.

He also wishes to thank the Arts and Sciences Research Committee and the Graduate Research Council at the University of Louisville for their support of the research on which this article is based. 123</page><page sequence="2">124 LEE SHAI WEISSBACH One important element in the integrationist policy of the Franco-Jewish elite was its effort to promote the "regeneration" of the Jewish lower classes and encourage their occupational diversification. To accomplish this end, the leaders of the Franco-Jewish community initiated a variety of projects to influence poor Jewish youths to reject a life of street hawking and peddling, acquire an education, and enter "useful" professions. The efforts of the Jewish elite to promote acculturation and economic productiveness among the children of the poor have frequently been men- tioned by historians of French Jewry, but their analyses of these efforts have always been presented solely in terms of the internal concerns of the French Jewish community. Rarely has Jewish scholarship taken notice of the larger milieu of French social action in which Jewish social action took place, and never have Jewish programs for the children of the poorer classes been discussed in the larger context of French philanthropic activity generally. Indeed, the literature of Franco-Jewish history conveys the distinct impres- sion that promoting the moral reform of the lower classes by providing apprenticeship training was a uniquely Jewish innovation.' The efforts of the Franco-Jewish elite to promote the regeneration of the Jewish poor cannot be evaluated fully, however, if they are viewed only from a Jewish perspective. That is why this article seeks to reappraise the apprenticeship 1. The most extensive treatment of Jewish apprenticeship training to date mentions non- Jewish efforts to aid apprentices in only one brief paragraph about Protestant projects, and in that paragraph their role is seriously misrepresented; see Zosa Szajkowski, "Yiddishe fachshulen in Frankreich in 19th yahrhundert," Yivo Bletter 42 (1962): 81-120. Patrick Girard, Les Juifs de France de 1789 c 1860 (Paris, 1976), p. 119, states that it was "the particular struc- ture of the Jewish population" which accounts for its involvement in the training of the lower classes, "even though the diffusion of education among the poor classes was not the most ardent desire of the 19th-century bourgeoisie." Most of the works which mention Jewish apprenticeship projects convey the impression that these projects were unique by discussing them only in reference to Jewish communal concerns; see, for example, Lbon Berman, Histoire des Juifs de France (Paris, 1937), p. 407; Zosa Szajkowski, "Occupational Problems of Jewish Emancipation in France, 1789-1800," Historia Judaica 21 (1959): 127-129; idem, Jewish Education in France, 1789-1939 (New York, 1980), pp. 15-16; Jonathan Isaac Helfand, "French Jewry during the Second Republic and Second Empire (1848-1870)" (Ph.D. diss., Yeshiva University, 1979), pp. 139-143; Nancy Lascoe Green, "Class Struggle in the Pletzl: Jewish Immigrant Workers in Paris, 1881-1914" (Ph.D. diss., University of Chicago, 1980), pp. 175 ff; Michael Graetz, Ha-Periferyah haytah le-markaz: perakim be-toldot Yahadut Tsorfat ba-me'ah ha-tesha' 'esreh (Jerusalem, 1982), pp. 65-71. Even those rare studies that do not totally disregard the French context in which Jewish social action took place make only fleeting references to it: compare Michael Marrus, The Politics of Assimilation: The French Jewish Community at the Time of the Dreyfus Affair (Oxford, 1971), p. 79; and Phyllis Cohen Albert, The Modernization of French Jewry: Consistory and Community in the Nineteenth Century (Hanover, N.H., 1977), p. 136.</page><page sequence="3">JEWISH ELITE AND CHILDREN OF THE POOR 125 programs of the nineteenth-century Jewish community by placing them within the larger framework of French social action generally. This study will review the history of Jewish apprenticeship projects in France, explore the question of the uniqueness of those projects, and ultimately demonstrate that only in a larger French context can the policy of the Franco-Jewish elite toward the children of the poor be understood completely. The concern of the Jewish elite with the vocational training of poor Jewish youths had its origins very early in the post-emancipation era, and at the beginning of the nineteenth century a variety of efforts to encourage apprenticeship were already being undertaken by Jewish communal leaders. As early as 1810 the welfare committee of the consistoire of Paris decided to devote funds to support the apprenticeship of poor Jewish children, and this policy was also adopted by consistorial bodies elsewhere in France in the early decades of the century. In several communities (in Bordeaux and Metz, for example) there were attempts to tie industrial arts training and the encouragement of apprenticeship into the emerging system of Jewish primary and elementary schools. The most significant efforts to foster Jewish vocational training, however, were initiated by societies founded for the express purpose of encouraging the children of the poor to undertake apprenticeships. Organ- ized by well-established individuals in many Jewish communities, and often called socidtcs de patronage, the earliest of these institutions tended to have rather limited functions. They did little more than act as intermediaries between poor Jewish families and skilled masters and provide subsidies to Jewish apprentices or to their parents. In their fully developed form, however, these societies undertook a much wider range of activities. They not only helped the poor conclude apprenticeship contracts for their children, but they also monitored the progress of the children and provided them with formal classes to supplement their training in the shop. In addi- tion to subsidizing the apprentices they placed, they also sponsored social gatherings and awarded prizes for accomplishments in craftsmanship and scholarship. Sometimes socidtis de patronage even provided housing for the children they supported and assisted them after their apprenticeships were completed with loans for the purchase of tools and with ongoing social and educational activities. The earliest socidtis de patronage within the Jewish community were established in the 1820s, and by midcentury they had appeared in the major centers of Jewish population throughout France: in Bordeaux, Bayonne, Marseille, Metz, Nancy, Colmar. In 1825, the society for Jewish apprentices</page><page sequence="4">126 LEE SHAI WEISSBACH at Strasbourg established an icole de travail, a trade school that was in essence a boarding facility for apprentices who were receiving their practical training in individual shops. In 1842 a similar institution was opened at Mulhouse.2 In Paris, the earliest society organized for the specific purpose of encour- aging the apprenticeship of poor Jewish children was the Soci6t6 isral61ite des amis du travail. Founded in 1825, this society placed about one hundred apprentices in its first five years, but by the mid-1830s financial distress had forced it to cease operation. After 1835, the consistoire of Paris resumed some of its previous efforts on behalf of apprenticeship, and around 1850 yet another independent institution was organized under the leadership of Albert Cohn to foster vocational training. This was the Soci6t6 des jeunes gargons isral61ites de Paris. In 1853 the recently established Soci6t6 des jeunes gargons absorbed the program of evening classes that Dr. Manuel Leven and Chief Rabbi Isidor had started for apprentices and young laborers a few years earlier, and thus it evolved into the Soci6t6 de patronage des apprentis et ouvriers isral61ites de Paris, the first full-fledged socicdtd de patronage of the Paris Jewish community.3 In the late 1850s and early 1860s, the Soci6t6 de patronage des apprentis isral61ites oversaw the apprenticeship of some forty or fifty youngsters annually, and in 1865 it further expanded its activities by opening an Jcole de travail modeled on those at Strasbourg and Mulhouse. The dcole de travail at Paris, designed primarily for children without parents or from broken homes, was housed first at 10 rue des Singes, then at 10 rue des Guillemittes, and finally, from 1876, at 4 bis rue des Rosiers (where its successor, now operated by ORT, is still in operation today). In 1878, the number of apprentices sponsored by the Soci~t6 de patronage des apprentis israelites stood at sixty, and the number continued to grow each year; at the beginning of 1887, for example, the society was sponsoring ninety-five 2.

Named for its benefactors, the Fondation Bischoffsheim had already admitted 152 girls by 1878.5 All the efforts undertaken by the Franco-Jewish elite in favor of appren- ticeship training were intended, of course, to do much more than teach the children of the Jewish poor a trade. To the leaders of the Jewish community, rigindration meant not only industrial training, but also moral reform; they viewed apprenticeship programs as instruments for reshaping the very character of poor Jewish youths. As Chief Rabbi Zadok Kahn indicated when he addressed Paris' Jewish apprentices on Hanukkah in 1872, being "good workers" also meant being "good Jews and useful citizens."6 Thus the work of patronage involved the inculcation of values as much as it involved the teaching of vocational skills. The men and women who organized apprenticeship programs wanted to be sure that the youngsters they were assisting developed a positive attitude toward labor and an understanding of thrift. They wanted to instill in the apprentices under their protection a measure of self-discipline, a respect for their patrons, and a patriotic loyalty to France. They also wanted to en- courage their young charges to reject the lifestyle of the lower classes and learn to appreciate the glories of French culture. In short, they wanted to create future generations of adults who would be "virtuous, intelligent, and hard-working."7 Those within the Jewish community who participated in the work of patronage recognized that gentile images of the Jew were often based on impressions of the manners and morals of the Jewish underclasses, and they knew that even though they were leaders in their own community they would never achieve social respectability as long as negative images of 4.

Thus the Jewish elite hoped that its efforts on behalf of the Jewish poor would redound to its own benefit as well. But there remains the question of the uniqueness of Jewish programs to encourage industrial training and moral reform. Were these programs innovative responses to a particularly Jewish social situation, as much of the Jewish historiography would lead us to believe, or is there a more complex explanation for their development? In order to probe this question further, it is useful to consider the general state of apprenticeship in France during the nineteenth century. At the beginning of the century, the institution of apprenticeship was entering a period of crisis. The French Revolution had dismantled the corporate structure of the Old Regime, and in doing so it had destroyed the basis on which traditional apprenticeship had rested. Of course apprentices continued to be placed with masters throughout the nineteenth century, but the disappearance of guilds and the advent of industrialization meant that the quality of apprenticeship training in individual craftshops could no longer be guaranteed. With traditional apprenticeship in decline, interest in alternative systems of vocational training intensified, and a new emphasis was placed on industrial arts education in the classroom. Before long, technical training courses were being developed by various government agencies (usually at the local level), by industrialists' societies, by chambers of commerce, and even by individual firms. Among the most active sponsors of vocational education in France were the Frbres des 6coles chr~tiennes, a teaching order that had long been offering manual arts instruction to poor children. In the early nineteenth century, the Frbres greatly expanded their existing programs and began offering evening trade courses for working youths and adults; by 1863 they had twenty thousand pupils under the age of fourteen and four thousand adult students in Paris alone. The early nineteenth century also witnessed the proliferation of dcoles de dessin (schools of design) and of icoles des arts et mdtiers (arts and crafts schools). These specialized institutions, some sponsored by governmental bodies and some privately funded, also answered the need for new forms of technical education. The dcoles de dessin usually offered supplementary afternoon and evening classes, while the dcoles des arts et mitiers had more extensive programs, often based on that of the pioneering school founded in 1786 by the Duc de La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt. In that school about one hundred boys had been housed and taught basic subjects such as reading, writing, and arithmetic, as well as trades such as tailoring, shoemaking, and carpentry. As early as 1810, there were successful dcoles de dessin in at least</page><page sequence="7">JEWISH ELITE AND CHILDREN OF THE POOR 129 eleven French cities, including Strasbourg and Mulhouse. Under the July Monarchy, the trade school that had developed out of the &amp;cole de dessin at Mulhouse became a model for &amp;coles des arts et mitiers throughout Europe. In Paris, the most important Catholic trade school of the period, the Ecole Saint-Nicholas, opened its doors in 1827, and soon the municipal government too began sponsoring a vocational education network at the secondary level. The first technical training school established by the muni- cipality was the Ecole Turgot, founded in 1839; by 1889 the municipal vocational education network comprised twelve schools, each specializing in a specific group of artisanal trades. By midcentury, the French national government was deeply involved in the issue of apprenticeship training as well. In the mid-1860s, the government conducted an extensive inquiry into vocational education, for example, and after 1882 it began requiring manual arts instruction in all French primary schools. But the transfer of vocational training to the classroom was not the only response to the crisis of apprenticeship in nineteenth-century France. Some leaders of French society concerned about industrial education believed that training in the craftshop offered certain advantages over training in the classroom, and that it should not be abandoned. From their positions of influence within the haute bourgeoisie and the old aristocracy, they were able to take measures to try to improve the nature of traditional apprenticeship and guarantee its survival. They lobbied for legislation to regulate appren- ticeship contracts, for example (an Apprenticeship Law was indeed enacted in 1851), and they organized societies to promote traditional artisanship and to protect and assist apprentices in the craftshop; they organized socidtis de patronage.8 So none of the institutional structures employed by the Jewish communi- ty in its efforts to foster vocational training was of a uniquely Jewish character. The work with children in Jewish communal schools, the evening classes for Jewish workers, the Jewish trade schools at Strasbourg and at Mulhouse-all these were based on preexisting models and had equivalents in French society at large. And the sociutis de patronage of the Jewish community had non-Jewish parallels as well. Catholic and Protestant 8.

In 1866, for instance, the first socidtks de patronage organized along craft lines were founded (one in cabinetmaking, one in artificial flower production, and one in wallpaper manufacturing), and in the 1880s nonsectarian societies to serve youths in individual arrondisse- ments proliferated. By the end of the century, there were literally hundreds of sociktis de patronage in France, each targeting a particular group of young people.9 In their basic programs, the various societis de patronage in France were remarkably similar to each other. Regardless of their sponsorship, all apprenticeship projects acted in the first instance as agencies for the place- ment of poor youngsters. The societies helped parents negotiate contracts, they subsidized apprentices, and they carefully followed the progress of the young people under their protection. They also provided supplementary evening classes, organized competitions, and directed recreational activities. And many sociktis de patronage, like the Soci6t6 de patronage des apprentis isral61ites in Paris, maintained their own facilities where their various pro- grams could be conducted and where some apprentices might be housed. For example, the venerable Soci6t6 des amis de l'enfance, one of the oldest Catholic socidtis de patronage in Paris, was renowned for its "maison de famille," where some of its charges were lodged, and where others could find "at any hour of the day or night . . . a shelter when their shop is idle, care when they are sick, fresh clothing each week, and a place to spend Sunday."'0 The structural similarities between Jewish and non-Jewish socidtis de 9. In 1873, there were already some three hundred patronage societies in the country, serving about eighty thousand children; see Annales de l'Assemblde nationale.: Compte-rendu in extenso des slances 40 (Paris, 1873): 517 (February 3, 1873).

Manuel des oeuvres (1852), p. 33.</page><page sequence="9">JEWISH ELITE AND CHILDREN OF THE POOR 131 patronage is nicely illustrated by a comparison of the official programs of Jewish and non-Jewish projects. For example, the Oeuvre des apprentis et jeunes ouvriers, one of the most prominent Catholic societis de patronage of the nineteenth century, articulated the following goals: 1. To place children with trustworthy and able masters when they leave school, and to watch over them during the period of their apprenticeship; 2. To open evening schools for children employed in shops and factories when they finish work, and to bring them together during the day on Sunday under the supervision of the Frdres. Apprentices and young laborers find religious services and instruction at these gatherings, and recreation. Every three months prizes are awarded to the most accomplished, and relief to the most needy." And this is how the Soci~t6 de patronage des apprentis israelites de Paris defined its purposes: 1. To encourage apprenticeship training among the children of poor Jews in the city of Paris, and particularly of those who leave the Jewish primary schools; 2. To assist them with a monthly subvention; 3. To watch over them in an active and benevolent manner; 4. To furnish them the opportunity to complete their instruction and educa- tion, by means of regularly established evening courses; 5. To keep track of those young people who become workers, and sustain them with its patronage.'2 Even more significant than the structural similarities between Jewish apprenticeship programs and others, however, is the similarity in their goals of social reform. Gentile sponsors of apprenticeship programs, like Jewish sponsors, wanted to do much more than provide high-quality industrial training; they too made the connection between vocational education and the moral reform of the lower classes. In the early industrial period, many in the upper and middle classes of French society felt threatened by the large numbers of the poor in their midst, and by their "culture of poverty." The perennial question sociale of the nineteenth century was what to do about the poor; and those who began to confront this question recognized that 11. Ibid., p. 34. 12.

Further- more, non-Jewish philanthropists, like their Jewish counterparts, believed that one of the best ways to ameliorate the condition of the poor and integrate them into society was to make their children productive citizens adhering to a system of values acceptable to the dominant elites. Children were, after all, more the victims of poverty than its cause, and thus they were not only more deserving of the solicitude of the privileged classes, but also more likely to respond to it. As Armand de Melun, the patriarch of the Catholic patronage movement, observed, "It is through childhood that God renders centuries corrigible, and nations susceptible to healing."'3 So non-Jews as well as Jews argued that providing sound technical train- ing for the working classes could "reaffirm the basis of our society,"'4 and non-Jewish philanthropists in the patronage movement, like their Jewish counterparts, spoke of the "rigindration sociale" of the poorer classes.'5 Christian apprenticeship societies argued just as strongly as Jewish societies that theirs was "not only an oeuvre industrielle, .. . but also an oeuvre morale." 6 Moreover, the similarity between Jewish and non-Jewish appren- ticeship programs went far beyond a superficial identity of motivation, for it involved a very large measure of agreement on the central question of what values the children of the poor needed to be taught. In fact, there seemed to be agreement between Jews and non-Jews on an entire system of values to be instilled in the hearts and minds of poor apprentices. To the supporters of patronage within the Jewish community, one of the most important things apprenticeship projects could do was teach the necessity and the value of "useful" labor. The Soci6t6 de patronage des apprentis isral61ites in Paris spoke of allaying its apprentices' "fear of work," and convincing them "that peoples, like individuals, develop themselves only through ceaseless labor.""' The president of the Jewish socikte de patronage at Nancy declared that "manual labor is, as much so as intellec- tual labor, an instrument of emancipation and prosperity.'""' And Chief 13.

Rabbi Marx complained that "it is precisely that class of society which has the greatest need of work . . . that has for the longest time resisted this premier obligation of man." He urged his young listeners to maintain a positive attitude toward labor, observing that work was a "great law of humanity."19 But non-Jewish communal leaders were just as concerned about the reluctance of the poor to enter "productive" professions; they too stressed the importance of instilling a work ethic among the lower classes. Indeed, they spoke in terms strikingly similar to those used by the Jewish elite. Armand de Melun, for example, told an assembly of apprentices in 1853 that Work is not sufficiently appreciated even by those who spend all their time at it; often they submit to it as a penitence, they curse it as an injustice; and yet, when it is sanctified with prayer and made moral with virtue, work is one of the most magnificent gifts that heaven has bestowed on earth.20 "Work! Oh! May this word arouse in us no prejudice and no repugnance!" cried another president of a Catholic apprenticeship society.21 And yet another patronage leader (echoing Rabbi Marx) insisted that "man is made to labor as the bird is made to fly and the fish to swim. Labor is, to be sure, a law of the world."22 Thrift, it should be added, was seen as the essential complement to labor. Thus, while Manuel Leven was exhorting the Jewish apprentices of Paris to "be thrifty, save a part of your salary every day," Paul Decaux was explaining that within his Catholic patronage, "it is taught that one must conserve by economizing, just as it is taught that one must earn by working."23 All the philanthropists of the patronage movement also agreed that the children of the poor should be encouraged to develop a sense of self- discipline. The Jewish apprentices of Bayonne were asked to "have a high 19. "Soci6t6 protectrice ... de Bayonne," pp. 4-5. 20.

E. Cacheux, the author of a comprehensive report on patronage, observed that "young men have passions they must learn to control," and the director of a Catholic societeF de patronage at Orl6ans complained that among the various problems his project had faced over the years, "the inconstancy of youth" was "alas! the most persistent."25 The necessity of teaching poor apprentices a certain amount of deference and obedience was another matter on which all the supporters of patronage found agreement. Even though Jewish orators could proclaim that "the interests of the master and the worker are the same," and their non-Jewish counterparts could speak of "breaking down the walls of separation between the classes,"26 it was clear that the haute bourgeois and aristocratic men and women who directed the work of patronage did not envision a society based on social and economic equality. Rather they had in mind an idealized corporate society in which social and economic stability would be guaranteed. Apprentices were certainly expected to accept their place in the social order and to acknowledge their debt to those who aided them. Thus Virgile Leon praised the Jewish apprentices of Bayonne for being "submis- sive and respectful toward their protectors,"27 and the Jewish apprentices of Metz were reminded of their status each time they sang their hymn of thanks to God: You have led me to encounter, for the guidance of my youth, Generous men whose protecting care Preserves me from evil, extricates me from indolence, And provides me with work to escape my misfortune.28 Christian reformers delivered the same message about deference.

"It is necessity, it is reason," came the reply. And this idea was reinforced with yet another: "religious precept makes of obedience a virtue."'29 If all supporters of patronage wanted the children of the poor to learn gratitude and devotion to those of higher social rank, they wanted them also to learn loyalty to their country. Historians of nineteenth-century French Jewry have tended to identify the patriotism of the Franco-Jewish elite with its desire to demonstrate how well integrated into French life the newly emancipated Jewish community had become, and there is certainly truth in this analysis. But patriotism was in fact a value emphasized in the patronage movement generally, with both Jewish and non-Jewish orators stressing to young apprentices the connection between their own industrial training and their ability to serve their country. "Your place is marked out in the pacific army of industry," Melun told the apprentices of his society in 1850. "Your aptitude, your perseverance, will contribute to France's maintaining ... the respect that she is due in the world."30 The same point was made by Manuel Leven of the Soci6t6 de patronage des apprentis israelites when he insisted that "true patriotism" lay in helping strengthen France's economic position vis-t-vis foreign competitors.3' Because the patronage movement was attempting to reshape the very sensibilities of the children of the poorer classes, a part of its campaign of rigindration involved protecting poor children from what the dominant classes perceived as the vulgarities of popular culture. It was important, related an article in the Archives isradlites, to guard young apprentices from "the dangerous promiscuities of the workshop, to shelter their eyes and their ears from sights and conversations that may corrupt their hearts and taint their perceptions."32 And it was important also to protect the children of the poor "from the dangers of the street and from vagabondage,"33 both of which the Jewish elite must have associated with the itinerant trades they so despised. But non-Jewish philanthropists from the privileged classes also worried about the negative influences of the shop floor and of the street. 29. Poterat, Patronage, p. 24. 30.

The "final piece of advice" given Jewish youngsters completing their apprenticeships in Paris in 1886 was to stay away from caf6s and cabarets, "the two scourges of working-class society."35 And when the Catholic patronage activist Paul Decaux described the achievements of his institution, he announced proudly that the youngsters under its influence "resist the unfortunate habit of the small glass and the large bock"; and that "they fear the turbulence of the dance, the jostling of the theater pit, the suffocating atmosphere of the upper gallery."36 Indeed, so concerned were the leaders of the patronage movement with the influences of the culture of poverty that they did not fully trust even the parents of the youngsters they were attempting to help. They believed that many poor families were incapable of raising their own children. The founders of the Soci6t6 de patronage des apprentis israelites noted that in initiating their work they had had to overcome "the inertia" and the "totally unjustified mistrust" of working-class parents, and the leaders of the society expressed concern about those youths who "find within their families only pernicious examples and perverted sentiments."'37 Similarly, Cacheux observed that apprenticeship societies were often called upon to combat parental "stupidity and ignorance," and individual philanthropists, such as the founder of the societeF de patronage in cabinetmaking, berated parents for sending their children out to earn a few centimes rather than providing for their proper vocational training.38 34.

The task of "directing the tastes"39" of young apprentices also included exposing them to the more refined elements of French civiliza- tion. Thus the Fondation Bischoffsheim offered its students courses in gymnastics, dance, voice, sewing, and music, as well as in more fundamental subjects. On Saturday afternoons, after synagogue services, the boys of the icole de travail in Paris were taken on outings to public parks, or to museums and galleries such as those of the Louvre and the Conservatoire des arts et m6tiers.40 In much the same way, the nondenominational appren- tice society in Paris' 6th arrondissement offered its youngsters lessons in voice, violin, diction, and fencing. And the society for apprentices in the 17th arrondissement conducted trips to the Louvre, Cluny, the Luxembourg Palace, the Conservatoire des arts et m6tiers, and other sites, in order to "educate" the children entrusted to it "by showing them masterpieces of art and industry."41 Reading was recognized as an important vehicle for instilling values, and here again Jewish and non-Jewish organizations were of the same mind as to what should be read. The leaders of the Jewish patronage movement wanted their apprentices to be exposed to "good French authors" so that they could be weaned from "that vulgar language that runs rampant in the streets" and encouraged to acquire "a taste for serious reading."42 Likewise, Catholic apprentices were urged to read books containing "wholesome ideas and beneficial notions." These would replace "the images and impres- sions of those all-too-cheap books..,. that are the disgrace of literature and the most active agents of popular corruption."43 Jewish efforts to encourage reading among the children of the poor were so much in tune with non- Jewish efforts that in 1869 James de Rothschild was able to offer the library of the Soci6t6 de patronage des apprentis israelites as a model for libraries to be established by other apprenticeship societies. At the time that Rothschild described the library of the Jewish society, it contained 162 volumes consi- dered serious reading (including 42 volumes of history, 20 of travel litera- 39.

By far the most popular volumes in the library were the novels of Erckmann-Chatrian and those of Jules Verne. There were very few books of an essentially Jewish character in the collection.44 The various apprenticeship societies of nineteenth-century France were in fact so similar in nature that at times Jews and gentiles cooperated closely with each other in the work of patronage. Jewish youths sponsored by the socidtd de patronage in Paris participated alongside apprentices from other societies in competitions organized by sundry government agencies and trade associations, and Jewish youths attended the courses in design offered by the Paris municipality. The Soci6t6 de patronage des apprentis israelites in Paris and the Fondation Bischoffsheim both participated with a host of other apprenticeship projects in the various Universal Expositions of the late nineteenth century.45 So too, local non-Jewish youths were welcomed at the evening classes sponsored by the Soci6t6 de patronage des apprentis israelites, and in 1862 twelve of the eighteen nonboarding students at the Jewish dcole de travail in Strasbourg were Christians.46 Gentiles were among those who contributed to the fund-raising drives of Jewish apprenticeship programs. They also attended the annual awards ceremonies of Jewish societies, and praised the work of these institutions in print. One writer in 1845 contended that of the 423 sponsors of the Jewish apprenticeship project at Mulhouse, only 189 were Jews!47 Just as there were gentiles who supported apprenticeship programs organized to serve Jewish youths, there were also Jews who supported socidtis de patronage established outside their own community. For example, among the benefactors of the nonsectarian Soci6t6 de l'orphelinat de la Seine, which apprenticed orphans and abandoned children, the names of several important Parisian Jewish families were represented: Cr6mieux, Dreyfus, Lazard, Vidal, Goldschmidt, Rodrigue, Godchaux, Kahn, L6vy, 44.

Although recent historians have for the most part ignored the larger context of their work, nineteenth-century supporters of Jewish apprentice- ship projects seemed to be very much aware of their place within a more general patronage movement. Here, for example, is how the Soci~t6 de patronage des apprentis israelites de Paris described its own origins: In large cities, and above all in capital cities, like Paris, those men who concern themselves with popular education and training always realized the pressing need to extricate children from the dangers of the street and remove them from the thousands of petty trades ... This necessity was evident with the same clarity among the representatives of the Jewish Community... A' Of course, each individual socidtd de patronage in France was to a certain extent unique, and each had its own specific agenda. Every socidtd de patron- age affiliated with a religious denomination made some effort to promote its own faith and to instill a sense of pride and loyalty in the children under its supervision.

In the 1870s, the militantly Catholic patronage society under the presidency of Armand de Melun had to contend with political problems arising from its monarchist propagandizing, for example;"5 and the socidtd de patronage for apprentices in the cabinetmaking trade had to confront the widely recognized decline in the quality of French furniture.54 Thus, although it is important to recognize that Jewish apprenticeship projects occupied a place within a broader network of French philanthropy, it none- theless remains important to consider the specifically Jewish concerns of these projects. The fact that Jewish apprenticeship programs were repre- sentative of a whole genre of French philanthropic institutions in no way diminishes the significance of their specifically Jewish aspects. Indeed, the sponsors of Jewish apprenticeship programs, while they saw themselves as participants in the larger French enterprise of patronage, also understood that the situation of Jewish apprentices was in some ways quite different from that of other apprentices. French Jews were, after all, a newly emancipated minority in an essentially Christian society. Jewish orators frequently reminded the youngsters under their patronage that the many occupations closed to Jews under the Old Regime were now open to them. And always present in the minds of Jewish philanthropists was the need to dispel the image of the Jew as economic parasite.55 The 6cole de travail of Paris was praised for producing artisans who, "by wielding a plane or a chisel, defend Israel against the eternal reproach leveled against it, that it loathes manual labor."'56 Many a Jewish boy, like the fictional Isaie in the moralist novel of Rabbi Isaac L6vy, was told that by learning a trade "you render a service to yourself, [and] you render a service to your religion."57 There were also certain practical problems of a specifically Jewish character that Jewish projects of patronage had to address. For example, there was the issue of Sabbath observance. In Paris and in Bordeaux, 52. From the song "Notre Patronage," in Chants des patronages (Saint-Saulve [Nord], 1909), p. 27 53.

Jewish and gentile patronage activists perceived the culture of poverty in much the same way, and they were largely in agreement about how the value systems of the poor needed to be altered. Indeed, what Jewish patron- age philanthropists wanted to instill in their wards was not so much a Jewish value system as it was a French bourgeois value system. This is the reason that some Orthodox French Jews raised objections to the work of Jewish vocational training societies and schools.59 In establishing projects to pro- vide moral guidance and professional training for the children of the poor, the leaders of the Franco-Jewish community adopted both the institutional structures and the social action ideologies that weredeveloping in the large- ly Catholic society around them. And it might be added that the nineteenth-century Jewish elite was not much more successful in its efforts to remold the working classes and eradi- cate poverty than were non-Jewish communal leaders. Class antagonisms were not eliminated as a result of patronage; Jewish participation in the militant labor movement of the late nineteenth century attests to this. Nor was poverty eliminated. As soon as French Jews seemed on the verge of abandoning such occupations as peddling and street hawking (the percen- tage of Parisian Jews in "petit commerce" went from about 52 percent in 1809 to about 19 percent in 1872, for example),60 the problem of poverty within the Jewish community was once again exacerbated by the arrival of immigrants from Eastern Europe. So once again we are reminded that in order for the experience of the Jews in modern France to be fully understood, it must be viewed from the broadest possible perspective.

The apprenticeship projects of the Jewish community were as much a part of a larger French social action movement as they were a manifestation of the Jewish desire for respectabili- ty and acceptance. In attempting to reshape the character of poor Jewish youths, the leaders of French Jewry were not only trying to advance the cause of Jewish acculturation, but also confronting the same fundamental question sociale that troubled all French elites in the early industrial period. Jewish and gentile philanthropists alike had come under the influence of the Enlightenment's glorification of productive labor, and Jewish involvement in the work of patronage reveals the extent to which the leaders of French Jewry had come to share a faith in the regenerative power of vocational training with their gentile counterparts. A careful examination of Jewish apprenticeship projects in the nineteenth century demonstrates that the Franco-Jewish elite had placed itself squarely within the French system of paternalistic philanthropy, just as in other ways too it had placed itself (for better or worse) within the mainstream of French upper-class culture.
