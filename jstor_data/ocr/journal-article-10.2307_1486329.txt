New Haven: Yale University Press. 1982. xli, 250 pp. In addition to its translation of the Yad halazacah and other classics, the Yale Judaica Series has presented important anthologies of lesser- known literatures of the Jews, including that of the Falashas and the Karaites. The present volume of Kurdistani Jewish folk literature is the latest contribution to a program to bring such "little traditions" to the attention of scholars and the general public. After a brief introduction in which the editor packs in information on the history, ethnography, and literature of the Kurdistani Jews, he presents a sampling of their written and oral literature from Neo-Aramaic and Hebrew sources. While listing ten different genres of the written works and oral traditions of these Jewish communities, Sabar concentrates his selection on those which have specific Jewish content and/or a broad appeal. Nine out of the twenty chapters are devoted to tales of biblical personalities, two to talmudic figures (Onkelos and Bar Kappara), one to David Alroy-a Kurdistani messianic pretender, and one long chapter to legends about Rabbi Samuel Barzani and other Kurdistani rabbis. The biblical tales repre- sent intriguing reinterpretations of the Scripture in the spirit of rabbinic midrash, while legends of later rabbis provide glimpses into the history and the self-perception of the Jews in Kurdistan. He includes selections from women's laments for Tisha' B'Av, a preacher's apology, selections from a local chronicle, as well as nursery rhymes, proverbs and sayings, folksongs and folktales. Many of the folk- tales were collected in Israel and were first published in Hebrew. The folk- tales include animal fables and similar tales which have no specifically Jewish content and are similar to such tales throughout the Old World. The book is a readable introduction to the literature of this Jewish society and provides readers of English with a good entree to it. The fact that the book amply serves the purpose for which it was in- tended does not mean that it lacks some serious flaws. I am writing this review from the viewpoint of a scholar working with Judaic cultures, although not with those using Neo-Aramaic in Kurdistan. Some of the shortcomings relate to the footnotes and scholarly apparatus, while others refer to the lack of information of interest to those who wish to go beyond the anthology itself. Sabar does not in an obvious way indicate the sources of the works which he is rendering, although with a little bit of effort one can</page><page sequence="2">294 BOOK REVIEWS figure this out. This could be remedied easily by differentiating the source from the bibliography. In his introduction, Sabar lists the different genres of Kurdistani Jewish literature, but he does not clearly relate what he has translated to these categories. This could have been done easily either in the Introduction or in the prefatory notes at the beginning of each chapter. He also does not provide introductions to the chapters on folksongs or proverbs and sayings. Since these forms of folklore typically condense the meanings conveyed, some additional explanatory material would have been of value. In addition, they often mark the intersection of several languages and dialects known to and spoken by Kurdistani Jews. One footnote to a song is actually confusing-it is folksong 15 (pp. 200-201), which was obviously composed in Palestine during World War II, since it refers to Sarafand, near Tel Aviv. It is unclear, however, whether the woman from whom it was recorded, Rivka Mizrahi, was an immigrant to Israel from Urmia, Persian Kurdistan, or was still living in Urmia at the time of the recording. As in other endeavors describing the culture and literature of a particular Jewry, Sabar must define what he means by the region which he endeavors to cover. Most Jewish cultural areas require such delineation, since they only roughly coincide with the ethnic boundaries of the surrounding Gentile peoples and the borders of nation-states which contain them. He assumes that a stretch of mostly mountainous land which cuts across Southwest Asia from eastern Turkey through northern Iraq into the southern Soviet Union and western Iran is Kurdistan, the homeland of the Kurds, an ancient people speaking an Indo-Iranian language. He also seems to take for granted that the domestic language of most Jews living in that region in recent centuries was Neo-Aramaic. In fact, this area is one which is inhabited by several language groups and ethno-religious groups. It has been the target of migrations by Arabic speakers and Turkic speakers alike, while Kurds have also left more solidly Kurdish areas for other places within the Middle East over the years. Obviously the boundaries of "Kurdistan" have not been stable, despite the persistence of the Kurdish culture, language, and ethnic identity. For the centers, such as Zakho in Iraqi Kurdistan, which produced most of the Neo-Aramaic literature used by Sabar, the coincidence of Kurdish- speaking and Neo-Aramaic-speaking peoples existed and thus presents no problem. When one considers Urmia, however, one finds oneself dealing with the capital of the Iranian province of West Azerbaijan, in which the Kurds and the Neo-Aramaic-speaking Jews and Christians also confronted</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 295 the Turkic Azeris and the Iranians. One wonders if that city can be clearly seen as part of Kurdistan. In addition, by Sabar's own account and accord- ing to my own informants from southeastern Turkey, some Jews in Kurdis- tan spoke Kurmanji (a form of Kurdish) or Arabic dialects as their domestic languages. By use of a clearer definition, Sabar could have helped wean his audience from a naive, nationalist view of the region. Sabar's introduction is unclear about the relationship between the Neo-Aramaic Christians and the Jews of Kurdistan. This is a point which is clarified in his 1978 article, "Multilingual Proverbs in the Neo-Aramaic Speech of the Jews of Zakho, Iraqi Kurdistan," International Journal of Middle Eastern Studies 9, no. 2, pp. 215-235. In that article, he points out that the Jews spoke the Christian dialect in conversations with the Chris- tians. In general, that article complements the introductory chapter of this volume in presenting the social and cultural context of Kurdish Jewry. None of these points affect the central purpose of his mission, which is to present the literature of the Neo-Aramaic-speaking Jews of Kurdistan to an English-speaking audience. The Yale Judaica Series should be congratu- lated on the publication of this enlightening volume. Let us hope that it will continue to publish such anthologies. Walter P.
