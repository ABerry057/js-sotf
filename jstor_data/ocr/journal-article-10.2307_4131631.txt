New York: Oxford Universi- ty Press, 2000. xiii, 203 pp. With few exceptions, classical study of Jewish liturgy has focused on the words of the prayers, largely ignoring the less tangible elements of setting, gesture, halakhic guidance, and music. When scholars like Eric Werner and A. Z. Idelsohn wrote about liturgical music, they, too, considered it a text. In recent years, and in- fluenced by trends in the larger academy, the field has become more interdiscipli- nary, open to the insights of other scholarly methodologies, resulting in important studies on the archaeological history of the synagogue itself, prayer gestures, litur- gical halakhah, and mystical approaches to prayer. Into this context, we can wel- come warmly Jeffrey Summit's The Lord's Song in a Strange Land and its ethnographic study of the musical dimension of contemporary American Jewish liturgy. Scholars generally have been slow to study Jewish religious practice through anthropological lenses, applying the interpretative methods offered by ritual stud- ies sporadically at best and rarely addressing the nonverbal aspects of liturgy. Sum- mit thus enters new territory, and his study necessarily focuses on generating the "thick descriptions," that is, the primary data necessary for more complex analy- sis. This book, a revision of his dissertation, is a narrow ethnomusicological ex- amination of five different Ashkenazi congregations in the Boston area, focusing on their kabbalat Shabbat services. These include a New Age havurah, a large Re- form congregation still in the process of abandoning its classical Reform practice, the Conservative minyan at the Hillel where Summit is rabbi, a modern orthodox congregation, and the Hasidic congregation of the Bostoner Rebbe. Summit is aware of the pitfalls of applying participant-observer methodologies to commu- nities in which he is an insider (pp. 8-9); he successfully balances sympathetic de- scription and scholarly analysis in his portrayal of each community. Following a methodological introduction and a brief overview of Jewish liturgy, Summit's book consists of three studies. In these, he explores the practice of each community, combining observations of the actual services with the results of extensive and often fascinating interviews of members and leaders of the con- gregations. Many musical illustrations appear in notation in the text and on the ac- companying CD. His findings are individually often not astounding, but the very exercise of placing them side by side is enlightening. In many cases, the compar- isons highlight the complexity of the American Jewish cultural matrix. As Summit points out, the musical choices of these communities do not generate a continuum consistent with the standard spectrum of New Age/Reform to Orthodox. The New Age congregation, halakhically very liberal, and the Hasidic congregation, ha- lakhically very strict, were most similar in their understandings of the role of litur- gical music and in their types of musical choices (103-104). Summit's primary theoretical goal here is to discern how music functions to help construct identity for communities of American Jews. He suggests that indi- vidual congregations place themselves in relation to each other and in relation to their own (perceived if not actual) history by the choices that they make regarding 360</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews such issues as congregational participation versus formal professional perfor- mance of the liturgy; reliance on known tunes versus introduction of new ones; freedom of innovation and musical style versus (sometimes perceived) tradition- alism; and/or using music as a vehicle of transcendence versus a reliance on the verbal dimension of the prayers. The first study investigates the meaning of melod- ic choice in each setting, with a primary but not exclusive focus on Lekhah dodi. The second explores the communities' perceptions of nusah, the traditional chants for performance of the liturgy.' The third study broadens the perspective beyond kabbalat Shabbat to examine the codes embedded in melody choice in Jewish wor- ship more generally. In the first two studies, Summit travels from community to community, fol- lowing an arc from the less to the more traditional settings, describing their prac- tices. The third study, however, breaks from the ethnographic model to explore more theoretically how liturgical music functions as a communicative code in Ju- daism. Here, where application of the theory to the familiar communities would most strongly demonstrate his point, Summit discusses directly only the Hillel and New Age communities, bringing additional examples from common knowledge and a sixth congregation. His proofs also operate on different planes. The use of Lamentations trop in Esther is quite a different sort of code-switching than the New Age employment of a Buddhist melody or the Hillel negotiation between nusah and song. The latter two speak to communal identity; the first does not. Summit's conclusion attempts briefly to place the Boston Jewish communi- ties within the larger setting of American religion. While important, this exercise would be more convincing had he already more deeply situated his five commu- nities within the larger spectrum of American Judaism. Summit studied familiar and welcoming local congregations; this only increases his obligation to contex- tualize them and establish how they represent their larger movements. In addition, whereas including a Conservative Hillel minyan added a young adult community, omitting the voice of the traditionally trained cantor found in a large Conservative congregation created a lacuna, one exacerbated by the presence of only one (Re- form) cantor in the study. Indeed, a wider study, as Summit himself acknowledges (p. 14), is necessary to demonstrate the validity of his own theoretical claims. Nev- ertheless, Summit's book provides an important foundation for further research into the role of Jewish liturgical music. Ruth Langer Boston College Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts 1. Summit's only egregious error concludes this chapter, wherein he dates the Mazor Vitry to two centuries before Rashi instead of to the generation after, and where his bibliographic reference, strangely, lists its author by his patronymic. 361</page></plain_text>
