<plain_text><page sequence="1">Daniel R. Schwarz. Imagining the Holocaust. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1999. 353 pp. If good scholarship is supposed to be disciplined, detached, and objective, the study of the Holocaust has taught us that mental, emotional, and physical re- actions-even when experienced from a temporal and spatial distance, and con- sciously or not-condition our conceptualized or poetic responses to the Shoah. This unarticulated psychic involvement in our recent past is perhaps the place that generates intellectual, political, ideological, and imaginative expressions. More- over, this location signifies the meeting point of ethics and aesthetics that makes any verbal or visual attempt to convey the unspeakable and unimaginable possi- ble, while at the same time being the very site that causes the collapse of the bound- aries between objective and subjective response. How can it be otherwise? The im- pact of this recognition is such that even general literary, cultural, and philosophic writing, mostly influenced by Holocaust studies, has begun to consider ethics as an analytic category.' Daniel Schwarz's Imagining the Holocaust is positioned at the core of this ethical-aesthetic matrix. Schwarz combines two uneven points of references. At the center of his study is a focus on specific Holocaust fictional works-the most discussed in contem- porary studies-whereas in the margins Schwarz situates each work in the context 1.

This structural dis- cipline is one of the book's main achievements, for it prevents the works discussed from being universalized or trivialized. On the other hand, the intellectual periph- ery provides its own insight in two major ways. It reveals that, despite the burden of content and the need for linguistic and imaginative inventions to express the hor- rors of the Holocaust, the writers of these narratives created their works within al- ready established ethical and aesthetic traditions, and, most important, they made their own choices, intentionally or otherwise, regarding which of the available legacies to adopt. Schwarz, as others before him, tries to understand and evaluate these intellectual and poetic preferences, which brings us to the problem of the lim- its of representation, a term frequently used by scholars of the Holocaust but un- fortunately not mentioned by Schwarz. The phrase was coined by Saul Friedlin- der and discussed in its diverse dimensions (historical, philosophical, literary) in his Probing the Limits of Representation: Nazism and the "Final Solution."2 Be- fore dealing with the association between the two works, it is necessary here to provide some examples relating to Schwarz's method of linking Holocaust fiction to modern European tradition. On Primo Levi's Survival in Auschwitz, Schwarz notes that the narrator (the author's surrogate) reflects the archetype of the figure who descends to hell and returns. The description of European physical and moral destruction is textured with allusions to a glorious past of securely founded civilization so that "at times [this erstwhile world] proposes an alternative context that looks toward values of a different, more stable, and presumably more noble era" (p. 84). The works of modern poets and novelists such as T. S. Eliot in The Wasteland and James Joyce in Ulysses propose the employment of the same method. Moreover, Levi alludes to Dante's Ulysses and Virgil and their shared experience in Inferno as well as to Homer's Odysseus, so that this subtext establishes the archaic, heroic, and hu- manistic tradition by which Levi judges events in Auschwitz. Schwarz concludes his discussion of Levi's works with the observation, "Levi is a modern Dante who will read the hermeneutics of history" (p. 98). A similar phenomenon can be traced in other fictional works whose thematic texture or structural arrangement call at times for ethical judgment. For example, Schwarz links Jerzy Kosinski's Bildungsroman, The Painted Bird, which he defines as a historical allegory for the victimization of the inno- cent, to Joseph Conrad's Heart ofDarkness, for Marlow, too, descends into a world of horror and returns to question all values and beliefs in light of his experience. Yet The Painted Bird, according to Schwarz, is saturated with violence, perversion, pornography, sadism, and a vengeful tone, which does damage to "a sympathetic reading" (p. 192). On the same note, Schwarz traces the metamorphosis of Elie Wiesel's Night from its original Yiddish version founded on the prophetic tradition of the Bible and on Jewish literature into the French La Nuit. He agrees with Nao- mi Seidman's observation3 that this change-transpired through Francois Mauri- 2. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1992. 3.

Schwarz judges this type of thematic appropriation to be an ethical transgression. Especially interesting is Schwarz's association of Aharon Appelfeld's para- bles, Badenheim 1939 and The Retreat, with Thomas Mann's Death in Venice and The Magic Mountain. These writers describe European civilization and Jewish- European culture as a hermetic world undergoing a process of moral decay and so- cial and political disintegration. But, asserts Schwarz, Appelfeld draws upon Kaf- ka's objectivity and the language of the absurd as much as he is inspired by Jew- ish folk tradition so that in these stories, as well as in others, the semantic and semiotic texture embodies allusions to both Hasidic tales and Kafka's Metamor- phosis. Although Appelfeld's stories exhibit close association with modem litera- ture, at the same time, the fragmentation of characters signifies the use of post- modern technique, as Gila Ramras-Rauch notes and Schwarz concurs.4 Needless to mention that, as this concise outline suggests, Imagining the Holocaust reflects on the dialogic relations between classical, modern, and postmodern themes and modes, on the one hand, and narratives of the Shoah, on the other. The universal texts and the Holocaust fiction express mutual thematic and stylistic concerns that include: the crisis of European civilization and the rethinking of humanistic val- ues; the quest for a father and home; the relation between art and life; or writing as self-reflection, creation, and affirmation; the sense of the (dis)integrated self; linguistic and artistic experimentation; primitivism and modernity; and so on. If in both European and Jewish traditions the thematic configuration of Holocaust narratives is directly related to the ethical problems emerging from such conceptual correlations as those between human beliefs and behavior, the idea of history and its teleological principle, civilization and the utilization of technology, the merit of logic and the significance of myth, the valuable weight of tradition in the face of modernity, or moral choice, sociopolitical pressure, and the ontologi- cal limits of resistance, then for Schwarz the coordination between ethical and aes- thetic parameters in Holocaust fiction is embedded in the choice of genre. There is no groundbreaking novelty in this insight; the ongoing controversy over the lim- its of representation is epitomized by this very issue. However, Schwarz's argu- ment for accepting new poetic boundaries in Holocaust narrative form is innova- tive. Before elaborating, let me briefly outline his method. Schwarz distinguishes genres that offer a teleology from those suggesting a different structural and textual design. Books of fiction such as Tadeusz Borowski's This Wayfor the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen or Gerald Green's Holocaust (both the TV production and the novel), including diaries and memoirs, are signified as re- alistic writing even when containing parabolic features. On the other hand, Andre Schwarz-Bart's The Last of the Just or Cynthia Ozick's The Shawl and Rosa are defined as parable or fantasy respectively. For example, Schwarz emphasizes the humanistic teleology suggested in The Diary ofAnn Frank, Sophie Goetzel- 4. Gila Ramras-Rauch.

This kind of delineation makes these books available to both Jews and non-Jews in America as much as it explains their success with a heterogeneous audience. Arguing against Sidra DeKoven Ezrahi,5 Schwarz notes, "She fears that redefining the Holocaust in terms of West- ern humanism corrupts the Holocaust ... but whether we can say that one way of presenting the Holocaust is better than another... is moot. In fact ... there are many diverse traditions" (pp. 144-145). Indeed, Schwarz moves on in search of other modes of Holocaust representations, but before doing so he examines some more complex problems emerging from the ethic-poetic junctures in realistic novels. A case in point is William Styron's Sophie's Choice. Defining it as a docu- fiction and a realistic novel, Schwarz investigates the narrative as a story that, by al- lowing the various speakers to tell their true or invented autobiographies, illustrates the connection between memory and narrative in a comparative manner. Still, the disputable aspect of this writing resides not in the chosen theme as it is inherent in the overall structure of the story and the imbalance created between its narrato- logical segments, and this in addition to the author's use of a problematic technique in characterization. In Schwarz's words, "That Styron asks us to think of South- erners as victims of prejudice in a Holocaust novel seems limp to some readers.... Moreover, we notice that within Styron's novel it is the Jews ... who are at times stereotyped if not travestied.... The narrator is doing what he says he will not do, that is draining the Holocaust of its substance by using it as contextual rather than essential role.... Styron is not beyond insensitivity if not anti-Semitism" (pp. 203-204). Narratological mechanisms of structuring and characterization are also ap- plied by Thomas Keneally to his realistic novel, Schindler's List, and by Steven Spielberg to the epic film by the same name. In this case though, those elements miss- ing or distorted in the novel, that is, the misrepresentation of Jewish tradition and the confused and misleading depiction of Jewish values, are visually corrected and appropriated in the film. For one, the diachronic and synchronic arrangement of episodes in the movie reflects the technical disposition of events in the Bible. As Erich Auerbach describes biblical style in contrast to the Homeric epics in his Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature, crucial events in the Bible are foregrounded while others less significant are either relegated to the background or missing altogether, and only implied at times through dialogues. Spielberg utilizes this very narratological technique. Although in principle the oc- ular image of Schindler is based on the written text that indirectly delineates his character through the Jews' reaction to his behavior, which embues him with mag- ic power, the weaving of the visual incidents in the film enlarges his figure to the epic-biblical proportion of a miracle worker who can suspend history. Moreover, the camera, which reflects community conscience, creates an optical dialogue with familiar visual and textual mythopoetic representations of the Holocaust, so that the images on the screen mirror our collective knowledge of Holocaust events. 5.

By ending the pictorial story in Israel, Spielberg structures the film on the teleological principle of universal history, that is, draw- ing a movement from the Shoah to the State of Israel, thereby underscoring Jew- ish survival and continuity. Leslie Epstein's King of the Jews is considered by Schwarz a breakthrough in Holocaust representation for its abandonment of the realistic form. It suggests a further development in style and tone from Tadeusz Borowski's This Way for the Gas, which in itself offers a movement away from the representation of naturalis- tic verisimilitude through grotesque images and cynical tone. Both writers have sensed that the realistic form is problematic in the way it depicts Holocaust expe- rience. Hence, the fantasy and surrealism that control the parabolic King of the Jews, its humoristic and satiric tone, its grotesque imagery, and its vaudevillian narrating style enable Epstein to deal with the complex ethical issues regarding the behavior of the Judenrat during the Holocaust. Relying on Jewish traditional nar- rative style and sensitivity, and in contrast to Borowski's cynicism, Epstein is con- cerned with the helplessness and powerlessness of the Jews. By making the Elder (based on the controversial figure of Rumkowski, the head of the Judenrat in the Lodz ghetto) an ambiguous individual, Epstein avoids a restricted negative moral diagnosis of the Judenrat, preferring instead to draw a positive line of hope and survival for future generations. A wider extension of the parameters of representation is suggested in Art Spiegelman's Maus, which offers a postmodern examination of the impact of Eu- ropean history, including its eventful terror and anxiety as well as its artistic tradi- tions and imaginative inspiration, on the private history of two generations, a sur- vivor and his son. The experimental mixed form of verbal and visual narrative, which includes, for example, the exposure of the characters' psyches and the use of the comic mode for humanizing and artistic expressions, allows us to identify with the victims on a humanistic universal ground. Schwarz takes a cue from Barbara Foley's assertion that "those narrative forms-both factual and fictive-that rely upon an informing teleology, general- ly prove inadequate to the task of encompassing the full significance of Holocaust experience" (p. 207).6 For Schwarz, "Much of Holocaust narrative is quite con- servative and traditional. ... The paradox is that perhaps at this distance of years the Holocaust may be better grasped within the human ken of understanding rather than when isolated as a sacred event apart from human history" (p. 302). This re- quirement for a human treatment of the Shoah is fulfilled in Cynthia Ozick's The Shawl and Rosa. Schwarz ends his book by presenting two primary ethical ques- tions raised by Bruno Schulz's The Street of Crocodiles and Sanitarium Under the Sign of the Hourglass, on the one hand, and Cynthia Ozick's response to Schulz in The Messiah ofStockholm, on the other: the ethical difficulty encountered through invading the past and creating and (re)inventing oneself in the context of its histo- 6.

The major complication then, as Schwarz puts it, is the mode we choose in our quest for truth about the Holocaust and about ourselves. One possible response to these problems is reflected in Schwarz's own book, and here we reach full circle, confronting Schwarz's own identity as a hu- manist in his worldview, scholar of modem literature, and Jew. In Schwarz's own words, "As a humanist, I want to show how these narratives are about humans, by humans, and for humans" (p. 4). Reflecting on his academic career after publishing books that include The Humanistic Heritage: Critical The- ories of the English Novel from James to Hillis Miller, The Transformation of the English Novel, 1890-1930, and others written more or less in a similar vein, Schwarz notes, "For several decades, Jewish scholars passionately taught and still teach Anglo-American literature, but now how many are rethinking whether these professional interests have repressed ethnic concerns" (p. 17). For him, as for his readers, Imagining the Holocaust provides an epistemological ground, painful, controversial, and complex as it is, for the establishment of self-identity through an imaginative and intellectual journey into Jewish recent history and its collec- tive responses, which also entails, as he so eruditely demonstrates, a quest for uni- versal Jewish and European history, culture, and traditions. Schwarz's style is fluent and direct. Instead of presenting historical and philosophical abstractions, he prefers to found his thoughts on the fictional works themselves. Through a close reading of the narratives, Schwarz develops an intel- lectual dialogue not only with the authors of selected fictional works but with oth- er scholars of the Shoah as well, and he does so without suppressing his own views on highly controversial issues. As a contemporary darshan, he asks many ques- tions and is courageous enough to try to deal with the most grievous and difficult dilemmas, engaging along the way his rich knowledge of Western and Jewish artis- tic and literary traditions. For this, and because he encourages the expansion of the boundaries in Holocaust representation, the appearance of Schwarz's book is a sig- nificant event in Holocaust studies. I cannot help but try to close another circle that touches upon the roots of my own identity as an Israeli. Schwarz considers Hebrew literature of the Shoah and its Zionist context in his examination of the writing ofAppelfeld, whose works are perhaps the most discussed outside Israel. But there are other fictional works worth mentioning that demonstrate complex responses in addition to thematic and stylistic trajectories in Israeli discourses on Jewish and Israeli identity (cultural as well as ideological) and its interconnection to the changing perceptions of what constitutes exilic (galut) and Israeli mentality (psychologically and ideologically)- a problem explained, illustrated, and mapped by Yael Feldman in her essay, "Whose Story Is It, Anyway? Ideology and Psychology in the Representation of the Shoah in Israeli Literature."' Significantly associated with Schwarz's presentation is Yoram Kaniuk's Adam Ben Kelev (Adam Resurrected) and its carnivalesque-dia- logic link to Epstein's King of the Jews and David Grossman's 'Ayen 'Erech 'Ahavah (See Under: Love) and its imaginative correspondence to the works of 7.
