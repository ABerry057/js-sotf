Manchester: University of Manchester Press, 1988. xv, 172 pp. In the demographic upheavals of the last hundred years, nearly every Jewish community in the world has changed almost beyond recognition. Most of the oldest Jewish communities have come to an end, and with them local Jewish cultures with venerable histories. Our generation of scholars is the last that will be able to learn about these cultures from those who lived them. To understand any particular Jewish community is to broaden our notions of what a Jewish community can be, of what Judaism realized in a living community can be. For this reason, studies which document such societies are of much more than sentimental vlaue. Max Weinreich once wrote, "This applies to any field of culture: More often than not, it appears, the distance between Jewish and non-Jewish pat- terns is created not by a difference in the ingredients proper but rather by the way they are interpreted as elements of the given system."' It is the creative 1.

It is a deficiency of Norman Stillman's study of the Jews of a Moroccan town that it explains linguistic and cultural items atomistically, rather than inter- preting them as part of an integrated system. Nonetheless, the book is full of valuable and fascinating material. The majority of Moroccan Jews have migrated to Israel, and those who remain in Morocco have concentrated themselves in the major cities. Smaller communities have been largely abandoned; in Sefrou the Jewish community, founded in the thirteenth century, was formerly a productive center of Jewish scholarship and fifty years ago numbered about six thou- sand people; now it has fewer than two dozen. The core of this book is a collection of texts in Sefriwi Judeo-Arabic with complete English translations. This is preceded by three introductory chapters: a historical survey of Judeo-Arabic in the context of the notion of Jewish languages (9 pages), a historical and descriptive sketch of the Sefrou Jewish community (18 pages), and an introduction to the grammar and vocabulary of Sefriwi Jewish Arabic (30 pages). The second introduction provides fascinating background information on the history, social struc- ture, and folkways of the Jewish community of Sefrou, including suich topics as communal institutions, Muslim-Jewish relations, pilgrimages, and belief in clairvoyants. Much of this information could have been better placed as brief introductions among the texts. For instance, a fascinating series of texts tells about the medicinal compound of herbs, spices, and gums known as tel'ita: how it is made, how the secret of its compounding and use was passed from mother to daughter, and how it was efficaciously used on sever- al occasions (pp. 100-110). However, none of these texts happens to men- tion how it was administered; the introduction (p. 27) informs us that it could be swallowed or applied as a poultice. Regardless of such inconve- nience, the information is detailed and specific, and it will be useful for comparative work on Moroccan or other Middle Eastern Jewish societies. The third introduction, the sketch of the Sefriwi Judeo-Arabic lan- guage, is designed both to help a reader who has some familiarity with other varieties of Arabic to read the texts, and also to place this dialect within the context of other Moroccan Arabic and other Jewish languages. To a reader who knows no Moroccan Arabic, however, much in the Arabic texts will remain obscure (though of course the contents of the texts are made acces-</page><page sequence="3">364 BOOK REVIEWS sible in translation). This chapter has an especially interesting section on the vocabulary, focusing on words from Hebrew, Berber, Spanish, and French. The Hebrew element includes not only terms of Jewish religion but also several in the elemental sphere of personal well-being and illness, such as "body," "strength," "trouble," "sorrow." Many of the items from Spanish were borrowed in medieval times, and many are used only by Jews, not Muslims. Although it is not the purpose of the linguistic sketch to describe the dia- lect as a system, the lack of an integrated understanding can be a source of problems. One troublesome instance is the transcription of the vowels, for which Stillman has followed the Mareais-Brunot tradition of indicating numerous fine phonetic details. Consequently many words appear in var- ious forms, for example: wahid (p. 52) wahid (p. 65), wahed (p. 49) "one"; noftqr (p. 57) and niftar (pp. 41, 65) "passed away"; Sfru (p. 12), ,frta (p. 68) "Sefrou". These transcriptions may report genuine phonetic variation, but they leave the reader uncertain as to how to interpret what is written. Such detail is better confined to specialized phonetic studies; it would have been much better to use a phonemic transcription like those used for Muslim and Jewish Moroccan Arabic by R. S. Harrell, J. Heath, and M. Bar-Asher. The texts in Sefriwi Jewish Arabic with English translation cover a broad range of topics and genres: stories in praise of local rabbis and saints, descriptions of folk beliefs and medicine together with anecdotes about their use, descriptions of the observance of holidays, child marriage, an oral gloss to the Sayings of the Fathers, lists of proverbs and "piquant idioms," and several types of folk poems. The texts are accompanied by extensive, superb notes explicating linguistic and literary matters, history, and realia. Alto- gether the texts give a very rich sample of what and how the Sefriwi Jews tell about their own society. Robert D.
