<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LAST JEWISH GENERALIST by ISMAR SCHORSCH Why has the death of Salo Wittmayer Baron on November 25, 1989 at the age of ninety-four elicited so little comment? No chorus of tributes, memories, or evaluations erupted at the passing of this century's most eru- dite and prolific Jewish historian, whose standard of excellence almost singlehandedly opened the American university to the field of Jewish stud- ies. The silence, I suspect, tells us as much about the present state of Jewish studies as about the limitations of his work. It is surely not related to the magnitude of his scholarly legacy or its unrelieved and often maddening thematic mode of discourse or even its frequently inelegant style. Sadly, Pro- fessor Baron had fallen out of sync with his time long before he died, in part because the one-sidedness of the final ten volumes of the second edition of his Social and Religious History of the Jews abandoned the balance and integration of external and internal events vital to his own understanding of Jewish history. That conception of Jewish history was forged in the tense and unstable decades between the two world wars, when Baron, young, precocious, and hard-working, matured into a much-sought-after historian. For European Jewry, reeling from the losses inflicted by the recurring pogroms of the 39</page><page sequence="2">40 ISMAR SCHORSCH Great War and its aftermath, it was a period of chaos in search of political security and ideological coherence. World-views and grand strategies- from emancipation to Zionism to socialism to diaspora nationalism-were cast and disseminated in the dense rhetoric of historical research. Croce's claim that "every true history is contemporary history" may be flawed by some circular reasoning, but it aptly applies to the fierce historical debates of a beleaguered Jewish minority. With the turn to history in the ninteenth century, Jewish thought in Cen- tral Europe had quickly shifted from midrashic to historical canons of con- ceptualization. And through the felicitious Hebrew translation of Graetz's nationalistic history of the Jews by Saul Pinchas Rabinowitz in the last decade of the century, historical consciousness had also taken root in the culture of East European Jewry. Rabinowitz was not far from the truth when he asserted in the preface to the third edition of his translation in 1899: From the time when the first volume of this work was published some eleven years ago [i.e., in 1888], the house of Israel in Russia and other lands has become enamored with the history of the Jewish people, for here the children of the prophets and sages have not forgotten the language spoken by their forefathers for more than a thousand years.' Seven years before this comment, on New Year's Day 1892, Simon Dub- nov also surrendered to Graetz's spell and recorded in his diary what would be his life's vocation: "The goal of my life stands now clearly before me: dissemination of historical knowledge about Judaism and especially the study of the history of Russian Jews. I have indeed become a missionary of history."2 Graetz's remarkable success in Russia only accelerated the transforma- tion of Jewish thought; history became the preferred field of battle for ideo- logical controversy across the Jewish world. Even as the Hebrew authors of the nascent Zionist movement attacked the legacy of German Jewish Wis- senschaft, they appropriated the idiom of historical discourse. Dubnov caught the prevailing historical-mindedness when he wrote: "The essence of historicism lies in apprehending the past with the immediacy of the current 1.

In the dozen or so years prior to the publication of the first edition of A Social and Religious History of the Jews in 1937, a number of seminal works of Jewish history appeared which addressed the angst of the age as well as shaped the historical thought of Salo Baron.4 For example, Simon Bernfeld, like Baron a product of Galicia, brought out in the mid-twenties a splendid three-volume collection of Hebrew primary sources preserving the memory of Jewish persecutions from the Maccabees to the middle of the eighteenth century. Entitled The Book of Tears (on the basis of Psalms 56:9), the anthol- ogy bespoke not only the Wissenschaft consensus of Jewish history as an unending ordeal of national suffering, but also the terrible confirmation of that view by the recent war. In the words of Bernfeld: "Generations come and go, but the hatred of Israel stands forever."5 It was the cumulative power of Bernfeld's reformulation that most likely prompted Baron but a few years later (1928), in a modest essay of stunning sweep, to marshal for the first time the evidence to repudiate what he called "the lachrymose the- ory of pre-[French] Revolutionary woe."6 The melancholy events of the next decade, however, did not favor Baron's revision, and in 1936 Yitzhak Baer of the Hebrew University reaf- firmed the millennial view with a Zionist spin. His famous meditation on the galut, written in German and published in that extraordinary series of con- solatory literature known as the Biicherei des Schocken Verlags, was a relentless historical argument for the conflict-ridden nature of the exilic experience. In a Moslem or Christian society, a Jewish minority always found itself in a state of political servitude, teetering on the brink of violent abuse. "For the modern observer," Baer wrote, alluding to his own day, "the Jewish problem of fifteenth-century Spain indicates only the terrible inevitability of historical conflicts, which apparently are constantly renewed 3.

Of substantially more positive influence on the young Baron was Dub- nov, whose ten-volume World History of the Jewish People came out in Ber- lin in rapid succession from 1925 to 1929.9 The distillation of a lifetime, this gripping and coherent narrative focused on "the people, the national indi- viduality, its origin, its growth, and its struggle for existence."'0 In contrast to the religiously saturated Wissenschaft of Central Europe, which had made the synagogue and its literature the bearer of national consciousness, Dub- nov embraced a secular and political perspective. He stressed the endless quest for communal autonomy in the diaspora, organized his history in terms of successive centers of political hegemony, and described at length the institutions of self-government. Cultural and religious phenomena were treated as derivative. "The religion of Judaism," he asserted in the introduc- tion, "was fashioned in accordance with the image of social conditions of the nation's existence, and not the reverse."'' For Dubnov the Jewish people never ceased to be the subject of their history, to use the charged and mis- leading rhetoric of his time, and his research assembled the historical data to vindicate his rejection of Zionism in favor of national minority rights for Jews wherever they might reside. When in the late twenties Baron turned down the chance to occupy the chair of Jewish history at the Breslau Seminary once graced by Heinrich Graetz, that act symbolized his much greater affinity for Dubnov.'2 To sin- gle out but one of many interests the two men shared in common: Baron's synthetic history of the Jewish community, published in 1942 and quickly 7.

As in other areas, Baron, the product of extensive academic training in Vienna, solidified, enlarged upon, and cor- rected initiatives taken by Dubnov, who had himself been denied all access to a Russian university education, but was gifted with fine historical instincts, fierce self-discipline, and a facile pen. The interwar context of Baron's maturation into an independent and commanding historical voice includes still one more figure whose scholar- ship contributed to prompting Baron to offer his own views on the past and present in a single work of history, metahistory, and public policy. I refer to Yehezkel Kaufmann, born just a few years before Baron, farther east in Ukraine in a traditional milieu of great poverty. In 1929-32, not long after his arrival in Palestine and after extended periods of study in Petersburg, Odessa, Bern, and Berlin, Kaufmann published in Hebrew a four-volume interpretation of all of Jewish history with the somber title of Exile and Alienation (Golah ve-Nekhar).14 Clearly the turbulence of the times militated against small and specialized studies without surface relevance; it begged for syntheses of bracing illumination. Kaufmann provided just that: a multi- valent work brimming with originality and polemics, both sprawling and schematic, detailed and dogmatic. At its core, Exile and Alienation delivered a brief for the centrality of Judaism as religion in understanding the fate of the Jews. Against Wellhau- sen he argued for the antiquity, superiority, and universal thrust of biblical monotheism; against Dubnov and Ahad Ha-am he propounded the thesis that Judaism alone, and not gentile hatred or a reified national will to sur- vive, accounted for the remarkable preservation of Jewish national con- sciousness in exile. Unlike Christianity or Islam, Judaism had remained the religion of a single national group, and that combination had destined the inexorable otherness of Jews even in the modern period, when the power of Judaism had waned. Time and again Kaufmann asserted his conviction that only religious conversion would eliminate the dominant factor making for Jewish apartness and ethnic identity. Emancipation had failed to effect a 13. Salo Wittmayer Baron, The Jewish Community: Its History and Structure to the Ameri- can Revolution, 3 vols. (Philadelphia, 1948). 14.

So Kaufmann became a Zionist, but not one wedded to the land of Israel, where the Arab nation, already in the throes of a national revival, would deny Jews the ethnic supremacy crucial to ending their state of exile. The purpose of this detour has been to recover the context of our text, the first edition of Baron's magnum opus and the key to his conception of Jewish history. To read that text in a vacuum is to sever it from the anguished debate which gave it birth and the issues it tried to address. Kauf- mann spoke for all his colleagues when he drew the twofold character of his own work at the outset. It searches out the past but its eyes are focused on the present and future. It begins with historical, indeed archaeological studies but ends up in a thicket of painfully urgent existential questions. It begins in theory and ends in blood, fire, and pillars of smoke.'5 Nor is Baron's participation limited to his epilogue of one hundred pages in which he dared to apply the wisdom of the past to the conundrums of the present. That unabashed demonstration of Jewish commitment has long seemed to me an act of supreme courage. Holding the first chair in Jewish history in North America and being the first Jewish tenured member of Columbia's vaunted history department had not left Baron timid or tenta- tive. The dismissal of Lionel Trilling in 1936 by the English department as a Freudian, Marxist, and Jew did not appear to cow him either.16 On the con- trary, Baron's engagement with the fate of his people pervaded his entire book, not just the end. Like his fellow historians in Europe and Palestine, he professed the utility of historical scholarship. The interpretation and reinterpretation of the history of the people, a kind of historic Midrash [emphasis in the original], is now to serve as a guidance for the future. A new divine book has opened itself before the eyes of the faithful: the book of human and Jewish destinies, guided by some unknown and unknowable ultimate Power. This book, if properly understood, would seem to answer the most perplexing questions of the present and the future. It is over the exposition of this historical "Scripture" that sectarian controversies are already raging, and are likely to grow more intense and sweeping." 15. Ibid., 1, preface. 16.

Baron, SRHJ, 1937, 2:457.</page><page sequence="7">THE LAST JEWISH GENERALIST 45 At the heart of Baron's enterprise was the desire to equate the social and religious factors at work in Jewish history. In contrast to Dubnov and Kauf- mann, he refused to assign primacy to one or the other. Both the secular and the spiritual, society and religion, Jews and Judaism, were universally opera- tive and ever interactive in the Jewish experience. The very title of his book denoted their equality, and both dimensions riveted his attention through- out. In the preface Baron illumined the book's genesis: in the spring of 1931 (his first full year at Columbia) he had delivered ten public lectures, "Jewish Society and Religion in Their Historical Interrelation," which were designed to show the interplay of these general forces "in the long historic evolution of the Jewish people.""8 That is, one year after the appearance of Kauf- mann's third volume, Baron, who in his very first note referred to Kauf- mann's work as "a vivid interpretation of the Jewish past from an extreme 'territorialist' point of view," began to formulate a less one-sided picture. The year Baron's work came out, it attracted a three-page Yiddish review in Die Zukunft (which gave its price as $11.50!) by Dubnov, then age seventy-seven and living in Riga. Symbolically the review can be read as a passing of the mantle. Substantively it was both laudatory and critical. But above all, Dubnov understood and endorsed Baron's intent. I feared that the secular ethos would suffer a setback [in his book, given the title], but fortunately and to Mr. Baron's credit my fear was unwarranted. Among the problems he treats, religion or Judaism takes first place, much more so than in other world histories. But the author is not a one-sided spiri- tualist. He even believes in the social-economic method, though not in his- torical materialism. For him "social and religious" means to look at religion from a sociological standpoint, and that is certainly to be welcomed.19 In sum, the evidence suggests a causal nexus between Kaufmann and Baron. Both men eschewed the writing of narrative history and chose instead to compose a commentary on the totality of the Jewish experience. Both men placed the interconnectedness of Jews and Judaism at the center of their reflections and disputed the tendency of Dubnov to relegate religion to a subordinate role. In fact, the primacy of religion in the lives of exilic Jews prevented them from ever becoming merely the objects of history. In both genre and substance the two scholars bespoke a surprising degree of affinity. 18. Ibid., 1:v. 19. Die Zukunft, 1937, p. 765.</page><page sequence="8">46 ISMAR SCHORSCH What separated them was the legacy of Dubnov. Though not a partisan diaspora nationalist, Baron definitely wove a stunning pattern of exilic accomplishments that included such strands as religious loyalty, political sagacity, economic prowess, institutional inventiveness, physical resilience, and intellectual creativity. Beyond this, he ventured to anchor that record of ethnic survival without benefit of homeland or sovereignty in the character of Judaism itself. In a bracing prolegomenon, Baron posited a historical monotheism in ceaseless revolt against the forces of nature.20 From its imageless concept of God to the historicization of its rites and festivals to its portable synagogue to its emancipation from the constraints of a specific territory, Judaism had always struggled to defy and transcend the natural world. In this view, exile marked the triumph of history, while messianism symbolized the eternal and irresistable appeal of nature. As he rejected the ethical monotheism of Reform and the Palestino-centrism of Zionism, Baron came very close to appropriating what Dubnov always regarded as the highest form of na- tionalism-that of the spiritual, cultural variety, which did not depend on ethnos, land, or language.21 The epilogue rendered Baron's views still more explicit. He dismissed Zionism's avowed negation of all life in the diaspora as "extreme," favored a bi-national state in Palestine, and reaffirmed Jewish reliance on internation- al bodies and arrangements for protection.22 In opposition to Kaufmann, he averred the continued vitality of religion in his own day and singled out Reform for special censure. He found it unduly sensitive to the pressures of emancipation and wholly unhistorical in its reversion to prophetic Judaism.23 His own religious sentiments, whatever his personal practice, appeared closest to those of Zacharias Frankel and Conservative Judaism. Surely his "historical-halakhic reformulation" strikingly echoed the "posi- tive, historical Judaism" of Frankel.24 And his long association with the 20. Baron, SRHJ, 1937, 1:3-31. 21.

In the two decades that followed the first edition of A Social and Reli- gious History of the Jews, religion remained at the epicenter of Baron's scho- larly universe. The Jewish Community heralded the organizational ingenuity of the Jewish people, whose remarkable institutions of self-government con- stituted a surrogate and largely self-sufficient homeland. The driving, for- mative, and cohesive force of Judaism itself could hardly be ignored in this political subject. The research focus had changed, but the ideological issue still resonated in the text. Alluding "to the controversy of the recent decades concerning the primacy of the religious or national element in the Jewish people," Baron strove consistently for balance. "Between the two extremes of mystic inner urge and outward political pressure, one must find one's road, recognizing the importance of both factors in varying degrees throughout the history of the dispersion."25 Even when he dramatically enlarged his canvas to write Modern Nation- alism and Religion in 1947, he continued to emphasize the crucial role of reli- gion in human affairs. Baron never minimized the complexity of historical phenomena. If in the religious expulsions of the Jews from England, France, and Spain in the Middle Ages he detected a current of nationalism, in the modern heyday of secular nationalism, he contended, religion was still very much at work. In many ways his book was a plea to religious leaders in the West to help give shape to the postwar world with a fresh infusion of tradi- tional values. "Religion's constructive contribution," he wrote toward the end, "may make itself most deeply felt in its strengthening the positive forces of human cooperation to outweigh the hitherto prevailing negative factors."26 For Baron, religion may no longer have enjoyed its former pri- macy, but it was far from dead. The second, revised, and enlarged edition of A Social and Religious His- tory of the Jews began to appear in 1952, and by 1983 Baron had completed eighteen volumes down to the middle of the seventeenth century.27 Without a doubt it is an enduring work, a monument of energy, learning, linguistic 25.

And yet the decision to expand the first edition turned an interpretive essay into an en- cyclopedia at the cost of coherence, balance, and point of view. Baron's eru- dition came to overwhelm his original thesis and, indeed, in the end to betray it. For the first eight volumes, which covered the millennia prior to the year 1200, he did manage to integrate harmoniously the foreign and domestic affairs of the Jews. The last four in particular contain some dazzling speci- mens of synthesis of sectarian controversies, legal developments, and liter- ary creativity during the period of sea-changes from 500 to 1200. But begin- ning with volume 9, Baron took leave of all internal Jewish history, never to return again to a single systematic treatment of any aspect of Judaism. Volume 18 closes pathetically with a promise to recitify the imbalance. The story of these splinter groups rounds out the picture of the sociopolitical life of medieval and early modern Jews from 1200 to 1650. We shall now have to turn to a description of the forces which shaped the internal evolution of the Jewish people in its communal, intellectual, and religious pursuits.28 Had he lived, it appears that volume 19 would have been devoted to the sub- ject of Jewish self-government.29 But it was too late to undo the cumulative impact of the last ten volumes. The excessive attention to the final bloodstained centuries of the Middle Ages served to reaffirm the primacy of foreign affairs in Jewish life, to reduce Jews to objects of history and victims of persecution, and to make of Judaism a mirror image of external events--precisely the views that the first edition was designed to refute. In his resolve to shatter the insularity of Jewish scholarship, Baron produced ever larger chunks of straight non- Jewish history interspersed with only an occasional stray Jewish fact. Con- siderations of relevance were stretched to the limit. Thus, for example, in volume 16 he wrote with impregnable authority but from a totally external perspective on the meteoric rise of East European Jewry in the century and a half before Bogdan Chmielnicki and the Cos- sack-Tartar deluge of 1648, calling it "the happiest period Polish- Lithuanian Jewry ever had." Yet while recognizing that "by the end of the 28. Ibid., 18:435. 29. Ibid., pp. 275, 551 n. 111.</page><page sequence="11">THE LAST JEWISH GENERALIST 49 sixteenth century the most glorious chapters of Polish Jewish learning had already been written," Baron decided to exclude them entirely at this point, to the great impoverishment of his book.30 A more rigorous compression of material would have freed up ample space, in this and other volumes, for the kind of well-rounded presentation consonant with his own basic views. For Baron, both God and the devil lay hidden in the details. The one-sidedness of these final ten volumes fated Baron to fall into eclipse for a generation of Jews in search of their religious moorings. It is the internal history and spiritual legacy of the Jewish people that answer our existential need for boundaries, values, and links to eternity. Add an ethos of ethnicity and you intensify the desire to reappropriate religious heir- looms. So when Jacob Elbaum of the Hebrew University came to write of "late sixteenth-century Jewish literature in Poland and Ashkenaz" in his new Hebrew study titled Openness and Insularity, Baron's volume did not merit even a single citation, an omission that cannot be accounted for solely by the Jerusalem School's general antipathy for him. Baron had simply failed to show that his exhaustive political and economic analysis had much bearing on Jewish inner life. Elbaum worked in the belief that the formative factors were religious and intellectual, mainly internal, minimally external. Though treating of the same community in its period of ascendancy, these two books sprang from different mental states."3 Ours is a politically secure generation hungry for the sacred. Its guide to the past is not Baron but Gershom Scholem, and its own historians tend to concentrate on subjects of religious import often studied from an exclusively internal perspective. If Scholem fertilized all sectors of Jewish thought with his lifelong study of kabbalah, contemporary scholarship is rediscovering the magic of midrash. The present temper prefers text to context, literature to history, meaning to significance, and regards Baron as the pinnacle of positivistic Wissenschaft. Unfortunately, his later unfinished work supports the impression. He lost sight of the unique religious impulse which, he believed, lent unity to the totality of Jewish history. Inspired by that impulse he had dedicated his life to telling and retelling the heroic epic of a people in defiance of nature. In the process he consistently reaffirmed the fundamen- 30.
