Eerdmans, 1990. xx, 284 pp. "The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me." The sweeping pronouncement of Leviticus 25:23 and the peculiar rules of land tenure that surround it are the starting point for this study, a revised version of the author's 1977 doctoral dissertation. Its purpose is to show how the socioeconomic circumstances of</page><page sequence="2">292 BOOK REVIEWS ancient Israel were used to formulate the ideology of the relationship with God that is recorded in the Hebrew Bible. That ideology saw as its ideal the family with modest landholdings, and in consequence formulated its laws and institutions to protect that unit, while at the same time imposing ethical norms upon its members. The book is in three parts. The first part examines the nature of landholding and of the Israelite family. The landowning household was of central impor- tance in Israel's relationship with God, in the military, judicial, and religious spheres. Membership of such a household, whether as family member, slave, or associated alien, was necessary to enjoy the protection of that relationship, which could be lost either through misconduct by the individual, such as a rebellious son, or through economic adversity leading to loss of the family's land and the scattering of its members. The second part details the ethics that apply to land and other property. These consist of rules to protect the owner's rights, such as redemption, Jubilee, and the prohibitions on the removal of landmarks, and on theft and coveting; and of responsibilities imposed upon property owners, such as the fallow year and release, which are owed directly to God, preserving one's landholding and honoring one's parents, which are owed to the family, and miscellaneous rules for the benefit of third parties, such as workers on the land, visitors, and neighbors. The third part looks inside the family at relationships between the head of household and dependent members. It considers to what extent wives and children were regarded as the former's property, and the rules applicable to slaves. The conclusion discusses how the property ethics of the Hebrew Bible can be employed as part of Christian ethics in modern conditions. The book's argument is clearly presented, if somewhat marked by a reductionist tendency. A single ancient ideology is presumed, without dif- ferentiation between schools of thought, such as the Deuteronomistic or the Priestly. At times, enthusiasm to include texts under the rubric of land ownership leads to some distortion of their scope, as where the goring-ox law is said to be for the protection of others while on one's land, a condition nowhere suggested in the text; or where emphasis is given to the prohibition on coveting being designed to nip in the bud the accumulation of latifundia, whereas agricultural land is conspicuous for its absence from the list of property coveted in the Exodus version of the Decalogue. Because its analysis of biblical ideology is based on a particular view of</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 293 Israel's socioeconomic reality, the bulk of the book is given over to discussion of issues of social and legal history, through exegesis of the relevant texts. The author reviews the pertinent biblical scholarship until the mid-1980s and expresses his preference for particular theories, or occasionally gives his own interpretation, but adduces no new evidence or original theory, the reason being that neither the methodology of any of the social sciences nor material from the ancient Near East is utilized. The result in the first case is that confused or inaccurate use is made of concepts from these disciplines. Thus the author insists that Israelite land was inalienable, claiming that there was no legal method of acquiring land other than inheritance and no proper way to dispose of it except by apportioning it to one's heirs. Attested transfers, however, such as in Neh. 5:3, are excluded on the grounds that they were involuntary (pp. 55-57). But the voluntary or involuntary nature of the transfer is totally irrelevant to the concept of inalienability. In the second case, the result is unrealistic speculation. The author eschews all but occasional mention of ancient Near Eastern material, on the ground that his is not a comparative study. But the information that the Bible provides on social reality is obscure and fragmentary, and can only be properly understood in the context of the mass of data now available from ancient Israel's neighbors. It is no longer possible simply to continue in the manner of previous generations of scholars to whom these data were not available, as if in a vacuum. Where the author does refer to such material, reliance on tertiary sources-reports by other biblical scholars-leads to misinformation and false analogy. Its subtitle notwithstanding, then, the book is essentially a theological study. It is not recommended for students of ancient Israel's social, legal, or economic institutions.
