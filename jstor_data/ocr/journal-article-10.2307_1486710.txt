<plain_text><page sequence="1">Richard G. Marks. The Image ofBar Kokhba in Traditional Jewish Literature. False Messiah and National Hero. University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1994. xiii, 266 pp. The complex historical images and disparate interpretations of the events of Bar Kokhba's life and death are the subject of this volume. It seeks to be a "history of perceptions and meanings" (p. 3). Richard Marks strives to understand and evaluate the different perceptions that Jewish writers, in diverse times and places, formed of Bar Kohkba, and the changing meanings which disparate ages attached to this enigmatic figure. We read of "political and religious history revealed in the changing garb of a legendary hero-villain and his story" (p. 4). Marks begins with an overview of miscellaneous images and interpre- tations of Bar Kokhba, and asserts that rabbinic literature came to see him either as a messianic impostor "associated with eschatological expectations" or a flawed hero "associated with the downfall of Betar as it was retold each Ninth of Av" (p. 56). Both traditions point to an anxiety about self-determined</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 395 attempts for redemption, and both images "ask people to look beyond him . . . and turn their eyes to heaven, from which alone would come redemption and the power to attain it" (ibid.). The second chapter surveys these images in the writings of Ibn Daud and Maimonides. For the former, Bar Kokhba "stood as a warning against support for any messianic claimant" (p. 97), while the latter tried to reduce the danger of messianic movements by seeking to discover laws that made support "for even a tentative messiah unlikely" (ibid.). Marks then examines material from Isaac Abravanel and several sixteenth-century authors, including Samuel Usque, Azariah de' Rossi, and David Gans. A very short chapter considers the images of Bar Kokhba in the "later Kabbalah," and a brief summary completes the volume. Marks concludes that up to the seventh century, the two rabbinic tra- ditions about Bar Kokhba-that he was a false messiah and a military hero-dominated Jewish thought. For Ibn Daud and Maimonides, Bar Kokhba seemed to assume the characteristics of a human ruler acting through the natural, political process. While Abravanel saw Bar Kokhba as "a divinely appointed agent of vengeance" (p. 202), sixteenth-century historians differed widely in their views of him. Later kabbalists--Hayim Vital, Jacob Sasportas, and Nathan of Gaza---came to see in Bar Kokhba different shades of the messianic soul developing toward full messianic status. Throughout the millennia, Jewish writers did not ignore the darker side of the flawed hero who appears before us warts and all-failing to throw off the yoke of Roman oppression, falsely appearing as a messianic pretender, and, through his failed rebellion, unleashing dire and catastrophic consequences upon his people. Yet Jewish writers never left Bar Kokhba wholly unredeemed. Subsequent literature found hope and significance in the agony and ruins of Betar. History, theodicy, the yearning for redemption, and political quietism could all be defended by appeal to Bar Kokhba's life and death. Even though Marks's monograph reliably explores the myriad facets of Bar Kokhba as reflected in the sources under scrutiny, each chapter seems somewhat limited in scope and intellectual daring. Perhaps the volume would have been more compelling, the images more memorable, the overall impact greater, had the material been presented differently. For example, Ibn Daud seems to fit better in the chapter on historical writings than with Maimonides. And a broader analysis of Maimonides would have revealed, more clearly and vividly than does the present arrangement, how Maimonides adapted and interpreted rabbinic dicta in his writings. Also, a deeper consideration of</page><page sequence="3">396 BOOK REVIEWS the whole issue of messianism within the Maimonidean corpus would have enriched immeasurably the section on Rambam, and located Bar Kokhba within the rich vein of Maimonides' thought. The few pages on later kabbalism also need to be situated within the broader context of Jewish messianism and general Jewish mystical thought, especially those areas dealing specifically with messianic ideas. Because the author mentions a children's game, "Bar Kohkba and the Romans," played earlier in this century in Eastern Europe and nowadays in Israel, he perhaps hints at the uses and abuses of Bar Kokhba in the modern period. Perhaps Marks will go on, in future studies, to explore how Zionist thinkers and their opponents appropriated or discredited the past, thereby adding a rich chapter to this engaging topic. His even-handed and objective volume illuminates the treatment of this most enigmatic figure by Jewish authors through the centuries. Stephen D.
