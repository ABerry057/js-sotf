<plain_text><page sequence="1">Susan Niditch. War in the Hebrew Bible: A Study in the Ethics of Violence. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. xii, 180 pp. In this concise and accessible monograph, Susan Niditch contributes significantly to the ongoing discussion of war ideologies in ancient Israel as evidenced in texts of the Hebrew Bible. This is a topic area largely ignored in the biblical field until recently, as the author points out. When it has not been ignored, simplistic, linear developmental models often have been employed in attempts to understand Israelite views of war. Niditch, to her credit, rejects such approaches. Instead, she allows for various competing ideologies of war existing simultaneously in Israel, both early and late; some of these ideologies share common characteristics, but each is distinct from the others, and all have equal claim to "authenticity." The author describes the history of "attitudes to war" in ancient Israel as complex, "involving multiplicity, overlap, and self-contradiction" (p. 154). She demonstrates convincingly that there was neither a single Israelite war ideology nor a consistently privileged one among several. Niditch reconstructs a range of war ideologies reflected in texts of the</page><page sequence="2">396 BOOK REVIEWS Hebrew Bible and identifies the cultural and historical contexts that might have generated and supported each of them. Seven in all are reconstructed: (1) the "ban" (hjrenm) as sacrifice to YHWH; (2) the "ban" as God's justice; (3) a Priestly ideology of war in Numbers 31; (4) the elite bardic tradition of ritualized battle as sport; (5) the ideology of "tricksterism," associated with marginal characters who practice deception; (6) the ideology of expediency, where anything goes; and (7) nonparticipation (salvation through miraculous intervention by God). To each of these ideologies Niditch devotes a chapter. Each discussion is insightful and interesting. I am especially struck by the author's convincing argument for two hiirem ideologies, and her successful attempt to place the "ban" and its demand for extirpation in its wider cultural and religious context. This monograph has a number of strengths: a methodologically sophis- ticated approach to the study of war, utilizing social scientific theory in a judicious way; many insightful readings of biblical texts; clear writing and excellent organization. Though Niditch's work is intended for a broad audience, a careful reading of it will also profit specialists. But there are weaknesses of style and substance that must be noted. Many are the errors of spelling, typing, and Hebrew transliteration, which are distracting, and could easily have been prevented; in addition, the index is of limited utility because it contains mistakes: In terms of substance, problems sometimes arise when Niditch deals with interpretive issues tangential to her major theme, e.g., creation and temple building in Near Eastern myth (p. 38); or mnlek and child sacrifice (pp. 48, 56). These complex problems deserve the same kind of nuanced, sophisticated treatment Niditch provides in her theoretical discussions and in her exegeses of biblical texts central to her thesis. Given the problems of style and substance, I am left with the impression that the manuscript was rushed to publication. Saul M. Olyan Brown University Providence, R.I.</page></plain_text>
