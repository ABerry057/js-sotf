Jerusalem: Zalman Shazar Center for Jewish History, 2002. 395 pp. (Hebrew) In the concluding pages of Kimmy Caplan's book, the author asks his ulti- mate question: "Did the Immigrant rabbis and preachers succeed?" (p. 312) To achieve success, in the eyes of Caplan, is to stimulate an emotionally charged re- sponse or to generate a change in perspective or action. Historians, as modern historiography has made clear, are nary different from preachers. Caplan's exceptionally well-researched book might not meet the stan- dards he sets for his preachers, but it is definitely an outstanding work of Ameri- can Jewish scholarship and the most comprehensive treatment of the American immigrant Orthodox rabbinate to date. The present work is a revision of Caplan's doctoral dissertation, completed at the Hebrew University under the tutelage of Joseph Dan. Caplan's book begins with a full discussion of the history and historiography of American Orthodoxy, relying heavily on social historian Jeffrey Gurock. Intellectual integrity demands that the author raise some of the serious methodological concerns related to writ- ing a history of the American Orthodox derashah (sermon), and he does this deft- ly. His use of Saperstein's and Blondheim's writings gradually delineates the locus of his discussion: the meeting point of the classical Eastern European Orthodox derashah and the modern Jewish American experience. Admittedly, Caplan cannot provide parallels to the American immigrant de- rashah, primarily because the historical events of 1904-1905 and the outbreak of the first world war uprooted Orthodox life in Eastern Europe. Instead, Caplan at- tempts to analyze, at least briefly in the last chapter, the connection between the Protestant and non-Orthodox sermons in America and the Orthodox ones. The first chapter sketches the transformation of rabbis from the old world to the new. Caplan admirably traces the conflict and challenges of the immigrant rab- bi and even attempts to compare the experience of the immigrant rabbi to that of other immigrants. Unfortunately, there is no summary that analyzes the extent to which immigrant rabbis were sui generis in the context of the mass immigration to America. Further, although Caplan has a relatively long discussion of the return of immigrant rabbis to Eastern Europe, he does not cite Jonathan Sarna's classic essay "The Myth of No Return," which suggested that between five and eight per- cent of all immigrants retraced their steps. Caplan continues with a discussion of the historical context of these preach- ers and their sermons. It is within this context that the reader feels that "more is less." Caplan has chosen to focus on seven preachers (who are given partial bi- ographies in an appendix to the book), but the twenty-plus different rabbis dis- cussed throughout the book are difficult to track, primarily because so much information is provided about each one and because incidental anecdotes perme- ate almost every discussion. In one paragraph, for example, we learn that Rabbi Zalman Yakov Friederman is buried next to Rabbi Abraham Isaac ha-Kohen Kook on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem; that Rabbi Israel Levinthal was almost killed in a terrorist action in 1936; and that Rabbi Gedalia Silvestron was on a boat with Rab- 346</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews bi Levinthal when they traveled to Israel (p. 82). None of these facts is critical to the central narrative. In addition, rules of organization are sometimes not followed. For example, though the author generally lists the years of each individual rabbi when that rabbi is introduced, the years of Aaron Gorowitz (1870-1958) only ap- pear the fourth time he is mentioned in the book (p. 203). A further complication is provided by the illustrations provided in one of the appendices. Ten photographs of rabbis appear, but it is wholly unclear why some of the less-discussed rabbis (such as Rabbi Hayyim Hirschenson) are included while others are neglected. Still, these are minor points, and they do not detract from the wide-ranging and superb portrayals that this book has to offer. Chapters Three and Four move from the contextual to the textual as Caplan describes the formulas and sources used by immigrant Orthodox preachers. Whereas most of this section is very descriptive, a few portions are merely sug- gestive. The author makes clear that the sources that were accessible to American Orthodox immigrants were limited, but it is left for the reader to surmise why at least two rabbis quoted extensively from the Kuzari ofYehuda Halevi, one surrep- titiously! (p. 166). Orthodoxy in the New World concludes with a discussion of the transforma- tion of the American derashah from the old world to the new. For Caplan, this sheds significant light on the history of American Orthodoxy, but as Caplan himself notes, this is only one piece of the puzzle of the development of American Ortho- doxy. Caplan's discussion neglects the evolution of an American halakha, so crit- ical to the self-definition of Orthodoxy. This lacuna cannot go unmentioned, yet it is hardly noticeable in this excellent portrayal of the popular religious culture of American immigrant Orthodox rabbis.
