Philadelphia: Jew- ish Publication Society, 2003. xv, 207 pp. 160</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews In this wide-ranging overview of biblical literature, Israel Knohl argues that the Hebrew Bible does not present a consistent or monolithic viewpoint concern- ing ancient Israel's or Judaism's understanding of God, itself, and the world in which it lived. Rather, Knohl contends that the Bible presents a pluralism of view- points that to a great degree anticipates the pluralistic outlook of Rabbinic Judaism. This will hardly come as a surprising thesis to anyone familiar with modern bibli- cal and theological scholarship. Indeed, it takes up the classic question of unity and diversity within the Hebrew Bible that might be illustrated by Gerhard von Rad's well-known Old Testament Theology. Von Rad recognized the diversity of tradi- tions that informed the various writings and viewpoints now gathered in the Bible while simultaneously trying to systematize them into a general concept of Heils- geschichte, that is, "salvation history" or "sacred history." Such Heilsgeschichte moved inexorably to what von Rad believed would be the ultimate culmination of human history. Knohl's contribution comes not in relation to the model of plural- ism in the Bible per se, but in relation to his argument that so much of the priest- ly literature that engages in pluralistic debate with other biblical works is rooted in the monarchic period of ancient Israel's (or Judah's) history. In this respect, Knohl's own work-although original in its own right-owes much to an earlier model ad- vocated by Yehezkel Kaufmann, one of the founding fathers of modern Israeli bib- lical scholarship. Knohl's work is rooted in Kaufmann's fundamental challenge to Julius Well- hausen's literary-critical model for the formation of the Pentateuch. Wellhausen ar- gued that the priestly source represented both the final stage in the literary histo- ry of the Pentateuch and the rise of the Temple priesthood to full leadership over the Jewish people in the post-exilic period. In Wellhausen's model, the priestly source represented a distant, all-powerful and holy God, who relied on law to en- force social and theological uniformity. Older models of a more approachable and flexible God in the J, E, and D sources were suppressed when the P source was em- ployed to systematize the presentation of the Pentateuch and meld these other viewpoints into a single literary work. Knohl argues instead that the so-called priestly literature of the Pentateuch displays a great deal of diversity within itself, and that this diversity points to the variety of viewpoints found within the P literature, the setting of significant por- tions of the priestly literature in the monarchic period, and its interaction with oth- er monarchic period works. He begins his study by arguing that the editing of the Torah represents the first stage in the formation of the Bible. In his view, such an editorial process entailed the gathering of material concerning creation, the patri- archs, the Exodus, the wilderness wandering, festival observance, etc., that had been known by the Temple priesthood but not by the population at large. To sup- port his view, he points to statements in Nehemiah 8 to indicate that the people were unaware of the observance of Sukkot or other observances and to inconsis- tencies within the Torah (e.g., the means by which the Passover offering is cooked) that point to the variety of viewpoints found within. Knohl's model for the chronology of editing the Pentateuch thus resembles Wellhausen's to a certain degree, but it differs by pointing to democratization in the study of Torah rather than a legalistic suppression of Jewish thought and reli- 161</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews giosity. Knohl argues that the crucial problem faced by the P writers was the prob- lem of evil, and he maintains that the P writers demythologized earlier notions of diverse gods associated with nature by positing a model of primordial evil that had been suppressed by the order of creation. Nevertheless, evil continued to reinfuse the world of creation, and it would be the task of the priestly writers to develop a system for moral conduct by which human beings might resist the continuing in- fluence of evil in the world. In order to support his contention that the priestly tradition engaged this de- bate in the monarchic period, Knohl first points to Isaiah's (and other prophets') critique of Temple ritual in which the prophet decries ritual observance without moral foundation. To a large degree, his viewpoint concerning Isaiah and the prophets overlooks the rhetorical dimensions of the text, that is, to what extent do the prophets' caricaturize the objects of their criticism? Did Temple ritual truly es- chew moral concerns (see, e.g., Psalms 15; 24), or was that Isaiah's way of dis- crediting the priesthood to make way for his own understanding of God and hu- man responsibility? Knohl contends that Isaiah's critique prompted a reaction within the priesthood that came to expression in the Holiness Code now found in Leviticus 17-26, which articulates a combination of ritual and moral concerns. The Holiness School thus represents an early attempt within the priesthood to col- lect early tradition, to reflect upon it, and to develop a synthesis between the prac- tices and beliefs of the priesthood and the people at large. According to Knohl, the Holiness School calls for all Israel to be holy, not just the priests, and thereby be- gins the process by which the study of Torah is democratized among the entire Jew- ish people. Although the debate within the priestly tradition emerges within the monar- chic period, it influences the development of Judaism throughout the Second Tem- ple period as well. The demise of Israelite/Judean kingship opens the way for the priestly contention that only God is king and that the divine royal representative is no longer conceived as a human king but as a quasi-divine messianic figure. Old- er views of human sacrifice reemerged as calls for animal sacrifice and human ser- vice to God. Ezekiel reflects a debate among the prophets concerning divine de- terminism and human freedom and responsibility. Second Isaiah conceives of Israel as the high priest among the nations whose task is to expiate the idolatry of the nations. Job points to such freedom and responsibility among the nations as well. A concluding chapter points to the origins of Second Temple sectarianism, insofar as the Pharisees were the heirs of the Holiness School and the Sadducees were the heirs of a distant and removed Priestly School. These divisions emerge in Rabbinic Judaism as the schools of Hillel and Shammai with their very different approaches to halakhah. One may note the degree to which Knohl is actually dependent on the Well- hausenian model of a legalistic and detached priesthood. Yes, the priests may have been cloistered, but were the people so ignorant of priestly teachings and the priest- hood so aloof as Knohl contends? Why then would the people ever have support- ed the Temple in the first place? Likewise, we may ask to what extent the early priesthood eschewed moral concerns and sought to suppress earlier traditions. 162</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews Does not the incorporation of earlier tradition point to an inherent adaptability within the priesthood? Nevertheless, Knohl reminds us to reconsider our own ten- dencies to systematize biblical literature and our own penchant for identifying con- sistent biblical, priestly, or even prophetic viewpoints.
