<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLTAIRE ON JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY by ALLAN ARKUSH Voltaire's voluminous writings on religion contain, as is well known, a large number of attacks on the Jewish people and Judaism. Historians have offered a variety of explanations for this sustained animosity on the part of a great rationalist and proponent of religious toleration toward a people and a religion which continued, in his own day, to be victimized by unjust persecution. While much remains in dispute, there does seem to be general agreement that Voltaire attacked Judaism at least in part because its most sacred texts constituted the foundation of Christianity, the religion he wished to destroy. According to Hanna Emmrich, the author of the only book-length study of his attitude to the Jews and their religion, Voltaire assailed Judaism because it was "the basis of Christianity, and whoever attacks one must also attack the other."' Peter Gay, too, believes that Voltaire "struck at the Jews to strike at the Christians." His "anti-Jewish remarks are," he writes, "a partly unconscious, partly conscious cloak for his anti-Christian statements."2 These scholars have concluded, with good reason, that Voltaire was following in the footsteps of various eighteenth-century deists who employed a similar strategy in their struggle against Christianity. Arthur Hertzberg, in his important and influential work, The French Enlightenment and the Jews, takes issue with those who have sought to I would like to thank the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation for the research fellowship that helped support the writing of this essay.

Nevertheless, even Hertzberg emphasizes that the misdeed for which Voltaire places the greatest blame on the Jews is the propagation of the Christian religion. He elaborates on this theme in a passage from which it would be best to quote at length. The nucleus of Voltaire's view of the Jews, however, amounts to this: there is a cultural, philosophical, and ethnic tradition of Europe which descended, through the human stock of that continent, from the intellectual values that were taught by the Greeks. Those were in turn carried to all the reaches of the European world by the Romans. This is the normative culture of which Voltaire approved. The Jews are a different family, and their religion is rooted in their character. Christianity is the Jewish religion superimposed on people of a different world, both ethnically and culturally. It is somewhat better than Judaism because it has been affected by the nature of those who have adopted it and by their earlier, healthier tradition. After reviewing Voltaire's diagnosis of the situation, Hertzberg describes the therapy which he supposedly recommended for Christians, if not for Jews. It is possible to redeem Europe by reviving its attachment to its own fundamental nature and tradition. European men can be freed effectively of Christianity because Christianity is here a long-standing infection; it is not one of the foundations of the European spirit, deriving from its character. The case of the Jews is radically different. Being born a Jew and the obnoxiousness of the Jewish outlook are indissoluble; it is most unlikely that "enlightened" Jews can escape their innate character. The Jews are subversive of the European tradition by their very presence, for they are the radically other, the hopelessly alien. Cure them of their religion and their inborn character remains.' 3.

Ibid., p. 307.</page><page sequence="3">VOLTAIRE ON JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY 225 According to Hertzberg, Voltaire believed that the Jews remained the same innately corrupt people they had always been and that they were still capable of doing additional harm, in the future, to the Europeans among whom they lived. But the chief manifestation of their pernicious character was, in his eyes, the "infection" which they had long ago transmitted to Europe, i.e., Christianity. In Hertzberg's opinion, then, Voltaire singled out the Jews not simply in order to pursue an indirect or veiled attack on the Christian religion but, in large part, because he considered them to be responsible for the very existence of that religion. Voltaire, Hertzberg says, regarded himself as a kind of Cicero redivivus, a man whose task it was to recreate the "true philosophy and culture" of the Greco-Roman world which had been "ruined by the advent of Christianity."6 Just as Cicero and other ancient writers had denounced both Judaism and Christianity as barbarous superstitions threatening the integrity of classical culture, Voltaire, employing their arguments, assailed the Jews and their religion on account of the part they had played and continued to play in the subversion of Western culture. He thereby became the "major link in Western intellectual history between the anti-Semitism of classic paganism and the modern age."7 Hertzberg may very well be correct in attributing to Voltaire a pivotal role in the history of antisemitism. He may also be correct in believing that Voltaire regarded the Jews of his own day as a people capable of continuing to subvert European culture.8 He is wrong, however, to claim that he held them responsible for the scourge of Christianity. While Voltaire certainly identified Judaism as a parent of Christianity, he by no means saw the two as constituting essentially the same religion. Christianity differed fundamentally from Judaism, in his opinion, and was in some crucial respects not better but worse than it. What rendered it inferior to Judaism stemmed in part from its ex-Jewish originators but in much larger part from the classical cultural ambit 6. Ibid., p. 299. 7. Ibid., p. 10. 8. It must be said, however, that he provides very little evidence of this. He does note that in his Lettres de Memmius a' Cicdron (1771) Voltaire has Memmius describe the Jews as follows: "They are, all of them, born with raging fanaticism in their hearts, just as the Bretons and the Germans are born with blond hair. I would not be in the least bit surprised if these people would not some day become deadly to the human race" (p. 300). But this solitary statement, placed in the mouth of an ancient Roman, hardly constitutes proof that Voltaire himself believed that contemporary Jews posed an ongoing threat to European civilization.</page><page sequence="4">226 ALLAN ARKUSH in which the new religion moved during the first centuries of its existence. However much Voltaire may have feared the Jewish threat in his own day, he did not, therefore, regard Christianity as a Jewish infection to which other, healthier peoples had somehow fallen victim. To the extent that Hertzberg departs from Emmrich's and Gay's assessment of the relationship between Voltaire's attacks on the Jews and Judaism and his hostility to Christianity, he does so, one must conclude, in the wrong direction. In order to substantiate these assertions it will be necessary to weigh the evidence Hertzberg adduces to support his position. After doing so, we will broaden our perspective and examine the most important criteria by which Voltaire evaluated the virtues and vices of different religions. With the benefit of this survey we will be able to consider his assessment of Judaism and Christianity and the relationship between them, the relative merits of the two religions, and the factors responsible for Christianity's ultimate conquest of the Greco-Roman world. We will then seek to explain certain of Voltaire's statements that may appear to conflict with some aspects of this assessment. Hertzberg amply documents his contention that Voltaire regarded the Jews as an innately inferior people. He cites, however, only a single passage from the Essai sur les moeurs in support of his argument that Voltaire regarded Christianity as being tantamount to "the Jewish religion superimposed on people of a different world." Here Voltaire approvingly quotes Maimonides' idea that the Jews were the progenitors of Christianity and calls them "our fathers." He says explicitly that the Jewish "people ought to interest us, because we ourselves are basically only uncircumcised Jews."' This passage does seem unequivocally to support Hertzberg's argument. But can it really bear all of the weight he places on it? It comes, as Hertzberg himself notes, from a work which Voltaire wrote relatively early in his career. In his later writings dealing much more extensively with Judaism and Christianity, Voltaire takes a rather different tack. He repeatedly notes the Jewish parentage of the latter religion, but he does not again say, to the best of my knowledge, that the Christians "are basically only uncircumcised Jews," or anything to that effect. Voltaire does, admittedly, make a number of other statements, not cited by Hertzberg, that might seem to support his interpretation. We will examine some of these remarks toward the conclusion of this paper, when we will be in a position to evaluate them within the 9. Hertzberg, French Enlightenment and the Jews, p. 302.</page><page sequence="5">VOLTAIRE ON JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY 227 broader context of Voltaire's entire conception of the relationship between Judaism and Christianity. In support of his contention that Voltaire regarded Christianity as a somewhat better form of Judaism, Hertzberg brings no evidence whatsoever. It is possible that he is resting his case here on those passages in which Voltaire disparages the Jews for their failure to accept certain Christian dogmas. If so, he is making a mistake, for, as Peter Gay has observed, on such occasions Voltaire "was of course pretending to censure attitudes he shared with enthusiasm."' It is, on the other hand, possible that Hertzberg has simply deduced Voltaire's preference for Christianity from what he understands to be his ethnic hierarchy. He may have assumed that since he ranked the Europeans higher than the Jews, he must also have considered their version of Judaism to be superior to the original. In actuality, his position was, as will be demonstrated below, quite different. We must turn now to a consideration of Voltaire's basic religious views. The first thing we should note is that we are dealing with a man who was by no means an enemy of religion per se. Voltaire often proclaimed his faith in God and indicated the simple, broad outlines of the kind of religion which he considered to be of benefit to mankind. Such a religion affirmed, in brief, that "there is a God, and men must be just."" It consisted entirely of the worship of God and the practice of justice, tolerance, and humanity.12 God, according to Voltaire, was unique and eternal, the remunerator of virtue and the punisher of crime.'" In order to inculcate this last principle effectively, he believed, a religion must include a belief in the immortality of the soul. He himself apparently had his doubts about human immortality, but he defended it nonetheless, since he believed that only this "terrible dogma" has the power to "curb secret crime."14 True worship of God consists, Voltaire states, of moral actions, not of 10.

It does not order them to believe impossible, contradictory things, injurious to the Deity and pernicious in their effect on the human race. It does not employ executioners to uphold its beliefs, nor does it inundate the globe with blood for the sake of unintelligible sophisms."6 It never attempts to force anyone to believe anything." According to the true religion, finally, all men are equal in the eyes of their creator, "and it is therefore absurd and impious to say that the common father chose a small number of his children to exterminate the others in his name."18 All religions, except the one taught and practiced by the scattered minority of true theists, have fallen short, in the course of history, of this universal, natural religion. Indeed, Voltaire's very definition of this religion amply reflects, in its negative emphases, his strong disapproval of existing religions. But all religions are not, in his eyes, equally bad, nor are all aspects of bad religions equally pernicious. In the entry entitled "Religion" in his Philosophical Dictionary, Voltaire draws a distinction between state religion and theological religion. State religion is concerned with external things, such as the maintenance of temples, days consecrated to worship and rest, rites established by law, registers of circumcision or baptism, and public teaching of morality. "A state religion can never cause any turmoil." State religion may contain, it seems, all sorts of superstitions, but it is at least capable of supporting civil order and may prove to be tolerant of other religions. Theological religion, unlike state religion, is concerned with the propagation of religious dogmas. It is "the source of all the follies and turmoils imaginable; it is the mother of fanaticism and civil discord; it is the enemy of mankind.""9 If theological religion under all circumstances breeds fanaticism, it is at its worst when it results in differing interpretations of religious dogmas and the consequent formation of sects within a single religious community. The leaders of such sects have a vested interest in perpetuating their followers' separate identity-the ultimate source of their own power and wealth. The 15.

Having surveyed some of the central aspects of Voltaire's general under- standing of the nature of religion and its social role, we are now prepared to consider his discussion of the two religions of concern to us here, Judaism and Christianity. We will begin with a review of some of the main points of his unremittingly-but not unqualifiedly-hostile characterization of biblical and postbiblical Judaism. We will then turn to an examination of his changing evaluation of the place of Jesus and the sect he founded within the Jewish world. After that, we will consider his account of how this sect evolved into an entirely new religion, Christianity. Finally, we will outline the main points of his utterly antagonistic evaluation of the Christian religion. It will not be necessary, for our purposes, to review in detail all aspects of what George Eliot once called Voltaire's "fulminations" against the Jews. What we will have to examine is the most important ways in which Judaism fails, in his opinion, to measure up to the standards of "universal, natural religion." Judaism, according to Voltaire, (1) propounds a false conception of God, (2) contains deeply flawed moral teachings, and (3) manifests a spirit of fanaticism and intolerance. But it also has some virtues, which partly mitigate some of its faults. The Judaism of the Old Testament, according to Voltaire, fails the very first test of a true religion: it is not monotheistic. He repeatedly adduces biblical passages in which Jews make reference to non-Jewish gods in a manner that reflects belief in their actual existence, such as Joshua 24:15 ff.21 On the basis of such passages he concludes that the Jews evidently believed in the reality of other peoples' gods and held "that each little people had its own particular god."22 Voltaire's emphasis on this point was no doubt intended primarily to deprive the Jews of any credit for originating true monotheism and to underline the primitiveness of their religious understanding. The Old Testament, Voltaire stresses on a number of occasions, is utterly devoid of any reference to the immortality of the soul. It speaks of a God 20. Philosophical Dictionary, s.v. "Toleration," p. 487. 21. Cf. Emmrich, Das Judentum bei Voltaire, pp. 147 ff., for a host of additional examples. 22.

Despite his doubts concerning the truth of this dogma, he was convinced that it was a necessary component of popular religion, and he faulted ancient Judaism for lacking it.24 The practice of religion, according to Voltaire, should not include the performance of irrational and superstitious rituals. Judaism, he contends, abounds with them. "With regard to their ceremonies," he writes, "is there anything more disgusting, more revolting, and at the same time more puerile?" To justify his indignation he refers, among other examples, to the description in Leviticus of the sin-offering to be presented by the high priest. "Is it really agreeable to the Being of all Beings to burn on a stone the intestines and the feet of animals? What could result from this but an insupportable stench?"25 It is not necessary for our present purposes to cite additional examples of Voltaire's mocking description of Jewish rites, from circumcision to the celebration of Passover.26 The chief problem with ancient Judaism was not, in the end, the impurity of its monotheism, the incompleteness of its depiction of divine retribution, or the absurdity of its ritual practices, but the support it offered for immorality and intolerance. Voltaire, as we know, combed the Old Testament for illustrations of the way in which its God commanded what he regarded as immoral actions and the manner in which the Jews performed them. Again, our purposes do not require us to survey the whole range of such immoral practices, as Emmrich has done so thoroughly.27 We need only note that according to Voltaire the Book of Leviticus (27:29) stoops so low as expressly to command the sacrifice of human beings to God. It was in obedience to this supposed law that Jephthah sacrificed his daughter and Samuel, at a later date, slaughtered Agag, the Amalekite king, after Saul had pardoned him.28 In the name of the same God who commanded human sacrifices, the 23.

"If it be permitted to judge the laws of the Lord in the light of the laws of our civilized peoples," he says, in caustic commentary, "one would perhaps find it a trifle harsh to make a man perish for having gathered a little wood which he probably needed in order to boil milk for his children, or in order to prepare his family's dinner.""3 Voltaire likewise criticizes the severe punishment of those guilty of worshiping other gods. The priests of Baal, for instance, who competed with Elijah on Mount Carmel, were every bit as devoted to their god as Elijah was to his. Punishing them with death was, in Voltaire's eyes, "a terrible injustice."3' When Voltaire excoriated those who say that mankind's common father "chose a small number of his children to exterminate the others in his name," it is clear enough whom he had in mind. He frequently characterizes the Jews as a people who considered themselves to have been specially selected by God and who treated all other peoples cruelly. The crime with which he most frequently charges them is their expropriation of Canaan and their ruthless extermination of its previous inhabitants. "The Jewish people was a pretty barbarous people. It butchered without pity all the inhabitants of an unfortunate little country to which it had no more right than it did to Paris or London."32 As Emmrich has observed, the extermination of the prior inhabitants of Canaan is something which Voltaire regards as being in essence a form of human sacrifice mandated by the Jewish God.33 Biblical Judaism was, for Voltaire, rooted in ignorance, unjust, oppressive, and harsh in its attitude to non-Jews. For all of its faults, however, it did at least have two "negative virtues." It was not, to begin with, a theological religion. Judaism did not really have any dogmas but consisted entirely of prescribed practices.34 "It has been demonstrated," he writes, "as well as anything can be demonstrated in history, that the religion of the Jews was, during their period of wandering and during the period of their kings, nothing 29.

When he cites previous scholars who maintained that the Jews did not really have a well-established theology until after their return from the Babylonian exile, he is in fact basically making a point in early Judaism's favor (notwithstanding that he regarded the absence of a doctrine of immortality as a drawback).36 Voltaire's other reason for finding some favor in Judaism is, somewhat surprisingly, the degree to which it was compatible in certain respects with a spirit of toleration. Although he emphasizes the Jews' deplorably hateful attitude toward other nations, he also points out that, to their credit, they at least did not believe that they had the duty or the right to impose their religion on all of them. The Old Testament supplies a number of examples of their "leniency" toward others. There is the example of Elisha the prophet, who grants permission to Naaman the Aramean, whom he has cured of leprosy, to "worship the God of the Jews out of gratitude" and "to worship the God of his king at the same time." The Jews "thought it right that Chemosh gave a certain district to the Moabites, provided their God gave them one too. Jacob didn't hesitate to marry the daughter of an idolator. Laban had his God as Jacob had his." It may not have been to the Jews' credit, intellectually speaking, but it apparently was to their moral credit that while they "worshipped their God, they were never astonished that each nation should have its own."37 Voltaire never explains when, if ever, Judaism reached the level of true monotheism. He does, however, note that in the postbiblical period it finally acquired a doctrine of immortality. On one occasion he attributes this doctrinal change to the influence of the Zoroastrian religion on Judaism.38 Elsewhere he argues, in a much more detailed fashion, that it occurred as a result of the first, and less fateful, of two historical encounters between groups of Palestinian Jews and Platonic philosophy. In chapter 3 of his Histoire de l'Etablissement du Christianisme, in the midst of his discussion of Christianity's Jewish background, Voltaire outlines the system developed by Plato in several of his works. He describes briefly 35. Ibid., p. 166. 36. Ibid., p. 167. 37. "Toleration," pp. 483-484. 38. Dictionnaire Philosophique, Oeuvres Completes, vol. 18, p. 160.</page><page sequence="11">VOLTAIRE ON JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY 233 the Phaedon's doctrine of immortality, the Republic's doctrine of the other world, and the doctrine of the logos presented in the Timaeus. This Platonic philosophy constitutes, from Voltaire's point of view, anything but a healthy tradition. He refers to it here as an "absurd gibberish" that seduced Greece.39 On another occasion, he spoke of Plato as an obscure, scarcely intelligible thinker whose reputation among Romans, Asians, and Africans was due only to his dazzling sophisms.40 He describes him, in short, with the kind of disdain and disrespect that the philosophes often exhibited toward premodern metaphysicians. Under the influence of their Greek neighbors, Voltaire relates, many Egyptian Jews in Alexandria avidly took up the philosophy of Plato. They in turn transmitted it to Palestine. There the sect of the Pharisees "embraced all the dogmas of Plato: the soul, a delicate figure enclosed in a body; the immortal soul, having its good and its bad demon; the soul punished in hell, or rewarded in a kind of Elysium; the transmigrating soul, the resuscitated soul."41 Here Voltaire refers to the Pharisees as complete Platonists, even though he does not say anything about their having adopted, in particular, the teaching of the Timaeus regarding God's logos, his intermediary in the process of creation. We will see the significance of this omission in the next section, when we examine Voltaire's account of the second, more momentous encounter between Palestinian Jews and Platonism. While the Pharisees became Platonists, other Jews, who continued to adhere to the older form of Judaism, established the sect of the Sadducees. Still others founded new sects of their own, such as the Essenes, the disciples of John the Baptist, the Herodians, etc. For Voltaire, who regarded sectarianism as a very great danger, this represented an unfortunate development. In some of his writings he describes the way in which the division of the Jewish world into factions stirred considerable discord. At one point he notes how people "gave themselves over to theological disputes." The Pharisees and the Sadducees "troubled the state as much as they could."42 Elsewhere, however, he emphasizes other aspects of these sects' interrelationships. On a number of occasions he virtually marvels at their capacity to live together in peace. He states, for instance, that, despite the fact that they differed essentially from 39.

Dieu et les Hommes, p. 193.</page><page sequence="12">234 ALLAN ARKUSH one another, they "never had the slightest quarrel. These two rival sects lived together in peace, and took equal part in the honors of the synagogue."43 Voltaire is similarly impressed by another example of mutual forbearance within the Jewish world. During the period when the Jewish people was divided, as he puts it, into the mutually hostile groups of "Hebrew Jews" and "Samaritan Jews," there were never any wars of religion between them. "The Hebrew Jews never said to the Samaritans: Come sacrifice on Mount Moriah or I will kill you; the Samaritan Jews never said: Come sacrifice on Gerizim or I will exterminate you." In spite of the atrocious hate which the residents of Jerusalem had for the Samaritans, none of them ever wished "to constrain a citizen of Samaria to change his sect."44 Jesus himself, Voltaire observes, was initially only the founder of a new Jewish sect. His description of the momentous development of this sect underwent considerable modification over the years. Initially disposed to ridicule Jesus, he generally tended, in his later religious writings, to celebrate him as a great teacher of the universal and natural religion. The latter approach seems to reflect a change in his polemical strategy rather than any genuine alteration in his understanding of the historical Jesus. In his earlier as well as his later writings dealing with the life of Jesus, Voltaire consistently placed heavy emphasis on his Jewish origins. Voltaire, of course, did not see this as any kind of advantage. In his Examen Important de Milord Bolingbroke, published in 1766, he relates how Jesus was born into a Jewish world where fanaticism was still a dominant force, even if it had been somewhat diminished as a result of the Jews' increasing contacts with the Greeks and the Romans.45 For details concerning Jesus' early life he relied on the "Sepher Toldos Jeschut" (Sefer Toldot Yeshu), a medieval Jewish anti-Christian screed, which he considered to be flawed but, on the whole, more reliable than the gospels.46 After recounting Jesus' disgraceful origins, in the Examen Important, Voltaire proceeded to portray him, quite derisively, as a crude Judean peasant, 43. Ibid., p. 52. Cf. also Traitd sur Toldrance, p. 83. Peter Gay has stressed this point (Party of Humanity, p. 107). He quotes an entry in his notebooks where Voltaire describes the treatment accorded to the Sadducees as "a beautiful example of tolerance." He also identifes statements in his correspondence which indicate that "this is his true opinion." 44. De la Paix Perpdtuelle, Ouevres Compl&amp;tes, vol. 28, p. 106. 45.

Like George Fox, the founder of the Quakers, "he was an ignorant man from the dregs of the people, sometimes preaching, as he did, a proper morality, and preaching above all equality, which very much flattered the rabble."47 He succeeded in founding a sect, but not in escaping the wrath of his priestly opponents, who had him put to death. A more admiring description of Jesus appears in a work published in 1768, the Profession de Foi des Theistes. There Voltaire speaks of him as a man distinguished "by his zeal, his virtue, and his love of fraternal equality," a man who is to be lamented as a reformer "who was the victim of fanatic persecutors." He deserves to be honored as a great moral teacher, as "an Israelite theist."48 This new respect for Jesus, it seems most reasonable to conclude, reflects, as Ren6 Pomeau has contended, not a true change of heart but Voltaire's prudential decision (around 1767) to moderate his position somewhat and to describe him more sympathetically.49 Whether or not Pomeau is correct is not of any great importance, however, for our purposes. Whatever Voltaire really thought of Jesus, he always portrayed him as a man who remained a loyal, observant Jew throughout his life, a man who never had the slightest intention of breaking away from Judaism and starting a new religion but sought only to establish a new sect within the Jewish world.50 Only very gradually did the sect he founded give birth to a new religion, one which clearly represented, in Voltaire's eyes, something essentially different from Judaism. It will, again, not be necessary for us to follow closely Voltaire's numerous and somewhat inconsistent accounts of all of the steps which led from sectarian Judaism to full-blown Christianity. Of crucial significance, however, is the factor which he repeatedly identifies as the most decisive in effecting this transformation: Platonic philosophy. Like Jesus himself during his lifetime, Voltaire tells us, his followers, after his death, initially showed no trace of any interest in establishing a new religion. They confined themselves to saying to their fellow Jews: "You 47. Ibid., p. 227. 48. Profession de Foi des Thfistes, p. 69. 49. Ren6 Pomeau, La Religion de Voltaire (Paris, 1956), pp. 372-374. 50.

Their encounter in that city with Jews of a platonizing bent, the second of the meetings described by Voltaire between Palestinian Jews and Platonists, is an event of the utmost significance. It represents "the great nexus and the first development of Christianity," the "real beginning" of the religion.53 What Jesus' followers discovered in Alexandria was a world in which the philosophers, including Jews like Philo, propounded the doctrine presented in Plato's Timaeus. They spoke incessantly of the logos, the demiurge through which God had created the universe. Under the influence of these Platonists, the early Christians elevated Jesus to a new, supramundane status; they started calling him the "word."54 For them, Jesus ceased to be merely a man, and "little by little became a God engendered centuries earlier by another God, and incarnated at the prescribed time." It is thus apparent that "it was the philosophy of Plato that made Christianity." This new religion may have preserved the books of Judaism and some of its trappings, but it was nevertheless something "totally different in spirit.""55 It developed dogmas "absolutely different from those of Jesus" himself.56 Voltaire has a great deal to say about the distinctive doctrines developed by Christian theologians over the ensuing centuries. Again and again he reverts to the doctrines of original sin, the divinity and incarnation of the messiah, transubstantiation, etc. In all of his discussions he repeatedly stresses two things: (1) the absence of any Old Testament source for these dogmas, and (2) their complete irrationality.57 51.

The absurdity of Christianity's doctrines is matched, in his eyes, by the immorality of its clerics and its practitioners, a subject to which he frequently recurs. He plainly relishes detailing the scandalous misdeeds of popes, monks, and priests."5 He likewise scoffs at Christian rituals, such as the mass, in which a priest or a monk who may have just left "the arms of a prostitute" changes a "morsel of bread into God by means of a few Latin words."59 But neither Christianity's deplorably low standard of morality nor its superstitious rites are the real object of Voltaire's ire. What most profoundly outrages him is its intolerant spirit, its promotion throughout its history of the persecution of infidels as well as heretics. In his various histories of the rise of Christianity, Voltaire always stresses the fact that the religion was, from its earliest days, fragmented into sects propounding disparate interpretations of the Christian dogmas. Even before Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire, these sects fell under the leadership of contentious, power-hungry men. According to Voltaire, their ambitions, and not their sincerely held beliefs, impelled these Christian leaders to seek to eliminate the existing pagan religions and to promote their own versions of the Christian religion over those of their competitors.60 "Was there ever a single Pope," Voltaire asks, by way of underscoring the perceived hypocrisy of all Christian leaders, who really "believed in the incarnation of God, the death of God, the resurrection of God, the Trinity of God," etc.? He answers his own question: All of them "certainly believed nothing; and because they sensed the horrible absurdity of Christianity they imagined that there was no God at all."61 This covert "Transsubstantiation" (p. 493).

The ambitions of the Christian sectarians knew no bounds. It was their view "that the whole world should be Christian. They were therefore neces- sarily the enemies of the whole world, until it was converted."62 We will not review Voltaire's treatment of the way in which they ultimately succeeded in converting the European world to Christianity or his extensive account of their incessant theological struggles with each other. We should note, however, that it is these intra-Christian conflicts that Voltaire repeatedly identifies as the worst of Christianity's effects. "Since Constantine," he observes, there has been a "continual war among the Christians, sometimes limited to sophisms, to deceit, to cabals, and to hatred, and sometimes marked by carnage."63 It is, of course, the carnage that most disturbs him. He laments it ceaselessly. In chapter 42 of Dieu et les Hommes he attempts to quantify it. His conclusion: from the time of Constantine to the present, Christians have cut the throats of, or drowned, or burned, or broken upon the wheel, or hanged for the love of God 9,468,800 innocent people.64 From our discussion thus far it is clear that Voltaire regarded Judaism and Christianity as two related but entirely distinct religions. It is equally plain that he held a very low opinion of each of them. Judaism, in his eyes, was a false religion, rooted in ignorant, misguided concepts of the Deity and replete with immoral practices. It fostered a large measure of intolerance and inhumanity. As we have just seen, he also said all of the same things with regard to Christianity. Still, he did not believe that the two religions were completely equivalent to each other. Contrary to what Arthur Hertzberg has argued, he apparently considered Judaism to be the "lesser evil." On the purely theological level, Judaism is marked by its primitiveness, which is surely not a merit. Compared to Christianity, however, it is relatively unencumbered with nonsensical doctrines. Although he never put the matter in precisely these terms, Voltaire apparently regarded Judaism as constituting, in essence if not in all respects, the lesser evil of a state religion, whereas he clearly saw Christianity as the theological religion par excellence. Not on account of its Jewish heritage, but as a result of its departure from that heritage, 62. "Toleration," pp. 482-483. 63. Profession de Foi des Thdistes, p. 70. 64. Ibid., pp. 231 ff.</page><page sequence="17">VOLTAIRE ON JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY 239 its absorption of Western, i.e., Platonic philosophy, Christianity abounds with absurd doctrines, which render it more unreasonable than Judaism, which was itself the victim of a much less noxious dose of Platonism. It would, of course, have been rather awkward for Voltaire to make such an assessment explicitly, but everything he says points to a conclusion of this kind.65 Theology per se was not, as we have seen, Voltaire's greatest concern. What he cared about most deeply was the impact of a given religion on human society. Judging from this point of view, he found both Judaism and Christianity unsatisfactory. Both foster immorality, intolerance, and inhumanity. From what Voltaire has written, it is difficult to say which of the two religions was, in his opinion, the more immoral, but it is clear enough which of them he considered to be the more intolerant and inhumane: Christianity.66 It is, in fact, its preoccupation with theology that accounts, as far as Voltaire is concerned, for Christianity's greater perniciousness on the level of human relations. As a relatively nontheological religion, ill-disposed toward the bulk of mankind, Judaism, he believes, is capable of doing only limited harm. Christianity, on the other hand, with its elaborate dogmatic theology and its universalistic pretensions, has inevitably inspired its clerical leaders to stir up the worst kinds of trouble. As we have seen, Voltaire frequently observes that the ancient Jews displayed toleration of others, and just as frequently notes that the Christians have never showed anything of the kind. He does not, in fact, hesitate to emphasize the contrast. As an illustration of the difference between Jewish intolerance and Christian intolerance, he notes in the Philosophical Dictionary that the Jews in the Roman Empire "didn't cross land and sea to make proselytes, but thought only of making money. It is undeniable, however, that the Christians wanted their religion to be the dominant one. The Jews didn't want the statue of Jupiter in Jerusalem; but the Christians didn't want it in the Capitol." Even when riven by sectarianism, the Jewish world for some reason never descended to the depths of internecine theological warfare. Christendom, on 65. Gay (Party ofHumanity, p. 107) makes a somewhat similar argument: "Voltaire showed with grim humor that the Jews of antiquity, superstitious and barbarous as he paints them, were less superstitious and barbarous than the Christians." 66. Gay (ibid.) notes this too. It is, furthermore, not only the Jews who surpass the Christians in this respect, but the Moslems and the pagans as well. Cf. Homenlies Prononcees a Londres en 1765, pp. 336, 353.</page><page sequence="18">240 ALLAN ARKUSH the other hand, has been racked by such conflicts throughout its history. The Jews were admittedly "the most intolerant and cruel people of all antiquity." But it is the Christians, Voltaire says, who have proved to be "the most intolerant of all men." Unfortunately, they have imitated the Jews in their "irrational frenzies," but not in demonstrations of "leniency."''67 According to Hertzberg, as we noted at the outset, Voltaire believed that when the European peoples converted to Christianity they adopted an essentially Jewish religion, one foreign to their own tradition and spirit. As we have now seen, Voltaire actually believed that Christianity was, despite its Jewish roots, the heir to an earlier European tradition, one which deci- sively shaped its own distinctive spirit. Europe's conversion to Christianity essentially represented, in Voltaire's eyes, its adoption of a form of Platonism marked by a certain Jewish coloration. Still, if he in fact thought that its association with Judaism accounted to some extent for its success, if he regarded this aspect of the new religion as somehow having played a key role in seducing the European peoples away from the healthier strands of their own culture and leading them down the pernicious route of Platonism, then there might be some support for Hertzberg's argument after all. An examination of Voltaire's explanation for Christianity's conquest of the Roman Empire shows, however, that this is not the case. Voltaire does not, like Gibbon in his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, devote much attention to this epoch-making development. His most comprehensive treatment of it, which consists of one small chapter, appears in his Histoire de l'Etablissement du Christianisme. There he lists five reasons for the "progress" of Christianity. Two of them are connected to its Jewish origins. Like the Jews from whose midst they emerged, the early Christians, Voltaire notes, believed themselves to be "the elect of God," and were fortified by a sense of their own superiority.68 In addition, having had their origins among the Jews, they too practiced, like them, "commerce, brokerage, and usury," and consequently became wealthy.69 These factors, according to Voltaire, helped to solidify the organization of the early Christians. Their success in spreading the content of their message was due, however, not to any Jewish dimension it may have possessed but mainly to the fact that 67. "Toleration," pp. 482-483. 68. Histoire de I'Etablissemnent du Christianisme, pp. 80-81. 69. Ibid., p. 81.</page><page sequence="19">VOLTAIRE ON JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY 241 "they had dogmas and a coherent system, however absurd, and the other cults did not." Their Platonic metaphysics, together with the Christian mysteries, formed an incomprehensible body of doctrine with which they seduced and frightened weak spirits.70 Here, too, we find that the evidence does not bolster Hertzberg's interpretation. There are, as we noted at the beginning of this essay, a number of passages in Voltaire's writings which stress the kinship or resemblance between Judaism and Christianity and may therefore seem to lend support to Hertzberg's position. There is, for instance, a passage from Le Diner du Comte de Boulanvilliers in which one of the participants in a fictional dialogue, a certain Mr. Freret, taunts a Catholic priest with the argument that the members of his church are nothing but Jews and idolators. The priest is appalled. Fr6ret responds to his objections by asking: Wasn't your God born a Jew? Wasn't he circumcised as a Jew? Didn't he perform all of the Jewish ceremonies? ... Don't you still use a Jewish word, Pdques, as the name of your principal holiday? Haven't you been chanting for seventeen hundred years to a diabolical music Jewish songs which you attribute to a Jewish kinglet, an adulterous brigand and a homicide, a man after God's heart?7' In another such passage, in the Profession de Foi des Thdistes, Voltaire reviews yet again the odious manner in which the Jews conquered Canaan and purged it of its previous inhabitants. He then compares their behavior with that of medieval and later Christians: "Our Christians, one must confess, have imitated only too much" this kind of barbarism. It is this fanaticism, he writes, that inspires "the Crusades which depopulate Europe in order to immolate Arabs and Turks in Syria for the sake of Jesus Christ." And it is this kind of fanaticism, he says, that is responsible for crusades against our innocent brothers, who are called heretics, as well as for the infernal day of Saint Bartholomew.72 Passages of this kind, we must note, do not simply equate Judaism and Christianity. The first passage does not actually suggest that the fundamental teachings of the two religions are the same, but only that they are related and share some rituals. The second does not state, in a way that would contradict 70. Ibid., p. 83. 71. Ibid., Le Diner du Comte de Boulanvilliers, pp. 539-540. 72. Profession de Foi des Thdistes, p. 64.</page><page sequence="20">242 ALLAN ARKUSH what Voltaire wrote elsewhere, that the Christians inherited their particular brand of fanaticism from the Jews but only that they imitated what they read in the Old Testament. Still, these and other remarks are noticeably at variance with what we have seen to be Voltaire's more systematic and nuanced account of the relationship between Judaism and Christianity. How are they to be explained? Our analysis of Voltaire's writings has shown that, at bottom, he regarded Christianity as a religion essentially distinct from and, in certain crucial respects, inferior to Judaism. This is not, however, something he strove at every opportunity to explain to his reading public. He had no interest, for the most part, in casting Judaism in a more favorable--or even a less unfavorable-light. He had a strong interest, on the other hand, in undermining it, in part because he saw it as being essentially a bad thing in itself but mostly because it served as the foundation of Christianity. Even if it was, in the final analysis, better than its offspring, Judaism was a parent religion of which Christians were not and should not be proud, Voltaire evidently felt, and he devoted great efforts to exposing what he saw as its shameful aspects to the public. It did sometimes suit his purposes to underline ways in which the parent was superior to the child. But he was just as willing to turn his Christian readers against their own religion by identifying, and even exaggerating, ways in which it resembled the Judaism for which they themselves had nothing but disdain (and which he was teaching them to despise for new reasons). In the light of everthing else Voltaire wrote pertaining to Judaism and Christianity, this, it seems to me, is the best way to account for passages like the ones just quoted. There is no reason to call into question the general scholarly consensus that Voltaire, like other eighteenth-century deists, attacked Judaism in order to weaken the foundation on which Christianity rests. What must be rejected, however, is Arthur Hertzberg's understanding of the sense in which this is true. According to Hertzberg, Voltaire believed that Christianity was in essence a Jewish concoction, somewhat better than Judaism itself but still utterly inappropriate to the European peoples who had abandoned "their earlier, healthier tradition" in its favor. Voltaire supposedly blamed the Jews for corrupting these peoples and assailed them in order to contribute to the revival of the spirit of the nobler, Greco-Roman world they had helped to ruin.</page><page sequence="21">VOLTAIRE ON JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY 243 Our examination of Voltaire's writings has shown, on the contrary, that he distinguished sharply between Judaism and Christianity. Christianity was based, he well knew, on the Old Testament and continued to hallow it along with certain other trappings of Judaism, but he believed it to be, in its essential spirit, something new and different from its parent religion. This new spirit was due, above all, to Jesus' followers' early exposure to the influence of Platonic philosophy, which transformed their relatively harmless Jewish sect into a noxious, theological religion capable of conquering the Greco-Roman world. Voltaire must consequently have viewed his quest to destroy this religion less as a battle to liberate the West from alien and inferior influences stemming from the East than as a struggle against a baleful influence emanating from the West itself, to wit, the residue of ancient Greek metaphysics. Those occasional passages in his work which are somewhat at variance with the rest of his treatment of this subject and seem to stress the central importance of the kinship between Judaism and Christianity can be best understood as polemical exaggerations.
