Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1990. 300 pp. The few serious works up to now on the subject of the Jews of Buenos Aires have been increased by Victor A. Mirelman's recently published book. This work is the result of an extended search for material in Jewish and gen- eral archives, but actually it is a revision of the author's doctoral disserta- tion, submitted to Columbia University in 1972. Although he asserts that "additional research was conducted to fully develop some chapters and to add new dimensions to the work," there are only two chapters that have been altered. One of the main advantages of Mirelman's research is that he uses the most reliable sources for the period in concern, although these con- tradict each other in some cases. To give an example: according to one source, the Jewish population of Buenos Aires in 1934 is estimated to have reached 131,000 (p. 15), whereas according to another, two years later, it was no greater than 120,000 (p. 26). Inaccuracies of this kind are not limited to the sources on Buenos Aires but impede the work of scholars investigat- ing the history of virtually any place in Latin America. Unfortunately, Mirelman devotes no more than a few pages to his chapter on Jewish immigration to Argentina. But at least he analyzes con- vincingly some of the reasons that initially restricted the number of Jews arriving from imperial Russia: Argentina was not considered a land favora- ble for mass Jewish immigration, not only because it was so far away from Russia, but above all for fear that because of its strict Catholicism and, moreover, its deep bonds to Spain, it might react against the presence of an increasing number of Jews. These arguments and the reasons for anti- Jewish attitudes are analyzed by Mirelman in a further chapter. According to him-and I do not doubt that he is right-antisemitic activities were sporadic before 1930 but nonetheless affected the Argentine population, and they became more intense later through being incorporated into the ideo- logy of various nationalist political groups whose influence increased in the following years. Thus it was not by chance that around 1890, when Jewish immigration was just beginning, Jose Maria Mir6 (Julian Martel) published a novel named La Bolsa ("The Stock Exchange") in which appeared the stereotype of an avaricious, exploitative Jew out to control the economy of the country of his residence. Mir6 accused Jewish immigrants of responsibility for the current economic crisis in Argentina. The great number of editions of his</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 335 book indicate that readers were quite receptive to his negative picture of the Jews. Other developments further heightened Argentine resentment against the newcomers. For example, in 1910, a wave of strikes by Argentine workers and the assassination of the chief of police of Buenos Aires by a young Russian Jewish anarchist led to a violent reaction against Jewish labor organizations, including the demolition of their cultural center, the Biblioteca Rusa ("Russian Library"). The anti-Jewish feeling this reflected was reinforced by antisemitic propaganda sponsored by some Catholic groups. In several instances anti-Jewish defamations were included in school texts, among them the claim that the philanthropic Baron de Hirsch, who lived in Paris, was promoting and financing Jewish immigration to Argentina in order to found a New Palestine there. This defamation was still part of the ultranationalist ideology during the political repression of the 1970s, a fact we can gather from the accusations against the Jewish leftist journalist Jacobo Timmerman when he was arrested in 1976. Another wave of strikes in Buenos Aires, at the end of 1918, led to the famous "Semana trigica" in January 1919, in which a pogrom was organ- ized with the collusion of the police and the army. A great many Jews were attacked and injured, since they, as rusos ("Russians"), were held respon- sible for the disorder caused by the strikes. Well known is the case of Pedro Wald, who was seized and tortured into confessing the existence of a Bolshe- vik plan to seize power, with Wald to be nominated president of the new Argentine republic. Thus, in these first antisemitic manifestations, we find the essential com- ponents, nationalist as well as clerical, which later were elaborated by fascist and German National Socialist propagandists, thus causing even greater difficulties for the Jewish residents of Buenos Aires and other parts of the country. Unfortunately, Mirelman devotes a chapter of only a few pages to the essential subject of Jewish education. In detail, however, he analyzes the dark story of the participation of Jews, the so-called "Tmeyn" or "Kaf- tans," in the white-slave trade in Jewish girls, particularly from Romania and Russia, between 1918 and 1930. The activities of the white-slave dealers seriously injured the reputation of the Jewish community, but on the other hand, there was a sentiment of collective responsibility, so that the general Jewish community was able to prevent these elements, in spite of their finan- cial power, from integrating into the leading Jewish institutions. In conse-</page><page sequence="3">336 BOOK REVIEWS quence, they were compelled to found their own congregation in order to bury their members in a separate cemetery. Their obscure organization, Zvi Migdal, met its end in 1930, due to a denunciation to the police by one of its victims. But even this could not repair the damage inflicted upon the Jewish community as a whole. Later on, this would add fuel to the fire of the anti- semitic Argentine press, especially in its campaign to limit the immigration of Jewish refugees during the Nazi era. Undoubtedly, as Mirelman supports by documentary evidence, the years 1890 to 1930 were the decisive period for the formation of the great Jewish community in Argentina. This he shows in his chapter on the foundation and development of the Kehilla ("A Kehilla in the Making"), a period in which no less than 130 congregations were founded. In sum, Mirelman's book is an important contribution to research on the Jewish community of Buenos Aires. Yet it would be desirable for the author, in a new edition, to incorporate even more evidence and to bring up to date the bibliography (which by and large is that of the 1972 doctoral dis- sertation).
