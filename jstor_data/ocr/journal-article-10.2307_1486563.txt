<plain_text><page sequence="1">Israel Scheffler. Teachers of My Youth: An American Jewish Experience. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1995. v, 207 pp. In Israel Scheffler's class at Harvard University many years ago, we studied Richard Peters's idea of the "paradox of moral education,"' in which 1. Richard Peters, "Reason and Habit: The Paradox of Moral Education," anthologized with comments by Israel Scheffler in his Philosophy and Education: Modern Readings, 2nd ed. (Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1966), pp. 245-262.</page><page sequence="2">278 BOOK REVIEWS Peters conceives habit and tradition as a grounding for the emergence of rational thought and autonomous values. While habit and tradition, reflectively instilled, become the necessary "stuff' out of which rationality and autonomy are generated, the paradox stems from their mindless inculcation, which transforms them into the vehicle for stunting rationality and autonomy altogether. In this educational autobiography of his youth in a New York Jewish immigrant family, Israel Scheffler, Victor Thomas Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at Harvard, dean of philosophers of education, and leading philosopher of science, implicitly provides us with a case study of Peters's paradox. Scheffler accepts his colleague Frederick Olafson's portrayal of education as a "transferred obligation" in which gratitude to parents and teachers is requited by conveying their teachings to children and students. Here, however, Scheffler requites his own teachers' (and parents') efforts more directly by lovingly and skillfully telling of his experiences as their student. The ramifications for Scheffler's growth as a philosopher are fascinating, prompting speculation about the real potentials of a good Jewish education, beyond ethnic identity and religious commitment. Scheffler's rich recall of images and moments is remarkable as he describes the memorable teachers of his youth. Reading the book helped me understand the extent to which he himself, as teacher and scholar, has fulfilled the "transferred obligation," but, in searching for the deeper meaning of his early experiences, he gives us more, a work of philosophy of education and Jewish education in its own right. The narrative moves from Scheffler's childhood experiences through his undergraduate years, including study at Brooklyn College, Yeshiva University, and the Jewish Theological Seminary's Teachers Institute. He ends the story before his entry into graduate study of rabbinics at JTS and doctoral work at the University of Pennsylvania, for otherwise it would have been difficult to "separate [his] impressions of teachers from [his] contemporary responses to ... philosophical problems" (p. 17). The devoted support of his Orthodox Jewish family, who insisted on a very intensive Jewish education for their son with its attendant sacrifices, was critical. The effort required seems incredible by today's standards; reading about Scheffler's long and daily subway trips to faraway classes serves as an antidote to the usual autobiographical and fictional accounts of alienated Jewish intellectuals and their intergenerational conflicts. The young scholar's</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 279 acceptance (and enjoyment!) of his regimen is stirring; there was no end to Scheffler's thirst for learning, as he piled course upon course beyond full-time undergraduate programs. An amusing anecdote describes the dean of the New School asking him and his friend Harold Weisberg if they were unhappily married. Were they taking so many courses in order to get away from their wives? Scheffler, who, like Weisberg, was single, comments that the dean was not aware of their daily six or seven hours of talmudic study! It is noteworthy that Scheffier's Orthodox father encouraged his son to study at the Jewish Theological Seminary so that he could get a contemporary perspective on classic Jewish sources and modem Hebrew language. It was Mordecai M. Kaplan whom Scheffier credits with first introducing him to a philosophical issue, challenging his naive Orthodoxy with a developmental view of religion that legitimated his treasuring the Jewish past while affirming its incompatibility with his own deepening philosophical thought. Scheffier's retrospective look at his education challenges our modem sensibilities regarding "good teaching" with anecdotes of experiences that were not necessarily unfavorable for him, as we might have expected. His family and the sincere efforts of learned teachers were strong enough to counterbalance the negatives, often, amazingly, with outcomes preferable to those we might expect in "modem" Jewish schools! Even when Scheffier was aware of his teachers' and schools' limitations (not to impugn some fine examples of enlightened teaching), he was patient and tolerant, able, for the most part, to receive what they had to offer. One illustration: Scheffier's reflections on the issue of synthesis pervade the book and counter our common assumptions about relevance. Here we have the young Scheffier avidly consuming knowledge of Western culture and, at the same time, absorbed in traditional Jewish venues, often contrary in content and method. His yeshiva experience, from the youthful version at Rabbi Jacob Joseph (RJJ) to Yeshiva University's Teachers Institute, was a story of "two worlds" with little reciprocity and synthesis; yet Scheffler's response is positive. He notes that if the schools did not know how to solve the split, at least they communicated something more fundamental, the message that both were indispensable. At Yeshiva University some cynicism uncharacteristically creeps into Scheffler's voice. Yeshiva's president, Bemard Revel, reveled in a "Philoso- phy of Synthesis" (most likely an expression of Yeshiva's Torah 'im Derekh Eretz orientation, as per Samson Raphael Hirsch). Scheffier, philosopher-in- the-wings, sees through the catchword: "RJJ had no educational philosophy</page><page sequence="4">280 BOOK REVIEWS and pretended to none; the Yeshiva had none either and called it 'synthesis' " (p. 121). Yet this lack did not affect his penchant for the two subject areas, and, with many of his classmates, he felt the "strong pull of both worlds ... a matter of living with the problem over an extended period" (ibid.). When he presents guidelines for today's Jewish education, Scheffler takes a similar tack. His later views are congruent with his early insights and evince the same tolerance for conflict. While Scheffler rejects the "compart- mentalizing of the mind and spirit," he also avoids the artificiality that often passes for synthesis today, suggesting that "synthesis as a fact can hardly be unitary. ... we will find many ways rather than one, longer as well as shorter routes, detours and mazes as well as paths that lie straight and smooth" (ibid.), a refreshing view at a time when "synthesis" has become a byword in educational discourse. In Scheffler's memoir, Jewish tradition and Jewish education are a matrix for the emergence of his philosophical character. If, indeed, the early stage, following Peters, must be conducive for the later to exist at all, then, in Scheffler's case, somebody must have been doing something right! Scheffler's tale of how a young Jewish student became a great philosopher challenges us to ask whether his path can, in essence, be adapted to Jewish education today. Is it time-bound, or can it help us create a way that embraces commitment to tradition, its texts, and its observances with the freedom to interpret them unapologetically? Scheffler's life and education have modeled this process, and now we are now privileged to have his moving and stimulating story too.
