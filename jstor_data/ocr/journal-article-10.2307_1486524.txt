<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS David Marcus. From Balaam to Jonah: Anti-Prophetic Satire in the Hebrew Bible. Brown Judaic Studies 301. Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1995. xii, 214 pp. The purpose of Marcus's study is to examine four narratives in the Hebrew Bible which appear to be critical of prophets: Balaam and his donkey (Num 22:21-35), the boys and the bald prophet Elisha (2 Kings 2:23-25), the lying prophet at Beth El (1 Kings 13), and Jonah. In each case, Marcus argues that the primary goal of the narrative is to employ satire in order to portray the prophet negatively. He therefore contends that the four narratives are examples of anti-prophetic satire. They represent a point of view current in the sixth century B.C.E. that contrasts earlier miracle-working prophets or seers with non-miracle-working prophets like Jeremiah or Ezekiel. They function as warnings against past (or present) types of authority figures who are charged with lying, foolishness, pettiness, and other behavior unbecoming to a prophet. Overall, Marcus's study arises from the relatively recent concern over the past two decades or so with interpreting the Bible as literature. Until the emergence of such interest, satire had not been widely recognized in the Bible. The primary reason for this failure was the general attitude of reverence toward sacred scripture, especially on the part of Christian exegetes, which in turn led to the misconception that the Bible is entirely lacking in humor and therefore devoid of satire. In order to lay the groundwork for the identification of the above-named narratives as anti-prophetic satire, Marcus identifies the characteristics of satire. He states that "a text may be identified as a satire if it has a target which is the object of attack, either directly or indirectly, and has a preponderance of the essential attributes of satire" (p. 9), including "a mixture of unbelievable elements," "ironies, ridicule, parody, and rhetorical features." These elements must not simply be present in the text, they must dominate it and constitute the essence of the work. Marcus then turns to an analysis of each of the four narratives in an effort to characterize them as satire. Various elements in the Balaam narrative are designed to make this Aramean seer appear to be ridiculous. He fails to see the angel of God standing in the road, but his donkey sees it and eventually 121</page><page sequence="2">122 BOOK REVIEWS has to speak to the great seer in order to inform him of its presence. This is after the seer beats the donkey that has just saved his life after repeatedly attempting to warn him of the danger. The narrative contrasts Balaam's behavior with that of Samuel (1 Samuel 3) and Abraham (Genesis 22) under similar circumstances, and therefore represents an example of anti-prophetic satire. The narrative concerning the prophet who calls upon bears to maul forty-two boys who mocked him for his baldness is a satire against the prophet Elisha. Among the many indications of the prophet's power, this narrative is particularly grotesque and ironic because the reason for the mauling is so petty and because the prophet presumably had the power to silence the boys by less lethal means. Why should the name of God be used by the prophet for such a purpose? The narrative concerning the lying prophet from Beth El relates how an unnamed man of God condemns the altar at Beth El by announcing to the Israelite king Jeroboam ben Nebat that King Josiah of Judah will one day destroy the illegitimate worship site. Although the man of God has been clearly instructed by God not to eat or drink in Beth El, an old prophet informs him that a new revelation indicates that it is okay to do so. While the two are eating and drinking, the old prophet receives a genuine revelation, and informs the man of God that he will die for his disobedience. After the man of God is mauled by a lion, he is buried at Beth El in the grave of the old prophet. Marcus's analysis emphasizes the gullibility of the man of God and the outright lie of the old prophet from Beth El. Finally, his analysis of the book of Jonah argues that Jonah is made to appear ridiculous. Jonah flees upon being commanded by God to condemn Nineveh; he sleeps in the ship while the pagan sailors invoke God; Jonah's own prayer to God appears to be motivated by those of the pagan sailors; Jonah hopes for the destruction of Nineveh after finally delivering his oracle and grieves for the demise of the qiqayon plant. As in the previous cases, the Jonah narrative targets Jonah and must be considered as an example of anti-prophetic satire. Without question, Marcus's study demonstrates that each of these narra- tives constitutes an example of satire, but his contention that all four represent examples of anti-prophetic satire appears to be overly reductionist. Are the prophets indeed the primary targets or concerns in each narrative, or must other factors be considered? In the case of Balaam, the Aramean seer is clearly satirized. Nevertheless,</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 123 the full literary context indicates that the primary goal of the narrative is to demonstrate YHWH's power to make this renowned pagan prophet speak whatever YHWH commands him to speak and to bring the people of Israel into the Promised Land despite the presence of powerful settled nations. In the case of Elisha, the literary context emphasizes the dangerous character of a man who challenges the powerful Omride dynasty and, with the backing of God, brings about coups d'etat in both Israel and Aram. He is petty, but the narrative indicates that he is not to be trifled with. The setting of Beth El must be taken into account in interpreting the narrative concerning the lying prophet. Beth El had a reputation for deception, dishonesty, and pain in Judean eyes. It is the site of weeping where foreign gods and Rebekah's nurse Deborah were buried (Gen 35:15); where Israel sinned and Joshua died (Judges 2; contra Joshua 24); where Israel determined to destroy Benjamin (Judg 20:18-35); and where the northern tribes of Israel abandoned YHWH and the Jerusalem Temple (1 Kings 12-13; 2 Kings 17; N.B., Elisha was on his way to Beth El when the boys taunted him). Jonah is hardly an exemplary prophet, but he is forced to wrestle with the fact that YHWH has decided to spare Nineveh, even though as a prophet from the time of Jeroboam ben Joash (2 Kings 14:25) he presumably knows that Assyria will one day destroy his own country, Israel. It would seem that the book of Jonah parodies the prophet in an effort to raise the question of YHWH's righteousness (and mercy) in this matter. In sum, Marcus's study certainly points to the satirical nature of these narratives, but they appear to be concerned with issues beyond the mere condemnation of their central prophetic characters.
