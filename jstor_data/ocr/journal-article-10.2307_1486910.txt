Edinburgh: T &amp; T Clark, 1996. xvi, 522 pp. The last decade has seen the appearance of a considerable body of impor- tant work on individual diaspora communities in the ancient world. Barclay boldly undertakes a survey of the five best-attested Jewish communities</page><page sequence="2">248 BOOK REVIEWS of the Mediterranean diaspora in the hellenistic and early Roman periods: Egypt, Cyrenaica, Syria, Asia Minor, and Rome. The discussion of these five communities in a common framework offers a striking reminder of how unevenly the evidence is distributed. About half the book is devoted to the Jews of Egypt, because virtually all of the surviving literature of the Greco-Roman diaspora comes from Egypt. In the absence of a literary legacy, the other communities get no more than a chapter apiece; for these communities, we are painfully dependent on Josephus, with some help from inscriptions and accounts by non-Jews, including early Christians. Barclay's careful adherence to the chronological boundaries of his title is also salutary. It is perhaps disappointing that this requires him to exclude important but somewhat later archaeological evidence from Asia Minor, including the imposing synagogue at Sardis and the Aphrodisias inscription with its decisive evidence for the god-fearers, but it is important to be reminded of what we actually know about Asia Minor in the period this book covers. Barclay himself succumbs to temptation in his treatment of the community at Rome by drawing on the large corpus of inscriptions from the catacombs, most later than the time of Trajan. For each diaspora community Barclay provides a judicious account of its history and a discussion of the Jews' relations with their neighbors and their place in the larger culture of their time. He attempts to locate members of the communities and their texts on three scales: assimilation, acculturation, and accommodation. Assimilation refers to "social integration," while accultura- tion reflects the adoption of "linguistic, educational and ideological" aspects of culture (p. 92). By distinguishing between the two phenomena, Barclay rightly insists that intimate familiarity with Greek culture does not necessarily mean the dropping of social barriers between Jews and gentiles. The third scale, accommodation, measures "the use to which acculturation is put, in particular the degree to which Jewish and Hellenistic cultural traditions are merged, or alternatively, polarized" (p. 96). In other words, a work may be written in good Greek and be conversant with Greek literary conventions and Greek philosophy, and may still take an antagonistic stance toward Greek culture. One problem with the axes is the limitations of the evidence available to us. Many of the people who can be placed on the assimilation axis are drawn from inscriptions or brief mentions in historical works, and too little is known about them to allow them to be placed on the other two axes. Literary works, on the other hand, provide material for the acculturation and</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 249 accommodation axes, but usually the author can be placed on the assimilation axis only by extrapolating from his ideas, a method that would undermine the independence of the axes. The treatment of Paul is particularly compelling because we know enough about his life for Barclay to make effective use of all three axes. As Barclay points out, Paul has traditionally been seen as the source of the Greek elements in the Christian synthesis of Judaism and Hellenism. But Barclay questions this view, presenting Paul as an "anomalous" figure. He is little acculturated and very antagonistic toward gentile culture. But he is also highly assimilationist. While Barclay does not say so, the explanation for this unusual configuration of characteristics is surely Paul's intense expectation of the imminent end. Barclay's insistence that acculturation is not synonymous with accom- modation is important. Yet his understanding of acculturation, which places "scholarly expertise" at the very top of the acculturation scale and implic- itly treats philosophy as the most important mode of acculturation, is not unproblematic. By these standards even most natives would not score very high on the acculturation scale. The emphasis on philosophical knowledge as the key element in high acculturation also exercises a problematic influence on the supposedly independent accommodation axis. Three of Barclay's five examples of works from Egypt that tend toward accommodation are philosophical in outlook: the Letter of Aristeas, Aristobulus, and Philo; as Barclay notes, philosophy provides a mode for working out a theory of accommodation. Barclay does offer an interesting reading of another philo- sophically informed work, the Wisdom of Solomon, as deeply antagonistic to gentiles. But the association of philosophy with both acculturation and accommodation has problematic results. Thus the Sibylline Oracles show "some degree of acculturation. . . . Yet this Hellenization in theme and form should not be confused with the careful accommodation achieved by such figures as Aristobulus and Aristeas" (p. 224; emphasis added). It is remarkable that the Sibylline Oracles, which use the Sibyl, a female pagan oracle, as their speaker and are written in hexameter verse with Homeric epithets applied to God, count only as somewhat hellenized. Of course, they show no trace of the influence of philosophy. Notice also the slide in Barclay's comment from acculturation to accommodation! The difficulty Barclay has in maintaining the separation between accul- turation and accommodation suggests an underlying problem in his view that the acquisition of Greek culture and the use to which it is put are two</page><page sequence="4">250 BOOK REVIEWS separate moments that can be represented on two different axes. Barclay seems to have been little influenced by the work of Elias Bickerman, but Bickerman's understanding of hellenization as a process of adaptation and transformation, which unites the two moments, seems to me a better way to get at the dynamics of hellenization. Finally, while it is probably unfair to fault a project that is already so broadly comparative for omitting another comparative dimension, one thing missing from much of this book is a recognition of the pluralistic character of the societies in which most diaspora Jews found themselves. Barclay gives little attention to other ethnic minorities in the Greco-Roman world; indeed he often uses the terms "Greeks" and "gentiles" interchangeably. His account of the history of the Jews in Egypt makes amply clear the complex relations among native Egyptians, some highly hellenized, Greeks, Jews, and eventually their Roman rulers. But his discussion of the Jews in Syria treats gentiles as Greeks in an area where recent scholarship has emphasized the long-term survival of native Semitic culture. The discussion of the Jews in Rome would surely have benefited from attention both to attitudes toward the other ethnic groups that established themselves there and to the organization and development of these groups, and so too for Asia Minor. A full treatment of these issues would require a second volume, but a brief sketch or even a statement of the issues would provide some perspective on Jewish similarity and difference in a book that will be an important resource for anyone interested in the Jews in the Greco-Roman diaspora for a long time to come.
