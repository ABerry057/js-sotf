Cooperman The Cinquecento was marked by the emergence of expanded and more formalized structures of self-government in Italy's Jewish communities. It is from this century that we begin to have written capitoli (constitutional agreements) and pinkasim (record books).2 By the middle of the century, as Robert Bonfil has demonstrated, the office of community-appointed rabbi had been created and regu- larized.3 Intense internecine struggles broke out for control over the new institutions, and contemporary rabbinic responsa attest to the slow and sometimes tortuous manner in which early modem Jews felt their way toward new working arrange- ments, procedures, and understandings.4 1. This is a much expanded version of a paper first presented at the seventh Italia Judaica con- ference in Reggio Emilia and originally scheduled to appear in its proceedings. I would like to thank several scholars who generously commented on the paper, especially Robert Bonfil, Kenneth Stow, Jonathan Elukin, Donald Sutherland, and the anonymous reader for the AJS Review. The dedication acknowledges that much of what is here I first encountered under Professor Yerushalmi's generous gui- dance. Errors and shortcomings, of course, remain my own. 2.

We shall see this in discussions of Rome, but see also the comments of Shlomo Simonsohn at the start of his "Pinkasei ha-kehilah be-verona," Kirjath sepher 35 (1960): 127-36, 250-68, esp. 127 (though he moved from this position in his book on Mantuan Jewry, cited in note 8). 3.

Cooperman Can the new forms of social organization be linked to shifts in what has recently been termed a self-conscious "Jewish political tradition"? The causes of institutional evolution undoubtedly lay primarily in objective and external factors-changes in the demographic, geographic, economic, and above all, legal conditions of Jewish life on the peninsula.5 Still, it seems increasingly clear that the change was also accompanied by-and to some extent, directed by-new political and legal ways of thinking among the Jews. Jewish leaders borrowed organizational models from their environment, basing Jewish arrange- ments, for example, on the governmental structures of Florence and Venice. At the same time, they sought to legitimize these "alien" models in terms drawn from Jewish tradition, to align political procedures with halakhic and customary norms, and to shape the new communal structures in accordance with specifically Jewish needs and circumstances. Although this process has generally been investigated at the theoretical and abstract level of political philosophy,6 in recent years, scholars interested in the study of Jewish law as a coherent body of jurisprudence and practice (mishpat 'ivri) have begun to examine the concrete circumstances of kehilah formation, the specifics of communal power sharing, and the legal theory that developed.7 For historians of Jews in early 5. Thus, Cassuto, for example, linked the first formal regulations for the Florentine community (1571) directly to the concentration of Tuscan Jewry in the Florence ghetto in that year and the conse- quent need to regulate a much larger community than heretofore; "I piui antichi capitoli," 204.

Ethnic division and rivalry has been much emphasized in histori- cal treatments of Italian Jews during the early modem period: Venice in particular, but many other cities from Padua to Ancona, from Verona to Livorno, were all known to have had Jewish kehilot organized along ethnic lines. This is also true for cinquecento Rome, where the communal constitution of 1524 was careful to guarantee representation for both Italiani and non-Italiani Jews. What that reveals about the Roman Jewish community has long been debated among histor- ians, and it is to that document that we now turn our attention. THE ROMAN CONSTITUTION OF 1524 When he first published these capitoli almost three-quarters of a century ago, the historian Attilio Milano took it for granted that Roman Jewry had been orga- nized into a kehilah-an autonomous, fully self-governing community-since imperial times. In this belief, he was following the views of earlier writers. As Emmanuel Rodocanachi put it in 1891, Rome's Jews had effectively represented "a tiny but distinct State within a State" with its own "tribunal, the Beth-Dim [sic], where judges appointed by them resolved their differences according to Mosaic law. And such was the respect that the emperors held for this tribunal that they gave its decisions the force of law."9 Thus, the capitoli of 1524, Milano assumed, did not represent a totally new institution. The fact that there was little or no earlier documentation to prove the existence of an organized commu- nity with recognized jurisdiction and authority was paradoxically used as proof that it had indeed existed and flourished: It may be that, so long as the Jewish community of Rome was composed only of Roman Jews, no written statute fixed its administrative norms in full detail. The governing agencies of the community were harmonized by ancestral (Jerualem: Magnes, 1978): 558-630. See also his entry on "Public Authority," in Encyclopedia Judaica (Jerusalem: Keter, 1972). 8. See especially the many articles and books of Robert (Re'uven) Bonfil and his convenient recent summary article on communal organization cited in note 2. Already four decades ago, Shlomo Simonsohn offered the beginnings of a more nuanced understanding of changing communal organization and of its causes, suggesting that in shaping their institutions, Mantuan Jews may have been following models taken from Christian institutions; see Simonsohn, Toldot ha-yehudim be- dukasut mantovah (Jerusalem: Tel-Aviv University/Ben-Zvi Institute, 1963), 1:232-34; and idem, History of the Jews in Mantua (Jerusalem: Kiryath Sepher, 1977), 318-20.

Cooperman practice [convivenza] and long habit, and the people were on the whole well off. It would not therefore have been difficult ... to provide for the needs of the community. All of this changed, Milano argued, after 1492, when contentious Sephardic (and later other) immigrants disturbed matters. The constitution of 1524 was required to end three decades of bitter rivalry between ethnic groups, a rivalry that had eroded the former state of undocumented harmony.10 Milano derived his picture of bitter ethnic tension in Rome primarily from a story told by the early-sixteenth-century Sephardic chronicler Solomon Ibn Verga. The latter had included in Shevet Yehudah, his account of past and contemporary Jewish sufferings, a report that Roman Jews had tried to keep the Spanish refugees of 1492 from entering their city: Some of the [Sephardic] Jews who had come to the area around Genoa left because of a severe famine and went to Rome. The Jews who were in Rome assembled in order to discuss what to do lest strangers enter into their midst and harm their livelihood. Immediately they collected a thousand florins and offered this as a gift to Pope [Alexander VI] that he not admit them into his land. But when the issue was laid before the pope, [the latter] responded: "This is new to me, for I heard that Jews usually act with mercy towards each other, whereas these have behaved cruelly. I therefore order that these too be expelled and no longer live in my land." Then the Jews in Rome were forced to gather together a further gift of two thousand gold pieces for the pope in order that he leave them alone and that the foreigners be allowed into the city. The poor exiles enjoyed the bounty of the land!" 10.

(The quote is from p. 327.) The capitoli were first brought to the attention of scholars by David Castelli, "Notizie di un documento sulla storia degli ebrei a Roma," Archivio Storico Italiano 5, no. 11 (1893): 398-407 (a papal ratifica- tion). A German translation of the introduction to the capitoli and their papal confirmation is available in Abraham Berliner, Geschicte der Juden in Rom (Frankfurt am Main: J. Kauffmann, 1893), 2:87-93. This translation was based on a manuscript Berliner found in the Roman Jewish community archive, itself a copy of documents in the Archivio di Stato. Shlomo Simonsohn published the papal confir- mation in The Apostolic See and the Jews: Documents (Toronto: Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 1988-91), ? 1327, 1672. A then-uncatalogued manuscript copy of the constitution was shown to me at the library of Harvard University more than two decades ago, but a recent search failed to locate that text. The somewhat confusing summary of the capitoli provided by G. Blustein refers to a manuscript 112 in the archive of the Roman Jewish community but gives no further details; Storia degli Ebrei in Roma (Rome: 1921), 118-21. The capitoli are also discussed in standard histories of Roman Jews, such as Hermann Vogelstein and Paul Rieger, Geschichte der Juden in Rom (1420-1870) (Berlin: Mayer &amp; Miller, 1895-96), 2:127 ff. 11.

Some, such as Rodocanachi, felt called upon to apologize and to assure readers that such behavior was atypical: "Roman Jews were generally considered good and hospitable, very inclined to help one another and to assist their coreligio- nists."12 Abraham Berliner tried to justify the Romans' stance: Experience had taught them that accepting immigrants led to a higher tax burden for the commu- nity. The Iberian refugees were, moreover, a particular problem because their pre- sence might (and, Berliner thought, actually did) lead to Spanish pressure on the papacy, pressure that could endanger the entire community's always-tenuous right to live in Rome.'3 But apologies and justifications aside, most writers condemned the Romans' behavior at a time of grave national crisis. Roman Jews' selfishness was "unheard of' (Paul Rieger),14 "without doubt unseemly from a moral point of view" (Attilio Milano),15 and inspired by "envy or ill will" (Ariel Toaff).16 Roman Jewry's ethnic problem, it was further assumed, did not go away soon. Granted their inauspicious first encounter, Sephardim and Italiani must have remained hostile toward each other and therefore continued to have difficulty living under a single communal umbrella. Thus, Rieger declared that Italiani fears of the Sephardim ultimately proved justified: From that time on, the Spanish [Jews], with their culture [Intelligenz] far above that of their Italian co-religionists, became the pace setters in Rome. The original community continuously declined in importance, while that established by the Spaniards continued to rise. The Spaniards held themselves completely separate from their brothers in faith. The split [between the groups] was widened by their liturgical differences and by the unbowed pride [Stolz] of the exiles.'7 Milano sought to spread the blame more evenly, arguing that Roman Jews' own xenophobia had been just as divisive as Spanish self-importance. "Over time, differences of language, dress, tradition, and especially religious ritual, made life together full of irritations for Jews from so many different countries."18 Whomever they blamed, however, these historians all agreed that Roman Jewry was ethnically polarized. This view of ethnic divisiveness within the Jewish community has been especially prominent in the work of two recent scholars. Ariel Toaff, though he at first takes Ibn Verga's story as "probably based on reliable sources," later 12. Rodocanachi, Saint-Sidge et lesjuifs, 68. 13.

Cooperman seems to question the account, conceding that the Spanish chronicler "had inten- tionally overstated" his case and told an improbable (inverosimile) story with no substantiating documentation. Even so, Toaff sees the tale as essentially true, an "edifying fable" composed for Sephardic use and "clearly demonstrating that the author felt very little affection towards Roman Jews." Ibn Verga's attitude was undoubtedly justified, moreover, by the Roman Jews' own initial hostility and jealousy with regard to the Sephardim.19 Based on documents he found in the Roman community's own archive, Toaff concludes that "there can be no doubt that relations between Italiani Jews and those coming from the Iberian peninsula in successive waves beginning in 1492 ... were marked by manifest, mutual hostility and strong rivalry." "Radical transformation" resulting from large-scale immigration led to ongoing "ethnic conflicts" over political power within the community.20 Anna Esposito has followed Toaff's lead in this respect. In her own path-breaking exploration of Roman notarial archives as a source for Roman Jewish history, she has found a treasure trove of data that she interprets according to categories of ethnic hostility: The arrival of refugees from various regions ... created serious tensions, especially since it undercut the traditional powers of the older nucleus of Roman Jews. From the early years of the sixteenth century, the Jewish community of Rome was marked by quite violent disturbances and by controversies that had to be brought before the papal authorities.21 This portrait of ethnic division and hostility among early-sixteenth-century Roman Jewry has not gone unchallenged. In detailed studies and a full mono- graphic study, Kenneth Stow describes Rome as a community built on solid foundations and essential homogeneity, "qualities that enabled it to absorb hun- dreds of immigrants toward the end of the fifteenth century from all corners of the European Jewish world." In particular, Stow points out the high rates of inter- marriage between members of almost all the 'edot and the ease with which Roman Jews could shift membership between synagogues of various rites. For Stow, these are clear indications that the radical ethnic divisions posited by Milano and Toaff 19.

Roman Jewry was a "melting pot" in which ethnic affiliation was decided by personal choice, not fixed by birth. As for the Ibn Verga story, Stow sees it as a "conscious exaggeration," a style of rhetoric that is typical of the era.22 Equally important is the position of Robert Bonfil, who, in his survey treat- ment Jewish Life in Renaissance Italy, emphatically rejected the notion that Italian Jews displayed any particular animosity toward the Sephardic newcomers. In his view, a specific "Spanish refugee problem never even arose among Italian Jewish communities." He dismisses as "outdated" and "astronomical" the high estimates of Iberian Jewish immigration to Italy, insisting that "Italy did not turn out to be very attractive"23 and calling for a more "neutral" analysis and a less ideologically conditioned interpretation of the reception given the Sephardic refugees. We shall return to the implications of the Ibn Verga account later, but at this point, it is useful to pause and consider an aspect of the tale's historiography to which insufficient attention has been paid. A careful reading of the earlier histor- ians of Roman Jewry indicates that they knew the story not from Ibn Verga's orig- inal Hebrew or even from the Latin translation by George Gentius,24 but through the work of the eighteenth-century French Huguenot cleric Jacques Basnage. It was Basnage who took on the task of writing "the first comprehensive and truly erudite history of the Jews in the Christian era"--of treating the Jews, in other words, as a worthy subject of inquiry even after the coming of Christ.25 His five-volume study L'Histoire et la religion des Juifs depuis Jdsus-Christ jusqu''d present was well received when it first appeared (1706-7). Within a year, it had been translated into English, and by 1710, it had been paid the dubious compliment of a pirated edition in Paris at the hands of L. E. Du Pin. 22.

Cooperman The following year, outraged by the theft of his work and even more by the nega- tive comments this stolen edition had received, Basnage issued a sixth volume, a History of the Jews, reclaimed and recovered by its true author, Monsieur Basnage, against the anonymous and truncated edition of it produced in Paris ... in 1710.26 A few years later, he went on to expand the original book even further: A fifteen-volume edition appeared in The Hague between 1716 and 1726. Mentioned favorably by contemporary scholars such as Richard Simon and later Voltaire, Basnage's Histoire provided the foundation for many modem accounts of Jewish history, and it is no surprise, therefore, that his version of Ibn Verga's tale shaped the later historiography of Roman Jewry. Let us look carefully, then, at how Basnage reported the tale he had learned from Gentius's literal translation of Ibn Verga. Here is the text from the first English translation of L'Histoire: Alexander VI instead of ill-using'em [the Spanish refugees], received 'em with abundant Charity. Being expelled from Spain by Ferdinand the Catho- lick, and Fugitives in all Places, they knew not where to rest the Sole of their Feet. Those that came to Rome were ill-receiv'd by their cruel and bar- barous Brethren, who would have suffer'd 'em to die with Hunger, if Alexan- der VI, had not succour'd 'em. In effect, this Pope, tho' a Spaniard by Birth, and Head of the Church, understanding that the Jews, who had long been settled at Rome, left the Exiles in Misery, without attempting to succour them, he threatened to expel 'em, unless they chang'd their Conduct, and gave their miserable Brethren opportunities of settling in the Ecclesiastical State. He thought it con- venient to profit by Ferdinand's Error, and to enlarge his Revenues at the Cost of others. There have been a great many People, who would not persecute the Jews, nor yet would suffer their numbers to multiply in their States, by the Conjunction of Strangers. But the Pope listned [!] not to the Reasons dictated by his Religion, but would have the new Comers have the same Privileges at Rome, that the old inhabitants of the same Religion had. ... Others being inform'd of the Pope's kind Inclinations, flock'd from all Parts into Italy. 27 26.

The Borgia pope's reputation for self-indulgence and corruption is passed over in silence. Though a Spaniard, the pope had gone against Spanish policy; though head of the church, he had rejected its teachings! In this, Alexander had been motivated, Basnage tells us, by solid practical utilitarianism as well as humanitarian ideals. Even a quick comparison with Ibn Verga's text shows how much Basnage embellished the story and recast it to gain a desired effect. Why did the Protestant Basnage wish to emphasize the pope's generosity? His motives had nothing to do with the actual interactions of Roman and Sephar- dic Jews during the sixteenth century. Basnage was retelling (and reshaping) the story to make a bold statement on behalf of tolerance toward religious refugees in his own time. We can see how important this was to him by reading his later attack on the pirated Paris edition of his book. Basnage focused especially on Du Pin's perversion of the account of the Spanish expulsion and the events at Rome. The Paris text had reversed Basnage's own interpretation, endorsing rather than condemning Ferdinand's cruel policy and even applauding its implementation. Pope Alexander, moreover, was now portrayed as actually approving of the original expulsion from Spain. Basnage protested, I cannot hide the fact that I disapprove strongly of Ferdinand's conduct, nor can I remain silent about the reasons I have for condemning so evil a policy by which this Prince did not take the proper steps to avoid the uprooting of such a large number of exiles or reducing them to despair. He thus laid des- olate a large and vast kingdom. Ultimately, it was Pope Alexander VI who secretly laughed to see Spain weaken itself through this total expulsion and who made his view of this policy even clearer by receiving in Italy and Rome those who were driven out of Spain on account of their religion with noteworthy marks of protection. The conclusions to be drawn from a compari- son of these opposed policies of the pope and the king are so obvious (natur- elles) that it is impossible contemporaries did not draw them then as we today believe they would. Though the pious may approve the expulsion of such a large number of subjects on religious grounds, statesmen (politiques) who can balance the needs of the kingdom against those of religion will necessarily condemn the king, as will anyone who loves tolerance and charity. There is nothing to discuss; this is an unchanging reality. This is not one of the things that will harm the Catholic Church. de grosser ses Revenus de la Perte des autres.

Cooperman Even where Du Pin retained a part of the original account, he had only made the book appear to contradict itself about the pope's position. Admittedly, Alexander's policies were not completely consistent. The pope had, for example, rewarded the Spanish monarchs with the honorific title "Catholic." But Basnage insisted that Alexander had nevertheless secretly objected to Ferdinand's expulsion order. He noted especially that the Parisian text had omitted the most important observation that Alexander's tolerance was a rejection of the teachings of his own faith.28 We see that to maximize his condemnation of religious intolerance and to demonstrate that even the pope had understood the positive benefits of religious toleration, Basnage felt free to reshape Ibn Verga's narrative of events at Rome. First, he increased the number of refugees involved. The story was no longer about just a few Sephardim from Genoa but about Sephardic refugees in general. Roman Jews feared a potentially huge influx and, according to Basnage, Sephardim soon "flocked from all parts to Italy." Equally important for the present study, to highlight the pope's tolerance, Basnage portrayed Rome's Jewish community as institutionally far more powerful than in fact it was. He imagined a sort of Jewish city-state with the independent right to control immigration. When the Jews refused to admit the unfortunates, the pope forced them to give "their miserable Brethren opportunities of settling in the Eccle- siastical State." In fact, as Ibn Verga more correctly understood, it was the pope who had the power to accept or reject the refugees in the first place; Roman Jews could only try to influence his decision through a "gift." By changing the story, Basnage created in the Jews an effective foil for papal munificence while eliding the fact that papal Jewry policy, far from universally tolerant toward refugees, often severely limited the numbers of Jews allowed to live in church territories. It was, in other words, Basnage rather than Ibn Verga who labeled Roman Jews as "cruel and barbarous" and thus would long distort our understanding of Roman Jewish history.29 ROME'S GROWING JEWISH POPULATION Let us move now from historiography to demographics. Before we can evaluate the impact of immigration and changing ethnicity on institutional struc- tures in Rome, we need a better sense of the size and makeup of the city's Jewish population. The fourteenth century seems to have been a period of significant demographic decline. What had been a prosperous community of perhaps 1,000 Jews led by bankers who were well connected at the papal court during the 28. Basnage, L 'histoire des Juifs, reclamee et retablie, 104-8. 29. We can see Basnage's influence in Rodocanachi's use of politique to describe the order of Alexander VI that the Jewish community accept the refugees (Le Saint-Siege et lesjuif(, 68). Rodoca- nachi, who cites only Basnage as a source for his account, here echoes the terminology in Basnage's 1711 defense of tolerance (see above), though probably without intending the word's eighteenth- century connotations. Basnage may also be the source of Milano's considerably overstated claim that Roman Jews had asked that "no Hispanic or Sicilian Jew" be allowed to settle in the papal domin- ions; Ibn Verga only mentioned a specific band of Sephardic refugees from Genoa. 128</page><page sequence="11">Ethnicity and Institution Building Among Jews in Early Modem Rome twelfth century suffered along with the rest of the city from the popes' transfer to Avignon (1309) and the severe decimation of the Black Death (1348-50). When the popes returned to Rome in 1402, they acknowledged that "the Jews had greatly declined, both in number and in wealth, through deaths and other, innumerable impediments."30 Recovery was slow,31 but by the 1470s, both the community and the city were growing again, primarily through immigration.32 The famous Descriptio Urbis, a census dating from the end of 1526, lists 1,772 Jews (373 families) in Rome, representing 3.2% of the population.33 These figures no doubt declined again with the sack of the city the following year. A contemporary reported that "the number of congregations was reduced. [The Jews] were left few in number and many died ... whether by sword or by famine. Many left because of the heavy burden of the war."34 But the setback was apparently only temporary. It is estimated that by the 1590s, Rome's population had doubled to above 100,000, and the Jewish population was at roughly the same percentage as seventy years previous. The census of 1591 assumed 3,500 Jews, and a document of 1592 gives 3,553 Jews within an urban population of 116,698.35 Jewish immigrants came to Rome from many regions. Fifteenth-century documents speak of Jews from Rome's immediate contado, from the Papal States generally, and from other areas of Europe, especially France (i.e., Provence) and Germany.36 But from the 1490s, immigrants came primarily from the Iberian Peninsula and the regions of southern Italy under Spanish control.37 A 1506 meeting of ultramontani (recent Jewish immigrants from outside the Italian peninsula who did not identify with the Roman/Italiani majority)-included eighty heads of family. Of these, three-quarters were Iberian (especially Aragonese but also Castilian and Catalan), and one-quarter were French or German.38 30.

Cooperman At least during the first decade of the sixteenth century, the Italiani and ultra- montane communities were probably about the same size. Notarial evidence suggests that in 1509-10, the Italiani community consisted of about 75 male heads of family wealthy enough to be counted as fedeli of the various synago- gues.39 As I have mentioned, there were 80 ultramontani of this status in 1506. Based on the average size of Jewish households found in the 1526 census (4.77), a 1510 population of about 740 can be estimated, including 358 Italiani, 286 Sephardim, and fewer than 100 Ashkenazim-Francesi. Even assuming that Sephardim predominated among the immigrants who continued to come to Rome in subsequent years, it still does not seem likely that they would have become a majority of the 1,772 Jews in the city in 1526.40 Before 1527, five of Rome's eleven synagogues-including the largest, the fourteenth-century Scola Tempio-were devoted to the Italian rite; no other liturgical community had as many.41 Certainly, the 1569 expulsion of Jews from most of the Papal States brought even more Italiani to Rome and made them a clear majority. In 1571, the names found in the pinkas of the local charitable confraternity, the Hevrat Gemilut Hasadim, indicate a ratio of 71.6% to 28.4% in favor of the Italiani, that is, more than 2.5:1. In that year, the Italiani demanded that their overwhelming numerical majority in the population be recognized by a larger number of offices for representatives of their community.42 Even if Sephardim were not the largest Jewish group in Rome, were they perhaps especially wealthy and therefore threatening to the Italiani? At present, there is no clear evidence for any such economic dominance. The notarial archives indicate that for most of the fourteenth century, Rome's Jewry was generally made up of poor artisans and small-scale merchants specializing in various cloth and food trades.43 The leaders of the community and its richest members were almost all physicians.44 The once-dominant moneylen- ders had left the city, and Jews appear in the documents as debtors to Christians rather than as their creditors.45 By early in the next century, however, the Jewish money trade had revived to such an extent that in 1521, Leo X felt called upon to limit the number of bankers to twenty.46 When Anna Esposito discovered that by 1534, over half of the twenty were of Sephardic origin, she understood it as proof of Sephardic economic 39. Esposito found notarized listings of the fedeli for three of the five Italiani synagogues in 1509-10. Her lists mention 55 individual males. If we assume a minimum of 10 fedeli for each of the other two Italiani scolae, we have a total of at least 75 Italiani; Un 'altra Roma, 261-64. 40. Esposito, Un 'altra Roma, 131 f., basing herself on Toaff, "Ebrei spagnoli e marrani," 50, estimates the Sephardic Jewish population in sixteenth-century Rome at 500 to 1,000 or a bit more, the largest Sephardic community "on average" then in Italy. 41. Esposito, Un'altra Roma, 258-67. 42. Stow, The Jews in Rome, xliii, argues that in 1571 the Italiani represented more than 75% of the community. 43. Esposito, Un 'altra Roma, 168 ff. 44.

But this may be too hasty a conclusion. After all, it was likely Italiani Jews, well connected with the Medici popes Leo X and Clement VII, who would have been instrumental in gaining banking charters in Rome.47 Certainly, the dominant role of the Tuscan banker Daniel da Pisa in arranging the communal constitution of 1524 suggests that he was then the wealthiest of the city's Jewish bankers.48 THE OLD ITALIANI COMMUNITAS Was medieval Roman Jewry organized into a kehilah, and if so, what was the extent of its institutionalized powers? Recent archival research and the publi- cation of an ever-growing number of documents and archival registers now allow us to begin to answer that question for the fifteenth century. Notarial records speak of antepositi and factores of the community as early as 1390.49 In April 1402, the papal administration conceded certain privileges to Roman Jews and to the universitas Iudaeorum, adding specifically that this was a confirmation of privi- leges that had already been granted to the universitati dicti Iudaeorum by the Roman Republic on February 1, 1310. The document refers several times to officiales alii administratores et antepositi of the community, exempting them, for example, from wearing the required red Jews' cloak (tabarro rosso) during their term of office.50 A notarial document dating from 1461 gives us a clear picture of the elec- toral procedures and structures of the community's government. The adult males of the community met, apparently biannually, to elect executive teams, each of three factors. These teams would govern consecutively, each for a four- month term of office. Camerlenghi (stewards or treasurers) were also elected, each to serve for one year. All decisions were to be made by a two-thirds 47. On Sephardi bankers, see Esposito, Un'altra Roma, 133, n. 40. As a source for her view of Sephardic financial dominance, Esposito cites Bonfil, Gli ebrei in Italia, 84. In fact, however, Bonfil's point is that the wealth of the Sephardim allowed them to engage in mainstream commerce and to avoid marginal economic activities like moneylending (cf. Gli ebrei in Italia, 57; Jewish Life in Renaissance Italy, 62). Esposito treats banking in Rome more fully in "Credito, Ebrei, Monte di Pieta a Roma tra Quattro e Cinquecento," Roma Moderna e Contemporanea 10 (2002), 559-582.

In commenting on this paper, Professor Kenneth Stow raised the possibility that this Daniel da Pisa was a member not of the well-known Tuscan clan but rather of a Roman family with the same name. Be that as it may (and at least to date, I know of no reason to doubt the commonly ascribed Tuscan link), Daniel da Pisa would still have been of Italiani rather than Sephardic origin. 49.

Cooperman majority."5 As need arose, the factors might also appoint a special secretarius, who could fix or amend individual tax assessments, though the ultimate sanction of excommunication remained in the hands of the factors.52 These documents give the clear impression that Roman Jews were trying to limit the authority of their leaders quite severely. The factors' term of office was short. The 1461 election rules were careful to prevent the factors from co-opting others into their circle, even on a temporary basis. Only the community as a whole could select officers and representatives.53 In 1470, the council of three was empowered-actually, it was ordered (ut debeant et possint)-to appoint a council of seven boni iudei, who would join in discussing and deciding all com- munal issues.54 On the one hand, this expansion of the kehilah leadership indicates a desire for a stronger communal government: Increased legitimacy was granted by the addition of the Talmudically sanctioned "seven good men of the city," and the majority of Rome's Jews promised to obey the new body's rulings on pain of a twenty-five-ducat fine for each infraction. At the same time, this expanded council was also a clear limit on the independent authority of the factors. And here we come to a second characteristic of Rome's community. As Shlomo Simonsohn has already noted, there was an extremely close link between the papal taxation of Jews and the legal recognition of Rome's Jewish communal institutions.55 The medieval kehilah was, perhaps primarily, a mecha- nism for allocating and gathering taxes: 1130 florins nominally in support of the commune's carnival games Agonis e Testaccio, 100 florins to the papal vicar, and, from later in the fifteenth century, the increasingly frequent vigesima.56 Seen in this way, rather than being an expression of Jewish self-consciousness, the Roman community structure was a part of the papal fiscal administration; the community's domain was defined and its authority reinforced by papal admi- nistrators. It is no wonder, then, that the Jews tried to limit the authority of their leaders. The role of the papal edict in enabling or empowering the organized community helps to explain why, as Bonfil has already pointed out, a regional and federated association developed among the Jews of central Italy before 51.

It is interesting that in 1472, fourteen Jews appointed the representative to collect taxes from outside the city and hand the revenue over to the government; ibid., 164, 208 f. Esposito assumes that these fourteen were boni iudei (see note 54), but they may simply have been the wealthier taxpayers in the community, gathered together in accordance with the explicit provision of the 1461 agreement. The next year, only the threeJattori participated in the parallel appointment (210 f). 54. Ibid., appendix I, doc. 7, 202 f., and the discussion, 162 f.

In 1416, they decided to meet over the coming ten years whenever necessary to "stem the breach" (la'amod 'al ha-perez)--that is, to deal with those who refused to participate in the common tax burden. The delegates' worries about noncompliance were well founded. Enough Jews outside of Rome refused to pay their share that by 1420, the Roman community had to appeal to the papacy for help in collecting the tax outside the city.59 Over the course of a few years, the papal impost also gave rise to the forma- lization of these local communities beyond Rome. At their meeting of 1418, the delegates demanded that each settlement elect officials on a regular basis, something they admitted was an innovation: With regard to the rules for elections [seder ha-minui] written in the earlier agreement [of 1416], even though thoseprocedures have not been fully observed up until now [she-lo' nitkayem ha-seder ha-hu bi-shlemut 'ad ha-yom] we have now decided that every community is required to confirm and fulfill that pro- cedure, such that every community for whom it is appropriate shall always have a formal elected official who will oversee the existence and structure [kiyum u-ma 'amad] of the community. These officials shall have the power and authority to issue by-laws and restrictions [le-taken takanot ve-ligdor gderot] in their communities according to the needs of the moment. No one may disobey them. And the entire community is to support the official and force the recalcitrant in any matter ordered by the official until the recalcitrant one repents of his evil and fulfills the commandment of God and the community. The delegates at Forli were trying to take advantage of their enforced gathering to build community structures and to address broad issues of collective security and behavior. Still, the reason for their gathering, the content of their decisions, and their sense of legitimacy and authority, all derived directly from the delegates' role as collectors of the papal tax.60 57.

Cooperman Did the community have the authority to impose its will on members in matters other than taxation? Though she acknowledges the limitations of Jewish courts in civil and certainly criminal matters, Anna Esposito declares that the Jewish community possessed "juridical autonomy that was recognized by the papal and municipal authorities" and that there was "a 'rabbinic court' for resol- ving internal disputes, especially in matters of matrimony and inheritance." As proof, she points out that Latin contracts and litigation settlements drawn up by Christian notaries sometimes referred to prior Hebrew documents. She also finds mention of "the officials of the Roman Jewish community who are to judge and rule according to the Law of Moses" in a 1472 marriage contract. Two such "communal judges" were mentioned by name in a document of 1493. As further proof of Jewish judicial independence, Esposito cites the papal appointments of Leuccio di Angelo as "governor and judge" of the community in 1426 and of Bonet de Lattes with similar powers at the end of the century under Alexander VI.61 Other scholars have painted a much more limited picture of Jewish judicial independence in late medieval Rome. In his classic 1945 study of the application of Jewish law in Italy, the legal historian Vittore Colorni was certain "that Jews never had the right to maintain rabbinic tribunals." Colorni refused to believe that Jewish rabbinic courts had existed since classical times, as some historians had suggested, without leaving any trace.62 In several more recent and very detailed studies, Robert Bonfil similarly stresses that the church consistently refused to recognize any jurisdiction for a Jewish court.63 In his history of the Italian rabbinate during the Renaissance, Bonfil devotes special attention to the situation in Rome and notes the institutional weakness of the communal rabbinate there.64 The disagreement among these historians is, on a certain level, a technical and terminological one because each deals with the question of jurisdiction from a different perspective. All agree that Jews in Rome regularly made use of rabbinic authorities and halakhically defined procedures to resolve internal disputes, at least in the form of binding arbitration, even if they then relied on Christian notaries to document the results. What we should like to know is whether Jewish courts had jurisdiction over recognized spheres, whether they had subpoena and enforcement powers, and whether they were linked to specific Jewish ethnic groups or to the entire community. The two cases in which the papacy empowered individuals as judges give us some insight into these questions. The 1426 letter appointing the physician Leuccio di Angelo "governor and judge" outlines Pope Martin V's concern of about dissension and frequent quarrels 61. Esposito, Un 'altra Roma, 244, but see her more nuanced presentation, 150-54 and 166; cf. Umberto Cassuto, Gli ebrei a Firenze, 203, 212 ff.; as well as Bonfil's comments, Ha-rabanut, 154. 62.

The pope, therefore, appointed Leuccio over his fellow Jews, hoping that the prestige of formal office as well as the power to fine (to be enforced by the papal treasury) would lead to greater peace. But it must be stressed that this was a personal office, not recognition of an institutionalized Jewish leadership, and the license states repeatedly that the position was valid only at the pleasure of the pope.65 Moreover, a surviving notarial record from 1480 seems to indicate that, at least at that late date, Leuccio was acting as much as an arbitrator as he was an appointed judge. In resolving a controversy between two Jews, Leuccio states explicitly that he heard the case as an arbitrator (arbiter et arbitrator etc. electus et deputatus a partibus). At the same time, however, he was "sitting as a court in a certain wooden-tiled place in the synago- gue of the Roman Jewish community which we have chosen and appointed as our place of judgment and law."66 The same ambivalence or hesitation about a papally empowered judge is seen in the case of Bonet de Lattes. During the first years of the sixteenth century, the community was faced with repeated cases in which rabbis were forced to decide whether a marriage was binding and whether the young woman required a formal bill of divorce in order to be free. From the surviving documentation, it appears that in the second of these cases, at least the bride, and perhaps both she and the groom, were Sephardic, and a Sephardic scholar, R. Hayim Usilio, took it upon himself to declare the girl free to marry. Bonet de Lattes, then apparently rabbi of the community, ruled otherwise, but he did not insist on his authority. Rather, he suggested that the case be submitted to prominent rabbis in nearby towns. There are two points of significance to be made here. First, the struggle was clearly one that threatened to divide communities. When members of the bride's family heard of de Lattes's ruling, they declared, "We will not consent to you nor will we listen to you. We will not accept you as communal rabbi. Rather, we shall accept the opinion of the Sephardic rabbi and we will follow him in this matter." Note that de Lattes himself was Provengal, as were many of the rabbis then serving the Italiani community, and when he appealed the case, he turned to an Ashkenazi authority, R. Judah Mintz. Equally significant, de Lattes had been appointed communal judge, presum- ably in the same way that Leuccio di Angelo had been decades earlier. He was quite proud of the fact that he was both "an ordained rabbi and accepted by the community," but he had also been "authorized by the court of our lord, the pope, may his excellence be exalted, for the glory of our holy Torah, to issue decrees and to impose decisions on rival parties such that they must listen to my voice." But even though he had sought papal backing to give his decisions greater weight among his coreligionists, de Lattes was unwilling (or unable) to 65. Simonsohn, The Apostolic See, ?639, 743 f. Cf. the same pope's edict that Jews of Italy be allowed to settle issues among themselves by arbitration and that otherwise local (non-Jewish) magis- trates judge them according to summary and just rules; ibid., ?658, 773 f. 66.

"I do not wish," he wrote, "to decree or decide, until a third party rules between us."67 The organized Jewish kehilah of Rome existed uncomfortably between the collective needs of the Jews themselves and the intrusive, often hostile oversight of the papal bureaucracy. Kehilah leadership was primarily charged with collect- ing the pope's taxes, and it was to papal authorization that leaders and judges turned for their communal power. At times of internal conflict, this extrinsic autho- rization must have weakened the leaders' legitimacy, especially because the papacy itself was unwilling to grant the Jews the full dignitas of true self-govern- ment. There are hints that Jews were striving toward greater structure-for example, by appointing the seven "good men of the city" and by seeking papal backing for court rulings. But the Roman community at the end of the fifteenth century still derived its authority from special, ad personam, and temporary papal privileges rather than from a regularized and recognized group status. There is certainly no evidence that Rome's Jews had the power to decide which Jews would be allowed to settle in the city. Basnage's assumption of a Jewish community that could have admitted Sephardic settlers into Rome but refused until forced to do so by the pope simply does not line up with what we know of this period. DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE AND INSTITUTIONAL EVOLUTION What, then, was the impact of demographic growth and diversity on the institutional structure of Roman Jewry? As we shall see, the answer is complex. The newcomers tended to both create multiple, small organizations and, at the same time, gather together into a single community, separate but related to the existing universitas. Perhaps the most obvious result of the influx was the increase in the number of synagogues in Rome. There had long been separate Jewish facilities in the Trastevere area, a substantial Jewish neighborhood at least since the beginning of the Quattrocento.68 A few wealthy individuals had been licensed to maintain private chapels in their homes.69 But now we see new prayer associations meeting even within the Piazza Mercatello area where the Scola Tempio was located, and indeed within the Scola Tempio building itself. By 1527, Rome could boast at least eleven synagogues, some in their own build- ings and others sharing facilities but likely maintaining separate liturgical services.70 Synagogue growth was more than a matter of numbers. A fundamental change had occurred in the structure of Roman Jewry: About half of the synago- gues were now associated with specific "ethnic" groups. In Francisco Delicado's 67.

And over there are the Germans, and the other is the French, and this belongs to the Romaneschi and Italians who are the most foolish of all the other groups [naciones] because they imitate the Gentiles and don't even know their Law. Our Spanish [Jews] are the most knowledgeable, for there are learned and wealthy individuals among them and they are very crafty [resabidos]. Delicado's list of Rome's ethnic synagogues can be expanded and refined. The Spanish Jews, for example, at first formed a single synagogue in Rome, but soon they split apart into as many as four. By 1501, there were two Sephardic synagogues, one apparently meeting in the quarters of the other, and by 1505, there were three (Aragonese, Castilian, and Catalan), each with its own fattore (official).72 The Castilian synagogue itself had split by 1511 into "old" and "new," a division that lasted until at least 1521.73 For the most part, these synagogue groups were quite small. Notarial documents give membership lists of a dozen or two for each.74 Even if such lists mentioned only the wealthiest adult males, it is clear that the synagogues remained somewhat tenuous institutions. This must have been especially true for the immigrant synagogues, which had to acquire and develop new facilities and probably could not rely on support from the central community. The almost dizzying pace at which Roman immigrants organized and reor- ganized themselves into synagogues during the early years of the sixteenth century is not a sign of contentiousness or rivalry. Organizational volatility in this context was more likely a reflection of cultural dislocation and the special sociocultural function of the synagogue as an identity marker. Even though the liturgy had been regularized throughout the Jewish world, small but significant differences of detail distinguished each community's prayer service. For each group of 71.

Cooperman immigrants, therefore, preserving the sound and feel of its remembered liturgical tradition was a stabilizing factor that allowed for a sense of continuity in the face of disruption and displacement. We can feel this sense of longing for the past in a description of the Sephardic congregations' development in Rome by the contemporary preacher, Isaac de Lattes: When the multitude from Spain was exiled and dispersed among the nations, they were all mixed together, family with family and tribe with tribe. They were expelled suddenly, each individual from his region and zone, from Aragon, Castile and Catalonia, from the realm of the king of Spain. When some of them came together in Rome and settled there, they at first would all assemble in a mixed group to pray together. But this was unsatisfying since each individual was drawn to his ancestral ritual (minhag 'avotav). They decided therefore to split off according to "families" and they created multiple synagogues, one for the Aragonese family and one for the Castilian.75 In the context of the time, when exile had ruptured the continuity of Jewish prac- tice, we can easily understand how the specific details of ritual custom would have gained elevated importance, becoming in effect a liturgical anchor for identity. Doing things as they "used to be done" could become an almost magical impera- tive for believers.76 In this atmosphere, it was the very stability and "authenticity" of the ritual that guaranteed its efficaciousness, and it became doubly important to maintain traditions exactly. The resultant anxiety is clear in the almost strident insistence by the Sephardic widow Setta that her heirs "carry out every ritual both at the burial and in the synagogues and every other required office for [her] soul" (1501).77 Of course, ethnic distinctions could have important, potentially divisive halakhic implications. We have already mentioned the debate in Rome between a Sephardic and a local authority over the requirement for a divorce and the declaration of the Sephardic family that it would not accept the auth- ority of the recognized community. But on the whole, the preservation of local liturgies did not seem to lead to radical splits in Rome. Rather, diversity offered an enriched set of cultural opportunities for all. The Aragonese Talmud Torah Confraternity, for example, introduced a special annual celebration on the holiday of Shavu'ot (Pentecost), to which they invited the entire Roman community-men, women, and children. This community celebration of a Sephardic custom was apparently quite popular, and even non-Aragonese came and accepted synagogue honors-honors that presumably entailed potentially costly charitable contributions. Indeed, a mark of its success can be seen in the fact that the Catalonian community tried to institute a rival 75. Schwarzfuchs, "Controversie nella Comunitai di Roma," Hebrew section, 136. 76. To my knowledge, no one has yet investigated the frequent and, to my mind, causal con- nection between exile and written compendia of minhagim (customary practices), a specialized form of Jewish memorialization. 77.

Questions of ethnic identity aside, there can be no question that the new immigration contributed to an increasingly complex and sophisticated structure of communal governance. At the very least, each new prayer association added an organizational unit to Roman Jewry. It may be that Sephardim were especially insistent on higher levels of formal organization in Rome, as they were elsewhere in the period.79 As early as 1495 or 1496, we see that "the entire community of Spanish Jews living in Rome" met to appoint three men who will have the power to elect antiposti for the said community. Those three men are Maestro Mayr, don Solema Aven Lope, and None Almercharen. Those three deputies have [in turn] elected as antiposti Moyses ben Venisti and Moyses de Banes who were deputized by the entire said community. The aforementioned antiposti elected the following six advisors [consiglieri]: Mastro Salamon Sette, don Vitale Ben Venisti, don Abraym Naynias, mastro Davit Aven Ras, don Solema Ben Lopez, Sala- mone Antali. The said antiposti were given full and absolute power to order, to tax, and to act in all matters (de rascione et de facto) concerning anything which seems to them, and which they deem, necessary and useful for the said community. No one may contradict that which the said leaders shall have ordered or done, on pain of the major and minor excommunications. [Given] in the presence of Mayr de Loans of Ferrara and luda ben Venisti, notary of the said community.80 We do not know whether this governing structure was created for the first Sephardic synagogue (described previously by Isaac de Lattes) or, as appears more likely, for a separate communal organization. Either way, when the unified synagogue broke apart, each daughter congregation created its own, quite sophisticated administration. Thus, in 1511, the thirty-one members of the Aragonese community gathered to write elaborate rules concerning the election ofparnasim and counselors, the budgetary limits on these officials, the procedures for transfer of authority, and so forth. Particularly prominent were the membership rules that were intended to both define the community (newcomers could not join 78.

Cooperman until they had lived in Rome for a year) and guarantee its long-term survival. As Esposito notes, these constitutional rules are the earliest we have for any commu- nity in Rome, antedating as they do the constitution of Daniel da Pisa by more than a decade.81 And here we can note another significant aspect of immigration's insti- tutional impact. Though the immigrant community tended to fracture and split apart into "ethnic" associations for prayer, it did the reverse when it came to broader sociopolitical concerns. It was "all the foreign Jews living in Rome" as a group who took on the established community, the universitas of native Roman Jews, before the papal authorities. Though the newcomers were taxed by the kehilah, they had apparently not been allowed to hold the office of factor or even to have a voice in the election. They appealed collectively to Pope Julius II and, by 1505, had been guaranteed one of the three factorial offices. The pope ruled, moreover, that if the foreigners' representative had not been invited to participate in deliberations, any decision reached by the other two factors was invalid and not binding on the ultramontani. Even if procedures had been properly followed, disagreements between the two groups could be brought before a papal official. Finally, the ultramontani were granted the right to call on any of three different bishops-members of the papal curia-as advocates and legal protectors.82 The bill of 1505 was a significant landmark in the constitutional history of Roman Jewry because, in addressing the issue of non-Romans' rights to representation in the community, it sharpened the inner contradiction that was implicit in past papal practice. In 1505, Julius II recognized the ultramon- tani as a separate community while simultaneously granting them a group right to membership in the general community with representation on its board of factors. The pope simultaneously recognized and limited the power of the Jewish community. He acknowledged that the factors took care of "each and every affair of the community" (omnibus et singulis dicte universi- tatis negotiis) even as he reiterated that papal officials had ultimate jurisdiction in all internal disputes. From 1505, the Roman community was left with a cumbersome organiz- ational structure that was subject to confusing and contradictory pressures. From the papacy came directives that functionally strengthened-and simul- taneously refused to legitimize-the independent authority of the kehilah. The competing interests and diverse cultural identities of Roman and various ultramon- tane Jewish groups fostered separate communal organizations on some levels but encouraged cooperative action on others. Increased numbers strained the existing framework, but the community was never large enough or wealthy enough to support fully autonomous institutions, especially in the absence of governmental support. 81. Esposito, Un'altra Roma, 269 ff. 82. The text of the bill confirming the foreign Jews' privileges is reproduced in Simonsohn, The Apostolic See, ? 1179, 1482 f. Judging from Simonsohn's summary, it seems that a line or two of the text was accidentally omitted. 140</page><page sequence="23">Ethnicity and Institution Building Among Jews in Early Modem Rome The position of the ultramontani was complex. Despite their seat on the board of factors and their group representation on the community's general council, or keria,83 they maintained their own collectivity as well. In 1506, they met to form a separate organization with a twelve-man board to deal with the welfare needs of the many impoverished refugees coming to the city. The eighty Jews at the initial meeting were drawn from four groups-the combined Franco-German community and the three separate Sephardic congregations- and the twelve leadership positions were also to be evenly divided among the four groups.84 The ultramontane community was still a separate entity in 1516, when its fattori acquired ownership of the cemetery used by non-Italiani.85 We can easily imagine the friction that would have arisen within a weak and fede- rated kehilah structure, a taxing body that was charged with raising large amounts of revenue to meet papal demands but that could simultaneously delegate the costs of social welfare to its constituent units, each of which, in turn, had the right to appeal any collective decision to papal officials. It is no wonder that by 1524, the community found itself plagued by "infi- nite disorders" and met to draft a new constitution that would accommodate and guarantee fair "ethnic" representation. A drafting committee was chosen made up of equal numbers of Italiani and ultramontani, and as we would expect, the papally sanctioned arrangements of 1505 were confirmed and even expanded. In addition to one of three positions as fattore, the ultramontani were guaranteed one of the two annually elected stewardships (camerlenghi).86 A FORMULA FOR GOVERNANCE We began our investigation with Solomon Ibn Verga's narrative of ethnic exclusion by Jews in late quattrocento Rome, and it is fitting that we end by reevaluating that tale in light of what we have learned. Without Basnage's tendentious embellishment, Ibn Verga's tale is not nearly as startling, nor Roman Jewry's actions as reprehensible, as had been assumed. The Roman reaction was, after all, realistic. The small community of perhaps two or three hundred must have felt overwhelmed by the refugees at their gates. The Roman Jews were not wealthy, and their charitable funds were certainly unequal to the task of caring for possibly large numbers of newcomers. The Romans could point to a long-standing and eminently practical principle of Jewish welfare policy: "The poor of one's own city must come before the 83. When the Aragonese organized in 1511, one of the electoral procedures they set up was for the annual selection of tre della cheria-that is, of three men who "customarily" represented them on the overall council of elders; see Esposito, Un 'altra Roma, 270. 84.

It may be that the ultramontane community was not yet orga- nized when this property was first purchased because the land was acquired by a private individual, Mose di Cori, and transferred to the community fattori only in 1516. The plot of land was adjacent to the older community's cemetery. 86.

Cooperman poor of another city."87 There is no reason, it seems to me, not to accept Ibn Verga's account at face value as a more or less accurate version of what actually happened. But it is exactly because it is believable that we should take the tale seriously and consider how the Roman Jews' actions reflect on their communal organization and political principles. Welfare issues aside, what we see here is that the Jews acted as a guild to keep competitors out of their closed trading community; they were, in other words, invoking the hezkat yishuv. Originally developed in northern Europe, this legal convention-a claim to exclusive right of settlement-was by now well established among the Jewish moneylenders of Renaissance Italy. R. Joseph Colon, arguably the leading halakhic authority in fif- teenth-century Italy (d. 1480), had stressed the right of local Jews to turn to the non-Jewish authorities to keep others out: If [a resident] is able to "close the door" in front of [a new immigrant] and keep him from entering, it is of course obvious that he has this right. Would you want rather to argue that the local citizen is kept at ground level while the foreigner rises to the highest heavens [i.e., that the local has fewer rights than the foreigner]? Just as [the outsider] is trying to use the governing authority to gain entrance against the will of the city's residents, so too [the residents] may stop him by recourse to the governing authority.... Who is the person so lacking in intelligence that he would err in this? Anyone who suggests [otherwise] is in error; any judge who would rule [differently] is no judge! Ibn Verga, for his part, might not have seen things this way, not only because he identified with the refugees but also because, as a Sephardi himself, he may have had no experience with such legalized monopolies, for they were not generally recognized on the Iberian Peninsula.88 Roman Jewry, on the other hand, must have been quite familiar with the institution.89 87.

Joseph Colon is taken from his Responsa (Jerusalem: Oraysoh, 1988), ? 191 (in some editions, ? 187), 417-24, esp. 420. The phrase comparing the rights of the native born or citizen with those of a stranger is a standard Talmudic expression indicating an illegitimate distinction; see, for example, B. Bava Kama 42a. 89. Roman Jewish scholars may have first encountered the principle of hezkat yishuv in a letter sent to them from Paris during the early twelfth century; S. D. Luzzatto, Beit ha-'ozar, vol. I (1847; repr. Jerusalem: Kedem, 1971), folios 58-59, translated in Irving Agus, Urban Civilization in Pre-Crusade Europe, vols. 1-2 (New York: Yeshiva University, 1965), 224-27. By the sixteenth century, however, Rome was quite familiar with this method of imposing communal discipline. Isaac de Lattes, the preacher whom we have already encountered in Rome in these years, expressed astonishment when 142</page><page sequence="25">Ethnicity and Institution Building Among Jews in Early Modem Rome But once we consider Roman Jewry in this light, we become aware of something in Ibn Verga's story that we might otherwise have missed. There is no mention that Roman Jews ever invoked the hezkat yishuv, and Ibn Verga never suggests that they appealed to rabbinic authorities for support of their civic monopoly. Their only tactic was apparently to bribe the non-Jewish auth- orities. Here again, I am inclined to take Ibn Verga's tale at face value. Careful consideration of practice in Italy explains why Roman Jews could not have made a halakhic claim. The crucial right of hezkat yishuv-that is, of population control-was always halakhically problematic because the right to keep a fellow Jew from settling in a city could not easily be derived from biblical or Talmudic precedent. On a practical level, hezkat yishuv seems to have been recognized by halakhic authorities only as the right to protect an already-existing and state-issued settlement privilege or localized business license.90 As we have seen, the Roman community had no exclusive condotta on which to base a monopolistic privilege, nor could individual Roman Jews in 1492 point to moneylending licenses in a halakhic claim to hazakah. Hence, when Roman Jewry appealed to Alexander VI, they could not claim a communal right to exclusiveness in either secular or halakhic terms. For his part, in refusing the request, Pope Alexander was reiterating the church's long-standing objection to a strong self-governing kehilah. That Roman Jews could decide on their coreligionists' admission was a notion invented by Basnage. The Sephardim entered Rome because the local community was both legally and halakhically too weak to stop them. The subsequent three decades were, I believe, a period of communal growth, reorganization, and political debate in Rome as the various 'edot sought not only a modus vivendi but also an answer to their overarching problem: the weak auth- ority of their kehilah. A century earlier, Roman Jews had taken advantage of the power given them by a fiscal obligation to institute communal regulation. Now again, they would go beyond the papal mandate concerning an immediate problem to frame a powerful justificatory rationale for a stronger community. The community, they declared, was in crisis. It was vitally necessary to "put a stop to unending disorder and to eradicate the evil plants, the sinful and wicked people who have turned [volti?] from the straight path and the honest mode of living that is pleasing unto God and man." There had been specific incidents: People had seen "evil and villainous individuals" swear falsely in God's name he discovered a little later that Bologna, "though a mother city in Israel, did not enforce the takanot yishuv"; Cooperman, "Political Discourse in a Kabbalistic Register," 63, 91*. As is well known, in the age of the ghetto the hazakah over housing would be widely recognized and acknowledged even in non-Jewish courts as thejus gazaga. 90. See, for example, responsum 267 in She 'elot u-teshuvot R. 'Azriel b "R. Shelomo Dayena, ed. Yacov Boksenboim (Tel-Aviv: Tel-Aviv University, 1979), 2:478-81, esp. 480.

These sinners were litigious and rowdy; they had obstructed and offended with their venomous streams [zampilli?] of words. It was the framers' hope that "God [would] destroy, finish off, and remove these people who sin in their souls, [so] that good people might live happily and contentedly, in peace and in love." The breakdown of social order would be addressed by strict norms of behavior. The constitution must guarantee, the framers declared, "that the young not precede the old, the base not precede the noble, the ignorant not precede the sage. Every man should maintain his place. He shall rise through the proper and suitable apprentice stages [gradi delli gioveni] in the affairs of the community [universitdi]." Maintaining proper social status and decorum would allow for a community "united as brothers in heart and word for the common good." On an immediate level, the new arrangements would put an end to the counterproductive and chaotic situation in which individuals acted each in accordance with his or her own interests. Now, all would pool their resources [faccino comunemente una spesa sola]. And thus, the real purpose of communal life would be served: Every man will follow that straight and useful path [that leads] towards virtu- ous political life and earns praise. We shall obligate ourselves in the name of our Creator always to preserve justice as well as reason. May the glorious God be praised for stimulating and awakening the soul of every man to a life of perfecting justice and reason.... The [constitution] will allow everyone to perfect his soul and give an account of it to God, may He be praised. To the administrative challenge posed by immigration and multiple ethnicities, the Roman Jews replied with a political vision blending conservative social principles and powerful religious rhetoric.91 We cannot yet claim to understand all the factors and considerations that lay behind the capitoli of 1524. We do not clearly know the jurisdictional limits of the new governing body, nor can we detail its relationship with either the various 'edot or the papal officials who judged both civil and criminal issues involving Jews.92 It is also clear that economic status was at least as important as ethnicity in framing the document. The drafters were drawn separately from three groups of twenty- one of bankers, one of the "wealthy" (also called artisans), and one of the "mid- dling sort." Is this hierarchical structure a reflection of real divisions within Rome's community, or is it based on widely accepted political models drawn from either the Italian communes or other Jewish communities?93 We must note that the authors of the capitoli continued to seek papal approval to give their 91. It remains to be clarified how original and revolutionary this political rhetoric was; for now, it is enlightening to compare this text with the kind of justification expressed in a medieval Sephardic formulary for the appointment of a communal leader; R.

It is to be hoped that the current intensive research in Roman archives will yield further information, both on the individuals who framed this document and on their specific intent. Meanwhile, we can note that the capitoli proved a stable foundation for the community even in the aftermath of the tumultuous events of 1527 and, after 1555, when Roman Jewry was confined behind the high walls of the ghetto.
