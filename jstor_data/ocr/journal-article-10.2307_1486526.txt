<plain_text><page sequence="1">Leon J. Weinberger. Jewish Hymnography: A Literary History. London: Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 1998. xxiii, 492 pp. Jewish postbiblical liturgical poetry (piyyut) in a range of genres for all liturgical situations has been composed ever since the late rabbinic period. The publication and analysis of the voluminous materials discovered in the Cairo genizah have enabled scholars to understand much more fully the development of these complex liturgical and literary traditions. In the last</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 129 century, and especially in recent decades, a library of books on the subject has appeared, including critical editions of the oeuvres of individual poets, many of whom were previously unknown or known only by name, and more comprehensive volumes analyzing literary developments or specific rites. Little of this is accessible to those lacking a sophisticated knowledge of Hebrew. Leon Weinberger's Jewish Hymnography: A Literary History addresses this lacuna with an English discussion of the development of piyyut from its origins in late antiquity through the late medieval world. Although he admits that true comprehensiveness is impossible (p. 3), Weinberger covers a broader range of poetic traditions here than did Ezra Fleischer in his equally massive Shirat Hakodesh Ha 'Ivrit Biyemei Habeinayim (Keter, 1975), dedicating fully half his book to the Romaniote poetic traditions (including the Karaites). His first 192 pages mostly abbreviate Fleischer's dense 486 pages, dedicating chapters to the preclassical, classical, and postclassical periods of hymnography in Eretz Yisrael (and Babylonia), the Spanish traditions, and the traditions of Italy, Ashkenaz, and England. Like Fleischer before him, Weinberger does not look beyond the countries north and east of the Mediterranean, a glaring omission given his extensive treatment of the Greco-Romaniote rites and recent publications on the poetry of North Africa and Yemen. Weinberger preserves Fleischer's basic organization of topics, addressing issues of language, style, and genre in each period. Hebrew texts appear (in transliteration) only when he addresses untranslatable issues like rhyme, meter, or alliteration. Otherwise, poetry appears only in English. Unlike Fleischer, he includes brief but more direct discussions of select individual payyetanim, including excerpts from their poetry. To organize and condense such a vast and complex topic successfully requires the careful crafting of a formula to structure every chapter and provide consistent criteria for the inclusion or exclusion of the available information. This allows interested readers to construct for themselves some of the comparative connections that would confuse the narrative structure of the book. It also prevents the author's own interests from intruding excessively into the survey and allows the depth of any particular discussion to signal to the reader the importance of the subject. While Weinberger does have a basic formula, it is not always successful, and his deviations from it are often misleading or lead to redundancies. Several times he discusses a specific point of content or poetics twice, once as the poet's contribution and once as</page><page sequence="3">130 BOOK REVIEWS a characteristic of the period. Perhaps to avoid this redundancy, Weinberger omits all direct discussion of the internationally influential Sephardi poets. Most of the discussion of Yannai actually appears in the section titled "Qillir," which discusses classical poetics in general, although a postclassical example creeps in. Yannai, Qillir, and Sa'adyah are the only classical and postclassical poets to merit individual attention; in contrast, the Italian Anan b. Marino, of whose work only a single poem is known, and numerous Romaniote poets merit their own sections. "New Genres" appears as a heading only for the postclassical period; the significant innovations of other eras are embedded in other discussions. More significantly, Weinberger never gives the uninitiated reader a clear sense of how piyyut works as liturgy or literature; he illustrates with extracts and rarely presents full compositions. His illustrations also disproportionately voice anti-Christian (or anti-Muslim) polemic. Some literary devices are first mentioned in passages pertaining to matters coming generations after their origins, and his history of syllabic meter is inconsistent (pp. 150 and 341). His treatments of the use of rabbinic literature and legend by the poets and many of his historical discussions are problematic or outdated. The most obvious organizational peculiarity of this book, its emphasis on the Romaniote rites, is also its greatest strength and its unique contribution. Weinberger's own scholarly contribution has been the publication of the stylistically more derivative poetry of these rites. The second half of the book is a rich summary of his findings, with discussions and examples much more extensive than those in the first half of the book. Indeed, while he totally ignores regional rites in the rest of the Jewish world and pays limited attention to their historical development, this section preserves detail on several discrete sub-rites and time periods. The chapter on Karaite piyyut is also significant. The challenge of composing a comprehensive English history of piyyut that does justice to Hebrew poetics is formidable. The Hebrew reader is still better served by Fleischer and his Israeli colleagues. While Weinberger's volume will aid the English reader, the novice will find it confusing. Its value lies in its treatment of the Romaniote rites. Ruth Langer Boston College Chestnut Hill, Mass.</page></plain_text>
