<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROLEGOMENON TO THE STUDY OF JEWISH-CHRISTIANITIES IN RABBINIC LITERATURE by BURTON L. VISOTZKY The Christian, Jewish, and Jewish-Christian Communities They just don't fit very neatly; they never did. Ever since it became clear that the law-free mission to the gentiles would create a church and not a synagogue, Jewish-Christianity has been an uncomfortable reality with which to deal. The "Synagogue" didn't like it. The "Church Catholic" didn't like it. And modern scholarship, far less ready to accept the vagaries of a religion that resembles but cannot be made to fit known varieties of religion, seems to like it even less. Jewish-Christians seemed to want to hang on to an anachronism, a mission that should have failed already in Paul's lifetime. Yet it is the very fact that Jewish-Christianity occupies a middle ground between Judaism and Christianity (as though there were such "normative" religions in antiquity or today) that makes it the object of fascination to modern scholarship. If one could but define Jewish-Christianity, one could locate the borders of the two "parent" religions-so seems to be the logic of much modern scholarship in dealing with the phenomenon. Hence, a great deal has been written recently, attempting to define Jewish-Christianity so This essay was written during my tenure as a Visiting Fellow of Clare Hall, University of Cambridge, and as a Visiting Scholar at the Oxford Centre for Post-Graduate Hebrew Studies. A generous grant from the Abbell Publication Fund of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America supported the research. 47</page><page sequence="2">48 BURTON L. VISOTZKY that scholars could get on with the business of placing it somewhere between "real" Judaism and "real" Christianity, neatly.' This approach presumes that there are borders which can be drawn when there are virtually none. For the study of Judaism and Christianity in antiquity teaches us that there is not any one normative or real Judaism, nor is there any one true church or Church Catholic. We have learned to speak of ancient Judaisms and ancient Christianities. We must learn not only to speak also of Jewish-Christianities, but to accept that the disparate com- munities which make up this rather broad rubric will fall along the entire continuum of biblical religions in late antiquity. The problem has been recognized for some time. Ever since Walter Bauer wrote his Orthodoxy and Heresy,2 scholars have reluctantly recog- nized that they must abandon the Eusebian notion of a Great Church Catholic towering over antiquity. Instead, studies have had to be limited to a wide variety of Christianities, each different from the One Church over which Constantine would have liked to preside and often identical with the other Christian movements condemned by that church. In other words, a millennium and a half after their existence, scholars were forced to stop viewing certain communities and churches as heretical and to view them instead as authentic expressions of Christian religion in antiquity. It remains a difficult task for a variety of reasons: old views die hard, modern religious beliefs impose certain biases in favor of the monolithic view of the church and, quite simply, scholars are not happy about having to master vast new 1.

But the business has changed; it is no longer the History of Christianity, but the History of Christianities. A similar reluctance has dogged Jewish studies. Scholars of the period post-70 still prefer to view the history of Judaism in that era as the history of Rabbinic Judaism. When a scholar takes the time (a very long time at that) to master the rabbinic corpus, he or she is loath to turn and ask, what comes next? On the other extreme there are scholars with limited Hebrew skills or with certain prejudices who refrain from mastery of rabbinic litera- ture and rely instead on Apocrypha, Pseudepigrapha, Josephus, Philo, and Qumran for their notion of Judaism in antiquity (these scholars have for the most part ceased using the term Sptitjudenthum). Few students at all bother to incorporate the masses of archaeological evidence which point to Judaisms other than rabbinic; to say the least of the even smaller number who try to learn patristic and Greco-Roman literature for their pictures of Judaism. There is an awesome body of material to master if the job is to be done properly. Unfortunately, many of those who have bothered have tended to treat one literature as primary and the others as buttresses to the view that corpus may present. Even more exasperating are those who attempt to harmonize all of the above into one homogeneous "Judaism in Late Antiquity." Needless to say, the religion of a scholar has a curious effect on the view of Judaism adopted and on the literature he or she chooses to study. We remain yet a long way from the study of Judaisms in late antiquity. Nevertheless, a start has been made in the study of Jewish-Christianities. Two notable articles have contributed a great deal to the idea of multiple communities. The first, for the patristic period, was G. Strecker's appendix to Bauer, which he titled, "On the Problem of Jewish Christianity."3 Strecker wished to point out an area which Bauer had ignored, but in doing so, described the Jewish-Christian communities of late antiquity as separate entities. He worked from the evidence of two bodies of literature and avoided the temptation to harmonize them into one Jewish-Christianity identifiable with a heresy singled out by the church. More recently, Raymond Brown has taken this approach for the study of New Testament Jewish-Christianity. He has suggested that at the outset of the Christian mission there were not only a law-free and a law-observant 3. G. Strecker, apud Bauer, op. cit.</page><page sequence="4">50 BURTON L. VISOTZKY mission, but four different missions, each representing a differing form of early Christianity.4 The result of Brown's study is to increase the variety of Jewish-Christianities for the New Testament period. His work, combined with Strecker's advances, will force scholars to reexamine the notion of a monolithic Jewish-Christianity, much as must be done for Judaisms and Christianities in late antiquity. The end result of this new scholarship willing to take account of each small community as an authentic, independent phenomenon will not be visi- ble for at least a generation. By then, scholars will come to be satisfied when they conclude that this painful ambiguity of broad definition is an accurate reflection of late antiquity. Then, and only then, can the study of Jewish- Christianities seriously begin. My own field, rabbinic literature, is one of the important components in the study of Jewish-Christianity that remains largely ignored.5 To en- courage the mingling of the Sea of the Talmud with the murky waters of Jewish-Christianity, I should like to briefly chart some of the territories which must be navigated for such an undertaking. Christian Literatures as Sources for Jewish-Christianities There are four major literatures to be surveyed for basic information about Jewish-Christianity: works identified as Jewish-Christian, the works of Christian heresiologists, Gnostic sources, and patristic literature. One must add archaeological data to the above materials, but such data are limited and subject to a great deal of disagreement in interpretation. Among the Jewish-Christian literatures are the Pseudo-Clementines,6 4. R. E. Brown, "Not Jewish Christianity and Gentile Christianity But Types of Jewish/ Gentile Christianity," Catholic Bible Quarterly 45 (1983): 74-79. Brown credits our colleague, J. Louis Martyn, with the insight that there was a law-observant mission to the gentiles. I might add that Brown and Martyn's theses have but uncovered the tip of the iceberg. 5. I have not seen the work of A. Schlatter, Synagogue und Kirche bis zum Bar Kochba- Aufstand. Vier Studien zur Geschichte des Rabbinats und derjidischen Christenheit in der ersten zwei Jahrhundertern (Stuttgart, 1966 [written between 1897 and 1915]), which I understand makes some contribution to the field. For the limited contribution of scholars of rabbinics, see below. 6. G. Strecker, Die Juden-Christentum bei den Pseudo-Klementinen (Berlin, 1958).</page><page sequence="5">PROLEGOMENON TO THE STUDY OF JEWISH-CHRISTIANITIES 51 the Didascalia Apostolorum,7 the Apostolic Constitutions,8 and one must now add the Cologne Mani Codex.9 None of these texts represents a purely Jewish-Christian literature. In each instance internal evidence has led scholars to identify portions of the text as Jewish-Christian. Each of these identifications has, in turn, led to refutations and refinements of the Jewish- Christian thesis.'0 The list offered above is only representative and not by any means complete. Snippets identified as Jewish-Christian literature abound, and it would be useful to have them collated into one volume. Then the difficult work of categorizing and analyzing could take place within the context of other materials. Even so, the work would remain but a tentative classification pending broader investigations. The works of the heresiologists are a fruitful, though obviously biased source of information on Jewish-Christianities. The discovery at Nag Ham- madi of the library which contained so much Gnostic literature offers scholars a good control for methodologies in using the heresiologists for information about given "heretical" sects." To ease the work in classifying information from the heresiologists, one may turn to the useful anthology by Drs. A. F. J. Klijn and G. J. Reinink.'2 In particular one thinks of the reports by Irenaeus, Hippolytus, and Epiphanius which are collected in that volume. Gnostic literature seems to hold some promise for research in Jewish- Christianity primarily because of the Jewish background evident in the already Christian layers. The assumption here is that such literature repre- sents the product or background of a Jewish-Christian community rather than a Gnostic literature which was first Judaized and then Christianized.'3 7.

VISOTZKY Unraveling an already knotty literature is not an enviable task, but it could shed light on certain forms of Jewish-Christianity. Gnosticism has led me to separate the heresiologists from the rest of the church fathers, a practice otherwise to be avoided. All "orthodox" church fathers are heresiologists in some fashion, as, of course, are the heresiolo- gists the epitome of "orthodox fathers." Thus the Klijn-Reinink volume includes fathers who are not particulary concerned with branding heresies, but do so by the way. Among the patristic evidence that must be weighed is Justin's Dialogue with the Jew Trypho, chap. 47, Ignatius of Antioch's letters (Magn. 10:3, Phil. 6:1),14 and those fathers collected by Klijn and Reinink, including Tertullian, Origen, Eusebius, and Jerome. One must also peruse the anti-Jewish sermons of John Chrysostom, particularly 4.3.15 As I suggested above, this material must be viewed in conjunction with archaeological evidence. Unfortunately, such evidence is so difficult to interpret that a find which may be thought by some to be a church may be thought by others to be a specifically Jewish-Christian church. Imagine the debate that ensues when experts are unsure whether a site is a church or a synagogue. Further, the interpretation of funerary monuments with "Chris- tian" motifs but "Jewish" names is a source of debate. Finally, it is not at all clear which motifs are exclusively "Jewish," which exclusively indicative of "Christian," let alone which motifs give evidence of Jewish-Christian arti- facts.'6 Thus the application of archaeological findings must always refer to the original artifacts themselves and not merely to the conclusions of the the Epistle of Ignatius," in Jews, Greeks and Christians... in Honor of W.

I offer only a few examples to illustrate the magnitude of the problem. Most notably one must list the works of W. Ramsay and, more recently, B. Bagatti (see below).

This minimal degree of control will at least militate against egregious errors of judgment or "findings" which will soon be overturned. This segment outlining the church sources necessary for initial consulta- tion in the study of Jewish Christianity is far from comprehensive. It con- tains but the basic bibliography for those interested in intelligently bringing the resources of their own field to bear on the history of Jewish- Christianities, or vice versa. Types ofJewish-Christianities in Christian Literatures The four types of literatures briefly surveyed above offer a significant amount of confusing information about a bewildering variety of Jewish- Christianities. It is not my intention here to order that information into any comprehensive picture of Jewish-Christianities in late antiquity. I should, rather, like to survey the broad categories of information which the litera- tures present, with some examples from each and some comment on the problems they present. This overview will enable those who are not special- ists in Jewish-Christianity to see where they might best apply contributions from their own disciplines. The Jewish-Christian communities are often identified by name. Thus, we know of Ebionites, Nazorenes, Elchesites, Cerinthians, and Symma- chians, among others."7 There is an almost irresistible desire among scholars to equate these groups, to assume that different heresiologists gave different names to the same group, to take groups described but not named and pre- sume these to be those. While the desire to impose order on this variety of names is an understandable occupation of scholarship, it is dangerous. First, one suspects the idea of a monolithic Jewish-Christianity lurking behind the tendency. Second, the equation of two groups which have broadly the same outline in no way guarantees the actual existence of but one group in his- torical reality. Obviously, if groups were Jewish-Christian they had many similarities. Nevertheless, ideology or locale or chronology caused them to be, in fact, disparate communities. Though the existence of different names does not guarantee the existence of different communities, it is the burden of the scholar to prove that only one group existed. Though it is far from tidy, one suspects that the very nature of the Jewish-Christian communities as 17. See Klijn and Reinink for full details.</page><page sequence="8">54 BURTON L. VISOTZKY pariahs from the "Great Church" and "Synagogue" caused considerable fragmentation. When the church gained power and began rooting out "heresies," prudence and safety must have caused the communities to remain small and scattered. The same holds true for the earlier period when Roman or Jewish authorities were the acting powers. Unfortunately for modern scholars, this all but guaranteed a wide variety of theology and praxis. The consequences of this historical necessity were varying locales, theologies, and practices, which will now be surveyed. A variety of centers are suggested as loci for Jewish-Christianity. Epi- phanius (Pan. haer. 29.7) alone lists four: Beroea in Coele-Syria, the Decapolis, Pella, and Kokhaba. Of course, most of the locales that support- ed large Christian communities are suggested as Jewish-Christian centers. So we read reports about the communities of Asia Minor, Palestine (where it all began),'8 Rome (where it all continued),'9 and that most idiosyncratic of all cities in the Levant, Antioch.20 The latter two cities have had their histories exhaustively written and rewritten. Rome is so complex that one is almost tempted to exclude it from research simply because it's just too hard to master. But the mastery of Rome has long been a motif in Jewish and Christian literatures, so one must plunge into the Jewish-Christianities of the city. A look at any recent history will provide an adequate point of departure for literary bibliography on both pagan and Christian sources. One should also consider carefully the evidence of the catacombs, both "Christian" and "Jewish," but with the provisos about archaeology mentioned above.2' Antioch deserves careful consideration thanks to the evidence of both Ignatius and John Chrysostom regarding Judaizing there. First, one must contend with the problem that when Ignatius writes of Jewish-Christianity, 18. For Asia Minor the old works of W. Ramsay, St. Paul the Traveller (New York, 1896) and Cities and Bishoprics of Phrygia (Oxford, 1897), remain useful. See also Barrett, "Jews and Judaisers." For Palestine the most notable, if thoroughly credulous, efforts are by B. Bagatti, The Church from the Gentiles in Palestine (Jerusalem, 1971) and The Church from the Circum- cision (Jerusalem, 1971). 19. E.g., R. E. Brown in Brown and Meier, Antioch and Rome, with the bibliography there. 20.

The material remains require a critical reevaluation in light of Jewish-Christianities.

Goodenough, Jewish Symbols in the Greco-Roman Period, vol. 3 (New York, 1953).</page><page sequence="9">PROLEGOMENON TO THE STUDY OF JEWISH-CHRISTIANITIES 55 he is writing to communities in Asia Minor and not, at first blush, speaking about Antioch.22 Second, and more pressing, is whether or not Ignatius speaks of Jewish-Christianity at all. This depends in large part on one's defi- nition of Jewish-Christianity and its relationship to Judaizing. These issues are discussed below. John Chrysostom speaks clearly about the situation in his own church in Antioch. Again, one must decide whether the Judaizers whom he excoriates are to be counted as Jewish-Christians. Despite the possible lack of evidence from these two main Christian sources on Antioch, most historians of the city write about the Jewish-Christianity there. I suspect that this is a wise course, if for no other reason than the probabilities of demography in anti- quity.23 Theologies also varied widely among the Jewish-Christian communities. There were those who no doubt merely professed Christ as Messiah. Others were ready to admit of Jesus as Son of God (see the reports in Jerome and Epiphanius). One can be sure that the complexities of Jewish-Christian Christology extended into the higher realms as well, with some communities professing Jesus as God. The last profession necessitated at minimum a kind of dualistic theology, and one presumes that in the theological whirlwind of the fourth century there were some forms of Trinitarian communities, too. Other aspects of the Christology of some Jewish-Christians are known. Jerome reports communities who professed that Jesus was born of the vir- gin, suffered the passion, and was resurrected. Available evidence does not tell us much about the cosmologies of Jewish-Christians (unless the Gnostic literatures on this subject are considered Jewish-Christian) or other theo- logical considerations. Given the extraordinary range of theological debate in the church from the second through the fifth century, this lack of infor- mation is perhaps surprising, but comes as somewhat of a relief. Extra infor- mation on theology would provide the temptation of aligning Jewish- 22. See particularly Barrett, "Jews and Judaisers."

The state of Jewish- Christian studies is not ready for such a lure to misadventure. More than two decades ago Marcel Simon commented on the impor- tance of observances in defining Jewish-Christianities.24 Particularly in light of Rabbinic Judaism's emphasis on law observance, this area requires much more attention than Simon's suggestions have attracted. First, one must consider varieties of law observance; the "Jewish" side, if you will, of Jewish-Christianities. Foremost among these observances is circumcision. Since New Testament times this has been the subject of active debate in Christian communities. Since there were even rabbinic Jews prepared to forgo the requirement of circumcision,25 one must at least speculate on the possibility of Jewish-Christian communities in which circumcision was not one of the required observances. Obviously, there were communities which did require circumcision. One wonders, however, how firmly they clung to this requirement in light of Roman (and later Roman-Christian) legislation against the practice. Another requirement of law-observant Jewish communities was ritual immersion (as distinct from Christian baptism). This demanded a ritual immersion pool (mikvah) holding a given amount of "living," that is, flow- ing, water (for Rabbinic Judaism, 40 seahs). The mikvah was probably used for conversion rituals for both men and women. It was also used, in Rab- binic Judaism and at Qumran, for restoring ritual fitness (taharah). Literary evidence offers very little about the use of the mikvah in Jewish- Christianity, but archaeological data may yield information. They will only do so, however, when the possibility of mikvah among Jewish-Christians is included in the interpretation of sites (i.e., a mikvah on a site does not auto- matically make it a Jewish site, nor does an immersion pool in a church automatically have to be a baptismal font). Eating customs varied widely in antiquity, even among Jewish communi- ties. Thus it is possible that some followed the biblical dietary laws but nevertheless transgressed the rabbinic laws of kashrut. The sectarians of Qumran had their own ways of eating. Acts 15 offers a series of food laws 24. Simon, "Problemes du Judeo-Christianisme" (see n. 1). 25. See the texts adduced in L. Schiffman, "At the Crossroads: Tannaitic Perspectives on the Jewish-Christian Schism," in Jewish and Christian Self-Definition (Philadelphia, 1981), 2:115-156, and idem, Who Was a Jew? (Hoboken, 1985).

The Cologne Mani Codex evidences vegetarianism. In the rabbinic communities, great care was taken regarding table fellow- ship, so that hiaverim would not eat with others. Since table companions formed small communities, Jewish-Christian communities may be distin- guished from one another based on their eating customs. Christian literature offers us very little information about the general eating habits of Jewish- Christians. Jerome and Epiphanius refer to the Sabbath and festival observances of the Jewish-Christian communities they describe. Do they refer only to a Saturday Sabbath rather than Sunday, or are there specific observances attached? Do some Jewish-Christian groups refrain from labor on the Sab- bath? If so, do they refrain from the same labors as rabbinic Jews? Qum- ranites? Pagan authors observed the Jewish custom of Sabbath candle- lighting.26 Did Jewish-Christians share this practice? It seems the Jewish- Christians frequented the Temple when it stood;27 did synagogue attendance become the norm following 70?28 Both pagan and Christian authors attest to a variety of Jewish fasts, some on the Sabbath. While the latter are usually dismissed as mispercep- tions, the question is by no means closed. Rabbinic Judaism knows of Sab- bath fasting (e.g., b.Taanit 12b, where it is permitted to fast on the Sabbath to avert the effects of a bad dream); why must uninformed pagan minds necessarily err? Like small children, they may well report accurately the mysteries they observe. Were any of the Jewish-Christian communities partners to these fasts? Jerome also writes of offering sacrifices. Here, too, the literary evidence is dismissed out of hand-after 70 there could not have been sacrifice. Why not? There is rabbinic evidence showing a serious concern about sacrificing after the Temple's destruction.29 Perhaps the Jewish-Christian communities of whom Jerome speaks took the levitical prescriptions requiring sacrifice seriously enough to ignore or reinterpret the deuteronomic prohibitions against sacrifice outside of the Jerusalem Temple. The Qumran community 26. See M. Stern, Pagan Authors on Jews and Judaism (Jerusalem, 1974), 1:422, 436. 27. See Brown, "Not Jewish Christianity." 28. John Chrysostom writes about his Judaizers going to the synagogues to hear the shofar blowing, take oaths, and the like. His Judaizers also attended the shrine of Matrona(?). 29.

VISOTZKY might also offer archaeological evidence for such non-Temple sacrifices. Last on the list of suggested "Jewish" observances to be considered in the study of Jewish-Christianities is clothing. There is ample evidence that a variety of garments distinguished Jews from non-Jews. First were the bibli- cally enjoined phylacteries and fringes. There is New Testament and archaeological evidence for the former. But there are other dress elements which also distinguished Jews. Art shows us a gamma pattern woven into Jewish clothing. This was later adopted by the Great Church and persists today in the altar cloth. Did Jewish-Christians adorn themselves with gamma cloth? Were they the means by which the pattern came to the church? Finally, the rabbis seem to have carried a wallet and worn a mantle (see, e.g., m.RH 2:9), as did members of the philosophic schools. Did any Jewish-Christians consider themselves sufficiently aligned to philosophy (as did the Great Church) that they might have adopted this special garb as well? After consideration of this dizzying array of practices (which are but a sampling of possible Jewish observances that the Jewish-Christians may have shared), one must also look to their "Christian" rituals. Again, a brief listing of practices which marked distinctions in church communities must suffice. The obvious place to start asking questions about "church" ritual in Jewish-Christianities is at the baptismal font. Was baptism required for "conversion"? Was it accomplished by total immersion, or did aspersion suffice? When were Jewish-Christians baptized-at birth, at the age of reason, or perhaps on the deathbed? Was there but one baptism, or could there be further baptisms for impurities of one sort or another, like mikvah? If baptism was not like mikvah, one still must ask about the possibility of a second baptism following the custom of exhomologesis. Finally, one may inquire about the role of chrism in Jewish-Christian forms of baptism. Water also raises the issue of types of eucharist, since there is evidence that some communities performed the sacrament with water in place of wine.30 Water generates many questions and must suffice for the present as a guide to investigating types of "church" ritual in Jewish-Christian communities. Rituals such as baptism and circumcision lead one to considerations about the demographic makeup of the varying Jewish-Christian communi- 30. See, e.g., Acts of Thomas 120 (Edgar Hennecke, New Testament Apocrypha, edited by W. Schneemelcher [Philadelphia, 1965], 2:507 and see p. 438), and Irenaeus, Adv. haer, V. 1, 3 (see Klijn and Reinink, Patristic Evidence for Jewish Christian Sects, p. 72, n. 4).</page><page sequence="13">PROLEGOMENON TO THE STUDY OF JEWISH-CHRISTIANITIES 59 ties. I suspect that the simplest way to approach this very complicated issue of prosopography is by inquiring about the parentage of members of these groups. Were they law-observant Jews? Law-observant Christians (I am not clear whether this necessarily means they were Jewish-Christians, it depends upon defining the term)? Perhaps the parents were non-law-observant Jews (there must have been a substantial number in every big city with a Jewish population). Of course, the parents could have been Christians from the law-free church, or pagans. The Jewish-Christian communities may have required differing levels of observance from those of varying parentage. Thus, a Jewish-Christian com- ing from a law-observant Jewish family might have been required to remain law-observant, while a Jewish-Christian coming from a pagan back- ground might only have had the requirements of Acts 15 laid upon him-we do not know. That varying degrees of ritual observance may have been enjoined upon members of the same community, depending upon their ori- gins, must be admitted as a possibility. Unfortunately, this possibility exacerbates an already difficult situation if one was intending to sort out varieties of Jewish-Christianity by means of their observances. One last issue must be considered in this section about types of Jewish- Christianities, and that is the relations of each of these groups with other Christian communities (the Jewish ones are discussed below). Here, chro- nology surfaces as a vexing problem which has otherwise remained lurking beneath the study of Jewish-Christianities. In the beginning, all Christians were Jewish-Christians. Later, but still during the New Testament era, the Jewish-Christians were generally identified with the Jerusalem com- munity.3' Still later, Eusebius moved the Jewish-Christian community to Pella, and somewhat later than that, they moved themselves.32 Of course, this movement of Jewish-Christianity was not simply a linear progression of one community, as R. E. Brown and J. L. Martyn have shown. But their works have only opened the door to understanding the varieties of Jewish- Christianity extant in the first century. On the other side of the time line, we find Jewish-Christians and 31. See Brown, "Not Jewish Christianity." 32. See G. Lidemann, "The Successors of Pre-70 Jerusalem Christianity: A Critical Evaluation of the Pella-Tradition," in E. P. Sanders, ed., Jewish and Christian Self-Definition (Philadelphia, 1980), 1:161-173; and cf. M. Simon, "La migration A Pella: legende ou realite?"

VISOTZKY Judaizers flourishing in the fourth and fifth centuries (so, e.g., in the reports of Jerome, Epiphanius, and John Chrysostom). While we have more infor- mation about these groups, we also remain far from writing the authorita- tive history of Jewish-Christianities in that period. As for the middle ground-the second and third centuries-not only does it remain obscure for the history of Jewish-Christianities, but it raises the question of conti- nuity between the New Testament Jewish-Christians and those described by the later church fathers.33 The question of continuity, of "apostlicity," if you will, affects the rela- tionships of these Jewish-Christian churches with others. If a Jewish- Christian community could claim direct lineage with, say, the community of James, brother of Jesus, another church would be hard-pressed to excom- municate them without first refuting the claim. Even without direct con- tinuity, churches were sensitive enough to varieties of practice and theology to recognize some legitimacy in Jewish-Christian claims. Nevertheless, the theological necessities of the law-free church forced them to take a rigid rather than assimilative stance toward law-observant Christian communi- ties. Hence in attempting to define the parameters of such a community, one must inquire into the relationship of any Jewish-Christian sect with the "Great Church," the Eastern churches (e.g., the Marcionites, those described by Bauer in the first chapter of Orthodoxy and Heresy, and those behind the Cologne Mani Codex), and other Christian communities. Problems of Perception I have consistently noted that one of the chief problems in the study of Jewish-Christianities is, quite simply, defining the parameters of the disci- pline. While it is true that such definition is a concern of virtually every scholarly discipline, it is acute in the study of Jewish-Christianities. First, there is no broad consensus of definition about the terminology.34 Second, the evidence we have is fragmentary. For although the church fathers do write about Jewish-Christianities, and the rabbis seem to as well, the overall corpus of their own literature has been denied to us through the combined 33. E.g., J. Munck, "Primitive Jewish Christianity and Later Jewish Christianity: Con- tinuation or Rupture?" in Aspects du Judeo-Christianisme, pp. 77-93. Munck favors rupture. 34. See above, n. 1.</page><page sequence="15">PROLEGOMENON TO THE STUDY OF JEWISH-CHRISTIANITIES 61 efforts of censorship and the ravages of time. Third, the problem is acute because of the need to address the many issues already outlined above. I wish to address the first issue here, the problem of definition. Aside from the obvious kinds of quibbling that scholars engage in when marking out the borders of their disciplines and attempting to justify encroachment on their colleagues' preserves by claiming a need for intellectual Lebens- raum, the study of Jewish-Christianities carries with it four other problems in definition. The first relates to the general issues of Jewish and Christian self-definition.35 As I have indicated by my separation of theology and observance above, there are varying ways of approaching Jewish- Christianity. One must recognize that each of the ways carries with it reli- gious overtones. Approaching Jewish-Christianity as a system or systems of beliefs is to approach the subject from an essentially Great Church Christian point of view. Similarly, approaching Jewish-Christianities by the obser- vances they practice is to approach them from a Jewish Weltanschauung.36 An attempt at synthesizing these two modes of approach may not only well serve the study of Jewish-Christianity, but may also have the happy side effect of mitigating the religious biases of those studying it.37 The next aspect of the problem of perception relates to the overall influence of Judaism on Christianity.38 It cannot be denied that Judaism had an immense formative influence on Christianity and that its influence con- tinued, though radically curtailed, throughout the patristic period. I speak here of Great Church Christianity (whatever that may be), with full aware- ness of the profound effects paganism, philosophy, and other aspects of Hellenism had in drawing the church away from the synagogue. This being the case, however, merely identifying Jewish elements, even rabbinic ele- ments, in Christian texts does not prove them Jewish-Christian in origin. A clear definition of Jewish-Christianity must overcome the enormous diffi- culty this problem poses in sorting out the origins and sources of any given community's (or text's) traditions. The third issue of definition relates to drawing borders in very difficult territory. When is a Christian a Jewish-Christian and not merely a Judaizer? 35. E. P. Sanders and his colleagues at MacMaster University have edited three notable volumes on the overall subject, called Jewish and Christian Self-Definition. None of the chapters deals with this specific aspect of the problem. 36. Simon, "Problems du Judeo-Christianisme," pp. 1-17. 37. See below. 38.

I have suggested above that this may not be a hard-and-fast requirement for Jewish-Christianity (or Rabbinic Judaism). Need he merely profess Christ? If so, and if he is a law-observer, when does he cease to be a Jew with odd notions about Jesus and become, instead, a Jewish-Christian?39 Does it depend on his Christology? I have suggested above that there are equally low and high Christologies to be found in the Jewish-Christian communities of antiquity. What, also, of the God-fearers, those semi-proselytes who were fellow travelers of the Jewish communities and were proselytized by the church?40 In what category of Christianity, Judaism, or Jewish-Christianity will they be classified? A final issue in the perception and definition of Jewish-Christianities lies in the biases of the observers. Among Christian scholars there are two ten- dencies which skew analyses. The first, which is very much in line with clas- sical pre-Vatican II church theology, assumes that all Jews must ultimately become Christians. Thus Jewish-Christianity is to be understood as a step- ping stone in the "evolution" of Judaism to Christianity. Scholars with this view evince no sympathy for Jewish-Christianity as an authentic religious phenomenon. The second tendency is related, and it presumes Jewish- Christianity to be an aberrant form of "real" Christianity, much as did the heresiologists. Almost all writers before Walter Bauer exhibited this ten- dency, and many still subscribe to its views. Again, it does not elicit either objective or sympathetic analysis of a religion in late antiquity. Jewish scholars have a somewhat different set of biases when treating Jewish-Christianity. The first bias presumes it to be merely a Christian heresy, wholly unrelated to Judaism. This attitude causes scholars to over- look the evidence of Jewish-Christianity in rabbinic literature in particular. The second bias also refuses to offer integrity to Jewish-Christianity and treats it as merely a Jewish heresy. This bias results in an ecumenically more dangerous approach. It assumes that since the Jewish-Christians are really "Jews" and not "Christians," certain rabbinic polemics may be character- ized as anti-Jewish-Christian and thus presented as a "family argument" of 39. These questions particularly affect one's views on Ignatius' and Chrysostom's "Judaizers" in Antioch. 40. Kraabel, "Disappearance of the God-Fearers," pp. 113 ff., tries very hard to make them disappear. He ignores substantial rabbinic evidence to do this and has been recently con- futed by epigraphic evidence; see n. 16 above.</page><page sequence="17">PROLEGOMENON TO THE STUDY OF JEWISH-CHRISTIANITIES 63 antiquity.4' The assertion that such polemics are in no way anti-Christian ignores not only the authenticity of Jewish-Christianity as a religious phenomenon, but the sensitivities of modern Christians as well. The issues surveyed thus far, and particularly the last set of biases dis- cussed, prepare us to enter a specific discipline and survey its potential for a contribution to the study of Jewish-Christianities. The survey is in no way exhaustive. It is rather, as indicated at the outset of this essay, merely a chart for navigating the confluence of the two bodies of religious literature. Jewish-Christianity in Rabbinic Literature Only recently have scholars of rabbinic literature begun actively con- sidering Jewish-Christians as possible targets of rabbinic polemic. Previous- ly, the assumption had been that such passages were directed against Chris- tians without any niceties of distinction.42 More recently, for the apologetic reasons cited above, the pendulum has swung to the other extreme, citing only Jewish-Christians and virtually eliminating Great Church Christians as the objects of rabbinic polemic. A middle ground must be steered, especially on the polemical materials, since the texts themselves attest to rabbinic awareness of both types of Christianities.43 Nonpolemical texts also offer testimonies to both Christianity and Jewish-Christianities. In both sets of rabbinic materials (often hard to distinguish from one another) there are a wide variety of problems for the student to overcome. Primary among these is chronology. Rabbinic materi- al includes more than a millennium of literature produced in many centers. Even the classical talmudic phase of rabbinic literature covers more than four centuries (ca. 70-500) and two major locales (Palestine and Babylonia). Despite repeated warnings, especially on the part of New Testament scho- lars, problems in rabbinic chronology remain largely ignored. It is not at all 41. See R. Kimelman, "Birkat Ha-Minim and the Lack of Evidence for an Anti-Christian Jewish Prayer in Late Antiquity," in Jewish and Christian Self-Definition, vol. 2 (London, 1981), pp. 226-244. 42. This is betrayed in the titles, if not always the content, of books on the subject, e.g., R. T. Herford, Christianity in Talmud and Midrash (London, 1903). 43. See, e.g., my "Overturning the Lamp," Journal of Jewish Studies 38 (1987): 72-80 and "Trinitarian Testimonies," USQR, 42 (1988): 73-85.</page><page sequence="18">64 BURTON L. VISOTZKY unusual to see eighth- through eleventh-century documents cited as sources for second- through fifth-century history. These anachronisms are perpe- tuated by Jewish and Christian scholars alike. A concomitant to this problem is the fact that technical terminology does not remain static in the literature. Thus a term may mean one thing in tannaitic times (ca. 70-200) and quite another in amoraic literature (ca. 200-500). Or a term may mean one thing in Babylonia and another in Pales- tine. Worse, there are variations in technical terms even among the different schools in a given country (e.g., the "schools" of Akiba and Yishmael in second-century Palestine). Again, what may be a very specific term for one sage may mean something else entirely to another. Finally, certain sages seem to purposely embrace ambiguity and obfuscate their meanings (per- haps because of delators) in their choice of multivalent terminology. This is especially true in the polemical literature. Having offered this pessimistic assessment for the possibilities of making any sense whatsoever out of rabbinic literature, let me list seven terms that are most popularly taken to have some bearing on the study of Jewish- Christianities. Chief among them is min, a rabbinic catchall which translates simply as "sectarian." The term abounds in the literature and refers, one suspects, to everything from Christian to Jewish-Christian to Qumranite, Zadokite, and later, even Karaite. Since the time of Jerome (Ep. 112.13), attempts to define this term have been doomed to failure because of its pur- posely broad lexical range.44 Nevertheless, one may be sure that among the minim one will find some Jewish-Christians. Another popular rubric is notsri, which is variously etymologized as referring to Nazareth, nazirites, or the shoot (netser) of the Davidic monarchy who will sprout forth as the messiah. These "heretics" are often identified with the Nazorenes (or Nazarenes) listed in Christian literature and discussed above. 45 They may be Jewish-Christians, they may be Great Church Christians; I, for one, do not know. I suspect we cannot resolve the issue any more definitely here than we may for the minim because of the many reasons already suggested. A third term often found in rabbinic literature is nokhrim, which means 44. Thus the simple definitions offered by Schiffman (above, n. 25) and Kimelman (above, n. 41) cannot stand; but see their notes for full bibliography on attempts to limit the scope of the term. 45. See Kimelman, "Birkat Ha-Minim."</page><page sequence="19">PROLEGOMENON TO THE STUDY OF JEWISH-CHRISTIANITIES 65 "strangers." It is euphemistic and so the antecedent is somewhat unclear. Again, as with the previous terms, it seems to refer to both types of Chris- tians. Here the problem is more acute, for it may also suggest Roman pagans. Two other words refer to converts from Judaism to other religions-usually to Christianity or Jewish-Christianity. The first, mumar, refers to one who has changed his ideology; the second, meshumad, to one who has been baptized.46 Each of these two terms is very suggestive for the study of Jewish-Christianities, since the rabbis were reluctant to admit that one born a Jew could convert away from Judaism. This would be especially true when such a one might still have been law-observant to some degree. A separate category to be considered in the study of Jewish-Christianity is made up of those who subscribed to the notion of two Powers in heaven. This term implies a dualism which may well have been found in the theolo- gies of some Jewish-Christian sects. I would in no way, however, limit the meaning of this term to Jewish-Christians alone. Rabbinic terminology of this type is far too fluid to be limited to merely one or two specific sects exclusively.47 The last item I wish to attend to here is really two separate terms, each of was substituted by censors over the centuries, in place of original terms which referred to Christianity and Jewish-Christianity. Thus passages which contain references to 'akum (an acronym for 'ovdei kokhavim umazalot, "constellation worshippers") might refer to idol worship. On the other hand, they may well refer to the Christianities being considered. Reference to manuscripts, particularly Sephardic ones not written in regions domi- nated by Christianity, usually restores the original reading. The same holds true of the other term often substituted by zealous censors, vaduqim ("Zado- kites" or "Sadducees"). In both instances, context is often the best clue for finding a Christian or Jewish-Christian hiding behind a "new" reading. Rabbinic literature recognizes the existence of Jews who did not live under rabbinic discipline. There are a large number of references to 'amei 'ares, hoi polloi who have some affinity for rabbinic halacha, yet are not as strict about it as haberim.48 The rabbis also recognize other groups of law- 46. See Schiffman, Who Was a Jew? 47. Alan Segal, Two Powers in Heaven (Leiden, 1977), collects all of the rabbinic passages with this phrase. 48. See A. Oppenheimer, The Am Ha-Aretz (Leiden, 1977).</page><page sequence="20">66 BURTON L. VISOTZKY observant Jews, particularly pre-70 sectarians. Hence there are references to Sadducees, Haemerobaptists, and other separatists.49 More important to the study of Jewish-Christianities, especially in light of the considerations adduced above, are rabbinic references to semi- proselytes, God-fearers, and others of unsure status in the rabbinic com- munity. In addition to the sebomenoi and theobomenoi of Greek literature, the rabbis speak of yer'ei shamayim ("fearers of Heaven"). These fellow- travelers with the Jewish community constituted a class by themselves, fre- quently discussed in the literature. They are often considered with proselytes of dubious status, such as the gerei 'arayot (usually translated as "lion proselytes").50 Obviously, they are a fertile ground for Jewish-Christianity, both for the ancient missionizer and the modern scholar. The Ten Tribes Investigating evidence of semi-proselytes and the like in rabbinic litera- ture is no simple matter. As Prof. Saul Lieberman points out, It is very probable that the people employed different names for the various groups of semi-converts, but in the comparatively scarce material on them, clear evidence of such distinct definitions is not forthcoming. However, it is possible that remnants of these different terms have been preserved in Talmu- dic literature.5 Indeed, among the many terms listed above for "heretics" and other not quite up to par rabbinic Jews, one often finds another slippery, multivalent expression: the Ten Tribes ('aseret hashevatim). I wish to suggest here that this term be added to the list of those others which might bear fruit for the study of Jewish-Christianities in rabbinic literature. 49. S. Lieberman, "The Discipline of the So-Called Dead Sea Manual of Discipline," Texts and Studies (New York, 1974), pp. 200-207.

Of course, the rabbis often refer simply to the Ten Tribes of the Bible (1 Kings 11:31, 35) and their historic disappearance. But sometimes one must wonder if they are entirely assimilated in the sages' eyes. Rav Yehuda quoted the Babylo- nian Ray Asi, "We worry nowadays about the marriage of a gentile, lest he be from the Ten Tribes."52 If the good rabbi is worrying about a descendant of the long-lost tribes, one can only marvel at the tenacious way Babylo- nians hold on to the memory of their ancestors. But perhaps the reference to the Ten Tribes indicates an interest in a much more contemporary pheno- menon: Jewish converts to law-observant Jewish-Christianity. This may explain both the rabbis' inability to happily categorize them and the fact that they are often classified with semi-converts and non-Jews.53 Thus, Leviticus Rabbah comments on Psalm 22:24, Ye that fear God praise Him, all ye the seed of Jacob glorify Him. R. Yehoshua b. Levi said, Ye that fear God refers to the fearers of Heaven. R. Samuel b. Nahman said, It refers to full proselytes. R. Abbahu said in the name of R. Eleazar, If [fearers of Heaven are considered as] full proselytes [and] will be admitted in the Future World, Antoninus will come at the head of them. And what is implied by All ye the seed of Jacob glorify Him? It refers to the Ten Tribes.54 A much later midrash preserves yet another tradition linking the Ten Tribes with partial converts, "Sheep (Gen. 32:5) refers to the Ten Tribes... and menservants and maidservants (ibid.) refers to the fearers of Heaven."'"55 The Palestinian Talmud, discussing a parallel passage to the midrash extracted above, comments: R. Lazar and R. Yehuda [disagreed]. One said, They [the Ten Tribes] were not exiled until they became uncircumcised. The other said, They were not exiled 52. See b.Yebam 16a-17a and b.Nidda 56b. 53. E.g., b.Yebam 17a, where Samuel considers the Ten Tribes to be entirely non-Jewish; the pericope goes on to consider Samaritans, who are deemed either true proselytes (gerei 'emet) or dubious ones (gerei 'arayot). 54. LevR 3:2, following the interpretation of Lieberman, Greek in Jewish Palestine, pp. 82f. Cf. j.San 29c. 55. Sekhel Tov to Gen 32:5 (ed. Buber, 181).

VISOTZKY until they became mamzerim. The one who said uncircumcised [meant that they were so in regard to actual] circumcision [and in regard to observance of] the commandments. The one who said mamzerim [meant that they were estranged] from their ancestors. R. Yohanan said, The Israelites were not exiled until they had become twenty-four sects of heretics (minim).56 The discussion seems to offer intriguing information about the Ten Tribes. There is some disagreement as to their practice of circumcision and obser- vance of commandments. There is the clear opinion that they are not fit to marry rabbinic Jews but are still considered Israelites nevertheless-for that is what it meant to be a mamzer.57 Finally, the editor of the Talmud classifies them with minim by juxtaposition of rabbinic opinions. In the rabbinic liter- ature surveyed thus far, the Ten Tribes are associated with God-fearers, and dubious converts. There is a question about their circumcision and obser- vance of Jewish law. They are considered by at least one rabbi to be Jews but unfit to marry within the community. The locales of these communities of Ten Tribes are often listed in rab- binic texts when tracing the exile of the biblical lost tribes. The same passage of the Palestinian Talmud reports: "Israel [viz., The Ten Tribes] was exiled to three places. First, beyond the River Sanbatyon. Second, to Daphne of Antioch; and third, the Cloud [of Glory] descended and covered them."58 Yet another midrash locates the Ten Tribes in Antioch, as Leviticus Rabbah comments on Amos 6: Ah, you who are at ease in Zion refers to the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. And confident on the hill of Samaria, this refers to the Ten Tribes. .. . Cross over to Calneh and see refers to Ktesiphon. Go from there to great Hamath refers to hamat of Antioch. And go down to Gath of the Philistines-that is the fortresses of Palestine.59 Asia Minor is offered as a possible locale in the curious statement of R. Helbo, "The wine of Phrygia and the waters of Emmaus (or: Demosit) did in 56. j.San 29c. 57. See Schiffman, Who Was a Jew? 58. j.San 29c and LamR 2:9, GenR 73:6, PesRabbati 31. Cf.

LevR 5:3 and YalSh Amos #545.</page><page sequence="23">PROLEGOMENON TO THE STUDY OF JEWISH-CHRISTIANITIES 69 the Ten Tribes."60 The juxtaposition of sacramental wine and water is also suggestive of Jewish-Christian or Christian referents for the term, Ten Tribes, used here. The rabbis puzzled over the ultimate fate of the Ten Tribes. If the term does refer to law-observant Jewish-Christian converts from Judaism, one readily understands the rabbis' reluctance to give up on them entirely. As explained above, such observant Jews could be viewed as within the broad pale of rabbinic Judaism-the rabbis were loath to lose even one Jew of their number, no matter what they thought about Jesus. Yet others (like R. Samuel cited in n. 53) considered them lost to Judaism-they were Chris- tians through and through. This ambiguity might explain a debate found in the chapter of Mishna which begins "All Israel have a place in the world to come," and then goes on to list the twenty exceptions to the rule. The Ten Tribes will not return [=repent] in the future, as it is said, And [God] cast them into another land, as this day (Deut. 29:27). Just as the day goes and does not return, so they have gone and will not return; this is the opinion of R. Akiba. R. Eliezer says, As this day, just as a day begins in darkness and grows light, so too the Ten Tribes who are now in darkness will have light in the future.6' If the term Ten Tribes is one of the ambiguous code words used in rabbinic literature, it offers rich possibilities for further research in Jewish- Christianities. I would suggest that the term is a rabbinic response to the Christian claims of being verus Israel. The various Jewish-Christian churches claimed to be the true Israel and referred to themselves as the Twelve Tribes.62 The rabbis, whatever they may have thought about the ulti- mate fate of these Jewish-Christians, denigrated this claim. Only rabbinic Jews were the true Israel, the faithful remnant of Benjamin and Judah. As for the Jewish-Christian pretenders, the rabbis dismissed them as "lost." Some denied them even a share in the world-to-come. Yet by virtue of their 60. b.Shab 147b; cf. ARN A 14, ARN B 29, and LevR 5:3.

Conclusion The inclusion of the phrase Ten Tribes with the other rabbinic terms of reference discussed above completes this survey. Rabbinics scholars will, no doubt, have many details to add to my sketch of the field and its potential for the study of Jewish-Christianities. On the other hand, church historians will wish to fill many noticeable lacunae in my overview of nonrabbinic materials. My intention was neither to be comprehensive nor complete- others far more competent than I will spend years completing the task. The purpose of this prolegomenon has been to offer those in other disci- plines a guide to the eddies and swirls one encounters in the study of Jewish- Christianities. This navigational report of my attempts to steer a course is meant to help other students chart their own routes. Jewish-Christianities is a subject which falls outside of the traditionally defined parameters in the study of Judaism and Christianity. Only when scholars in all of the atten- dant disciplines combine their expertise can the subject be adequately illuminated. Jewish Theological Seminary New York</page></plain_text>
