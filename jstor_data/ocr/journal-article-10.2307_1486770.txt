London: Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 1997. xvi, 380 pp. Yom Tov Assis. Jewish Economy in the Medieval Crown of Aragon, 1213-1327: Money and Power. Brill's Series in Jewish Studies, vol. 18. Leiden: Brill, 1997. xii, 261 pp. The Jews of the Crown of Aragon bequeathed to posterity a tremendous documentary record, and for this generosity their historiography continues to pay a price. Overwhelmed by the richness of the sources, no one since Yitzhak Baer at mid-century has dared to attempt a synthesis of Jewish historical experience in the Crown of Aragon, each scholar preferring instead patiently to tend his own small patch of earth. The result has been less a field than a community garden, with some subjects intensively cultivated, others neglected, and little order to orient those students who tend to hover at a prudent height above detail. In The Golden Age of Aragonese Jewry, Yom Tov Assis risks an aerial view of a part of this field, and the scene is a breathtaking one indeed. Within its stated chronological and geographical boundaries the book is meant to be comprehensive, and it draws upon a wide array of sources too often found apart: romance and Latin notarial, legal, and royal records, Hebrew responsa, halakhic and religious texts. There can be little doubt that Professor Assis is well prepared for the magnitude of the task. Even before the defense of his dissertation in 1981 he had edited and republished Jean Regn6's summary of the documentation in the archive of the Crown of Aragon concerning Jews in the period between 1213 and 1327.' Since then he has written articles on 1. See Jean RMgn6, History of the Jews in Aragon: Regesta and Documents, 1213-1327, Hispania Judaica, vol. 1 (Jerusalem, 1978). Assis's dissertation, "The Jews of Aragon under James II, 1291-1327," defended at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem under the direction of Haim Beinart.</page><page sequence="2">392 BOOK REVIEWS many aspects of Jewish life in the Crown. Assis's overview is therefore built upon a mountain of research. The book begins by examining Jewish legal status in the Crown, an examination which focuses on relations between the Jews and the monarchy. Assis underscores repeatedly both the monarchy's dependence on Jews for financial and (until 1284) administrative support, and the self-interested, rather than principled, protection and privileges that the monarchy offered the Jews in return. Both here and in Jewish Economy, Assis's careful documentation of the fiscal importance Jews had for the monarchy provides the strategic backdrop for the gradual erosion of Jewish status that Assis believes was occurring throughout the latter part of the period covered by his work, an erosion he sees arising from the increasing aggression and intolerance of the Church throughout the thirteenth century. This emphasis on the role financial pressure played in conditioning the Jewish experience in the Crown allows him to avoid idealizations (like convivencia), and tempers any romanticism about a "golden age." Following this initial section setting the Jews within the wider political framework, Assis turns to one of his primary interests, the analysis of Jewish self-government. For Assis, the community, or qehilah, provided the basic framework for Jewish life, and was "a source of spiritual strength and comfort." It was also "an organic structure that must be reviewed in its totality" (pp. 67-68). One need not understand what Assis means by "organic" in order to appreciate his encyclopedic treatment of Jewish self-government and the stresses and changes it underwent in the late thirteenth century. Based on extensive reading in the responsa literature (particularly that of Solomon ben Adret), he provides a clear exposition of the Jewish "political theory" and the financial structures underpinning communal autonomy. Throughout, the analysis of communal organization is placed within the overarching Christian context: "the structure of Jewish society was almost an exact duplicate of Christian urban society" (p. 69). At times, Assis appears to have an overly optimistic view of the inclu- siveness of Jewish self-government, as when he claims that the reforms of the early fourteenth century "ensured representation for all classes in the communal government" (p. 73). In general, however, he is very much on the qui vive for signs of class tension, internal faction, oligarchy, and repression. It is within such contexts that he analyzes communal administration and the distribution of power in Jewish communities. Many scholars will appreciate</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 393 the catalogue of officeholders he provides, with complete descriptions of their roles in political, economic, judicial, and religious administration. The same gratitude will be felt by readers of sections 3 and 4, which respectively treat relations between Jewish communities and the organization of the Jewish quarter. Section 3 provides a clear exposition of regional organization and particularly of that curious fiscal/political organization called the Collecta, a structure by which the largest aljamas dominated smaller Jewish settlements in their hinterlands and administered their tax burden. He also treats the representative assemblies that brought together delegates from all the communities of a given realm, and contextualizes the role of such assemblies in the different situations in each of the three polities with which he is concerned (Aragon, Catalonia, and Valencia). Section 4 provides something of a sociohistorical tour through the constructed environment of fourteenth-century Jewish ritual life, with discussions of synagogues, kasher meat markets, ritual baths, bakeries, and cemeteries. The section also addresses, albeit obliquely, the important issue of segregation. Jewish quarters were often not exclusively Jewish, nor Christian quarters exclusively Christian, but Jews often preferred to concentrate their habitation within defendable perimeters (i.e., walls or castles), and Christian municipalities sometimes lobbied to move or restrict the Jewish quarter in order to achieve more complete segregation. This is valuable material, although Assis himself does not explore the broader issue of how Jewish-Christian relations affected the shape of the urban space available to Jews, an increasingly pressing problem throughout the middle decades of the fourteenth century. Like the preceding sections, the concluding two ("Jewish Society" and "Religious Life") are organized by topic. The chapter on family life, for example, includes sections on courtship, marriage, dowry, bigamy, incest, concubinage, adultery, and divorce. Such a structure will be appreciated by the many readers who will undoubtedly turn to the book as a reference work, but it does impose some costs: issues are often treated in comparative isolation, and any overarching narrative or analytical voice is obscured. The first of these problems, that of isolation, is writ large in the apparent autonomy the author grants to the Jewish community as an object of study. Repeatedly Assis warns us that the Jewish communities of Spain were more open to Christian influence than any other in medieval Europe, that Jewish communal organization widely imitated Christian municipal models, and even that "concubinage among Jews in the Aragonese realm was the outcome of a strong non-Jewish social influence" (pp. 267, 288). Yet, apart from the initial</page><page sequence="4">394 BOOK REVIEWS pages dedicated to the effect of royal financial interests upon Jewish political structure, the book rarely addresses the Christian context, or the cultural processes by which it may have influenced Jewish society. The author makes minimal gestures in this direction, as when he cites two textbooks from the 1970s as his only sources on Christian urban life in Catalonia-Aragon (p. 288). Further, the emphasis on the royal perspective, while invaluable, could have been enriched by a more extensive treatment of nonroyal (i.e., municipal, nobiliary, mercantile, and "popular") attitudes, which were also important in shaping Jewish experience. Assis does pay some attention to clerical opinions, but his treatment may seem to some readers insufficiently complex. The second issue is not in and of itself problematic: with or without an overarching narrative, Assis's volume is a magnificently organized synthesis that will benefit all researchers on the topic. At times, however, it seems as if a slightly apocalyptic narrative voice is being suppressed. Thus, although The Golden Age is explicitly not about the decline of Jewish fortunes in the Crown of Aragon, the author frequently foreshadows disaster. Describing the many charters and privileges received by the Jews, for example, he writes cryptically that these signs of strength "contained the hidden roots of future disasters" (p. 48, and similarly at p. 24). Reversals, such as the prohibition on Jews in royal service issued in 1284, are described as the "first stage of a process that was to end in massacres ... and destruction" (p. 14). Even very early in his study the author turns to this paradox of decline within success: "By the beginnings of the thirteenth century Jewish society . . . contained both the ingredients of its future greatness and the roots of the social and religious conflicts that were to tear it apart in later generations" (p. 5). These are hints of a teleological argument that never fully emerges, partly because the structure of the book precludes its development, and partly because such an argument cannot convincingly be made without paying more attention to the Christian context. A similar argument lies behind Jewish Economy, in many ways intended as a companion volume to The Golden Age. The book concludes: "paradoxically, the greater the economic support the Jews lent to the king, the nearer they drew to their tragic end" (p. 242). Jewish Economy concentrates on the first half of this argument, documenting in unprecedented detail the financial transactions that bound Jews to the monarchy. Readers will be amazed at the extent to which the royal house depended on Jews for its solvency: day-to-day expenses ranging from bed linens to the purchase of mules, big-ticket items</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 395 like land purchases and large-scale military campaigns, even the meat for feeding the lions in the royal menagerie (an example not cited by Assis); all were financed by Jewish taxes, Jewish loans, Jewish gifts and bequests. As with The Golden Age, however, the author is less successful at establishing the second half of his paradoxical argument, that this success led to the Jews' downfall. He often alludes to popular resentment of the Jews as a causal force in their fate, but he rarely documents or describes these Christian attitudes, and makes no attempt to explain them. If anything, he engages in apologetics against them: high interest rates were justified, debtors were not "oppressed" (pp. 41, 54). The problem is to some extent compounded by his separation of royal policy from popular attitudes toward Jews. The kings were not anti-Jewish, he insists, their policies were designed to protect this important source of income, and they frequently intervened on behalf of Jewish lenders. It was rather the populace, whipped up by the church, that was hostile to the Jews. At some level this is clearly true: monarchs did depend on the taxes and subsidies they demanded of the Jews, and therefore they tried to protect Jewish communities and to enforce Jewish loans. It is equally clear, however, that the immense financial burden the monarchy placed on the Jews, together with its frequent intervention in the market for money (selling moratoria on loans, launching inquisitions into usurious practices for the purposes of collecting massive fines, etc.), drove up the cost of capital and contributed to resentment of the Jews. Even from a strictly economic point of view, it seems difficult to attempt to classify, as Assis often does (e.g., p. 67), a given fiscal policy as pro- or anti-Jewish. Of course the study of these policies is an important element in understanding the fate of the Jews of the Crown of Aragon, but the analytical field will have to be considerably broadened before we can begin to understand adequately the paradox Assis points to as the crux of the matter. But these are quibbles. Specialists will much appreciate Jewish Economy's many contributions to our understanding of Jewish economic life, taxation, tax collection, and a vast number of related issues. More general readers, as well as specialists, cannot fail to learn from the wide sweep of The Golden Age's erudition. Some may wish for fuller bibliography. Both volumes cite very little of the relevant bibliography on the "non-Jewish" history of the Crown of Aragon, and even on specifically Jewish topics there are important omissions. The author seems to prefer citing medieval documents rather than modem research, even when it provides useful commentary to the documents</page><page sequence="6">396 BOOK REVIEWS he is citing or makes them available in published form. But he also overlooks scholars whose work makes available fundamental documentation he seems unaware of, such as Elena Lourie's articles drawing on the trial transcripts preserved in the archive of the Crown of Aragon, or Thomas Bisson's study and edition of the early-thirteenth-century fiscal accounts of Catalonia. These omissions are regrettable, but they are perhaps inevitable in a project of this scope and majesty, a project that has yielded two such significant steps forward in the history of Jews in the Crown of Aragon.
