Detroit, MI: Wayne State University Press, 2005. xv, 280 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001141 Jewish history is inherently international in scope and therefore can provide welcome assistance to efforts to globalize arenas of inquiry that formerly were conducted within narrow frames of reference. U.S. women's history is a case in point: A tendency to focus primarily on nonreligious organizations assumed to derive from a secularized Protestant cultural heritage has left the door open for important contributions by historians of Jewish women's organizations. Likewise, historians focusing on Jewish efforts for international relief and on the Zionist movement have shied away from attention to women's organizations, which, though sometimes outnumbering those led by men, challenge interpretive frame works suggested by primarily male organizations. Mary McCune sets out to address these historiographie lacunae in her study (&lt;The Whole Wide World Without Limits ": International Relief, Gender Politics, and American Jewish Women, 1893-1930. The revised Ohio State Uni versity dissertation explores the awakening of American Jewish women to a sense of responsibility for coreligionists in Europe and Palestine by the inter national emergencies occasioned by World War I and the subsequent multina tional programs they initiated. It focuses on women's involvement in the National Council of Jewish Women, Hadassah (the Women's Zionist Organiz ation of America), and the socialist Workmen's Circle. By including women's organizations of varying class and ethnic composition, she hopes to illustrate diversity within the Jewish community and the different strategies for inter national relief that resulted. Two major interpretive rubrics of women's history during the Progressive Era orient McCune's study: maternalism and separatism. She finds that Jewish women shared the maternalist outlook that animated the largest and most success ful movements of women's political and social activism of the day. Like suffra gists, campaigners for women's health and welfare and the Protestant women's missionary movement, Jewish women's organizations based their efforts on notions of women's superior ability to perceive and act on human needs because of their instincts and women's experiences and responsibilities as mothers, both as biological mothers and as social housekeepers mothering com munities and the nation. Maternalist values and assumptions dictated separatism as an organizational strategy, as only a single-sex organization could ensure that women's distinctive values would set priorities for action. Jewish women learned this the hard way as they cooperated with male-led organizations during the emergency of the war and then found it difficult to reas sert their own priorities afterward. In every case, women's groups set a higher pri ority on welfare within the private sphere, particularly the environments in which women bore and raised children. And in every case, arguments between male and female leaders over priorities led to struggles for control of organizational purse strings. However, unlike Protestant and Catholic women's groups, which 202</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews existed within denominational structures of authority, Jewish women's groups were able to successfully separate their finances and regain full autonomy. Differences over gendered relief agendas became especially acute in Zionist circles, where women were criticized as "philanthropists" practicing charity rather than valued as contributors to the goal of a self-sufficient Jewish community in Palestine. Here, the women's insistence on pragmatic efforts to support women and children in the yishuv contrasted with ideological concerns that sometimes paralyzed male-led organizations. The women's concern for concrete projects made them critical of what they perceived as vague programs more concerned with ideology than action. Hadassah, the largest of the three organizations, provides the fullest case study for McCune's project. Indeed, the absence of Hadassah, the largest women's organization in the country for the second half of the twentieth century, in general accounts of U.S. women's history constitutes a serious gap. Focusing on the home base of Hadassah women in the United States, McCune's book is complemented by a new study of Hadassah's work in Palestine, Hadassah and the Zionist Project, by Erica B. Simmons (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2006). Based primarily on publications produced by the three organizations (National Council of Jewish Women, Hadassah, and Workmen's Circle) and their leaders, McCune's account is most helpful in providing access to the perspec tives of participants. The comparison between the organizations is less satisfying than the discussion of each one. Not surprisingly, the two middle-class groups, the highly Americanized National Council of Jewish Women and the more diverse Hadassah, grew closer together by the end of the period as members of the latter found themselves more distant from the immigrant experience. Yiddish speaking working-class members could find a role in these groups only by accept ing their mainstream ideals of American Jewish identity and a broad social reform agenda. Yet the agenda they ultimately advanced in socialists women's groups did not differ dramatically from that of their more acculturated coreligionists?they supported Yiddish schools, choruses, and other cultural and social efforts. More surprising is the extent to which women from different class back grounds joined an underlying consensus on a maternalist agenda for social welfare based on innate feminine capacities for caring and used it to determine organizational priorities. It would be interesting to delve further into how Jewish women were able to participate in a set of gendered values so deeply enmeshed in Christian domestic ideologies and the social welfare institutions that emerged from them. It would also be helpful to explore how maternalist and separatist agendas appeared in other women's groups, within and beyond synagogue structures. This book should set the stage for much-needed further work. Ann Braude Harvard Divinity School Cambridge, Massachusetts 203</page></plain_text>
