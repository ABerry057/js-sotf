Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1989. 347 pp. The German-Jewish immigration coda of the thirties is perhaps one of the most misunderstood episodes in American Jewish history. This stems from a widely held popular belief that German Jews were more inclined to</page><page sequence="2">242 BOOK REVIEWS Germanism than Judaism; they were assimilationist. In addition, scholars have tended to focus on the refugee intellectuals, products of the cosmopoli- tan culture of Europe, who formed only a small part of the immigration. This study, which focuses on the 20,000 German Jews who settled in an ethnic enclave north of 134th Street and south of Dyckman Street in north- ern Manhattan, goes far to correct such misimpressions. The Jewish community which formed in Washington Heights was not characteristic of the 150,000 German Jews who settled in the United States in the 1930s. Its members were Landsjuden and Kleinstadtjuden who had not been affected by the rapid urbanization after World War I. They were what the majority of Jews had once been in Germany, denizens of small towns and cities who tasted little of the Grossstadt spirit. They were of the lower middle class, less professionalized and affluent, and more religious. In their culture, especially in their formality and punctuality, they were recognizably German, but in their economic profile and the way they came to terms with their Judaism, they resembled their eastern brethren. But that affinity did not endear them to the children of the eastern immi- grants, who had by the 1930s inherited the mantle of leadership from the German-Jewish patricians of the nineteenth-century German-Jewish immi- gration. They thus had a double adjustment, as immigrants to a foreign country in the throes of depression, and as Jews to a Jewish community whose members had not forgotten the real and imagined humiliations their parents had endured at the hands of other German Jews. Moreover, they were involuntary immigrants who often experienced a precipitous decline in status as well as the loss of a homeland and culture which they held dear. By the time they reached American shores many had experienced the humilia- tion and calumny which the Third Reich reserved for its Jews. Some could not accommodate to the disorderliness of the new society, which offered few of the familiar benchmarks to determine one's societal station. Their ten- dency to compare their new lives with the glories of the old earned them the pejorative "Baiunsniks." The attitude of the Jewish host community emerges in the many jokes told about them. For example, one refugee dachs- hund informs another that in Germany he ate white bread every day. "That's nothing," responds the other, "in Germany I was a Saint Bernard." But few of the inhabitants of Washington Heights had been Saint Bernards in Germany. One wonders whether the "Fourth Reich," as the settlement was fondly</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 243 named, could serve as a prism for viewing the Building concept proffered by George Mosse some years ago. Mosse postulated that German Jewry had a special culture of self-fulfillment which defined its Judaism. One learns that the Jews of Washington Heights did have a palpable Germanness about them, but were hardly gebildet, that is, "cultured," in the Central European sense used by Mosse. On the one hand, they were far more Jewish, "frum- mer," than is generally believed. The nine congregations they founded in quick order were mostly of the Orthodox and Conservative persuasions, and the Breuer group, which was in but not quite of the community, was a model of piety. But they also possessed the enormous organizational skills we have come to associate with German Jewry. In a few years they duplicated their former elaborate self-help network with a full panoply of organizations, social clubs, and sundry vereins. In addition, there were two newspapers, one of which, Aufbau, developed into the best ethnic newspaper in the western hemisphere. Lowenstein correctly classifies this transitional community as a sub- minority in the larger minoritarian Jewish community, but distinguishes it from other special communities, like Boro Park or Williamsburg, with which it might too facilely be compared. It was predictably more Western, and its inhabitants were probably more economically mobile. That mobility was based, not on a starting-from-scratch ethos, but on the more powerful one of catching up, of retrieving lost status. They had arrived virtually pen- niless and capital formation had to be started all over again. Unable to be absorbed in the existing ethnic economy, they soon developed their own. Their rapid mobility did not sit well with anti-Semites or with Jews who resented their "middle-class nature." Their climb received a great boost from the restitution payments by the German government after the war, and that too was resented. By the time Washington Heights was inundated by Hispanic immigrants during the 1960s, it had become clear that the very source of the community's decline was the economic success of its children, who, like the successful children of the eastern immigrants, moved to the golden ghettoes in suburbia. Like so many things in American Jewish his- tory, Washington Heights was a one-generation phenomenon. This fine study employs a judicious mixture of sociological and historical methodology. Lowenstein has skills in both areas, in addition to the requi- site language skill. The immediacy of the narrative undoubtedly stems from the fact that he is a son of the Washington Heights community. In the grow-</page><page sequence="4">244 BOOK REVIEWS ing number of studies of local and special Jewish communities, I would rank Frankfurt on the Hudson near the top. It is a welcome addition.
