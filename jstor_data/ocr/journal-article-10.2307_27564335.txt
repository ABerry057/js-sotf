<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael Satlow. Creating Judaism: History, Tradition, Practice. New York: Columbia University Press, 2006. xii, 340 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001049 Michael Satlow, with an established reputation as an innovative, theory driven scholar of Judaism in late antiquity, seems now to have written the book he has always wanted to write. Pitched at the "introductory" level (to a highly literate implied reader who probably knows more about "postmodernism" than the Talmud, but who would like to change that), this book is an extended meditation on how current academic models of the study of religion impose their logic on the material of Jewish history, religion, and culture. The publisher, no doubt, would like to see copies of the book in the textbook departments of university bookstores, supplying the next generation of Judaism 101. It might be a bit too difficult?and idiosyncratic ?for that. But I would say that this book's proper audience is the experienced undergraduate topping off a major in Jewish studies or religious studies, or the beginning graduate student, for whom the development of a theoretical self consciousness is a key professional imperative. That, at least, is where it will turn up in the Jewish studies and comparative religion curricula at my own university. The most important aspect of Satlow's book, at the theoretical level, is his attack against the "essentialism" that, although perhaps inevitable in the 177</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews identity-forming discourses of Judaism itself, has for too long plagued academic discourse about Judaism. Such essentialism, in his view, has enabled scholars to smuggle normative definitions of Jewish "authenticity" (based on unempirical claims to discern an alleged transhistorical "essence" or "idea" of Judaism, be it "ethical monotheism" or some other abstraction) into their professedly "value neutral" scholarly projects. Fair enough. This depiction of academic Jewish studies is certainly true of most of the nineteenth-century models we were all taught to dismiss in graduate school. And, to tell the truth, today it is not hard to find introductory texts on Judaism that are as theologically laden and archly essentialist as anything pro duced in the studies of A. Geiger or H. Graetz (and a whole lot less well informed, to boot). That, in fact, is why I decided ("to hell with this drivel!") to write my own textbook more than ten years ago, and why, I suspect, Satlow decided to write his.1 Satlow's principal intellectual resource in constructing a nonessentialist model of Judaism is the towering figure of J. Z. Smith. Smith's distinction between "nomothetic" (i.e., essentialist) and "polythetic" (i.e., trait-clustered) defi nitions of religion (first worked out by Smith on the materials of ancient Judaism, by the way) was rigorously applied in the work of J. Neusner. Neusner inspired many?particularly those of us working as his students in the field of Judaism in late antiquity?to conceive ancient Judaism as not one thing (i.e., "Judaism") in various genuine or inauthentic forms but as many overlapping and intersecting things ("Judaisms"), related to each other by certain clusters of shared, differentiat ing traits (e.g., practicing certain rites, avoiding certain foods, focusing on certain symbols, or adamantly rejecting such rites, food taboos, or symbols). That is, there is no abstract "Judaism" out there against which historians can measure the imitative success of various empirical pretenders to the title; rather, all "Judaisms" are experiments, communally grounded efforts to interpretively work the various traditional clusters of Judaic traits into sustaining symbols of identity. These interpretively generated appropriations are each a Judaism, to the degree that each functions to anchor the identity of any group claiming to be "Israel." Thus, what might be termed the "de-Troeltschification of Judaism" is completed?not one Judaism but many overlapping (or intersecting, or self-isolating) Judaisms. Where there is no church, can one speak of sects? Satlow's use of Smith's polythetic model is somewhat more cautious than Neusner's, whose opposition of essentialized Judaism to polythetically generated Judaisms Satlow regards as overstated (but on the right track). Concretely, Satlow proposes to develop his own historical model of Judaic identity-within-diversity, the aim of which is "to create and apply a non-normative model of Judaism that 1. I reserve the right to be miffed that my own contribution to the "nonessentialist" textbook literature on Judaism goes unmentioned in Satlow's pages. See my Early Judaism: Religious Worlds of the First Judaic Millennium, 2nd ed. (Bethesda: University Press of Maryland, 2006), 9-13, 263 66. I'm not sure that greater familiarity with my book would have improved his. But it would have been nice to have been acknowledged, perhaps, as "a flawed beginning to work more excellently achieved in my own." After all, the first edition has been in classrooms since 1997, long enough for Satlow to have examined it. 178</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews might help us to better understand how Jewish communities throughout history have been so diverse and yet considered themselves members of the same family" (8). He proposes to do so by employing another classic metaphor of Smith's, that scholarship in religion is about the making of imaginative "maps" that more or less correspond to, but can never be equated with, the "territory" they represent. The entire discussion of historical forms of Judaism is to be anchored by three such conceptual maps: "Israel, textual tradition, and religious practice" (8). That is to say, what constitutes Judaism in any given time and place is the col lection of sociologically discrete communities that embrace the identity of "Israel" (even while disputing the content of that identity); dispute about the meaning of diverse, partly shared, and partly vilified canonical texts (e.g., different scriptural corpora, disputes over the authority of rabbinic texts); and perpetuate, in diverse forms, a more or less common cluster of traditional ritual acts (e.g., the variety of ways of celebrating the Sabbath, abstaining from certain foods). Now, one might quibble with precisely this set of maps, but I, for one, regard them as plausible for a start. And, in practice, the body of the book is rather impress ive in its disciplined, well-informed use of this three-dimensional map to illumine a good deal of the historical Jewish territory. The potential value of Satlow's mapping of the Judaic world is illustrated most successfully in the book's first chapter, entitled "Promised Lands." Here, Satlow offers a bird's-eye view of the territory of Judaism as it currently exists in the United States and Israel. Satlow knows both cultures with the intimacy of a participant-observer, and he comes as close as anyone has yet to providing an ethnographically detailed, historically tutored, politically balanced por trait of all the players in the games of American and Israeli Judaism, as well as iden tifying the rules of play. This is terrific work. Unfortunately, this chapter is the only one that truly redeems the theoretical promise of the introduction. The remainder of the nine historical chapters unfold in the conventional chronological sequence: the construction of the scriptural canon (Chap. 2); the emergence of diaspora and Palestinian Jewish civilizations, with Hellenism as a key cultural interlocutor (Chap. 3); the structure of classic rabbin ism and the emergence of the halakhic tradition (Chap. 4-6); medieval philosophy, halakhic thought, and mysticism (Chap. 7-9), and the diverse experiences of Western and eastern European modernity. To be fair, Satlow makes good on his promise, in the introduction, to avoid a teleological narrative in which the history of Judaism is portrayed as the stately unfolding of an original idea in history. There is in Satlow's narrative no impli cation that Judaism should have been conquered by the rabbis because of their Judaism's essential harmony with the spirit of the Bible, nor any trace of analysis that pits "heretical" ideas against "the authentic tradition." As promised, each chapter is rich in its focus on disparate Israels whose "Judaism" is generated by rubbing up against each other and discovering points of similarity and difference. But just here a problem emerges. Though Satlow does rearrange the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle of Judaism's history into interesting, fresh configurations, he generally keeps them in their traditional boxes. His periodization of Judaism's history, described earlier, is surprisingly conventional in light of his introduction's 179</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews explicit assertion that, from a polythetic point of view, there can be no "history of Judaism." Let me cite the crucial paragraph in more or less its entirety: Because Judaism, however, is not a single phenomenon that can be captured in a single, predominant narrative, it is misleading to talk of the "history of Judaism." Judaism, as a whole, does not have a story; any master narrative obscures the dynamic process by which communities continually recreate their Judaism. Indeed, even those elements of Judaism that can be traced his torically infrequently develop in any kind of linear way. Jewish communities do not typically adhere piously to the ideas and rituals of the generations immediately before them, particularly when they live in different social and cultural traditions. Rather, they often skip back to previous texts and rituals in order to lend authority to practices that they find more concordant with their own society. A history of Judaism creates a history where none truly existed, drawing a straight line through a tangled web and thus almost arbi trarily declaring some things central to its story and others marginal. (7; emphasis added) It seems to me that Satlow's reliance on the consensual periodization of Jewish history?however creatively he might label these periods and identify their defin ing discursive partners and their interests?renders his global dismissal of nomo thetic essentialism a bit hollow. The "history of Judaism" certainly exists. It exists, of course, where all histories exist?in the minds of those who interpret the past. All we can argue about is the value of one or another narrative in terms of its capacity to make sense of the mass of detail. On this view, Satlow has promised rather more than he has delivered. Before us is a thoughtful methodological meditation with at least one truly innovative application to contemporary Judaism. But this protest against the concept of the "history of Judaism" offers us, at best, a few unexpected routes through otherwise familiar territory. Martin S.
