Oxford: Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 2003. xiv, 256 pp. The religious thought of Rabbi Tsevi Hirsch Kalischer seems a promising starting point for a study of messianism in the Jewish encounter with modernity. Kalischer himself stood at the vortex of dramatic changes that were transforming Jewish life in the mid-nineteenth century. He lived on the seam line between East- ern and Western European Jewries, at a crucial historical juncture that witnessed political upheaval, the rise of nationalism, the crisis of enlightenment thought. His 186</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews lifetime spanned the period of great hopes for Jewish emancipation and early dis- enchantment with it. Religiously and philosophically, Kalischer was in some sense both a remnant of an increasingly challenged traditional society and a harbinger of modern Jewish politics. In his thought, Kalischer embodied the pivotal role which messianic impulses played in the transformations of Jewish life in the nineteenth- century encounter with modernity. "The battle over modernization" itself, Jody Myers argues intriguingly in her opening chapter, "was fought in the language of messianism" (p. 2). The greatest strengths of her book lie in her suggestions of the ways in which religious re- formers and conservatives alike mobilized and transformed notions of redemption as a key to recasting Jewish life itself. Or did they? There was, Myers also sug- gests, "very little debate" among Europe's Jews "on the messianic idea in general or the sacrificial prayers in particular" (p. 75). The book consequently hints at an inherent tension in its own argument: Was Kalischer's radical halakhic departure- his proposal that sacrificial worship be resumed in Palestine-part of a broader social and intellectual context, or did it stem instead from a certain naivete which severed him in some sense from the contemporary context of religious tumult, al- lowing him, as Myers also argues, simply to assume "reasonably, that pious Jews ... accepted in their hearts the prayers they were uttering for the renewal of sacri- ficial worship [and] the return to the Holy Land" (p. 82)? One is left to wonder, however, whether pious Jews of earlier ages-or the majority of Kalischer's pious contemporaries, who rejected his scheme-did not also accept these prayers "in their hearts." And supposing they did, how then did clearly differing understand- ings of these prayers and their invocation of an ancient past engender sharply di- vergent visions of a Jewish future? This tension impresses itself upon one's understanding of Kalischer's own texts and exegetical work as well. The ancient sacrificial cult, as Myers shows, emerged as a crucial polemical motif in the nineteenth century-"a code" (p. 103) demarcating the line between reformers, who sought to remove all traces of the sacrifices from a reformed liturgy, and conservatives, for whom it became a sym- bolic measure of continued Jewish distinctiveness. It remains somewhat unclear, however, whether for Kalischer the centrality of a restored sacrificial cult was ar- rived at within the context of these contemporary debates, or independently of them. On the one hand, Myers argues that Kalischer avoided the polemics, devot- ing himself to an ostensibly pure exegesis. And yet the very exegetical models he constructs-of the confrontation between Moses and Pharaoh, for example- seem to resonate with a strident polemical force, as Kalischer puts Pharaoh to use as representative of a religiosity which holds external ritual to be unnecessary, while Moses embodies "the indispensability of the performance of acts" to signi- fy one's love for God (p. 122). Rather than placing Kalischer at a distance from the polemical battles, this kind of exegesis seems in fact to situate him at their very heart. Not surprisingly, however, it was from within the conservative camp, rather than among reformers, that Kalischer met with his most formidable opposition. Myers suggests enticingly that the dispute with his former teacher Akiva Eger, for example, was "at its core, about the structure and authority of post-Temple Ju- 187</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews daism" (p. 102), intimating at what might be a rich opportunity to explore the ways in which differing responses to modernity not only divided reformers from con- servatives, but led to variations and fissures within the religious conservative camp as well. Myers is justifiably wary of"historians intent on showing that Kalischer was a proto-Zionist" (p. 63 n.). Her discussion, however, does raise the prospect of new directions which might shed a more nuanced light on intricate ways in which in- terpretive molds might nevertheless have been transmitted. What links might there be between Kalischer's brand of radical exegesis and his reinterpretation of ha- lakhah and scripture (within an apparently changing environment of discourse in the nineteenth-century Jewish world generally) and the Zionist call for a rereading of Jewish culture some decades later? Myers takes some interesting steps in this regard, examining Kalischer's recasting of a concept such as ge'ulat ha-'are; from one pertaining to the laws of shemitah to one denoting the "land's life-giving pow- er," implying that the Jews "would be redeeming the land, and . .. would be re- deemed through it" (p. 170). Zionists would later embrace similar readings of this and other traditional concepts. Might Kalischer's dramatic exegetical departure point to the kind of conceptual paradigm shift which would set some of the ground- work for Zionist discourse? Adopting such a perspective, Kalischer's thought might allow for new in- sight into the intricate weave connecting modern Jewish nationalism to tradition- al Jewish religiosity. Indeed, the issues raised by Myers' examination of Kalisch- er's life and thought clearly have the potential to shed new light on the Jewish modernity project itself, and certainly on the changes in internal Jewish discourse which gave rise to Jewish nationalism and to the Jewish rediscovery of Palestine. Kalischer's life spanned a number of crossroads at which European Jews were try- ing on new ways of re-shaping their understandings of both divine and human spheres, to the ultimate effect of revolutionary transformations in Jewish life. Seek- ing Zion hints at some tantalizing new directions in exploring this modern Jewish odyssey. Arieh Saposnik Arizona State University Tempe, Arizona</page></plain_text>
