<plain_text><page sequence="1">J. H. Chajes. Between Worlds: Dybbuks, Exorcists, and Early Modern Judaism. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2003. 278 pp. Jewish mystical and magical texts are remarkably relevant to some of the most central historiographical themes of early modern Europe; they are also re- markably esoteric and confounding to any nonspecialist. Providing a remedy to this incongruity, J. H. Chajes makes a major contribution to both Jewish and gen- eral early modem historiography with his first book, on Jewish spirit possession and exorcism. His work offers a useful narrative of the development of Jewish ex- orcism traditions, presenting the complex subject in terms that make it more ap- 2.

At the same time, Chajes lends the mate- rial depth and relevance through sensitive analysis of the chronologically and ge- ographically local circumstances of the most significant early modern treatments of the phenomenon. The appendix alone would be an offering of some signifi- cance, consisting of eleven original translations of early modern accounts of spir- it possession, and this quality of presenting important raw material runs throughout the volume. Competent and detailed legwork is evident in the exposition of vari- ous exorcists' techniques from the ancient world and Middle Ages, through Luria's unique methods in sixteenth-century Safed, and up to later seventeenth-century attitudes to possession and demonology. Much of this material is in the first chap- ter, "The Emergence of Dybbuk Possession," which argues that "there was some- thing new in the sixteenth century" as a long percolation of diverse traditions culminated in the formation of the "classic" view of the dybbuk in a period of un- precedented frequency of possession and exorcism events. The second chapter then swoops in closely on the Safedian context, dwelling on the physical and historical characteristics of the city to overcome the unfortu- nately necessary reliance on accounts that were written or published a century later than the events themselves. Self-consciously anthropological as much as his- toricist, Chajes reads the possession narratives closely with an eye to the "spiritu- al economy" of the city, convincingly elucidating the relationships and conditions that are only hinted at in the texts, and often wisely admitting of several spiritual, cultural, and interpersonal possibilities at once. The third chapter, "The Task of the Exorcist," delves into the details of the exorcism techniques themselves, beginning with Luria's innovations and then contrasting these with more traditional, magical incantations to which later practitioners returned. Later chapters explore more per- spectives on possession, as Chajes exposes the large role of spiritually powerful early modem women in "Dybbuk Possession and Women's Spirituality," and ex- plains Menasseh ben Israel's use of Jewish traditions about spirit possession as a tool against skepticism in soon-to-be-enlightened seventeenth-century Amster- dam, in "Skeptics and Storytellers." Each such perspective is well chosen for its relevance to salient characteris- tics of the early modem period and the relationship of the Jewish minority to those characteristics. As Chajes points out, the early modem period has long been known as a time of profusion of possessions and exorcisms in the Christian west. The phe- nomenon has been evaluated by general historians in connection with the inter- related factors of gender, witchcraft, social and economic tensions, and religious change. Although many of these previous frameworks for understanding possession apply mainly or exclusively to Christian contexts, Chajes complicates matters by showing that Jews, too, experienced a sudden rise in an interest in demons and pos- session. He rejects the "influence model" as "largely predicated upon a view of Jewish culture as foreign to its local environment. Seeing Jews as integral to their local environment allows us to see them as full participants in broad cultural move- ments and mentalities that were no more owned by Christians than by Jews" (8). Unfortunately, Chajes is unable to explore this complex relationship fully, but the comparative perspective undoubtedly informs many of his choices throughout the book. 379</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Between Worlds is also rich with material relevant to fascinating questions about the early modem history of Jews in particular. Women's spirituality, the mod- ernizing role of kabbalah and magic, and the role of the Sephardi diaspora both in early exiles and later exconversos in Amsterdam, are all illuminated as Chajes throws a spotlight on specific examples. At times, one wishes for more extensive analysis of the material thus exposed: there is hardly more than passing reference to the important recent debates about the impact of the expulsion on Jewish cul- ture, especially mysticism, and Chajes only touches on considerations of elite ver- sus popular religious practices and knowledge as he considers the role of gender in dybbuk possession. Even in the chapter on women's spirituality, the emphasis is on showing off the raw material, while comparative or phenomenological analysis is relegated to brief comments. Ultimately, these several viewpoints over the valley of the possessing spirits give only partial impressions of underlying connections or driving historical fac- tors. However, as Chajes points out, this complex territory was previously so bar- ren that he must devote much energy to planting the first seeds. Even as he discusses the potential of such a comparative approach, he makes the disclaimer that his re- marks will necessarily be "provisional and speculative" (7). This book does show that there is prodigious fruit to be had from the shoots; some indication of the grow- ing interest in this area is also given by the felicitous publication of Matt Goldish's collection of diverse essays on the subject, Spirit Possession in Judaism: Cases and Contexts from the MiddleAges to the Present (Wayne State University Press, 2003) at nearly the same time. It appears that more scholarly attention to Jewish spirit pos- session can be expected, and in the meantime, Chajes has provided an inestimable service by bringing this material to light with sensitivity and aplomb.
