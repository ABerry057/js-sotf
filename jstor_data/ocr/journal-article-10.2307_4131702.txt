New York: Oxford University Press, 1998. xvii, 462 pp. This book, by the late professor of biblical studies at Hebrew Union Col- lege, Cincinnati, is a companion volume to his Toward a Grammar of Biblical Po- etics (Oxford, 1992), in which, by utilizing rhetorical or poetic techniques, he first made the case for the aesthetic wholeness of the Hebrew Bible. Whereas the first volume analyzed narrative texts relating to the prophets, in this volume Herbert Brichto devotes his literary analysis to the early Genesis narratives, including the Creation, Flood, and Abraham stories. Brichto's philosophy is clear: There is a common community of discourse between ancient writers and ourselves. Hence, ancient writers were fully aware of such modes of discourse as metaphor, figurative language, and irony. To under- stand the world of the Bible, one has to understand this discourse, and thus one has to be aware of the various rhetorical or poetic techniques employed by the ancient writers or else be mired in the bog of literalism. And it is literalists, both religious fundamentalists and representatives of modern biblical scholarship (the so-called source-critics), against whom Brichto inveighs throughout this book. If only schol- ars of this bent understood the biblical idiom and modes of expression, he argues, they would not be led astray into the methodological errors to which they are so prone. Take genre, for example. Correct methodology requires that a text be ana- lyzed and then assigned a genre. But what modern critical scholars do is assume that a text belongs to a certain genre and then interpret it in the light of the assumed genre. They maintain, for example, that the narrative after Gen 2:4b is another Cre- ation story by a different author than that of first Creation story in Gen 1:1-2:4a. But Brichto demonstrates through his analysis of the text that this narrative is not a Creation text at all; rather it is a Paradise story. Thus, there are not two Creation stories, and not two authors. The assertion of unity of authorship is dominant in Brichto's book. Indeed its very title, The Names of God, is a visible assertion of this unity. Brichto revives the old (and now long discarded) theory of Umberto Cassuto as to the different us- ages of the divine names Yahweh and Elohim. Yahweh is used when there is men- tion of Israel or the ancestors of Israel (the patriarchs), Elohim is used for outsiders or for generic descriptions of God. There was one author of the Pentateuch, and the unity of the text can be demonstrated by a proper understanding of its gram- mar and rhetoric. The rhetorical device that Brichto most frequently uses to demonstrate the text's unity is what he terms the synoptic-resumptive technique. That is, when the writer first briefly describes an action (hence, synoptic; gives a synopsis) and then, in a second account, gives much more detail (hence resumptive; the author resumes the subject left off in the first account). This technique seems to the reviewer to be 349</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review analogous to the rabbinic exegetical technique called kelal uferat ("from general to particular"), but Brichto has expanded it considerably and employs it to explain difficulties in texts usually thought to contain duplications or contradictions. Con- sider how he argues for the unity of the Flood story, for example. The two accounts of the instructions to bring different animals, thought to signal two authors, are ex- plained by regarding the first account as synoptic (a pair of each species), and the second account as resumptive (there are two orders of pairing: single pairs for the unclean, seven pairs for the clean). Hence, the so-called contradiction no longer exists, the second account is simply a more detailed account of the first. This is a book that one cannot read casually, and readers are strongly advised to have a Hebrew Bible near at hand to follow Brichto's close reading of the text. He will demonstrate when a Hebrew phrase is being used paratactically (connect- ing parallel sentences by "and") or hypotactically (using statements parenthetical- ly or by subordinate clauses necessitating conjunctions such as "when," "because," or "although"). Sometimes he employs these techniques very successfully, as when he deftly demonstrates how Lot, who had mistakenly closed the door behind him (Gen 19:6), is taken back safely into his house by the angels without the mob of riotous townsfolk pouring through the door. In other instances, Brichto's solutions are a little fanciful and require readers to suspend their rational judgment in favor of interpretations that require acknowledgment of hidden riddles, codes, and metaphors within metaphors. However, if one stays the course and follows Brich- to's often quite involved arguments, one can only admire his ingenuity and bril- liance, and more often than not one will find oneself rewarded by a new appreci- ation of familiar texts.
