Sde Boker: Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Press, 2004. 416 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000694 The socialist Zionist labor movement Po'ale-Tsiyon, which first appeared in the Pale of Settlement in Russia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centu ries, has been the subject of many studies over the years. However, although Po'ale-Tsiyon was extremely prominent in the Diaspora, most studies have focused on Palestine and the Zionist enterprise there. Until recently, most of the detailed research on Po'ale-Tsiyon in the Diaspora has been biographical, dealing with the history of the movement through the lives and thought of in divi dual leaders. However, in the past decade, several books on the history of Po'ale Tsiyon in the Diaspora?in the Austrian Empire (especially Galicia), the United States and Canada, and Poland (Po'ale-Tsiyon Left)?have been published, mostly in Israel but also in the United States. Zvia Balshan's book on the World Union of Po'ale-Tsiyon from its inception in 1907 to the split between Po'ale Tsiyon and Po'ale-Tsiyon Left in 1920 is one of these. Balshan's book fills an important part of the complex mosaic that these books have created and furthers our understanding of the relations between the Po'ale-Tsiyon parties in the various countries in light of their ideological differ ences. But its primary importance is its contribution to an understanding of the joint activity of the Po'ale-Tsiyon parties in Jewish and general international poli tics, especially during World War I. Po'ale-Tsiyon parties were founded in 1905-6, first in the United States (December 1905), then in Russia (March 1906), the Austrian Empire (the party there had existed since 1904 but its conceptual platform was only finalized in October 1906), and finally in Palestine (October 1906). Other national socialist parties, ideologically similar to Po'ale-Tsiyon, were also founded during this period (and even earlier) among the Jews of eastern Europe: the Zionist Socialist (Territorialist) Party and the Sejmist Party. However, these parties?which also entertained a territorial option outside eastern Europe as a solution to the distress of eastern European Jewry, did not establish branches in other countries and did not form an international organization. Po'ale-Tsiyon was different. Ideologically, it was the only national socialist movement that believed the solution to the Jewish problem could come only in Palestine. In terms of its organization, it consisted of four major parties in different countries, founded almost simultaneously, and immediately sought to create an international union of Po'ale-Tsiyon parties. Alongside the ideological principles shared by all four Po'ale-Tsiyon parties, each had its own unique ideological traits that resulted from the variations of social ist thought they adopted and consequently affected the nature of the synthesis between Zionism and socialism they proposed. These ideological differences made the founding and running of the World Union extremely difficult and complex. Zvia Balshan's book?whose Hebrew title, Thud Mefulag (Divided Union), hints at the "immanent" problem (as Balshan puts it) of the idea of the World Union of Po'ale-Tsiyon?focuses to a large extent on these ideological issues. 394</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews One of its conclusions is that, in the final analysis, the World Union was nothing but a forum in which three of the parties?the Russian, Galician, and American? could coordinate their positions with no authority to act (315-16). The first quarter of the book is devoted to a discussion of those ideological aspects related to the founding of the World Union. The author focuses on two inter related issues: first, the centrality of Palestine in Po'ale-Tsiyon's proposed solution to the Jewish problem. This raises the question of the status of the parties from the different countries, especially the status and centrality of the party in Palestine within the Union. Second, the structure of the Union: Was it to be a weak federation of parties or a monolithic organization with a social common denominator, as was the case in the Russian party, which would give that group a leadership position within it. These differences in ideology, organization, and leadership stemmed? according to Balshan?from the permanent tension between Palestine-related work and the "work of the present" that had plagued the Union since its inception. Therefore, she argues, the 1920 split in the World Union that led to the establish ment of Po'ale-Tsiyon Left was not surprising and traumatic but immanent and obvious. Its roots were not in the discussions held in Stockholm in 1919 concerning the accession of Po'ale-Tsiyon to the Third International but rather in old argu ments, especially the issue of Palestine-centrism, which were now being rehashed in new form. The ties with the International as manifested in the World Union's efforts to join and the activity of the World Union in the war years are two inter twined issues that form the heart of the book. Po'ale-Tsiyon was not the only organization that wanted representation in the International. Aharon Lieberman, who had raised the idea of ties between Jewish workers' organizations in different countries in the 1870s, had discussed with a few of his friends the idea of the Jews joining the International as a special section. The Bund had also hoped, from its inception, to get into the Inter national, and discussed the matter at length over the years. Thus, what was unique about the World Union of Po'ale-Tsiyon was not its desire to join but the practical efforts it made to join and the nature of its activity in this regard. Balshan divides the struggle to join the International into two periods: The first, before World War I, was marked by the need to decide what its status should be: After initially favoring an extraterritorial section for Po'ale-Tsiyon, the move ment switched to demanding an extraterritorial section for the entire Jewish pro letariat. The second period took place during World War I, when, by means of vigorous activity, the World Union succeeded in gaining admittance into the Socialist International with the status of a territorial section (Palestine). Indeed, the war years formed the peak of the political struggles undergone by the various Po'ale-Tsiyon parties. The challenges they faced put to the test the Jewish political ethos that had crystallized in eastern Europe before the war and forced it to develop significantly. Similar political struggles were waged by Po'ale-Tsiyon in America over aid for eastern European Jewry during the war and over the convening of an American Jewish Congress to represent the Jewish people in peace talks after the war. The World Union, too, reached the high point of its activity during the war. Balshan believes that the greatest achievement of the Union's leadership, which included representatives of the various countries involved in the fighting, had to 395</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews do with its connection to the international socialist movement. The Union's close ties with the leaders of the International and its activity among the parties within the Inter national persuaded that organization in the summer of 1917 to officially recognize the international nature of the Jewish question and the Jews' right to personal national autonomy in places with a highly concentrated Jewish population, as well as to recognize Palestine as a Jewish political center. Nevertheless, it seems that the importance of the World Union's activity during the war did not necessarily lie in this concrete achievement but rather in an achievement of principle. The World Union of Po'ale-Tsiyon, which chiefly represented four smallish parties in different countries (and a few even smaller parties in other countries), succeeded in becoming the spearhead of the Jewish pol itical struggle during the war and an important organization fighting for the status and rights of the Jewish people after its conclusion. Therefore, even though Bal shan's book deals extensively with the ideological disputes within the World Union and with the split and the establishment of Po'ale-Tsiyon Left, it is primar ily a volume that reveals to the reader an important facet of Diaspora Jewish pol itical organization and its involvement in the international arena in the first quarter of the twentieth century. The book is based on extensive documentation. It provides a great deal of new information that is useful in painting a picture of the highly complex activity of the World Union, with all its personal and ideological aspects and fine details. Even more significantly, it offers important insights. One of the most important has to do with the concept of fulfillment of the Zionist ideal, which in those days was primarily theoretical and did more for developing a national identity than for developing the Land of Israel. From this standpoint, this study deals with an edifying chapter in the politi cal history of eastern European Jewry and of the Jewish people as a whole. Bal shan's book is thus a significant contribution to research on the Jewish labor movement. Beyond this, its new findings?as well as the author's insights? lend the study additional importance for research on Jewish history in general during the period of World War I and in its immediate aftermath.
