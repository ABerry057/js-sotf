Kushner In Overcoming Life's Disappointments, Harold S. Kushner intro- duces us not only to Moses as the man on the mountaintop, the man to whom God spoke with unparalleled intimacy, but Moses the human being, a man whose soaring triumphs were offset by disappointments in some of the things that mattered most to him. Kushner depicts Moses as a genuine hero to admire and learn from, perhaps more heroic when the all-too- human qualities of longing, frustration, regret, and resiliency have been added to the portrait.

Written with the searing honesty and verbal brilliance that is the hallmark of Mamet's work, The Wicked Son is a scathing look at one of the most destructive and tenacious forces in contemporary life, a powerfully thought-provoking and important book.

This definitive anthology gathers stories, essays, memoirs, excerpts from novels, and poems by more than 130 Jewish writers of the past two centuries who worked in the Russian language. It features writers of the tsarist, Soviet, and post-Soviet periods, both in Russia and in the great emigrations, representing styles and artistic movements from Romantic to Postmodern. Most of the works appear here for the first time in English or in new translations. Each work illuminates questions of Jewish history, status, and identity. Each author is profiled in an essay describing the personal, cultural, and historical context in which the writer worked, and individual works or groups of works are head-noted to provide further context. The anthology not only showcases a wide selection of individual works, but also offers an encyclopedic history of Jewish-Russian culture. "The translations are more than readable: they are literate in the best sense as they present a portrait of the cultural legacy and conflicted identity of the Jews of Russia. ... A must for every school or Temple, academic or major public library." * - Sander L. Gilman, Emory University "An impressive achievement, admirably researched and wide-ranging. ...
