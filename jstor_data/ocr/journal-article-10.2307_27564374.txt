Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 2006. xxx, 398 pp. doi:10.1017/S0364009408001311 The tannaitic compilation Mekhilta de-Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai {MRSY) has had a complicated textual history, which undoubtedly contributed to its rela tive scholarly neglect in comparison with its better-known tannaitic counterpart, the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael. MRSY ceased to be transmitted as a discrete work over the course of the Middle Ages and fell out of the "active consciousness" of medieval Jewish scholars (xiii). The absence of a discrete manuscript tradition was, in all likelihood, a major factor contributing to MRSTs failure to be printed in the sixteenth century. MRSTs failure to appear in print, combined with the printing and consequent happier scholarly fate of Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, further caused MRSY to pass out of the sight and minds of Jewish scholars. W. David Nelson's pioneering translation is a welcome recent addition to scholarly efforts, ongoing since the nineteenth century, to reconstruct a reliable text of MRSY and to situate it within its rabbinic literary context for further study and analysis. David Zvi Hoffmann (1843-1921) published the very first reconstruction of MRSY in 1905. In 1955, J. N. Epstein and Ezra Zion Melamed published the first true critical edition of MRSY based on their extensive collection and analysis of pertinent medieval manuscript evidence and geniza materials that had surfaced since 1905. The Epstein-Melamed edition (E/M) is still considered the best edition available for scholarly purposes, although Nelson acknowledges that an updated critical edition is a desideratum in light of the emergence over the past fifty years of a wealth of new material, as well as lingering methodological questions about E/M (xx). Nelson also appreciatively notes Menahem Kahana's contributions to this effort: Kahana's invaluable annotated catalogue of manu scripts of the tannaitic midrashim (1995), and his recent updated critical edition 421</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews of the Amalek tractates in MRSY and Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael (1999) (xxiv-xxv). Nelson's translation is another "first" in the history of MRSY?"the first comprehensive translation" of MRSY (EIM) "into any language" (xxv). Nelson's edition includes far more than a translation. First, the edition opens with a schol arly introduction to MRSY that expertly traces its textual history and history of scholarship. This introduction also explains Nelson's careful method of organizing the text of each tractate of MRSY into "chapters, sections, units of traditions, and subunits" so as "to facilitate the ability to reference with precision any specific location within it" (xxvi). Nelson has also included page references to E/M itself in the left-hand column of the translation to facilitate cross-references to that work. Third, Nelson provides an invaluable commentary to the translation. Finally, the edition includes an index of scriptural passages and of place-names. The massive scholarly effort involved in this labor of textual organization, trans lation, and annotation deserves acknowledgment and appreciation. Despite his stated awareness of the need for an updated critical edition of MRSY, Nelson identifies two important reasons to translate E/M even before the appearance of an updated critical edition. The first has already been noted: to organize the text of MRSY systematically so that materials within it can be refer enced precisely (xxvi). This goal is presumably related to the second: to make MRSY available now to a wide range of scholars in different branches of the hu manities. Nelson implicitly expresses his hope not only that other scholars in the humanities will find MRSY to be of use in their own scholarly projects but also that the additional scholarly attention to MRSY will advance the study of this important, understudied work (xxviii). The balance of this review is based on a reading of Nelson's translation and annotation of the tractates Sanya, Beshallah, Vayassa, Amalek, Kaspa, and Shab bata. The review will concentrate on the text of the translation, the typographic representation of the Hebrew text, and the annotation. The translation is of high quality, and is clearly the fruit of a sustained and focused study of MRSY The immensity of the undertaking must be borne in mind, for a project of this size will inevitably not be entirely free of imperfection. In a few cases, the translation, although not incorrect, is nevertheless arguably not the most accurate rendition of the original. For example, Nelson translated gedolei malkhut as "heads of state" (92, para. l.B), while it more accurately should be rendered "great ones of the kingdom," or "noblemen." "Heads of state" as the English phrase is currently used implies those who represent in their own persons the sovereignty of their nation?as a king does?which is likely not what is meant by the Hebrew phrase in context. Likewise, Nelson rendered the passive verb nital as an active verb (e.g., 90, paras. 3.G, J; 91, para. 7.C) and rendered what is clearly a rhetorical question in the original Hebrew as an exclamation (100, para. 3.A). While these are hardly fatal translation decisions, they are not entirely in keeping with Nelson's stated translation goal of eschewing idiomatic translation in favor of more literal translation, "however stilted or artificial the result" (xxv). Apropos of this point, Nelson translated kal vehomer as "it can be so reasoned" (171, para. 3.C), which is a rather too idiomatic rendering. Scholars outside the rabbinics 422</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews field?part of the edition's target audience?would likely benefit from a more literal translation of the term, or at least a note explaining the type of reasoning it represents. Similarly, gezerot is rendered as "Rabbinic prohibitions" (164, para. l.C), a translation that, while not entirely inaccurate, would also have been best accompanied by a note explaining the term and its use in rabbinic litera ture. In three places, however, the translation is arguably inaccurate. Nelson trans lated "It's good that I get to see the king every day!" (168, para. 7.E), although the Hebrew text would be better rendered as "It's sufficient if I only see the king once per day!" A bit later, Nelson translatedpanim hashukhot as "at night" (169, para. 16.B), although he elsewhere rendered it correctly as "dark countenance." The phrase birkat ha-Shem is translated as "[the need to] bless the name [of God]" (354, para. 2.B) without any indication in either the translation or notes that the phrase is a euphemism for uttering imprecations against God. Had the phrase been correctly represented as a euphemism, the enigmatic and inaccurate phrase "[the need to]" would have been justly eliminated. It is also curious that Nelson consistently rendered "R. Eleazar the Modiite" (the Hebrew reads Eleazar, without a yod) as "R. Eliezer the Modiite" (Eliezer in English implies a yod in the Hebrew original). Once again, a note explaining this decision would have been helpful. These are small points, however, in comparison to the accuracy and quality of the translation overall. Typographically, the text is painstakingly and superbly subdivided, and a reader can move between the Hebrew text, English translation, and E/M with ease. Some typographical errors did, however, find their way into the Hebrew text, although the translations of those passages are nevertheless correct. For example, Nelson's Hebrew text reads ruah ha-kashah (5, para. 2.C) rather than ruah ha-kodesh as per page 3 of E/M. On p. 7 (para. 4.A), and Nelson's Hebrew text reads R. Yohada rather than R. Yehudah, as we find on page 4 of E/M. On page 80 (para. l.B), Nelson's Hebrew text records a name as "R. Nehorai," although note 1 to the translation states inaccurately that the Hebrew text reads "Noharai." "Noharai" is, however, the version found on page 45 of E/M. Finally, on page 83 (para. 3.A), Nelson's Hebrew text reads zeh bazeh zeh, while E/M more sensibly reads zeh bezad zeh (46). Nevertheless, E/M itself contains textual oddities that naturally carried through to this edition. For example, the reading (arono shel Moshe (83, para. 2.A) where one would expect 'arono shel Yosef is found on page 46 of E/M. Nelson's annotation of the translation is a major scholarly accomplishment. These notes will be an important tool for specialists in the field as well as scholars in other humanistic disciplines. Heuristically, the notes fall into five categories, the first of which includes observations about MRSTs textual history, including criti cal comments on E/M (e.g., 3 n. 12, 5 n. 17). The second category consists of explanations of either the need to emend the Hebrew text or adjust the translation of a likely faulty text (e.g., 95 n. 85, 168 n. 27). The third category consists of notes about what the text shows us of rabbinic ideology and hermeneutics. Such notes will be of great use in opening up new avenues of research in MRSY (e.g., 4 n. 15). The fourth category consists of notes explaining features of the text that are not transparent, such as rabbinic concepts or unclear exegetical 423</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews moves. The notes in this fourth category are most helpful, and one can only wish that Nelson had provided even more than the hundreds (or more) that he included in this edition. For example, it can be argued that the general scholarly audience for this translation could benefit from additional elucidation of both the phrase melakhot ve-toldot and its English rendering as "primary work and secondary work" (381, para. 3.A). The fifth category of notes consists of references to parallel passages in Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael and in rabbinic literature generally. These references are also a vital resource for scholars seeking to advance the research agenda into MRSY. The nonspecialist reader seeking a comprehensive collection of parallel pas sages must be careful to follow all the leads Nelson provided (and the leads within those leads), for some MRSYunits which appear according to the notes to lack par allel passages in rabbinic literature outside of Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael do indeed have such parallels. For example, parallels in, inter alia, the two Talmuds and Bereshit Rabbah to the lengthy unit about the Israelites' prayer at pages 96-97 (paras. 7.A-0) can only be identified by following the references to versions of Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael that Nelson provided in note 92. But again, this is a small point in comparison with the invaluable resource the annotation effort will prove to be overall to scholars both within and outside the field of rabbinics. In sum, despite the various small points raised here, Nelson's critical intro duction to, and annotated translation of, MRSY is an important new addition to the scholarly editions that must be consulted by scholars of rabbinics or other scholars doing research in rabbinics. This edition also has the potential to stimulate fresh scholarly interest in the study of this understudied tannaitic compilation, and consequently deserves wide scholarly attention. Alyssa M.
