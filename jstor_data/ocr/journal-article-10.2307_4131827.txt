<plain_text><page sequence="1">Steven Nadler. Spinoza's Heresy: Immortality and the Jewish Mind. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. 236 pp. On July 27, 1656, the Jewish community of Amsterdam expelled Baruch de Espinoza. As Josef Kaplan's work has shown, the community used herem as a stan- dard disciplinary instrument, usually on a temporary basis. In Spinoza's case, how- ever, the Amsterdammers issued a fierce and permanent denunciation on grounds of "abominable heresies" and "monstrous deeds." Speaking for the community, the rabbis "excommunicate, expel, curse and damn" him with formidable intensity. In addition to forbidding contact with Spinoza himself, the herem concludes with a prohibition against reading "any treatise composed or written by him." What were these heresies and deeds, and why was the herem so harsh? Only twenty-three years of age, Spinoza had not yet, so far as we know, begun to write the philosophical works-the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus (1670) and the Ethica (1677), the for- mer published anonymously, the latter only posthumously-that would to make him notorious well beyond the domain of the Portuguese Jews. Looking at the lat- er texts, it is not difficult to imagine the cause of the outrage: Spinoza denies cre- ation and divine providence, individual or personal immortality (together with the doctrine of eternal reward and punishment), and the truth of the Torah. But what exactly was Spinoza doing in the mid-1650s, and why were his ideas and actions so offensive to the community? "It is," Nadler writes, "a splendid mystery" (p. 1). For Nadler, the mystery is not so much what Spinoza's views were; contemporaneous reports indicate that the young Spinoza's views were of a piece with the obvious heterodoxy of his mature works. Rather, the mystery is why the Amsterdam community responded as it did. Nadler pursues this question primarily in terms of the community's internal dy- namics and leading figures, and secondarily in terms of its sensitivity to the Dutch political scene, which, while broadly tolerant, was not without its powerful con- servative Calvinist figures. Nadler's thesis is that Spinoza's denial of personal im- mortality was the decisive factor in his expulsion. While this denial was undoubt- edly repugnant to Christians and so in violation of the Jews' compact with the city, Nadler's real argument is that the specific history and sensibilities of the Amster- dam Sephardim and their rabbis are the more important factors. The immortality 183</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews of the soul was "simply the wrong issue to pick on in Jewish Amsterdam in the 1650s" (p. 156). As a community of Iberian exiles, the Amsterdam community had many ex-conversos and descendants of conversos, as well as many members with family and associates still living as Catholics in Spain. The Amsterdam Sephardim thus had very personal and direct reasons to be concerned about apostasy and its ramifications for their place in the World to Come. Although the community was divided about the exact nature of the postmortem fate of such individuals-its leading rabbis, Saul Levi Mortera and Isaac Aboab da Fonseca disagreed about the meaning of the statement "All Israel has a place in the world to come"-it was unanimous in affirming personal, individual immortality. Nadler makes the addi- tional, valuable point that former Catholics, having recently abandoned a highly eschatological creed, would easily have imported an eschatological orientation or agenda into their new or renewed Jewish lives. On this issue, it is essential to em- phasize that Jews as well as Christians were affected by the condemnations and controversies inspired by Averroes' account of Aristotle, whose philosophical prin- ciples he took to preclude personal immortality. From Bishop Tempier's condem- nations in the 1270s through such Renaissance controversies as the Pompanozzi affair and into the seventeenth century, the question of the immortality of the soul is urgent both philosophically and politically. Nadler helpfully surveys the history of Jewish understandings of hish'arut hanefesh in order to underline the question of why personal immortality occa- sioned the expulsion of Spinoza but not, for example, Moshe Narboni or Joseph Albo. Nadler quite rightly links Spinoza to Maimonides and Gersonides, and he joins the company of scholars who argue that Spinoza represents a culmination and/or radicalization of trends in medieval Jewish Aristotelian philosophy. While specialists will disagree on how to interpret these giants of medieval philosophy- not to mention how to interpret Spinoza's own very difficult texts!-a great virtue of Spinoza 's Heresy is its accessibility. In it, Nadler fulfills his promise to separate the "technical trees" from the "programmatic forest" (p. 148). He brings the Jew- ish sources to the attention of students of early modern philosophy, who have tend- ed, lamentably, to read Spinoza against an exclusively Christian backdrop, and he brings the major themes and import of Spinoza's philosophy, particularly the Eth- ica, to the attention of the Jewish studies community, which has tended to focus on the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus. As for the distinctive thesis that Spinoza's denial of personal immortality accounts for the vehemence of the herem, Nadler's case is provocative and subtle. He is surely correct to build on work by Altmann, Kasher and Biderman, and others in order to emphasize the centrality of questions of the postmortem fate of the soul. How it came to be, if we follow the view of an- other Amsterdam rabbi central to the Spinoza affair, Menasseh ben Israel, that be- lief in the immortality of the soul is the basis for belief in the existence of God and the divine origin of the Torah, deserves further study. One hopes that others follow Nadler's example of interdisciplinary inquiry in deciphering this history. Julie R. Klein Villanova University Villanova, Pennsylvania 184</page></plain_text>
