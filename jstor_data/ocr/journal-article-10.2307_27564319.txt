Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2005. 153 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000803 Like many open-minded but skeptical readers of Edward Said, I have long been disconcerted by a number of blind spots and omissions in his Orientalism (1978), insofar as his critique of the Orient's "imaginative geography" fails to con sider either representations of or the positions of Jews in Occidental culture. Said's work utterly ignores the deep empathy for Arab and Islamic culture expressed in late 421</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Jewish European scholarship, let alone the works written by early Zionist writers in Palestine who sought to build bridges to the indigenous people. Fortunately, Yaron Peleg's slim study, which focuses largely on critical lit erary developments in the Hebrew revival from 1900 to 1930, offers a number of profoundly useful ways to counter this significant gap. Peleg joins a new gener ation of Israeli critics, such as Judd Ne'eman, who have begun to argue for the need to perceive that "one of the roots of Zionism ... that has not been appropri ately recognized was a hidden identification of the European Jew with Arab Islamic peoples." Ne'eman notes that this was hardly a peripheral movement; no less a figure than Martin Buber observed that "while adopting the customs and the languages of their hosting peoples, [European Jews] have nevertheless considered themselves historically the children, and sometimes even natives, of the Near Eastern Orient. The sensibility of the Orient that the Jews always pre served in their hearts has become the deepest foundation of Jewish self consciousness." In Ne'eman's nuanced analysis, he finds a striking contrast between Buber's observation regarding the Jewish affinity for the East (his claim that it is "the deepest foundation of Jewish self-consciousness") and Said's perception that Eur opeans consistently assume "a position of irreducible opposition to a region of the world it considered alien to its own ... failing to see it as a human experience."1 Peleg's Orientalism and the Hebrew Imagination constitutes a marvelously nuanced and thoroughly cogent explication of this paradigm. In an important sense, it is, above all else, a sympathetic but rigorously honest analysis of the sometimes poignant ways in which Zionist writers sought to establish their "nativeness" in Palestine. In a lucidly written and meticulously researched introduction and four altogether illuminating chapters (with such evocative titles as "The Hebrew Bible as an Orientalist Text" and "Out of the Book and into the Desert: The Inven tion of a Native Hebrew Culture in Palestine"), Peleg proves remarkably adept at situating the idiosyncrasies of literary texts against the political developments that surrounded their composition. Aptly enough, Peleg begins with contemporary descriptions of Theodor Herzl's dashing public appearances in the 1890s, which, in their exoticized imagery, "seem to have internalized the common Euro pean view that classified [Jews] as Orientals" (5). As Peleg notes, there are numer ous illustrations of the period in which the Viennese Jew was depicted as an Orientalist prince or king. His first chapter addresses the earliest modem Hebrew assertions of the Jewish rootedness in the East. Chapter 2 offers a care fully contextualized exploration of David Frishman's important anthology Bamid bar (In the Wilderness), a work that struggled to create a coherent confluence of the sensibility of the Hebrew Bible with the culture and psychology of the New Jew. 1.

A. Arielli's 1913 drama, Allah Kariml (alongside other seminal works), in which the Arab village of Palestine is ridic uled as a backwater that resembles nothing so much as the equally parochial Jewish shtetl of eastern Europe. Among the writers Peleg examines, Arielli seemed to cast the most scorn on the wistful and Utopian tendencies of Oriental Romanticism. Particularly worthy is Peleg's fascinating and fresh approach to the writer Moshe Smilansky in Chapter 3. For Peleg, Smilansky, who published his Arabian Sons under the pseudonym Hawaja Moussa, seems to represent the quintessence of the naively romantic and Utopian portrayal of the Jewish-Arab encounter. One of the more interesting of the earlier writers considered here is surely Yehuda Steinberg, bom in Moldavia in 1863. For Peleg, Steinberg's In the Days of the Judges, a novella published in the early 1900s, reads as a fascinating prequel to the book of Ruth that nostalgically "glorifies the nomadic way of life and the proximity to the wilderness," curiously opposing the "biblical trajectory, which emphasizes the development of the Israelites from nomads to settled farmers" (27). Throughout this analysis and subsequent discussions, Peleg ably steers us through the complicated and sometimes contradictory ways in which the modem Hebrew Orientalist imagination drew on "Arab folklore, biblical language and motifs" and, above all, "the notion of a return to nature" (30). Inter estingly, many of the writers associated with the Hebrew revival never actually visited, let alone settled in Palestine. This critical factor seems to have inspired some of these figures' more Utopian representations of a new society that they ima gined might seamlessly align itself with the biblical past and the surrounding Arab culture. As Peleg ruefully concludes of the works of two of the representative figures of this period, "their works remained na?ve and for the most part simplistic, and they ignored some of the major problems that inhered in Zionism" (32). On the other hand, even when the revivalists (especially those of the 1920s) chose not to imagine the new life of the small Jewish settlements, their shtetl characters often seem to be drawn against the template of biblical archetypes. Peleg identifies a particularly evocative exemplar in David Frishman's short story "Red Heifer," wherein "a group of shtetl butchers, possessed by the spirits of their ancient, Near Eastern forebears, violently slaughter a cow as if they were ... Canaanite 'priests' ... before the altar" (33). In this regard, Peleg finds a remarkable number of Jewish protagonists who are not only fully at home in Palestine but whose physical appearance is invariably a blend of "ancient Hebrew" and "Bedouin" traits. On the other hand, Peleg is also attentive to writers who were far less sanguine about the relations between Arabs and Jews. Of these, Y H. Bren ner's (b. 1881) scathingly pessimistic perspective was representative of a compet ing literary tradition that dismisses "any romantic notion of affinity between Jews and Arabs, demanding a realistic consideration of the East and recognition of its hostility" (37). As if in sobering confirmation, Brenner was murdered by Arabs in 1921. Peleg writes of these early writers with sympathy and keen critical insight and does a fine job of including pertinent biographical material without overwhelming the reader. 423</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews Less effective, by far, is the concluding section, titled "The Legacy of Hebrew Orientalism," which attempts to examine the afterlife of the Zionist Orien talist sensibility in a scant sixteen pages but ultimately gives short shrift to a number of important contemporary writers (Matal?n, Sheked, and Yehoshua, among others) of both Ashkenazi and Mizrahi descent. Here, readers who were impressed by the sustained analysis and terrific close readings of earlier chapters may be disappointed by the unnecessarily rushed and underdeveloped discussion. At its best, this cursory chapter gestures to a beckoning space that may be addressed by future scholars (including Peleg, one would hope). A major disap pointment is the shoddily constructed index, which omits not only major concep tual categories and tropes such as "Romanticism" and "Bedouin," which figure throughout the work, but also, even more inexplicably, a writer such as Smilansky (who is, after all, central to the study). Aside from occasional repetitions, there are too many instances in which Peleg's "Orientalism" seems to be merely a con venient label rather nebulously applied to a great many disparate discursive strands that do not truly warrant that label. And Peleg too frequently retraces the work done by other recent cultural scholars of the "New Jew" of Palestine, such as Oz Almog in The Sabra: The Creation of the New Jew. But by and large, Orientalism and the Hebrew Imagination is a splendidly written and lively introduction to important developments in the early Hebrew canon of Jewish Palestine. I find it especially admirable that the author manages to be generous to some of the major Hebrew critics, such as Hanan Hever and Gershon Shaked, as well as to demonstrate his critical distance from earlier para digms when necessary. Peleg delivers not only his excellent translations of literary passages that startle and provoke on many levels (frequently from texts completely unfamiliar to English readers) but also provides the reader with brilliant close read ings. He should be congratulated for an erudite study that is written with marve lous clarity and infectious passion. Alongside other recent works, such as Martin Kramer's The Jewish Discovery of Islam and Ivan Davidson Kalmar and Derek J. Penslar's Orientalism and the Jews, this work deserves to be regarded as a very worthy tool for the burgeoning analysis of the Jews and Orientalism.2 In providing us with a deep understanding of the intriguingly conflicted yearnings of the Hebrew revival, which the author manages to present with infectious sense of affection as well as critical distance, Peleg has provided an even more valuable service.
