Vol. 1: Formalism and Flexibility in Jewish Civil Law. Vol. 2: Beyond Equity: Halakhic Aspirationism in Jewish Civil Law. Library of Jewish Law and Ethics, vols. 15 and 18. Hoboken: Ktav Publishing House, 1991. xxx, 324 pp.; lxiii, 238 pp. The rise of Jewish nationalism, alongside the major cultural accomplish- ment of the rebirth of vernacular Hebrew, has spawned an interest in certain circles in the revival of Jewish law with the aim of incorporating it into Israeli legal practice. Jewish law, as understood in this context, is not identical with halakhah. First of all, it excludes those vast areas of the halakhah which are strictly religious in nature and have no part in a modern legal system, such as matters of ritual and religious observance. Second, it does not assume that halakhah can be used in its traditional form in a modem legal setting. It would have to be redefined and reorganized under rubrics common to other legal systems and familiar and accessible to today's jurists. Third, the authority behind the law would not be the Torah and its divine lawgiver, but the state. It is not the rabbis who would define the practical implications of the law, and their rules for doing so would not necessarily apply. The entire history of Jewish law would be relevant in adapting it to, and incorporating its insights into, modem usage. Thus, there is a strong comparative and historical bent to the study of Jewish law as a modem discipline. To accommodate this new concept a new term has been coined in Hebrew, mishpat ivri. The two volumes under review, presented as companion volumes bearing the common primary title Equity in Jewish Law, are an example of a study in 265</page><page sequence="2">266 SAMUEL MORELL mishpat civri. So the author tells us explicitly, consciously distinguishing it from halakhah (vol. 1, p. xxii). But equity, the subject of the study, deriving, as we shall see, from a source of morality beyond the law itself, borders precisely on those aspects of Judaism which are more strictly religious in nature. The author has recourse time and again to areas of the halakhah which are generally excluded from the parameters of mishpa.t ivri. It is the nature of the material which continuously brings us back to the religious roots of Jewish law. Equity refers to that part of the legal system which strives to bring the application of the received law into consonance with the requirements of justice. Although the author tells us that the term "equity" has no equivalent in Rabbinic Hebrew, he is quick to point out that the concept certainly exists. It is his purpose to explicate the means by which it functions and to trace its scope within the halakhic system: "We undertake an examination of Jewish law in order to find therein analogues to equitable activity as found in other legal systems" (vol. 1, p. xxix). In the first chapter of volume 1, the author provides an introduction to the concept of equity in which he explores the reasons for the gap between law and justice. Aristotle, he tells us, explained that a law is a general statement, whereas justice must take cognizance of the individual case. Kirschenbaum broadens the source of the problem by pointing out that "the law may lead to hardship, injustice or absurdity because of its inordinate obsession with external forms, because of its excessive emphasis upon rigorous logic, or because of its total disregard of the results of its fulfillment" (p. 17). The programmatic statement cited above derives from volume 1, and indeed the title Formalism and Flexibility is an apt description for what the author presents in that volume. One section of his analysis deals with talmudic examples in which judicial discretion is countenanced. Among these are the case in which the accepted rules of procedure were changed by the judge ad hoc on the basis of his suspicion that the normal rules would result in intimidation (e.g., the case of Mari bar Isaq); the right of the judge to refuse to rule if he personally felt that an injustice was being perpetrated with the appearance of legality (din merummeh); the exploitation of technicalities and legal constructions to frustrate improper but technically legal behavior (e.g., hafqa'at qiddushin); the incorporation of compromise within the parameters of the law itself. Another section deals with the use of legislation to bring the law into line with the requirements of equity. There are two foci here:</page><page sequence="3">THE RELIGIOUS DIMENSION OF JEWISH CIVIL LAW 267 (a) legislation supporting the notion that one should not insist on one's formal rights when the result is of no consequence to oneself but of great consequence to another (kofin Cal middat sedom and zeh neheneh ve-zeh lo" haser); (b) legislation, putatively based on the verse "Do what is right and good in the sight of the Lord" (Deut. 6:18), which infringes on one's legal right to dispose of personal property as one wishes. A third section (second in the order presented) examines the influence of equity as a principle of interpretation, specifically the concept that the ways of the Torah are "ways of pleasantness' (cf. Prov. 3:17) as a principle in interpreting biblical and rabbinic enactments. Here the flexibility is manifest in the option of deciding among conflicting interpretations, a decision influenced by considerations of equity. As indicated by the title of the volume, Kirschenbaum is primarily interested in stressing the areas of flexibility within the halakhic system. His treatment of each subject is thorough, beginning with an analysis of the talmudic position regarding it and following its post-talmudic development. Sometimes, however, the author is distracted by the maze of detail, as if his main purpose were an analysis of the subtleties of the talmudic discussion and the resultant law per se. He thus allows the reader's attention to drift away from the focus on equity and judicial flexibility. Chapter 5, "The Kofin Rule and the Zeh Neheneh Principle," is particularly prone to this tendency. Some chapters have summaries, which are very useful for refocusing the reader on the central thesis, and the book would have profited if that technique had been employed consistently. More important, however, sometimes the author himself seems to be distracted from his overall purpose. Thus, perhaps because of his preoccu- pation with successive issues individually, Kirschenbaum never formulates a generality which the attentive reader will himself realize, that in almost all of the major categories of equity discussed in volume 1, post-talmudic developments curtailed the flexibility which he has so painstakingly docu- mented. Thus for din merummeh ("Post-talmudic rabbinical courts refrained from wielding this power and hesitated to deviate from the formal rules" [p. 81]); for annulment of betrothal ("In sum, then, nullification as a method of coping with illegal or improper acts . . . is relatively unusual" [p. 102]); for mipnei darkhei shalom and mishum 'eivah, which have no independent power as halakhic considerations beyond the examples in the Talmud itself (pp. 153-158); for kofin Cal middat sedom and zeh neheneh ve-zeh lo' haser ("In</page><page sequence="4">268 SAMUEL MORELL effect, [the interpretations of Rabbenu Tam and Maharam of Rothenburg] resulted in a severe curtailment of the Kofin and Zeh neheneh rules and their impact upon everyday Jewish life in the Middle Ages" [p. 211]); for the two talmudic rules based on "Do what is right and good in the sight of the Lord," i.e., shuma hadra le'olam ("Post-talmudic authorities also limited the returnability of the debtor's property collected on the judgment debt" [p. 258]), and dina de-var mezra ("Additional restrictions ... are to be found throughout the post-talmudic literature" [p. 265]). Equity, mediating as it does between law and justice, relies on a notion of justice which is independent of the law, and in light of which the law itself is to be appraised. Kirschenbaum discusses the concept of "natural law" as a basis for equity in other legal systems. It is one of the central theses of these two volumes that in Jewish law the basis for equity derives from the very nature of halakhah as religious in nature, the law of a religion shaped by the prophet as well as the lawgiver, and ultimately holding man personally responsible for his actions before God. Thus, the directive "Do what is right and good in the sight of the Lord" is part and parcel of the halakhic system itself, and not a standard imposed upon it from the outside. But, whereas equity is grounded in a sense of justice and fairness in human relations, the notion of accountability to God carries with it a different kind of standard, one which is defined by personal obligation without regard to mutuality and fairness. Kirschenbaum describes the legal system which expresses this stance as "duties-oriented," as opposed, say, to Anglo-American law, which is oriented toward rights and remedies. Halakhah, with one eye constantly on the God looking over one's shoulder, calls for ceding to others more than what equity would require. That is the subject of the second volume in the set, appropriately bearing Beyond Equity as the main part of its title. The neologism in the subtitle, "aspirationism," refers to the religiously motivated drive to aspire to standards higher than those required by the law.' The organizing principle of Beyond Equity is the notion that commendable acts beyond the requirements of the formal law are distributed in a range with regard to their enforceability. At one end of the spectrum are acts of unusual piety which are not expected of ordinary people; at the other end are those which began as supererogatory acts but evolved into normative and fully enforceable law. The core of the volume is divided into three chapters (chaps. 1. The term is apparently based on the phrase "morality of aspiration," coined by Lon L. Fuller, The Morality of Law (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1964), chap. 1.</page><page sequence="5">THE RELIGIOUS DIMENSION OF JEWISH CIVIL LAW 269 2, 3, and 4) dealing respectively with saintly behavior (middat hasidut), behavior "within the line of the law" (lifnim mi-shurat ha-din), and acts for which one is culpable only "in the laws of Heaven." Kirschenbaum examines each of these categories, paying close attention to their specific definitions and subcategories, their historical development, and especially the extent of their implications for enforceable law. Even without regard to the overall subject of equity, each of these chapters can stand on its own as a detailed and enlightening study of a very important feature of the halakhic system. Kirschenbaum's study is a significant contribution to the growing field of mishpa.t ivri. Its strength lies first of all in the identification and gathering of the disparate materials relevant to the subject of equity and supererogatory behavior. This in itself serves to debunk widely held misconceptions of the halakhah as being rigid and legalistic. The work is comparative in orientation, indicative of the author's solid competence in other legal systems and in legal theory. "Jewish law" for the author is chronologically inclusive, not ending with the Talmud or the rishonim, but including even contemporary decisions of the rabbinic courts in Israel. Certain chapters, as noted above, are important analyses of specific issues in Jewish law in their own right. For all these reasons the work is highly recommended. There are, however, a number of points which deserve comment. The first point is more a matter of form than of substance. We have before us two volumes described as "companion volumes," and they share a common primary title: Equity in Jewish Law. But there is evidence that in their genesis these two volumes were totally independent; that volume I was written well before volume 2, in fact not later than 1977; and that at the time volume 2 was composed, the simultaneous or earlier publication of volume 1 was not anticipated. This is evident, for instance, from the general lack of reference from one volume to the other, and from the free and unacknowledged borrowing of extended passages, sometimes with minor modifications, from the earlier volume to the later. The phenomenon is most glaring in the discussion of the concept of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din, literally, "within the line of the law," the term which refers to supererogatory behavior. The phrase is discussed first in volume 1, where the author provides a rather interesting and original insight into the conception implied by that idiom (p. 38). However, no reference to this insight is made in volume 2, where an entire chapter is dedicated to the subject. The discussion there is influenced by an interpretation suggested by Saul Berman in an article which appeared in</page><page sequence="6">270 SAMUEL MORELL two parts in 1975 and 1977, and which apparently supplanted Kirschenbaum's own interpretation. No reference to Berman appears in the text of volume 1, which means that it was not updated. (For a similar phenomenon, see the reference to the 1982-83 article by B. Lifshitz cited in vol. 2, p. xli, n. 69, which is missing in vol. 1.) There are attempts to join the two volumes together, but they are superficial only. The introduction to volume 2 is a synopsis of volume 1; the two specific references in volume 2 to volume 1 are in the notes of the concluding chapter. This history of composition can also explain the cumbersome titles of the volumes. The overall title, Equity in Jewish Law, seems to have been added to what were already independent titles and subtitles. Also more of form than of substance are matters of transliteration, bibli- ographical referencing, and indexing. Transliteration is the least significant, but it need be pointed out that it is idiosyncratic (e.g., tar'omette). Often there is an unjustified double s (e.g., kessef hassadim, assita, lo hasser [=haser]). One finds in the same sentence hiddur and meguneh (vol. 2, p. 12); in the same paragraph Reuven and Reuben (vol. 1, p. 228). There is a very useful bibliography at the beginning of each volume (the same one), entitled, "A Bibliography of Studies Related to Equity in Jewish Law," but there is no listing of works cited. This makes it difficult for the uninitiated to identify abbreviated references which occur in the notes after the first citation, or an unexplained acronym (vol. 1, p. 139, n. 345), or an omitted reference (vol. 2, p. 49, re: Hohlfeld). The situation makes it all the more important for the index to be complete. There are a number of indices, but at least the one entitled "Persons" is far from complete. There is, for instance, no reference to Boaz Cohen, who is referred to on a number of occasions, and who was an important influence on the author. Perhaps the notes were not indexed, but in light of the lack of a bibliography of works cited, they should have been. It is a difficult task to reduce talmudic discussions to their essential core and present them in translation to the uninitiated, and Kirschenbaum does an admirable, indeed enviable, job of that. But the process of simplification can sometimes lead to questionable formulations. For instance, hesed is defined broadly as encompassing all sorts of duties beyond the law in its strict sense; a "duty ... of piety and saintliness" (vol. 2, p. 8). In his discussion of the prohibition of interest, he shows that from the point of view of the rabbis, in contrast to that of the church, the taking of interest was not a violation of justice (zedek), since it came within the parameters of the freedom of</page><page sequence="7">THE RELIGIOUS DIMENSION OF JEWISH CIVIL LAW 271 contract. Instead, he argues, it falls within the parameters of hesed. But hesed is generally understood as relating to interpersonal matters, not to duties toward God, and the prohibition of interest, as Kirschenbaum himself states, "is conceived as religious," and in fact is included among the ritual prohibitions in the "Arbacah Turim code (vol. 2, p. 38). Thus, Kirschenbaum's broadening of the definition of hesed is not helpful. A similar broadening of a definition by way of simplification can be seen in his use of the term divrei soferim to include the totality of rabbinic activity, excluding only the plain sense of Scripture (vol. 1, p. 12). This is broader than the already broad Maimonidean definition of the term (contra vol. 1, p. 26, which implies that the two definitions are equal). Though the broader sense may be useful for him as a label for what he wishes to describe, it distorts the subsequent discussion, which cites references to divrei soferim understood in a more conventional way (cf. p. 14, on the relative merits of divrei soferim and divrei torah). Occasionally the author's desire to make a point pushes him too far. For instance, I would disagree with the applicability of the two-male-witnesses rule to some of the examples he brings on pp. 78-81 as exceptions. Rava's wife was not functioning in the capacity of a formal witness; the bitter waters and the case of the cagunah are special instances, and cannot be generalized to other situations; the one who is to be believed about the new moon is not the witness to the sighting of the moon, but the messenger sent by the court to inform outlying communities. However, all these points are of minor significance. Seen as a whole, both volumes are a valuable and indispensable contribution to the understanding of Jewish law and, beyond that, to the appreciation of the nature of Jewish religion.
