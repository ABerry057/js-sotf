<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ilana Pardes. Countertraditions in the Bible: A Feminist Approach. Cam- bridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1992. x, 194 pp. Feminist approaches to religious studies have so frequently met hostility from within and without religious and academic communities that many feminist religious scholars have turned largely away from the canonical texts like the Hebrew Bible, instead creating and recreating the sources and resources of a religious culture perceived to be more hospitable to feminism. Some feminist literary critics, however, considering the Bible rather than religious practices derived from it, have found traces of hospitality in the text. In this tradition, Ilana Pardes's rewarding book Countertraditions in the Bible: A Feminist Approach explores "the tense dialogue between the dominant patriarchal discourses of the Bible and counter female voices which attempt to put forth other truths" (p. 4). Pardes interprets a range of texts from the Hebrew Bible, referring to the original Hebrew as well as various English translations. Noting, for example, that most women in the Bible are not shown as well-developed characters, Pardes discusses Ruth, a rare exception to this general rule. Pardes calls her "doubly other-both a foreigner and a woman. As such, her honorable incorporation within the house of Israel calls for a different perception of this house and a greater recognition of its female 'builders"' (p. 99), for though</page><page sequence="2">380 BOOK REVIEWS the marriage to Boaz marks her inclusion within Israelite society, Ruth never loses the name of a foreigner: she "remains 'Ruth the Moabite' until the very end" (p. 115). Pardes demonstrates just how other this woman Ruth is by showing that the book's author or authors describe Ruth's relation to Naomi, her mother-in-law, with the word "cling," sometimes translated as "cleave," the same Hebrew term used to describe the relation between a man and a woman in Genesis 2:24. Pardes argues that the book of Ruth thus challenges Genesis, showing a relationship between two women as interdependent as that between a man and a woman, and not primarily involving rivalry, as do the relationships between Rachel and Leah, and Sarah and Hagar. The Song of Songs presents an even sharper challenge than Ruth to tradi- tional interpretations of biblical women. Pardes points out "the conspicuous absence of God; the lack of national themes; and the daring erotic character of the dialogue between the two lovers," as well as "another deviant feature. . . the Song's antipatriarchal bent" (p. 118). She speculates on how allegorical readings may have made the Song's eroticism and antipatriarchalism palatable, even attractive. Allegorical interpretations of the male lover as God and the female lover as the Israelite nation may have made the Song's eroticism acceptable in a religious context (pp. 122-126). Similarly, Pardes argues, "the antipatriarchal model of love in the Song" may have "function[ed] as a countervoice to the misogynist prophetic degradation of the nation" (p. 127), for prophets represent the covenant as a relation between Israel the unfaithful wife and God the superior husband, but the Song shows a relation between two more nearly equal partners. While her interpretations of such stories are persuasive and interesting, they do not provide an integrated approach to the Hebrew Bible as a whole or indicate whether Pardes considers such an approach possible or desirable. The absence of an articulated, overarching approach, combined with the heterogeneity of her critical terms, often allows those terms to retain traditional patriarchal implications, seemingly contradicting her stated interpretive goals. For example, she writes that the narrator of Ruth privileges "not the all-powerful father, but an adored mother. What the Book of Ruth thus completes in its rewriting of Genesis is the possible impact of the preoedipal phase on women's relations" (p. 103). Preoedipal implies an oedipal phase to come, and Ruth does end with a traditional father-to-son genealogy pointing toward David, the predominant male monarch in the Hebrew Bible. Yet the genealogy and the male-centered events that follow the book of Ruth need not dictate the descriptive terms Pardes applies to</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 381 it. "Preoedipal" places the book of Ruth firmly within an oedipal teleology, but Ruth's own irreducible foreignness indicates that the book resists such inclusion. A term such as "heteroglot," which Pardes briefly discusses (p. 4), might better acknowledge the powerful, anomalous character of this book than a term like "preoedipal." Pardes's choice of translations likewise refers to a system of interpretation that does not always coincide with her own. Her well-founded reservations about the dangers of uncritically using Christian concepts to describe elements of the Hebrew Bible might have precluded her general reliance on the King James Version, long the dominant Christian translation in the English-speaking world but by no means the most accurate rendering of the Hebrew Bible. These difficulties notwithstanding, Pardes's stimulating, intelligent analy- ses provide rewarding feminist challenges to more traditional ways of reading the Bible and hone our ability to hear voices and narratives we may be tempted to neglect.
