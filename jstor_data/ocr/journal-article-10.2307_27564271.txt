Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 337 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000335 This is a fascinating book. James M. Scott successfully makes the case that geographic matters should be given more attention when studying ancient texts. He maintains that a particular view of the world?its shape, boundaries, and the borders of its inhabitants?developed in Jewish circles based on the book of Genesis but also influenced by then-current Greco-Roman views. This tradition is particularly evident in Jubilees 8-9, which presents an interpretation of the 182</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Table of Nations from Genesis 10. The central thesis of Scott's book is that the passage in Jubilees, which may have been drawn from a lost book of Noah, had a great influence on later Jewish and Christian works. The book consists of seven studies that are interrelated but are written in such a way that each can be comprehended alone. Each chapter ends with a helpful summary of conclusions. One does not have to read far to see that Scott is in good control of a vast body of current scholarly research. Chapter 1 sets the stage for the book by examining an epigram of Philip of Thessalonica from the first century CE. The epigram refers to a tapestry consisting of a map of the world made by a certain woman named Karpos and sent to Caesar (either Tiberius or Caligula). Scott argues that because Karpos is not a woman's name, the text must be emended. The best candidate is Kypros, the wife of Agrippa I and granddaughter of Herod the Great. If so, Scott suggests that Kypros's map is an indication of Jewish interest in cartography, and he further suggests the possibility that it may have combined Jewish and Roman conceptions of the shape of the world. Chapter 2 gets to the heart of this study, which is the book of Jubilees. Scott suggests that Jubilees 8-9 represents a Jewish view of the world in which Noah divides the oikoumene into areas and gives them to his sons for their possession. Because Noah had three sons, there are three regions, neatly corresponding to the three zones of human habitation commonly mentioned in Greco-Roman sources. But instead of the middle zone being Delphi in Greece or Rome in Italy, the middle zone is here given to Shem, thus producing a distinctly Jewish view of the world. In a certain sense, in Jubilees, Noah prefigures the role of Moses, who divided the Promised Land to the twelve tribes of Israel, but here Noah divides the whole world. In Chapter 3, Scott discusses the geographic features of Luke and Acts. He suggests that the genealogy in Luke 3:23-38 originally contained seventy-two names, partly based on Jubilees 8-9 and intended to provide a link to the idea common in both the Jewish and Greco-Roman traditions that there were seventy-two nations. Likewise, he proposes that the mission of seventy/seventy two (the textual tradition is divided and uncertain) was intended to indicate that the scope of Jesus' mission included all the nations, just as the choosing of the twelve apostles highlighted Jesus' mission to Israel. Here, he contends with other proposals that consider the mission of the seventy an imitation of Moses' appointment of seventy elders in Numbers 11. Acts is especially rich in geographic detail, and Scott notes that these details continually frame and reinforce the overall message of the book. From Acts 1:8, acknowledged by all as the key to the work as a whole, Scott gives careful atten tion to the statement of the resurrected Jesus that his disciples are to go to the "end of the earth" with his message. In the development of this statement, Luke pro ceeds to describe the spread of the Gospel in a northwesterly direction, indicating that Luke is dependent on the Table of Nations tradition. Scott proposes that Luke has ordered his material so that there are three missions outlined in Acts: the mission to Shem in Acts 2:1-8:25, the mission to Ham in Acts 8:26^40, and the mission to Japheth in Acts 9:1-28:31. 183</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews But this does not seem likely given the brevity of the description of the mission to Ham. Moreover, Scott acknowledges that there is no explicit mention of Noah or any of his sons in Acts at all (58). In light of this, it is difficult to believe that such a structure lies behind the ordering of Acts?all the more because Acts 1:8 so clearly suggests an alternative threefold division: the mission to Judea (1:1-6:7), the mission to Samaria (6:8-8:40), and the mission to the Gentiles (9:1-28:31). Even simpler is the division into the Petrine Mission (Acts 1-12) and the Pauline Mission (Acts 13-28). Of course, the Pentecost event, with its mention of the gathering together Jews from all parts of the earth, receives a good bit of attention. Scott proposes that Jubilees 6:15-19, which attributes the institution of the Feast of Pentecost to the covenant that God made with Noah and his sons, was understood by the author of Acts as indicating that the Noahide covenant was binding for the Gen tiles as well. In the light of this, the list of nations in Acts 2 stands for the hope that all nations would now turn back to their creator. Chapter 4 deals with a section of the Pseudo-Clementine Recognitions 1.27 71 that has been identified by some scholars as an originally independent source. Scott begins by making a new case for dating of this source to ca. 100-115 CE as opposed to sometime around 200 CE. He then provides a detailed review of the contents and structure of the material, suggesting parallels with Jubilees and Luke-Acts that indicate the latter were sources for the author of Recognitions 1..27-71. Chapter 5, on Theophilus of Antioch, proposes that the second-century apologist used Jubilees as a source for his geographic descriptions of the world. The case is built on circumstantial evidence that Theophilus may have been a Jewish Christian, that some statements in his work show similarities to material in Jubilees 8-9, and that there is a reference to a work referred to as "Genesis of the World." But the latter could be the scriptural book of Genesis. And because there are no direct quotations, one cannot mle out that the reference is to some otherwise unknown source. Scott does not consider this option. Chapter 6 deals with Hippolytus of Rome. On pages 140-45, he notes par allels between Jubilees and the Diamerismos of Hippolytus regarding the terri tories allotted to the sons of Noah. But except for the reference to Gadir in the boundaries of both Ham and Japheth, these are quite general and do not indicate literary dependence. In addition, the account in the Diamerismos is much shorter, and the vocabulary not very similar. Stronger is his observation that in the refer ence to Ham's territory, just as in Jubilees, there is no enumeration of lands belong ing to him, as there was in the description of Shem's territory. Chapter 7 concludes with a look at the medieval mappaemundi. Scott brings his work full circle by suggesting that the tapestry by Kypros may have marked a transition point in the merging of Jewish and Greco-Roman traditions. This, in turn, became a source for later medieval Christian thinking on the subject. Within the pages of Scott's volume, there is much that can be studied profit ably by those interested in the Bible and Second Temple Judaism. For example, Scott discusses biblical and Second Temple views concerning the role of the nations in eschatological thinking. His discussion of Christian attitudes toward 184</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews the Temple is worth considering. Though he acknowledged that Christian views of the Temple viewed sacrifice differently after the death of Jesus, he points out that the Temple did not lose all value. Indeed, if Scott's analysis is correct, then Jerusalem and the Temple remained the geographic and spiritual center for the Christian view of the world?but now the legitimate role of the Temple for the Christians was not as a place of sacrifice but as a house of prayer.
