Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 2005. x, 282 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000670 In the literature of Jewish mysticism, the Zohar remains the undisputed masterpiece?the gem of kabbalistic imagination whose allure and depth have attracted the sustained study of academics and traditional mystics alike. For modem scholarship, this extraordinary text has proven to be an unending wellspring of insights into kabbalistic theology, devotional experience, exegetical technique, and many other topics. In a manner unique to the history of Jewish mystical crea tivity, the Zohar has even shown itself to be the great convergence of literary artistry and symbolic homiletics, a weave of the poetic-fictional imagination and that of a theological hermeneutics. It would be no exaggeration to view the Zohar as one of those classic texts that each generation is drawn to interpret and reinterpret anew. It is just this creativity and nuance that is evident in Joel Hecker's first book, Mystical Bodies, Mystical Meals?a work of scholarship that makes a significant contribution to the field in the intersecting realms of ritual studies, performance theory, gender construction, conceptions of embodiment, and historical religious anthropology. Hecker's monograph is very well written, and the prose of scholar ship unfolds through an engaging typology of ritual practice and religious experi ence. The working frame for Hecker's study is the representation of eating as a spiritual practice in the Zohar and related works?a problematic that is used as a lens through which the interpreter of cultures may better understand the kabba listic perceptions of prescribed sacred behavior and the deeper meaning of such ritual practice. For as Hecker conceives of it, Kabbalah studies will benefit from a localization within the terrain of ritual studies?particularly within the dimen sion of performative ritual. This emerges as a central category insofar as the ritual dimension is rooted in an embodied and gender-structured matrix; as such, the enactment through the body (and with a particular attitude toward the body) serves as an axial point for the symbolic discourse. By way of zoharic reflections on the nature and meaning of holy eating, the researcher as exegete may view a religious anthropology in (textual) action, and the contours of ritual instruction, behavior, and interpreted meaning emerge in disclosure. 388</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Within the intellectual worldview of medieval Kabbalah, this anthropologi cal approach has broader implications for theological rumination, insofar as the human being is considered to be a microcosmic refraction of the divine self. What occurs in the realm of human embodiment both lends insight into the inner mysteries of Divinity and clarifies a taut relationship of mutual influence and correlation between the divine and human realms. Thus, the elements of con sumed sacralized food, conceptions of the human body as a receiver of such ideal ized and ordinary foods, the intentions prescribed for the rite of holy eating, and the activation of symbolically charged ritual gestures?all of these are understood to influence and disclose the truth of divine Being. In setting about this project, Hecker demonstrates extensive learning in the Zohar, as well as in the related kab balistic and rabbinic literatures. His use of textual examples and documentation is broad, conveying a reading of the sources that is drawn from a wide study of this challenging text. This in itself is no small matter, as will be evident to those who have spent sustained time with the zoharic corpus. What is more, Hecker employs a sophisticated use of modem theories and methods in the study of religious anthropology and performative ritual. This fusion of nuanced textual scholarship with the creativity of contemporary methodologies adds notable strength to the finished product of Hecker's research. In moving from the general to the particular, I shall now single out several core motifs and observations that characterize and mark Hecker's book?a configuration that should underscore the range of insights presented by the author. First, we may note a recurring trope in which a tension and interplay between physical and spiritual nourishment is manifest. Within a worldview in which everything physical and mundane is also a sign and marker of supernal divine realities, the corporeal act of eating emerges as one among many physical behaviors in which ritual sanctifica tion comes to embody divine secrets and tmths in an earthly garb. The physical pro cesses, charged with the accompanying benedictions and physical gestures, are correlated with the exalted inner dynamics of the divine Being, and the actions of the lower world?rooted in the materiality of ideal sacred foods?function as talis mans for the drawing down of divine energies through the cosmos (these dynamics of theurgical empowerment, encoded and activated in the ritual meal, are studied in detail by Hecker in Chap. 5 and 6). Indeed, in the performance of sacred eating, the human being is transformed into a conduit for the flow of divine energy into the lower world. The physical rite, as embodied in the ingestion of an ideal holy food, serves as a portal into the mystical encounter with Divinity?a union with a particular sefirah (4) or an induction into a deeper understanding and awareness of the esoteric secrets of Being (99). The kabbalist's state of knowledge?and by extension, his contemplative connection to the divine realm?is altered and elevated through the consumption of such a paradigmatic food (102). In this manner, spiritual experience and mystical insight occur through the embodied physical experience of eating. The ritual that involves the body emerges as an entryway into the divine, as opposed to the rigorous detachment from the flesh found in many kabbalistic rendi tions of the ascetic ideal (115; see also the author's comments on p. 175). In another related trope, documented and considered by Hecker, the ritual event of sitting at the table of physical feast functions as a performative act of 389</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews engaging with the Shekhinah, preparing her for erotic union with Tiferet in and through the corporeal process (110). In such a conception, the dramatic physical gestures linked to the event of eating are understood to bear marked symbolic associations and theurgical consequences. This conception of the very physical act of eating is juxtaposed in Hecker's analysis against a kind of substitute consumption?a representation of ultimate spiritual nourishment as the mystical state of direct connection to the supernal realm. The eating of a physical ideal food is correlated to an ingestion of Torah itself, a consumption that is here deeply spiritualized (103). Such spiritual ingestion is constructed as nourishing and satisfying?a "physical nourishment through mystical experience" (88). This trope inevitably suggests itself as a reverberation of the ascetic ideal, insofar as a state of powerful kavvanah, a condition of divine infusion, has greater power to bestow the physical state of satiation, and certainly nourishes on a spiritual level (see 43-44, 68). Spiritual transformation is characterized through the rhetoric of nourishment and satiety; the moment oigilui sodot (the disclosure of the Torah's secrets, which is the object of great desire on the part of the kabbalist) is itself under stood to be a source of spiritual nourishment for the hungry kabbalist (86). The performative dimension of mystical ritual is also, Hecker observes, fraught with theatricality?a characterization that is certainly indebted to the insights of various performance theorists, including the ritual theorist Victor Turner. This issue is developed by Hecker in primary regard to the theatrical nature of zoharic narrative, a context in which the mystical meal shared by the dis ciples of Shimon bar Yohai serves as a dramatic focal point for the dramatization of "affective performance" among the companions (130). The ritual event of sacred eating becomes a central venue for the deliberation on divine secrets (in parallel fashion to the more dominant zoharic narrative motif of walking and wandering through the Galilee), and the meal emerges as a setting for the representation of kabbalistic fellowship (118). In this manner, the social drama of the zoharic mystics is on vivid display through the interactive moment of ritual dining?a trope that Hecker compares to the Symposium of Plato (121). I am particularly inter ested in the implications of this reading of zoharic ritual theatricality, insofar as it relates to my own current research into the contours of the Zohar's dramatic narra tive. What are the techniques of theatrical construction and dramatic representation in this tale of the mystical hevraya, and through what methods do the zoharic authors fashion a drama of discipleship in which all fictional interaction and dialo gue leads in and out of the ultimate moment of esoteric disclosure, the revelation of secrets from master to disciple? For Hecker, the gestural uses of the body function as key elements in the Zohar's construction of theatrical ritual performance (136). The centrality of such physical enactment gives expression to particular states of emotion (131, 140, 141), and anchors the zoharic imagination of ritual in the inescapably embodied nature of mystical practice and the culture of interactive fellowship that is so fundamental to the epic tale of Rashbi and his circle. In conclusion, Joel Hecker has written a fine piece of scholarship?rooted in learned research and illuminated by a creative implementation of ritual and per formance theory. With clarity of discourse and typological discernment, Hecker has advanced the field in important new ways, offering an example to other 390</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews scholars of the ways in which Kabbalah may be studied productively through the lens of lived religion and historical anthropology.
