The Medieval Hebrew Encyclopedias of Science and Phi- losophy. Dordrecht: Kluwer, 2000. 547 pp. Interest in the tension between religion and science has become the focus of much recent scholarship not only in Christian but in Jewish circles as well. Per- haps nowhere is this attempt seen as clearly as in recent works dealing with cos- mology. Many recent books have attempted to reconcile contemporary views of creation with accounts found in scripture: for example, Samuelson's Judaism and the Doctrine of Creation (Cambridge, 1994), Matt's God and the Big Bang (Ver- mont, 1996), Schroeder's Genesis and the Big Bang (New York, 1990), and anal- ogous books from the non-Jewish perspective, such as Trefil's The Moment ofCre- ation (New York, 1983), and Davies' The Mind of God (New York, 1991). What these books have in common is the desire to harmonize accounts of creation that result from two webs of belief: religious and scientific. This struggle between "Athens and Jerusalem," between rational speculation and Torah-based study, has been replayed in every generation. At every stage in Jewish thought, Jews have tried to accommodate "secular" elements with their own thinking; these elements have included scientific paradigms, whether of Plato, Ptolemy, Aristotle, Copernicus, or of contemporary astrophysics. As a minority re- ligion within the larger context of a majority culture, be it Hellenistic, Islamic, the world of Enlightenment Europe, or most recent examples of modernity (and post- modernity), Jews have both rejected and adopted various aspects of these majori- ty civilizations. For generations of Jews the issue has thus been how to reconcile the content of the secular learning with that of religious knowledge. The very desire for accommodation reflects a particular attitude toward the relation between religion and science. Late-nineteenth-century historians of sci- ence would have us believe that science has been persecuted by religion: more specifically, that western science has been persecuted by the Catholic Church. In his enormously influential work History of the Conflict between Religion and Sci- ence (New York, 1874), John William Draper argued that the Church "became a stumbling block in the intellectual advancement of Europe for more than a thou- sand years." On this model, the history of scientific development was presented as a war against a narrow-minded establishment that feared science; the conflicts be- tween science and religion were seen as a one-sided affair in which the Church sought to suppress truth-seeking scientists. Jewish institutions were not castigated nearly as maliciously on this view (perhaps, the cynic may argue, because by this point in history Jews wielded so little power). It is important to remember, how- ever, that Jewish examinations of the religion/science debate are-for the most part-elaborated in counter-position to a not unrelated issue, namely the impact of secular Christian culture upon Judaism. Hence, whereas for the Christian the- ologian the question is unifold, namely, how to accommodate Christianity and modern scientific outlooks, for the Jew the question becomes more complex: how to accommodate Judaism to secularism, which itself has been infiltrated by Chris- tian influences. The accommodationist ground is reflected by the attempts of those serious Jews committed to their religious faith as well as the achievements of sci- ence to reconcile their faith with the secular learning surrounding them. 144</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews But can Judaism ultimately be reconciled with a web of scientific belief? This question underlies several recent edited collections by Langermann and Har- vey. Of the ten essays appearing in Langermann's volume The Jews and the Sci- ences in the Middle Ages, all but three have appeared as earlier publications. By collecting the essays, and adding three hitherto unpublished studies, Langermann offers a multi-faceted survey of the history of science in medieval Jewish com- munities. In the first of the new essays (Chapter One), Langermann explores the Rabbinic opposition to the study of science and suggests that the opposition of re- ligious authorities has to do in general with the aversion to secular studies that stands in the way of Talmud Torah. Concentrating first upon the works of Abra- ham bar Hiyya and Judah ibn Verga, Langermann highlights developments in med- icine, mathematics, and meteorology, and their incorporation into Jewish thought. Langermann then turns specifically to how scientific knowledge is integrated into the work of particular Jewish thinkers, namely Bahya ibn Paquda, Judah Halevi, and Hasdai Crescas. Influenced by Saadya Gaon, Bahya draws upon science and technology for many of his arguments and examples. Langermann argues that from Bahya's perspective "the harmony of religion and science is not controversial, but rather commonplace" (chpt. 1, p. 42). Bahya's comments are indications of "the high status of the sciences" in Andalusian society. Turning next to Judah Halevi, Langermann argues that the Cuzari was composed as a response to "the very suc- cessful integration of science and philosophy into Jewish life" (chpt. 1, p. 44). As a response to the challenge of both science and philosophy, Halevi offers in the Cuzari a "Jewish cosmology" steeped in Neoplatonic and Neopythagorean ontol- ogy, thus replacing the philosophy of the Greeks with an Isma'ili science. Turning finally to Crescas, Langermann argues that, in contradistinction to the standard view promulgated by Wolfson and Pines, Crescas "has no interest in the scientif- ic enterprise per se. He has no agenda for harmonizing the truths of science with sacred writ, nor does he hold to the dream of restoring the ancient, true, and unique Jewish science" (chpt. 1, p. 46). Hence it should not be surprising that his students did not continue in the area of science. Like the mutakalimun who also rejected Aristotelian science and replaced it with an occasionalist, atomist alternative, Langermann argues that Crescas was not interested in science for its own sake, but only for its theological implications (chpt. 1, p. 49). The second new essay (Chapter Two) is devoted to Sa'adya's connection to the sciences, while the third new essay (Chapter Four) pertains to Maimonides' view of astronomy. In this work Langermann returns to a subject explored in great detail in an earlier piece published in 1991 ("The True Perplexity," in J. L. Krae- mer, ed. Perspectives on Maimonides, Oxford, 1991), in which Langermann en- dorsed Pines' skeptical reading of a critical passage in Maimonides, Guide for the Perplexed, 11:24. Langermann now wants to reject instrumentalist readings of Mai- monides that claim that because it is impossible to determine which astronomical modeling devices are the true ones, therefore astronomy cannot hope to achieve anything more than useful computational instruments. Adapting the standard skep- tical response to agnostic readings of Maimonides, Langermann argues that "if Maimonides' agnosticism is so thoroughgoing, how could he possibly be so sure that the motions of the heavens are uniform, circular and so forth" (chpt. 4, p. 4)? 145</page><page sequence="4">AJS Review Other chapters in this volume are reprints of articles published between 1988 and 1993. These articles deal with scientific concerns in the works of ibn Ezra (as- trology), Nahmanides, Gersonides (action at a distance), Moses Isserles (physics, cosmology, and astronomy), and Mordekhai Finzi, as well as astronomical and med- ical manuscripts. These articles help to flesh out Langermann's overall thesis that Jews in the medieval and early modern period were very much engaged in areas of scientific discussion, and furthermore, that these scientific discussions were seen to be relevant to issues of Jewish belief. The relevance of scientific discovery to Judaism is explored further in two re- cent issues of Science in Context (1997); Issue 10:3, edited by Langermann and Gis- sis, is dedicated to Judaism and science in the medieval period, while Issue 10:4 is devoted to the modern period. I will focus upon 10:3, in which articles by Charles H. Manekin, Tony Levy, Ruth Glassner, J. L. Mancha, and Y. Tzvi Langermann ex- plore the interactions of medieval Jewish thought and scientific developments. Manekin discusses three medieval Hebrew translations of Peter of Spain's Tracta- tus, arguing that inasmuch as a grounding in logic was an aid for Jewish students wishing to become physicians and needing to interact with their Christian peers, this logical textbook became as popular among Jewish students as among Chris- tians. Tony Levy provides a much-needed portrait of the transmission of mathe- matics by thirteenth- and early-fourteenth-century Hebrew translators from Arabic sources; the texts include the writings of Euclid and Archimedes, as well as treatis- es on mathematical astronomy. Of special interest are Levy's speculations as to why these translations were undertaken by individuals who for the most part were not themselves mathematicians. Levy suggests that the translators (e.g., Jacob Anatoli, Moses ibn Tibbon, Jacob ben Makhkir, Qalonymos ben Qalonymos of Arles, and Samuel ben Judah of Marseilles) recognized the importance of these works in the Christian west and felt the necessity to make them available to a Hebrew reading public. More pointedly, for example, Jacob ben Makhir argued that Jews "have to learn from the example of the [other] nations ... these nations revered science and scholars without any concern from their religion. Has any nation yet changed its re- ligion through this?" (p. 445). It is to be hoped that in subsequent works Levy will detail further the use to which these translations were made. Glasner's article on Yeda'ya ha-Penini's conception of the void suggests a re- liance upon Christian sources for a peculiar view of void not found in Arabic- Hebrew sources. She positions Yeda'ya alongside the two "anti-Aristotelians" Nicholas of Autrecourt and Hasdai Crescas, both of whom rejected the tradition- al Aristotelian conception of the vacuum as being neither within, between, or out- side bodies. She suggests that this unconventional position might be traceable to Yeda'ya's conversations with scholastic contemporaries; in a similar vein, others (e.g., Pines) have already noted, for example, Yeda'ya's theory of individual forms, which reflects Scotus's concept of haecceitas. Finally, Mancha traces the the main stages of the Hebrew and Latin redaction of Gersonides' astronomical work Sefer Tekhuna, while Langermann introduces his analysis of Halevi, which is developed further in Judaism and the Sciences. All of these articles reinforce the fact that Jew- ish philosophers, clearly aware of developments in science, mathematics, and as- tronomy, made use of these developments and incorporated new scientific find- 146</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews ings into their own work. At the same time, these thinkers were very much aware of the implications of scientific advances with respect to maintaining the integri- ty of their religious worldview. This awareness on the part of Jews of new scientific advances in the world around them is the focus of Steven Harvey's collection The Medieval Hebrew En- cyclopedias of Science and Philosophy. This volume represents the proceedings of an international conference held at Bar Ilan University in January 1998. Although the focus of the conference was primarily upon Hebrew encyclopedias of the thir- teenth century, several papers deal with twelfth- and fourteenth-century encyclo- pedias, while others focus upon contemporaneous Arabic and Latin encyclopedias. As Harvey notes in his introduction, Hebrew medieval encyclopedias first appear at the moment when Hebrew was beginning to replace Arabic as the scientific lan- guage of the Jews; in many cases they represented the first direct contact with clas- sical and contemporary scientific and philosophical thinking. It is not easy, however, to determine exactly what counts as an encyclope- dia, since many of the authors did not present their works as such. For example, can an encyclopedia incorporate creative thought on the part of the author? How should an encyclopedia be read-as a reference, or from cover to cover? Must the encyclopedist necessarily be a popularizer? A tantalizing, but unanswered ques- tion, for example, is whether Maimonides' Mishneh Torah should be thought of as an encyclopedia. On the one hand, it is concerned primarily with Jewish law and not science and philosophy; on the other hand, as Woolf argues in his article, the comprehensiveness and "reader-friendliness" of the work underscores its close re- lation to other medieval encyclopedias. Perhaps the most we can hope for is a set of family resemblances among the various works that attempt, in one way or another, to systematize, survey and disseminate a large body of material to a large- ly non-technical audience. Surprisingly, however, there appears to be little influ- ence of the thirteenth-century Latin encyclopedias upon their Hebrew counter- parts. Both Voorbij and Albrecht discuss important differences between the two sets of works, the most important being that unlike Latin encyclopedias, Hebrew encyclopedias did not contain retrieval mechanisms such as headers and indices. Harvey is to be commended for including in the anthology several important ar- ticles (Voorbij, Albrecht, Biesterfeldt, and Butterworth) that help to situate the He- brew works in the context of their scholastic and Arabic counterparts. The earliest Hebrew encyclopedias of science and philosophy include the Yesodei ha-Tevunah u-Migdal ha-Emunah by Abraham bar Hiyya (see Rubio) and Levi ben Abraham of Villefranche's Livyat Hen. Zev Harvey provides a penetrat- ing examination of this latter work, which may have been written in order to pre- pare readers to grasp the science necessary to understand Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed. Several chapters are devoted to the three major Hebrew thirteenth- century encyclopedias written by Judah ben Solomon (see Fontaine), Shem-Tov Falaquera (see S. Harvey), and Gershom ben Solomon. Gershom ben Solomon's Sha'ar ha-Shamayim, analyzed in detail by Robinson, was by far the most popu- lar encyclopedia of the three. Other chapters consider more technical topics contained in the various ency- clopedias. Manekin surveys logic in the encyclopedias; mathematical sciences are 147</page><page sequence="6">AJS Review discussed by Levy; Glasner analyzes the question of celestial matter; Freudenthal and Langermann deal with astronomy and astrology; and Ivry and Zonta turn to the treatment of the psychology of the soul and metaphysics in a number of encyclo- pedias. Following two articles on Hebrew encyclopedias of the fourteenth century (see Eisenman) and the Renaissance (see Melamed), Harvey includes as an adden- dum an annotated translation, prepared by Manekin, of Steinschneider's ground- breaking 1880s work on Hebrew encyclopedias. This study is still of enormous bib- liographical interest, and scholars await with anticipation the translation of the complete work, which-thanks to Manekin's efforts-will include updated lists of the manuscripts mentioned by Steinschneider. The importance of these encyclopedias to an understanding of the develop- ment of medieval Jewish scientific advancement cannot be overestimated. In many cases, they represent the full presentation of Aristotelian science to medieval read- ers; as Harvey argues, the encyclopedists saw their task as one of "gathering and combining all available scientific knowledge into a single book" (p. 25). Thus these works tell us much about the status of medieval science. Yet there is much scholar- ship still to be done. Harvey notes in his introduction that one issue, discussed at the conference but not covered in the present volume, has to do with the piety and religious agenda of the encylopedists; one would hope that this issue will be exam- ined in subsequent studies. Although some of the research has commenced al- ready-works of Fontaine, Manekin, Jospe, and others-many of the encyclope- dias await further editing and analysis. Both Langermann and Harvey have made an admirably convincing case that there is a wealth of riches to be uncovered in our continuing understanding of the relation between Judaism and medieval science.
