<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Terry J. P. Prewitt. The Elusive Covenant: A Structural-Semiotic Reading of Genesis. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990. x, 146 pp. The book under review calls for a unified reading of the Book of Gene- sis. The author, an anthropologist by training, applies theories of structural anthropology to the Book of Genesis. He is interested in neither the form of the book nor the literary-stylistic shape of its ideas. Rather, Prewitt seeks to locate in Genesis patterns imposed by structural anthropology. Thus for him the genealogies in Genesis are not sporadic external lists but an integral source which signifies the thematic structure of the book. Similar themes of the various genealogies mark out the central thematic structure of Genesis. The thematic structure, rather than the plot and the inner content of the book, is Prewitt's means of searching the unity of Genesis. Furthermore, Prewitt applies Edmund Leach's theories of social symbol- ism to specific patterns which he claims signify Genesis. Leach argues that societies are divided into halves in alternating generations. Hence, Prewitt argues that the history of humankind in Genesis 1-11 is divided into two parallel cycles, each being constructed of ten generations. The first cycle begins with Adam and goes through Noah, while the second one ends with Terah. Now Terah is a traveler. He travels to the west (his destination is 89</page><page sequence="2">90 BOOK REVIEWS reached by his son Abraham). Noah is also a traveler: the ark floats on the waters of the flood. Consequently, argues Prewitt, the central theme of the Torah is traveling. Cain was the first to wander, Abraham wanders, Jacob wanders, and eventually the whole people of Israel wander. Furthermore, Abraham and Jacob fit the pattern of alternation in oppositions. Abraham travels to the west; Jacob travels to the east. Since Abraham's narrative is in the literary sense more compatible, Prewitt concludes that the Abraham cycle is imposed on the basis of the Jacob pattern by external manipulation. Our author presents an interesting analysis of the symmetrical arrange- ment of the Book of Genesis. Such a structural-anthropological and semi- otic reading is welcome in principle; an interdisciplinary reading of the Genesis discourse might indeed enrich our reading. However, Prewitt's study raises specific hermeneutical and methodological questions. We are flooded today by waves of publications proclaiming the unity of biblical narrative. The diachronic approach is under severe attack, and the call for a synchronic reading is heard loudly. Interestingly, many of the new voices calling for a synchronic reading are those of "invaders," that is, scholars who are not the so-called professional biblicists but rather are prominent literary critics, anthropologists, and so forth. It seems that the recent legiti- mization of synchronical studies invites "guests," who apply their own disciplines to the Bible. The result of this interaction is a split (with certain exceptions) between two factions in the area of biblical studies. A crater has been formed between professional biblical critics (those who perform source criticism and form-criticism) and the newcomers, who have established themselves in disciplines other than biblical scholarship. The latter group of critics call now for a synchronic reading of the Scriptures. The point, however, is that the diachronic approach does not deny the existence of Genesis as a book. The external unity of the book, even as a compiled composition, is a fact; the book has a plot, and the events progress chronologically. The question regarding the diachronic approach, however, pertains to the nature of the editorial process. Hence, the diachronic approach seeks to identify the texts (both oral and written) behind the present one. Nonetheless, since there is an irrefutable external unity (other- wise generations of readers would not have been able to read Genesis), inter- nal thematic parallels are, in fact, self-evident. Consequently, the argument for the internal unity of the book must respond to the cardinal question: Can we demonstrate the literary (not merely thematic) unity of the Book of Genesis? Therefore, due to the nature of the composition, the structural model</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 91 offered by Prewitt is imposed somewhat on the current text. The thematic parallels are dictated by the content of the book as a whole in its present condition, and not vice versa. Hence, the issues discussed by biblical critics are still valid: how the process of the arrangement took place, and which literary-rhetorical means have been employed in order to reach a unified reading of the Book of Genesis, or, perhaps, the book is in the end a single composition. The second alternative is an issue which must be discussed now in accor- dance with our fresh understanding of the nature of the narrative, thanks to recent literary studies. This is indeed a serious challenge for the diachronic approach: is the diachronic approach an anachronism? In conclusion, Prewitt offers a thematic structural model for the unifica- tion of Genesis. Nevertheless, his illuminating structural-anthropological- semiotic reading would benefit from supplementation by a sound literary model, a literary model that might strengthen his claim that the Book of Genesis displays a planned symmetrical arrangement.
