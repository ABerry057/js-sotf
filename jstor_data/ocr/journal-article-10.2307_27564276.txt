Ramat-Gan: Bar-Ilan University Press, 2003. 232 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000384 Since the dawn of Wissenschaft scholarship on the biblical commentaries of Rabbi Samuel ben Meir (Rashbam), a discrete group of scholars has dominated the field. In 1880, David Rosin wrote the definitive monograph on Rashbam's life and work; this monograph remains the starting point for all serious scholarship on Rashbam. Shortly thereafter, Rosin published what is still considered the standard edition of Rashbam's Torah commentary, together with an introduction and notes. Also working within the framework of Wissenschaft scholarship, Samuel Poznanski devoted an important chapter to Rashbam's exegesis in the fabled introduction that he composed on the northern French biblical exegetes. In con temporary research, Sara Japhet stands out as one of the dominant voices. Most notably, she has authored a comprehensive introduction to Rashbam's exegesis on Job, published alongside a critical edition of the commentary; this work follows the introduction to and edition of Rashbam on Koheleth that she published (together with Robert Salters) twenty years ago. Additionally, Japhet has produced a host of critical essays that have greatly advanced the study of Rashbam's biblical exegesis. In a different vein, Martin Lockshin has expertly translated Rashbam's Torah commentary into English and composed what amounts to a comprehensive supercommentary on it. All of these works must be considered seminal. Among this small coterie of scholars, Elazar Touitou has established himself as one of the premier students of Rashbam. Over the past twenty-five years, Touitou has published a series of important articles on Rashbam's biblical exegesis, in addition to many critical essays on other northern French exegetes (particularly Rashi). To this impressive catalog, Touitou now adds his crowning achievement, "Ha-peshatot ha-mithadshim be-khol yom." Based partly on his earlier studies, but by no means a simple rehashing or collection of previous articles, the volume under review is a thorough?and in many instances, an entirely new?examination of Rashbam's biblical exegesis (specifically, his Torah commentary). Touitou accomplishes this with an eye toward both the historical milieu of twelfth-century northern France and the literary-intellectual context of medieval rabbinic scholarship (in particular, Rashi's Torah commentary). Avraham Grossman has stressed the importance of rooting the development of peshat in northern France in three factors: the twelfth-century "renaissance," the 194</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews interdependent Jewish-Christian polemic, and the impact of the scholarship of Spanish Jewry on northern Europe. Touitou has published on some of these topics himself. Thus, it is fitting that the present volume?under the rubric "Back ground to the Development of Peshat Exegesis in Medieval France"?opens with three chapters devoted to the subject: "The Twelfth-Century Renaissance," "The Judeo-Christian Theological Debate," and "The Influence of the Sephardic Center." In these chapters, as throughout the volume, Touitou brings his earlier thinking up to date, revising and keeping his study in conversation with contem porary scholarship. Two chapters follow, also with the purpose of introducing Touitou's exam ination of Rashbam's Torah commentary. These studies, which are apparently completely new, treat Rashbam's approach to the main sources of Hebrew rabbinic exegesis, namely, rabbinic midrash and Rashi's commentaries. In these chapters, Touitou demonstrates his mastery of not only Rashbam's biblical commentaries but also his extant commentaries on the Babylonian Talmud. Of particular interest is Touitou's observation of Rashbam's comments concerning m?opan "nn\ "(apparent) superfluities in Scripture." Touitou writes, "In several places (in the Talmud commentary) Rashbam is careful to point out that 'not from the sense (of Scripture) is the (midrashic interpretation) established, but rather from the superfluity' In other words, it is only the explication of the superfluity ... that drives the Talmud toward its conclusion, whereas in the realm of context (peshat), i.e., 'the sense of Scripture,' the superfluous section is a stylistic phenomenon that does not justify the drawing of conclusions along the lines that the Talmud suggests" (62). Thus, Rashbam make a distinction between a peshat-bdiSQ? "sense" of scripture and a midrashic interpretation derived from an apparent "superfluity" not only in his biblical commentaries (e.g., in the intro duction to Exodus 21) but also in his Talmud commentary. Following this extended "preliminary discussion," Touitou addresses the main purpose of the present volume. Under the heading "Rashbam's Commentary on the Pentateuch," this section of the book comprises six chapters, each an inde pendent study of an aspect of Rashbam's Torah commentary. In the first of these, Touitou offers a critique of Rosin's so-called critical edition. Touitou details how Rosin frequently "corrects" the (no longer extant) unique manuscript of Rashbam's commentary on the basis of his own scholarly intuition, but in a way that does no credit to Rashbam's exegetical principles. For example, Rosin often would reorder Rashbam's comments according to the order of the Penateu chal verses, whereas Touitou demonstrates that it is Rashbam's intention to comment first on the overall contextual meaning of a passage and then to address "technical" or "linguistic" matters. Elsewhere in this section, Touitou's attention is drawn to such topics as Rashbam's methodological comments, Rashbam's innovative approaches to interpreting narrative and law, and Jewish Christian polemics evinced in the Torah commentary. There is also a study of the comments attributed to Rashbam found in the margins of the Rashi commen tary in MS Vienna 23. Added here, somewhat incongruously for a section devoted to Rashbam's Torah commentary, is a chapter in which Touitou culls the citations found in R. Abraham ben Azriel's Arugat Habosem of Rashbam's commentaries 195</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews on other biblical books. Though this is extremely useful, of course, it would have been more appropriately included in a different section. Two appendices are included: One examines "traces of Rashbam's commentary" contained within Rashi's Torah commentary, and the other discusses Nehama Leibowitz's approach to Rashbam's exegesis. The volume concludes with bibliographies and indices. Touitou is to be congratulated on his achievement in further refining our understanding of Rashbam's Torah commentary. No scholar interested in the history of medieval Jewish biblical exegesis or the role of Jewish intellectual contributions to the renaissance of the twelfth century can afford to ignore this important volume.
