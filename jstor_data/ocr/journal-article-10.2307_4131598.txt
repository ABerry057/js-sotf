Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999. xiv, 350 pp. When Hannah Arendt wrote, in Eichmann in Jerusalem (1963), that "the holes of oblivion do not exist. Nothing human is that perfect, and there are simply too many people in the world to make oblivion possible," she was referring to the survivors of the Holocaust who would live to tell the Shoah's many "forgotten" sto- ries. Nearly forty years after, there are fewer survivors to do the job. And scholars have taken up the burden of witness to help us fill in the gaps. Professors Rovit and Goldfarb have compiled a collection of essays and doc- uments that focuses on the specific issues of Jewish artistic creativity and theatri- cal performance during the Holocaust years. Their book has three sections, the third of which attends to the extraordinary performance events associated with the concentration camp at Theresienstadt, where the arts flourished under terrifying conditions of deprivation and loss. It is a story that has been told often, not only in memoirs and historical studies, but in the theatre itself, as can be seen in Ulrike Migdal's Griisse aus Theresienstadt and Roy Kift's Camp Comedy, which attempt to push the problems of survival and death, creativity and complicity into the faces of contemporary audiences. (Kift's play is included in my anthology, The Theatre of the Holocaust, vol. 2.) The editors' purpose, however, is resolutely past-centered. The usefulness of this volume lies in its careful gathering of a number of critical essays, official pronouncements, theatrical texts, personal remembrances, and epistolary frag- ments to create a picture that is at once astonishing and appalling. Professor Rovit eschews an analysis of the autobiographical material, preferring to let it speak for itself as testimony. She is content to provide a context for us, in interviews or 209</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review mini-essays, so that we can "hear" clearly the voices of the "actors" in this trag- ic drama. Rovit's critical essay in Section One, along with two others by Alan Stein- weis and Volker Kuhn that deal with the Jewish Kulturbund and the career of its Nazi overseer, Hans Hinkel, provide a solid historical basis for understanding the Jewish artistic world in central Europe in the 1930s until its final destruction a decade later. These three essays are much stronger in analysis and imagination than those in Section Two ("Containment"), which deal with artistic performance in Jewish ghettos and concentration camps. In fact, the weakest essays in the book seem suffused with a tone of congratulation that can be expressed as: "Isn't it won- derful that the Jews were able to do all that while the Nazis were killing them!" The occasional examples of flaccid writing find support, if not their origin, in the editors' understanding of the performance activity itself, one they see as proving the indomitability of the human spirit amid even abominable degradation and murderous threat. Rovit's introduction speaks to this appraisal: "We of a later generation can rely only on the testimony of 'those who were there' to imagine the 'unthinkable.' We understand creativity as being born from spirit and thus we are inclined to grasp onto the evocative, yet vague notion of a kind of 'spiritual resis- tance' and find it attractive" (p. 9). She closes her essay: "This book is dedicated to a tenacious affirmation of spirit even as the flesh so cruelly perished" (p. 10). The danger of this critical and psychological perspective is that "we" may be tempted toward too much celebration while evading difficult ethical and artistic questions, such as how creative people can also write and perform hateful, even dangerous things. My own preference for this volume would have included the addition of a fourth section that dealt with the contemporary legacy of this performance activi- ty. Aaron Kramer's essay in Section Three alludes to this subject in the discussion of his translation (which premiered in 1977) of Viktor Ullmann's Theresienstadt opera The Emperor of Atlantis. He writes: "Obviously, objective judgment is not easy, and it may take a long time before The Emperor of Atlantis can be accurate- ly gauged as art; but there is no question of its uniqueness as an affirming of the human spirit in the face of physical obliteration" (p. 189). The difficult question of "objective judgment" needs constant asking. Ab- sent that inquiry and its companion question: "Should these works be produced to- day?," the strengths of these concentrationary texts could be reduced or overlooked by sentimentality and uncritical admiration. Such dialogs are, in fact, ongoing in communities and theatres that are attracted to "Holocaust performance," as was the case in Madison, Wisconsin, in the spring of 2000, when a community opera company chose to produce Krasa's famous children's opera Brundibar (the subject of Joza Karas's essay in section three) in the presence of one of the few surviving members of the original cast. The issues of how to advertise the performance (to say nothing of dealing with the audience response) are important to our contem- porary understanding of the ethical issues of post-Shoah production. This kind of discussion, as well as an essay on the reception of the musical made of Jura Soyfer's songs in Vienna in the late-1980s and of Migdal's play in the late-1990s, would have rounded out a useful and caring volume and extended its range into the issues 210</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews of performance and representation that are dealt with in the most interesting and important writing being done today about art after the Holocaust.
