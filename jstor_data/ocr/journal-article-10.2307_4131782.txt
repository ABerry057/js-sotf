<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nathan Katz. Who are the Jews of India? The S. Mark Taper Foundation Imprint in Jewish Studies. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000. xv, 205 pp. If there is a contemporary "dean" of Indo-Judaic studies, it is Nathan Katz, professor and chair of religious studies at Florida International University. He is helping revive the field of study inaugurated by Walter Fischel, who died in 1973. Katz first made his mark with several articles and a book about one of the three Indian Jewish communities, The Last Jews of Cochin (1993); he edited Studies of Indian Jewish Identity (1995) with chapters about the Jews of Cochin, the Bene Israel of Bombay and Maharashtra, and the Baghdadis of Bombay and Calcutta. He subsequently founded and currently co-edits the Journal of Indo-Judaic Stud- ies. Katz contributes to comparative Jewish studies by synthesizing in this book a new wave of publications from the period of 1985 to 1995, which he calls "a groundbreaking era for the study of Indian Jewish communities" (p. 6). His pur- pose here is to explain generally how these Jews, who never suffered discrimina- tion at the hands of the Indian majority, maintained their identities and their com- mitment to Halakhah while acculturating to Indian and English ways. Because Katz did his field work in Cochin, located in Kerala, on the South- west or Malabar Coast of India, he devotes more than half the book to the Malay- alam-speaking Cochinis or Cochinites. They numbered about 2,500 at the time of Indian independence in 1947 but are now unable to provide a Sabbath minyan be- 126</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews cause most have migrated to Israel and elsewhere. The largest sub-group among them are the black and brown Malabari. Although they claim they arrived after the destruction of the Second Temple, empirical evidence goes back only to the eleventh century when charters and honors from the Indian maharajas assured them a high status. The less numerous white Cochinis, who came from Spain in the sixteenth century and from Yemen and other Arabic speaking countries, are called Parade- sis, or foreigners. They were never more than about 300, but they are famous be- cause of their beautiful synagogue built in 1568 and because some, such as the Rahabis, were the middlemen between the Dutch East India Company and Indi- an pepper producers during the eighteenth century. Their contacts with Dutch Jews ensured their access to mainstream Sephardic Judaism. They also adapted to the Indian context. Their exaggerated concerns about purity during Passover reflected brahmin customs. It is not clear from this book whether all Jews of Ker- ala celebrated this holiday in the same way, however. Paradesis emulated "the In- dian caste system by developing subcastes" (p. 59), relegating the darker-skinned older settlers, Malabaris, and their own manumitted slaves, who were practicing Jews, to inferior status. In addition to his own research, Katz depends on Barbara Johnson, Orpa Slapak, J. B. Segal, and Paradesis such as the Koders and Hal- leguas. The Marathi-speaking Bene Israel numbered about 20,000 at the time of In- dian independence and have reached 50,000 in the world. About 5,000 still live in India. Bene Israel say their ancestors, fleeing Assyrian persecution after the de- struction of the First Temple, survived a ship wreck off the Konkan coast. By the eighteenth century their Jewish identity was tenuous. After making contact with other Jews they became more observant and most moved to Israel after 1948. Dis- tinctive to their practices is a particular reverence for the Prophet Elijah. During the "Malida" ritual the Bene Israel make a food offering to Elijah in connection with a vow (p. 103). Katz's discussion depends here on Shirley Berry Isenberg, Joan Roland, Shalva Weil, as well as Haeem Samuel Kehimkar, a Bene Israel him- self. Baghdadis, the Arabic-speakers from Baghdad, Basra, Aleppo and even from Persia and Afghanistan, arrived in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth cen- turies. A few, such as the Sassoons, came with considerable capital, which they in- vested in trade, real estate, and the new industries of Bombay and Calcutta. Bagh- dadis in Bombay rejected the Bene Israel. Katz asserts that the cause of the break between the communities was the 1857 Indian uprising against the British, after which Baghdadis strived to become Englishmen and Englishwomen. This does not explain why, twenty-one years before the revolt, the Baghdadis requested that a wall be built in the Jewish cemetery between their graves and those of Bene Israel, or why they would not intermarry with Bene Israel. Sometimes it seems that the Jews got along better with Indians, who were never anti-semitic, than they did with other Jews. In this section Katz depends on Joan Roland, Tom Timberg, and the Calcutta Baghdadis such as Rabbi Ezekiel Musleah, Jael Silliman, Sally Solomon, Mavis Hyman, and Esmond Ezra. For years, Walter Fischel worked almost alone on Jews of South Asia. This impressive book shows that a new generation of scholars and memorialists, in- 127</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews spired by the relatively happy history of the Jews of India and led by Nathan Katz, is writing excellent works about them today.
