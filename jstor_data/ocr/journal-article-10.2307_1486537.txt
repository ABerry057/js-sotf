London: Frank Cass, 1995. x, 358 pp. The twentieth century has been aptly dubbed the Century of Ideology. First, nationalism and fascism convulsed the Old Order in Europe and Japan in the first decades of the century. Then, Nazism wreaked new havoc in the 1930s and 1940s. Communism's seventy-some years in power have left an indelible, perhaps ineradicable, stamp on one-third of humanity. It is hardly surprising that Jews, too, were inspired by these ideological movements. Joseph Heller's The Stern Gang: Ideology, Politics and Terror, 1940-1949 is a detailed study of a fascinating, if doomed, effort to adapt Communism and Fascism to the service of Jewish nationalism by a numerically tiny, politically marginal, yet historically significant Jewish liberation movement in Palestine. Heller divides his survey chronologically into five parts, following a brief introduction to the character of Revisionism, from which the Stem Gang emerged. Part I examines the Revisionist movement in Palestine in the 1930s as it oscillated between political movement and underground fighting</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 163 force. Part II details the internal conflicts in the IZL (Irgun Zvai Leumi), the Revisionist military organization created by Ze'ev (Vladimir) Jabotinsky, Revisionism's founder. In Part III, Heller analyzes the dramatic ideological reformulation that accompanied the Stem Gang's revival under its formal sobriquet, Lehi (Lohamei Herut Israel), and its embrace of terror. Parts IV and V investigate Lehi's role in the postwar years and its unsuccessful striving to avert its final disappearance from the stage of history. An effective conclusion offers both a persuasive reformulation of the author's main contentions and a balanced evaluation of Lehi's modest contribution to the attainment of Israeli statehood. Heller's approach is of the revisionist (i.e., myth-debunking) history variety. According to him, the Stem Gang has heretofore been the subject only of self-serving and misleading memoirs by former members or enemies. His thesis is that Lehi reinvented itself repeatedly in order to adapt its program to current realities. He analyzes in voluminous detail the ideological shifts the group underwent, along a continuum from purist hard right to opportunistic left. While acknowledging the sincerity of the group's intellectual leaders (Israel Eldad and Nathan Friedman-Yellin), Heller nonetheless presents a picture of a politically inept organization whose chief raison d' tre was driving the British from Palestine. From Heller's perspective, Lehi's ideological contortions were the most interesting, if not the most notorious, aspects of its history. According to Heller's interpretation, Lehi began with a radical-right orientation based on faith in an Axis victory in World War II. Its lack of material resources and, shall we say, quixotic foreign policy approach led to its complete collapse in 1942. The Gang resurfaced in 1943 in a startlingly different guise-with a pro-Soviet foreign policy orientation and on a search for legitimization from the Zionist left. Paradoxically, Lehi's radical-right program remained unaltered, although some elements of Communist ideology were grafted onto it. The resulting amalgam, Heller argues, was analogous to the "National Bolshevism" movement in Weimar Germany, but politically unattractive to the Israeli public. The Gang's attempt to turn itself into a viable political party after 1947 thus proved abortive, and its disintegration was, in Heller's view, inevitable. The unifying glue had been the Gang's relentless and violent anti-British struggle. Once independence was won, Lehi simply ceased to have a purpose. Extensive notes document Heller's prodigious research in virtually ev- ery Zionist archive in existence. Despite this impressive scholarship, and</page><page sequence="3">164 BOOK REVIEWS notwithstanding the fascination of Lehi's short but colorful life, The Stern Gang suffers from a number of problems. Among these is the very profusion of detail, particularly concerning the ideological and tactical pronouncements of the group's various leaders. While Heller persuasively demonstrates that the Stern Gang took its ideology deadly seriously, it is not at all obvious why contemporary readers should find it as riveting as Heller evidently does, given the numerical insignificance of the group (it never numbered more than 800), its lack of broader political influence, and its only modest impact on the independence struggle. A book of 350 pages seems too much to devote to what was, aufond, little more than a footnote to Zionist history. Zionist politics in the prestate period is indeed a thicket into which only the most courageous scholars ought to venture. This volume, following his 1984 volume in Hebrew, The Struggle for a Jewish State: Zionist Politics, 1936-1948, confirms that Joseph Heller ranks among their number. While the National Bolshevism of the Stern Gang proved a nonstarter in the Yishuv, Heller's meticulous examination of its origins and trajectory aptly illustrates the political relevance of the quip of the late Leo Rosten that Jews are like everybody else, only more so. Just as Zionism was itself a Jewish version of the nationalist ideologies of European gentiles, so the Stern Gang was a Jewish replication of radical-right organizations in prewar Eastern Europe. Although his subject may be too arcane for the general reader, specialists will find The Stern Gang challenging and informative. One can only admire the dedication of Joseph Heller, a specialist in international relations at Hebrew University, in presenting the strange, fascinating ideological component of the story of this bit player in the Zionist drama.
