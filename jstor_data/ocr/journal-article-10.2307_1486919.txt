<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael A. Meyer, ed. William Templer, trans. German-Jewish History in Modern Times. Vol. 1, Tradition and Enlightenment, 1600-1780. New York: Columbia University Press, 1996. xiii, 435 pp. In his preface to the set of four volumes inaugurated by the book under review, Michael Meyer outlines the principal goals of the group project he is overseeing. What he and his team aim to produce is "an encompassing, synthetic work that reflects the current state of research" in the history of the Jews in German-speaking Central Europe and "integrate[s] it into an easily readable narrative" (p. ix). The contributors' desire to stay up to date obviously reflects their respect for the work that has been done in this area in recent decades. Their emphatic concern with readability is best explained by the fact that their intended audience includes not only fellow experts but "educators and general readers as well" (p. xii). The project is certainly off to a fine start. Volume 1, which covers not only the period demarcated in its title but also the intellectual history of the ensuing twenty years, effectively draws upon a vast array of scholarly literature to create an extremely helpful and "user-friendly" account of Jewish life in the German cultural sphere during two crucial centuries. Its trenchant discussions of the role of court Jews, the Landjudenschaften, Mendelssohn's "Bible project," the satirical literature of the Haskalah, and many other subjects will</page><page sequence="2">276 BOOK REVIEWS no doubt be welcomed by all segments of the authors' envisioned audience. It would be too much to say, however, that volume 1 fully lives up to all of the editor's promises. One of the stated goals of this series is, for instance, to give due attention to the hitherto-neglected subject of the role of Jewish women (p. xi). It is consequently somewhat surprising to find no reference here to any of the work that has been done in recent years on the spiritual lives of Ashkenazi women in the early modem period. Another goal is to shape the contributors' joint efforts into a "harmonic presentation" (p. xii). While this aim is, on the whole, admirably achieved in the inaugural volume, there are occasional lapses. In his discussion of Mendelssohn's Hebrew periodical, Qohelet Musar, for example, Michael Graetz contrasts its basically optimistic outlook on life in this world and the next with the viewpoint represented in pre-Enlightenment musar literature. "That traditional genre," he writes, "had depicted death and the agonies hell held in store for the sinner in garish, frightening colors, filling the Jew with profound anxiety" (p. 277). Of such great mental discomfort and the literature that produced it, however, there is no mention in Mordecai Breuer's chapters dealing with the medieval and early modem periods. In his treatment of the Jewish Enlightenment, Graetz certainly keeps up with a great deal of the latest research in the field. Among other things, he follows some of the most recent scholars of this period in concentrating on "the Haskalah as a sociocultural phenomenon." More than the classic works of Jacob Katz (an active member of the project's advisory board) and of the editor himself (who singles out Katz for special thanks) on early modem Jewry, Graetz's chapters elucidate the social origins and economic circumstances of the first generation of maskilim and of their supporters and sympathizers. They likewise shed a great deal of light on the relationship between the worldly situation of the maskilim and their program to change the Jewish world. What they do not do, however, is to provide as illuminating a summary of the ideology connected with that program as is already available in the works just mentioned. Whatever the shortcomings of this volume (and they are by no means numerous), it unquestionably goes a very long way toward meeting the main goals that have been set for the series it initiates. And even if it is not superior, in all respects, to earlier overviews of the epoch it covers, it is nevertheless far more accessible. Well-written, well-translated, well-organized, and sprinkled with instructive maps and illustrations, it deserves, among other things, the careful consideration of professors who select the texts that college students</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 277 are required to read in introductory courses in modem Jewish history. It will no doubt receive such attention, once it is available in paperback. Allan Arkush State University of New York at Binghamton Binghamton, N.Y.</page></plain_text>
