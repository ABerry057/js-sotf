<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kenneth Hart Green. Jew and Philosopher: The Return to Maimonides in the Jewish Thought of Leo Strauss. SUNY Series in Judaica: Hermeneutics, Mysticism, and Religion. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1993. xiv, 278 pp. Generally recognized as one of the most important twentieth-century students of medieval Jewish philosophy, Leo Strauss attained much greater renown as an interpreter of Western political theory, both ancient and modern. Strauss was not only an outstanding scholar but the founder of what might be called a school of thought, the mentor of generations of "Straussians." The precise nature of his own philosophic teaching is, however, the subject of considerable controversy. This is the case largely because Strauss presented much of this teaching in a rather elusive fashion, not in independent treatises but in the course of his often intentionally opaque commentaries on the writings of other thinkers. In the two decades since his death, growing numbers of his disciples as well as his critics have sought to do to Strauss's works what he himself endeavored to do to those of philosophers from Plato onward, that is, to ferret out their true, sometimes concealed meaning. Most of these writers, whether friendly or hostile to him, have tended to downplay the significance of Strauss's concern with specifically Jewish matters. Some of his most devoted followers, in particular, have treated his attention to Jewish problems as little more than the accidental point of departure for reflections that ultimately took him far beyond the narrow boundaries of the Jewish world.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 471 This is most definitely not true of Kenneth Hart Green. Taking Strauss at his word, Green argues in Jew and Philosopher that his Jewish thought "stands firmly and separately as a central pillar of his entire thought" (p. xii). Beyond this, he maintains that Strauss was "also one of the most important Jewish thinkers of the present century" (p. xi). Green succeeds most admirably in substantiating both of these contentions. By his own admission, however, he only approaches "in an exploratory and initial way" the most difficult question raised by Strauss's Jewish writings: "What was the precise shape and substance of his final commitment to Judaism?" (p. 198, n. 5). The first few chapters of this book focus on Strauss's intellectual develop- ment during the period he himself discusses in his famous autobiographical preface to the English edition of his first book, Spinoza's Critique of Religion, that is, the decade or so prior to 1928. Green here supplements Strauss's terse and somewhat cryptic self-accounting with a comprehensive and ju- dicious review of his earliest and least-known writings. He explains in an unprecedentedly clear fashion the nature of Strauss's dissatisfaction with contemporary Jewish thinkers and his ensuing examination and rejection of the philosopher whose understanding of revealed religion exercised, in his view, such a decisive influence on modem Jewish thought, Baruch Spinoza. Continuing from where the previously mentioned preface leaves off, Green devotes the latter part of his book to a review of the way in which Strauss's ongoing search for "an eminently reasonable theology" led him to study the writings of Maimonides. Strauss thought at first that he had found there a teaching that "would allow for both 'commitments'" which he himself "was striving to maintain-to philosophic reason and to Jewish revelation-through the person of the prophet who is the most perfect human being and thus encompasses both separate truths" (p. 107). But, as Green skillfully demonstrates, Strauss eventually came to realize that Maimonides' position "was not as pellucid as he had been convinced it was" (p. 122). After discovering the significance of Maimonides' esotericism, he saw that what had appeared to him to be the successful harmonization of reason and revelation was in fact the exoteric teaching of a man who "recognizes that 'being a Jew and being a philosopher are mutually exclusive' " (p. 127). Green does not take this to mean that Strauss regarded Maimonides as someone whose Jewish thought was "merely an exoteric cover for an esoteric adherence to pure philosophy" (p. 128). In the final pages of his book he forcefully argues that Strauss considered Maimonides' version of</page><page sequence="3">472 BOOK REVIEWS esotericism to have been marked by an appreciation of the extent to which the unverifiable yet likewise irrefutable "ancient Jewish biblical wisdom" represented revelation "at its highest" (p. 130). He understood Maimonides to be a "uniquely wise teacher," who taught that "the Hebrew biblical tradition is the best articulation of the claim for the moral life as leading to human perfection and happiness," and that it "may also contain, in its basing itself on divine revelation by the one God who is all-powerful, the only truly sound basis for a 'genuine' morality" (p. 133). Strauss's search through the writings of Maimonides for a way to reconcile revelation and reason led him instead, according to Green, to the realization that these two approaches to truth are in principle irreconcilable but that each of them nonetheless can, in a sense, be retained. Strauss does not follow Maimonides, however, in concealing from the eyes of unworthy readers the essential irreconcilability of Jewish and Greek wisdom. He openly discusses it, describing the insoluble conflict between these two forces as the "core, the nerve of Western intellectual history." In the light of such statements, it may indeed be surprising that anyone could fail to recognize what Green so strongly maintains, that is, that Strauss continued to regard Jerusalem as a genuine alternative to Athens. But, as Green himself reminds us, Strauss was not only an interpreter of esoteric writings but also someone who was himself inclined, at times, to write esoterically. It is this that enables some of the people Green criticizes to regard Strauss's praise of Jerusalem as essentially exoteric. And it is largely for this reason that it is so difficult to answer the question, which Green broaches but admittedly does not resolve, concerning the nature of Strauss's final commitment to Judaism. Green, one is pleased to learn, is not yet finished. His footnotes (which are themselves deep reservoirs of important insights into Strauss's writings and the scholarly literature on them) indicate that he plans to continue his study of Strauss's Jewish thought. One looks forward to the additional volumes he promises with the confidence that they will illuminate other aspects of Strauss's thinking as thoroughly as his current book does his "return to Maimonides."
