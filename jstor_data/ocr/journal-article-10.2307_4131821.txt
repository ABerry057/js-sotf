<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pinchas Giller. Reading the Zohar: The Sacred Text of the Kabbalah. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. xviii, 246 pp. Pinchas Giller is one of the finest contemporary scholars of the zoharic cor- pus. His current study, Reading the Zohar, constitutes an excellent sequel to his 171</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews earlier book, The Enlightened Will Shine. The Zohar certainly warrants the kind of thoughtful and serious reflection that Giller devotes to it, insofar as the Zohar is a massive, complex corpus consisting of some two dozen distinct strata. In Enlight- ened, Giller examined major themes in Tikkunei Zohar and Racaya' Mehemna'. Al- though these are rich and interesting compositions, chronologically they are among the latest and were undoubtedly written by someone other than whoever was responsible for the foundational writings of the Zohar. In Reading the Zohar, Giller is primarily concerned with three seminal aspects of the zoharic corpus: Saba' de-mishpatim, cosmogonic descriptions that are preserved in various strata, and the four interconnected 'Idrot texts. On its own, an analysis of such disparate and challenging sources would be an admirable undertaking. What makes Giller's study even more ambitious is that he also examines how these particular works were studied and interpreted. In particular, Giller is interested in how the kabbal- ists of Safed, most notably R. Moses Cordovero and R. Isaac Luria, incorporated these zoharic texts into their distinctive theosophical systems. Giller divides his study into seven chapters, consisting of 157 pages of rel- atively small font text and 50 pages of erudite endnotes. Additionally, there is a 15- page appendix of translations from two of the "Idrot followed by an extensive bib- liography and index. In Chapter 1, he sets the stage by discussing the Zohar and its commentators. One of the important issues that he grapples with is how the Zo- har achieved its status as a sacred text, thereby becoming the fulcrum of the me- dieval Jewish mystical tradition. Although he pays special attention to the central- ity of the Zohar among the kabbalists of Safed, it is surprising that he neglects to underscore nearby Meron and the pilgrimages made by these mystics to the grave of R. Shimon bar Yohai, the central figure in the Zohar. Whereas the latter half of the first chapter proceeds chronologically in its overview of zoharic commentators, towards its beginning there is a brief, one-page section that is enigmatically titled, "Doctrinal Development." Therein Giller sum- marizes the twentieth-century scholarly debate on the authorship of the Zohar. He notes that Gershom Scholem's theory of Rabbi Moses de Leon as the Zohar's au- thor has been challenged in recent years by Yehuda Liebes. Liebes has persuasively argued that the various strata, with their heterogeneous doctrines, suggest multi- ple authors. Liebes also suggested that the central figure of R. Shimon bar Yohai might have been modeled after R. Todros Abulafia, and that Abulafia and his kab- balistic circle might have been responsible for some of the zoharic material. Giller endorses Liebes' theory without developing it any further. Chapter 2 is devoted to the Saba' de-mishpatim section (Zohar 2:94b- 114a). This cohesive text offers the most comprehensive discussion of reincarna- tion in the Zohar. Giller exposes it as being suffused with erotic pain and love. He provides an excellent analysis of multiple facets of the soul and its erotically charged involvement in marriage, divorce, and procreation. Chapter 3 is entitled Hormanuta, that is, Royal Will, and deals with zoharic cosmogony. Giller assem- bles a number of related passages found in different strata. In so doing, he analyzes key terms, such as buzina' de-kardinuta', "most widely understood as the instru- ment through which God begins the emanation of the ten sefirot" (p. 70). Howev- 172</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews er, the differing ways that he renders the passage from the Sifra' de-Zeniuta"s al- lusion to the death of the Edomite kings is disconcerting. In the body of the book, Giller cites it as: "the primordial kings died and their unions were not found" (p. 96). In his appended translation, this sentence reads: "The primordial kings died and their weapons vanished" (p. 159). Chapters 4-7 constitute the second half of the book and focus on the four interrelated texts of the Icdrot. They comprise the most complex theosophical spec- ulations within the Zohar and were highly esteemed by the Safedian kabbalists. Giller offers an overview of the central issues of the 'Idrot, such as the symbolic death of the kings, and he also raises, but does not resolve, the problematic rela- tionship between the Icdrot and the Sifra' de-Zeniuta'. Although he presents a sol- id analysis of how R. Moses Cordovero interpreted these key texts, the real value is his nuanced treatment of R. Isaac Luria's appropriation of zoharic texts in his radical formulations of Divine anthropos and the dynamic relationship between in- tradivine processes and the created universe. In so doing, Giller effectively coun- ters Scholem's thesis that Lurianic theosophy, especially the doctrine of shevirat ha-kelim (breaking of the vessels), was a response to the historical trauma of the banishment of Iberian Jewry. Instead, Giller demonstrates that Luria was primari- ly concerned with resolving textual tensions within the Zohar itself. In sum, Pin- chas Giller has successfully tackled two of the most recondite aspects of the Jew- ish mystical tradition and presented them in a lucid, edifying, and highly readable manner.
