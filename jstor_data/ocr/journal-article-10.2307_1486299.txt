<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MEANING OF 'EIN LO DOMEH AND SIMILAR PHRASES IN MEDIEVAL BIBLICAL EXEGESIS by FREDERICK E. GREENSPAHN Brighton, Massachusetts Medieval lexicographers and commentators frequently note unique words in the Bible. The descriptions they use for this purpose are regularly understood to be equivalent to the modern term hapax legomenon.

Although there is not complete consensus as to the definition of the modern term, overall its meaning is clear and constant: a hapax legomenon is a word which occurs only once within a defined corpus; to identify a word as a hapax legomenon is to make an assertion about its frequency of use.

'RK.</page><page sequence="3">THE MEANING OF 'EIN LO DOMEH 61 pose of this paper to demonstrate that the medieval references do not neces- sarily mean that words so described occur only once, but that, whatever their frequency, they lack cognate or related forms. The medievals' purpose in such comments was to indicate words which presented them with particu- lar exegetical problems. The first indication that the Hebrew phrases cannot simply be equated with the modern terminology is their syntactic disparity. Hapax legomenon is a nominal phrase; a word so designated is a hapax legomenon. However, 'ein lo domeh and the rest are predicates, fragments of a sentence; a word which occurs only once is not an 'ein lo domeh. To be sure, there are phrases such as millah yebidah which are closer to hapax legomenon in this regard; but these are used much less often and can be evaluated only after their place within the larger group of such terms has been assessed. A second way in which these phrases differ from hapax legomenon is the fact that there are so many of them. Whereas no modern scholar would describe a unique word as anything but a hapax legomenon, Hebrew usage offers a variety of alternatives, used in a seemingly indiscriminate fashion. While there is a logic to the use of these various descriptions, it is a function of style rather than meaning. Sa'adiah, the first to have singled out unique words, describes them with the Arabic term mufrada,2 derived from a root meaning "to be single." It was used similarly by Arab lexicographers and is found also in the works of David Al-Fasi and Ibn Janab, where it was translated by Ibn Tibbon as yebidah, a term used occasionally by David and Moses Qimhi and some- what more frequently by Ibn Parbon.3 Ibn Quraish speaks of al-nddira (rare words),4 while David Al-Fasi describes such words as laysa lahu naprr mean- ing that they have nothing similar, a description also rooted in Arabic lexi- cography and used by Ibn Quraish as well.5 Other Arabic expressions with similar meanings are la shabih fi -lugha6 and laysa lana sawd'ahu.7 The ear- 2.

GREENSPAHN liest Hebrew equivalent is 'ein lo dimyon, the regular formulation of Mena- hem ibn Saruq from whom Rashi seems to have taken it.8 It is used with sig- nificantly less regularity by a variety of others as well.9 The better known 'ein lo domeh is found as early as Dunash ben Labrat, but occurs most prominently in later usage, particularly that of Isaiah of Trani who uses it almost exclusively.'0 The Arabic phrases laysa ishtiqdq or laysa taprif li- hadhihi 1-lafra, which refer to the absence of related forms and seem not to have engendered Hebrew equivalents, occur already in Sa'adiah's treatise on the seventy words.1" A similar group of phrases, based on the root ShNH, includes Moses Qimbi's 'ein lo mishneh and Aaron ben Joseph's me-'ein sheni as well as Ibn Bal'am's ia thantlahu.'2 Ibn Quraish remarks concerning one word that laysa fti -miqra ghayraha.'3 If much of the terminology as well as the interest in this particular phe- nomenon are to be traced to the influence of Arabic lexicography, it is none- theless clear that the unique flavor of several of these comments is indi- genous to Hebrew usage, particularly that of Abraham ibn Ezra. It is true that Dunash and perhaps Menabem had used 'ein lo hzaver, but it is Ibn Ezra who, along with David Qimbi, uses it most extensively.14 He is also the first 8. MM, s.v.

Among the variants he employed are 'ein lo 'abot, 'ein lo 'av ve-'em, and even 'ein lo mishpabah.'6 His sustained use of such imagery and exceptional in- terest in this phenomenon along with the lack of Arabic parallels and the fact that he is the only one or the first to use most of these metaphorical phrases suggests that, with the possible exception of 'ein lo haver which may have provided the impetus for such inventiveness, Ibn Ezra formulated them himself. He is also the only one to use other unique, if less imaginative descriptions-'ein kamohu, 'ein lo 'aber, and shem levado.'7 Although aware of these more standard phrases, later authorities such as Joseph ibn Kaspi seem often to have avoided them in favor of rather free descriptions of the uniqueness of individual words such as 'ein lanu be-yadeinu yoter mi-zeh be- shoresh ... .' In addition to the variety of available Hebrew terms is the freedom with which the medievals phrased such assertions, suggesting again that these were not fixed formulas, but living expressions framed in large part by those who used them. This is in stark contrast to the modern hapax lego- menon, a foreign phrase which never varies no matter who uses it or in which modern language he writes."9 Thus examining only the case with 15.

For 'ein lo 'ab see Ibn Ezra to Gen. 30:20, Lev. 6:14, Deut. 32:15, 33:19, Job 2:8, Lam. 3:16, 6:14. 16. For 'abot see Ibn Ezra to Lev. 14:37, Isa. 11:8, 14:23; for 'av ve-'em see to Lam. 1:14, and for mishpabah to Deut. 32:34. Note also his comments to Job 40:17 and Eccles. 10:8. 17. See comments to Lev. 19:19, Num. 11:2 (if not a textual error for 'ein lo 'ab), Isa. 3:19, Hos. 11:3, Job 17:1, Lam. 4:8. Michael Friedlinder translates Ibn Ezra's millah zarah, which would correspond to the Arabic al-alfd~r al-gharfb (Sa'adiah to Job 6:6, see SS, p. 164 and IQR, pp. 1, 2, 111), as hapax legomenon (at Isa. 9:17, 15:5), and in his comment to Isa. 50:4 it is joined with 'ein re'a lah (for an Arabic example see IQR, p. 110). It is not, however, clear that Ibn Ezra intended it in the same sense as the other phrases here treated (see comments to Esther 1:3 and Dan. 1:3). 18. To Isa. 9:17; see also to Isa. 1:22, 61:6, Joel 1:17, Amos 6:10 and IKSh, s.v. D WB and HZH. This apparent deviation from standard phraseology may be the result of Ibn Kaspi's desire to use rare words as evidence that only a limited amount of ancient Hebrew literature had survived in the Bible; see A. S. Halkin, "The Medieval Jewish Attitude Toward Hebrew," in Biblical and Other Studies, ed. Alexander Altmann (Cambridge, 1963). Not all freely phrased remarks are late. Sa'adiah makes a similar point in his comment to Ps. 80:14. Sometimes the lack of fixed phraseology is deceptive; lo masanu lo haver is repeated verbatim five times by David Qimhi (to Isa. 9:4, Ezek. 5:1, 9:4, 23:23, 33:20; see also to Amos 3:12). 19. In its original Greek usage, hapax legomenon seems subject to similar variability of formulation; see Franco Martinazzoli, Hapax Legomenon (Rome, 1953).</page><page sequence="6">64 FREDERICK E. GREENSPAHN regard to domeh, we find that the most common form is 'ein lo domeh;20 this can, however, be inverted to 'ein domeh lo, even by Isaiah of Trani who uses the more common sequence over thirty times,21 or subjected to various in- sertions such as 'ein la-millah ha-zot domeh or 'ein li-sheneihem domeh.22 One finds also beli domeh, 'ein domeh la-millah, and 'ein lah domeh.23 This last formulation is especially noteworthy in that it is grammatically cor- rect-the antecedent being the feminine noun millah-and yet the greatest number of these phrases use the masculine form o10.24 A similar variety of phrasing can be shown for the other expressions as well. Sometimes two or more of these phrases are combined, as if to suggest that the meaning of one alone would not necessarily be clear. Thus Ibn Parlhon remarks that RNH is a millah yeizidah she-'ein lah domeh.25 Thus far the diversity of phraseology used by medieval Hebrew exegetes has been contrasted to the rigorous consistency of modern terminology. While this does make a clear distinction between the two kinds of usage, it is not adequate to negate the generally accepted equation of the meaning of these phrases with that of the modern term hapax legomenon. Serious ques- tions about such a conclusion are, however, raised by several aspects of the way in which these phrases are used. First, by no means all of the hapax legomena in the Bible are so identified in medieval exegesis. Abraham ibn Ezra notes such words more often than any other of the medievals and yet cites only 43 out of 140 hapax legomenon verbs in the Bible; Isaiah of Trani, who also draws attention to this phenom- 20. E.g., DST, p. 33; Jacob ben Reuben to Isa. 3:10, 33:20, 44:8; Ibn Ezra to Cant. 3:9, 4:1; IPM, s.v. SBT; Moses ben Nabman to Job 6:10; Aaron ben Elijah to Gen. 41:23, and most often by Isaiah of Trani (see above, n. 10). 21. To Isa. 33:20. At Ps. 63:2 he uses the anomalous 'ein lekha domeh; see also Rashi to Exod. 16:14. 22. Ibn Ezra to Isa. 9:4; Moses Qimbi to Job 33:25; see Sa'adiah's description of RTPSh and PD' as mufradatan (to Job 33:24). 23. Ibn Ezra to Job 29:4; IPM, s.v. RSD (see also s.v. 'TM and RNH); Moses Qimbi to Job 6:10. 24. The criterion leading to the use of lah seems to be the closeness to the word millah itself. Menabem uses 'ein lo dimyon several times, except when preceded by a phrase such as la-millah ha-zot 'ein lah dimyon (MM, s.v. Z'K, ZRB, ZRZYP, KSM, MRfI). Most often, he uses neither, preferring instead something like 'ein la-millah dimyon in which case the issue of gender is irrelevant. By the time of Rashi, the phrase was fixed as 'ein lo domeh, illustrating again that this was a formative period for these phrases although the tendency for them to become formulaic is apparent. 25. IPM, s.v. RNH, see also s.v. 'TM, RSD, and above n. 17. A similar conflation of terms can occur in Arabic, e.g., hadhihi 1-kalima min al-kalimat al-mufrada al-ghariba fi -'ibrant allati la nazfr lahu (IQR, p. 100, see also p. 2 bis).</page><page sequence="7">THE MEANING OF 'EIN LO DOMEH 65 enon quite frequently, indicates only 31. Moreover, they agree with regard to only 14.26 The relatively small proportion of words so noted makes it abundantly clear that the medievals did not strive for completeness in iden- tifying such words.27 The lack of consistency in those words which they do describe suggests further the possibility of disagreement among exegetes as to which words were in fact unrelated to other biblical forms. Thus Mena- bem includes GRZ in his list of words 'asher 'ein lahem dimyon and indeed cites the usage in Psalms 31:23 as its only attestation in the entry for that root in his Mabberet, whereas Dunash objects not so much to Menahem's interpretation, which he does somewhat modify, as to the characterization of the word as unique in light ofgarzen which Dunash derives from the same root.28 To the extent that there was a lack of consensus as to a word's root, it is not surprising that exegetes did not always agree regarding its uniqueness. This is especially clear in those comments which enumerate various interpre- tations for an individual word, all based on relating it to other words, only to reject those opinions and conclude instead that the word in question has no domeh. Thus, for example, Ibn Ezra points out that there are those who treat HR T as a dialectic variant of HRSh, while others view it as a metathe- sized form of HTR, but that in fact the correct view is that it has no haver.29 By implication then, domeh and the other terms refer to the existence of related forms within the biblical corpus, and indeed these terms are occa- sionally used in a positive sense with exactly this meaning.30 Remarkably, a 26.

It should be noted that in his famous treatise on the so called seventy hapax legomena, Sa'adiah makes no claim that his is an exhaustive list, nor really a collection of mufradit, but according to his title mufradat al-qur'an wa-sharbuha min takh~r$ al-mishna, that is, words which lack related forms in the Bible but are known from rabbinic usage. In other words, the treatise is based on a subgroup of the mufradat, namely those with rabbinic cognates. The rea- son for this is now well known: Sa'adiah used the existence of such words to buttress his theo- logical position as to the importance of rabbinic literature from a linguistic perspective; see Benjamin Klar, Mebqarim ve-'iyyunim (Tel Aviv, 1954), p. 260. That its contents are selective is therefore hardly surprising; his criterion is explicit from the very first line. 28. MM, pp. 22 and 56; DST, p. 57. 29.

'Abot is similarly used by Ibn Ezra at Isa. 24:1 although the text of that comment is not entirely clear (see Michael Friedlfnder there). Ibn</page><page sequence="8">66 FREDERICK E. GREENSPAHN word could have a domeh outside of the Bible as well. Ibn Ezra remarks con- cerning 'SQ, yadu'a be-divrei qadmoneinu raq ba-miqra 'ein lo re'a.31 The use of tannaitic forms to explain biblical words is found even among Karaite lexicographers who might otherwise be expected to minimize the impor- tance of rabbinic literature.32 A biblical word can have a domeh in languages other than rabbinic Heb- rew. Aramaic is, of course, frequently cited. Al-Fasi notes regarding the root SLQ (Psalms 139:8), laysa fi -'ibrdnt na;tr lakinahu min al-surant, and cites the usages in the Aramaic passages Daniel 3:22 and 6:24.33 Joseph Qimhi is said by his son David to have found a baver for MHL in Arabic, and Al-Fasi notes one for 'BSh.34 Were Akkadian or Ugaritic known at the time, it is reasonable to expect that cognates from these sources would also have been included. The modern term which accurately renders the medieval usage of domeh in these cases is the word "cognate," especially if one can extend its meaning to include related forms in the same language. 'Ein lo domeh therefore refers less to the word's frequency in the biblical text than to the methodo- logical problem of finding sufficient evidence from which to derive its mean- ing. This is clear from Menalem's comment to his list of unique forms where he points out that they are explicable only to the extent that their con- text is clear."3 This is consistent with the medieval method of interpreting a Quraish frequently uses the Arabic analogs of these terms in this way, e.g., natFr (IQR, pp. 11, 17, 18, 48, 107; see also p. 14) and ishtiqdq (see especially, pp. 107-15 which are designated al- abraffallati laha ishtiqdqdt and also p. 27); most often he uses mithl in this sense, corresponding functionally and semantically to the Hebrew domeh. 31. To Gen. 26:20; see DST, p. 33 and Rashi to Lam. 3:16. It is such cases which Sa'adiah collected in his famous treatise; see above n. 27. 32. AFD, s.v. TZ and SPD. Comparison of biblically unique words with tannaitic forms can be found also in MM (s.v. 'PL, GB'L, GRD, TH, SLD, and SPD; see also s.v.

Menahem's inclusion of DHB in his list of unique forms must therefore allude to the use at Isa. 14:4 rather than the frequently occurring Aramaic cognate of Hebrew ZHB (see MM, p. 23 and IQR, p. 2 bis), against Nehemiah Allony, "Hashqafot qara'iyyot be-mahberet Menabem," in 'Oyar yehudei Sefarad 5 (1962): 51. 34.

The medievals often combine assertions as to a word's uniqueness with the conclusion that it can be understood only from context, so much so in fact that it has been suggested that statements about contextual reliance are alone sufficient justifi- cation for the conclusion that the particular exegete believed the word in question to be unique; see E.

Ibn Ezra says as much in his observation at Exodus 16:31 that the word gad has no haver in the Bible since it occurs only with regard to manna; a word which occurs twice still fits into this class because the two usages are not sufficiently dis- similar to provide more information than is available from one alone.37 That these descriptions are primarily methodological is confirmed also by other notations which identify words that occur twice3" as well as those limited to particular sections of the Bible39 or based on unique methods of word formation.40 This helps to explain why not all hapax legomena were so described. Some words identified today as hapax legomena may have been related to other biblical forms,41 while in other cases a word's rareness may not have posed any particular problem of exegesis. Thus among those hapax legomena not singled out by any of the medievals as unique are NBI (Isaiah 56:10) and TRGM (Ezra 4:7), which were so common in postbiblical usage that they were hardly deemed to be problematic.42 The most puzzling aspect of this issue is the fact that some of the words described with phrases like 'ein lo domeh do occur more than once in the Bible. The medieval interpretations of these words must be closely examined in order to understand how they were regarded as unique. Often the evi- 36. IPM, p. 74b. 37. The word occurs also in the nonparallel Num. 11:7, albeit in the same context. Ibn Ezra is also able thereby to describe tenukh as unique (at Exod. 29:20) although it occurs six times in the book of Leviticus. In this regard, see Ibn Ezra's observation at Gen. 40:12. Perhaps this accounts for those observations regarding unique words which lack any explanation as to their meaning (e.g., Ibn Ezra to Job 17:1 and Ruth 1:13; QG, p. 45 regarding KMH; and Joseph Bekhor Shor to Exod. 16:14) that the evidence in such cases was deemed inadequate to permit conclusive interpretation. 38. E.g., Ibn Ezra to Deut. 21:14 and Job 39:19. 39. E.g., Ibn Ezra to Gen. 7:4, Eccles. 2:16, Esther 1:3, 1:20, and Dan. 1:3; see also to Gen. 40:12 and Joseph Qimbi to Prov. 10:8. 40. E.g., Ibn Ezra to Isa. 64:5, Joel 1:11, and Lam. 4:17. 41. E.g., DGH (Gen. 48:16), HP' (2 Kings 17:9), Y'H(Jer. 10:7), S'S' (Isa. 27:8), RPP (Job 26:11), SWH (Gen. 24:63). 42. Similarly, the hapax legomena SMN (Isa. 28:25) and PNQ (Prov. 29:21) are identified as unique only by Sa'adiah for whom other factors clearly played an important part (SS, pp. 149 and 155, see above n. 27). KUL (Ezek. 23:40) and PShH (Lam. 3:11) are also never identified as unique although MSh (p. 81) relates the former to bakhlili (Gen. 49:12) by way of meta- thesis and Jacob ben Reuben (to Lam. 3:11) identifies PShU with PSUI on the basis of sibilant interchange.</page><page sequence="10">68 FREDERICK E. GREENSPAHN dence is insufficient to permit firm conclusions. For example, Sa'adiah's treatise includes without explanation several words with rabbinic counter- parts for which there is no extant commentary by him. Evaluation of this problem is therefore limited by the resources available to us. In some cases it can be shown that while modern scholarship relates a particular word to another biblical form, an individual medieval exegete believed them to be etymologically distinct. Thus although the root 'RB is found many times in the Bible, Menabem regarded its use at Psalms 68:5 to be unrelated to other attestations and thus appropriate for inclusion in his list.43 This is also the case with regard to Sa'adiah's treatment of GLM and QRS which are both included twice in his list, but for separate biblical pas- sages each of which is then correlated with its own rabbinic parallel, the meaning of which is distinct from that of the parallel cited for the seemingly identical root. Close scrutiny reveals that words which occur several times could also be regarded as unique if their various occurrences were limited to one verse or even one passage44 or if they were found only in parallel or virtually paral- lel passages.45 While modern scholars might differ in their treatment of such cases, no one would argue that inclusion of these words is dishonest or wholly unjustified. There remain, however, words clearly described by indi- vidual exegetes as unique with multiple occurrences that cannot be so justi- fied. One could argue that such cases are the result of error, that the exegete simply forgot or was unaware of other occurrences of a particular word. However, this kind of solution begs the question of the meaning of such phrases, assuming them to be identical with our own hapax legomenon. Such a position should be only a last resort when no other reasonable explanation 43. Against Nehemiah Allony, "Hashqafot qara'iyyot," p. 53. This is clear also from David Qimbi's comment (to Ezek. 2:20) regarding TBY that 'ein la-millah ha-zot haver le-fi ha-'inyan. Similar criteria must have governed his identification of demeseq (Amos 3:12) and 'BT (Joel 2:7) as well as Menabem's description of GPR, URK, TRP, 'SH, SRK (MM, s.v. GLB) and Ibn Ezra's comments regarding kivrat (Gen. 35:16), na' (Exod. 12:9), ShQ' (Num. 11:2), 'orbot (Isa. 25:11), bul (Isa. 44:19), shovel (Isa. 47:2), ,elayal (Deut. 28:42, Job 40:31; see also Isa. 18:1), and 'aman (Cant. 7:2). 44. For example, Sa'adiah notes T'T' and sumponyah, while Menabem includes 'RGZ, ZBD, PSL, QRM, SD YM, ShTY, and ShTM. In this category !bn Ezra includes ZBD (Gen. 30:20), QR Y (Lev. 26:21), TT' (Isa. 14:23), and GLSh (Cant. 4:1) as well as S'N (Isa. 9:4) which is included also by David Qimbi. 45. Thus SS includes tolafot, shetum, and ta'aruvot while Menabem's list contains 'eshpar, GLSh and sha'alnez which Ibn Ezra (to Lev. 19:19) also considers unique.</page><page sequence="11">THE MEANING OF 'EIN LO DOMEH 69 can be found.46 It has been proposed that Sa'adiah included some words which occur more than once in order to buttress his argument which re- quired rare biblical words that could be explained from rabbinic Hebrew.47 Since he includes legitimate cases of isolated words with rabbinic cognates, however, there would have been little reason to include inappropriate en- tries merely to lengthen the list; his point could have quite easily been made without resort to such artifice. Moreover, in at least two cases he lists mul- tiple occurrences of a particular root in the same entry, hardly the behavior of one who is trying to sneak something by an unsuspecting reader.48 The existence of this phenomenon in various medieval commentaries and dic- tionaries for which the tendenz ascribed to Sa'adiah is not appropriate indicates the need to find some other explanation.49 In fact, these problems exist only so long as one is committed to equating 'ein lo domeh with our own hapax legomenon, where hapax is the Greek word for "once." The Hebrew contains no such assertion. The inclusion of words occurring several times in nearby or parallel passages already provided one indication that frequency of occurrence alone, which has been shown not to be the purpose of such notices, was also not the basic criterion. These cases serve quite forcefully to prove that point. If one agrees that the exegete did not err, but intended to identify these words by 'ein lo domeh and recalls that domeh is to be understood as mean- ing "cognate or related form," it will then become clear that these are words which, even though they themselves may occur more than once, are from roots which have no other attestation in biblical Hebrew. The word it- self, no matter how often it occurs, is the only attestation of the root- nothing else is related to it. Seen in this light, the terminology becomes clear. Domeh is to be taken literally: there is nothing similar to the word; the word has no relatives, only itself. 46. The possibility of error should not be gainsaid; cf. Menabem's inclusion of 'TNN, BG, GLM, ZRM, ULMWT, lLMYSh, PDR, $NU, RBK, and RGSh in his list of unique words (MM, s.v. GLB) for each of which several related usages are cited at the appropriate entries of the Mabberet. Internal consistency was not always the case; see, for example, QSh, pp. 37 and 50 where differing explanations of BShS are given. 47.

Ibn Ezra thus includes gadish (Job 21:32) despite its occurring several times elsewhere; see also references pertaining to Ibn Ezra and David Qimbi in notes 37 and 43-45 above.</page><page sequence="12">70 FREDERICK E. GREENSPAHN We can appreciate now the difference of nuance between these phrases and the modern hapax legomenon with which they are so often equated. These phrases are descriptive, not formulaic, intended to point out to the reader the methodological limitations which the exegete believed he con- fronted in treating a particular word: whereas he usually looked for the semantic range of words based on a common root, in these cases there was nothing related except perhaps in a cognate language; and where even that was lacking, he was forced to rely on context alone. Thus although their meaning is similar to that of hapax legemenon and in practice the words so identified overlap to a large degree with those properly called hapax lego- mena, the phrases are very different in intention from hapax legomenon which has at its base the assertion that a word occurs only once. The medie- vals were not concerned with word frequency in these comments, but rather with the problem of finding sufficient basis of comparison from which to derive a justifiable interpretation of words for which limited exe- getical resources were available.</page></plain_text>
