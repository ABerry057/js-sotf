<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS 241 Moshe Weinfeld. Deuteronomy 1-11: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary. Anchor Bible 5. New York: Doubleday, 1991. xiv, 458 pp. As the full Anchor Bible title indicates, there are three components to this long-awaited work on Deuteronomy by Moshe Weinfeld: translation, introduction, and commentary. To do the work justice a review must address all three components individually and as a whole. The commentary component is itself divided into three parts, each clearly delineated with headings in the text: "Textual Notes," general "Notes," and "Comment." Overall one can say about the commentary that it is just what the Anchor Bible series of commentaries was meant to be. It provides careful, erudite material for scholars, extremely useful information for clergy, and interesting material for laypersons who study on their own or in lay study groups. It is solid, reliable scholarship, no frills, no long-shots, likely to be the first source to which one turns on Deuteronomy, and the base against which one compares and measures other analyses. The Textual Notes reflect considerable erudition and philological care, with particular attention to the versions. The rich Notes provide geographical information, connections with other biblical books, comparative and contextual materials from other ancient Near Eastern sources, and a variety of general information in categories too numerous to address in a review. The Comments include literary history and history of interpretation. The latter is especially rich in rabbinic and medieval interpretation. The literary history is especially concerned with authors' sources and with editing. There are references to authors' style, but otherwise there is extremely little treatment of literary artistry in either the Notes or the Comment. Given the prominence of this aspect of our field in recent years, this will diminish the value of the commentary for a number of scholars and laypersons; but one can only say that even those of us who concentrate in this area would be well advised to turn to Weinfeld's "traditional" commentary nonetheless as a rich source of essential information that will still be invaluable to such work. Particularly welcome to all will be Weinfeld's treatment of the Decalogue, which is nearly a hundred pages of Textual Notes, Notes, and Comment. The translation is notable for clarity, accuracy, and sheer readability. Weinfeld has been successful in finding the elusive balance between the literal and the idiomatic. Every translator finds his or her fulcrum in relation to these two. Finding that mid-point is not merely the science of translation;</page><page sequence="2">242 BOOK REVIEWS it is an art. And Weinfeld is exceptionally skilled in this craft, endeavoring to stay as close as possible to literal meaning without producing a clumsy English. Where I have some negative criticism is with regard to the remaining component, the Introduction; and, as a longtime admirer of the author, I offer this criticism with some hesitation and in a context of respect and praise of this work overall. In the Introduction, Weinfeld sets out to give the background of the book of Deuteronomy, shedding light on the persons--or better, the circle-who brought it into existence. It is well known that scholarship on Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomistic history of the last twenty years has concentrated to a substantial extent on the stages of formation of this work. In this country there has been a considerable quantity of scholarship identifying two editions of the work, called by Frank Moore Cross Dtr l and Dtr2. A similar identification has been adopted in Israel by Hayim Tadmor and Mordechai Cogan as well in their Anchor Bible II Kings. Iain Provan in England and a number of scholars in Germany likewise have worked out models of various stages of composition that figure in the Deuteronomistic history and in the book of Deuteronomy in particular. Baruch Halpern endeavored recently in his The First Historians to assemble and compare the various models of how this work came to exist, for which we should all be grateful. It is therefore hard to understand the fact that Weinfeld simply has not even mentioned, much less come to terms with, this work. As one of the persons who has participated in establishing the existence of the two editions of the Deuteronomistic history, identifying which texts belong to each edition, and pursuing the significance of this for these biblical books, I feel mystified about this omission. It is not just that Weinfeld does not mention my own work; he does not mention Halpern, Provan, Richard Nelson, Steven McKenzie, Helga Weippert, David Noel Freedman, or Ernest Nicholson, and there is no more than a bibliographic citation on Cross. Indeed, the thirty-eight pages of bibliography include minutiae but not well-known works on such basics as centralization, double redaction, and identification of the Deuteronomic authors and editors. Weinfeld refers to the Deuteronomic name theology without mentioning Dean McBride; and in dealing with the covenant he cites George Mendenhall but not Klaus Baltzer. This problem in the Introduction spills over into the Comment section. Thus when Weinfeld deals with Deut. 4:1-40, which he describes as a unity, he draws parallels in it to Deuteronomy 30 and 1 Kings 8. Deuteronomy</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 243 4, Deuteronomy 30, and I Kings 8 are all regarded as composite in the scholarship that Weinfeld ignores. Calling Deuteronomy 4 and 30 an inclusio, he, apparently unwittingly, links precisely the elements of those two chapters that have been identified as Dtr2. That is, by ignoring this scholarship he may be misidentifying the origin and function of these parts of Deuteronomy. As a matter of method and practice in scholarship, I think that it is now apparent to nearly everyone that in the present generation the sheer quantity of scholarly publication has expanded to the point that it is no longer possible to read and respond to everything on any given subject. But to miss works that are well known, have been well received, and are a respectable body of scholarship well within the mainstream seems curious. Perhaps Weinfeld felt that he had sufficiently covered the territory in his masterful Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomic School and therefore concentrated on the Notes and Comments in this new work. That book was indeed a rich contribution to the field, but almost twenty years have passed between it and the Anchor Bible volume, and a substantial development in the field since then has been the body of scholarship on the formation of Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomistic history. To fail to come to terms with all this work on the way in which the Deuteronomistic work was formed, and by whom it was formed, makes this volume seem out of date before it hits the shelves. Another aspect of this volume, perhaps related, that causes concern is Weinfeld's assumption of the existence of a Deuteronomic school. The first reference to this school comes seemingly out of nowhere on page 5; the first reference to a Deuteronomic movement comes on page 45. This school is later on said to be made up of scribes and wise men. All of this is without evidence or argumentation. In fairness to Weinfeld, I should say that the undefended assumption of the existence of a Deuteronomic/Deuteronomistic school, circle, movement, whatever, is common in the field; and Weinfeld in fact deserves credit for being one of the few who have seriously attempted to identify such a group, again in his Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomic School. But the broader audience of a volume of the Anchor Bible will simply find this assumed "school" appearing out of nowhere and never justified. Thus this volume leaves gaps in two key aspects of the formation of the book of Deuteronomy. Fortunately, these things can be repaired, because this is intended to be a two-volume work. Indeed, the second involves the texts that most concern the work of scholarship that Weinfeld has left out here (Deuteronomy 29-34).</page><page sequence="4">244 BOOK REVIEWS And, after all, no definitive review of Weinfeld's commentary can be written until the full two-volume work is completed. I therefore hope that he will take this not as a negative review, but as sincerely well-meaning advice and urging from a friend, former colleague, former student, and admirer of his. Overall Weinfeld's Deuteronomy is a grand effort which deserves to be admired for the wealth of information and insight it provides, for its clarity and good sense, and for the quality of the translation; and at the same time it has some gaps, the most serious of which are in the area of origins: how did this book come to exist? If Weinfeld fills these gaps in his second volume, the final product could be the finest treatment of Deuteronomy ever produced.
