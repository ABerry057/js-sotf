The attack was in reprisal for violence against Jewish villages on the Israeli side of the border. Since the end of the 1948 war, armed groups from Jordanian border towns had been infiltrating Israel and terrorizing its citizens, and in one such raid on the village of Yehud, a woman and her two young children were killed. The Israeli attack on Kibiyeh was in response to that incident. Kibiyeh was chosen as the target because the perpetrators of the violence in Yehud had appar ently come from there. In the Kibiyeh raid, several dozen Arabs were killed, including women and children. Condemnation of the raid from the international community was swift. Opinion in Israel was mostly supportive of the operation, though a vocal minority opposed it.1 One of the most important Jewish responses to the Kibiyeh operation was a long essay composed in 1954 by Rabbi Shaul Yisraeli (1909- 95), a leading rabbinic authority among religious Zionists. This essay was a painstaking examination of whether the Kibiyeh operation accorded with halakhah, and it became the basis of discussion about war ethics in religious Zionist circles for decades to come. To this very day, its analysis is debated by rabbinic authorities in these circles.2 The prevailing understanding of R. Yisraeli's treatment of the Kibiyeh affair is that he unequivocally supported the raid. He argued that the raid fell under the halakhic rubric of "war of revenge" (milhemet nakam), and in such wars Jews are allowed to kill enemy civilians—men, women, and children. Moreover, in R. Yisraeli's thinking, all wars of self-defense waged by Jews are, in effect, 1.

His views on civilian casualties were therefore applicable well beyond the Kibiyeh incident. Not surprisingly, many commentators have viewed R. Yisraeli's approach as extreme. In a recent article, Yitzchak Roness captures this widespread sentiment by portraying R. Yisraeli's position as reflecting a "radically militant worldview."3 In addition to this negative moral evaluation of R. Yisraeli's position many ana lysts have expressed consternation about the lack of precedent in halakhic litera ture for his viewpoint. R. Yisraeli's notion of wars of revenge does not appear in prior rabbinic discussions on war. Thus, his position is not just morally proble matic but tendentious from the standpoint of halakhic methodology.4 This obser vation has prompted Roness to conclude that R. Yisraeli's analysis of the Kibiyeh affair was inspired more by ideology than by sober halakhic judgment.5 A factor that helps explain the discomfort with R. Yisraeli's views is the common assumption that Judaism does not encourage revenge, and indeed there is truth in that generalization. In most instances in which revenge is invoked in the Bible, it is only God who seeks it; revenge by human beings is mostly discour aged.6 How then could R. Yisraeli base his understanding of an issue as important as defensive war on the notion of revenge? In this paper, my goal is to challenge the common assumptions about R. Yisraeli's essay on Kibiyeh. I will attempt to show that R. Yisraeli's views are, in fact, more complex, ambiguous, and moderate than his readers have assumed. I will also try to demonstrate that his views on wars of revenge were for mulated with the help of a creative reading of midrashic sources that has escaped the attention of his interpreters. The assumption that R. Yisraeli's views have no precedent in rabbinic sources is therefore not entirely true. I should make clear from the outset that my analysis is not intended as an exercise in apologetics. My goal is not to defend R. Yisraeli, and even the more moderate position that I see depicted in his essay is not one I necessarily support. My interest here is only to provide a more accurate reading of 3.

Yisraeli's essay than that provided by others and thus enhance our understand ing of this influential document.7 In a footnote at the beginning of the essay, R. Yisraeli briefly presents his version of the Kibiyeh raid and the events leading up to it.8 The description is accu rate except for his portrayal of the raid as having been conducted by the Jewish vil lagers who had suffered from the attacks; in fact, an elite army unit was responsible for the attack. His understanding of events was clearly influenced by initial govern ment reports that identified the raiding party as Jews from the border towns.9 Yet this misinfonnation does not affect the major question he asks: whether Jews are allowed to embark on a military operation to kill terrorists who reside among civilians when they know that civilians will be killed in the process. R. Yisraeli is specifically interested in cases like that of Kibiyeh in which the ter rorists act with the agreement, encouragement, and perhaps even under the direct instructions of village residents. The question is whether this type of indirect civi lian involvement in violence against Jews renders the entire civilian population culpable for the actions of the terrorists. If the civilians are indeed culpable, they would also be legitimate targets in a military operation meant to punish those responsible for the violence and deter them from future violence.10 R. Yisraeli answers his question in several ways, proposing different halakhic models for understanding the situation Israelis faced in dealing with violence along their border. Even though R. Yisraeli prefers his final answer, the penultimate one is also important for his deliberations. Although I will focus primarily on these last two solutions, I will begin by summarizing briefly the initial solutions he offers. He focuses first on the issue of agency. In Jewish law, if one person commissions another to commit a sin, it is only the latter party who is culpable since only the one who actually commits the sin can be held responsible for it. The question is whether this rule applies to non-Jews as well. If it does, then non-Jewish civilians who provide support and encouragement for terrorists to kill Jews cannot be held liable for the terrorists' actions; only the terrorists can. However, if it does not, those civilians could be held accountable and would be legitimate targets in a mili tary operation meant to punish the responsible parties. After much deliberation, R. Yisraeli ultimately rules that according to halakhah non-Jews are no different from Jews when it comes to the question of agency in committing sinful acts. Arab civilians who support and encourage terrorists to commit acts of violence, therefore, cannot be held responsible for what the terrorists do as a result.11 Another solution entertained by R. Yisraeli is that the Arab civilians could be held responsible for the terrorist violence because they did not bring its perpe trators to justice, and this failure would make the civilians, once again, legitimate 7.1 would like to thank Gerald Blidstein and Stuart Cohen for their helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper. 8.

This hypothesis is premised on the existence of the Noahide code, which requires non-Jews to establish courts of law and a penal system to enforce the code, including the prohibition of murder. Yet in R. Yisraeli's thinking this solution also fails because Arab civilians cannot be held accountable for the behavior of terrorists if there is any suspicion that the civilians fear the terrorists and are therefore reluctant to bring them to justice. While he does not say so explicitly, R. Yisraeli seems to think that such suspicion is warranted in the case of the Jordanian border towns.12 The next halakhic model that R. Yisraeli considers is that the Arab civilians supporting the terrorists are in the halakhic category of "pursuers" (rodfim). In halakhah, a "pursuer" (rodef) is someone who is in the process of attempting to kill another individual, and in such an instance, a third party is permitted to kill the pursuer to save the life of the one being pursued. Might we therefore consider Arab civilians as pursuers if they support and encourage terrorism that threatens Jewish lives? R. Yisraeli answers this question in the affirmative and concludes that Jews may therefore kill Arab civilians harboring terrorists to spare the lives of their future Jewish victims. However, after further discussion, R. Yisraeli con cludes that his ruling applies only to enemy civilians who are adults and not to children, who cannot be held accountable for their elders' actions. Therefore, the pursuer model does not justify a military operation like the one carried out in Kibiyeh because in an operation of this sort children are likely to be killed.13 The last two solutions offered by R. Yisraeli are the most important. R. Yis raeli now entertains the possibility that the Israeli towns along the Jordanian border are really involved in a war. Up to this point, he has constructed his halakhic models from laws that regulate day-to-day interactions between individ uals. In considering the possibility that the situation here is, in fact, a war, a whole new set of laws apply. In halakhah, war is regarded as a situation completely different from that involving individuals, and it brings into effect a series of laws that function only in war. Most important is that war confers on a nation a right to kill that is not normally granted to individuals. According to R. Yisraeli's reading of halakhah, when waging war against an enemy, an army need not be careful to differentiate between the innocent and the guilty because that is the nature of war. Thus, if a military raid like the one in Kibiyeh is considered part of a war, casualties among civilians would be acceptable whether or not the civi lians had been supportive of the terrorists.14 But what kind of war are we talking about here? Halakhah recognizes a variety of wars. First R. Yisraeli considers the possibility that a military action like that taken in Kibiyeh constitutes a preemptive war. The violence perpetrated against Jews in the past by Arab terrorists living in Jordanian border towns is proof that Jews on the Israeli side of the border face an imminent threat of more violence in the future and they therefore have a right to preempt that violence by waging 12.

The problem here is that according to most halakhic sources preemptive war falls under the category of discretionary war, and, according to many rabbinic opinions, this type of war requires the approval of a Sanhedrin, a rabbinic supreme court that no longer exists.15 R. Yisraeli, however, gets around this diffi culty by arguing that the Sanhedrin is not needed when widespread public support exists for a discretionary war, and this appears to be the case in the present instance. R. Yisraeli seems to have in mind the high level of approval for the Kibiyeh raid among the Israeli public.16 At this point, R. Yisraeli raises another objection that involves the entire cat egory of discretionary war: How can one justify discretionary war in principle if it overrides the prohibition of murder? Is it really within the jurisdiction of the Sanhedrin or the Jewish public at large to initiate a military operation in which innocent enemy civilians will certainly die? R. Yisraeli responds to this difficulty by arguing that discretionary war is a right all nations possess, not just Jews, because of the halakhic principle of dina de-malkhuta dina, "the law of the kingdom is the law." This principle, which is widely used in halakhah, states that Jews must adhere to the laws of the country in which they reside even if they conflict with halakhah. The principle applies primarily to civil matters, 15. Halakhah in general recognizes two types of war: mandatory war (milhemet mizvah) and discretionary war (milhemet reshut). These types of war are mentioned in the Talmud (B. Sotah 44b) but are not discussed extensively. Maimonides' discussion of these types of war in Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings 5:1 offers a more detailed and organized discussion of these types of war, and it is gen erally considered by rabbinic authorities to be the authoritative starting place for the treatment of this issue. According to Maimonides, mandatory war encompasses biblical wars commanded directly by God—i.e., the wars against the Canaanites and the Amalekites, as well as wars of self-defense. These wars are mandatory because a Jewish king or government may wage them without consultation with the Sanhedrin, and all able-bodied men are required to fight. Discretionary wars are wars that were fought in ancient Israel to expand the territory of the Israelite kingdom and to increase the prestige of the king. This type of war requires consultation with the Sanhedrin, and, according to some authorities, the 'urim ve-tumim, the oracle attached to the breastplate of the high priest. In this type of war, not all able bodied men are required to fight; some exclusions apply. Opinions on preemptive wars are divided because Maimonides does not mention them, leaving later interpreters with much uncertainty as to how they should be treated. Arguments center on whether preemptive war can be categorized as man datory or discretionary, and under what conditions it can be waged. Most authorities consider them dis cretionary. An analysis of these problems and proposed solutions can be found in J. David Bleich, "Preemptive War in Jewish Law," Contemporary Halakhic Problems (New York: Ktav, 1989), 3:251-92. 16. Yisraeli, 'Amud ha-yemini, 189-91 (sec. 5:1-7). M. Sanhedrin 1:5 and 2:4 refer to consul tation with the Sanhedrin as a prerequisite for going to war. However, Rashi, in an interpretation of another talmudic passage, claims that the Sanhedrin is consulted merely to pray for victory (B. Berakhot 3a). R. Yisraeli settles the contradiction by arguing that discretionary war was implemented by King David, who, as Rashi tells us, consulted the Sanhedrin when going to war so that it would pray for victory. Eventually the custom of consulting the Sanhedrin became law, which explains why the Mishnah treats it as such. Moreover, the Sanhedrin took on the role of representing the will of the public, which was a necessary prerequisite for going to war. Therefore, after the law of consulting the Sanhedrin was implemented, there was no need to consult the Sanhedrin if a public consensus existed in support of the war. 145</page><page sequence="6">Robert Eisen such as taxation—not to purely religious matters.17 What is important for our pur poses is that dina de-malkhuta dina confers a degree of legitimacy on laws implemented by non-Jewish nations. R. Yisraeli's innovation is that he also applies this principle to international matters between states; normally, the prin ciple applies only to matters within a state. Thus, for R. Yisraeli, war is a legitimate activity among the nations because it is recognized by the majority of them as a way to settle disputes. And once again, it is in the nature of war that innocent people die alongside the guilty. Jews can therefore kill in a war even if the killing includes the innocent because all nations have a right to do this.18 R. Yisraeli was well aware that he was making the ethics of war in Judaism dependent on the customs of the gentile nations. However, this did not bother him. In fact, he mentions the views of groups in the international community in his own time who believed that war should be abolished, and he states quite explicitly that if these views were to be accepted by the majority of nations in the world, Jews would be required to desist from waging war as well.19 It is important to emphasize that the international norms governing war of which R. Yisraeli speaks are those of international law, not what nations actually do in war. In his discussion, R. Yisraeli frequently refers to these norms as hok, which can only mean "law." He also adduces examples of the types of norms that govern war, such as the rules that regulate the proper declaration of war and those that determine what types of weapons may be used, and these are clearly references to international law.20 Moreover, if R. Yisraeli had been arguing that halakhah approves of what the nations of the world actually do in war rather than what international law permits them to do, he could have no objec tion to the atrocities committed in the two world wars, including the Holocaust, and this could hardly have been R. Yisraeli's intent.21 In the next section of his discussion of discretionary war, R. Yisraeli still expresses doubts about whether his insights provide sufficient justification for the killing that takes place in war. The problem is that dina de-malkhuta dina does not normally apply to state laws that involve the taking of life, such as the 17. A thorough discussion of the history of this principle can be found in Shmuel Shiloh, Dina de-malkhuta dina (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Academic Press, 1974). 18. Yisraeli, 'Amud ha-yemini, 191-95 (sec. 5:8-16). 19. Ibid., 195 (sec. 5:15). However, it should be noted that at the beginning of his essay when he describes the events leading up to the Kibiyeh raid, R. Yisraeli decries the condemnation of the oper ation by the international community, claiming that their views are hypocritical because no similar con demnations were uttered when Jews were killed by Arab terrorists (ibid., 168). Apparently, R. Yisraeli feels that there is a significant gap between what international law says and the impartiality with which the international community applies it. 20. Ibid., 195 (sec. 5:15). 21. Here I take issue with R. Gutel's presentation of R. Yisraeli's views. R. Gutel gives the impression that, according to R. Yisraeli, Jews should follow what nations do in war, not what inter national law dictates (Gutel, "Lehimah be-shetah," 94-95). However, as I demonstrate here, that is not what R. Yisraeli says. In making his point, Gutel does not cite R. Yisraeli, but instead refers to the interpretation of R. Dov Li'or. R. Li'or, to my mind, does not faithfully represent R. Yisraeli's views on this issue. 146</page><page sequence="7">War, Revenge, and Jewish Ethics administration of the death penalty. R. Yisraeli confronts this challenge with yet another innovative move, arguing that nations have the right to wage war with the loss of life it entails because of metaphysical considerations. He cites a source claiming that the souls of non-Jews are inherently different from those of Jews, because non-Jewish souls originate in the physical world while Jewish souls come from God.22 Non-Jews therefore have possession over their souls in a way that Jews do not, and they can therefore waive their right to life if they so choose.23 The waging of war is a situation in which they do precisely that. Thus, in this instance, the loss of life is no obstacle to applying the principle of dina de-malkhuta dina 24 At the end of his discussion of discretionary war, R. Yisraeli sums up his views on this subject and its relevance to the issues being addressed in his essay: What emerges from this discussion is that even in our day, a military operation by [the people of] Israel under the rubric of discretionary war is [halakhically] possible. And in war there is no need to be meticulous and differentiate between righteous and wicked because the nature of war does not make it possible to be punctilious. Moreover, war [conducted] in this way is permitted as long as this conduct [in war] is accepted among the nations. Therefore, with regard to the matter under discussion (concerning Kibiyeh and similar situations), one must examine if a [military] response of this kind is supported and accepted among the nations, because [if it is accepted] one would have to view it as a consensus on behalf of all those [nations] involved in the matter [of war], and there would be nothing in it [i.e., this sort of military operation] involving the [prohibition against] the shedding of blood.25 R. Yisraeli explains that in discretionary war one need not differentiate between the guilty and the innocent because it is impossible to do so. This way of conduct ing war is halakhically acceptable because it is in accordance with international law that sets the standard for Jewish behavior in matters of discretionary war. Yet R. Yisraeli's final statement in this passage is somewhat puzzling. He concludes his summation by noting that in order for us to judge whether the Kibiyeh operation was halakhically acceptable, we would have to examine whether it indeed conformed to international law; however, R. Yisraeli provides no such examination. He may not have believed he was sufficiently 22. R. Yisraeli specifically cites part 2 of R. Shneur Zalman of Liadi's Tanya as a source for this idea. However, the notion that non-Jewish souls are different from Jewish souls permeates kabbalistic thought and has its roots in Judah Halevi's Kuzari. 23. R. Yisraeli cites the Minhat hinukh as support for his position. The Minhat hinukh rules that suicide is not a transgression for non-Jews as it is for Jews, a ruling that R. Yisraeli sees as an endorse ment of his theory that non-Jews are in charge of their souls, while Jews are not. See Minhat hinukh (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Institute, 1998), 187. 24. Yisraeli, 'Amud ha-yemini, 195-202 (sec. 5:14-23). The implication here is that non-Jews may initiate wars against each other but not against Jews, due to the latter's special status. R. Yisraeli, however, does not explicitly draw this conclusion. 25. Ibid., 202 (sec. 5:24). 147</page><page sequence="8">Robert Eisen knowledgeable in international law to do so. In the course of his discussion, R. Yisraeli does demonstrate awareness of certain elements of international law on warfare. As we have noted, he refers to proper procedures for declaring war as well as rules regarding which weapons may be used. However, his opinions are short on detail. Moreover, when it comes to the crucial issue of harming civilians in wartime, his knowledge is clearly limited. He believes that international norms permit the killing of innocents, but his blanket generalization on this matter betrays a lack of awareness of important developments in international law in the years just prior to the Kibiyeh incident. The Fourth Geneva Convention, signed in 1949, dealt specifically with noncombatant immunity during wartime, and while it made no attempt to ban violence against civilians, it certainly placed strict restrictions on such violence.26 It is possible that R. Yisraeli sensed his limitations here, and without a detailed knowledge of international law, he may have decided to leave open the question of whether the raid in Kibiyeh accorded with its standards. R. Yisraeli does not explicitly reject the model of discretionary war for understanding Israel's actions in Kibiyeh, but ultimately he finds it less satisfying than the last solution he proposes. In the final section of his essay, R. Yisraeli con cludes that operations like that in Kibiyeh are best understood as falling under the halakhic category of mandatory war (milhemet mizvah). Some rabbinic authorities, he notes, consider preemptive war to be mandatory when the danger of enemy attack is imminent; hence operations like that in Kibiyeh would, at the very least, qualify as this type of war.27 Yet R. Yisraeli goes on to claim that the category of preemptive war may not be the best model here. The fact that the Arabs have been engaged in violence against Jews over an extended period of time means that this is a war that has already been initiated by the enemy, and the Jewish operation in Kibiyeh is there fore reactive, not preemptive, in nature. That is, it is a war of self-defense. The fact that the attacks by Arabs have been sporadic in nature does not make the situation any less a war than the more formal type of affair in which armies fight each other on a battlefield.28 At this point, R. Yisraeli raises an objection. He cites a source in the Jeru salem Talmud stating that wars of self-defense fall under the category of manda tory war and therefore they are wars in which all Jews must fight.29 R. Yisraeli is troubled by this ruling because, according to his understanding, one cannot force 26. The text of the Fourth Geneva Convention can be found in Fred L. Borch, Geneva Conven tions (New York: Kaplan Publishing, 2010), 183-258.

Ibid., 202-3 (sec. 5:25). 29. Y. Sotah 8:10, 23a. The passage in the Jerusalem Talmud to which R. Yisraeli alludes is not unequivocal on this point. It contains a debate about the nature of the disagreement in the Mishnah between R. Judah and the majority opinion of the rabbis regarding the distinction between mandatory and discretionary war. R. Yisraeli claims that regardless of which of the two interpretations of this dis agreement is correct, all would agree that both R. Judah and the rabbis regard defensive war as man datory. Mar 'eh panim, a gloss on the Jerusalem Talmud, makes the same argument in order to explain Maimonides' position that defensive war is mandatory. As we note below, R. Yisraeli uses the passage 148</page><page sequence="9">War, Revenge, and Jewish Ethics an individual to endanger himself to defend the lives of others, which is presum ably what every soldier in a defensive war must do. Why then does the Jerusalem Talmud consider wars of self-defense mandatory seeing as this type of war gives a Jewish government license to force all Jews into combat?30 R. Yisraeli answers that, in fact, the cause of self-defense by itself provides no such license. When Jews go to war in response to an attack by an enemy, the purpose of the war is not merely self-defense, but revenge, and it is only for this reason that the war is considered mandatory and that a Jewish government can force its subjects into battle. R. Yisraeli substantiates his claim by referring to the war against the Midianites described in the book of Numbers that was commanded by God for the sake of revenge.31 There, the war was clearly mandatory in being initiated by God, and all Israelites were required to fight.32 According to R. Yisraeli, the war against the Midianites serves as a model for all future defensive wars: these wars are also wars of revenge, and all Jews must go into battle.33 We should clarify that in the biblical account the Midianites never actually attacked the Israelites; we are told that they tempted the Israelites into idol worship, for which God sought revenge.34 Nonetheless, R. Yisraeli treats this war as a response to violence on the part of the Midianites on the basis of a mid rashic source that he cites later in his discussion, according to which the luring of the Israelites to practice idolatry was an attack every bit as harmful to them as a physical assault—in fact, more so. While killing someone robs them of their life in this world, tempting them into idolatry robs them of their life both in this world and the world to come.35 The Midianite war can therefore serve as a para digm for any war in which an enemy has initiated hostilities, including a more con ventional war of defense against physical assault.36 R. Yisraeli also claims that his views on wars of revenge are precisely those of Maimonides. According to Maimonides, mandatory wars include wars for the in the Jerusalem Talmud to justify Maimonides' position on defensive war. See Yisraeli, 'Amud ha-yemini, 189 (sec. 5:2). 30. One might ask why the problem of forcing soldiers to fight did not arise in R. Yisraeli's discussion of discretionary wars. The answer, it would seem, is implicit in R. Yisraeli's understanding of how discretionary wars are waged. As we noted above, R. Yisraeli claims that when discretionary wars were fought in ancient Israel, the Sanhedrin had to be consulted because it represented the will of the people, and it was therefore responsible for ensuring that the king did not coerce his subjects into fighting a war the public did not support. According to R. Yisraeli, this point explains why a San hedrin is not necessarily needed in the present day to wage discretionary war. If indeed the public is in support of waging a discretionary war, consultation of the Sanhedrin would be superfluous. In a democ racy such as the modern state of Israel, the government itself represents the will of the people—at least ideally—and therefore the problem of coercing soldiers to fight does not arise. 31.

Yet, in midrashic fashion, R. Yisraeli gives the phrase a different meaning by linking the word zar, or "enemy," with the term zorer, or "assailant," that the Bible uses to describe the Midianites (Numbers 25:18). Therefore, in his opinion, when Maimonides refers to 'ezrat yisra 'el mi-yad zar, he had in mind wars of revenge of the kind fought against the Midianites. But the important point here is that R. Yisraeli is now able to answer the challenge raised by the Jerusalem Talmud about compelling soldiers to fight in wars of self-defense. In the biblical account of the Midianite war, the entire Israe lite nation was mobilized, teaching us that in subsequent defensive wars, everyone must fight as well. Once again, these wars are not just defensive wars but wars of revenge, and they therefore impose a special obligation on all Jews to participate. Yet, R. Yisraeli immediately points out that when it comes to the treatment of innocent civilians, wars of revenge are no different than other wars: ...if they [i.e., the enemy] have already come [i.e., attacked] beforehand, but have retreated and their goal is to return, they are in the category of "assailants against Israel" and the law of wars of revenge applies to them and it is [a] man datory [war] according to all. And one applies to it [i.e., this type of war] all the laws of war, and [thus] there is no obligation to be meticulous in conduct ing the operation so that no one is hurt except those who participated, for this is the way of war in that the righteous die with the wicked.38 When R. Yisraeli states that in wars of revenge, one applies "all the laws of war," he seems to be referring back to points he made in his discussion of discretionary war that deal with the phenomenon of war in general.39 As we saw earlier, in those wars Jews are not required to take care to spare the lives of innocent civilians on the enemy side because it is in the nature of war that the innocent die alongside the guilty. In fact, war makes it impossible to make this kind of differentiation. The same ethos, it would seem, applies to wars of revenge. As we shall see, these observations have significant implications for our analysis of R. Yisraeli's position on the Kibiyeh episode, but we will have to wait until later to tease them out. In the next section of his discussion of wars of revenge, R. Yisraeli is troubled by one element in the biblical account of the Midianite war: Moses specifically instructs the Israelites to kill children.40 Halakhic sources are gener ally opposed to punishing children for the sins of their parents;41 it is only God who can mete out punishment of this kind 42 Why then in this instance were children deliberately killed? 37. Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings 5:1. 38. Yisraeli, 'Amud ha-yemini, 204 (sec. 5:31). 39. See above, n. 25. 40. Numbers 31:13-18. 41. Based on Deuteronomy 24:16. 150</page><page sequence="11">War, Revenge, and Jewish Ethics We should point out here that R. Yisraeli is not concerned about innocent Midianite adults because his presumption seems to be that they were all guilty of tempting the Israelites into idol worship and were therefore deserving of death. But what then of the children? Why were they killed? R. Yisraeli responds by arguing that there are, in fact, instances in which Jewish law sanctions the pun ishment of children because of the misdeeds for their parents. For example, in the Bible, when an entire Israelite city has engaged in idol worship, the city is destroyed and all of its residents are put to death—men, women, and children.43 The Midianites who tempted the Israelites into idol worship were therefore pun ished in a similar way. Yet Yisraeli is reluctant to approve of complete annihilation of the enemy in subsequent defensive wars waged by Jews on the premise that, as noted above, tempting Jews into idol worship is a far more serious crime than the physical violence perpetrated in most other wars. R. Yisraeli thus concludes by reiterating that in wars of revenge Jews should conduct themselves "as they normally wouid" (ka-ragil) in any war, even though they may kill children in the process; however, they should make every effort not to kill children intentionally.44 R. Yisraeli now concludes his essay by summing up his position: What emerges from all this is that there is room for [military] operations of recompense and revenge against those who assail Israel, and an operation of this kind is in the category of mandatory war. And whatever disaster and harm is inflicted on the [enemy] perpetrators [of violence], their associates, and their children, it is their very own responsibility, and they will bear their sin. And there is no obligation to avoid [military] operations of recompense because of the concern that the innocent will be harmed, for it is not we who are the causes [of this harm], but they themselves [i.e., the enemy]; we are guiltless. Moreover, regarding the intention to harm children from the outset, this is something we have not found [in the Jewish tradition] except with the sin of idol worship. Therefore, one should take care not to harm them.45 All wars that Jews fight in self-defense are also wars of revenge, and in such wars one need not be careful in sparing the lives of the innocent. And if anyone is responsible for the death of these people, it is the enemy that has initiated hosti lities in the first place, not the Jews. Yet R. Yisraeli finishes with a plea that special care be taken to avoid killing children. Let us now evaluate R. Yisraeli's essay. As we noted in our introduction, many commentators see his views as radical and militant. A number of them also reject R. Yisraeli's notion of wars of revenge with the claim that it has no basis in rabbinic tradition. The rest of my analysis will be devoted to challenging these assumptions. 42. Exodus 24:5. 43. Deuteronomy 13:13-9; Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Laws of Idolatry 4:6. 44. Yisraeli, 'Amud ha-yemini, 204 (sec. 5:31). 45. Ibid., 205 (sec. 5:32). 151</page><page sequence="12">Robert Eisen We will begin with the second problem regarding the sources of R. Yisraeli's views. The specific difficulty here is that R. Yisraeli seems to build his case for wars of revenge from a direct reading of the biblical story of the Midianite war, not from later halakhic tradition. Wars of revenge are not codified or even dis cussed in the great compendia of medieval halakhah. As Roness puts it, "nowhere in the halakhic literature do we find this biblical account transformed into a normative precedent for such wars in the future."46 Similarly, R. Neriah Gutel, despite his respect and reverence for R. Yisraeli's authority, has trouble understanding how he saw the Midianite war as precedent for later wars.47 Yet, not only does R. Yisraeli argue for the existence of wars of revenge, he claims that all defensive wars are wars of this kind. What then prompted R. Yisraeli to adopt a position on such an important issue with so little support to back him up? As we noted, Roness believes that in this instance R. Yisraeli was motivated more by ideology than by substantive halakhic argument. There may be some truth in this assessment; however, I also believe that R. Yisraeli's viewpoint was based on a key rabbinic source that has escaped the notice of his disciples and interpreters. As we noted in our summary of R. Yisraeli's discussion of wars of revenge, he cites a midrashic passage claiming that someone who tempts another person into idolatry has done them much greater harm than killing them because idolatry affects the fate of the individual not just in this life but in the afterlife as well. This statement is, in fact, part of a larger midrashic passage that comments on the war with the Mid ianites and appears in Numbers Rabba and Tanhuma: "Assail the Midianites" (Numbers 25:17): Why? "For they assailed you" (Numbers 25:18). From this the Sages have derived the maxim: If a man comes to kill you, kill him first. R. Simeon says: Flow do we know that one who causes a man to sin is even worse than one who kills him? Because one who kills him does so only with respect to this world but leaves him a share in the world to come. One who causes him to sin, however, kills him in this world and in the next.48 The midrash seems to be motivated by discomfort over the harsh punishment meted out to the Midianites, and it therefore suggests that the war against them was actually one of self-defense. The Midianite "assault" on the Israelites con sisted of tempting them into idolatry, a crime worse than killing because of its long-term spiritual consequences. But most important for our purposes is that the midrash treats the Midianite war as the source for justifying the well-known rabbinic maxim that one is allowed to kill in self-defense (ha-ba le-horgekha hashkem le-horgo),49 and given the biblical source upon which it relies, it is 46. Roness, "Defensive War," 192 47. Gutel, "Lehimah be-shetah," 64-65. 48. According to the version in Numbers Rabba 21:4. A similar passage appears in Tanhuma, Pinhas 3. 49. B. Berakhot 58a, 62b; B. Sanhedrin 73a. 152</page><page sequence="13">War, Revenge, and Jewish Ethics clearly justifying killing in self-defense not just for the individual but for the nation as well. R. Yisraeli undoubtedly had this source in mind in formulating his views on wars of revenge—although he alluded only to its second half in his deliberations. R. Yisraeli drew from the midrash the lesson that the Midianite war was paradig matic for all subsequent wars of self-defense. Of course, R. Yisraeli went beyond the rabbinic reading of the Midianite war in one important respect: the midrash establishes only that the Midianite war is paradigmatic for wars of self-defense, not for wars of revenge. In other words, R. Yisraeli ended up reinstating the theme of revenge that the midrash seems to have attempted to avoid. However, the theme of revenge in the war against the Midianites is clearly stated in the bib lical text itself. When God commands Moses to wage war, he tells him, "Avenge the Israelite people on the Midianites..." (Numbers 31:2). Shortly afterward, Moses gathers an army and implores it to "wreak the Lord's vengeance on Midian" (Numbers 31:4). Therefore, by bringing in the issue of revenge, R. Yisraeli is merely going back to the original biblical text upon which the mid rashic reading is based. The question then is why R. Yisraeli would use this particular source to establish the Jewish nation's right to defend itself. R. Yisraeli may have been influ enced by the medieval halakhic authority R. Menahem ben Solomon Meiri who, in his talmudic commentary, justifies the principle of self-defense by citing the mid rashic passage on the Midianite war.50 However, other medieval halakhic auth orities tend not to cite this midrash in dealing with the specific issue of wars of self-defense, or wars of any kind for that matter. Most striking is R. Yisraeli's determination to read Maimonides' notion of 'ezrat yisra 'el mi-yad zar in light of this source, a reading that seems to have no precedent. To understand fully why R. Yisraeli resorted to using the midrashic passage about the Midianite war, we must begin by recalling R. Yisraeli's motivation for referring to this passage: the problem of conscription, which is, in fact, a major difficulty for many halakhic commentators. Defensive wars normally require a government to conscript soldiers whether they want to fight or not. Yet, according to most halakhic authorities, no individual can be forced to endanger his life to save the life of another, which is presumably what every soldier fighting in a defensive war must-do. The conscription of soldiers for defensive wars should therefore be forbidden.51 Nonetheless, Maimonides establishes quite clearly that 50. Beit ha-Behirah on B. Sanhedrin 72a. R. Hayim David Halevi follows Meiri's interpretation here in his article, "Ha-ba le-horgekha hashkem le-horgo" Tehumin 1 (1980): 344-45. 51. E.g., Teshuvot Radbaz (New York: Otsar ha-Sefarim, 1966), vol. 3, responsum 1052. However, some disagree and claim that a person is obligated to endanger himself to save the lives of others. See, e.g., Kesef mishneh on Mishneh Torah. Laws of Murderers 1:14. A discussion of this issue can be found in R. Shlomo R. Goren's Meshiv milhamah (Jerusalem: Ha-Idra Rabbah, 1986), 3:268-72. See also Bleich, "Preemptive War," 275, and Nahum Rakover, Mesirut nefesh: hakravat ha-yahid le-hazalat ha-rabim (Jerusalem: Jewish Legal Heritage Society, 2000), chap. 9. Bleich notes (276-77) that another difficulty with waging war is that in the course of battle, innocent civilians on the enemy side are likely to be killed, and halakhah does not permit one to kill an innocent bystander 153</page><page sequence="14">Robert Eisen defensive wars fall into the category of mandatory war, which means that a Jewish government can force all able-bodied men to fight, and no major halakhic auth ority subsequent to Maimonides challenges him on this point. As for R. Yisraeli, he also raises the problem of conscription, but instead of citing Maimonides as proof that defensive wars are mandatory, he prefers to cite a source in the Jerusa lem Talmud that makes the same point. A number of solutions have been proposed for the problem of conscription. R. Abraham Isaac Kook claims that defensive wars are instances of hora'at sha'ah, a situation of national emergency that allows one to temporarily suspend halakhah and therefore ignore the legal obstacles in the way of waging a defensive war.52 R. Shlomo Goren presents a common approach to the problem by arguing that the right of a Jewish government to draft soldiers is based on the law of the pursuer. A soldier is, in effect, the third party that must intervene to prevent the pursuer—i.e., the enemy—from killing the soldier's fellow countrymen. The problem with this explanation is that, once again, one cannot normally force an individual to endanger his life to save that of another. Nonetheless, R. Goren claims that the cause of national self-defense overrides that halakhic concern and requires individuals to serve and fight on behalf of their countrymen.53 R. David Bleich surmounts the problem of conscription by citing a talmudic precedent in B. 'Eruvin that allows Jews in border towns in the land of Israel to go to war on the Sabbath to defend themselves from enemy attack. This source permits a violation of Sabbath law that would make sense from a halakhic standpoint only if this type of military operation fell under the rubric of mandatory war, and mandatory war, in turn, would assume that forced conscription is permitted.54 There are other solutions.55 However, the weakness of all these positions is that they refer to rabbinic sources that either do not cite the biblical text or cite biblical passages that have nothing to do with war.56 This observation points to a larger problem. There is, in fact, no explicit biblical source that permits defensive wars in the first place. Early rabbinic sources find sanction in the Bible for allowing the individual to to save another person's life. Bleich points out that classical halakhic sources generally do not deal with this problem. However, in recent decades, religious Zionist rabbis have discussed this issue extensively as moral questions regarding civilian casualties have proliferated on account of the ongoing Israeli Palestinian conflict. 52. R. Abraham Isaac Kook, Mishpat Kohen (Jerusalem: Mosadha-Rav Rook, 1966), 308, 315. 53. R. Goren argues this point in several places in Meshiv milhamah. See, e.g., 3:276-77. R. Goren entertains other arguments for justifying defensive war, and, as we shall see below, one of those arguments refers to the same midrashic source about the Midianite war cited by R. Yisraeli. 54. B. 'Eruvin 45a; Bleich, "Preemptive War," 274. 55. See, e.g., Roness, "Defensive War," 191-92 and sources cited there. 56. E.g., the law of the pursuer is justified in B. Sanhedrin 73a by reference to Deuteronomy 22:25-27, which describes the case of a betrothed girl who is raped, and Leviticus 19:16, which com mands that one must not "stand idly by the blood of your brother." Neither of these cases is concerned with war. 154</page><page sequence="15">War, Revenge, and Jewish Ethics kill in self-defense or to kill a pursuer who is threatening someone else's life.57 Furthermore, there are divine commands in the Bible that mandate wars other than defensive ones, such as the imperatives to make war on the Canaanites and to conquer the land of Israel, and the command to annihilate the Amalekites.58 The biblical text also contains the vague sanction for waging war in "towns that lie very far from you" (Deuteronomy 20:10-15). Yet the biblical text is silent on the question of whether the Israelites as a nation can defend themselves against an aggressor as a matter of principle. One can imagine that this issue would be of particular concern to R. Yisraeli, who, along with other religious Zionist rabbis in the early years of the state of Israel, was trying to formulate halakhic positions on a host of matters involving the Jewish return to political sovereignty—including national self-defense. All of this explains why R. Yisraeli was so interested in the midrashic passage about the Midianite war, a source that is striking in several respects. First, it is the only source in the major works of early rabbinic literature that justifies defensive wars by citing the biblical text. Second, the biblical text that is cited concerns national and not just individual self-defense. Finally, the midrash addresses the more specific problem of conscription—at least implicitly—because it refers to a defensive war in the Bible that God clearly required the entire Israelite nation to fight. Hence R. Yisraeli had good reasons for turning to this source in formulating his views on defensive wars. With impressive brevity, it solved the major problems with this type of war more effectively than other sources: it justified defensive wars in general, addressed the issue of conscription, and accomplished both purposes by referring to a biblical source that was specifically concerned with war. We should also note that the midrashic source upon which R. Yisraeli relied is not the only one that sees the Midianite war as paradigmatic for later wars. According to another early rabbinic source, a Jewish army is allowed to surround a city on only three sides, and this rule is deduced from the biblical account of the Midianite war.59 That principle and its prooftext were later canonized in medieval halakhah by Maimonides.60 Therefore, this source and Maimonides' confirmation of it may have also encouraged R. Yisraeli to think of the Midianite war as the model for all defensive wars. It does not take much reflection to figure out why other rabbinic authorities had passed over the midrash about the Midianite war as a source for justifying wars of self-defense. Halakhic commentators may have been uncomfortable with a midrashic passage that associated defensive wars with a battle that was 57. The source is Exodus 22:11, a verse that allows a person to kill a thief who is attempting to invade one's home. See M. Sanhedrin 8:6. For sources on the pursuer, see n. 56 above. In some sources, the right of self-defense is also conflated with the law of the pursuer on the premise that if a pursuer may be killed by a bystander to save the life of the one being pursued, the person being pursued may kill the pursuer as well. See B. Berakhot 58a and 62b. 58. With regard to the Canaanites, see Deuteronomy 7:1-2, 20:16-17. With regard to the Ama lekites, see Exodus 17:8-16; Deuteronomy 25:17-19; 1 Samuel 15. 59. Sifrei Bamidbar, 157. 60. Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings 6:7. 155</page><page sequence="16">Robert Eisen explicitly depicted in the biblical text as an act of revenge. Furthermore, the sources upon which halakhic commentators base their views of defensive wars are most often from the Talmud, while the midrash about the Midianite war does not appear there and hence may not have been regarded as sufficiently authoritative for a matter as important as wars of self-defense. In sum, commentators on R. Yisraeli's essay concerning Kibiyeh are certainly correct in seeing his views on wars of revenge as unusual. There is no explicit precedent for such an idea in the halakhah, and the notion that wars of self defense are pennissible is generally supported by interpretive mechanisms other than that chosen by R. Yisraeli. However, it is not correct to say that R. Yisraeli's views have no precedent whatsoever in rabbinic sources. We have shown that he formulated his position by creatively interpreting a midrashic source and that he turned to that source for good reasons. With all this in mind, it is instructive for us to look at how Rabbi Shlomo Goren used the Midianite episode in his own deliberations about war, in an essay devoted to the Israeli war in Lebanon in 1982, a war dubbed by Israel "Operation Peace for the Galilee."61 In the essay, R. Goren discusses the sources for the general principle of self-defense in halakhah. The first, according to him, is the law of the "pursuer" that allows an individual to kill someone who is intent on killing an innocent person. The second is the biblical passage in Exodus that allows a person to kill a thief who is attempting to invade one's home.62 What is most important for our purposes is R. Goren's final source: it is none other than the Midianite war in the book of Numbers. R. Goren explicitly cites the midrashic source in Numbers Rabba and Tanhuma that bases the principle of self-defense on this war.63 Most significant is that, according to R. Goren, this last source is especially useful because it explicitly approves of self-defense for the collective, while the first two address only self-defense for the individual: It should be mentioned that the sources in Midrash Rabba and Tanhuma contain something that is not in the sources in the Babylonian Talmud. For in all of the above-cited passages from the Talmud, what is spoken of is physical danger for the individual against which he has been given permission to defend himself. But there is no proof regarding the obligation of the collective to go to war against the [enemy] collective when they [i.e., the Jews] are in spiritual danger, as was the case with the Midianites who caused Israel to sin. And there fore the midrash comes to state this [principle of self-defense] from the biblical passage, "Assail the Midianites and defeat them" (Numbers 25:17). For the commandment and obligation is incumbent on the collective to go to war to defend itself against physical and spiritual danger alike. This is learned from the words of R. Simeon bar Yohai that come right after the first homily [teaching about self-defense], both in Midrash Rabba and Tanhuma.64 61. Goren, Meshiv milhamah, 3:283-303. 62. Exodus 22:11, and note 57 above. 63. Goren, Meshiv milhamah, 3:289-95. 64. Ibid., 3:292. 156</page><page sequence="17">War, Revenge, and Jewish Ethics Therefore, R. Goren not only calls on the midrashic reading of the Midianite episode to justify wars of self-defense as R. Yisraeli does, he articulates a reason for addu cing that source that I suspect was a factor in inspiring R. Yisraeli to use it as well: it provides a justification for self-defense of the "collective"—that is, the Jewish nation as a whole—from a biblical source that refers explicitly to war. Though R. Goren does not say so explicitly, I suspect that his interpretation of the Midianite war is in response to R. Yisraeli's. R. Goren would have certainly been familiar with R. Yisraeli's well-known essay on the Kibiyeh operation. R. Goren, in effect, pays his respects to R. Yisraeli by accepting the midrashic reading of the Midianite war that R. Yisraeli had adopted, but departs from him by refusing to give any place to the theme of revenge. But even if R. Goren was not responding to R. Yisraeli here, his use of the midrashic reading of the Mid ianite episode legitimates its use as a source for wars of self-defense and suggests that R. Yisraeli's own choice of this episode for the same purpose was not as unusual as some interpreters have claimed.65 Let us now address R. Yisraeli's essay from a moral standpoint. Is it as radical and militant as it has been made out to be? From our analysis, not necessarily. R. Yisraeli views all defensive wars fought by Jews as wars of revenge, but in actual practice this equation has limited practical significance. It allows R. Yisraeli to justify defensive wars in general and to classify such wars as mandatory so that a Jewish government can require its subjects to fight. However, none of this has any effect on his beliefs about how wars of self-defense should actually be fought once they are init iated—that is, it has no effect on jus in bello. When it comes to civilian casualties, we have seen that R. Yisraeli's position is the same as it is for all other wars—that is, those that are discretionary: Jews must follow international law, and that law tolerates the killing of the innocent along with the guilty.66 While this position may seem harsh, it is not exactly radical. In fact, R. Yisraeli is trying quite consciously to align his ethics of war with what he believes to be international standards of conduct. Moreover, R. Yisraeli's formulation falls within the spectrum of views commonly held by Western thinkers who have dealt with the ethics of war. R. Yisraeli's position perhaps corresponds most closely to what we know in the Western tradition as moral realism, an approach arguing that war should be waged for a just cause while largely accepting civilian casualties as a necessary evil that has to be tolerated for the sake of that cause.67 R. Yisraeli's 65. Another rabbinic authority we should mention here is R. Aaron Soloveichik, who takes a similar position to that of R. Goren and R. Yisraeli in identifying the midrashic source about the Mid ianite war as the authoritative source for wars of self-defense. See "Yishuv ha-'arez u-milhemet mizvah be-yameinu," 'Or ha-Mizrah 19, no. 2 (1970): 109-10. However, R. Soloveichik makes no mention of R. Yisraeli's prior reflections on this issue. 66. See above n. 38-39. 67. The great twentieth-century Protestant thinker Reinhold Niebuhr is often regarded as the best representative of this approach. For a brief but informative discussion of moral realism and the ways in which it differs from just war theory, see David L. Clough and Brian Stiltner, Faith and Force: A Christian Debate about War (Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press, 2007), 64 66. For the general phenomenon of realism in all its forms, including moral realism, see David R. Mapel, "Realism and the Ethics of War and Peace," in The Ethics of War and Peace: Religious and 157</page><page sequence="18">Robert Eisen position would not meet the standards of just war theory. The latter also accepts civi lian casualties but insists that they be kept to the minimum needed to achieve victory, and R. Yisraeli is, in general, too accepting of such casualties to be identified with this way of thinking.68 But being a moral realist does not make one a radical or militant. Most important, contrary to what is often assumed about R. Yisraeli, he does not approve of killing enemy civilians if there is no military benefit. Despite his limited understanding of international law, he must have known that this kind of killing was forbidden by international standards, and once again, it is those stan dards that determine his view of Jewish conduct in war. Nor does R. Yisraeli support the indiscriminate killing of enemy civilians for no other purpose than revenge for the killing of Jewish civilians. It is important to realize that R. Yisraeli does not use the concept of revenge in the conventional and colloquial sense of taking action to inflict suffering on an enemy as payback for previous injuries. For R. Yisraeli, the phrase "wars of revenge" is nothing more than a halakhic label for defensive wars in which a Jewish government can conscript soldiers and force them to fight against their will. In light of these observations, R. Yisraeli falls short of true militancy.69 All of this still leaves many questions unanswered. If according to R. Yis raeli Jews are permitted to the kill enemy civilians during wartime, which civilians are fair game? Is it just those who are in the direct line of fire? Or would R. Yisraeli Secular Perspectives, ed. Terry Nardin (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1996), 54-77, and in the same volume, Jeff McMahan, "Realism, Morality, and War," 78-94. 68. Clough and Stiltner, Faith and Force, 64-66. Clough and Stiltner do, however, note cor rectly that even just war theorists often take positions on noncombatant immunity that are not too distant from those of moral realists. For example, the just war theorist Michael Walzer justifies the British firebombing of German cities in World War II because the situation was a "supreme emergency" that called for waiving the principle of noncombatant immunity. Similarly, just war theorist Jean Elsh tain pleads for a return to Niebuhr's realism in dealing with the contemporary jihadist threat. See Michael Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations, 3rd ed. (New York: Basic Books, 2000), 54; Jean Bethke Elshtain, Just War against Terror (New York: Basic Books, 2003), chap. 7. 69. In light of these observations, one can question whether the term "revenge" is the appropri ate rendering for nakam or nekamah in R. Yisraeli's vocabulary. Robert Nozick draws a distinction between "retribution" and "revenge," and perhaps the former is more apt here. He argues that there are three differences between the two terms: (1) retribution is in response to a wrong, while revenge may be perpetrated for any injury, harm, or slight whatsoever, even if no wrong has been committed; (2) the amount of retribution is proportional to the harm done, whereas revenge can exceed that pro portionality; (3) retribution need not be personal, while revenge generally is ("I am doing this because of what you did to my father"). See Robert Nozick, Philosophical Explanations (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1981), 366-74. However, one can question whether even the term "retribution" is appropriate here. When R. Yisraeli speaks of milhemet nakam, he is speaking about defensive wars, the main purpose of which is to save lives and to deter the enemy from future attacks. If civilian lives are lost, it is not really for retribution, but because such casualties cannot be avoided in modern-day warfare. I would like to thank an anonymous reviewer for directing me to Nozick's discussion. 158</page><page sequence="19">War, Revenge, and Jewish Ethics include those outside the theater of combat who might have a more indirect role in the war? The exact parameters of R. Yisraeli's views on noncombatants are never worked out, but again, on the basis of what he says, it is hard to see him as a radical. Yet did R. Yisraeli not approve of the Kibiyeh operation in which dozens of civilians were killed? Does this not prove his militancy? Here too matters are not as simple as interpreters have assumed. R. Yisraeli certainly endorses the type of military operation conducted in Kibiyeh in principle. According to his understand ing of the situation leading up to the Kibiyeh raid, the perpetrators of violence against Jewish civilians in Yehud were from Kibiyeh and therefore a military raid to root out those perpetrators would have been perfectly acceptable, even if it meant civilian casualties. However, once again, this position would not necess arily make R. Yisraeli a radical. Some just war theorists would also support a mili tary operation in these circumstances and would tolerate civilian casualties. The situation R. Yisraeli was grappling with is referred to by modern war theorists as irregular warfare, which includes wars against terrorists and guerillas who do not function as a regular army, do not wear army uniforms so that they can be identified, hide among civilians, and therefore cannot be attacked without signifi cant loss of innocent life. In recent years, ethicists have had heated debates about how to deal with these kinds of enemies, as guerilla warfare and terrorism have become increasingly common. Some just war theorists believe that one must go after the terrorists militarily despite the risk of civilian casualties, and this approach is justified by a number of moral arguments. One such argument is that the terrorists themselves are responsible for the civilian deaths among their own people, not those who attack them.70 In fact, this argument is made explicitly by R. Yisraeli himself in the concluding section of his essay in a passage that we have already cited: "whatever disaster and harm is inflicted on the [enemy] perpe trators [of violence], their associates, and their children, it is their very own respon sibility, and they will bear their sin."71 Therefore R. Yisraeli's views, while perhaps harsh, are not out of the mainstream here. Moreover, while R. Yisraeli may have supported a military raid in Kibiyeh in theory, a careful reading of his essay will show that he never actually voices approval of the raid as it was carried out in practice! In fact, he explicitly eschews judgment on this matter. In a central statement examined earlier in our dis cussion, R. Yisraeli says quite clearly that "with regard to the matter under discus sion (concerning Kibiyeh and similar situations) one must examine if a [military] response of this kind is upheld and accepted among the nations."72 However, as we have noted, R. Yisraeli himself refuses to make a determination on this matter. That R. Yisraeli does not grapple with what actually happened in Kibiyeh is also evident from a careful reading of the final passage of his essay where he sum marizes his position. Let us look again at that key statement: 70. Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars, 180-82. 71. Yisraeli, 'Amud ha-yemini, 205 (sec. 5:32); see above n. 45. 72. Ibid., 202 (sec. 5:24). 159</page><page sequence="20">Robert Eisen What emerges from all this is that there is room for [military] operations of recompense and revenge against those who assail Israel, and an operation of this kind is in the category of mandatory war. And whatever disaster and harm is inflicted on the [enemy] perpetrators [of violence], their associates, and their children, it is their very own responsibility, and they will bear their sin. And there is no obligation to avoid [military] operations of recom pense because of the concern that the innocent will be harmed, for it is not we who are the causes [of this harm], but they themselves [i.e., the enemy]. We are guiltless. Moreover, regarding the intention to harm children from the outset, this is something we have not found [in the Jewish tradition] except with the sin of idol worship. Therefore, one should take care not to hurt them.73 We should not be misled by the belligerent tone of this passage. His references to revenge have to be understood in light of what he said earlier; R. Yisraeli's notion of revenge is of limited significance in his ethics of war and is called upon primar ily to require the conscription of soldiers. Even more important, there is no mention of the Kibiyeh raid here. R. Yisraeli's conclusions are framed in a dis tinctly prescriptive manner. All that he tells us is that "there is room" for wars of revenge and recompense. He seems more interested in setting forth principles as to how Jews should deal with the Arab threat in the future than in commenting on events that have already occurred. Therefore, the most we can say is that R. Yisraeli supports the military option against the Jordanian border towns, but it is not at all clear that he endorsed what actually happened in Kibiyeh. Why did R. Yisraeli not make a ruling that specifically addressed the events in Kibiyeh? As we suggested earlier, he may not have been in a position to. He may have recognized that his knowledge of international law was not detailed enough to determine whether the actions in Kibiyeh conformed to its norms. Therefore, he preferred to lay down a prescriptive position on the killing of enemy civilians so that others with more knowledge of international law could make that determination. Another possibility is that R. Yisraeli had mixed feelings about what happened in Kibiyeh. He is quite emphatic that in war, special care should be taken not to kill children; yet, in Kibiyeh children were indeed killed. It is therefore possible that in his mind the military operation in Kibiyeh had gone too far. This may explain why he voices special concern for the killing of children and why he concludes his essay by mentioning that issue. Thus, his essay may have been as much an attempt to place restrictions on Jewish military action as it was an attempt to determine what was permitted. It was more a guide for how Jews should conduct themselves in future raids than a stamp of approval on what had happened in Kibiyeh. This would explain R. Yisraeli's prescriptive language when arriving at his final conclusions. I would like to examine briefly one more element in R. Yisraeli's essay that has aroused a good deal of criticism. As we have seen, R. Yisraeli bases his jus tification of discretionary war on the notion that the principle of dina de-malkhuta 73. Ibid., 205 (sec. 5:32). 160</page><page sequence="21">War, Revenge, and Jewish Ethics dina applies to international laws governing the relationships between nations. Since the gentile nations permit war, Jews can wage war as well. Yet, in order to justify the killing that takes place in war, R. Yisraeli makes use of a metaphys ical argument predicated on the notion that there is a fundamental distinction between the souls of Jews and non-Jews. While Jews have souls that belong to God, non-Jews have full ownership over their souls, and therefore the non-Jewish nations as a group have a right to permit wars in which their lives may be taken. A number of commentators have been disturbed by this argument for obvious reasons: it seems to assume that non-Jewish life is cheaper than Jewish life.74 Yet a closer examination of R. Yisraeli's essay will reveal once more that the issues are more complex than they seem. First of all, let us not ignore the irony that while R. Yisraeli appears to denigrate non-Jews here, he does so while arguing that the rules of war for Jews are determined by non-Jews! While non-Jews are inferior in a metaphysical sense, it is they who decide how Jews should conduct themselves when it comes to the practice of war in the real world.75 Second, R. Yisraeli is not entirely lacking in compassion for non-Jewish life. As we have seen, R. Yisraeli at no point endorses the wanton killing of non-Jews. He expresses concern throughout his deliberations for innocent non-Jewish civilians who die in war. Most poignant are his views on the killing of non-Jewish children, an issue that seems to have particularly disturbed him. His method of dealing with the collateral deaths of children is also noteworthy. As we saw, R. Yisraeli addresses the killing of children when discussing the Mid ianite war in which children were deliberately put to death. Why, R. Yisraeli asks, were they killed if there is a prohibition in Jewish law against holding children responsible for the sins of their parents? R. Yisraeli answers that children were killed in the Midianite war only because the Midianites had "attacked" the Israelites by tempting them into idol worship, an assault far worse than a physical war. That is why there is also a biblical mandate to kill children when destroying an Israelite city that has adopted idolatry. The Midianite war therefore does not provide precedent to act in a similar manner in defensive wars when the enemy has attacked in a more conventional manner. What is striking about this interpretation is that R. Yisraeli treats the matter of killing non-Jewish children with halakhic principles and injunc tions that normally apply to Jews. In their biblical and rabbinic contexts, the prohibi tion against holding children responsible for the sins of their parents and the case of the idolatrous Israelite city are focused on Jews. Therefore, in this instance, the dis tinction between Jews and non-Jews seems to melt away. In conclusion, my analysis challenges the common assumptions about R. Yisraeli's essay on Kibiyeh on a number of levels. First, R. Yisraeli's 74. See especially Yosef Ahituv, "Milhemot yisra'el u-kedushat ha-hayyim," in Kedushat ha-hayyim ve-heruf ha-nefesh, eds. Aviezer Ravitzky and Isaiah Gafni (Jerusalem: Merkaz Zalman Shazar, 2003), 267-71; Blau, "Enemy Civilians," 24-25. 75. One could argue, however, that R. Yisraeli's position here is still ethically problematic. When it comes to the ethics of warfare, he is willing to follow gentile practice, but when it comes to their humanity, he suddenly becomes a chauvinist! I would like to thank an anonymous reviewer of this article for this insight. 161</page><page sequence="22">Robert Eisen concept of wars of revenge is not invented out of whole cloth. Certainly there is no precedent for this idea in the great codes of halakhah. However, I have demon strated that R. Yisraeli formulated his notion of wars of revenge with the help of a creative reading of a midrashic source on the Midianite war. Even more important, R. Yisraeli's essay on Kibiyeh appears to be more mod erate than commentators have assumed. His use of the concept of revenge served a limited purpose in his deliberations, one that ultimately detached that term from its conventional meaning. His views on violence toward enemy civilians in Jordanian border towns were aligned with what he believed were the rules of international law regarding war. He also emphasized that special care should be taken to spare the lives of children in military operations. R. Yisraeli certainly did not believe that Jews should conduct military raids in Jordanian villages for no purpose other than to kill Arab civilians in retaliation for the killing of Jewish ones. Raids of this sort had to be conducted according to the rules of war specifying that the individuals who had actually carried out the violence were to be the primary targets and that the killing of civilians was acceptable only so long as it was part of that overall effort. As for the actual raid that took place in Kibiyeh, R. Yisraeli offered no clear statement about whether it actually conformed to halakhah. A judgment on this matter would have required a discussion of whether the raid was acceptable according to inter national law, and this was a discussion R. Yisraeli did not provide. He appears to have been more interested in establishing prescriptive principles for future military actions than in making judgments about past ones. Yet it is understandable that commentators have read R. Yisraeli's essay as representing an extreme position. R. Yisraeli was bound to mislead readers by his use of the incendiary concept of revenge. That term is sufficiently charged that the subtleties of R. Yisraeli's arguments could easily be overwhelmed by the powerful overtones it evoked. The same could be said about R. Yisraeli's use of the idea that the souls of non-Jews souls are fundamentally different from those of Jews. R. Yisraeli's views on non-Jews are a good deal more complicated than this notion would suggest, and yet here too the complexities of his thinking are easily lost due to the negative impressions that this concept brings to the fore. Thus, if R. Yisraeli has been misunderstood, it is partly his own fault in not being sufficiently careful in the way in which he bandied about controversial terms and concepts. Such lack of care can have dire ramifications. R. Yisraeli's perceived extre mism has served as precedent for subsequent interpreters with a militant bent. An excellent example is the way his views on the "pursuer" have been used by sub sequent right-wing Zionist rabbinic authorities to justify violence not just against Arabs but against other Jews. As we have seen, R. Yisraeli rejects the use of this concept to justify the type of military raid that was conducted in Kibiyeh. However, as Gerald Blidstein has shown, this has not stopped several rabbis from using this idea for radical purposes.76 What we therefore learn from our 76. Blidstein's essay "The Treatment of Hostile Civilian Populations" is largely devoted to this issue. 162</page><page sequence="23">War, Revenge, and Jewish Ethics analysis is that when dealing with sensitive ethical issues such as the killing of innocent civilians, great care must be taken not just in delineating one's positions; one must also be cautious with the words and ideas used to formulate those pos itions, seeing as they often have unintended consequences. The irony is that if R. Yisraeli had been more informed about international law, his position would have been even more moderate than our interpretation suggests. As noted earlier, the Fourth Geneva Convention had placed significant restrictions on warring nations when it came to civilian casualties, and if in R. Yisraeli's thinking international law was determinative of how Jews should wage war, those restrictions would have made it difficult for R. Yisraeli to speak as cavalierly as he did about the innocent dying with the guilty in war. And there is good reason to believe that R. Yisraeli would not have been hesitant to follow the Geneva Convention. He says explicitly that if the international com munity were to abolish war altogether, Jews would have to do so as well.
