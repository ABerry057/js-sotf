A revision of the author's 1996 doctoral dissertation at Hebrew University, the book is clearly written, though sufficiently technical to be of interest principally to scholars in the field. As Fidler explains on page 1, not every dream in scripture is a "dream theo phany." The first chapter addresses the nature of dreams in scripture, the trustworthi ness of their messages, presumptions about their sources, and the role they played in ancient Israel. Fidler 's view is that the internal scriptural ambivalence regarding dreams cannot be simplistically "solved" by repeating the words of Jeremiah (23:25-32) and other critics?biblical and postbiblical?that some dreams are lying words whereas others are the words of God. She calls for, and delivers, a more sophisticated analysis that pays attention to the narrative context, the person receiving the dream, and the purpose of the dream itself (5-17, 338). Chapter 2, "The Feeble Theophany Pattern" (91-124), intriguingly posits a new model: Gentiles who receive dreams intending to warn them against harming Israel, whether as individuals (Abimelech-Abraham and Laban-Jacob) or as a nation (Balaam). Fidler convincingly shows a biographical element in all three of these instances and a lack of clarity (hence "feeble") that contrasts with Jacob, Solomon, and Israelite recipients of dream theophanies. Fidler 's careful reading, which shows great sensitivity to the structure of these narratives and the word choice of the author, is all one could expect from a student of Alexander Rofe. Still, the skeptic might ask, are three examples enough for a typology? Moreover, can the relatively episodic dreams of Abimelech and Laban really be lumped together with the dream of Balaam, which is followed by four extended oracles that take up the better part of aparashah? Fidler explains this by adducing Balaam's status as a professional (123), but I think the argument runs both ways in judging the strength of the typology. Chapter 3 (125-200) focuses on Jacob, the recipient of three dream theopha nies. Each of these contains a salvation message from God and marks a critical turning point in Jacob's biography. Fidler 's analysis of these dreams as develop mental, with due attention to the places where Jacob receives these dreams, their place in the narrative, and their actual content, persuaded this reader that the deep structure of the Jacob cycle must take these episodes most seriously. The high point of Fidler's book, in my view, is her analysis of the Bet-El dream (esp. 196-200). She concludes, "Thus the promise in the dream at Bethel (Gen 28:15) can be interpreted as legitimization of Jacob's flight as a result of the stolen blessing from Esau; however, there is no reminder of the stolen blessing itself and no attempt to present that act as correct or moral" (200). (The table on pages 181-82, one of several useful illustrations in this book, should be exam ined carefully by anyone who is interested in the Jacob narrative.) Fidler considers the role of the dream theophany in Genesis in Chapter 4 and finds it concentrated in the "Elohist" narratives, although not absent from other traditions in ancient Israel. Chapter 5 (243-71) treats the dream Solomon receives at Gibeon (I Kings 3:4-15). That this dream is absolutely positive and serves as justification for Solo mon's rule seems obvious. But not so obvious, Fidler tells us, is the "Elohist"/ 373</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews northern Israelite stake in this narrative (242^3). The special nature of this dream, of course, is its political content and the consequent function of Solomon as intermediary between God and the people. Fidler sees this example of the dream theophany as close to the ancient Near Eastern model as expounded by Siegfried Hermann, to whom Fidler seems deeply indebted (246), as she is to A. L. Oppen heim. Fidler concludes this chapter by attributing this dream theophany to both Canaanite-northern Israelite sources and also to Judahite-Jerusalemite ones (271). Fidler pays careful attention to the sources of her narratives and devotes much energy to untangling them, although in the end she is more committed to form than source criticism. Fidler takes a strong stand that such narratives cannot be dismissed as peripheral to the Israelite conception of divine communication or the human experience. Chapters 2, 3, and 5, which feature Fidler 's close readings of texts, form the heart of this ambitious book. Nevertheless, her sixth chapter, on the role of dream theophanies in historiographie and prophetic literature, and her seventh, on the ancient Near East, also merit reading. The importance of the dream theophany and its heroic reception in ancient Near East flood narratives (344-47) contrast sharply with the communication to Noah in the Genesis story. Fidler 's discussion of the liminality of dreams in prophetic literature is illuminating and applies a post modem perspective with gusto. Fidler's discussion of Zygmunt Baumann in the conclusion is short but excellent (338). She explains that her goal was to expose the depth of the issue, not to solve the problem of how the biblical authors regarded "dream theophany." There is no single solution because the narrative-historical con texts of dream theophanies differ, as do the sources from which they were fashioned. Although the epigraph to Fidler's book is from Bavli Berachot 55b, and she occasionally cites midrashim, there is little reliance on traditional commentaries, a curious omission considering that the medieval commentators shared her interest in narrative. Similarly, although there is sensitivity to the historical context, especially in regard to who might receive revelatory dreams and how, there is little attempt to illuminate Israelite historical development beyond the parameters of source criticism. The utility of this book to teachers of Judaic studies in general is limited, but its contribution to the scholarship on biblical dream theophanies is considerable; I hope that this book will be made available in English.
