<plain_text><page sequence="1">250 BOOK REVIEWS Samuel A. Meier. Speaking of Speaking: Marking Direct Discourse in the Hebrew Bible. Supplements to Vetus Testamentum, vol. XLVI. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1992. xvi, 383 pp. In his famous comedy routine, Victor Borge uses various sounds to represent the punctuation marks in a book which he is reading aloud. By doing this, he calls attention to the presence of signs in a written text which, though not normally articulated, aid in reading. What these signs attempt to do, of course, is to provide the reader with information that is readily apparent in oral communication, since most scripts have no way of showing tone, volume, phrasing, facial expression, or gesture. As problematic as this may be for a simple, expositional text, it is even more difficult in the case of direct discourse, where an author must communicate not only what is said and, ideally, how, but also who is doing the speaking . This becomes still more complex where the possibility of multiple speakers exists, as in dialogue. Modern writers have several tools with which to solve this dilemma. Among these are quotation marks and other isolating punctuation (colons, commas, etc.) and, in some languages, conventions of capitalization. However, none of these was available to biblical writers. Readers of the Bible must, therefore, rely on verbal cues, particularly the use of verba dicendi, such as s'l, 'nh, and various forms of the ubiquitous root 'mi; in order to recognize what would have been obvious to any listener or participant in an ancient conversation, namely, who is speaking. Samuel Meier's Speaking of Speaking is a preliminary study of the ways in which biblical authors handled this problem. As such, it is, in some respects, more of a catalog than a description of the phenomenon with which it is concerned. Close to 40 percent of its pages are taken up by sections devoted to the use of specific terms, such as 'mri and its various inflections. Other topics studied here are the treatment of direct speech in prophetic texts and the presentation of divine speech. To achieve this, the author has assembled an array of complicated charts, with detailed discussions of many problematic individual passages from the Bible. As he readily acknowledges, the book may, therefore, prove more useful as a collection of data for further, specific studies than as something to be read through on its own. At the same time, buried in Meier's lists and complex syntax are many intriguing implications. For example, he points out that the root ngd (higgid) introduces direct discourse much less often than Slh and proposes that 'mr may have</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 251 been associated with Jerusalem, whereas the root dbr was used in the North. He also notes that poetic passages tend to avoid the familiar li'mdi; which, Meier claims, originally functioned as a true infinitive, marking purpose, before it developed into the fundamentally meaningless indicator of direct discourse which it became only late in the biblical period. Indeed, its frequent absence from prophetic texts leaves the identity of the speaker unclear in many such passages. Not until the exilic period was this problem resolved, as evidenced by the use of a rigid pattern in the book of Ezekiel. Meier also offers some remarks about the "messenger formula," which he studied in an earlier monograph (The Messenger in the Ancient Semitic World [Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1988]), arguing that rather than indicating the narrow category of messages, it is actually a citation formula with a much broader range of use. In addition, he is able to identify a series of phases in the treatment of divine speech, beginning with pre-exilic poetry, where God's words are unlikely to be set apart from their context as they are in prose passages, which use the same lexemes for God as for other speakers. It was only during the exilic and post-exilic periods that special phrases, such as ne'irmn YHWH, came into use. Meier's research yields numerous observations which contradict what one might ordinarily expect. He is particularly successful in demonstrating the surprising variety of ways in which the Bible handles direct discourse. This is most vividly evident in parallel passages, which sometimes introduce the same speech in quite different ways. Further evidence of the same sort can be inferred from ancient versions, which occasionally seem to have relied on Vorlagen that handled direct discourse differently than the Masoretic text of the same passage. Since it is not always possible to distinguish the translator's contribution from that of the original author, such evidence must, perforce, be treated cautiously. A particularly interesting feature is Meier's extensive use of modern translations, which contemporary biblical studies seldom afford the same status as monographs and reference works such as lexicons and commentaries. However, these are uniquely valuable for this project, since the nature of a translation forces the translator to take a stand as to the speaker of every biblical passage. Given the subject and Meier's interest in identifying and classifying virtually every relevant biblical passage, it is perhaps inevitable that his syntax can become complex; for example, he describes the fact that dbr</page><page sequence="3">252 BOOK REVIEWS occurs surprisingly often in 2 Kings 1 without being complemented by any form of the verb 'mr as "a consistent deviation unique in the Hebrew Bible" (p. 146). Elsewhere, his terminology is occasionally difficult, with words such as "disambiguate" (pp. 259 and 275) and "cataphoric" (p. 306). Nonetheless, this volume represents a significant, if tedious, contribution to the study of Hebrew syntax, which is attracting increasing attention among contemporary biblical scholars. In the end, one can only hope that the author's diligence and his book's rigorously empirical approach will encourage closer scrutiny of numerous common assumptions and thereby lead to a better understanding of the way in which even familiar biblical phrases developed and are used.
