Portland, OR: Vallentine Mitchell, 2006. xii, 256 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000815 Alyson Pendlebury's new book, Portraying "the Jew " in First World War Britain, is a welcome addition to recent work on nineteenth- and twentieth century Anglo-Jewish literature and culture. Explaining that she will focus on "constructions and representations of British and Jewish identities" (3), Pendle bury situates her work in the context of earlier studies, such as Bryan Cheyette's Constructions of "the Jew " in English Literature and Society: Racial Represen tations, 1875-1945,1 by emphasizing that the idea of "the Jew" has been constructed in different historical contexts based on persistent popular preju dices. Pendlebury's well-argued thesis is that in Britain before, during, and after World War I, biblical imagery and Christian rhetoric were mobilized to foster national identity and support for the war, but this use of Christianity, para doxically, was not accompanied by a revival of religious practice in Britain. With the rhetoric of a holy war against the enemies of Christianity, Jews found them selves once again dramatized as the enemy of Christian, hence British, truth and nationhood. Rather than trace her argument chronologically, Pendlebury organizes the book around four major rhetorical themes that were revived and reinterpreted in the period?crusade, conversion, crucifixion, and apocalypse?demonstrating the burden that each of these constructions placed on the Jewish outsider. This organization generally works well, although it does lead to some duplication and repetition. However, Pendlebury demonstrates enough detail in each category to justify the arrangement and clearly shows the way in which a range of texts?" "press articles, sermons, political speeches and pamphlets, poetry, novels and car toons" (9)?engage the major tropes of Christianity, often at the expense of the Jewish community, which is reduced to repeated, stereotyped images of "the Jew." In the second chapter, "The Imagery of 'Crusade,' 1880-1914," Pendlebury focuses on the intersection of the women's suffrage movement and the call for social purity, the latter of which arose in the context of the new stream of immi gration from eastern Europe beginning in the 1880s. With the influx of many poor, uneducated Jews, fears arose in the popular imagination about the corruption of social life. Jews were often associated in the popular press with trafficking in prostitution and other vices: "the popular image of the 'trafficker' was predomi nantly associated with the Yiddish-speaking Jew" (16). Many of the early feminist writers of this period associated vice with "Eastern" influences and posited instead associations of their movement with Christian imagery of the crusade and the mar tyrdom of such heroines as Joan of Arc. Pendlebury extends this discussion into the next chapter, "The First World War as 'Holy War,'" in which she argues that Jews living in Britain suffered by their association with the "pagan" 1.

B. Stem develops in her novel, Children of No Man s Land (1919). The fourth chapter, "Conversion, Assimilation and National Identity," exposes the double bind in which Jews found themselves: "Jews in Britain were subject to pressure to assimilate, even as the xenophobia exacerbated by the war made this difficult" (87). Although, as Pendlebury argues, the conversionist societies that had been active in the nineteenth century were "discredited by the early twentieth century" (107), there was still tremendous pressure on Jews to assimilate, at the same time that racial theories of difference made assimilation very difficult to accomplish. If religious conversion was not the "answer" to the problem of Jewish difference, Pendlebury argues that there was an effort during the war years to "convert" Jews from their association with revolutionary politics, particularly Bolshevism, to a more palatable national identity in Zionism. Pendle bury argues that early British support for Zionism was thus a response to imagined political threats of Jews living in Britain?a move that once again distanced Jews from the British nation by relocating their national aspirations to Palestine. Although Pendlebury's ideas are intriguing, the connection between Zionism and religious conversion could be more fully developed with an appreciation of its long history in Britain from the millennialism of the seventeenth century. In the next chapter, "The Imagery of Crucifixion in Relation to the War," Pendlebury argues that "irrational fears" (141) of Jews during World War I were often expressed in imagery of crucifixion in which the Allied soldier became a Christ figure betrayed by Judas, figured as the Bolshevik Jew. Pendlebury adds a layer to this analysis by suggesting the connection between this imagery of cmcifixion and the ancient blood libel against the Jews. Adding further subtlety, Pendlebury also shows that poets such as Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon, and Isaac Rosenberg used the same religious tropes as parodies of the conviction that the war was a just Christian crusade against the "pagan" forces of evil. Pendlebury's penultimate chapter, "The Apocalyptic Imagination," actually focuses on two related tropes, "Armageddon" and "Antichrist," as they relate to "the Jew." Pendlebury argues that the rhetoric associated with these two tropes fed right-wing groups in Britain following the war and was eventually margina lized with such groups and such inflammatory texts as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Her conclusion is that, rather than the venomous rhetoric of Protocols, "ambivalence ... has characterized majority attitudes towards Jews in Britain" (212). This claim of ambivalence, which I and others have found to be the hallmark of British responses to Jews and Judaism,2 is a point that Pendlebury could elaborate, especially as her focus has been on such extreme rhetoric of the separation of good (Christianity) and evil (Others). In her concluding chapter, Pendlebury returns to a stereotype that she had touched on earlier, that of the Jew as vampire. She does so by introducing a rather obscure film, Dracula 2001, which is interesting but perhaps not the best 2. See Judith W.

Nosferatu (1922), for example, would have been more relevant to the imagery and period on which she focuses, and Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897) is fascinating in its direct connec tion to eastern European immigration. Pendlebury misses the opportunity to build on some recent work on the Gothic, Jews, and vampires. I am thinking, for example, of Carole Davison's Anti-Semitism and British Gothic, which has an excellent chapter on Dracula, as well as H. L. Malchow's earlier Gothic Images of Race in Nineteenth Century Britain. In addition to some omissions and odd choices, sometimes Pendlebury misses the opportunity to analyze a text fully. Often her presentation of fiction, for example, involves mostly plot summary. This approach is partly justified by the broad scope of her study?Pendlebury admirably covers a great deal of ground and reintroduces some overlooked authors?but she did leave this reader at times wanting more analysis to accompany the summary. I can easily put these criticisms aside, however, when considering the overall success of the book in demonstrating the power of Christian rhetoric used for secular purposes, as well as the haunting parallels between the crusading images of the early twen tieth century and the current geopolitical mythology, a connection that Mark Levene notes in his foreword. History may not repeat itself?Pendlebury rightly cautions us against this clich??but the powerful rhetorical constructs that she studies have stubborn lives of their own. Judith W.
