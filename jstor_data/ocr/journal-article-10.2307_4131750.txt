Berkeley: Uni- versity of California Press, 2001. xi, 374 pp. In the early modern and modern periods, the occupational profile of Jews in the West diverged dramatically from that of their neighbors and fellow citi- zens. Commerce, rather than agriculture or artisanal or industrial manufacturing, provided the arena in which Jews labored to make a living. From an economic perspective, this was not a problem. It did not place Jews at a competitive disad- vantage. Indeed, the opposite was true. In the context of industrialization, urban- ization, and mass consumption, buying and selling was more profitable than tolling in a field, workshop, or factory. Having been forced into a narrow range of occupations earlier in their history, Jews in the West now found themselves in an advantageous position economically. However, for Gentiles, who rarely viewed Jews in a disinterested light, the Jewish distinctive occupational profile was prob- lematic and often viewed as symptomatic of a more profound pathology. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with Jews becoming citizens of the states in which they lived and moving rapidly into the middle class, their economic dis- tinctiveness became a central feature of the debate about their fate and future, what was known at the time as the "Jewish Question." Derek Penslar's Shylock's Children is an expansive treatment of the history of this discourse about Jews and its impact on the self-understanding of Jewish 384</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews elites and their conduct of communal policy. In tracing the origins of modern Gen- tile anxiety about Jewish economic activity, Penslar begins with Greco-Roman and early Christian hostility to trade, attitudes that took shape when there was lit- tle that was distinctive about Jewish economic activity. In the medieval period, Christian theological investment in the idea of Jewish misanthropy, along with the association of Jews and money lending, gave birth to notions of Jewish avarice, materialism, and oppression, while, in the early modern period, the concentration of Jews in low-status, marginal occupations-money lending, pawn broking, pet- ty trade-strengthened these sentiments. In the nineteenth and twentieth cen- turies, with the freeing of social and economic life from earlier restraints, a transformation that benefited Jews, those who saw themselves as victims of this transformation identified Jews as the creators and bearers of modernity and its troubles. Penslar's explanation of the development of Gentile ideas about Jewish economic behavior is richer and more complex than these few sentences suggest. His explanation weaves its way back and forth between changes in material cir- cumstances and shifts in values and ideas. It is both balanced and satisfying. While his themes and materials are not novel, his treatment of them is consis- tently intelligent and instructive. In this regard, let me single out his discussion of German responses to the marked increase in both very rich and very poor Jews in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (Court Jews, on the one hand, and beggars, bandits, and vagabonds, on the other). To shelter the essentialism of their view of Jews from evidence to the contrary, German writers mentally col- lapsed the gap between the two extremes, asserting that both exhibited the same economic sensibility. In the early modern German imagination, rich and poor Jews behaved similarly in the marketplace because they shared common values, which, in turn, derived from a common unitary mentalit&amp;, or essence. All were thieves, profiteers, manipulators, scoundrels, rogues, and the like. In Penslar's words: "The Court Jew and the Jewish bandit were typologically similar; both were pariahs who, coming from the margins of German society, used unconven- tional methods to improve their status. Anti-Semitic sensibility grasped this sim- ilarity, but, by placing it within a pre-existing stereotype of the Jew as usurer, merely transformed and strengthened preexisting prejudices against Jewish eco- nomic behavior" (21). Penslar is less concerned with the history of this discourse, however, than with its impact on Jewish identity and policy from the haskalah on. The disturb- ing truth that emerges from his account is that western Jewish leaders everywhere, including westernized Jews in Eastern Europe, internalized the Gentile belief that Jewish economic life was flawed (in one way or another) and called for its refor- mation or complete overhaul. While less likely to accept the idea that Jewish com- mercial ethics were corrupt, they did accept the notion that the overrepresentation of Jews in commerce was a liability, in large part because it created a bad impres- sion among non-Jews. Maskilim, Zionists, Bolsheviks, and western philanthropists alike believed that too many Jews labored with their minds and not enough with their hands. They repeatedly launched schemes to turn Jewish peddlers, shop- keepers, and salesmen into manual laborers, farmers, craftsmen, and, later, indus- 385</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews trial workers. It is now clear, of course, that theirs was a monumental misunder- standing of macroeconomic trends. As Penslar notes, Jewish proponents of occu- pational restructuring "rarely showed the slightest awareness" that the sectors of the economy in which they wished to direct Jews were in the long run less secure than trade (121). Fortunately for their descendents, most Jews ignored the advice of their leaders on this score. In the second half of the twentieth century, interest in the economic regen- eration of the Jews vanished. As Penslar explains, in the years between the French Revolution and World War II, thinking about the place of the Jews in Europe was linked to anxieties about industrial capitalism and its social consequences. When Europeans came to terms with modernity, however reluctantly and incompletely, commerce lost much of its stigma and Jewish concentration in business much of its problematic character. (The proliferation of American-style business schools in Europe in recent decades is eloquent testimony to this shift in sentiment.) It is not clear how far Penslar wishes to push his notion of the "inextricable linkage" be- tween the "Jewish Question" and "anxiety about the new industrial order" (262). If I understand him correctly, it accounts for more than the rise and fall of the dis- course of Jewish economic dysfunction. More broadly, it would seem to help explain why societies with politically assertive industrial and commercial bour- geoisies who were confident about the universality of their values (the United States and Great Britain) displayed less anti-Semitism than societies in which lib- eral capitalism was less firmly rooted. After all, even in Germany's brief heyday of political liberalism in the 1860s, when publicists and intellectuals hailed com- merce and industry as the saviors of the nation, there was a marked decrease in public concern about Jewish economic distinctiveness. At this time, Penslar writes, "the German middle class's most popular journal, Die Gartenlaube, portrayed Jews in a most positive light, in keeping with its generally high opinion of com- merce as an ennobling activity and its association of parasitism not with Jews but with the idle aristocracy" (139). What we have here is a revival, reworking, and extension of Salo Baron's in- sights about the connection between early capitalism and toleration, briefly devel- oped sixty years ago in the final chapter of his three-volume work The Jewish Community (1942). Because Baron did not complete his magnum opus and thus never fleshed out his thinking about this connection, his work has not been influ- ential in shaping the historiography of the modern period. This is a shame, for Baron saw linkages that have eluded later historians, especially those who have fo- cused on the haskalah and other reformist movements as agents of change. Penslar's revival and deployment of these ideas is most welcome. Todd M. Endelman University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Michigan 386</page></plain_text>
