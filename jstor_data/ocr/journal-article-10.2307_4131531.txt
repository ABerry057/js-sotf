New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. 498 pp. Alexander Samely, Senior Lecturer in Hebrew and Jewish Studies at Man- chester University, has written what I would describe as one of the most detailed 356</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews and precise descriptions of the Mishnah's use of scriptural sources. His book, The Rabbinic Interpretation of Scripture in the Mishnah, a fifteen-chapter work with a glossary of important rabbinic and linguistic terms, two appendices, an excellent bibliography, and thorough indices shows the work of a meticulous scholar and in- cisive and insightful reader of the Bible and mishnaic corpus. Samely's thorough description of the Mishnah's hermeneutics of scriptural interpretation generates a prodigious number of phenomena too manifold and var- ied to present individually. This review will, therefore, confine itself to a general overview of Samely's work. In fairness to the readers of this review and to Same- ly, however, I will provide a digest of Chapters 1-6 in order to give some sense of what Samely has accomplished. Samely begins his work with a hermeneutic orientation and introduction. There he cautions the reader against applying the canons of contemporary reading of the Bible to rabbinic reading of it. While this may be obvious to those whose field of study is rabbinic literature, this warning is important because we must un- derstand what rabbinic scriptural interpretation is and is not. Namely, it is a vari- ety of interpretation, though contemporary critical-historical scholarship might consider it too distant from the "plain meaning" of the text to qualify. Neverthe- less, it is not, as some scholars of rabbinic literature have claimed, some form of etymology or philology. In his introductory chapter (Ch. 1) Samely also speaks of "resources" of rab- binic interpretation. "Resources" is a term Samely uses to describe particular hermeneutic actions the Mishnah uses in interpreting the scriptural text. He prefers this term to "methods" because "methods" implies a universality of approach, and as his book confirms, rabbinic interpretation is exceptionally flexible and often uses more than one hermeneutic action to achieve its interpretational results. In the following chapters, Samely catalogues these resources by type and number, for ex- ample, TopicO. He describes the hermeneutic action that a "resource" indicates and provides a mishnaic example for it. Thus, a TopicO resource is one in which there is a "Tacit use of a specific assumption rooted in the Mishnaic discourse for ex- plication of a Scriptural expression" (p. 411). An example of this appears in mBa- va Qama 9:11 where Numbers 5:8 is applied to a convert rather than to a native Israelite without kin. This interpretation depends, as Samely points out, on the mishnaic assumption that the only person without kin within the Jewish commu- nity is a convert whose legal ties to his or her biological family members are, ac- cording to mishnaic law, sundered (p. 78). Samely ends his opening chapter with a description of the Mishnah, the point that Scripture does not set the order of top- ics for the Mishnah nor does it appear in all mishnayot, an overview of prior schol- arship on rabbinic interpretation of Scripture, and a short description of the contents of Chapters 2-14. In the interests of brevity, I will not review all of these chapters. I will, however, review the essence of Chapters 2-4. Chapter 2 is of great importance to the work. Here Samely introduces us to the linguistics term "co-text," which is the environment in which a word or phrase appears. Samely points out that placement of Scripture into a mishnaic co-text con- stantly acts to remove (or reduce) Scripture's ambiguities (p. 32). Another impor- tant feature of Scripture's appearance in Mishnah is that it generally does not 357</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews appear whole. Rather, Mishnah creates and uses segments of Scripture in its in- terpretations (p. 33ff). This separation of Scripture from its original co-text neu- tralizes that co-text and opens Scripture to almost limitless meaning. Samely posits that this may be the point where rabbinic theology and interpretation meet: The di- vinely authored text by definition should provide infinite meaning and, therefore, an inexhaustible source of potential interpretations (pp. 54-55). Consequently, the meaning of Scripture in Mishnah will ultimately be determined by imposing rab- binic/mishnaic perspective onto the text. How this happens takes up Chapters 3- 4. The example of TopicO I cited above provides a sense of Samely's points in these chapters. Chapter 5, titled "Scripture's Words, Mishnah's Speech," describes how the Mishnah uses Scripture to express itself. An example of this sort of expression oc- curs when Mishnah creates terminology that depends on scriptural references. Thus, for example, the Mishnah speaks of the obligation of sending away the dam before one takes chicks or eggs as npr hwin. This mishnaic term borrows from words used in Deuteronomy 22:6-7. Thus Mishnah expresses itself using Scrip- ture. Samely calls these resources "USE." Samely supplies many other examples of USE resources, but, again, this review is not the place for an exhaustive treat- ment of these examples. Chapter 6 provides examples of what Samely calls "Biblical Events Illustrat- ing Normative and Descriptive Schemata." In cases where Mishnah uses biblical events, they often provide the basis for halakhic norms. The mishnaic use of these scriptural events tends to deemphasize some elements of the original scriptural con- text. Mishnah then provides new features for the event that support its discourse. Thus, R. Yehudah uses the case of David following Abner's bier (2 Samuel 3:31) to prove that a Jewish king may leave his palace to honor someone in this way (mSan- hedrin 2:3). The Sages, who hold that the king may never leave his palace, cite the original context of the narrative (the scriptural "co-text") to refute R. Yehudah's opinion. Samely provides the name NORM for this resource (p. 149-152). I could continue to describe the essence of the various chapters, but I believe this summary of several chapters gives the sense of the work. Those who are in- terested in rabbinic literature can easily see the value of Samely's work as a major contribution to an aspect of the phenomenology of the Mishnah. Yet, for all its val- ue, Samely's work has one major shortcoming: the writing style makes for ex- tremely difficult reading. There is a tremendous amount of technical linguistics terminology in addition to his own specific terminology for the categorization of the "resources" he identifies. Added to this, his resource example, which often pro- vides a picture worth a thousand words, usually follows rather than precedes his detailed but abstract description of the resource. A quote from Samely's book should give the readers of this review a sense of what might stand in the way of their easily penetrating Samely's work. Here is his definition of a "resource" he calls "Cotext5" and a citation of his discussion of its hermeneutic function. Cotext5: Explication of the meaning of an expression in the light of the bib- lical co-text, where the latter is linked by cohesive signals or narrative con- nectedness beyond the clause. 358</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews The existence and frequency of the Cotext5 resource provides a perspective in three important respects: It shows that the "atomistic" Cotextl approach, while prominent, is very far from universal in Mishnaic hermeneutics. (It also demonstrates indirectly that the neutralizing resource Cotext 1 is not the result of negligence or misunder- standing, which would be intrinsically unlikely in any case.) (p. 41) I have tried to be fair in selecting a representative citation by starting at the begin- ning of a section that defines a resource, rather than starting in medias res. The def- inition itself is rather opaque, and when Samely proceeds to compare Cotext5 with what he described earlier as Cotext l, he calls upon the reader to remember what the Cotextl resource was like and how it was defined. True, one can turn to Appendix I for a quick reminder, but there one will find this: "Cotextl: Neutralizing the se- mantic effect of the biblical co-text at the sentence, clause, or phrase-boundary, lead- ing to a readjustment or, if necessary, dissolution of grammatical dependencies." The technical difficulty of this work raises two serious questions: 1. For whom was the book written? and 2. Do the benefits of reading the work outweigh the difficulties of working one's way through the text? Most rabbinics scholars, for better or worse, do not have the technical academic linguistics and literary train- ing that easily facilitates handling Rabbinic Interpretation ofScripture in the Mish- nah, and yet they are the most interested and best-equipped audience to appreciate the phenomena that Samely analyzes. Those academics specifically trained in lin- guistics and literary analysis and criticism might be interested in the phenomena that Samely describes. They, however, do not for the most part have knowledge of any genre of rabbinic literature, let alone the Mishnah, or much preparation for reading it. For them, the technical halakhic issues that occupy much of the mish- naic discourse discussed in Samely's book are likely to be too arcane and legalis- tically oriented to manage. Samely states in his conclusion that his work creates a type (as in the Greek usage) of analysis and description that can be used with appropriate modification in the study of "the interpretation of Homer by the Greeks, the Muslim commen- taries on the Qur'an, or the interpretation of Scripture by the Church Fathers ... ." (p. 393). This suggests that Rabbinic Interpretation of Scripture in the Mishnah is for everyone. It appears to me, however, that it is best suited for those with good rabbinics and linguistics backgrounds or, lacking those accomplishments, consid- erable perseverance. In sum, Samely's book is a treasure trove of analysis and cataloging of the Mishnah's ways of interpreting the TaNaKh. Even the academically trained read- er, however, must be prepared to work hard to mine its gems.
