<plain_text><page sequence="1">Margalit Shilo. Princess or Prisoner: Jewish Women in Jerusalem, 1840-1914. Trans. David Louvish. Waltham, MA: Brandeis University Press, 2005. 330 pp. For Jews, Jerusalem has always been considered "sacred space," and those privileged to dwell there were viewed as having achieved an additional attribute in their spiritual composition. Most studies of Jerusalemites throughout the ages, or at least until the contemporary period, have concentrated on the male narrative, focusing on religious ritual, Torah study, and prayer as their framework. By doing so, they automatically excluded the history of women or relegated them to the periphery, viewing them more as objects rather than subjects of study. Margalit Shilo, in her pathbreaking study Princess or Prisoner: Jewish Women in Jerusalem, 1840-1914, has retrieved the voices of Jewish women in Jerusalem during the end of Otttoman rule of the Holy Land. Using a plethora of primary sources, women's memoirs, letters, and the contemporary press, she has uncovered the long-silenced female narrative of daily life from the mid- nineteenth century until the beginning of World War I. Originally published in Hebrew by Haifa University Press, her book now joins a small but expanding group of academic studies and sources available to the English-speaking reader, such as those by Ruth Lamdan (A Separate People: Jewish Women in Palestine, Syria, and Egypt in the Sixteenth Century) and Susan Sered (The Religious Lives of Elderly Jewish Women in Jerusalem), which deal with women's lives and activities in the Holy Land from medieval until modem times. 1. My only quibble concerns Ferziger's description of a responsum of Hoffmann (177-78). Ferziger describes one of the issues as dealing with "plates upon which the [possibly nonkosher] food had been served." Yet Hoffmann's concern is not primarily (if at all) with the plates, which have the status of keli sheni, but with the pots in which the possibly nonkosher food was cooked. 466</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews The six chapters of the book are devoted to what the author considers to be the pivotal issues in the female experience of the period: immigration, marriage, home, public sphere, scholarship and education, and finally, women on the margins of society (poverty, widowhood, husband desertion, prostitution, and missionary efforts). Shilo begins her study by discussing the phenomenon of women- widowed, divorced, and married-who came to the Land of Israel on a quest for spiritual fulfillment. This quasi-monastic immigration set the tone for much of these and other women's lives in the Holy City, which were punctu- ated by poverty, self-sacrifice, and the sanctification of suffering. Surprisingly, female initiative was found in the field of maintaining "sacred space." Some women took upon themselves the duty of maintaining the cleanliness of the Western Wall court or of Rachel's tomb, sweeping the area and decorating the entrance. Other women sat along the path to the wall during the hot summer months, offering cool water to visitors or proffering fragrant citron fruit or spices at the entrance to the court to enable them to recite additional blessings. As Shilo rightly points out, this was both a religious female ritual in a field that was usually mandated by men and also one of empowerment. Though their domestic lives were often regulated by outside forces, at the Western Wall and other sacred sites, women "were granted a degree of auton- omy: it was they who determined the times of assembly, the style of prayer, and the care for the site." And yet, a slightly different analysis shows that, in truth, women were not "granted" a degree of autonomy, to use Shilo's phrase, but in a number of these cases appropriated it for themselves, empowering Jewish women through independent action, not by receiving this right from others. Despite her charac- terization of most Jewish women of the Old Yishuv as prisoners rather than princesses, Shilo reveals that female empowerment-even just creating a female society devoid of direct male influence-permeated women's spheres of life. Marriage in Jerusalem, Shilo notes, was considered a public duty and not only a private necessity. Often conducted among minors who were moved around by their parents like human chess pieces, it was only around the turn of the century that the age of marriage in the Holy City was raised. However, once within the bonds of marriage, women would de facto rule the private sphere, even when they were limited by regulations, such as those prohibiting women under the age of fifty from approaching the door of the public oven so as not to encounter men. Similar to their Muslim counterparts, women's domestic lives were almost completely separate from those of men, allowing them to develop their own socioeconomic system and to mandate the regulations of their own closed circle. What were the vehicles for change in women's status? Shilo explains how the dual influences of education and New Yishuv immigration eventually became major cultural influences leading to female emancipation. However, this was an evolutionary and not a revolutionary process, accelerated by the events of World War I. Women on the margins of society, to whom Shilo 467</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews devotes her final chapter, were largely unaffected by these changes. Impover- ished widows and deserted wives could not receive allocations from the exist- ing Jerusalem kollels and so were completely dependent on charitable benevolence. Prostitutes, often considered to have empowered themselves in one sense, were social outcasts, marginal even on the margins. And the trump card for more than one woman in debate with a male protector, father, husband, or patriarchal community leader was still that of invoking outside forces, the threat of "going to the mission," turning to the church for conversion if their demands were not met. Two issues continued to trouble me as I read what is otherwise an erudite and innovative book. The first is the absence of a strong theoretical framework, which could have been grounded in one of several spheres: fem- inist theory or any of the existing or emerging socioeconomic theories pertain- ing to colonial or even precolonial societies. Shilo does state at the outset that she plans to "thicken the narrative" by interspersing a theoretical framework within her description of each issue, yet this intention often remains within the realm of wishful thinking. Instead of the brief introduction and epilogue devoted to a number of historical-cultural insights, it might have been more useful to use one of these to locate the topic being discussed within a theoretical or at least a broader comparative framework than that which appears. This brings me to the second issue that deserves consideration: the dis- crepancy between the subtitle "Jewish Women in Jerusalem, 1840-1914" and the book's contents. Shilo's study of Jerusalem is, in truth, not a study of Jerusalem but of women in all of Eretz Yisrael during the years in question. Shilo herself states at the outset that she cites comparisons between the women of Jerusalem and those of other Jewish communities in Eretz Yisrael such as Safed, Tiberias, and Hebron. However, once caught up in her descriptions of female society, it is only later that the reader realizes that the contents did not pertain to Jerusalem but to other cities. At times, despite the natural scientific inclination toward specification, one feels that the book should have been titled "Jewish Women in the Holy Land." This, however, is not meant to distract from the book's scholarship. On the contrary, Shilo's modest title belies the wealth of knowledge about Jewish women's lives in all of the Old Yishuv during the latter half of the nineteenth century and the early years of the twentieth century, and not only about those in Jerusalem. Many of the descriptions in Shilo's fascinating and in-depth study were no longer applicable by the third decade of the twentieth century, as social, economic, and political changes had transformed the face of Jewish society in Eretz Yisrael. By that time, some of the mores and patterns of the New Yishuv had slowly begun to influence women of the Old Yishuv in the spheres of marriage, education, and even homemaking. Yet her narrative, which covers what can be termed "the beginning of the end" of traditional female Jewish society in Jerusalem, is a fascinating historical tapestry that preserves a picture of a world gone by. 468</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews Despite these few reservations, Shilo's work is an important contribution to scholarship and recommended to those interested in the Old Yishuv, as well the female narrative of the nineteenth-century Middle East.
