<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review 30:2 (2006), 393-425 FROM SEPHARAD TO ASHKENAZ: A CASE STUDY IN THE RASHI SUPERCOMMENTARY TRADITION by Eric Lawee Though much has been done in the past half century to clarify boundaries and crossing points on the religious-intellectual maps of "Ashkenaz" and "Sepharad,"' a large body of evidence that advances this complex exercise in cul- tural cartography has been wholly neglected: supercommentaries on Rashi's Com- mentary on the Torah. Though it was produced in that part of Europe that Jews came to call (perhaps under Rashi's influence) "Ashkenaz,"2 the Commentary tra- veled to points far and wide. Among the diverse responses that it elicited in its new homes, the vast supercommentary literature that came to surround the Commen- tary stands out.3 Though scholars working in diverse cultural orbits produced 1.

This genre continues to flourish, at times in new forms.4 Yet although some of the major rab- binic figures (e.g., Judah Loew of Prague) produced Rashi supercommentaries, and although these works reflect significant trends in premodern Judaism, the genre's neglect among scholars has been well-nigh total.5 This essay illustrates cross-cultural interactivity as it has played out in the supercommentaries by following the fate of one of Rashi's glosses in early modem Ashkenazic literature. In particular, it highlights a "Hispanizing" trend that emerged as the center of gravity of Rashi supercommentary shifted from medieval Iberia to early modem northern and eastern Europe. The gloss in question, adduced by Rashi on Talmudic authority, taught that prior to Eve's creation, "Adam mated with every [species of] beast and animal but was not assuaged by them." As this gloss migrated from northern France to Iberia and then to the early modem Ashkenazic centers of learning, it was imbued with meanings that reflected the particular religious views and sensibilities of Rashi's increasingly numerous commentators and the cultural milieus in which they wrote. Almost to a one, Rashi's immediate Ashkenazic successors under- stood the midrashic gloss literally. To a one, Spanish supercommentators urged Readers," to appear in Maimonides after 800 Years: Essays on Maimonides and His Influence, ed.

After recapturing this "Sephardic interpretation," as it is more fully docu- mented elsewhere,6 and tracing its continuation in Hispano-Jewish tradition and its offshoots into the early modem period, this study illustrates the widespread Ashkenazic acceptance of-and at times vociferous insistence on-one or another "Hispanized" interpretation of Rashi's midrashic comment. The essay also describes the obliviousness of some, and the stiff resistance of others, to such Hispanizing interpretations in the early modem Ashkenazic domain. To fill out the picture, some of the other forces that affected sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Ashkenazic engagement with midrash and with Rashi's midrashic gloss are noted, among them the advent and vagaries of printing and the unrelenting assault on rabbinic discourse emanating from the church. For some prominent Ashkenazic scholars, Christian condemnations of midrash pressed the problem of Rashi's claim that Adam had mated with animals, inten- sifying an already prodigious struggle to explain this problematic pronouncement in a way that was hermeneutically tenable, religiously acceptable, and spiritually edifying. As Genesis 2 famously relates, God, recognizing that it was "not good" for the first human being to be alone, resolved to make "a fitting helper" for him. God then created "the wild beasts" and "birds of the sky" and presented these newly formed creatures to the first human being "to see what he would call them." With the discovery that "for Adam no fitting helper was found," God placed Adam in a deep sleep, created a woman from his side, and brought her to him, at which point Adam exclaimed, "this time-bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh" (Genesis 2:15-23). Adam's cry "this time" (zot ha-pa 'am) raised a surfeit of exegetical and theological questions,7 not least because of its apparent allusion to an unstated prior event or series of events: "this time," unlike previous ones, or, if zot is under- stood nominally rather than adjectivally, "this one" (i.e., Eve), unlike previous ones. Picking up on this textual "surface irregularity,"8 a Talmudic midrash written in the name of R. Eleazar rather graphically reported a detail not related in the Torah: "[W]hy does scripture say 'this time ...'? It teaches that Adam mated with (she-ba' 'adam 'al) every [species of] beast (behemah) and animal (hayyah) but his appetite was not assuaged (lo' nitkarerah da 'ato) until he mated with Eve."9 Rashi recorded the midrash in his gloss on Genesis 2:23 but in compressed and slightly altered form: "'this time'-it teaches that Adam mated with every [species of] beast and animal but his appetite was not assuaged 6. See my study in "The Reception of Rashi's Commentary on the Torah in Spain: The Case of Adam's Mating with the Animals," Jewish Quarterly Review 97 (forthcoming). 7.

Yevamot 63a. 395</page><page sequence="4">Eric Lawee by them."'1 In so doing, Rashi deftly integrated Adam's speech into the larger pericope in which it appeared, with that pericope's interposition of the animals' cre- ation between the finding that it was "not good" for Adam to be alone and Eve's cre- ation. In short, by summoning R. Eleazar's midrash, Rashi realized his overall exegetical aim of uncovering scripture's contextual sense (peshuto shel mikra') and transmitting such rabbinic dicta as clarified, or at least comported with, that sense." As Rashi conveyed R. Eleazar's exposition without qualm, so, too, did late medieval Ashkenazic scholars cite it in ways that indicated their acceptance of its literal sense, even as they were challenged by the midrash on other levels. One problem was the midrash's openness to polemical attack. As early as the twelfth century, the Hispano-Jewish convert to Christianity Petrus Alfonsi, who passed his closing years in northern Europe, sought to discredit Judaism by adducing ostensibly scandalous specimens of rabbinic discourse.12 In the thirteenth century, Christian polemic focused increasingly on classical Judaism's midrashic inheritance. In 1236, Nicholas Donin submitted a litany of thirty-five ostensibly reprehensible rabbinic dicta to Pope Gregory IX, R. Eleazar's midrash among them. As confirmation of the saying's purport and repellent content, Donin cited Rashi's gloss (glosa Salomonis) to it in his Talmud commentary, wherein Rashi had clarified the midrash's textual point of departure while frankly depicting the scenario envisaged by its rabbinic expositor: "[The biblical text says] 'this time'-whence it may be inferred that he [Adam] had coitus (shimmesh) on other occasions [with others, namely beasts and animals] but they did not meet with his approval."'13 Donin cited R. Eleazar again in the "Talmud trial" at Paris in 1240. A Latin "confession" had the main Jewish disputant, Yehiel ben Joseph, "conceding" presumably with deep embarrassment-Adam's coitus with all the beasts while yet in paradise.14 By contrast, the Hebrew version of the trial had Yehiel stoutly defending R. Eleazar's "correct inference" as drawn from scripture, which was to be understood in terms of the absence of any prohibition on bestiality at this 10.

Rashi concludes his formulation with the idea that Adam was left unsatisfied "by them" (bahem). This conclusion is absent from the Talmudic dictum, which ends with the additional point (omitted by Rashi) that Adam's appetite was "assuaged" after mating with Eve. 11.

Polemic and halakhic considerations aside, R. Eleazar's exposition could have given Ashkenazic writers pause. The thirteenth-century northern French exegete Hezekiah ben Manoah fretted momentarily over the challenge that it posed to the harmony of the rabbinic record. Hezekiah was not one to "refute the words of our Rabbi Solomon [Rashi]." At most, he would "augment" them.17 In explaining "this time," Hezekiah initially "augmented" (that is, departed from) Rashi, then doubled back to analyze his predecessor's midrashic interpretation. His own reading remained within the confines of the biblically attested data, taking "this time" as a reference to a one-time inversion of the natural order to be: "[O]n this occasion a female issued from a male whereas hen- ceforth it will not be thus but rather the male will issue from the female." Hezekiah felt constrained to relate to Rashi's gloss, however, with its Talmudically vouch- safed extrabiblical material, out of a characteristic Tosafist concern: the conun- drum generated by this midrash in light of another that taught that intermating between humans and beasts rendered the animal participant sterile.'8 Hezekiah's query projected onto the primordial subhuman creatures a single first model despite scripture's suggestion that they were created in collectivities. If each species also had a unique first exemplar, there arose the problem that the primor- dial animals all should have become extinct while they were still in the garden because of the sterility induced by intercourse with Adam. Hezekiah's solution was to say that these creatures had conceived the next generation of their kinds before Adam mated with them.19 The early fourteenth-century Judah ben Eleazar, who hailed from Rashi's native Troyes, posed an identical problem and the same solution, leaning on Hezekiah for support.20 What matter currently, however, are two points. First, these authors' momentary consternation over Rashi's gloss presupposed a literal understanding of Adam's sexual relations with primordial beasts. Second, what troubled these scholars was an apparent incongruity in the Talmudic corpus-the moral-religious implications of Adam's multiple acts of bestiality perturbed them not at all. 15. R.

After putting the original Talmudic version of the midrash in Rashi's mouth,21 one writer exclaimed, "Amazing (temah)!" How, in the single hour that the midrashic tradition has Adam spending in the garden,22 could he "have had intercourse with myriad myriads [of creatures]?" This inquiry spurred an abandonment of the full- scale literalist reading of Rashi: "[O]ne might answer (yesh lomar) that [what Rashi means is that] he [Adam] saw each and every pair [of animals] mating and it did not seem to him as though he could be assuaged [sexually] through [any of] them."23 This was a departure from literalism that was thoroughly Ashkenazic in character: It applied standard Tosafist formulae (temah, yesh lomar) to Rashi's text,24 Tosafistically read one midrash in light of another, and objected to Adam's multiple acts of bestiality on purely logistical rather than moral-religious grounds. If, as the foregoing examples give vivid reminder, literalism was the rule in medieval Ashkenazic interpretations of midrash, things were otherwise in southern Mediterranean Jewish centers. Building on precedents of the geonic east, Andalusi-Jewish scholars developed an approach to the interpretation of non- legal midrash that eventually spread to Christian Spain, southern France, Italy, and beyond. According to this approach, nonliteral exegesis of rabbinic sayings was often valid and sometimes required.25 The cleavage between north and south emerged starkly during the controversies over rationalism of the 1230s. In often vituperative exchanges, northern European savants urged the necessity of literal reverence in interpreting rabbinic sayings. Some, like the Tosafist Samson ben Abraham, found the alternative hard to imagine,26 whereas others demanded 21. For the slight distinction, see n. 10 herein. 22.

Whereas Yehiel of Paris, Hezekiah ben Manoah, and other northern Euro- pean scholars assumed its plain sense without amazement, Spanish writers imbued it with noetic significance. The first of Rashi's Spanish supercommentators to do so was an anonymous contemporary of the turnm-of-the-fifteenth-century grammarian and exegete Isaac ben Moses Halevi (Profet Duran). According to his understanding, Adam's mating with beasts meant that "he engaged in intense and ongoing investigation and careful study into each and every species and discerned its nature and tempera- ment and the nature of all the [other] species but failed to find a nature fitting and disposed to his nature."29 This writer may have derived the kernel of his approach from the fourteenth-century Navarrese rabbi Shem Tov ben Shaprut, who, in his aggadic commentary Pardes rimmonim, set forth a cognitive reading of the midrash on Adam and the animals in the briefest form.30 As elaborated by Duran's contemporary, Shem Tov's approach yielded a reading of Rashi's gloss that had Adam searching not for a biological partner but for a rational soul mate. Other Spanish supercommentators allowed the ultimately sexual (or, more precisely, procreative) aim of Adam's zoological researches while arguing the cog- nitive nature of his interaction with the beasts. Rashi's reference to Adam's inter- species mating was "a figurative expression for his examining the temperaments of the females among all the species,"31 explained Samuel Almosnino, although Adam's aim in doing so was to find a female who might provide a "receptacle 27.

Upon determining that no subhuman female was suitable for this purpose and that Eve was, Adam "had intercourse with her"-literally-with his wish (or perhaps only willingness) to do so pre- mised on the fact that "from her he would obtain fruit of the womb."32 Moses ibn Gabbai, an Aragonese Talmudist who wrote a supercommentary on Rashi in North Africa around 1420, also concluded that Rashi's gloss on "this time" should not be understood "according to its prima facie meaning" (kifeshu- tah). His premise-which was rejected by Yehiel of Paris and other Ashkenazic authorities-was that Adam was subject to a divine injunction against bestiality before Eve's creation. If Adam was apprised of the "Noahide laws" that would eventually bind all humankind, then in speaking of Adam's relations with animals, Rashi could only have meant that Adam "came with his intellect and investigated the nature and temperament of every beast and animal." Only with Eve did Adam's search for a mate reach a physically intimate conclusion.33 Ibn Gabbai's son-in-law, Aaron Aboulrabi, a native of Aragonese Sicily and author of a hybrid Torah commentary and Rashi supercommentary, came to a similar con- clusion (Adam "investigated with his intellect the dispositions of all living things") after registering revulsion at the prospect that Adam, the most "perfect" of humans, could have engaged in "intercourse with one not of his species."34 As the Middle Ages segued into early modem times, Sephardic writers added new nuances to the cognitive interpretation of R. Eleazar's dictum. Whereas earlier Spanish writers had cognitively reconfigured the midrash's initial reference to Adam's mounting of animals, Isaac Arama sought to show the necessity of this reading by emphasizing the verbal formulation in the second part of the midrash, which spoke of Adam's da 'at (lo' nitkarerah da'ato) remaining unsatisfied on these encounters. Patent it was, therefore, that Adam's "intercourse" with subhuman creatures referred to a meeting in his mind (da 'ato)-that is, to his "discerning reflection on the animals and their nature."35 Arama's contemporary, Isaac Abarbanel, a Lisbon-born transplant to Castile who was writing in Italian exile after the Spanish Expulsion of 1492, was equally at pains to establish the intellectual character of Adam's relations with the animals (the pains were reduced considerably, however, by his liberal borrowing from Arama's interpretation of R. Eleazar's homily).36 In both Arama's and Abarbanel's reconstructions, Adam's cognitive study yielded an 32. Philip, Perush 'Almosnino, 23. 33.

Eleazar's exposition on "this time," so the question arises, why did Arama and Abarbanel not do the same? Several possibilities suggest themselves. Arama and Abarbanel might have learned of the obloquy to which this exposition had been subjected by Chris- tians. Leaving aside Donin's attack of centuries earlier, of which they were pre- sumably ignorant, there was the summons of this midrash as a specimen of Talmudic blasphemy in the disputation of Tortosa and San Mateo (1413-14) and a renewed critique of it in the mid-fifteenth-century anti-Jewish and anticon- verso tract, Fortalitium fidei, by the Spanish Franciscan Alonso de Espina.38 One reason that Iberian scholars such as Arama and Abarbanel invested effort in the midrash, then, was their need to rehabilitate a rabbinic saying that had been migh- tily impugned by Judaism's enemies. At the same time, as they so often did, Arama and Abarbanel may have viewed the midrash, rightly understood, as a valu- able instrument of discovery in providing their audiences with a deeper under- standing of holy writ. Reading challenging midrashim in sophisticated ways was a method favored by both writers to make scripture speak the religiously edifying language their listeners and readers prized.39 However, even as both Arama and Abarbanel ascribed R. Eleazar's midrash to "our sages" in their collec- tivity, there is reason to believe that these exegetes focused on it because of its appearance in Rashi's Commentary. Other passages in Abarbanel's writings reflect such a pattern.40 As for Arama, there is subtle textual evidence that his concern with R. Eleazar's midrash was born of or heightened by its invocation by Rashi. Though he cast it as "their [the rabbinic sages'] saying," Arama cited the midrash in Rashi's distinctive reformulation of it.41 Evidence that Rashi's broadcast of Adam's mating with animals drew the attention of Iberian scholars of the "generation of the expulsion" is more clearly forthcoming from the Torah commentary of Isaac Caro.42 Unlike Arama and 37. For Abarbanel's interpretation, see Perush 'al ha-torah, 3 vols. (Jerusalem: Benei Arabel, 1964), 1:97. Departing from the midrash to align its underlying idea with Genesis 2:19, Arama and Abarbanel cast the beasts and the birds as Adam's intellectual consorts. 38.

Caro carried the Spanish reading of Adam's congress with animals from Iberia to Constantinople at the turn of the sixteenth century, when the most influ- ential Rashi supercommentary ever written was in progress.45 Writing in Caro's new home, Elijah Mizrahi, the foremost rabbinic authority of the Ottoman Empire, offered a reading of Rashi's gloss on "this time" in which Sephardic sen- sibilities were wholly absent. He began his characteristically thorough analysis of the gnomic gloss by supplying the reader with Rashi's rabbinic source and citing the gloss on it found in Rashi's Talmud commentary-something his Spanish fore- runners had forborne to do. Mizrahi then raised a problem: From the plain sense of Genesis, it was by no means clear that the first couple had engaged in sexual relations during their encounter, as described in Genesis 2:23. Mizrahi responded that a closer reading proved otherwise: "Bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh" did, in fact, imply that it was of "copulation" that Adam spoke. Mizrahi para- phrased Rashi accordingly: "This time my partner [in sexual intercourse] was 'bone of my bone' whereas previously she was from the rest of the animals who are not 'bone of my bone'-whence it may be derived that he [Adam] copu- lated with them [the animals]."46 In a concluding comment, Mizrahi allowed that Rashi might only have derived the first couple's sexual congress while still in the garden (as opposed to after their expulsion from it) from a later verse, "the man knew his wife Eve" (Genesis 4:1).47 Regardless, he left no doubt that as the first human couple had become "one flesh" sexually prior to their transgression, 43.

The connection between Adam's naming of the animals and his discovery of their incompatibility with him had already been stressed in the Rashi supercommentary of Duran's contemporary; see n. 29 herein. Saadya Gaon was, it would seem, a pioneer on this score; see Perushei rav Sa 'adya Ga 'on li-vereshit, ed. Moshe Zucker (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1988), 279. Like Almosnino, Caro stressed that, even in his thoughts, Adam restricted his consideration to females. A later critic foregrounds the implied homosexual element in R. Eleazar's dictum; see n. 70 herein. 45. Though Mizrahi considered his Rashi supercommentary (published without a title by his son) to be his major work, it has garnered no sustained modem scholarly study (see n. 5 herein); by contrast, it was the object of intensive premodern analysis. See Moshe Philip, ed., introduction to Humash ha-re'em, 6 vols. (Petah-Tikvah, 1994), 1:16-23. Epitomes include Isaac Ha-Kohen of Ostrog's Matenot 'ani (Prague, 1609); see Elbaum, Petihut, 385. 46. Philip, Humash ha-re 'em, 1:63 47.

As the sixteenth century wore on, Mizrahi's literalist approach to R. Eleazar's midrash would compete with a Hispanically inflected one in the many Ottoman centers where Sephardic cultural and religious sensibilities had rapidly diffused after 1492. Witness the reading of the midrash in the Torah com- mentary of Moses Alsheikh, who was student in the major postexpulsion Sephar- dic center of Solonika before joining the galaxy of scholars gathered in Safed at midcentury. Following Sephardic precedent, Alsheikh treated R. Eleazar's midrash, and, like his Spanish forerunners, he identified the locus of the encounter between Adam and the primordial beasts as Adam's "intellect."48 Like Arama, Alsheikh made good on this reading by unpacking the idiom lo' nitkarerah da 'ato. Being in a state of aloneness, which would make "prurient thoughts" (hir- hurim) inevitable-thoughts that could only "elevate the temperature" of his desire-Adam surmised that knowledge of the existence of a fitting female partner might cool his latent lust "even were he not to make an advance on her." Seeking such an intellectual-moral prophylactic-indeed, surmising that the animals might have been assigned to his domain for this very purpose- Adam mated with the beasts "in his thought," only to learn that no cerebral encounter sufficed to quell his nascent sexual passion. Rescuing the first human being before he fell prey (in thought if not deed) to his incipient sensual desires, God put Adam to sleep and created Eve before Adam sinned by "harbor- ing prurient thoughts."49 Alsheikh's emulation of the Sephardic approach to R. Eleazar's midrash comes as no surprise. Trained in Solonika under Joseph Taitazak, the son of a Spanish exile, Alsheikh was immersed in Sephardic habits of thought from a young age.50 In addition, one wonders whether-like his Iberian predecessors Arama, Abarbanel, and Caro-Alsheikh's consideration of R. Eleazar's midrash was not at least partially stirred by the midrash's appearance in Rashi's Commentary. The suspicion is certainly warranted. Those in Taitazak's circle paid the Commentary special regard.51 As variations on the Sephardic interpretation of R. Eleazar's midrash echoed in new centers, segments of the Ashkenazic world were undergoing a cul- tural transformation that was shaped decisively by the advent of Sephardic intel- lectual sensibilities and exegetical trends in northern and eastern Europe. The spiritual upheaval left marks on theological trends, interpretive methodologies, homiletical styles, and other areas of intellectual endeavor and religious life. 48.

Both radical new departures and traditional- ist reactions to them are attested in the innumerable pages of Aggadah commen- tary and Rashi supercommentary produced by sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Ashkenazic scholars.52 A survey of the fate of Rashi's gloss on "this time" in different genres of early modem Ashkenazic literature-and the Rashi super- commentaries in particular-handsomely illustrates the point. II The Ashkenazic scientific-philosophical renaissance was modest by Medi- terranean standards.53 An early sign of its advent was the philosophically informed anti-Christian argumentation found in Sefer ha-nizahon, a turn-of-the-fifteenth- century "summa against heresies" penned by the Prague rabbi Yom Tov Lipmann Miihlhausen. By Miihlhausen's day, however, a number of Ashkenazic scholars were already studying Maimonides' Guide and other rationalist Jewish tomes.54 The advent of printing stimulated awareness of and sustained interest in new corpora of learning. In Poland and beyond, mechanical reproduction of the written word created "new audiences for new kinds of knowledge."55 As a result, the Ashkenazi library "lost its exclusivity" as northern and eastern European readers now consulted a variety of Sephardic offerings in biblical exegesis, hala- khah, philosophy, and Kabbalah.56 Northern and eastern European rabbinic acade- mies "became awash in books by medieval Sephardic scholars who had previously been only names or occasional citations."57 The impress of new ideas and materials for study was evident in the writings of the towering sixteenth-century Polish halakhist Moses Isserles; in the growing Ashkenazic interest in dogmatics, 52.

Ashkenazic writers imbibed new interpretive approaches to classical Jewish texts not only from the classic work of Sephardic rationalism, Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed, but also-and perhaps especially-from more recent writers representing medieval Ibero-Jewish culture's "conservative" rationalist wing. Isaac Arama's homiletical classic was especially admired, and Abarbanel's and Caro's biblical exegesis also won acclaim. The anthology of aggadic interpret- ation composed by another Iberian refugee, Jacob ibn Habib, also proved influen- tial.59 Although rationalism yielded little in the north by way of methodical philosophic literature, it had a "decisive" effect on Ashkenazic biblical and rabbi- nic interpretation.60 According to Jacob Elbaum, the many supercommentaries on Rashi composed by early modem Ashkenazic writers offer evidence of the "crea- tive directions and characteristic spiritual links" of early modem Ashkenazic writing generally.61 One would expect, therefore, that these works would mirror the new turns in Ashkenazic exegesis and theology and the controversies they sparked. When it came to Rashi's gloss on "this time," the supercommentaries did not disappoint. Writers associated with Prague led the way in reconfiguring Rashi's gloss along Sephardic lines, and little wonder: Standing on the periphery of Ashkenazic culture, Prague was first among northern Europe's Jewish communities to absorb the intellectual trends associated with the south.62 Several factors provided impetus for the new climate of reflection in this foremost of Bohemian Jewish centers. In the late sixteenth century, there was a general openness to new learning as a result of the intellectual ferment associated with Rudolfine Prague, which Rudolf II had turned into the capital of his empire. What is more, the Hapsburg emperor had himself passed eight years in Spain and exhibited a fascination with things Spanish.63 Even earlier, however, a more significant force for 58.

These tomes, now composed not only in Latin but also in German, Italian, and other languages, by turns charged the rabbinic sages with immorality, blasphemy, and per- versity. Their titles had an increasingly menacing ring.65 In 1553, antirabbinic words turned into anti-Talmudic deeds against the backdrop of the spiritual antagonism gen- erated by the Counter-Reformation. Cardinal Caraffa, soon to become Pope Paul IV, adopted a stridently anti-Jewish policy, and the Roman Inquisition issued a decree requiring that all copies of the Talmud in Rome be burned. Throughout the remainder of the decade, other Italian cities followed suit.66 Beyond Italy, Prague was the main center of anti-Talmudic agitation.67 Among the warrants that Pope Julius III gave for the Talmud's destruction was its alleged espousal of ideas that were contrary to morality. As we have seen, R. Eleazar's assertion that Adam mated with beasts had appeared as an unwitting witness for the prosecution in the Paris Talmud trial of 1240. Departing slightly from Donin's anathema in the disputation of Tortosa and San Mateo, the Jewish apostate Jer6nim de Santa Fe stressed R. Eleazar's ascription of iniquity to primordial man in his period of prelapsarian obedience. Here was a scandalous bit of rabbinic theology that flatly contradicted scripture's attestation that "God saw all the things He had made and found them very good" (Genesis 1:31). To bolster his critique, Jer6nim cited Rashi's Talmudic gloss on R. Eleazar's saying.68 Alonso de Espina continued the assault a half century later.69 64.

Drawing on Alonso's Fortalitium and, most likely, on the most famous Spanish work of anti-Jewish polemic, Pugio fidei, the anonymous Li Errori &amp; Impieta Retrouate Nelli Libri Del Thalmud included R. Eleazar's statement in a list of sixty offensive passages.70 Based on this work, Sixtus of Siena, a Jewish apostate who oversaw the incineration of more than 10,000 Hebrew books in Cremona in 1559, con- demned R. Eleazar's midrash in his Bibliotheca Sancta of 1566, highlighting its homosexual implications, which some earlier glossators on Rashi had quietly tried to dispel.71 Christians in northern Europe attacked R. Eleazar's midrash as well and, if Yom Tov Miihlhausen can be believed, it was the midrash's inclusion in Rashi's Commentary that spurred some of its notoriety in Christian circles.72 The "here- tics" (read: Christians) who had fastened on the midrash had done so not to malign the rabbinic sages, reported the Bohemian rabbi, but to impugn Rashi, though just how he knew he did not say.73 (Perhaps he became aware of this censure of Rashi from the 1399 public disputation in Prague, whose occurrence he reported elsewhere.)74 To fend off the critics, Miihlhausen proposed a novel interpretation of R. Eleazar's midrash predicated on the view that the idiom ba' 'al need not be understood as "the language of copulation." Indeed, so understood, Rashi's words posed the insuperable logistical hurdle that "it is impossible for the largest of giants to copulate with a mouse or weasel."75 Rather, 'ba' 'al' could be said of anyone "who goes out seeking, as in: 'so-and-so went seeking them out for war' (ba' 'alehem la-milhamah); 'they went seeking them out for slander (ba 'u 'alehem ba- 'alilot)."

For the purposes of reductio ad absurdum, Miihlhausen took the comprehensive verbal for- mulation "all [species of] animal and beast" at its words, though R. Eleazar and Rashi might have had only larger animals in mind.

Learning there was not-he was "not assuaged" until he paired with Eve.76 Writing in the tense religious atmosphere of early-fifteenth- century Prague, where theological criticism was rife and religious reforms associ- ated with Jan Hus were in the air, Miihlhausen thus cleared the charges laid by "naysayers (pokerim)" of Rashi who found fodder for ridicule in his gloss on "this time." Miihlhausen wrote at a turning point when "the guiding hermeneutic of Ash- kenazic theology ceased to be the principle of loyalty to the literal sense ... of talmudic aggadah."77 Sixteenth-century Ashkenazic supercommentaries exem- plify this trend. Solomon Luria, one of the twin pillars (along with Moses Isserles) of Ashkenazic rabbinic learning, was the first to depart from the traditional Ashkenazic interpretation of R. Eleazar's midrash in a work of this sort. An opponent of philosophy's encroachments on rabbinic learning (a point made plain in a famous exchange of letters with Isserles),78 if not necessarily of philo- sophic study simply, Luria was clearly uneasy about Rashi's understanding of "this time." Yet, taking his bearings from Rashi's Talmud Commentary, he was constrained to admit that Rashi had understood R. Eleazar literally. Mindful of the rabbinic decree not to dispute a distinguished scholar after his death, Luria nonetheless suggested, in spare words, that Rashi's interpretation might have missed the mark and that R. Eleazar had "not necessarily intended copulation [by the phrase ba ' 'al]." Rather, what this rabbinic sage could have meant was that Adam "approached [the animals] in thought (ba' ba-mahashavah)."79 This abandonment of the medieval Ashkenazic interpretation of R. Eleazar went a step beyond Miihlhausen's but at a slight exegetical cost. Whereas Miihlhausen had done justice to the full idiom "ba ' 'al" in interpreting R. Eleazar and had retained the connection between Rashi's gloss and physical activity on Adam's part ("he went out seeking to investigate"), Luria elided R. Eleazar's words (reading ba ' for ba ' 'al) so as to have this sage ascribe an act of pure intellection to the first human exemplar. Hayyim ben Bezalel of Friedberg, author of Be'er mayyim hayyim, a combined Torah commentary and supercommentary on Rashi, also denied that the midrash on "this time" was meant to be taken literally. Unlike Luria, Hayyim was certain that Rashi had not fallen into this error. "Heaven forefend" that the mating of which Rashi had spoken denoted copulation, intoned Hayyim, who followed Miihlhausen (without attribution) in asking how it was possible for "the largest of giants to copulate with a mouse or weasel." Expanding Miihlhausen's taxonomy of phrases beginning with ba ' al, Hayyim posited a usage not mentioned by his Bohemian predecessor: an encounter with others 76.

So understood, what Rashi meant was that Adam had "mated with them [the animals] in thought, seeking among them to see which species might be appropriate for him as a mate."80 That Solomon Luria should have forged an interpretation of Rashi's gloss redolent of earlier Sephardic ones is unexpected, but that Hayyim ben Bezalel did so is less surprising.81 Hayyim reported that he had studied the Bible with a highly esteemed Spanish mentor in his youth and that these lessons had included inquiry into Rashi's Commentary.82 III The most elaborate-and radical-reinterpretation of the midrash on "this time" to issue from the pen of an early modem Ashkenazic writer (indeed, any Jewish writer in any time and place) was that of Hayyim ben Bezalel's younger brother, Judah Loew, the leading Ashkenazic theologian of the late sixteenth century. Loew enjoyed an off-and-on association with Prague; indeed, recent scho- larship has stressed the need to understand his teachings within the multifaceted Prague environment.83 What is also to be noted, though, is that Loew expressed his ideas mainly in works of midrashic and aggadic exegesis. Loew's supercom- mentary Gur 'aryeh is, accordingly, replete with explications of midrashim adduced by Rashi. Loew rejected the literal understanding of Rashi's gloss on "this time" as emphatically as any Spanish writer before him: "Heaven forefend that he [Adam] came upon them for purposes of cohabitation." Unlike his older brother, Loew justified this rejection along the lines set forth by Moses ibn Gabbai: "The Holy One, blessed be He, already enjoined him [Adam] against illicit sexual relations in the verse 'And [the Lord God] commanded [the man]' (Genesis 2:16)."84 Like Mizrahi and Luria, Loew imparted Rashi's Talmudic source. Unlike them, he omitted Rashi's gloss on it, and the reason is not difficult to find: It hardly squared with Loew's fervent denial that Adam's relations with animals had been "for purposes of cohabitation." Assuming, as was his way, the profundity of each midrashic word and deci- phering rabbinic discourse using philosophic terminology deployed in a highly idiosyncratic way, Loew offered a reading of R. Eleazar's midrash that nicely 80. S. F. Schneebalg, ed., Be 'er mayyim hayyim, 3 vols. (London, 1964-71), 1:9. Perspicacious- ly-and alone among the supercommentators-Hayyim supported his interpretation by pointing to a passage in which Rashi had actually used the coinage ba' 'alehem ba-mahashavah-a gloss on Genesis 3:20, in which the snake is said to have clandestinely approached Adam and Eve "in thought" as they engaged in intercourse. 81. This interpretation might be said to accord with Luria's profile as an antirationalist who nevertheless "besprinkles his letter to Isserles with philosophic terms" and "claims to be as familiar with 'their science' as Isserles."

Eleazar's midrash in Be 'er ha-golah, a tome written to defend the classical sages against a range of critics, actual and perceived.90 As Mordechai Breuer has shown, there is a strong correlation between the sayings explicated in the latter work and ones condemned in the Christian anti-Talmudic literature of Loew's day (indeed, there is a near-perfect identity between these dicta and the ones con- demned in the aforementioned Errori).91 Loew only alluded to his Christian adversaries obliquely in Be'er ha-golah. By contrast, he openly admitted in Gur 'aryeh that one reason he had "discoursed at length" on Rashi's gloss on "this time" was "in order to explain the words of the [rabbinic] sages since I have noted that the nations are critical of the sages' words." Loew was sure that the critics had failed to fathom the "profundity" of the midrash cited by Rashi. He was equally convinced that one who did so would appreciate that "all gentile scholars are 'less than nothing' [Isaiah 40:17] as compared to their [the sages'] most casual utterances."92 This ringing conclusion, of a piece with claims made by Loew elsewhere, attested to an awareness of the Christian world that Loew shared with his brother Hayyim.93 It was an awareness 85.

Eleazar's midrash invites scrutiny of his indebtedness to Sephardic learning. Certainly, this reading evoked familiar tropes of Spanish rationalism trading, for example, on Maimonides' identification of the male principle with form and the female with matter.95 Yet, at least in the case of Rashi's gloss on "this time," Loew took his Hispanizing approach to midrashic discourse beyond anything seen in his Spanish forerunners. For Rashi and the Spaniards alike, the historical Adam mated with beasts, be it physically (Rashi) or cognitively (the Spaniards). By con- trast, although Loew did not quite deny the historicity of R. Eleazar's midrash, he stressed its symbolic purport and transfigured the allegedly parabolic speech of the one who pronounced it into the most abstract terms: "Form is expressed figura- tively (nimshal) as 'male' and that of which it is the form is expressed figuratively as 'female' while the conjunction between form and that to which it is form is referred to as 'mating."'96 Even one who emphatically urged a nonliteral interpret- ation of Rashi on "this time" could find such allegorizing far-fetched, if not simply beyond the pale. Such a one was Mordechai Jaffe, another giant of the sixteenth-century Ash- kenazic rabbinic scene. A student of Isserles and Luria, Jaffe wrote his Levush 'orah over much of his lifetime.97 Like Loew, Jaffe was fluent in the lexicon of southern Mediterranean rationalism; he naturally integrated bits of it into his interpretation of the midrash on "this time." Yet Loew's idiosyncratic deployment of philosophic terminology apparently rankled him. Accordingly, in keeping with his practice throughout much of his work, Jaffe began his treatment of Rashi's gloss on "this time" with a jibe at Gur 'aryeh:98 Loew had "descended to the depths of pseudo-philosophy ('omek ha-hitpalsefut)," remarked Jaffe, adding tartly, "as is his wont in his commentary."99 As for Loew's labored rereading of the midrash, pitched as it was to uprooting the literal sense, it was all quite "otiose" because "obviously, heaven forefend that the human being fabricated by God's hand and created in the divine image would defile himself (yittamma' azmo) with this, engaging in unnatural cohabitation with any animal or beast in 94. On this awareness, see Haim Hillel Ben Sasson, "Jewish and Christian Sectarians: Existen- tial Similarity and Dialectical Tensions in Sixteenth-Century Moravia and Poland-Lithuania," Viator 4 (1973): 382-84.

He relates his policy of engaging Loew "in duel"--eventually abandoned because of his fear that such effort might leave his supercommentary incomplete upon his death. 99. Jaffe, 'Ozar ha-perushim, 1:14r. 411</page><page sequence="20">Eric Lawee actuality, heaven forefend!" The reason for rejecting the midrash's literal meaning was straightforward: It was disgusting. (Or, as Jaffe put it, it was "on account of the defilement, heaven forefend!") No divine interdict was needed to forestall the fall into depraved bestiality of the man "fabricated by God's hand." Having thrice pronounced anathema on a literal reading of Rashi's gloss and having dismissed Loew's explication of it-perhaps on the grounds that it strayed too far from the literal-Jaffe explained R. Eleazar in a way that at once exposed his rationalist orientation and the novelties that could result when southern Med- iterranean Jewish rationalism merged with northern European religious sensibil- ities. In this rendering of the midrash, echoes of the Sephardic literature that had increasingly come to inform Ashkenazic religious sensibilities are audible as well. None of this is surprising. A leading halakhist associated with Prague as well as Posen (another major center of Ashkenazic learning), Jaffe initiated a "new stage in the assimilation of philosophy" into Ashkenazic rabbinic culture.'00 Although in Jaffe's view, there was no halakhic bar to Adam's intercourse with animals, he held (like Aaron Aboulrabi before him) that sexual relations between Adam and the beasts were impossible because of their inherent degener- acy. Indeed, using a term drawn from the vocabulary of southern European philo- sophical literature, he opined that this was "a first intelligible [implanted] within humankind (muskal rishon she-ba-'adam)." But if bestiality violated a self- evident primary principle of reason, then what could the sages have meant by asserting Adam's multiple engagement in it? (Like Arama and Abarbanel, Jaffe cited R. Eleazar's midrash as an expression of the collective rabbinic voice.) In answering this question, Jaffe showed his indebtedness to the wrinkle in the classic Sephardic interpretation of the midrash added by Isaac Arama, who had fixed on the reference to Adam's da 'at being "unassuaged" by his encounter with the animals. With this linguistic nuance given its due, the midrash's meaning-nay, "contextual sense" (peshuto)-was clear: Adam came "with his knowledge and intellect (be-da'ato uve-sikhlo) to [an understanding of] the nature of every beast and animal." The conclusion to Jaffe's commentary on Rashi's gloss illustrates the complex texture of his thought and writing. Even as Jaffe invoked rationalist ter- minology in rejecting the idea of Adam's literal mating with animals, he entered a further objection to this notion that harked back to a medieval Ashkenazic reading sampled earlier, as well as Miihlhausen's defense of Rashi. On this view, Adam's accomplishment of so many acts of "coitus" in "so brief a time" was "an intelli- gible [muskal] within the category of impossibilities [nimna 'ot]." Here was the language of philosophy put in the service of long-standing Ashkenazic literalist proclivities. Rounding out his interpretation, Jaffe insisted more emphatically than any of his predecessors-medieval or early modern, Sephardic or 100. Lawrence Kaplan, "Rabbi Mordekhai Jaffe and the Evolution of Jewish Culture in Poland in the Sixteenth Century," in Cooperman, Jewish Thought in the Sixteenth Century, 277. Jaffe's intel- lectual profile was complex, displaying, among other things, a "dual allegiance" to philosophy and to Kabbalah; see Davis, "The Cultural and Intellectual History of Ashkenazic Jews," 357. 412</page><page sequence="21">A Case Study in the Rashi Supercommentary Tradition Ashkenazic-on Adam's absolute celibacy in paradise: "There was no intercourse in actuality, neither with beast nor animal nor even Eve, only [intercourse] in his pure and pristine mind."'0' If Jaffe's reading of Rashi reflected a Sephardic turn clearly but tacitly, that of his student, Issachar Baer Eilenburg, betokened a sea change in early modem Ashkenazic allegiances. Unlike his mentor, Eilenburg reproved his Ashkenazic predecessor, Hezekiah ben Manoah, for taking Rashi literally (kifeshuto), whereas "heaven forefend, heaven forefend to say such a thing, that he [Adam] would defile himself in this way, engaging in unnatural cohabitation with any animal or beast in actuality."'102 Eilenburg then endorsed Isaac Caro's interpret- ation: "He came upon the nature of each beast and animal in his thought, mind, and intellect."'03 By the turn of the seventeenth century, the heyday of Ashkenazic rationalism, an Ashkenazic writer could decry the literalist approach to a rabbinic saying that had been assumed reflexively by one of his venerable forebears while avidly embracing the nonliteral Sephardic alternative that had entered the realm of Ashkenazic thought but a century earlier. IV Whereas Mordechai Jaffe was happy to import some of the fruits of philos- ophy to northern Europe, other Ashkenazic rabbis lamented Sephardic rational- ism's infiltration of what they considered the domain of untainted traditional Ashkenazic faith. The relatively tame wrangle over philosophy between Luria and Isserles has been mentioned.104 More convulsive was the controversy of a few years earlier in Prague between Joseph Ashkenazi and Isserles' student, Abraham Horowitz. Ashkenazi shrilly denounced philosophy and the font of rationalist heresy, Maimonides, casting maledictions not only on Maimonides' Guide but even his Mishneh torah.105 Protesting philosophy's depredations in the field of aggadic interpretation, Ashkenazi singled out the "wicked" ben Shaprut for special censure.'06 It was, it will be recalled, this rabbi who had advanced (and perhaps originated) the cognitive interpretation of R. Eleazar's midrash in his Pardes rimmonim.107 To buttress his case for literalism, Ashkenazi 101. 'Ozar ha-perushim, 1:14r. 102. Eilenburg, Zedah la-derekh 'al perush rashi 'al ha-torah, 3 vols.

Had he read the interpret- ations of "this time" offered later in the sixteenth century by Judah Loew and Mordechai Jaffe, Ashkenazi might have added them to the list of the condemned, even as he damned not only Maimonides and Shem Tov but also conservative Sephardic rationalists such as Arama and Abarbanel.108 By contrast, Ashkenazi would have been gratified to learn that the approach to midrash taken by Rashi and the Tosafists lived on in the writings of the most comprehensive Ashkenazic expositor of Talmudic Aggadah ever to put pen to paper, Samuel Edels. 09 Explaining R. Eleazar's midrash on Adam and the animals, Edels, a seventeenth-century Polish scholar, summoned Hezekiah ben Manoah's suggestion that the animals with whom Adam experienced sexual congress must have been pregnant because otherwise, they would have been rendered sterile by the human-animal coital bond. This idea left Edels dissatisfied, not because such carnal relations were repugnant but on more classically Ashkenazic grounds: It con- tradicted the Talmudic affirmation of the unwillingness of pregnant beasts to engage in sexual intercourse. Edels delivered Hezekiah from this challenge by positing that the prelapsarian female animals were like Eve who-again, yet another midrashic telling-experienced no gestation period before giving birth to offspring. Having borne the next generation of their species immediately upon conception, the females beasts were again available to receive Adam's sexual advances."I1 Edels was not alone among seventeenth-century Ashkenazic exegetes in his obliviousness to Hispanizing trends in recent Ashkenazic approaches to midrash. There was also Jacob ben Benjamin Aaron Slonik, son of another leading student of Isserles and Luria and the author of a supercommentary on Rashi titled Nahalat ya 'akov. Though he was aware of the many new works on Rashi's Commentary that had recently been forthcoming from Ashkenazic lands, Slonik resolved not to read them. His only point of reference in terms of earlier Rashi supercommen- tary was the work of Elijah Mizrahi."' In the case of Rashi's gloss on Genesis 2:23, because Mizrahi had assumed its literal purport,12 Slonik had no reason to rethink his own instinctive literalist approach.'"13 Perhaps it was just as well. 108.

Some were alarmed, the most famous among them being the seventeenth- century Polish Talmudist and Rashi supercommentator David ben Samuel Halevi ("Taz"). In mounting a rearguard action against the increasingly dominant Hispanized approach to Rashi's gloss on "this time," David thought it easy to clinch his case: He cited Rashi's gloss on R. Eleazar's midrash in his Talmud com- mentary. Mizrahi and Slonik had done the same before him to supply a helpful reference to their readers. David's invocation, by contrast, aimed to overturn an approach to classical midrash that he deemed pernicious. For their parts, the likely targets of David's ire, Loew and Jaffe, had studiedly excluded the Talmudic gloss from their considerations of Rashi on Genesis 2:23. Though he followed the interpretive path of his medieval Ashkenazic prede- cessors, David was no mere throwback to a bygone era. He was aware of and sought to meet objections to the literal approach to R. Eleazar's midrash, such as Jaffe's claim that Adam would surely have been repulsed by sexual liaisons with beasts and Loew's opinion that bestiality was proscribed by the time of Adam's encounter with the subhuman creatures. Without mentioning either writer by name, David addressed both points. Like Jaffe, he had no truck with the argument that Adam already bore a divine proscription on bestiality at this early stage. As for the claim of this activity's intrinsic depravity, David proposed a vision of the primeval human condition in which sexual congress between man and beast would have been wholly congenial because all creatures were as yet equally "pleasant" and uncor- rupted by sin, all having been created through "the utterance of the Holy One, Blessed be He.""114 David may have been drawing on ideas espoused by others in his day regarding the spiritual as opposed to the material body that Adam presum- ably possessed prior to his fall."5 He may also have envisioned changes in the divine law that some in his day, such as the Prague-born Ashkenazic scholar Isaiah Horowitz, posited for messianic times. According to this view, the end time would see the material Torah revert to its original pristine spiritual form."116 Though he agreed with Jaffe that no prohibition constrained sexual relations with animals prior to Eve's creation, David ben Samuel arrived at an overall finding that was as far removed as possible from Jaffe's view with regard to Adam's relationship to the material world prior to his sin. Whereas Jaffe insisted there was "no intercourse in actuality" on Adam's part, "neither with beast nor animal nor even Eve," David affirmed Adam's extensive sexual activity in para- dise with the beasts and with Eve alike while freeing prelapsarian sexuality 114.

Eleazar's midrash was sure to receive wide broadcast.120 Then, too, Rashi's Commentary had become a staple of many Jewish curricula from the ear- liest ages through advanced levels. It had even been given halakhic status. In his fourteenth-century code, Jacob ben Asher authorized Rashi's Commentary as a substitute for "targum" in meeting the requirement to review the weekly Torah reading twice in Hebrew and once in interpretive paraphrase. This ruling was ratified in the sixteenth century in Shulhan 'Arukh, the early modem code that eventually achieved canonical status in all corners of traditional Judaism.'21 Unlike so many obscure Talmudic statements, the midrash on Adam and the animals circulated in the "public square." The question was, who would shape its meaning? Though in large measure, the answer to this question would hinge 117.

That some found a solution to Rashi's problematic gloss on "this time" in the invention of a version shorn of any reference to Adam's sexual encounter with animals is attested by Judah Loew's student Joseph ben Issachar of Prague. Unusually, the main aim of his Rashi supercommentary was not explica- tion of Rashi but the recovery of correct versions of his words.122 Though born partly of long-standing Jewish textual sensibilities, Joseph's work was abetted by lower critical impulses applied to the Talmudic text in the school of Loew and Luria. New text-critical techniques recently arrived in northern Europe from Renaissance Italy, which were sharpened, in turn, by the expectations of standar- dized texts created by the age of printing, may also have played a role. In terms of traditional Jewish sensibilities, Joseph reprised the trope of the "decline of the generations" as it appeared in earlier Jewish literature and applied it to publish- ers.123 As they were no more immune to this rule of human devolution than others, their products-literary artifacts-were necessarily subject to great falli- bility. Joseph, who had seen evidence of this with his own eyes in recent editions of the classics of Jewish biblical exegesis, set about the task of recovering Rashi's original words.'24 His main tool was a comparison of printed copies of the Commentary with a manuscript "three hundred years old or more" that he had seen in Lublin. 122. Though "lower criticism" occurs in other supercommentaries, it is dominant in Joseph's work. In light of the increasingly current awareness of fluidity in the text of the Commentary over the ages, Joseph's enterprise takes on added interest, especially as his text criticism played a significant role in establishing later versions of Rashi's text.

Yosefda 'at (Prague, 1609), 2v. 417</page><page sequence="26">Eric Lawee In the case of Genesis 2:23, Joseph discovered that some versions of the Commentary omitted Adam's sexual relations with animals, leaving Rashi to speak only of Adam's satisfaction with Eve.125 Testifying decisively against this sanitized version, however, was the hoary Lublin manuscript and the version of the midrash treated by Joseph's "master," Judah Loew. Indeed, as has been seen, Loew actually lavished much attention on that part of R. Eleazar's midrash that spoke of Adam's relations with animals.126 Accordingly, Joseph asserted the authenticity of this first part of Rashi's comment and tried to restore it. His efforts were, however, not wholly successful, and the truncated, morally unproblematic version of Rashi's gloss on "this time" that Joseph rejected occasionally appears in versions of Rashi's Commentary to this day.127 With Rashi's full gloss preserved in most printings, its fate would turn largely on the dissemination of competing readings of R. Eleazar's midrash abroad. Enter Shabbetai ben Joseph Bass, a Polish scholar who found his way to Prague following the Cossack attacks. Having landed in this city of refuge, Bass recalled his promise to "publish a humash with abbreviated commentaries," should the divine hand choose to spare him. The result, produced in 1680, was Siftei hakhamim, an anthology of Rashi supercommentaries that brought together diverse strands of the burgeoning genre.128 Pride of place in the compendium was accorded to the much-admired Mizrahi. Naturally, pillars of Ashkenazic culture, such as Luria and Loew, were not neglected. More recent writers such as Jacob Slonik also won a hearing, bringing this little- known writer's insights to a wider audience.129 Other recent Ashkenazic super- commentaries were also featured, including the one then recently published by David ben Samuel. Bass showed an impressive acquaintance with Sephardic supercommentaries as well, including the one by Aboulrabi.130 In explicating Rashi on Genesis 2:23, Bass cited the literalists, Mizrahi and Slonik, with respect to some technical points, but for his main substantive elaboration, he reprised the Sephardic reading of Rashi that had become com- monplace in the Ashkenazic supercommentaries on Rashi written in the century prior. In the manner of several Sephardic predecessors, he related this reading to 125. Joseph did not note the irony that this latter component was the only part of R. Eleazar's dictum that Rashi had excised when rendering this sage's midrash (see n. 10 herein). Just when this textual variant entered is hard to say. It does not appear (nor do others of significance) in early printed editions such as the Rome edition of 1470 or the Guadalajara edition of 1476 (see n. 120). As it survived, the 1475 Reggio di Calabria edition lacks Rashi's commentary on the beginning of Genesis, including the gloss on Genesis 2:23. 126. Yosefda 'at, 8v. 127.

One might, therefore, see his selection of the nonliteral reading of Rashi's gloss on "this time"-and his crucial omission of David ben Samuel's literalist interpretation-as the moment when the choice between the classical Ashkenazic and Sephardic interpretations of Rashi's gloss on "this time" was finally settled in favor of the Spanish tradition. At any rate, Bass did much to enshrine this reading as the one that students of Rashi would see. The influence of Siftei hakhamim waxed further with its inclusion in what remains a widely diffused anthology of Rashi supercommentary published in Warsaw in 1862. The work was not unprecedented in binding multiple commen- taries on Rashi between one set of covers; yet this volume, bearing the misleading title 'Ozar ha-perushim 'al ha-torah, has, by the estimate of the most prolific contemporary publisher of Rashi supercommentaries, appeared in facsimile repro- duction over a hundred times in the last century and a half. By contrast, its sixteenth-century predecessor probably exists in less than a dozen copies today and has never been reprinted.132 The volume included Mizrahi and, not surpris- ingly for a volume produced in the eastern European heartland, Judah Loew, Mordechai Jaffe, and Shabbetai Bass. Although, in the case of Rashi's gloss on Genesis 2:23, this format might seem to be a recipe for exegetical pluralism, it proves otherwise. True, Mizrahi had held to a literalist approach to Rashi's gloss, but for some reason, his comment on this gloss was airbrushed out of the Warsaw edition.133 What remains are Loew's and Jaffe's vociferous disavowals of the literal reading alongside Shabbetai Bass's reiteration of the Spanish approach. VI For nine centuries, Rashi's Commentary has guided Jews of all ages and levels of learning as they have pondered the Torah and sought to fathom its meaning. To summon Avivah Zornberg's vivid image, Rashi's work was "absorbed into the bloodstream of Jewish culture."'34 Over the period of the Commentary's rise to preeminence and down to the present, leading scholars have invested vast amounts of intellectual energy in efforts to discern Rashi's sources, reconcile his apparent inconsistencies, explain his exegetical reasoning, justify his exclusions, and so forth. They have also used Rashi's glosses as a 131. 'Ozar ha-perushim, 14r: "He [Adam] would grasp the nature of every beast and animal with his intellect; if he had not known their nature, then he would have not have known how to confer [proper] names on them [reflecting their essence]." 132.

These writers' efforts, which transcend temporal, geographic, and cultural boundaries, have gen- erated an ongoing dialogue about Rashi's work that has been nourished as scholars have brought interpretations of Rashi from one Jewish center of learning to another and by the composition of seminal works such as Mizrahi's commentary, which have, in turn, yielded abridgements and commentaries (super- supercommentaries).135 To a significant degree, it was Rashi's midrashic interpretations-the dominant element in his Commentary-that won later scholarly attention, though, to be sure, some supercommentators (such as Aboulrabi) took a special interest in Rashi's peshat-oriented grammatical comments. Indeed, Rashi's Commentary commanded attention in large part because of its heavy reliance on the vast reservoir of classical rabbinic interpretation that explicated and expounded on the divine word. Responses to the Commentary largely amounted, therefore, to a judgment on this rich and ostensibly authoritative but at times trou- bling classical legacy. Rescued by Rashi from the "sea of Talmud," many rabbinic dictums appeared in the Commentary, where they became the "standard" (or, at the very least, highly familiar) explanations of one or another biblical verse. In the case of Rashi's gloss on "this time," a more specific development can be traced. Upon arrival in Spain, it was imbued with noetic meaning. The gloss then returned north and further east with its new meaning in hand, infusing the Ashkenazic supercommentary literature. As has been seen, the widespread accep- tance of-nay, insistence on-the Sephardic interpretation of the gloss by Ashke- nazic writers can only be understood in terms of a broad cultural realignment in northern and eastern European Jewish thought and literature. Similarly, David ben Samuel's insistence on a "medieval Ashkenazic" reading of Rashi's gloss reflected views and voices that resisted this cultural transformation. "The exploration of connections between various diaspora Jewish centers in the Middle Ages" is, opines Abraham Grossman, among the most complex pro- blems arising from the study of Jewish history.'36 Little wonder that investigations of the passage of ideas and practices among diverse medieval Jewish centers has engendered robust and even vituperative scholarly debate.'37 No less complex, 135. An example is the Bulgarian "Dosa the Greek," who traveled in Italy and Austria. In his Rashi supercommentary, Dosa cites Romaniot, Italian, Sephardic, and Ashkenazic sources; see Ad. Neubauer, "Commentar zu Raschi's Pentateuch-Commentar von Dossa aus Widden," Israelietische Letterbode 8 (1882): 37-55. In one case, after moving to Italy, he found an answer to a question on Rashi that had arisen among his Ashkenazic colleagues.

After all, this period saw the rise of increasingly heterogeneous Jewish communities and increased permeability among different Jewish cultural zones, all unfolding within a number of intricately intertwined "external contexts" (e.g., the Renais- sance, Counter-Reformation, Copernican revolution).138 Especially pertinent to early modem Jewish literature, then, are "questions concerning the meaning of the arrival of a corpus of writings in a new cultural environment." 39 This essay has highlighted the exegetical supercommentary as a literary form (or "mode of transmission") that brings just such questions into sharp relief.140 Without ques- tion, pride of place within this genre goes to works of Rashi supercommentary. As literature that, in aggregate, traverses the maps of diverse Jewish communities, these works reveal subtleties of religious-cultural interchange among diverse streams of Jewish tradition in the Middle Ages, early modem period, and beyond.141 Eric Lawee York University Toronto, Canada 138.

The following aerial survey, by no means comprehensive, traces developments since the early modem period, high- lighting the burgeoning literature on Rashi oriented toward English-speaking audiences. The dominant view of early modem Ashkenazic writers-that Adam's relations with animals were cognitive, not sexual-was reprised by the giant of eighteenth-century Ashkenazic rabbinic learning, Elijah ben Solomon of Vilna. In the manner of Miihlhausen (though somewhat less deftly, and without relating to Rashi), he argued that Adam engaged in physical exertions to find a mate. As for the midrashic exposition on Adam and the animals, it reflected the fact that Adam "investigated and saw in his intellect that from all of the [subhuman] species his mate was not to be found."142 Though hardly known for warm receptivity to phi- losophic rationalism, Elijah was happy to turn to R. Eleazar's assertion of Adam's congress with animals into an intellectual affair. 143 Turning R. Eleazar's midrash to a more pietistic purpose was Hanokh Zundel ben Joseph, a nineteenth-century Polish scholar who devoted considerable energy to the interpretation of nonlegal rabbinic sayings. Pronouncing the plain sense of R. Eleazar's midrash "wonderous"-for how was it possible that "Adam had intercourse with every animal, beast, and bird when anybody who lies carnally with an animal is subject to capital punishment?"-Hanokh argued that R. Eleazar's intent must be understood in light of the great distinction between the ends of human and subhuman coupling. Adam's intercourse with the animals "in his mind" revealed to him that the latter aimed at the perpetuation of the species alone. This finding left Adam dissatisfied ("not assuaged") until he intuited that human sexual union had the far more exalted goal of nothing less than bringing about a manifestation of the divine indwelling (shekhinah). Seeing that his mating with Eve achieved this end, Adam was, taught R. Eleazar, finally "assuaged."l44 At the beginning of the twentieth century, Barukh Halevi Epstein, son of the great halakhist Yehiel Michal Epstein and nephew and student of the famous Naphtali Zevi Judah Berlin, reprised the view that Adam did not mate with animals but simply sought a mate among them. To show that it was "impossible" 142. 'Aderet 'eliyahu (Halberstadt, 1859), 8v. Elijah assimilated R.

Eleazar kifeshuto, he adduced the midrash cited by Hezekiah ben Manoah, according to which human-animal intermating induced sterility in its animal participant. Though Hezekiah had reconciled the two rabbinic statements in a manner that preserved the actuality of Adam's sexual union with animals, Epstein took the fact that the beasts and animals created by divine fiat had borne offspring as proof that they had not experienced any physical relations with the first human being.145 Epstein's day saw the publication of Pentateuch with Targum Onkelos, Haphtaroth and Rashi ' Commentary by the English rabbi Morris Rosenbaum and the Hungarian-born lexicographer Abraham Moritz Silbermann. Though this work of the 1930s "did much to familiarize English-speaking Jews" with Rashi's "classic" of biblical interpretation, it went out of its way to avoid familiarizing English readers of the precise meaning of Rashi's gloss on "this time."146 While accurately reproducing the gloss in the original Hebrew, Rosenbaum-Silbermann offered this by way of translation: "This teaches that Adam endeavored to find a companion among all cattle and beasts, but found no satisfaction except in Eve" (emphasis added).147 Here is but one instance in which avoidance, not to say censorship, of some of Rashi's more frankly sexual glosses manifested itself on the English side of the page.'48 What of Rashi's gloss on "this time" in works of English-language Judaica put out by a group of rabbis under the "Artscroll" imprint who rest confident in their continuity with the "Torah-true" Judaism of the Ashkenazic past?149 In an early commentary on Genesis put out under the Mesorah Publications Artscroll label, Adam's cry "this time" was said to reflect his earlier unsuccessful attempt to find "a mate from among every creature," whereas a less than luminous note explained, "Rashi; as explained by Lekach Tov; Toledos Yitzchak and Vilna Gaon."'15so Clearly, the editors of this volume felt compelled to cite Rashi 145.

For example, on Genesis 3:1, where Rashi tells of the snake coveting Eve upon seeing the primordial couple naked and "engaged in coitus" ('osekim be-tashmish), the English reads, "He [the snake] saw them naked and unashamed and coveted her" (Pentateuch with Targum Onkelos, 1:12). Other examples occur at Genesis 25:26 (Pentateuch with Targum Onkelos, 1:115) and Genesis 32:14, in which all details of Rashi's disquisition on the proper frequency of "the marital duty imposed by the Torah" are found in the Hebrew text and omitted in English (Pentateuch with Targum Onkelos, 157). 149.

An elaborative footnote reports Rashi's comment on the relevant Talmudic passage and summons the two main approaches to Rashi's gloss found in the early modem Ashkenazic supercommentaries. Noted first is David ben Samuel's view that Adam could have had actual sexual relations with animals because the prohibition on bestiality did not "come into effect until after the creation of Eve." (Not stressed is David's view that Adam most certainly did enjoy such relations.) The last word, however, is given to "Gur 'aryeh, Maharsha [i.e., Samuel Edels], and others" who "strongly reject this position and take the matter of Adam having relations with animals in a figurative sense."153 Though the note is not accurate in every detail (as has been seen, Edels basically interpreted R. Eleazar's midrash literally, though he was open to Yom Tov Lipmann Miihlhausen's alternative),'54 it offers a reasonable balance between both sides of the Ashkenazic debate over the meaning of Rashi's gloss on "this time." Herczeg's Commentary attests to a trend found in other recent editions of Rashi's work produced for English audiences: that the determination of the meaning of Rashi's gloss on "this time" has increasingly been influenced by Judah Loew of Prague. Some cite Loew simply to justify the claim that the gloss on Genesis 2:23 "must be understood figuratively.""'55 Others, such as Pinchas Doron in his supercommentarial The Mystery of Creation According to Rashi, name Loew first in a list of commentators who maintain that "Adam did not have actual intercourse with beasts" and then deviate from Loew's actual interpretation by giving the explanation that Rashi's gloss teaches that Adam "pondered the nature of each animal and beast to see if he could find a mate 151. On the avoidance of sexual language in the Artscroll volumes, see Levy, "Our Torah," 153. Two of the sources cited in support of the understanding of Rashi given were poorly chosen. Neither Lekah tov nor the Vilna Gaon "explained" Rashi at all in their commentaries, though they did relate to R. Eleazar's exposition regarding Adam's encounter with the primordial animals-albeit in the case of Tobiah ben Eliezer, the twelfth-century Byzantine author of Lekah tov (Vilna, 1884), 23 (Roman pagination), only somewhat obliquely. As seen previously, the Sephardic Isaac Caro (whose work Artscroll cites in the Ashkenazic form Toledos Yitzchak (for the "innovative way of spelling Hebrew words in Artscroll books," see Levy, "Contemporary Jewish Booklore") does offer a firm foundation on which to rest the explanation of Rashi supplied. 152. Levy, in "Contemporary Jewish Booklore," pronounces this "the best exposition of Rashi available in English." 153.

For example, in the Ariel-United Israel Institutes' Ariel Chumash, edited by Emanuel Feldman, a note appears in miniscule font, indicating that "Taz [David ben Samuel] states that Rashi's words are to be understood literally," and an eye-catching "Focus" section appears in a larger font, offering an updated para- phrase of Loew (describing his reading as a "mystical" one).'57 The paraphrase concludes with the observation that it was only with Eve's creation that Adam experienced "any sense of completion." In sum, building on Loew, whose reading of Rashi's gloss on "this time" was perhaps most removed from this gloss's plain sense, this English-language offering relays a reading of Rashi's gloss on "this time" that modulates its contents into ideas that might appear reasonable-indeed, profound-to an early-twenty-first-century English reader of Rashi-a reading that owes much to the Hispanized interpretation of Rashi that was widely adopted in early modem Ashkenaz, even as it stands far removed from the plain meaning of R. Eleazar's claim that "Adam mated with every beast and animal." 156. Pinchas Doron, The Mystery of Creation According to Rashi: A New Translation and Interpretation of Rashi on Genesis I-VI (Jerusalem: Moznaim, 1982), 63. This author notes, with great surprise but without casting aspersions, that "the 'Taz' in his commentary on Rashi Divrei David understands the statement in the Talmud and Rashi literally!" (64). 157.

With regard to the designation of Loew's reading as "mystical," note Gershom Scholem's observation in Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (New York: Schocken, 1941), 339, that Loew "appears to have renounced Kabbalistic vocabulary only in order to give the widest possible range of influence to Kabbalistic doctrine." For all that, no "kabbalistic doctrine," explicit or otherwise, appears in Loew's gloss on Rashi's interpretation of Genesis 2:23. 425</page></plain_text>
