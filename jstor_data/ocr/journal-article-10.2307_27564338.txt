Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2006. xxiv, 624 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001074 In October 1570, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Cosimo I, issued an edict expelling all Jews, be they bankers, merchants, or peddlers, from their homes in the villages and towns of the Florentine domain. The same edict allowed those who so decided to remain, under the condition that they relocate to the capital city. A segregated Jewish quarter?a ghetto?was set apart and built not far from the old market in the center of Florence, the third such urban enclosure to be created in a sixteenth-century Italian state. While the history of the ghettos of Venice (1516) and Rome (1555) has been explored widely by scholars of Italian Jewry, Stefanie B. Siegmund's The Medici State and the Ghetto of Flor ence: The Construction of an Early Modern Jewish Community, a long and ambi tious monograph, provides the first full-length study of the ghettoization of Tuscan Jews. In contrast to the classic work by Umberto Cassuto, Gli ebrei a Firenze nell'et? del Ri?as cimento (1918), who considered Jewish life in the ghetto of Flor ence "obscure and miserable," Siegmund sees the ghettoization process as an opportunity for exploring the politics and effects of population transfer, as related to a religious minority in early modern Italy. The work, based on an impressive array of previously untapped archival sources, attempts to do many things at once: It engages with the origins of ghet toization within the context of state building in the early modern period; it ana lyzes the actual construction of the enclosure; and it explores its repercussions for the development of the Florentine Jewish community. Accordingly, the book is divided into three sections, which explore how Jews fit into the Tuscan world before ghettoization and the changes caused by their spatial relocation and reor ganization. The first section, "The Segregation of the Jews and the Spatialization of Power," considers the origins and the policy of ghettoization from the perspec tive of the rulers and administrators of the Medici state. The second section, "The Construction of the Ghetto," explores the ghetto itself. It provides an interpretation of its actual building and a study of the people who decided to settle in it, consider ing its physical and fiscal dimensions. Finally, the third part, "A New Tuscan Commune and Religious Community," looks at the inner structure of the ghetto community. It explores the phenomenon of the r?int?gration of the new (and old) Florentine Jews into the Tuscan state through the institutionalization of the 185</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews segregated community as a self-governing entity, complete with its own elite, depen dent on the favor and support of the central authorities. Siegmund also discusses the consolidation of a new economy and class structure within the ghetto, the impact of ghettoization on marital and dotal patterns and strategies, and the development of new social and religious institutions, unknown to Tuscan Jews before 1570. The stated goal of the monograph is twofold: first, to tell a story about state craft and the political instrumentalization of religion to advance goals of state building and the legitimization of state power in early modern Italy (within the fra mework of "confessionalization" historiography); and second, to explore the way in which states become involved in constructing or reshaping how the "otherness" of people who lived as minorities in their midst was socially expressed. Siegmund asks "why policymakers in Tuscany might have believed... that the Jews were so far out of place that locating them in a new place might be considered a move that could enhance the honor and power of the Medici regime" (95). The work takes up an "intentionalist" perspective on the construction of the ghetto of Florence. It suggests that the Medici administration deliberately operated with a plan to restructure the Tuscan Jewish community into an administratively docile, orderly group and to create clear boundaries between Jews and Christians, who until that moment had lived quite harmoniously together. The evidence to explain the actual rationale behind the Medici's decision to ghettoize the Jews, however, is scant. Most of the initial two chapters rely on the creative interpret ation of a single document?the edict of October 1570?which may be suggestive but lacks the support of solid external sources. It also remains unclear how, pre cisely, the Medici contributed "to the transformation of the ghetto into a standard urban feature of the early modern map and an enduring administrative unit of the early modern Italian city" (413). The real strength of this monograph lies elsewhere, in the examination of the (sometimes unexpected) outcomes of ghettoization. Here, the work comes alive. As Jews and Christians mingled quite freely in Tuscany prior to 1570, ghettoiza tion "catalyzed changes that led [a] set of individual Jews to live lives that were increasingly organized by interactions with other Jews in an array of physically and socially delimited spaces and institutions" for the first time (135). Through a careful analysis of normative, administrative, and demographic documents (the vast body of unpublished archival sources that Siegmund studied and inter preted is an important and admirable feat in itself), the author looks at the pro cesses of creating an organized Jewish community with its typical institutions (i.e., a lay government, an appointed communal rabbi, pious societies, schools) where none existed previously, in conjunction with the making of an early modern state. In contrast to Robert Bonfil's classic work Rabbis and Jewish Com munities in Renaissance Italy (1994), Siegmund argues that prior to ghettoization, Tuscan Jews lived "Jewishly" even without the assistance of rabbinically led, organized, and localized communities, whereas after ghettoization, they structured themselves following fundamentally secular, non-halakhic lines. A Jewish elite consisting of a "middle class" of mercantile families, in contrast to the old banking elite that left Florence after 1570, emerged as a result of the consolidation of the remaining Tuscan Jews into one urban enclosure. A new Jewish 186</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews bureaucracy appeared, embedded in the machinery of the Tuscan state and depen dent on the favor of the central authorities. Siegmund also dwells on how ghettoi zation affected Jewish women, concluding that it eroded their autonomy and authority in the family, the religious sphere, and the marketplace. A lengthy work such as this cannot fail to raise doubts and questions, and we should ascribe this to its merit. Siegmund does not compare the case of the relo calization of the Tuscan Jews to contemporaneous efforts at ghettoizing other communities. The circumstances of the creation of the Florentine ghetto are pre sented as unique, and yet emblematic of larger early modern Italian phenomena: In fact, the extent to which the book's conclusions may be generalized remains to be assessed. One may also wonder about the influence of political and admin istrative models from other, already established Jewish communities: Were the Jews of Florence unaware of contemporary examples of semiautonomous Jewish government? Finally, we may ask whether the process of community build ing and institutionalization that the book attributes to forced ghettoization should not rather be seen as a physiological result of urban consolidation, quite detached from the establishment of ghettos in Italy. As Siegmund readily admits, similar processes of community formation took place at different times in other Italian cities, without an obvious causal connection with the presence of a ghetto. This warrants a distinction between those changes that occurred because of the trau matic displacement of people from villages to the city and those that occurred because of the consolidation of the community. We should perhaps ask how the Florentine case compares to Pisa and Livorno, the two Tuscan communities without ghettos. Despite its autonomous nature, for instance, the governmental agencies of the Jewish community of Livorno were also dependent on local and central offices of the Tuscan administration. Finally, the book would have gained in clarity and persuasive force through a tighter editing effort than it received: The introduction and initial chapters, in particular, are encumbered by needless repetitions and suffer from a lack of cogency. It is a pity that Stanford University Press did not accomplish such a basic task. Other minor editing shortcomings include the erratic use of italics and inverted commas in quotations from the Italian, as well as some mistakes (p. 22, complimentary, but complementary, agenda; p. 34, cura animas, but cura animarum; p. 118, provincia, translated as "provenance," but "province"; p. 119: d'ella, but della; and p. 201, Straccaiuoli, but Stracciaiuoli). That said, readers who make their way through its pages will find suggestive, albeit at times too abstract, speculations, compelling interpretations of demographic and economic data, and significant correctives regarding the formation of an early modern Jewish community, which will surely trigger scholarly debate and further research.
