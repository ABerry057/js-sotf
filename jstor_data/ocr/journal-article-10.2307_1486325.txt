New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1980. xxii, 171 pp. This handsome edition of the poems of Yitzhak Ibn Ezra, edited and annotated with a valuable commentary by Professor Menahem Schmelzer, is a worthy addition to the growing number of critical texts of medieval Hebrew poetry that have appeared in recent years, a distinguished group that includes such volumes as Dan Pagis's Shirei Levi Ibn Al-Taban, Aharon Mirsky's Yossi ben Yossi, Yisrael Levin's edition of the shirat hakodesh of Abraham Ibn Ezra, and Ezra Fleischer's several collections of early piyyut. This edition of Yitzhak's poetry is especially important because it consti- tutes the first publication for nearly all the poems in it. Thanks to this volume, scholars will now be enabled to evaluate the career of a not very well known Golden Age Spanish-Jewish poet who was perhaps more repre- sentative of his culture than some of his more gifted and better celebrated contemporaries. The reputation of Yitzhak ben Avraham Ibn Ezra has suffered an obscure fate, particularly in comparison with that of his illustrious father.' About Yitzhak's life little is known except that he appears to have accom- 1.

After the latter's death in Egypt in 1141, Yitzhak journeyed to Damascus and later to Baghdad, where he came under the influence of the Jewish physician and philosopher Netanel ben Eli (better known, after his conversion to Islam, as Abu al-Barakat HIibat Allah). According to the testimony of Al-Harizi in the Takhkemoni (sha'ar 3), Yitzhak followed his teacher and himself subsequently converted. This last fact, however, has never been independently verified.2 Yitzhak's poetry has also languished in obscurity. Although the late Naftali ben-Menahem published in 1950 an edition of Yitzhak's known work, much of it of questionable attribution, most of Yitzhak's diwan was known only by report because it was all contained in a single manuscript whose owner, a wealthy Syrian Jewish merchant by the name of Ezra Solomon Silvera, refused to permit scholars to study it. As early as the beginning of this century, Hayyim (Heinrich) Brody attempted to buy the manuscript,3 but Silvera was willing to sell it only at an exorbitant price, and not until 1968 was the manuscript finally acquired by the Library of the Jewish Theological Seminary, where Professor Schmelzer is chief librarian. The seminary has now generously supported the publication of this valuable manuscript through this edition. For all its undoubted importance, the Silvera manuscript raises a number of questions concerning its dating, authorship, and relationship to Yitzhak's complete diwan. The manuscript is written in a twelfth-century Sephardi rabbinic hand, and two inscriptions at its beginning-a preface to a lengthy letter in rhymed prose and four praise-poems dedicated to a certain Rab Avraham, the head of the yeshiva in Damascus-state that at least some of the poems in the manuscript were copied in a town near Damascus in Marheshvan 1454 (October-November 1142). Another poem, however, no. 36, a praise-poem in honor of Abu al-Barakat, states that it was composed in Baghdad in May 1143-that is, nearly a year after Yitzhak had left Damascus. To resolve this apparent contradiction, Profes- sor Schmelzer suggests that the manuscript as it now exists actually consists 2. On this poem and its biographical value, see the brief remarks of Hayyim Schirmann, published as note 29 in A. M. Haberman, "Regarding the Fate of the Diwan of Yitzhak Ibn Ezra" (Hebrew), Sinai, vol. 14, pp. 245-246. 3.

Professor Schmelzer proposes other possible explanations for the state of the manuscript,4 but his observation that the present text is composed of separate fascicles joined together at different periods is borne out by the organization of the poems. Following the initial rhymed-prose letter and the praise-poems to Rab Avraham, the manuscript contains a section of twenty-one poems that are mainly encomia in honor of the dignitaries of the Egyptian Jewish community (some of whom are also the subjects of praise- poems Yehuda Halevi composed in the same period); a group of poems on diverse subjects, including several in praise of Babylonian Jewish leaders; a small collection of poems by other Spanish-Hebrew poets (among them Halevi, Abraham Ibn Ezra, and Yitzhak Ibn Giat); finally, an additional group of poems by Yitzhak dating from the period of his sojourn in Babylonia. The reason for the presence in the manuscript of the group of poems by Yitzhak's contemporaries remains something of a mystery, and Professor Schmelzer has wisely relegated the poems to an appendix (printing in full text only those never before published). In another appendix, he has pub- lished a letter from Ezra Silvera to Hayyim Brody describing the manuscript and its contents, while a third appendix contains twelve poems that have traditionally been attributed to Yitzhak but are not in the Silvera manu- script. These poems include Yerivuni 'alei 'ozvi brit, until now probably the best-known poem attributed to Yitzhak, in which he supposedly repented and begged forgiveness for his conversion. The case of Yerivuni is instructive because it suggests how the publication of the Silvera manuscript will now change our views about Yitzhak as a poet. This is not the only poem traditionally attributed to Yitzhak which may now have to be excluded from the diwan; to some readers, an even greater disappointment may be the poem beginning Bekhi tis'u, also not 4.

There are no poems in it from the period before Yitzhak left Spain, and while all the poems in the manuscript are shirei hbol, it is hard to believe that Yitzhak did not compose some liturgical poetry. Moreover, although Yitzhak has typically been known as a poet who excelled in the composition of girdle- poems,6 all the poems in the Silvera manuscript, with the exception of the rhymed-prose letter, are in classical meters with a single rhyme-scheme. The vast majority of these are praise-poems or poems of friendship addressed to the ubiquitous Tsvi-a fact that may serve to remind the reader of the actual situation in which poets like Yitzhak usually wrote, always having to curry favor from one patron or another. While the Golden Age's greatest poets, like Halevi or Moshe Ibn Ezra, were able to transcend the so-called pecuniary side of poetic existence through the sheer power of literary genius, one suspects that the more common, perhaps inevitable consequences of the patronage system are more accurately reflected in the quality of Yitzhak's poetry, which is thoroughly professional, highly literate, and almost completely uninspired. It is revealing that the best poems in this collection have the least to do with "patronizing"; I have in mind in parti- cular the lyrical laments and meditations on time, fortune, and the poet's loneliness. All in all, Yitzhak emerges from this collection as a gifted epigone (especially as a disciple of Halevi), and as a significant example of a second-rank talent of the period. This last fact, however, makes Professor Schmelzer's edition all the more valuable if only because such poets as Yitzhak are usually ignored by modern scholars in favor of the "greats," even though they have their own interest. In the preface to this edition, Professor Schmelzer notes in passing that when the Silvera manuscript first came to his attention he was in the process of collecting the piyyutim of Yitzhak Ibn Giat. We can now eagerly await the appearance of that edition in a volume as handsome as this one. David Stern University of Judaism Los Angeles, Calif. 5. A good text and translation of this poem is found in T. Carmi's The Penguin Book of Hebrew Verse (New York: Penguin &amp; Viking, 1981), p. 356. It is significant that this is the single poem by Yitzhak that Carmi publishes. 6. Cf. H. Schirmann, Hebrew Poetry in Spain and Provence (Hebrew), 2d ed.
