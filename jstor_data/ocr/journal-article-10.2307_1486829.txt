<plain_text><page sequence="1">Willem Cornelis van Unnik. Das Selbstverstdndnis der jiidischen Diaspora in der hellenistisch-rdimischen Zeit. Arbeiten zur Geschichte des antiken Judentums und des Urchristenturns. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1993. 200 pp. The five chapters of this posthumous work by W. C. van Unnik were lectures given during the first ten days of April 1967 at the Swedish Theolog- ical Institute in Jerusalem. The editor, P. W. van der Horst, who obtained his teacher's unpublished manuscript in 1991, has published it without omissions or additions; only the introduction, which gives an account of Van Unnik's life and writings, the footnotes, appendices, and indices are from the editor's pen, in addition to very minor alterations and some additional footnotes. Van Unnik begins by citing the well-known Hebrew phrase traditionally recited at the Passover seder, la-shanah ha-ba'ah bi-yrushalayinm, "next year in Jerusalem." The author fully identifies with this wish and avows himself privileged to have it at long last fulfilled. Quoting the pilgrim Psalm 122, he touchingly notes how especially attractive it was for him, as a pilgrim from the galut, to be in Jerusalem at Easter time to deliver these lectures on the problem of the Diaspora in the Hellenistic-Roman world. From the introduction we learn of his deep love for the Jewish people, which was partially due to his early contact with the Orthodox rabbi S. Ph. de Vries, who taught him Hebrew and whose book Joodse Riten en Symbolen (1932) undoubtedly influenced him. Jews have been preoccupied with galut, or Jewish homelessness, for two millennia, and the rebirth of Israel has not only not resolved this quandary for contemporary Jewry, but has only deepened and sharpened it.' Van Unnik's book, which focuses on the question of the self-understanding of the Jewish Diaspora in the Hellenistic-Roman period, provides us with a splendid and timely analysis of the earliest Jewish reflections on this pivotal aspect of Jewish experience. 1.

It derives from the Septuagint version of Deut 28:25, where the word leza 'dwih is rendered en diaspord, so that instead of "you shall be an object of horror," the text takes on the meaning "you shall be in the dispersion" (cf. Jer 34:17: LXX 41:17). In Deut 30:4 diaspora is the Greek equivalent to niddahdkia "banishment"; cf. Isa 56:8, LXX; Ps 146 [147]:8, LXX). The Greek translators did not adopt an expression common in Greek literature, but an unusual word denoting the dissolution of something into its constituent atoms (Plutarch Mor. 1105a; Epicurus Ep. 1.65). Moreover, they rendered various Hebrew words that are not etymologically connected with the words diaspora/diaspeir6, thus creating a conception not recognized by the Hebrew text. The reason for this development, as Van Unnik points out, was that they found themselves in a situation unknown to the ancient biblical writers living in Palestine, i.e., the situation of dispersion. Clearly, they did not understand their situation as one of exile. Whenever golah and its derivatives occur in the Hebrew text, the seventy faithfully render them with either aichmalosia ("captivity"), apoikismos, apoikesia, apoikesis, apoikia, metoikia, metoikesia ("migration"), or paroikia ("sojourning"). J. M. Modrzejewski has sought to explain this surprising choice of expressions derived from the experience of Greek colonization for rendering the very different notion of deportation and exile: The Alexandrian translators refused to face the reality that whereas Greek colonization at the dawn of the city-state took on the colors of a glorious adventure, the contemporary migrations of the Jews were the consequence of the multiple catastrophes that . . . culminated in the deportation of the entire people. In their presentation of the golah as a colony, they retrospectively aligned themselves with the Greek past. The circumstances of the times may have justified this "revisionism." Since Alexander's conquest, Jews had been allowed to participate in the new Greek colonial enterprise.2 2. Joseph M.

Schmidt pointed out that "the course of human history was always able to heal the severe wounds of the various deportations, and that from a very early stage voluntary emigration contributed to the extension of the Diaspora."3 He then went on to give a qualified approval to R. Rendtorff's view that Hellenistic optimism allowed a more favorable evaluation to replace the prophetic verdict on the Diaspora as a curse. Van Unnik argues, however, that the dire views of the Torah and the Prophets were certainly not weakened by the Septuagint. Whenever we encounter the words diaspora/diaspeirein, they are heavily laden with calamity. The views of Philo and Josephus are a separate case, since as apologists their testimony for the self-understanding of the Diaspora is of limited validity. In his Against Flaccus 45-46, Philo writes: So populous are the Jews that no one country can hold them, and therefore they settle in very many of the most prosperous countries in Europe and Asia .... and while they hold the Holy City ... to be their mother-city, yet those which are theirs by inheritance from their fathers ... are in each case accounted by them to be their fatherland in which they were born and reared, while to some of them they have come at the time of their foundation as immigrants (apoikian steilamenoi) to the satisfaction of the founders [trans. Colson]. Here the Jews of the Diaspora are a colony in the Greek sense, an emigration due to overpopulation. Apoikia is not connected with exile as in the Septuagint, and a certain sense of pride is unmistakable. Writing as an apologist, however, Philo could obviously not say that Jews live among the gentiles because of God's punishment. From a psychological standpoint, writes Van Unnik, we may say that Philo has suppressed the connection of the dispersion with the concrete situation in which he lived. As Y. Amir has noted, the Greeks founded colonies abroad and ruled them, and at times even imposed their sovereignty over the local population, whereas the position of the Jewish emigrants was generally one of a tolerated community, and nowhere that of masters. To soften that harsh reality, all Philo could do was to point to the fact that the Jews had arrived in some of the cities at the time of 3. K.

The hope for the ingathering of the dispersion was so strong that even Philo shared it (even if only in one passage), and as hard as he tried he was unable completely to spiritualize it.5 In any case, concludes Van Unnik, it is impossible to make Philo the crown witness of an optimistic and proud view of the Diaspora. The widespread cosmopolitanism found in Greek thought, which was to some extent realized in the Pax Romnana, was, as Van Unnik sees it, quite antithetical to the Jewish view of the Diaspora, which was thus profoundly at odds with the spirit of the times. Philo attempted to produce some sort of synthesis, but the Alexandrian riots show how impossible such an amalgamation really was, and that ultimately one had to choose between two rival worldviews.
