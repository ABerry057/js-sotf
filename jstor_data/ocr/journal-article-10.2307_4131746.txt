<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rachel Elior. The Three Temples: On the Emergence ofJewish Mysticism. Oxford: The Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 20004. xiv, 301 pp. In this bold and ambitious book, Rachel Elior seeks to trace the early histo- ry of Jewish mysticism, from biblical through rabbinic times. In the course of ten chapters, the author covers a wide range of material, with special attention devot- ed to Ezekiel, 1 Enoch, the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice, and of course the Hekhalot texts. While not all scholars will be convinced by the analysis presented here, one should welcome this latest installment in the author's wide-ranging and creative efforts to understand better the origins and later developments of Jewish mysticism. Elior's work posits that the ancient Jewish mystical tradition-which in essence conceives of a temple in heaven-was formed and joined by three groups of "secessionist" priests (ix, 31-33): (1) those, like Ezekiel, who were expelled from the first temple in 586 BCE; (2) the (Zadokite) priests who were forced from the second temple during the conflicts of the second century BCE; and (3) those, like the Merkabah mystics, who emerged from the rubble of the Second Temple's destruction in 70 CE. But in an argument stated early on and then expanded throughout the book, Elior posits that there is a fundamental continuity between these stages of early Jewish mysticism, such that we can speak of a continuous lit- erary tradition, composed by secessionist priests (15-17). Some of Elior's arguments for the continuity of the tradition she seeks to an- alyze are compelling. Much of Elior's analysis-including the bulk of chapters 3 through 6-focuses on the 364-day solar calendar known from, among other texts, 1 Enoch, Jubilees, and the Temple Scroll, these being documents that Elior attri- butes to secessionist priests. Following in the footsteps of Annie Jaubert,1 Elior argues that the impact of, and evidence for, the 364-day calendar, with its seven- fold pattern, can be seen not only in these and other ancient Jewish texts, but even in various passages of the Hebrew Bible, notably priestly traditions (34-62 and 82-87; see esp. 44-52). This calendar is closely tied to what Elior understands to be a core mystical idea: the correspondence between the heavenly and earthly tem- ples requires adhering to a calendar that clearly and predictably coordinates earth- ly holidays with astronomical signs (82-110). Elior has noticed many echoes of 1. Annie Jaubert, The Date of the Last Supper: The Biblical Calendar and Christian Liturgy (Staten Island: Alba, 1965). 376</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews "solar" traditions missed by earlier scholars, and those who would minimize the popularity or influence of the 364-day calendar in ancient Judaism need to reckon with Elior's analysis. Elior is also correct, I think, to emphasize the priestly contribution to the lit- erature at the heart of her interest. The alignment of priests with angels (see esp. 165-200) and the earthly temple with the heavenly one is certainly a key feature of much of second temple Jewish literature, and the supposition that priests were involved with the production and dissemination of this literature is reasonable enough, even convincing. Yet, there is a problematic tension between our author's two overall aims. On the one hand, she seeks to understand the mystical tradition as created by a series of priestly protests-those who imagine a temple in heaven are those who can no longer (by choice or force) participate in the tangible sacrifices of the earthly tem- ple. However, in her quest for continuity, she seeks to find evidence for this priest- ly tradition in practically every strain of Jewish literature from the Second Temple period. Virtually every ancient Jewish text relating in some fashion to a heavenly temple, the 364-day calendar, or other mystical, priestly, or liturgical themes is at- tributed to the broad movement of secessionist priests, regardless of whether the work can be reliably dated to one of the three specific stages of priestly protest that her book focuses on. But if these ideas are as widespread and as continually held as she claims, how can we possibly be certain that all of these texts and ideas were created by secessionist priests? For all we know, at least some of this literature could have been produced by priests, Levites, or even Israelites who were perfect- ly at home in an earthly temple that they believed corresponded to a heavenly one. Mysticism is not necessarily the exclusive reserve of the oppressed, the expelled, or the self-exiled. Our extant sources do not allow us to know with certainty what a mystical text composed by an officiating second temple priest might have looked like. But if we wanted to imagine the characteristics of such a text, we might do very well to think of something along the lines of the Songs of the Sabbath Sacri- fice. To be fair, Elior might be willing to grant this point, as she does speak at times of older priestly traditions preserved within the secessionist literature (e.g., pp. 83-84). But the clearer statements in this book all focus on the mystical cre- ativity of the secessionist priests, over against those who served in the temple. A second problem pertains to the calendar disputes. Elior argues that the 364-day, 52-week calendar establishes a fixed and unchanging correspondence be- tween heaven and earth. This stands in stark contrast to the traditional Jewish lu- nar calendar, which is subject to constant and chaotic human manipulation (44- 45, 55-56, 86-87, 106-08, 220-21). Elior's argument here too is marred by over- statement. On the one hand, Elior overlooks the fact that the moon is also in the heavens, so that a lunar calendar too can serve to connect sacred seasons with the cosmos. On the other hand, Elior overstates the virtues of the "solar" calendar. If the 364-day calendar had been truly fixed and unchanging (in accordance with Ju- bilees 6:31-32), then it would not in fact have maintained a correspondence be- tween heaven and earth at all, for the calendar would lose more than a day a year against the true solar year. The inadequacy of even a 365-day calendar was well known in antiquity, as attested by the institution of the Julian calendar with its quad- 377</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews rennial leap year in 46 BCE and the subsequent reform of the 365-day Egyptian civil calendar in 22 BCE.2 Indeed, Elior assumes that the 364-day calendar must have been intercalated in some fashion (43, 92-93 n. 17, 103) to keep up with the sun. But it is not adequately explained precisely how this calendar could have been periodically intercalated so as keep up with the sun while still preserving its "fixed, eternal, cosmic, sevenfold and fourfold symmetry" (44). If we look beyond the ex- aggerations, we can recognize that Elior is onto something here too. Ancient Jew- ish calendar disputes were about more than just dates and numbers. The differing calendars likely reflected distinct ideas about how ancient Jews understood the re- lationship between heaven and earth. Despite its overstated arguments, this is a book that should be read by those who are interested in the history of Jewish mysticism, the Jewish temple cult and, indeed, second temple or early rabbinic Judaism broadly speaking. This is an am- bitious, broadly conceived, work, one that covers a lot of ground and tries to syn- thesize a wealth of material. It's all too easy to find points of disagreement with such a work. So it should also be said to Elior's credit that it is primarily through such broadly conceived projects that scholarship can really move forward. The work under review here translates a book published in Hebrew in 2002 by Magnes Press, bearing the title Temple and Chariot, Priests and Angels, Sanc- tuary and Heavenly Sanctuaries in Early Jewish Mysticism. Minor changes in structure and format will frustrate those who wish to quickly compare the two edi- tions. While the English matches the Hebrew reasonably enough, many readers of this journal may choose to consult the Hebrew if for no other reason than the fact that the Magnes Press publication provides an index of textual citations. In place of this invaluable index, the English edition much less helpfully presents readers with advertisements for other Littman Library publications.
