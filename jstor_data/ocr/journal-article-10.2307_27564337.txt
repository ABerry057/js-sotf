Originating as 182</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews a Hebrew University dissertation, this work on Jewish mothers and children in northern France and Germany during the High Middle Ages marries some of the most recent concerns of Jewish historiography?women and family?to some of the most long-standing ones?Jewish religious rituals and Jewish Christian relations. Through her sophisticated use of gender analysis and comparative history, Baumgarten brings a fresh perspective to bear on Jewish-Christian contacts and the cultural and social milieu in medieval Ashke naz. Reminding readers that Jews did not live in ghettos and that they spoke the local vernaculars, she argues that Jews and Christians did not inhabit totally sep arate worlds. Her central claim is that Jews participated in the same "cultural sur roundings" and "social structures" as Christians, despite the manifest religious difference, ideological hostility, and occasional outright violence. In their daily and domestic lives, Jewish and Christian neighbors, especially women, drew on "shared mentalities and frameworks" and "a store of ideas, values, and beliefs" (12-13). Like Ivan Marcus and Yisrael Yuval in recent years, Baum garten challenges the image of medieval Ashkenazic society as insulated and cut off from its environment. Through prodigious research, Baumgarten creatively mines a huge array of unpublished Hebrew sources, some fifty manuscripts from eleven repositories, as well as a rich assortment of primary Jewish and Christian sources in Hebrew and Latin, such as Sefer Hasidim, halakhic works, medical texts, canon law collections, biblical commentaries (Jewish and Christian), and grave stones. She judiciously deploys secondary historical literature on medieval Jewish and Christian societies and, in addition, contemporary theoretical litera ture on women, gender, childbirth, parenthood, and ritual. Baumgarten's focus is threefold: the daily experience of Jewish mothers and young children; the cul tural values and constructions of family, fertility and infertility, motherhood, and childhood that can be adduced from normative religious and literary texts, all penned by men; and the tensions and social dynamics that these aspects of life reveal both within Jewish society and between Jewish and Christian societies. The book has five chapters in addition to a hefty introduction and a short conclusion. These are "Birth"; "Circumcision and Baptism"; "Additional Birth Rituals," in which Baumgartner includes the naming ceremony Hollekreisch, the eve of circumcision meal and vigil called Wachnacht, and the Sabbath return of the parturient to the public synagogue; "Maternal Nursing and Wet Nurses: Feeding and Caring for Infants"; and "Parents and Children: Competing Values," which treats parental responsibilities and affection as well as the darker sides of death and mourning, abandonment, and infanticide, including the "differ ent mode of abandonment" for reasons of piety, that is, when Christian mothers entered convents or Jewish mothers chose martyrdom rather than crusaders' baptism for their children (178-83). Though the book aims to illuminate Jewish family life from the birth of a child until the child's entry into formal education (at age six or seven for a boy), its primary focus is decidedly mothers. Baumgarten discusses Jewish women in multiple roles and relations: as pregnant women, nursing mothers, midwives, birth attendants, wet nurses, 183</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews participants in ritual circumcisions, wives, divorcees, widows, friends, and neighbors. She describes frequent interaction between Jewish and Christian mothers, neighbors, wet nurses, midwives, and healers. She highlights the med iating function of midwives and circumcisers between women's and men's domains. With a social functionalist and anthropological approach, she com pares Jewish and Christian women's ceremonies surrounding pregnancy, birth, and early childhood, most notably naming and initiation for infants and the return to church and synagogue of postpartum women. (Nine illustrations from med ieval manuscripts and early modern books are highly useful, as is her translation of an extensive description of the parturient's ritual in the seventeenth-century Wormser Minhagbuch of R. Juspa Shammes.) Her method is to first describe a Jewish practice from all the available sources she can muster, then to describe a rel evant Christian practice, and finally to indicate similarities and differences. She uses the comparative approach to draw phenomenological and functionalist parallels and to argue, when appropriate, for similarities of cultural assumptions and social dynamics between Jews and Christians?for example, the similar tensions and gender struggles about the role of women in public religious life in the thirteenth century. Baumgarten also makes an important contribution to Jewish women's lived history of marriage and divorce when she elucidates how changing cultural norms and halakhic rulings concerning monogamy, infertility, and maternal nursing affected the marriages and divorces of infertile wives (32-38) and limited the remarriage options of widowed and divorced mothers of young children for twenty-four months ( 144?53). The book is attractively produced. Still, better editing would have provided smoother translation in places and avoided the awkward neologism "depthful" in the concluding paragraph. Baumgarten 's book is a rich and thought-provoking contribution to the study of women, family, and ritual in medieval Jewish society and, moreover, to the cultural and social history of both medieval Jews and Christians. It joins the ranks of Shlomo Dov Goitein's A Mediterranean Society, Volume 3, The Family, and Avraham Grossman's Pious and Rebellious: Jewish Women in Medieval Europe as foundational books for the study of the Jewish family in the Middle Ages. Baumgarten issues a programmatic charge: "Thus, medie val Jews and Christians must be studied both as part of a larger joint society and as members of independent religious societies" (12-13). This is a sensible and sophisticated approach, and her argument goes beyond borrowing, influ ences, and parallels. Still, her large claim?that Jews were "full partners in medieval society" while they "developed and preserved their separate identi ties" (20)?bears further scrutiny. How to understand joint society and full partnership? What is the place of Jewish and Christian self-images of distinc tiveness when the historian finds phenomenological and functionalist parallels and sees similarities in their very assertions of difference? Were medieval Jews and Christians themselves aware of any similarities? How to weigh the con sciousness of difference and antagonism expressed by Jews and Christians in religious, textual, and ideological realms with similar daily habits and shared cultural assumptions?
