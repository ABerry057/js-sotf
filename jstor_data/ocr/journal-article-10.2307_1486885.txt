<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael Ragussis. Figures of Conversion: The Jewish Question and English National Identity. Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1995. vi, 340 pp. Readers who keep up with research on Jewish life in nineteenth-century England have had several opportunities to preview Michael Ragussis's Figures of Conversion: "The Jewish Question" and English National Identity. In a series of articles published in the journals Critical Inquiry and English Literary History between 1989 and 1994, Ragussis construes the perpetuation of antisemitic attitudes in British society and the representation of Jews in British literature as interrelated processes. These articles examine novels by Maria Edgeworth, Sir Walter Scott, Anthony Trollope, and George Eliot, and are consistent in their identification of "conversion" as an historical phenomenon and literary trope. Figures of Conversion revises, expands, and synthesizes the individual arguments of these separate articles into a book that contributes to both Judaic studies and nineteenth-century literary studies. There is new and interesting material: a fresh reading of Maria Edge- worth's Harrington, deserved attention to neglected works by Grace Aguilar, Isaac Disraeli, and Benjamin Disraeli, and an interesting take on often-read texts by Trollope and Eliot. The book, part of a series entitled "Post- Contemporary Interventions," offers good, old-fashioned close readings and brings together interesting biographical information: Edgeworth, like Dickens, was criticized for her anti-Jewish characterizations; Byron was Isaac Nathan's second choice (after Scott) to write the lyrics for his Hebrew Melodies; Sharon Turner was Isaac Disraeli's godfather. Such facts are available elsewhere, but Ragussis invests them with new significance as part of his own narrative about English literary history. Figures of Conversion is readable and engaging, of interest to both specialist and nonspecialist in the area of nineteenth-century British literature. While the book is not explicitly theoretical, its overall conception con- forms to current trends in academic writing and publishing. The terminology used to describe relationships of power is familiar to readers of contemporary</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 143 literary and cultural criticism: a hegemonic force (the English imagination) is presented as appropriating, coercing, and remaking an oppressed but threatening minority (the Jews). "English national identity" is described as undergoing a "crisis," and this crisis shapes the uniquely Victorian expression of a transhistorical, always static force (antisemitism). Ragussis claims that the stakes in his project are much higher than those in more modest earlier works, such as Edgar Rosenberg's From Shylock to Svengali (1960). They were looking only at stereotypes; he is analyzing "discourse," the continuous reinvention of the "rhetoric of conversion." Figures of Conversion assumes the endurance of "the ideology of conver- sion" in Christian thought and practice, and details the specific manifestations of this ideology in the attempts by nineteenth-century English (and Scottish and Irish) authors to "represent Jewish identity." The problems in this book are less with the individual claims about specific texts than with the conceptual glue. The phrases "the ideology of conversion," "representing Jewish iden- tity," and even "English national identity" are presented as timeless, enduring categories which find differing expressions at different historical periods. So the Victorian form of "the ideology of conversion" is the Evangelical Conversion Societies and the literature they influenced. "Representations of Jewish identity" occur whenever a nineteenth-century British novelist creates a Jewish character, and "English national identity" is apparently something that all British authors wanted to define, whether they wrote history or fiction. Ragussis has dressed up fairly traditional literary criticism in the popular, elevated terminology of sociological analysis and cultural studies. The need to insist on the "world-historical" (to use George Eliot's phrase) importance of individual plots and characters mars an illuminating, if flawed, work of criticism. The interpretative overstatement about both history and literary history is, I think, symptomatic of some strands of contemporary literary criticism, while the particular view of literary history elaborated by Ragussis as the "restoring" of "the rhetoric of conversion" to its social contexts is, perhaps, distinctly his own. Ahistorical categories, such as "the ideology of conversion," will always be found wherever they are sought; minute textual examples are atomized samples of the tired, old "spirit" of the respective age. Despite Ragussis's protests about the historicity of his study, his literary history--the excavation of ongoing tropes and themes-is dubious. He declares, with no real evidence, that a single text, Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, is an "ur-text" for all subsequent representations of Jews; therefore every representation of Jews,</page><page sequence="3">144 BOOK REVIEWS or as he would have it, Jewish identity, is a rewriting of Shakespeare's text. Ragussis thinks that The Merchant of Venice "invades the novel from Harrington to Ulysses," and that "no portrait of a Jew can exist in English without reference to it, and the English imagination seems unable to free itself of Shakespeare's text" (p. 58). But is this how images and ideas are transmitted generation to generation? Ragussis depends on a metaphor of texts begetting texts, rather than inquiring into how different cultures produced different kinds of literature, or how the same culture produced different kinds of texts over time. Or he depends on other, even more obscuring metaphors: "the extraordinarily varied means by which Shakespeare's text invades the novel may suggest the capaciousness and subtlety not only of the invading, parasitic text, but of the host text; each invasion may in fact signal a deliberate introduction of the disorder in order to trap it and thereby master it" (p. 58). In other words, to account for references and allusions to Shylock, Ragussis provides fanciful metaphors which confuse allusion with origination and make texts into autonomous agents capable of "invading," "trapping," and "mastering" each other. "Writing English Comedy: Patronizing Shylock" (chap. 2) jumps from Shakespeare to Edgeworth to "The Church Fathers" to Freud and back in the attempt to establish a tradition of conversion literature. Since the texts Ragussis examines do not all deal with literal conversion, he must define what happens in them as "figurative conversion." Although Ragussis himself has invented this term, he attributes a consciousness of it to his authors: "Edgeworth tries to take the sting out of conversion by making it only figurative" (p. 80). In other words, he will find conversion even where it does not exist, and worse, construct a figurative history for the categories he has imagined. Of these, he writes: "The origins of figurative conversion return us to the historic moment when the Christian community was formulating and constituting Jewish identity for public consumption for the first time. This period runs from the first century through the fourth century, when the battle for hegemony between Christians and Jews ended at last through the establishment of Christianity as the religion of the state" (p. 81). But the treatment of "the first through the fourth century" is limited to a two-page discussion of Eusebius, and it is hard work imagining what possible connection there might be between the nineteenth-century public, as it "consumes" Jewish identity, and the consuming public of some unspecified Christian past. The interesting reading of Harrington in this chapter is only weakened</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 145 when Ragussis places the novel in his own tradition: "By recognizing figurative conversion as a textual strategy whose forefathers were the Church Fathers, and whose modem descendants include Freud, we can situate Edge- worth's novel within the literary and cultural traditions that constitute the representation of Jewish identity both inside and outside England in ancient and modem times" (p. 86). This dizzying statement cancels the more careful historicizing of the previous chapter on conversion societies, and leads me to ask: why must the early-nineteenth-century Irish reforming educator Maria Edgeworth be situated (because one of her many works of fiction has a Jewish hero) in a tradition with Church Fathers and Freud? The clumsy mechanics of tradition-making are evident throughout Figures of Conversion, wherever Ragussis uses genealogical metaphors, such as "forefathers" and "descendants." For all of the potential complexity of his intertextual readings, his method requires him to isolate and exclude, as any genealogist must, in order to draw a straight line from The Merchant of Venice to Ulysses. The dedication to "ideology," a term left undefined by Ragussis despite his dependence on it, leaves the author straining to find coherence where his own readings reveal contradiction. Edgeworth is lauded for "subverting" and "rewriting" habitual antisemitic tropes in English literature (including those in her own earlier work), but when Harrington's ending is less than subversive, Ragussis absolves Edgeworth of responsibility: "While I have been demonstrating the ways in which Harrington seeks to expose and subvert the comic formula of The Merchant of Venice and the conventional stereotyping of Jewish identity, I am now suggesting that Berenice's 'conver- sion' in Harrington may be a sign of Edgeworth's submission to the ruling ideology" (p. 79). Selectively and inconsistently, Ragussis blames the ruling ideology for trapping and subduing the author's individual, resistant impulses. Edgeworth is a helpless woman "caught between her own convictions and the ideology of her culture" (p. 80). But is her culture the same as that of her "forefather" Shakespeare, her contemporary Scott, or her Austrian Jewish "descendant," Freud? Just as The Merchant of Venice is an ur-text that Harrington rewrites, so Ivanhoe becomes a sub-ur-text that rewrites Shakespeare, but which is itself so powerful that subsequent authors must rewrite it too. "Each of the historical romances I examine-Leila; or, the Siege of Granada (1838) by Edward Bulwer-Lytton; The Vale of Cedars; or the Martyr (1850) by Grace Aguilar, an English Jew; and The Spanish Gypsy (1868) by George Eliot--can be read as a direct response, even a sequel to Ivanhoe" (p. 128). Ragussis's</page><page sequence="5">146 BOOK REVIEWS construction, "can be read," already suggests an inclination toward allegorical interpretation. But why anyone would want to read them this way? When Ragussis traces genealogical lines, he seems to forget about ideology and the broader sociological context. One author simply rewrites another, and it is much simpler to speak of rewriting when the ideology of conversion remains constant, rather than fluid and distinct at different times and in different places. The terms Ragussis uses to talk about Fedalma in George Eliot's The Spanish Gypsy and the other daughters in question are mystified in a way which seems at odds with his historicist claims: "The converted (Jewish daughter) and conquered (Moorish son) function under the sign of the feminine in Leila" (p. 141). The issue in this chapter is race rather than religion. Fedalma, for example, is a daughter, but she is not Jewish; she is a Gypsy, and she is not converted. Ragussis reveals that for him "Jewish" has come to be inseparable from "race," so that it does not really matter whether Fedalma is a converted Jewish daughter or an unconverted Gypsy daughter. She is woman and she is not white, and therefore what happens to her is conversion. Much as I welcome this attention to Eliot's fascinating but neglected poem, its relative obscurity allows Ragussis to ride roughshod over the details of the text. The facile conflation of Jewishness and racial "otherness" implies that conversion (the changing of one's religion) includes the potential to change one's race as well. The institutionalization of "the ideology of conversion" in the conversion societies, Ragussis argues, indicates that at least some Christians considered Judaism rather than Jewishness to be the defining char- acteristic of Jews. Sometimes conversion (often really baptism) is enough to make a person of the Jewish race acceptable to Christian society; sometimes, obviously, neither formal baptism nor genuine spiritual conversion is enough. "Figurative conversion" does not account for all of the multiple ideologies that may be at work, for the presence of various and irreducible multiple attitudes, beliefs, prejudices, and perceptions. As Ragussis uses the terms "ideology," "conversion," "the feminine," he expands them beyond histor- ically specifiable significance. Eventually, the multiplication of ideologies causes terminological traffic jams and collisions: "the ideology of conversion once again merges with the ideology of the feminine: the ductility that makes woman the perfect candidate for conversion is equal to what is seen as her sexual weakness, her sexual submissiveness, her sexual usefulness" (p. 144). What do we get from this coupling? I'm not sure whose views or ideologies</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 147 these are, and the agentless, passive voice Ragussis employs ("what is seen as") is telling. Does Aguilar believe these things about "woman" (or even some women)? Does Eliot? Who is doing the seeing? In "Moses in Egypt: The Secret Jew in England," Ragussis describes the importance of the crypto-Jew to Spanish history and the fascination of some Victorian historians and novelists with fifteenth-century Spain. He goes on to identify a paranoia about crypto-Jews in late-nineteenth-century English society. "Moses in Egypt" becomes "Moses in England," and the fear on the part of Christian Englishmen that Jews might be passing as Christians is recorded in many novels of the period. Ragussis focuses on a number of Trollope's works, especially The Way We Live Now, in which a number of characters are suspected of being Jewish, and in which one definitively Jewish character, Brehgert, is a victim of Christian prejudice. But Ragussis does not discuss Brehgert, or other works of Trollope's which are sympathetic to Jews, such as Nina Balatka (1867). Instead, he argues that Trollope "produced a series of novels whose anti-Semitism is unparalleled in the nineteenth century," contrasting him to George Eliot, who "wrote the most celebrated philo-Semitic novel written in England" (p. 234). He connects Trollope's antisemitism to his hatred of Disraeli and to a general cultural dis-ease with Disraeli as a Jewish convert to Christianity. Ultimately, this chapter, like the book as a whole, suffers from the determination to let isolated examples stand in as evidence for sweeping historical claims. "English national identity" in the nineteenth century, if it existed, would be discernible to American readers at the end of the twentieth century only through an analysis and familiarity with multiple discourses. There is no documentation of, for example, Disraeli's or Trollope's political views, no sense of England except as a country of Christians obsessed with converting Jews, and only a dislocated sense of medievalism as identified in a handful of texts. Trollope wrote dozens of novels on many topics, and the novels with Jewish characters also contain dozens of other sympathetic and unsympathetically portrayed characters. Those Jewish characters themselves are varied and rarely central to the main narrative. Ragussis is, in the end, doing what he said he would not: he is documenting stereotypes and including texts in his literary history merely because they have Jewish characters in them or seem to him to be antisemitic. Whatever else Ragussis is doing, he is not illuminating "English national identity" for us. The phrase is popular, what we would expect from a "post-contemporary intervention." But the belief that such an identity is</page><page sequence="7">148 BOOK REVIEWS anything other than a fractured, conflicted mix of "ideologies" can only be the result of a disciplinary drive to find coherence where none exists, to find a single explanation for the coexistence of antisemitism, philosemitism, tolerance, and general English discomfort with any discussion of Jewishness. I can recommend Figures of Conversion as a provocative introduction to a fascinating collection of literary texts, but I remain skeptical, even fearful, of its distorting, homogenizing generalizations about the fixity of both "English national identity" and "Jewish identity."
