In his own way Maimonides makes a similar point in the introduction to his commentary on Avot, asserting that "one should accept the truth from whatever source it proceeds." What both thinkers share by virtue of their respective sentiments is a manifest intellectual openness and lack of prejudice. Correlative to this is the virtue of courage, courage to question authority. Menahem Kellner's book is Maimonidean (and Kantian) in this way. Not only is it a sober and scholarly work in Maimonidean studies, but more, it is itself a paradigm of the very virtue under discussion. Theory and practice collapse into one another in this book as Kellner targets religious fundamentalism and blind obedience to authority in writing about Maimonides' views on the nature of rabbinic authority. The book targets those in the religious camp who suggest that error, plain foolishness, and finally heresy attend those who would disagree with the rabbinic sages of the Talmud about anything. Grounding a series of claims, to be discussed in a moment, in Maimonidean dicta, Kellner responds to the modem fundamentalist by charging the latter with error and foolishness, if not perhaps heresy. The power of Kellner's critique stems, of course, from its very foundation, namely, Maimonides himself. In invoking Maimonides, agreed upon by all as a (the?) preeminent legal authority, Kellner puts the religious fundamentalist in the unenviable position of having to counter the preeminent legal authority in attempting to substantiate his own meta-halakhic claim about the infallibility of the talmudic rabbis. Of course, Kellner may be wrong about what Maimonides' positions are concerning the nature and limits of rabbinic authority. But if he has interpreted Maimonides aright, and I think he has, then the nonfundamentalists have a strong ally on their side, to say the least. Let us turn, then, to the specific claims that Kellner attributes to Mai- monides, as a result of which Maimonides (and Kellner) can make the case for open inquiry in non-halakhic matters and against rabbinic infallibility and the correlative notion of the "decline of the generations." Kellner makes a threefold claim on behalf of Maimonides: (1) The nature of rabbinic authority is grounded in the particular historical circumstances in which the rabbis of the Talmud wrote, as well as upon their exemplary moral and intellectual virtue; negatively, such authority is not grounded by some superhuman, divine imprimatur. (2) The limits of rabbinic authority are circumscribed by halakhic exegesis of the Bible. In this area, and in this area alone, is the authority of the rabbis nonpareil; but, again, such authority is grounded in</page><page sequence="3">130 BOOK REVIEWS historical circumstance, not in a divine dispensation. (3) Given the nature and limits of rabbinic authority, the pragmatics of such authority entails, perhaps even requires, freedom of inquiry in non-halakhic areas such as philosophy and science. Equally, it requires respect (not awe) for and obedience to the tradition of halakhic exegesis bequeathed to succeeding generations by the rabbis of the Talmud. In denying a belief in the decline of the generations, a Hesiodic-like view "according to which each succeeding generation, or each succeeding epoch, is in some significant and religiously relevant sense inferior to preceding generations or epochs" (p. 3), Maimonides, according to Kellner, at once licenses freedom of inquiry in the non-halakhic domain and grounds rabbinic authority in the halakhic realm on a variety of contingent factors about the world and its history. In sum, the authority of the rabbis is not a function of their (presumed) infallibility. It will immediately be seen that two of the three Maimonidean claims noted above presuppose a strict dichotomization of rabbinic interests into halakhic and non-halakhic matters. But do the rabbinic sages so divide things? Do the rabbis distinguish between law and philosophy? Does Maimonides? Isadore Twersky has argued notably that Maimonides does not refrain from doing philosophy in his Mishneh Torah. And further, the Guide presents philosophy under the guise of the "true science of the law." Indeed, there is a Maimonidean imperative to do philosophy if one is able. Nevertheless, this falls considerably short of collapsing the distinction between philosophy and (practical) halakhah. At the very least, each appeals to a different audience. More to the point, however, is whether or not Maimonides takes the talmudic rabbis to mark a distinction between the two realms and thus "distinguishes between the role and authority of the Rabbis as transmitters of the Sinaitic revelation, as creators of Halakhah, as interpreters of the Torah, and as reporters of the best science of their day" (p. 55). For Kellner, he most certainly does, and on account of this Maimonides can at once license free inquiry in the one realm, while demanding obedience and respect (for the reasons noted above) in the other. Kellner has written a book that is a paradigm of philosophical praxis, at once scholarly and action-guiding. Theory subserves practice. The desiderated goal of (studying) this book is not simply truth, but virtue. Daniel H. Frank University of Kentucky Lexington, Ky.</page></plain_text>
