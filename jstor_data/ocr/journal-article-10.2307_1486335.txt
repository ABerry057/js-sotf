<plain_text><page sequence="1">FROM THE EDITOR When the Jewish Quarterly Review first appeared almost a century ago, its editors noted that it would, unfortunately, not be accurate to say that we are about to satisfy an obvious and long-felt want. For that is scarcely a want which is not realized as such; and, though there be no English magazine devoted to the interests of Jewish Literature and Theology, History and Religion, the Jewish Community of England seems as a whole to be perfectly satisfied with its absence. Today there are a variety of English-language journals devoted to Jewish learning and opinion. Despite the plenitude, however, the appeal for more persists. This has been especially true of the call for an addi- tional forum in which scholars can communicate serious scholarship to their colleagues. This is not to say, of course, that some of the ideals of the old JQR with its express concern for the "general reader," are not still appropriate-for this concern is a recognition of the desirability of keeping scholarship literate and intelligible and of avoiding jargon, fad, and "methodology" without application. Yet these ideals may often best be pursued in rigorous examination of detail and of the seemingly abstruse, for it is, as Professor Scholem has reminded us, "in the minutiae that God can be found." It is hoped that this Review will reflect some of the changes that have taken place in the situation of both Jewish scholarship and Jewish existence over the last eight decades. It should be open to all fields of inquiry and should be limited only by the geographical and chrono- logical bounds of the Jewish people itself. When Henry James in The Bostonians wished to exemplify the preciosity so cultivated by the "culture vultures" of his day, he had one grande dame say to another: "I am going to have Professor Gougenheim-all about the Talmud. You must come." Clearly, the peripheral is defined by where we place VII</page><page sequence="2">the center. It is not for the Gougenheims of this world to label each other as obscurantists or journalists. But even the peripheral need not be parochial. Jewish history takes place in the context of the history of humanity. In studying the one, the other is not to be ignored, for often when Judaism has appeared most insular, it has had its most subtle and fruitful links with other cultures. We hope that the studies which find their place in this journal will reflect this awareness. Finally, the appearance of this first issue of the AJSreview provides occasion for an assessment of the relationship among the centers of Jewish scholarship as they exist at present-in the diaspora and Eretz Israel. Some would posit a developing polarization, an attempted asser- tion of hegemony of the one over the other. The table of contents of this volume does not support this. For one finds there both non- Israelis trained in Eretz Israel or closely tied to it as well as the reverse, giving adequate testimony to the integration of the centers of Jewish learning. It is hoped that in ways such as this the AJSreview will con- tinue to reflect the range of interests and diversity of membership of its sponsor organization. Publication of the AJSreview has been made possible by a grant from the National Foundation for Jewish Culture. The Association is grateful for the Foundations support and encouragement.
