<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hillel Levine. Economic Origins of Antisemitism: Poland and Its Jews in the Early Modern Period. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1991. xiii, 271 pp. Early in this book Hillel Levine states that archival research on Polish Jewry has produced only a number of case studies, whose "generalizability remains diifficult to establish" (pp. 15-16). In contrast he proposes "the judicious use of multiple comparisons [and . . .] social science tools" to "compensate in part for the silence of the archives and move us . . from description to analysis" (p. 16). Thus his book does not offer much</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 91 new primary data about Polish Jewry; it represents rather a synthesis of information culled from secondary sources, interpreted through comparisons with the history of Western and Central European Jewry and through the social science of Clifford Geertz and Peter Berger, among others. The question that needs to be put to this book is thus whether its "deep interpretation" yields generalizations that are any more powerful or illuminating than those generated by empirically-based case studies. To be sure, the promise that the author holds out for his method is tantalizing. He suggests in his title that his approach will explain the "economic origins of antisemitism" (p. 3)-words that adumbrate one of the most difficult problems in the history of modem Polish-Jewish relations, that of the subjective versus the objective roots of Polish attitudes toward Jews. For over a century Poles and Jews have clashed over whether behavior by Poles that Jews have regarded as hostile was unavoidable in a social system where commerce and industry were concentrated in Jewish hands, or whether it represented an inborn, ineluctable hostility. Proponents of the former position have had difficulty explaining why heavy Jewish involvement in commerce and industry should have bothered Poles if not because of some basic anti-Jewish prejudice, whereas the view of "abiding anti-Jewish sentiments in Poland as explanations rather than as results, as causes rather than as effects" tends to place "these antagonisms on something of a metaphysical level," making them "inaccessible to analysis" (p. 232). The author claims that his method has suggested "a more complicated relationship between cooperation and conflict, between the pragmatic interests that Jews represented and the religious emotions that they evoked" (ibid.). Has it? According to the author, by the mid-seventeenth century, as Poland began to lag economically behind Western Europe, the Polish gentry, unaffected by the Protestant Reformation and in control of a state bearing a strong connection to Catholicism, required an explanation for the country's economic failures in comparison with states that had been overtaken by religious falsehood. Jews provided such an explanation. Not only did the triumph of Catholicism permit Poland to remain relatively unaffected by attitudes that viewed Jews as a source of productivity rather than of revenue, but Polish Jews were now unable, in the face of Western expansion, to fulfill the function that had been assigned them for two centuries-"overcom[ing] the economic and organizational problems of feudal agriculture and the inefficiencies of guild-regulated burgher crafts and trades" (p. 235). When Jews failed in this</page><page sequence="3">92 BOOK REVIEWS task, it became easy to argue that Jewish economic activity was harmful to Poland. And because the Catholic church "continued to be the custodian of [Polish] national consciousness" (p. 237) throughout the period of the partitions, this argument was easily translated into the language of the Polish national movement. This is a clever thesis, well supported by the secondary literature marshaled to illustrate it. And because the argument was suggested by asking about the ways in which Polish social structures differed from their Western counterparts during the early modern period, the author's claims for the usefulness of his method appear strong. One can, of course, argue about whether the explanation offered by the book accounts fully for the character of Polish-Jewish relations during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but its fruitfulness as an indicator of new directions in which to think about the problem cannot be denied. Nonetheless, the book lacks the cogency that detailed reference to primary sources can provide; as it stands, it depends too much upon argument from the general to the specific, or from a foreign case to the case at hand, to be looked upon as much more than a highly suggestive hypothesis. The author is also on shaky ground when he claims that his discussion of the role played by Jews in the economy of prepartition Poland contributes to the study of "the modernization of polities and economies and the entry of Jews into the modern world" (p. 233) in general, or suggests that it has explanatory value in the study of the Holocaust. He argues that the French Revolution was paralleled by an almost simultaneous "Polish Revolution" (symbolized by the Constitution of 3 May 1791), which, although drawing its inspiration from the same intellectual wellsprings as the revolution in France, "excluded Poland's Jews from its purview" and resulted in their being "legislatively defined as nonpersons" (p. 2). And he claims that by inquiring why these two revolutions differed "in their responses to the problem of the rights and status of Jews," it will be possible to discern the "different futures . . . for the Jews of Western and Eastern Europe in the modern period" (p. 232) at which each hinted. But although Poland and France (both Catholic countries) may have begun from comparable situations in the sixteenth century and thus permit comparison of their subsequent divergence from that point, by the end of the eighteenth century they were already far apart, and the juxtaposition of their two constitutions is pointless. There really was no Polish revolution in 1791 comparable to the events of 1789 in France; thus when the author looks</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 93 forward from 1791 to the mid-twentieth century instead of backward to the 1650s, his vision seems terribly confused. This book, then, is a most useful work about Poland and its Jews in the early modern period. It is also a suggestive study of the economic origins of antisemitism in Poland specifically. To the extent that it purports to make a significant statement about the economic origins of antisemitism in general, or about the fate of the Jews in the modern world as a whole, it greatly oversteps its mark.
