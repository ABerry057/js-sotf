New York: Oxford University Press, 1988. xiii, 494 pp. This long-awaited tome is, quite simply, a beautifully wrought history of</page><page sequence="2">92 BOOK REVIEWS the Reform movement by the acknowledged master of the subject. Michael Meyer's peerless command of the vast array of sources on Reform Judaism is well known to all students of modern Jewish history, as is his ability to wrench fresh and sometimes arresting insights out of both familiar and un- familiar material. Readers of his large number of articles on the origins and fate of the Reform movement will not be surprised, therefore, to find re- peated in this volume themes and conclusions that inform Meyer's previous work, here extended, both chronologically and geographically, and ampli- fied by impressive documentation and sustained argumentation. After a cogent preface, entitled "Considerations of Historiography," there follows an excellent prologue that exemplifies Meyer's sophisticated approach to his subject and its place in Jewish history: an examination of the precedents of the Reform movement from ancient times to the early eigh- teenth century-precedents, not precursors, for Meyer wisely and correctly stresses that the "Reform movement was not an internal Jewish develop- ment" but yet that it did incorporate principles and practices from earlier phases of Jewish history that enabled it to view itself as a natural outgrowth of the Jewish past. The chapters then follow the history of the movement in roughly chronological order: from its origins in early and mid-eighteenth- century Germany to the crystallization of early Reform, Wissenschaft des Judentums, Neo-Orthodoxy, and Positive-Historical Judaism in the early nineteenth century; the growth of the Reform movement in the mid- nineteenth century and the controversies it engendered; its diffusion throughout Europe and consolidation at home and abroad; the birth of American Reform, the development on these shores of "Classical Reform," and its reorientation in the face of domestic social realities and the challenge of Zionism; and finally, the growth of Reform Judaism as an international movement, followed by an evaluation of "the new American Reform Judaism" and a short epilogue. All of these subjects are analyzed and expounded with clarity and grace, firmly mooring the history of Reform Judaism in both its Jewish and non- Jewish historical contexts. Meyer is clearly most at home in and most engaged by the earliest phases of the Reform movement, and particularly its development in Germany and spread throughout Europe; indeed, the dis- cussion of the diffusion of Reform to the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the rest of Central and Western Europe is perhaps the most innovative and impressive section of the book. When the discussion shifts to the latter half of the nineteenth century and to America, there is a somewhat inchoate but</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 93 nonetheless perceptible loss of intensity in the prose and the argument. This is somewhat ironic, since this study is, from the first page to the last, quite overtly a history of the Reform movement written not only from the inside, but from a particular point in the history of that "inside": late- twentiety-century American Reform Judaism, dedicated at once to preserv- ing the basic heritage of the movement while recasting it in a more tradition- alist and nationalist mode. It is not simply that the author's sympathies are with the moderates in the movement; rather, in a far more sophisticated manner, Meyer attempts-and most often succeeds-in muting the im- portance of the radical pronouncements and actions of reformers that have been emphasized by previous historians of the movement, both sympathetic and antagonistic. Thus, quite characteristically, his account of the High Holiday services of the Berlin Association for Reform in Judaism in 1845 notes the elimination of the shofar on Rosh Hashanah and the requirement of fasting on Yom Kippur as well as other dramatic innovations, but concludes: Yet for all their radicality, the services retained some theologically traditional elements: divine judgment at the High Holiday season, the election of Israel, the Sinaitic revelation, reward and punishment, even resurrection. There were historic references to the people of Israel, arousing the objections of some. In retrospect, [Ludwig] Philippson pronounced the worship "Jewish through and through." Similarly, a far more significant event, the Frankfurt Conference in the same year, is given an interesting gloss: the two most famous episodes of the con- ference-Zacharias Frankel's walk-out and the abandonment of the belief in the return to Zion-are chronicled in full, but the discussion then turns to a series of practical decisions made by the conference, ending with a vote to permit mayim she'uvim to be used in a mikveh. This response, Meyer notes, "while going more directly against talmudic law than any other decision, at the same time affirmed [the Reformers'] support for the use of a mikveh." "Clearly," he concludes, "even after Frankel's departure, the conference had not abandoned all attachment to Jewish particularity." This insistent emphasis on moderation and search for continuities is not only a refreshing corrective to previous treatments of such matters; it is undoubtedly more sensitive to the feelings and attitudes of the participants and their times than the highly charged treatments of the subject by either</page><page sequence="4">94 BOOK REVIEWS David Philipson or Simon Bernfeld. Similarly, his reconstruction of the con- frontation between the Reformers and Zionism is remarkably astute, avoid- ing the tendency among Israeli historians in particular to dislodge events from their historical context in regard to this highly sensitive issue. Only in his repetition here of the stance he enunciated in his 1981 Leo Baeck Memorial Lecture, German Political Pressure and Jewish Religious Response in the Nineteenth Century, that "on the whole, over the course of a long and wearisome struggle for complete emancipation in Germany, Jews refused to allow political considerations, however important to them, to dominate their religious thinking," is Meyer's revisionist bent less than convincing, and susceptible to the charge of anachronistic projection. As with any superb study, even of this length, there are, of course, lapses and matters about which to quibble. The division of material between the first two chapters is not as clear as it ought to be; thus, for example, Spinoza is not dealt with until the second chapter, a decision that is confusing and potentially misleading. The discussion of increased attention to the subjec- tive religious state of the individual in the eighteenth century should have made at least passing reference to kabbalistic beliefs on the observance of commandments held by German as well as other Jews both before and after this time. Perhaps most important to this reader is the relatively unsuccess- ful treatment of the question of Reform tendencies in Galicia, Poland, and Russia, a subject largely inaccessible to the author on linguistic grounds; on a related matter with even broader interest, Meyer fails adequately to analyze what might be termed the East Europeanization of the Reform movement in America in the twentieth century: he documents the demo- graphic changes in the student body of Hebrew Union College and in the membership of Reform temples, but fails to link these phenomena clearly to ideological shifts. But these minor problems do not in the least detract from the grand accomplishment of this volume. Michael Meyer has produced a first-rate, sympathetic but critical, voluminous but gripping, history of Reform Judaism that-despite its author's demurral-must and will be regarded as the definitive work on the subject in this generation. Our collective expecta- tions have been more than fulfilled. Michael Stanislawski Columbia University New York, N.Y.</page></plain_text>
