The Essential Agus: The Writings ofJacob B. Agus. New York: New York University Press, 1997. xii, 573 pp. In a forceful, erudite afterword to Father Jean Danielou's Dialogue with Israel (1966), Jacob Agus urged forward-looking Christian thinkers to divest themselves of anti-Jewish elements in their tradition and to build a stronger faith out of living, dynamic insights into contemporary life. "We, in appropriating for ourselves the spiritual heritage of our past, do not grant a blanket endorsement to all the actions of our forefathers, or to all their beliefs. Our faith at any time is a synthesis of our own understanding and that of our fathers." His words were self-referential as well, for Agus's life as a congregational rabbi and a philosopher of Conservative Judaism turned on this dialectic between old and new, collective and personal, inherited and innovated. Agus constructed a world of thought on two premises, one traditional--morality ensues from divine commandment, and one modern--all people are equally capable of morality regardless of religious particularity. Born in 1911 into a distinguished Polish rabbinical family on both his father's and mother's sides, Jacob Agus (Agushewitz) was acclaimed as an illui ("genius") when he entered the Tachkemoni yeshiva in Bialystok. His family migrated to Palestine in 1925, had trouble getting an economic foothold, and moved again in 1927 to the United States, settling in Boro Park. An outstanding student at Yeshiva University, Agus received smicha in 1933 and two years later the traditional "Yadin Yadin" smicha that elevated him to the status ofposeik. After taking his first pulpit in Norfolk, he engaged in an intensive study of midrash (by mail) with Louis Ginzberg of the Jewish Theological Seminary and then fulfilled a growing desire for secular expertise</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 169 by entering the doctoral program in philosophy at Harvard, which culminated in a dissertation published as Modern Philosophies ofJudaism (1940). Agus went through a decisive intellectual change after completing his Ph.D. and accepting the pulpit of Congregation Agudas Achim in Chicago. Increasingly disenchanted with Orthodox dogma, he moved on to Dayton, Ohio, to officiate over a liberal Orthodox congregation that turned Conser- vative during his tenure. In Ohio, Agus met and befriended Abraham Joshua Heschel, who was then teaching at the Hebrew Union College. In the context of a lifelong friendship, Agus and Heschel collaborated in efforts to reform the curriculum and character of the Jewish Theological Seminary and to promote Jewish-Christian dialogue. Agus finally broke from Orthodoxy after 1945 in frustration at having failed to induce greater flexibility and change in halakhah. Switching to the Conservative movement, Agus joined forces with like- minded reformers Solomon Goldman, Robert Gordis, Morris Adler, Milton Steinberg, Ben Zion Bokser, and Theodore Friedman. As a highly esteemed poseik, Agus weighed in on critical halakhic decisions such as the 1950 Responsum on the Sabbath, which allowed the use of electricity and driving to synagogue on the Sabbath. Ever since his discovery, while a student at Yeshiva, that there was no clear biblical or rabbinic basis for the mechitza, Agus had been interested in this point of law. At the request of the United Synagogue, he justified mixed seating in two secular court cases of the 1950s. Orthodoxy's response was to officially affirm the necessity of the mechitza for communal prayer and to place Agus in herem. (The ban was later repudiated.) In the 1950s and 1960s Agus built up Baltimore's Congregation Beth El into one of the leading Conservative synagogues in the country, overseeing its growth from fifty families to more than fifteen hundred. A dominating intellectual presence in the Baltimore-Washington area, Agus was known as "rabbi of the rabbis." He not only taught and advised Conservative and Reform rabbis but also attracted a group of ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students who secretly studied Talmud with him at his home. In academia, Agus served on the faculty at Temple University for many years and at Dropsie College for five of the last six years of his life. Of particular significance was his appointment at St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, making him the first non-priest authorized by the Vatican to teach Catholic seminarians. There, he lectured on the Jewish context of the Gospels. Agus's involvement in interfaith activities was one of the most important elements of his career. Working closely with the American Jewish Committee</page><page sequence="3">170 BOOK REVIEWS and the National Conference of Christians and Jews to develop interfaith programs, Agus entered into a vital relationship with Augustin Cardinal Bea that culminated in the epic declarations of Vatican II on the status of Judaism and the Jewish people in Catholic doctrine. The two volumes under review comprise a 244-page biographical an- thology and a 573-page collection of Agus's writings. Each volume opens with an introductory essay by Steven Katz and concludes with the same bibliography. Norton Shargel, David Novak, David Blumenthal, Eugene Fisher, Milton Konvitz, William Kaufman, Neil Gillman, Mordecai Waxman, Elliot Dorff, and Mark Loeb contributed essays on Agus's life and thought for American Rabbi; for The Essential Agus, they provided a selection of Agus's writings on such subjects as medieval and modem Jewish philoso- phy, Jewish-Christian dialogue, the ideology of American Judaism, Jewish concepts of God, Conservative Judaism, and Jewish law and standards. Structure is a factor that begs for comment here, because it is not evident that two volumes were either necessary or desirable in this important presentation of Jacob Agus to the reading public. Much better, in terms of both conciseness and accessibility, would have been a single volume in which each biographical essay preceded a selection of Agus's writings. Three hundred pages of Agus's work, instead of 550, would suffice and would not pose an insurmountable editing problem, because, inevitably, some of his analyses are now dated and dispensable, while some should be abridged, either because of overlap with other selections or for simple economy. It is to the editor's credit that he wanted to avoid cutting up Agus's impressively crafted work. But a well-considered ellipsis here and there, coupled with a more restrained selection of readings, would better convey what is truly unique in his thought. For a contemporary audience, Agus's writings are at their best when he is analyzing Jewish-Christian dialogue, the parameters of Conservative Judaism, and the historically prevalent intellectual tensions within Jewish thought. Particularly because the fields of Jewish-Christian dialogue and the philosophy of law in non-Orthodox Judaism remain partially cultivated at best, Agus's insights retain their potency. His historical surveys of Jewish thought may present nothing new to specialists, but they engage the reader in a rewarding encounter with the grand synthesis and articulation that are Agus trademarks. These two books describe a fiercely independent thinker who possessed the presence of mind and the character to engage Arnold Toynbee in a personal and intellectual relationship that resulted in Toynbee's reconsidering</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 171 the negative interpretation of Judaism he originally espoused in A Study of History. A staunch humanist and "neo-Maimonidean" rationalist who liked to speak of the "dark cobwebs" of mysticism, Agus nonetheless extolled Abraham Isaac Kook for his unique fusion of traditional God-centeredness with social contemporaneity. An anti-romantic and anti-nationalist, he vocally criticized certain aspects of Zionism and made enemies as a result. An innovator who yet insisted on rigor in halakhic determinations, Agus was criticized both by Conservative colleagues who considered him insufficiently liberal and by the Orthodox, and a few Conservatives, who rejected him as a radical revisionist. As Steven Katz writes in introducing Agus, he was "a serious and respectful critic" and a formidable thinker whose writings covered "an enormous historical and conceptual range" (pp. 12-13) and who "held firm to the conviction that Judaism was explicable and defensible in universal rational and ethical terms" (p. 33). Buttressed by their often-close personal relationships with Jacob Agus, the contributors to this anthology successfully present the primal intellectual energy of a man whose meditations on the nature of Jewish existence, philosophy, and law demand an audience.
