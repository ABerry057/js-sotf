Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2007. xvii, 393 pp. doi:10.1017/S0364009408001426 In this emotionally riveting study, Grossmann examines the intimate?and frequently unexpected?interactions of American and Russian occupiers, Germans and Jews, in everyday life and political discourse during the few years immediately following World War II and the Holocaust. According to Grossmann, the "close encounters" among these groups provided a space in which members could negotiate and claim identities as survivors, victims, and victors, three highly contested categories in post-Nazi Europe. Grossmann untangles these encounters by grounding herself in two sites of German, Jewish, and American interactions, namely, Berlin and the large displaced persons' (DP) camps in Bavaria. Grossmann also successfully tells her story by focusing on the gendered experiences of sexuality, the body, and reproduction. Not only is her deft narrative a welcome addition to the scholarship, but also it will likely redirect the ways in which historians write about postwar Germany in the future. Grossman's subject is not entirely new, but her methodology, research ques tions, and arguments are unique. While several scholars of Jewish and Holocaust history have written on the DPs, many of them have published in Hebrew and German. A portion of these scholarly works?and the few English studies on this topic?focus on the Holocaust and the creation of the state of Israel as lenses of analysis. These histories tend to focus on the misery of DPs' lives, their political histories, their immigration narratives, and their inability to psycho logically escape the events of 1939-45 and 1948. Grossmann certainly does not ignore these fundamental markers. However, she approaches her "fast-moving and bewildering target" as a scholar of gender and German history to offer a new and much more complicated interpretation of the postwar years (6). Grossmann shies away from previous interpretations of postwar Jews, Germans, or occupiers as monolithic categories. Her analysis looks to American and Soviet occupiers, urban and rural Germans, and German residents in Berlin and those who lived in the mostly American zone of Bavaria. Most important, Grossmann draws distinctions between Jewish DPs and Jewish city residents, and among German Jews, Eastern European Jews who had been liberated by the Allies on German soil, and the thousands of DPs who entered the American zone from Eastern Europe. The latter group included Jews who had survived among the partisans, survivors who had been freed in Germany but initially returned to their hometowns, and survivors who had been sent to Poland from the Soviet Union and then fled to the American zone. Grossmann not only success fully investigates these disparate categories, she also pays attention to the ways in which place of origin, war experiences, and postwar journeys influenced processes of identity construction and daily interactions among different populations. Grossmann rejects previous scholarly assumptions that Jews and Germans actively avoided one another during the postwar period. Drawing on a wide range of sources, including but not limited to personal narratives, letters, memoirs, diaries, novels, and films, Grossmann reveals constant interaction among diverse 453</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Jews, Germans, and occupiers. Members of these three heterogeneous groups lived as neighbors; they interacted with one another on the streets and shopped in the same markets. They frequented the same theaters and concert halls. Several had sexual relationships with one another; many even had been married before the war. Some groups were dependent on the cooperation of the other for work, while many were reliant on one another to escape prosecution or to receive protection. These sites of interaction were unexpected. Many Germans had assumed that Jews would never again live on German soil. Instead, occupied Germany served as the "unlikely, unloved, and reluctant host" to thousands of its past victims (1). In the aftermath of the Second World War, Jews did not merely reside in Germany but coexisted with Germans in unforeseen ways. These close, frequently intimate, entanglements offered Jews, Germans, and occupiers the opportunity to affirm and negotiate their identities as survivors, victors, and victims. Frequently, food, sex, and the body served as key tropes for articulating victimization, guilt, and entitlement. Some Germans, for example, envi sioned themselves as malnourished victims by comparing their lot with those of the Jews who suffered under National Socialism but whom they now saw as being pri vileged with food and material benefits during the postwar occupation. The com monplace raping of German civilian women by Russian soldiers intensified feelings of suffering. Jews asserted their identity as victims as well, which, ironi cally, did sometimes result in material benefits and compensation. Grossman explains, "designations that only days, certainly weeks, earlier would have meant deportation and almost certain death now had concrete, if very limited benefits; once the 'entry card to hell,' they 'now became a ticket to freedom'" (90). Discourses of survival and victory similarly saturated the landscape. Germans invoked tropes of survival when discussing their experiences of the bombings and of postwar defeat. Even discussions about rape could be "told as part of the narrative of survival in ruined Germany" (52) when women reflected on how they had saved their children or manipulated Russian soldiers for additional food or protection. Jews also invoked tropes of survival and victory; DPs often imagined their postwar baby boom in that way. For others, the assump tion of some kind of power represented a form of victory, if not revenge. The hiring of German nursemaids and housekeepers, the sexual entanglements between Jewish DPs and German women, and the economic recovery of Jews on German soil often was seen as some kind of retribution. Grossmann neatly interprets these contradictory claims of victimization, guilt, and entitlement by asserting their very complicated nature. She points out, for example, that Germans and occupiers may have imagined German women as innocent victims of rape but that German women often presented themselves as "resourceful agents" (53). She sees Berlin as a city that alternated with images of destruction, evidence of Nazi horrors, and of the celebrations of a resus citated city. She finds a Jewish community that, ironically, used previous Nazi records to distinguish Jews from non-Jews in order to provide Jewish-born Germans and DPs with goods and resources given by a wide array of nongovern mental organizations and the military (98). In addition, she describes German Jews who believed that American Jewish organizations favored DPs and DPs who 454</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews insisted that these same agencies preferred German Jews. In her schema, "dizzying reversals" and contradictions pervaded postwar Germany (90). Grossmann effectively acknowledges her study's strengths and limitations. She recognizes where additional work needs to be done and the kinds of sources that should be examined for further study (4, 10). In addition, she fully concedes that, despite her focus on interaction, she finds herself telling a story that is asym metrically viewed through "Jewish eyes" (10). Sometimes the richness of her source base leads to slight confusion. Her notes make it difficult to find the location of some of her unpublished letters, and she uses a similar quotation twice (63, 109)?however, these are quibbles indeed. Jews, Germans, and Allies is as generous and as inviting as it is creative. Grossmann's use of families' personal narratives adds tremendous richness and warmth to her study. Moreover, rather than banishing new scholarship to the notes, Grossmann generously refers to scholarly influences on her work within her text. This affability, combined with the book's deep scholarly importance, makes this a study that will be profoundly significant for scholars of German, Jewish, and gender history alike.
