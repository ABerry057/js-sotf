<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shaye J. D. Cohen. The Beginnings of Jewishness: Boundaries, Varieties, Uncer- tainties. Hellenistic Culture and Society, 31. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999. xv, 426 pp. This volume explores two major questions: "What is that makes a Jew a Jew, and a non-Jew a non-Jew?" and "Can a gentile become a Jew?" (p. 2). The term "Jew" was ambiguous because "there was no single or simple definition of Jew in antiquity... " and there were no "empirical or 'objective' criteria by which to de- termine who was 'really' a Jew.... Jewishness was a subjective identity, con- structed by the individual . .. other Jews, other gentiles, and the state" (p. 3). Co- hen points to Herod to demonstrate that one could be called a Jew and an Idumean at the same time (p. 23). Cohen chose to explore Jewish identity in antiquity by collecting ten of his previous publications. Only Chapters One and Six, as well as the prologue and the epilogue, were written for this volume. Because Cohen did not significantly re- work or add to these articles, his assertions, arguments, and conclusions are well known in the field. At the same time, the result of this approach is that, in place of a coherent, sustained investigation of Jewish identity in antiquity, we have ten de- tailed, but separate, examinations of topics and Greek words which help us under- stand what Jews and non-Jews meant by the term "Jew." Only by doing the work that Cohen did not do and connecting the ten studies can one create a cogent line of reasoning, as follows. In the Diaspora, Jews were not necessarily distinguished from non-Jews by 125</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review their looks, clothing, speech, names, residence, association, or even circumcision (p. 67). Although Judaeans, like all other ethnic-geographic groups, had a distinc- tive language and their own "customs, institutions, dress, cuisine, religion, and so on," none of these was necessarily more important than any other in defining a "Ju- daean" (p. 105), an Ioudaios. Before the second century BCE, Ioudaios referred to someone from Judaea or to someone who belonged to an association of those who originally came from Judaea (p. 104); it did not denote a "Jew." Under the Hasmoneans, Ioudaios lost its ethnic-geographic meaning. Now it named either a member of a "political community" that could grant citizenship to non-natives and/or a participant in a culture or religion centered on the God of the Judaeans (p. 105). This change reflects the Hellenistic definition of politeria, "which means, among other things, both 'citizenship' and 'public way of life' " and the Hellenis- tic meaning of Greekness as a function of language and culture (p. 136). Gentiles could be associated with the Jewish community on at least seven different levels, ranging from "admiring some aspect of Judaism" to "conversion to Judaism" (p. 141). Therefore, the Greek word Ioudaizzein does not mean to become Jewish. At most, in Paul and later Christian texts it denotes someone who "adopt[s] the customs and manners of the Jews" (p. 184), according to the non-Jewish authors' definitions of "Jewish" activity. Conversion to Judaism began in the second cen- tury BCE, but the conversion ritual outlined in Babylonian Talmud, Yebamot 47a- b, comes from the first two centuries CE. It was not an initiation rite, but was de- signed to regulate conversion, to ensure that the rituals were administered proper- ly, and to ensure that a proselyte knew what to expect (p. 217). The prohibition against Jews marrying non-Jews is post-biblical. This law may reflect the Roman law of persons, as well as the rabbinic prohibition against kilayim, the mixing of diverse kinds. The matrilineal principle first appeared in Mishnah, but in two distinct parts: Some texts note that the offspring of a Jewish father and a gentile mother is a gentile, while others claim that the child of a Jew- ish mother and a gentile father is a Jew (p. 278). The Palestinian Talmud suggests that the two "halves" were joined together in the second century, and Babylonian Talmud puts their conjunction in the late fourth century (p. 280). The earliest midrashic collections indicate that converts were different from native-born Is- raelites (p. 338). The Appendices conclude that (1) the epigram discussing Martial's slave does answer the questions of his being circumcised, (2) there is no evidence that Menophilus was a circumcised Jew, (3) it is not clear whether Trophimus was a Jew or a gentile, and (4) Timothy was not Jewish. We see that one can uncover a line of reason from the collection; even so, as a book, the volume has some major shortcomings. Are the issues Cohen investi- gates pressing among current scholars? Few claim that Jews in the Diaspora were clearly distinguishable from other groups, and Cohen does not make a sustained comparison between the situation in Palestine and that in the Diaspora (p. 27). The author's translations ofloudaios and loudaizein are possible, but do they fit equal- ly well in all of the examples, and are the dates at which the meanings "changed" 126</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews as clear-cut as Cohen suggests? Cohen's bringing this material together could have provided the occasion for a sustained examination of the processes of Judaism's move from an ethnic group to a religious community in all of its facets. A detailed dis- cussion of the fact that the prohibition against intermarriage, the acceptance of con- verts, and the promulgation of the matrilineal principle all occur at about the same time would have been valuable, especially in light of the Jewish community's changes in its self-perception. His explanation for the prohibition against inter- marriage is provocative, but it would have benefited from a closer reading of the vast literature on ethnicity and identity; prohibitions against marriage out of the group are typical of many types of ethnic communities. Cohen does not respond to many of the more recent investigations of conversion as a religious phenome- non, or as it occurred in the Roman world or in Judaism, nor does he enter into sus- tained arguments with those whose views differ from his. Deciding on the nature of an initiation ritual solely on the basis of Gennep's studies ignores a good deal of relevant current anthropological and sociological discussion. While the material in this volume is interesting, informative, and provoca- tive, Cohen missed an opportunity to move the discussions of Jewish identity in antiquity to another level. Gary G.
