Wolfson Ships cannot remain where the water is too shallow - Ekai, The Gateless Gate Much scholarly and popular attention has been centered on whether or not Menahem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh rebbe of the Habad-Lubavitch dynasty, identified himself as the Messiah.1 While this interest is surely understandable, both doctrin- ally and anthropologically, in my judgment, it obscures the central question concern- ing the nature of the messianism he propagated. This line of inquiry might seem gratuitous for two reasons. First, his writings, discourses, and actions are replete with references to a personal Messiah, and since there is no evidence that he ever deviated from the strictures of rabbinic orthodoxy, there should be no reason to cast doubt on his explicit assertions. Second, a distinguishing feature of Habad ideol- ogy, in consonance with the general drift of Hasidism, is the ostensible commitment to divulging mystical secrets, penimiyyut ha-torah , the spreading of the wellsprings outward ( hafasat ma 'yanot husah ) to broadcast the mysteries that impart knowledge of divinity mandatory for proper worship.2 Prima facie, it would appear that Habad 1 .

Since the publication of my book, a number of studies on Schneerson have appeared.

Wolfson breaks the code of esotericism upheld (in theory if not unfailingly in practice) by kabbalists through the centuries. This is surely the self-understanding sanctioned by the seventh rebbe, and it can be justifiably argued that he went to greater lengths than his predecessor and father-in-law, Yosef Yishaq Schneersohn - availing himself of the socioeconomic opportunities of the postwar American environment and making use of the instruments of technology - to accomplish the diffusion of the inwardness of the Torah. The historical picture is more convoluted. One should never forget that Schneerson was heir to a long-standing esoteric tradition, according to which things are not always as they seem to be, nor do they always seem to be what they are. The role of secrecy in his teaching endures both in content and in form. Even though he was overtly dedicated to the distribution of esoteric matters in the service of inculcating the concrete life of true piety, Schneerson remains beholden to the hermeneutic of dissimulation attested in much earlier sources: The mystery is a phenomenon that conceals itself in the very act of reveal- ing, for if that were not so, it would not be a mystery that was revealed.3 We can speak, therefore, of an inherent duplicity: The secret can be disseminated only if it is withheld. For Schneerson, as for many masters of Jewish esoteric wisdom, the ploy of secrecy is especially operative in the realm of messianic speculation. This is the spot where my approach diverges most conspicuously from the work of others: Schneerson's employing the standard ways of referring to the per- sonal Messiah - a point that I not only do not repudiate, but which I document painstakingly by referring to many of his overt pronouncements to this effect4 - does not mean that strict allegiance to a literal interpretation without heeding its symbolic correlate is the most felicitous path to understand the intent of his words. Rather than repeating his dicta verbatim, I have sought to gaze beneath the curtain of the explicit to determine the latent meaning underlying the copious references to an actual Messiah by contextualizing them in his specu- lations on cosmology and temporality. A crucial element of that contextualization is the attempt to frame the question of messianic belief philosophically by establishing the contours of reality according to the Habad masters. I believe with good reason that for Schneerson the decoding of the meaning of events that transpire in the temporal-spatial arena is to be envisaged through the speculum of theosophic symbolism. Borrowing the language of Joseph Mali, I would argue that the method best suited to study Schneerson is mythistory , that is, a historiography that recognizes the essential role that myth plays in the his- torical construction of personal and communal identities.5 To ascertain this phenom- enon, one must eschew the standard opposition of myth and history, the imaginal 319 n. 54, to which we may now add Menahem Mendel Schneerson, Torat Menahem: Sefer ha-Ma 'amarim 5727 (Brooklyn, NY: Lahak Hanochos, 201 1), 137 and 234. 3.

Mali's hybrid term, "ideareal history,"6 is an entirely apt depiction of Schneerson's orientation, that is, what is real in history is what is perceived idea- tionally to be real - not in an idealist sense that would reduce the material to the ideal, but in a postidealism wherein the transfigured materiality is construed mytho- poetically as the true nature of reality. This is the significance of Schneerson's teach- ing that in the messianic state we will detect that the soul is sustained by the body,7 as well as his prediction that "it will be discerned openly that nature is divinity,"8 a cos- mological perspective that I have dubbed acosmic naturalism or apophatic panentheism , that is, the perception of the nothingness incarnate in the multiple forms of existence that constitute the world.9 Viewing terrestrial events as symbolic of the dynamic potencies in the divine pleroma is a basic tenet of the kabbalistic mindset from the Middle Ages. Indeed, as Henry Corbin suggested, the "conviction that to everything that is apparent, literal, external, exoteric (zahir) there corresponds something hidden, spiritual, internal, esoteric ( batin ) is . . . the central postulate of esoterism and of esoteric hermeneutics ( ta'wfl )."10 It is preposterous to think that the seventh rebbe did not subscribe to this way of construing the concrete facts of history. Why should we entertain the possibility that he would have affirmed a notion of facticity stripped of the sheath of metaphoricization?11 The coincidence of the symbolic and the factual is the conceptual basis for my argument that the rhetoric of the per- sonal Messiah serves as a signpost to lead one to a state of unification in which all individuation - including the individuated sense of the redeemer - is overcome. The coincidence of which I speak is indicated idiomatically by the term mammash in the Habad lexicon. Following an exegetical strategy attested in older kabbalistic sources, including zoharic homilies, this term signifies the hyper- literal confluence of the literal (peshat ) and the symbolic (sod). 12 This is not to discount that there are passages in Habad literature where the terms mashal and mammash are ostensibly distinguished, the former connoting the figurative and the latter the actual, but a more profound reading of the sources intimates that it 6.

The eschatological inversion of the soul- body hierarchy - the soul is sustained by the body rather than the body by the soul - is repeated fre- quently by Schneerson.

As I note there, "the dis- cernment that nature is divinity is based on preserving the identity of their nonidentity in the nonidentity of their identity." This contrasts the Habad view with Spinoza's celebrated Deus sive Natura, according to which divinity and nature are so completely identified that any sense of difference between them is obliterated. 9.

Wolfson is precisely this locution that signifies the convergence of the two, an exegetical point that mirrors the ontological homology between the upper and lower worlds. One very important example from the first part of Tanya is worth citing: "Thus verily by way of parable [mammas h derekh mashal] is the oblitera- tion of the existence of the world and its fullness [bittul ha-olam u-melo'o bi-mesi'ut ] vis-a-vis its source, which is the light of the infinite, blessed be he."13 This text in which the phrase is embedded exhibits the larger point that is vital to comprehending the Habad perspective and my interpretation thereof: There is no mammash that is not a mashal , and hence something is thought to be actually real when it is understood that the factual is figurative and the figura- tive factual. Commenting on Yosef Yishaq's explication of the statement 'n Tanya that the soul "is verily a portion of the divine from above" ( heleq eloha mi-ma 'al mammash ),14 Menahem Mendel noted that the word mammash has two connota- tions, that which is literally so without exaggeration and that which is concretely real. 15 On closer examination, it becomes clear that these are two sides of one coin: The semantic literalness conveyed by the word mammash is connected to the sense of ontic tangibility, but the latter is determined by the symbolic domain to which actual events are correlated. The soul, therefore, is literally divine, since it is of the same substance as God; this suggests, however, that the symbolic is, in fact, more concrete than the literal, or that the literal is actual to the extent that it instantiates the symbolic. Even the language heleq eloha mi-ma ' al , which is drawn from Job 3 1 :2, needs to be deconstructed according to the Habad interpretation: If the soul is consubstantial with the infinite, it cannot be designated literally a "part of God," because the infinite is incomposite. The force of mammash , which is added to the verse, rhetorically performs the reversal that allows one to see that the literal is the figurative and the figurative literal, that substantiality is composed of what is deemed insubstantial from the empirical standpoint. I would apply this same cri- terion to the use of the term mammash in conjunction with the Messiah. Thus, explicating in a talk from the second day of Shavu'ot, 7 Sivan 5751 (20 May 1991), the desire that the Messiah should come "without delay in actuality 13. Shneur Zalman of Liadi, Liqqutei Amarim: Tanya (Brooklyn, NY: Kehot, 1984), part 1, chap. 33, 42a. What is expressed here is the key cosmological doctrine of Habad: The material universe is nullified in relation to the light of infinity (Wolfson, Open Secret , 66-129). Most significantly, this insight is marked by the paradoxical expression mammash derekh mashal , "verily by way of parable," which conveys that mystical gnosis implicates one in discerning that the dematerialization of the world is literally true to the extent that it is figuratively so, since, obviously, the world continues to exist and is not actually abolished by the contemplative gesture of nullification. See also Shneur Zalman of Liadi, Torah Or (Brooklyn, NY: Kehot, 2001 ), 68c, 86a; Menahem Mendel Schneersohn, Derekh Miswotekha (Brooklyn, NY: Kehot, 1993), 124b, cited and discussed in Elliot R. Wolfson, Alef Mem, Tan: Kahba- listic Musings on Time, Truth, and Death (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006), 230-3 1 n. 285. Although the locution mammash derekh mashal encapsulates my orientation in Open Secret , I did not refer overtly to it in that work. I was reminded of it during a reading course on the Tanya with my student Joshua Schwartz in the spring semester of 201 1 . 14.

In Habad philosophy, there is no objectivity that is not subject to symbolic confabulation. One can, and indeed must, distinguish between the mashal and the nimshal , the sign and the signified, but just as in a dream truth is inescapably entwined with deception - the dream is the deceit that dissimulates as truth, as opposed to the deceit that covers truth17 - so it is not possible for there to be a sig- nified that is not enmeshed in a web of signification.18 The innate metaphoricity of existence is anchored in the depiction of the Torah as the primordial parable ( meshal ha-qadmoni ), a mythopoeic trope that conveys the belief that the infinite light is materialized in the cloak of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, which are contained in the name YHWH, the mystical essence of the Torah.19 All that exists in the concatenation of the worlds is a manifestation of the light that is above all the worlds, a manifestation that is simultaneously a masking - a point emphasized by the wordplay between ha-olam and he'lem , that is, the world is the concealment of the infinite because the infinite is revealed therein by being con- cealed.20 Insofar as the Torah, the primordial parable or the parable of the primordial, is the image of that which has no image, the scriptural text exemplifies the conver- gence of the literal and the figurative: What is literally true is the figuration of that which has no figure, and thus human beings do not have the ability to grasp the actual divested of the metaphorical veneer. Even the messianic promise - linked exegetically to Isaiah 30:20 and 40:5 - of the "disclosure of the essence of the infi- nite light without garment" (gilluy asmut or ein sofbeli levush)2 1 amounts to seeing that there is no seeing but through a garment, perceiving the metaphysical as it is manifest in the pretense of the physical, the paradox of the boundless and the bounded being identified as one and the same ( zaynen beli gevul un gevul eyn 16.

Wolfson zakh ),22 the mystery referred to by the rabbinic depiction of the world as the place for the divine habitation, dirah ba-tahtonim ,23 the spectral immanence of the invisible transcendence.24 Instead of viewing the world as illusionary, it should be seen as allusive: The corporeal points to the spiritual in a way analogous to the hermeneu- tical claim that the esoteric meaning of the Torah is accessible only through the guise of the exoteric meaning, the light of infinity deflected through the facade of the letters, which constitute the true nature of materiality.25 To be illumined messiani- cally, therefore, entails seeing the veil unveiled as the veil, apprehending that the veil and the face behind the veil are the same in virtue of their difference.26 Predictably, this interpretation of the rebbe's thought has met with resistance and the charge that it is not the sense that the texts literally transmit.27 I do not, however, subscribe to the view that one can access the "plain meaning" without any interpretative layer, as if there were a naked truth that can be uncovered through textual exegesis. This is not to say that I think an interpreter can say whatever he or she wishes to say, or that I consider all readings equally valid. Philological pro- ficiency is, I insist, a legitimate tool to decipher the literal sense of a text. The latter, however, is not ascertained by recovering an originary meaning, a fixed reference point, but rather through the continuous discovery engendered by the ongoing disper- sal of meaning; the text, on this accord, varies with each new reading. The position I have taken is the middle ground between pure philology and constructive philosophi- cal hermeneutics: The text is not simply what the reader says, nor is the reader merely reflecting what the text says. Interpretation arises from the confrontation of text and reader, which results in the concomitant bestowal and elicitation of meaning.28 Here the notion of the "unthought" ( Ungedachte ) expounded by Heidegger is useful. In Was heisst Denkenl (1954), he contends that we are prevented from "hearing" the language of thinkers as long as the "self-deception about history" prevails, and we construe tradition as something that "lies behind us" rather 22.

The reversal of time - the fate of the future unfurled as the cause of the destiny of the past - is related to the hermeneutic of attunement to a thinker's language, which, in turn, requires that we acknowledge and respect that language, but this can come about only if one is attentive to what is unique and inexhaustible in each thinker through "being shaken to the depths by what is unthought in his thought. . . . The unthought is the greatest gift that thinking can bestow."29 The unthought is not something that can be thought once and for all, but the potential of the text to yield new meaning unremittingly in the curvature of time.30 The more original the thinking - the deeper it wells forth from the origin that stays hidden with every disclosure - the more fecund will be the attempts to articulate what remains unthought. Schneerson's own approach can be adduced from his elucidation of the novel interpretations of the Torah originating in the supernal Torah, the infinite thought or wisdom, which emanates from the "essential hiddenness" that trans- cends the triadic division of time. I will cite one passage where the matter is couched messianically. The text is based on the transcription of the discourse Schneerson offered on the second day of Shavu'ot, 7 Sivan 5728 (June 3, 1968): By means of scrutinizing [iyyun] and toiling [yegi 'ah] in the particulars of the Oral Torah, we reach above the general. And this is what they said:31 "All that a distinguished student in the future will innovate [was said to Moses at Sinai]," (specifically to innovate), for by means of toiling in the Torah we draw down from the aspect of the Torah as it is rooted in the essential conceal- ment of the infinite, which is above the aspect of the Torah as it comes in the aspect of drawing down and disclosure. And this is [the import of the expression] "I have labored and found" [yaga'ti u-masa'ti ],32 for the matter of a discovery [mesi 'ah] is that one finds a new thing that initially was not possible to imagine, like the found object that comes when one is unaware. And this is [the import of] "I have labored and found," for by means of 29. Martin Heidegger, What Is Called Thinking?, trans. Fred W. Wieck and J. Glenn Gray, intro- duction J.

Many scholars have discussed Heideg- ger's notion of the unthought, but here I will cite a succinct summary given by Kenneth Maly, "Man and Disclosure," in Heraclitean Fragments: A Companion Volume to the Heidegger/Fink Seminar on Heraclitus , ed. John Sallis and Kenneth Maly (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1980), 48: "Thinking's task is to gather thought, to bring it together, in such a way that the unthought emerges as issue. But the disclosure of the unthought to thinking does not unfold for thinking in order to be transcended or abolished, to be taken up into thought. Rather, when heeded, the unthought as issue manifests its own refusal to yield itself up to thought; and thus it shows its essential character as insist- ing on continual astonishment. It is the interplay between this withholding and manifesting of the unthought that is the issue for thinking. It is the issue of disclosure and hiddenness: a-&gt;i|0£i(x." 30.

Wolfson toiling in the Torah we discover and reveal new things, and by means of this toiling in the Torah now [and, in particular, the interiority of the Torah, which is like the Torah of the Messiah], we should merit the disclosure of the Torah of the Messiah, which comes when one is unaware.33 "I have found David, my servant [anointed him with my sacred oil]" (Psalms 89:21) ... for then there will be a disclosure of the essence of the infinite light without garment [gilluy asmut orein sofbeli levush] . . . through the coming of our righteous Messiah, verily soon [ be-qarov mammash ].34 The innovations of the Oral Torah that evolve unexpectedly from the exerted effort to explicate the text result in the uncovering of meanings that are both archaic (already given to Moses at Sinai) and novel (they could not be imagined beforehand). Rep- etition is not the mechanical return of the same, but the creative reclamation of differ- ence, the constant verbalization of a truth spoken as what is yet to be spoken. For Schneerson, Torah study is a form of disciplined spontaneity that ideally instigates an innovative replication, the saying again of what has never been said, a reiteration that always occurs "in the moment" ( be-sha ata hada ).35 This is the vehicle through which one merits to see36 the new Torah that is to emerge,37 for, according to a 33.

This theme is repeated many times in the rebbe's letters and homi- lies. For example, compare Menahem Mendel Schneerson, Liqqutei Sihot (Brooklyn, NY: Kehot, 1999), 37:128. And see especially Schneerson, Torat Menahem: Sefer ha-Ma 'amarim Meluqat , 1 :371 . Consequent to making the point that through real effort ( yegi'ah ) one can come to spontaneous discovery ( mesi'ah ) - an idea supported by the language attributed to R. Isaac that one should only believe a person who says "I have labored and found," yaga lti u-masa'ti (Babylonia Talmud, Megillah 6b) - culminating in the "essential discovery" alluded to in the verse "I have found David, my servant, anointed him with my sacred oil" (Psalms 89:21), which relates to the Messiah who comes unawares, Schneerson reports in the name of his father-in-law that the need to compel the coming of the Messiah and to communicate vigorously about it orally and in writing do not contradict this tradition; on the contrary, the true hessah ha-da'at consists of these efforts to bring the Messiah, for the Messiah cannot be brought except when one attains a metacognitive state of consciousness that is connected to yehidah. On the coming of the Messiah as a consequence of the innovations of Beshtian Hasidism, especially as refracted through Habad, and the disclosure of the mysteries of the Torah, which are linked pneumatically to the aspect of yehidah, see Schneerson, Quntres Inyanah shel Torat ha-Hasidut , 6-7. See ibid., 1 1, where hasidic teaching is identified as th q yehidah of the Torah, the dimension of the soul that "is unified perpetually in his essence, blessed be he." And ibid., 17, where Schneerson writes that the "discernment of the essence of the light of infinity is possible only from the perspective of this aspect of the soul, which is unified in his essence, blessed be he." 35.

The core of my reconstruction is based on Schneerson's persistent empha- sis on the spiritual task of the Messiah to reveal the "depth of the inwardness of the Torah," the disclosure of the "essential will" (rason asmi )39 that occasions an act of self-sacrifice, the nullification of the inner self (bittul penimi ).40 From early on, Schneerson adopted the view, which can be traced back to an oft-cited and highly influential passage from the fourth section in the Iggeret ha-Qodesh of Shneur Zalman of Liadi, that messianism involves a spiritual transformation that results from the contemplation of the divine through an opening of the "interiority of the heart" (penimit ha-lev ), which is described further as the "inner point of the heart" ( nequddat penimiyyut ha-lev) or as the "depth of the heart" ( umqa de-libba ), the "illumination of the supernal wisdom [he ' arat hokhmah elyonah ] that is above understanding [binah' and knowledge [da 'at]" the "aspect of the spark of divinity [nisos elohut ] in each Jewish soul." The coming of the Messiah is linked, therefore, to the verse "Then the Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the hearts of your offspring to love the Lord your God with all your heart and soul, in order that you may live" (Deuteronomy 30:6), for true prayer, the "worship of the heart from the depth of the heart in its interiority," demands removing the foreskin from the heart, so that one knows that God alone is the vital- ity of one's life. This is the import of the aforementioned rabbinic idea that the Messiah comes when one is unaware, that is, the Messiah corresponds to "this love that is from the depth of the heart, verily from the inner point," the facet of the soul that is above knowledge. The coming of the Messiah thus signifies the "disclosure of the aspect of the universal inner point [gilluy behinat nequddah penimit ha-kelalit ] and the exit of the collective Shekhinah from exile and . . ,,41 captivity. In a nutshell, this is the seventh rebbe's messianic message, to liberate the point of the interiority of the heart from the lowest depth {omeq tahat) to the supreme height {omeq rom),42 from the state of constriction ( mesar ) to the state of expansiveness (, merhav ),43 or, as it is often referred to, the "essential 38.

The theme occurs frequently in Schneerson's teachings and writings. Here I mention a modest sampling of the relevant sources: Liqqutei Sihot (Brooklyn, NY: Kehot, 1999), 18:122; Iggerot Qodesh (Brooklyn, NY: Kehot, 1997), no. 4111, 12:290, no. 4127, 12:307; Iggeret Qodesh (Brooklyn, NY: Kehot, 1997), no. 6451, 17:303; Iggeret Qodesh (Brooklyn, NY: Kehot, 1997), no. 8816, 23:175-76; Torat Menahem: Hitwwa'aduyyot 5712 (Brooklyn, NY: Lahak Hanochos, 1995), 1:271; Torat Menahem: Hitwwa'aduyyot 5714 (Brooklyn, NY: Vaad Hanochos BLahak, 1998), 2:210; Torat Menahem: Hitwwa'aduyyot 5719 , 1:15, 256; Torat Menahem: Sefer ha-Ma'amarim Meluqat , 1:212, 368. The locution be-sha 'ta hada u-ve-rig 'a hada is derived from Zohar 1:129a. I have rendered the term sha 'ta (Hebrew sha 'ah) as "moment" instead of the more conventional trans- lation "hour," because the context suggests that the temporal interim designated by this term is a short while, which seems to be the meaning of sha 'ah hadah in Daniel 4:16. In the Habad lexicon, the expression be-sha 'ta hada u-ve-rig' a hada is applied especially to repentance ( teshuvah ), which is a turning from one opposite to another that occurs instantaneously. See, for example, Shmuel Schneer- sohn, Liqqutei Torah: Torat Shmu'el 5639 (Brooklyn, NY: Kehot, 2004), 1:33; Yosef Yishaq Schneer- sohn, Sefer ha-Sihot 5680-5687 (Brooklyn, NY: Kehot, 2004), 74; Menahem Mendel Schneerson, Torat Menahem: Hitwwa'aduyyot 5711 (Brooklyn, NY: Vaad Hanochos BLahak, 1994), 1:183; idem, Torat Menahem: Hitwwa'aduyyot 5711 (Brooklyn, NY: Lahak Hanochos, 1995), 2:310, 321; idem, Torat Menahem: Hitwwa'aduyyot 5712 (Brooklyn, NY: Lahak Hanochos, 1997), 3:180; idem, Torat Menahem: Hitwwa 'aduyyot 5714, 2:247; idem, Torat Menahem: Hitwwa 'aduyyot 57 16 (Brook- lyn, NY: Vaad Hanochos BLahak, 2000), 1:17. 46.

The mode of worship appropriate to this conversion is referred to as "skipping" (. dillugX 49 the leap of consciousness that terminates in the "disclos- ure of the essence" ( gilluy ha-asmut) - perhaps it would be more accurate to speak of nonessence, insofar as essence, the light of infinity (or ein soj ), denotes the event of presence that is always in excess of being present - and the consequent emancipation of self through the expiration of self.50 The heart is opened through the leap to the limitlessness of the (non)essence by delimiting itself and contracting to a point, or in the liturgical language that Schneerson was fond of quoting,51 by becoming like dust.52 Through self-extinction the individual Messiah (mashiah ha-perati ) in each Jew, the "individual spark of the Shekhinah that is in the interiority of the heart," is revealed, and this begets the coming of the collective Messiah (mashiah ha-kelali), who will disclose the essential expansiveness of the Torah that is presently manifest through the study of hasidic doctrines (especially as expressed by Habad).53 the measurement of time, which .is not the case for the ordinary worship, which is measurable by the duration and surface of time." See ibid., 280. It is also of interest to consider the explanation in Schneer- son, Liqqutei Sihot, 39:347, of the expression mi-yad in the statement of Maimonides, Mishneh Torah , Teshuvah 7:5, "In the end Israel will repent in the termination of their exile, and immediately they will be redeemed [mi-yad hen nig'alin] ," as an acrostic for Moses, Israel (that is, Israel ben Eliezer, the Besht), and David, three figures related to the messianic drama. The temporal connotation of the word mi-yad is symbolic of the culmination of the redemptive process that begins with Moses and ends with David, who is identified as the king Messiah, but it also signifies that salvation will come in the "one and single moment" ( eyn un eyntsiker rege ), the "one and single point" ( eyn un eyntsike nekude ). For a similar decoding of the word mi-yad as a reference to Moses, Israel ben Eliezer, and David, see Schneerson, Sefer ha-Sihot 5751, 2:562, and additional reference cited in Wolfson, Open Secret , 312 n. 108. 48.

The talmudic idiom appears frequently in Habad literature. 49. There are too many references to skipping in the Habad sources to list here and perhaps I will dedicate a separate study to this fascinating motif, which I think can be profitably compared to the Heideggerian notion of the leap. What is important to bear in mind in this context is that the skipping denotes the mode of worship of repentance, which involves jumping rapidly from one thing to its oppo- site, from darkness to light, bitterness to sweetness, wickedness to righteousness, a gesture of overcom- ing binary opposition that is associated with Passover and the future redemption.

Wolfson The critical dimension that links the individual and the collective Messiah stems from a state of consciousness that is above knowledge,54 even above the interiority of the heart,55 and hence the worship, which brings about both types of redemption, is illustrative of a postrational or metacognitive gnosis.56 A clear enunciation of the point is found in the talk given by Schneerson on Simhat Torah, 23 Tishrei 5737 (October 17, 1976): "And the worship, which is from the aspect of yehidah , is above division, and this is the preparation that is proxi- mate to the true and complete redemption by means of our righteous Messiah, for the matter of the Messiah is yehidah , and thus there is in each Jew a spark of Messiah, for the individual yehidah that is in each Jew is a spark from the col- lective yehidah of the Messiah ... he should come to redeem us and to lead us erectly to our land in the true and complete redemption, verily soon."57 This worship is identified as repentance, insofar as the latter actualizes the "bursting of all limitations and boundaries," a quality attributed exclusively to the redeemer, whose ancestry can be traced to Pares, a name derived etymologically from the breaching of boundary (Genesis 3 8:29), 58 a gesture that does not entail the antino- mian breaking of the law but its hypernomian fulfillment.59 The Messiah represents the contemplative attainment of a mental state that exceeds all limits and supersedes all differentiation. The changes in the historical plane are not supernatural events; they are external enactments of an internal transformation. Unlike Scholem, I do not think the spiritual or interior redemption is a form of neutralization; pneumatic enlightenment is itself an acute form of messianic activism and not a deferment. This applies to Schneerson, as can be seen from the following comment in the discourse from 19 Kislev 5719 (December 1, 1958), an extensive and intensive meditation on the verse "He redeems my soul in peace," padah ve-shalom nafshi (Psalms 55:19): This is what is written in the Iggeret ha-Qodesh 60 that by means of the litur- gical worship from the interiority of the heart in the aspect of the removal of knowledge, there ensues the matter of the redemption and the deliverance of each divine spark in every Jewish soul from the imprisonment of the external forces, and by means of this as well there ensues the collective redemption, for this is [the meaning of] the Messiah will come unawares to the totality of 54.

The complete liturgical worship is the worship of self-sacrifice, which is the worship from the perspective of the essence of the soul, the aspect of yehidah in the soul. Thus when a Jew worships through the inwardness of his soul, the aspect of yehidah in his soul, he actualizes the disclosure of the collective yehidah , which is the matter of the Messiah. . . . Therefore, when the worship below is in the manner of self-sacrifice from the perspective of the disclosure of yehidah in the soul, this actualizes the disclosure of the collective yehidah of the Messiah, for through him is the collective redemption.61 We see that from a relatively early date Schneerson understands the actual coming of the personal Messiah in history symbolically as the showing of the inwardness of the heart, the aspect of the soul of each Jew - dos pintele yid62 - to which the redeemer corresponds, and the act of nullification of the self that proceeds there- from. I do not allege that the symbolic cancels the factual, but I do maintain that the import of the latter is determined by the former. By means of each Jew realiz- ing the potential to be an individual Messiah, the collective redemption ( ge 'ullah ha-kelalit) through the arrival of the Messiah in actuality (be-vi'at mashiah be-fo 'al mammash ) will be implemented.63 The messianic urgency in Schneerson's voice became exaggerated in the course of time, reaching a crescendo in the last decade of his life, but the funda- mental aspect of his teaching did not change. The salient feature of the redemp- tion, whether the individual or the collective, is a spiritual alteration in consciousness that is related to the revelation of the inwardness of the point of the heart. He repeatedly taught (following the view found in sources purportedly transmitting the view of Isaac Luria and affirmed by his six predecessors in the Habad-Lubavitch lineage)64 that the Messiah corresponds to 61.

After citing the passage about the Messiah from section four of Iggeret ha-Qodesh , Schneerson comments that the "perfection of the disclosure of the dominion of the messianic king in all of the world (the collective redemption)" comes about through the "worship of a person (the individual redemption), for there is a spark of the Messiah in each and every one (the inner point of the heart)." 62.

Redemption of the soul (linked exegetically to Psalms 55:19) is thus explained as implying that "the adversary is abolished entirely [ ha-menagged mitbattel legamrei ] . . . and this by way of the disclosure of yehidah. . . .

While not all the Habad masters are consistent on this point, there are many passages that stipulate that even this boundary will be effaced, and hence the ultimate soteriological significance attributed to the holiday of Purim according to which, by the talmudic injunction,72 one must become so inebriated that one can no longer distinguish between "blessed is Mordecai" and "cursed is Haman" (both expressions numerically equal 502). 73 The messia- nic Torah, the Torah of the Tree of Life as opposed to the Torah of the Tree of 65.

The fact that one can find detailed descriptions of the personal Messiah in Schneerson's teaching is not something that I have denied or ignored. The premise of Open Secret is that there are these references, but the question that I pondered is what they signify in the overall scheme that informed Schneerson's worldview. The very point of the Messiah in Habad Hasidism is to cultivate the nonegocentric consciousness, wherein all things personal are annihilated through the assimilation of the self in the "void that is a greater abnegation than the nothing" ( efes hu bittul yoter me-ayin ).75 Messianic consciousness, in short, is about overcoming the individ- uated sense of self (kelot ha-nefesh ) as an entity separate from the divine. The mystical meaning of the Habad messianic doctrine is contained in the words from the Sabbath morning liturgy, efes biltekha go 'alenu limot ha-mashiah , "There is naught but you, our redeemer in the days of the Messiah." Exoterically, the expression efes biltekha affirms the monotheistic belief that there is no divinity other than God, but, esoterically, it alludes to the meontological truth that even God is annihilated in the absolute naught {efes muhlat ),76 the essence ( asmut ) that is more than nothing ( ayin ), as nothing is still too much of a something to be the complete and utter extinction of all particularity vis-a-vis the light of infin- ity. The unconcealment of this truth - the disclosure of the infinite light in the finite world of discrete multiplicity - is what signals the days of the Messiah.77 As Shneur Zalman of Liadi reportedly taught, the liturgical refrain efes biltekha go 'alenu limot ha-mashiah points to the fact that "in the days of the Messiah there will be an illumination from the aspect of the naught [behinat efes] that is above the aspect of nothing [behinat ayin ]."78 Until the end of his life Menahem Mendel thought of his father-in-law in messianic terms because he believed that the sixth rebbe publicized this teaching in a quintessential way. He was, therefore, the redeemer to the extent that he proliferated the idea of the oblit- eration of existence ( bittul bi-mesi ' ut ), which does not entail the nihilistic destruc- tion of being but rather the awareness that there is nothing that is real but the infinite emptiness that is the womb of all potential becoming.79 The seventh 74.

In the Habad sources, the expression efes muhlat (ox efes ha-muhlat ) is paired with the word ayin in explicating the traditional notion of creatio ex nihilo. When interpreted mystically, this doctrine indi- cates that all things emanate from the essence of the infinite, which is the absolute naught. See Shneur Zalman of Liadi, Liqqutei Amarim: Tanya, part 4, sec. 20, 130b. The passage is cited frequently by the other Habad-Lubavitch masters, especially by the sixth and the seventh. 77.

The positivity that is enfolded in the utter negativity - the self-negating negativity - is well captured by Schneerson, Torat Menahem: Sefer ha-Ma 'amarim Meluqat, 3:33 1 : "It is known that the 415</page><page sequence="16">Elliot R. Wolfson rebbe viewed himself as the medium to fulfill the messianic mission of his prede- cessor by augmenting the circulation of this very message, to assist others in perceiving the oneness embodied in the plurality of beings, a one that is constantly being configured by the manifold of creation. From Schneerson's perspective, for the Messiah to be on the way meant that the Messiah was already present, albeit as what is still absent. He often mentioned the sixth rebbe's insistence on the impending proximity of the Messiah - expressed in the image of "standing behind the wall" ( er iz ahintern vant ), based on the midrashic interpretation80 of the description of the beloved in Song of Songs 2:9 ( hinneh zeh omed ahar kotlenufx - to express that what is necessary to bring the Messiah is to dismantle the wall, to remove the mental obstacles that hinder one from discerning that "the reality of the world is divinity" (mesi'ut ha-olam hu elohut ),82 that "the world and divinity are entirely one" (she-olam we-elohut hu kolla had)*3 As Schneerson put it in the talk from Shushan Purim 5714 (March 20, 1954): His honorable holiness, my teacher and father-in-law, Admor said a number of times that this period is the final time of the exile, and "There he is" - the Messiah - "standing behind our wall." And the matter is: "Our wall" - this nullification in the world, which is from the perspective of the disclosure of the light with respect to the world, is only the nullification of something [bittul ha-yesh ] . . . but the truth of the matter of nullifica- tion, the obliteration of existence [bittul bi-mesi 'ut], is particularly from the perspective of the light that is above any relation to the worlds. And since the intention of the creation is that created beings will be nullified vis-a-vis divinity in the absolute nullification [betelim le'lohut be-takhlit ha-bittul ], the oblit- eration of existence, for by means of this, in particular, the habitation for him [ dirah lo] is made, thus there was initially the light that is above any relation to the worlds, and from it, in particular, there ema- nated the light with respect to the worlds."

This passage and the one referred to in the following note are cited in Wolfson, Open Secret , 92, and see ibid., 222. 83. Schneerson, Torat Menahem: Hitwwa'aduyyot 5711, 1:202. According to the Yiddish recording of the discourse (www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/550378/jewish/10-Shevat- 5711-Maamar.htm), the critical comment is elohus un olam in die zelbe zakh, "divinity and the world are one and the same thing." I would like to take this opportunity to correct my rendering of part of this passage in Open Secret , 92, which was based on the Hebrew transcription. The sentence 'it is not el ha-olam , that is, the divinity as an entity unto itself and the world as an entity unto itself, but rather the divinity rules over and governs the world, for the world and divinity are entirely one" should be amended to 'it is not el ha-olam , that is, the divinity as an entity unto itself and the world as an entity unto itself, such that the divinity would rule over and govern the world, but rather the world and divinity are one and the same thing." While the meaning of the text was not affected dramatically by my error in translation, the version offered here is more accurate. I thank Eliyahu Mis- hulovin for drawing this matter to my attention. 416</page><page sequence="17">Open Secret in the Rearview Mirror applies to the wall that separates Israel and their heavenly Father, which comes about through our transgressions, as it says "But your iniquities have been a barrier etc." (Isaiah 59:2). And this is "There he is standing behind our wall" - for the Messiah is already present [kevar nimsa], but he is "standing behind our wall," behind the wall that we set up (through our transgressions), and all we must do is the break the barricade [ha-kotel ha-mafsiq ], and the Messiah will be amongst us.84 Despite the passage of time and the failure of its realization, Schneerson did not forsake this belief; on the contrary, it only deepened. On 6 Heshvan 5752 (October 14, 1991), he expressed the matter as follows in a dialogue with Morde- cai Eliyahu, the Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel from 1983 to 1993: There is nothing more for which to wait, since all the matters of worship have been completed, and they have already repented. . . . [The talmudic teaching that] "the matter is dependent only on repentance" was before some time, but now ... the matter is dependent solely on the coming of the Messiah himself. All that is necessary is that the Messiah should actually come in reality [be-fo'al mammash ], "one should point with one's finger and say this ,"85 this is our righteous Messiah. . . . The essence is that this should be literally in actuality . . . immediately and without delay in actuality [tekhef u-mi-yad mammash ], as I have said and repeated many times, it is not only that the ter- minus of the redemption is to come, but that the redemption is already stand- ing at the entrance of the door, and it is waiting for each and every Jew to open the door and to usher the redemption into the room!86 Messianic hope hinges on the paradox of preparing for the onset of what has tran- spired, the purely present future , the future that is already present as the present that is always future, the tomorrow that is now precisely because it is now tomor- row. The futurity of waiting for the Messiah to appear is not a matter of chrono- scopic time at all, but a mental state whereby and wherein one realizes that what is to come intermittently is already present perpetually.87 All one needs to 84. Schneerson, Torat Menahem: Hitwwa'aduyyot 5714, 2:160. 85. Based on the eschatological teaching attributed to R. Eleazar in the Babylonian Talmud, Ta'anit 31a: "In the future the blessed holy One will arrange a chorus for the righteous and he will sit in their midst in the Garden of Eden, and every one will point with his finger, as it is said 'In that day they shall say: This is our God, we trusted in him, and he delivered us. This is the Lord, in whom we trusted; let us rejoice and exult in his deliverance' (Isaiah 25:9)." 86. Menahem Mendel Schneerson, Torat Menahem: Hitwwa'aduyyot 5752 (Brooklyn, NY: Vaad Hanochos BLahak, 2003), 1:241^2. I have slightly corrected my earlier rendering of this passage in Open Secret , 285-86. 87. Wolfson, Open Secret , 286. It is of interest to consider the following exchange between Jesus and his disciples according to the Gospel of Thomas , logion 51, "His disciples said to him, 'When will the dead rest, and when will the new world come?' He said to them, 'What you look for has come, but you have not perceived it'" (April D. DeConick, The Original Gospel of Thomas in Translation with a Commentary and New English Translation of the Complete Gospel [London: T &amp; T Clark, 2006], 182). See ibid., logion 113: "His disciples said to him, 'When will the 417</page><page sequence="18">Elliot R.

Rather, the Kingdom of the Father is spread out over the earth, but people do not see it'" (295). I am grateful to Samuel Zinner for reminding me of these passages. 418</page></plain_text>
