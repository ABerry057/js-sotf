Waltham, MA: Brandeis University Press, 2005. xii, 212 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000797 "The Jews," proclaimed the cover of the Gaullist magazine Le Nouveau Candide in mid-March 1966, "What No One Ever Dared to Say," these words framing a black Swastika inside a white circle. Candide's sensational headline announced the appearance in Paris of a book entitled Treblinka, the Revolt of an Extermination Camp, by an obscure journalist, Jean-Fran?ois Steiner, twenty eight years old and keen to take on the world, as his publication interview made clear. In this splendidly researched and carefully argued book, Samuel Moyn tells us why Treblinka caused such a sensation, how individuals and groups reacted, and how the questions that the controversy raised are in some sense with us still. Steiner 's Treblinka challenged a universalistic perspective on Nazi crimi nality that was particularly dominant in France, largely unquestioned in the anti fascist climate of the postwar era. In this view, these crimes, symbolically and conceptually culminating in "the camps," were to be understood as a universal calamity whose victims had suffered a common fate. The key phrase was l'univers concentrationnaire, the title of what Moyn calls "the foundational French text on the concentration camps," a respected history published in 1946 by the journalist David Rousset. A friend of Jean-Paul Sartre and a Marxist intellectual, Rousset "inaugurated the notion of a separate and isolated world constructed by the Nazi regime to contain its enemies," as Moyn notes. Concentration camps were not distinguished from those, such as Treblinka, that were exclusively devoted to extermination and whose victims were overwhelmingly Jews. So strong was this perspective that it was scarcely challenged in the public sphere. People not only took its tmth for granted, they sometimes did not even recognize Steiner 's challenge to this orthodoxy when it appeared, preferring to see Treblinka merely as a valued reminder of Nazi criminality. Simone de Beauvoir, who con tributed a preface to the book and helped promote its great success, seems to have missed its obvious point. "The fact is that in the univers concentrationnaire all peoples behaved the same," she wrote, mistakenly insisting that the S S had deliberately imposed the same crushing submission on all inmates. But what the Jews suffered, Steiner declared, was not the same as other inmates. Breaking with the French orthodoxy of the time, in which the discourse turned on an undifferentiated "deportation" from France of enemies of the Reich, Steiner insisted that for the Jews, the significance of being deported, and their experience in the camps, was entirely different from that of others. The Germans' goal, for them, had nothing to do with the repression of ideological or political oppo sition; it was, rather, about murder, pure and simple. "For the Jews," he wrote, in characteristic allusive overstatement, "the real enemy was not Hitler ... it was death." "When people talk about the war of 1939-1945, they confuse two wars that have absolutely nothing in common: a world war, the one Germany made on the world, and a universal war, the war of the Nazis against the Jews, the war of the principle of death against the principle of life. In their war the Jews were alone, but it could not be otherwise." 420</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Building on this thesis, intended to shock, Steiner went on to propose an even more scandalous idea, that the Germans' assault had forced the Jews into sha meful complicity with their murderers, turning them into sheep who went to their slaughter?with a tiny minority eventually to emerge, from the depths of their degradation, into the self-assertion of revolt, one of the best examples of which was the uprising in Treblinka in 1943. Mixing testimony with historical descrip tion but also incorporating his own fictionalized imagination of what had hap pened in that camp, Steiner focused on the desperate revolt of the Jewish inmates and what Moyn refers to as "the virile and warlike hero-ethic" that the author prized as a post-Holocaust model for the Jewish people. Appearing as it did in the mid-1960s, just when a host of orthodoxies were being or were about to be challenged and ethic identities discovered, or rediscov ered, Steiner 's Treblinka set the terms for furious debates?among old and young, survivors and those beginning to be identified as second-generation of victims, left and right, Yiddishists and assimilated Jews, universalists and Jewish particularists. Moyn deftly and knowledgeably describes the protagonists, including an assembly of French intellectuals and authorities from Pierre Vidal-Naquet to Claude Lanz mann and many others. He connects the debate subtly to its multisided context? French, international, and Jewish?which included the appearance of a French translation of Hannah Arendt's Eichmann in Jerusalem in late 1966, the outbreak of the Six-Day War in the summer of 1967, and, of course, Charles de Gaulle's famous swipe at the Jewish people that year. Crudely presented by a brash young writer in 1966, entangled with his own identity as the son of Kadmi Cohen, a fiery follower of Jabotinski who was mur dered during the Holocaust, and quite openly self-promoting as a Jewish radical, Jean-Fran?ois Steiner posed issues that reverberate still?among such writers as Dominick LaCapra, Giorgio Agamben, Tzvetan Todorov, and others. My appreciation goes to Samuel Moyn for this short book that so brilliantly recovers a debate that I, like many others, only vaguely remember, and that is now more forty years old and has been largely ignored.
