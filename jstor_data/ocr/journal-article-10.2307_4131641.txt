INTRODUCTION Natan Zach, a prominent subversive Israeli poet, began publishing his poetry in the mid-1950s, together with a group of young poets who felt obliged to transform Hebrew poetry. This group included poets and critics such as Moshe Dor, Arye Sivan, Yehuda Amichai, David Avidan, Gershon Shaked, and Benjamin Harshav (Hrushovski). They published their first poems and essays in Likra't (Toward), a journal that they founded, and their group took on the same name. Only four issues of the journal appeared between 1952 and 1954. Zach was one of the outstanding poets in this group. His first book of poetry, Shirim ri'shonim (Early Poems), was published in 1955. His second book, Shirim shonim (Diverse Poems, 1960), totally changed the Israeli canon in terms of its themes and its poetic texture. Before the appearance of the Likra't group, Israeli poetry was closely aligned with the political establishment, mainly the Labor Movement, and the local literary scene was dominated by the modernist school: Avraham Shlonski, Nathan Alterman, Lea Goldberg, and their followers, the poets of 1948-Amir Gilboa, Haim Gouri, Natan Yonatan, Omer Hillel, and others. The modernist school, which dates back to the early years of the twentieth century, became dominant after prevailing over the Bialik school and the poets of the post-Bialik generation, who belonged to the literature of the Hatehiyah (revival) movement (Haim Nahman Bialik, Shaul Tchemichowski, Yaakov Steinberg, Yaakov Fichmann, Yaakov Cohen, Zalman Shneur, David Shimoni, Shin Shalom, and others) and whose thematics and poetics dominated Hebrew poetry until the end of the 1920s. Their heirs, who belonged to the modernist school, dominated until the end of the 1950s. The Likra't group, headed by Zach, set a new agenda for young Israeli poetry in all spheres of life: in the social, political, and cultural spheres (with mainly anti-institutional features) and surely in the linguistic and poetical spheres. Young Zach, together with the Likra't group, detached himself from the literary and political establishment of that period, headed by 1. Trans. from Hebrew by Hana Raz. 147</page><page sequence="2">Reuven Shoham Shlonski and Alterman, and challenged not only the conventions of his time but also the myths and the narratives that dominated Israeli discourse. Zach may be considered one of the first postmodemists in modem Hebrew poetry and a precur- sor of the historyonim hahadashim (New Historians), who tested the Zionist narratives and their overall major story lines. Zach's poetry examines the Israeli experience in all its aspects from a new point of view. His poetry also probes the biblical verses that flow in the veins of every Jewish and Israeli child starting his or her school days, looking at them as a mythical underpinning of the Israeli experience and shedding on them a different light, part ironic and part elegiac. He does so in an emaciated, almost colloquial language with a new "spoken" free rhythm, contrary to the rich poetic and prosodic norms of modemist Eretz Israeli poetry, which is lofty and melodious. The poem "'Enosh kehazir yamav" (As for man, his days are as grass),2 one of Zach's first poems, is an example of the young poet's subversive treatment of canonical literary and linguistic material. To appreciate the complexity and rich- ness of this treatment, the reader must carefully read not only the poem itself but also the biblical and classical verses that form the intertextual basis of its composition. The reader-in particular, one reading Zach's poetry for the first time- must be warned that almost every poem presents a challenge to interpretation because the reading process is frequently deliberately frustrating. The challenge lies in the apparently simple text, which uses well-known expressions, whether from biblical verses or everyday language, that conceal information gaps that the reader finds difficult to bridge, particularly on the level of the communicative situation-for example, who is speaking to whom and on what occasion. As a result, the text enables and even compels the reader to generate alternative interpretations by trying to fill in the gaps. In such a case, the text must be inter- preted in several ways, calling for a change of view for all those participating in the communicative situation in and outside the poem: between the addresser and the addressee, between the "implied author" and the "implied reader," and sub- sequently, the actual reader. Zach's text compels the reader to create different interpretations, sometimes conflicting, but no single one appears preferable. Sometimes, readers will ask themselves whether Zach's text is not simply a nonsensical play on words. This question can be countered by the poet's own words in one of his many articles of literary criticism, in which he wams the poets of his generation not to turn the poem into a play on words that is not backed by a real-world situation, for wordplay creates a "literature without a world," "scenery without a play," literariness without an authentic relationship to a concrete reality. Zach maintains that literature must reflect the real world and real life. Yet it must also reflect the kind of world that is concealed behind the fagade that journalists, entertainers, and politicians, in their blindness, perceive as real life. On the other hand, in the same article, Zach declares that wordplay should not be disdained as long as it is effective-as long as it is "amusement, 2. The Hebrew language is gender specific. To maintain the Hebrew nature of Zach's poem, I have kept its gender format. 148</page><page sequence="3">Intertextuality and Its Meaning in Natan Zach's providing a humorous coloring to the seriousness, so essential to the writer."3 Thus, when reading Zach's poetry, one must decide whether it makes sense or whether it is mere nonsense and how far the nonsense is a serious matter masking that essential seriousness, the core of true poetry. Critics have learned to cope with that uncertainty, but in every poem, it must be clarified anew that the nonsense is a serious, vital matter that calls for a close reading of any text by Zach-as we shall now show. .9.117 .nv .n- _ .2 r.'w1 r,.n. 7jilx .1 ?7~ "l, ":P~? .'bY "l.l ?~u '?n773 - * I-) llnl .s-, b0 . .7K ri .snt x T .T ? -. ? -T ? - As for man, his days are as grass. / His days are as grass. / Man's days are as grass / his days. / Fear thou not. // A man is born unto trouble. / For trouble he was born. / A man is born unto trouble / is born. / Fear thou not. // And sparks fly upward. / Upward sparks fly. / And sparks fly upward / upward. / Fear thou not.4 The poem "'Enosh kehazir yamav" closes Zach's first collection of poetry, Shirim ri'shonim, making it particularly important.5 In its thematic and poetic aspects, the text, like the poem "Lehof yamim" (On the seashore),6 indirectly reflects a subversive attitude toward traditional narratives and myths found in ancient and modem Hebrew poetry and thought. Even if these poetic utterances are far from representing an explicit poetic credo, they should be perceived as pro- nouncements requiring special attention to the intertextual relations on which the text is based. Before we turn to the poem itself, I wish to make two preliminary comments: one about the status of the poem, and the other about its nature. First, out of the twenty-six poems published in his first book, Shirim ri'shonim, Zach chose to include only eleven in his second book, Shirim shonim, but preserved the place of the poem under discussion "for the grandeur of the close."7 Yet he did not include the opening poem of Shirim ri'shonim, "Laylah bashel" (A ripe night), which attempts to express a personal, one-time romantic experience focusing on a specific relationship between the speaker and 3.

This collection was first published in 1955, and selections from it were included in an expanded edition of Zach's second book, Shirim shonim (Tel Aviv: Ha-kibbutz ha-meuhad, 1974). The first edition of Shirim shonim, not including this selection, was published in 1960. 5. In an interview with Yaakov Besser, Zach emphasized the importance of the poems opening and closing the book.

Zach, Shirim shonim, 20. 149</page><page sequence="4">Reuven Shoham his beloved--its exclusion may stem Zach's wish to shun its immaturity and sen- timentality. We may therefore assume that Zach perceived the poem "As for man, his days are as grass" as adhering to the more rigorous standards of Shirim shonim and able to fulfill the more vital role of a credo that the poet apparently wished to convey to his readers-which brings us to my second point. Second, the text in this poem is based on direct or implied quotations from the Old Testament, which compels the reader to relate not only to the personal experience reflected in it but also to the speaker's attitude toward these quotations and to the literary tradition that they represent. That attitude may be the result of the influence of T. S. Eliot, who, in his well-known treatise "Tradition and the Individual Talent," developed two related propositions: (1) All poets must become aware of the cultural tradition from which their work springs and relate to it; and (2) in the spirit of neoclassicism, which typifies Eliot's approach to poetry and the poets (a basically anti-Romantic approach), the poet should forgo his or her ego and effect a deliberate depersonalization of the autobiographi- cal speaker. Poetry, according to Eliot, is not an expression of the poet's person- ality because the artistic experience is nonpersonal. The connection between Eliot's two propositions is clear: The poet is not meant to express his or her personality and personal experience but rather to become a medium for conveying nonpersonal universal impressions and experi- ences. The purpose of the poet is not to express new personal experiences but rather to articulate those that are universal, even if they have not been experienced themselves. These nonpersonal experiences and motives will be available to writers in the cultural-literary tradition to be processed by their own spirit and per- sonality. The poet is capable of achieving the nonpersonal if he or she does not merely live in the present but also in the past that is momentarily reawakened within-to be aware not only of the past that has ceased to exist but also of the past that is still being experienced.9 In the spirit of Eliot's recommendations, Zach creates the poem out of a mosaic of well-known quotations, creating the impression of nonpersonal state- ments that are universally valid because they are taken from the classical 8. Wieseltir expands on the young Zach's lack of trust in his autobiographical "self." In Shirim shonim, Zach identifies "a consistent strategy of bypassing the specific, even fleeing from it if there is no other option."

Both focus mainly on the prosodic-musical similarities between the two poets, though Wieseltir mainly deals with the treatise "The Music of Poetry" (in T. S. Eliot, Selected Prose, 53-64).

These utterances resemble the classical rhetorical use of "commonplaces."'1 The rhetorical function of this device is to express some "axiomatic truth" that is usually banal; there is no need to establish its validity because it is self-evident and accepted by everyone and serves as a type of "current coin" in rhetorical situations. The self-evident validity of commonplaces makes them transparent and self- explanatory, so they constitute (in texts characterized by a commitment to deauto- matization) a real challenge to the author and to the reader. The author must shed new light on the cliche (to perform deautomatization), whereas the reader must apprehend the deautomatization that is created and identify in the transparent utter- ance a kind of deviation from the banal meaning of the clich6. However, because these are commonplaces, at first reading, the reader does not encounter a notable difficulty that would arouse his or her suspicion of the platitudes, and the text can be followed unhindered, unlike when reading poems such as "Dantes, lo" (Dantes, no)" or "Talitah kumi" (Talitha, arise).12 In these two poems, the implicit intertex- tual web makes it difficult for the reader to fill in the gaps and form a coherent interpretation of the poems.'3 The banal quotations appear in the poem in this order: (1) "As for man, his days are as grass: [as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth]" (Psalms 103:15). This verse is meant to remind the reader of two other texts: verses from the "com- forting" prophecies of Isaiah (40:6-8), which will be discussed later, and Bialik's chastising poem "Akhen hazir ha'am" (Indeed, this people is grass), which includes the quotation from Isaiah in its motto. (2) "Fear thou not." This call becomes a refrain at the end of each stanza and appears in the Old Testament some forty times, usually uttered by God or His representative to His messenger or addressed to a person lower in the hierarchy than the speaker. This is a call of encouragement to the frightened or hesitant messenger-prophet. (3) "Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward" (Job 5:7).14 These words are spoken by Eliphaz, Job's "friend" who denounces the "heresy" of the unfortunate pious man (Job 5:3). The first hemistich of the verse forms the basis for the second stanza of the poem, and the second, the contrasting hemistich, establishes the basis for the third stanza. The fact that the poem is based on biblical sources, so well known and there- fore hackneyed, stimulates the reader to create a preliminary hypothesis as to the situation that is based on a standard elegiac text, by means of which, as is generally accepted and required, the speaker laments his own fate and that of humanity. 10.

The refrain compels the reader to wonder, what is the connec- tion between the words lamenting humankind's bitter fate in all the stanzas and the consoling utterance "fear thou not"? One way that this connection may be under- stood (an option stemming from the reader's natural tendency to take refuge in the shadow of the quoted sources and to follow their original directive) is to call up a prophetic or pseudoprophetic situation in which the voice of the divine power speaks to the messenger, who is facing God in prayer, pleading, protesting, or accusing, when someone (God Himself or His messenger) or the speaker tries to give consolation: .N?,n. L_ [z] ...?iy A man, his days are as grass... [But] fear thou not. // A man is born unto trouble... [But] fear thou not. // And the sparks fly upward... [But] fear thou not. The purpose of the consoling words may be to counteract the messenger's apprehensions and his accusation and to encourage him to fulfill a mission he wishes to avoid, as is customary in a prophet's archetypal biography, because it is forced on him against his will. But in the end, he surrenders to the command. Zach's speaker pursues, as it were--or indeed, does (the reader finds it hard to decide, as we shall see)-the traditional behavior of the prophets in Hebrew poetry throughout the ages.'5 The difficulty confronting the reader stems from the fact that, in spite of the familiarity of the quoted texts, a rigorous reading never- theless reveals nuances that impede the reconstruction of the dialogic situation and the appropriate filling in of the gaps required by the text. For example, the cautious reader will find it difficult to identify the speaker or speakers, the addressee, the precise context of the utterances, and the attitude of the speaker(s) toward the quoted texts and to determine the tone in which the words are spoken. These ambi- guities compel the reader who is willing to endure uncertainty throughout the sequence to repeatedly reject a final hypothesis that integrates the text and the situ- ation because he or she is forced to correct assumptions again and again; even if these assumptions do not exclude the preliminary hypothesis, they compete with it, compelling the reader to bring up, while reading, additional possibilities regarding the final interpretation of the poem. This is, of course, contrary to the unambiguous situations in which these verses appear in the original biblical source. Even when the process of reading has come to an end, the reader will 15. About the archetypal biography of the prophet, which is a variation of the mythological bio- graphy of the hero, see Reuven Shoham, Ba-derekh ha-kashah (Tel Aviv: Papirus, 1990), 19-23. I expand on the prophets' traditional biography in modem Hebrew poetry and their various reincarna- tions in Kol u-dyokan (Haifa: Haifa University Press, 1988); Poetry and Prophecy (Leiden, UK: Brill, 2003); and in additional articles, forthcoming, that discuss this issue in Zach's and Haim Gouri's poetry. 152</page><page sequence="7">Intertextuality and Its Meaning in Natan Zach's find it difficult (as we shall see) to formulate a valid bottom line, as he or she may be accustomed when reading the poetry of previous generations. In his earliest poems, Zach demands that the implied reader-critic adopt what Reuven Tsur calls "negative capability" in the manner of Keats: the capability not to hasten to formulate a final binding hypothesis in spite of the temptation to arrive at a final interpretation as quickly as possible.16 This demand is anchored within a salient characteristic in the rhetoric of young Zach: a rhetoric that does not permit the implicit reader of the poem to formulate a final binding hypothesis after reading the poem. It leaves the reader confused, with several fairly clear hypotheses (frequently more than two) that are not particu- larly obscure; each one can be corroborated by the text, yet none is sufficiently valid to disprove the others or totally incontestable. To use legal language, each of the hypotheses is "innocent" but "acquitted by benefit of doubt." Earlier poets also compelled the reader to change and correct his or her preliminary hypothesis while reading."7 However, in Zach's early poetry, it is a case not only of changing one's hypothesis and arriving at a final version at the end of the process of reading the poem but also of a number of equally (or partially) valid hypotheses. This phenomenon stems from gaps left deliberately in the out- lining of the situation (who speaks to whom and on what occasion) and in the lasting uncertainty on the thematic level. 2. "AS FOR MAN, HIS DAYS ARE AS GRASS": PSALMS, ISAIAH, BIALIK, AND ZACH Turning now to the poem, the first stanza ("As for man, his days are as grass. / His days are as grass. / Man's days are as grass / His days. / Fear thou not") opens with a well-known and overly familiar verse: (Psalms 103:15) [Y'' 1. nt~,r_ y.] 1'?: "w ._ii As for man, his days are as grass: [as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.] This verse relates to the psalm ascribed to David. In the quoted text, the speaker glorifies God, who acts both in the spirit and the letter of the biblical law of retribution and even goes beyond it: God is merciful and gracious; he 16. Reuven Tsur distinguishes between the types of decisions made by the implied critic, that is, decisions on a continuum ranging from "negative capability" to "quest for certitude." Tsur follows Keats, who, in one of his letters (from which the critic quotes), reveals how he suddenly discovered that true literary greatness involves "negative capability," which he defines as the ability to remain in a state of uncertainty, mysteriousness, and doubt without groping anxiously for facts and arguments. The reader-critic, as a normal person, finds it hard to cope with lasting uncertainty. Therefore, many reader-critics attempt, consciously or unconsciously, to produce a hypothesis as quickly as possible to revert to an emotional-cognitive equilibrium; having created such a hypothesis, they will not give it up easily. See Reuven Tsur, Text kore 'olam (Tel Aviv: Ha-kibbutz ha-meuhad, 1996), 8-13. 17. For example, in the genre of the dramatic monologue a la Browning and Tennyson. See Robert Langbaum, "The Dramatic Monologue: Sympathy versus Judgment," in The Poetry ofExperi- ence (New York: W. W. Norton, 1971), 75-108; Menahem Perry, Ha-mivne ha-semanti shel shirei Bialik (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv University, 1976), who deals with the "inverted poem" by Bialik; and symbo- list or allegoric poetry (for example, Alterman' s early poetry). 153</page><page sequence="8">Reuven Shoham forgives all iniquities; he heals all diseases of the speaker and of the people in whose name he speaks; he saves them from destruction; he renews the youth of the speaker and his people; he grants charity (and justice and perhaps salvation)18 and fair judgment for all those oppressed; and he even shows mercy and overlooks the sins of the speaker and does not punish him because God, like a kind father, is merciful to his sons and daughters and because the good God "knoweth our frame" and knows "that we are dust." In other words, God's merciful and compassionate attitude stems from the Creator's recognition that humankind is "lord of creation" whom he himself has created "in His own image" or from "the dust of the ground." Therefore, humankind is a creature with immanent weaknesses-emotional and, in particular, biological. In archaic terms, man is no more than "a man" (,wm7-l ben 'enosh), a mortal creature whose life on earth is limited to the span of life of "a flower of the field... For the wind passeth over it, and is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more" (Psalms 103:15-16). The mercy of the Lord is "from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear Him" (Psalms 103:17). The psalm ends with a call to the faithful to bless the Lord, to "hearken unto the voice of His word...in all places of his dominion" (Psalms 103:22) in spite of their mortality. Zach's text relates directly and indirectly to these verses from the Psalms, and we may deduce that he also supports them (note, "A man, his days are as grass... [But] fear thou not"), but not necessarily so because the word "but" was added by the reader. Moreover, the word "grass" and the wider thematic context within which it functions in the psalm (praising and glorifying the good and merciful God, who overlooks man's weaknesses)19 send the reader to Isaiah's consoling prophecy, in which the grass is also a metaphorical vehicle for humankind. There, the theme of divine mercy is related to essential human weakness, although more forcefully: Y-. DlR, .lyn  nll .11n ,y i.- .Z. ,n .n 1.).., ,To ?

All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field: The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people are grass. The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand forever. (Isaiah 40:6-8) The word "flesh" in Isaiah replaces the word "man" ('enosh) in the psalm, and flesh, as a metonym for man, expresses the essential physical weak- ness, the nonspiritual, nondivine nature of humankind and of each individual. The lowly and debasing flesh from which humankind is fashioned is merely 18. In Hebrew, Zedakot (nlp'7T) means charity, justice, and also salvation (yeshu 'ot, n1917'). 19. In Hebrew, the root of the word 'enosh (man, iulix), chosen by the poet, expresses disease, weakness, and failure; therefore, the psalm's poet has chosen the word 'enosh and not 'adam. "His days are as grass" also points to the fact that man was created as a mortal weakling. 154</page><page sequence="9">Intertextuality and Its Meaning in Natan Zach's matter destined to rot, and here it replaces the divine spirit in the psalm. The spirit is nonmaterial, an element that raises humankind to divine eternity because it is the manifestation of the image of God within humanity (Genesis 1:26-27, 2:7). In the psalm, humanity's weakness is expressed in a simile that limits human weakness: Humanity, being mortal, merely resembles grass, and life is short; in Isaiah, this weakness is expressed in a metaphor that expands the relationship of humanity with grass to total identification, thus deepening its weakness. Human flesh not only resembles grass but is grass because each person's days are numbered: All flesh merges with the grass, though the "flesh" is not merely a metonym for man as an individual but also a metonymic synecdoche for all humankind.20 Similarly, flesh, as a metonym for humankind, debases humanity even lower in the great chain of being: One is not a human being but a piece of matter devoid of the breath of life. Humankind's supremacy as the lord of creation and as the image of God is erased, and one becomes a part of flesh in general, wan- dering on the face of the earth (in the spirit of Ecclesiastes 3:19: "A man has no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity"). In Genesis (2:7), God raises man higher and breathes the divine spirit into him to distinguish him from all other creatures on earth, whereas in Isaiah, the spirit of the Lord turns from a life-giving force that raises man up to a force that not only erases the difference between human and beast but also destroys the human being. In Isaiah, the spirit is more purposeful and violent than in the psalm, blowing on the flesh deliberately to cause it to wither like the flowers and the grass ("because the spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it," Isaiah 40:7), whereas in Psalms 103:16, it dries up the place while passing by ("For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone"). In Isaiah, it is not just a wind, as in the psalm, but the spirit of the Lord carrying out the mission of God himself, the creator and destroyer of human flesh. Thus, in the psalm and in Isaiah, the speakers emphasize that humans ('enosh, flesh) are mortal and that their fragile existence can be cut short in a moment; they are totally dependent on God's goodwill, but the prophet is more extreme than the author of the psalm. Even though Isaiah is much harsher and more concrete in portraying the fragility of human- kind's existence and God's attitude, in both canonical texts the speaker tries to console and be comforted by God's eternity and his loving kindness in forgiving 20. There are researchers who do not distinguish, on principle, between a metaphor and a simile; traditional rhetoric classifies a metaphor under tropes, which change the meaning of a word, and a simile under schemes, which do not do so. We should not ignore the distinction made by Coleridge, who speaks in his Biographia Literaria (ed. with introduction by George Watson [London: Dent, 1984], chap. 14) about the "faculty of the imagination," creating the fusion of two thoughts, "each into each by that synthetic and magical power to which" he exclusively appropriates the title "imagin- ation." This fusion is wider and deeper in a metaphor than in a simile. A simile enables us to rationalize the relationship between the vehicle and the tenor, whereas metaphoric fusion does not enable us to rationalize the new linguistic-spiritual creation expressed through metaphor. There is a difference between a man who resembles grass because his days are numbered and a man who is grass. Yet there is obviously no need to perceive metaphorical fusion, as mentioned by Coleridge, as a poetic phenomenon of greater value than a simile. 155</page><page sequence="10">Reuven Shoham our transgressions. Man, a human-being-flesh-grass-flower, must accept the verdict and its justification, anchored incontestably in the law of divine retribution by the merciful and kind God, whose "word shall stand forever" (Isaiah) "every- where in his dominion" (Psalms). On the other hand, and as suggested previously, we may presume that the intertextual relationship to the comforting prophecies of David and Isaiah will also bring to mind one of Bialik's first famous prophetic poems, "'Akhen hazir ha'am" (Indeed, this people is grass), called "From Isaiah's Vision" in its first version.21 Bialik uses Isaiah and the images of the flower and the grass not to emphasize humanity's weakness-as opposed to the power, eternity, and enduring loving kindness of God, the supreme redeemer-but to blame the nation that refuses to be redeemed or to redeem itself. The speaker lashes out against the nation that has remained apathetic toward the message of redemption and berates it for preferring the mire of exile even on hearing the loud, clear call of the shofar of salvation.22 So here, we have a series of three prophetic or pseudo- prophetic texts related to the vision of the "human being"-"flesh" and the "nation," whose weakness individually and collectively finds classical expression in the "vehicles" of"grass" and "flower," sprouting, growing, and soon cut down, to wither and leave this world, intentionally or unintentionally-that express, on the one hand, the existential frailty of humankind and, on the other hand, God's eternal loving kindness or wrath (in the case of Bialik). This is the message (with all its nuances, brought to Zach's text by the three previous ones) the reader is meant to be aware of while forming an interpretation of this stanza.23 The main question regarding the first stanza (and the whole poem) is the follow- ing: Does Zach's speaker continue to incorporate within the poem the biblical law of retribution, which is hinted at in the Old Testament texts, and the leitmotif of consolation and acceptance of the verdict, as in the Psalms and in Isaiah? If this is so, then to what extent is this the case? Does he follow up on Bialik's accusation against the nation, or does he argue with all three? In all three of these texts, the main hero is the eternal omnipotent God (including Bialik's poem). But in Zach's poem, it is not clear whether God is present during the discourse because he is not mentioned explicitly. If he is indeed present, we may presume that his voice is heard in the refrain. Thus, the 21. Dan Miron, Uzi Shavit, Smuel Tratner, Ziva Shamir, and Ruth Senfeld, eds., Hayim Nahman Bialik, Shirim. 1890-1898, critical ed. (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv University, 1983), 336. 22.

As Ben-Porat points out, "The literary allusion is a device activating two texts simul- taneously. This is achieved by manipulating a signal (simple or complex) in a given text, characterized by means of an additional, larger referent, which is always a self-contained text. The simultaneous acti- vation of two related texts leads to the development of intertextual patterns whose nature cannot be anticipated." Ziva Ben-Porat, "The Poetics of Literary Allusion," Journal for Descriptive Poetics and Theory of Literature 1 (1976): 105-28. We see the simultaneous activation of four texts, and the reader is asked to coordinate them when developing his or her interpretation. For a detailed discus- sion of this aspect of intertextuality in Zach's poetry, see Ben-Porat, "Dantes, lo," 379-90. 156</page><page sequence="11">Intertextuality and Its Meaning in Natan Zach's reader confronts a text devoid of the balance existing in the texts referred to: on one hand, humanity's weakness and essential mortality, and on the other hand, the consolation of God's eternity, his law of retribution, which is included in Bialik's poem. Bialik's speaker presumes that if the nation repents, obeys the call of the shofar, and if it arouses a redeemer "to whom is dear the name of the race and its God more than wealth and gold-those falsest idols" and answers the call-"Rise up and work, rise up and do, for with us is the hand of God!"24-then we may presume, in spite of the passionate prophecy of doom, that the nation will be granted redemption and God's goodwill. The absence or toning down of the divine element in Zach's poem high- lights the existential weakness of humankind in a world without God. This weakness is emphasized by the triple repetition of the traditional image of "man as grass." This triple formula-like repetition comes in three variations, stressing the phrase "his days," which the poet places at the end of line 1 and beginning of line 2 and isolates in line 4 as a self-contained line. The emphasis on the phrase "his days" (also reinforced a fourth time in the phrase "Man's days" in line 3) places fragile time and mortality at the center of attention ("man" appears twice, and "grass" appears three times). It is not only God who is perhaps absent from the body of Zach's poem but also the noun "flower" and the verb "flourish," which are central in the two biblical texts and in Bialik's poem ("A vine laid to waste, bud mildewed-will we be revived by dew?"). The absence of the flower and the bud (signifying revival and the continuation of life in general in spite of the mortality of the individual) leaves on the scene only what has already developed from this bud-the grass, about to be cut-and there are no new buds to regenerate it or at least its species. We have here a kind of implicit dialogue, mainly with Bialik, which may be rendered in this way: As for your rhetorical question, "Bud mildewed -will we be revived by dew?" the answer is negative. I as a mortal human being do not even have a mildewed bud to comfort me, so the dew will certainly not revive (me) nor the whole human flowering. Like the rest of humankind, I am but grass, about to be cut down, and after me nothing remains. Thus, the anticipated answer to the rhetorical question in Zach's poem is negative: There is no bud, and the grass is about to be cut and none will be left. However, Bialik meant that the gloomy image will arouse the "bud mildewed" and the "vine laid waste." Bialik's speaker demands that those who are addressed pull themselves together to reenter history as a thriving bud, as "stately vine," whereas Zach's speaker ignores the possibility of rebirth and of divine mercy. The reader may argue that the refrain that closes the three stanzas ("fear thou not") contradicts the speaker's pessimistic message; the words of the refrain are undoubtedly words of encouragement and solace. Yet the cautious reader must examine this refrain thoroughly. This collocation is not related to any specific 24. The quotations from Bialik's poem, cited here and later, are taken from Songs from Bialik, ed. and trans. Atar Hadari, with an introduction by Dan Miron (Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2000). 157</page><page sequence="12">Reuven Shoham text, as are the phrases preceding it, but to a series of biblical texts in which the speaker (usually God) encourages the addressee (usually a messenger-prophet, redeemer, or the people) and strengthens them during the meeting or in view of a historical mission to be accomplished.25 Therefore, the declaration "fear not" in the first stanza sounds problematic in view of the classical texts to which it responds. Whose voice is this, uttering words of encouragement in the refrain? Two hypotheses compete for our attention, each allowing for more than one understanding. Hypothesis A: Throughout the stanza and the poem, there is a dramatic monologue by a speaker whose words can be understood in two ways: (1) The speaker is pathetic, speaking sorrowfully throughout the poem about the human condition in the world while trying, in spite of this intolerable existential situation, to encourage the person addressed him- or herself or the reader. (2) The speaker's tone is ironic throughout the poem and relates to the texts and to the person addressed with shrewd irony, such as in Ecclesiastes, and includes the comforting phrase "fear thou not." Two questions arise: Which of these interpretations is more valid, and what is the attitude of the "implied author"? Does the implied author identify with the pathetic option or the ironic one? In other words, which is the "reliable speaker" (that is, backed by the implied author)-the pathetic one or the ironic one? Hypothesis B: This is a dramatic dialogue between speaker A, who repeats, with variations, the words of the psalm, Isaiah, and Bialik (and in the following two stanzas, those of Eliphaz) in lines 1-4 and speaker B, who responds to the words by way of the refrain "fear thou not." We can fill in the gaps in this dramatic situation in several ways: (1) Speaker A is pathetic, as in hypothesis A, and speaker B (who is responsible for the refrain) is also a pathetic or heroic speaker seeking to console speaker A to encourage him or her and to raise his or her morale. (2) Speaker A is the ironic one, treating the previously mentioned literary texts ironically, and speaker B agrees and reinforces the ironic attitude of speaker A. (3) Speaker A is a pathetic speaker, and speaker B is ironic, mocking the elegiac platitudes uttered by speaker A. (4) Speaker A is ironic, and speaker B is pathetic, trying to bolster the morale of speaker A and relieve him or her of an ironic attitude. Here, we also face the questions: Which is the most viable understanding? What is the atti- tude of the implied author regarding the two speakers? Who is the reliable speaker in this discourse, if there is one at all? The reader has no way of deciding which understanding is valid or even whether there is one correct understanding. The reader finds it difficult to identify the speaker or speakers (unlike the clear, unambiguous interpretations of the bib- lical texts and Bialik's poem). Is the speaker the author of the psalm? Is it Natan 25. For example, Joshua 8:1, "And the Lord said unto Joshua, fear not, neither be thou dis- mayed," or Isaiah 44:2, "Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb... Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen." Also Jeremiah 46:27-28, "But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel: for, behold, I will save thee from afar off." 158</page><page sequence="13">Intertextuality and Its Meaning in Natan Zach's Zach? Is it God? And who is the addressee? The reader? The author of the psalm? Natan Zach? The inability to identify the speaker and the one spoken to makes it difficult for the reader to determine which of the variations is more plausible. An ironic gap is created between the well-known verses-obvious and transparent semantically, at least on the face of it-and the reader's inability to reveal their significance in the text under discussion. In the biblical source, the phrase "fear thou not" is always directed to a specific figure: Abraham, Moses, Joshua, Isaiah, Jeremiah, or the people of Israel. This figure is made explicit in the text, and there is no need for the reader to guess or to fill in the gaps. In Zach's poem, the figure being addressed is not made explicit, nor is the one speaking, which obliges the reader to wonder to whom these "comforting" words are directed, so drastically shortened when compared with the original. Are they directed to the speaker in the poem or perhaps to the reader, who is supposed to become alarmed by the fact presented in the poem-or perhaps to both of them? Either way, shortening the biblical formula makes the utterances in the dramatic situation-in particular, "fear thou not"-sound impersonal. This also makes one suspect that the words are spoken with no genuine feeling involved, as though to get rid of an incurable whiner. 3. A MAN IS BORN UNTO TROUBLE: ELIPHAZ AND ZACH The last two stanzas ("A man is born unto trouble. / for trouble he was born. / A man is born unto trouble / is born. / Fear thou not. // And sparks fly upward. / Upward sparks fly. / and sparks fly upward / Upward. / Fear thou not") are based on the words of Eliphaz to Job, who rebukes the pious man who curses the day that he was born and, by implication, indirectly rebukes God himself for his governance and his application of the law of retribution. Job's words are in opposition to the quotation from the psalm on which the first stanza is based (which, as we have seen, also reminds the reader of Isaiah 40 and Bialik's poem). Thus, the reader's dilemma as to the appropriate "naturalization" of this text increases.26 The questions that the reader must answer in order to naturalize the text are as follows: (1) What is the situation in which the discourse takes place? (2) Who is speaking-God? The author of the psalm? Eliphaz? Job? Natan Zach? (3) To whom is he speaking-Job? The people of Israel? Everyman? The reader? (4) What is the tone-elegiac, ironic, declarative-factual, or emotionally neutral? (5) In what context are the words spoken? Despite the difficulty of answering these questions, one thing is clear: This is a situation with linguistic and literary roots in the prophetic mode.27 26. As for naturalization, see Jonathan Culler, "Convention and Naturalization," in Structuralist Poetics (London: Routledge, 1975), 131-60. 27. For various prophetic aspects of Zach's poetry, see Haviva Shohat-Meiri, "Ha'ironi kema- sekhet ha-pesimi," in 'Al ha-zehok be-safrut ha-yisre'elit (Tel Aviv: Sifriat Poalim, 1972), 61-69; and Reuven Shoham, "Dyokan ha-navi(?) be-shirato ha-mukdemet shel Natan Zach," in Sefer Natan Zach (Tel Aviv: Ha-kibbutz ha-meuhad, forthcoming). 159</page><page sequence="14">Reuven Shoham As mentioned previously, stanzas 2 and 3 are based on the words of Eliphaz to Job: 1 -)x - 1'Y nixL7 inp? 1-') niit mto :'rfl) D'i'I D'7l.'/El 'IN . . tzrN m1 .(9-6 im mrx Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground; yet man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward. I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause: which doeth great things and unsearchable, marvelous things without number. (Job 5:6-9) This is Eliphaz's answer to Job, who is sitting in the dust, scraping himself with a potsherd and cursing the day that he was born (Job 3 and, in particular, verse 20: "Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul"). Job, afflicted with scabies, complains that he is made to live too long: "Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb?" (Job 3:11); "Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants that never saw light" (Job 3:16). Job regrets that he is not like the man whose span of life is like that of grass and even like that of the flowers of the field, which fade as soon as they sprout. The biblical Job, unlike the author of the Psalms and Isaiah, does not complain that his life on earth is too short, as we might assume from the first stanza, but that his life is full of suffering and lasts too long. The second stanza throws an unexpected ironic light on the words in the first stanza. If the reader presumed that in the first stanza, the speaker addressed "everyman" or an unidentified reader, now he or she realizes that there is another option, also not definitive: that the person addressed in the first stanza is Job, who cursed his long life and the toil that his fate ordained. Supposing that the addressee is Job, the "pathetic speech" now appears meaningless because Job, in his terrible state, begs that his fate resemble that of grass or flowers and regrets that it is not so.28 The irony here is manifold: to complain about the fragility of human life (whether pathetically or ironically) to someone who wishes to die is pointless or superfluous. The fact that the reader may identify the speaker as Eliphaz, the unreliable, does not add to the validity of what is said in these two stanzas because the reader knows that Eliphaz's words stem from conventions that the implied author of the Book of Job questions vehemently. The reader has no way of determining that even if the speaker is indeed Eliphaz, it is Eliphaz the unreliable character of the Book of Job, who does not receive the backing of the implied author. Possibly, with the change in circumstances from those mythical days to the mid-twentieth century, the speaker does receive the backing of Zach's 28. "Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants that never saw light. There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest. There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor. The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master. Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul; which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hidden treasures; which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave" (Job 3:16-22). 160</page><page sequence="15">Intertextuality and Its Meaning in Natan Zach's implied author. In any case, the reader loses his or her bearings in the face of the confusing, unfocused situation that he or she is supposed to naturalize without being able to determine the validity of the utterances. Do they retain their original biblical validity, or are they by now a collection of meaningless, high-flown platitudes? As for the variations and play on Eliphaz's words, the syntactical structure of the second stanza is almost identical to that of the first, and the rhythmic struc- ture accurately follows the prosodic structure of the first stanza: V- / V V-/V-. //V- / V V-. //V-. //V V-. 29 These lexical, syntactical, and prosodic repetitions create a monotonous rhythm, making it possible to use two semantic structures: a pathetic, elegiac dirge30 or an expression of apathy and weariness-both projecting reduced emotional and spiritual energy. The speaker (Eliphaz?) knows that his words are familiar or worn out and that he does not bring up new ideas or visions. On the contrary, these words are ancient and repeated constantly, including the speaker's own three repetitions of the hackneyed phrase, as though they were part of a sacred formula. The words sound as though they were uttered pathetically or ironically, as a weary dirge, as a combination of these three states of mind, or perhaps as a whisper, a mantra, or a magical adjuration intended to create a kind of defensive wall to protect the speaker. On the basis of these utterances, the reader finds it dif- ficult to determine the attitude of the implied author: Is the author providing reinforcement and greater validity to Eliphaz's words and turning them into a lament on the fate of humanity, expressing weariness and apathy toward the cliches, or viewing them ironically? The last two options throw an ironic light on the speaker, turning him into an unreliable speaker, either in the spirit of unreliability in which the implied author of the Book of Job treats Eliphaz's florid speech or in the spirit of the contemporary situation in the middle of the twentieth century. The refrain "fear thou not," which closes the second stanza, whether it is uttered by the same speaker or by someone else, loses all relevance in this context. If, in the second stanza, it is possible to perceive this statement as an utter- ance of consolation, there is no connection between the fact that man is born unto 29. The last line may also be read as -/ V -. 30. The literary dirge imitates nonliterary and literary folk dirges, which are marked by emotion- al shock or an imitation of spiritual shock conveyed by means of monotonous repetition of the same elementary sentences. However, the literary dirge is not a spontaneous cry but a poetic expression of sorrow (sometimes ironic) about ruination. Usually, the rhythmic structure of the dirge has two hemi- stiches, the second being shorter than the first (for example, 2:3; 1:3, as in the poem under discussion)- that is, the rhetoric of the dirge is based on the syntax organizing the sentence(s) divided bilaterally and descending, in which the first hemistich is longer than the second. This is the typical biblical "dirge rhythm" (see, for example, Isaiah 14:4 ff., Ezekiel 19, Amos 5:2, and in particular, Lamentations). Through this rhythm, in which the second line of the rhyme is truncated, the mourner seems to express stifled weeping. See Jacob-Haim Tigai, "Kinah, Kinot," in 'Enziklopediah mikra'it (Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1976), 7:126-44. 161</page><page sequence="16">Reuven Shoham trouble (to labor wearily, to suffer hardship and injustice, and to live a miserable, futile, and worthless life) and the promise-part ironic, part comforting-"fear thou not." It is hard to imagine that the speaker is asking the addressee not to fear a life of suffering and hardship, a futile and worthless life. Or perhaps this utterance has lost its meaning and is pronounced mechanically, regardless of whether it is relevant. In that case, it is not ironic but rather an old record that keeps repeating the same words. Apparently, the person spouting this platitude is an unreliable speaker. 4. AS THE SPARKS FLY UPWARD: ELIPHAZ AND ZACH The third and final stanza ("and sparks fly upward. / Upward sparks fly. / and sparks fly upward / Upward. / Fear thou not") appears to be based on the antithetic parallelism in the biblical text: "A man is born unto trouble" (second stanza) and, on the other hand, "And sparks fly upward" (third stanza). Here, the words also contradict the first stanza, which is based on Psalm 103. Thus, the final stanza stands in opposition to the opening stanzas: Not only is man's life as ephemeral as that of grass (first stanza), it is also full of the trouble and suffering to which he was born and created (second stanza). Despite this, and to increase the frustration, "And sparks [bnei reshef] fly upward," free of human weakness, trouble, and mortality. This hemi- stich has always been problematic. Whatever the meaning of the Hebrew word reshef(9~vi), it is clear that these bnei reshef(r97t ' n) are negative phenomena.31 Possibly, these are not merely neutral divine forces, flying high in contrast to the insignificance, weakness, and mortality of humanity; perhaps they rise up after causing that particular person's suffering. If we follow Tur-Sinai still further, we can consider bnei reshefto be birds of prey or divine creatures, flying high in the sky and swooping down to snatch man born unto trouble or begetting it. Here, "and" does not imply a contradictory statement but an additional point (the Hebrew '1 has both meanings): Not only is man born unto trouble and not only does man cause it, but he is also tormented in his death by the pain caused by the claws of those immanent bnei reshef32 31. Loewenstamm presumes that reshefwas originally the name of a Canaanite god and not a simple noun adapted for use in any context, just as ancient translations of the Old Testament supposed. In the traditions of the ancient Near East, the word designates a scourge, sometimes related to a plague and sometimes to arrows or fire. The personified nature of reshefmay have been retained in the Book of Habakkuk (3:5) in the description of God: "Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals [reshef] went forth at his feet." Here, reshefis one of God's servants whom he uses to bring plagues to the world. Loewenstamm mentions Tur-Sinai's interpretation of the verses in Job. It is possible to read "will give birth" in place of "born" and interpret it as man himself in his iniquity causing trouble and making bnei resheffly upward, meaning that they are the metaphorical vehicle for arrows. This image may be com- pared to Psalms 91:5-6: "Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday." Whatever the case, according to most researchers, bnei reshef designate a calamity, which is in line with the Talmudic definition "All reshefis harmful" (Berakhot 5:1). See Samuel Efraim Loewenstamm, "Reshef," in 'Enziklopediah mikra'it, 7:437-41. 32. N. H. Tur-Sinai, Sefer'Iyov (Tel Aviv: Yavneh, 1954), 57. 162</page><page sequence="17">Intertextuality and Its Meaning in Natan Zach's In the third stanza, there is another obsessive repetition, like that exploited in the first two stanzas, in which the first line is an accurate quotation of the biblical text and the other lines create variations on it. This time, the speaker emphasizes the word "upward," repeated four times (bnei reshef and "fly" are repeated three times); "upward" is even assigned a line of its own (the fourth). This means that the "upward movement" is the center of gravity. In the biblical source and in this poem, bnei reshef are creatures that fly high and are able to ascend, whether out of indifference to human fate or after inflict- ing calamity on it. We may assume, by implication, that humankind will never be able to fly upward. Humanity will always be fettered by the law of gravity, which confines it to earth and what is below it. The heavens and the next blissful world are forever closed to humankind. The refrain "fear thou not" appears here for the third time. Does it express insensitive apathy toward the fate of this moribund creature that is whining about the human situation? Does it display empathy for his or her fate or wicked irony toward humanity or toward God, who created humankind? If it is empathy and the speaker responsible for the whole sequence of the text utters the words, we may conclude that the speaker is trying to console himself or herself and the reader by means of a cliche, becoming more and more hackneyed with each stanza. Here, the speaker is not reliable, because he deludes himself or herself and the reader, who is like the drowning man who clutches at a straw. If he or she is speaking apathetically, and insensitively and merely going through the motions, aware that the words are meaningless, he or she is a reliable speaker. If the speaker uses the cliche subversively and iro- nically toward God, whom he or she appears to be quoting, the speaker is undoubtedly reliable: a speaker exploiting words of encouragement that are usually attributed to God while turning them into a clich6 aimed at presenting God as transcendentally bankrupt. However, as mentioned previously, we may assume that the speaker using the cliche is a different person, one who is not responsible for the first four lines of the stanza. Assuming that the speaker is God or one of his representatives, if he tries to console this miserable human being, he is unreliable because there is neither solace for a man in his situation nor for humankind in general, and God or his representative uses the words of comfort, fully aware (or not?) that they are meaningless. On the other hand, God or his representative may be speaking ironically or mockingly toward his image. In that case, God or his representative appears here as a sadist who created man in order to torment him, as we can conclude from other poems in which Zach's speaker carries on a dialogue with God. In this case, the speaker is all the more unreliable. 5. TENTATIVE EXPERIMENTAL CONCLUSION In the introduction, I emphasized that a typical poem by Zach-and the one dealt with here is no exception-compels the reader to formulate various hypotheses regarding the situation in the text and to propose various interpret- ations. Every serious reader will eventually attempt to arrive at an integration 163</page><page sequence="18">Reuven Shoham of the variations that he or she identified in the poem. This does not mean that one will succeed in proposing an overarching hypothesis. The reader will seek some acceptable bottom line that will redress the equilibrium, enabling him or her to formulate a statement, however general, by filling in the gaps, "recuperat- ing" the text, and naturalizing it in an acceptable way.33 I shall attempt to present this type of interpretative integration without claiming that it is undisputedly valid. This integration could be rendered in the following way: Man's fate is like that of grass, and he was born unto trouble or caused it, whether as a matter of fate or owing to original sin and punishment, as opposed to bnei reshef, who fly high, indifferent to his fate or to his punishment. His situ- ation is desperate, and any attempt at solace by means of the comforting verses "fear thou not" is pathetic or intended ironically toward humankind or its creator. The restrained tone and the subdued diction, which uses the device of syntactical and prosodic monotonous repetition, lend the words the features of a dirge or a sense of weariness in words spoken in a still voice. The words are not related to a specific autobiographical experience but to the universal absurd existential human experience, which is found in Ecclesiastes and appar- ently is devoid of the existential solace of the absurd that one can find in the thought of Sartre and Camus.34 According to the "logic" of the absurd, the indi- vidual feels the experience of nothingness in all its intensity; it is the source of fears, frustrations, illusions, and superstitions to humanity. But according to Sartre and Camus, this experience is also the source of the individual's strength and freedom. Ben-Porat reveals this solace is revealed in Zach's poem "Dantes, no,"35 but as we have seen until now, it is absent from the poem under study. Whether God is present in the text (in the refrain) or whether his presence is eliminated, it is clear that the very use of biblical texts in their original form, without any verbal additions, contains a subversive, vigorous statement against the theological tradition of humankind in general and against God, the principal hero of this supreme theological plot. Humanity has no comforter, and the comforting option, as perceived in the thought and poetry of the absurd and of existentialism, has no place in this poem. Because we are able to identify pronouncements against God here, it should be pointed out that in this early poem by Zach-when compared with prophetic and pseudoprophetic poetry reflected in modem Hebrew literature- the metaphysical revolt, which commonly appears, does not appear as the first motif in the archetypal prophetic or pseudoprophetic plot. Usually, there is a pre- liminary revelation scene that displays the mission of the prophet and increas- ingly bitter arguments with the public, the oppressive foe, the ruler(s), and so 33.

On the affinity of Shirim shonim with the thought and atmosphere of the authors of the absurd, see Joseph Milman,'Esh karah zarah (Tel Aviv: Ha-kibbutz ha-meuhad, 1995), 39-76. On the affinity of these poems with absurd existentialist thought, see Ben-Porat, "Dantes, lo"; Weissbrod, "Natan Zach/'Shirim shonim"'; and Or-zion Bar-Tana, "Zach be'or Zach," in Zehirut safrut erez yisre'elit (Tel Aviv: Papirus, 1989), 167-91, who tries to dissociate the conception arising from Zach's poems from the existentialist approach. 35. Ben-Porat, "Dantes, lo." 164</page><page sequence="19">Intertextuality and Its Meaning in Natan Zach's on; only toward the middle or end of this overarching plot does the confronta- tion with God come, sending him on his mission (Abraham, Jeremiah, Habak- kuk, Job, Y. L. Gordon, D. Frischmann, H. N. Bialik, U. Z. Greenberg, and others). However, in this early poem Zach hints at a revolt against God, although implicitly and without mentioning him, and at a rejection of any mission even before the author has built for his "prophetic" speaker scenes of revelation and designation for a mission (that will come later in Zach's poetry). Zach's speaker appears to declare, in updated language: If you intend to reveal yourself to me, to choose me, to turn me into your emissary in the spirit of the traditional biblical prophetic dedication and in the prophetic mode of modem Hebrew poetry, I am not the right person. I say this after having thought deeply about your teaching and your precepts. The chosen one usually refuses when he finds out about his calling. In Zach's case, the speaker apparently has an awareness of being chosen, but after contemplating reality and the writings, he hastens to send to the possible "dis- patcher" an implied refusal, as displayed in the first stanza of the poem "Don't Hold It against Me": mx?nP?~/'nt n?;~~iDRU ~~ /.I-9j~j? -Ir N "MIM /liiW? n~i '9 Mt?Mn ?x Don't hold it against me / I have followed your deeds. / Thirty-two years below your skies / suffice an astute man / to discern the measure of your mercy.36 It is humanity' s fate to be born unto trouble to a life as short as that of grass, of flesh devoid of solace, to gaze at his tormentors flying upward with eyes full of longing, knowing that the end is certain death-all these thoughts are expressed in biblical verses, and the poet's only personal input is the way that they are formed into lines.37 The result is that the reader does not get the impression that the text wishes to convey a personal emotional experience, in the form of the Romantic "poetry of experience." This is a thoughtful, pessimistic poem that does not reflect an authentic autobiographical experience of death. The syntactical- rhythmic design lends a personal note to the words, but according to Zach's repeated demand that poetry be based on personal experience and that its rhythmi- cal structure be appropriate to that experience, we become aware that in his early 36.

There it transpires that the "astute" speaker is unreliable. 37. This poem may remind the reader-in spite of profound essential differences in the situ- ation, purpose, and diction-of the end of Bialik's poem "Davar" (Word): "Why should we fear death-when his angel rides our neck/ and has his bit in our mouth;/ and with a cry of resurrection on our lips and the cheers of clowns/ we'll hop into our graves." The hidden similarity between the two poems goes beyond the overt theme of man's confrontation with his death to the reader's ability to identify in the situation, revealed throughout the text, an unreliable speaker(s) expressing irre- levant consolation to someone who no longer believes in them (Shoham, Kol u-dyokan, 158-62). 165</page><page sequence="20">Reuven Shoham poetry, Zach portrays the experience of death as a nonpersonal event that can be viewed from various angles. The many viewpoints that the reader can map out here also create rhetoric, distancing the reader from the autobiographical experi- ence and focusing on that of humankind, on the meaning of human life under God's sky in the shadow of death.
