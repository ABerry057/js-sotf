Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press, 2003. x, 265 pp. Comparative analysis, especially in the field of religious studies, is widely recognized as among the most difficult of intellectual tasks. How does one do jus- tice to the complexity of both subjects? How does one set the terms of the com- parison in a way that accurately captures both similarities and differences? How does one place those similarities and differences in a broader context so that their significance comes to the fore? And how does one present both halves of the com- parison in a way that will be equally accessible to readers presumed to be familiar with only one or the other? These challenges are still more formidable when the subjects being compared are "Jewish bioethics" and "Catholic bioethics," each of which draws on a long ethical tradition, encompasses a wide range of views, and continues to evolve. Given the complexity of the task, it is especially gratifying to read Aaron Mackler's comparative study of Jewish and Catholic bioethics. Mackler, a promi- nent Jewish ethicist teaching in a Catholic institution (Duquesne University), is ideally situated to undertake this project and he succeeds admirably. Among its many merits, this book is extremely well researched, clearly written, and, given the limitations of its scope, surprisingly comprehensive. At every point, Mackler demonstrates the breadth of his learning, his sensitivity to the spectrum of views within each tradition, and his willingness to draw carefully nuanced conclusions about both the (largely) shared values and the (partially) divergent views that char- acterize contemporary Jewish and Catholic bioethics. The structure of the book is straightforward: an introduction devoted to shared values of the two traditions, two chapters on methodology in Catholic and Jewish ethics, comparative analyses of five key issues (euthanasia, end-of-life treatment, abortion, in vitro fertilization, and access to health care), plus a con- clusion devoted to points of convergence and divergence between the traditions. Mackler's treatment of access to health care and rationing is especially helpful, since these issues remain high on the public policy agenda yet often receive scant attention in the scholarly literature. The clarity of Mackler's presentation, togeth- er with the very extensive bibliography and index, will make this book an ideal text for introductory courses in comparative religious ethics. Indeed, the only other roughly comparable volume would be Edmund Pellegrino and Alan Faden's Jew- ish and Catholic Bioethics (Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press, 1999), and that anthology offers a sampling of key essays, rather than a systematic and cohesive comparison of the two traditions. Mackler's analysis highlights those basic religious and moral values that Jewish and Catholic bioethicists share-concern for human dignity, the value of life, the imitation of God, love of neighbor, divine sovereignty and human stew- ardship of the earth, the value of healing, community, justice, and autonomy- while noting that these receive somewhat different emphases and interpretations among different thinkers within and across the traditions. Mackler also notes that several factors enter into the decision-making process for both Jewish and Catholic bioethicists (reason and experience, scripture and tradition, authoritative teach- 394</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews ing), while carefully delineating the characteristically divergent methods employed (mostly natural law and magisterial teaching for Catholics; mostly halakhah and tradition for Jews). Setting out matters in this way, Mackler is able to demonstrate that there is substantial overlap between the views of Jewish and Catholic bioethi- cists on many issues, though similar views may be justified in somewhat different terms. Moreover, the spectrum of views may overlap, though on some issues (e.g., abortion) Catholic thinkers tend to be more conservative while on others (e.g., eu- thanasia) Jewish thinkers are overall more conservative. For all its merits, Mackler's discussion would benefit from a somewhat sharper distinction between traditional and contemporary views of these issues. By moving rather seamlessly between classical thinkers (e.g., Maimonides or Aqui- nas) and contemporary writers (including both traditionalist and liberal ones), Mackler makes it harder for the reader to discern the radically different method- ological assumptions that underlie many contemporary positions. In addition, Mackler overlooks the distinctive contributions of feminists to these discussions, which, though limited, merit special recognition. His overview of contemporary Jewish movements and their views also inexplicably overlooks Reconstructionism. More significantly, Mackler might have deepened his analysis of these two traditions by focusing more explicitly on the theological categories that they share (creation, revelation, and redemption, perhaps) as well as those that figure more prominently in one tradition or the other (grace for Catholics; mitzvah for Jews). Mackler touches on these matters in his conclusion, but one senses that a more thorough treatment of these theological perspectives would help explain the tradi- tions' varying attitudes toward nature, technology and the complex dialectic be- tween passive acceptance of God's will for us and active attempts to alter our medical conditions. This might also have helped to explain, rather than merely summarize, the diverse views represented within each tradition. But these shortcomings do not detract significantly from the value of the book. This is complex terrain indeed, and Mackler here proves himself a very con- scientious and trustworthy guide. In providing us such a well-conceived and care- fully researched introduction to this material, he enables us to appreciate both the ways in which these two religious traditions of bioethics complement one another and the ways in which both together can contribute to the broader societal discus- sion of these issues.
