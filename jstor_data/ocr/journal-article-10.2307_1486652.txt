<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN ESCHATOLOGICAL DRAMA: BAVLI AVODAH ZARAH 2a-3b by JEFFREY L. RUBENSTEIN The homily near the beginning of Tractate Avodah Zarah of the Babylonian Talmud, folios 2a-3b, surely must be numbered among the most fascinating rabbinic compositions. A brilliant creation of the rabbinic imagination, the homily depicts the inauguration of the "world to come." A richly detailed eschatological drama unfolds as God places a Torah scroll in his lap and summons those who busied themselves with Torah to collect their reward. While rabbinic literature teems with static descriptions of the glorious miracles that await the righteous in the next world and parallel illustrations of the painful sufferings the wicked should expect, extended narratives of the initial stages of the process are rare. Not the nature of the world to come, but the test for admission is the subject at hand. Scholars have been intrigued more by the form of the homily than its content, more by the typical talmudic features than the vivid eschatological scene.' In classic talmudic style the homily meanders over three pages, repeatedly interrupted by later comments, glosses, and observations. At the slightest provocation the Talmud finds grounds to object, happily proceeds to 1. A. Hilvitz, "Le-harkavah shel derashat ha'aggada be-resh masekhet 'avodah zarah," Sinai 80 (1977): 119-140; R.

RUBENSTEIN sort out the difficulty, and then abruptly returns to the narrative flow. Con- tradictory theological positions are constantly imported from other talmudic passages. The Talmud does not so much pause for orderly scrutiny after each stage of the drama as bubble over with chaotic enthusiasm, interpolating a brief interjection or extended digression at every opportunity. Of course this discursive form characterizes talmudic legal debates, which routinely depart from the main issue to take up minor tangents, call upon contradictory sources or parallel talmudic passages, and graft later strata of commentary upon the interchanges of earlier authorities. While the texture of the passage is therefore familiar, the application of standard legal procedure to a narrative, homiletic source, though hardly unprecedented, is rarely developed to this extent. The interpolations, moreover, are mostly Aramaic, while the homily appears in Hebrew, so the two can be separated easily.2 The passage thus presents a paradigmatic example of the multi-tiered talmudic style in aggadic material. To a certain extent, then, study of the noteworthy form has preempted analysis of the content itself. But there is more to it than this. The escha- tological vision is triumphalist and particularistic. The nations of the world receive no portion in the world to come. Since they have not fulfilled the Torah in this world, God rejects them in the next. In the final scene God laughs at their failure in a mocking, derisive manner. Such themes do not sit well with those interested in depicting rabbinic theology in an enlightened, universalistic, and noble manner. It is not surprising that the standard works on rabbinic theology conveniently omit mention of the homily in discussions of eschatology or gentiles. George Foot Moore devotes a large chapter of his classic work on Judaism to "The Hereafter: Messianic Expectations," but 2. The version of the midrash in Tanhumna, Shofetintm ?9 (Berlin, 1927), pp. 651-652 (= Tanhumna, Shofetintm ?9, ed. S. Buber [Vilna, 1885], 5:31-32) already removes the Aramaic additions, although some would claim that the Tanhumna preserves the homily from another source. In any case, Israel ibn Al-Nakawa, Menorat ha-Ma'or, ed. H.G. Enelow (New York: Bloch, 1929), 3:212, who clearly knew the Bavli version, removed the additions. Hilvitz, "Le-harkava," also separates the "talmudic expansions" from the "original version." However, while excising the Aramaic, he misleadingly includes the Hebrew midrashim grafted from elsewhere in his "original version." See, e.g., p. 15. A. Mishcon, the translator of the tractate in the Soncino series, accurately marks off the additions with parentheses ('Abodah Zarah [London: Soncino Press, 1935], pp. 2-8). Isaac Hirsch Weiss, Davar 'al 'odot ha-talmud 'int yakhol hu letargent kol sorkho (Pressburg, 1885), an essay devoted to the difficulties of translating the multi-tiered talmudic style in an intelligible manner, presents our homily among his examples. Hirsch separates the glosses and prints them in the margins in different type.</page><page sequence="3">AN ESCHATOLOGICAL DRAMA 3 neglects the expectations of our homily.3 Loewe, in his introductory essay to A Rabbinic Anthology, briefly alludes to our homilist's negative view of the Romans, but passes over their eschatological fate.4 Nor do the chapters on "The Life to Come" and "The Gentiles" contain any hint.5 Neither Urbach nor Schechter mentions the homily at all.6 Such aversion is unfortunate. Removing the later accretions uncovers a beautifully organized, skillfully woven drama.7 A spectrum of literary techniques produces a tight structure and internal resonances that help convey the message of the homily. The homily combines irony, humor, and satire in a masterful fashion. In addition to these aesthetic qualities, the particularistic vision is interesting in its own right, and provides one voice among the pluralistic and unsystematic rabbinic theologies. Of special interest is the motif of the sukka, which plays an important role in the drama and sparked theological reflection in later sources about the meaning of the festival of Sukkot.8 This essay comprises a literary analysis and close reading of the homily. After presenting a translation, the first section examines the structure and literary features. The next part probes the biblical verses that provide the framework for the drama. The main section provides a close reading of the homily which explores the meaning and relates the structure to the content. 3.

RUBENSTEIN The final section attempts to go beyond the literary analysis to determine what can be said of the Sitz im Leben of the homily. One of the main problems in the study of homiletical midrashim-and midrash in general-is the lack of context. While some homilies have been assembled in the Pesiqta'ot and other collections organized according to the cycle of festivals and special Sabbaths, others, such as our case, were incorporated into the Babylonian Talmud and similar documents, and have retained little evidence of their provenance. The lack of context makes it difficult to correlate the themes and motifs with any wider background and impedes full understanding of the homilies. Although it cannot be proved conclusively, there is good reason to believe that our homily was delivered on the festival of Sukkot, a determination which allows for a greater appreciation of its message. The internal literary analysis and the assignment to Sukkot, based primarily on external considerations, shed light upon each other, and together enhance our understanding of the homily, the festival, and eschatological thought. The Homily9 R. Hanina bar Papa, and some say R. Simlai,'o expounded (darash): In the world to come, the Holy One, blessed be He, will bring a Torah scroll and set it in his lap, and say: "Let everyone who busied himself with this come and take his reward." Straightaway all the nations of the world assemble and come [before God] in confusion, as it says, All the nations assemble as one (Isa 43:9). God says to them: "Do not enter before me in confusion. Rather the nations should enter one by one, together with their scribes," as it says, The peoples gather (Isa 43:9),1 and people means a kingdom, as it says, One people shall be mightier than the other (Gen 25:23). Straightaway the Kingdom of Rome enters first. The Holy One, blessed be He, says to them: "With what have you busied yourselves in this world?"12 They say to him: "Master of the universe.

Let Nebuchadnezzar come and testify for Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah that they never bowed to the idol.

He says to them, "Complete idiots! He who prepared on the eve of the Sabbath will eat on the Sabbath. But he who did not prepare on the eve of the Sabbath, how will he eat on the Sabbath?

And the Holy One, blessed be He, sits and laughs, as it says, He who sits in heaven laughs (Ps 2:4). Structure and Literary Devices In order to interpret the homily and appreciate its message fully, it is necessary to dissect the structure and analyze the literary features and poetics. The Talmud begins our narrative with the standard formula that introduces a homily (derasha): "Rabbi So-and-so expounded (darash)." The composition must therefore be understood as an exegesis of Scripture, not as a free-flowing 16. Lit., "As surely as I have established My covenant with day and night-the laws of heaven and earth-so I will never reject the offspring of Jacob and My servant David." The midrash turns the verse on its head: God only created the world for the sake of the Torah, his covenant with his people. 17. So MS JTS and MS Paris ('avera). In MS M: 'erva-sexual immorality. 18. So MSS JTS and M. MS Paris adds: "This [those proved righteous] refers to Israel."</page><page sequence="7">AN ESCHATOLOGICAL DRAMA 7 legend or folktale. While the homilist brings numerous verses into play, his primary text is Isa 43:9, the first verse he cites, and to which he returns no less than five times. He links various stages of the drama to clauses of the verse, thereby creating a framework for the action and simultaneously allowing for the development of an imaginative saga, quite free from the scriptural base. After exhausting the clauses of Isa 43:9 he shifts to Ps 2:3-4 as the text for the final stages of the drama. Other verses cited serve as prooftexts for arguments made by participants in the drama, not as bases for stages of the drama itself." Thus miscellaneous verses comprise the dialogue between the parties, while Isa 43:9 and Ps 2:3-4 govern the course of the action.20 In this way the clauses of the expounded texts provide the primary elements of structure. The scriptural citations provide but part of the structure, for several stages of the drama lack connection to clauses of the expounded texts. Additional structure is created by a number of techniques that complement the exposition of the verse. Chief among these is the repetition of units of three.21 There are three major scenes: the initial trial of the nations, their objections to God's justice, and their failure to observe the commandment of sukka. Both Rome and Persia cite three of their accomplishments: marketplaces, bath-houses, and money for the Romans; bridges, cities, and war for the Persians. In his rejection of their claims, God repeats this threefold litany. Three national gatherings approach God: the Romans, the Persians, and then the rest of the nations, although only the encounters of the Romans and Persians are fleshed out.22 19. However, the homilist himself cites Gen 25:23 to prove that "people" refers to a kingdom and Deut 4:44 to prove that "this" refers to Torah. 20. God cites a clause from Isa 43:9 in his response to the first question of the nations (did we ever accept the Torah and not fulfill it?). 21. This was noted by Heinemann, Derashot, p. 68. On threefold structures, see L. Ginzberg, Ginze Shechter, vol. 1 (New York, 1927), p. 24, who notes, "three examples of this matter are brought in the passage, as is typical of the aggada and the halakha." Shamma Friedman, "Some Structural Patterns of Talmudic Sugiot," Proceedings of the Sixth World Congress of Jewish Studies, vol. 3 (Jerusalem, 1975), pp. 391-396 (Hebrew), demonstrates that units of three characterize numerous sugyot in the Babylonian Talmud. See too Friedman, "Pereq ha'ishah raba ba-bavli," Mehqarim u-Meqorot, ed. H. Dimitrovksi (Jerusalem, 1977), pp. 316-319, and the references there. 22. The brief sentence, "The same thing [occurs] with each and every nation," which I have labeled A2' in the outline below, echoes the initial confused gathering of nations, A'.</page><page sequence="8">8 JEFFREY L. RUBENSTEIN Units of three recur in the second section, the extended dialogue between the nations and God. The nations put forward three arguments: (1) We were never offered the Torah, (2) Israel never fulfilled it, (3) Give us the Torah now so that we can fulfill it. The second argument itself includes three stages. First God prepares to testify for Israel, then Heaven and Earth, and finally the nations themselves. Six times-twice three-God commands representatives of various biblical nations to appear and testify concerning Israelite heroes or the entire people. The final section also includes a triplet: God enjoins the nations to build sukkot, causes the sun to blaze upon them, and laughs at their folly. A third element of structure devolves from the repeated use of particular verbs. The roots "come" (bw') and "enter" (kns), and their counterparts, "go" (hlk) and "depart" (ys') occur regularly, and signal a shift from one stage of the drama to the next. At the outset God invites the nations to come and receive their reward.23 They come in confusion, whereupon God commands that they enter in an orderly manner. The Romans enter first. They depart dejectedly and the Persians enter. They too depart. In the next section God invites Heaven and Earth to come and testify, and then commands the nations to come themselves. Six times the representatives of the nations should come and testify. Toward the end, God tells the nations to build a sukka, and orders that they go and do so. Whereas at the beginning of the drama God summoned the nations to come before him, he now dismisses them from his presence. Unable to stand the heat, the nations kick their sukkot and depart, the familiar verb calling to mind their earlier departure in dejection. The coming, going, entering, and departing move the narrative along, making the audience aware that one scene has ended and the next is beginning. Recall that the entire drama takes place in the world to come, and the focus on who enters and who leaves is quite to the point. Here structure and content intersect; the markers of stages in the drama converge with the themes the homilist seeks to emphasize. A second set of recurring verbs includes "give" (ntn), "receive" (qbl) "fulfill" (qym), and "make, do" ('sh). God rebukes the Romans and Persians that what they made only served their own interests. The nations object that they never received the Torah and therefore did not fulfill it, then that Israel, who did receive the Torah, never fulfilled it. Various parties are called to 23. In the Bible bw' is sometimes a technical term meaning "come for judgment." See Ps 143:2, Job 9:32, 22:4.</page><page sequence="9">AN ESCHATOLOGICAL DRAMA 9 testify that Israel did fulfill the Torah. The Isaian prooftext for the testimony reads that they "give witness." At this point the nations beseech God to give them the Torah now so that they may do it. God then orders them to make a sukka, and each makes one on the top of his roof. The making of the sukka recalls God's accusation that they "made" the bridges and markets for their own needs. It creates a parallel between the two events, and invites the audience to compare and contrast them. Below we consider the implications in greater detail. Finally, the repetition of adverbs and interrogative particles lends the composition greater coherence. Many of the scenes are introduced with the adverb "straightaway" (miyyad), which conveys a sense of urgency and almost frantic action. It encourages the audience to make connections between the actions introduced by the adverb. At the outset, "straightaway" the nations enter to collect their reward; at the conclusion, "straightaway" they kick their sukkot and leave. This macro inclusio both contrasts the beginning scene with the denouement and gives the composition coherence. The interrogative particle kelum, which does not translate, introduces most of the questions. God rhetorically asks the Romans and Persians, "Are there none (kelum yesh) among you who speak this?" Later they innocently ask God, "Did we ever (kelum qibbalnuha) accept [the Torah]" and then rhetorically question God's proposed witnesses, "Can a (kelum yesh) father testify ... ?" As we shall see, this parallel interrogative form coheres nicely with the course of the drama. This analysis of the literary devices and structural techniques suggests the following structure: I. God Judges the Nations A. In the world to come, God brings a Torah and says, "Let everyone who busied himself with this come and take his reward" A'.

Isaiah 43:9, the primary text of the homily,</page><page sequence="12">12 JEFFREY L. RUBENSTEIN initiates a prophetic discourse known as a "trial speech."24 The nations and their gods confront Israel and her God in a type of hypothetical trial. Each side brings arguments that they worship the true god. Inevitably the prophet proves Israel's case with irrefutable arguments, demonstrating the falsehood of the opposing claim. [43:9] All the nations assemble as one, the peoples gather. Who among them declared this, foretold to us the things that have happened? Let them give their testimony and be vindicated, That they may say, "It is true." [43:10] My witnesses are you, declares the Lord, My servant whom I have chosen. To the end that you25 may take thought and believe in Me, And understand that I am He: Before Me no god was formed, and after Me no one shall exist- [43:11] None but Me, the Lord. Beside Me, none can grant triumph. [43:12] I alone foretold the deliverance and I brought it to pass; I announced it, and no strange God was among you. So you are my witnesses, declares the Lord, and I am God. The nations gather together for the trial. They are challenged to provide evidence that their gods accurately foretold "this," presumably the imminent redemption of Israel, or other "things that have happened" in the past. The prophet invites them to bring witnesses as to the ability of their priests to foretell the future and the divinity of their gods. The implication, of course, is that they cannot. While the nations have no witnesses, God designates Israel as his. Israel knew of the "deliverance," the redemption from Egypt, which had been foretold -by God and subsequently occurred. By Israel's testimony the prophet establishes the reality, power, and supremacy of his God. 24. See Claus Westermann, Isaiah 40-66: A Conmnzentary, trans. D. Stalker (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1969); idem, Forschung anm Alten Testament (Munich: Chr. Kaiser Verlag, 1964), pp. 135-144; idem, Old Testament Form Criticism, ed. John H. Hayes (San Antonio: Trinity University Press, 1974), pp. 165-167; J. Begrich, Studiunm zu Deuterojesaja (Munich, 1920), pp. 26-48. 25. Most scholars suggest that "you" should be emended to "they." See John L. McKenzie, Second Isaiah, Anchor Bible 20 (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1968), p. 52, and see the note in the New JPS translation.</page><page sequence="13">AN ESCHATOLOGICAL DRAMA 13 The reading "they" at the end of verse 9 is problematic, for it seems that the nations must prove to themselves. Westermann therefore translates reading "we" for "they": the nations must bring us (= Israel) proof that their gods are real.26 On the other hand, in the following verse the reading "you" (to the end that you may take thought) is difficult, and most scholars emend "they (= the nations)." For if Israel supplies the witnesses, it cannot be the audience as well. The rabbis, of course, could not emend in this manner, and retained the received text. As we shall see, the homilist plays upon this confusion of who testifies for whom, upon the different ways of interpreting the scene.27 This passage shares standard features with other trial scenes, in which the nations assemble for a trial and are invited to state their case.28 But not once does the Bible make known their claims. In the prophetic view, of course, they have nothing to say, since their gods do not exist. Some trial scenes are followed directly by a series of rhetorical questions about what the pagan gods ever foretold or did; the absence of a response proves the falsity of their beliefs. The scenes always proceed directly to prove Israel's case by detailing the events that God foretold and the miraculous events wrought by God. Our text is particularly dramatic in that Israel herself takes center stage as a witness to report God's miracles. The biblical neglect of the arguments of the nations is the homilist's point of departure. He fills in the gaps in the text, imagining how a full transcript of the trial would read. 26. Westermann, Isaiah 40-66, p. 120. D. Karl Marti, Das Buch Jesaja (Tilbingen: J. C. B. Mohr, 1900), pp. 297-298, suggests that the subject switches from the nations to their witnesses: "Let them (the nations) bring their witnesses and be justified, and they (the witnesses) may say, 'So it is.' " 27. Note that the talmudic sugya immediately preceding the homily, bAZ 2a, contemplates different interpretations of this clause ("let them give their witnesses .. .") and various identifications of the witnesses. 28. Cf. Isa 41:21-29: "Submit your case, says the Lord; Offer your pleas, says the King of Jacob. Let them approach and tell us what will happen. Tell us what has occurred, or announce what will occur, that we may know the outcome . . ." Isa 41:1-5: "Stand silent before Me, coastlands, and let nations renew their strength. Let them approach to state their case; let us come forward together for argument. Who has roused a victory from the East, summoned him to His service? [Who] has delivered up nations to him, and trodden sovereigns down?"

RUBENSTEIN The verses from Psalms 2 derive from a related biblical scene. The setting is not a trial scene but a battle.29 Nations assemble not to debate with Israel but to destroy her: [1] Why do nations assemble, and peoples plot vain things. [2] Kings of the earth take their stand, and regents intrigue together against the Lord and against his anointed? [3] "Let us break the cords of their yokes, shake off their ropes from us!" [4] He who sits enthroned in heaven laughs; the Lord mocks at them. [5] Then He speaks to them in anger, terrifying them in His rage. "But I have installed my king on Zion, My holy mountain!" [6] Let me tell of the decree; the Lord said to me, "You are My son, I have fathered you this day." Most scholars suggest that the psalm originally served as a liturgy at the inauguration ceremony of the Israelite king or at its annual reenactment.30 In the cyclical, mythic view of time, the nations periodically revolt against God and his elected monarch. To "break the cords" and "shake off ropes" express the motif of a subject's rebellion against his lord. God reacts first by mocking their futile efforts, and then with rebuke and frightful anger. He proclaims that he has selected the Israelite king, while the king happily announces that God has called him "son." The rest of the psalm warns the nations of the consequences of rebellion and of the awesome power of God. For the biblical authors, the trial and rebellion scenes demonstrate the incontrovertible reality, power, and sovereignty of God and the grounds for confidence in their leader. With his midrashic approach to the Bible, the homilist links Ps 2 and Isa 43:9-15, reading the two texts in light of each other. Both Ps 2:1-2 and Isa 43:9 use the terms "nations" (le'ummim) and "peoples" (goyim), and both depict a gathering, so the intertextual signals are strong. The homilist expounds Isa 43:9 for the action of the trial and Ps 2:3-4 for the nations' 29. In technical terminology, the scene is a Vilkerkamnpf See Gunther Wainke, Die Zionsthe- ologie der Korachiten, BZAW 97 (Berlin: Alfred Tipelmann, 1966), pp. 74-92; R. J.

Yet the courtroom setting and debate draw as much inspiration from Ps 2 as from the Isaian trial scene. In the prophetic discourse the nations do not act or argue. The homilist takes from Ps 2 the notion that the nations articulate their claims and take action. The prophetic challenge to "declare this" is taken up in Psalms, where the nations "plot" (yehggu), literally "speak," vain things. And the word for "assemble" in Psalms (ragshu) has the sense of gathering with schemes and plots, as in the Aramaic cognate in Dan 6:7 and 6:16.31 The homilist fills in the missing trial speeches of the prophet by drawing on the aggressive conduct described in the psalm. While the drama of the homily bears some affinities to the confrontation scenes of the Bible, the transformation of certain elements underscores the distance between biblical and rabbinic concerns. The issue at the Isaian trial is the true Lord, whether the God of Israel or the gods of the nations, and the proof seems to be illustrated both for Israel and for the nations. For the rabbinic homilist this is no longer the issue. When God ushers in the world to come, his reality cannot be doubted. The nations do not come to demonstrate the power of their gods,-but to present their merits before the God of Israel. Moreover, the homilist considers it inconceivable that the nations even contemplate a rebellion. They acknowledge God's sovereignty and at best hope to convince him that they deserve a reward. Their proclamation to "break the cords" no longer expresses a revolt against God, but rather the inability to observe the precept they tried to fulfill. The crucial turn is the shift in who serves as witness for whom. In the Bible God appoints Israel as witnesses that he is the true God. They bring testimony that God is trustworthy and faithful, that he foretold that which subsequently happened. In the homily God serves as a witness that Israel was a faithful people, fulfilling what it accepted upon itself. Ironically Israel, far short of serving as the star witness, plays no active role in the drama. While in the Bible the nations are called to bring testimony of the power of their gods but cannot, in the homily the nations are forced to testify that Israel fulfilled the Torah, and do so. 31. In the form hargishu. There Darius's ministers conspire to charge Daniel with violating the law, much as the nations accuse Israel in the homily. (Ragshu is translated "assemble" in the New JPS; "be in an uproar" in the old JPS. See the standard biblical dictionaries.)</page><page sequence="16">16 JEFFREY L. RUBENSTEIN The Meaning and Message At this point we are better prepared to focus on the homily itself. The aggada is attributed to R. Hanina b. Papa, a third-generation Palestinian amora, or R. Simlai, of the second generation." If the attributions can be trusted, we are dealing with a third-century creation. The homily launches abruptly into a description of the advent of the world to come. Conspicuously absent are preparatory eschatological events: apocalyptic signs in the heavens, battles of the world powers, the appearance of the Messiah or reconfigurations of the earth. Perhaps these occurred in a "messianic era" prior to the "world to come"; in any case, they are not the interest of our homilist. He announces with great confidence that the world to come begins with God placing a scroll of the Torah in his lap and inviting those that "busied themselves with this" to come forth and collect their reward. Quintessential rabbinic utopia: Torah and Torah alone earns entry to the world to come. The mood is not one of terror and awe, as might be expected on Judgment Day, but of serenity and calm. The image of a Torah scroll in God's lap or "bosom," as heq would literally translate, evokes an almost feminine sense of mother with child, of love and intimacy.33 Such a placid scene conflicts with the urgency of the event at hand; those who fail are denied an eternal reward, and perhaps should expect divine punishment. Clearly the point of the homily is not to terrify the audience into greater observance with ominous warnings of their fate in the hereafter. Eager to collect the reward, all nations crowd before God. The mood sud- denly shifts from the serenity and order of the divine proclamation to hurried action and confusion. The nations respond immediately; "straightaway" they desist from their this-worldly enterprises and enter the divine arena. Here the homilist links his description to the text and reveals the fact that he is expounding Scripture. He expounds the phrase "the nations assemble as one" to mean that they all mix together in one indiscriminate mass. The second clause of the verse describes a reorganization of the initial assembly, this time with each nation grouped independently. Between the two stages the homilist supplies a divine rebuke at the disorderly assembly. God commands that each nation appear in orderly fashion together with its scribes. The initial 32. The JTS manuscript has R. Shela, probably a corruption of R. Simlai. 33. Rabbis are routinely described as carrying a Torah scroll in their bosom. See e.g. bAZ 18a, bSuk 41b, and mSot 7:7.</page><page sequence="17">AN ESCHATOLOGICAL DRAMA 17 confusion in the ranks of the nations hints that they are ill-prepared for what is to follow, and that the reorganization will prove ephemeral. That God orders each to bring its "scribes" contains a similar hint. Essential to the proper functioning of the court, scribes record the proceedings and ensure that no evidence is neglected. The scribes of each nation presumably bring the record of its meritorious deeds. Yet the term soferim, "scribes," also refers to the precursors of the rabbis, "the early scholars who were called soferim because they counted the letters of the Torah,"34 and in a wider sense to all sages. They are the true class who "busied themselves with Torah," and it is self-evident that the nations have no such scribes to bring them merit. The prooftext from Gen 25:23 that the term "people" in Isa 43:9 refers to a "kingdom" contains another hint of what is to come. Since Gen 25:23 uses the same term, le'om, as Isa 43:9, it is not clear at first what the prooftext accomplishes. By rabbinic convention, however, the "two peoples" in God's prophecy to Rebecca refer to the descendants of Jacob and Esau, Israel and Edom, identified with Rome. The le 'om of Gen 25 thus triggers the association of Israel and Rome, two national entities, and indicates that the nations divide into sovereign groups.3 But the resonances of the prooftext are much deeper. The prophecy relates to the struggle between Jacob and Esau, between Israel and Rome, and promises that one side "would be mightier than the other." The second half of the verse continues that "the older shall serve the younger." So Rome will serve Israel-but when? For centuries Israel had served its Roman masters, and nothing indicated that the situation was likely to change anytime soon. By the third century there was not even much of a struggle; the last Jewish revolt, under Bar Kochba, over a century before, had been disastrous. The homilist foresees the fulfillment of the prophecy in eschatological times, in the very drama he narrates. At that time the Romans claim they did everything in this world so that Israel could busy itself with Torah; they pretend to have served Israel. The real struggle occurs, then, not as a military confrontation between kingdoms, but as a courtroom action in which the Romans and other nations indict Israel. And then the prophecy will be fulfilled as Israel triumphs over the nations. At this point in the 34. bQid 30a. 35. The glossator adds in Aramaic, "and we translate [in the Targum] One kingdom will be stronger than the other," to clarify the sense of the prooftext. This does a disservice to the homily, for the allusion to the Targum diverts attention from the allusion to the struggle between Rome and Israel, which is the main theme.</page><page sequence="18">18 JEFFREY L. RUBENSTEIN narrative, however, the audience does not yet know how the drama will end. The allusion to the unfulfilled prophecy creates tension and expectations. As the drama unfolds, the tension is progressively resolved and the audience is reassured that God's prophecy will come true. The stage set, the preliminaries concluded, the court in session, Rome enters first (sec. I B). Rulers of a massive empire and the mightiest nation on earth, they might well expect commensurate status in the world to come. God now asks them directly with what they have "busied themselves" in this world. Yet the Romans know that God has established the Torah as the sole criterion for reward, and it is Israel, not Rome, that has fulfilled the Torah. They can neither dispute the divinely ordained measure nor claim to have occupied themselves with Torah, so they fall back on a convoluted argument. Proudly listing their accomplishments-marketplaces, bath-houses, silver and gold-they suggest that they engaged in these enterprises in order that Israel could busy herself with Torah. They claim to have provided the institutional framework necessary for society to function and the material support required for study. As a result of Rome's achievements, Israel was able to purchase her food, clothing, and other material goods in the markets, and did not have to spend time and energy to procure them. Rome also built the bath-houses that civilized people require. In essence they argue for vicarious merit, and so lose the case from the outset. God dispenses the argument with a summary judgment. Marketplaces harbor prostitutes, and bath-houses cater to the self-indulgent. Rome's true motives emerge: this-worldly pleasures-sexual gratification, pampering the body, money to pay for such delights. God rejects the achievements of gold and silver, declaring that he ultimately controls prosperity, and therefore Rome's fortunes confer no merit. Rome dedicated itself not to Torah but to self-interest, and so its preeminent status in this world means nothing in the next. Note that the depiction of God has already turned to that of an imposing, terrifying judge. God first invited the nations, then mildly rebuked them, and now insults them as "complete idiots." After rejecting the Romans' roundabout claim, God focuses on their lack of Torah. With a rhetorical question, God half-inquires and half-decrees that none of the Romans "speak this." Here the homilist cites the next clause of his verse as prooftext, "Who among them speaks this." Isaiah challenged the nations to prove that their gods had foretold "this," this miracle, the imminent return from exile. For the homilist, however, "this" refers not to an earlier</page><page sequence="19">AN ESCHATOLOGICAL DRAMA 19 prophecy but to Torah, and the challenge is whether the Romans can claim observance of Torah as the basis for their reward. He takes a minor liberty with the biblical text by changing the original third-person "who among them" to "who among you" in order to frame a direct dialogue.36 The homilist proves that "this" refers to Torah from Deut 4:44, "This is the Torah that Moses set before the children of Israel." Beyond the elegant Deuteronomic prooftext, the demonstrative pronoun "this" echoes both God's initial invitation to those who have occupied themselves "with this" to collect their reward and the direct question to the Romans about their activities in "this" world. "This" Torah should have been fulfilled in "this" world. "Straightaway" they entered, and "straightaway" the Romans leave dejectedly. As the Romans leave the Persians enter, equally eager to collect their reward. The homilist refers to the Sasanian Babylonians, whose empire spread over the other half of the civilized world.37 While the Jews of Palestine lived in Roman territory, the Babylonian Jewish communities lived under Sasanian hegemony. For centuries the two empires struggled for control of the known world. During the third century, when our homilist lived, the Romans and "Persians" fought major battles in 231-33, 253-260, and again in 283-284.38 Masters of a vast empire, the Persians also anticipate commensurate status in the world to come. They cannot, any more than the Romans, claim to have fulfilled the Torah, and so argue for vicarious reward on the basis of the bridges they built, the cities conquered and the wars fought. God dismisses their claims with disdain, emphasizing again that their pursuits were self-serving. Bridges supply them with tolls, and conquered cities with forced labor. They use their military power to gain worldly riches. Their success in battle merits no reward, for God determines the outcome of wars. Again the homilist emphasizes that superficial signs of divine favor-silver, gold, and military triumphs-prove nothing about the true merit of those who possess them. Neither the Roman pursuit of pleasure nor the Persian obsession with power deserves reward. The Persians, too, do not speak "this," and "straightaway" depart empty-handed. The same outcome, the homilist assures us, awaits the other nations. 36. Assuming the homilist's text matched the Masoretic text here. 37. "Persian" in the Babylonian Talmud refers to the contemporary Babylonians. See I. Gafni, The Jews of Babylonia in the Talmudic Era (Jerusalem: Zalman Shazar Center, 1990), p. 156 (Hebrew). 38. The Sasanians heavily defeated the Romans in 260 C.E. If the homilist lived at this time, it explains why he attributed claims of military prowess to the "Persians," not the Romans.</page><page sequence="20">20 JEFFREY L. RUBENSTEIN The next scene (II) reveals a shift in tactics. The nations no longer claim to have fulfilled the Torah in the past, but question the fairness of the standard. True, they never observed the Torah, but they never accepted it either, so the criterion for reward is unfair. God rejects this approach by charging that the nations received the seven Noahide commandments and failed to fulfill them. The homilist ingeniously returns to the next clause of Isa 43:9 as prooftext. "Let us hear of the things that have happened," the prophetic challenge to the nations to announce previous events their gods foretold, becomes an indictment of their behavior. The nations cannot speak of the things they accepted in the past, the ancient Noahide code, because they did not obey those commandments. Note that the homily marks the new scene and shift of tactics with a reversal of roles. The nations now make the accusations and ask the questions, while God, who just before this appeared as indomitable judge, responds. An echo of God's question to the nations, with the interrogative particle kelum, resounds in the nations' probing of God and its parallel form. The best defense is a good offense. The nations somehow become the judge of the fairness of God's standards, and God, at least temporarily, allows himself to be relegated to defendant. For a moment the homilist permits the nations the delusion that they stand on a par with God and may question him as equals. This reversal and the cross-examination of God contribute to the rapid movement of the homily and add to the atmosphere of a trial.39 The shift in tactics and role-reversal come to the fore with the next question and response. No longer defending themselves, the nations ask whether Israel ever fulfilled the Torah. This charge seems totally out of place, for the issue is whether the nations deserve a reward or not. From a strictly juridical point of view, the question is completely irrelevant. Whether or not Israel fulfilled the Torah should only affect its reward in the world to come, not that of the nations. Moreover, in the first scene the nations claimed that their building enterprises allowed Israel to fulfill the Torah, and that they deserved vicarious merit on that account. Suddenly to claim that Israel never observed the Torah subverts their initial argument. What vicarious merit can they now claim? The self-contradiction exposes once again the futility of their charges. It signals that the attempt at role-reversal, at posing as judge of God's 39. This reversal bothered the traditional commentators. See the commentary H.iddushei ha-Ge'oninm in 'En Ya'akov (New York, 1980), to AZ 3a, pp. 12b-13a: "These matters require explanation. How can God, who is witness and judge, debate (lefalpel 'asnto) with the nations?" This reaction, of courses, fails to appreciate the satirical and humorous tone.</page><page sequence="21">AN ESCHATOLOGICAL DRAMA 21 justice, is another aspect of their confusion described at the initial gathering. At the same time it points to the homilist's real interest. The trial pertains as much to the merit of Israel as the bankruptcy of the nations. And the vindication of Israel takes place in a most ironic fashion. Without assembling in the multitude, gathering as a nation, or recounting its accomplishments, without even appearing in person, Israel receives a favorable judgment. The homilist builds to this climax with exquisite technique. God answers the nations by testifying that Israel fulfilled the whole Torah. The emphasis on the "Torah in its entirety" contrasts with the inability of the nations to fulfill even the seven Noahide commandments. Here another tactic has been counterproductive and only dug a deeper hole. The nations play their newly found role as judge to the extreme, disqualifying God's testimony. God has called Israel his "firstborn son," and of course the testimony of relatives is inadmissible. Relegated from his role as judge, God even loses credibility as a witness.40 When God summons Heaven and Earth to testify for Israel, the nations again disqualify the witnesses, ruling that they are "interested parties" who owe their existence to Israel's maintaining her covenant with God by fulfilling the Torah. Again the nations do a disservice to their case, for they admit that Israel has a special relationship with God and that the world only exists for the sake of the Torah. The more they argue their own case, the more they emphasize the supremacy of Israel. The disqualification of witnesses proves their ultimate undoing, for God then has no recourse but to summon the nations themselves as witnesses. The reversal takes a full turn, with the nations, who had usurped the position of judge, now forced to testify against themselves. With six hortatory sentences God invokes representatives of biblical peoples to witness that Israel fulfilled the Torah. Originally the nations "came" forward to collect reward; now they are summoned to "come" and justify Israel's claim to reward. The formulaic pattern "Let x testify about y that he did not do z" without interruption or objection, by far the longest speech of the homily, relentlessly hammers home the vindication of Israel. And the culmination, which then deviates from the formula to the general admission that all Israel "fulfilled the entire Torah," echoes God's attempted initial testimony. The homilist arrives at the final clause of his verse: "Let them give their testimony and be vindicated, that 40. The dismissal of God's testimony recalls the famous midrash of the "Oven of Achnai," bBM 59b. The rabbis reject God's testimony that R. Eliezer's opinion is correct on the grounds that the Torah is "not in Heaven."</page><page sequence="22">22 JEFFREY L. RUBENSTEIN they may say, 'It is true."' Where Isaiah summoned the nations to bring witnesses on their own behalf and vindicate their gods, in the homily the nations produce witnesses on behalf of God and vindicate Israel; they confess that what God asserted-that Israel fulfilled the Torah-is true. This turn completes the dramatic inversion of the biblical paradigm in which Israel serves as witness for God. In the rabbinic version of the trial, first God, then the nations, witness that Israel fulfilled the Torah. The characters summoned to testify are chosen primarily for their multi- national profiles: Chaldean (Nimrod), Aramean (Laban), Egyptian (Potiphar's wife), Babylonian (Nebuchadnezzar), Mede (Darius), and a somewhat obscure quartet, clearly brought in for additional cosmopolitan flavor-Temanite, Shuhite, Naamathite, and Buzite.41 A true gathering of nations. Yet the figures were carefully selected. These villains endeavored to prevent biblical heroes from observing the Torah or falsely accused them of sin. Nimrod, according to legend, cast Abraham into a furnace and persecuted him in other ways in order to compel him to worship Nimrod's gods.42 Laban repeatedly changed Jacob's wages and then accused him of stealing the household gods.43 Potiphar's wife attempted to seduce Joseph, then falsely accused him of trying to rape her.44 Nebuchadnezzar, outraged that Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah refused to worship the golden idol, threw them into a blazing furnace.45 After Darius commanded that all prayers be directed to him, he forced Daniel into the lion's den for praying three times each day to God.46 Eliphaz, Bildad, Zophar, and Elihu, Job's four "comforters," charged that his suffering must have been caused by sin, and incessantly harangued him to confess his misdeeds.47 They too falsely accused a biblical hero of transgressing God's law, and thus it is fitting for them to testify that all Israel observed the entire Torah. Laban, Potiphar's wife, and Job's companions are transformed from prosecutors to witnesses for the defense. Obviously the impact of these specific characters 41. The four served as Job's "comforters." Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite appear together in Job 2:11. Elihu ben Barachel the Buzite, their younger colleague, surfaces in Job 32. 42. Pirqe de-Rabi 'Eli'ezer ?26.

Far from having helped Israel to fulfill the Torah, as they initially claim, the nations repeatedly strove to prevent Israel from observing the commandments. Far from not having fulfilled the Torah, as the nations subsequently argue, Israel did so under the most trying circumstances, even at the risk of life itself. And just as these villains falsely accused Jacob, Joseph, and Job of crimes, so the nations' arguments are exposed as baseless. The satirical element of the first scene, the confused appearance of the nations and their "dejected" departure, deepens with the self-incriminating testimony.49 The nations are not only liars and scoundrels, but buffoons. The testimony, moreover, reveals that the nations never fulfilled the Noahide commandments, the second potential basis for reward. The specifics of their testimony that Israel refused to sin reveal that Nimrod, Nebuchad- nezzar, and Darius worshipped idols or false gods, and that Potiphar's wife tried to commit adultery. Both idolatry and sexual immorality violate the Noahide prohibitions.50 Once again, the nations drive a stake through their own collective heart. They confirm God's pronouncement that they never observed even the minimal commandments demanded of them. This testimony essentially serves as a national sidduq ha-din, the "justification of the divine decree" traditionally recited at burials. "We know, God, that your judgment is righteous; you are justified when you speak, and pure when you judge, and it is not for us to question your decrees of judgment," runs the standard formula. Since the nations do question God's justice and protest the divine verdict, God has them justify their own fate. In this world the nations violated the commandments, in the next they rebel against the divine verdict. But in the end they will justify the justness of God. As Isaiah prophesied, they will say "It is true." God is the true judge, the dayyan 'emet.51 48. Maharsha, in his commentary, asks why Balaam, a true prophet of the nations, is not called to witness. Certainly he is precisely the type of "expert witness" whose testimony would be most compelling. But unlike the characters summoned, he never compelled Israel to violate the Torah. 49. Heinemann, Derashot, p. 67 emphasizes the satirical tone. 50. tAZ 8:4. 51. The indictment of the nations hides one ironic twist. In the course of the dialogue the nations twice quote Scripture to disqualify God and then Heaven and Earth from testifying.</page><page sequence="24">24 JEFFREY L. RUBENSTEIN Having failed to demonstrate either their own worthiness or Israel's unworthiness, the nations are reduced to entreat for one more chance. At this point the roles again reverse and return to those of the opening scene. The nations appear as wayward children, pathetic, humiliated, while God returns to the role of the powerful judge. His patience tried long enough, God again insults the "complete idiots" before him and rejects their miserable plea. Only those who observed the Torah in this world, who prepared "on the eve of the Sabbath," enjoy a reward in the world to come. The analogy draws upon the familiar trope of the Sabbath as a "hint of the world to come."52 At the same time, it emphasizes the correspondence between observance of the commandments and entry into the world to come. Preparing for the Sabbath, not the construction of markets and bridges, was the appropriate provision. The last scene (III) completes the role-reversal. Again God initiates the action (A, B, C) and the nations respond (A', B'), as they did at the outset. First the nations came and recounted what they had done, to no avail; now they go and try to do what they neglected, but of course their efforts prove futile. In his infinite mercy, God proposes a "simple" precept to the nations, the commandment of the sukka, ordering them "to go and do it." Clearly the sukka stands for the entire Torah by synechdoche. By observing this one "simple" commandment, the nations can prove their merit and claim a share of the eschatological reward. Of all the commandments that the homilist could have selected as the test for the nations, the choice of the sukka can hardly be serendipitous. Indeed, the sukka represents the complete opposite of the accomplishments of which the nations boasted. Bridges, marketplaces, bath-houses, and cities were the glory of antiquity. Marketplaces with columned promenades and paved streets; bridges that ingenious Roman Whereas at the outset God had accused the nations of not "speaking this," meaning Torah, here the nations proficiently cite the text. Apparently they have learned something of the holy writ. Then again, in rabbinic midrash everybody-and everything-quotes verses: Roman officials, Satan, infants, cows, even the personified days of the week. In other midrashim the "nations of the world" routinely quote Scripture, and perhaps we should understand their unexpected familiarity with Torah in this context. See Y. Heinemann, Darkhe ha-'Aggadah (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1974), pp. 39-43. Moreover, by citing Torah the nations again subvert their own cause. Their mastery of the text and exegetical adroitness compromise the initial defense that they had never received the Torah. 52. bBer 57b; cf. bShab 118a, mTam 7:4.</page><page sequence="25">AN ESCHATOLOGICAL DRAMA 25 engineers extended to dazzling spans;53 bath-houses with marble pools and mosaics, adorned with beautiful statues; cities with amphitheaters, fora, and porticoes-these magnificent structures separated the splendor of Roman civilization from the barbarian world.54 The sukka, on the other hand, is a simple hut, stark, fragile, and commonplace. Isaiah compares the downtrodden state of Israel to the abandoned "sukka in a vineyard," and Amos the breached Davidic kingdom to "a fallen sukka."" Unlike a bridge, bath-house, or marketplace, a sukka can be easily erected and quickly destroyed. It has no aesthetic value. The sukka is the functional as well as the structural opposite of the nations' building enterprises. A sukka does not provide a forum for commercial interactions, like a market, nor facilitate transportation, like a bridge, nor provide facilities for ablutions, like a bath-house. Nor does a sukka allow its builders to harbor prostitutes, collect tolls, levy forced labor, or pamper themselves with hot and cold baths, steamrooms, and saunas. A sukka simply provides a little shelter from the sun or rain. And the festival sukka does not even do that. For during the festival, when one is commanded to dwell in the sukka, he is not out in the fields with no alternative shelter, but within a step of his house, a far more insulated shelter from heat and rain. This incongruity between the majestic structures of the nations and the flimsy sukka creates the irony that lies at the heart of the homily.56 Those who build such edifices should certainly be able to follow God's instructions without difficulty. To observe the commandment of dwelling in a sukka is easy. Nothing more is required than to sit in it and be. Hence the homilist dubs the sukka a "simple precept.""57 It demands no travel, no labor, no effort; one need not do anything. Compared with the effort required to build bridges, 53. Although the homilist attributes the bridges to the Persians, the Romans were famous for their engineering skill. 54. Compare bShab 33b: "Once R. Yehuda, R. Yose, and R. Shimon sat together, and Yehuda b. Gerim [= proselytes] sat among them. R. Yehuda opened: 'How pleasant are the ways of this nation [Rome]. They established markets, they established bridges, they established bath-houses.' R. Yose was silent. R. Shimon b. Yohai answered: 'Everything they made was done exclusively for their own needs. They established markets to place prostitutes there. Bath-houses, to adorn themselves. Bridges, to collect taxes .. 55. Isa 1:8, Amos 9:11. 56. Cf. Maharsha ad loc. 57.

This is one possible meaning of miisvah qalah, as in mHul 12:5, "A nmisvah qalah which [costs] about an 'issar." But the term occurs frequently in tannaitic and amoraic sources with a range of different meanings. The failure of the nations bothered the glossator: If God made it so</page><page sequence="26">26 JEFFREY L. RUBENSTEIN conquer cities, wage war, or administer marketplaces, simply to sit in the sukka is effortless. While the nations "straightaway" are able to construct a sukka, they prove unable to dwell there. To test their newfound religious zeal, God causes the sun to blaze upon them. Faced with this discomfort the nations not only exit abruptly, but also kick their sukkot in disgust. For the festival sukka is completely otherworldly, functioning only as a means to fulfill the commandment of God. It conveys no self-aggrandizement, no this-worldly pleasure, no tangible benefit. Ironically those who construct the much more impressive markets and bridges cannot observe the simple precept of the sukka. The contrast between the sukka and the other edifices is the difference between otherworldly dedication and this-worldly success, between worship of God and self-satisfaction, between vanity and Torah, between Israel and the nations. At this point the homilist moves from the Isaian verse to Psalms 2. The nations have lost the trial and now rebel against the commandment proposed by God. Of course the homilist has shifted far from the biblical view, which envisions an actual revolt against the Lord and his anointed, to a childish smack at the sukka God instructed them to build. When the nations "break the cords of their yokes," they break free from the yoke of the kingdom of heaven, not from subjugation to the Israelite king. In both cases the harmless revolt only induces God to laugh at the futile struggle. Again the irony is beautifully conveyed. While God testifies that Israel observed the entire Torah, all 613 commandments, the nations did not observe the seven they were commanded in this world, nor even the one "simple" precept in the eschaton. Yet they demand a reward! God has good reason to laugh at their folly. Besides the shift in base text from Isaiah to Psalms, the linguistic parallels and structure swiftly press the homily to its conclusion. The two hot that the nations were forced to abandon their sukkot, how could the sukka be considered a "simple" precept? He chose a secondary meaning imported from mHul. But this misses the point of the aggada and destroys the irony. Saul Lieberman, "Persecution of the Jewish Religion," Salo Wittmayer Baron Jubilee Volume (Jerusalem and New York: American Academy for Jewish Research, 1974), pp. 213-236 (Hebrew), likewise concludes that the original sense of misvah qalah here is not "an inexpensive commandment," although his explanation of the phrase is implausible. Rabbi Shlomo Goren, "Ha-'Universaliut ve-ha-yihud ha-ruhani she-be-hag ha-sukkot," Mahanayim 50 (1961): 8, writing on a somewhat different topic, comments: "The explanation of the Talmud, 'since it is an inexpensive nmisva,' is incomprehensible. Do all the other Jewish festivals cost more than the commandments of Sukkot? ... And there are other commandments which cost less than the commandment of the sukka!"</page><page sequence="27">AN ESCHATOLOGICAL DRAMA 27 "straightaway"s that introduce the nations' last acts of "going" to build the sukka and then "departing" (III, A', B') echo the two "straightaway"s that introduced their confused "coming" and reorganized "entrance" (I, A', B'). The approach and departure are expressed with perfect symmetry. Yet within the third section, the tripartite structure of God acting and the nations responding abruptly breaks off with God's final laugh (C), which receives no answer. This structural anomaly coheres perfectly with the point of the homily. When all is said and done, the nations cannot respond. There remains for them neither objection, dispute, plea, argument, nor question of God's judgment. The drama is over. A Homily for Sukkot Such then are the results of a close reading of the homily. Can we press further? To do so would require additional information about the Sitz im Leben-the audience in attendance, the place delivered, the immediate concerns of the community, the date given--data unfortunately not preserved in the historical record. Yet, while absolute certitude is unattainable, there are grounds to determine the time of year the homilist preached. Clearly the motif of the sukka points to the festival of Sukkot.58 It is difficult to believe 58. D. Rosenthal, "The Torah Reading in the Annual Cycle in the Land of Israel," Tarbiz 53 (1984): 144-147 (Hebrew), assigns the homily specifically to the festival of Simhat Torah, which he claims was observed annually at the end of Sukkot in third-century Palestine, opposing the scholarly consensus that the festival is of Babylonian origin and developed only in geonic times. Rosenthal was commenting on an article by Ezra Fleischer, "A List of Early Holidays in a Piyyut by Qiliri," Tarbiz 52 (1983): 223-272 (Hebrew), who claimed that a recently discovered piyyut mentioned Simhat Torah, and concluded that the festival was already known in Palestine in the sixth or seventh century. Rosenthal suggests that the focus on fulfilling the commandments is appropriate for the completion of the Torah reading cycle marked by Simhat Torah, and points out that Isa 43:9, the scripture the homilist expounds, occurs in the haftara for parashat bereshit according to the Babylonian lectionary cycle. This conclusion seems less compelling than the assignment to Sukkot. The theme of fulfilling commandments is always appropriate, and a homily that praised the merits of Torah would suit any weekday, Sabbath, or festival. Both Rosenthal and Fleischer have been criticized by Menahem Zvi Fox, "Insights on the Palestinian custom of Simhat Torah, the Sabbath That Coincides with the New Moon, and the Days of Awe," Sinai 103 (1989): 81-84 (Hebrew). Fox rejects the putative reference to Simhat Torah, but recognizes the thematic connection between the homily and Sukkot. He suggests that the motif of an assembly of nations derives from the haqhel ceremony (Deut 31:10-13), the septennial Torah-reading assembly that took place on Sukkot. This suggestion</page><page sequence="28">28 JEFFREY L. RUBENSTEIN that a homilist would grant the sukka such a central role in a lesson delivered on another holiday or an ordinary Sabbath. It is not only the motif of the sukka, but the entire eschatological vision that connects the homily to Sukkot and its themes. The homily draws on the last chapter of Zechariah, which was read as the haftara on Sukkot.59 The prophet foretells a revolt of the nations against Jerusalem in which the city is destroyed and half the people exiled. God and the divine minions then defeat the nations, reconstitute the Temple, and miraculously reconfigure the surrounding terrain. The conclusion warns that those nations which fail to make an annual pilgrimage to Jerusalem on Sukkot to bow before the Lord of Hosts will not receive rain. Our homilist has retained the eschatological role of Sukkot but translated the prophetic Temple-oriented worldview into the rabbinic Torah-centered vantage, refracted biblical eschatology through the prism of the rabbinic world to come, and replaced a vision of limited universalism with a particularistic eschatological triumph. While the prophet foresees the nations gathering and attacking Jerusalem, the homilist reduces the hostile assembly to a mob scene pleading for reward, just as he did with the belligerent plottings of Ps 2. Where Zechariah charges the nations to perform a Temple ceremony on Sukkot in order to receive their reward, the homilist has them observe a commandment of the Torah pertaining to the festival. Where the prophet promises bounteous rain in the eschatological era, the homilist assures an undefined reward in the world to come. And while the visionary believes that the remaining nations will comply and acknowledge the supremacy of God, the homilist extends the nations' rebellion to the bitter end: they fail to fulfill the commandment even in eschatological time and earn no reward. Zech 14 is essentially the subtext of the homily. Together the two visions comprise a type of cultural dialogue which meditates on the eschaton has a great deal of merit. The homily projects the haqhel assembly to the eschaton, where the issue becomes reward for the study of Torah, which Jews have merited through their septennial gatherings. This is a type of measure-for-measure motif, similar to those, as we shall see below, that characterize the midrashim for Sukkot. Heinemann, Derashot, p. 68, also assigns the homily to Sukkot, and conjectures that Isa 43 may have served as the haftara. 59. This was noted by Bacher, 'Aggadat, p. 329 n. 2. Actually R. Abraham b. Nathan of Lunel, Sefer Ha-Manhig, ed. Y Raphael (Jerusalem: Mossad Harav Kook, 1978), 2:408, ?46, and Simhah b. Samuel, Mahzor Vitry ed. S. Hurwitz (Berlin: H. Itzkowski, 1893), 2:443, ?381, both noted the connection as well, for both relate Zechariah's prophecy to the homily. Like Ps 2, Zech 14 is a Vilkerkampf, see Whinke, Zionstheologie, pp. 77-79. (Zech 14 is generally attributed to a later prophet, a deutero- or trito-Zechariah.)</page><page sequence="29">AN ESCHATOLOGICAL DRAMA 29 and the fate of the gentile nations. Thus it was probably on Sukkot, when the congregation recited Zech 14 as the haftara, that the homilist articulated his version. The theme of eschatological competition between Israel and the nations supports the link to Sukkot. Consider the following midrash found among the collection of homilies designated for Sukkot in Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana 27:2. Delights in your right hand are victory6 (Ps 16:11). ... R. Avin said: [It is a parable] like two who appear before the judge, and we do not know which one is the victor. When one of them carries off the palm (bayyin), then we know that he is the victor. So, too, when Israel and the heavenly counterparts (sare) of the nations enter before the Holy One on Rosh Hashana, bringing charges (meqatregin) against each other, we do not know which ones are victors. But when Israel depart from the presence of the Holy One with their lulavs and their etrogs in their hands, we know that Israel are the victors.6' R. Avin, like our homilist, pictures a heavenly trial between Israel and the nations, who enter before God the judge on Rosh Hashana. God releases the verdict of the heavenly trial on Sukkot, revealing his true judgment, whatever the illusory situation on earth. In this world the nations appear to have prevailed over Israel, but in the heavenly spheres the opposite is the case. R. Avin compares the lulav with the bais (= bayyin), the later Greek term for "palm,"62 and interprets the ritual waving of the lulav as a victory parade.63 In Hellenistic and Roman times palms were routinely given to 60. Lit., "delights are ever (nesah) in your right hand." The passage interprets nesah in the sense of "victory." 61. PRK 27:2, 404-407. A slightly different form of the midrash appears in Leviticus Rabba 30:2, ed. M. Margoliot (Jerusalem, 1953-60), p. 694. For full analysis, see Jeffrey L. Rubenstein, The History of Sukkot during the Second Temple and Rabbinic Periods (diss.; Ann Arbor: University Microfilms, 1992), pp. 432-434. 62. The classical Greek term for "palm" is phoenix. Later sources use bais or baion, from a root borrowed from Egyptian. See Paulys Real-encyclopaedie der klassischen Altertumwis- senschaft, ed. A. Pauly and G. Wissowa (Stuttgart: J. B. Metzler, 1894-1959) 20, 1, p. 386, s.v. phoenix. 63. Cf. 2 Macc 10:7. The Hasmonean triumph, following the rededication of the Temple, was celebrated with palm branches: "Bearing wands (thursoi) wreathed with leaves and fair boughs and palms, they offered hymns of praise to Him who had prospered the cleansing of his own place." See too Targumn Sheni to Esther 3:8: "[the Jews] destroy the orchards by breaking down the hedges and not taking care, and they make for themselves a hosha'ana, saying, 'As does the king in his [triumphal] ceremonies, so do we.'" (Hosha'ana here is a synonym for</page><page sequence="30">30 JEFFREY L. RUBENSTEIN victorious athletes,64 so the palm became the outstanding symbol of victory in classical culture65 and in Jewish-Hellenistic literature.66 Although the trial is not specifically set in eschatological time, but seems to be an annual event, there is no doubt that it also points to the eschaton. The "heavenly counterparts" annually rehearse the judgment that will take place at the eschaton. Then the true victors reap their reward and fully celebrate that which the lulav ritual symbolizes annually. The court setting recalls the juridical environment of our homily. The phrase "bringing charges" before God suits the nations' arguments, their accusation that Israel never fulfilled the Torah, and their objections to the lulav, as found in other sources.) The triumphator usually held a myrtle branch in his right hand during the triumphal procession. 64. Pausanius, Periegara VII 48, 2, notes, "At most games, however, [the victor] is given a crown (stephanon) of palm, and at all a palm is placed in the right hand of the victor" (Loeb ed., trans. W. H. S. Jones [Cambridge, 1935], 4:137.) Suetonius, Caligula 32, 2 relates that Caligula, after killing a gladiator (who intentionally fell), "ran about with a palm branch as victors do" (Loeb ed., trans. J. C. Rolfe [London, 1914]). Numerous imperial inscriptions dedicating games include a provision that the victors be awarded palms. 65. Plutarch, Quaest. Conyv. VIII, 4, 723B, relates a discussion in which his companions consider the question: "Why, at the various athletic festivals different kinds of wreaths are awarded, but the palm-frond at all of them?" (Loeb ed., trans F. Babbitt [Cambridge, 1927], 145). "Palm," in fact, became synonymous with victory in later classical literature. Cicero, Rosc. 6.17: aliter plurintmarunt palmarumn vetus ac nobilis gladiator habetur ("The first is reputed to be a famous and experienced gladiator, who has won many victories [palms]"; Loeb ed., trans. J. H. Freese [London, 1930], 6:137). Plutarch, Stoic. Repugn. 1045D: "if two racers have run a dead heat, is it permissible . .. that the umpire reward the palm to whichever he pleases?" In races first place was called "first palm." Cf. Vergil, Aeneid 5:339: "Euralus darts by and, winning by grace of his friend, takes first, and flies on amid favouring applause and cheers. Behind come Helymus and Diores, now third palm (nunc tertia palnma, Diores; Loeb ed., trans. H. Fairclough, [London, 1935]). Apuleis, Metaniorphoses 2, 4 calls the goddess of victory the "palm goddess": attolerabant statuas palmeris deae facies. During triumphal processions the triumphator wore a tunic adorned with palm leaves, the tunica palmata. See Livy, Ab Urba Condita X 7, 9. 66. In 1 Macc 13:51, Simon celebrated the purification of the Akra with "praise and palm branches and harps and cymbals and viols and hymns, and with songs." Judith and the women rejoicing with her carried branches in their victory parade, although these are not specified as palms; Jud 15:12-13. In John 12:13 the people greet Jesus with palms as he enters Jerusalem. In Testament of Naphtali 5:4 Levi receives twelve date palms as a symbol of power.</page><page sequence="31">AN ESCHATOLOGICAL DRAMA 31 validity of the witnesses.67 The same verbs of "entering" the trial and then "departing" after the verdict appear. Where the homily depicts the Romans, Persians, and other nations departing dejectedly, the midrash portrays Israel's victorious exit. While our homily depicts the failure of the nations to reside in sukkot and their dismissal by God, R. Avin pictures Israel carrying lulavs as a sign of a divinely recognized victory. He essentially picks up where our homily leaves off. Both homilists deploy the festival symbols to express the same theme. The sukka provides the ground for Israel's reward, her fidelity to God against the revolt of the nations, while the lulav symbolizes the reward, her victory over the nations in the world to come.68 The sun blazing upon the nations' sukkot parallels another motif found in midrashim related to Sukkot. Several sources envision God providing miraculous sukkot for the righteous in the world to come. In one version God forms the sukka from the skin of Leviathan, the primordial monster 67. In the homily Israel does not bring charges. The dialogue takes place exclusively between God and the nations. In Leviticus Rabba both Israel and the nations bring charges before God. 68. See too the expansion of this midrash in Midrash Tehillim 17:5, ed. S. Buber (Vilna, 1891), p. 126: "What is the reason for Delights in Your right hand are victory (Ps 16:.11)? Just as according to the custom of the world, when two charioteers race in the hippodrome, which of them receives a palm (bain)? The one who wins. Thus on Rosh Hashana all the people of the world come like contestants on parade and pass before God, and the children of Israel among all of the people of the world also pass before him like troops. When the first day of Sukkot comes, however, all the children of Israel, adults and children, take up lulavs in the right hand and etrogs in their left, and then all the people of the world know that in the judgment Israel was proclaimed victorious." In the Byzantine Empire races between charioteers representing different religions were indeed seen as symbolic of a struggle for superiority. See Yaron Dan, "Circus Factions (Blues and Greens) in Byzantine Palestine," The Jerusalem Cathedra I, ed. Lee Levine (Jerusalem, 1981), pp. 105-119: "When rivals were members of different religions, the victory of their chariots was viewed as a victory for their religion. Thus triumph also served as a valuable form of propaganda. In one race held in fourth-century Gaza, a Christian named Italicus competed against a pagan who was one of the heads of the city government.... The race, in effect, represented a struggle between paganism and Christianity. The victory of Italicus's chariot was considered a victory of Jesus over Mamas, the god of the city (Marnas victus est a Christo). Malalas reports that in Neapolis, the victory of a Christian charioteer named Nicias over Samaritan and Jewish entries so enraged Julianus, the leader of the Samaritan revolt (529), that he ordered Nicias be killed" (p. 107). On Jewish participation in chariot races, see p. 106 n. 4. Yaron also argues that the "Samaritan riots and rebellion at Caesarea very likely began during the chariot races, or at least were connected in one way or another with the hippodrome" (p. 117; the riots occurred in 555). The midrash beautifully incorporates this cultural symbolism into its promise of eschatological victory for the Jews.</page><page sequence="32">32 JEFFREY L. RUBENSTEIN whose flesh God serves at the eschatological banquet.69 Another version calls the eschatological sukka the "sukka of Sodom," which was formed from seven types of trees.70 In a late version the eschatological sukka protects the righteous from the fires of judgment day. R. Levi said, "Whoever fulfils the commandment of sukka in this world, God says, 'Since he observed the commandment of sukka in this world, I will protect him from the fire of the Day to Come.' " R. Yannai and Resh Laqish said, "Behold the Day to Come, burning like an oven" (Mal 3:19).71 Note that R. Levi applies the classic rabbinic "measure-for- measure" principle (mida keneged mida): those who observe the commandment of the sukka in this world will be rewarded with a protective sukka on the Day to Come. Those who neglected the sukka in this world, like the nations in our homily, remain unprotected and suffer divine punishment. The "alternative parsha" of the Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana portrays that punishment explicitly. In the world to come, what does the Holy One do? He exposes the heavens, as it says, The Heavens shall be rolled up like a scroll (Isa 34:4), and takes it [the sun] out from under its sheath (nashtiqo), and it will come forth in all its power and avenge the wicked, as it says, Behold the Day to Come, burning like an oven. All the arrogant and all the doers of evil shall be straw, and the day that is coming shall burn them to ashes and leave of them neither stock nor boughs (Mal 3:19). At that time God will make a sukka for the righteous and protect them in it, as it says, He will shelter me in his pavilion (sukko) on an evil day (Ps 27:5), and so And it serves as a sukka from heat by day (Isa 4:6), from the fire of that "Day."72 The midrash finds a basis for the protective sukka in Ps 27 and Isa 4, which speak of God sheltering his people in a metaphoric pavilion (sukko) 69. bBB 75a; PRK 455 and 456. bBB 74b mentions the banquet. See too the eschatological huppot (canopies) of bBB 75a; Pesiqta Rabbati ?37, ed. Meir Ish-Shalom (Vienna, 1880), pp. 163a; Leviticus Rabba 25:2, 570. 70. PRK 454-455. See too Tanhuma, 'Emor ?22, 496: "The Holy One said to Israel. In this world I told you to make a sukka to repay me for the good I did for you, as it says, You shall live in booths seven days ... In order that future generations may know that I made the Israelite people live in booths (Lev 23:42-43). But in the future world I will appear in my kingdom and protect you like a sukka, as it says, And it serve as a sukka from heat by day (Isa 4:5)." 71.

The author connects the "evil day" of Ps 27:5 to the "Day to Come" of Mal 3:19, and relates the two images to the fate of the two sides. While the wicked burn in the fires of judgment day, the righteous are protected in a divine sukka. Now the compiler of the "alternative parsha" juxtaposes these traditions with a paraphrase of our 'Avodah Zarah homily, indicating that he understood the traditions as complementary, and simultaneously extending the eschatological vision. Where the homily leaves off with God making the sun blaze upon the nations to force them to abandon their sukkot, the Pesiqta tradition portrays the next scene of the drama. The blazing sun is the source of the fires Malachi prophesies for judgment day.73 The sun not only causes the nations to abandon their sukkot, but also provides the means of punishment. The Pesiqta imagines that the reward for Israel, unspecified in the homily, takes the form of a protective sukka bestowed by God in return for observing the commandment of sukka. Israel tolerated the discomforts of heat and rain when they resided in sukkot in this world, so they are sheltered from the searing heat of judgment. This image adds a new dimension to the symbolism of the sukka. The sukka symbolizes not only Israel's dedication to Torah, but the form of Israel's eschatological reward. Where R. Avin interpreted the lulav as a victory symbol of the eschatological triumph Israel would enjoy, the Pesiqta renders the sukka a symbol of Israel's reward and the nations' punishment.74 The nations also figure in another Sukkot midrash, the famous tradition that connects the seventy bullocks sacrificed during the eight days of the festival with the seventy nations. [A] R. Alexandrai said: It is like a king who held a celebration. For the seven days of the feast the king's son was busy with the guests. After the seven days of feasting the king said to his son, "My son. I know that for the seven days of the feast you were busy with the guests. Now you and I will rejoice together, and I will not trouble you much, just one chicken and one litra of meat." Thus for the seven days of feasting Israel is busy with the sacrifices for the nations. 73. It should be noted that Mal 3:10-24 was the haftara for the intermediate Sabbath of Sukkot in the Palestinian lectionary cycle; see Charles Perrot, "The Reading of the Bible in the Ancient Synagogue," Mikra, ed. M. J. Mulder, CRINT II/1 (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1988), p. 147. The traditions which connect Malachi's blazing fire to the sun of the homily clearly associated the homily with Sukkot. 74. See the medieval sources, below n. 83, which also relate the homily to Sukkot.</page><page sequence="34">34 JEFFREY L. RUBENSTEIN [B] as R. Pinhas said: "All those seventy bulls that Israel used to sacrifice on Sukkot correspond (keneged) to the seventy nations, since the world will never be empty of them." [C] What is the reason? They answer my love with accusation, and I must stand judgment (Ps 109:4).7 We are confident of the judgment. [D] When the seven days of the festival are over, the Holy One says to Israel, "My sons. I know that for the seven days of the festival you were busy with the sacrifices of the nations. Now I and you will rejoice together, and I will not trouble you except with one bull and one ram."76 Num 29:12-34 mandates that seventy bulls be sacrificed over the seven days of Sukkot and one bull on Shemini 'Aseret, the Eighth-Day Assembly. The midrash correlates the seventy bulls with the proverbial seventy nations of rabbinic thought, and the one bull with Israel. The meaning of the "correspondence" of sacrifices and nations is not completely clear, but based on the parable, it seems that it serves to include the nations in the Sukkot festivities. The nations participate, at least vicariously, in the cultic joy and Temple celebrations throughout the week of Sukkot.77 Although on Shemini 'Aseret Israel and God rejoice alone, the tradition nevertheless projects an inclusive, somewhat universalist view. Sukkot is a festival at which the nations are represented. They are honored guests who participate and contribute to the King's celebration. In Zech 14 the nations make the pilgrimage to Jerusalem and bow before God, and here sacrifices are offered on their behalf. Sections [B] and [C] interrupt the flow of the parable, and seem to comprise an independent tradition interpolated from another source. Later midrashim elucidate the sense of the Psalms verse: Because Israel offers 75. The meaning of the verse is unclear. This seems to be the understanding of the mni .sh. 76. PRK 28:9, p. 433. 77. In other versions of this tradition the sacrifices atone for the sins of the nations or propitiate God for rain on their behalf. Thus bSuk 55b juxtaposes the tradition with a statement of R. Yohanan: "Alas for the nations of the world, who had a loss and know not what they lost. While the Temple stood the altar atoned for them. Now what will atone for them?" And see Rashi ad loc. So Shir ha-Shirint Rabba 4:1: "Just as a dove atones for sins, so Israel atones for the nations. Since all those seventy bullocks that they sacrifice on the Festival correspond to the seventy nations, for the world will never be empty of them." On rain, see Midrash Tehillint 109:4: "On Sukkot we offer up seventy bullocks for the seventy nations, and we pray that rain will come down for them."</page><page sequence="35">AN ESCHATOLOGICAL DRAMA 35 sacrifices on behalf of the nations, "therefore they ought to love us. Not only do they not love us, but they hate us, as it says, They answer my love with accusation (Ps 109:4)."78 Although Israel makes the loving gesture of bringing sacrifices for other nations, those nations despise Israel. The question at [C] should perhaps be understood as: "What is the reason Israel offers sacrifices for the nations, since the nations are so ungrateful, and even accuse Israel?" The redactor was evidently so astonished at R. Alexandrai's suggestion that he interrupted the nimshal with an explanation. Israel acts virtuously despite the ingratitude of the nations, and confidently awaits her vindication in court. The homily profitably can be seen against this background. The homilist fleshes out the "accusations" the nations bring against Israel to which Ps 109:4 alludes. The bitter, ungrateful nations accuse all Israel of not observing the Torah, while those called as witnesses, such as Potiphar's wife and Laban, falsely accused individual Israelites of sin. Consonant with rabbinic times, the homilist reinterprets the ritual Israel performs on behalf of the nations from sacrifices to Torah. The nations themselves admit that the world only exists because of Torah, and thus concede that they owe their very existence to Israel's fulfilling the Torah (B3). Most importantly, the homily graphically narrates the "judgment" which Israel confidently awaits in the midrash. Justice will prevail. Israel will "stand judgment" and be vindicated. The false accusations, the mistreatment and hatred of Israel will be exposed and the nations will be punished. The homilist projects the private celebration of Israel and God, which the midrash limits to Shemini 'Aseret, to the world to come. By their own actions the nations lose their right to participate in the "celebration of the king" to which they were once invited. They not only hated Israel but they destroyed the Temple in which "their" sacrifices were brought.79 They fail to celebrate Sukkot both in this world and in the eschaton. First they abused Israel and the Temple, precluding the sacrifices brought on their behalf, and then they reject another Sukkot commandment, the "simple" precept of the sukka. In the world to come, Israel and God rejoice alone. 78. Tanhumna, Pinhas ?17, 603; Tanhumna, Pinhas ?14, ed.

RUBENSTEIN Conclusions These motifs-the trial involving the nations and Israel, the two sides pressing charges in court, the eschatological reward and punishment, and of course the sukka-are consistent with motifs attached to Sukkot by other sources, and suggest that the homily should be understood within this wider context. Because of this thematic overlap, later Jewish tradition connected the homily to Sukkot. As noted above, in the Safed manuscript of Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana, this homily begins the "alternative portion," apparently intended as a homily for the second day of Sukkot in the diaspora.80 So too a late medieval midrash entitled "A Homily for Sukkot" contains our homily.81 Liturgical poets from Qalir onward paraphrase the homily in their piyyutim for Sukkot,82 and medieval jurists make the connection as well.83 Jewish tradition understood the liturgical designation for Sukkot, "the time of our rejoicing," which echoes the Deuteronomic promise "you shall have nothing but joy" (Deut 16:15) in eschatological terms. The festival of Sukkot celebrated the future triumph in judgment, victory over the nations, and eternal reward of "rejoicing" in the world to come. In addition to these thematic connections, to understand Sukkot as the context for the homily brings its moralizing and humorous character into sharper relief. The message of the importance of punctiliously observing the commandment to dwell in the sukka could hardly be missed by the audience. Although the homilist focuses on the nations' failure rather than Israel's observance, the implications are clear. Eternal reward in the world to come is 80. PRK 452; see the notes there. 81. Bet Ha-Midrash, ed. A. Jellinek (Leipzig, 1853-77), 6:50. Jellinek calls the text "Neue Pesikta," apparently a later reworking of the Pesiqta materials. 82. See Qalir's siluq, Ki 'eqqah mo'ed, in Mahzor le-Sukkot, edited by Daniel Goldschmidt; compiled by Jonah Frankel (Jerusalem, 1980), pp. 126-135. The beginning of the piyyut presupposes the homily. Those who believe Qalir did not know the Babylonian Talmud will claim that he knew the midrash found in the Talmud from another source. We have seen that the amoraim to whom the Talmud attributes the midrash are Palestinian.

If the goal was to promote dwelling in the sukka within the community, the homily seems an effective means. Yet the homilist artfully balances the eschatological promise with this- worldly realism. Dwelling in the sukka was not always the most pleasant experience. If autumn in Palestine can be delightfully refreshing, it can also be rainy, windy, and cold or oppressively hot. Sometimes it is uncomfortable to sit in the sukka. No one likes to eat the festival meal with teeth chattering or pouring sweat. Sensitive to these possibilities, the Mishna exempts one from remaining in the sukka if it begins to rain, and other traditions provide dispensation for similar discomforts. A baraita in the Palestinian Talmud rules: "Just as they clear out the sukka on account of rain, so too because of extreme heat or mosquitoes."84 The discomfort of the nations in the hot sun was an experience familiar to Jews. They knew well that the "simple commandment" was not so simple after all. The audience probably recalled times when they had wished to kick their sukkot in disgust and retreat to more comfortable surroundings. We might expect a sympathetic chuckle, a smile of understanding as they mused at the predicament of the unfortunate nations. God laughs with triumphal mocking, but those who annually experienced the ups and downs of sukka life, and might be returning to their sukkot after the homily, probably laughed more gently at the tongue-in-cheek humor. The humorous element should not obscure the overall message of reward for Israel and dismissal of the nations. There lingers an air of triumphalism, of particularism, and of superiority. Sukkot follows soon after Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, the Day of Judgment and the Day of Atonement, when God seals the fate of human beings for the coming year. Besides the individual judgment based on personal merit and sin, these traditions point to a larger judgment, that of entire peoples, of Israel and the nations. Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana 27:2 explicitly links Sukkot to the judgment of Rosh Hashana, and it seems that our homily should be understood in this light as well. The sukka, metonymically representing observance of Torah, separates Israel from the nations. In the final reckoning, all pleas will be futile: only those who observe the Torah will have a share in the world to come. New York University New York, N.Y. 84. ySuk 2:10, 53c. Recall that Jonah felt so uncomfortably hot in his sukka that he longed for death (Jon 4:8).</page></plain_text>
