<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael V. Fox. Character and Ideology in the Book of Esther: Studies on Personalities of the Old Testament. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1991. xv, 317 pp. The fast and frenzied reading of the Megillah during the annual Purim celebration is not likely to engender respect for the book of Esther as a work of literature in the minds of the inebriated. And even those who approach the book fully sober have often criticized its plot as contrived, its characters as</page><page sequence="2">248 BOOK REVIEWS shallow, and its spirit as vengeful. But in Character and Ideology in the Book of Esther, Michael Fox demonstrates to all such skeptics that in its careful crafting Esther reflects a sophisticated literary and theological mind. Unlike some newer literary approaches which take the Hebrew Bible in isolation as the context for intertextual interpretation, Fox prefers a Sitz im Leben set squarely in the history of Jewish life in the diaspora. His book actually functions as a double commentary. The first part offers a standard critical translation and commentary that divides Esther into twelve acts and comments on the text verse by verse. Fox here focuses on the unfolding logic of plot and character. He substantiates agreements and pursues disagreements with previous commentators, both modern and rabbinic, in a way that enables readers to participate in the process of interpretation. At the same time, he attempts to make clear the assumptions and attitudes that underlie his own reading, thus personalizing the commentary in a style more akin to Rashi or Ramban than to the faceless "objectivity" of historical criticism. The second part of Fox's book, comprising slightly more than half of it, analyzes and extends the commentary along the lines of structure, character, and ideology. With chapters devoted to each of the major characters, including the Jewish people and God as characters, Fox illustrates his contention that the reader's construction of a character from the data given by the writer constitutes an act of imagination through which the world of the writer comes alive. At the outset (p. 4), Fox poses six questions which he believes are provoked by the story and that serve to highlight the emphases of his commentary. Four relate to the situation of the Jewish community in diaspora: how it can survive, how it must act in times of crisis, what is its nature in exile, what is the nature of the gentile state. I daresay that these questions are posed less by the text than by the Jewish experience of diaspora; for Christian readers, these are not the first questions the story raises. Yet in attending to these questions Fox exposes the real paradigmatic quality of Esther for Jewish readers. Classifying Esther as a "diaspora story" along with Daniel 1-6 and Tobit (pp. 145-158), Fox sees this genre illustrating how Jews depend on themselves as a community in the absence of state, king, territory, temple, and priests. He especially wants to dispel the lingering dislike of the book promoted by nineteenth-century German theologians who saw it as an expression of Jewish fanaticism, xenophobia, and exclusivism. Fox argues that while the book is nationalistic in its affirmation of the right of Jews to maintain their identity in the diaspora, it also sees peaceful integration of Jews in the diaspora as an</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 249 ideal. After all, the book does not protest Esther's marriage to a gentile king or Mordecai's status as his courtier. One of the more troubling aspects of Esther for modern commentators, through not for traditional readers, is the absence of explicit reference to God. Some moderns have classified the book as "secular," while others have suggested that God's presence in the story is intended by allusions (e.g., the phrase "another place" [4:14]), coincidences, reversals, or by the very theme of the survival of the Jews. Fox argues, to the contrary, that the author creates a "carefully crafted indeterminacy" (p. 247) through which he aims to communicate his own uncertainty about God's role in history. While this is an intriguing possibility, it imputes to the author a rather modern sophistication, and indeterminacy, in any case, is difficult to demonstrate. Fox also takes on those feminists who believe that the Esther story under- girds the assumptions of patriarchal ideology by presenting women as obedient even when they become heroines. Rather than supporting the courageous Vashti, some feminists assert, Esther sidles in for her own self-serving reasons. When she does stand up, it is only at Mordecai's urging, and she speaks only when given permission by the king. Fox asserts that this position ignores Esther's growth, imposes modern standards upon the restrictive life of an ancient oriental court, and is indifferent to the major crisis at the heart of the book: the mortal danger of the Jewish people. On the contrary, says Fox, the author of Esther satirizes male dominance in the Persian court and portrays Esther as a courageous and intelligent woman whose importance is unrelated to motherhood and who shares power with her uncle. Through his two fold analytic and synthetic approach to Esther, Fox succeeds in generating a world from the words of the text. He shows how the relationship between the Jews and the Persians illustrates and becomes a template for the dynamics of diaspora existence. By analyzing the decisions that Mordecai and Esther each'make to combat the unabashed Jew-hatred of Haman, Fox reveals the classic quality of their dilemma. More than any other biblical book, this one not only depicts how Jews see the Other, but also how Jews see the Other seeing the Jews. In his patient and careful study, Fox illuminates this double vision. Robert L. Cohn Lafayette College Easton, Pa.</page></plain_text>
