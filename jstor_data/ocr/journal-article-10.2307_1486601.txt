<plain_text><page sequence="1">BAGHDAD JEWRY IN LATE OTTOMAN TIMES: THE EMERGENCE OF SOCIAL CLASSES AND OF SECULARIZATION by SHLOMO DESHEN In late Ottoman times and until the end of the British Mandate in 1932, the community in Baghdad was one of the glories of modern Jewry. In the contemporary Middle East and Mediterranean world, Baghdad Jewry was rivaled in size and institutions only by the Jewish community of Salonika. But despite its prominence, and that of its descendants in Israel today, Baghdad Jewry has been studied very little. Our understanding of Jewish societies in obscure regions such as Yemen and Tripolitania is more advanced. This paper offers the outlines of a sociological portrait to fill the gap. Since antiquity Jews have been a prominent minority in the Middle East and North Africa, particularly in the cities, where they performed important functions. The study of Middle Eastern Jews has, for many decades, been mainly structured in terms of the political concerns of our own time. The thrust of many scholars has been to demonstrate the so-called symbiosis of Jews and Arabs in the past; others have uncovered abrasiveness and hostility in the relations between Jews and Arabs. These materials have been bandied about by political protagonists of various positions in the latter-day conflict. However, the study of Middle Eastern Jews is also important for ordinary Early versions of this paper were presented in 1991 at conferences on Middle Eastern Jewish Studies convened in Jerusalem by Harvey Goldberg, in Binghamton by Yedida Stillman, and in Tel Aviv, at the International Conference on the Study of Iraqi Jewry, by Yitzhak Avishur. I am thankful to S. N. Eisenstadt and Sylvia Kedourie, who offered comments on a draft, and in particular to Zvi Yehuda, who enlightened me on numerous points. Leila Fawaz gave valuable editorial advice. AJS Review 19/1 (1994): 19-44 19</page><page sequence="2">20 SHLOMO DESHEN academic reasons. Given the prominence of the Middle Eastern Jewish minority, any understanding of issues concerning the majority population necessitates incorporating data about the minority. As a point of methodology it may be stated that a general thesis to which there are exceptions is superficial; the exceptions require to be woven into the generality so that the thesis can be formulated in a nuanced way. The study of Middle Eastern Jewry should, therefore, be situated in general Middle Eastern studies, not only in Jewish studies. This applies particularly to a minority community like late Ottoman Baghdad Jewry, which was highly prominent in its environment, in both numbers and socioeconomic activities.' The thesis of the present study is that late Ottoman Baghdad Jewry was characterized by increasing complexity. The population grew dramatically and became socially heterogeneous; new strata emerged and new organizations were founded. The population developed an image of itself as organized in a markedly steep, stratified way. The main sources for the study are the legal responsa of local sages, especially Rabbis cAbdulla Somekh (1813-1889) and Yosef Hayim (1834-1909), and the sermons of the latter and of Rabbi Shim'on Agassi (1852-1914). For comparative purposes I have also made use of the responsa of Rabbi Sedaqa Husen (1699-1773), the leading sage of eighteenth-century Baghdad.2 Other important material pertaining to this study, collated by Abraham Ben-Yaakob (1979, first published in 1965, the standard study of Baghdad Jewry), serves as source.3 But significant analytical studies on Baghdad Jewry are limited. And the Ben-Yaakob volume, despite its great informational value, is deficient in focus. On the general nineteenth-century Baghdadi setting no comprehensive monograph is, to my knowledge, available.4 We do have on hand a small number of fine general overviews of Middle Eastern Jewish history in modern times, the most comprehensive 1. To cite one example of the fruitfulness of such an approach: a study of Moroccan Jewish mellah society has contributed to a virtually classical topic of Middle Eastern studies, the elucidation of the nature of the so-called Muslim city (Deshen 1984, 1989). 2. I am grateful to Dr. Zvi Zohar for placing at my disposal the draft of a comprehensive bibliographic review of the writings of the sages of Baghdad which he is preparing. From Zohar's work I am satisfied that the sources I use reflect the bulk of the pertinent extant materials. 3. There are supplementary materials in Ben-Yaakob 1980a. I have not cited the numerous primary and secondary sources on Baghdad Jewry that I did not find directly useful for the purposes of this article. 4. A volume by Batatu (1978) on a later period does offer an outline description of the</page><page sequence="3">BAGHDAD JEWRY IN LATE OTTOMAN TIMES 21 and recent being Stillman (1991). I accept the conclusions of that work, and they serve as premises and points of departure for my own exploration. The latter differs from the works of the scholars whom I cite, or merely allude to, on two counts. First, I do not command all the language skills of the Orientalist, hence my coverage of sources is limited. Second, I am not motivated by a passion to discover hitherto unknown historical documents, as many professional historians are. I am a social anthropologist interested in historical Jewish societies, and I bring to bear the concerns and questions of my craft to sources that are well known, but have not been studied from a socioanthropological perspective. The rationale for this interdisciplinary venture is the possibility that it may prove illuminating, and enrich our understanding of the people concerned. The Material Setting From antiquity until the thirteenth century, Mesopotamia was a major center of the Jewish diaspora, often equal in importance, and sometimes superior, to the Palestinian Jewish heartland. After the thirteenth century, how- ever, Mesopotamian Jewry-and Baghdadi Jewry in particular-declined, along with the disintegration of the caliphate. Between the destruction of Baghdad by the Mongols and the mid-eighteenth century, Baghdad Jewry was insignificant, as Mesopotamia itself became a border province between rival empires. The fact that in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries the senior Baghdad sages were members of a family that originated in Kurdistan suggests this decline, because Kurdish Jewry does not have a distinguished record in scholarship and creativity. By the eighteenth century most Baghdad Jews were making a precarious living from peddling, and some engaged in the illegal, and consequently hazardous, alcohol and wine trade. Some were craftsmen, particularly silversmiths, and a small number were moneylenders, particularly to the local potentates. In the late eighteenth century Persian power waned, and in the nineteenth century the Ottomans reasserted their sway over their Mesopotamian province, improving its security. Baghdad began to play a role in the British India trade, traditional society, and particularly of the merchant classes. There is also an outline description of modem Baghdad Jewry in Rejwan (1985).</page><page sequence="4">22 SHLOMO DESHEN and the Jewish community greatly increased. In 1794 the number of Jews there is reported to have been about 2,500, or 3.3 percent of the population of the city (about 75,000). By 1893 the Jews are reported to have increased to about 50,000, no less than 35 percent of a population of about 145,000 (Ben-Yaakob 1979:107, 231-232; Batatu 1978:248). The Jewish community thus would seem to have increased twentyfold, while the city as a whole barely doubled its population. The data upon which these demographic conclusions are based are notoriously vague. But there is another set of data that similarly indicates dramatic population expansion. Ben-Yaakob (1979:279-283) reports that over the nineteenth century the number of synagogues in Baghdad increased tenfold, from three to about thirty. Moreover, the synagogues were generally overcrowded (see n. 5). So granting that the population figures are imprecise and may be exaggerated, they do in general indicate great demographic vitality. The causes of the increase in the second half of the nineteenth century were migration from Persia, where Jews were particularly oppressed, and from Kurdistan and Syria. Baghdad Jews were aware that theirs was a very large community (Hayim 1977b:64; Hayim 4: ib, 2:5), and that it was growing (Hayim 2:3b). On the level of halakhic guidance this is indicated by the fact that, whereas in the past Baghdad sages had frowned upon the consumption of bread from non-Jewish bakeries, by the second half of the nineteenth century they relaxed this prohibition because Jewish bakeries were unable to meet the demand, and a shortage might cause the price of bread to rise. To avoid hardship the sages permitted the consumption of Muslim bread (Somekh 2:159).5 The reassertion of Ottoman rule in the nineteenth century coincided 5. This should not be interpreted anachronistically in connection with the kashrut laws. In Western countries industrial mass-produced bread has aroused kashrut-linked objections in the twentieth century, rooted in details of the new production processes, but that was not the case in nineteenth-century Baghdad. The old Baghdad prohibition was rooted in mystical thought and practice, not in halakhah in the strict sense of the term. Population increases also led to changes in the timing of rituals. The custom of slaughtering fowl on the eve of Yom Kippur was advanced to begin at an earlier hour, to alleviate the pressure of clients on the shohatim (Hayim 1977:113). More significantly, morning prayer time originally began at sunrise. Due to the pressure of the numerous worshipers who crowded the synagogues on the feast of Sukkot, each of whom desired to wave the scarce ritual "arb'a minim greenery, prayers began earlier, at dawn, as soon as quorums convened. Subsequently the practice of beginning services at that early hour was extended throughout the year to alleviate the pressure on the limited facilities (Hayim 1977:14b). One source gives the specific date of 1860 for the change in synagogue</page><page sequence="5">BAGHDAD JEWRY IN LATE OTTOMAN TIMES 23 with the Tanzimat reforms that tightened the hold of the central government over the provinces. The effect on the Jewish community was to encroach on the prerogatives of old-established families and to favor newly installed government-backed functionaries and institutions. The innovations coincided with a great expansion of commerce, resulting from British policies in India. Baghdad, and in particular its Jewish sector, became a commercial hub. The opening of the Suez Canal caused ancient inland routes of commerce to stagnate, and international commerce to move southward to the port of Basra. The outcome of all this was a general expansion. In addition to the rise in population, new institutions and social classes grew. Baghdad Jewry became increasingly polarized economically, as the number of wealthy financiers, on the one hand, and of the poor, on the other, increased. Uniquely in Jewish social history we hear of mass political mobilization. In 1883, 1,700 people signed a petition protesting taxation (Ben-Yaakob 1980a: 190); in 1884, some 400 signed a petition protesting the appointment of an unpopular sage to the office of hakham bashi ("chief sage") (Ben-Yaakob 1979:168). On another occasion a protagonist in a dispute found it necessary to explain why he had not circulated a mass petition to advance his cause (Ben-Yaakob 1980a: 169). People beyond the limited circle of hereditary notables became politically active. In the 1820s Jews from Baghdad began to establish colonies of merchants and industrial entrepreneurs in India and throughout the Far East, and by the end of the century they were also in England. These overseas communities were run by scions of aristocratic families, the Sassoons in particular, who maintained their communal ties and used them effectively in their commercial affairs. Baghdadi Jews also became agents for British companies, especially in the textile import trade from England and India to Iraq, and dominated international trade between India, Iraq, and Persia. The Jewish presence in trading was so salient that Saturdays were slack days. A European visitor to Baghdad in 1880 reports characteristically, "On Sabbath days all the stores close, and a holy repose (dumiat qodesh) prevails in the city" (Ben-Yaakob 1979:214). Jewish traders were also to be found as middlemen who extended loans and securities for modest transactions. There were even business-women who acted as economic agents. But we also hear of people who could not practice. This suggests that about that time people began to feel that the community was expanding significantly. The Jewish population figure cited for that year is 20,000.</page><page sequence="6">24 SHLOMO DESHEN make a living (Hayim 4:23), and of people who were forced to search for food among the refuse (Hayim 3:27b, also Husen 1975:88). Wealth was founded in part on the importation of the new products of the textile industry promoted by the British in England and in India and the development of modern professions, and in part on the old Baghdad Jewish occupations of finance and moneylending. Even in the twentieth century, descendants of the old notable families of the eighteenth century were still active in banking. The affluent overseas communities sent back to Baghdad for their religious functionaries and teachers, and contributed generously to training facilities in Baghdad so that the community would flourish (see, for instance, Sassoon 1949:206).6 Community Leadership Mesopotamian Jewry had a venerable tradition of having been governed by scions of the royal Davidic family of ancient Judea that went back at least as far as the beginning of the common era. Even after the tradition was finally lost, in the seventeenth century, the Baghdad community continued to be dominated by individuals from a small circle of wealthy aristocratic families, one of whom served as the nasi' ("president," pl. nesi'im) of the community. The nasi', who owed his position to his acting as a financier for the local Muslim governor, was responsible for collecting taxes and sundry extortions from the Jews, and provided the governor with loans and securities. Sometimes the nasi' advanced the community's payments out of his own resources (Husen 1978:156, 256). The community had little say about who was appointed nasi'. This was a personal transaction between the Muslim potentate and a wealthy financier. The nasi' retained his post by virtue of the potentate's authority. There are reports of high-handed, autocratic nesi'im who extorted money from other Jews (Husen 1978:194), but no information as to how they retained their authority. In contrast to comparable Jewish communities in Northern Europe and Morocco, eighteenth-century Baghdad Jewry lacked an independent 6. In modern times, until the Holocaust, Eastern European rabbis by and large discouraged emigration. Consequently, emigrants tended to be marginal in various ways or to belong to the lower class. Long-term relationships between emigrants and their home communities tended to be ambivalent. This was not the case among Baghdadi Jews.</page><page sequence="7">BAGHDAD JEWRY IN LATE OTTOMAN TIMES 25 group of sages. In these other societies the sages constituted a resourceful and powerful stratum. Appointments to judicial and religious positions lay partly in their hands and partly in the hands of lay leaders. Sometimes, as in precolonial Morocco, the sages had more say, and sometimes, as in European Jewry, the lay community had more say, with gradations in between in other regions.7 But in eighteenth-century Baghdad appointments were solely by the nasi'. Moreover, the nasi' often interfered in court procedures, which elsewhere were governed exclusively by rabbinical discretion. As in other Jewish societies, in Baghdad lay jurisdiction over certain matters was administered by the nasi'. He administered corporal punishment in cases of sexual misdemeanor, for example (Husen 1975:21; Hayim 1:74b), but in addition also had extraordinary standing. Although in general Baghdad's synagogues were publicly owned (Hayim 2:13b-14), the synagogue that the nasi' attended was popularly regarded as being his own; the flowery title of the sage who officiated there was "Head Cantor of the President's Great Synagogue" (rosh hazan ha-keneset ha-gedola shel ha-nasi') (Ben-Yaakob 1980a: 179). On festivals the nasi' would hold grand feasts where he hosted the dignitaries and sages of the community (Hayim 3:18); according to Middle Eastern etiquette, this meant that he was superior to the sages. The nasi' figures together with the sages as signatory of a decree against games of chance (Hayim 2:119). It is indicative of the relatively modest position of the sages that we find complaints that they lacked books for their work (Husen 1975:217, 278). Toward the middle of the nineteenth century the relative standings changed. The nasi' is no longer mentioned in the sources, while the number of sages increased, and they are found operating in academies (yeshiva or midrash, pl. midrashimn), making legal decisions on matters brought to the attention of senior sages and then reviewed by them. Rabbis Yosef Hayim 7. These comments are predicated on a conception of Jewish social history as an exercise in comparative ethnography that requires adequate documentation. At present there are only a few monographic studies that could serve as a base. On medieval Mediterranean Jewry (primarily Tunisia), there is Goitein's great Geniza study (1967-1988), and on late premodern Central European Jewry there is Katz (1961). There are several much more delimited attempts, such as Goldberg (1990) on late Ottoman Tripolitania, Udovitch and Valensi (1984) on Jerba in Tunisia, and my own work on Morocco (1989). On the Yemen there is Nini (1991) and numerous earlier works by Goitein, Brauer, Tobi, and others, many of them cited by Nini. Several minor works are to be found in a reader by Deshen and Zenner (1982), which also contains a preliminary synthesis by the editors; Sharot (1976) also contains work of a comparative nature.</page><page sequence="8">26 SHLOMO DESHEN and 'Abdulla Somekh often remark that they allow junior sages and disciples, referred to as "the sages of the academy" (hakhmey ha-yeshiva), to deliberate matters that were brought before them. The importance of this new stratum of sages is also made evident by the disputes between them; they take sides for or against particular appointees to the office of hakhamn bashi and on matters of income and taxation. They staged demonstrations, signed petitions, threatened, and generally played politics. These activities do not necessarily reflect a total reversal of roles between the old political elite and the new religious one-the sources are all rabbinical and have a natural tendency to highlight the doings of sages-but they do suggest that both their number and their importance had grown. That this development was important to the Jews of nineteenth-century Baghdad is evident from the fact that sages and their doings figure prominently in their ethnohistory (Ben-Yaakob 1979:118 and sources). According to local history, the first great Torah sage of recent times came to Baghdad from Aleppo after a plague in the mid-eighteenth century had killed all the native sages. Thereafter Torah scholarship began to flourish, reaching its apogee with the activities of the sages of the mid- and late nineteenth century.8 One witness before a court identified years by linking them to a particular sage.9 Symbols of Status Baghdad's Jews had numerous terms to designate differences of social status. These terms were consistent with the class situation in the eighteenth century, the emergence of a new stratum of religious scholars and the decline of the old political elite. Care in religious practice was expressed by a variety of honorifics: mnedaqdeqim ("punctilious"), zehirimn ("careful"), "anshei ma'aseh ("men of [good] deeds") (Hayim 2:3b; Somekh 1:432, 2:159). It is worthy of note that punctiliousness in this area was not referred to by a single term. This suggests that although Baghdadi Jews differentiated among themselves religiously, the categories were not formal and rigid. Together with the classification of some individuals as sages and religiously painstaking came 8. The question whether or not this popular historical account is factually correct is irrelevant for popular awareness of the presence of a category of sages. 9. The source states: "Mas'uda daughter of Abdulla Moshe Zilkha was born one year after the death of our teacher and master, the sage Rabbi Abdulla Somekh (may his memory be a blessing), and she was born after the Sukkot festival." (Hayim 4, Even ha'ezer: 15).</page><page sequence="9">BAGHDAD JEWRY IN LATE OTTOMAN TIMES 27 the designation of the opposite category, persons who were "boors" (cam ha-'ares) (Hayim 4:6, 7).10 Similarly, we hear of customs of "the common people" (hamon ha-'am) in a derogatory context (Somekh 2:168). Members of the lower class are referred to stereotypically: butchers are "complete evildoers" (Somekh 2:195), and "most bakers are boors" (Somekh 2:159). A particular custom that a sage disapproves of is categorized in terms of a putative lower-class origin. It is termed "a custom that the synagogue sextons have fabricated (badu)" (Hayim 4:2b; also Somekh 2:168). Only sages were eulogized in the synagogue when they died. In one case an aged, pious, but unlearned man was eulogized in his modest home, into which a great crowd pressed (Hayim 4:18b). Since the deceased was not a sage, the event could not be held in the more convenient premises of a spacious synagogue. When sages were called upon for advice about ritual practices, they imposed strict practices upon boors, because "it is proper to be stringent (le-hahmir) with [them]" (Hayim 4:26; Somekh 2:195). This is phrased as a virtual principle of rabbinical pastoral teaching in the community. The idea that standing in society is related to religious scholarship is basic in Jewish thought and practice, but in late Ottoman Baghdad it was newly emphasized with some harshness. Comparable Moroccan material has no trace of such expressions (Deshen 1989). Socioreligious practice also differentiated rich and poor. Ordinary people held one daily feast for their newly married children during the week that followed the wedding, as required by tradition. But the wealthy held two feasts daily (Somekh 3:179-180). It was customary to honor wealthy people by bringing spices from the synagogue to their homes when the Sabbath ended. The practice was institutionalized, and individuals purchased the privilege from the community (Hayim 3:25). The wealthy had special domestic arrangements during the festival of Sukkot, when people spent time in temporary huts and home routines were changed (Hayim 2:41b). The wealthy were generous in giving to charity (Hayim 2:100), and employed Jewish women as domestic help (Hayim 1:63). This overt and cognitive categorization of people in terms of wealth, and further, the linkage of the difference, as a matter of course, with socioreligious practice, is remarkable. We find it at certain times and places in traditional 10. Jewish religiosity is usually conceived of as flowing from knowledge of the divine law, while boorishness is conceived of as leading to disregard of the law, hence to irreligiosity. Therefore, there is an apposition between the religiously punctilious and the boorish.</page><page sequence="10">28 SHLOMO DESHEN Jewish and other societies, for instance in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Central European Jewry. But it is by no means universal. A report from Baghdad that appeared in a European publication, Ha-Maggid, on 14 April 1874 is illuminating. The paper's correspondent, a member of the community, described a local philanthropist who had given 150 men grants to study Torah: There are many completely uncultured people here who are ignorant of Bible and Mishnah, [lack] good manners, and are a disgrace to the Jewish people. For eight months now this man has prevailed upon [150 of] them to improve themselves, teaching them the Torah of the Living God, so that they should be considered like all our wealthy brethren (nehshavim ke-khol 'aheinu ha- cashirim). .... They have come ... to keep the precepts like all Israel ... rising early to prayers and staying late in the evening in synagogue, and study diligently. ... We hope that in the future there will be no more boors in Baghdad. Evidently, the writer regarded material affluence as being normally and naturally tied to excellence in religiosity, and conversely, poverty in his view dovetailed with religious laxity. Seen in terms of class theory these conceptions, linking material differences with symbols of differentiation in other spheres of life (such as religion), are a fundamental element of social-class formation. Respectable people are reported to have had specific ideas on decorum, such as not carrying objects in public (Husen 1978:169). "An important person" ('adam gadol) is given the honor of ritually covering the blood shed when fowl are slaughtered (Somekh 1:432). Some people occasionally slaughtered a sheep and distributed the meat among the poor (Somekh 2:219). A sage, discussing the possibility of using someone else's talit and tefillin (prayer shawl and phylacteries) without permission, remarks, "In our times most people are particular that others should not put on their talit and tefillin [which they left in synagogue]" (Hayim 1977:4b). Jews in many communities are not particular about others using the ritual objects that are normally left in synagogue after daily services, provided they are properly returned to their place. But in Baghdad men were fussy about this. The impression we gain is that decorum, formality, and social distance were marked." 11. This source appears in Rabbi Yosef Hayim's compendium of customs, which is dated 1898 (Hayim 1977:99).</page><page sequence="11">BAGHDAD JEWRY IN LATE OTTOMAN TIMES 29 Differences in status were entrenched. In a discussion of synagogue etiquette, Rabbi Yosef Hayim urges that expressions of obeisance to superiors be restrained while in synagogue. Recommending obedience to the halakhic requirement that gestures of respect be given only to one's parents, the learned, and the aged, the sage rules (Hayim 1977:55): When a rich notable (gevir) who is neither aged nor learned enters the synagogue, one should not rise in his honor, because such a gesture would imply a lack of honor to Heaven. Such is the case even concerning a rich notable whom one would honor outside the synagogue. However, if the case happens to be of a famous rich notable of the community leaders (mi-yehidey ha-qahal), and he is punctilious about this, then it is permissible to rise in his honor, so as to avert strife. The sage does not see disrespectful behavior as likely to be a problem. He worries, however, that the improper expansion of the categories of people entitled to overt gestures of respect will lead to unseemly conduct in a house of worship. Rabbi Yosef Hayim explicated the popular sentiments concerning social differentiation. According to the Sabbath halakhah, objects that one has discarded may generally not be recovered and used on the Sabbath, for reasons of technical halakhic mukse rules. The Talmud recognizes differences between rich and poor in this matter. Pieces of fabric and mats that are smaller than a certain measure are forbidden to the rich on the Sabbath, because they are assumed to consider such objects worthless, but for the poor, who might have use for them, they do not fall into the forbidden category. The Baghdadi sage, in explicating these Sabbath practices, emphasized the social niceties of his time. Operating in an original way he further incorporated class differentiation into halakhah. He ruled that a poor person who happens to be the guest of a rich man on the Sabbath must abide by the halakhic status of the host, because presumably he will enjoy the latter's affluence, hence the said object will be forbidden to him. Conversely, a rich man who happens to be in a poor man's home on the Sabbath is permitted to act according to his host's status, because presumably the latter's straitened condition will also affect the guest (Hayim 1977b:27b). Status consciousness also affected marriage arrangements. Families were more or less respectable, and the term "of good family" is often used (Hayim 1:77b). Public opinion, honor, and shame were important. A case came before</page><page sequence="12">30 SHLOMO DESHEN the sages in which a married woman was suspected of adultery. Halakhic law requires divorce when such a suspicion is confirmed. In the case at hand the sage ruled that the suspicions were unfounded and cleared the woman's name, but the husband nonetheless insisted on a divorce on the grounds that it would be shameful (herpa) for him to remain married to a woman who had even been suspected of such a thing (Husen 1975:22). In another case the father of a young man, engaged to be married, belatedly discovered that the father of the bride made his living as a schoolteacher. The man wanted to break his son's engagement on the grounds that this made the match "shameful for him" (genay lo) (Hayim 2:72b). A sage has a discussion about "loss of face"; he concludes that this is most grievous when one is among people of "his own kind" (ha-sug shelo) (Hayim 2:40b)'2. Questions of status recur in discussions of dowries and gifts at marriage, which were major considerations in marital arrangements. A recent study of nineteenth-century Baghdadi Jewish marriages (Avishur 1990) shows that disputes over these matters involved the notion that an opulent dowry and gifts reflected on the social standing of the parties. They were not only material transactions. The data indicate that over time the proportion of goods given by the family of the bride increased, their overall value increased, and the proportion of cash relative to other goods increased. The parents of grooms insisted on generous dowries and gifts for the brides of their sons not only for the obvious material reasons, but also because generous gifts were an acknowledgment of their status. Less opulent gifts were considered degrading to the groom and his parents, and, to a lesser extent, also to the parents of the bride. The dowry increased when the bride was either old, unattractive, or divorced (Hayim 1:77, 2:72b). Brides universally like to appear in finery, but the rationale that the Baghdad sources suggest for this, as a matter of course, is revealing. It is to advertise the distinction of the bride's family (le-har'ot shevah bet 'aviha) (Hayim 2:100-101). The status element is emphasized. Some girls rejected offers of marriage and threatened suicide if the father persisted with a particular match (Hayim 1:85; 4, Even ha'ezer: 15, 18b). In one case the father of a bride gave the girl's age as eight years less than it actually was (Hayim 1:77b). The groom was apparently of modest background, and the bride, whose brothers were scholars (talmidey hakhamim), of a notable family. Presumably, because of the bride's advanced 12. Elsewhere we hear that bachelors are "usually bashful" when offered the honor of holding the baby at circumcisions (Hayim 4: Sod yesharim section, 34).</page><page sequence="13">BAGHDAD JEWRY IN LATE OTTOMAN TIMES 31 age, her family were resigned to a less than optimal groom, but they still had to resort to deception. Such deceptions could arise only where the families, and certainly the young people concerned, did not know each other, a condition that must have been common in the growing and heterogeneous community of Baghdad. Families new to the city would have little familiarity with the parents or child concerned. Moreover, there are indications that marriages within the extended family were rare in Baghdad (Avishur 1990:42-50). All this indicates a social situation that was conducive to abrasiveness in the arrangement of marriages by parents. The contrast with the Moroccan Jewish family is striking. In the much more extensive material we have for traditional Morocco, there is hardly any indication of friction over matchmaking (Deshen 1989:107-108). I suggest that this is probably because the Moroccan communities were more homogeneous in both origin and class, and numerically much smaller. Matches were therefore between people who were likely to be familiar and comfortable with each other in advance.'" Social Institutions, Positions, and Stereotypes Among the new institutions that developed in nineteenth-century Baghdad were talmudic academies, benevolent funds for the benefit of cities in the Holy Land, and funds for the sick (Hayim 2:66, 1:111; 1973:223). "The community" (ha-kolel) is reported to have paid salaries to the judges, stipends to scholars, money for the education (and meals) of students, and the salaries of their teachers (Hayim 2:17b, 4:21). Presumably these benefits accrued only to the poor, but the significant point is the involvement of the public in charity, in the guise of formally organized voluntary associations and of the community corporation. The community collected indirect taxes from kosher meat slaughtering and kept written accounts (Hayim 2:110b). It supported 13. The marriages of Ashkenazi Jews, like those of Baghdadis, were arranged on a background of social heterogeneity (diverse classes and regions). Ashkenazic Jewry developed a formal role for the matchmaker (shadkhan), whose skills included judging the compatibility of the couple and evaluating the overall chances of success for the match. Baghdad Jewry also had matchmakers, but there was no name for them aside from the generic term dalal ("middleman"). This suggests that the role of matchmaker was not as institutionalized in Baghdad as it was in Ashkenazi Jewry, perhaps because the size and heterogeneity of the population were only recent developments in Baghdad.</page><page sequence="14">32 SHLOMO DESHEN a hospital, originally founded with funds provided by wealthy emigrants. It distributed funds for the operation of talmudic academies that had originally been established by private initiative. The "beadle" and "beadle of the court-of-law" (shamash bet din) (Hayim 1:74b, 2:84b) and ritual slaughterers were appointed by the community (Somekh 2:221). Some examples of the system in action: A shohet failed in his work, thereby causing people to consume meat that was not kosher. The pious asked how they could atone for this mishap. The sage ruled that they were not obliged to atone because the fault was beyond their control (Hayim 1973:366); the responsibility belonged solely to the public official.14 In another case a sage who served as a judge was maintained partly from a fund for the sick (quppat biqqur holim) that was supported by ten wealthy men. When one of the ten became involved in a suit that was to be tried by this judge, the other party to the suit argued that the sage should be disqualified because of his financial dependence on his opponent. But a superior sage dismissed the argument. He ruled that the judge was not dependent upon the wealthy litigant, because once the funds were delivered to the charity they became "money that is sanctified for the indigent" (mamon heqdesh la-'aniyim) (Hayim 1973:223-225). The superior sage evidently operated on the notion that heqdesh, a holy endowment, is an institution that sets benefactor and recipient apart. In his view, such gifts did not pertain in any way to the benefactor, and the recipient was therefore not indebted to him. Such a judgment is conceivable only where organizations are formal and impersonal."1 Public institutions are particularly salient in Baghdad when seen in the context of comparable Moroccan material. Moroccan sages were very aware that the synagogues of their communities were private and not public institutions. They did not like this, and their complaints exaggerated by underplaying the role, limited though it was, that the public actually had in synagogue management (Deshen 1989, chap. 7). The Baghdadi sage Rabbi Yosef Hayim, in contrast, tells us that his people were proud of their great city, and sensitive to the honor of their community, its traditions, and officers 14. The sage does recommend certain ritual stringencies, but explicitly states that these are suggested only as acts of superior piety. 15. Comparable Moroccan rabbinical material has nothing similar to this judgment. In Moroccan Jewry the personal element is important, and it would be difficult to conceive of a sage presenting such an argument to resolve a dispute (Deshen 1989, chap. 4).</page><page sequence="15">BAGHDAD JEWRY IN LATE OTTOMAN TIMES 33 (Hayim 4: ib; Ben-Yaakob 1980a: 167-168).16 Baghdad's synagogues were of superior halakhic status, he said, using a term reserved for public institutions (batey keneset shel kerakhim) (Hayim 2:13b-14).'7 Formalization and institution-building devolved primarily on sages. In the mid-nineteenth century the Ottomans, as part of the Tanzimat reforms, created the office of hakham bashi ("chief sage"), by which they sought to tighten their hold on their subjects and weaken the old aristocracy, the lay nesi'im. The hakham bashi, appointed jointly by the authorities and notables of the community, replaced the nasi' and came to fill both religious and administrative functions. This appointment was often a source of dissent, and incumbents changed frequently.'8 Some of the sages who held the post of hakham bashi had little communal standing, but the mere fact that the role was earmarked for a sage was of significance. It added to the power of the sages, and detracted from that of the lay notables, who were represented side by side with the sages on the committee for secular affairs (vacad ha-gashmi) and the committee for religious affairs (va'ad ha-ruhani); the head of the joint committee was the hakhamn bashi. 16. Somewhat later, around 1910, in a sermon admonishing people for committing sins that he believed had caused a drought, a preacher argued that the land of Mesopotamia was in a category of unique spirituality, inferior only to that of the Holy Land. In such a land misdeeds were regarded as particularly severe (Agassi 1968:196). The preacher bewailed the decline of scholarship in his time, "Woe! In a few years we shall be like Zaku! We shall be similar to Dahok!" (Agassi 1968:240), major communities of Kurdish Jewry that served him as negative reference groups. 17. However, it is improbable that all Baghdad synagogues were public, for the nasi' probably had a private synagogue. Further, when wealthy individuals made gifts to synagogues of ritual artifacts, such as silver Torah scroll ornaments, the artifacts were named after the donors, and the synagogue managers were not permitted to dispose of them (as they would have been in the case of artifacts purchased with synagogue funds, Husen 1978:111-116). These are indications that in fact there were limitations to the public element in Baghdadi synagogues. But the sage overlooks this in his generalized characterization, the diametric opposite to the equally stylized picture that Moroccan sages offer of their situation. Limitations of the public element are evident also in some of the social roles of the community. Judges and ritual slaughterers were salaried communal officials, but the bureaucratic element was developed inconsistently. Once an official was hired, the community was not free to dismiss him or even to diminish his salary (Hayim 3:62-63, 4:21-23). Thus the office of the hired official thus did not belong exclusively to the community; it also belonged to him. 18. In one of the numerous accounts of bickering over the position of hakhanm bashi we hear of one incumbent who was forced to interrupt his sermon and leave the synagogue podium in tears (Ben-Yaakob 1980a: 168).</page><page sequence="16">34 SHLOMO DESHEN Whereas the old regime of the nesi'in was historically rooted in the community, that of the hakham bashi was largely an alien bureaucratic appointment of a particular sage. Since the appointments were often contro- versial, the new regime, in contrast to the old one, was not fully legitimate in the eyes of the community. Consequently sages who belonged to notable and wealthy families often tried to avoid being appointed to the post of hakhamn bashi. By evading this legally dubious role, they gained superior, albeit unofficial, standing within the community. This is true in particular of the leading sages of the period, Rabbis cAbdulla Somekh and Yosef Hayim, and other sages, members of the latter's family. Prior to the mid-nineteenth century, Baghdadi sages had not enjoyed this kind of standing; the community was dominated by the nasi'. But after the Tanzimat reforms, with the disappearance of the nasi" and the creation of the novel office of hakhamn bashi, the status of traditional sages who remained independent of the general authorities was enhanced. Most respected were those sages who combined aristocratic lineage and independent wealth with superior personal qualities.'9 In contrast to the nasi' of old, the hakham bashi was not usually a member of a wealthy notable family and thus did not command his own resources. He maintained his office by means of a tax on kosher meat and from endowments. Sometimes he was supported by wealthy laymen who belonged to his clique. This kind of head was new for Baghdad; the nasi' of the past had either been a man of independent wealth or had supported himself by tax-farming, so that the cost of his office was not apparent to the community. The cost of the office of the hakham bashi, however, was evident, and objections, fed by the Ottoman regime's imposition of a new military-exemption tax 19. This situation might account for a puzzling phenomenon in the Baghdad rabbinate: The nineteenth-century community had many scholars, but only two were creative in rabbinical responsa. However, the structure of leadership favored individuals who were perceived as superior. This had two effects: it inhibited other scholars from asserting themselves by volunteering responsa to rabbinical queries, and it inhibited anyone who was inferior from filling a role reserved for superiors. The following public speech made by Rabbi Shim'on Agassi, a senior sage, fifty-seven years old, after Rabbi Yosef Hayim's death in 1909, illustrates this: "Did you ever hear the faintest whisper from me in the presence of the splendor of his honor? For how could an insect squeak where the lion roars ... !? Indeed when our teacher and master, the crown on our head (peace be on him), was alive-[concerning] everything that was difficult for us ... we used to say 'Go to Joseph!' (Gen. 41:55)." This would also explain why the few Baghdad sages who were active in delivering responsa were so prolific; each wrote enough to fill several volumes. Most of the numerous Moroccan sages produced single volumes only.</page><page sequence="17">BAGHDAD JEWRY IN LATE OTTOMAN TIMES 35 that the hakham bashi collected, were frequent. Petitions circulated among the affluent; and employees, junior sages, and professionals in religious affairs (such as teachers and shohatim) demonstrated and even struck. The junior sages organized themselves sporadically. The shohatim mobilized when threatened with a loss of income, and on one occasion the synagogue cantors threatened not to blow the shofar at the New Year services. The sages fought to retain their age-old privilege of immunity from communal taxation, but in view of the weight of the new tax, and probably also because of the increase in the number of sages requesting immunity, the affluent were called upon to shoulder what they regarded as an unreasonable burden. This aroused their ire and led to unprecedented social tension. Class Formation and Secularization The latter half of the nineteenth century saw important developments in Baghdad Jewry: the creation of institutions, the shift in political elites, the crystallization of a religious stratum. We have also noted how the culture of the community was pervaded by differentiating symbols, and particularly symbols that wedded religious with material differences. The ensuing configuration of social arrangements entailed increasing stratification by social class. The nineteenth-century sources indicate only vague recognition of this reality on the part of contemporaries. Thus the 1874 correspondent for Ha-Maggid mentioned above did not conceptualize the reality he described with explicit class terms. But by the beginning of the twentieth century class formation was evident to one and all. A British consular report of 1910 written by a local Jewish employee repeatedly mentions "class" divisions within the community and "class" identities of individuals (Kedourie 1971). The use of the term is not fortuitous. A sermon delivered around the same time describes class differentiation vividly. Speaking about the community's old religious school, one of the senior sages expressed his anguish at innovations (Agassi 1968:162-163): There are now some [people] in our community who have raised an uproar about the Midrash Talmud Torah that caters to nearly 2,500 boys, learning Scripture and a little rabbinics. Most [of the boys] come from poor homes. .... [Those people] say that the Midrash consumes a vast sum [out] of the community treasury ... and the returns are not worth the expense, because most of those</page><page sequence="18">36 SHLOMO DESHEN who leave that house . .. become porters and disposers of refuse on donkeys, cleaners of latrines, and similarly despised and degrading occupations, that do not bring honor to our people (lelo kavod la'umna) and [that] also are useless to the individuals themselves (rehoqim ni-to'elet 'asmain) ... for these degraded occupations do not enable a livelihood. ... All that in contrast to the graduates of the Alliance schools . . . who know how to write, and [know] foreign languages, and make a good living, some as clerks to merchants, and [others] have themselves become big businessmen.... Therefore [those people say], "It is better for us to hand over the management of the Midrash to the Alliance!" The sage concludes with a forceful response to that suggestion: Those people should know that even if, Heaven forbid, there remain in our community (qehal 'adateinu) only the porters, disposers of garbage and clean- ers of latrines-through whom they despise us (mevazim 'otanu bahem)-we will nevertheless manage to continue and supply all the needs of this school! This reaction and the whole tenor of the speech reveal antagonism between the classes of well-to-do merchants and others, fueled by the tendency of divisions of wealth to nurture religiocultural differences. Several social classes figure in this preacher's sermons. Thus, dwelling on the sins that in his view had led to a drought in 1914, he called on his audience to mend their ways (Agassi 1968:208): If the sages do not do anything [about this] can you remain passive ... !? The Torah that the sages study protects them. [Therefore] though eventually they also will suffer from rising prices, they will not suffer as much as you .... I myself am a merchant like you. I understand your troubles. Also the wealthy do not feel all the troubles that visit us, as everyone knows.... Only you suffer from the drought . . . the high costs, and from the authorities who constantly make demands . . .why therefore do you remain lax ...? Why don't you help yourselves? How long will you go on dreaming, relying on the sages!? (Agassi 1968: 208). The preacher clearly distinguishes between three classes-ordinary mer- chants, wealthy merchants, and sages--characterized both by material and by religiocultural features, and he is poignantly aware of the tension between them.20 At the turn of the century, Baghdad's Jews were becoming increasingly cognizant of social classes. 20. The preacher, Rabbi Shim'on Agassi, categorized himself in the class of ordinary</page><page sequence="19">BAGHDAD JEWRY IN LATE OTTOMAN TIMES 37 Secularization was another major process of which they were becoming aware. Beginning in the 1870s, Baghdad correspondents for Jewish periodi- cals published in Germany, Poland, and India note instances of disregard for Orthodox Jewish practice, such as patronizing of coffeehouses and music-making on the Sabbath and, after the turn of the century, writing in commercial ledgers on the Sabbath (Yehuda 1984). In 1889 a reporter complained generally about "the discarding of the holy faith and customs" in Baghdad (cited in Ben-Yaakob 1980a:207). These desecrations do not figure as major concerns to the rabbis, however. Comparing the responsa of Rabbi Sedaqa Husen, the eighteenth-century sage, with those of the sages of the nineteenth century, one sees little difference in concerns for religiosity and Orthodox practice. The nineteenth-century sages seem to be as secure as their predecessor; apparently theirs was a stable world. In his responsa Rabbi Yosef Hayim does address problems rooted in the fact that some people practiced religion less strictly than others, but these were problems brought to him from the Baghdadi diaspora in anglicized Far Eastern enclaves, such as the community in Shanghai. Comparable material from Baghdad proper, by and large, reflects the old-time religion. In only one responsum does Rabbi Yosef Hayim (3:1) confront a problem that caused a Baghdad man to deviate from a traditional observance. But remarkably, the sage's handling of the case shows that he was unaware of the possibility that it might be of wider significance in terms of the viability of tradition in general. A pharmacist was employed together with non-Jewish colleagues, and before beginning work, he used to change his clothes (apparently to don a medical cloak). Because he wore the ritual fringed garment (talit qatan) under his shirt, his colleagues used to poke fun at him. The pious pharmacist, arguing that thereby "the holy precept (mnisva) was demeaned among the gentiles," asked for guidance. In his reply the sage implicitly absolves the man from wearing the ritual garment. He then engages in a long technical halakhic discussion about a certain solution that merchants and detached himself from the class of sages. This was rooted in the fact that there were two categories of sages, those who maintained themselves independently and those who lived off public endowments and salaries. Included among the former were the leading lights of the community; whereas the latter included the hakhanm bashi, of whom the preacher was critical (Agassi 1968:181, 243). In his categorization Rabbi Shim'on sought to associate himself with the category of sages that included men whom he revered. The significant point is the overall conceptualization of classes that pervades the sermon.</page><page sequence="20">38 SHLOMO DESHEN the pharmacist had proposed and concludes by remarking that there was much more to be said, but he could not say it for pressure of time. The atmosphere that pervades this responsum is remarkable; the sage is indifferent to the social and religious predicaments involved in the question. His imagination is fired exclusively by its technical aspect. Rabbi Yosef Hayim was no mere legalist.2? While creative in traditional Jewish learning, he also wrote and preached on a popular level, and even pub- lished folktales and sermons specifically for women. He was also a kabbalist for whom the talit qatan custom was extremely important, recommending that it never be taken off, even at night, and even during sexual intercourse (Hayim 1977:2). Yet when the practical problem posed by the pharmacist arose, the sage ruled strictly according to halakhah, which attributes little weight to the custom. The responsum reveals how unaware this leader of the community was of the sociocultural ramifications of the problem at hand, unaware of changing times.22 Even where this sage does comment on deviations from Orthodox practice, he is notably mild. In 1897 he writes: "For several years now some people have had the practice of visiting gentile coffeehouses on the Sabbath ... and drinking coffee prepared on the Sabbath. We do not protest (mohintm) loudly for various reasons. We merely advise them (mazhirimn) to consume only what was prepared prior to their coming" (Hayim 1977b:47). The sage's attitude is relaxed. He views the matter in strictly halakhic terms, and his technical advice transforms Sabbath coffeehouse patronizing into a matter of only minor halakhic import. He goes on mildly: "One should not sit in this convention of idle people on the holy Sabbath day. . . . There is much to be preached about this .... Whoever avoids going to coffeehouses ... will be blessed."23 It was only in 1908 that the rabbis asserted themselves with a 21. There is extensive biographical information on Hayim in the Ben-Yaakob volume, which served as the main source for several later publications on him. There is a preliminary analysis of Hayim's halakhic work in English (Jacobs 1978). 22. The authors of responsa sometimes abbreviate and reformulate the questions they discuss to make them devoid of details considered to be irrelevant. I suspect that this might be the case here, because the purported motive of the questioner is utterly pious. If indeed the sage considered the real-life situation so unimportant as to cut it, that would support my evaluation of Rabbi Yosef Hayim's view of secularization. 23. The analysis of Rabbi 'Abdulla Somekh's halakhic rulings by Zohar (1988) shows that a similar atmosphere pervades them. The sage confronts technological and other innovations in a relaxed way. He does not suspect that they have wider socioreligious implications. Moreover, Rabbi 'Abdulla permitted his grandson to attend the new Alliance school. We find the same</page><page sequence="21">BAGHDAD JEWRY IN LATE OTTOMAN TIMES 39 determined and articulate complaint about specific religious misdemeanors, primarily the desecration of the Sabbath for commercial activities (Ben- Yaakob 1979:372-373).24 The 1910 consular report states rather sweepingly that "in contradistinc- tion to past days the clergy enjoy no influence over their co-religionists" (Kedourie 1971:358). An illuminating sermon from 1913 adds to this. The preacher, complaining about the new ways (particularly women's dress and relaxed segregation of the sexes), calls on his audience not to rely on the sages for remedies. The latter no longer have any influence, he laments. Therefore, lay people should correct matters. In the past, the preacher explains, the sages were allied with "the rich," and the latter used to execute their directions. The two strata governed the community jointly. But now wealthy men do not devote themselves much to public affairs, but concentrate on commerce, "and since the rich are not effective, neither are the sages effective (ve-kevan she-cashirim 'en k'an, hakhamim . . . gamn ken 'en k'an)" (Agassi 1968:208-209). The preacher sees traditional self-rule falling apart, but does not rail at villains. He is notably mild. The wealthy are not described as radical or even innovative, and certainly not as heretics. He sees them just as very busy men who choose not to devote themselves to Jewish public affairs. Those whom the preacher berates are presented as part of a society that he conceives as unified, and from which he detaches neither himself nor his audience. It is possible that the people whom the preacher berated were actually in his audience. The religiosocial disintegration that is reflected in the sermon is not far-reaching. In late Ottoman times secularization was slow in coming to Baghdad and reaction to it mild. Abandonment of religious practices in Baghdad was not rabbinical attitude toward change in Europe in the early stages of secularization; it changes as the movement for innovation is bolstered by ideology. See also below n. 26. 24. The complaints are specifically about engaging in commerce and writing in ledgers on the Sabbath, but not about diffuse changes of leisure practice and life-style on the day of rest. In another source (from 1914) a sage states that there is "a rumor" that some people smoke on the Sabbath. He repeats the old complaint about people patronizing non-Jewish coffeehouses, also mentioning the consumption of forbidden food (Agassi 1968:200, 202). This indicates that when distancing from tradition did become common, it did not come abruptly and traumatically, as frequently was the case in Ashkenazic Europe at comparable stages of sociocultural change. There, within the span of only two generations, people often moved from the pole of total immersion in Jewish tradition to the pole of conversion to Christianity.</page><page sequence="22">40 SHLOMO DESHEN coupled with a supporting secular ideology and did not turn into an actual movement of secularization (Eisenstadt 1988), in contrast to the situation in Europe, where, beginning in the eighteenth century, secular ideologies and movements did develop. The Baghdadi sources reflect an unawareness of changing times. Baghdadi sages evaluated the transgressors of religious norms as people who succumbed to old-time, all-too-familiar, human failings, not as innovators; hence the mildness of their castigations. Secular schooling, in the guise of the Alliance Isra61ite system, was conceived in terms of the traditional worldview, objectionable when it clashed with religion, but not threatening in a fundamental way, the forebodings of a transformed godless world (Yehuda 1987). We come to an important conclusion: late Ottoman Baghdad Jewry, while it did undergo change, was not radically recasting itself. People perceived their community as one in which the pious were losing control; with such mutations they were familiar from their folk-culture, the Bible and rabbinic texts, and they took them in stride. Cultural change was seen as neither innovative nor threatening.25 Another conclusion concerns the social stratification of the community. The data are replete with indications that people conceived themselves as belonging to specific classes. Symbols of status dovetailed with occupations and material standing. At the same time we hear little of kinship ties, the major element of social organization in premodern societies. In contrast to the numerous indications of class differentiation in late Ottoman Baghdad, evidence that kinship was potent in public life is scarce. The relative silence of the sources on another point is also remarkable. Jewish social life, especially since the late Middle Ages, has commonly revolved around immigrant groups or quasi-ethnic groups, leading to the formation of synagogue congregations made up of people of common origin (see, for instance, Goitein, vol. 2:167). One would have expected these to appear in Baghdad, since there were many immigrants from other places, such as Persia and Kurdistan. But in all the 25. After World War I, secularization and westernization proceeded much more radically. Members of the community became attracted to a range of new ideological movements, including Zionism, communism and even theosophy. Yet at that time the religious leaders did not assert themselves energetically. This would seem to contradict my thesis, but not necessarily. The 1920s were marked by considerable emigration from Baghdad to Jerusalem, including many notable sages. Since geopolitical circumstance freed the pious from the need to make a stand, their protest was deflected by their fleeing the scene, improving themselves by going to the Holy Land. Subsequently Baghdadi sages in Jerusalem came to fill a prominent role in the Israeli religious establishment (Ben-Yaakob 1980b:356-379).</page><page sequence="23">BAGHDAD JEWRY IN LATE OTTOMAN TIMES 41 sources and secondary materials I have reviewed, there is no trace of such a development. This does not rule out the possibility that common origin or ethnicity figured here and there in social life. There may even have been some "ethnic synagogues," but the silence of the sources, in the context of what they do say, suggests that ethnicity was not a differentiating element of prime importance. So how did people in this vast community conceive themselves, and how did they organize themselves? The foregoing cluster of data clearly indicates the direction of class formation. At this point a methodological comment is called for: The published responsa and sermons contain only a few of the issues that the sages addressed. How then can we draw conclusions from them? Further, how can we attribute significance to the essentially anecdotal material that constitutes the responsa? The answer to both questions is that in a large corpus of material like the one we have been using, discussions range over a great number of topics. There are also many incidental allusions to matters that are not fully discussed. Therefore the silence of the sources about certain subjects is significant. Moreover, because sages in all traditional Jewish societies operated in the same halakhic legal system, in essentially similar sociocultural settings, features that are salient in a particular corpus of responsa are significant and warrant attention.26 The thesis of this study is based primarily on expressions of attitudes and culture that the analysis of the rabbinical sources reveals. While the latter are unequivocal, a definitive establishment of the thesis also requires positive data concerning actual socioeconomic conditions. Moving toward a fuller understanding of late Ottoman Baghdad Jewry requires placing it in its pertinent context. There are two such contexts. (1) that of contemporary Baghdad, of which the community was part; (2) that of comparable Jewish minorities in broadly similar conditions, in both Muslim and Christian societies. But the study of nineteenth-century Baghdad has not yet produced a comprehensive picture of the city as a whole. One would want to learn about mutual relations between Baghdad's diverse peoples and institutions-Jews, Muslims, European agents, and others. Studies of Jewish communities in 26. Moreover, responsa-based research is not founded only on positivistic attention to case material, but also on uncovering subtle cultural revelations that are embedded in linguistic expression and in the turns and twists of legal discussion. There are several works devoted to the methodology of sociohistorical research with rabbinical sources, most recently Soloveitchik (1990); earlier ones are referred to in Deshen (1989).</page><page sequence="24">42 SHLOMO DESHEN other parts of the Middle East show that Baghdad Jewry, of all of them, has the most consistent indications of class stratification (see Deshen and Zenner 1982). Baghdad Jewry stands at a diametrically opposite pole to Yemenite Jewry, which is the extreme case of a classless, undifferentiated Jewish society; other communities are to be found at various positions on the continuum between the poles. We need to uncover the social roots of these differences, both those that may be grounded in the circumstances of the particular environment of each Jewish society, and also those that may stem from matters internal to the subculture of each Jewish society. Both contextual settings, that of general Baghdadi society and that of Middle Eastern Jewry, invite further study. Tel Aviv University Tel Aviv, Israel References Agassi, Shim'on. 1968.
