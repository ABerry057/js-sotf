<plain_text><page sequence="1">Menachem Kellner. Maimonides on Human Perfection. Brown Judaic Studies 202. Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1990, xiv, 100 pp. Menachem Kellner. Maimonides on Judaism and the Jewish People. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1991. xii, 168 pp. In recent years Maimonides scholarship has been infused with an influx of critical works devoted to examining Maimonides' coherence as a philosopher. Menachem Kellner's two monograph-length works both fall into this camp in that each work addresses a key concern in Maimonides' philosophical theology: the first monograph is a study of Maimonides' nature of human perfection, while the second focuses upon the perfections inherent in the Jewish people. In Maimonides on Human Perfection, Kellner's position is clearly stated at the outset: that "Maimonides held that God, for His own inscrutable reasons, really and truly commanded the mitzvoth for all Jews, both the perfected among them and the unperfected" (p. xiii); and further, that Maimonides' claims at the end of the Guide for the Perplexed are clarified by this position. In order to support this contention, Kellner first distinguishes two interpretative schools: one which emphasizes the importance of practical or moral perfection in order to achieve knowledge of God, and one which emphasizes intellectual perfection. According to the intellectual reading, Maimonides' esoteric position, as intimated in the Guide, is that the "highest perfection to which humans can aspire is defined in terms of the intellect" (p. 3). Clearly, such a reading goes against the grain of classical rabbinic Judaism in upholding intellectual perfection over and above ritualistic observance. In contradistinction, the practical reading of the Guide underscores the importance of 3.54, wherein Maimonides intimates that human perfection ultimately resides in the active form of imitatio dei. But what actions or states of the Deity are we to imitate? Over the years three schools of thought have developed: those such as H. Cohen and S.</page><page sequence="2">304 BOOK REVIEWS Schwartzschild, who have emphasized emulation of God's moral qualities; those, following L. Strauss and S. Pines, who have maintained that human perfection results from emulating God's governance through creating just states; and most recently a view popularized by I. Twersky and D. Hartman, that intellectual perfection "is not in itself the final end of human existence but itself serves as a way of deepening, enriching, and elevating observance of the mitzvoth" (p. 11). Kellner's aim is to defend this latter reading of the Guide. Wisely, Kellner does not attempt a wholesale rejection of alternative readings; aptly noting that Maimonides "did too good a job of hiding his true views" (p. 11), Kellner conceives his task as finding that interpretation which "does as little violence as possible to the texts he left us and is as consistent as possible with everything we know of the man" (p. 11). The key to Kellner's reading resides in his interpretation of Maimonides' extended parable found in Guide 3:51-54. According to Kellner, the purpose of these chapters is primarily religious, namely to move human beings to worship God in appropriate ways. The question which has perplexed critics for centuries is how Maimonides envisions this worship: is it to be achieved halakhically, or can the true philosopher transcend the strictures of halakhah? Rejecting "secularist" or "naturalist" readings of the Guide which interpret Maimonides as suggesting (albeit esoterically) that philosophers can ultimately attain a greater level of perfection than halakhists, Kellner proffers a "new interpretation of the parable" which downplays not only the role of natural science but that of simple moral perfection as well. Kellner argues that the parable pertains to Jews alone: nowhere does Maimonides allow for imitatio dei on the part of non-Jews. Although moral perfection, which is a necessary but not sufficient prerequisite for intellectual perfection, is open to non-Jews, Kellner claims that Maimonides "was extremely dubious about the possibility of a non-Jew achieving the sort of moral perfection necessary for intellectual perfection" (p. 28). So too is prophecy limited de facto to Jews. Kellner does assent that his reading, which echoes that of Twersky, depends upon an elusive and highly enigmatic interpretation of Maimonides' theories of creation and providence. For if, as many scholars have argued in recent years, it is claimed that Maimonides upheld a naturalistic theory of both creation of the universe and divine providence, then Maimonides' statements pertaining to human perfection will just as readily lend themselves to a naturalistic, even political interpretation. While not offering a fully developed critique of this latter position, Kellner hints at why he finds</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 305 the politicized readings of L. Berman and Pines unfaithful to Maimonides' adherence to halakhic perfection. In light of this issue, Kellner turns in Maimonides on Judaism and the Jewish People to a related question, namely the extent to which Jews are ontologically distinct from Gentiles. This question has had far-reaching implications not only in the context of medieval theories of election, prophecy, and immortality; the ramifications of this issue are felt to this very day in modem debates over "who is a Jew." Kellner rightly places this religious issue squarely within the context of philosophical psychology. Summarizing the differences between the Platonic and Aristotelian theories of the origin and structure of the human soul, he claims that "if the Aristotelian position commits one to a measure of universalism, then [Platonism] commits one to a measure of particularism" (p. 5). Particularism, which emphasizes essential metaphysical differences between Jew and Gentile, carries with it adverse consequences pertaining to conversion; for if Jews are metaphysically distinct from Gentiles, then clearly conversion to Judaism is not possible, either at present or in the Messianic period. Kellner's thesis is that Maimonides is an Aristotelian on this issue, and that in contradistinction to Halevi, Maimonides downplays metaphysical differences between Jew and Gentile in favor of a universalist attitude. In support of this thesis Kellner argues that prophecy and providence, according to Maimonides, are not limited to Jews (p. 26); that immortality is dependent upon intellectual perfection, and not simply upon being a Jew (p. 30); that differences between Jew and Gentile will disappear by the Messianic age (p. 35); that knowing God is the "peak and pinnacle of metaphysics ... also the purpose and goal of human [not Jewish] life" (p. 37); that being a Jew is defined by one's theological beliefs and not by biology (p. 63); and that inasmuch as descent from Abraham is a religious and not a biological matter, conversion is therefore metaphysically possible (p. 50). As Kellner so aptly puts it, what distinguishes Jews from Gentiles, according to Maimonides, lies in their software: "in terms of their 'hardware' all human beings are alike" (p. 57). In short, whether one is a Jew is defined "by the doctrines he or she holds" (p. 65). What doctrines are these? In chapter 8, Kellner suggests that they comprise those clusters of beliefs presupposed by ma'aseh bereshit and ma'aseh merkavah, physics and metaphysics. In this second work Kellner has characterized a tantalizing picture of Maimonides as a champion of liberal universalism, according to whom differences between Jew and Gentile will ultimately be erased. And yet</page><page sequence="4">306 BOOK REVIEWS a nagging question remains: if Kellner's interpretation is followed, then why, according to Maimonides, are Gentiles so far removed from human perfection in this life? Why can't the non-Jew achieve the sort of ultimate perfection described in Kellner's first monograph, especially if s/he has been inculcated with proper beliefs concerning metaphysics and natural science? Have we yet another contradiction in Maimonides' writings? Or have we here a contradiction in Kellner's reading? While not answering these queries fully, Kellner's works serve as a handsome reminder that Maimonides once again has provided us with timely discussions of perennial philosophical questions. Tamar M.
