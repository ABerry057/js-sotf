Notre Dame, IN: Notre Dame University Press, xviii, 430 pp. doi:10.1017/S0364009408001335 In The Twilight of the Idols, Friedrich Nietzsche describes how corporeal disgust, that is, repulsion from bodily features such as appearance, smell, color, health state, and so on, is ultimately used to invoke hatred. However, Nietzsche says, one can only really hate that which is essentially similar, and one can only be threatened by that which is too close: "what does man hate? He hates the twilight of his own type." Alexandra Cuffel's book, which is an expansion of her doctoral dissertation, presents an attempt to explore the evocation of corporeal disgust as a central dimension of late antique and medieval religious polemic as a way of evoking hatred to the other. Like Nietzsche (whom Cuffel herself does not refer to), the author believes that it is the "dangerous" proximity?physical as well as mental?between different religious groups (mostly Christians and Jews) that generates the incessant attempts to attribute filth, disease, and ugliness to the "opponents" as a means of defining and solidifying the boundaries of each group. 2. Ibid., 83. 427</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Cuffel's preliminary supposition is that different religious groups (pagans, Christians, and Jews in late antiquity; Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the Euro pean medieval period) have largely shared the same cultural universe: They were influenced by the same medical and philosophical traditions and drew from the same pool of images and symbols. Part of this shared cultural universe, Cuffel argues, consisted of two major concerns that all these groups had in common: One, they were all deeply disconcerted about "being in a body" and despised the corporeal dimension of human existence; two, for all of them, the epitome of the horror and abjection was the female body, particularly the menstruating female body. Throughout the book, Cuffel discusses the ways in which, based on this common ground, religious groups have abased and slandered each other, identifying the other as entirely "corporeal" and, by and by, also as afflicted with the wretchedness of femininity. For instance, Christians claimed that Jewish men menstruate, whereas Jews mocked Jesus for spending time in the filthy womb of a woman; Jews claimed that Christians are prone to leprosy because they have intercourse during the woman's menstrual period, while Chris tians, in turn, claimed that Jews are prone to leprosy because they are not baptized, as well as a punishment for killing Jesus. All, or at least most, of these mutual "accusations," Cuffel asserts, are directed inward rather that outward: They are meant to convince the respective believers that they are "on the right path" and to prevent a possible obfuscation of boundaries rather than to attack "real" reli gious opponents. The first part of the book is dedicated to late antiquity and attempts to explore the conceptual and textual infrastructure of contempt of the body as it is constructed in late antique sources and is already applied in early polemical texts. The second part focuses on Europe in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and discusses at length the prevalent themes of religious polemical writings from that period: Jesus' and Mary's corporeality, physical deformity and diseases, and images related to animalistic character. The abundance of sources that Cuffel has assembled is impressive, as is her mastery of the languages (Latin, Hebrew, and Arabic) of the texts she deals with and the intricacies of their different genres. The book is extremely useful for anyone who is interested in the intersection of religious cultures and the body, and Cuffel should be commended for her brave choice to give such serious and extensive treatment to what could be mistakenly seen as a negligible, even "sordid" subject. Nevertheless, the greatest advantage of this book is also its greatest disad vantage: It aims to encompass a huge amount of material, and thus it is bound to make gross generalizations and ignore complexities and intracultural dialectics. For example, her overall claims about renunciation of the body and repulsion from it widely ignore the fact that in both Jewish and Christian texts, the body is con stantly negotiated not only as a source of weakness or a manifestation of the "low" but also as a source of power, even of mediating the divine. The works of Daniel Boyar?n and Caroline Walker Bynum, to take just one example for each "religion," show that any attempt to suggest a simple "bottom line" regarding the body as it is constructed in religious corpora is problematic. Further, Cuffel is incautious in her 428</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews use of the word "purity" and does not seem to distinguish between the biblical notion of ritual purity and the use of the word "purity" as a conveyor of a desired moral or aesthetic state. The same word is, in fact, used in both meanings in various Jewish sources, as demonstrated by Jonathan Klawans's Impurity and Sin in Ancient Judaism.l But the concept of ritual impurity is a world unto itself that cannot be simply molded into the more common use of the word. Such con cerns notwithstanding, alongside detailed studies that look closely at limited corpora, there is also use and value in broader monographs, such as Cuffel's, that attempt to present large-scale cultural phenomena. Some of the shortcomings of the book could nevertheless be avoided by more careful editing. First, the book is abundant with repetitions. Clearly, all of the themes Cuffel discusses are interconnected, and the same ideas are bound to arise over and over again, but a more elegant solution to these redundancies is con ceivable. Second, I must admit that the attempt to incorporate Islam into the book seems somewhat forced. As Cuffel herself attests, not only is there quite a small amount of polemical Muslim texts at our disposal, but Muslims also seem to employ much less "disgust" in their writings. While some Christian anti Muslim texts (especially regarding the occupation of the holy places in Jerusalem) include some motives of disgust, the social and geographic distance from the Muslim world makes Islam much less relevant to Cuffel's discussion. She might better have only focused on Christian-Jewish polemic, which is essentially what most of the book is about anyway. What I found ultimately disappointing in this helpful and interesting book, was that it does not provide us with any substantial insights into the notion of disgust as such and on the body as a marker of identity in general. Cuffel seems to maintain that bodily disgust is essentially an unsophisticated form of derogation; she does not deal with questions such as where and how the "low" become danger ous, and how the body becomes a mode of expression of identity. In Chapter 5 (which is the best chapter in the book, in my opinion), she touches on these ques tions but does not develop her attempt at answering them into a profound discussion. In sum, I am certain that Gendering Disgust is a book that anyone working on religious discourses of the body and purity will return to and derive much use of in the future. Its valuable materials are still, however, in want of further theoretical and analytical development. Mira Balberg Stanford University Stanford, California 1.
