In this article I explore a con- cealed dialogue, or perhaps more accurately, a dialogue that has been condemned to silence, on that subject. My analysis follows in the path of Judith Hauptman's research, among others.1 Hauptman discussed the relationships among different halakhic sources that address the issue of a woman's obligation to procreate. She demonstrated that the Tosefta - a source redacted relatively late - preserves an early halakhic tradition that presumed men and women to be under equal obligation.2 Conver- sely, the Mishnah, which was edited earlier than the Tosefta, deliberately redacts the tradition so that halakhic discourse negates the woman's role in pro- creation and presumes that the purpose of marriage is for the man to fulfill the commandment of pru urvu (be fruitful and multiply). Such seems to be the case, for the Mishnah in Yevamot 6:6 states r 'iv ^ tnw ivm nay nrrori r'm Ktw Wi 1PK - "If one married a woman and remained with her ten years and This article is based on a lecture presented at the 41st annual conference of the AJS in Los Angeles (December 2009). I would like to express my gratitude to professors Jeffrey L. Rubenstein, Michael L. Satlow, and Aharon Shemesh for their input. I would also like to thank Beit Shalom Kyoto Japan for their financial support and Meshulam Gotlieb for ably translating this article. 1 .

Hauptman, Rereading the Rabbis, 133-34, writes: "The Tosefta then adds that men and women are obligated to marry and forbidden to make themselves sterile or choose a spouse who is known to be incapable of procreation ... the Tosefta, throughout its discussion of this topic, holds that women, too, are obligated to procreate." I think that Hauptman's claim regarding the Tosefta's atti- tude toward women and marriage should be revisited, for not only does the Tosefta imply that women are also obligated to procreate, but also that marriage has value in and of itself ("A man may not live without a woman nor may a woman live without a man" [T. Yevamot 8:4]). This notwithstanding, the Tosefta does concur that if the marriage is childless, the couple should divorce so that both spouses (the husband, and the wife as well) may have children. 23</page><page sequence="2">Arnon Atzmon had no children, he is not permitted to refrain [from procreating]." According to the Mishnah, a man must fulfill this commandment; should this prove impossible in his current marriage, he must marry another woman, and apparently must divorce his current wife.3 In this article, I will delineate a process similar to Hauptman's. However, unlike Hauptman, I will focus on aggadic sources. These sources simultaneously conduct a dialogue along two distinct axes: an aggadic-halakhic axis, namely with the Mishnah, and an aggadic-aggadic one, linking the sources themselves. Michael L. Satlow, Daniel Boyarin, Adiel Schremer, and Admiel Kosman have already addressed the topic of dialogue between aggadic sources and the Mishnah.4 While my approach may differ from theirs in both major and minor ways, my primary goal is to address the second axis, the dialogue between the two aggadic sources. Two sources in the Midrash Aggadah contain parallel versions of a narrative homily that cites and addresses the substance of the relevant Mishnah.5 This Mishnah rules that a man cannot neglect his obligation to procreate, and implies a solution should he find himself in a childless marriage after ten years. The homily contains a story about a couple from Saida6 who found themselves in such a situation, but surprises us by not ending in the way the Mishnah would have us expect. In both sources, the narrative homily addresses the halakhic citation and sheds new light on it. The interaction between halakhah and Aggadah in rabbinic sources most frequently takes place within halakhic contexts, for example in the Talmudic sugyot , where aggadic segments are embedded within halakhic discussions. These types of interactions have received a great deal of critical attention, 3. Whether or not the husband must divorce his wife according to the Mishnah has been the focus of some debate. Hauptman, Rereading the Rabbis, 131, has suggested that the Mishnah is most likely instructing the man to have children with another woman either through divorcing this wife and remarrying or by taking a second wife in addition to his present one. A third putative sugges- tion, which is that the Mishnah is merely instructing him to keep trying to procreate with his present wife, is somewhat surprising, given that barring some other option of course he would do so. Further- more, this possible reading is undermined by the next line in the Mishnah, which discusses the woman's status should he divorce her. It should be stressed, however, that whatever the original meaning of the Mishnah, the aggadic sources discussed in this article - such as the talmudic sages - clearly assume that according to the Mishnah the couple should get divorced after ten childless years, so procreation takes priority over the couple's relationship. 4.

A comparative analysis of the sources' content and structure shows that the original homily is preserved in Midrash Shir Hashirim Rabbah, which is actually considered the later of the two works, while the homily in Pesikta de-Rav Kahana, the earlier source, is actually reworked.8 The narrative derasha in the latter work is restructured to match the halakhic rhetoric of the Mishnah. The woman is deposed from her central role in the story as well as from her elevated status in the marital framework9. In Shir-Hashirim Rabbah 1 :2, an aggadic narrative is imposed on the verse in nnttwn n1?^ to interpret its words as an expression of the love between the nation of Israel and God. Within the homily itself is a reference to the Mishnah cited earlier, and a story is told in the name of Rabbi Idi and is connected to this Mishnah. The reference to the Mishnah in this midrash serves a similar purpose to that of the reference to a "verse from afar" in the petihta (proem) style of classical midrashic works. In classical petihtaot , a reference to biblical verses from afar creates an intertextual relationship between different texts, engen- dering a tension that serves as the core for a homily. Here too, the reference to the Mishnah creates an intertextual link between the verse being expounded and the halakhic source. This generates tension and is the basis for the homily. The inter- preted verse expresses, in its biblical context, an expression of love between a woman and her mate that has value in and of itself, whereas the halakhic source views marriage pragmatically as a tool for fulfilling man's obligation to procreate. Let us follow the narrative homily's development as a function of the tension between the verse and the halakhah. The story begins with the words ntZWfc rftyn us nwy nnrnzw irsn nn« (There was a case of a woman in Saida, who remained ten years with her husband and did not give birth). The story is about a woman. In choosing this formulation, the darshan focuses our attention on the woman's perspective. As opposed to the mishnaic formulation that focuses on the "man who married a woman and remained with her" (nt&amp;K Kttft 7. Jeffrey L.

The English translation of Shir Hashirim Rabbah is based on Boyarin's translation in Carnal Israel , with a few of my own minor modifications. The Hebrew text of Pesikta de-Rav Kahana is that of the Mandelbaum edition (New York: JTS, 1962). The variant readings recorded in Mandel- baum's apparatus are, in my opinion, insignificant since they appear in only one manuscript (lx - Oxford, Bodleian Library, 2339, Cat. Neubauer), which apparently reflects the scribe's attempt to adapt his text to Shir Hashirim Rabbah. The English translation of Pesikta de-Rav Kahana is based on the Braude-Kapstein edition (Philadelphia: JPS, 1975) with a few of my own minor modifications. 25</page><page sequence="4">Arnon Atzmon ntti? nntm), here it is the woman who has waited and not given birth. Hence, the problem goes beyond the man's inability to fulfill the commandment to procreate. Ha rr xponra1? ^nv p ymw 'n m yinx (They came before Rabbi Shimon Ben Yohai; they requested to get divorced one from the other) - the couple, who seem to understand that they have a halakhic problem, come before Rashbi and apparently request that he initiate their divorce. It is worth noting that the words THE literally mean to release them from each other, namely, from their distress.10 As I understand it, they are not only requesting the rabbi's assistance with the technicalities of getting divorced, but rather are fer- vently asking him to help resolve the complicated predicament in which they, as a couple, find themselves. Rashbi then gives the couple guidelines that are not, in essence, halakhic: nrix "pK "p nnram nr1? nr onim ntf/D TD"n Tin1? "iax nnwai lino x^x rrunDna (On your lives, just as you came together to each other with feasting and drinking, so too you should not part without feasting and drinking). It seems to me that Rashbi is attempting to ease the couple's way into the divorce process. The goal of the unusual discussion is to help them inter- nalize the insight that the divorce will allow them to rebuild their lives and will provide them with a new opportunity to procreate, as had been their intention.11 It seems that the guidelines are effective, for the husband, when he proceeds to become drunk, is able to quite literally "settle his mind" and is able to initiate the divorce procedure in a loving and generous manner:12 to"*' psy1? 1W1 VD17S ysn nn -to rf7 -iax rto iron nMrmw tpd ,'X7» mr irrawi nhm nnyo lwsn Tax tpm ^ aw aita (They followed his suggestion, and they made for themselves a festival and a feast, and she got him too drunk. When his mind was settled he said to her, "My daughter, see any good object that I have in this house. Take it and go to your father's house"). However, the woman still refuses to accept the notion of "separating" from him, and she demonstrates this through her actions: nnas?1? nrai nrix1? xtt nnwy no xax rprf? lmrrVim mix inpi ntm lmxw orb maxi rrmnDwVi (What did she do?

The husband's state of inebriation paradoxically allows his wife to express her determined opposition. When he is once again sober, she even explicitly declares this to him: rr9 max "pm ^x pvi to n1? ibn «Tn»n as7 tpd rrnawa nm 10.

In this, I disagree with other scholars who believe that the party was meant to bring the couple together. In my opinion, this reading is more applicable to the parallel derasha in Pesikta de-Rav Kahana. 12. My understanding of the phrase insn mWTti as signifying the husband's entering a relaxed state of mind and tranquil mood under the influence of the wine parallel's Simon's translation (p. 49) "feeling then in a good humour," and Neusner's translation (p. 89) "his mind was at ease." Boyarin's translation of the phrase as "his sensibility returned to him" is problematic because he understands the phrase to mean that the husband "became sober," a phenomenon that is actually described later in the story by the phrase ir1 ID (see note 13 below). 26</page><page sequence="5">"The Wise Woman from Saida" vrna ww aiw y an myn ^ max id x^i max ,tox rrn1? ^ he n1? i&amp;x xnx rrm ■pa mv tfnyn ^ aits px Tax rrn1?

He said, "What am I doing in your father's house?" She said to him, "Did you not say to me this very evening, 'Any good object which you have in your house, take and go to your father's house'? There is no object in the world which is better for me than you!"). The term hefetz here holds dual meaning. In the mouth of the husband it means "object," but for the wife it refers to her deepest and most fundamental desire. In contrast to the story of Rachel in the Bible, wherein Rachel declares, "Give me children and if not I shall die" (implying that marriage and life are meaningless without children), in this story the wife's primary objective in marriage is to maintain a relationship with her husband. The husband seems to internalize his wife's lesson, and together they return to Rashbi. At this point, Rashbi adopts a new approach, not taking on the role of a halakhic decisor as he did before, but rather taking on the role of a tzaddik who prays for those who have turned to him for help: npa: n arr^y wi p m ^sx nri? lD^n (They went to Rabbi Shimon Ben Yohai. He stood and prayed for them, and they were remembered). While the darshan mentions Rashbi 's role and prayers in the salvation of the couple, nnpy onpis hx mips; 7pi d nMnpn na TTaV7 (To teach you that just as God helps sterile women, so too do the righteous help sterile women), the woman's actions are the main concern, for they lead to the couple's preservation: mtD rbwi pan ^ *px utodw cm -i&amp;xw ^y nn nun nx -iaim *?p anm nm V'Dxy nnx x*?x tf?iy:i aio pan t»x nnaixi nv ton n"npn nvwh D*on&amp;n Sxuzp ,vrpM (Indeed, all the more so, if a flesh and blood said to his fellow flesh and blood, "There is no object in the world which is better for me than you," were saved, Israel who are waiting for the God's salvation every day, and say, "There is no object in the world which is better for me than you," how much more so!). The darshan concludes by citing the verse with which he began: "p nnatWl "nn . The woman's commitment to her marital relationship is compared to the commit- ment between the nation of Israel and God. The darshan seems to experience the tension existing between the halakhic statement - which primarily defines marriage as a tool for the male's fulfillment of the mitzvah of procreation - and the biblical-aggadic notion that places love at the center of the (marital) relationship, an idea expressed by the woman from Saida.13 The woman in the story challenges the halakhah by teaching her husband and Rashbi - who represents the law - that the halakhah is not applicable when it con- tradicts the woman's feelings of love, and certainly should not be implemented in a sweeping or forceful way.14 13. Note that as mentioned above in note 2, even if the Mishnah itself does not demand that the couple divorce, it clearly favors procreation over the couple's relationship. The author of the midrash clearly felt this tension, as indicated by his starting assumption that the couple should divorce. 14. Boyarin (above, note 4) asks: "Why are we told that 'she got him too drunk,' and then, 'when his sensibility returned to him, he said ... ?' ... Note that it is impossible to understand this 27</page><page sequence="6">Arnon Atzmon A look at a parallel version of the derasha in Midrash Pesikta de-Rav Kahana, the earlier work, reveals a different picture, one in which the tension between the halakhah in the Mishnah and the love reflected by the verse is never stressed. The story lacks the tragic-romantic undertones found above, and the Rabbis mute what- ever challenge there might be to the halakhah by having Rashbi himself take up the potentially subversive argument aimed at saving the marriage. In fact, though Rashbi may hint to the woman that there is a way to save her marriage, this does not grant her a voice, status in the marriage, or even necessarily imply the validity of a marriage containing love and a relationship but not children. Indeed, the marriage only con- tinues because Rashbi takes the initiative, using both his wisdom and prayers to give the couple's marriage a second chance.15 The text begins: nan •psnv inx yw ... [24 r vp n,l7nri] in nn»»ai *&gt;"•* rtm arn nr -p [4 x wffrro] in nnattfai nV^a wtdi nzftw xnv,n"npnn dki nvn dn -wi irx mV kVi ww nay r'm xm pn irarn-o ... irmra ?P-ps In this version, which commences with a verse from Psalms, the verse from Song of Songs is not set up in petihta format to contrast with the Mishnah. Indeed, the drunkenness as that which resulted in his being so sleepy that he didn't detect that he was being first carried off, because that sleep takes place after he has recovered from his drunkenness." Then he suggests: "That the story delicately hints that they made love while he was drunk, and that during inter- course they realized that they loved each other too much to allow the halakhah to separate them" (54). As explained in note 12, in my opinion, not only does the phrase insn mtZPTia not mean the same thing as 11" as, but it actually means that he was influenced by the wine he drank. Boyarin also writes, "More- over, this seems to have been the Rabbi's plan," as implied by the sexual connotation of the term Dminn 55). Again, in my opinion this conclusion is open to dispute, since Rashbi's instruction may best be understood within the rubric of the halakhic norm, as I explained above. Aside from these details, I tend to agree with the basic thrust of Boyarin's analysis that "This legend may encode a moment of tension between a voice for which procreation was perceived as the sole or the overridingly important telos of marriage and one for which companionship was becoming increasingly important" (55). However, in my analysis, that tension does not negate the fundamental halakhic norm expressed by the Mishnah; it merely gives rise to the conclusion that the norm should not be implemented in a sweep- ing or forceful way. Satlow also referred to the story's ambivalence regarding the halakhah's demand that the couple divorce. In his analysis, the feast was meant to "reawaken the woman's desire for her husband, and it is this desire that ultimately leads to her conceiving." He notes that "in this understanding of the story, the purpose of a wife's desire for her husband is not to maintain a 'good' marriage but to increase procrea- tion. Ultimately, her 'desire' is irrelevant to the maintenance of her marriage. By conceiving she removes the halakhic compulsion for divorce" (76-77). In my opinion, the story's main theme is the wife's love for her husband, not her "desire" for him. 15. See Judith R. Baskin, "Rabbinic Reflections on the Barren Wife," Harvard Theological Review 82, no. 1 (1989): 101-1 14, which quotes the story from Pesikta de-Rav Kahana and concludes that in cases of childlessness, the rabbis preferred prayer as a potential remedy and discouraged divorce. 28</page><page sequence="7">"The Wise Woman from Saida" Mishnah is cited merely to explain the verse from Song of Songs (which has been cited to explain the verse from Psalms). The homily of the man and the woman follows the Mishnah in order to illustrate it, not to contradict it. Thus, in contrast to the parallel version in which the woman's voice is stressed - rrtr xV) rfan us tws nnntzw Trxn rm ntiNC hote - in this account the story begins by emphasizing the man's predicament: THNl mV' ww iot nay Nnwi n m Ntww (There was a case in Saida of one who married a woman and remained with her ten years and she did not give birth). As in the Mishnah, Hfty nnun nttfN KtZft, the man's difficulty in performing the mitzvah of procreation takes center stage, and the woman's voice is silenced; no challenge is issued to the regnant halakhah. The couple itself (particularly the husband) does not exhibit the poignant be- havior found in Shir Hashirim Rabbah. When the husband and wife consult Rashbi, they do not ask him to separate them "from one another" as they did in Shir Hashirim Rabbah; rather, they come to follow the law and to obtain a divorce: npnnwtf? Tir p '"I •'rub finx. Moreover, in this version the husband does not need to become inebriated to initiate the divorce process through his words *0*71 lrnx Tirn ^ trw fan ,rf7 'x (He said to her, "Any object that I have in this house. Take it and go to your father's house"). Rather, he makes his declaration immediately upon meeting Rashbi. The husband also does not endearingly tell his wife to take "a precious object." He refers, instead, to just "an object." Most significantly, in this version it is Rashbi who adopts the potentially subversive position, championing continuation of the marriage. He does this in an unexpected way that seems intended to prevent its dissolution: '"i on1? 'X "pna x*?x n to nr "pirns Dnx *px id nprai *7Dxa Tina nramnw nm •'xrrr p npWttl *7DXB (Rabbi Shimon Ben Yohai said to them, "Just as you came together with feasting and drinking, so too you should not part without feasting and drink- ing"). After Rashbi offers his advice - the purpose of which is to prevent the divorce - the woman understands what is expected of her and acts accordingly: rrn'? imx max i nnriDW1? nta-n "7a "lnr irranzn rftra rrrao riro ,n ws m xnx (What did she do? She prepared a great feast, and she got him too drunk). The husband's inebriation in this version sheds no light on his mental status; it only enables his wife to carry out her plans and express her love to him. This differs from the version in Shir Hashirim Rabbah; there, the role of the husband's drunkenness is more complex as it both sheds light on his mental status by enabling him to initiate the divorce procedure in a loving manner and allows his wife to show her determined opposition to receiving a divorce. The description of the husband waking up is similar in each version. However, even though the husband has presumably internalized his wife's message, in this rendition the couple does not romantically unite and return to Rashbi, as they do in Shir Hashirim Rabbah. The voice has been taken away from the woman and, by extension, the couple. Rashbi, having championed the marriage, hears about the outcome of his plan and takes the next step: TPS npDnn ,"p Trr p iiyaw '-i mwo (since Rabbi Shimon Ben Yohai heard it, he prayed for them, and they were remembered). Rashbi realizes that 29</page><page sequence="8">Arnon Atzmon his plan has been successful and now believes that the conditions are ripe for his prayers, which will enable the couple finally to procreate. The darshan , in this version, focuses solely on the role of Rashbi, anpiD av^sm nnpy 7plD rfnpn nnpy (God helps sterile women, and the righteous help sterile women) and makes no further mention of the words spoken by the wife to her husband, thus de-emphasizing the importance of love in their relationship. The forced connection between the homily and the concluding verse from Isaiah, which reads xiN nmaw nfcty an ito a» n»i -iaim bp onmn nm n"apn bw raw1? a'Dxa .nasi n&amp;D nnx by nbmv m nmb 'pn Kirrtio ,ton HftDl nttD nnx by, (Indeed, all the more so, if a flesh and blood is able to rejoice and bring joy to everybody, when God will come to bring joy to Jerusalem, how much more so. And Israel who for so many ages have been looking forward to deliverance by God, how much more so!) is another indication of the secondary nature of the version found in Pesikta de-Rav Kahana.16 In conclusion, it is Pesikta de-Rav Kahana, the composition that was redacted earlier and is usually ascribed to perhaps the fifth century in the land of Israel, which brings the reworked and secondary text. Shir Hashirim Rabbah, which is the later, seventh-century redaction, preserves the earlier text, the one more challenging from a halakhic perspective.17 The originary nature of the derasha in Shir Hashirim Rabbah is attested to not only by the principle of lectio difficilio 18 but also by additional structural elements that are not strictly relevant to our discussion.19 This narrative homily underwent a redaction prompted by the desire to make it comply with the legal rhetoric of the Mishnah and the accepted halakhic norms of the time.20 In this process, the woman was removed from her central place in the story and from her status within the marital framework. That Rashbi saved the marriage does not imply 1 6. These words appear verbatim as a formulaic conclusion to the first passage of that Pesikta. There the words function most appropriately as a connecting link between the passage's central theme - Sarah's joy after giving birth and the feast that she gave, and the verse "Rejoicing in the Lord I give joy" (Isaiah 61:10). The redactor's use of this formula here clearly seems secondary in nature. 1 7. Presumably the story originated as some kind of a folk legend and later was adapted to serve a halakhic function. This presumption may find support in Midrash Pesikta Rabbati (Piska 30, Nahamu Nahamu, 141) where we find the same basic story told in parable form, without its familiar halakhic connotations (see Ofra Meir, "Ha-nuschaot ha-yehudiyot shel hatipus hasipuri A.T. 875," Yedt a-am: bamah le-folklor yehudi 45 [1979]: 55-61). 18. The term is usually used in the field of text criticism; here I use it metaphorically to mean that in order to determine which source was the original, we may assume that the earlier version of the text underwent a process of standardization to conform to normative rulings. In our case, the normative law is found in the Mishnah and reflected in Pesikta de-Rav Kahana, while Shir Hashirim Rabbah pre- serves the earlier unstandardized version. 19. Among them, the anonymous citation of the story, and the fact that the second passage - which has a proem format in Shir Hashirim Rabbah - nriD "pm '~i followed by a verse from afar (Psalms) - loses this structure in the Pesikta: "pDN "fx and so forth. 20. While I have not offered external proof that at the time of the homily's redaction the regnant halakhah dictated that the husband should divorce his wife in such a case, given the beginning of the Pesikta this would seem most probable. Indeed, if this was not the case, the Pesikta's assumption that they should get divorced is surprising, to say the least. 30</page><page sequence="9">"The Wise Woman from Saida" his championing of the woman's voice or her status; it is the combination of his wisdom and his prayer that gives the marriage a second chance.21 The process described here is analogous to that depicted by Hauptman in her analysis of the relationship between the Mishnah in Yevamot and the Tosefta that parallels it. In the aggadic sources as well, the earlier and more authoritative source is actually reworked to accommodate the story to the prevailing halakhic norms. Moreover, the earlier source silences the subversive "other" voice that is heard in the original homily. Perhaps such a step did not need to be taken in the later and less authoritative source, for Shir Hashirim Rabbah by its very nature was less threatening. However, it seems to me that the voice calling out from the Aggadah (preserved in Shir Hashirim Rabbah) and the dialogue, which that Aggadah has with the mishnaic halakhah, ring out crystal clear. Even though authoritative sources attempted to silence this voice and consign its argument to oblivion, it seems quite likely that the Aggadah made its mark on halakhic practice throughout history. Indeed, the halakhic establishment, contra the Mishnah, traditionally did not force childless couples to divorce.22 Arnon Atzmon Bar-Ilan University Ramat-Gan, Israel 2 1 . Schremer, who discussed this version of the homily, claimed that "This story bears a clear message of social-cultural criticism, on the halakhic demand to dissolve the bond of marriage since the obligation to procreate was not fulfilled there. That halakhah is cruel in the view of the author, and morally distorted. In his opinion the purpose of having children is only one aspect of the marriage, but there is also the aspect of the love that exists between the married couple" (Schremer, Zakhar u-nekevah , 3 1 7). In Schremer's opinion, the author criticizes Rashbi, as a representative of the Hala- khah, for only responding to the couple's distress by praying for them at the end of the story, when he could and should have done so earlier. In my opinion, Shremer's reading is open to dispute, especially as it applies to the Pesikta's version. As I have demonstrated, the Pesikta's version harmonizes the mishnaic halakhah with the story far more than Shir Hashirim Rabbah does. Furthermore, as I have shown, the author actually praises Rashbi for taking the initiative and ultimately praying for the couple, as praying for them before they went through the process would have not been efficacious (cf. Ido Hevroni, "The Midrash as Marriage Guide," Azure 29 [2007]: 103-120). 22. Cf. Benjamin Lau, "The Two Objectives of the Institution of Marriage," Milin Havivin 3 (2007): 52-67. 31</page><page sequence="10">Arnon Atzmon Appendix 1 - The sources in English translation Shir Hashirim Rabbah 1 :2 We will rejoice and be happy with you [Song of Solomon 1 :4] There we have taught: If a man mar- ried a woman and remained with her ten years and had no children, he is not permitted to refrain. Rabbi Idi Said: There was a case of a woman in Saida, who remained ten years with her husband and did not give birth. They came before Rabbi SKimon Ben Yohai; they requested to get divorced one from the other. He said to them, "On your lives, just as you came together to each other with feasting and drinking, so too you should not part without feasting and drinking." They followed his suggestion, and they made for themselves a festival and a feast, and she got him too drunk. When his mind was settled he said to her, "My daughter, see any good object that I have in this house. Take it and go to your father's house." What did she do? When he was asleep, she told her slaves and maid- servants and she said to them, "Lift him in the bed and take him and bring him to the house of [my] father." In the middle of the night he woke up. When his wine had worn off, he said to her, "My daughter, where am I?" She said, "In father's house." He said, "What am I doing in your father's house?" Pesikta de-Rav Kahana 22 This is the day which the Lord made; we will rejoice and be glad in it [Psalms 118] As we have taught there: If one mar- ried a woman and remained with her ten years and had no children, he is not permitted to refrain from pro- creation.... There was a case in Sida of one who married a woman and remained with her ten years and she did not give birth. They came before Rabbi Shi- mon Ben Yohai to get divorced. He said to her, "Any object that I have in this house. Take it and go to your father's house."Rabbi Shimon Ben Yohai said to them, "Just as you came together with feasting and drinking, so too you should not part without feasting and drinking." What did she do? She prepared a great feast, and she got him too drunk. And she gave a sign to her slave girl and said to her, "Bring him to the house of [my] father." In the middle of the night he woke up. He said to her, "Where am I?" She said to him, "Did you not say to me, 'Any object which you have in your house, take and go to your father's house'? There is no better object for me than you!" Since Rabbi Shimon Ben Yohai heard it, he prayed for them, and they were remembered [they had children]. God helps sterile women, and the righteous help sterile women. 32</page><page sequence="11">"The Wise Woman from Saida" Appendix 1 - (contd.) Shir Hashirim Rabbah 1 :2 She said to him, "Did you not say to me this very evening, 'Any good object which you have in your house, take and go to your father's house'? There is no object in the world which is better for me than you!' They went to Rabbi Shimon Ben Yohai. He stood and prayed for them, and they were remembered [they had children]. To teach you that just as God helps sterile women, so too do the righteous help sterile women. Indeed, all the more so, if a flesh and blood said to his fellow flesh and blood, "There is no object in the world which is better for me than you," were saved, Israel who are waiting for the God's salvation every day, and say, "There is no object in the world which is better for me than you," how much more so! That is, We will rejoice and be happy with you. Pesikta de-Rav Kahana 22 Indeed, all the more so, if flesh and blood is able to rejoice and bring joy to everybody, when God will come to bring joy to Jerusalem, how much more so. And Israel who for so many ages have been looking forward to deliverance by God, how much more so! Hence, Rejoicing in the Lord I give joy [Isaiah 61:10]. 33</page><page sequence="12">Arnon Atzmon Appendix 2 - The sources in the original Hebrew ww wm ,33 3m xrip'OD 2 x rm crwn w n'p D,l?nn] is nn»»ai nV&gt;M rrms nm at ,[4 x ©"n1^] in nnarcn nVui x"7 .maw1? no3 psnr ux vxi ins -T'x ...
