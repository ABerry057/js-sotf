Jerusalem: Zalman Shazar Center for Jewish History, 1995. 523 pp. (Hebrew) This excellent and learned book makes an important contribution to the ongoing debate over the origins of modem historical thinking among the Jews, as well as the far broader-and more contentious-argument about the very essence of the historian's craft, the contested claims of the possibility of an objective, "scientific" study of the past. Shmuel Feiner, a Jerusalem-trained</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 143 historian teaching at Bar-Ilan University, provides us with the first detailed analysis of the use and abuse of history in the Haskalah, demonstrating once again that there is still much to be mined in these much-studied texts. It is Feiner's great merit that he is able to take a fresh and lively look at materials previously studied for their ideological and cultural content or literary style, dissecting their often disjointed and even parenthetical comments on and about history, and reassembling them into a coherent and compelling narrative about the ways in which Jews since the Enlightenment have thought or, more properly, written about their past. Feiner is very open about the revisionist goals of this book, hoping to cor- rect at least three conceptions he considers widespread in the literature: first, that the maskilim, as typical members of the anti-historicist Enlightenment, were artificially cut off from the Jewish past; second, that modem Jewish historical thinking began with the Wissenschaft des Judentums movement and the rise of professional students of Jewish history; and third, that modem Jewish historicism was thus first and primarily a creation of German Jewry, and came only late to East European Jewry in the generation of Simon Dubnow and other Russian or Polish practitioners ofjiidische Wissenschaft. To rebut these claims, Feiner takes the reader through a rigorous tour of both the major and the minor figures of the Haskalah, West and East, from Moses Mendelssohn to Peretz Smolenskin, with a seminal stop in Galicia. He dismisses the oft-cited claim that Mendelssohn was not interested in history, revealing the scores of historical citations and insights in his works and those of his disciples. In so doing, Feiner reveals himself to be extremely well read in recent American and, to some extent, European scholarly literature on the historicism of the European Enlightenment, ably applying the insights of this scholarship to the case of the Jewish Enlightenment. On this basis he provides a thorough chronicle of the largely didactic and utilitarian conceptions of history articulated or assumed by the maskilim, as he moves from Berlin to Galicia to Russia in heavily documented and extraordinarily dense chapters. At times some readers may wish for a more selective screening of dramatis personae, as one minor maskil follows another in relentless succession. But Feiner generally does not lose his way in these sometimes rather prosaic thickets. By the time the reader arrives at the last chapter, on the collapse of Haskalah historiography in the 1860s and 1870s, the point has been made well and repeatedly that there was, indeed, such a phenomenon: an indigenous historical scholarship born in Berlin in the late eighteenth century, reaching its ultimate fruition in Galicia and the Pale of Settlement in the nineteenth</page><page sequence="3">144 BOOK REVIEWS century, bequeathing to its successors a keen interest in the Jewish past, some familiarity with non-Jewish history, a relentless and mostly optimistic conviction of the benign anomalousness of the modem era and the idea of universal progress, and an overriding sense of the centrality of understanding the Jewish past in order more fruitfully to create the Jewish future. Although he is very careful to keep within the temporal parameters of his subject, one senses that Feiner would like to push his argument a bit further, in two complex but intersecting directions. First, he tentatively engages the sharp disagreement between YosefYerushalmi and Reuven Bonfil on the nature of the break between premodem and modem conceptions of the Jewish past, presenting Haskalah historiography as clearly at odds with traditional conceptions of Jewish history, but not yet imbued with the positivism and objectivism of Wissenschaft des Judentums and its Rankean claims. Unfortunately, Feiner is a bit too quick to stress the traditionalism and transcendentalism of premodern Jewish historical writing, thus eliding the difficult question, for example, of Ibn Verga's naturalism and starkly nonsupematuralist explication of human and even Jewish history. On a related front, it is difficult to read Feiner's excellent analysis of Smolenskin's rejection of Graetz without thinking of Scholem's "Hirhurim al hokhmat yisrael." As Feiner reminds us, Smolenskin believed that only when a nationalist Jewish historiography arose, written in Hebrew, would the assumptions and verities of the Wissenschaft scholars be examined and redressed, with the creation of Jewish historical scholarship at once less "neutral" and less apologetic. Here we are drawn back to Feiner's first, most analytic chapter, where one wishes he would have taken more into account the sine qua non of the Rankean dispensation, the belief in the possibility of a truly "wissenschaftlich" study of the past, i.e., the attempt to apply the scientific method to human history, including that of the Jews. Clearly, the first corollary of this conviction is the notion that the historian, like the chemist, may brook no restraints in either the materials subjected to analysis or the conclusions reached through the use of an (ostensibly) neutral methodology. This belief lay behind the rejection of Wissenschaft by traditionalist Jews who intuited the heretical potential of such a stance, and by nationalist historians who rejected pretensions of dispassion that could easily contradict basic nationalist claims. (What if there had indeed been no Exodus from Egypt or no conquest of the Land?) It is only one of the ironies of our current cultural moment that the rejection of such claims to objectivity is shared by the cultural Left and the nationalist/religious Right. Which brings us back to the Haskalah and its view of Jewish history. Feiner</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 145 has performed a crucial service in retrieving, documenting, and explicating the reams of historical claims and commentary produced by maskilim from eighteenth-century Berlin to nineteenth-century Berdichev. His first revisionist thrust is thus intact: no one can any longer claim that the maskilim ignored or were uninterested in history, or that they accepted the traditional notion of a divinely ordained Leidensgeschichte. But intense interest in and knowledge of the past is not synonymous with historicism in its modem professional, "scientific" sense; neither Voltaire nor Mendelssohn was a critical historian, not to speak of their lesser successors among the East European maskilim. And Smolenskin was quite simply wrong in his evaluation of Graetz. Not, of course, that Graetz or any of the other Wissenschaft scholars truly practiced neutral or objective history-writing; they merely believed that such a goal was desirable, and perhaps even obtainable. As one of the diminishing number of their remaining acolytes, I would welcome Shmuel Feiner to this beleaguered club on the basis of this wonderfully erudite book, at once impassioned and dispassionate.
