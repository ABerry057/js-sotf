Chico, Calif.: Scholars Press, 1984. xv, 217 pp. This study gathers the scattered and sometimes skimpy evidence for the outlook and practices of diaspora Judaism, analyzes them in terms of the shamanistic model of religion, and contrasts diaspora with rabbinic Judaism. According to Lightstone, the deuteronomic and levitical model of religion, which was continued by mishnaic Judaism, was Temple and land centered, structured by a system of purity and community boundaries, and dependent on the identity and purity of the people and land for survival. Diaspora Jews could not create a closed, concentric social and religious system based on the sacred place, Jerusalem, because they had to interact constantly with Gentiles. Rather than draw impermeable boundaries around their community, diaspora Jews depended on a variety of places, things, and functionaries to mediate the sacred for their community in its non-Jewish social world. Holy men, the tombs of dead ancestors, commu- nity prayer at propitious moments, the sanctity of the Torah scrolls, and other rites, such as fasting, circumcision, and dietary laws, all combined to link heaven and earth as well as the community and the world. This flexible pattern of practice and thought explains how diaspora Judaism could accommodate Christians and other members of the empire who came to the synagogue and sought out Jewish holy men for healing. Chrysostom's</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 255 sermons against the Jews show that Christians were going to the synagogue (without becoming circumcised Jews) as late as the fourth century. Neither Jews nor Christians yet saw their communities as totally distinct, and Light- stone's theoretical model for diaspora Judaism helps explain this important and surprising phenomenon. In addition, Jews borrowed from the world around them, as witnessed by the veneration of the tombs of the dead in Syria (a phenomenon so startling as to be branded as "foreign to Judaism" by Bickerman). Diaspora Jews were also interested in exorcism, since the demonic spirits could not be controlled by the ordered sacred space and ritual of the Temple and Israel. Lightstone has succeeded in proving that diaspora Judaism in the first four centuries, before the ascendancy of talmudic Judaism, lived an interpretation and pattern of Judaism different from the later and more familiar rabbinic model. His study is fertile because he has explicitly used sociological and religious theory to make sense of the scattered evidence remaining to us. He is properly cautious in many of his interpretations because our evidence is uncertain or slight, but his thesis that the larger social world, the symbolic world of the community, and the religious prac- tices of Jews fit in some coherent fashion is convincingly made.
