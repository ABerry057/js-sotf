Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2000. x, 242 pp. Demographic studies and their findings have dominated research in to the American Jewish community since the first National Jewish Population Survey (NJPS) of 1970. When it comes to Jewish identity, both national and community- based demographic studies have been criticized for providing only superficial por- traits of the character of American Jewish institutional life and being even less revelatory of the inner life of American Jews. Yet, few fiscal resources and little public notice have been given to those who sought to describe American Jews and their Judaism in depth through the use of qualitative research methods. It took Steven M. Cohen and Arnold M. Eisen, professors of sociology and religion re- spectively to risk the development of a theory of Jewish identity for more than 50 percent of America's adult Jewish population based on 45 in-depth interviews and two focus groups. To be sure, the authors, both highly respected and prolific schol- ars, set their findings against a backdrop provided by surveys mailed back by 1005 Jews. Nevertheless, it is the insights derived from the three hour interviews that 365</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews are critical to the analysis. Paralleling the work of students of American Protes- tantism such as Robert Bellah, Wade Clark Roof, and Robert Wuthnow, Cohen and Eisen seek to decipher the inner workings of the life journeys of moderately affil- iated Jews. Anthropologists and ethnographers have written case studies of synagogues, havurot and Talmud study circles, but this volume chronicles a pioneering attempt to delineate the "Jew in the street." Moderately affiliated Jews were defined as the more than 50 percent who belong to a Jewish institution but are not as involved, learned or pious as the most highly engaged 20-25 percent of American Jews. The authors write that "Our aim was to get to know the average members of Reform and Conservative congregations, Hadassah chapters and the like" (p. 5). The tar- get generation was married Jews between the ages of 35 and 50. In their own words, "the single most important finding of our study is decidedly double-edged .... The 'first language' that our subjects speak is by and large one of profound indi- vidualism. Their language is universalist, liberal and personalist. Community- though a buzzword in our interviews, a felt need, even a real hunger for some-is a 'second language,' subordinate to the first. Our subjects, like Americans more generally today, do not speak it as often or as well." Cohen and Eisen buttress these findings in chapters on the sovereign self (an explanation of the individualist imperative); the family (the most important source of Jewish identity for interviewees); and ritual (the most significant way in which they express their Jewish commitments). Although three-quarters of the Jews who participated in the national survey agreed that "I have the right to reject those Jew- ish observances that I don't find meaningful," some Sabbath and festival obser- vance is prevalent. They then describe the retreat of public Judaism, contending that three pillars of mid- to late-twentieth-century Judaism have eroded. These in- clude interest in or knowledge of the organized community; particular rather than universal lessons gleaned from the Holocaust; and connections to Israel. The au- thors see the decline in passion for Israel as one of several factors underlying a re- lated decline in Jewish organizational life (p. 189). In contrast to the demonstrated erosion of public Judaism, the authors learned that for the Jews studied, God and the synagogue are central attachments though, somewhat ironically, the authors note that they are usually not connected to each other. Attachment to synagogues is real and persistent but based on what might be seen as a Kaplanian or Durkheimian view-the communal, social, and study functions of synagogue life are paramount. Although the interviewees over- welmingly believe in God, this belief is linked to a non-institutionalized pursuit of spirituality rather than to formal prayer or synagogue life. Periodically, the authors return to the "unprecedented exercise of autonomy among the current generation of Jews" (p. 75). Thus they note that "moderately af- filiated Jews choose what to observe and what not to observe; they also decide, and take it for granted that they have the right to decide, with no one able to tell them any decision is wrong, when to observe, how to observe, and how much to observe .... Our subjects are clear..,. authority rests with each individual or fam- ily" (p. 91, italics in original). More than 83 percent of the participants in the mail survey agreed that "it bothers me when people try to tell me that there's a right way 366</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews to be Jewish." Moderately affiliated Jews are open to increased performance of rit- uals but they invent new and diverse meanings for them. The authors express doubts about the possibility of lasting or transmittable commitments based on such subjective reasons for observance attenuated from a sense of being commanded. Along with a high level of subjectivity, Cohen and Eisen describe a Jewish identity which is so fluid that it is more about "search, exploration, growth, and change" (p. 119) than it is about commitment to any particular belief or practice. There is a sense of tribal connection which runs very deep for many interviewees, a connection which leads them to prefer friendships and marriage with other Jews. Nevertheless, "more Jews today than previously count non-Jews among their friends, and more count non-Jews among their closest friends" (p. 124). There is a withering opposition to intermarriage with just 60 percent agreeing with the statement that "Jews should marry Jews" (p. 132). And, in the event that their chil- dren were to marry non-Jews, almost all said that they would be warm and wel- coming. It is impossible in a brief review to capture the complex analysis of Ameri- can Jewish identity so richly delineated in The Jew Within. It is a book which should be read carefully by American Jewish leaders, in the community, the academy, and the synagogue. It should also be utilized as a required or recommended text in uni- versity and adult learning courses on American Judaism on the cusp of the twenty- first century.
