Yohai and the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael by W. David Nelson Throughout the past two centuries, the corpus of rabbinic writings, called ei- ther tannaitic midrashim or halakhic midrashim, has served as a pivotal founda- tion upon which scholars have based their historical reconstructions of the devel- opment of rabbinic Judaism. The reasons for this dependence are manifold. Predated in redaction by only the Mishnah, these documents contain a wealth of traditions attributed to the founders of rabbinic Judaism who flourished during its nascency. Moreover, these texts differ significantly in rhetorical style, logic, scope, and concern not only from those rabbinic documents which precede them (Mish- nah), follow them (Palestinian/Babylonian Talmuds and amoraic midrashim), or are, perhaps, contemporaneous with them (Tosefta),' but also among themselves as a corpus of writings. Finally, these documents are the earliest collections of rab- binic biblical exegesis ("Midrash") and, were it not for a small number of exam- ples of exegesis preserved in the Mishnah and Tosefta, they would also represent the earliest examples of rabbinic biblical interpretation known today. For reasons 1. Over the past two decades, both the chronological and literary relationship of the Tosefta to the Mishnah have attracted significant, new scholarly interest, resulting in virtually every conceivable hypothesis of relationship.

A review of scholarship on the tannaitic midrashim from the nineteenth cen- tury to the present reveals, however, that a common pattern of assumptions about the nature of the textual evidence has, to various degrees, fueled and guided these efforts. Beginning with the initial "modern" inquiries into the corpus by Wis- senschaft scholars such as Meir Friedmann (1831-1908), Israel Levy (1841- 1917), and David Zvi Hoffmann (1843-1921), and including the efforts in the mid-twentieth century of scholars such as Chanoch Albeck (1890-1972), Jacob Nahum Epstein (1878-1952), and Ezra Zion Melamed (1903 -94), and culminat- ing in the present with the immensely influential and voluminous output of Jacob Neusner, we can perceive a chain of scholarship on the tannaitic midrashic corpus that has been influenced strongly, and often primarily, by "documentary," "com- positional," and "canonical" considerations. That is, from the nineteenth century to the present, scholars have regarded, examined, and evaluated the individual tex- tual components of the tannaitic midrashic corpus as carefully authored composi- tions, replete with authorial intention and crafted so as to express meanings and convey messages that transcend those of the texts' individual traditions. In the interest of brevity, I will illustrate this point with reference to two of the above- mentioned scholars. On one end of the historical spectrum is David Hoffmann, who argued that the parallel textual components of the tannaitic midrashic corpus were rightfully divided into two groups: one that stemmed from the tannaitic "School of Rabbi Ishmael b. Elisha," and one that stemmed from the contemporaneous "School of Rabbi Akiba."2 Hoffmann based this conceptualization on a number of criteria, in- cluding patterned appearances of named sages, usage of technical terminology, and employment of hermeneutical techniques.3 However, at the core of Hoff- mann's schematization was a distinction he believed existed between the exegeti- cal preferences of Ishmael and Akiba: Ishmael, along with his disciples, under- stood the Torah to speak in plain human language, and therefore preferred to employ "straightforward" exegetical techniques to draw meaning from the bibli- cal text. Akiba and his students, however, believed that the Torah communicated in a divine, transrational language. As a result, they favored drastic, "complex" ex- egetical techniques.4 Having perceived this distinction in the exegetical prefer- 2. See D.Z. Hoffmann, Zur Einleitung in die halachischen Midraschim (Berlin: M. Driesner, 1886-87), particularly 1-20; Mechilta de-Rabbi Simon b.

Itzkowski, 1908/9), Introduction. 3. See D.Z. Hoffmann, Zur Einleitung in die halachischen Midraschim, 5-12. 4. Knowledge of the purported exegetical preferences of Ishmael and Akiba is commonplace among scholars of Rabbinic Judaism today; thus, I have refrained from adducing specific examples. There certainly is no dearth of scholarship on this subject, and should the reader desire this informa- tion, s/he should turn first to Hoffmann, Zur Einleitung in die halachischen Midraschim, 5-12. There- after, I would recommend: J.N. Epstein, Mevo'ot lesifrut hatan'im (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1957), 521-35; E.Z. Melamed, Pirkei mavo'lesifrut hatalmud (Jerusalem: Galor, 1973), 170-80; and, Ency- clopedia Judaica, (New York: Macmillan, 1972) s.v. "Hermeneutics," by M.D. Herr, 8:366-72. 2</page><page sequence="3">Oral Orthography ences of Ishmael and Akiba, Hoffmann then extended this distinction to the entire corpus of the tannaitic midrashim, arguing that the differences in these sages' in- terpretive techniques eventually led each of them to produce their own "set" of midrashim. Thus, for Hoffmann, the tannaitic midrashim were much more than random agglomerations of tannaitic interpretation organized according to the sequence of the biblical text. Rather, in his opinion, each text was composed with intention, au- thored as they were by the schools of either Ishmael or Akiba. In authoring their respective texts, these two programmatically selected from the vast wealth of midrashic traditions they had at their disposal. Each text of the corpus was gov- erned by a coherence that served to bind together its constituent and individually disparate interpretive elements-an agenda that reflected the thoughts, concerns, and beliefs of each text's authors. Moreover, Hoffmann operated under the assumption that the individual texts of the tannaitic corpus as they existed in his day (i.e., as reconstructed from vari- ous manuscript traditions or according to various printed editions) were accurate and reliable representations of the very same texts that circulated within tannaitic and amoraic rabbinic circles. Hoffmann's emphasis on the historical reconstruc- tion of the "two schools" of tannaitic teaching demanded this understanding of the literary evidence available to him. It was not sufficient for Hoffmann to assume only that the individual traditions comprising these texts were representative of traditions that actually flourished and circulated among the earliest rabbis; rather, he had to assume as well that these traditions were attributed, gathered, organized, placed, juxtaposed, and arranged in the same manner as they came to exist in the editions of the texts with which he worked. It was this assumption that allowed him to perceive the variety of distinctions that he claimed delimited the various texts into the purported "sets" that stemmed from the purported "schools" (e.g., exegetical affinities, preponderance of certain named sages, differences in ha- lakhic pronouncements). Without this assumption, therefore, it would have been impossible for him to advance the argument of intentioned authorship mentioned above. In constructing his paradigm, Hoffmann also presupposed a chronologi- cally linear production of the texts of the tannaitic midrashic corpus. Namely, for each text of the corpus there was a temporally precise and determined "begin- In spite of its widespread scholarly acceptance, the notion that Ishmael and Akiba (or their re- spective schools) actually disagreed over accepted exegetical norms and techniques has been revealed to be entirely unproven and erroneous. In particular, see the excellent refutation in Jay Harris, How Do We Know This? Midrash and the Fragmentation of Modern Judaism (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1995), 25-72. Nonetheless, scholarly interest in the hermeneutical distinctions between the purportedly "Ishmaelean" and "Akiban" corpora of the halakhic midrashim remains strong, as high- lighted by the recent effort by Azzan Yadin, Scripture as Logos: Rabbi Ishmael and the Origins of Midrash (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004), which focuses on distinctions in legal hermeneutical approaches between the Mekhilta ofRabbi Ishmael and Sifre Numbers. Although he ac- knowledges the infeasibility of ascribing certain texts or heremeneutical techniques to specific tan- naitic individuals, Yadin finds useful and worthy of investigation the patterned hermeneutical prefer- ences that, in his opinion, each corpus displays. 3</page><page sequence="4">W David Nelson ning"-a moment of absolute origin when the pristine "original" version (Urtext) of each text came into existence. Thereafter, the "original" versions were trans- mitted and recopied over time by scribe after scribe, each of whom potentially "sul- lied" the Urtext a bit by means of either creative/intentional or accidental addition, deletion, or manipulation of its parts. This linear understanding of the corpus' cre- ation and transmission was crucial for Hoffmann, because it provided him with a much needed explanation for the significantly large number of instances when el- ements of the various texts did not conform to his schematic generalizations. It was assumptions such as these about the nature of rabbinic textuality and textual authorship that allowed Hoffmann to advance his arguments. By conceiv- ing of the tannaitic midrashim as intentional compositions, the products of autho- rial agendas, and subjected to a relatively reliable and static scribal transmission (minor "errors" notwithstanding), Hoffmann could then advance the proposition that these texts stood either in opposition to or in agreement with each other. Fi- nally, this conceptualization of the textual evidence facilitated the historical thrust of Hoffmann's explanatory scheme, enabling him to argue that from this corpus one could reasonably reconstruct the internal development and intellectual con- cerns of the nascent rabbinic movement that produced the traditions contained within the texts. At the other end of the scholarly historical spectrum is Jacob Neusner, who produced an impressive body of scholarship on the tannaitic midrashic corpus from 1985-90 as a subset of his broad and incorporative research agenda.5 Neusner's approach to the tannaitic midrashic corpus is best described as "docu- mentary" or "canonical-historical." In his view, each text of the corpus is a discrete and independent document, produced by anonymous redactors or "framers" through their purposeful and programmatic selection and reshaping of tradition. Far from being random agglomerations of tannaitic midrashic tradition, in Neusner's opinion, each text (i.e., "document" or "book") was the product of an authorship determined to express certain points and convictions by adhering to a pre-determined compositional "plan and program."6 That is, as each document was produced, the authors of that document allowed their selection and shaping of ma- 5.

Given, however, the fact that rabbinic texts not only lack specific, reliable authorship, but also fail to express their plans and programs in an overt manner, Neusner devises an alternative analytical mechanism for discerning each document's generative concerns and principles. Rather than re- lying upon blatant attestation, Neusner turns, instead, to the texts' "taxic indica- tors"-that is, to the literary traits (rhetoric, logic, and topic) of each text. It is Neusner's conviction that by identifying and analyzing in minute detail each text's recurrent modes of expression (rhetoric), propositional or syllogistic principles (logic), and thematic concerns (topic), the ultimate interests and con- victions of each text's authorship become apparent. Stated differently, the final redactors of each text articulated their plan and program in the way they worded their exegesis, the way they formulated their thought patterns, and the issues they chose to address. Neusner's theoretical approach to the tannaitic midrashic corpus is revolu- tionary in a number of respects. He refuses to acknowledge both the veracity of the putative exegetical differences between the schools of Ishmael and Akiba, and the notion that such a distinction can be used to explain the patterned differences among the tannaitic midrashim. In fact, Neusner's approach to the corpus is dis- tinct from those of his predecessors in that it does not presuppose to any degree a corpus divided into two groups. Rather, in his opinion each text is to be viewed as an entity in and of itself, and the attempt to pigeonhole the texts into a precon- ceived theoretical framework of divided authorship ascribes an order to the corpus that Neusner believes cannot be substantiated. Nonetheless, in developing his unique methodological approach to the tan- naitic midrashim, Neusner clearly relies to a great (if not greater) degree on the same presuppositions about rabbinic textuality taken for granted by Hoffmann at the turn of the century. For example, he presumes that the tannaitic midrashim were composed with authorial intention. Far from viewing them as random agglomera- tions of tannaitic traditions organized around the flow of the biblical text, Neusner clearly believes that each text was crafted with care; that each was the result of a programmatic and ideological selection and reshaping of inherited tradition. Whereas Hoffmann based this assumption upon patterned occurrences in the texts of named sages and methods of exegesis, Neusner perceives authorship from pat- terned occurrences of rhetorical, logical, and thematic tropes. 7.

See Neusner, Judaism and Scripture: The Evidence of Leviticus Rabbah (Chicago and Lon- don: University of Chicago Press, 1986), 98. 5</page><page sequence="6">W David Nelson Neusner also assumes that the reconstructed critical versions of the tannaitic midrashim represent with a high degree of accuracy versions of these texts that cir- culated in the late tannaitic and early amoraic period. Neusner's reconstruction of the ideological and theological developments within early rabbinism requires this presumption; it is not sufficient for him to assume merely that the individual tra- ditions contained within these texts are accurate reflections of traditions with tan- naitic provenance. Rather, Neusner advances global arguments based upon his global documentary analyses and comparisons of the tannaitic midrashim. Thus, he bases his conclusions upon the evidence he adduces from the entirety of the texts-the sum of the parts of the individual units of tradition. As such, he pre- sumes that the versions of these texts available today reflect with precision the same texts that circulated in early rabbinic circles. Or, to borrow Neusner's metaphor, the books of the tannaitic midrashim on the modern historian's book- shelf are simply reprintings of those on the bookshelves of the early rabbis. Finally, Neusner's work on the tannaitic midrashim (as well as on the entire corpus of classical rabbinic literature) is founded upon a chirographic and literary conceptualization of early rabbinic pedagogy. Within his methodological world, the rabbis are viewed primarily as readers and writers, and are entirely disassoci- ated from the dialogical, developmental, and socially interactive process of talmud torah. Moreover, Neusner's understanding of the textual evidence is informed pri- marily by modern textual sensibilities. The rabbis produced and transmitted to sub- sequent generations their authoritative books, within which they carefully stressed their particular beliefs and authorial agendas. Upon completion, these books were added to the rabbinic canon. It follows that it was the rabbis' intention that these books be read as we read books today, in their entirety from beginning to end. Oth- erwise, the message of each document, discernable only when one takes into ac- count the entirety of the work, would elude its subsequent audience. Thus, the theoretical frameworks devised by both Hoffmann and Neusner for the tannaitic midrashic corpus were based primarily upon documentary and com- positional presumptions about the nature of the textual evidence and early rabbinic textuality. Moreover, as stated earlier, these scholars are located on opposite ends of the historical spectrum of scholarship on the tannaitic midrashim. Indeed, throughout the twentieth century, preeminent scholars such as Chanoch Albeck,9 Jacob Nahum Epstein,' and Ezra Melamed"I attempted to devise their own sys- tematic frameworks within which to situate and understand the individual textual components of the tannaitic midrashic corpus, and in doing so, maintained, fos- tered, and built upon similar compositional conceptualizations of the individual 9.

As with Hoffmann and Neusner, these efforts have general- ized and championed the overall, chirographic characteristics of these texts, to the virtual neglect of any substantial consideration of how these texts either alterna- tively or concurrently might reflect, exemplify, or preserve aspects of the dy- namic, fluid oral-performative social climate of early Rabbinic pedagogical in- struction, within which these texts and their constituent traditions played a fundamental role. Recent scholarship on rabbinic literature, however, has attempted to ap- proach this literature anew by examining the function and role of both the written and spoken word in early rabbinic society. Strongly influenced by nearly a centu- ry of interdisciplinary scholarship on the influence exerted by speech and writing on the transmission of cultural tradition,12 "Orality" studies in rabbinic literature consider the influence exerted by written, oral, and aural facets of rabbinic peda- gogy on the creation, transmission, and preservation of early rabbinic tradition. These orality-informed approaches to rabbinic literature have begun to examine the frozen, chirographic textual evidence of rabbinic documents in a new light.13 Instead of appealing to rabbinic textual compilations as "authored" documents, or as pristine, verbatim transcriptions of an ancient, anteriorly developed and verbal- 12. Interdisciplinary scholarship in the theoretical study of orality and literacy has a long and rich history. Its roots are in the research conducted by Milman Parry among Serbo-Croatian folktale performers, in order to shed light on stylistic peculiarities in the Homeric epics. His research was un- finished at the time of his death, and was subsequently completed and published by his student, A.B. Lord in The Singer of Tales (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1960). Important recent theoretical models include W.J. Ong, Orality and Literacy (London and New York: Routledge, 1982), and E Biiuml, "Medieval Texts and the Two Theories of Oral-Formulaic Com- position: A Proposal for a Third Theory," New Literary History 16 (1984-85): 31-49, and R.

Calinescu, "Orality in Literacy: Some Historical Paradoxes of Reading," Yale Journal of Crit- icism 6 (1993): 175-90. For an excellent discussion of the history of theoretical scholarship on orali- ty and literacy see J.M. Foley, The Theory of Oral Composition: History and Methodology (Bloom- ington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1988). Applications of theoretical models of orality and literacy to specific cultural examples abound. An excellent application across a broad spectrum of cultures is J. Goody, The Interface Between the Written and the Oral (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987), and B. Stolz and R. Shannon, eds., Oral Literature and the Formula (Ann Arbor: Center for the Coordination of Ancient and Mod- ern Studies, 1976). For applications in the field of Classics, see R. Thomas, Literacy and Orality in An- cient Greece (Cambridge: Cambridge University, 1992), and K. Robb, Literacy and Paideia in Ancient Greece (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1994).

Stock, The Implications of Literacy: Written Language and Models of Interpretation in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries (Princeton: Princeton University, 1983), and M. Carruthers, The Book ofMemory: A Study ofMemory in Medieval Culture (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990). 13. Although flawed in many respects, the work of B. Gerhardsson, Memory and Manuscript: Oral Tradition and Written Transmission in Rabbinic Judaism and Early Christianity, trans. E.J. Sharpe (Lund: Gleerup and Copenhagen: Munksgaard, 1961) is commonly regarded as one of the earliest ap- plications of orality theory to rabbinic literature. Scholars of rabbinic literature are now realizing the potential offered by Orality studies for in- sight into early rabbinic pedagogy and creation/transmission of tradition. To date, the most program- matic, sophisticated, and developed program of research is the work of Martin Jaffee.

Pro- duced by an increasingly widening variety of scholars, and somewhat disparate in nature, all of these latest scholarly efforts are alike in once crucial respect-namely, they are all founded on the conviction that, by preserving for posterity a momen- tary glimpse into the ever-changing, fluid, and dynamic world of rabbinic tradi- tional instruction, the texts have preserved, additionally, characteristic remnants- internal evidence-of the very social climate from which this literature emerged and within which it played such a crucial role.

Yohai and the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael-in order to reex- amine and reevaluate the relationship between these two texts in the light of these contemporary scholarly insights.14 My intention is to develop further the small, but growing, body of Orality-informed theory on early rabbinic textuality. In do- ing so, I hope to begin to refocus the methodological lens through which scholars view not only these texts, but also the entirety of the tannaitic midrashic corpus. Instead of appealing to these texts for particularities about historical and/or ideo- logical developments with the nascent rabbinic movement, or as consciously and programmatically authored "books," I hope to show that it is more valuable and ju- dicious to utilize these parallel sources to investigate the particularities of rabbinic talmud torah and the cultural process that was the transmission of Oral Torah.

Yohai and the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael to a single verse of Scripture-Exodus 12:1: "The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying." Contextually speaking, this verse marks the beginning of a number of di- vine commands, of both immediate and eternal concern, to Moses and Aaron, and thus indirectly to the entire congregation of Israel. Of immediate concern are the instructions that follow, directing the Israelites in their preparation for the tenth, and final, plague brought by God upon the Egyptians. The Israelites are commanded to set aside a perfect lamb on the tenth day of the month (Nisan), either one to a fam- ily or one shared among many households, and to guard it closely until twilight of the fourteenth. At that time, they are to slaughter their lambs, and place some of the blood on their individual doorposts and lintels, thus demarcating their households and identifying them to God, who that night will pass over them while slaying each Egyptian firstborn. The Israelites are also commanded to roast the sacrificial lamb that very night, eat it with bitter herbs and unleavened bread, and burn any that re- mains until dawn. In such fashion, God declares to Moses and Aaron, will the Is- raelites receive their long-awaited rescue from bondage. Of eternal concern are the commands that follow concerning the ritual ob- servance of this occasion throughout subsequent generations. For in addition to the particularities ofthe moment, God instructs the Israelites to repeat this sacrifice at the same moment on an annual basis as a commemoration of their exodus from Egypt. For seven days they are to refrain from their daily labor, eat unleavened bread, and rid themselves of, and abstain from eating, that which is leavened. However, we shall soon see that both of our texts, in typical midrashic fash- ion, atomize the biblical text, re-reading our verse in a manner thoroughly devoid of attention to its larger context. In fact, in their exegetical treatment of Exodus 12:1, both texts are fixated entirely on the specific words of the verse-"spoke," "Moses and Aaron," and "in the Land of Egypt"-and as such, devote their entire interpretive attention to these clauses, regardless of the biblical narrative that fol- lows. We begin with the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai.'15 15. All translations of midrashic texts are my own; however, when translating the excerpts from the Mekhilta ofRabbi Ishmael I freely consulted the fine translation of J. Lauterbach, Mekilta de-Rab- bi Ishmael (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1933).

YOHAI [Al] "The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt" (Exodus 12:1): This teaches that before the Land of Israel was consecrated [as the exclusive location for divine speech] all lands were suitable for di- vine speech. But once the Land of Israel was so consecrated, there was no divine speech with the prophets anywhere [outside of the Land of Is- rael], except next to water.'6 [A2] As it teaches in Scripture, "The word of the Lord came to the priest Ezekiel son of Buzi, by the Chebar Canal in the Land of the Chaldeans" (Ezekiel 1:3). And it teaches further in Scripture, "And I was by the Ulai river" (Daniel 8:2). And it teaches further in Scripture, "when I was on the bank of the great river, the Tigris" (Daniel 10:4). [A3] And likewise with Jonah, [God] only spoke with him next to water. [A4] R. Judah says, "Even at first [God] only spoke with the prophets next to water. 17 [A5] As it says in Scripture, "The word of the Lord came ["inn ,rn1"] (to the priest Ezekiel son of Buzi)" (Ezekiel 1:3).18 [A6] R. Nehemiah says, "[Rather, it is the case that] even at first [God] spoke with the prophets anywhere. What [therefore] does the verse 'The word of the Lord came to Ezekiel' teach? This teaches that the Holy Spirit was not frequently upon him." [Bl] "(The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron) in the Land of Egypt" (Exodus 12:1): One might think [that God spoke] within the [boundaries of] the city. Scripture states [however], "in the Land (of Egypt)." [God] did not speak with him [even within] a field [within the city.'9 Rather,] He spoke with him outside of the city. [B2] And so did Moses say to Pharaoh, "As I go out of the city (I shall spread out my hands to the Lord)" (Exodus 9:29).

That is, it was the case even before the consecration of the Land of Israel that God only spoke outside the Land of Israel next to places of water. 18. The scriptural employment of the seemingly doubled infinitive absolute is understood to in- dicate a twofold nature of the divine speech, i.e., the divine speech that occurred before the consecra- tion of the Land of Israel was like the speech that Ezekiel received after the consecration, in that it was received next to water. 19. Note M. Arakhin 9:5: "Whatever is within the city wall is considered 'a dwelling house in a walled city' (ref. Lev. 25:29) except for the fields. R. Meir says, 'Even fields.'" 10</page><page sequence="11">Oral Orthography indicated in Exodus 9:29], which is less significant, [it is the case that Moses] would not pray within the city, then is it not all the more so [the case with regard to] the more significant divine speech? And why would He not speak with him inside the city? Because it was full of idols. [B3] But still I might say, "He spoke with Moses outside of the city, but when Moses spoke [the divine message] to Aaron, he would not speak to him outside the city." Scripture states [however], "The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron in the Land of Egypt" (Exodus 12:1). This equates the divine speech [to] Aaron with the divine speech [to] Moses. Just as Moses' was outside the city, likewise Aaron's was outside the city. [B4] Just as Moses [would relate the divine command to Pharaoh beginning with] "Thus said," likewise Aaron [would begin with] "Thus said," Just as Moses was a judge over Pharaoh, speaking without fear, likewise Aaron was a judge over Pharaoh, speaking without fear. Just as Moses was treasurer for the Red Heifer, the light, the anointing oil and the in- cense of spices,20 likewise was Aaron treasurer for the Red Heifer, the light, the anointing oil and the incense of spices. Scripture states, "The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron" (Exodus 12:1). This equates the great- ness of Aaron with the greatness of Moses. Exodus 12:1 mentions three things: 1) that God spoke; 2) that God's speech was directed to Moses and Aaron; and 3) that God spoke in the Land of Egypt. Our commentary begins by focusing upon two of these three aspects; namely, that there was divine speech, and that it was delivered in Egypt. At [Al], the commentary sets forth its initial premise: although at one point in history God would speak with the prophets anywhere, once the Land of Israel was designated as the prime loca- tion for divine communication (presumably, after the conquest of the Land of Is- rael and its distribution to the various tribes), God would only speak outside the Land of Israel to the prophets beside a natural body of water. In [A4]-[A6], the commentary discusses whether or not the consecration of the Land of Israel served as the historical turning point for divine speech outside of the Land next to a body of water. In [A4] an opinion attributed to R. Judah claims that even before the con- secration of the Land of Israel, God would only speak outside of the Land next to a body of water. As support for his claim, in [A5] Judah states that the "unusual" scriptural employment of the infinitive absolute in Ezekiel 1:3 indicates that the divine communication directed to Ezekiel outside of, and after the consecration of, the Land was identical to the divine communication outside of, and before the consecration of, the Land. In [A6] R. Nehemiah disputes this interpretation of the infinite absolute, allowing its usage to signify only the rarity and wondrous nature of divine speech with Ezekiel. In [B 1 ]-[B4] our text's exegetical attention remains focused on the issue of the location of God's communication to Moses and Aaron. However, the concern now is to determine with precision where this divine communication took place within the boundaries of the Land of Egypt. Because our verse states that God 20. See Leviticus 6:9ff and Numbers 19:1 ff. 11</page><page sequence="12">W David Nelson spoke to Moses and Aaron in the indefinite, broadly worded Land of Egypt, in [B i] our text determines that this means that God only spoke to Moses and Aaron out- side of the city limits. [B2] provides not only the rationale for this claim-that the cities of Egypt were replete with idolatry-but additional support for it as well, in the form of an argument afortiori from the supplication of Moses in Exodus 9:29. The commentary, however, refuses to concede that this point is resolved, proposing in [B3] that, perhaps, only the divine communication between God and Moses took place outside of the city limits, but when Moses relayed God's words to Aaron, he would do so within the city's boundaries. However, by drawing at- tention to the clause "to Moses and Aaron" in our base verse, the text concludes that divine communication to both of these men (be it direct or conveyed) was con- fined to areas outside of the idolatrous city. This conclusion serves as a segue to the topic of [B4], namely, the juxtaposition and comparison of the greatness and honor of Moses and Aaron. Once again, using the base verse as proof, our text con- cludes that there was parity in the stature of both of these leaders. If we take a step back to view this unit from a distance, we see some inter- esting aspects of this commentary. We note, first, that this unit of text has magnif- icently incorporated all three of the generative clauses of our base verse ("The Lord spoke"; "to Moses and Aaron"; "in the Land of Egypt") into a cohesive, themati- cally flowing exposition. That is, by midrashically atomizing the biblical verse, the commentary creates a new reading of the biblical text that integrates all three claus- es of the verse. The atomized clauses of the verse, therefore, speak to each other, and combine to produce an entirely new rendering of the meaning of the biblical text. The one who encounters this midrashic tradition of interpretation on this seemingly benign biblical verse, will, thereafter, always associate this verse with, and understand it through, this series of atomized, midrashic interpretations. The individual clauses of the verse now automatically evoke inextricably associated midrashic "questions" that point to the midrashic "answers" delineated in the text above: "The Lord spoke.. ." evokes "What is the nature and value of divine speech/ prophecy?"; ". .. to Moses and Aaron" evokes "What does this teach about the equality of Moses and Aaron?"; and, ". . . in the Land of Egypt" evokes, "What does this teach about the unique holiness of the Land of Israel?" However, we cannot fail to note the rather odd twist in the commentary found at the beginning of [B3]; specifically, the text there declares quite unexpectedly that, in fact, God did not speak directly to both Moses and Aaron. Rather, accord- ing to our text, God spoke to Moses, who would subsequently convey God's words to Aaron: But still, I might say, "He spoke with Moses outside of the city, but when Moses spoke [the divine message] to Aaron, he would not speak to him out- side the city. Is this a question or an assumption? This notion is entirely undeveloped in our com- mentary prior to this moment; nonetheless, the text states it in almost matter-of- fact fashion. Adding to the peculiarity of this exegetical shift in our commentary is its resolution at the end of [B3]: 12</page><page sequence="13">Oral Orthography This equates the divine speech [to] Aaron with the divine speech [to] Moses. Just as Moses' was outside the city, likewise Aaron's was outside of the city. This resolution, although absolute in its conviction that both Moses and Aaron re- ceived God's words outside of the city, still fails to clarify whether the divine speech was given directly to the two of them, or if, indeed, it was given directly first to Moses, who would then convey it to Aaron outside the city's limits. Thus, as the reader encounters this portion of the commentary s/he is unable to perceive with certainty what its major point is. Is the text assuming all along that Moses re- ceived God's words directly and conveyed them to Aaron? The point of our com- mentary, then, would be to clarify whether or not even this conveyance took place outside the city's boundaries. Or, perhaps our text wishes to question whether or not both Moses and Aaron received the commands directly from God, in which case, the point of our commentary would be to stress that, indeed, this was the case. Both meanings can be supported by the ambiguous wording of the commentary. We shall return to this point later in this paper, in our examination of the parallel text from the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael. Our text continues: [Cl] (The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron in the Land of Egypt,) saying (Exodus 12:1): R. Eliezer says, "How do we know from Scripture that the order [of the transmission] of the divine speech in the wilderness was just like the order [of transmission] of divine speech [as it oc- curred] in the Land of Egypt?

[C3] However, I might retort that when Aaron preceded the [i.e., his] sons [in receiving divine speech] in the wilderness he had been anointed with the anointing oil.

[C6] However, I might retort that the sons preceded the elders in the wilder- ness, when they likewise preceded them in ascending Mount [Sinai].24 Shall [we assume] here that the sons preceded the elders, when they had not [yet] preceded [them] in ascending the mountain? [C7] Scripture states, "and he spoke to his sons" (ref. Leviticus 21:24). This teaches that the sons preceded the elders. [C8] And how do we know from Scripture that the elders preceded Israel? [Perhaps] you don't need [scriptural proof, because it can be deduced by means of] analogy. The word "spoke" is said here, and the word "spoke" is said in the wilderness.

[C9] However, I might retort that when the elders preceded Israel in the wilderness, they likewise were sanctified with the Holy Spirit. Shall [we assume] here that the elders preceded Israel, when they had not [yet] been sanctified with the Holy Spirit? [C10] Scripture states, "And Moses called to all the elders of Israel" (Exodus 12:21). This teaches that the elders preceded Israel. In this section, our commentary is concerned with the sequence in which God's command was transmitted from Moses to the people of Israel at large. This entire unit is attributed to R. Eliezer, whose goal is to prove that the sequence of transmission of God's word in Egypt was the same as the sequence used to trans- mit the various Levitical commands; that is, Moses to Aaron first, then Moses to Aaron's sons, then Moses to the Elders of Israel, and finally Moses to the Israelites at large. At issue here is the meaning of order in Scripture, and implied in our com- mentary, of course, is that the sequential order of Scripture is indicative of se- quential levels of importance and grandeur. This unit is a perfectly balanced series of "appeal to logic versus Scripture" arguments. That is, for each step in the sequence, Eliezer proposes that one could try simply to appeal to logical reasoning to prove the proper order of the sequence: [C 1], [C5], and [C8]. In each instance, the logical argument is presented in the form of a gezerah shavah,25 using the word "spoke" from our base verse: [C2], [C5], and [C8]. In each instance, however, the appeal to logic is shown to be faulty: [C3], [C6], and [C9]. Ultimately, Eliezer argues that, since logic has failed to prove that the sequence in Egypt was identical to the sequence in the wilderness, one must appeal directly to Scripture for proof: [C4], [C7], and [C10]. 24. See Exodus 24:1. 25. An interpretive ploy, which notes that a word or expression is used in two scriptural con- texts.

Our text here appears to be as- suming, as in the section above, that, in fact, it was Moses who received God's words directly, and who thereafter transmitted them to Aaron.26 However, also as in the section above, the commentary has stopped short of stating it directly, and in doing so, appears to assume it as common knowledge, expecting that the read- er also knows this to be the case. Having completed our examination and analysis of the textual portions of the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai that address Exodus 12: 1,27 we direct our attention now to the parallel materials found in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael.28 As in the earlier examination, we shall work our way through the material in a unit- by-unit manner, in order to become intimately acquainted with the materials. This will allow us, in the end, to make some global comparisons and observations. MEKHILTA OF RABBI ISHMAEL [ 1A] "The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron in the Land of Egypt saying" (Ex- odus 12:1): I might understand [from Scripture] that there was divine speech to [both] Moses and Aaron. [However] when it says, "And it hap- pened that in the day the Lord spoke to Moses in the Land of Egypt," (Exodus 6:26) [it proves that] divine speech was [directed] to Moses, but not to Aaron. [IB] If so, why does Scripture state, " .. to Moses and Aaron ... ?" This teaches that just as Moses was worthy of [receiving] divine speech, like- wise was Aaron worthy of [receiving] divine speech. And why wasn't it spoken with him [i.e., Aaron]? Because of Moses' honor. Consequently, Aaron is excluded from all divine speech in the Torah, except for three places, where [an alternative to speaking with Aaron] is impossible. Our commentary begins in [1 A] by questioning whether, in fact, God spoke directly to both Moses and Aaron, as is stated in our base verse. The commentary immediately adduces a prooftext that would seem to indicate the opposite, and, in- deed, our text deduces from it that God chose to communicate only with Moses. Since this is the case, [IB] proceeds to question the purpose of our base verse stat- ing that God spoke "to Moses and Aaron." The conclusion, of course, is that Aaron was every bit as worthy as Moses to receive divine communication; however, in 26. I acknowledge that one could argue here that when the text says "Aaron heard it first," it means that Aaron heard it first from the mouth of God, along with Moses. I feel this not to be the case, however, because the text specifically states here only Aaron, and not Moses, with the implication be- ing that Aaron heard it first from Moses, and repeated it first back to Moses. For additional proof, see B. Eruvin 54b, which discusses the order in which Moses transmitted mishnah. There it states definitively that Moses heard it first from God, and then repeated it to Aaron, who in turn repeated it back to him, and so on to the sons, elders, and common Israelites. 27. I note that I have excluded from consideration here the very brief interpretive comment in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai to the final word of our base verse-"saying." In the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael there is a considerable amount of interpretation to this word, however. 28. Textual excerpts taken from H.S. Horovitz &amp; I.A. Rabin, Mechilta D'Rabbi Ishmael (Jerusalem: Wahrmann Books, 1970). 15</page><page sequence="16">W David Nelson consideration of Moses' honorable standing before God, God chose to communi- cate directly only with him. What we have, therefore, is a tradition claiming that God spoke only to Moses, even in the face of explicit, contradictory scriptural proof. Directing our attention, for the moment, back to our parallel text in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shi- mon b. Yohai, we remember that in two instances-[B3] and [C2]-we noticed that the text, in effect, seemed to take this notion for granted, indirectly claiming it to be the case without explicitly stating so. Clearly, the foundational tradition for this concept is our excerpt above from the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael. Moreover, it is clear that the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai assumes that its audience is fa- miliar with this tradition. All that is lacking is for the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai to have stated it overtly, or to have included the tradition within its own in- terpretive framework. Although we can never state with certainty why or how this tradition came to be excluded, but nonetheless assumed, by the Mekhilta ofRabbi Shimon b. Yohai, we can, at the very least, begin to explore whether explanations retain plausibility when confronted with this scenario. One very common explanation would claim that this "predicament" was simply a by-product of the distinct redactional processes that ultimately led to the production of these two separate, but parallel, texts. Somehow, and for some unknown reason, the "editors" or "authors" who se- lected traditions from the vast array at their disposal and arranged them into "com- positions" made different editorial decisions. In the case of the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael, the decision was made to include the tradition about God speaking di- rectly only to Moses; in the case of the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai, the de- cision was made to exclude it. Such an explanation, however, fails to reconcile how the redactors of the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai, in their purported endeavor to create a coher- ent, thematically-flowing "work," could justify their exclusion of this crucial tra- dition, particularly since they included other traditions that overtly (that is, in their very language) took such knowledge for granted. Or, stated differently, if the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai represents a carefully and programmatically edited document, one possessed of internal coherence and thematic unity that en- ables the reader to move from unit to unit in an informed manner, then the text fell short of its goal in the section we examined above. I do not deny that these texts are the end products of separate redactional processes, or even that they are the culmination of written endeavors. To claim the opposite would be naive and misguided. I deny neither the redactional foundation of our texts nor the chirographic aspects of such redactional processes. However, I doubt that the amoraic authorities responsible for our texts were motivated pri- marily by the desire to arrange traditions in accordance with compositional con- cerns. For if this was the case, they did a rather poor job in this section from the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai! The Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael continues: [2A] Another opinion: "(The Lord spoke) to Moses and Aaron" (Exodus 12:1). Why was [this verse] stated? Because it states, "The Lord said to 16</page><page sequence="17">Oral Orthography Moses, 'See that I have placed you in the role of judge29 to Pharaoh (with your brother Aaron as your prophet)"' (Exodus 7:1). [And] from this [verse] I may only conclude that Moses was a judge30 to Pharaoh. [2B] How does one know from Scripture [that this was also the case with] Aaron? Scripture states, "(The Lord spoke) to Moses and Aaron" (Exo- dus 12:1). [Scripture] equates Aaron to Moses. Just as Moses was a judge to Pharaoh, likewise Aaron was a judge to Pharaoh. Just as Moses would speak his words and was not afraid, likewise would Aaron speak his words and not be afraid. This unit of commentary, presented as an alternative interpretation to the unit above, focuses once again on the clause "to Moses and Aaron" in our base verse. In this instance, our commentary juxtaposes our base verse with Exodus 7:1, where it states that God designated Moses as a judge over Pharaoh. Our commentary ar- gues that this verse might (quite reasonably) lead one to presume that Moses alone was a judge to Pharaoh; thus, our base verse, by stating "to Moses and Aaron" in- structs us that, in fact, Moses and Aaron were equal in this regard, and both served as judges to Pharaoh. In this unit, therefore, the specific wording of the base verse is utilized to stress the ultimate parity between Moses and Aaron, in the face of al- ternative scriptural evidence that could lead one to the opposite conclusion. This is the exact opposite of the section immediately preceding it in the Mekhilta ofRab- bi Ishmael. The preceding unit emphasizes an essential inequality between Aaron and Moses, and considers the specific wording of the base verse to be the source of potential misunderstanding, which requires the rectification of alternative scrip- tural evidence. Of particular interest is the correspondence and relationship of this unit with its parallel in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai, unit [B4]. There are various degrees of similarity displayed between the parallel portions of these two texts. At times, the parallel portions are nearly identical; however, more often than not, the parallel traditions display both significant similarities and differences. Units [2A]- [2B] of the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael and [B4] of the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai are indicative of such imprecise affinity. We note, for example, that our unit in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael is ex- egetically independent from the unit that precedes it, as well as from the unit that follows it. In effect, it stands alone; it is "another opinion." Its parallel in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai, however, is integrated as part of a larger unit, and fulfills a specific, subordinate function therein: to provide illustrations of par- ity and equity in the stature of Moses and Aaron, a theme developed previously in [B3]. Therefore, our parallel in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai fulfills a wholly subsidiary role. 29. The word used here in the biblical text for judge is 'elohim, which also means God. Thus, Exodus 7:1 could be translated either "See that I have placed you in the role of judge to Pharaoh" or "See that I have placed you as a god over Pharaoh." 30. Hebrew: dayan (1'p). 17</page><page sequence="18">W David Nelson Concomitant with the different role each parallel unit fulfills within its larg- er literary structure is the difference in its shape, structure, and substance. In the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael, we notice how the unit, in effect, revolves around the juxtaposition of Exodus 7:1 with Exodus 12:1. In fact, it is Exodus 7:1 that intro- duces the concept of Moses serving as judge to Pharaoh, which, in turn, "sets up" the equation of Moses with Aaron as judge in [2B]. As an independent unit, there- fore, [2A]-[2B] in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael is reliant upon Exodus 7:1 for thematic context and coherence. Finally, we point out that this unit illustrates the equality between Moses and Aaron in only two ways-as judge to, and in freedom of speech before, Pharaoh. The parallel in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai is remarkably differ- ent in these respects. For example, since the notion of equality between Moses and Aaron is introduced in [B3] through the example of divine speech outside of the city, there is no need for our text to introduce Exodus 7:1 into the equation. That is, since this tradition fulfills only a subordinate role in the Mekhilta ofRabbi Shi- mon b. Yohai, and since the text in [B3] has already developed the thematic con- text of equality between Moses and Aaron in an alternative way, the commentary only needs to mention our tradition in [B4] succinctly and referentially. Despite these differences in their structure and substance, our parallels display thematic affinity. Each tradition, be it explicitly developed and spelled out or men- tioned only briefly in passing, stresses the same theme-the equality in the stature of Moses and Aaron as displayed by the fact that they both served as judges to Pharaoh. What we see here, therefore, is the malleability of tradition in the hands of the rabbis, whereby a well-established tradition can be shaped and reshaped, depending on the needs of any particular exegetical moment. In the case of the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael, the context demanded a lengthy, explicit retelling of this tradition. Howev- er, in the case of the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai, the context required only the briefest articulation. The rabbinic reader, upon encountering this tradition in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai, would rely upon his resonant memories of other encounters with this tradition to understand its fuller meaning and basis in Scripture. Our commentary continues: [3A] Another opinion: "(The Lord spoke) to Moses and Aaron" (Exodus 12:1). I might understand [from this verse that] the one who precedes in Scripture actually takes precedence. [However] when it says, "It is the same Aaron and Moses" (Exodus 6:26), this declares that the two of them are equal to each other. [3B] Similarly to this you state [from Scripture]: "In the beginning God cre- ated the heavens and the earth" (Genesis 1:1). I might understand [from this verse] that the one who precedes in Scripture actually takes prece- dence. [However] when it says, "On the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven" (Genesis 2:4), this declares that the two of them are equal to each other. [3C] Similarly to this you state [from Scripture]: "And he said, 'I am the God of your father, God of Abraham, God of Isaac and the God of Jacob'" 18</page><page sequence="19">Oral Orthography (Exodus 3:6). I might understand [from this verse] that the one which precedes in speech is more important than his companion. [However] when it says, "'And I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac and my covenant with Abraham' " (Leviticus 26:42), this declares that the three of them were equal. [3D] Similarly to this you state [from Scripture]: "Honor your father and your mother" (Exodus 20:12). I might understand [from this verse] that the one who precedes in Scripture actually takes precedence. [However] when it says, "You shall each fear his mother and his father" (Leviticus 19:3), this declares that the two of them are equal to each other. [3E] Similarly to this you state [from Scripture]: "And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh" (Numbers 14:6). I might understand [from this verse] that the one who precedes in Scripture actually takes precedence. [However] Scripture states, "'none except Caleb son of Je- phunneh and Joshua son of Nun' " (Numbers 32:12), [and] this declares that the two of them are equal to each other. Our text offers yet another interpretation of the clause "to Moses and Aaron" from our base verse. Employing reasoning that is identical to that used in [lA], the text argues in [3A] that this clause in our base verse could lead one to assume er- roneously that the order in which names are listed in Scripture is indicative of se- quential levels of grandeur or importance, thus causing one to believe that Moses was superior to Aaron. As evidence to the contrary, our commentary adduces Ex- odus 6:26, which mentions Aaron before Moses. The text concludes that, by specif- ically mentioning Aaron first on one occasion and Moses first on the other, Scrip- ture indicates that both men were "equal to each other." Then, in [3B]-[3E], our commentary adduces numerous, identical scriptural examples of this point. Focusing for the moment on [3A], it is interesting how the Mekhilta of Rab- bi Ishmael attempts to portray the relationship between Moses and Aaron as one that was simultaneously equal and unequal. In both this section and in unit [l A]- [IB], our text emphasizes that Moses' honor was superior to Aaron's. This stands in sharp contrast to unit [2A], which stresses the parity of grandeur between the two. We saw a similar, although less pronounced, portrayal of the stature of these two men in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai: [B 1 ]-[B4] claims that Scrip- ture "equates the greatness of Aaron with the greatness of Moses," whereas [C I]- [C10] implies that Moses was the first (and only) person to receive divine com- mands directly from God, because of his greater prestige. Thus, in treating our base verse, both texts incorporate traditions that appear to be mutually contradictory. We will give this point additional consideration below. We must also ask if it is accurate to claim that there is a parallel tradition in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai to this section. It certainly appears to dis- play some affinity with [C1]-[C10]. Both units are alike in that they are concerned with the meaning of sequential order; in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael, the con- cern is with the order of scriptural wording, whereas in the Mekhilta ofRabbi Shimon b. Yohai, the concern is with the order of transmission of divine communication. 19</page><page sequence="20">W David Nelson Both sections are also alike rhetorically, in that they both repeat the exact same ar- gument over and over again to illustrate their point. Despite these affinities, however, we cannot fail to notice even stronger signs of dissimilarity. For example, although both of these units are preoccupied with the significance of the word order of Scripture, they reach diametrically opposite conclusions about such significance. The unit in the Mekhilta ofRabbi Ishmael de- termines that one may not assume that the order of wording in Scripture is indica- tive of importance. In fact, if the word order of Scripture signifies anything, it is, as the text declares, the equality of Moses and Aaron. However, in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai, the commentary relies upon the order of scriptural word- ing to determine the importance of Moses over Aaron, as illustrated by the order in which they received and transmitted divine communication. Thus, for the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai, word order can signify actual precedence. The correspondence and relationship between these two units of traditions is, therefore, difficult to describe with precision. On the one hand, they do share a common interest in the meaning of sequential order. On the other hand, they dis- play their concern with reference to different models of order (i.e., the order of scriptural wording and the order of transmission of divine communication), and the texts reach diametrically opposite conclusions about what such order signifies. What we have in these two units can, at best, be described as thematic parallelism. Our base verse triggered in both commentaries a common thematic impulse; how- ever, each text preserves distinctly different exegetical reactions to this impulse, with each version following a separate exegetical path and reaching distinctly dif- ferent conclusions. Moreover, these reactions should not be understood as stem- ming primarily from authorial, compositional impulses, but rather, primarily from oral-performative ones. That is, what these two texts preserve in written format are not separately "authored" or "edited" versions of a common core of tradition, each of which was considered by its rabbinic authorship to be authoritative or exhaus- tive. Rather, they are written/textual exemplifications of equally valid interpretive options available to the rabbinic sage in his employment of this thematic core of exegetical tradition. Moreover, when taken together as a whole, these versions are representative of the free and fluctuating oral-performative employment of tradi- tion that characterized the fluid engagement with tradition, which served as the very basis of the pedagogical setting and system of early Rabbinism. We continue in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael: [4A] "(The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron) in the Land of Egypt saying:" (Exodus 12:1) [This means that the Lord spoke to them] outside the city. You say outside the city. Was it not, rather, within the city? [However] when it says, "And Moses said to him, 'When I have left the city (I shall spread my hands to the Lord' " (Exodus 9:29), [then] doesn't logical rea- soning apply? [4B] Just as with the prayer [in Exodus 9:29], Moses would pray only outside of the city, then in regard to divine speech, the more important [of the two], it is logical that it would be spoken to him only outside of the city! 20</page><page sequence="21">Oral Orthography And why wasn't it spoken to him within the city? Because it was full of abominations and idols! Our commentary shifts its attention to the clause "in the Land of Egypt" in our base verse. Whereas the parallel relationship of the unit discussed above was opaque and difficult to define, section [4A]-[4B] corresponds quite closely to [B 1]-[B2] in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai. Both units of tradition are thematically alike, employ the same exegetical ploy, share similar rhetoric, and reach the same conclusion. Only minor differences in wording prevent these two units from corresponding in exact fashion. As we shall see below, however, the strong parallelism between these two units of tradition does not preclude each text from reacting in distinctly different ways to the shared theme they both discuss. The Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael continues: [5A] Before the Land of Israel was designated, all the lands were suitable for divine speech. Once the Land of Israel was designated [however], all the other lands were eliminated. [5B] Before Jerusalem was designated, all of the Land of Israel was suitable for sacrificial altars. Once Jerusalem was designated [however], [the rest of] the Land of Israel was eliminated. As it says in Scripture, "Be care- ful, lest you offer up your burnt offerings in any place you like; rather only in the place which the Lord your God will choose (in one of your tribal territories)" (Deuteronomy 12:13). [5C] Before the Temple was designated, all of Jerusalem was worthy of the Divine Presence. Once the Temple was designated [however, the rest of] Jerusalem was eliminated. As it says in Scripture, "For the Lord has cho- sen Zion. (He has desired it for His seat)" (Psalms 132:13). And it teach- es further in Scripture, "'This is my resting-place for all time. (Here I will dwell, for I desire it)"' (Psalms 132:14). [5D] Before Aaron was designated, all of Israel was suitable for the priesthood. Once Aaron was designated [however], all of Israel was eliminated. As it says in Scripture, "'(All the sacred gifts that the Israelites set aside for the Lord I give to you, to your sons, and to the daughters that are with you, as a due for all time.) It shall be an everlasting covenant of salt be- fore the Lord (for you and for your offspring as well)'" (Numbers 18:19). And it teaches further in Scripture "'It shall be for him and his descen- dants after him (a pact of priesthood for all time)' " (Numbers 25:13). [5E] Before David was designated, all of Israel was suitable for the kingship. Once David was designated [however], all of Israel was eliminated. As it says in Scripture, "'Certainly you know that the Lord God of Israel gave David kingship (over Israel forever)' " (2 Chronicles 13:5). The placement of this unit of tradition here is most probably due to the text's discussion in [4A]-[4B] about the unsuitability of the Egyptian city for divine 21</page><page sequence="22">W David Nelson communication. Picking up on this topic, [5A] discusses the suitability of lands other than the Land of Israel for divine speech. [5B]-[5E] follows, providing ad- ditional examples of similar delimitations. Despite this association, however, the repetition31 of this section is somewhat disjunctive and incongruous with the unit that preceded it. When we compare this unit to its parallel in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai, we can make a number of interesting observations. First, the parallel to this unit is [Al] in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai, and as such, it is not only considerably smaller, but also situated in an entirely different context within that text's commentary, where it serves as the overall starting point for its inter- pretation of this base verse. Thus, whereas unit [4A]-[4B] in the Mekhilta ofRab- bi Ishmael has triggered an association with this thematic tradition, we see that such an association is entirely absent in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai af- ter [B1]-[B2]. In fact, we have already discussed above the correspondence of [B3]-[B4] with an entirely different portion of the commentary in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael. Moreover, we must note the brevity of the parallel in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai, compared to the protracted discussion in [5A]-[5E] of the Mekhil- ta of Rabbi Ishmael; in actuality, [Al] is more precisely described as a parallel specifically to [5A] in the Mekhilta ofRabbi Ishmael. However, even between these two sections, we cannot fail to notice some blatant differences. For example, even though both of these units share a common theme, [Al] in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai builds upon this shared theme, by using it as a segue to what fol- lows in [A2]-[A6]: But once the Land of Israel was so consecrated, there was not divine speech with the prophets at any place [outside the Land of Israel], except next to water. Such a thematic diversion is entirely lacking in [5A] in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ish- mael, which is followed instead by additional illustrative examples of the same the- matic point. In fact, due to its marked repetition, wherein the same point is made over and over again in precisely the same way, but through different examples and prooftexts, it is difficult to view [5A]-[5E] as an integrated portion of our com- mentary. Although we shall be able to discern thematic continuity between [5A] and the unit immediately following this section, the numerous illustrations in [5B]-[5E] serve only to disrupt the flow of our commentary, by introducing mul- tiple, repetitive examples that have little, if any, connection to the text's immediate interpretive agenda. The inclusion of these numerous, repetitious examples com- pels us to view this unit as an awkward interjection of a separate collection of tra- dition into the text's overall treatment of our base verse. 31. As brought to my attention by the anonymous reader of this paper, the repetitive sequence of 5A-5E is intentionally programmatic in that it progresses from a broad/outermost geographical lo- cation (Land of Israel) to a narrow/innermost location (Temple), and then from an inclusive model of priest and king (all of Israel) to a most restrictive model (Aaron to David). As a result, the text both le- gitimizes and connects the Aaronide priesthood and Davidic monarchy. 22</page><page sequence="23">Oral Orthography Because of these characteristics, this section is most plausibly understood as a self-contained, independent unit that was interpolated in its entirety into our com- mentary at this juncture, presumably because of the thematic unity it displays at [5A]. As such, this unit appears to preserve in written form a variety of rhetorically similar illustrations of a common thematic point. Therefore, rather than attempt to perceive this unit as an integrally composed portion of our commentary, I suggest it is better to understand it as an example of an independently transmitted exercise in rabbinic rhetorical exegetical presentation.32 The rhetorical pattern of this exer- cise is: Before X was designated, all Y were suitable for Z. Once X was designated, all Y were eliminated, As it says in Scripture [prooftext(s)]. Accordingly, what we have in [5A]-[5E] is a mnemonic framework into which one could place an array of examples and prooftexts to illustrate a common, thematic point: the gradual delimitation of holy boundaries. The rabbinic disciple would memorize this framework, using it to increase his facility with its various examples, and to hone his oratorical ability to illustrate this point in a variety of ways and with a variety of accompanying scriptural prooftexts. In this manner, the rabbinic disciple could incorporate any suitable example from this framework into his oration with apparent ease and lack of effort. Additionally, I suggest that in the parallel to this unit in the Mekhilta ofRab- bi Shimon b. Yohai at [Al] we are presented with an illustration of how a single ex- cerpt could be extracted from this mnemonic framework and seamlessly incorpo- rated into a momentary exegetical setting to suit its immediate needs. Such an understanding helps to account, as well, for the slight variations in style, phrasing, and word usage that exist between these textual parallels. Thus, we can perceive in these parallel textual units a glimpse into the oral circulatory system within which they functioned, along with an example of the interaction between written preser- vation of rabbinic tradition and their oral-performative setting. Of course, neither of these two units should be viewed as "primary" or "secondary," but rather, as si- multaneously independent and interdependent, for both texts preserve, at best, a brief, fleeting glimpse of this tradition's broad employment in early rabbinic liter- ary culture. Returning to our commentary in the Mekhilta ofRabbi Ishmael, the text con- tinues: [5F] If you were to say [regarding the issue of divine speech in and outside the Land of Israel]: I can claim [the case of] the prophets, to whom [di- vine speech] was spoken outside of the Land, [then it could be countered that] even though it was spoken to them outside of the Land, it was [still] only spoken to them because of the merit of the forefathers. 32. My understanding of this unit is strongly influenced by, and indebted to, the conceptual model created by M. Jaffee in "The Oral-Cultural Context of the Talmud Yerushalmi," in Schtifer, The Talmud Yerushalmi in Graeco-Roman Culture I. 23</page><page sequence="24">W. David Nelson [5G] As it says in Scripture, "So says the Lord, 'A cry is heard in Ramah, (wailing, bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for her children. She refuses to be comforted for her children, who are gone.)' So says the Lord, 'Re- strain your voice from weeping, your eyes from shedding tears. For there is reward for your labor.' declares the Lord" (Jeremiah 31:14-15). [5H] And there are those who say that even though it was spoken to them out- side the Land because of the merit of the forefathers, it was [still] only spoken at a pure place of water. As it says in Scripture, "And I was by the river Ulai .. ." (Daniel 8:2). And it teaches further in Scripture, "And I was beside the great river, the Tigris" (Daniel 10:4). And it teaches fur- ther in Scripture, "The word of the Lord came to Ezekiel, son of Buzi the priest, beside the river Chebar" (Ezekiel 1:3). [51] And there are those who say that [divine speech] was spoken to him (i.e., Ezekiel) inside the Land, and was spoken to him outside the Land. As it says in Scripture, "The word of the Lord came ("ron ,rr'7")" (Ezekiel 1:3). ",r,": Because it was spoken to him in the Land; "non": Because it was spoken to him outside the Land. [5J] Rabbi Eleazar b. Zadok said, "Behold Scripture states, 'Arise! Go out to the plain!' (Ezekiel 3:22). This declares that the plain was suitable (as well for divine speech). As I mentioned above, our text resumes here in response to [5A]. Challenging the assertion in [5A] that once the Land of Israel was designated as the specific lo- cation for divine speech, all such subsequent communication took place only with- in its borders, [5F] adduces the example of the prophets, to whom God obviously spoke outside of the Land during periods of exile. However, the text notes that, even in the case of the prophets, God only spoke with them outside the Land due to the special merit accrued by the forefathers (or more precisely, in view of the prooftext from Jeremiah, foremothers) on behalf of Israel. For proof of this assertion, the com- mentary turns to the prooftext from Jeremiah, which, in its opinion, portrays Rachel crying out to God to save the exiled Israelites. God responds to Rachel's plea, and, because of her intercession, God communicates with the prophets in exile. [5H] presents a slightly different (but very familiar) alternative to the chal- lenge in [5F]; namely, that even when God spoke to the prophets outside of the Land of Israel, such communication took place only near a body of water. The text produces three prooftexts in support of this point, the final of which comes from Ezekiel. Having mentioned Ezekiel, the text in [5I] focuses on the usage of the ab- solute infinitive in Ezekiel 1:3. The text concludes that this "unusual" form is em- ployed by the biblical text to indicate that God spoke to Ezekiel both inside and outside the Land of Israel. Finally, in [5J] Rabbi Eleazar b. Zadok challenges the claim in [5H] that all divine communication outside of the Land of Israel took place next to a body of water, understanding Ezekiel 3:22 to indicate that the plain was also a suitable location. [5F]-[5J] clearly represents a continuation of the topic first raised in [5A], thus deepening our conviction that [5B]-[5E] is a disjunctive and incongruous in- 24</page><page sequence="25">Oral Orthography clusion in our commentary. We have already discussed the close correlation be- tween [5A] and [Al] in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai. Moreover, we can easily perceive in the brief outline of [5F]-[5J] above a high degree of parallelism to sections [A2]-[A6] in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai. Thus, by disre- garding the inconsonant unit [5B]-[5E], we have two distinctly parallel units: [Al]-[A6] in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai and [5A], [5F]-[5J] in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael. An analysis of the correspondence and relationship between these two units reveals a type or degree of parallelism that we have already observed: the two units simultaneously display some striking similarities and some pronounced differ- ences. For example, [Al]-[A2] in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai is virtu- ally identical to [5A], [5H] in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael, so much so that they even adduce precisely the same prooftexts. However, in the midst of this corre- spondence we are presented with [5F]-[5G] in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael, which is entirely unparalleled in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai. We also discern a strong degree of parallelism between units [A4]-[A6] and [51], both of which address the usage of the infinitive absolute in Ezekiel 1:3. Nonetheless, we see, as well, that the two texts reach entirely different conclusions about the sig- nificance of Scripture's usage of this verbal form. Finally, there are sections in both texts that are unparalleled in their counterparts: [5J] in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ish- mael has no parallel in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai, and [A3] in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai, which we discussed at great length above, is (at least for the moment) unmatched in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael. It is evident, therefore, that both versions share a common thematic and exegetical framework. To conclude otherwise would require that we ignore an overwhelming amount of corroborative evidence. Concurrently, however, the dis- tinctions between the two versions reveal a framework that is both fluid and flex- ible, readily adapted to suit the exegetical whim and fancy of its many tradents. Represented in these two parallel presentations are dual manipulations of a com- mon body of tradition, a shared nucleus of lore frequently associated exegetical- ly with this particular point in Scripture. Our base verse serves to trigger these mutual associations in the collective memories of those who have encountered previously versions of these traditions of interpretation, bringing to mind this shared framework in correlative and distinctive fashion. Both texts rely on this thematic core as they present their exegetical treatments of our base verse, but their reliance is not absolute, because the core of tradition itself is not absolute. Neither version can be declared definitive or authoritative, because such a ver- sion simply never existed. To declare that the differences between these two presentations of parallel materials are simply the result of separate compositional editorial processes over- simplifies the complex relationship between the textual units, and overlooks the literary incoherence that they both display. Rather, what we see here is the written residue and representation of the oral culture within which these traditions devel- oped and flourished. Or stated differently, the written preservations of these tradi- tions chirographically mirror and mimic the oral milieu within which these tradi- tions thrived. 25</page><page sequence="26">W. David Nelson The Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael continues: [6A] Know this! That the divine presence is not revealed outside the Land of Israel! As it says in Scripture, "And Jonah rose to flee from before the Lord to Tarshish" (Jonah 1:2). And was it really possible for him to flee from before the Lord? For wasn't it already stated in Scripture, "Where can I escape from your spir- it? If I arise to heaven, there you are If I rise up on the wings of dawn (there your hand will be) Your right hand will be holding me fast" (Psalms 139:7-10). And it is written, "Those are the eyes of the Lord, ranging over all the Earth" (Zechariah 4:10). And it is written, "The eyes of the Lord are everywhere, seeing good and bad" (Proverbs 15:3). [And it is writ- ten,] "If they burrow down to Sheol. If they hide on top of Carmel. If they go into captivity" (Amos 9:2-4). And it states further in Scripture, "Nei- ther darkness nor gloom (a hiding place for evildoers)" (Job 34:22). Rather, Jonah said, "I will take myself outside the Land, [to a] place where the divine presence is not revealed, since the Gentiles [in Nin- eveh] are quick to repent, [I do not want] to implicate Israel!" [6B] A parable about a servant of a priest who fled from his master. He said, "I'll take myself to the cemetery, to a place where my master cannot come after me." His master said to him, "I have [other] Canaanite (ser- vants) like you [who can chase after you for me]!" Likewise, Jonah said, "I will take myself outside the Land, [to a] place where the divine presence is not revealed, since the Gentiles [in Nin- eveh] are quick to repent, [I do not want] to implicate Israel!" God said to him, "I have [other] agents like you!" As it says in Scripture, "But the Lord flung a great wind into the sea" (Jonah 1:4). [6C] Consequently, you say there were three types of prophets. One who in- sisted on the honor of the father (i.e., God) and the honor of the son (i.e., Children of Israel), one who insisted upon the honor of the father, but not the honor of the son, and one who insisted on the honor of the son, but not the honor of the father. Jeremiah insisted upon the honor of the father and the honor of the son. As it says in Scripture, "We have transgressed and we have rebelled, but you have not forgiven [us]!" (Lamentations 3:42) Thus, his prophe- cy was doubled. As it says in Scripture, ". .. and added unto them were words" (Jeremiah 36:32). Elijah insisted on the honor of the father, but not the honor of the son. As it says in Scripture, "'I am moved by zeal for the Lord, the God of Hosts (for the Israelites have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your al- tars, and have put your prophets to the sword. I alone am left, and they are out to take my life'" (I Kings 19:14). And what is [also] stated there?: "The Lord said to him, 'Go back upon your way to the wilderness of Damascus and anoint Jehu son of Nimshi as King over Israel, and El- isha son of Shaphat as prophet to succeed you'" (1 Kings 19:15-16). And Scripture states "as prophet to succeed you" only [in order to imply that God meant] "I am not pleased with your prophecy." 26</page><page sequence="27">Oral Orthography Jonah insisted upon the honor of the son, but not the honor of the fa- ther. As it says in Scripture, "And Jonah arose to flee" (Jonah 1:2). What (else) is written?: "The word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time, saying" (Jonah 3:1). (This means that the divine speech) was spoken to him a second time, but not a third. [6D] R. Nathan said, "Jonah fled only in order to kill himself in the sea." As it says in Scripture, "And he said to them, 'Take me up and throw me to the sea!'" (Jonah 1:12). And likewise will you find [that] the patriarchs and prophets would give themselves (i.e., give their lives) for the sake of Israel! "What does it say in Scripture concerning Moses?: "'And now, if you will forgive their sin [good]. And if not, please erase me from the book which you have written!'" (Exodus 32:32). "'And if such you do to me, kill me please if I have found favor in your eyes, and let me see no more of my wretchedness!'" (Numbers 11:15). "What does it say in Scripture concerning David?: "'Behold! I have sinned! I have done wrong! But these sheep, what did they do? Let your hand fall upon me and my house!'" (2 Samuel 24:17). "Thus, you find everywhere that the patriarchs and prophets gave their lives for the sake of Israel!" Our text's commentary takes an intriguing turn in this lengthy section. Hav- ing dealt extensively with the topic of the location of divine speech, the Mekhilta ofRabbi Ishmael now explores the same interest, but in terms of the revelatory lo- cation of the divine presence. The nomenclature is, in fact, synonymous; the di- vine presence can only be revealed through speech. Moreover, the exclamatory term ("Know this!") that is employed to begin this section certainly appears to link this unit with those immediately prior to it. As such, it seems that the text uses this unit to bring to a conclusion the topic of divine speech in and outside of the Land of Israel that it first raised in [5A], and chooses to find little significance in the fine distinction between the revelation of the divine presence and divine speech. In [6A] the text declares that the divine presence is not revealed outside the Land of Israel, relying on the case of Jonah as illustrative evidence. The exegeti- cal assumption here is that Jonah chose to ignore the divine imperative to go to Nineveh, because he knew that the Ninevites would quickly repent in response to the divine admonition he would deliver. In Jonah's mind, this would be an embar- rassment to the Children of Israel, who so stubbornly refused to acknowledge and rectify their disobedient behavior. Thus, by relying on the fact that the divine pres- ence would not be revealed (through speech) outside of the Land's boundaries, and by fleeing to a location outside the Land of Israel, Jonah was confident that he could ultimately escape God's command and protect the Israelites from the con- comitant shame. By interpreting Jonah's motives in this manner, our text subtly redefines his character as it is portrayed in the biblical narrative. In the biblical tale, Jonah's stub- born refusal to obey God's command is motivated presumably out of ego. He knows that if he travels to Nineveh and proclaims its impending destruction, the 27</page><page sequence="28">W David Nelson Ninevites will repent and subdue God's anger, and he will appear to be a false prophet. The rabbinic representation of Jonah, as displayed here in our text, depicts a prophet who acts out of blind love for his people, choosing even to disobey God's imperative, rather than implicate his fellow Israelites. In this manner, our text man- ages to reinterpret Jonah as a heroic character, one who sacrifices his own well- being for the good of others. Following the parable in [6B], the commentary proceeds to a related dis- cussion of the three types of prophets ("sons") and their corresponding rewards and punishments. Jeremiah, the ideal prophet, insisted upon the respect due to both the Children of Israel and God, by acknowledging both the indiscretions of the Israelites and God's failure to forgive them. As a result, his prophecy increased. Elijah ignored the fate of the Israelites, focusing solely upon God's honor. Conse- quently, God readied Elisha as Elijah's successor as a sign of displeasure. Finally, Jonah protected the honor of the Children of Israel to the detriment of God's hon- or; therefore, God ceased communication with him once and for all. Finally, in [6D] R. Nathan intensifies the portrayal of the heroic actions of Jonah, arguing that he was actually willing to martyr himself for the benefit of the Israelites he so des- perately wished to protect. According to Nathan, Jonah's actions place him on par with the foremost Israelite leaders-Moses and David. We are presented, therefore, with a carefully crafted unit of interpretation, one that incorporates a variety of subjects, while simultaneously building upon the common theme of the heroism of Jonah. As we mentioned above, this unit shares a thematic concern with the unit beginning in [5A]: the topic of divine speech in and outside of the Land of Israel. However, the relationship is somewhat disjunc- tive, due to the different nomenclature used to express this interest. Moreover, what we do not have in this unit is a core of tradition about Jonah that is concerned with emphasizing that the divine speech to Jonah outside of the Land of Israel occurred next to water. This adds an additional disjunctive element to the thematic link be- tween this unit and the prior unit, where such an emphasis is found in [5H]. Having examined and compared these two parallel textual sections, we will now distance ourselves from the minute details, in order to gain a broad perspec- tive on the material, and to make some global observations. Our tour of these units has revealed an extremely complex, multifaceted parallel relationship between these units, one that defies a simplistic or conceptually crude characterization. On the one hand, our comparison of these two units has revealed how, to a limited ex- tent, these two parallel units of tradition do share compositional characteristics. To some degree, it is possible to surmise that these units of tradition have been in- corporated into the versions of these two texts we have come to possess today with consideration placed on each text's larger editorial frameworks. Or stated differ- ently, both versions display some evidence of an editorial willingness to shuffle and arrange portions of these units of tradition in different ways, in order to suit an editorial design and purpose that is independent of, or greater than, the tradi- tions themselves. Both versions also employ unique technical terminology, which is also evidence of separate editorial influences. On the other hand, however, we have seen concurrently aspects of these two parallel units that appear to defy compositional logic and intentionality--instances 28</page><page sequence="29">Oral Orthography wherein it is difficult, if not impossible, to perceive any conscious attempt on be- half of these texts' editors to arrange the units of tradition at their disposal in ac- cord with a cogent and systematic literary structure. For example, we pointed out instances in both texts of baffling, disjunctive interpolation of textual materials that apparently serves only to disrupt the texts' thematic development and flow. Often- times, therefore, the array of tradition in either text is, at best, episodic and hap- hazard, devoid of any signs of systematic intentionality. Due to this bifurcated attention to compositional coherence in these texts, we are precluded both from proclaiming these texts to be full-fledged "composi- tions" or "essays," and from summarily dismissing either text as a simple hodge- podge of tradition. Regarding this phenomenon, common in various degrees to all early rabbinic texts, Martin Jaffee states: There is enough coherence in many Rabbinic compilations to justify the pos- tulate of some sort of governing plan that informs the collection of interme- diate units into larger documentary wholes. Yet these wholes are just disjunc- tive enough in structure to caution us against subjecting them to hermeneutical torture in order to secure their confession of harboring some sort of compre- hensive redactional intentionality.33 In order, therefore, to acknowledge both the compositional and disjunctive aspects of rabbinic compilations, Jaffee proposes adopting the model of the "anthology":34 The compilations are collections of materials-our previously mentioned in- termediate units or Schaefer's microforms-known widely from antecedent tradition. They were brought together, after complex transmission histories of their own, in diverse new constellations depending upon the framework in which they were anthologized and the diverse degree of redactional interven- tion employed by their compilers. The documentary compilation is a kind of freeze-frame of that tradition, temporarily stilled by the intervention of the compilational activity itself. But that activity was not conceived as the pro- duction of a finished "work."35 The advantage of this model is the flexibility it provides to account for both the compositional and ad hoc characteristics displayed in various degrees by all rab- binic textual compilations. On the one hand, rabbinic authorial tendencies can come to the forefront, and we can allow for the fact that, oftentimes, the rabbis did "compose" as they arranged, altered and preserved tradition in writing. However, on the other hand, we allow as well for the fact that such "compositional" impulses 33. Jaffee, "Oral Tradition in the Writing of Rabbinic Oral Torah," 38. 34. Jaffee is careful to point out the coincidental affinities between his work here and the work of M. Bregman in "Midrash Rabbah and the Medieval Collector's Mentality," Prooftexts 17 (Winter 1997): 63-76, and E. Segal, "Anthological Dimensions of the Babylonian Talmud," Prooftexts 17 (Win- ter 1997). Current versions of both of these efforts appear in D. Stern, ed., TheAnthology in Jewish Lit- erature (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004). 35.

Finally, and most importantly, this model refuses to ascribe "prima- cy" to any rabbinic compilation, acknowledging that every written representation of rabbinic tradition is, at most, only a momentary "snapshot" of the tradition it preserves. Rabbinic compilations, therefore, preserve only fleeting glimpses of tra- ditions that were otherwise fluid, dynamic, and ever changing. When we attend, therefore, to an evaluation of the compositional character- istics of our parallel texts from the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael and the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai, we are well served by such a conceptual model. Moreover, one can easily argue that the very function of these tannaitic midrashic texts-to preserve, associate, and affix rabbinic tradition to the flowing words of the bibli- cal text-is at its very core primarily an anthological endeavor. We desire, how- ever, to move beyond an evaluation of only the compositional aspects of our texts, and to examine them for clues and insights into rabbinic oral culture in which they flourished and functioned.36 However, in doing so, we must remain focused upon these compositional characteristics of the texts we examined immediately above. That is, given the fact that we have no written evidence of the prior existence of the traditions we study in these texts, we have only these amoraic written repre- sentations to turn to for such insight into their oral tannaitic provenance. Thus, we are forced to appeal to amoraic written representation of tannaitic tradition, in or- der to gain knowledge of this tradition's anterior oral existence. A more appropri- ate lens, therefore, though which to examine and evaluate the relationship of our parallel texts from the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai and the Mekhilta ofRab- bi Ishmael is one that attends to both the compositional characteristics of the lit- erature, while simultaneously attending to the dynamic, performative world of ear- ly rabbinic pedagogical instruction that made usage of this literature. We saw above the complex nature of the relationship between the two tex- tual excerpts. In some instances, portions of these units corresponded with near exactitude, whereas at other times the texts displayed only the slightest correlation. The two units often hovered around a common theme or topic, but reached op- posing exegetical conclusions or followed separate interpretive tangents. Often- times, both texts possessed parallel textual materials placed in different exegetical settings, or included interpolations of self-contained, but entirely unrelated, units of tradition. In some instances, we perceived in one text the "echoes" of themes absent in that particular text, but fully developed in the other. Whereas such a convoluted relationship baffles the imagination informed solely by compositional considerations, it gains clarification when viewed in ac- 36. Mention must be made here of the valuable work of Steven Fraade on the tannaitic midrashim. Fraade has argued convincingly that the early rabbinic choice of scriptural commentary for the preservation of tradition for the tannaitic midrashim is, in itself, highly indicative of the discursive world within which that very tradition flourished and functioned. See, in particular, S. Fraade, "Sifre Deuteronomy 26 (ad Deut. 3:23): How Conscious the Composition?" Hebrew Union College Annual 54 (1983): 245-301; S. Fraade, "Interpreting Midrash I: Midrash and the History of Judaism," Proof- texts 7 (1987): 179-94; and S.

Of fundamental im- portance in this relationship was the ability of the disciple to declaim rabbinic tra- dition from memory, in both a homiletical and extemporaneously dialogical set- ting. Within this culture, rabbinic tradition on the page was theologically impotent; it was only when spoken aloud that the words of rabbinic tradition realized their efficacious potential. As stated by Jaffee: Those who might read the texts of rabbinic teaching in isolation from the dis- cipleship experience had neither the complete text nor any torah, for proper- ly transformative knowledge could not be gained by discursive understanding of any text on its own .... For torah to be present, the Sage must be present as its unmediated source and embodiment in word and deed.38 Situating our excerpts from the Mekhiltot within this pedagogical context, the early rabbinic student of tradition, upon encountering either of these textual passages in the course of his study, would immediately recognize and recall their, shared fundamental themes, major emphases, invoked prooftexts, and exegetical ploys from innumerable encounters-both oral and written-with this body of tra- dition in the past. Either one of our textual presentations would resound positive- ly in the memory of those who populated the early rabbinic communities of learn- ing-both masters and disciples-who over the course of time had become familiar and comfortable with its integral commonalities of scope, topic and con- text. They would read and reread numerous parallel, but different, presentations of this shared body of tradition, and learn to associate these fundamental themes and topics, along with their accompanying collection of biblical prooftexts, with this specific scriptural locale. After time, the association would become commonplace for both teacher of tradition and his student, both of whom would eventually be unable to encounter Exodus 12:1 without immediately invoking this body of ex- egetical tradition. The members of early rabbinic learning communities would never come to view any single presentation-be it written or oral-of this collection of lore as authoritative or decisive, but would, rather, learn to shape and alter it to suit their immediate exegetical needs.

Both master and disciple, therefore, were constantly sur- rounded by an oral/aural and chirographic culture that mutually reinforced such a dynamic and dialogical transmission of tradition. Moreover, the rabbinic master or disciple would present this body of tradi- tion performatively to an audience equally familiar with its multifaceted similari- ties and variations of theme and topic. As a result, the rabbinic performer of tradi- tion could allow his unique presentation of the material to echo and resound with previous, different presentations in the very same way our two parallel excerpts of- ten subtly echoed each other. Such a knowledgeable audience afforded the per- former the luxury of subtle reference and oblique innuendo as he reshaped and represented tradition in a performative setting, just as our parallel texts often pre- sumed prior knowledge or context in their presentation of the materials. We see, therefore, how the chirographic aspects of rabbinic texts mimic the oral culture that produced their constituent texts.39 Our parallel texts from the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai and the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael are but two examples of such transformative textuali- ty, two "snapshots" taken of an otherwise eternally malleable mass of exegetical tradition as it traveled along its performative path through the learning communi- ties of the earliest rabbis. Indeed, our examination of these two excerpts was not entirely unlike the talmud torah undertaken by rabbinic disciples in their study of these texts, in that it has produced for us many of the same transformative and as- sociative qualities. As a result of our comparison of these two texts, Aaron will al- ways struggle with Moses for equality of stature, God will eternally speak some- how only to Moses, and yet also to Aaron, and the order of scriptural lists will endlessly signify both nothing and everything. These themes will forever resound in our consciousness, particularly in association with our seemingly benign base verse. As a result, we not only familiarized ourselves with a significant body of early rabbinic tradition, but also acculturated ourselves-attuned our literary sen- sibilities-to the paradoxical, dialogical, and dynamic ways of rabbinic talmud torah.

Fraade in From Tradition to Commentary, 19: "We gain here a glimpse of the literary face of an otherwise oral circulatory system of study and teaching by whose illocutionary force disciples became sages, and sages became a class that could ex- tend their teachings, practices, and view of the world into Jewish society more broadly." 32</page></plain_text>
