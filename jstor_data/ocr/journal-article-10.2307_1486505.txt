Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1992. xii, 211 pp. Robert Schine's insightful study of Max Wiener recovers an intellectual figure who marks a major generational turning point within German-Jewish thought just before German Judaism was destroyed. Heir to the theological tradition of Abraham Geiger, Leo Baeck, and Hermann Cohen, but aware of its intellectual limitations, Wiener developed a revisionist liberal Jewish theology that supported Zionism. Schine's presentation is a fine example of intellectual biography. With sensitivity to the mood as well as the ideas of the era, he successfully evokes the milieu of German religious life in the first decades of the twentieth century. Wiener becomes vivid through Schine's thoughtful use of published memoirs and family recollections. Further, he animates his account with a hitherto-unpublished critique of Wiener by Cohen that, as Schine demonstrates, illustrates the break between the two generations of liberal Jewish thought. Wiener, born in 1882 to an observant family, was raised in the Jewish community of Oppeln, in Upper Silesia, whose rabbis began in the mid- nineteenth century to advocate religious reforms of Judaism. Exposed as a youngster to the major discussions of European Jewish life, Wiener developed a close relationship with Baeck, rabbi in Oppeln from 1895 to 1907. After studying at the universities and the rabbinical seminaries of Breslau and Berlin, Wiener became Baeck's rabbinic assistant in Dtisseldorf from 1907 to 1912. He then moved to Stettin, where he inherited a community in the midst of controversy over religious reforms. Wiener's years as a military chaplain during World War I stimulated his reconsideration of Jewish nationhood,</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 235 eventually leading him to an affirmation of Zionism, albeit built more on emotion than political argument, as Schine points out. Baeck helped to arrange Wiener's invitation to Berlin in 1926, where he remained an instructor at the Hochschule ftir die Wissenschaft des Judentums until he fled to the United States in 1939. He first taught in the Preparatory Department of Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, an intellectually disappointing experience, and in 1943 moved to Congregation Habonim in New York City, home to many German refugees, where he remained as educator and "special rabbi" until his death in 1950. Schine's starting point is Wiener's 1908 study, Die Anschauungen der Propheten von der Sittlichkeit ("The Views of the Prophets on Morality"), in which he fought with Cohen's tools against the old Kantian claim that Judaism consists of heteronomous commands, not genuine morality. By 1919, however, Wiener broke with Cohen, in an essay entitled "Nationalismus und Universalismus bei den jtidischen Propheten" ("Nationalism and Universalism in the Jewish Prophets"), written as part of a larger controversy over Ernst Troeltsch's interpretation of prophetic ethics as the product of particular social and political cultures in ancient Palestine. Troeltsch's conclusion that prophetic ethics were not universally applicable had aroused Cohen's ire, resulting in a strong rejoinder. Fighting against a long line of German theologians who claimed the prophets as the exclusive heritage of Christianity, Cohen affirmed Judaism as the authentic and legitimate heir of the prophets, who had taught a universal religion of ethics, based on a strict monotheism. For Cohen, Judaism's mission was to preserve the prophetic message of ethical monotheism and bring it to all the nations of the world. But if Troeltsch had viewed the prophets in their historical context, Wiener now viewed theological scholarship in its historical context. He concluded that the liberal Jewish view of prophetic universalism "was an apologetical response to an apologetical position of liberal Christianity" (Schine, p. 64), and he began to forge a new theological path. Judaism's mission was not simply to be a light to the nations, but also to recognize its own "ethnic self- consciousness." Thus Wiener reclaimed a national idea for liberal Judaism, leading eventually to his affirmation of Zionism, expressed in articles and lectures written during the 1920s. In his best-known book, Das Judentum im Zeitalter der Emanzipation ("Judaism in the Age of Emancipation"), a classic study of nineteenth-century German-Jewish thought published in</page><page sequence="3">236 BOOK REVIEWS 1933, Zionism emerges in Wiener's conclusion as the only possible future for Judaism in a post-halakhic age. Schine provides an intriguing discussion of the intellectual factors con- tributing to Wiener's turn to Jewish nationalism. These include his doctoral dissertation on J. G. Fichte, the impact on him of the widespread German volkish movement of the early twentieth century, and most important, his sense that having rejected halakhah as a binding factor, liberal Judaism was lost unless it affirmed Jewish peoplehood. One element of Schine's discussion is the influence on Wiener of Karl Barth's dialectical theology. Barth's revolution, repudiating conventional liberal Protestant categories, viewed Scripture as the word of God, not the product of human-created religions. Barth's categories gave Wiener a language to break with key aspects of liberal Jewish thought. Both Wiener and Barth departed from conventional confidence in the moral progress of humanity, both viewed the Bible as a document of revelation, and both discerned a chasm between the divine and the human. For Barth, the chasm was bridged by God's self-disclosure in the gospels. For Wiener, people mediates between God and the individual as the vehicle of revelation. Jewish nationality became, in Wiener's writings, a central and essential theological category. Schine writes, "Wiener appears here as the sole thinker in the Liberal rabbinate in Germany who uses theology not to argue against the centrality of Jewish nationality, but, on the contrary, to bring it into clear focus" (p. 108). Wiener developed a middle path between the liberal view of Judaism as mere confession and the secular Zionist view that religion was a cloak to be discarded. Schine's book is more than a biography; it is a careful depiction of subtle and important transitions in the ideas about Judaism held by German Christians and Jews. Schine's discussion of Wiener's turn to national ideas might be furthered through consideration of the post-World War I revival of Volksnomostheologie among German Protestants; did it influence Wiener, or does it simply represent a parallel phenomenon? The broader question of the Christian reception of Jewish writings in Germany also deserves study; how did Protestants respond to Wiener's writings? Although his summaries of Wiener's writings are occasionally too long, Schine has written a fascinating and important book.
