In this exciting book, Professor Moshe Halbertal of the Hebrew University and the Shalom Hartman Institute uncovers with brilliant conceptual clarity the re- ligious world of the philosophically inclined rabbinic scholars of southern France. With impressive erudition, Halbertal surveys most of the relevant thirteenth- and fourteenth-century primary source material, both in print and in manuscript, with an emphasis on the writing and thought of Menahem ha-Meiri of Perpignan (d. 1315). Meiri was the leading talmudist of a proud and self-consciously indepen- dent southern French Jewish community at the turn of the thirteenth century and the author of an encyclopedic commentary on the Talmud, Bet ha-Behirah. Hal- bertal argues that the history of medieval Jewish thought has been impoverished significantly on account of an inadequate appreciation of the impressive degree to which southern French talmudists, like Meiri, integrated philosophy and halakhah in their writing and thought. In this Halbertal is undoubtedly correct, and his book is therefore an unusually important contribution to Jewish intellectual history. (A conceptual core of Halbertal's work appeared as "R. Menahem ha-Me'iri: bein Torah le-Hokhmah," Tarbiz 63 (1995): 63-118, but issues and themes treated there are examined here with much greater scope and depth.) In brief introductory and concluding essays, Halbertal clearly frames his topic both conceptually and historically, and powerfully states the case for its im- 132</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews portance. His book contains six chapters that investigate the intersection of phi- losophy and law in rabbinic culture in southern France from a variety of angles. The first chapter establishes Meiri's commitments as a Maimonidean scholar, demonstrating that Meiri's views on a wide range of issues-including the role of intellectual comprehension, the nature of God, immortality, and prophecy, as well as Meiri's biblical exegesis and understanding of magic-are all thoroughly Maimonidean. The second chapter explores Meiri's relationship to the legacy of Samuel ibn Tibbon of Marseilles, the great philosophic translator and bible com- mentator who flourished in the first quarter of the thirteenth century, and whose work had become, in Meiri's day, emblematic of the southern French synthesis of philosophy and Jewish tradition. The third chapter is a major contribution to the understanding of Meiri's celebrated innovation that Christians being "bound by religion" are not to be considered idolaters but brothers. With penetrating learn- ing and insight, Halbertal eliminates the hypothesis that Meiri's categorization of Christians is apologetic in nature, clarifies the conceptual basis of Meiri's notion of "religion," and persuasively identifies the exegetical sources out of which Meiri fashioned this striking innovation. The fourth chapter gives the reader a sense of the character of the rationalistic commitments of southern French rabbinic schol- ars in the generations proceeding and following Meiri, and contains path-breaking work on the talmudist and polemicist Meir ben Simeon ha-Me'ili of Narbonne, and Meiri's teacher, Reuven ben .Hayyim. The fifth chapter presents the contro- versy over philosophic study that gripped Languedoc (1304-6) as an abrupt in- tensification of a decades-long conflict over the nature of the Maimonidean lega- cy that bifurcated the moderate rabbinic elite, with some moderates, like Meiri, moving to defend the radical philosopher translators, and others, like Abba Mari ben Moses of Montpellier, taking an active critical stand against them. The sixth chapter breaks new ground with a study of the work of David ben Samuel ha- Kokhavi, the author of Sefer ha-Batim and one of greatest Jewish legal scholars to follow Meiri in the southern French tradition. With impressive learning and sen- sitive reading, Halbertal shows how ha-Kokhavi dared to go further than any of his southern French predecessors in the philosophic spiritualization of halakhah. Driving much of Halbertal's analysis is a vision of the moderate and radi- cal interpretative streams of southern French Jewry as historical expressions of a profound duality immanent within Maimonidean thought. The validity of Hal- bertal's work therefore depends to a great extent on the validity of this vision. Halbertal argues, for example, that the southern French rabbinic elite adopted a moderate interpretation of the Maimonidean legacy, while the region's philoso- pher translators tended to read Maimonides along radical lines. However, a sig- nificant number of southern French philosopher translators, like Kalonymous ben Kalonymous, among others, were quite conservative in orientation, while sever- al southern French talmudists like David ben Samuel ha-Kokhavi stood just a hair's breadth from the most radical philosophic positions. Further, Halbertal de- scribes Meiri as a moderate Maimonidean "critic" engaged in a passionate "in- ternal" conflict with a radical philosophic wing. However, Meiri held the works of philosophers like Samuel ibn Tibbon and Jacob Anatoli as the very fonts of southern French Jewish culture and appears to have given them a rather moder- 133</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews ate interpretation. In a similar vein, Halbertal argues that were it not for the "pro- tection" bestowed upon the philosophically radical translators by a fundamental- ly opposed and potentially hostile moderate rabbinic elite, philosophic culture in southern France "would have collapsed" in the face of the "systematic" attacks against it. However, the closeness and mutual dependence that characterized the relationship between the philosophic translators and their rabbinic supporters from the earliest days of southern French Jewish philosophic culture render this presentation rather difficult. Finally, Halbertal presents the southern French con- flict over philosophic study as a virtual "hypostasis" of immanent Maimonidean dualities. However, it is unlikely that any living community ought be described in such reified terms, as if its culture were abstractly determined according to a par- ticular interpretation of Maimonides' challenging and multivalent literary corpus. Despite his extraordinary grasp of the relevant material, Halbertal draws the knot- ty complexities of thirteenth- and early-fourteenth-century southern French Jew- ish thought into a conceptually brilliant but historically inaccurate and untenable picture. Similarly, on the issue of the religious valuation of Talmud study, Halbertal casts the difference between Meiri and his southern French philosopher colleagues a bit too harshly. In Halbertal's intriguing presentation, Meiri's decision to write Bet ha-Behirah on the Talmud constituted a conscious and unequivocal repudia- tion of the southern French philosophers' desire to eliminate the Talmud, with its impractical dialectic, as a source for Jewish legal study. However, Meiri was as dis- dainfully adverse to impractical talmudic discourse as the exclusive philosopher, as his practically oriented encyclopedia of talmudic interpretation consistently ex- ecuted over such a vast terrain clearly shows. The philosopher translators, on the other hand, maintained a keen interest in the deeper meaning of rabbinic literature. They surely would have been fascinated, for example, by the allegorization of spe- cific halakhot by Meiri's younger contemporary ha-Kokhavi. Furthermore, scrip- tural exegesis was the philosophers' principal medium. They did not simply wish to move on to Averroes' commentaries on the works of Aristotle, as Halbertal im- plies. Conversely, powerful, creative talmudists took-and, today, still take-very little interest in Meiri's light and breezy discussions of the talmudic sugyah. The great Jewish legal minds of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, Ramban, Rash- ba, and Ritva, dealt extensively with the writing of the twelfth-century southern French talmudists Rabad and Zerahyah ha-Levi. They did not, however, cite the work of the succeeding generations of southern French talmudists, many of them rationalists, at all. Halbertal acknowledges that much of this southern French le- gal writing was simply not of the caliber necessary to engage the attention of the great Catalonian talmudists. Nevertheless, Halbertal suggests that these important Spanish talmudists consciously abandoned southern French halakhic writing on account of the rationalistic orientation of its authors: a fascinating but complete- ly unsubstantiated hypothesis. The utter lack of interest of the important Spanish talmudists in the vast halakhic literature of contemporary southern France, never- theless, remains intriguing. A notable gap in Halbertal's study is his cursory treatment of the Mezoqaq 134</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews Shivcatayyim, a massive talmudic work, comparable in scope to Bet ha-Behirah, by a late-fourteenth-century southern French scholar Joseph ben Saul. (Professor Israel Ta-Shma of the Hebrew University identified the unique manuscript of Mezoqaq Shivcatayyim a few years ago.) In his fourth chapter, Halbertal briefly es- tablishes the Maimonidean commitments of Joseph ben Saul, but concludes with the description of Mezoqaq Shiv'atayyim as "a work that has yet to be studied." Written in 1380, the existence of this major work renders problematic Halbertal's claim that the expulsion of the Jews of Languedoc in 1306 fundamentally under- mined their distinctive culture. The terminus ad quem of the southern French re- ligious and cultural life that Halbertal so marvelously brings to light therefore re- quires further clarification. Curiously, Halbertal suggests that Meiri and his teacher Reuven ben .Hayy- im, held "esoteric" views on a number of major issues, including the creation of the world. Indeed, a number of Meiri's formulations regarding such sensitive is- sues are extremely cautious and compressed, and Meiri can be caught contradict- ing himself on these same delicate topics. It seems most unlikely, however, that either Meiri or his teacher turned to modes of esotericism-deliberately contra- dicting themselves or elaborately concealing their true views, for example-as a strategies for scholarly communication. Perhaps Halbertal uses the term "esoteric" more loosely. In any case, this issue requires clarification. Finally, two relatively minor observations deserve mention: Halbertal puz- zlingly perpetuates the legend that Meiri's Bet ha-Behirah was "discovered entire- ly by accident in the nineteenth century in one complete manuscript after all traces of the work had vanished over the course of around five hundred years" (p. 17). The manuscript in question-which lacks Meiri's introduction and commentary to 'Avot and, hence, is not complete-was written in Avignon in the 1450s and iden- tified independently by the Hebrew bibliographers H. J. Azulai and G. B. De-Rossi not much later than 1750. Both scholars immediately recognized this manuscript's importance because of their acquaintance with Bet ha-Behirah from sources al- ready known to them. Lastly, Halbertal consistently uses the term "Provence" for the South of France. This designation for the region, while justifiable in a Hebrew- language work, probably should have been introduced with some qualification, as almost none of the places where the scholars treated in this book lived-Mont- pellier, Lunel, B6zier, Perpignan, and Narbonne, for example-are in Provence. Most are in Languedoc, while Perpignan, where Meiri himself lived, is in Rousil- lon. The absence of this clarification may confuse the general medievalist, who probably would experience uncertainty and perhaps even a sense of historical dis- location in attempting to place the Jewish community under discussion in its so- cial, political, and economic context.
