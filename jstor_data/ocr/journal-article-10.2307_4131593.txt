New York: Yeshiva University Press, 1999. xlix, 711 pp. For half a century the Buber-Scholem debate over the essence of Hasidic teachings and literature defined the parameters of scholarly discussion of Ha- sidism. A new generation of scholars has taken the discussion of Hasidism in new and fruitful directions in recent years. One result of this new research has been an interest in making the theological literature of Hasidism available to English readers. This volume is a welcome addition to this growing body of literature. Re- lying only on Hasidic stories instead of the theological writings of Hasidism, par- ticularly as they were selected and edited by Martin Buber, has led to a distorted and reductionist understanding of Hasidism and its place in the Jewish mystical tradition. The theologically and intellectually sophisticated aspects of Hasidism were not taken into account in popular descriptions of the movement. On the con- trary, Hasidism was seen as an anti-intellectual populist folk movement and even a break with the rabbinic tradition in some respects. Correcting this misconcep- tion and acquainting the reader with the intellectual and spiritual foundations of Hasidism is a primary goal for Norman Lamm, the editor of this volume. His second aim is to show the intellectual creativity and diversity of Hasidic thought. Though sharing common foundations, the Hasidic masters were often original and creative thinkers. Lamm concentrates on the teachings of the masters of the first three generations. The first generation of Hasidism was the Baal Shem Tov (Besht) and his contemporaries, such as R. Gershon of Kuty and R. Pinehas of Koretz, figures seen as colleagues of the Besht rather than as his disciples. The leading masters of the second generation were the Besht's immediate disciples, most notably R. Jacob Joseph of Pollnoye and R. Dov Baer, the Magid of Mezhi- 196</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews rech. The third generation were primarily the disciples of the Magid of Mezhirech. The leading figures of this generation include R. Shneur Zalman of Liadi, R. Levi Yizhak of Berdichev, R. Elimelech of Lyzhansk, and many others. R. Nahman of Bratzlav and R. Moshe Hayyim Ephraim of Sudilkov, though not disciples of the Magid of Mezhirech, were also considered to be in the third generation. Lamm has chosen to concentrate on these teachers for pragmatic reasons including the limi- tations of space, and not because, as has been argued in the past, Hasidic creativi- ty declined after this period. There were original and creative Hasidic thinkers throughout the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth century. Two later figures that Lamm quotes often are R. Elimelekh of Dinov and R. Zadok ha- Cohen of Lublin. Their inclusion is a personal preference, their teachings having a particular interest for Lamm. The writings of the Hasidic masters are not systematic theological treatises, but collections of sermons delivered on sabbaths and festivals. The notable excep- tion is R. Shneur Zalman of Liadi's LikkuteiAmarim (Tanya). Lamm has culled the theological "nuggets" from the more extensive sermons in which they are embed- ded. His selections are well chosen and convey not only the ideas but also the style and methodology of Hasidic writings to the nonspecialist. The book is organized thematically rather than by individuals. In that way it is easier to see how different Hasidic masters have approached basic theological concepts. The teachings are divided into eighteen chapters. They include basic the- ological concepts such as God and Providence, the Soul, Faith, Torah Study, Love and Fear, Prayer, Evil and Suffering, Life and Death, Exile and Redemption and others. Other topics more specific to the kabbalistic and Hasidic traditions, such as Devekut, the Zaddik, Worship through Corporeality, Joy and Dejection, and Smallness and Greatness, are also considered. The last chapter is on women in Ha- sidic thought. Each chapter begins with an introduction that puts the topic of the chapter into the larger context of Jewish thought. This is followed by a selection of excerpts from a variety of Hasidic masters. The source of each extract is noted and the pas- sage is carefully annotated, making it more accessible to the general reader. The number of selections in each chapter varies from under ten to more than forty. Not surprisingly, the chapter on the Zaddik has the largest number of excerpts, forty- three. This volume is the most comprehensive anthology of Hasidic theological teachings in English to date. It is a most welcome addition to the literature on Ha- sidism in English and is an excellent introduction to the theology of Hasidism. It can be highly recommended as an entry to the riches of Hasidism for the nonspe- cialist and would make an excellent text for a course on the teachings of Hasidism. Morris M.
