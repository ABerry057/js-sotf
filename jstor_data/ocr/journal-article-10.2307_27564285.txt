Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 2002. xii, 473 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000475 No one has documented the powerful and lasting shift in modem Jewish thought that moves from the nineteenth-century question of why a modem person should remain Jewish to the postmodem question of how a Jewish person could ever become modem. But as this retrospective collection of twenty-seven groundbreaking statements and occasional applications shows, Eugene B. Borowitz has embraced, perhaps more than anyone, the paradoxical moment of this shift in one distinguished scholarly career. Though one could hardly sum up an eminent and prolific career in a title, Studies in the Meaning of Judaism nicely relates the central dilemma that Borowitz faces. Once upon a time, liberal thinking tried to ascribe meaning to Judaism in order to make its modem survival worthwhile. Borowitz, however, assumes that its adherents already find Judaism worth their while, and his work could but give a fuller 216</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews articulation to the inchoate meanings that come from their participation in it. With no "faith more basic" than Judaism, this "primacy" offers Borowitz a new liberal way to discover what "his Judaism" means (78-84). In this bold move, Borowitz can rightly be said to have turned modem liberal Jewish thought on its head (240, 409). Of great interest to advanced students of modem Judaism, Jews in America, and Jewish thought and philosophy, this volume richly illustrates the changes that liberal Jewish thought has recently undergone: Notice that the essay culminating these fifty years of thinking about liberal Jewish religion is on " Halakhah" \ In this volume, Borowitz reverses some of his previous liberal priorities: His practice would motivate an exposition of faith rather than having his faith seek Enlightenment (see Chap. 6, 10, 19); his particularity would precede uni versality, viewed now as a messianic and not an exclusively human achievement (Chap. 14, 16, 23); his tradition would supply the content of values that auton omous reason could restrain from excessive parochialism (Chap. 11, 27). The reversals effectively come in three phases, as the book's chronological organiz ation suggests. First, Borowitz dismisses rationalism as the standard of religious authority; he proffers instead an existentialist treatment of the self in its relation to God's commanding presence. An insightful 1961 essay on "Crisis Theology and the Jewish Community" initially sketches the agenda of a "Covenant Theol ogy" that would come to fruition decades later. Second, Borowitz shifts away from an individualist account of divine-human relations to a collective one (he calls it "holism") in which the people of Israel register God's historic appearances. Already in 1970, he was addressing "The Postsecular Situation of Jewish Theology." Furthermore, upon publishing his opus, Liberal Judaism, Borowitz's 1984 article on "The Autonomous Jewish Self promoted "Jewish law as the single best source of guidance as to how [an individual Jew] ought to live" though granting "the duty to God," understood ethically, the utmost importance in the event of conflicting "Covenant obligations" (224, 231). Finally, Borowitz reverses the ideological purity of his liberalism, addres sing a cacophony of voices that have recently come to define Judaism, including those opposed to his own. To be sure, Borowitz has consistently criticized political conservatism and "the new Jewish right" (Chap. 5, 13, 20). And yet, as early as 1950, he was urging that Reform Jewish theological method begin with premodem tradition (15). More lately counting himself a "Progressive" among religious but "non-Orthodox Jews," Borowitz deems "a Jew's continuing personal appropria tion of the people of Israel's Covenant with God" no less authentic should it fail "to utilize its classic, halakhic forms," even if Borowitz himself would opt for them as much as possible (324). Borowitz takes increasingly dialectical tacks between autonomy and tradition. He challenges Orthodox Judaism to weigh the universal morality in the halakhic category of hillul has hem, which seems "to prohibit Jewish acts toward gentiles" that, although legally "permiss ible," would nonetheless cause moral offense (244). He challenges secular human ism to accept the limitations of the scientific "certainty paradigm," which no longer withstands ethical scrutiny, and to admit into their moral decisions "the 217</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews fragments of various broken systems," including the "mysterious, nonempirical" ways in which God works through Jewish observance (345-48). Aptly reprinted here is Borowitz's chapter '"im ba'it 'ayma'" in which he responds to the loving criticisms put to his mature system Renewing the Covenant (1991) by well-known scholars of modem Jewish thought and collected in book form {Reviewing the Covenant, ed. Peter Ochs). Showing how far liberalism has come, Chapter 27 analyzes the telling transition in the Reform Jewish use of halakhah from "guidance, not governance" to something much different. But could this motto be overturned and still remain liberal? The ques tion remains whether one could begin to gather any reasonable meanings within Judaism without always being committed to the authoritative meaning one already ascribes to it. Because "authenticity" marks purity and perfection, not pluralism or fragmentation, even many non-Orthodox?let alone Orthodox?Jews have little problem making an a priori commitment to a core essence of Judaism. An elegant autobiographical reflection points toward the next phase of Borowitz's career: a study of the classical Aggadah (Chap. 26). Because this step is needed to build from that liberalism whose priorities Borowitz has reversed, the case for a progressive Jewish thinking may yet face its greatest test. Thanks to Borowitz's fluid prose and passionate engagement, we can better understand why. Gregory Kaplan Rice University Houston, Texas</page></plain_text>
