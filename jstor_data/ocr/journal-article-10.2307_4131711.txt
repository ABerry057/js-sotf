<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ruth Langer. To Worship God Properly: Tensions Between Liturgical Custom and Halakhah in Judaism. Monographs of the Hebrew Union College. Cincinnati: HUC Press, 1998. xiii, 287 pp. Ruth Langer's meticulously researched volume fills a gap in the study of Jewish liturgy. While many histories of the liturgy focus on the origins, use of lan- guage, and literary aspects of the texts, Langer's study provides an analysis of some of the dynamics that shaped the halakhot dealing with prayer, thus impacting di- rectly upon the spiritual life of Jews. How did the legal system that discussed is- sues regarding the liturgy develop? What questions were asked, and around which factors did disputes come about? What concepts and practices contributed to the resolution of differences? As Langer notes in her preface, a significant force in the formation of rabbinic prayer and the legal system undergirding it was the princi- ple of worship as an evolving phenomenon. Once prayer is understood as both a communal and an individual response to God's covenant with Israel, the intrica- cies of the liturgical system must be developed and justified. They must express the history of the community as well as the existential needs of the person of faith. The struggle to define proper worship is shown to take place primarily in the shifting authority of minhag, the customs of the people, and halakhah, legal theory. Indeed, while Langer's volume is primarily a study of various cases in the develop- ment of an established corpus of tefilah, its underlying methodological principle is that the borders of minhag and halakhah constantly impinge upon one another, call- ing for frequent readjustment of both legal pronouncement and actual practice. The demonstration of the porous quality of these boundaries leads to an understanding of the tradition as responsive to social change and historical circumstances. In the first chapter, Langer sets out the parameters of her study. This chap- ter analyzes the development of what she calls the "liturgical law," which replaced the sacrificial system in the periods of the tannaim and amoraim. The principles thus formulated establish an authoritative guide for later generations; all subse- quent adaptations, interpretations, and alterations are viewed in the context of clearly articulated talmudic concepts. While most derive from the Babylonian Tal- 368</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews mud, the Palestinian traditions are shown to have an important influence in regard to some issues. The authors of the Talmud collect and promulgate laws that estab- lish and order the nature of communal prayer, laws that provide a framework and structure necessary for the composition of prayers, and laws that define the prac- tical application of these various rules. A central concern in their formulations is the efficacy of prayer, both for the person and for the prayer-community. Having laid the groundwork in terms of halakhah and talmudic principles, Langer's sub- sequent chapters focus upon specific halakhic issues regarding prayer and explore their interaction with surrounding non-Jewish cultures and their influence, evolv- ing Jewish customs, and adaptations of the understanding of efficacy. The me- dieval world inherited structures of prayer defined by the sages and protected by the fences of halakhah. The continuing development of the tradition, however, de- pended upon its inner flexibility and its capacity to maintain scholarly dialogue about the interactions necessitated by historical circumstance. Thus the analysis in Chapter Two, "The Halakhic Status of Non-Talmudic Benedictions," specifically deals with birkat bitulim and the priest's blessing at the redemption of the firstborn son, while Chapter Three focuses upon "The Language of Prayer: The Challenge of Piyyut." The emphasis changes in Chapter Four, "In- dividual Recitation of the Kedushah: The Impact of Mysticism on Minhag and Ha- lakhah." Each discussion begins with a survey of the relevant geonic texts, mov- ing on to Masekhet Soferim, debate among Jews in Muslim and Christian Spain, rishonim and aharonim. A full complement of sources is brought in each case to demonstrate not only how Jewish communities struggled with specific issues regarding prayer, but also-and perhaps especially-how culture, minhag, and talmudic dictum were distinct but interwoven variables in determining interpretations of halakhah in re- gard to the liturgy. What is of particular interest in the detailed analyses of various sources is their application to contemporary pesaq. Thus, toward the end of the chapter on the halakhic status of non-talmudic benedictions, Langer refers to the pesaq of R. Ovadiah Yosef, who maintains that women may not use a full liturgi- cal blessing when reciting she-'asani kirsono, as does also Barukh Halevi Epstein. The latter opines that even though it appears in some siddurim, the current custom is not to recite it at all and it should be deleted from the text. However, the bless- ing does appear in full in almost every Orthodox Ashkenazi siddur, and there has been no further discussion of its omission in contemporary commentaries on the traditional siddur. Only the most recent Sefardi siddurim, printed in Israel, make use of R. Ovadiah's ruling. Langer's conclusion in this chapter, that in the case of non-talmudic blessings, "minhag rarely overruled halakhah," yet "only rarely were strong stances taken against active customs based on the theoretical authority of the Talmud" (p. 107), still holds. Rabbis devise new interpretations of either the minhag or the halakhah, stretching the boundaries of the theoretical legal basis or giving new meaning to the minhag. In this way conflict is avoided. Langer con- vincingly demonstrates that, as customs weakened because of migrations and up- heavals, the Talmud came to be regarded as the "timeless, absolute, operative au- thority by which to judge the efficacy of liturgical customs" (p. 109). Hence, the issue of the legitimacy of non-talmudic blessings remained potent. 369</page><page sequence="3">AJS Review The concluding chapter, which examines the halakhic debate over the ap- propriate setting for the recitation of the various kedushah prayers, continues the analysis of the forces which shaped-and are still shaping-liturgical law. The dis- cussion focuses on kedushah deyoser and kedushah desidra, tracing the issues from Mishnah Megillah 4:3 through Masekhet Soferim to Joseph Karo and others. Langer quotes a gloss on the text of the late ninth-century sage Rav Nahshon Gaon, found in a Vatican manuscript of Halakhot Gedolot. This detail demonstrates the precise and attentive scholarship, expressed in a smoothly written narrative, that characterizes this volume. For those interested in the development of halakhah and analyses of specific liturgical texts, this is a book worth reading. Rochelle Millen Wittenberg University Springfield, Ohio</page></plain_text>
