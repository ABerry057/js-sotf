<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jason P. Rosenblatt. Torah and Law in "Paradise Lost. " Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994. xi, 274 pp. The renewal of interest in the literary aspects of the Hebrew scriptures and their rabbinic interpretations, spurred on by such work as Robert Alter's The Art of Biblical Narrative (Basic Books, 1981) and Sanford Budick and Geoffrey Hartmann's Midrash and Literature (Yale, 1986), has influenced a subsequent generation of scholarship that examines the characteristically Hebraic traits of various literary works. The marked philo-Hebraism of Milton's political prose and epic poetry, which received short shrift at the hands of such unsympathetic eminent Miltonists as A. S. P. Woodhouse, Ernest Sirluck, and Arthur Barker, has thereby recently regained some of the attention it deserves from such critics as Regina Schwartz, in Remembering and Repeating: Biblical Creation in Paradise Lost (Cambridge, 1988). In Torah and Law in "Paradise Lost", Jason Roseqblatt joins this line of inquiry, locating within Paradise Lost two conceptions of law, one based on Torah, from the Hebrew Bible, also manifest in Milton's prose tracts of 1643-45, and the other expounded in the Pauline epistles. In describing "Milton's positive portrayal of Edenic-Mosaic law in books 5 to 8 of Paradise Lost" (pp. 17-18), books that "present the Hebrew Bible and Adam and Eve as self-sufficient entities" (p. 3), Rosenblatt argues that Milton describes prelapsarian Eden as defined by and subject to Mosaic law, which "governs life before the Fall, then yields to the gospel in the fallen world" (p. 46). Rosenblatt makes a good case for Milton's twofold indebtedness to the Hebrew Bible: to the concepts of law that influence his prose tracts, and to Hebraic models for some of his characters in Paradise Lost. In chapter 2,</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 175 this indebtedness reveals itself in Milton's use of the works of John Selden, the philo-Hebraic Christian commentator, whose treatises De Jure Naturale (1640) and Uxor Hebraica (publ. 1646) provided the rabbinic foundation for Milton's Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce (1643) (pp. 94-103). Chapter 3 traces Milton's representation of his role as prophet-legislator to its Mosaic antetypes, and chapter 4 briefly treats the resemblance of Raphael's account of creation to biblical commentary. Beyond the Hebraic lineage of these works, however, lies the murkier issue of the extent to which Milton's philo-Hebraic aesthetic does or does not indicate a philo-Hebraic ethos. As Rosenblatt notes, while Milton's indebted- ness to various elements of Hebrew scripture has long been acknowledged, albeit often grudgingly, the importance of the indebtedness has generally been minimized. Rosenblatt's own account of both the sources of Milton's Hebraism and its particular manifestations is helpful and much more persua- sive than his account of its precise structural function in Paradise Lost or in Milton's thought in general. In part, this difficulty stems from the ambiguity of the term "philo-Hebraic." Philo-Hebraism can mean sympathy and respect for rabbinic interpretive principles, such as the "unusually generous conception of Judaism" John Selden evinced in his treatises (p. 83); and when Rosenblatt means this, his argument is persuasive. But when Rosenblatt argues that "Milton regards the Hebrew Bible as Torah in the 1643-45 prose tracts" (p. ix), he is on shakier ground. In The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce, Milton certainly used concepts and laws presented in the Hebrew scriptures, but part of his goal was to show how those concepts were consistent with principles of Christian charity. The concepts and laws are authoritative, Milton believed, but for him one vital measure of their authority was accordance with the laws of Christianity. This point of view gives the Hebrew Bible considerable authority, but without granting it the independence from Christianity implied in the term Torah. In a similar vein, Rosenblatt contrasts a philo-Hebraic treatment of the law with the postlapsarian books of Paradise Lost and claims that Milton "tries to prevent the reader from confusing Hebraic prelapsarian and Christian postlapsarian life" (p. 3). Rosenblatt argues that Milton's conception of postlapsarian life is necessarily Christian, and so it is in the sense of being retrospectively understood within a Christian eschatology. But Milton's conception of prelapsarian life was not Hebraic in the sense of being defined by and subject to Mosaic law. Rather, Milton depicts prelapsarian life in Paradise Lost as pre-Christian but also pre-Mosaic, or pre-Hebraic. Milton's</page><page sequence="3">176 BOOK REVIEWS point was indeed that Adam and Eve are self-sufficient entities before they fall, as Rosenblatt argues, but because of their obedience to a single command apart from external Scripture or commentators of any sort. Rosenblatt concludes with the following formulation of humankind's fall: "Milton's Adam falls from nature, history, and Torah as understood by the Hebrew Bible into the gospel's abrogation of the world, of temporality, and of the law as understood by typology," which he calls "the tragedy of Torah degraded into law" (p. 234). For Milton, however, the tragedy is broader still, for the Hebrew Bible he admired and its interpreters whom he respected would also be bound by that fallen world. Anne K.
