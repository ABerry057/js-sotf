Supplements to Vetus Testamentum, vol. 42. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1991. 186 pp. Many biblical scholars would agree that a central, if not the central, problem of Kings is how and when the book was redacted. The answer offered to that question has serious ramifications; it determines, for example, the suitability of Kings as a source for reconstructing the history of ancient Judah and Israel, and affects our understanding of the development of key institutions, such as the monarchy and prophecy. It should not, then, be surprising that the questions surrounding the composition of Kings have been responsible for the production of scores of monographs and articles during the last half-century. McKenzie's The Trouble with Kings, one recent attempt to unknot these problems, begins by summarizing the major positions on the issue.' Its five central chapters are studies of units, or topoi, that have been particularly associated with the dating of Kings: the Greek material lacking in the Masoretic text concerning Jeroboam (3 Reigns 12:24A-Z), the Jeroboam cycle (1 Kings 11-14), the oracles predicting the downfall of the royal house, the prophetic material, especially that concerning Elijah and Elisha, and the history of the reigns of Hezekiah and Josiah. The analysis of these key texts supports two chapters of conclusions; the first suggests that Kings probably originated in the reign of Josiah, and the second observes that the additions to this version were accomplished through gradual supplementation rather than through consistent reediting. McKenzie's interest, as he candidly admits, is not in breaking new ground or in discovering a novel answer to a vexed problem, but in judiciously evaluating the wide range of previous proposals. As such, he often does not try to reach a definitive conclusion of particular issues. For example, he notes, "Given the history of the scholarly debate, it would be foolish and arrogant to presume that this chapter ["A Time for Everything: Dating the Deuteronomistic History"] should resolve the issue once and for all" (p. 117). This is an unusual, welcome tone within biblical scholarship. McKenzie's general conclusion, offered in this appropriately tentative form, is a generally well argued and acceptable modification of the views of 1. A more recent treatment which is quite different in its approach and conclusions is Baruch Halpern and David S. Vanderhooft, "The Editions of Kings in the 7th-6th Centuries B.C.E.," Hebrew Union College Annual 62 (1991): 179-244.</page><page sequence="2">162 BOOK REVIEWS Martin Noth, whose work has enjoyed a recent revival.2 Yet, upon completing this book, I feel that certain points which should stand at the very foundation of McKenzie's arguments are never fully developed or articulated. Principal among these is: What are the valid criteria for determining multiplicity of authorship or for deciding that a particular text must have been written in the exilic period? McKenzie certainly touches on these issues in various places throughout the book, but does not, in contrast to R. D. Nelson's book on a similar topic,3 offer a central, expanded discussion of them. This discussion is especially necessary because McKenzie, following Burke O. Long, feels that there are fundamental discontinuities between ancient and modem notions of compatibility and editing, so that our understanding of the redaction of Kings should be based on a careful examination of edited texts from Mesopotamia and Greece, which offer a relatively clear picture of redaction.4 Based on this comparative material, what are valid criteria for deciding that a text has gone through multiple recensions or for isolating the particular verses that must be part of the same recension? How much variation in language, style, or ideology may a single ancient author use? Only once these issues are explored in depth is it possible to begin to dissect Kings. Some of McKenzie's conclusions are not entirely satisfactory precisely because he has not given enough attention to the fundamental issues un- derlying his arguments. For example, his claim in chapter 4, "Prophets Come Lately: Prophetic Additions to the Book of Kings" (pp. 81-100), that most of the Elijah-Elisha material is a post-deuteronomistic insertion into Kings, is intriguing, but not fully convincing. I grant him that the material disagrees with some of the fundaments of deuteronomistic ideology con- cerning centralization, but is it still impossible that a deuteronomistic editor might have incorporated it into his work? Phrased differently, did ancient authors ever incorporate sources which they disagreed with? Chronicles, for example, is not fully consistent in its use of source material, leading to various contradictions.5 Furthermore, McKenzie does not address the central issue of 2.

Additionally, once the book of Kings was formed, would it have been open to such an extensive addition at its very center, in contrast, for example, to the much shorter appendix at the end of Samuel? Finally, what weight should be given to various types of linguistic arguments for the dating of biblical material?6 I cannot answer most of these questions, and I do not raise them to suggest that McKenzie must be wrong, and that this prophetic material was used by the deuteronomistic editor of Kings. I do, however, mean to highlight that it is time to reflect on more fundamental issues concerning the composition and editing of texts before we continue to write additional monographs on the editing of particular biblical books. In sum, this is a clear book, which offers useful, judicious comments on passages in Kings which are central to the multiple-redaction debate. Yet, it has not offered a fundamentally new approach or answer to that problem, nor has it really broken new ground by exploring the issues that must be examined before we may discuss productively the redaction of Kings, or of any biblical book. To phrase the issue differently, the real "trouble with Kings" is that we have not yet expended the needed effort to systematically examine the criteria used for the source-critical separation and dating of biblical texts. Once this is accomplished, we will be well on our way to sorting out McKenzie's "trouble," namely, the history of the composition of the text.
