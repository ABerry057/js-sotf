<plain_text><page sequence="1">David Hartman. A Living Covenant. New York: Free Press, 1985. xi + 340 PP. When David Hartman published his Maimonides: Torah and Philosophic Quest, I reviewed it, commenting that it was not so much a study in medie- val theology as an essay in contemporary Orthodoxy (Religious Studies Review 5 [1979]:107-111). With his new book, A Living Covenant, Hartman has turned directly to the theme of modern theology. One may agree or dis- agree with his main theses, but one cannot contest that this is an important book in the articulation of contemporary Orthodox religious thought. Inter- estingly, his discussion with Maimonides in this book is a serious theological engagement (chapter 10 and particularly the Postscript, where Hartman lists his differences with the Rambam).' 1. In my review, I also criticized Hartman's evaluation of the mystical dimension in Mai- monides. On page 120, with note 8, he acknowledges insufficient attention on his part to the "meta-halakhic experience" in Maimonides. He goes on to show that the halakhic-social- covenantal dimension of Judaism is basically the anthropocentric motif, while the con- templative-universal dimension is the theocentric motif. (This reappears in the two sources of love [pp. 266-267].) According to Hartman, Maimonides proposes that these motifs be held in tension, alternately in the mind. I think Hartman is correct about using these motifs seriatim, i.e., alternately. However, I do not think that is what Maimonides had in mind. In the Guide for the Perplexed (III:51), Maimonides uses the models of "I sleep but my heart waketh" and Abraham to indicate that, at its highest level, these motifs are held simultaneously, in double consciousness.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 299 Hartman's "covenantal anthropology" revolves around three foci. The first is the model of mature love (pp. 272-275). Early love has about it a quality of mystic union, a feeling that through love one has become whole and redeemed .... However, when the struggles of the real world impinge upon the consciousness of young lovers..,. they learn that neither partner in the relationship can redeem the other .... A mature rela- tionship is based upon respect for human frailty and weakness. The partners in such a relationship have been eased of any burden of guilt for not having redeemed their beloved from human failings.... they have no need to reject or be angry at their beloved because of the persistence of his or her "unredeemed- ness."... Mature lovers no longer fear they will be condemned or rejected because of failure or mistakes. This understanding of human relatedness serves as Hartman's model for his understanding of the covenant between God and the Jews. The desert, bare of the veneers of civilization, exposes human weakness and elemental hungers, fears, and terrors. .. . It teaches the community that it need not live with the terror that God will abandon it if it fails to maintain the elaborate norms of the mitzvot .. . The belief that God will not abandon Israel-which reflects His acceptance of human finitude and limitations [p. 262]... The memory of renewed acceptance after the tablets had been broken, represented by Moses' second ascent of Sinai and encounter with God, is an assurance of God's ever-renewed love [p. 274]. The first focus, then, of Hartman's covenantal anthropology is mature love-between man and woman, and between God and the Jews. The second focus begins with Hartman's observation that Judaism does not permit a consistent single-dimensional theology. Rabbinic Judaism forswore systematic theology, not because the rabbis could not think in a coherent philosophical way, but because systematic theology could not do jus- tice to the vitality and complexity of experience [p. 199] .... multiple theologi- cal models... [p. 200]. This observation allows Hartman to acknowledge that there are multiple understandings, within rabbinic Judaism, of humankind's direct relation- ship to God (chap. 2), of suffering (chap. 8), and even of covenant (chap. 10).</page><page sequence="3">300 BOOK REVIEWS This many-branched theology, in turn, allows Hartman to choose for himself the one he finds most compatible with his covenantal anthro- pology. He indicates quite clearly his conscious choice of the mature love model. ... I find that it [the covenant] is less well expressed by the metaphor of kingship than by another biblical metaphor: that of husband and wife [p. 5]. . . Selection and emphasis remain the responsibility of the reader [p. 60]. ... I prefer to see God's will for Jewish history, just like God's will for Jewish com- munal life, as channeled exclusively through the efforts of the Jewish com- munity to achieve the aims of Torah given at Sinai [p. 232]. ... For me, God's love is mediated not through a promise of eschatological redemption, but through the constant and ever-renewed covenantal mitzvah, which calls one to full responsibility. [p. 265]. The second focus of Hartman's covenantal anthropology, then, is his theological multi-dimensionalism coupled with his choice of the mature love covenantal model. The third focus is Hartman's intelligent and courageous critique of his teacher, Soloveitchik, and of Leibowitz (chaps. 3-6). Hartman says yes to Soloveitchik's assertion of the autonomy of the interpreter within the authority of the tradition but sounds a resounding no to Soloveitchik's anthropology of alienation, which is rooted in terror and resolvable only in catharsis and a concept of prayer as self-denial. Similarly, Hartman says yes to Leibowitz's theocentrism but sounds a resounding no to its being cut off from the social context of mitzvot and from intellectuality. Using these three foci, Hartman is able to develop a covenantal theol- ogy that asserts the primacy of Sinai, Torah, and mitzvot over against the mystical and the eschatological motifs of Judaism. It is a theology rooted in responsible relatedness in which our finitude is appreciated for its own intrinsic value. This view will- ingly accepts the permanent difference between us creatures and our Creator. ... Belief in the immortality of the soul or the physical resurrection of the dead, and the mystical longing to be absorbed in eternity are therefore not essential for us to stand as dignified finite creatures before our Creator [p. 259] .... a yearning to get beyond finitude and inhabit eternity is a violation of the dignity of human freedom and responsibility found in the covenantal concern for history [p. 261].</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 301 Thus, for example, petitional prayer is not an act of submission, a cast- ing of oneself on God's grace, but a demand of rights, or an intelligent requesting of needs. Prayer may embody not only humility and awe, but also an assertion of rights conferred by God upon human beings through the covenant and through the Torah. Prayer may become non-apologetic, even aggressive and defiant [p. 53] .... In prayer Jews are not restricted to God's love; they can make demands upon their Beloved. Covenantal mutuality implies that God is com- mitted to taking seriously the requests and recommendations of His covenan- tal partner [p. 55].... "To pray means to discriminate, to evaluate, to under- stand, in other words, to ask intelligently" [p. 139, citing Soloveitchik].2 Thus, too, study is not a blind transmission of tradition but an active intellectual pursuit, indeed a challenge, of that which is received, although always within the framework of general acceptance. The Talmud contains a strange and fascinating paradox. On the one hand, there is unconditional acceptance of revelation. .. . On the other hand, it is clear to anyone familiar with the Talmud that rabbinic teachers exhibit enor- mous interpretive freedom and mastery over the revealed text [p. 37]. .. . Nor should the halakhic Jew's legislative and interpretive independence be iden- tified with Kantian autonomy .... The autonomy of rabbinic Judaism was expressed within a framework of divine authority rooted in the revelation at Sinai [p. 40]. Thus, too, the motive behind theodicy is not an irrational clinging to some abstract doctrine but a product of the interpersonal interaction between God and the Jews. Others may tolerate repeated frustrations in their relationship and may remain together for a whole lifetime on the strength of a memory of the passionate love felt at the beginning of their marriage. Although those earlier moments are only a memory, the two of them nevertheless live together in the hope of 2. This is best illustrated in the shocking midrash on Exod. 32:10: "'Now therefore let Me alone, that My wrath may grow hot against them...' Rabbi Abbahu said, '... This teaches that Moses took hold of the Holy One, blessed be He, like a man who seizes his fellow by the garment...'" (p. 54).</page><page sequence="5">302 BOOK REVIEWS somehow renewing the tenderness they once felt in their relationship. It is in such terms that one must seek to understand the Jewish people's long romance with God. .. . The Jews had tasted deep love and hoped to taste it again. They continued to feel the manifestations of that love in their daily life of mitzvah and on their great festive occasions, even though that love failed to shield them from historical realities [p. 201] .... it should not be imagined that even the Holocaust could destroy it [p. 203]. Thus, too, eschatology does not mean the supernatural intervention in history by God but the slow development of the covenantal relationship between humankind and God. The centrality of the land in Judaism teaches us that mitzvah must not remain an aspiration, a utopian hope to be realized in messianic conditions of history, but must be tested and concretized within the normal, everyday conditions of human existence [p. 283]. .. . the vitality of Judaism does not depend on the belief in the messianic resolution of history [p. 287].3 I have taken so much space to state and illustrate Hartman's thesis because I think it is a major proposal-theologically, halakhically, and poli- tically. There are, however, several questions that need to be raised. I am in sympathy with Hartman on many points: his theological multi- dimensionalism; his rooting of Jewish theology in the psychology of human relations; his realization that Jewish national, as well as Jewish personal and communal, existence is at stake; his avoidance of metaphysics in favor of philosophic anthropology;4 his rejection of the halakhic ghetto and his embracing of modernity; and his sober, concrete understanding of our rela- tionship to God. I also agree with Hartman's rejection of the anthropology of alienation, the theology of extreme theocentrism, and the imminent mes- sianism (almost apocalypticism) which is popular in certain Zionist circles. "Finding the courage to live with God without expecting God to transform one's world"-personally and nationally (as did Nehemiah and Ezra)-is, 3. Three other ideas deserve special note: first, that the ethical defines the halakhic (pp. 99-100); second, that the uniqueness of the Jewish people is normative, not ontological (p. 105); and third, that the relational intimacy of prayer grows out of the normative life of Judaism, not out of the mystical, the ecstatic, or the prophetic (p. 149). This is a very rich book. 4. Hartman's book was reviewed at length by D. Landes in Tikkun 1, no. 2 (1987): 106-111. Hartman replied and Landes had a last word in Tikkun 2, no. 1 (1987): 121-126. For Hartman on anthropology and not metaphysics, cf. ibid., p. 124.</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 303 indeed, not easy and simple,5 and Hartman is to be commended for his honesty and courage. Finally, I appreciate Hartman's learnedness, his passion, his engaging serious contemporary Jewish figures in dialogue, and his use of distinctively Jewish theological categories such as covenant, messiah, halakhah, prayer, etc. His sections on petitional prayer (pp. 53-57, 149), suffering (chap. 8), covenantal and contemplative love (pp. 266-267), theocentrism and anthropocentrism (pp. 129-130), life in the State of Israel (chap. 12), and rabbinic messianism (pp. 257-262, chap. 12) are all very good. As a student of Maimonides, I also find the variations in the exegesis of Maimonides among his sources and himself fascinating. What bothers me most about Hartman's theology is its optimism about the human condition. In Hartman's world, lovers mature, evil is confronted and dealt with, sin is managed by an intelligent application of the halakhah, terror is domesticated, despair is banished, and so on. Real sin, however, is a compulsion so strong that, in some cases, it cannot be broken. Real evil is so terrifying that, in some cases, it completely paralyzes the moral and physical will. Of course, Jewish tradition teaches that teshuvah and not sin is abso- lute, but in practice it is not so simple. Hartman's view takes the dark side of human nature and human history too lightly. Soloveitchik is haunted by that side, perhaps Leibowitz is too, but Hartman's underestimation of the power of sin and evil is very precarious theology. Hartman seems to recognize the dark side of religious life when he sets forth his typology of terror-submission vs. adequacy-dignity in chapter 2. However, he rejects the former and joyfully asserts the latter. I do not dis- agree. Rabbinic Judaism, especially in its more sober side, does favor the adequacy-dignity typology. I think, however, that terror and submission are also integral parts of the rabbinic personality. There are, indeed, moments when all we can do is cast ourselves on God's mercy because we are so steeped in our own sinfulness that we can effect no other way. There are, indeed, moments when the horror of direct evil is so great that we can only cringe in terror. In such moments of deep sin or profound terror, we can only implore God's grace, His un-covenanted love. God has a love which is beyond covenant, beyond what we can legitimately expect of Him on the basis of our merits and His recognition of our finitude. And it is this love, as 5. Ibid., p. 123.</page><page sequence="7">304 BOOK REVIEWS much as His covenanted, rational, reliable love, which sustains us. One might even argue that, in moments of deep sin or profound evil, it is precise- ly this.unmerited love that sustains us most.6 To this, Hartman can and should argue that, while the terror- submission mode of relating to God is present, rabbinic tradition teaches that it ought not to be dominant. He would be correct in so claiming. But, in the dynamics of living with God, we must be able to experience both the terror and the submission of life beyond the covenant as well as the power, adequacy, and dignity of life within the covenant. If we recognize both types of relatedness, we will not need to read God out of an active role in history, as Hartman does. Nor will we have to come as close as he does to denying supernaturalism. For, in a certain sense, God's un-covenanted love is the motive for His creation, His revelation, His choosing of the Jewish people,7 and His intervention (and perhaps nonintervention) in history. The covenant gives us the ground on which to stand before God. It gives us the confidence to face God's might. But it does not allow us to "not be intimidated by God's power" (p. 303). It does not free us from the perils and grace of the desert (p. 284). Two other problems trouble me: First, Hartman's definition of mature love, which is the linchpin of his theology, seems a little naive. Do lovers ever reach the point where any sin can be absorbed without the fear of rejec- tion? Hartman indicates this is so; I rather doubt it myself. Do lovers ever give up the hope that the other can redeem one? Hartman indicates this is so, but, as life's problems get more serious and as one's ability to deal with them diminishes, I think we cling more, not less, to the (false) hope of a redemptive moment. Similarly, in theology, God's decision never to divorce us-and Hartman is correct that His taking back of the Jewish people after the sin of the golden calf is the paradigm for this decision-is precisely unreal, unhuman. It is not motivated by the promise of our future behavior. Hence, God's decision not to abandon us is not covenantal, but trans- 6. Cf. D. Blumenthal, "Mercy," in Contemporary Jewish Religious Thought, ed. A. Cohen and P. Mendes-Flohr (New York: Scribner's, 1987), pp. 589-596. 7. I agree with Landes (Tikkun 1, p. 111) that Hartman does not deal adequately with chosenness. Cf., however, M. Wyshogrod, The Body of Faith: Judaism as Corporeal Election (New York: Seabury Press, 1983), reviewed by me in AJS Review 11, no. 1 (Spring 1986): 116-121.</page><page sequence="8">BOOK REVIEWS 305 covenantal. His promise of redemption too is, in some understandings of biblical and rabbinic thought, not a result of our behavior, not a fulfillment of the covenant, but a reaching out beyond the agreed-upon into the un- expected. Mature love is one model, a good one; but I'm not sure it is a valid one for most people. Perhaps a model of obligation would be better. Second, biblical and rabbinic Judaism do, indeed, present multiple theological models. That is the strength of the tradition. But how does anyone choose? How does anyone decide that a certain model is closer to reality or better in some way? To put the matter another way: If the tradition provides us with many texts, and life provides each of us with the text of our own lives, how does one integrate these texts? What is the canon of inter- textuality between life as the tradition in its multifacetedness teaches it and the confusing story of our own lives? This book is very rich; almost every page contains an insight worth pondering. So is the life Hartman has chosen to lead and the tasks he has undertaken. We look forward to his next book, which, it is hoped, will cover his views on topics not dealt with here, such as the place of women in modern Orthodox Judaism, the role of the Palestinians in the Jewish state, the problem of the possible split in the unity of the Jewish people, and so on. Hartman's views will be well worth reading. David R. Blumenthal Emory University Atlanta, Ga.</page></plain_text>
