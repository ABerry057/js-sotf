<plain_text><page sequence="1">Roger Brooks. The Spirit of the Ten Commandments: Shattering the Myth of Rabbinic Legalism. San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1990. xiv, 199 pp. The early rabbis' view of the relationship between Scripture and law, or as they would have said, between written and oral Torah, was very complex, not always consistent, and not always clear. An examination of this relation- ship is the most fruitful available path to an understanding of rabbinic Judaism; Roger Brooks both knows this and also sees that much Christian scholarship on Judaism continues to be informed by important mispercep- tions of this key theme. The present volume gathers a set of interesting and relevant rabbinic materials, translates them reliably, and shapes them into a useful corrective to these misperceptions, and thus can only be welcomed. For this reason it is unfortunate that Brooks offers this corrective in an artificial presentation that may well make it harder for some of the intended readers of his book to understand where he is trying to lead them. Brooks's study is both less and more than it claims to be. Despite the main title, it is not simply an examination of the uses of the Decalogue in early rabbinic literature. As the subtitle makes clear, it is in fact an exposition of rabbinic legalism designed to refute some widely accepted conceptions of how that legalism works; it aims in fact to present the very heart of rabbinic Judaism in a sympathetic way. The focus on the Ten Commandments was possibly a tactical decision intended to attract the attention of readers more responsive to such a subject than they would be to a book about the Talmud, but this choice of focus brings us to the ways the book is also less than it seems. Brooks leads up to his own conclusions with a presentation that weakens</page><page sequence="2">300 BOOK REVIEWS those conclusions in two ways. For one thing he draws almost all his illus- trative material from the Jerusalem Talmud to the relative exclusion of the Babylonian, and this in spite of the larger size of the latter and its generally dominant role in the subsequent development of the rabbinic tradition. In a footnote (p. 43, n. 12), Brooks offers a defense of this decision, but the prob- lem remains; it is true that one must avoid homogenizing diverse rabbinic texts, but this project is a kind a homogenization anyway-it speaks of "rab- binic" legalism, not "Palestinian" or "Galilean" legalism or the like-and one cannot have these things both ways. Either the project should have been labeled a study of rabbinic legalism as reflected in certain indicated texts, or the survey of relevant materials should have included the full range of "rab- binic" literature in the usual sense. Second, the essentially apologetic motive underlying the book as a whole occasionally leads Brooks in the direction of excessive praise for the mate- rials he has set out to study or an exaggerated description of their im- portance for the rabbinic tradition as a whole. It is well known, for exam- ple, that reverence for the word of Scripture sometimes drastically limited the freedom of rabbinic interpreters, while on other occasions rabbis devel- oped a rubric of "oral Torah" with virtually no attention at all to biblical treatments of the subject before them. One can try to account for these apparently inconsistent approaches in all sorts of ways, but simply to list them as examples of "The Bible's Relevance (and Irrelevance)" (sic; p. 52) to the rabbinic shaping of the law is to avoid the question entirely. In another place Brooks cites a talmudic discussion of the law of murder that makes no reference at all to the Sixth Commandment and labels it a case of prooftexting by omission (p. 60). To give just one more example, Brooks refers to the well-known aggadah that the two versions of the Sabbath com- mandment were spoken simultaneously and remarks that such a legend "marks the Ten Utterances as truly divine and as wielding divine authority" (p. 51). He does not observe, however, that the very passage in Y. Nedarim which links the two verses in question goes on to identify several other such pairs of verses from the Torah without in any way distinguishing between those sets that come from the Decalogues and those which do not. This tendency to find the Decalogue everywhere in rabbinic literature, even where it isn't, and to make it central to rabbinic thinking, even in pas- sages that seem to imply just the opposite, risks undermining Brooks's whole project in a way that could have been avoided. There is a kind of mis- fit between the real goal of Brooks's study and the structure of exposition</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 301 that he has adopted that reduces the cogency of his argument and allows more opportunity for resisting his conclusions than he really had to allow. One can only encourage him to attack his subject again, with the generality that it deserves, so that the full force of his basic message will reach the large lay and scholarly audience that needs to hear it.
