Littauer Foundation, the S. H. and Helen R. Scheuer Family Foundation, and the Dorot Foundation. The Association is grateful for their support and encouragement. Volume XIII of the AJS Review represents this editorial board's second effort at devoting an issue of the journal to a central theme, in this case the theme of modern Jewish literature. The number of studies presented has resulted in the dedication of volume XIII in its entirety to modern Jewish literature and has necessitated the omission of the normal book reviews. The editorial board is deeply indebted to Professors David C. Jacobson and Naomi Sokoloff who shouldered the heavy burdens of organizing these eight studies, of presenting them to the editorial board, and of supervising the required revisions. We would once again be delighted to receive reactions to this departure from our normal format.</page><page sequence="5">With great sadness, the Editorial Board of the AJS Review notes the death, after a lengthy illness, of Frank Talmage, the founding editor of the Review. Some years ago we wrote the following: "Frank Talmage single-handedly created a major new journal. His indefatigable work, his careful editing, his insistence on the highest standards-all these traits are well known to his col- leagues and amply reflected in the excellence of the journal which he edited for the first eight years of its existence. The Association for Jewish Studies and the entire Jewish scholarly world will remain indebted to Frank." At the time of his death, Frank was Professor of Near Eastern Studies at the University of Toronto. A prolific author and editor, he was internationally recognized as an outstanding authority in medieval Jewish intellectual his- tory, biblical exegesis, and Judeo-Christian polemics. Frank combined an extensive mastery of primary sources and secon- dary literature with wide knowledge of European and Semitic languages and a great sensitivity to texts and their nuances. His passing is a major loss to the field and to the journal which he served with such distinction.</page></plain_text>
