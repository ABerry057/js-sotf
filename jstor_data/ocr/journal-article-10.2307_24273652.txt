This apostate challenged the Yemenite Jews by presenting quotes quotes from the Torah that Muslims considered proof of the future advent advent of Islam and Muhammad (dala'il). The identity of the apostate, however,however, has been disputed by researchers. This article proposes that the the apostate Maimonides had in mind was Samaw 'al al-Maghribl, the Jewish Jewish convert who authored Ifham al-Yahud. The reasoning is based on on unique characteristics of Samaw 'al's tract that distinguish it from other other polemical works. Samaw 'al discussed the dala'il with much greater greater sophistication than any earlier polemicist and used an advanced advanced manner of presentation, in response to which Maimonides provided provided well-conceived refutations. This combination of Samaw 'al's sophisticated sophisticated polemical arguments and Maimonides s replies demon strates that the two appear to be matched. In the second half of the twelfth century CE, a Muslim preacher named 'All b. MahdT gathered a group of followers around him and conquered several districts in Yemen. In 1159 CE, he died and his son, MahdT, succeeded him. Shortly afterwards, MahdT's younger brother, 'Abd al-Nabl, assumed the leadership of the group and conquered all of Yemen except for 'Aden. In 1173 CE, the ruler of San'a5 allied with the ruler of 'Aden and together they held back 'Abd al-Nabl's army, which retreated to ZabTd. Later, in June 1174 CE, the AyyubTs conquered Yemen and ended 'Abd al-NabT's rule.1 Arabic sources describe 'Abd al-NabT as a strictly observant Muslim who severely punished any Muslim resisting his doctrine, and demanded that all Jews under his rule convert to Islam. Many Yemenite Jews complied with his edict, while others became less observant. Concurrently, an anon ymous Jew in Yemen claimed that he was the Messiah and gained many followers.2 Not knowing how to face these difficulties, R. Jacob b. Nathaniel al-Fayyuml, the leader of the Jewish community in Yemen, sent a letter to Moses Maimonides to seek his guidance. In response, in 1172 CE, Maimonides sent him an epistle 1.

One of the crucial points in the Jewish-Muslim polemic that emerges from the events in Yemen is a debate over a traditional Muslim argument that Muham mad was mentioned in the Torah and the Gospel. The claim was based on the fol lowing Qur'anic verse: "Those who follow the messenger-prophet, the ummi,3 whom they find mentioned in the Torah and the Gospel [...]" (Qur'an [henceforth Q.] 7:157).4 It, thus, followed, Muslim polemicists argued, that Jews and Christians should acknowledge Muhammad as a true prophet. Maimonides's answers in the Epistle indicate that Yemenite Jews had to contend with polemical claims about the truth of Islam, raised by an anonymous Jewish apostate, referred to by Maimonides asposhe 'a (lit. criminal).5 This apostate challenged the Yemenite Jews by presenting quotes from the Torah that Muslims considered evidence, or dala'il, of the future emergence of Islam and Muhammad. Although Maimonides considered the dala 'il to be ridiculous and as devices used by some Jewish apostates to endear themselves to the Muslims,6 he found it necessary to refute them, apparently for two reasons. First, some Yemenite Jews were perplexed by the dala'il, and second, some did consider Muhammad a true prophet who had been sent to the Arabs,7 a belief that probably increased their bewilderment. Though scholars have disagreed on the identity of the apostate, based on Maimonides's polemical arguments, it seems that in Maimonides's mind the anon ymous apostate in the Epistle was none other than Samaw'al b. Yahya b. 'Abbas al-Maghribl (1125-1175 CE). By implication, Maimonides was acquainted with Samaw'al al-Maghribl's pamphlet, Ifham al-Yahiid (Silencing the Jews), and made reference to it. Still, this does not necessarily mean that the Jews of Yemen knew the Ifham al-Yahud or that the dala'il that R. Jacob presented to Maimonides were taken from this pamphlet. It is more likely that R. Jacob described the dala 'il in his letter to Maimonides, and the latter answered him in accordance with the representation of the dala'il with which he was familiar from Samaw'al's pamphlet. In 1898, Martin Schreiner suggested, without any real support, that the apos tate referred to in the Epistle was Samaw'al.8 His opinion was accepted by Salo 3. Generally, the word ummi is interpreted as "illiterate." 4.

Baron, also without research.9 Samaw'al was a Jewish scholar, mathematician, and physician who converted to Islam in 1163 CE,10 and immediately wrote a polemical anti-Jewish pamphlet, Ifham al-Yahud," in which he tried to prove that leaving Judaism was justified and that the Jews were ignorant, unreasonable, and inconsistent. Abraham S. Halkin criticized Schreiner,s proposal, and defined all attempts to identify the apostate as unworkable.12 The apostate's identity, Halkin asserted, "is not known. As an apostate to Islam he evidently undertook to spread the new faith among his former coreligionists."13 The polemical use of dala'il to which Maimonides responded does not suffice to prove that Samaw'al was the apostate at issue. After all, Halkin reasoned, many Muslim polemicists other than Samaw'al used the polemical argu ments that Maimonides addressed in the EpistleOther scholars have deferred to Halkin on this issue,15 and set aside the question of the apostate's identity. Some, naturally, have considered him to be a local Yemenite Jew who converted and dis seminated pro-Islamic propaganda among the Jews.16 Halkin's point about the widespread polemical use of dala'il is correct. Dala'il Dala'il were cited in earlier polemical works, such as those of 'Abd Allah b. Muslim b. Qutayba (d. 889 CE) and Abu Hatim Ahmad b. Hamdan al-RazI (d. 933 CE). These previous works, however, did not quote biblical verses directly; they simply paraphrased them, sometimes in the service of their argu ments. In contrast, Samaw'al treated these verses more extensively. Furthermore, before Samaw'al, only one systematic polemical work had been written against the Jews and Judaism: The Refutation of Ibn al-Naghrila the the Jew, may Allah curse him (al-Radd 'aid Ibn al-Naghrila al-Yahudi la 'anahu Allah)Allah) by Abu Muhammad 'All b. Ahmad b. Hazm al-AndalusI (994-1064 CE).17 In it, Ibn Hazm took a methodical scholarly approach to the Bible to prove the "falsification" (tahrif) charge against the Jews in detail.18 9. Salo W.

Scholars disagree about whether Samaw'al was influenced by previous Muslim polemicists. Hanna Shemesh argues that Samaw'al repeats some of Ibn Hazm's arguments but adds arguments of his own as well. Moshe Perlmann has doubts about whether Samaw'al knew Ibn Hazm's work and states, 365</page><page sequence="4">HaggaiHaggai Mazuz According to Halkin the reason why it was unlikely that the apostate was Samaw'al was because Samaw'al had never set foot in Yemen.19 Yet, Samaw'al did not have to be physically present in Yemen for Yemenite Jews to be exposed to his pamphlet. In fact, Samaw'al himself claimed in his autobiography that he had made numerous copies of his pamphlet and that its fame was wide spread.20 Some copies, thus, may have reached Yemen. Most convincingly, there are unique characteristics in Samaw'al's pamphlet that distinguish it from other polemical works. For example, Samaw'al discussed the dala 'il with a much higher degree of sophistication than any other polemicist, including his possible source of inspiration, Ibn Hazm. And when Maimonides responded to the dala'il, he provided well-conceived answers that sufficed to counter such sophisticated arguments. Muslim polemicists had many dala'il in their arsenal, yet Samaw'al men tioned only three. He devoted three consecutive chapters in his pamphlet to this subject (discussing one of them in each chapter). Maimonides also discussed these three dala'il in The Epistle to Yemen in sequence. Samaw'al's arguments and the unique characteristics that distinguish them from the contents of previous polemical pamphlets are presented below, followed by Maimonides's answers, demonstrating that he was directly refuting Samaw'al's arguments. Deuteronomy 18:15/18 In the ninth chapter of Silencing the Jews, titled "An account of the verses and allusions in the Torah that refer to the prophethood of our master Muhammad the chosen—may Allah pray over him and grant him peace," Samaw'al argued that Deuteronomy 18:15/18 hinted at Muhammad's future arrival. He cited the verse in Hebrew letters and then explained its meaning in Arabic: They [i.e., the Jews] cannot deny this verse from the second portion of the fifth book of the Torah:21 נביא אקים להם מקרב אחיהם כמון אליו לשמעון. Meaning: I will "The material in Ibn Hazm and Samaw'al is very often similar. This does not necessarily indicate that the later author borrowed from the earlier one; they may rather have had common sources which cannot now be traced."

This certainly is an allusion to the fact that they shall believe in Muhammad.22 Halkin justifiably noted that this was one of the main arguments used by Muslim polemicists.23 Yet, while other Muslim polemicists simply mentioned this verse asserting that it referred to Muhammad,24 Samaw'al went further by trying to refute a Jewish counterargument to the Islamic commentary on Deuteronomy 18:18, according to which the words "from among their brethren" referred only to Jews.25 To reject it, Samaw'al turned to another biblical verse (Deuteronomy 2:4) to support the claim that Deuteronomy 18:18 presaged Muhammad's arrival. Since the Torah called the children of Esau brothers, Samaw'al argued, we should also consider the children of Ishmael, from whom Muhammad descended, the brothers of the children of Israel. If so, Deuteronomy 18:18 may be applied to Muhammad: Should they [i.e., the Jews] say: The text states, "from among their brethren," and it is unusual for our Scripture to refer to non-Israelites as your brethren, we would say: Ay, it says in the Torah your brethren the children of Esau, namely in the first portion of the fifth book: אתם עברים בגבול אחיכם בני-עשו הישבים בשעיר [Deuteronomy 2:4], Meaning: Ye are to pass through the border of your breth ren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and do not covet any of their lands. Now if the children of Esau were brethren to the children of Israel because Esau and Israel were sons of Isaac, then the children of Ishamel are likewise brethren to all the progeny of Abraham.26 מקרבך מאחיך כמני :קים לך ;הוה אלהיך אליו תשמעו-ן).

Though it is not clear where he learned of this argument—it may have been current among the Jews of his time—Samaw'al states that he is knowledgeable in Jewish literature: "My father had me learn Hebrew writing and then study the Torah and the commentaries until, by the age of thirteen, I had mastered this knowledge." Samaw'al, Ifham al-Yahud, 97. Perlmann notes, "With his unusual self admiration, the author [i.e., Samaw'al] indicates that since previous polemic treatises by distinguished Muslim authors are inadequate, he has decided to use his "inside knowledge" of Jewish scriptures and affairs to assist the community of the believers in its disputations with the Jews." See, Introduction to Samaw'al, Ifham al-Yahud, 18.

One of them seems to demonstrate that he was responding directly to Samaw'al. If taken together with the sequence of verses in which Deuteronomy 18:15/18 were embedded, Maimonides argued, this verse could not be cited as proof of an allusion to Muhammad in the Bible because it was taken out of context.27 Deuteronomy 18:15, he continued, started with "in your midst" (mi-kirbekha), which meant that future prophets sent to foretell what would happen to Israel would live close (karov) to them, "in their midst," so that they would not have to search for them and "travel to distant parts."28 Explaining the phrase, "from among your brethren like myself' (mi-kirbekha(mi-kirbekha me-'aheikha kamoni), Maimonides emphasized that the verse spoke about Jews, and rejected the possibility that it referred to any of the descen dants of Esau, or Ishmael. The very mention of Esau and Ishmael is a rejection of the kind of analogy that Samaw'al presented: Moreover, He [Moses] conveys another notion, namely, that in addition to being near you and living in your midst, he will also be one of you, an Israe lite. The obvious deduction is that you shall be distinguished above all others by the sole of possession of prophecy. The words "like myself' were specifi cally added to indicate that only the descendants of Jacob are meant. For the phrase "from among your brethren" might have been misunderstood and taken to refer also to Esau and Ishmael, since we do find Israel addressing Esau as a brother, in the verse: "Thus says your brother Israel" [Numbers 20:14].9־ According to Halkin, "Samaw'al argues that the words 'your brethren' may well apply to an Arab, supporting himself by the phrase: Your brethren the Children of Esau"Esau" (Deuteronomy 2:4).30 Halkin seems to have missed the correspondence between Samaw'al's argument and Maimonides's reply. Genesis 17:20 In the tenth chapter of his pamphlet, titled, "The allusion to his [i.e., Muhammad's] name in the Torah," Samaw'al argued that Muhammad's future arrival was implied in Genesis 17:20, "And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: behold I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly (bi-me'od me'od)."3' Since the verse started with a direct refer ence to Ishmael, and bi-me 'od me 'od in gematria (the numerology of Hebrew 27.

The verse appears in the text in Hebrew letters. ולישמעאל שמעתיך הנה ברכתי אתו והפריתי אתו והרביתי אתו במאד מאד שנים-עשר נשיאם יוליד ונתתיו לגוי גדול ("And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: 368</page><page sequence="7">The Identity of the Apostate in the Epistle to Yemen letters) is ninety-two, as is the name Muhammad, Samaw'al considered this verse further evidence in the Torah of the future emergence of Muhammad.32 Samaw'al appears to be familiar with a Jewish response to the foregoing Islamic commentary, according to which one cannot deduce a proof of prophet hood from the matching of the gematria of some word, or words, in the Torah to a person's name. The Jews, Samaw'al claimed, argued that this technique was problematic because one could find many such matches (e.g., Zayd, 'Amr, Khalid, and Bakr).33 Therefore, Samaw'al inferred, it was not by chance that the verse under discussion—a divine promise to Abraham on how great and blessed Ishmael was to become—contained the words bi-me'od me'od, that clearly referred to Ishmael's offspring, namely Muhammad.34 Maimonides emphatically refuted Samaw'al's explanation of Genesis 17:20. This verse, he claimed, could not refer to prophecy but only to the number of people who would descend from Ishmael. First, the phrase "a great nation" (goy gadol,gadol, Genesis 17:20) implied neither prophecy nor a law, but merely a multitude. Similarly, the phrase bi-me 'od me 'od simply signified a very large number. If the Lord wished to allude to Muhammad, then the verse would read, "and I shall bless him bi-me'od me'od." And since the verse read, "I shall multiply him (ve-hirbeti(ve-hirbeti 'oto) bi-me'od me'od," it could only denote an increase in numbers.35 Countering Samaw'al's veneration of Ishmael, Maimonides went on to demon strate how other verses in Genesis emphasized that Abraham's heir, the one who would continue his line and his law, was Isaac.36 Ishmael, said Maimonides, "is regarded as an adjunct and appendage in the blessing of Isaac, for God says: 'And also (ve-gam) of the son of the bondwoman (ben ha- 'ammah) will I make a nation (goy), because he is thy seed'" (Genesis 21:13). Thus, while Samaw'al had claimed that Genesis 17:20 referred to the greatness of Ishmael and his descendants, Maimonides cited another verse that explained that Ishmael and his descendants were only to increase in number. Maimonides adds that Ishmael was secondary to Isaac, Abraham's true heir and successor in the path of truth, i.e., Judaism.37 Doing so, Maimonides sought to thwart any effort to derive Muhammad's prophetic status from Jewish Scripture. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation"). 32. Samaw'al, IJham al-Yahud, 31-32. 33. When Maimonides rejects the argument based on Deuteronomy 18:15, he mentions the names Zayd and 'Amr as well: "We disbelieve the prophecies of 'Amr and Zayd," Maimonides says, "not because they are non-Jews [...]. Rather, we believe or disbelieve in a prophet because of what he preaches, not because of his descent, as I shall explain." Maimonides, 'Iggeret Teiman, 50-52. Although these two names are very common in Arabic literature, the fact that they appear in both sources that discuss the dala'il is interesting. 34. Samaw'al, Ifliam al-Yahud, 32-33. 35. Maimonides, 'Iggeret Teiman, 40. 36. Notably, there is a Qur'anic verse that calls Abraham neither a Jew nor a Christian but a Muslim. Q. 3:67 states: "Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was (an) upright (man), a Muslim; and he was not one of the polytheists." 37. Maimonides, 'Iggeret Teiman, 40-42. 369</page><page sequence="8">HaggaiHaggai Mazuz Maimonides's final refutation of the Islamic argument regarding the phrase bi-mebi-me 'od me 'od went beyond the Hebrew Scriptures. Such an argument explicitly contradicted the Qur'an itself, which spoke about a messenger named Ahmad and not not Muhammad;38 Maimonides probably refers to the following Qur'anic verse: And when Jesus, son of Mary, said: O children of Israel, surely I am the mes senger of Allah to you, verifying that which is before me of the Torah and giving the good news of a messenger who will come after me, his name being Ahmad. But when he came to them with clear arguments, they said: This is clear enchantment (Q. 61:6). The gematria of Ahmad, Maimonides claimed, was fifty-three; therefore, it does not correspond to the count of bi-me 'od me'od39 Deuteronomy 33:2 In the first part of the eleventh chapter of Samaw'al's pamphlet, titled, "On the passage alluding to the prophethood of Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad," Samaw,al referred to Deuteronomy 33:2: "And he [i.e., Moses] said, the Lord came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from Mount Paran, and he came with then thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them." This verse, he claimed, alluded to Moses, Jesus, and Muham mad: Sinai to Moses, Seir to Jesus, and Paran to Muhammad.40 Paran appeared in other Muslim polemical works, which simply associated Paran with Mecca, without explanation for this connection. Al-Razi, for example, wrote in connection with this verse: "[The phrase] and his illumination [came] from Mount Paran [refers to] the arrival of Muhammad pbuh from Mecca because Paran is Mecca" (wa-ida'atuhu min jabal Faran hiya zuhur Muhammad (s)(s) min Macca li-anna Faran huwa Macca).41 In contrast, Samaw'al strove to prove that the word Paran referred to Muhammad. According to the Torah, he reasoned, Ishmael lived in Paran (Genesis 21:21), and Ishmael's descendants lived in Paran as well. Since Muham mad was one of IshmaeFs descendants, he also lived in Paran. Plainly, then, Paran was Mecca. And if Paran was Mecca, then Deuteronomy 33:2 clearly referred to the future rise of Muhammad42 In Jewish sources Paran was sometimes linked to Mount Sinai and Samaw'al focus on the question of the meaning of Paran may have been a response to Jewish sources that addressed the place, such as a passage in the Babylonian Talmud (B. Shabbat 89a-b) and perhaps Sa'adiah Gaon's (882-942 CE) 38. Maimonides, 'Iggeret Teiman, 43-45. 39. Maimonides, 'Iggerel Teiman, 43^15. 40. Samaw'al, Ifham al-Yahud, 35. 41.41.

In both sources it is argued that Paran is a synonym for Mount Sinai. In B. Shabbat 89a-b, one of the sages asked R. Kahana: "Hast thou heard what Mount Sinai [connotes]?" Several opinions are offered by the talmudic sages in the ensuing discussion. R. Jose son of R. Hanina said: It has five names: The Wilderness of Zin, [meaning] that Israel was given the commandments there (niztavu)\ The Wild emess of Kadesh, where the Israelites were sanctified (nitkadshu); the Wild erness of Kedemot, because a priority (kedumah) was conferred there; the Wilderness of Paran, because Israel was fruitful (paru) and multiplied there; and the Wilderness of Sinai, because hatred (sin 'ah) toward idolaters descended thereon. Whilst what was its [real] name? Its name was Horev. Now they disagree with R. Abbahu, for R. Abbahu said: its name was Mount Sinai, and why was it called Mount Horev? Because desolation (hurbah)(hurbah) to idolaters descended thereon. In the third chapter of The Book of Beliefs and Opinions, Sa'adiah Gaon debated at length the Islamic doctrine of abrogation of the Torah (naskh),43 claiming that Seir and Paran were additional names for Mount Sinai. The implication of Sa'adiah's commentary, asserting the meaning of Paran as Mount Sinai, is that it refuted the claim that Deuteronomy 33:2 referred to the future prophecy of Muhammad and that Paran was Mecca. According to Sa'adiah: These three [i.e., Sinai, Seir, and Paran] are all of them names applied to Mount Sinai. The reason for its having these different appellations is that whenever a mountain extends toward several countries, its nomenclature is divided according to the names of these countries, each division bearing the name of the country lying opposite to it. Just as one and the same sea acquires from the countries (buldan) bordering it many names corresponding to that of each adjacent country, so is Mount Sinai a mountain opposite the lands of Sinai, Seir, and Paran called by the names of all three because it stands on something resembling a straight line.44 Unlike earlier Jewish thinkers, Maimonides attacked the argument that Deuteron omy 33:2 hinted at Muhammad's future prophecy differently. At first, he skirted geographical definitions and focused instead on the timing of events. He con tended that the Islamic argument regarding the phrase "He appeared from Mount Paran" was invalid because the word "appeared" (hofi'a) was given in 43. One of the Muslim polemicists' arguments is that the Torah has been abrogated and replaced by the Qur'an.

Contradicting Sa'adiah Gaon's explication, Maimonides then offerred another explanation for the appearance of these three names in Deuteronomy 33:2, a syntactic interpretation that combined sequence with geography: The Lord descended gently, occupying the top of one mountain and then moving to another until coming to rest on Mount Sinai.46 One may infer from this that Seir and Paran were mountains close to Sinai; thus, Paran cannot be Mecca. Further Evidence that Maimonides was familiar with Samaw'al's PAMPHLET The The Epistle to Yemen and the topic of the dala'il were not the only areas where Maimonides countered Samaw'al's pamphlet. He also did so in his MishnehMishneh Torah. In one of the chapters of his pamphlet, Samaw'al claimed that not only did the Jews expect the Messiah (al-qa'im)47 to arrive, but they also believed that once the Messiah moved his lips and prayed, all the other nations would die and only Jews would remain in the world, adding that the Jews expected to enjoy sovereignty in a world emptied of all other nations.48 He then claimed that the Jews accepted the parables (amthal) of the prophets literally, overlooking their spiritual meaning. To support his claim, Samaw'al cited Isaiah 11:7 ("And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together and the lion shall eat straw like the ox"), mockingly arguing that the Jews were literally waiting for lions to eat straw, following lions into their dens and throwing straw in front of them to see if they would eat it, for this was a known sign of the coming of the Messiah Messiah 49 The twelfth chapter of The Laws of Kings and Their Wars in Maimonides's Mishneh Mishneh Torah seems to offer a response to Samaw'al's arguments. In the first law of the chapter, Maimonides stated that the nature of the world would not change in the days of the Messiah and that the world would continue according to its current patterns. He then explicitly clarified the meaning of Isaiah 11:7, the very verse that Samaw'al accused the Jews of understanding literally instead of allegorically. "Do not presume," Maimonides wrote, "that in the Messianic age, the nature of the 45. Maimonides, 'Iggeret Teiman, 44. 46. Maimonides, 'Iggeret Teiman, 44. 47.

Here he appears to have misinterpreted the talmudic expression shi'abud malkhuyot (e.g., B. Shabbat 63a, 151b), although the source of his familiarity with the expression is not clear. Shi'abud malkhuyot may denote the Jews' enslavement to non-Jewish nations or their enslavement o/them. The normative Jewish interpretation is the former, a condition that is to end with the arrival of the Messiah; Samaw'al gives it the latter interpretation and defines it as the Jews' nefarious hope and goal. 49.

Rather, the world will continue according to its pattern."50 Indeed, Though Isaiah [11:6] states: "The wolf will dwell with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the young goat," these [words] are a metaphor and a parable. The interpretation of the prophecy is as follows: Israel will dwell securely, together with the wicked gentiles who are likened to a wolf and a leopard, as in the prophecy [Jeremiah 5:6]: "a wolf from the wilderness shall spoil them and a leopard shall stalk their cities." They will all return to the true faith and no longer steal or destroy. Rather, they will eat permitted food, be at peace with Israel, as [Isaiah 11:7] states: "the lion shall eat straw like the ox." Similarly, other Messianic prophecies of this nature are meta phors. In the Messianic era, everyone will realize which matters were implied by these metaphors and what allusions they contained.51 As to the fate of the other nations, the seventh law in chapter 12 of the Mishneh TorahTorah was clear. The other nations would remain in the world and the Jews had no intention or desire to enslave them, or to have sovereignty over the world. "The sages did not yearn for the Messianic era,,י Maimonides stated, "in order to have dominion over the entire world, to rule over the gentiles, to be exalted by the nations, or to eat, drink, and celebrate. Rather, [they desired] to be free [to involve themselves] in Torah and wisdom without any pressures or disturb ances so that they would merit the World to Come as explained in Laws of Repen tancetance (hilkhot teshuva)."52 Conclusion Maimonides Maimonides's responses to the dala'il in The Epistle to Yemen seem to match Samaw'al's sophisticated polemic, and advanced manner of presentation, which differed markedly from that of previous Muslim polemicists. In addition, his statements in the Mishneh Torah seem to respond to Samaw'al's polemical points. Both Samaw'al's and Maimonides's multilayered arguments seem to reflect the back-and-forth of Muslim-Jewish polemic that took place in prior centuries as Muslim polemicists presented arguments and Jews responded to them. Samaw'al responded to the Jewish responses and, finally, Maimonides responded to Samaw'al. Sarah Stroumsa has argued that the image of Ibn al-Rawandl influenced Maimonides in his shaping of the image of Elisha b. Abuyah the heretic (zindiq), and that Maimonides used the same method with Abu Bakr al-RazT 50.
