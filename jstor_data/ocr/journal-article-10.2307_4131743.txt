<plain_text><page sequence="1">Edward Kessler. Bound by the Bible: Jews, Christians and the Sacrifice of saac. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004. xii, 222 pp. Kessler's erudite book aims to prove not only that exegetical encounters oc- curred between the ancient rabbis and the early church fathers in both directions, but also that "to understand properly Jewish or Christian exegesis in late antiqui- ty it is essential to understand each other's interpretations and the influence of one upon the other" (182). He begins by reviewing the shortcomings of previous approaches to Jewish-Christian interaction in late antiquity. Kessler then puts for- ward what he terms the exegetical approach, suggests some controls on this method, and proceeds to test his hypothesis by conducting a verse-by-verse examination of Genesis 22. In each chapter, he first surveys a few major early interpreters, such as Philo and Josephus, and then compares Rabbinic and early Christian interpre- tations on Genesis 22 in some detail. There is also a final chapter that examines ancient artistic renderings of Abraham's near sacrifice of Isaac. This is a book from which any scholar of the Bible and postbiblical Jewish and Christian interpretation will learn much. However, the author has fallen short of demonstrating his thesis. Although Kessler brings forth a few very compelling instances that strongly suggest Jewish awareness of a Christian interpretive move or vice versa, all too often the evidence demonstrates not how these communities are interconnected, but rather, how they "are divided by a common Bible" (112, citing J. Kugel). At times, Kessler's assumptions concerning potential interactions between the rabbis and church fathers leads him to ignore other more mundane explana- 370</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews tions for certain exegetical moves. For example, he argues that the rabbis portray Isaac as a mature adult to counteract the widespread Christian reading that he was a child, an interpretation that Kessler argues is driven by the Christian typology that Isaac the child's deed is consummated in Christ the mature adult. But one need not assume any exegetical encounter at all to explain the Rabbinic tendency to turn Isaac into an adult. In fact, it likely stems from the rabbis' assumption that Sarah's death in Genesis 23 occurred in direct proximity to the events of Isaac's near sac- rifice, perhaps because word of it reached her. In Gen 23:1 Sarah is reported to have died at 127 years old. If she bore Isaac when 90 (Gen 17:17), this would make Isaac 37, a figure that occurs in many rabbinic texts. Furthermore, as Kessler him- self notes, certain prerabbinic works already conceive of Isaac as a mature adult (e.g., Josephus and Judith). It may be true, as Kessler states, that the rabbis' drive to make Isaac a willing participant in the sacrifice could have contributed to the need to turn him into a mature adult, but in any case these interpretations could have developed from a set of internal rabbinic theological ideas with no influence from Christian interpreters. On the Christian side, Kessler presents some possible examples of attempts to counter the idea that Isaac was a mature adult. However, it is the Christian propensity to engage in typological reading, not the rabbinic notion that Isaac was a willing adult, that generate the vast majority of such Christian exegeses. Even when one finds the occasional reaction against or borrowing from the rabbis, this sheds little light on the social particularities of Jewish-Christian interaction. In fairness, Kessler admits that some of his arguments for influence are less than conclusive. While such nuancing is welcome, his method is at times prob- lematic. For example, he cites the use of the word "stake" (or "cross" in his trans- lation) found in GenRab 56:3 as evidence that the rabbis had drawn this image from Christian exegetes (113). Then he argues that this midrashic comment's terseness indicates that later rabbis sought to suppress this Christian connection. Here Kessler claims that the existence of this word and the fact that it is in a terse midrash show two differing instances of exegetical encounters. If both use and nonuse im- ply an encounter, is there any way to disconfirm such an encounter? The truth is that many of his examples show no exegetical encounter what- soever, as even Kessler acknowledges. However, these instances still are of great value in terms of understanding each religion's unique theological interpretation of the Bible. It is unclear to this reader why Kessler does not set out to accomplish the more modest goal of teaching the reader that Jews and Christians can gain tremendous insight into their own tradition by understanding the sister tradition's interpretations. There are also a few minor irritations in Kessler's language as well as in tech- nical aspects such as the printing and indexing. A number of times Kessler speaks of the Rabbis, noting that God "abhorred sacrifice" (46, 55), when he means hu- man sacrifice. On page 104 he implies that Jephthah's daughter is named Seila even within the biblical account. In his chapter on ancient artistic renderings, sev- eral of the plates are reproduced in such poor fashion that this middle-aged read- er could make out few if any of the details in them. And most frustrating is the fact that many of the rabbinic references found within the notes are not indexed (for 371</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews example, the references in notes 37-39, pp. 88-89). Occasionally, references in the text, such as the one to Pseudo-Philo (p. 136), are also not indexed. In the com- puter age, there is no excuse that such a scholarly book has been made less acces- sible to the researcher by poor indexing of the primary sources. None of the above criticisms detracts from the fact that this is a learned and carefully researched book that does indeed enhance our knowledge of rab- binic and early Christian biblical interpretation. In a few places Kessler has es- tablished how one tradition's exegetical insights were employed or countered by the sister tradition. More important, Kessler has further reinforced the value of careful scholarly study in unpacking the development of these two faiths and how both faiths grew out of a common biblical heritage and closely related interpre- tive systems.
