<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAIM WEIZMANN AND THE ELUSIVE MANCHESTER PROFESSORSHIP by JEHUDA REINHARZ In February 1912 Arthur Hantke, a member of the Engeres Aktions- Comit6 (EAC or SAC), asked Chaim Weizmann to undertake a propaganda tour in the United States.' Weizmann refused, but did agree to a shorter tour to European cities during the university semester break in March. In explaining his reasons for traveling only to Berlin, Vienna, Prague, and Heidelberg,2 Weizmann revealed some of his plans for the future: In preparing this essay, I consulted notes written by the late Rt. Hon. Richard H. S. Crossman, the official biographer of Chaim Weizmann. I have greatly benefited from his insights and formulations. I would also like to thank the late Professor Philip J. Elving of the University of Michigan and Professor Saul G. Cohen of Brandeis University for commenting on those parts of the paper dealing with chemistry. 1. See Arthur Hantke to Weizmann, February 13, 1912. Central Zionist Archives (hereafter CZA) Z3/524. Weizmann was not always welcome as a Zionist propagandist. In some Zionist circles he apparently had the reputation of initiating sharp and unpleasant controversies. See, e.g., letter from the Comit6 Central de la FHd6ration Zioniste Belge of December 2, 1912, in which the Belgian Zionists specifically asked the Central Zionist Office in Berlin to refrain from sending Weizmann on propaganda tours. CZA, Z3/772. 2. The tour was very successful. In Vienna and Prague his lectures on "Zionismus und Staatsbuergertum" were very well received. See Die Welt, no. 15, April 12, 1912, p. 451. Robert Weltsch, who led the "Bar Kochba" group in Prague at the time, also recalled Weizmann's visit, some sixty-three years later.

But I want to go to Palestine not when I have nothing to lose here, but on the contrary after having achieved everything here. This "everything" consists of two things: a full professorship and admission to the Royal Society. The former has been achieved except for the official announcement, which will presumably come during the summer term [sic]. The second is somewhat more difficult for a Russian Jew. However, the matter has got to the point where my candidature has been established. How long the candidature will "stand" depends on the scope and character of my scientific work, for in my case this is the only deci- sive criterion. I must therefore strain every nerve to work and publish a great deal, for admission to the Royal Society will open all doors for me here. I shall then be worth ten times as much to you. ... I have a definite aim in view, and I have worked hard for years to attain it. I have achieved a great deal here, and this is my last ambition here in the Golus, for it will make me independent and give me the best introduction for Palestine. I shall not conceal from you that I have yet another ambition-to become English Consul in Palestine, and if necessary I shall take the examination for it.3 Weizmann's frank discussion of his goals only hinted at his ambition to be independent. By "independence" he meant financial as well as profes- sional independence. Weizmann had always been plagued by the lack of financial security. Ever since he began to work at the age of eleven, Weiz- mann had yearned for financial security. For years he had been patenting chemical inventions, hoping that one of them would bring him a large, steady income. Ironically, he had achieved a partial financial independence only in 1901 during his Geneva years-at the outset of his career-when he and his collaborator, Christian Deichler, sold one of their first patents to the Bayer Works in Elberfeld.4 By the beginning of 1912 Weizmann had seventeen patents registered alone or with collaborators.5 Of all these he was able to sell only his camphor patent, which brought him 300 francs each month until just prior to World War I.6 His income consisted of this patent 3.

The camphor patent was sold in 1907 to Leon Givaudan, who owned a plant producing perfumes and aromatics in Vernier, near Geneva. Weizmann owed his interest in camphor to William Perkin, who had encouraged him to investigate the field as soon as Weizmann arrived in Manchester in 1904.

The total amounted to at most ?450-500 per year.7 When, in April 1912, he was placed in charge of a course in chemistry for medicine and a course on coloring matters at the University of Manchester, his annual salary was increased to ?450,8 which was quite substantial at the time. Nevertheless it seemed inadequate to maintain the Weizmann household, and Weizmann frequently asked for loans from Moses Gaster and later from Ahad Ha'Am and Julius Simon.9 From the beginning of their married life, Chaim and Vera Weizmann lived beyond their means. Before she married, Vera had never earned an income. While a student in Geneva she was supported first by her parents and then by an older brother when their financial situation deteriorated.10 When she came to Manchester in 1906 as Chaim's wife, it was at her insistence that the Weizmanns moved to a house in a better neighborhood (on Birchfields Road) and bought new furniture. Since she did not know how to cook, or care to learn, they employed a maid who did the cooking, washing, and cleaning." As soon as Benjy, the Weizmanns' first son, was born, in June 1907, they also employed a nanny. From the start, the Weizmanns took vacations a few times a year, usually in the Austrian, Italian, or French Alps, in Switzerland or the south of France, and on other occasions in Wales University in 1909 and taught in the same department, was also interested in camphor and, in fact, was the one to point the way out of the labyrinth of camphor chemistry. 7. According to Weizmann ?700 per year. See Weizmann to Ahad Ha'Am, January 17, 1912. WL V, p. 270. This is clearly an exaggerated figure for this period, intended probably to boost his salary at the Technicum in Haifa, should he get a job at that institution. Weizmann ceased working for the Clayton Aniline Company in 1910. 8. See Senate Committee Minutes of April 23, 1912, John Rylands Archives, RA/3/4, vol. V, p. 27. See also Weizmann to Ahad Ha'Am, April 28, 1912. WL V, p. 291. It seems that in light of his new university obligations and salary, Weizmann invented for himself the title of "independent lecturer." In fact he was still a senior lecturer, but his teaching duties were apparently reduced in the spring of 1912. His new salary and responsibilites became effective in October 1912. See list of appointments of faculty members of the University of Manchester, John Rylands Archives, UA/18/16R. 9. The loans from Ahad Ha'Am continued throughout 1914, i.e., after Weizmann had been promoted to the position of reader which carried with it the considerable salary of ?600. At that point Vera was also earning a salary. Their combined income just prior to World War I must have been close to ?1,000. 10.

Both seemed to like the good life.12 According to Vera, her husband's tastes were expensive and he had little monetary sense.'3 Vera was more aware of the need to save money, but she, too, wanted to live in style. If she tried to save money, it was - according to her own autobiography-by attempting to check Weizmann's generous financial contributions toward his siblings' education and by choosing a good (and inexpensive) dressmaker in a little back street who made her three well-cut dresses a year, which she took care to preserve.14 Having to cut corners,'" and aware that they had to watch their budget, the Weizmanns were sensitive to the wealth of their acquaintances and friends. While on his propaganda trip to the Continent in late March 1912, Weizmann was invited to the Berlin apartment of Richard Lichtheim, a German Zionist who came from a wealthy family.'6 "They have a very elegant apartment and live in the Berlin fashion like everybody else," wrote Weizmann the following day. "We two are real proletarians compared with all that crowd."'' At the end of his trip he stopped over in Heidelberg, where his friend Julius Simon lived in the style of the upper bourgeoisie. "They have a jewel of a villa in terrific taste, everything very expensive, but not parvenu," Weizmann reported.'8 He felt so comfortable in this environment that he decided to extend his stay, ostensibly in order to be able to attend the circumcision ceremony of the son of his dear friend Berthold Feiwel. He continued to regale Vera with details of the Simon household: "It's very pleasant in this house. Julius and his wife are very nice people and very cultured. She's a bit too loud, but very cultured and intelligent. He is pure gold. They have a gorgeous house. A lot of beautiful things, beautiful books and a great deal of real taste in everything. They certainly live better than we do.... It isn't like Manchester, where everything is so grim and heavy."'9 12. See interview with T R. Fyvel (W.A.), who describes their life-style in London later on, but one can assume that these inclinations and tastes were not cultivated overnight.

They were both elitists who felt that they rightly belonged among the higher economic and intellec- tual strata of society. Though Weizmann knew how to communicate with the Eastern European immigrants, it certainly never occurred to him to live in their neighborhoods;20 he rarely socialized with them in England, not even with their intelligentsia. The exceptions to this rule were men like Ahad Ha'Am and Nahum Sokolow, who had great prestige in the Zionist move- ment. The one person who was below his station, as it were, with whom Weizmann did keep up contact in England was Joseph Massel, who had sheltered and provided for him during his first days in Manchester. Though he liked to talk to the members of Manchester's Zionist groups, he never really got close to them. "There was no intimacy of contact, no real warmth of affection. Of course there were some Zionists to whom he was delighted to talk. But once the conversation was finished, he wanted to escape to his laboratories or to his home."21 If Weizmann remained personally aloof from the masses, he did retain an emotional bond with them. Vera, on the other hand, had no emotional ties to them at all. If Weizmann could, in a moment of anger, exclaim that he was "fed up" with his fellow Jews,22 it was because he cared about them and wanted to refashion them into "better" Jews. Vera could only express impatience with them.23 Her assimilationist background24 and class- conscious attitudes dictated her social preferences and behavior. In Manchester, as later, she always preferred the company of high-class Jews and the English. Though she was the wife of only a senior lecturer and could hardly speak proper English, Vera's entry into Manchester's upper society was rather 20. The immigrants concentrated in and around the lower part of Cheetham Hill; as their economic condition improved, they moved up the hill. Weizmann always lived a few miles away from this area, in close proximity to, or south of, the university. 21. Israel M. Sieff, "The Manchester Period," in Chaim Weizmann: A Biography by Several Hands, ed. Meyer W. Weisgal and Joel Carmichael (New York, 1963), p. 90. When Weizmann spoke on Zionist affairs in the center of the immigrant community, he frequently did so at the Jewish Working Men's Club. The club was established by well-to-do Jews for workers, to help "protect" them from socialist influences. 22. See Weizmann to Vera, May 30, 1912. WL V, p. 309. 23. In her memoirs Vera recorded that while Weizmann visited Massel "I would sit in silence, sniffing the smell of print, waiting for us to go home." Vera Weizmann, The Impossible Takes Longer, p. 32. 24. Vera's ignorance of Judaism was such that she was often unaware of the date of the High Holidays and needed to be reminded by Weizmann.

Vera was "of medium height, graceful and well poised, dressed with distinctive taste, though not expen- sively. Her eyes were hazel, her hair between colors, her brow was open and serene, her mouth broad, generous, amused. She was a beautiful woman."25 Though most of the professors' wives were twice her age, they immediately adopted her. They must have sensed that this impressive-looking woman belonged-if not by class then by inclination-to their own elitist circle. Though puzzled by some of the habits and customs of polite society, Vera clearly took a liking to the weekly "at homes" with their innumerable cups of tea, toast, and cakes.26 Before her arrival in Manchester, Weizmann spent his free hours mainly with the family of his employer, Charles Dreyfus, with William Perkin, his mentor and the senior chemistry professor at Man- chester University, and, occasionally, with the professor of philosophy, Samuel Alexander, and some of the chemists working for Dreyfus at the Clayton Aniline Company.27 With time, of course, an intimate Zionist group consisting of Norman Bentwich, Leon Simon, Harry Sacher, and a few others gathered around him. Vera, however, was not content with this circle. She was eager to be invited into Manchester's better homes. Within a short time, she became a frequent visitor to the homes of the ladies Lap- worth, Schuster, Behrens, Perkin, Kolp, and other members of the city's elite. It was during one of these social occasions that Vera met Caroline Schuster, the wife of Professor Arthur Schuster, who admired Vera's charm and abilities and immediately took a great liking to her. In the period before World War I, the Weizmanns were frequent visitors in the Schuster home in the exclusive neighborhood of Victoria Park, a short distance from their own house on Birchfields Road. The Weizmanns were charmed by the Schusters and their life-style. This was a different English society from the one so disparaged by Weizmann when he first arrived in Manchester. The Weizmanns were determined to emulate the Schusters, but this would take more money than Weizmann earned. In response, Vera decided to obtain her British qualification in medicine, a goal she had had in mind since 1907.28 Because she had earned 25. Sieff, Memoirs, p. 66. 26.

He moved to England in 1869 and in 1876 founded the Clayton Aniline Company, of which he was managing director until his retirement in 1913. Weizmann had worked for the Clayton Aniline Company on a part-time basis since March 1905, a few months after his arrival in England. 28. See Weizmann to Moses Gaster, January 15, 1907.

In 1910 she began her studies. Despite the frequent bouts of ill health that plagued her and Benjy, she succeeded in obtaining her bachelor of medicine and surgery degree on December 19, 1912.29 After an extended vacation in Cannes during the winter of 1912-1913, she took a position in May 1913 as public health officer in Manchester in charge of a clinic for expectant mothers.30 She could finally contribute a second salary to the family budget. If Vera was resentful of Weizmann's burdensome Zionist activities, she did encourage him to expand his horizons in various branches of chemistry during vacations from the university. Although this was time they could have spent together in Manchester or in the mountains, they both willingly made the sacrifice, hoping that the research would bring them financial security. A few years after settling in Manchester, Weizmann became inter- ested in biological chemistry and in bacteriology, which he regarded as a special branch of organic chemistry. No facilities for this work were availa- ble at Manchester University, since biochemistry was not yet part of the curriculum. Bacteriology was confined to the medical school.3' Beginning in March 1909, therefore, Weizmann regularly gave up his spring and summer university vacations, as well as his work and income at the Clayton Aniline Company, in order to work at the Pasteur Institute's bacteriological and microbiological departments, under the direction of the well-known bio- chemist Auguste Fernbach, director of the fermentation laboratory at the institute.32 In Paris Weizmann became acquainted with French civilization and the French way of life. He usually stayed in the Latin Quarter with Vera's sister Rachel and her husband Joseph Blumenfeld, a chemical engineer. In Paris Weizmann met some of the most brilliant chemists and physicists of the day, including Georges Urbain, Jean Baptiste Perrin, and Paul Langevin. For a time he worked in Perrin's laboratory at the Sor- bonne, learning something about colloidal chemistry. He did not let any 29. See Weizmann to Ahad Ha'Am, December 16, 1912. WL V, p. 329. 30.

During one of the Weizmanns' vacations in Switzerland, he spent a few weeks studying milk bacteriology with the distinguished scientist Robert Burri. The rest of his training in biochemistry he supplemented with his own reading and work in Manchester.33 In the spring of 1910 Weizmann's regular visits to the Pasteur Institute received a new sense of purpose. On February 8, 1910, Professor William Perkin-the senior chemistry professor at Manchester University- employed Weizmann in research on the production of synthetic rubber for which Perkin had a contract with Strange and Graham Ltd. of London. At the beginning of the twentieth century, a crisis developed in the supply of natural rubber from the Far East, caused both by the rapidly increasing demand for this commodity and by local difficulties in production.34 The resulting shortage increased the interest in creating a synthetic substitute for natural rubber. At that time the idea of synthetic rubber was revolutionary. Though synthetic substitutes for natural products were known and had been used in the pharmaceutical and dyestuff industries, this was not the case for complex high-molecular-weight materials such as rubber or natural fibers. In Germany the chemist Carl Harries had just discovered that natural rubber was a hydrocarbon which, when heated to high temperatures, released isoprene. The conclusion was, therefore, that if one could find a good method of making isoprene, one might be able to convert it into synthetic rubber.35 The prospects, then, of making a fortune in producing a scarce commo- dity attracted the firm of Strange and Graham. Edward Halford Strange, the company's director, engaged Professor William Perkin36 to assist the company in the technical research, offering to pay him ?1,000 a year plus royalties.37 Perkin accepted this generous offer and in turn asked Weizmann 33. Weizmann, Trial and Error, p. 133. 34. At the time, the price of natural rubber in England had soared to 12 shillings per pound and was still rising.

The first is the court proceedings dealing with a suit brought by Weizmann and Commercial Solvents Corporation-a U.S.-based</page><page sequence="9">WEIZMANN AND THE ELUSIVE MANCHESTER PROFESSORSHIP 223 if he would care to serve as his research assistant, for which he would pay him ?250 a year plus 33 percent of the profits which Perkin would receive from any royalties or patents resulting from their joint work. Eager for a larger income, Weizmann jumped at the offer.38 Thus, when he went to the Pasteur Institute in the spring of 1910, Weizmann was very excited about the prospect of finally making a lot of money in the world of industrial chemis- try. It occurred to Weizmann right away that it would be a good idea to draw into the research team Professor Auguste Fernbach, who knew more about alcohol fermentation processes than either Weizmann or Perkin. Fernbach was interested, and upon his return to England, Weizmann broached the idea with Edward Strange, who promptly invited the French chemist to join the team.39 Fernbach agreed to join on terms that were far less generous than those offered Perkin40 and brought with him one of his own assistants at the Pasteur Institute, Moses Schoen.41 Halford Strange, who himself had a general background in chemistry, was also considered part of the research group. Thus, by the fall of 1910 an Anglo-French research syndicate was formed which set itself the task of investigating the question of synthetic rubber simultaneously in Manchester and in Paris. To create synthetic rubber on a commercial scale, the research team concentrated at first on the production of amyl and butyl alcohols by fer- mentation processes.42 Fernbach and Schoen worked in Paris and the others company-against Strange and Graham and Synthetic Products Company Ltd. in 1926. The proceedings are contained in a report called "Reports of Patent, Design, and Trade Mark Cases," vol. XLIII, no. 7 (London, 1926), hereafter cited as Reports of Patent.

The attention of the group was directed chiefly to the means of producing amyl alcohol, and in January 1911 Fernbach and Weizmann found a mixture of bacteria that would ferment the starch in potatoes, yield- ing in the process amyl alcohol. The following month Weizmann was able to produce the same substance with other bacteria.43 The members of the group thereupon concentrated their efforts on the amyl alcohol route to isoprene and synthetic rubber. But at the end of March 1911 it was found that, during certain experiments at Paris and Manchester, the fermentations had produced butyl alcohol, and from that time the energies of the group were diverted toward ascertaining the means by which this material could best be obtained. The first order of business was to select or discover the particular bacillus that would yield the best results. Such a bacillus- referred to variously as BF (Bacillus Fernbach) or FB-was discovered by Fernbach in June 1911. A culture of this bacillus was isolated, and that same month it was sent to Weizmann via Strange.44 Fernbach and Weizmann now endeavored to produce butyl alcohol in bulk by fermenting the starch in potatoes.45 At that time it was already known that in the fermentation of sugar to alcohol by yeast, a minor by-product was "fusel-oil," essentially a mixture of amyl alcohols each of which contains five carbon atoms. It was assumed, erroneously as it turned out, that these alcohols, like ethyl alcohol itself, were produced by the fermentation of sugar, and Weizmann's atten- tion was therefore drawn to fermentation processes in general-an unusual subject for an organic chemist at that time-and to the problem of finding a microorganism which would yield five-carbon alcohols as the main product, not just a by-product, of fermentation. The Russian microbiologist Winogrodsky had already discovered the existence of a bacterium or a group of bacteria able to ferment carbohydrates and produce an alcohol with an odor similar to that of fusel-oil, as well as another well-known chemical substance-acetone. However, this alcohol was butyl alcohol, containing only four carbon atoms, a compound already known, but at the same time not used for any practical purpose. William Perkin, who of all the 43.

See, e.g., Court of Justice, Fernbach to Strange, January 23, 1912.</page><page sequence="11">WEIZMANN AND THE ELUSIVE MANCHESTER PROFESSORSHIP 225 members of the team understood the least about fermentation, therefore recommended that this substance be called not "butyl" but "futile alcohol" and suggested that "the stuff be poured down the sink."46 Despite Perkin's pessimism, Strange decided to erect a plant at Rain- ham, Lincolnshire, for the production of materials developed in the inter- mediate stages of research. In contrast to Perkin, Weizmann was confident of the outcome of his research. To Ahad Ha'Am he boasted: I have actually reached the end and overcome all difficulties in the synthesis of rubber and the laboratory stage is finished. This business should now be trans- ferred to the factory. Whether my Industriertitter will have enough patience and ability to take advantage of what I am convinced is a really good job, or whether they will turn it into something purely for speculation, I don't know; and this problem is causing me a lot of worry, because I shouldn't like to be left with nothing but my chemical "fame."47 Characteristically, he had jumped the gun, rushing to inform Strange that he would soon send the isoprene he would produce in his lab. His report turned out to be inaccurate, resulting in recriminations from Strange.48 While Weizmann and Fernbach were struggling to make headway on the question of fermentation, with a view to converting sugar starch into higher alcohols,49 an important discovery was made in March 1912 by one Mr. Kane the works-manager at Rainham. Using BF and some crude methods of distillation, Kane realized that the fermentation of starch yielded, in addi- tion to other products, a considerable quantity of acetone.50 The discovery of acetone was made known, of course, to Weizmann, who did not imme- 46. As it turned out, he was wrong. An interesting and rather unexpected property of the minute rodlike bacterium, subsequently given the systemalic name "Clostridium acetobutyli- cum Weizmann" (nicknamed B-Y), was its ability to ferment starch directly, i.e., without prior treatment, since it contains maltase, which can split starch to "fermentable" sugars.

One of its important uses was its ability to make gunpowder "smokeless." When treated with acetone, gunpowder burns with a minimum of smoke, a discovery which would become very important when the First World War broke out, since it meant that the location of guns, especially the big naval guns, could be concealed.53 Halford Strange had for some time labored under the difficulty of raising sufficient capital for his research syndicate.54 With the discovery by Kane of an efficient method for the production of acetone, he decided that the moment had come to expand his company, which was to be renamed The Synthetic Rubber, Fusel Oil and Acetone Manufacturing Co., Ltd., with a capital of ?500,000 to be raised by public subscription for shares.55 In order to induce the public to buy shares in the new company, Strange com- missioned a certain Dr. Otto Hehner, who was in his employ, to write a scientific report on the production of acetone, amyl alcohol, and butyl alcohol through fermentation of potatoes.56 The report claimed a much higher yield than had in fact been hitherto discovered with any bacterium.57 Strange knew quite well that he could not get away with making such a claim concerning the experiments at Rainham. What he needed was the backing of well-known chemists whose statements would not be questioned by anyone. Sir William Ramsay, professor of chemistry at London Univer- sity and recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1904, had already expressed his inter- 5 1. The power of producing acetone in the fermentation of carbohydrates was not peculiar to the bacillus BF. It is the property of all butylic ferments of starch. 52.

Strange had no problem persuading Perkin to vouch for the experiments that had been made at Rainham.59 Moreover, Perkin agreed to give a lecture on June 17, 1912, to the Society of Chemical Industry which would promote the new company, twelve days before the prospectus was to be issued.60 It was more difficult to move Fernbach to write a report based on the experiments at the Pasteur Institute that would excite both the scientific community and the public. In reply to Strange's request of May 8, 1912, Fernbach truthfully reported that he lacked sufficient evidence to write the kind of report that Strange had in mind. Yet, he too, like Ramsay and Perkin, was tempted by the prospect of making money. He therefore demanded a seat on the board of directors of the new company as a conditio sine qua non. He also urged that a new experiment be conducted before he wrote the report. Both conditions were accepted immediately by Strange.6' Fernbach had been conducting an experiment with maize (rather than potatoes) as the raw material. The experiment went well for about ten days, but at the end it turned out to be a failure, yielding no more than 25 to 28 percent acetone and higher alcohols, about equal to the amount which had been obtained by Kane in Rainham.62 Nevertheless Fernbach discarded his 58. Court of Justice, Strange to Weizmann, April 30, 1912. 59. Early on in their collaborative research, when Strange published a prospectus that used Weizmann's and Perkin's names, the latter wrote to Strange-perhaps at Weizmann's insis- tence-that "the prospectus has the appearance at least, of being an attempt to raise money on our names and reputations and it was widely enough circulated to create a a very unfavorable impression in scientific circles. We have every reason to object strongly to such a document being sent out without our knowledge or sanction." Court of Justice, Perkin to Strange, July 27, 1910. Clearly, Perkin's qualms about the use of his name had in the meantime been allayed by the prospect of making his fortune. 60. See Court of Justice, Strange to Weizmann, April 30, 1912, and Reports of Patent, p. 214. In a letter to Fernbach of May 8, 1912, Strange wrote: "Perkin is to read a paper to the Society of Chemical Industry on June 17 setting out such portions of our position as we deem wise. ... We are anxious to get our statement ahead of the big German boom which is being engineered for September at the Congress of Applied Chemistry in Washington. . .

Fernbach stated clearly: "Our large fermentation experiment on Maize has been going on with very great speed for ten days when it stopped suddenly. The result is about the same as what you have yourself obtained at Rainham. ... the fermentation of maize is far from being so easy as the fermentation of potatoes."</page><page sequence="14">228 JEHUDA REINHARZ earlier pangs of conscience and wrote a report that was purposely mis- leading and which could be interpreted as saying that he had been able to extract as much as 42 percent of the substances in question from maize, whereas in fact he had obtained those results only from potatoes.63 Thus, Strange finally had his professors where he wanted them: lured by money, they were, in fact, backing false advertisements. The distinguished galaxy of Ramsay, Perkin, and Fernbach did not fail to impress the public, and at least ?75,000 was raised through subscriptions.64 Weizmann knew all along that the reports from Rainham and the Pasteur Institute were incorrect.65 He kept quiet, nevertheless, because he too saw a chance of finally becoming rich. He could assuage his conscience by telling himself that he had neither written the misleading reports nor permitted his name to appear in the company's prospectus. Moreover, Fern- bach, who realized that Weizmann was the real brain in the English team, sought to tie Weizmann closer to the project by improving his financial terms with the new company. In anticipation of Strange's visit to Paris on May 18, 1912, Fernbach invited Weizmann to stipulate his own condi- tions.66 Realizing that this was a once-in-a-lifetime chance, Weizmann decided that he would personally travel to Paris (May 17, 1912) to prepare with Fernbach for their meeting with Strange.67 By the time he crossed over to Paris, Weizmann had already read the first draft of Perkin's lecture, scheduled for delivery a month hence. The lecture was apparently written for Perkin-who had little knowledge of the substance of the experiments -by a chemist employed by Strange and Graham called Francis Edwards Matthews in collaboration with Halford Strange. Late in April, Strange sent over the draft to Weizmann with the request "for the addition of any scien- tific stuff which you think ought to go in. I have arranged with Perkin 63. Reports of Patent, p. 232. Fernbach wrote the following: "I have discovered fermenta- tion processes which by employing starchy substances, namely, cereal grains such as maize, as raw materials produce higher alcohols and acetone.... In addition to working on the labora- tory scale I have conducted the process successfully in large size vessels and under certain conditions obtained over 42 per cent of the starch employed converted into mixed higher alcohols." 64. Court of Justice, Strange to Perkin, July 3, 1912: "We were only asking for the ?450,000 on the off chance that the public might like to give it to us." 65.

But if Perkin was going to have all the prestige, Weizmann was determined to improve his contract with Strange. Having worked out the strategy with Vera in advance, Weizmann wrote her of the outcome of negotiations on May 18. A hard day is over. I have been up since 8 in the morning, at the Institute from 9. Shall let you know the results briefly. I have concluded an agreement which we shall put in writing in a few days by means of an dchange de lettres, accord- ing to which I shall get 25% of what Fernbach makes as profit, and in addition to that Fernbach will pay me 100 pounds a year from the salary he receives from Strange. I consider this arrangement very satisfactory. I certainly didn't expect to succeed in getting anything in cash beyond the 25%. Besides, I was fully convinced that Strange would take all measures to get me under contract to them, as he knows that I have no obligations whatever to Perkin as regards keeping secrets, etc. etc. I told him I would sign up a con- tract with them only if they gave me a guarantee to pay me a decent and regular salary. He understands this perfectly and it is in his interest to have me tied up-if I let him-and to pay for it. His affairs are apparently going very well.... I hope my Verochka will be pleased. I kept in mind that you told me "to think of you during these business talks . . ."69 Strange was willing to sign a contract with Fernbach, but only after June, presumably in order to first see the rate of public subscriptions.70 All he had to do now, Weizmann thought, was to sit quietly and wait for Strange to give a new contract to Fernbach, who would in turn write Weizmann a letter confirming their oral arrangements. Once he had the letter from Fernbach, he would demand from Perkin a larger share of the latter's ?1,000 per annum retainer. Should Perkin refuse, he would threaten to walk out on him, free to use the knowledge he had acquired on fermenta- tion processes as he wished."7 To Vera, who had in the meantime gone for a 69.

In this letter Strange reviewed developments in Manchester after Weizmann returned from Paris in May. Weizmann had, no doubt, also indicated to Fernbach that he would walk out on the team, which is why Fernbach sought to bind him to the group through a more forceful contract.</page><page sequence="16">230 JEHUDA REINHARZ two weeks' vacation to Baslow, Derbyshire, he wrote on May 21 that Perkin was unaware of what was going on.72 But Perkin was not deceived. Possibly he had in the meantime been alerted to the new situation by Strange. Perkin fully understood that once Weizmann had made an arrangement with Fernbach, he was out of his control. A day later, he pressed Weizmann to inform him in detail of the agreement made in Paris. When told, he warned Weizmann to cancel this new deal, since, according to Perkin, Weizmann had made a commitment to the University Council-prior to the change in his appointment in April-not to undertake any new outside work.73 Weiz- mann refused to budge, and Perkin went to London to see Strange.74 Within less than a fortnight Perkin had turned from being Weizmann's mentor into his most dangerous enemy, writing openly to Strange that he was sick of Weizmann and wished that "the affair in Jerusalem would hurry up."75 Moreover, Perkin had Strange's full cooperation in plotting against Weiz- mann. Strange still held a grudge against Weizmann for having misled him on the question of isoprene and for having aggressively pressed a few months earlier for permission to publish the results of some of the experi- ments undertaken on behalf of the company. Strange had suspected since 1911 that Weizmann wished to claim credit for work that was not his own.76 This reservoir of suspicion and resentment now came to the fore when Strange realized that Weizmann's strategy was to corner him and Fernbach, forcing them into an agreement which could then be used against Perkin, 72. Weizmann to Vera, May 21, 1912. WL V, p. 302. 73. Court of Justice, Weizmann to Strange, May 22, 1912. Perkin seems to have been right in this case, though the evidence is somewhat ambiguous. In its meeting of 1912 the senate of the university resolved "that Dr. Weizmann's stipend be raised to ?450 per annum, it being understood that his position as to external work be the same as that of other members of the staff." Senate Committee Minutes of April 23, 1912. John Rylands Archives, RA/3/4, vol. V, p. 27. The council of the university had monitored Weizmann's work outside the university all along.

See Court of Justice, Strange to Weizmann, August 1, 1911; Weizmann to Strange, September 1, 1911. On September 6 Strange wrote to Matthews: "You will note that behind what I have stated is the feeling that if we are not careful Weizmann will endeavor to secure credit for himself which only belongs to him as a unit of the Research Organization. I am begin- ning to think that our association with Weizmann may have to come to an end unless he is prepared to accept the position as part of the machine."</page><page sequence="17">WEIZMANN AND THE ELUSIVE MANCHESTER PROFESSORSHIP 231 whom Strange held in high esteem as a loyal friend.77 In consultation with Perkin, Strange undertook to turn Fernbach against Weizmann as well. With all three of them lined up in one camp, Weizmann would have to give up his exaggerated demands or be left out in the cold. Strange returned to Paris and reported to Perkin on his conversation with Fernbach. I commenced by asking Fernbach whether Weizmann was an old friend of his as I had been rather led to understand so from Weizmann's remarks. Fernbach told me that he may have known him three months previously and that only casually. I said: "Is he a man upon whom you have any reason to doubt his absolute reliance?" He said: "No, and I should be very shocked if we found we could not give him our full confidence." I then told him what I knew of Weizmann's history and his proved tendency to lying in ordinary and scien- tific matters and of his continual campaign for slightly more cash. Fernbach told me that he had agreed to the 25% commission to Weizmann because he felt that he undoubtedly owed some commission to Weizmann for his valuable introduction between himself and Strange and Graham Ltd. He also felt that it was unsafe that such valuable knowledge should be in the possession of a man of Weizmann's type without his having some direct interest in it. I told him of Weizmann's threats to you, that he considered himself free to do what he liked with any information including rubber if he did not obtain terms from you which he considered satisfactory. I also told him of the promise not to do any outside work which he is alleged to have given, by which he has secured his new appointment [at the university]. Fernbach has agreed to give Weizmann nothing in writing until we have discussed the thing and drawn up a joint plan of campaign. I have been considering the agreement between yourself and Weizmann and I am more astonished of Weizmann's effrontery in making the threats he did to you and also to me in London. ... I do not wish to have any fuss about this while the flotation [of the new company's shares] is in progress, but when it is over I think the best plan will be to invite Weizmann to meet yourself, myself, Matthews and Fernbach, produce an agreement giving him the maximum we are prepared to agree to, and if he does not sign it, we will fire him out. In my opinion it is quite a question whether we cannot get an injunction from the High Court to restrain Weizmann from uttering threats to disclose secret information in his possession. .... This is a weapon up our sleeve.... Finally, I have come to the conclusion that attempts to work in a friendly way with Weizmann only invite aggression on his part and in future I am 77.

The fact that we are not ready to deal with the situation for a few weeks will act in our favor as at present he has strained himself up to a move on impudence and daring, but I think this will evaporate during the next few weeks of uncer- tainty.78 Weizmann had no clue as to Strange's machinations against him,"79 but he realized that Fernbach had become the linchpin of the team and that his decision would make or break Weizmann's case. Consequently Weizmann went over to Paris once again on May 29 to present his arguments to Fernbach, who was then conferring with Strange as well. Fernbach may have had some reservations about Weizmann's personal style, but he had no doubt that this brilliant chemist was essential to the success of the project. After hearing both sides of the argument, he thought Perkin was trying to misuse his rank to browbeat Weizmann into submitting to his own financial demands. Fernbach therefore suggested an arrangement by which Weiz- mann would hand over to Perkin one-third of what he got from Fernbach, whereas Perkin would concede to Weizmann one-third of his own profits on synthetic rubber.s0 This agreement favored Perkin in any case, since the work on butyl and amyl alcohols and on acetone at the Pasteur Institute and at Rainham seemed more promising at the time. Strange agreed to this scheme, though without too much enthusiasm, promising to take up the matter with Perkin.8' Perkin also agreed,82 but at the same time proposed to reduce Weizmann's share of his own retainer, insisting once again that Weiz- mann's new appointment at the university had been conditional on his promise not to accept new work, and that Weizmann had violated this agreement by his contract with Fernbach.83 Strange, to whom Weizmann complained, had by now been convinced by Fernbach that Weizmann must be retained. Strange tried to prevent Perkin from damaging Weizmann's position at the university and at the same time sought to cut Weizmann down to size. "In my opinion," wrote Strange to Perkin, "we can force your 78. Court of Justice, Strange to Perkin, June 1, 1912. 79. See Weizmann to Vera, May 30, 1912. WL V, p. 307. 80.

When Weizmann, who may have contributed some "scientific stuff" to the paper, heard that Perkin had given credit in his speech only to Francis Edward Matthews and Auguste Fernbach, totally ignoring his assis- tant's pivotal role in the research, he lost his composure. He criticized Perkin openly and demanded to be free of the professor's control while retaining the same share of Perkin's ?1,000 yearly salary, otherwise he would consider himself a free agent.85 By the time Strange's letter of July 3, in which he proposed to tie Weizmann legally to the company, was received by Perkin, it was too late. Furious at his assistant's brashness, Perkin dismissed Weizmann from the Anglo-French team on June 23.86 Strange, who was largely to blame for having pitted the parties against one another to begin with, had belatedly arrived at a radically different assessment of Weizmann from the one he offered seven weeks earlier. I should like to add that in my opinion Weizmann is a valuable member of our group. He is well up in chemical literature, knowing many languages and having valuable connections throughout Europe. He is amazingly industrious and has a quick brain. He is not an accurate experimenter and this, of course, involves repeating his experiments very carefully. On the other hand, I do not think he is untrustworthy. .... Lastly, I am very conscious of the fact that we owe Weizmann a very heavy debt for bringing us in contact with yourself. This reassessment was combined with Strange's concession that "Perkin has done very little actual work.'87 He now proposed, with Perkin's consent, that Weizmann become Fernbach's assistant so that he could continue to collaborate on the fermentation processes.88 The summer and fall of 1912 84.

This time Weizmann too was more cautious than he had been in February 1910 and consulted a law firm before agreeing to any new con- tracts.90 Weizmann took one other precaution and decided that the time had come to consult his senior colleagues at the university, Arthur Schuster, Samuel Alexander, and Ernest Rutherford. It is not clear how much he told them about his scientific work for Strange and Graham, but he did inform them that his personal ties with Perkin were severed. He needed their protec- tion and advice now that Perkin had become his implacable enemy. His friends took his side, of course, while asking him to calm down and maintain cordial relations with Perkin.91 Weizmann continued his work at the univer- sity as if nothing had happened, but the Perkins and the Weizmanns moved in some of the same social circles, which made life in Manchester very uncomfortable. In the close-knit society of Manchester academics, it became quickly known that the Perkins were no longer friendly to the Weizmanns and that it was best not to invite them to the same teas and garden parties.92 Weizmann began to talk about his plans to secure a posi- tion at the Haifa Technicum not only to Ahad Ha'Am, but also to members of the faculty at Manchester. He was also considering applying for vacancies at Oxford, London, and Edinburgh.93 Then, all of a sudden, it was announced at the beginning of December 1912 that Perkin had accepted the Waynflete professorship at Oxford94 and planned to move there at the end 89.

He himself undertook to raise 100,000 marks. 94. The professorship was offered to Perkin on November 23, 1912. Perkin accepted on December 10, 1912. See Oxford University Archives, "Minutes of meetings of electoral boards</page><page sequence="21">WEIZMANN AND THE ELUSIVE MANCHESTER PROFESSORSHIP 235 of the academic year. Perkin's departure for Oxford was a sudden and unexpected move. It is quite likely that it came in the wake of the national publicity surrounding the synthetic rubber and acetone experiments, for which Perkin took all the credit.95 It is clear that Weizmann was surprised by Perkin's move, otherwise he might very well have avoided controversy with the professor at that stage. For a moment, Weizmann deluded himself that he was still the natural successor to Perkin. "It is not impossible," he wrote to Ahad Ha'Am, "that I shall get either Perkin's Chair or the Chair of Biochemistry. I've already been asked in a roundabout way about my Palestinian plans (Schuster and Alexander). For the time being I'm saying nothing, and the question of the appointment is not yet actuelle."96 To be on the safe side, he informed Schuster that he would be prepared to stay at the university for at least five years. Characteristically, he counted his chickens too early. Perkin's chance to pay Weizmann back for his insubordination came sooner than he had expected. For years he had promoted Weizmann through the university ranks, giving him every possible opportunity to advance himself. He had carefully groomed his prot6g6, possibly promising Weizmann that he would succeed him in the chair of organic chemistry; in the process Perkin took out a number of patents with Weizmann.97 Even if we take into account Weiz- mann's tendency to exaggerate his own status, his persistent claim for nine years that he was in line for a professorship may indicate that Perkin gave him good reason to believe it. Instead of showing gratitude and deference, Weizmann had acted in a most disrespectful and insulting manner. Perkin was determined to show his assistant that he could also use his prestige and influence to ruin Weizmann's chances for promotion. He pointed out to the University Council that Weizmann was more interested in money than pure research and that in any case his stay at Manchester was temporary by his own admission and only served as a springboard to a position in Palestine. Why not give the chair, then, to an upright, native Englishman, to his brother-in-law Arthur Lapworth for example?

As soon as Vera passed her exams and Benjy felt better, Weizmann sent them off to Cannes, affording him time to devote himself to the inevitable and painful showdown ahead. Luckily, Weizmann had at his disposal the active support and sound advice of the Schusters, Rutherford, and Alexander. When he told them that he was about to sign a new contract with Strange, they were appalled. Perkin was indeed right; the University Council would view such extensive work outside the academe as being in conflict with Weizmann's university duties. Strange, who had initially thought he could get along without Weizmann's services, now tried to persuade him at all costs to keep the agreement secret: "It is highly undesirable to ask the Council whether you may enter into the agreements. I strongly advise the course of entering into the agreements and saying nothing. . . . It can easily be explained that this is simply a confirmation of the old arrangement in a slightly different form."99 But Weizmann, who only a week earlier thought he could ride on both horses by getting the professorship and also entering into a lucrative indus- trial consultantship, was quickly sobered on both accounts. Perkin could get away with certain improprieties, given his family's prestige and impeccable lineage. Perkin could even hypocritically and shamelessly try to deny others what he sought for himself. It was quite another thing for a Russian immi- grant to step out of line. He would have to renounce all outside employment if he wanted his senior colleagues and friends to work out a compromise with the vice-chancellor. 98. In tracing materials related to the appointment of Perkin's successor, searches were conducted in Manchester in the University Archives, the records of the Organic Chemistry Department, the records of the Faculty of Science, and the University Registrar's Office. The full files of the committee which dealt with the appointment to Perkin's chair are missing. Yet the record shows that at its first meeting the committee heard the views of Perkin and Dixon as to how to proceed in filling the vacancy.

The search committee was constituted on January 8, 1913, and in its first meeting sought the advice of Harold Dixon and William Perkin. It was not at all clear at the outset what was to be done, and the initial suggestion was to advertise the position for a professorship and to appoint both Lapworth and Weizmann as readers. Another suggestion was to appoint only two readers.'00 Weizmann and Lapworth had the same rank in 1913. Lapworth was senior lecturer and assistant director of the inorganic laboratories; Weizmann was senior lecturer and assistant director of the organic labora- tories.101 In February 1913 the committee resolved to write to seven distin- guished chemists in Britain, the United States, and Germany to solicit their opinions on candidates for the position.102 Yet after the answers of all but Professor Richards were duly received, the committee decided to make a permanent appointment to the chair in organic chemistry and not to adver- tise the position, as was customary.'03 The vice-chancellor was asked to write to the following: J. Norman Collie, W. J. Pope, James Walker, J. J. Dobbie, and G. T. Beilby-all of England, and to Theodore William Richards of Harvard University. Harold Dixon was asked to write to Pro- fessor Hermann Emil Fischer, an organic chemist in Berlin who had received the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1902. In its full report to the senate of the university the committee stated: "no useful purpose would be served by an advertisement which necessarily would cause delay and would in the circumstances of this case, have other very serious disadvantages."'04 On May 1 the University Senate resolved that Perkin's brother-in-law was to get the professorship in organic chemistry, while Weizmann would be 100.

Harold Dixon, who was senior even to Perkin in the chemistry depart- ment, was chosen by the University Council to sound out Weizmann on this arrangement before the official decision was communicated to him.'06 Though he had known for some time (through Schuster) what the university would propose,'t7 Weizmann pretended to be surprised and told Dixon that if asked whether he approved of this arrangement his answer was categori- cally no. Dixon left, requesting a firm reply by 2:15, two hours after they met. Weizmann rushed over to the Schusters, and over lunch Arthur Schuster-now wearing the hat of an adviser rather than that of a com- mittee member-approved of Weizmann's reply, which was given to Dixon presumably at the required time: "I cannot afford to reject or accept pro- posals. I shall have to obey the decision of the University. I consider your proposal as wrong in the interests of the University and as an offense to me. It will affect me in such a way, that I shall try to get out of this place as soon as I can." He did not neglect to add that Perkin had cheated him materially and morally and that Dixon was condoning it.108 After the new arrangement was officially announced in May 1913, Weizmann tried to make the best of it-at least publicly.'09 To Vera he wrote that the whole affair smacked of anti-Semitism. o10 On the face of it, it may have indeed seemed that way. Weizmann could not be faulted on his 105. See Minutes of the Senate of the Victoria University of Manchester, May 1913, John Rylands Archives, RA/3/1 (25.9.1912-10.6.1914), MS pp. 123-125: "That Dr. Charles Weizmann be appointed Reader in Bio-Chemistry at a stipend of ?600 per annum, his duties being to give such instruction in Bio-Chemistry and the Chemistry of Colouring Matters as may be required. .... That the appointment be made in the first instance for three years, as from 29th September 1913." See also John Rylands Archives, RA/29/1. 106. When Dixon informed Weizmann of the committee's deliberations, he must have offered Weizmann the position of reader, though in January 1913 it had not yet been decided that Lapworth would get the chair. Thus, it seems that from the outset Weizmann was ruled out as the incumbent of the chair in organic chemistry. 107. See Weizmann to Ahad Ha'Am, December 27, 1912. WL V, p. 332. 108.

He was the last of the entire faculty to do so-on November 13, 1913. See John Rylands Archives, RA/3/4. 110. Weizmann to Vera, January 28, 1913.

He was known as a good teacher and cared about his students, who in turn showed him great respect and even affection."' Moreover by 1913 he had almost fifty publications to his credit. He was known in the department as a brilliant chemist, more promising than Lapworth,12 who had published more than Weizmann, but worked by accumulation of detail rather than by publishing seminal papers."3 In fact, Harold Dixon and William Perkin were among those who in December 1910 had sponsored Weizmann for a fellowship in the Royal Society, obviously because they held him in high esteem. Exactly two years later they turned against him, making sure he would not receive the professorship, which, in turn, made it impossible for him to attain the coveted fellow- ship."I4 Weizmann never got over the loss of the professorship. He consi- dered this to be the most serious setback of his life."5 In the immediate aftermath of Dixon's official proposal he became physically ill and extreme- ly dejected. "If you only knew," he wrote to Vera, "how tired I am of all these 'goyim,' how much of a stranger I feel here, how isolated."'"6 Two days later, in a moment of desperation, he exclaimed: "Ach, Verochka, I wish we could go to Palestine soon and put an end to Galuth in all its forms.""' 111. See, e.g., Weizmann to Vera, July 2, 1909, WL V, pp. 140-141; January 23, 1913, WL V, p. 357; and H. B. Speakman, "Dr. Weizmann's Contributions to Microbiology," in Chaim Weizmann (see note 21), pp. 265-266. 112. In 1913 both had roughly the same status in the department. Weizmann had slight seniority, since he had been appointed senior lecturer in 1907, while Lapworth was appointed in 1909. See Senate minutes of April 23, 1912. RA/3/4, 1912-1913. 113. See Dictionary of Scientific Biography (1981), vol. 8, p. 32. There is, of course, no agreement on who deserved the professorship. Lapworth's student-George Norman Burk- hardt-has a different view on the merits of the case. According to Burkhardt, Weizmann's choice of topics for research was determined more "by commercial rather than scientific consi- derations. In 1913 he was only beginning to establish himself" in biochemistry. Lapworth, on the other hand, "had done notable work in the structural organic chemistry of camphor and related compounds. His general report was regarded as a classic. But it was his work on the formation and decomposition of cyanohydrins of ketones and on the bromination of acetone ... that was recognized as one of the foundations of a new branch of chemistry (physical organic)." Yet even Burkhardt admits that much of Lapworth's work could not-by 1913-be thought of as being relevant to a chair of organic chemistry. Information provided by G. N. Burkhardt in November 1982. See also G. N. Burkhardt, "Prof. A. Lapworth, F.R.S.," Nature 147 (June 21, 1941): 769. 114. Weizmann was unable to become an FRS despite the fact that Arthur Schuster was the secretary of the society from 1912 to 1919. It is more than likely that Perkin withdrew his backing for Weizmann for an FRS. 115. See Weizmann to Vera, February 1, 1913, WL V, p. 369, and Weizmann, Trial and Error, pp. 134-135. 116.

The simple truth is that all parties involved in this messy affair - Weizmann included - were guilty of only two things: greed and vanity. Perhaps Perkin was the worst offender, because he received a large retainer from Strange and Graham, reaping financial and professional benefits without doing any of the work and using Weizmann without giving him due credit. It is possible that had Weizmann received recognition for his fermen- tation experiments, he would have had a better chance to attain the profes- sorship. Moreover, Perkin was willing to go so far as to read a purposely misleading scientific paper, written by others, in order to promote a commercial enterprise. Lastly, when faced with the possibility of a challenge which would have exposed his dishonesty in scientific matters, he attributed to Weizmann those offenses of which he was most guilty. But it was only a question of degree of guilt. Fernbach had knowingly contributed his prestige to an enterprise he knew would defraud the public. Weizmann was through- out guilty by association and by his omission to call his colleagues to task or expose them publicly. He too, like Perkin, had worked on projects which he knew were against university rules. He was willing, as late as December 1912, to repeat this mistake, and it was only thanks to Schuster, Alexander, and Rutherford that he severed his association with Strange and Graham at the last moment. What helped undermine Weizmann's chances for the professorship, then, was not anti-Semitism. Perkin would, no doubt, have continued to favor him as his successor had Weizmann not challenged Perkin's reputation and financial arrangements; given Perkin's great influence at the university, he might have been able to arrange for Weiz- mann to attain the professorship. Weizmann's attempt to exploit his own indispensability in the Anglo-French research group by presenting the pro- fessor with an ultimatum backfired when Perkin refused to be blackmailed. In his anxiety to break out of his own financial straits, Weizmann forfeited not only the new deal with Strange and Fernbach but also his old contract with' Perkin. He had lost not only a second income but his status in the department as Perkin's prot6ge and heir-apparent. The fact of the matter is that Weizmann was guilty not only of greed and disloyalty to his benefactor, but also of impatience and lack of sound political judgment. This, in the final analysis, contributed to his undoing. Clearly, the procedures for filling Perkin's chair were highly irregular, most notably the decision not to advertise the position. In his letters to emineni chemists in Britain, Germany, and the United States, the vice-</page><page sequence="27">WEIZMANN AND THE ELUSIVE MANCHESTER PROFESSORSHIP 241 chancellor listed the names of candidates other than Weizmann and Lapworth, yet it is obvious from reading the committee's and the senate's minutes that these other candidates were never seriously considered as incumbents of the chair in organic chemistry."8 The irregularities in this particular case are all the more striking when one examines the other appointments made that year by the university's senate. None of these appointments to professorships involved the same type of special committee that was constituted to deal with the chair of organic chemistry, and in none did the vice-chancellor of the university take so active a role as in this case. None of the committees asked for or received permission to deal with departmental matters other than recommending a candidate for the chair. None of the committees asked for permission not to advertise, and none even considered not filling the professorship in question and instead making "special arrangements." All the other committees seemed to seriously con- sider candidates from within and without the university."' In light of the reference in the report of the Committee on Arrangements Consequent on Professor Perkin's Resignation to "the [special] circumstances of this case," one must arrive at the conclusion that the committee's decisions were strongly influenced by political considerations. But what of the intellectual and academic merits of the case. Did Weizmann deserve the professorship on his own merits? Was he a better candidate for the position than Lapworth? Was perhaps neither appropriate for such a position at this stage in their career? It is unlikely that a clear-cut and decisive answer could ever be given to all of these questions; this is a particularly difficult task seven decades after the fact. Yet the evidence seems to suggest that even without the irregularities associated with Lapworth's appointment, Weizmann would not necessarily have been awarded the professorship at this stage in his career, even if Perkin had strongly backed such an appointment. The most decisive extant evidence for this assertion is contained in the correspondence between the vice- chancellor of the Victoria University of Manchester, Sir Alfred Hopkinson, and Professor Theodore Williams Richards, the Erving Professor of Chemistry at Harvard and director of the Wolcott Gibbs Memorial Labora- 118.

Hopkinson's letter to Richards of February 18, 1913, reads as follows: Dear Professor Richards, As you are no doubt aware Professor Perkin has been appointed to the Chair of Chemistry in the University of Oxford and will shortly be leaving Manchester. We are now making enquiries with a view to the arrangements to be made here in consequence of his resignation. It is of vital importance to us, having regard to the extent of the Chemical Department, the number of students to be trained and the continuance and promotion of research in Chemistry, that we should secure the best men available to carry on the work, and I have been asked by the Committee of Senate which has the matter under consideration, to make confidential enquiries with a view to obtaining the best information. Among the younger organic chemists of distinction the following have been mentioned as men of special ability and promise: Dr. A. W. Crossley, F.R.S., Professor of Chemistry in the Pharmaceutical Society. Dr. M. O. Forster, F.R.S., Assistant-Professor at the Imperial College of Science. Dr. A. McKenzie, Birkbeck Institute. Dr. R. H. Pickard, Technical School, Blackburn. Dr. R. Robinson, Professor of Organic Chemistry in the University of Sydney, N.S.W. Dr. Smiles, Assistant Professor of Organic Chemistry, University College, London. Dr. J. Thorpe, F.R.S., Sorby Fellow, University of Sheffield. We have also before us the names of two chemists now on our Senior Staff: -Dr. Lapworth, F.R.S., Lecturer in Physical Chemistry and Assistant Direc- tor of the Inorganic Laboratories, and Dr. Weizmann, Lecturer in Bio- Chemistry and Assistant Director of the Organic Laboratories. 120. Richards was one of the most eminent chemists in the United States. In 1914 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry, the first chemist in the United States to be so honored.

My dear Sir Alfred: Your kind letter came two or three days ago, and I have been thinking about it ever since. It seems to me that you have named the candidates about in the order desirable. Dr. Crossley and Dr. Forster are both able men and known all over the world, and of the two I should be inclined to put Dr. Crossley first as you have. Next, I should be inclined to put Dr. Lapworth and next Dr. McKenzie. The others I know little about, for my specialty is not organic chemistry, as you know. ... Among the young Americans Professor Brunel, now of Bryn Mawr, seems to be considered as perhaps the most brilliant. He has not a reptutation, however, comparable to that of Dr. Crossley or Dr. Forster.... . .. I find that our resident professor of organic chemistry E[lmer] P[eter] Kohler agrees essentially with me in the order of preference named above... .122 One must keep in mind that Richards was best known for his atomic weight studies, and it is not surprising that he was more likely to hear of Lapworth-a physical chemist-than of Weizmann. Yet Crossley and Forster, whom he held in high esteem, were organic chemists, i.e., outside his own specialty. Clearly Richards had no knowledge of Weizmann's work, though he had visited Manchester a few years earlier and had an honorary degree from the university. Moreover, Richards's colleague, Kohler, who 121. Alfred Hopkinson to T. W. Richards, February 18, 1913. Harvard University Archives, HUG/1743/1/6 (1912-1913), Box 1.

Theodore William Richards to Alfred Hopkinson, March 7, 1913. Harvard University Archives, HUG/1743/1/6 (1912-1913), Box 1. On May 22, 1913, Hopkinson informed Richards of the decisions concerning Lapworth and Weizmann. See Harvard University Archives, HUG/1743/1/5 (1911-1913), Box 5; a copy of Hopkinson's reply is also contained in the Vice-Chancellor's Letter Book, John Rylands Archives, VCA, no. 5.</page><page sequence="30">244 JEHUDA REINHARZ was an organic chemist, also did not rank Weizmann among the top candi- dates. Weizmann had not at that stage made significant theoretical break- throughs. He had been working in the new field of biochemistry for only two years and had not yet made any major contributions in that field. Those he did make were claimed by Perkin as his own. Yet, even assuming that Weizmann was not the undisputed candidate for the position, one must conclude that the appointment was handled in a strange way by the University Senate. It had decided to give the chair in organic chemistry to a man who was clearly an inorganic chemist (in 1922 Lapworth officially assumed responsibility for inorganic chemistry and was succeeded by Robert Robinson, who had appeared on the vice-chancellor's list in February 1913), while appointing Weizmann reader in biochemistry -a field in which he had not yet distinguished himself. The explanation for this may be fourfold. Weizmann's appointment to the professorship- merit apart-would have been a direct insult to Perkin, one of England's more distinguished chemists. Possibly the council was also angered by Weiz- mann's extensive outside chemical work, which went against his agreement with the university. Weizmann had not yet attained a fellowship in the Royal Society. Lastly, there were political motivations underlying the appointment which are not explicit in the extant minutes of the committee. Obviously the university was trying to avoid embarrassment and a possible scandal, but it is not clear what factors were at play here. Whatever the reason, the committee and the senate acted in an unusual manner by failing to advertise the position, as was customary. Clearly they wished to retain Weizmann, but not at any price. From the outset he never had a real chance to succeed Perkin in the chair of organic chemistry, since it was decided already in January 1913 that he would be appointed reader. Whether Lapworth was indeed the strongest candidate for the chair is doubtful, but it is impossible to answer this question with absolute certainty in view of the missing documentation on the other candidates and the availability of only one reply from the eminent chemists who had been approached. On the face of it, it seems that Lapworth's appointment to a chair-any chair-was premature. As for Weizmann, attaining a readership at this stage in his career was a respectable achievement which was marred only by Weiz- mann's unrealistic expectations, fanned for years by Perkin. Nevertheless, Lapworth's appointment to a chair seems to indicate that had Weizmann been able to have Perkin's backing, he too would have been a viable candi- date for the position. Thus Weizmann failed to attain the professorship</page><page sequence="31">WEIZMANN AND THE ELUSIVE MANCHESTER PROFESSORSHIP 245 because his scholarship was not perceived as clearly superior, and because he had alienated his strongest potential supporter. Weizmann's loss of the professorship gnawed at him for the rest of his life. By nature driven to high achievement, Weizmann aspired to reach the highest rungs of the academic ladder both for the sake of financial rewards and for the prestige such a position automatically bestowed in so status- conscious a country as England. By temperament nervous and impatient, he had coveted this position for years and often spoke of its attainment as afait accompli. Remarkably, he listed himself as "professor" in Manchester's phone directory as early as 1908.123 Paradoxically, his and Vera's eagerness to become rich and famous led him to try to manipulate some of his col- leagues and to make unsound judgments which undermined his chances to attain either goal. Weizmann's drive for formal recognition as a scientist was also indirect- ly linked to his Zionist activity. Weizmann believed he could be more useful to the Zionist movement if he gained a reputation as a first-rate scientist. But he probably never imagined that he would be able to harness science in the service of politics as effectively and directly as he did. The opportunity presented itself during the First World War.124 Like Herzl, who gained access to the upper reaches of international diplomacy by virtue of his reputation as a journalist, Weizmann was eventually to gain entry to the same domain by virtue of his scientific achievements. On the eve of the First World War Weizmann did not yet possess the Zionist credentials to be seen as the movement's spokesman.,25 Moreover, though a naturalized citizen, he was perceived as a foreigner in British society and had not attained the kind of standing which a professorship or a fellowship in the Royal Society would have granted him. His major personal resources were his contacts with the Rothschild family and with the aca- demic community, including the Round Table group, and, of course, his scientific ability. Two years after the outbreak of the war, however, Weiz- mann had a preeminent status within the Zionist movement. That accom- plishment was linked to Weizmann's administrative, social, and scientific 123. See Kelly's Directory of Manchester, 1908. Central Library, Manchester. 124.

This, in turn, propelled him to the inside of British power-brokering. Thus, despite his lack of good judgment in dealing with his colleagues in 1910-1912 and the mistakes he made which contributed to the loss of the professorship, Weizmann did eventually become financially independent. Though he was not adequately compensated for his services to the British government, Weizmann's war work afforded him the opportunity for testing his chemical inventions on a scale hitherto unknown. As a result, with the coming of peace, he was able to sell his processes to U.S. industries involved in automobile manufacture. His income was henceforth permanently assured.
