<plain_text><page sequence="1">Daniel Friedmann. To Kill and Take Possession: Law, Morality, and Society in Biblical Stories. Peabody, MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 2003. xiii, 327 pp. This volume takes a very different approach to biblical narrative, law, and society. In many ways, it is a treatise on comparative mythology, on comparative legal practice and attitudes. The author, Daniel Friedmann, is very forthcoming, saying that he does not intend "to tackle the immensity of scholarly literature in the field." Instead, his intent is to "infer from the biblical stories the legal and moral concepts they reflect and the system of laws underlying them, which seems not to conform with many of the laws of the Pentateuch" (vii). There are only a few references to modem scholarship (all in footnotes-no bibliography of works cited); most of Friedmann's discussion is bolstered by references to Rashi, Maimonides, the Talmud, and other rabbinical commentaries. There is no attempt to interact with modem critical approaches to biblical interpretation, and there is no regard for current discussions of "maximalist" or "minimalist" dating and editing of the text. Among the stories he draws on extensively are the confrontation between Judah and Tamar (Genesis 38), the interaction between Ruth and Boaz, the theft by Achan of a portion of the loot taken from the sacking of Jericho (Joshua 8), and various episodes in the stories of Saul and David (in particular, the issue of legitimacy). In his examination of these stories, Friedmann employs a very anec- dotal style, jumping from one body of literature and time period to another. He treats biblical stories as social dramas that serve as a model for how to cope with the dangers and calamities of life (12). Law, as it appears in the stories, is therefore a device for moving the story along rather than a binding statute that requires certain behaviors or forbids others. In his discussion of the use of the Urim and Thummim or the casting of lots in various stories (Achan, Jonathan, and Jonah), Friedmann describes a "binary method of eliciting responses from the deity" as a way of demonstrating to the people that justice or the designation of culprits is ultimately a divine decision. In this way, for example, the deposing of Saul can be described as God's decision rather than any action taken by Samuel or David (159). Friedmann's analysis of this form of divine discernment, however, tends to consist of long, rambling discourse on various forms of ordeal employed not only in biblical accounts (Numbers 5) but also in African village culture (his reference here to "anthro- pological studies" on witchcraft is based on a 1923 account), in the story of the twelfth-century scholar Anselm, in Hammurabi's code, and in the various forms 197</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews of combat and physical ordeals used during the Middle Ages (14-23). Curiously, he also includes a postscript at the end of most of the chapters that draws on modem forms of justice or legal practice (i.e., lie detection and how it relates to modem jurisprudence in Israel; 29-31). In the chapter dealing with "stories of disguise," Friedmann again astonishes when he plays on themes originally articulated by James Frazer in 1923 on the struggle between brothers for supremacy as he muses over the lentil stew transaction between Jacob and Esau, one that he notes would be termed an "unconscionable bargain" in modem legal parlance because of its intent to exploit the other party's weakness (49-51). He continues to fluctuate in his discussion, noting how modem legal parlance would react to the situation and then going on to explain that the bib- lical author may be playing on the understanding that despite Jacob's gaining the blessing by trickery, "God knew it was Jacob," and therefore the blessing is valid (55). Similarly, in his examination of stories dealing with cases of fraud (such as Abram's deception of Pharaoh in Genesis 12 or the deceitful prophet in 1 Kings 13), he attempts to find some justification for why the biblical characters act or are portrayed as acting in immoral ways and finally draws the conclusion that "subter- fuge was always considered legitimate in struggles between nations" (66). A similarly winding legal discourse is followed in the chapter on Saul's execution of the priests at Nob. Friedmann holds that the explanation for Saul's action can be found in the "concept of responsibility and contagious guilt that existed when the book of Samuel was written" (128). This leads him into a discus- sion of "uncleanness" that has passed down through the generations (examples include the Amalekites and a child born of adultery) and collective responsibility (Achan's family, Saul's seven sons). In the following chapter on Saul's demise, Friedmann traces a path through the text, occasionally referring to attempts made in the aggadah to justify David's rise to power but coming at last to a rea- listic assessment of the political situation in which Saul fell victim to the tensions created by the "separation of the political-military authority from the religious authority" (164). Friedmann's analysis of the transformation of prophetic message is the most helpful portion of this volume. He concludes that the historical reality of Israel and Judah's situation transformed the "simplistic model" that equated observance with abundance into a new model of a "causal link between observance or violation and reality, suggesting that repentance may win a reprieve" (186). Even this had to be modified in light of further disasters and a "theory of the end of days" (with a shift from adherence to ritual to moral admonition) and a transformation of God's role in warfare that became more evident in the later prophets. The final section of the volume deals with the status of women and their legal standing within the Israelite community. A large portion of this discussion is centered on the patriarchal narratives, which are not the best model for an exam- ination of gender issues because they do not reflect the urban-based communities of the monarchy and postexilic periods. Similarly, the long discourse on levirate marriage and incest customs draws out the cultural incongruencies between the Genesis account of Judah and Tamar and prohibitions of the postexilic Holiness Code in Leviticus. 198</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Although there are some interesting and quite challenging analyses in this volume, on the whole, it is difficult to follow. The constant shifts from one story to another, the interspersing of comments on modem legal practice, and the lack of systematic attention to scholarly treatments of this material diminish its overall usefulness.
