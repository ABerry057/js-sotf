<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FIRST CHARTER OF THE JEWISH MERCHANTS OF VENICE, 1589 By BENJAMIN C. I. RAVID Brandeis University The role of the Jews in the European economy, especially as money- lenders, traders, and taxpayers, is often assumed rather than investigated and analyzed. Fortunately, however, some information is available re- garding the activities of Jewish merchants in the overseas commerce of the Italian port cities in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.1 This article This article constitutes a greatly condensed presentation of an important aspect of my monograph, currently in preparation, on the Jewish merchants of Venice, where further details and documentation will be provided. In the interim, see the precis of my Ph.D. thesis in the Journal of Economic History, XXXV (1975), 274-279, and the discussion on pp. 289, 295, and also Ravid, "Economics and Toleration in Seventeenth Century Venice: The Background and Context of the Discorso of Simone Luzzatto," to appear in Volume XLIV of the Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research. I wish to express my gratitude to the Director and staff of the Archivio di Stato di Venezia, and especially to Signorina Lina Frizziero, for providing me with the re- quested microfilms; to the National Foundation for Jewish Culture and the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture for grants during the academic year 1972-73; to Prof. Isadore Twersky of Harvard University, for his sage counsel and strong sup- port; and to Prof. Frank Talmage for many acts of kindness far transcending his formal responsibilities as editor of this Review. 1.

This charter, and its subsequent renewals down to the end of the republic (1797), constituted the only major long-term departure from the traditional medieval Venetian protectivist commercial policy, as the Venetian government struggled to maintain both the entrepot function of the port and its customs revenue in the face of the new and unfavorable commercial developments of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. I Although Jewish merchants were already a factor in Venetian overseas trade in the late fourteenth century,2 they apparently became prominent only in the early sixteenth century as a result of events occurring at opposite ends of the Mediterranean. Many of the Jews who had been expelled from Spain in 1492, and also some of those who had later been forcibly converted to Christianity in Portugal in 1497 and had subsequently chosen to flee the Iberian peninsula, found a refuge in the Ottoman Empire. There, they soon assumed a preponderant role in its overseas commerce, especially in the cities of Constantinople and Salonica. Now Ottoman subjects, some Jewish merchants began returning to the ports of Chris- tian Europe, including Venice, where they availed themselves of the privileges granted to Ottoman subjects, making them the only non-Ven- etians permitted by Venetian law to engage in trade between Venice and the Levant. Meanwhile, a new Jewish settlement in Venice had commenced in 1509 when many inhabitants of the terra-firma, including the wealthy Jewish money-lenders of Mestre, sought refuge from the invading armies of the League of Cambrai.3 Initially, the government was disturbed by their 2. In a study entitled "The Jewish Mercantile Settlement of Twelfth and Thir- teenth Century Venice: Reality or Conjecture," now being submitted for publication, I have shown that the evidence adduced to support the presence of Jewish merchants in Venice, and also their residence in the city, does not withstand critical scrutiny. 3. On the settlement of the Jewish moneylenders in Venice in 1509 and their legal status and economic activities down to 1618, see the wealth of information contained in B. Pullan, Rich and Poor in Renaissance Venice (Cambridge, 1971), pp. 476-578, which completely supersedes all previous presentations. In a forthcoming study, now</page><page sequence="3">BENJAMIN C. I.

However, financially hard pressed, it realized that their residence could be very beneficial, for they could aid the treasury by providing stipulated annual payments and additional sums as needed, and also serve the populace better by operat- ing loan-banks in the city itself. But the original opposition still persisted, and the continual presence of numerous Jews in the city aroused much resentment. In 1516 a compromise was reached: all the Jews currently in the city, and all those who were to come in the future, were to reside segregated behind walls in the area known as the ghetto nuovo, thereby giving a new meaning to the word ghetto, previously used to refer to an iron foundry on that site. Soon a system of charters (condotte) evolved, authorizing these Jews to live in the city for five-year periods and engage in moneylending and the sale of second-hand goods (strazzaria) under carefully stipulated terms. To differentiate them from other Jews, they were often referred to as Tedeschi Jews, because many of them ultimately originated in the Germanic lands to the north, even though they and their forefathers had lived under Venetian rule in the cities and towns of the terra-firma for decades or even generations. Their presence in Venice had two positive consequences for the Jewish merchants. First, it made visiting and sojourning in Venice more attractive since coreligionists already re- sided there, and second, the Venetian government, having already per- mitted some Jews to dwell in the city, was more willing to acquiesce in the presence of the merchants on the condition that they lodged, along with the moneylenders, in the ghetto nuovo. Little is known about the activities of the merchants prior to 1541.' Apparently, they were generally not molested, but when in 1537 war broke out between Venice and the Ottoman Empire, the Venetian Senate ordered the sequestration of the property of "Turks, Jews and other in preparation, I plan to analyze the "expulsion" of the Jewish moneylenders from Venice in 1571 (i.e., the non-renewal of the expiring charter of 1566) in the light of the negotiations over the issuance of the previous charters of the Jewish money- lenders of Venice. 4. Jewish merchants must have been active on the Venetian scene by 1519, since Marino Sanuto in his Diarii, 58 vols. (Venice, 1879-1903), XXVIII, column 63, related that "our countrymen have never wanted Jews to keep shops to trade in this city, but to buy and sell and go away again," quoted in English translation in Pullan, Rich and Poor, p. 495. Subsequently, a Senate decree of 1527 referred to grain imported by "Greeks, Jews and Turks," Archivio di Stato di Venezia (hence- forth ASV), Senate, Mar, reg. 21, 78r-v, August 28, 1527.</page><page sequence="4">190 JEWISH MERCHANTS OF VENICE Turkish subjects," and required the merchants to post bond;5 presumably, with the termination of hostilities, their property was restored. II A major change in the status of the visiting Jewish merchants occurred in 1541. The Venetian Senate, concerned with the decline in trade with Romania, the former European territories of the Byzantine empire now under the rule of the Ottoman Turks, eliminated for two years the customs duties on many imports originating in Romania, and correspondingly on those imports from the west exchanged for the eastern goods, hoping thereby to maintain successfully the threatened entrepot nature of the Venetian marketplace, especially against the competition of Ancona. This customs exemption law of 1541 contained a passage dealing with the Jewish Levantine merchants, singling them out, apparently for the first time, as a specific group. Asserting that the greater part of the imports from Romania was brought to the city by these merchants, it noted that they had requested that they be granted additional room for their lodging, since they did not have space to live in the existing ghetto because of its narrowness. It then stated that their complaint was to be investigated, and if found valid, they were to be housed in the adjacent area known as the ghetto vecchio "so that they shall have greater reason to come to the city to its advantage" with, however, permission to engage only in overseas trade. The subsequent investigation confirmed the complaint of the merchants, and consequently they were allowed to reside segregated in the ghetto vecchio, after its Christian inhabitants had been relocated, with the added restrictions that they neither bring their families with them, nor stay in the city continually for longer than four months. A few weeks later, however, the merchants requested from the College, which had been given jurisdiction in the matter by the Senate, permission to stay in the city for longer than four months, presumably in order to complete their business transactions. The College, by the vote of eighteen to four, acquiesced, and extended their permitted period of residence to two years, the same length of time as that for which the customs duties had been lifted. Some dissenting members of the College attempted to persuade 5. ASV, Senate, Mar, reg. 24, 69r, September 15, 1537.</page><page sequence="5">BENJAMIN C. I. RAVID 191 the Senate to reverse this extension, but the Senate sustained it by a sub- stantial majority. Thus, the role of the Jewish Levantine merchants in the Venetian marketplace was officially recognized." The customs exemption proved successful in increasing the commerce of Venice, and therefore was renewed by the Senate in 1543, 1545, and 1547, without any reference to the Jews. However, the renewal of 1549 included the provision that "it is not intended by this extension that the Jews dwell in this city for two years, but they may remain for one year only, and not more, and this is because of the many bad acts that have been committed by the Jews on account of the length of their stay." 7 When the customs exemption was renewed for two more years in 1551, it was again stipulated that the Jews could only remain in the city for one year, and a similar provision was contained in the next renewal of 1553. However, the renewals of 1555 and subsequent years made no mention of the Jews. Nevertheless, de facto, the Venetian government tolerated the continual presence of the Jewish merchants, even with their families, in Venice as resident aliens. Presumably this reflected a compromise between those who wished to authorize formally the presence of the Jewish merchants, because of the positive role they played in augmenting the customs revenue and maintaining the entrepot function of the city, even though that activity might be to a certain undetermined and undeterminable extent at the expense of some individual native merchants, and, on the other hand, those who wished to eliminate the presence of the Jews for either religious or commercial reasons. Despite this ambivalence, only once were the persons and property of the merchants in real jeopardy, and this resulted from their being Ottoman subjects, rather than from their being members of the Jewish religion. In 1570 the long-threatening war between Venice and the Ottoman Empire broke out. After hearing that the Venetian mer- chants in Constantinople had been arrested, the Venetian Senate retaliated in March 1570 by ordering the detention of all Turks, Levantine Jews, 6. For a detailed account of these events in 1541, revising the accepted view that the Jewish merchants were not required to live in a ghetto until 1541 (see, e.g., Roth, [The Jewish Community of] Venice [Philadelphia, 1930], p. 61; Roth, History of the Jews of Italy [Philadelphia, 1946], p. 186), or even 1589 (see A. Milano, Storia degli Ebrei in Italia [Turin, 1963], pp. 279-80, apparently contradicted on p. 525 regarding the Ponentine merchants), see Ravid, "The Establishment of the Ghetto Vecchio of Venice, 1541: Background and Reappraisal," to be published in the Proceedings of the Sixth World Congress of Jewish Studies, Jerusalem, 1973; also Pullan, Rich and Poor, p. 512. 7.

This petition, as was customary with all petitions of the Jewish merchants, was passed on to the Board of Trade (Cinque Savi alla Mercanzia), which in a report (risposta) submitted on March 20, 1574 responded noncommit- tally that the request concerned matters of state which were not within its jurisdiction.'0 III The relationship between impersonal long-term forces and the action of individuals in determining the course of events will in many cases remain a subject of speculation. However, it can safely be asserted that the personal endeavors of a single Jewish merchant, presumably of Iberian origin, named Daniel Rodriga, played a decisive role in securing a charter for the Jewish merchants in Venice. 11 Early in 1577 Rodriga submitted to the Venetian government a pro- posal to establish a port on Venetian-held land at Spalato (modern Split) 8.

RAVID 193 on the Dalmatian coast.2 The intention behind this project was to enhance the competitive position of Venice by diverting the overland trade of Dalmatia away from Ragusa (modern Dubrovnik), from where it often went to Ancona, the chief Adriatic rival of Venice, and also to assure the greater safety of shipping by shortening the sea-route to Venice in the dangerous pirate-infested northern Adriatic waters. Promising great benefits to Venetian commerce, the city, and its residents, Rodriga expressed his willingness to make all the necessary arrangements in return for four concessions. One of these was the granting of privileges he had previously sought for "all merchants of whatever nation" living in the city with their families. Unfortunately, I have so far been unable to locate further infor- mation regarding those privileges; although apparently not intended ex- clusively for Jewish merchants, presumably Rodriga had primarily them in mind. Whatever the specific nature of the privileges, he had grounds for hoping that his petition would be favorably received. First, the Jews were playing an increasingly significant role in Venetian commerce with the Levant. Second, the Jews were very active in the trade of Dalmatia, and the simultaneous establishment of a Venetian port in Spalato and the granting of privileges to foreign merchants, including Jews, would en- courage them to intensify their commercial ties with Venice. Finally, pre- cedents had been established for the granting of charters to foreign mer- chants, especially Jews and even Marranos, in other Italian cities. The city of Ancona had granted Jewish and Marrano merchants liberal privileges in 1549, and these terms had been confirmed by Pope Julius III in 1552. Florence had taken similar measures in 1548 and 1551, as had Savoy in 1572.' Thus Rodriga was merely requesting that Venice take steps similar to those already undertaken elsewhere. However, the Board, to which the request of Rodriga was referred, did not consider itself competent to rule on the matter, and Senate legislation of October 28, 1577, authorizing the implementation, with certain modifications, of Rodriga's Spalato project, contained no provision granting privileges to foreign merchants." The negative reaction of the Venetian government was understandable. 12. ASV, Senate, Mar, filza 69, October 28, 1577. 13.

The ports of Ancona, Pisa-Livorno, and Savoy might have needed the help of foreign merchants to sustain their commercial life, but Venice had a long and successful native mercantile tradition, and was at this stage unwilling to make extensive and unprecedented concessions that ran counter to its traditional protectivist policies. Despite his rebuff in 1577, two years later Rodriga tried to secure rights specifically for Jewish merchants in Venice. In a petition submitted some time prior to June 21, 1579, he requested permission to bring to the city up to fifty families of Jewish merchants, each of whom would pay over a hundred ducats annually in customs duties. To assure their tranquillity, he requested that these merchants receive those privileges already possessed by the visiting Jewish merchants and the resident Jewish moneylenders. They were to be subject only to the payment of the customs duties, and ex- empt from all other impositions and liabilities, and in case of war to enjoy the security of their persons and property as Venetian subjects. As prece- dent and justification, Rodriga pointed out that the government had granted such security to the Jewish moneylenders who brought less benefit to the treasury than would these merchants, who if given the sought-for privileges would be of enormous benefit to the marketplace and provide great profit and satisfaction to the government. The Board responded by de- ciding, in a report dated August 8, 1579, to defer the consideration of the request to another time, because of its complexity and implications.'5 About four years later, sometime before November 26, 1583, Rodriga tried again to secure residence privileges in Venice for the Jewish mer- chants. Although the text of this petition has not yet been located, its contents can be reconstructed from the summary in the report of the Board. Rodriga, according to the Board, asked that "privileges be granted to the Levantine and Ponentine Jews, enabling them to live securely in the city with their families." Additionally, he apparently appended to his petition a list of specific provisions.'G Of special significance was the fact that here for the first time Ponentine Jews (i.e., Jews from the Iberian peninsula) in contrast to the Levantine Jews from the Ottoman empire, 15.

RAVID 195 were explicitly mentioned, although no doubt many of the Jews coming to Venice from the Levant were really originally of Ponentine origin. Rodriga was now not merely requesting the Venetians to grant residence privileges in Venice to Levantine Jewish merchants, but also explicitly to individuals who had lived as Christians in the Iberian peninsula. It was already very well known for decades that Marranos were departing from the Iberian peninsula to Italy, and then, after reverting to Judaism, either remained there or moved on to the safer haven of Turkey. It was also common knowledge that many of these Marranos selected Venice as their place of residence or transit. The city was especially attractive for several reasons. Since it was a major port, with ships frequently leaving for the Ottoman Empire, it served as a convenient point of embarkation for the east. Also, ghetti had already been established in Venice, and the Venetian authorities appeared to be relatively unconcerned with the phe- nomenon of Marranos returning to Judaism, as long as they lived behind ghetto walls and obeyed all the laws and restrictions imposed upon the Jews. Although the papal representatives objected to this leniency, the Venetians, loyally Catholic but opposed to the papal claims to jurisdiction in Venice and severely limiting the power of the papal inquisition, did not change their attitude. Only once in the sixteenth century, in 1550, was action taken against the Marranos in Venice, in the form of an edict of expulsion, and that turned out to be more of a scare than a turning point in Venetian policy. Furthermore, that expulsion did not affect Jews or former Marranos who had reverted to Judaism and were living in the ghetto, but only those Marranos who, remaining outwardly Christians, lived anywhere they pleased in the city.'7 In the light of this complex and ambivalent attitude and the declining fortunes of Venetian trade, Rodriga had grounds for hoping that his pro- posal would be accepted. However, the report of the Board was to dash these hopes. It related that the Board had carefully considered the petition of Rodriga and his proposals, since they were of the greatest importance, and had examined the legislation on the subject and made various inquiries and consultations. It had finally concluded that accepting his request would 17. The texts have been published by D.

Although conceding that the customs revenues might increase on the basis of an expanding volume of trade, the Board nevertheless deemed it against the public and private interests to grant the request. In conclusion, it related that previously the Levantine Jews had been allowed to live in the city for only one year, and originally even for not longer than four months, with certain other restrictions, and recommended that these laws be now enforced.'8 While the general position of the Venetian government had been not to grant the Jewish Levantine merchants any specific privileges, it had, as noted, tacitly tolerated their continued presence without any legal authorization. This report of the Board expressed an unusual hostility toward the Jews. While stressing the four-months and one-year residence arrangements, it did not mention the two-year permission. In short, it constituted an extremely firm reiteration of the earlier Venetian commercial attitude toward the Jews, reflecting also the fear of the Jewish competitor at a time when, as it admitted, the Venetian merchants were facing in- creasing difficulties in their commercial enterprises. In conceding that granting the Jews privileges would lead to an increase in the customs revenues, and then proceeding to assert that the harm resulting to native merchants would outweigh this benefit, the Board was departing from its usual viewpoint that increased customs revenues resulting from an upswing in trade led to a prosperity which rippled throughout the entire economy. It seems most likely that the five members of the Board were themselves merchants, or members of merchant families, whose activities were threatened by new commercial developments beyond their control and under the circumstances blamed their plight on the Jews. The absence of any reference to Rodriga's request that Ponentine Jews (i.e., Marranos) be allowed to live in Venice as Jews would indicate that the opposition of the Board was primarily economic in nature, even though its members may not have been favorably disposed to the Jews in general. Rodriga remained undaunted. In the following year, 1584, he made yet another attempt to obtain privileges for the Jewish Levantine merchants. This time he apparently requested that at least those who were married 18. ASV, CSM, reg. 137, 96v-97v, November 26, 1583.</page><page sequence="11">BENJAMIN C. I. RAVID 197 and living in Venice without any authorization be granted the safe-conduct requested on previous occasions. This would, presumably, among other things, assure them of security for themselves, their families, and their property at all times throughout the Venetian state.19 The five members of the Board had been routinely replaced by new ones, and perhaps this change had encouraged Rodriga to try once more, albeit with a slightly more modest request. The Board, in a report of December 18, 1584,20 asserted that the matter was of great importance and therefore it had consulted previous legislation on the Jews. This report, after summarizing the legislation of 1541 and the subsequent renewal of the customs exemption, related that "it can easily be seen that since 1541, which was the beginning of the habitation of the Jews for two years, reduced to one year in 1551 [correctly, 1549], until the present they have been permitted tacitly to continue their residence in this city, and for this reason diverse merchandise has been brought by them from those countries to the greatest benefit of the customs and trade." The report bolstered this point by citing figures, one of the only too rare sets of statistics which allow a quantitative glimpse of the Jewish contribution to the customs. It additionally noted that in the past, the Board had not only employed all possible diligence to assure that merchandise was brought to the city, reducing the customs to achieve this aim, but also had made all suitable provisions for the Jews "with no concern for any other con- siderations that could be related in this matter." Nevertheless, the Board concluded that it was at present unable to reach a decision on the request of Rodriga, and therefore decided to defer its recommendation. It is reasonable to assume that the new Board was aware of the report of the previous year, but having a more favorable attitude, treated the Jewish question from a different perspective. Rather than emphasize the formal legal restrictions, it placed the presence of the Jewish merchants in the much wider context of their role in the Venetian economy. Signifi- cantly, it did not seem to have any basic objection to granting the privileges sought by Rodriga; it did not reject them, or say that it was not competent to deal with the matter, as other Boards had done, but only deferred its final recommendation. Sometime in 1589, probably shortly before June 20, Rodriga, by now 19. ASV, CSM, reg. 137, 135v-136r, December 18, 1584. 20.

The first paragraph established the basic principle that all the above- mentioned merchants could live securely with their families, merchandise, and possessions without any danger of molestation anywhere in the Vene- tian state. They would have complete freedom to come, dwell, and depart at their pleasure without any hindrance, and be allowed to trade freely on the western and eastern shores of the Adriatic as could Venetian citizens, paying the same customs as the Venetian citizens and the travel- ing Levantine Jewish merchants currently did. The second paragraph dealt with the issue of religious freedom and of possible future expulsion. It stipulated that the merchants could live securely as Jews without being subject to investigation by any office or magistracy, either ecclesiastical or secular, on the charge of having ob- served another religion elsewhere. They could follow their own rites and precepts, and maintain synagogues in accordance with the Mosaic law and the Jewish tradition anywhere in the state. Should the government for any reason no longer wish that they reside in the state, they were to be allowed to depart freely with their families, merchandise, and property, and were to be provided with vessels, boats, wagons, horses, and other necessary things, at the usual prices, in order to be able to go anywhere they wished; in no way and under no pretext might any reprisals be carried out against them, their merchandise, or their possessions. Finally, in such case of banishment, they were to receive eighteen months notice and be paid by all their debtors. The third paragraph provided for security in time of war.

Therefore it was to be provided that in all cases of war with the Turks or with any other ruler, they could not be detained, nor reprisals taken against their property, nor their families disturbed, nor could they be banished, but they were to continue to enjoy their security, and be able to buy and sell everywhere as usual. However, in case of treason, the guilty were not only to be banished, but also punished, while the innocent were to continue to enjoy their security and freedom. Additionally, they were not to be forced to billet soldiers or to be subject to certain taxes, while in time of plague, they were to have the same opportunity to protect them- selves as the other subjects of the state. The fourth paragraph regulated relationships between the Jewish mer- chants and the already resident Tedeschi Jewish moneylenders, and estab- lished the communal rights of the merchants. It was stipulated that the mer- chants would not have to contribute to any of the expenses borne by the moneylending Jews for the banks,22 and be required only to pay the regular customs duties. They were to engage exclusively in trade, using their own capital for the benefit of the customs and the artisans. They were to have the right to appoint their own officials, and the authority to tax them- selves, and compel everyone to pay his due portion, under the sanction of excommunication. To assure that only decent individuals could avail themselves of the privileges and not dishonest ones who, by defrauding, robbing, or otherwise misbehaving, would disturb the security of the mer- chants and defame their reputation, no one could come to settle or be given a dwelling place without a certificate of the deputies of the com- munity, signed by their consul, under pain of a penalty to be determined by the Board of Trade. The latter, who by Senate legislation of May 10, 1586, had been appointed inappellable judges of cases between Jewish and Turk- ish merchants, were now to have jurisdiction also over the Jewish mer- chants, and to provide them with houses, land to bury their dead, and 22.

This request of Rodriga was not incorporated into the charter of 1589, while on the contrary, the second charter of the Jewish merchants, issued in 1598, specifically required them to contribute to the expenses of the banks. I hope to deal with this issue in a future study.

The fifth paragraph was devoted to the port of Spalato. It provided that the Jewish merchants, both transient and resident, could enjoy the same privileges there, and furthermore could have stores of all kinds, act as brokers, and do all things as did the citizens of that city; also they were to be given a place to live with their families, and grounds to bury their dead, and all other amenities, and permission to operate a bank, for both native and visiting merchants. In addition, Jews traveling outside of Spalato were to be allowed to wear a black head-covering (instead of the special yellow one) throughout Dalmatia so that they would not be singled out for molestation by people of bad will. Finally, all the Jews benefitting from the above privileges were to pay Rodriga, their consul, whatever amount was to be assigned to him by the heads of the communities of Venice and Spalato as a reward for his many expenses and efforts. On June 20, the government decided by the margin of five to one to pass the proposals on to the Board of Trade for its advice. The react;in of the Board was very soon forthcoming; six days later it submitted its report which consisted of a long introduction, followed by an analysis of the text proposed by Rodriga. The introduction is of special relevance, for it acknowledged a departure from the traditional Venetian attitude towards the Jewish merchants, and justified the new orientation: The supplication of Daniel Rodriga and the document presented by him in the name of the Levantine, Spanish and other merchants living in this city contain very serious matters, which have at other times been questioned by the reports of our predecessors. Because of the state of trade at present on account of the changes in the affairs of the world, we think that since it is now different, the request is both estimable and useful, and therefore worthy of being accepted. For there is no doubt that the trade of this city, which is its main support, is strengthened by the gathering of persons, who with their business can increase its commerce by coming to live here and making it their domicile and homeland. However, if they were not given the security of life and property and some other specific advantages and privileges, they could take another course to some other parts, which would not be refused to them, as the experience of past events demonstrates to us, with the gathering of so many who, exiled from Spain, went to the Levant because they were not admitted to these parts, and</page><page sequence="15">BENJAMIN C. I. RAVID 201 took their very substantial capital to those areas, augmenting the business of others to the grave detriment of this city. For these reasons and considerations, . . . we state that in general we approve the request made, changed however in its details as follows. And although with the inclusion of the Spanish and the other above- mentioned Jews, it appears that the privilege is greatly broadened, this causes, however, no greater detriment or harm than that which now results from their freedom to pass into Turkish lands and from there to this city to enjoy, as they do now, the benefits of the law under the name of Levantine Turkish subjects. After this introduction, which in principle accepted the request of Rodriga, and dealt extremely succinctly with the Marrano problem, with- out however mentioning the words Marrano or New Christian, the Board moved on to consider the proposals, paragraph by paragraph. The only reaction to the first paragraph was the recommendation that the merchants should not be allowed to trade freely in the Adriatic (i.e., they would have to carry out all their business at Venice and Spalato only) or be promised the same favorable customs tariff as the Venetian citizens. The Board termed the second paragraph "reasonable, but the concern of the most prudent judgment of Your Excellency." Despite its general introductory remark that granting the privileges explicitly also to the "Spanish and the other above-mentioned Jews" did not really constitute a great innovation, the Board evidently did not feel that its jurisdiction ex- tended to recommending details of policy in matters of religion, especially regarding New Christians reverting to Judaism. However, the Board wanted it clearly understood that the immunity from reprisals was to be granted only in matters of religion, and not in other cases, and also that the clause stating that in case of banishment the Jews were to be paid by all their debtors was not obligatory, but merely indicated that due process of law was to be followed (i.e., presumably assurance that their debts would not be cancelled). This point had apparently already been clarified with Rodriga, for the report asserted that he had affirmed that this had been his intention. The third paragraph, which to the Board "seems more important than the others," was termed "most reasonable," for, as the Board explained, while special benefits could not be granted to visiting Ottoman merchants who were Ottoman subjects, coming to the city on business whenever the occasion arose, new inhabitants who came from foreign countries with their families and capital to settle in Venice and become vassals of the</page><page sequence="16">202 JEWISH MERCHANTS OF VENICE Venetian republic deserved to be protected and favored, as the Jewish moneylenders who were "regularly chartered." The Board only recom- mended that the newly privileged merchants should be prohibited, under most severe penalties, from carrying out business under their names on behalf of unprivileged individuals. The only critical reaction of the Board to the fourth paragraph was to suggest that the legislation of May 10, 1586 notwithstanding, it not be appointed judge of the cases and conflicts of the Levantine merchants, for it felt that occupying itself with such specific matters would hinder it in its general concern for public matters. It saw nothing wrong with the other provisions of the fourth paragraph, since they concerned themselves with the internal matters of the merchants. The fifth and last paragraph was considered by the Board very useful for initiating the port of Spalato, and facilitating its trade with Venice, and therefore the Board stated that the requests contained in it should be granted. However, it felt that in order not to impair the privileges of the Spalatines, the provision permitting the Jews to run stores, act as brokers, and have the same rights as all the other inhabitants of that city should be restricted so as to allow them to do only what was not otherwise prohibited to them by the laws of that city. The Board added that it was advisable to grant privileges only to those who by trading with their own resources could bring benefits to the cus- toms and commerce of Venice. For this reason, it should be expressly stated that no Jew of any nation could be granted the new privileges unless he not only was first accepted by the merchants themselves, as they had requested, but also subsequently approved by four of the five members of the Board. The other Jews were to be excluded from the benefits, without prejudice to the privileges of the visiting Levantine Jewish merchants. Finally, the Board reiterated its opinion that, with the above qualifica- tions, the request of Rodriga should be granted. However, it added that it would be both useful and necessary to erect for the Jewish merchants in Spalato a separate place both for their own security as well as for the prevention of the many disorders that usually arose from their mingling with, and having free contact at all hours with, Christians. This very favorable report was signed by only three of the five members of the Board of Trade. It would be interesting to know whether the other two members were absent for valid reasons, or whether the absence of</page><page sequence="17">BENJAMIN C. I. RAVID 203 their signatures indicated their dissent from the attitude adopted by their colleagues, who constituted a majority of one. Almost exactly a month was required to work out a new set of privileges, no doubt in constant consultation with the Board, Rodriga, and other interested parties. The text was approved by the College on July 27, 1589, and introduced on the Senate floor on the same day. The preamble to the bill, in accordance with the Venetian practice, presented the purpose of the proposed legislation, and in this case also served to justify the radical departure from the existing Venetian com- mercial policy. The original phrasing "Jewish, Levantine, Spanish and other merchants" had been changed to the more neutral "Levantine and Ponentine Jews." Although it was doubtlessly clear to all contemporaries what a Ponentine Jew was, the Venetian government apparently preferred that "neutral" geographic nomenclature, the opposite of Levantine, to the alternative of Marrano, New Christian, Spanish, or Portuguese Jew, with their more explicit religious and national implication. It read: The circumstances of the present times give cause to this council to open the way for those who have the desire to come and dwell in this city and in our state, both for mercantile commerce and for the increase which is desired in the guilds of the city, for those reasons which can be contemplated by everyone. Accordingly, Our Serenity being requested in the name of some Levantine and Ponen- tine Jews now residing in other jurisdictions who wish to be admitted into this city and into our dominion under those terms that shall be considered suitable to enable them to dwell securely in the said city and the Venetian dominions, let it be resolved that... The opening paragraph of the legislation itself very clearly and con- cisely established the right of the merchants to live in Venice with their families and to enjoy complete religious freedom with immunity for their past religious conduct. Three new elements were incorporated into that paragraph: (1) a time limit of ten years was introduced; (2) as could be expected but had not been previously stipulated by either Rodriga or the Board, although assumed by Rodriga at least for Spalato, the merchants were required to wear the yellow Jewish hat, as were the Tedeschi Jewish moneylenders, and indeed all Jews in Venice since the late fourteenth century, with the exception of a privileged few; (3) the merchants were</page><page sequence="18">204 JEWISH MERCHANTS OF VENICE formally required to live in a ghetto, a restriction which had been imposed on all Jews in Venice since 1516.23 The text read: . . For the coming ten years, safe-conduct is to be granted to any Levantine or Ponentine Jewish merchant to be able to come to dwell in this city of ours with his family, to reside and to do business freely, wearing the yellow hat of the Jews and making his residence in the ghetto nuovo24 with the other Jews, in which they may 23. In his petition, Rodriga had referred to a ghetto to be established for the Jews of Spalato, while his charter text only proposed that the Jews be given in Spalato "houses and a place to live with their families." He apparently took it for granted that the Jewish merchants would be confined to a ghetto in the city of Venice itself. 24. Interestingly, a report of the Board of Trade of January 18, 1590 suggested, probably in accordance with a request of Rodriga, that the phrase ghetto nuovo in this charter be changed to read "ghetto vecchio or where it will be determined in the absence of housing" (ASV, CSM, reg. 138, 99r-100v). Presumably, the Board wanted to continue to keep the Jews separated according to their ethnic origin and economic functions, with the Tedeschi moneylenders residing in the ghetto nuovo and the Levantine and Ponentine merchants in the ghetto vecchio. Senate legisla- tion of June 20, 1590 accepted the proposal of the Board and provided that the text of the charter of 1589, which "in error" had stated that the new inhabitants were to live in the ghetto nuovo, was to be amended to read that "they are to live in the ghetto vecchio or where it shall be judged most suitable by the Board in the absence of housing" (ASV, Senate, Mar, reg. 50, 54v-55r). Nevertheless, the pro- vision that the Levantine and Ponentine merchants were to live in the ghetto nuovo was repeated in all their subsequent charters; presumably, rather than separate the Jews on the basis of their economic function, the Senate wanted to separate them on the basis of their residential status, with the chartered Jews, whether Tedeschi, Levantine, or Ponentine, in the ghetto nuovo, and the visiting Levantine merchants in the ghetto vecchio. The residential arrangements of the Jews of Venice, which as far as the specific ghetto assignments were concerned were not observed even prior to 1589, and were in the first decade of the seventeenth century to cause a sharp controversy between the magistracies of the Cattaveri and the Board of Trade, will be examined further in a future study. To date, the situation has not been clearly understood; see above, note 6, and below, note 25, and also Roth, Venice, p. 140, and Roth, "La ricondotta degli ebrei ponentini. Venezia 1647," Studi in onore di Gino Luzzatto, 4 vols. (Milan, 1950), II, 241, note 3, where in connection with the provision in the charter of 1647, still worded identically with the phrasing of 1589, that the Levantine and Ponentine merchants were to reside in the ghetto nuovo, Roth states that "this must I think be a slip for Ghetto Vecchio, to which the Levantine merchants were sent in 1541 . . . and where both the Levantine and Ponentine synagogues were situated, as they still are." Roth's account of the charter of 1589 requires revision, as do other parts of his introduction to the text of the charter of 1647; see Ravid, "Economics and Toleration," note 36. Cf. also the contradictory information on the date the Ponentine Jews were re- quired to reside in a ghetto, contained in Milano, Gli Ebrei in Italia: 1541 on p. 525 and 1589 on p. 280, while according to his article "Imnmagini del passato ebraico: XX: Venezia, (2)," La Rassegna Mensile di Israel, XXXIV (1968), 650,</page><page sequence="19">BENJAMIN C. I. RAVID 205 observe their rites, precepts, and ceremonies and maintain synagogues according to their custom, secure for the said time in not being molested on account of religion by any magistracy. The rest of the text constituted virtually a restatement of the privileges requested by Rodriga, with the modifications proposed by the Board. In- terestingly, the only suggestion of the Board which was not accepted was its request not to be given jurisdiction over the new settlers. The remaining terms of the charter provided that the newcomers S. . may live with their families, merchandise, and property without any danger or molestation, both in this city and in any other city of our state, on the mainland as overseas, coming, residing, and depart- ing as they wish, without any hindrance. They may also sail freely, as do presently the visiting Jewish Levantine merchants. And should it no longer please Our Serenity that they should dwell any longer in this state, be it on account of any contingency or the public interest, they are to let them know this desire of Our Serenity eigh- teen months before they are to leave, at which time they are to be given in accordance with justice all summary aid by our magistrates so that they be paid by all their creditors. And they shall be given unhindered transit for themselves, their families, merchandise and property so that they can go without any impediment or molestation; they are to be granted the permission to make use of vessels, barges, wagons, horses and other things necessary for their voyage, to be able to go wherever it shall most please them, paying to those whom they shall employ their recompense as is appropriate, and Our Serenity shall not be able to confiscate their merchandise or property, except in case of lese majesty or criminal proceedings. Also at that time they shall be given all summary aid by our magistrates so that they shall be paid by all their creditors. On all occasions of war with any ruler, none of the above mer- chants may be detained nor their goods confiscated nor their families disturbed in any other way. Nor may they be banished in case of war, but they shall remain in their said security, being able to buy, sell and do business, taking without any loss or danger all goods and merchandise by land as by sea, paying however the usual customs. Excepted however from this order regarding not being banished are matters of state interest, in which cases those who deserve it shall not only be banished, but also punished, the innocent remaining in their accustomed security and liberty. the Ponentine Jews were only required to enter into a ghetto, the ghetto n ovissimo in 1633. In reality, from 1516 on, any Jew wishing to live openly as a Jew in Venice was required to live behind ghetto walls.</page><page sequence="20">20 6 JEWISH MERCHANTS OF VENICE The above cannot be molested in any way in time of war, neither by the billeting of soldiers, nor impositions (gravezze) to which they shall have to contribute with their persons. And in time of plague they shall have the same opportunity to save themselves as have our other subjects. They may not trade with the goods of non-privileged persons, the latter using their name to benefit from the privileges granted to the above Levantine and Ponentine Jews under pain of losing all the property which shall be found to belong to others not privileged or named in the present legislation, one quarter of which shall belong to the denouncer, one quarter to the magistracy that will carry out the sentence, and the remainder will go into our treasury. The above Levantine and Ponentine merchants have the liberty to elect in their congregations their officials, ministers, and deputies, to their offices, concerns, and responsibilities, according to their desire, and have authority to tax themselves according to the cir- cumstances which shall daily arise and each one shall bear the due portion, they being able to compel him to the due payment by means of our magistrates, who at every appearance of their legitimate deputies without allowing any contradiction, are to carry out the actual implementation against the disobedient. And so that to that nation shall only be admitted well-behaved and esteemed men, and not dishonest persons who by defrauding or robbing or otherwise misbehaving should disturb the security of those merchants and detract from the honor and good conduct which those merchants profess to observe, none can be admitted or registered to the above benefits, unless first admitted to the community (uni- versitd) by the others and approved by four-fifths of the Board of Trade. And in case anyone shall not be admitted by the said com- munity, appearing before the said Board, he may be approved by it in the above-mentioned way; all the rest of the Jews not ap- proved by the said office are to be excluded from the above- mentioned benefit, without prejudice to the privilege of the visiting Levantines. The Board of Trade, which by the legislation of this Council of May 5, 1586, is the inappellable judge of the differences that arise between the Jewish and Turkish merchants, similarly is also inap- pellable judge of the above-mentioned Levantine and Ponentine Jews for contracts made between them. It also has to procure for the above-mentioned houses for their habitation, and grounds outside the city for burying their dead, issuing good regulations, so that they shall be given the opportunity to live in accordance with their rites and customs at their expense and at controlled prices for everything, as it has done up until now to the visiting Levantine Jews.</page><page sequence="21">BENJAMIN C. I. RAVID 207 The Senate voted on the charter bill and approved it by the very sub- stantial margin of 110 to 11, with 13 absentions. Thus, finally, Rodriga's fight for a charter was successful. At last the Jewish merchants had their long-desired security and most favorable privileges.25 Apparently, the final acceptance of the request of Rodriga was due, in addition to his persistence, to two closely related factors, one general and the other more specific. First, as alluded to by the Board and the preamble to the charter, Venetian commerce was indeed encountering increasing difficulties in the late sixteenth century.26 While Venice had competed suc- cessfully against Genoa and Ancona, the increasing activities of the Atlantic nation-states of Spain, Portugal, France, England, and Holland in the Mediterranean, and especially in the Ottoman ports, were constituting far more formidable challenges. In response, Venice hoped that granting formal residential and trading privileges to Jewish merchants might induce them to settle in the city, and attract to it the trade of both their Ottoman coreligionists and also their Iberian New Christian relatives and contacts. Second, specifically, Venice was finally ready to implement the Spalato project, long advocated by Rodriga, and in view of the prominent role of the Jews in the trade of Dalmatia, considered it desirable to grant them privileges in Venice in order to assure their participation in the project. IV One provision of the new charter was of singular significance in the con- text of Venetian political and commercial law. The immediate granting to non-Venetians (other than Ottoman subjects) of the right to engage in overseas trade with the Levant on the same terms as native Venetians was a concession unprecedented in the commercial history of Venice. The lay inhabitants of Venice were divided into three groups: the nobles 25. On the charter of 1589, see the brief account in Roth, Venice, p. 67, which requires revision, and also Milano, Gli Ebrei in Italia, pp. 282-83. 26.

However, Venetian citizenship could also be acquired by residence. Such citizenship was divided into two types: de intus and de intus et de extra. A law of 1552, redefining the requirements for such naturalization, stipulated that in order to become a de intus citizen, a status which con- ferred trading privileges within the city of Venice and also the right to join the guilds, it was necessary for the foreigner to live in Venice with his family as a taxpayer for fifteen years. If he married a Venetian woman, he was then eligible eight years after marriage. De intus et de extra citizenship conferred also the right to engage in foreign trade as a Venetian subject, paying the lower customs duties, and was granted only after twenty-five years of residence in the city. In 1586 those legally allowed to engage in trade between Venice and the Levant, the patricians and the cittadini (originari and de intus et de extra), constituted 4.3 percent and less than 5.1 percent respectively of the population of Venice.27 Thus, from 1589 on, the Levantine and Ponentine Jews, many if not most of whom were either Marranos or descended from Marrano stock, possessed rights to which over 90 percent of the native Venetians could never aspire, and moreover were not subject to the same twenty-five-year waiting period, as were all Christian non-Venetians who desired the privilege to engage in the Levant trade. In two respects, however, the privileges granted to the Jews were less generous than those of the citizens de intus et de extra. First, they did not include the right to engage in retail trade or join the guilds. Also, while de intus et de extra citizenship was granted for life and inheritable, the Jews, although gaining instant rights, lived under the relative insecurity of a ten-year charter subject to cancellation on eighteen-months notice. Nevertheless, in the context of the times, despite the requirements of living in a ghetto and wearing a yellow badge and always being subject to expulsion on eighteen-months notice, the conditions offered to the Jewish merchants by the charter of 1589 were very attractive indeed. Venice was then the only major port city in Christian Europe in which Jews could 27. This brief summary of the legal situation is based on Pullan, Rich and Poor, pp. 99-106. For the figures of 1586, see D. Beltrami, Storia della populazione di Venezia dalla fine del secolo XVI alla caduta della repubblica (Padua, 1954), p. 72. However, for our purposes, the second figure of 5.1 percent must be reduced, since it includes de intus citizens who did not possess the right of overseas trade with the Levant.</page><page sequence="23">BENJAMIN C. I. RAVID 209 openly practice Judaism. While in the sixteenth century Turkey had pro- vided an attractive haven for Marranos fleeing the Iberian peninsula, in the seventeenth century, as the commercial prosperity of the Ottoman Em- pire declined and the position of its Jews deteriorated, Venice (shortly afterwards joined by its rival of Livorno, and then outside the Mediterra- nean, Amsterdam) took its place, becoming a major center of the Marrano -and Jewish-diaspora. On its part, Venice had nothing to lose by granting commercial privileges to the Jews for the limited period of ten years. At best its competitive posi- tion in general and especially vis-i-vis its two main Adriatic rivals, Ancona and Ragusa, would be improved, resulting in an increase in the customs revenue and the maintenance of its crucial entrepot function. Furthermore, in a certain sense the issuance of the charter did not constitute a major departure from the existing situation, since de facto the Jewish merchants were already residing in the city for extended periods. If the experiment did not work, the charter simply would not be renewed at the time of its expiration date ten years later, or the eighteen-month cancellation clause would be invoked. V The charter also marked an innovation in the religious sphere. Prior to 1589, Venice had granted only limited sojourn privileges to Levantine Jewish merchants, who as Ottoman subjects were permitted to trade in Venice by virtue of the Venetian-Ottoman treaties. Now, Venice was not only offering long-term residence and trading privileges and the status of Venetian subjects (not citizenship, however) to the Ottoman Jews, but even extending these highly valued privileges to Ponentine Jews, Marranos who in violation of the then-accepted Counter Reformation papal inter- pretation of canon law, were allowed to revert to Judaism and live openly as Jews in Venice, with the guarantee that the government would not in- vestigate their previous religious conduct. How was such a policy justified by a Catholic state in the Counter Reformation period? None of the documents I have seen to date in the registers and files of the Senate (including also the reports of the Board of Trade) contain any reference to the religious problem involved in allowing individuals born and brought up as Christians to revert to Judaism. Popes and clerics had</page><page sequence="24">210 JEWISH MERCHANTS OF VENICE vacillated somewhat on the enforcement of compulsory baptism and, in- deed, earlier in the century before the Counter Reformation, Popes had allowed New Christians to revert to Judaism in papal Ancona. The Venetian government was more concerned with enhancing the coffers of the republic than with maintaining a disputed point of Christian theology and saw no reason to be more papal than the former papal policy, es- pecially when its economy and commerce were involved. Potential criti- cism could always be assuaged by pointing out that these new Jews were not free to live in Venice mingling with the Christians and potentially sub- verting their faith, but were to be distinguished by the yellow badge and segregated in a ghetto. The chief ideologist, spokesman, and apologist for the overall Venetian religious policy, as always loyally Catholic, yet not recognizing the papal claims to jurisdiction, was the Venetian monk, Fra Paolo Sarpi. Although none of his statements on the Jewish question date from 1589 or relate to the first charter of the Levantine and Ponentine Jews of Venice, they are representative of the mentality of the ruling groups in the Venetian government and properly deserve to be introduced at this point, since they indicate the theological approach and climate of opinion which underlay the secular legislation. Most specifically, in a consulto submitted to the Venetian government sometime between the years 1614 and 1617, in which he dwelled on one of the main Venetian grievances with the papacy, the papal claims to inquisitional jurisdiction, Sarpi differentiated carefully between heretics, who were subject to the inquisition, and infidels, such as Jews, who were rather subject to the secular magistrate. He went so far as to advise the Venetian government that The Marranos cannot be subjected to the office of the inquisition, having received a safe-conduct enabling them to come and live with their families in the Dominion and leave at their pleasure, with their possessions, living in the ghetto and wearing the yellow hat, and to exercise their rites and ceremonies without hindrance and this per- mission was granted to them for the public benefit of Christianity, so that they should not carry so much wealth and needed industrious- ness to the lands of the Turks.28 28.

RAVID 211 So Sarpi most ingeniously succeeded in identifying the Venetian policy towards the Marranos, resulting from commercial raison d'dtat, with the greater good of Christianity. And, moreover, he justified this policy by citing the precedent of pre-Counter Reformation papal actions: And the concession of such a safe-conduct is lawful and legitimate, and cannot be condemned, since many popes have allowed the Mar- ranos to go to live in Ancona with greater privileges than have been granted by the Venetian republic and specifically Julius III on December 6, 1552 gave them a most ample [charter].29 VI Thus, in less than fifty years, the attitude of the Venetian government towards the Levantine merchants and the former Marranos (two categories which were not necessarily mutually exclusive) underwent a fundamental change. The traveling Levantine merchants, authorized in 1541 to reside in Venice for a limited period which was later curtailed, were now of- ficially invited to the city, and allowed to reside there for a ten-year period, paying the same lower tariff rates as the Venetian merchants themselves, and enjoying one of the most important and coveted privileges of Venetian citizenship, reserved for only the upper 10 percent of the Venetians: the freedom of trade with the Levant. Furthermore, this privilege could be granted instantly, not only to Levantine merchants coming from the Otto- man Empire (albeit originally possibly of Iberian Marrano origin), but even to "Ponentine Jews," who only weeks previously might have lived precariously as Marranos in the shadow of the Iberian inquisition and now possessed complete immunity from any investigation of their past religious behavior. As an "epilogue," it should be pointed out that the "experiment" of lined words, which were italicized in the text as published by Cecchetti without any explanation, are found in the charter of 1589 itself, as well as in its inter- vening renewals of 1598 and 1611. 29.

In fact, the privileges for merchants, and especially Jewish merchants, issued by the two main Italian competitors of Venice, Livorno in 1593 and Ancona in 1594, were probably influenced by, if not constituting a direct response to, the Venetian charter of 1589. Con- sequently, to maintain its position, the Venetian Senate, when requested by Rodriga in 1598, renewed the charter of the Jewish merchants, with some changes, by the vote of ninety-four affirmative, six opposed, and sixteen abstentions. The preamble related that "at this time, even greater are the reasons which have on other occasions induced this council to permit the residence of Jewish Levantine and Ponentine merchants in this city and their trade in our state, primarily for mercantile trade, so im- portant for the public good, as everyone can very well realize through his own judgment." 30 From reports of the Board of Trade submitted during the following decades, it is evident that the Jewish merchants assumed a significant role in the declining overseas commerce of Venice; consequently, the Senate continually renewed their charters, enabling them, as already stated, to retain their unique privileges down to the end of the Venetian republic.3' 30.

The special position of the Levantine and Ponentine merchants and the Mar- ranos was noted in a brief, but accurate, account of the Jewish community of Venice, written around 1634, probably by the Ambassador from Modena in a report sent to his government: Gli hebrei levantini e Ponentini hanno un privileggio particolare che essendo vietato dagli ordini della Republica il negotio di Levante e di Ponente a tutti i Mercanti Christiani che non sono Venetiani essi solamente trafficano libera- mente nell'uno e nell'alto luogo et hanno un Magistrato di Nobili Venetiani detto de Cinque savi che solo e sommariamente giudica ne loro interessi, cose tutte che hanno servito e servono d'invito agli hebrei di quel paese di trasferirsi a Venetia.

The two texts of the report of the Board, and also the two of the charter contained in Senate, Mar, filza and registro, all written in 1589, differ not only in their use of abbreviation, elision, capitalization, and punctuation, but also in orthography (e.g., Ebrei, Hebrei; stato, stado; commercio, commertio; habitare, habitar; spagnoli, spagnai; legitimi, legitimij; gli, li); indeed, on occasion two different spell- ings are found in the same copy of the text. Whenever two different forms have been encountered in the same place in two copies of a text, the unabbreviated version and the spelling closer to modern Italian usage have been reproduced. The punctuation has been very slightly modified to assist the reader. A. Petition of the Jewish Merchants. B. Petition of Daniel Rodriga. C. Proposed charter text submitted by Daniel Rodriga. D.

D 1589 a 27 Zugno Illmi et Eccmi Sri La supplica de Daniel Rodriga et la scrittura pntata da lui p nome de mercti levantini, spagnoli, et altri habitanti in qsta citta contengono per se stessa materia molto grave, la quale come fu altre fiate posta in dubio p le risposte de nri precessori, cosi dalla riuscita di negotij dall'occasione di pnti tempi p le revolutioni delle cose del mondo, stimiamo che havendo ella al pnte presa altra forma, sij la richiesta fatta altrotanto stimabile quanto utile, et pcio degna di esser abbrazzata: pche non e dubio che il traffico di questa citti principal sostentamento di essa prende forza dal concorso di persone, che co'l negotio et commodith possono accrescer il suo commercio, li quali come co'l venirvi ad habitare se la costituiranno loro domicilio, et patria naturale, cosi quando non fosse ad essi aperta la strada principalte della securti delle loro vite et robbe, et da qualche altro particolar avantagio et privilegio, potrebbono prender altro indrizzo da qualche parte, che non sara loro recusato, come ci lo dimostra l'esperi- enza delle cose passate, co'l concorso di tanti, che usciti dalla Spagna, et andati in Levante p non haver trovato in qste parti recapito, hanno portato i loro grossissimi capitali in qlle bandi con aggrandimento di negotij d'altri, et grave interesse di qsta cittt, per quei rispetti et con- siderationi, che possono esser ben noti alle Ecctie V. Da questi fondamenti dunque (poich6 commandano le Ecctie V. che noi savij all mrtia habbiamo sopra le cose proposte a dir la nra opinione) noi p riverente essecutione di lor'ordine diciamo, che nell'universale approbiamo la richiesta fatta, regolata perb nel suo particolare come qui sotto appare. Et se bene con l'inclusione de spagnoli et altri hebrei suppti par che si dilatti molto il</page><page sequence="32">218 JEWISH MERCHANTS OF VENICE privilegio, non apporta perb qsto nessun pregiudicio o nocumento maggiore di qllo, che si ricceve hora dalla liberth che hanno i medmi di poter passar nel paese Turchesco, et di 1 a questa citti p godere, come fanno al pnte sotto nome de sudditi Turcheschi levantini, il beneficio dlla legge. Prendendo noi dunque principio dalla scrittura diciamo Pmo Che quanto al primo capitulo, levate tutte le parole che principiano "cosi sopravento come sottovento etc" sino a qlla parte che dice "sicome fanno anco li hebrei levantini viandanti" crediamo che nel resto sia admissibile. 2do Al secondo la continentia di esso ~ ragionevole ma parte perb che spetta al prudmo giudicio delle Ecctie V. et in qlla conditione di parole "non potendo in alcun modo ne sotto qualsivoglia pretentione, ne accusatione, esser fatto represaglia etc" si doveri intender assolutamte p qllo che appartiene alla religione et inquisitione accioch6 sotto la generalith di qlle parole non sij abbrazzato qual si voglia altro caso, come medesimente in qll'altra parte dove dice "facendoli anco pma pagare di tutti li suoi debitori" non siano qste parole ad esser obligatorie, ma per sola dechiaratione di esser giudicati et suffragati dalla giustitia espeditamte alla qual nostra opinione concorer l'istesso Rodriga, affermando che tale vuol esser il senso et intentione di tutte le parole sopti. 3zo Il terzo che par pii importante delli altri non havendo hebrei levantini privilegio di esser assicurati in tempo di guerra nella pnte rissolutione &amp; molto ragionevole, perch&amp; se a sudditi Turcheschi viandanti et che in tanto riconoscono qsta citti in quanto porta loro l'occasion dl negotio non possono ne devono riccever qsto beneficio come vassali di quel Principe, questi novi habitanti perb, che verranno con le loro famiglie et capitali, et che passando dall'alieno Dominio p constituirsi vassali di qsta Sma Rep. meritano dalla benignith di Sua St' esser protetti et favoriti nella medma maniera che sono li altri hebrei ordinariamte condotti. Et per levar le fraudi che potriano esser commesse da qsti di servire sotto il loro nome li negotij d'altri non privilegiati, dovert p cio esser loro pro- hibito con severissime pene. 4to Dimandano che nelle cause et difficolth loro resti giudice il nro magistrato conforme al privilegio di levantini p la parte di 10 mazo 1586, et se bene conviene in tutte le parti pareggiar qsti co'l benefo di altri, tutta via p ch&amp; remetter a noi tante cause &amp; un occuparsi nelle trattationi parti- colari con impedimto delli pub., quando si potesse dar altro giudici sarebbe cib con molto servitio delli altri pii importanti negotij. Nel resto poi delle cose contenute in esso non vi conoscendo contrario alco come cose de-</page><page sequence="33">BENJAMIN C. I. RAVID 219 pendenti dal loro governo et libera volonth ci riportiamo al loro prudmo giudicio. 5to II quinto, et ultimo, 6 stimato da noi molto utile p indrizzo dlla scale di Spalato, la quale prenderd forma et facilitera il suo negotio con la corrispondenza di qsta, come speriamo, et pci6 le cose dimandate sono stimate da noi degne di esser loro concesse. E vero che p non pre- giudicare a privilegij de Spalatini, sari bene regolare qlla parte che dice "possino tenir botteghe etc come fanno tutti li cittadini di qlla citth" nel senso che possino far ogni sorte di essercitio non prohibito da privilegij di qlla citth. Et p conclusione di qsto negotio stimando noi, che non sij bene admetter al privilegio delle cose narrate se non qlli che possono co'l negotio et con le proprie facolth apportar beneficio et a i datij et commercio di qsta citth, pci6 dover8 esser espressamente dichiarito, che nessun hebreo di qual nattione si sij debbi esser descritto al beneficio sudo se non sari prima admesso dalla universith loro, come nel quarto capto ricercano, et appro- bato con quatro balle delli cinq dl magistrato nro, dovendo tutto lo resto de hebrei non approbati dall'offo esser esclusi dalle cose narrate, senza pregiudicio perb di privilegij de levantini viandanti. Nel particolar poi della suppca di esso Daniel contenendo ella tutto qllo che dalle cose narrate nella scrittura &amp; appreso, giudicamo che sij bene colle medme conditioni da noi dechiarite gratificarlo, e dovendosi introdurre a Spalato il commercio di queste genti sara altretanto utile quanto necio il fabricarvi loco separato per sicurth delle loro vite et p prohibire ai tanti disordeni che sogliono p il piji occorere dalla mescolanza et libero commercio a tutte le hore con christiani, e tanto basti per reverente espressione dlla opinione nra, riportandosi per6 sempre al suo prudmo parer alle quali etc. io. Thomaso Morosini io. Alvise Prioli io. Hiermo Capello ab. alij E Le occasioni de presenti tempi dano materia a questo Conso di aprire la strada a quelli, che hanno desiderio di venir ad habitar in questa citt~, et</page><page sequence="34">220 JEWISH MERCHANTS OF VENICE nel Dominio nostro, cosi per il commercio mercantile, come p l'aumento, che si deve desiderare nelle arti della citth, p quelli rispetti, che da cadauno possono esser considerati. Onde essendo richiesta la S.N. p nome de alcuni Ebrei Levantini et Ponentini hora habitanti in aliene iuridittioni a volerli admetter in essa citti et nel Dominio nro con quelli Capitoli, che saranno stimati convenienti per poter habitare sicuramente in detta citti et Dominio Veneto. L'anderi parte, che p anni dieci prossimi venturi sia concesso salvocon- dotto a qualunque Ebreo Mercante Levantino et Ponentino di poter venir ad habitar in questa cittt nostra con le loro famiglie, star, et in essa praticar liberamente, portando la sessa, overo la baretta zalla da Ebrei, et facendo la sua habitatione nel ghetto nuovo con li altri Ebrei, nel quale possano usar et far li loro ritti, precetti, cerimonie et tenere Sinagoghe, secondo l'uso loro, sicuri per detto tempo di non esser molestati p causa di religione da qual si voglia Magistrato. Possano viver con le loro persone, famiglie, mercantie et facolth senza pericolo o molestia alcuna, cosi in questa, come in qual'altra citt, del stato nostro, et cosi da Terra come da Mar, venendo, stando, et da esso partendo, il che sia in loro arbitrio, senza poterli esser fatto impedimento alcuno. Possano anco navegar liberamente, come fanno al pnte li Ebrei Levantini viandanti. Et in caso che p qualche accidente o publico rispetto non piacesse alla S.N. che habitassero piii in questo stato, se li debba far sapere questa volonth della S.N. mesi disdotto prima di quando essi doveranno partire, al qual tempo sia loro dato per giustitia ogni summario aiuto dalli Magistrati nostri, perch&amp; siano fatti pagare da tutti quelli, de quali essi andassero creditori. Et li sia dato libero transito per le persone, famiglie, mercantie et facolth loro, sich6 possano andare senza impedimento o molestia alcuna. Dovendo loro esser concessa facolth di servirsi di vasselli, barche, carri, cavalli et altre cose necessarie p il suo viaggio, p poter andar dove piii le piacer8, pagando a quelli che mettessero in opera le loro mercedi come b conveniente, non potendo all'hora dalla S.N. esser fatta represaglia delle mercantie o facolth loro, se non in caso di lesa maesti o per cause criminali. Anzi a quel tempo sia loro dato ogni sum- mario aiuto dalli Magistrati nostri, perchi siano fatti pagare da tutti quelli de quali essi andassero creditori. Che in ogni occasione di guerra con qual si voglia Principe non possa alcuno delli sopti mercanti esser ritenuto o fatto represaglia della sua robba o in altro modo turbate le loro famiglie. Ne possano p occasione di</page><page sequence="35">BENJAMIN C. I.

Eccettuando da questo ordine, quanto al non esser licentiati, gl'interessi di stado, nelli qual casi non solo siano licentiati, ma castigati ancora quelli che meritassero, restando gli innocenti nella loro solita sicurezza e liberth. Non possa alli sopti esser data alcuna molestia in tempo di guerra, cosi de allogiamenti p soldati, come di gravezza alla qual dovessero contribuire con le proprie persone. Et in tempo di peste habbiano le istesse commodith di salvarsi che hanno gli altri sudditi nostri. Non possano questi far mercantia di robbe d'altri non privilegiati, ser- vendo quelli con il suo nome per avantagiarli nelli privileggij che si con- cedeno alli sopti ebrei Levantini e Ponentini, sotto pena di perder tutte le facolta che fossero ritrovate esser d'altri non privilegiati o nominati nella pnte deliberatione, un quarto della qual sia del denontiante, un quarto del magistrato che fari la essecutione, et il restante vadi nel Dominio nostro. Che li sopti mercanti Levantini e Ponentini habbiano liberth di poter elegger nelle sue congregationi li loro officiali, ministri, deputadi a gli officij, negotij et carichi, secondo la volonth loro, et habbiano auttorith di metter tasse fra loro, secondo le occasioni che p giornata nascessero et ad ogni uno compartire la debita portione, potendoli astringer al debito pagamento col mezzo delli Magistrati nostri, i quali ad ogni comparitione delli loro legitimi deputadi, senza admetter alcuna contradittione, debbano com- metter contra li innobedienti la essecutione reale et personale. Et accioch6 tra essa Natione non siano admessi se non huomini civili e reputati, et non persone dishoneste, le quali o defraudando o rubbando o altramente mal operando, havessero a turbare la sicurezza di essi mercanti et detrahere all'honore et buoni costumi che pretendeno essi mercanti di osservare, non possa alco esser admesso 6 descritto alli benefitij sopti, se non sari prima admesso dalla universith dlli altri, et approbato dalli quattro quinti dlli Cinque Savi Sopra la Mercantia. Et in caso che qualch'uno non fosse admesso dall'universith sudetta comparendo avanti li Cinque Savi sopti, possa quel tale esser approbato dalli Cinque Savi sudetti nel modo sopto, dovendo tutto il resto de Ebrei non approbati dall'offo sudetto esser esclusi dal beneficio sopto, senza pregiudicio di privileggij di Levantini Viandanti.
