Hanover, N.H.: University Press of New England for Brandeis University Press, 1989, xiii, 355 pp. Remote from the center-stage of world Jewish history and hidden within the immense cultural diversity of the subcontinent, Indian Jewish communi- ties may nevertheless reveal some elemental dimensions of Jewish tradition. For the contrasting threats of persecution and assimilation faced by Jewish communities in the Western diaspora have not traditionally been character- istic of the Indian socioreligious milieu, where separate endogamous groups have normally coexisted in various degrees of social distance and economic accommodation. Indian Judaisms thus show us what can happen when Jewish traditions develop self-contained and let alone, and when Jewish identities are treated unexceptionally among others in a plurally conceived society. As Joan G. Roland indicates in the subtitle of her book, it is with the transformations of these traditional Indian Jewish identities in the British colonial order that she is here principally concerned. Probably founded by traders from across the Arabian Sea, Jewish com- munities are known to have existed on India's western coast from at least 1000 C.E., and may even date from the period of the Second Temple. Three main communities have flourished on the subcontinent: the Cochin Jews in the far southwest, who remained in contact with world Jewry; the more numerous Bene Israel of the Konkan coast farther north, who preserved their religious identity in isolation from the rest of the Jewish world; and the Baghdadis, Near Eastern immigrants who settled as merchants in Bombay and Calcutta beginning in the eighteenth century. Giving only peripheral treatment to the Cochin Jews, whose relatively rich historical and ethnographic records have previously attracted consider- able attention from non-Indian scholars, Roland focuses on the Bene Israel and the Baghdadis in colonial Bombay. She points out some of the inevita- ble ironies of the colonial situation: how Christian missionaries teaching Bible to the Bene Israel did not convert them but rather heightened their Jewish identity; how the Bene Israel never suffered as much prejudice from ordinary Indians as they did from Baghdadi (and later, Israeli) Jews. Such ironic observations form part of an intricate historical analysis of the rela- tionships of Indian Jewish groups to one another and to the British, who had complex imperial concerns of their own. Although the colonial regime provided some clear avenues on which</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 235 Jews could advance-trade and manufacturing for the Baghdadis, civil and military service for the Bene Israel-it was ambivalent about their profile as a community. On the one hand, colonialist elitism implicitly reinforced the hierarchical divisions of traditional society that Indian Jews already recog- nized among their own. On the other, the broad Western religious categories explicitly recognized by the British administration-"Hindus," "Chris- tians," "Muslims," "Sikhs"-could also lead Jews to close their diverse ranks around a newly conceived sense of ethnicity. In adapting to Indian ways, traditional Jewish communities had learned to understand their corporate identities in terms of Indian castes; like caste- groups, they were assigned a relative status by others and could even contain their own ranked subdivisions. From this point of view, there was no parti- cular reason for distinct Jewish groups to intermingle. The colonialist racial and cultural divide then further segregated the "native" Bene Israel from the "foreign" and fair-skinned Baghdadis, who quickly adopted English ways. At the same time, however, the inclusive concept of religious community used by the British derived from Western religious ideas shared by Indian Jews, who responded to it in their own ways. Thus, while members of differ- ent Jewish groups still did not normally intermarry, they did frequently help one another out: Bene Israel finding work in Baghdadi factories, and both aiding European refugees in the 1930s and 1940s. And it was as one com- munity, finally, that the British treated the Indian Jews in law-despite attempts on the part of some Baghdadis to be classified as "European" for electoral purposes. The changing relationship of groups of Indian Jews to one another and to the British regime took place against a world background that offered alternative political loyalties: Zionism, Indian nationalism, and the British Empire. Throughout her analyses, Roland describes the implications of dif- ferent configurations of these political factors for Indian Jews. Some Jewish leaders, for example, made appeals to nationalist Hindu politicians, who in solidarity with Indian Muslims occasionally spoke out against Zionism as an instrument of the British imperialists. Indian nationalism itself, more- over, held varying appeal for different Jewish groups: while eventually winning over many Bene Israel, it never attracted the Anglicized Baghdadis, most of whom emigrated to English-speaking lands. Roland then attributes the large-scale Bene Israel aliyah in the early 1950s in part to the simulta- neous creation of Israel and India as independent states. Unsure of their economic and cultural place in independent India, which itself took final</page><page sequence="3">236 BOOK REVIEWS shape through religious division, many Bene Israel opted for their Jewish identity over their Indian one. Working from archives and interviews-and especially from accounts in Indian Jewish periodicals-Roland has presented a most competent social history, well grounded in primary sources. She seems less well versed, however, in the secondary literature on Indian social theory. She cites some classics, but is spare in her mention of more contemporary sources in both Indian anthropology and colonialism. In particular, she repeatedly refers to a single unpublished paper by David Lelyveld-which, whatever its strengths, should not be made to bear as much authoritative weight as it does here. Although Roland's basic analysis remains sound, more engage- ment with the social-scientific literature might have made her book more consistently engrossing. For while she often does write absorbing narrative, the details provided by her sectarian sources are themselves undramatic and often petty. Too frequently, I found myself wishing that an example I was reading would either make a clear analytic point or be considerably briefer. For much of the narrative describes a record of factional strife, fundraising efforts, and personal animosities within a community that never numbered much more than twenty-five thousand-out of a total Indian population counted in hundreds of millions. All told, we get a picture of a socioreligious group marginal to its wider society and yet itself divided, more influential than its numbers warrant, perhaps, but whose sense of its own significance tends to outweigh the importance given to it by others. In these respects, at least, the Jewish community of India may seem similar to many others around the world: the enormity of the Indian context here merely accen- tuates the contrasts in the picture, highlighting some sociological facts all too often forgotten by students of Jewish tradition.
