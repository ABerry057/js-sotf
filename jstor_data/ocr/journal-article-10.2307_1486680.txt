<plain_text><page sequence="1">Benjamin Harshav. Language in Time of Revolution. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993. xii, 234 pp. The creation of modern Hebrew-the rebirth of ancient Hebrew-was miraculous. Think of all the wretched students who struggle to learn a foreign tongue. Think of the immigrants who do not master the language of their neighbors. Students and immigrants have the advantage of hearing the new language being used. But as Benjamin Harshav asks, "How do you force people suddenly to speak to their children in a language they don't even know themselves?" (p. 104). Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, who became a symbol for the revival of Hebrew, forced himself and his wife, Dvora, to do just that. The first Hebrew child, Ben Tsiyon ("the Son of Zion"), was isolated from everyone but his parents, so he would not be contaminated by a foreign language and, for that purpose, Dvora was forbidden to hire a maid and had to do all the household chores by herself. No wonder the child did not speak at all until the age of 4 (Did he ever hear a real conversation?). (p. 107) 2. After this review was submitted for publication, another part of Friedlander's book appeared in English translation. See Y. Friedlander, "The Controversy between M. L. Lilienblum and the World of the Yeshivot as Depicted in 'Mishnat Elisha Ben Avuyah' (1878)," in (Chur, 1994), pp. 143-156.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 191 Could a whole society do this? Apparently. "From the Second Aliya (1909-1914) on, almost every new entity created in Eretz-Israel and formu- lating itself as new and cut off from the past, tried to impose the Hebrew language in its framework" (p. 133). Just a few years later, Winston Churchill wrote about the Jewish community of Palestine, "Its business is conducted in Hebrew as a vernacular language, and a Hebrew press serves its needs. It has its distinctive intellectual life and displays considerable economic activity" (p. 149). There is something implausible about this situation. What were the steps leading from the isolation of the Ben-Yehuda household to the thriving community described by Churchill? There were no teams of linguists, anthropologists, sociologists, and historians to describe this unique event as it was taking place. Languages evolve gradually. People do not suddenly make a decision to use a different language. Pidgins develop when people without a common tongue are forced to communicate. A pidgin is based on a single existing language, With heavy borrowings from another language or other languages, and with a reduced vocabulary and a drastically simplified morphology. One definition of pidgin is "a lingua franca with no native speakers." When speakers of a pidgin have children, the language thereby obtains native speakers; from then on it is no longer a pidgin but a creole, and develops as other languages do. Hebrew does not fit this pattern, although there was a time when it had no native speakers. When used by the Ben-Yehuda family, it certainly had a limited vocabulary. Harshav cites as an example Ben-Yehuda asking for a cup of coffee with sugar: "Take that and do that and bring me that and I'll drink" (p. 107). But the morphology of Hebrew, unlike that of a pidgin, is not simple; Hebrew has the same conjugations and declensions it had in ancient times. Pidgins come into existence because of necessity, sometimes tragic necessity, as happened when the slave trade uprooted native speakers and placed them in an alien environment. Speaking Hebrew, on the other hand, was a matter of choice in the days of the Second Aliyah, even if we grant that the birth of modern Hebrew was a necessity-a necessary prerequisite to the creation of the State of Israel. Israeli Hebrew is partly a reincarnation and partly a new invention. Not only is the morphology Semitic, but so is the basic vocabulary and what Harshav calls the "microsyntax": "the coordination of verb and noun; the use of the definite article, prepositions, and connectives; the genitive phrases" (pp.</page><page sequence="3">192 BOOK REVIEWS 171-172). On the other hand, the macrosyntax-the coordination of tenses, the structure of paragraphs-and the international words are European. Israel is part of the global village, dominated by Western technology and habits of thought, which in turn are reflected in the idioms and style of newspapers, books, and everyday speech. An Israeli can read Ecclesiastes more easily than a Chinese can read Confucius or an American can read Beowulf--or even Chaucer. Israeli Hebrew does not correspond to any particular period of ancient Hebrew; it is not an updated version of biblical or mishnaic Hebrew, although it contains elements of both. Nevertheless, the modern language is closer to the linguistic structure of the ancient texts than would have been possible had Hebrew developed at the speed with which languages change when they have native speakers. Despite European lexical items, style, and turns of phrase, despite the artificiality of its rebirth, Hebrew is very close to its remote past. Hebrew phonology, morphology, and syntax would have changed in any event; internationalization would have occurred no matter what. For all its deviations from its older stages, modern Hebrew-the native language of most Israelis-is miraculously close to the language of the Bible. Harshav places this extraordinary phenomenon in the context of the revolutionary developments affecting the Jews of Europe since, roughly, the year 1882. The title of his book reflects the fact that Zionism was one of many revolutionary phenomena, including socialism, assimilation, and emigration. Rapid social, political, and demographic changes put an end to an earlier period. Thus, in the greater Poland, especially between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries where two-thirds of world Jewry was concentrated, the Jews in fact had administrative autonomy (symbolized by a kind of Jewish parliament, the "Council of the Four Lands"). They had their own religious, legal, and administrative system, tax collection (for the King or noble landowners and for themselves), professional organizations, societies for mutual help, medicine, burial societies; moreover, they had a separate trilingual culture (in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Yiddish) with a separate library of texts, a separate educational network, an ethical movement, and a separate conceptual world. (p. 33) Language in the Time of Revolution is a title that may mislead some readers into thinking that the book is about how revolutionary governments enact orthographic changes or introduce new forms of address, such as "comrade." Both the title and the structure of the book, however, reflect Harshav's</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 193 argument. Part I is called "The Modem Jewish Revolution: An Essay on the History of Culture and Consciousness." Part II is "The Revival of the Hebrew Language: Anatomy of a Social Revolution." Part III, "Sources on the Hebrew Language Revival," translated from the Hebrew by Barbara Harshav, consists of essays, dating from 1918 to 1937, by Rachel Katznelson, Yitzhak Tabenkin, Berl Katznelson, Yosef Klausner, and Tsvi Shats. The miracle of modem Hebrew, however, like all miracles, remains unexplained. Societies have been known to restructure themselves in radical ways. Migrations, linguistic contact, and political developments have led millions of individuals to change languages. The uniqueness of the birth of Israeli Hebrew cannot entirely be due to something as commonplace as revolutionary disruption. The day-to-day development of Hebrew as a spoken language is no longer a phenomenon that can be observed, described, and measured. We can be grateful for the reports cited by Harshav, but we cannot recapture the moment.
