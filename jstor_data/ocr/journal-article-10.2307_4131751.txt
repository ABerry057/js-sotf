In his Kabbalah: New Perspectives, Moshe Idel envisioned a reordering of scholarly inquiry into Kabbalah, in which the intellectual divisions between the world of the traditional kabbalists and academic scholars would be bridged. The writings of Moshe Halamish, while not conceived with the specific purpose of ful- filling such a mandate, nonetheless create a realm of discourse in which tradition- al models are, at least, not outraged. Halamish writes in such a way that a dialogue with the traditional purveyors of Kabbalah may be at least envisioned. Like many scholars emerging from Israel in the last century, Halamish ini- tially devoted himself to addressing unanswered questions and unexplored gaps in the body of writings left by Gershom Scholem. In carving up of turf that charac- terizes the structure of the "Jerusalem School" of Kabbalah study, Halamish has concentrated on prayer. His authority and expertise in that area has been amply demonstrated in the recent Hebrew anthology of his collected writings on the sub- ject: Kabbalah: In Liturgy, Halakhah and Customs (Ramat Gan: Bar Ilan Univer- sity Press, 2000). This volume, The Kabbalah in North Africa, seeks to fill another gap in con- temporary scholarship. Recent allegations of an anti-Eastern bias among scholars of Kabbalah remain undemonstrated and probably unfair. The truth, however, is that the religious communities of the non-Ashkenazic world remain relatively un- served by scholarly studies, with the exception of the oeuvre of Meir Benyahu and the studies of specific figures by younger scholars such as Boaz Huss and Yoni Garb. There is an absence of comprehensive treatments such as Jacob Elbaum's Openness and Insularity: Late Sixteenth Century Jewish Literature in Poland and Ashkenaz (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1990) detailing the religious life and intellectual activity of large areas of the Sephardic world. This overview seeks to illuminate the contributions of the mystical commu- nities of Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria-an area that was no less a cradle of mys- tical thought and practice than the Pale of Settlement. As an introduction and guide to the flourishing of Kabbalah in those communities, from its origins to the pre- sent, this modest work is indispensable. Halamish describes the ways in which mystical ideas entered North Africa and traces the growth of different mystical cir- cles and the communities that nurtured them. He lists as many mystical figures as possible, from illustrious figures such as Shimon Lavi and Abraham Azulai to shadowy figures alluded to in a few emendations to a single manuscript. He de- scribes the paths through which the ideas of the Safed Kabbalists Isaac Luria and Shalom Sharcabi were introduced into various North African communities, and the extent of their reception among different circles of mystics. Halamish describes the ways in which kabbalistic ideas and practices shaped and influenced the daily life and folk religion of different North African commu- nities. He shines a strong and vivid light on the community in Djerba, an island off the coast of Tunisia that was predominantly Jewish. In separate chapters, Halamish surveys the effects of mysticism on daily life in the different Jewish communities of the cosmopolitan cities on the coast as well as the wilder reaches of the Atlas 387</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Mountains. He discusses the impact of Kabbalah on Jewish Law (halakhah) and ritual. In addition to entering daily life through those conventional venues, there was an efflorescence of practical Kabbalah in the form of shamanistic and healing practices and an explosion of gravesite pilgrimage after the practices of the Safed kabbalists. There was prodigious composition of scriptural commentaries, theo- retical literature, religious poetry, prayers and devotional tikkunim, or specialized rites. In these chapters, a picture emerges of a series of communities in which Kab- balah served as the popular religion, being incorporated into Jewish life with less of the self-consciousness or angst of communities across the Mediterranean. Although it only begins to scratch the surface of its subject, this modest vol- ume should point scholars towards many rich and hitherto neglected areas of fur- ther research. For that reason alone, it deserves the widest possible circulation. Pinchas Giller University of Judaism Los Angeles, California</page></plain_text>
