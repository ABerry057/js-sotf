JOSEPH PERL AS A HISTORIAN OF JEWISH DIVORCE LAW by Nancy Sinkoff A typographic error appears on page 295 of "The Maskil, the Convert, and the "Agunah: Joseph Perl as a Historian of Jewish Divorce Law," by Nancy Sinkoff, in the November 2003 issue of AJS Review [2003:27(2), pp. 281-299]. In the in- dented paragraph from Joseph Perl's manuscript, the original Hebrew phrase "vekhatav"-which is noted in footnote 61 as appearing in the text itself-was elided, leaving an underline with no text. The passage containing the missing He- brew phrase follows in its entirety: We see, for example, that Rabbi Joseph Karo, in his Commentary on the Tur, 'Even ha-'Ezer, 123 (Beit Joseph), states: 'One should not permit the man to write the writ with his own hands.' In the aforementioned work, the Set Table, in contrast-which the same rabbi established as a norm for Israel-this way of making divorce more difficult is not included. Rabbi Moses Isserles, how- ever, gave this particular restriction [of divorce] a respected place in his com- ments on the aforementioned Set Table. It appears that Karo, as an Eastern Rabbi, in whose country polygamy still ruled, despite the aforementioned ban by Rabbi Gershom, did not want to establish a restriction so contrary to the Pentateuch's expression an_! as a norm in his work. Rabbi Isserles, in con- trast, who lived in the same century, but in Krak6w, where monogamy had been established already since the 11th century by Rabbi Gershom, granted a place to this restriction [on divorce] in his additions to the Set Table because it took away the right of an irascible man to move his wife out of the house for no reason. 213</page></plain_text>
