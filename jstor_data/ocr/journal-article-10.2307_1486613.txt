<plain_text><page sequence="1">104 BOOK REVIEWS Nathan Rotenstreich. Immediacy and Its Limits: A Study in Martin Buber's Thought. Chur: Harwood Academic Publishers, 1991. 118 pp. Throughout this challenging monograph Nathan Rotenstreich recognizes that Martin Buber himself eschewed philosophical analysis and was primarily "an explorer of human nature." He contends, however, that research into the philosophical and cultural influences on Buber illuminates his thinking. Rotenstreich's convincing arguments on Buber's differences from Hermann Cohen, his affirmations of similarity notwithstanding, the distinction between Buber and Kierkegaard, and an extended critique of Buber's interpretation of Spinoza, proves the contention well founded. A more controversial proposal claims that Buber's own ambivalence toward philosophy caused him to fail either to distinguish adequately between philosophy and religion or to create "a coherent interpretation of religion and religiosity in his own terms" (p. 98). This proposition forms the backbone of Rotenstreich's argument. He notes as Buber's "problematic contribution to modern thought" his attempt to employ an I-Thou structure discovered in human experience to the relationship between the divine and the human (or "conversely, his transposition of it from the religious context to the interhuman one" [p. 104]). The contribution of this book lies in raising philosophical questions about the ontology implied about human encounters and the applicability of that ontology to religious experience. Many previous thinkers have noted the ethical dilemma Buber's thought faces. By rooting his description of the I-Thou relationship in the facts of human existence, Buber loses an ethical dimension. He can trace the origins of I-Thou meeting, the portals by which one enters I-Thou being, and the significance of I-Thou encounter. Yet, as Rotenstreich suggests, Buber wants to do more. He "conjoins" a descriptive identification of I-Thou meetings with a "normative presentation of what ought to guide conduct in the scope of interhuman relations" (p. 71). Philosophers expect a more precise delineation of the grounds of the "ought" and of the source of obligation than Buber gives. Rotenstreich notes that Buber emphasizes the human ability to "respond" as the basis for his normative demand without recognizing that "responsibility" as accountability needs a firmer foundation. Buber's ontology of the interpersonal underlies his Zionism, as several interpreters besides Rotenstreich have recognized. Any comprehensive study of Buber will conclude, as does Rotenstreich, that Buber's Zionism represents</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 105 an "attempt to integrate additional aspects of the immediacy of human experience into the spectrum of his thinking, as in this specific case man's attachment to a place or a land" (p. 101). Rotenstreich, however, criticizes Buber's extrapolation from the experience of the individual to that of the group. A nation takes shape not in response to immediate I-Thou meetings but out of the consciousness of history-and history is more than life. This critique, however, misses its mark. Buber recognized the realm of "Spirit" in which cultural powers meet the individual with their own demand for relationship. Israel as a nation takes shape from the I-Thou meeting which occurs in the immediacy of those spiritual beings in relationship to a community of individuals. A link with an intergenerational spirit may be as immediate and powerful as a meeting with one's own contemporaries. Rotenstreich's critique of Buber's explication of religious language has more to recommend it. Buber, Rotenstreich points out, uses philosophical terms to describe the deity. He cannot help but employ terms such as "absolute" and "creator." These terms, however, fit uncomfortably with a description of God as a "Thou." Rotenstreich reminds readers of several problems in Buber's discussions of the divine: is the relation with God the primary fact with the interhuman relationship secondary, or is the relationship with God a result of the interhuman meeting? is the Eternal Thou the guarantor of I-Thou meeting or the ideal motivating the willingness to enter such a meeting? is relationship to the divine as active a human decision as reflectiveness, or is withdrawal from God the only active part human beings play? can a self-sufficient divinity enter into reciprocity with a finite creature, and if so, how it is explainable? is the I-Thou relationship experiential, and if so, how can experience apply to the divine absolute? Rotenstreich is not the first to raise questions like these about Buber's formulations. Buber's response would be that he has not tried to offer a coherent philosophy but rather to indicate elements of reality of which moderns are often unaware. Rotenstreich addresses this answer. He sees the philosophical quest for clarity not as a discontinuity with human interrelationship, but as an extension of it. Human beings inevitably create conceptual frameworks by which to understand themselves and their reality. Immediacy is not the full sum of human reality. Rotenstreich concludes that "We are beyond immediacy-not by a deliberate step but intrinsically" (p. 112). This point needs examination but also suggests an important aspect of human development. Buber offers modern thinkers a point of departure for</page><page sequence="3">106 BOOK REVIEWS their own investigations. He provides road signs they can follow as they seek to understand human psychology, the products of human culture such as the Bible and later Jewish religion, and even philosophical concepts and their contemporary relevance. That Buber himself avoided an investigation of all the avenues opened by his thinking does not excuse later thinkers from studying them. The philosophical quest for clarity may draw on Buber's thought, demand a greater rigor of it than he himself advanced, and modify his thinking accordingly. Rotenstreich's critique should stimulate such reconsideration of Buber's basic categories. S. Daniel Breslauer University of Kansas Lawrence, Kans.</page></plain_text>
