Running through it all was his profound devotion to numerous disciplines that would help explicate and enrich our understanding of the Jewish experience in both its historical and its cultural framework. From Patai's pen came books on mythology, folklore, alchemy, the Bible, history, biography, and autobiography, to mention only the most important genres. Patai's long and productive life, straddling the twentieth century, testifies to a mentality, ability, and stamina shared by only a few great scholars in this century, individuals who, like Patai, felt little hampered by narrow concepts of specialization and followed their interests wherever they led them, and who achieved enviable results in many areas. Jadtd al-Islam (Arabic for "New Muslims") may well be the last book to reach us from Raphael Patai, but one cannot be certain that this prolific and versatile scholar did not have other surprises in press at the time of his death. Seemingly a new book, some of the material in Jadid al-Islam (i.e., chaps. 24 and 25) is based on earlier research published in Hebrew in the late 1940s and the 1950s. An English translation of these chapters, as well as chapters 13, 14, and 17 of the present book, was published earlier as Part III of On Jewish Folklore (Detroit, 1983). Nevertheless, the republication of all these materials here, in a much better articulated historical context, is not superfluous, because the events and customs they describe are far from well known in the Jewish world in general and in the world of Jewish learning in particular. Jadid al-Islam is a volume in the Jewish Folklore and Anthropology Series, a series devoted to subjects dear to Patai's heart, with whose genesis he was probably involved personally, and to which he contributed four other significant volumes (two as collaborator). This latest book by Patai is devoted to the study of the Jewish community of Mashhad, Iran (spelled "Meshhed," colloquially, through the book and in its title). Forced to convert to the Shi'i form of Islam in 1839, the members of the Jewish community of Mashhad succeeded in preserving their Jewish identity clandestinely while living their outward lives as Shi'i Muslims. In time both Jews and Muslims came to refer to the conversions as Allahdad, which can mean both "God gave" and God's justice," a term most likely coined by Muslims. Unlike two earlier periods of forced conversions endured by Iranian Jews, which were shorter in duration (seven years and seven months, respectively),' the Jews of Mashhad lived as anusim ("forced converts") for almost a century and developed a distinctive 1.

They bore Muslim names and celebrated Muslim holidays and customs, yet the Jews of Mashhad nevertheless preserved almost intact, perhaps more so than any other Jewish diaspora community in similar straits, their communal identity. While deflecting Muslim vigilance, these anusim went to great lengths to foster and nurture their adherence not only to the fundamental tenets, but also, and to a large extent, to the halakhic minutiae, of Judaism. The survival of the community was undoubtedly helped by the fact that its duplicitous religious character came to be tolerated and even accepted, after the first generation or so, by the Muslims among whom they lived. Jadtd al-Islam is based on oral testimony collected in the mid-1940s from Mashhad Jews who had relocated to Israel in the earlier part of this century, notably Farajullah Nasrullayoff, the head of the Jewish community of Mashhad in Jerusalem, his son Yohanan, who translated his father's narratives into Hebrew for Patai, and other members of their extended family and friends. Herein lies both the strength and the weakness of Patai's book. On the one hand, like a first-rate anthropologist, Patai collected authentic narratives as best as he could. However, he did so without knowing the language of his interlocutors (Farsi), solely through the medium of translation. Through these prisms it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to make certain that the details and/or embellishments of the narratives were entirely reliable. On the other hand, we have no reason to doubt the broad outlines and major details of the narratives Patai collected. Fully aware of the pitfalls of his methodology, Patai made commendable efforts to double-check the narratives, especially the Allahdad, by collecting a considerable amount of corroborating information from non-Jewish sources, such as Russian and British travelers, and the Jewish apostate Joseph Wolff (pp. 32 ff.). Understandably, given that Patai was not a specialist in Islamic studies, he did not investigate local Muslim chronicles or fatwas that might have mentioned the events he describes. This remains an important missing dimension for a critical appraisal of the Allahdad. The first part of Patai's work also sheds some light on the phenomenon of Jewish attraction to Sufism (chap. 3) and Baha'ism (chap. 6), important historical and cultural phenomena that Jewish and Muslim scholars continue to neglect. The second and third parts ofJadtd al-Islam are a treasure-trove of Chronicle (1617-1662) (New York, 1986); idem, Iranian Jewry During the Afghan Invasion: The Kitab-i Sar Guzasht-i Kashan ofBabdaf Ibn Farhad (1721-1731) (Stuttgart, 1990).</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 411 information on Jewish anusi customs in Mashhad: life-cycle events, folktales, secret schools, religious customs, and so forth, all of which testify to the determination of the Jews of Mashhad to preserve their Jewish faith. In Jadid al-Islam, Raphael Patai once again made a serious contribution to a neglected field in Jewish study, namely the study of Iranian Jewry in general and of the Jewish community of Mashhad in particular. He provided us with valuable building blocks, which, but for him, would have remained uncollected. Patai's work has thus provided important materials for the historical reconstruction and evaluation of the experiences of an important Iranian Jewish community. Vera B.
