Cohen's extensive study of circumcision offers an examination of the subject from an entirely new perspective?the exclusion of women from the 374</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews commandment that is said to induct "Jews" into the covenant?as its title suggests. Through an investigation of the question, "What has it meant at different times in history that Jewish women are not circumcised?" Cohen presents not only a history of circumcision but also a history of the Jewish-Christian debate surround ing this issue. Cohen's book does not seem to purport to a particular argument but rather offers a comprehensive study of the literature that examines circumcision from this particular lens. The book is divided into two parts. The first part contains four loosely connected chapters that present the history of male circumcision in Jewish sources, give a brief look at whether Jewish women were ever circum cised, present the Christian arguments against circumcision based on the exclu sion of women (and the responses Christians had to provide to explain Genesis 17), and investigate why the rabbinic sages ignored the "problem" of women's exclusion from this covenantal sphere of ritual, whereas medieval rabbinic scho lars did engage the question. The second part of the book is composed of four historical arguments that answer the titular question "Why aren't Jewish women circumcised?" These arguments include the claim of women's inferiority versus the "celebration of manhood" (which Cohen considers the "real" answer, as he writes in his preface) and the opposite, namely, the claim of women's superiority, as well as arguments in between these two extremes. In the midst of these chapters, Cohen explores some of the subsidiary questions raised by his titular question, including: Who is a Jew? Are women indeed con sidered a part of the covenant? Does circumcision have a special status as a com mandment, or is it just one in the list of 613? What exactly is the function of circumcision: covenant, sacrament, mark of slavery, or mark of righteousness? These and other overarching questions that have vexed Jews and Christians? and in some ways continue to do so?are woven in interesting ways throughout the book. As a whole, the book seems to be a study of the nonegalitarian or (gender) exclusive nature of circumcision. For example, Cohen devotes a chapter to the med ieval argument that Jewish women are not circumcised because they have, by nature, the equivalent sign of servitude (menstruation) marked on their bodies, or because they are commanded to do analogous mitzvoth, such as niddah, challah, and the lighting of candles on the Sabbath, traditionally known as the triad of women's mitzvoth. In this particular chapter (as well as elsewhere in the book), Cohen incorporates his previous work on the relation between blood and circumci sion. Despite the material offered here, which introduces the ennobling but obviously apologetic possibility that women are already "perfect," whereas men must be perfected, Cohen states in the preface of the book (xiv) that the "real" answer to the question of why Jewish women are not circumcised is "the answer that is implicit in all of rabbinic culture from antiquity until recent times, and in some circles even to our own day," namely, that it "bespeaks their secondary, anom alous, problematic place in the rabbinic hierarchy." That is, Cohen accepts the argu ment that "the non-circumcision of women bespeaks their exclusion and subordination" (142) and elevates it to an explanatory model for the cultural work that circumcision does. At the same time, he suggests, interestingly and 375</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews perhaps problematically, that the rabbinic matrilineal principle makes up for this exclusion. As Cohen puts it, "Teleologically considered, however, the matrilineal principle can be seen as systemic compensation to women for their secondary status in rabbinic culture as a whole" (141). One wonders what he means by "tele ology" here, but surely this suggestion will engender more discussion about gender issues in Jewish culture. Cohen's book is written in an accessible style, characteristic of his work, that will appeal to both scholars and lay people. He has clearly gained mastery over a vast amount of literature, and he is willing to admit when he does not fully under stand the intent of a given text or is unfamiliar with the full scope of available material. Though I do not always agree with his ultimate readings, regarding the sources that he presents, his arguments are always well presented and clear and respond directly to the texts that he presents, leading the reader through each individual source and its implications. One of Cohen's great accomplishments in this book rests on his ability to engage the arguments of both Christians and Jews and to understand what is at stake for each, as well as how they construct their arguments. In some cases, when Christians represent themselves in "discussion" with (probably fictitious) Jews, Cohen attempts to imagine both how the Christian writer himself under stands circumcision and how that same Christian comprehends the Jewish interpretation of circumcision that he represents through his Jewish "foil." Cohen is able to lay out these perspectives skillfully and cogently. Some confusion does emerge regarding the points that Cohen makes during the course of the book. For example, although it becomes clear at the end of the book that Cohen differentiates between legal texts and mystical texts in his discus sion of whether circumcision makes a Jew a Jew, this is not clear in the body of the book. Sentences such as "some medieval Jewish thinkers emphasize circumci sion's unique status as the embodiment of the covenant, others deemphasize it, but all alike see circumcision as a hallmark of Jewishness" (54) lead the reader to the (incorrect) conclusion that the association of circumcision with Jewishness is more widespread than the mystical tradition, and the distinction between this attitude and the attitude in the legal material is not made entirely clear until the conclusion of the book. The most disappointing aspect of Cohen's book emerges in his last two pages, in which he advances an argument for circumcision that does not seem to draw on his material at all. In these pages, Cohen questions the three main contemporary arguments against circumcision: that it is no longer considered an improvement of health; that it is mutilation; and that society should prohibit male circumcision if it prohibits female circumcision. Though the book discusses the problematic nature of the historical disparity between the sexes coming to the foreground in this ritual practice and offers a history of the interpretation of circumcision, the conclusion defends the ritual but refuses to carry forward the implications of his historical research in any way. Cohen's evaluation of the contemporary debate falls exceedingly short of the scholarship he presents in the remainder of the book. Despite this ultimate disappointment, this takes place over only two pages, and the book as a whole is a wonderful read and gathers a great number of 376</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews sources, together with skilled analysis, to contribute to the growing conversation on this topic.
