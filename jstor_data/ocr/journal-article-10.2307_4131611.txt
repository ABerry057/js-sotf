Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. x, 164 pp. In this very balanced and thought-provoking book, Shelly Matthews studies a series of Greek and Roman texts concerning Gentile women of high standing who were attracted to Judaism and Christianity. These texts, in particular Josephus' nov- elistic conversion and expulsion story in Antiquities 18.65-84, are well known and often discussed, but they have rarely been set into a wider framework. Matthews ar- 314</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews gues that Josephus, Luke, "and other religious apologists," in recounting episodes of upper-class women's associations with their communities, followed a rhetorical strategy. These authors were anxious to depict their respective communities as com- patible with Greco-Roman culture. The existence of pagan upper-class women sup- porting the Jewish cause could demonstrate such a compatibility. Matthews is well aware of the numerous derogatory statements by such authors as Tacitus and Plutarch, who criticize women's involvement in politics and religion. Jewish and Christian use of the sympathetic Gentile woman as an apologetic figure, one might think, could have a boomerang effect. Matthews tries to solve this problem by point- ing out that women in Greco-Roman antiquity often played an active role in reli- gious performances and that this role was often accepted. The narratives of Josephus and Luke thus reflect a historical phenomenon. The book begins with a somewhat oddly placed passage from Juvenal (Sat. 6.542-47). In his famously misogynous sixth satire, Juvenal depicts an old Jew- ish woman, whom he describes as an interpreter of the laws of Jerusalem, who "tells you dreams of any kind you please for the smallest of coins." For Matthews this old woman is not a mendicant, but a professional missionary and thus a good example of ancient Jewish proselytism. Although the sketchy literary evidence re- garding Jewish proselytism often allows for controversial interpretations, Juvenal's Jewish woman hardly provides a good argument in favor of a Jewish mission. In the first chapter, "Crimes of Passion: Religion, Sex and State Subversion in Antiquities 18:65-84," Matthews provides a thorough reading of Josephus's ac- count of the expulsion of Isis worshippers and Jews from Rome in 19 CE. In both cases of expulsion it is a highborn woman who is the source of the trouble for both the Jews and the Isis community. Comparing this text with accounts of the same events in Tacitus and Suetonius, Matthews convincingly shows how Josephus de- flects accusations of sexual misconduct concerning the Jews by specifically refer- encing the sexual misconduct among the Isis practitioners. Josephus reacts to a pattern in Roman literature that tends to fuse subversive religious and sexual ac- tivity. Moreover, Matthews argues, these texts suggest elite Roman anxiety about the missionary influence of foreign religions in Rome. One may very well disagree on the last point. Erich Gruen in Diaspora (Berkeley 2002, published after Matthews' book) questions such an anxiety on the Roman side. Neither Tacitus nor Suetonius call the Jews who were expelled proselytes, let alone mention prose- lytism as the cause of this action. In Chapter 2, "Ladies' Aid: Gentile Noblewomen as Saviors and Benefac- tors in the Antiquities," Matthews describes how Josephus portrays a large num- ber of Gentile upper-class women as advocating Jewish causes (e.g., Nero's wife Poppaea Sabina; Augustus' wife Livia; Helena, the Queen ofAdiabene; and Agrip- pina the Younger). Matthews correctly notes that Josephus' presentation of politi- cally active and influential Gentile women clashes with his reading of biblical matriarchs and the women of the Hasmonean and Herodian dynasties in the An- tiquities and the Jewish War. There women's political freedom is as little endorsed as, say, in Tacitus. This raises the above-mentioned question of whether Josephus's portrayal of Gentile women who acted on behalf of the Jews might not be at vari- ance with the goals of Jewish apologetics. Matthews is well aware of this tension. 315</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews She solves it-hesitantly, though-by pointing to evidence of the existence of such influential noblewomen, for example, an inscription from Aphrodisias that re- counts the influence of Livia's advocacy on behalf of the Samians. In the end, Jose- phus's apologetic strategy may be more than wishful thinking. Even more typical and for Matthews' purpose more important is the case of Plotina, Trajan's wife, who-at least according to the Acts of the Pagan Martyrs-supported the Jews (Plotina is discussed in Chapter 3). Chapter 3, "'More than a few Greek Women of High Standing': 'God-Fear- ing' Noblewomen in Acts," discusses the role of prominent Gentile women, whom Paul encounters at several instances in his missionary journeys (Acts 13:50; 17:4; 17:12). Matthews includes here an unnecessarily lengthy discussion of the term "God-fearer," only to conclude (rightly so) that the term is not a fiction of Luke (as Kraabel had argued), but actually existed in history. Matthews shows that Luke's presentation of prominent women follows the same pattern as in Josephus. Luke un- derscores the role of upper-class Gentile women, while limiting the sphere of ac- tion of women in other contexts. As in the case of Josephus, Matthews wonders about the efficacy of such apologetics. Given the resentment of the Greco-Roman literati toward politically active women, why would an apologetic author depict Gentile women who patronize, and sometimes affiliate with his community? As in the preceding chapter, Matthews suggests that a partial explanation might lie in the fact that the phenomenon of elite women's benefaction was not just a fancy. Who then would endorse religiously active women as they are presented in Josephus and Luke? The fourth and last chapter of this short book, "First Converts: Acts 16 and the Legitimating Function of High-Standing Women in Missionary Propaganda," provides an answer to this question. Screening a wide range of texts (from Euripides' Bacchae to Philo's Therapeutae), Matthews identifies a line of argument in Greco-Roman texts concerning the special function of women in mis- sionary religions. In fact, women's religious function in the Greco-Roman world was often viewed as proper and virtuous. The potential audience of Josephus and Luke, one might add, was therefore as divided with regard to the religious role of women as these two authors were themselves. This relates to a further question, of- ten raised in recent years in Josephus studies: is "apologetics" really the right term for Josephus and Luke? Rene S.
