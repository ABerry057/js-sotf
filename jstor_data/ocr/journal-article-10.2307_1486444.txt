Tel-Aviv: Tel-Aviv University Press, 1981. 116 pp. Bibliographical and general indices, 15 plates, I table. Moshe Gil, one of the most interesting and original contemporary scholars of Jewish history in the medieval Islamic world, has brought out a short but pithy and thought-provoking book on a famous Persian Karaite family, the Tustaris, that rose to the pinnacles of financial and political power in Fatimid Egypt during the first half of the eleventh century. The book developed in part as an independent spin-off from a larger project on the land of Israel under the Muslims during the period extending from the Arab conquest to the Crusades that has occupied Professor Gil for several years and has resulted in a much larger book that is scheduled to appear shortly. The book opens with a useful summary of the scholarly literature on the Tustaris that has appeared over the past century, with particular reference to the writings of Poznanski, Mann, Fischel, and Goitein (pp. 13-19). This historiographic introduction is followed by a valuable historical back- ground sketch depicting the westward demographic shift within the Muslim world that brought both Rabbanite and sectarian Jews - together with members of other faiths - from southwestern Iran and southern Iraq to Baghdad in the late eighth century and to the Mediterranean basin during the tenth century. Gil emphasizes the special role played by Jewish mer- chants from Ahwaz and Tustar (Shustar) in the international commerce of the later Sasanian period and of early Islamic times. He connects these mer- chants with the famous Radhanites mentioned by the ninth-century geo- grapher Ibn Khurradadhbeh. Concerning these merchants, Gil has already written an article that has provided the freshest look in more than half a century on a subject that has elicited the spilling of a goodly quantity of scholarly ink.' Turning to the Tustaris themselves, Gil painstakingly traces in chronolo- gical order the testimony concerning the early generation of the family found in the Arabic literary and Geniza sources (pp. 23-29). He makes the interesting and - to this reviewer's mind - not unreasonable suggestion that the big Geniza merchant families, such as the Ibn 'Awkals, the Tustaris, 1.

He also postulates some important family lines for the Bne Sunbat (Bne Sahlan), leading Jewish communal figures, business associates, and perhaps relations by marriage of the Tustaris. After reconstructing the Tustaris' familial roots mainly upon the basis of Geniza documents, Gil turns to the sources dealing with their economic activities (pp. 29-37). It is interesting to note that the Tustaris' lucrative trade in luxury items, which is most commonly mentioned in the Islamic sources, appears only as a small part of their commercial enterprises in the Geniza records. Three principal areas of activity stand out: (1) overseas transport in unusually large quantities by Geniza standards; (2) import- export ties with the Abbasid territories; (3) dealing in large sums of money, transfer of funds, and the holding of deposits. The section dealing with the political careers of the brothers Abu NaSr Fadl (Hesed) and Abu Sa'd Ibrahim (Avraham) al-Tustari is based more than any other chapter upon medieval Muslim writers and adheres to the picture that was already well known. Only passing mention is given to Abu 'Ali- Hasan (Yefet), the son of Abu Sa'd, who for the final three months of 1064 held the vizierate of Fatimid Egypt, and who - according to the Arab historian Ibn Muyassar - converted to Islam. In his search through the jumbled documents of the Geniza, Gil has discovered a possible grandson of Abu 'Ali who was taken prisoner by the Franks and held for ransom at the time of the First Crusade (p. 65). The evidence, however, is by no means clear - as Gil readily points out. But even if the young prisoner was indeed the vizier's grandson, this would not necessarily contradict - as Gil seems to feel it would - the report concerning Abu 'Ali's defection from Judaism, since he may not have been joined by all the members of his family in apos- tasy, particularly if he had grown sons at the time or converted under pres- sure or out of political expediency. The section dealing with the family's involvement in Jewish communal affairs both within the Fatimid realm and beyond is filled with new and more detailed information (pp. 44-57). Though Karaites, the Tustaris served the Rabbanite yeshivot of Iraq and Palestine as well as their sectarian brethren. As the subtitle of the book indicates, Gil takes up the question of whether the Tustaris were regular Karaites or belonged to a special current within the factious sect. The tenth-century Karaite encyclopedist al-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 125 Qirqisani mentions a subsect called the Dasatira ("Tustaris"), who rejected the mainstream Karaite principle of ma'qul (individual exegesis of the bibli- cal text). Gil answers the question by a highly impressive line of reasoning in favor of a special subsect on the basis of the dates of a document that belong to an alternative Karaite calendrical reckoning. There is a valuable appendix at the end of the book comprising six Geniza documents in Arabic with accompanying annotations, Hebrew translations, and facsimiles. The book is throughout clear and well-written, both careful and stimu- lating. Two very minor philological points with which this reviewer was not in full agreement: (1) nazar, a technical term of kalamic vocabulary, is perhaps better translated as "theological speculation" than as halakha (p. 23), and (2) bullo was "an expensive outfit comprising two or more articles of clothing"2 rather than a single beged bagigi (p. 33). These minor points, however, in no way detract from the mastery of highly varied sources, lan- guages, and scripts exhibited in this original and valuable contribution to medieval Jewish history.
