Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2005. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001104 At the start of World War II, a small delegation of the militant arm of Ze'ev Jabotinsky's Revisionist Zionist movement (the Irgun) arrived in the United States from Europe and Palestine. Between the group's arrival in 1939 and its dissolution in 1948, the six members raised funds for the Irgun, created several organizations with large numbers of participants, and initiated publicity campaigns that pro moted a Jewish homeland and rescue efforts for European Jews. Judith Tydor Baumel's book, The "Bergson Boys " and the Origins of Contemporary Zionist Militancy, tells the astonishing story of this group and its legacy in American Jewish and American history. Baumel contends that the Irgun delegation, named after its leader, Peter Bergson (the adopted name of Hillel Kook), innovated new strategies for raising consciousness about Jewish concerns and pioneered ethnic protest movements that anticipated the rise of identity politics in the fifties and sixties. The book traces the development of the organizations started by the members of the delegation while they served in the United States: the American Friends of a Jewish Palestine, the Committee for a Jewish Army of Palestine and Stateless Jews, and the Emergency Committee to Save the Jews of Europe. Extensive personal interviews and archival sources provide an exhaustive and detailed window into internal group dynamics and personal relationships. Baumel's exploration of the group's achievements is distinguished from other accounts (such as Rafael Medoff's Militant Zionism in America: The Rise and Impact of the Jabotinsky Movement in the United States, 1926-1948) by her sen sitivity to the importance of the Irgun delegation's organizational structure. In par ticular, she highlights the emissaries' ability to quickly change strategic direction, to reach out to a broad range of unexpected partners, and to create organizations focused on very specific objectives. At times, however, the organizational theory on which Baumel relies to illustrate this overlooked aspect of the delegation's work distracts from the book's narrative flow. Baumel complements her focus on the internal dynamics of the Irgun del egation by exploring the external aspects of the group's work as well. She inves tigates the most visible and controversial aspect of the delegation's work?its efforts to raise the visibility (both inside and outside the Jewish community) of the plight of European Jewry and the humanitarian imperative of rescuing refu gees. These newcomers to the American scene rejected the policy adopted by most other leaders during the war. American Jewish leaders considered backroom connections and personal relationships with President Franklin D. Roosevelt as the most effective strategy for raising Jewish concerns. Frustrated by this "sha-sha" approach, the emissaries paid for advertisements that criticized government pol icies in mainstream newspapers and sought the involvement of non-Jewish poli ticians and leaders. Embracing this strategy created divisive rifts with other American Zionist organizations and also alienated potential allies outside the 193</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Jewish community. At the same time, however, the delegation's strategy created a media blitz and mass support that pressured officials to recognize the particular Jewish plight and yielded adherents from across the political and religious spectrum. This illustrates the fascinating paradox at the core of the Bergson Boys' accomplishments: An ultranationalist group's commitment to the particular needs of European Jews articulated the most humanitarian and universal message during the Holocaust. Moreover, the organizations' partiality toward sec tarian interests over a general call for supporting the war efforts created far closer links with non-Jewish organizations and individuals than those developed by American Zionists who were focused on reconciling support for Jewish national ism with acceptance as Americans. By refraining from pigeonholing the del egation according to assumed ideological positions, Baumel exposes a pragmatic and nuanced range of expressions often hidden by the polarization of Zionist historiography into right-wing and left-wing camps. A more detailed analysis of the specific historical context that contributed to the Irgun delegation's surprising ability to master publicity and organize in a com pletely new setting would have further enriched this study. In particular, what factors explain the link between the delegates' brazen willingness to overturn the "sha-sha" policy of American Jewish leadership and their status as outsiders? Perhaps the members' very lack of experience as Jews in the United States gave them the confidence to adopt a strategy?appealing to a broader audience in an explicitly sectarian fashion?that would have been considered too risky by more established organizations. As newcomers, members of the Irgun delegation had not experienced the high levels of nativism and antisemitism that pervaded the United States in the decade preceding their arrival. Moreover, unlike American Zionist leaders, who developed an allegiance to Roosevelt that might cause them to think twice before criticizing the president's policy, the emissaries remained free of such loyalties. Unfortunately, Baumel does not entertain such speculations about the specific personal or communal circumstances that enabled the delegation to articulate its concerns far more vociferously. Despite this limitation, the book makes important contributions to a period that has already received tremendous attention because of the centrality of the Holocaust in American Jewish and American historiography. Evaluating the relationship between the Bergson Boys' publicity campaign and the creation of the War Refugee Board in 1944 is a central aspect of debates over the role that Jewish activism played in changing U.S. policy. Baumel contextualizes her study in the conflicting opinions offered by scholars such as David Wyman and Harry Feingold. Instead of weighing in on this particular debate, however, Baumel considers alternative criteria for establishing the relevance of this particu lar group. Baumel argues that the impact of the Irgun delegation can be divorced from the question of whether it directly influenced the president or other government officials. The delegation merits recognition for a completely different accomplish ment: pioneering one of the first "ethnic protest" movements in the United States. Positioning a group of Revisionist Zionist visitors from Europe and Palestine as 194</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews paving the way for strategies designed to promote ethnic concerns is an argument worthy of consideration for scholars of both American studies and Zionism. This link illustrates a transatlantic flow of political ideas and strategies for expressing minority interests that challenge the theory of American "exceptionalism." Con sidering these contributions to the formation of American ethnic identity also enlarges the scope of Jewish nationalism's influence beyond Palestine and the establishment of a state. Comparing this early ethnic protest movement with those of other American minority groups, such as Irish Americans, would have added another dimension to our understanding of the place of Zionism in the history of advancing ethnic concerns in the United States. Scholars and lay readers alike have much to learn from the Irgun delegation's pathbreaking push to raise public awareness about pressing Jewish and Zionist causes during World War II. Baumel's innovative approach to considering this group and its legacy ensure that this book will remain a valuable resource.
