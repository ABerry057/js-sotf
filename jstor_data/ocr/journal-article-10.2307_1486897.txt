<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Arye Maimon, in collaboration with Yacob Guggenheim. Germania Judaica. Vol. 3, 1350-1519. Tiibingen: J. C. B. Mohr &amp; Paul Siebeck, 1987. xxx, 769 pp. This extraordinary publication, done under the auspices of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, originated in Berlin in the winter of 1903. That year the newly established Society for the Advancement of Jewish Studies de- cided to undertake a geographic-historical dictionary in which all signifi- cant information about the Jewish life and inhabitants of each and every German locality would be assembled. Inspired by the encyclopedic Gallia Judaica, published by Henry Gross only a few years earlier, the undertaking was intended to cover all of German Jewish history from Roman times until 1815. It was expected that it would be realized in three stages. The first volume was scheduled to reach the year 1238, when Frederick II issued a general privilege to the Jews of the empire; the second was expected to reach the year 1500; while the third was to take care of the rest. Quite expectedly things did not happen as they were scheduled. Only the first part, in two volumes (published in 1917 and 1934), lived up to the original plan. The second part (published in two volumes by Zvi Avneri in 1967) only reached the Black Death, while the third one, now on our desks, only reached the year 1519. Whether there will be a fourth, fifth, or even a sixth part to this monumental effort is not clear from the introduction to this new publica- tion. In the meantime, we have to await the publication of the two other volumes of this part, one of which will bring the dictionary to the letter Z and the other with articles on Germany and the various "Lands." 291</page><page sequence="2">292 BOOK REVIEWS Unlike the Gallia, a one-man enterprise concerned principally with Hebrew documents, the Germania Judaica was envisioned from the very beginning as a collective work, realized by many hands. Indeed almost every Jewish historian of the first half of our century was invited to participate in the project. Arye Maimon and his collaborator, Yacob Guggenheim, con- tinued in this tradition: They extended invitations not only to specialists in Judaica but to many "generalists" (local archivists, professors, and eru- dites), with the result that much of the information assembled comes from "external" sources relating to Jews. Some of these documents come from published works, others directly from archives. No stone, it would seem, was left unturned. As for Hebrew material, in print or in manuscript, its use was facilitated by the access the editors had to the magnificent collections in the National Library of Jerusalem. The materials on the lives and writings of Jewish scholars are presented here, as in previous volumes of the Germania Judaica, in the last part of each article. The editors established a scheme in which questions concerning fiscal aspects of Jewish life were to be followed by evidence about Jewish economic activity, about political and legal status, about taxation and self-government, or about Jewish-Christian relations. This rigid scheme could have been deployed only in the case of big cities (e.g., Augsburg, Bamberg, Erfurt, Cologne, or, especially, Frankfurt a/Main) where enough source material exists. For dozens and hundreds of other localities, in which a Jewish presence existed only sporadically, there was no way to adhere to the scheme; the authors did not have enough data in their arsenal for more than one paragraph or two. The most significant change, most welcome to my mind, in this volume of the Germania Judaica is the material concerning demography. We knew already that the Jewish communities of Germany were reduced severely in size in the hundred and fifty years following the Black Death. With the hard information meticulously assembled by these different authors, we are now able to count, calculate, and achieve a clearer notion of what this demo- graphic decline was all about. Another quantitative question concerns the information about Jewish moneylending-an aspect vital to the understand- ing of Jewish history but rather unamenable to straightforward counting. As for Jewish scholarly achievements-a subject dear to many scholars-it is much simpler now, I believe, to understand the limitation and actual decline of Jewish scholarship in this period. Precarious social and economic condi- tions, as revealed in most of the evidence, seem to have played the greatest role. The story of the Germania Judaica project should serve as an example to</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 293 all. The project had to survive two world wars. On two occasions almost- completed articles were lost, one confiscated by the Nazis. Many authors did not see their work in print, and the editors had to update manuscripts written, at times, a generation and more beforehand. Zvi Avneri and Arye Maimon, who had participated as authors in the first part of the project (known then, in Germany, as Hans Lichtenstein and Herbert Fischer respectively), believed it their duty-once conditions in Israel permitted -to go on and finish what had been started when Moritz Steinschneider (1816-1907) was still alive. Avneri was able to read the last galley proofs of the second part just a few years before he passed away; Maimon dedicated the last years of his life entirely to the undertaking. In achieving their aim they presented us with a magnificent encyclopedic tool, one which will make our work in Jewish studies much easier and more exciting.
