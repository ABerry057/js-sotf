Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1992. xvi, 221 pp. In Steven Kepnes's The Text as Thou: Martin Buber's Dialogical Hermeneu- tics and Narrative Theology, we have a refreshing new treatment of Buber's work. Part I, "Buber's Hermeneutics," charts Buber's development as a hermeneutic artist. Kepnes shows how in The Tales of Rabbi Nachman, Buber is the romantic hermeneut: "Using Dilthey's principles, Buber took old tales into his imagination and attempted to reimagine them, to discover new continuities and to complete the tales differently" (p. 12). In backing up his claim, Kepnes nicely supplies the reader with comparative passages from Buber's translation and from a traditional translation of The Tales.</page><page sequence="2">254 BOOK REVIEWS Kepnes discusses how Buber, in his later work on Hasidic tales and in his biblical writings (including the Buber-Rosenzweig translation of the Bible), came to abandon his romantic hermeneutics for dialogical hermeneutics. What now becomes important to Buber is not "the mind of the author and the free, creative expression of the interpreter" (romantic hermeneutics), but the work of art "and the truth about being it discloses" (dialogical hermeneutics; p. 22). For Buber, to have an I-Thou relationship with a work of art is to reinitiate the creative process; it is to bring that work of art to life again. Kepnes ends part I of his book by constructing a four-step general Buberian hermeneutic method: "Treating the text as a Thou and with the passive attitude of receptive waiting"; "the otherness of the text brings to consciousness the interpreter's own individual and cultural presuppositions and the interpreter wins a distance on these presuppositions which allows him or her to see the world of the text more clearly"; "the interpreter exercises critical distance and employs methods of explanation to analyze the structure and rhetoric of the text"; "the interpreter reflects on the author, who serves as a reminder to reconnect the text to life" (p. 78). This is an admirable construction of a general Buberian hermeneutic method, but what strikes the reader most here is the fact that Kepnes's work would have been much more persuasive had he himself used this method in approaching Buber's work. Yet we never get Kepnes's "own individual and cultural presuppositions" that he brings to Buber's work. We never are privy to Kepnes's I-Thou relationship with Buber's work (though we suspect he has one). He presents Buber's work as if one can present Buber's work and not an interpretation of Buber's work. For example, at one point Kepnes discusses Gershom Scholem's critique of Buber's work on Hasidism. Kepnes's key point is that "it can be argued that Scholem's work is also an interpretation of Hasidism. What we have is not Scholem's objective presentation and Buber's subjective interpretation, but, rather, a conflict of interpretations of Hasidism" (p. 32). Yet what we really have here is Kepnes's interpretation of the Buber-Scholem controversy (and, of course, my reading as well). Kepnes's work in explicating Buber's dialogical hermeneutics would have been more powerful had he depicted his own personal dialogue with Buber's work. In part II, "Buber's Narrative Theology," Kepnes works to show Buber as the narrative theologian of "the middle." Using Buber's 1929 essay</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 255 "Dialogue," Kepnes notices that the narratives in this work all emphasize a "middle moment" (p. xiv) rather than a beginning or ending moment in the plot's development. Life is lived in the middle (between birth and death), and it is in this middle that I-Thou encounters are disclosed-hence Buber's attention to moments that are between beginning and end. Kepnes tries to show how Buber's work can be very helpful to the contemporary Jew, how Buber is able to address a middle position between the Jewish "'common memory' of the past and hopes for the future" (p. xiv). For Buber, the best way to address this position is through the Bible because the world of the Bible is the world of the middle: "Revelation is, as it were, focused in the middle, creation in the beginning, and redemption in the end. .. ." (quoted on p. 124). By participating in the Bible the Jew may participate in Revelation. Kepnes articulates how the issue of God's presence in the Holocaust is addressed in Buber's narrative biblical theology. He powerfully shows how Buber's famous phrase "the eclipse of God" is a phrase directed at the person of faith in the middle. Just as an eclipse is a middle position between the presence and absence of a celestial body, so the "eclipse of God" primarily addresses the person "who, after tasting nearness, must experience distance" (quoted on p. 128). Kepnes finds that it is from Buber's discussion of Job and the Psalms in The Prophetic Faith that "we are led back from the caesura of the event of the Holocaust to God's presence in the beginning, in creation, and forward to God's unceasing presence in the continual creation of life" (p. 139). One of the things that caught my attention in the preface of this book was Kepnes's claim that "the promise inherent in this [i.e., Buber's] narrative Jewish theology is truly great, for if this theology is fully explored and articulated it could provide the basis for an 'aggadic' or narrative Judaism. ... If Buber's hermeneutics is seen in the context of contemporary hermeneutic studies in Judaism his work can be recognized as the beginning of what some have called the modern Jewish revival of the 'midrashic imagination"' (p. xv). Ideally, then, the reader should have come away from this book with a start on this new beginning. What we have in this book, however, is too much peshat and not enough derash. Kepnes supplies us with Buber's work, but he does not model for us how a life is to be affected by this work. He does not use this book for a creative absorption of Buber's work into his own life (despite what his Buberian hermeneutic method suggests). This criticism is not to mitigate Kepnes's accomplishment</page><page sequence="4">256 BOOK REVIEWS in this book. Here is an excellent presentation of Martin Buber's narrative writings.
