New York Pergamon Press, 1990. ix, 159 pp. Shmuel Almog's study of nationalist antisemitism in Europe from 1815 to 1945 begins and ends by emphasizing the difficulty of isolating one strand in the complex tapestry of history. Because the subject under investigation here is the negative side of the relation between Jews and Christians in all (or most) of Europe, thereby involving much of the history of Europe over more</page><page sequence="2">342 BOOK REVIEWS than a century, the conceptual problem presented by focusing only on nationalist antisemitism is vastly compounded by the further task of provid- ing the reader with an adequate historical context for many events widely removed in time and place. The attempt to carry out both tasks in fewer than 150 pages of text does not work. Granted the author's warnings about the dangers of concentration on one aspect (nationalist antisemitism) of a larger problem (antisemitism), he might still have succeeded conceptually, if not contextually, had he limit- ed himself to that phenomenon. Unfortunately, Almog confuses the reader by stating early in the preface that the attempt to discover why Hitler chose the Jews as his prime target leads to the study of antisemitism (p. vii). This establishes a linkage between the Holocaust and antisemitism that reappears in the last chapter, "Antisemitism and the Holocaust." But Almog writes that "the Holocaust period made plain the difference between a narrow- minded nationalism and racist Nazism itself, between murderous antisem- ites and the total and absolute 'Final Solution"' (p. 147). Elsewhere, too, Almog argues that collaborators saw Jews as a national enemy, while Hitler and the Nazis saw them as a cosmic foe (p. 140). In other words, nationalist antisemitism merely explains why non-Germans sympathized and cooper- ated with the Nazi "solution" to a European Jewish problem, especially in Central and Eastern Europe. This leaves non-Nazi Germans in a strange, undefined middle ground. Yet the author ends the book as he began it, stat- ing that nationalism, while admittedly only one factor, played a role and "we could hardly omit reference to it" (pp. 148, viii). Lacking clear definitions of a series of related terms, such as "antisemi- tism," "nationalism," and "modern," the treatment of nationalist antisemi- tism in a large number of countries and historical eras is unclear and con- voluted. This is especially true when the author, very understandably, treats religious and social-economic antisemitism together with the nationalist aspect. In the process promising leads, such as "modern nationalism is typi- fied by the rising power of the masses in society and the spread of a nation- alist ideology" (p. 3), are not pursued. The author's presentation of original sources in translation is a mixed blessing. In itself, of course, the inclusion of translated source material is not only praiseworthy but very useful, as many of the excerpts are important and seldom seen in the literature, especially in translation. But too often they appear out of context or with too little textual explanation-even spe- cialists will find it hard to place some of them. Adding to this problem of</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 343 usage is the inclusion of a large number of selections about antisemitism by Jews and others. While fascinating, these tell us more about Jews than about antisemites. Indeed, at times Almog's work becomes an essay in Jewish his- tory. Like so much about his work, this is not a problem in itself, but the book's shortness makes the treatment needlessly confusing because it can- not be developed in sufficient depth to be understandable to any but the expert. Almog's book includes thirty interesting illustrations which nicely complement the text, a short but useful bibliography, and an index. There are a surprisingly large number of explanatory footnotes, which, while they are important to understanding both text and documents, point up the inherent problem in trying to do so much in such little space. Many notes should have been included in the text, and some of the clarifying informa- tion they contain will probably be lost to readers. In sum, while useful, intriguing, and based on a wide-ranging knowledge of European antisemitism, this work is so conceptually and contextually problematic that it will be both difficult for students and lay readers to use and frustrating for the scholar. Differing interpretations aside, there is little "wrong" in Almog's work, but it could have profited greatly from better editorial control and advice. James F.
