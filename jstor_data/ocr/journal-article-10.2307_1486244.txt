JAFFEE Introduction The Mishnah is preserved in a web of exegetical texts-the Tosefta, the halakhic midrashim, and the Talmuds-which have accompanied it throughout its history of transmission. A common problem in mishnaic textual criticism, therefore, is to clarify the extent to which elements of the I wish to acknowledge the helpful criticism of Professors Alan Avery-Peck (Tulane Univer- sity), Howard Eilberg-Schwartz (Indiana University), and Robert Goldenberg (SUNY-Stony Brook), all of whom should be held responsible only for what is of value in this paper. 135</page><page sequence="2">136 MARTIN S. JAFFEE Mishnah's exegetical tradition have become part of the the text itself.' It is for this reason that a question most appropriate to other literary texts is so difficult to answer for the Mishnah: at what point does the history of the text's creation end and the history of its transmission and interpretation begin? In a certain respect, of course, in the mishnaic case this question is con- ceptually flawed. By posing an absolute distinction between the redaction- and transmission-history of the Mishnah, one reifies processes which, in fact, are most difficult to distinguish. Epstein in particular has shown that the text of the Mishnah, in the recension of Rabbi (Judah the Patriarch), remained relatively fluid for some centuries after its promulgation, ca. 200 C.E. Thus, the mishnaic text-types now available are in a very real sense no less the creations of the Mishnah's later students (the amoraim, or "ex- plainers") than they are the work of the Mishnah's authors.2 Be that as it may, continued progress in philological3 and form- analytical4 criticism of the Mishnah and its cognate literature suggests that our question retains its heuristic value. However much the Mishnah's trans- mitters and preservers may have affected textual details, the basic linguistic 1. The framework within which contemporary discussion of these issues takes place is con- stituted by the works of J. N. Epstein, Introduction to the Text of the Mishnah [Heb.], 2 vols., 2d ed. (Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, 1964), pp. 946-979 (hereafter cited as Text) and Introductions to Tannaitic Literature [Heb.] (Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, 1957), pp. 227-232 (hereafter cited as Literature). For instructive discussions of major figures in the modern history of mishnaic literary and historical criticism, see the essays collected in J. Neusner, ed., The Modern Study of the Mishnah (Leiden, 1973) (hereafter cited as Study). The bibliography to this volume, complete to 1972, is a most valuable guide to the relevant literature. A helpful recent discussion of the amoraic reception of the Mishnah is that of B. M. Bokser, Post Mishnaic Judaism in Transition (Chico, Calif., 1980), pp. 461-491. 2. See Epstein, Text, 2:706-726 and the discussion of B. M. Bokser, "Jacob Epstein's Intro- duction to the Text of the Mishnah," in Neusner, Study, pp. 13-36. 3. On the distinctions between the Hebrew employed in the talmudic baraitot and that of the Mishnah itself, see M. Moreshet, "The Hebrew Baraitot in the Babylonian Talmud Are Not MH(1)" [Heb.], in E. Y. Kutscher et al., eds., Henoch Yalon Memorial Volume (Ramat Gan, 1974), pp. 1-40; idem, "New and Revived Verbs in the Baraitot of the Babylonian Talmud" [Heb.], in Y. Kutscher, ed., Archive of the New Dictionary of Rabbinic Literature, vol. 1 (Ramat Gan, 1972), pp. 117-162; and idem, "Further Studies of the Language of the Hebrew Baraitot in the Babylonian and Palestinian Talmuds" [Heb.], in M. Kaddari, ed,, Archive of the New Dictionary of Rabbinic Literature, vol. 2 (Ramat Gan, 1974), pp. 31-73. 4. The term "form-analysis" can apply to a number of rather different analytical proce- dures, as observed by B. M. Bokser, "Talmudic Form Criticism," Journal of Jewish Studies 31, no. 1 (1980): 46-48. The present usage is derived from the distinctive contribution of Jacob Neusner, whose most clearly formulated view of the principles and potential of form-analysis may be consulted in A History of the Mishnaic Law of Purities, vol. 21 (Leiden, 1977), hereafter cited as Purities.</page><page sequence="3">MISHNAIC LITERARY HISTORY 137 and formal traits of the text are readily distinguishable from all later amoraic literature-even where, as in certain texts attributed by the Talmuds to mishnaic sages (e.g., baraitot), we find self-conscious attempts to copy mishnaic literary conventions (see n. 3). For any tractate of the Mishnah, therefore, it should be possible to isolate the "work" from the "exegesis," to distinguish-at least in principle--between the literary traits of redaction and those of emendation or criticism. The present essay, then, attempts to discern relationships between the redaction of the Mishnah's text, the inner-textual development of its legal concepts, and the early history of the text's transmission and exegesis. My contribution lies in the simple observation that redaction is itself a thoroughly exegetical act. Accordingly, the history of the Mishnah's exege- sis may be said to begin in the final stages of the redaction of its individual tractates. I argue that analysis of such tractates can distinguish between materials formulated prior to the overall plan of the tractate in which they appear (i.e., prior to the decision to organize material on a given topic into a self-contained treatise) and those which presuppose the existence of their present tractates in close to their final form. The latter are of most signifi- cance in the present essay, for they illumine the close linkage between redac- tion and exegesis-tradition and interpretation-which emerges as the distinctive intellectual trait of what later rabbinic circles know as Oral Torah.5 Pseudepigraphy and Exegesis I take as my starting point mishnaic evidence first recognized by Jacob Neusner, but never fully accounted for by him.6 This is the prevalence of pseudepigraphic disputes attributed to the Houses of Shammai and Hillel (ca. 20-70), the dominant proto-rabbinic groups which, in rabbinic memory, helped to preserve and amplify the Oral Torah of Moses. Neusner has observed that many disputes between the Houses first become the sub- ject of comment among authorities affiliated with a second-century circle centered in the town of Usha (ca. 140-170) and address issues hotly debated 5. For an attempt to interpret the redactional traits of rabbinic texts as literary representa- tions of the ideology of Oral Torah, see M. Jaffee, "Oral Torah in Theory and Practice: Aspects of Mishnah-Exegesis in the Palestinian Talmud," Religion, in press for winter, 1986. 6. The points raised in this paragraph have their basis in J. Neusner, Rabbinic Traditions About the Pharisees Before 70 (Leiden, 1971), 1:1-5 and 3:180-300 (hereafter cited as Phari- sees).</page><page sequence="4">138 MARTIN S. JAFFEE only by them. Where this is the case, Neusner surmises, it is possible that Ushan or post-Ushan figures have ascribed to the Houses disputes which were not in fact inherited from antecedent literary or oral traditions, but rather reflect the legal initiatives of the latest generations of thinkers respon- sible for the Mishnah's final form. Neusner observes that this pseudepi- graphic activity may constitute part of a larger effort to reconstruct tradi- tions lost in the wake of the Bar Kokhba catastrophe (132-135), but he otherwise refrains from offering specific motives for individual cases. The present essay proposes to enrich Neusner's interpretation of such pseudepigrapha by exploring in detail a single case which appears twice in the Mishnah (Ma'aserot 4:2, Eduyyot 4:10). My discussion will show that this dispute is not an ancient "tradition" stemming from the late Pharisaic or early post-Destruction periods (ca. 20-90), but rather is created speci- fically for use in Tractate Ma'aserot at the very end of the second century, when Ma'aserot was-with the Mishnah as a whole--coming to final literary completion. That is, the ideas elaborated in this dispute-while they are central to the tractate's subject matter-do not lie at the foundation of that tractate in any evolutionary sense. Rather, they are first fruits of rabbinic attempts to reflect systematically upon Tractate Ma'aserot as a literary whole exhibiting a coherent pattern of ideas. I argue, therefore, that-at least in Ma'aserot-pseiudepigraphy demarcates an important turn in the history of rabbinic thought; a turn from the creation of texts to their systematic analysis, from the preservation of ideas to their interpretation and application. The intellectual and ideological issues at stake in this exege- tical turn must now be spelled out. The Dispute: Intention and the Taking of Tithes7 The versions of the dispute preserved in Tractates Ma'aserot and Eduyyot are identical, as follows:8 7. By "tithing" the Mishnah understands the removal of various offerings prescribed in Scripture for the exclusive use of priests, Levites, and the poor. The offerings for the priests and Levites in particular are regarded as sanctified and enjoy the status of "holy things," e.g., Temple property, which may not be put to secular use. On the Mishnah's discussions of these offerings, see M. Jaffee, The Mishnah's Theology of Tithing: A Study of Tractate Maaserot (Chico, Calif., 1981), pp. 1-6 (hereafter, Maaserot); A. Peck, The Priestly Gift in Mishnah: A Study of Tractate Terumot (Chico, Calif., 198 1), pp. 1-7; and P. Haas, A History of the Mishnaic Law of Agriculture: Tractate Maaser Sheni (Chico, Calif., 1980), pp. 1-5. 8. All mishnaic translations in this paper follow the text of H. Albeck, The Six Orders of the</page><page sequence="5">MISHNAIC LITERARY HISTORY 139 A. A Sabbath basket- B. the House of Shammai declares it exempt, C. but the House of Hillel declares it liable. The superscription at A supposes that, at some point during the week, a person has gathered produce into a basket and set that basket aside specifi- cally for use in the Sabbath meal. Shared by the Houses (B-C) is the assumption that tithing is forbidden on the Sabbath itself.9 Therefore, the owner must remove the offerings sometime before the onset of the Sabbath so that the food will be permitted him when he needs it. What happens, however, if during the week prior to the Sabbath the owner wishes to take a small snack out of the basket, leaving the rest for use as he originally in- tended? Need he tithe the produce in the basket prior to the snack, or is he permitted to make random use of it until the latest possible moment prior to the Sabbath meal? This is the question which divides the Houses. The explanation of the disputing views lies in a difference of opinion with regard to the nature of the person's intention to make a meal of the produce. The Shammaites, who declare the produce available for untithed snacks during the week, assume that we take the man's original intention quite literally. He has indicated that he intends to make a meal of the produce on the Sabbath. Accordingly, any random use of the produce prior to that time is of no consequence. Since the time intended for the meal is still far off, we do not infer the existence of the stated intention in any other act. The Hillel- ites, to the contrary, suppose that once a person indicates that the produce is suitable for mealtime use, whatever he eats of that batch thereafter is re- garded as being for the purpose of a meal. Thus, even though the produce in the basket is explicitly designated for Sabbath use, it must be tithed quite early in the week if the owner decides to use it in any way.1' Mishnah [Heb.] (Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, 1957; 4th printing, 1975). For very minor textual variants in this and other texts, see the relevant portions of N. Sacks, ed., The Mishnah with Variant Readings: Order Zera'im [Heb.] (Jerusalem, 1975), vol. 2. 9. This prohibition finds no precedent in Scripture. The Mishnah, for its part, accepts it without controversy as a fundamental assumption. See, e.g., M. Demai 4:1 and 7:1 + 5, M. Terumot 2:3/T. Terumot 4:1. M. Shabbat 2:7/T. Shabbat 2:19, M. Begah 5:2/T.Y.T.4:4 as well as M. Ma'aserot 2:3. For discussion of later talmudic explanations of the reasons for this prohibi- tion, see S. Lieberman, Tosefta Ki-fshutah (New York, 1955), 1:337 and 5:1001-1002. 10. This interpretation builds upon those of RaBaD (Eduyyot 4:10), RaS (Ma'aserot 4:2), and Bertinoro (Ma'aserot 4:2), against that of Maimonides (Ma'aserot 4:2/Eduyyot 4:10), who argues that our case refers in particular to a basket gathered from a tree the fruit of which is, as a matter of course, used only for the Sabbath meals (see Y. Ma'aserot 4:2, 51b). Cf. Y. D.</page><page sequence="6">140 MARTIN S. JAFFEE Clearly, this dispute presupposes a sophisticated body of theory with regard to the laws of the Sabbath and the laws of tithing. It assumes, first of all, that the question of whether tithing is permitted on the Sabbath-a question ignored by Scripture (cf. Y. Ma'aserot 4:1, 49d)-has already been addressed and solved." Secondly, it assumes a theoretical postulate for which Scripture provides no grounds-that there is some critical distinction between making a snack of produce and making a meal of it as far as responsibility for tithing is concerned.12 Finally, and most importantly, we are led to assume that a person's responsibility for removing tithes is in some sense dependent not only on what he does with the produce, but also upon what he intends to do with it. Here is yet another assumption for which Scripture would leave us unprepared.' Gilat, "Intention and Action in the Teaching of the Tannaim" [Heb.], Annual of Bar Ilan University 4-5 (1967), p. 115. Gilat, too, follows the line of exegesis stemming from RaBaD, but is, in my view, too hasty in denying the Shammaites any recognition that intentions have some role in the imposition of liability. 11. The prohibition against Sabbath tithing is first mentioned by Yavneans, e.g., Joshua (T. Ma'aserot 2:1) and Simeon Shezuri (M. Demai 4:1), although the Houses may allude to it at M. Be;ah 1:6. This latter pericope, however, is attested no earlier than Usha by Judah and Yose (T.Y. T. 1:12-13). 12. The terminological distinction between a formal meal (qb') and a random snack ('r'y) is first attributed in M. Ma'aserot to the Ushans Yose (Ma'aserot 1:8, attesting Ma'aserot 1:5) and Judah (Ma'aserot 2:1-2). If the Eliezer of Ma'aserot 2:4 is ben Hyrcanus, which is unlikely, this would then locate the terminology at the Yavnean stratum, attested in the same pericope by the Ushan Simeon. Neither M. Ma'aserot nor later sources suggest that a characteristic of the "formal" meal vis-A-vis tithing law is the inclusion of bread. The issue is directly addressed in Y. Ma'aserot 4:1, 51b, s.v. 'Ah hysb bidh, where the criteria for "formality" include the serving of wine or the posture of leaning. For further discussion of the peculiar notion of "meal" employed in M. Ma'aserot, see Jaffee, Maaserot, pp. 1-6. 13. On the distinction between scriptural and rabbinic perspectives on this issue, see the remarkably compact comment of Rashi, B. Berakhot 31a, s.v. bmwv ibh. The notion that liabi- lity of produce to tithing is in some sense a function of what the owner intends to do with it has only a doubtful Yavnean attestation (Eliezer, Ma'aserot 4:3; see n. 22 below). It is impossible in the present context to explore the extent to which the theory of intention in the law of tithes intersects with similar theories in other areas of early rabbinic law. The basis for such work remains the study of M. Higger, "Intention in Talmudic Law," reprinted in E. M. Gershfield, ed., Studies in Jewish Jurisprudence (New York, 1971), pp. 234-293. See also the essays of S. Zeitlin now collected in idem, Studies in the Early History ofJudaism: History of Early Talmudic Law, vol. 4 (New York, 1978) (hereafter cited as Studies): "Studies in Tannaitic Jurisprudence: Intention as a Legal Priniciple," "Asmakta or Intention: A Study in Tannaitic Jurisprudence," "Intention as One of the Controversial Points Between Jose and Judah," "A Note on the Principle of Intention in Tannaitic Literature," and "The Semikah Controversy Between the Zugoth." A major new advance in the state of the question is the forthcoming dissertation of H. Eilberg-Schwartz, "The Human Will in Judaism: The Mishnah's Philosophy of Intention"</page><page sequence="7">MISHNAIC LITERARY HISTORY 141 It is not possible in this small space to isolate the probable point at which such assumptions enter into the history of mishnaic law or to determine whether they are plausibly attributed to the "historical" Houses of Hillel and Shammai. The best that can be said, at least on the basis of Neusner's study of the Houses' corpus, is that interest in the laws of the Sabbath and tithing is genuinely to be located in the earliest strata of mishnaic law asso- ciated with the Houses.14 The extent, however, to which the distinctive for- mulation of these issues in the present dispute can be regarded as "early" is quite another question. The basis for reaching a decision on the matter is discussed below. The Dispute in Context The question before us is whether the present dispute existed prior to the conception of Tractate Ma'aserot in its present form or whether, to the con- trary, it is formulated with that tractate's general format and concerns in mind. The answer is important, for if the dispute appears to be a source cited by the editors of the Mishnah for their own use, this would support an argument for dating the formation of the dispute to a period prior to the construction of the tractate before us. If, however, the dispute does seem to presuppose issues spelled out within Tractate Ma'aserot in some detail, it is necessary to offer an explanation of its ascription to the Houses rather than to an appropriate Yavnean or Ushan figure. As I have already indicated, the dispute in question does in fact appear at Tractate Eduyyot 4:10. There it is one of a series of Houses disputes in which the Shammaites, contrary to normal convention, are assigned the lenient ruling (Eduyyot 4:1-12 + 5:1-4). Prior to the work of Epstein, this passage, along with Eduyyot as a whole, was regarded as an early Yavnean product, primarily on the strength of historical traditions recorded in T. Eduyyot 1:1 and B. Berakhot 28a.'5 If Eduyyot as a whole represented early (Brown University, 1985: directed by Jacob Neusner). I wish to thank Professor Eilberg- Schwartz for sharing his work with me prior to its completion. 14. See Neusner, Pharisees 1:291-294. In my view the most likely echo of the "authentic" Houses is the concern for the role of intention in establishing that a substance is subject to laws appropriate to human food. See, for example, M. Uklin 3:6 (attested by the Yavnean, Akiva, ad loc.) and M. Makhshirin 1:2-3 (attested at M. Makhshirin 1:3 by the Yavnean, Joshua). I am indebted to Professor Eilberg-Schwartz for drawing my attention to these passages. 15. See in particular, D. Hoffmann, The First Mishna and the Controversies of the Tannaim,</page><page sequence="8">142 MARTIN S. JAFFEE formulations of pre-Yavnean traditions, this would constitute powerful evidence that our dispute as well may be regarded as quite early in origin. Epstein's work, however, proves that Eduyyot, particularly chapter 4, is the creation of late authorities, who collected their materials from other trac- tates rather than from some Ur-List of unedited Houses disputes.16 It is impossible, then, on the basis of evidence internal to Eduyyot to date any of the disputes it preserves. The tractate, that is, attests its materials to the patriarchal circle of redactors, but does not tell us whether or not their first formulation substantially predates the latest stages of the Misnah's redac- tion. In light of the difficulty of using the evidence of Eduyyot 4:1-12 for dating our dispute, the only alternative is to turn to Ma'aserot 4:2 itself. There the pericope contributes to a larger literary and rhetorical unit which, while composed of formally diverse materials, single-mindedly explores a specific problem (Ma'aserot 4:1-5).'7 This is to identify acts of food- preparation which indicate the intention on the part of the owner to use the food in a meal. When such intention is apparent, e.g., when a person cooks or pickles unprocessed produce in the field (Ma'aserot 4:1), removes a batch of produce from its place of processing and makes it palatable (Ma'aserot 4:3-4), or even collects a few hulled kernels of grain in his hand (Ma'aserot 4:5), the produce in question is rendered liable to tithing, and may not be eaten in any manner until tithes are properly removed. In this context, Ma'aserot 4:2 makes the following contribution: A. Children who hid figs away for the Sabbath, but forgot to tithe them [by Sabbath Eve], shall not eat [the figs] at the end of the Sabbath unless they tithe. B. A Sabbath basket-the House of Shammai declares it exempt, but the House of Hillel declares it liable. C. R. Judah says, "Also ('p): one who gathers a basket [of produce] to send to his fellow shall not eat [of the produce himself] unless he tithes. trans. P. Forchheimer (New York, 1977), pp. 92-95 (n. 9), and H. Albeck, Untersuchungen fiber die Redaktion der Mischna (Berlin, 1936), pp. 108 ff. Albeck's choleric response to Epstein may be consulted in H. Albeck, Introduction to the Mishnah [Heb.] (Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, 1959), pp. 257-259. 16. In Epstein's view, this is the work of Rabbi, who selected from the prior collections of Judah, Meir, Simeon, and others (Literature, p. 438). I do not, however, share Epstein's cer- tainty that chapter 4 of Eduyyot in particular represents a selection from the "Mishnah" of Meir (ibid., pp. 101-104, 434-438). 17. For details, see Jaffee, Maaserot, pp. 121-123.</page><page sequence="9">MISHNAIC LITERARY HISTORY 143 A few elementary observations will guide our interpretation of this pericope. While the three elements, A, B, and C, certainly combine to form a coherent discussion, it is clear as well that each element is formulated at some point prior to the conjoining of the whole into a single literary unit. In the first place, the formal balance of A and C, both of which are simple declarative sentences, is upset by B, a dispute which is framed in an apoco- pated style (X-it is A/it is B). Thus the unit as a whole does not appear to exhibit the traits of a discrete unit of tradition. Secondly, the content of each element is somewhat out of phase with that of its immediate neighbors. Both A and B share the theme of produce set aside for the Sabbath, but B knows nothing concrete about the case of interest to A. C, for its part, knows nothing about the problem of Sabbath food.1" Precisely for this reason, the linking language of 'p ("also"), which appears in all textual witnesses, suggests that an independent ruling has been joined somewhat artificially to B.19 Judah's apparent gloss of B, then, is a redactional creation only, and does not represent a comment formulated directly in light of B. The central question of interpretation, then, must be: what point is made by this artifi- cial effort to link A, B, and C? How does the whole frame a thesis which cannot be made by any of the elements in isolation? 18. Nearly all exegetes, following Y. Ma'aserot 4:2 (51b), s.v. I' 'mr rby yhwdh 'I' klkit ibt, err in reading the issue of the Sabbath into Judah's ruling. Cf. Jaffee, Maaserot, p. 125, where the error is repeated. To my knowledge, the sole exegete to depart from the Yerushalmi's prece- dent is Ephraim Isaac of Premysla (nineteenth century). See his Mishnah Rishonah, Ma'aserot 4:2. 19. A. Hyman, History of the Tannaim and Amoraim [Heb.] (Jerusalem, 1964), 2:539, lists some twenty-six traditions of Judah which gloss a preceding ruling with 'p. This is a trait not unique to Judah's traditions, but certainly characteristic of a small group of them. Of these, twenty-two are clearly dependent upon the theme, language, and formulaic traits of the rulings to which they are appended. They should, therefore, be regarded as genuine elements of the pericopae in which they appear. Four examples, however, including Ma'aserot 4:2, exhibit marked linguistic and formulaic independence of their present contexts (Shevu'ot 7:4, Ma'aserot 4:2, Eruvin 10:5 and Nedarim 11:10). This suggests that the appearance of 'p in Judah's traditions is a form, a conventional means of transmitting his opinions. In at least one context, Ma'aserot 4:2, I believe that this form has been used to link his name to views which do not derive from his authentic teaching. Only further work on the other three instances men- tioned above can judge the extent to which they too depart from principles normally held by Judah. In none of these instances does the ruling attributed to him gloss a dispute between the Houses. There is, to my knowledge, no serious study of the formal characteristics of Judah's traditions which can explain the selection of certain traditions for transmission in the 'p form. See n. 23 for further comments on problems associated with the interpretation of Judah's corpus.</page><page sequence="10">144 MARTIN S. JAFFEE Let us, then, move step by step through our three elements. On its own terms, A raises an important problem grounded in the familiar assumption that produce designated for the Sabbath cannot be tithed on that day. We know, therefore, that the forgetful children are unable to eat their figs on the Sabbath. But what of the following day? Since the figs were intended specifi- cally for Sabbath use, should we not expect that they be permitted for use at some time other than the day on which they were to be eaten in a meal? One might hold, that is, that the intention to use the figs in a particular meal imposes liability to tithing only when the time for that meal arrives. If they are not eaten at that time, for whatever reason, they should remain per- mitted as a snack until they are once again set aside for a specific meal. A's rejection of this possibility can be based upon one consideration alone. Namely, the intention to eat produce at a particular meal remains binding even though it is in principle impossible to act on that intention. In light of the children's intention to eat the figs on the Sabbath, therefore, we assume that even after the Sabbath they will continue to view the figs as part of some other meal. Accordingly, the figs must be tithed before any use whatever is made of them. We come now to B, our familiar dispute. The reader will recall that, in my earlier exegesis, the Hillelite position seemed in close harmony with the reasoning which now emerges from the ruling at A; i.e., all actions sub- sequent to a formulation of intention are interpreted as enactments of that intention. In fact, now that we have the benefit of an amplified context of interpretation, the grounds of the dispute appear more complex than we might have imagined. The issue at A is whether an intention can be nullified by the failure to enact it at the appropriate time. The ruling claims that the obligation to tithe remains in force even if, at the time designated for the meal, the produce cannot be eaten. The issue of B, to the contrary, is whether an intention is effective before it can be enacted. That is, can the intention to use produce in a future meal determine the status of the produce prior to the appointed moment? Both positions presuppose an answer to a prior, unstated, question: is the enactment of an intention to use produce in a meal a necessary element in the imposition of liability? The answer, as far as A and the Hillelites are concerned, is that once intentions are clearly expressed (e.g., by placing produce in a basket normal- ly reserved for Sabbath food), these alone-apart from any further corro- borative actions-are sufficient to impose liability. Therefore, as at A, produce which cannot be eaten at the intended Sabbath meal remains liable</page><page sequence="11">MISHNAIC LITERARY HISTORY 145 to tithing after the Sabbath, while B's Sabbath basket is rendered liable to tithing even before the Sabbath arrives. In both cases, the mere existence of the intention irrevocably imposes liability forthwith. The Shammaites, for their part, continue to assert that intentions require corroborative action in order to have any impact on the status of untithed produce. Intentions, that is, are effective only when embodied in concrete actions appropriate to them. There is no doubt that A and the Hillelites at B share a common prin- ciple with regard to the power of intention alone to impose liability. The critical question for us is whether the ruling of A presupposes the position taken by the Hillelites on the case at B, or whether, to the contrary, the case at B represents a logical development of A's ruling. In my view, the latter is the case. The reason is as follows: if I know (1) that intentions are effective without corroborative action and (2) that they take effect immediately upon the formulation of an intention-as the Hillelites hold-there is no reason to even raise the question of A. The produce will become liable to tithing whether or not it is actually used in a meal, regardless of intervening circum- stances. The fact that the produce could not be tithed on the Sabbath is simply irrelevant to adjudicating its subsequent status. On the other hand, if we know only A's claim that an intention continues to be effective even beyond the point at which it can no longer be enacted, the next logical question is: how soon does that intention take effect-immediately, or only at the moment at which the meal is intended? This, in fact, is what the Houses dispute. Accordingly, the principle of A, if not its actual language, seems presupposed by the formulator of B. His interest is in exploring the consequences of the view that intentions can work their effects upon the status of produce in a manner essentially untrammeled by behavioral consi- derations. At what point, he now asks, does the power of an explicit inten- tion first take effect-at the moment at which it is capable of consummation (Shammaites) or even earlier, when the intention reaches conscious formula- tion in the mind of an individual (Hillelites)? As we turn now to Judah's contribution at C, we ask where he appears to stand on the question which occupies A-B. As I have pointed out, his ruling is quite independent of the concrete facts of Sabbath law. In his view, a person who sends a gift of produce to a friend must tithe it if he decides to eat the produce himself. There can be only two plausible grounds for this view. The first is that Judah requires a donor to remove tithes, on behalf of the recipient, from all gifts he sends, lest the recipient unwittingly eat</page><page sequence="12">146 MARTIN S. JAFFEE untithed produce.20 Accordingly, if the donor changes his mind, and decides to use the produce himself, he is still required to tithe, for the produce is already liable (so Mishnah Rishonah, Ma'aserot 4:2). The flaw in this interpretation is that it provides no grounds for requiring the man to tithe the produce on his own behalf. Tithing the gift, after all, is merely a precau- tion on behalf of the recipient. There is, therefore, no reason to require the sender himself to tithe once he has changed his mind. He has not as yet indicated his intended disposition of the produce. The second interpretation of Judah's ruling is more plausible. Judah may well believe that one need not tithe produce sent as a gift, for the recipient will tithe on his own behalf as a precaution against laxity on the part of the donor.21 If, however, the man decides to use the produce for his own needs, the issue of his intentions must now be raised as well. He has placed the produce in a basket and indicated, by his decision to offer it as a gift, that it is suitable for use in a meal. Accordingly, even though he has revised his intended disposition of the produce, we can assume that he still regards it as suitable for a meal. Unless he in some way indicates that he has abandoned his conception of the produce as suitable for mealtime use, we require him to remove the tithes before he eats. This latter view of the matter helps us understand why the redactor of Ma'aserot 4:2 deems it a suitable contribution to the dispute between the Shammaites and the Hillelites. Although C has no interest in the question of Sabbath produce, it does reveal a basic harmony with the most simple thesis of A. That is: once we know that an intention to use produce as a meal has been formulated, we interpret any later act of eating as fulfilling this inten- tion. As soon as we know that a person views the produce as suitable for another's meal, we can assume that he so regards it for himself. Accord- ingly, he must remove all offerings prior to eating. This construction of the meaning of C in the present context has rather 20. See M. Demai 3:3/T. Demai 3:14. The anonymous view of T. conforms to the present interpretation of Judah's assumptions. 21. Ma'aserot 5:1 (s.v. lqt .Isbh lbbrw ptwr), assigned to Judah by Y. Ma'aserot (5:1, 51c), is read by the Yerushalmi to make this very point. The view is, as well, logically compatible with the anonymous ruling of M. Demai 2:2 that one who would be "trustworthy" with regard to tithing should tithe whatever he eats, sells, or purchases. Judah there accepts this view and dis- putes the separate issue of whether trustworthiness includes refusing the hospitality of Jews unfamiliar with rabbinic customs ('ammei ha'ares). Cf. T. Ma'aserot 2:5, in which Simeon b. Gamaliel, in dispute with Rabbi, assumes that rabbinic colleagues (baverim) are unlikely to tithe produce offered to other haverim as a gift.</page><page sequence="13">MISHNAIC LITERARY HISTORY 147 surprising implications for the interpretation of our Houses' dispute. Just as we saw the Hillelite position amplifying and building upon the ruling at A, so too does it represent a logical advance beyond Judah's theory of inten- tion. Judah, with A, will interpret all acts of eating, subsequent to the deci- sion to make produce available for a meal, as enactments of an intention to do so. The Hillelites, going one step further, argue that we need not wait for any act of eating at all in order to impose liability. Rather, it exists at the moment in which the intention to use the produce in a meal is first expressed (i.e., when fruit is placed in a basket normally used to store Sabbath produce). To summarize matters thus far: the principle of our dispute builds not only on that of A, but presupposes as well the logic of Judah's ruling at C. As far as the Hillelites in particular are concerned, there is no practical difference separating their view from that of Judah. Rather, they introduce an entirely unanticipated notion of intention into the rulings of A and C. Intention is, so to speak, "spiritualized"; transformed from a psychological motive of behavior into a principle capable of altering the nature of material items. In the present case, an event in the mind activates a process by which the common is transformed into a bearer of the sacred, i.e., the holy food which may be eaten only by those whom God has selected to receive it (n. 7). It appears, then, that B's formation either postdates that of A and C or, at the very least, depends upon the legal perspectives embodied within them. Our redactor, however, has not arranged these materials in accord with the inner connections of their logic. Rather, his concern is to present them in light of an historical thesis about the development of rabbinic tradition. In his view, A represents an ancient anonymous ruling upon which the Houses join issue. The Hillelites carry forward the perspective of A, at which point the most recent authority, Judah (C), makes his own contribution, in line with the authoritative principles of the Hillelites. So convincing is this redactional work that only the most stubborn (and skeptical) analysis can move behind it to construct an alternative reading of the issues at hand. The Dispute as Exegesis The obvious question at this juncture is: what is at stake in this elaborate redactional exercise? An answer emerges from those passages of Tractate Ma'aserot in which the role of intention comes into explicit discussion. Let</page><page sequence="14">148 MARTIN S. JAFFEE us now trace the development of the tractate's ideas on intention from Yavneh, through Usha, and on to the dispute between the Houses of Hillel and Shammai. The role of intention in the imposition of liability to tithing plays only a small part in the presumably Yavnean stratum of Tractate Ma'aserot. All Yavneans seem to assume Akiva's notion that only produce normally used for food can be regarded as food as far as the liability to the removal of tithes is concerned (Ma'aserot 4:6). Translated into terms of a theory of intention, this means that the intention to use inedible or unripe produce as food is powerless to bring that produce within the scope of the law of tithes (e.g., Ma'aserot 1:1; cf. M. Ukzin 3:1 ff. regarding uncleanness). This nega- tive Yavnean evaluation of the power of intentions to affect produce within the tithing system is rejected by only one conceivably Yavanean authority, Eliezer.22 His conception of the positive role of intentions emerges in Ma'aserot 4:3, which immediately follows our dispute. There we read: A. One who picks olives out of the softening bin dips [them] one by one in salt, and eats [without tithing]. B. If he salted [them] and placed [them] before him, he is required [to tithe]. C. R. Eliezer says, "[If he picked them] from a bin [of olives which were pre- pared in a state of] cleanness, he is required [to tithe]. But [if he picked them] from a bin [prepared in a state of] uncleanness, he is exempt [from tithing], because he returns the surplus [of the latter batch to the bin of unclean olives]." The pericope defines actions which indicate that a person regards produce removed from its processing place as ready for use in a meal. A-B holds that removal of soaking olives from their bin implies the intention to use them in a meal only if a number of olives are removed at once and then seasoned for consumption. The salted olives are now a batch independent of those in the midst of soaking. Removed from processing, they are regarded as liable to the removal of tithes. Eliezer's contribution refines the foregoing. His point is that the intentions of the owner can be inferred even prior to the 22. J. Neusner, Eliezer b. Hyrcanus: The Tradition and the Man (Leiden, 1973), 2:175, lists this pericope among those which are likely to be authentic reflections of Eliezer's teaching. I have found no discussion of this pericope in Y. D. Gilat, The Teachings of R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanos [Heb.] (Tel Aviv, 1968).</page><page sequence="15">MISHNAIC LITERARY HISTORY 149 act of salting, which indicated the man's desire to eat them. All we need know is that the man is likely to have removed the olives permanently and has no intention to return them to the processing bin. This can be deter- mined in reference to the status vis-a-vis uncleanness of the olives in ques- tion. If the olives have been prepared without special precautions against contracting uncleanness, the man can return any leftovers to that bin with- out fear that the uncleanness of his own hands has contaminated his portion and will, in turn, contaminate the rest of the olives in the bin. Accordingly, such olives do not yet constitute a separate batch and are not rendered liable to the removal of tithes. If, however, the man takes no precautions against contaminating olives removed from a bin prepared in cleanness, we can assume he intends to remove them permanently. For this reason, he is required to tithe whatever he eats. The problem for Eliezer, we see, is to infer from the context of an action the intention likely to inform it. He knows nothing, however, of the issue of interest to the Houses at Ma'aserot 4:2, viz., whether intentions are separa- ble in their effects from the actions which express them. Indeed, if con- fronted with such a question, Eliezer would probably toe the Shammaite line, for he certainly sees an intrinsic connection between actions and their intentional grounds. Nevertheless, in Ma'aserot, he makes no ruling on this problem. The issue, in fact, is of interest only among Ushans. Consider the follow- ing pericope, Ma'aserot 1:8, to which Yose makes a contribution: A. Dried figs [are rendered liable to the removal of tithes] after he presses [them into a storage jar], and molded figs [are rendered liable] after he presses them with a roller. B. [If] he was pressing [them] into ajar or rolling [them] in a mold, [and] the jar broke or the mold cracked, he shall not make of them a random snack. C. R. Yose permits [him to make a random snack]. Dried figs remain exempt from tithing until they have been pressed in accordance with the owner's wishes (A), for only at that point have they reached the condition in which the owner regards them as ready for use. B explores the matter in a familiar way. Even if the intended pressing, through no fault of the owner, cannot be completed, the figs must be tithed prior to use. The reason is that despite the accident the dried figs are in fact edible, and we know that the owner has expressed an intention to eat them at the cessation of processing. The man's inability to place his original intention</page><page sequence="16">150 MARTIN S. JAFFEE into effect in its original form is of no account. Yose (C) holds the opposite view, arguing that the produce is free of liability precisely because the man cannot eat them as he originally intended. Since he cannot act upon his original intention, he suffers no liability, and may snack of the produce without tithing, until he eventually completed the pressing. This pericope clearly moves well beyond the rather elementary interests of Eliezer at Ma'aserot 4:3. His interest in the grounds upon which inten- tions might be inferred has been transformed into a quite different problem, i.e., whether a known intention is effective after the conditions for its enact- ment no longer exist. B answers affirmatively, Yose negatively. Presumably, Yose would take the same stand against the anonymous ruling of Ma'aserot 4:2A regarding the status of figs which could not be eaten on the Sabbath. In his view, since use of the figs was impossible at the intended time, they should be exempt from liability. The foregoing demonstrates that Ushan problems, rather than those of Yavneh, set the intellectual context of Ma'aserot 4:2A, upon which the Houses' dispute at Ma'aserot 4:2B expands. It remains now to explore the corpus of a particular Ushan, Judah, to understand his position within the Ushan community of scholars. The clearest text for our purposes is Judah's dispute with Meir at Ma'aserot 2:5. This I shall discuss in detail and there- after allude less fully to further evidence within Judah's rulings in Ma'aserot. In Ma'aserot 2:5 Meir and Judah dispute the point at which purchases of untithed produce are considered to be consummated such that responsibility for tithing rests upon the purchaser. A. "One who says to his fellow, 'Take this issar and give me five figs for it,' shall not eat [the figs] unless he tithes"-[these are] the words of R. Meir. B. R. Judah says, "[If] he eats [the figs] one by one [from the seller's bin] he is exempt [from tithing]. But if he gathered [them] together [into a single batch and removed them from the bin] he is required [to tithe]." We focus first of all on the elementary issue of the dispute, and then move on to the theory of intention operative here. Meir (A) holds that the pur- chase is consummated when the coin passes from buyer to to seller (so Simeon, M. Bava Me;ia 4:2). Accordingly, as soon as this occurs, the pro- duce is deemed to have been appropriated by the purchaser, and must be tithed. Judah (B), however, holds that it is the transfer of the item from seller</page><page sequence="17">MISHNAIC LITERARY HISTORY 151 to buyer-rather than the payment itself-which consummates the transac- tion (so the anonymous ruling of M. Bava Me;ia 4:2). This is why Judah rules that a man who has paid for the produce may nevertheless eat one fig at a time from the bin without tithing. Since he has not drawn into his pos- session the stipulated batch, he is not the owner of anything he eats. Accord- ingly, he may eat the figs without tithing, as if they were a gift rather than his own property. We are now in a position to understand how conceptions of intention are woven into the dispute before us. Meir's view is that as soon as a person initiates commercial activity he signals his intention to appropriate the commodity in question. Accordingly, he is responsible for the tithing as soon as he hands over his coin, regardless of whether the produce is actually in his hands.Should the erstwhile seller, that is, begin to eat the figs, it would be the buyer's responsibility to remove tithes on his behalf. As at Ma'aserot 1:8B, the simple intention to make final appropriation of the figs effects that appropriation without benefit of any corroborative action. For Judah, as for Yose of Ma'aserot 1:8C, intentions are a factor in the imposition of liability only when they are in fact capable of being acted upon. Thus a person is not responsible for the removal of tithes until he actually has in his possession that which he has designated as his purchase. This view explains why Judah permits an obvious circumvention of the law. By the fiction that the pur- chaser has nothing in his possesion, Judah permits him to eat what he has paid for without tithing. Presumably, if the purchaser eventually did gather *a batch of five figs into his possession, he would then, and only then, be required to tithe them. Judah's position, to say the least, is most extreme, for no one can doubt that by paying for figs the man intends to purchase them. Despite this Judah holds that these intentions are without consequences until they are embo- died in an appropriate action, viz., until the intention to acquire the figs is fulfilled by the act which brings them as a batch into the buyer's possession. Only then is the intention functional in determining the man's responsibility to remove the tithes from what he has made his own. In order to point out that Judah's view is not idiosyncratically held in this case alone, it will be useful to survey other rulings in Ma'aserot in which he apparently holds the same position. At Ma'aserot 2:2, for example, Judah points out that a shopkeeper who accepts untithed figs from a passerby need not tithe what he eats unless, while in his shop, "he turns his face away [from the public] or unless he moves from where he is sitting [to a private part of the shop]." Judah</page><page sequence="18">152 MARTIN S. JAFFEE assumes with others that, like a man's home and courtyard (cf. Ma'aserot 3:5), his shop functions as a domain of privacy in which a meal can be made. Accordingly, produce brought into any of these domains becomes liable to the removal of tithes, on the assumption that what is available for private use will be so used. Judah simply adds that, in the case of a public place like an open stall in the market, the man must actually do something to indicate that he regards the place as affording privacy. Accordingly, produce eaten in his stall must be tithed only when the man has created the privacy which makes it possible to make a meal, for only then can he properly fulfill his original intention. Again, at Ma'aserot 2:8, Judah holds that "one who exchanges [his figs for figs] which are [designated] for [immediate] eating is required [to tithe what he acquires], but [if he exchanged his figs for figs] which are to be dried, he is exempt [from tithing until he dries that which he receives]." The exemption of the figs requiring further drying is grounded in the fact that the man's intention to dry them before eating forestalls the advent of liability which would normally follow the acquisition (Ma'aserot 2:5). That is, the intention to eat the figs in their dried state is only binding when the man can actually do so, i.e., when they are in fact dried. Enough perhaps has been said to indicate that Ma'aserot 1:8B, Meir (Ma'aserot 2:5A), and Ma'aserot 4:2A share the view that the intention to eat produce in a meal imposes liabilty to tithing even if it cannot yet be enacted, i.e., even if the processing is interrupted (Ma'aserot 1:8B), the man does not yet have the produce (Ma'aserot 2:5A), or the Sabbath has inter- vened prior to tithing (Ma'aserot 4:2A). Yose (Ma'aserot 1:8C), followed by Judah, argues, to the contrary, that the intention to enjoy the food as a meal is ineffective until such time as it is actually possible to do so, i.e., when the intended processing is completed (Ma'aserot 1:8C, 2:8), when the man actually has his purchase before him (Ma'aserot 2:5B), or when he has estab- lished a domain of privacy in his shop (Ma'aserot 2:2). The Houses' dispute at Ma'aserot 4:2B, we observe, stands in relation to all of these positions precisely as it stands in relation to Ma'aserot 4:2A. It spells out the ultimate implications of two lines of reasoning which are first imposed upon the law of tithes in the Ushan stratum of the tractate. The Hillelites, pressing home the view of Ma'aserot 4:2A, Ma'aserot 1:8B, and Meir, hold that intentions are effective prior to any confirming action because they are in principle independent of them, imposing liability as soon as they are clearly expressed. The Shammaites, representing Yose and</page><page sequence="19">MISHNAIC LITERARY HISTORY 153 Judah, insist that intentions do require some confirming act to mobilize their power, and so have no effect until acted upon at the appropriate moment. If this analysis is at all convincing, it demonstrates that the present dispute constitutes a literary forum within which the final editors of Tractate Ma'aserot explore divergent theoretical positions unresolved in their own day. In this context it serves two functions. Read, first of all, against the backround of the tractate as a whole, the dispute explains why two divergent views struggle for dominance among the most recent authorities of the trac- tate. The reason, we are told, is historical, originating in a fundamental difference of opinion dividing the forefathers of the rabbinic community. Second, read as the foundation of Judah's ruling at Ma'aserot 4:2C, the dispute helps to obscure what appears to be his opposition to Hillelite thought in the tractate as a whole. Here Judah is portrayed, despite his views in Ma'aserot and elsewhere, as a thoroughgoing Hillelite.23 Thus a major Ushan authority is enlisted into the Hillelite camp during the period at which its champions are shaping, in their own image, the legal thought and historical picture of the emerging rabbinic movement.24 Conclusions These observations about the exegetical nature of the present dispute are intended to have implications beyond the context of Tractate Ma'aserot, for they suggest that the appearance of pseudepigraphy in the Mishnah can be 23. Zeitlin, Studies, p. 80, assumes without argument that Judah is a "Shammaite." This view is rejected by most recent scholars in favor of a general affiliation with the Akivan school. See Epstein, Literature, pp. 106-125, and A. Goldberg, "And All of Them Are in Accord with R. Akiva" [Heb.], Tarbiz 38, no. 3 (1969): 282-286. Both discussions stress Judah's dependence upon the teaching of Eliezer b. Hyrcanus, who is often describerd as a "Shammaite," but find no firmer evidence linking Judah to Shammaite traditions. For its part, Y. Ma'aserot 3:5, 50d, clearly assumes that Judah is a disciple of Akiva. The results of the present work simply suggest that instances of Judah's corroboration of Hillelite traditions must be scrutinized with great care. 24. The critical role of Ushans in working out a political history of the rabbinic movement rooted in the premise of Hilllelite descent has been identified by Neusner. See Pharisees, 3:282-286 for a summary of the results. For an attempt to reconstruct the actual academic politics of the rabbinic elite during this period, see A. Baumgarten, "The Politics of Reconcilia- tion: The Education of Judah the Prince," in E. P. Sanders et al., eds., Jewish and Christian Self-Definition, vol. 2 (Philadelphia,1981), pp. 213-225. Baumgarten's observations regarding the role of Judah b. Ilai (pp. 224-225) are of special relevance.</page><page sequence="20">154 MARTIN S. JAFFEE construed as a formal act of exegesis, an inner-mishnaic phenomenon which inaugurates as well the history of the text's interpretation. Further analyses of this sort would make a genuine contribution to the ultimate task of con- structing the early history of rabbinic ideas. In the present case, at least, the internal evidence marshaled for my thesis is supplemented most compellingly by the witness of Tosefta Ma'aserot. Here a revision of Ma'aserot 4:2 serves two crucial exegetical functions: (1) it resolves the theoretical tension which Ma'aserot 4:2 has sought to preserve in Tractate Ma'aserot, and (2) it frames a more convinc- ing argument for Judah's subscription to Hillelite views. The Tosefta's version of Ma'aserot 4:2 follows:25 A. A Sabbath basket, etc. (= Ma'aserot 4:2B) B. R. Judah says, "Hillel himself used to forbid it."26 C. One who gathers a basket, etc. (=Ma'aserot 4:2C) D. R. Judah says, "Hillel himself used to forbid it." E. One who transports [untithed] figs from place to place, and the Sabbath overtook them [before the end of the journey], at the close of the Sabbath, he shall not eat unless he tithes. F. R. Judah says, "Hillel himself used to forbid it." The pericope consists of three rulings (A, C, E), each supplied with an identi- cal gloss in Judah's name (B, D, F). A and C, of course, simply cite Ma'aserot 4:2B-C, while E revises Ma'aserot 2:3 in the spirit of Ma'aserot 4:2A. The contribution of the Tosefta to the Mishnah's discussion lies in Judah's glosses. First of all, Judah lends authority to the Hillelite positions of the 25. I translate the text of S. Lieberman, Tosefta Zera'im (New York, 1955), pp. 237-238. Cf. T. Eduyyot 2:4 in M. S. Zuckermandel, Tosephta (repr., Jerusalem, 1970), p. 457. 26. hll 'vmw hyh 'wsr. So, too, T. Eduyyot 2:4. Cf. B. Be:ah 35a: hll I'Vmw hyh 'wsr and Rashi, ad loc. As Epstein (Literature, p. 102) and Lieberman (Tosefta Ki- fshuta, 2:694-695) point out, the correct reading at B, D, and F is that of the Tosefta. Following Rashi, Lieberman interprets the statement to mean that in Judah's view only Hillel in his generation held to the views which the Mishnah ascribes to the Hillelites. Accordingly, the Tosefta, through Judah, represents the Shammaite view as that of the normative majority. I would find Lieberman's interpretation more convincing had he explained why the Tosefta would represent Judah as denying a position (M. Ma'aserot 4:2C/T. Ma'aserot 3:3D) which, in the Mishnah, is reported in his name. Insofar as the Tosefta inherits the Hillelite bias of the Mishnah, it is difficult to explain why it would deliberately reverse the Mishnah's tendency to link prestigious authorities to the "normative" lineage of Hillel-Akiva-Simeon b. Gamaliel-Rabbi.</page><page sequence="21">MISHNAIC LITERARY HISTORY 155 Mishnah by indicating that these views stem directly from the teaching of Hillel himself. Thus, the Mishnah's willingness to preserve conceptual tension by ascribing it to a fundamental dispute of the disciples of Hillel and Shammai is rejected by the Tosefta. It destroys the tension by arguing that the Hillelites struggled not for the victory of their own independent judge- ment, but rather for the preservation of their Master's teaching. Secondly, the Tosefta makes an important revision of Ma'aserot 4:2C. The ruling no longer belongs to Judah, as the Mishnah would have it, but rather repre- sents an anonymous "tradition" which, as Judah now indicates, stems from Hillel. Thus the Tosefta accepts and improves upon the Mishnah's attempt to link Judah to Hillelite perspectives on the operation of intention as a factor independent of corroborative actions. From one who proposes rul- ings harmonious with the Hillelite view (Ma'aserot 4:2C), Judah now becomes a tradent of the Hillelite school, whose own views are not simply congruent with Hillel's, but are rather repetitions of those of the Master. The significance of this Toseftan discussion for the concerns of this paper may be stated most simply. It testifies to a continuity of interests linking the Mishnah's redactors to its earliest self-conscious exegetes. Indeed, Ma'ase- rot 4:2 and its Toseftan supplement are both interpretations of the central issues worked out in M. Ma'aserot. Their subtle differences indicate only that the biases of the mishnaic redactors against the Shammaite tradition are intensified in Toseftan materials.27 In the obscure period between the close of the Mishnah and its reception as an authoritative work, then, we are able to discern not only the end of a process of redaction, but the beginning of an exegetical tradition.28 University of Virginia Charlottesville, Va. 27. Cf. T. Eduyyot 2:3: Normative law (hlkh) always accords with the words of the House of Hillel. 28. In a paper entitled "The Power of Intention: The Yerushalmi's Reception of a Mishnaic Idea" (AJS Annual Meeting, December 1984), I have traced the problems raised in M. Ma'aserot into the exegetical pericopae of Yerushalmi Ma'aserot. The result of that study will be published shortly in my introduction to The Talmud of the Land of Israel, vol. 7, Maaserot (Chicago, expected for 1986).</page></plain_text>
