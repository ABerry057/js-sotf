Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College Press, 2000. xvi, 367 pp. Fox's objective is "to refine current definitions of titles of royal functionar- ies and their roles in the monarchic state-organization and to create a tentative re- construction of the government structure" (p. 269). Secondarily, she questions whether "Israelite officialdom and administrative practices were modeled after foreign prototypes" (p. 276f). Fox considers the Bible "the most substantial and comprehensive account" (p. ix) for the evaluation of Israelite social history, consisting of authentic docu- ments and ideology-oriented interpretations. Construing Israel's social history means, according to Fox, to supplement the Biblical texts with extra-biblical epi- graphic evidence. Her approach is Bible-centered, Israel-centered, and traditions- oriented. This approach is not universally shared any longer (Edelman, 19911; Grabbe, 19972; Niemann, 20013; Knauf, 20014). 1.

These are arranged according to a new classification: four "Status-Related-Titles" (bn hmlk, bd hmlk, zqnym, yldym); eleven "Function- Related Titles" (' r 1l hbyt, spr, mzkyr, rch hmlk, m'nh, yw's lmlk, '~r 'l hms, nsb/ nsbym, 'sr heyr, Ar, ppt, S'r); and four "Miscellaneous Designations" (skn/sknt, n r/nerh, SAr, srys) (pp. 43-203). Some recent studies on the titles of state em- ployees discussing these officials within the context of social history and govern- mental structural control are not discussed, nor is the question of when Israel and Judah became full-blown states, which by definition required administrative staff (Jamieson-Drake 19915; Niemann 19936; 19977; recently Knauf 20008). The re- sults of Fox's enquiry are somewhat predetermined by the use of such traditional terms as "beginnings of a bureaucracy," "a more sophisticated administrative ap- paratus" and "centralized complex governmental system" for the reigns of Saul, David and Solomon (p. 5). On the other hand, Fox's analysis of seals, bullae, and other administrative artifacts as ostraca and inscribed weights reveals a respectable acquaintance with current epigraphical research. Fox takes as historical the ideological presentation of, for example, David and Solomon's "United Kingdom" with its "provinces" and "districts" read by some modern scholars into the Biblical narrative. Fox does not apply or conceive empirical tests for categories such as "general taxation," "district prefects" (p. 273), and "empire-building phase of Solomon's reign" (p. 278), or for "twelve- district division ... an Israelite innovation established for efficient governing of a complex system" (p. 279). Nor does she reflect the compass of these notions. "Highly centralized government organization" is used to describe Hezekiah's rule (p. 234, 275). Such a traditional approach leads to an understanding of the royal administration in Israel and Judah that has been bypassed by new insights put for- ward in the past ten years (Jamieson-Drake 1991; Niemann 1993; 1997; 20009). The most important resource for the reconstruction of social and political hi- erarchies presently at our disposal has not been considered at all: settlement archae- ology. The sociopolitical impact of spatial organization has been made accessible to the non-specialist by works like Kempinski and Reich 199210; Herzog 19971. Fox relies on Deuteronomistic textual support to claim that "the archaeological picture of the Iron Age IIA ... indicates the existence of a state exhibiting the characteris- 5. Jamieson-Drake, D.

The gradual development of power and administration in Israel and Judah (Niemann 1993) is thus leveled out. The last chapter is the most innovative one: "Aspects of Administration Re- vealed in Inscriptions: Land Grants, Supply Networks and Regional Administra- tion" (pp. 204-68). Fox favors A. E Rainey's interpretation of the Samaria Ostraca. The reviewer has tried to integrate the Samaria Ostraca in a more comprehensive social and political context (Niemann 1993: 75-86, 274-5; 2000: 71, n. 11). Fox does not enter into this discussion, but she offers a new hypothesis to understand the Imlk stamp seal impressions: the jars with Imlk stamps plus private seals im- pressions belong to royal estates, handed over to members of the ruling elite whose name appears on the handle. Fox interprets the Imlk stamps plus private seals not only in the context of war preparations, but also as an indicator of the economic development under Hezekiah. However, when the seal impressions are interpret- ed as signs of a "highly centralized government organization" (p. 234, 275), I think that Fox stretches the possible implications of this single type of archaeological evidence too far; the integration of more archaeological data is badly needed. The impressive corpus of 1716 seal impressions recorded up to now does, in any case, reveal an increasing interest of the eighth century's Jerusalemite dynasty in eco- nomic organization. Fox understands the "Rosette stamp seals" as symbols of an increasingly centralized state-economy. At the same time these seals might under- line national independence in Josiah's time. Finally, Fox deals with "Systems of Accounting: Hieratic Numerals and oth- er Symbols" (pp. 250-268) with particular care. The large majority of stratified finds come from the seventh and sixth centuries B.C.E.; few come from the eighth. These dates match the development of state organization in Israel and Judah, which I presented in 1993 on the basis of archaeological, epigraphic, and textual evidence. Differences of forms, uses, and individual scribal traditions between Is- rael and Egypt lead Fox to conclude that "conscious borrowing of a foreign phe- nomenon never actually took place" (p. 268; see p. 279). According to her, since the early monarchy or even earlier (sic!), the Israelite bureaucracy made use of lo- cal and regional counting-systems. The differences between Israel and Egypt show an early Israelitizing process and the independence of the Israelite administration from earlier foreign administrative systems (p. 279). Few "foreign terms and fea- tures" in state organization and in bureaucratic terminology, according to Fox, point to the same direction. Vis-a-vis the world-systems approach presently gain- ing ground in Ancient Near Eastern studies, these results recall a period of research that was dominated by ethnocentric parochialisms. These critical remarks do not intend to detract from a welcome addition to the scholar's library. One would have wished, though, that central European schol- arship had been considered beyond the late 1980s. Hermann Michael Nieman University of Rostock Rostock, Germany 111</page></plain_text>
