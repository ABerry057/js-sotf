<plain_text><page sequence="1">BETWEEN IDENTITY AND ANONYMITY: ART AND HISTORY IN AHARON MEGGED'S FOIGLMAN by RACHEL FELDHAY BRENNER This precisely is the original role of narrative . . . to establish a theater of legitimacy for effective action. -Michel de Certeau In a recent article, "Israeli Literature Over Time," Aharon Megged describes his work as "unremittingly concerned with burning national issues," mainly with the issue of Israel's relationship to the Diaspora.' Megged's intense preoccupation with the Zionist ideology of the negation of the Diaspora emerged in his 1955 story "Yad va-shem" ("The Name"). The story presents a scathing criticism of Israel's dissociation from the history of the Diaspora and especially from the catastrophe of the Holocaust. "Yad va-shem" was followed by an article entitled "Tarbutenu ha-yeshana ve-ha-hadasha" ("Our Old and New Culture") in which Megged deplored Israel's severance of its Diaspora roots and urged a reexamination of the negative attitude toward the destroyed European Jewish culture.2 In 1984, Megged published Massa ha-yeladimn el ha-aretz ha-muvtachat ("The Children's Journey"), a novel 1.

The popularity of the novel as well as its critical reception demonstrates that the story of Foiglman's rejection by the Israeli environment, which ends in a tragedy of madness and death, touches a raw nerve in the Israeli reader. Practically all critical readings of the novel identify with the Foiglman character and approve of Megged's view of Israel's dissociation from the Holocaust victim. Thus, in an article poignantly entitled "A Continuous Holocaust," Hillel Weiss praises Foiglman for condemning Israel's attitude toward the Diaspora and claims that the story exposes "the shame and degradation of the Jewish- intellectual swamp which purports to contend with the enigma of Jewish history."6 A review by A. B. Yoffe, entitled "The Birdman," suggests that the "message" of the novel indicates that "we cannot build our present culture and lay the foundation for a future culture without taking into account the [Yiddish] heritage of the past."7 Ziva Shamir's article, "A Yiddish Songbird," sees the book as a reminder to Israelis that "Jewish destiny continues to haunt its victims," even when they do not consider themselves as such, and points to the novel's indeterminate view of the Jewish future.8 A review by Abraham Blatt, "Language and Fate," detects some hope for a future reconciliation of past and present.

The centrality of Foiglman, the "Yiddish songbird," in the reviews reflects Israel's present readiness to reexamine its attitudes toward the Diaspora and, especially, toward victims of the Holocaust. The unusual compatibility of author and critics concerning the issue of Israel-Diaspora relations denotes the novel as an ideologically oriented text the appeal of which lies in its "up-to-dateness" or "political correctness." Even a less favorable review of the novel appears under the nostalgic title "To Yiddish with Love" and claims that "the timing of Aharon Megged's Foiglman is correct. [The novel] does not need to swim against the current."'0 The reviewers appear to posit the novel as a reflection of, rather than a reflection upon, Israel's changing view of the Diaspora. Their emphasis on the virtues of the forgotten Yiddish language and culture presents the text as a "transparency" of Israel's transgressions against Jewish history. This critical approach discloses the sense of remorse over Israel's regrettably misplaced ideological dogmatism. Due to constraints of time and space, the critical reviews understandably focus on the novel's content, a reading which highlights the "realistic" illus- tration of social situation and attitudes. A more comprehensive interpretation of the text, however, can hardly evade a consideration of its literary form, especially in terms of its impact upon the reader. I would argue that the generic mode and the narrative voice in Foiglman intend to elicit a particular response from the reader. Of special importance is the positioning of the novel's narrative voice. As Emile Benveniste tells us, "Consciousness of self is only possible if it is experienced by contrast. I use I only when I am speaking to someone who will be a you in my address."" The novel's confessional narrative induces readers to define themselves as a "you" vis-a-vis the narrator and to respond to the voice in the text. The dialogic contact with the text is established, therefore, through the genre of fictional autobiography. The autobiographical construct suggests the centrality of the Israeli narrator, Zvi Arbel, rather than of Foiglman, 9.

The affinity between Israeli narrator and Israeli reader drives home the text's outlook on the Diaspora problematic. The Israeli narrator's confession of his relationship with Foiglman and of the tragic consequences of this relationship evokes a sense of identification with Arbel's experiences. The Israeli background which readers share with Arbel supersedes the nostalgic, but indirect and therefore abstract, sympathy with the Foiglman story. Furthermore, the confession, as a narrative ploy to involve the reader, suggests the significance of the artistic form in the literary exploration of Israel's position regarding the Diaspora. I would argue that while the content of the novel stresses the mea culpa attitude for the ideology of disengagement from the exile, the form of fictional autobiography underlines an intention not only to come to terms with the denied past, but also to rectify Israel's politics of the negation of the Diaspora. The novel, as a fictional self-exploration vis-a-vis the inescapable reality of the lost heritage, reflects, therefore, a complex view of Israel's changing attitudes toward the Diaspora. Instead of a merely regretful retrospection of Israel's mistakes, as demonstrated, for instance, in the definitive detachment from the world of Grandfather Ziskind in "Yad va-shem," Arbel's intro- spection brings forth an attempt to reverse the movement of history and correct past misjudgments in the context of the present. I would suggest that as a life story, the narrative presents a complex attempt of meeting and mending history, that is, of reassimilating that which has been eliminated, of reaffirming that which has been negated. The sophisticated construct of historian-turned-autobiographer seems to imply that the transformation of an historical reality is possible. As this reading of the novel demonstrates, the autobiographer's exploration of the past calls attention to his artistic growth. The transformation from telling history into telling one's own story signals that the ability to amend historical misconceptions is predicated upon the power of artistic imagination and creativity. It is interesting to note that the thematic of mending the past emerges prominently in Megged's earlier work, Massa be-av ("Journey in the Month of Av").12 Here, the protagonist, Daniel Levine, who, like Arbel, reexamines his life, fantasizes about moving history backward, about undoing the past. In more than one sense, Levine can be seen as Arbel's prototype. A physicist whose research focuses on the relativity of time, Levine deplores his escape 12. Aharon Megged, Massa be-av (Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 1980).</page><page sequence="5">ART AND HISTORY IN MEGGED'S FOIGLMAN 363 into the world of science, an evasion which has caused the tragic disintegration of his family. In a similar way, Arbel's life story reveals two disconnected personality facets. An eminent professor of Jewish history, Arbel escapes from the world into his research, which explores the patterns that have shaped the history of the Jewish people. His emotional aloofness brings about the deaths of Nora, his wife, and of Foiglman, his best friend. Arbel's emotional account of his personal grief and self-recrimination unfolds in an attempt to understand his life. Georges Gusdorf's argument that social roles hinder self-knowledge and that "a knowledge of the self can appear only when the role is revealed to be nothing but a role"" may help to explain Arbel's undertaking to write an autobiographical account at a time of familial and professional crisis. Divested of his roles as husband, father, friend, teacher, and scholar, Arbel faces a void he can neither comprehend nor assimilate. His conscious decision to tell his life story indicates a search for an understanding of his "public" and "private" selves through the art of self-representation. The act of writing compels Arbel to re-view his life as a story. The distance that he gains through self-writing raises the awareness of his emotional inadequacy. This growing self-awareness brings forth the realization of the power of art. Toward the end of the novel, that is, toward the end of his autobiography, Arbel claims to have reached a new understanding of the relationship between history and literature. He realizes that it is the great writers, the novelists, who see deeper and further than us [the historians]. And the reason is that they, unlike us, focus not on events but on people; they plumb the deeper recesses of the soul. And the future, mankind's future, after all, depends on the vicissitudes of the human soul. (p. 243)14 This general statement, typical of a scholarly analysis, gains personal rel- evance in the subsequent, unsparing self-accusation: "I, who all my life have examined the minute details of events, did I hear the anguished cry of Nora's soul?" (p. 243). The question reveals Arbel's growing understanding 13.

This honest self-recrimination points to an emerging, critical self-perspective. Significantly, Arbel's realization constitutes a further development of the central motif of interpersonal relationships in Megged's other works. In Mahberot Evyatar ("The Notebooks of Evyatar"), Olga, who eventually commits suicide, complains about her husband: "He is so egocentric, so inconsiderate. He does not appear to see the other person at all."'5 In Ha-gamal ha-meofef ve-dabbeshet ha-zahav ("The Flying Camel and the Golden Hump"), Lily confronts her husband, the writer Kalman Keren, in almost identical terms: "You are absolutely insensitive to others. You are horribly egocentric."'6 In contrast with these works, in Foiglman it is the husband who berates himself for having failed his wife. He thus reemphasizes Megged's existentialist credo regarding the importance of empathic interpersonal relationships, summed up in the novel Al eytzim ve-avanim ("Of Trees and Stones"): "Your identity is determined not only by yourself but by others. ... You are not only what you think you are, but what you are for the other and what the other is for you."'7 Arbel's awareness of his inferiority as an historian vis-a-vis great literary writers signals his desire to emulate their insights into the mystery of being human, to gain an understanding of himself and his relationships with others. Writing one's life signals a powerful need to reach an inner truth; a self-knowledge that, Gusdorf claims, is unrelated to the public roles imposed by the external world. At the same time, autobiographical writing signifies a process aimed at understanding "the roles, the reified versions of personality that serve to represent the self to others."'8 Inner knowledge thus can be attained only through an autobiographical re-vision of one's self in social interaction. Arbel's comprehension of himself is predicated upon self-exploration in the context of his social environment. Arbel's social situation displays a split between family relationships and professional life. The appearance of Foiglman precipitates the collapse of both his "private" and "public" domains. The poet-survivor confronts the 15. Aharon Megged, Mahberot Evyatar (Jerusalem: Hakibbutz ha-Meuchad, 1973), p. 66 (my translation). 16.

Subsequently, the historian engages in an endeavor which upsets the distinction between his family and his profession: by extending hospitality to the Holocaust survivor, he undertakes to integrate the consciousness of the Diaspora past into his family's present. Arbel's attempt to restructure his family life as a metonymic representation of mended history ends up in his wife's suicide, Foiglman's death, and the narrator's own ruin. Of the three, only the narrator, who transforms his misfortune into the art of autobiographical writing, suggests redemption in creative search for self- knowledge. An autobiography, Arbel's story combines his personal story and his historical research. The conflation raises the issue of affinity between per- sonal and collective narratives. The desire to define the historical forces which determine an individual life and the life of nations informs Arbel's Weltanschauung. As an historian, he examines the notion of historical "master narratives" which convey the sense of universal order and define history as "vita magistra" (p. 152), the teacher of life. In terms of his private life, he searches for the meaning of the "master narratives" that have shaped his personal history. In a way, Foiglman's fate determines the master narrative of Arbel's life story. A representative of the destroyed Jewish culture, Foiglman triggers Arbel's hubristic undertaking to mend history. At the same time, as a poet dedicated to the commemoration of the Holocaust, Foiglman raises Arbel's consciousness of the endurance of art in the face of historical upheavals. In the end, Foiglman loses his battle against Israel's indifference toward the Diaspora. Foiglman's defeat, however, does not spell the end of art. Rather, it becomes a legacy which engenders artistic inspiration, articulated in Arbel's autobiographical undertaking. In fact, Arbel indicates the extent of Foiglman's impact upon his life when he points to the Yiddish poet as the raison d'etre of his autobiographical project: "An explanation is in order," Arbel writes. "I must explain how a strange man entered my life and destroyed it." And he blames his misfortune upon "this whole relationship between us-this unexpected, uncalled for, one might say compulsive relationship" (pp. 32-33). Elsewhere, in a more conciliatory mood, Arbel notes the depth of his friendship with Foiglman: "My fate became inextricably entwined with Foiglman's fate: bonds of affection and suffering united us" (p. 252). The motif of the centrality of the other in</page><page sequence="8">366 RACHEL FELDHAY BRENNER the individual's life, a motif that underscores Megged's oeuvre, resurges in Foiglman, casting the Yiddish poet as a refraction of Arbel's psyche. Arbel's urgency to explore his self-image as reflected in and through his re- lationship with Foiglman emerges at the center of this fictional autobiography. Foiglman, as a force which spurs Arbel's autobiographical undertaking, posits the Yiddish "birdman" as the Israeli's "winged muse." As a metaphorical representation of Arbel's hitherto-unrecognized creative potential, Foiglman deflates Arbel's social role and actualizes his introspective, artistic self.'9 A Holocaust survivor, Foiglman represents undeniable evidence of both biological and historical destruction. The victim-witness of the Holocaust replaces the faith in the eternity of human existence with an awareness of a recent apocalypse.20 Arbel's wish to reconnect with the history of the Holocaust through bonding with Foiglman sets him apart from the other members of his family, who, both emotionally and conceptually, dissociate themselves from Foiglman and his past. Arbel's claim to reconnect with the lost heritage differs considerably from that of the protagonist in a classical novel. As a rule, the classical heroes rebel against social conventions and paternal authority; thus, they repudiate the repetitive patterns of heritage and tradition.21 In contrast, Arbel assumes an antagonistic position vis-a-vis the classical rebel. Furthermore, in a paradoxical reversal, his identification with heredity and heritage constitutes a serious transgression against the Israeli concept of familial loyalty. In terms of generational continuum, the narrator stands between his father and his son, both of whom refuse to recognize their historical linkage with the annihilated European Jewry. Arbel's preoccupation with his Jewish heritage, 19. Nabokov's Lolita presents a similar case. An interpretation of the character of Lolita as a refraction of Humbert Humbert's psyche outlines a parallel to Foiglman as an embodiment of the repressed, or latent, component of Arbel's personality. 20. Foiglman serves as a reminder of Jonathan Schell's observation that genocide can be seen as "the end of civilization [because it signifies] the total disorganization and disruption of human life, breaking the links between mankind's past and its future" (p. 146). In the post-Holocaust era, as Schell maintains, we face the knowledge which undermines our trust that "our species is biologically immortal" (p. 118).

In his discussion of repetition in the classical novel, Edward Said argues that "To be novel is to be ... a figure not repeating what most men perforce repeat, namely, the course of human life, father to son. . . .

Angus Fletcher (New York: Columbia University Press, 1975), p. 145.</page><page sequence="9">ART AND HISTORY IN MEGGED'S FOIGLMAN 367 and, specifically, his interest in the history of persecutions of Jews in Europe, incurs their anger and disappointment. Arbel's father is an archaeologist, obsessed with excavating the Canaanite past of the Land of Israel. He deplores his son's refusal to follow the dictum "Truth shall spring out of the earth," and disapproves of his son's reverting "to the type of the Jewish scholar, steeped in books, expounding texts" (p. 62). Arbel's father's obsession with the Canaanite land and civilization reflects the desire to forget his own European origins and, with them, the destroyed European Jewish civilization. Arbel's son, Yoav, whose name alludes to the biblical King David's ruthless general, is an army officer who defends Israel with great dedication and patriotism. He despises his father's preoccupation with "the rabbis," for whom he has had a "fundamental, deep-seated, hostility from early childhood" (p. 147). According to Yoav, Jewish suffering in the Diaspora is the direct result of Jewish self-betrayal, that is, the inability or unwillingness of the Diaspora Jews to defend themselves (p. 135). Both Yoav and his grandfather consider Arbel's preoccupation with Jewish suffering in the Diaspora a transgression of the ideological principle of the "new Israeli Jew." While the grandfather "uncovers" the Canaanite past in his archaeological digs, the grandson actualizes the analogy between the free and fearless Hebrew settlement in the land of Canaan and the rebirth of the State of Israel. Both characters dissociate from the two thousand years of Jewish suffering in the Diaspora which culminated in the destruction of the Holocaust. Their treatment of the Diaspora as an historical hiatus intends to erase the memory of Jewish impotence. The omission communicates the desire to bypass that segment of history which undermines the Israeli self-image as heroic maker of Jewish history. Ironically, the insistence of the "new Israelis" on their origins in the heroic, preexilic period signals the weakness of self-deception. The archaeologist and the soldier deliberately reformulate the history of the Jewish people in accordance with their own needs and purposes. Unlike his son and his father, who would rather not face the issue, Arbel's lifelong involvement with Jewish history in Europe points to his preoccupation with the vulnerability of Jewish existence. Arbel's involvement with the chapter of Jewish powerlessness exacts the price of social exclusion. Arbel's deviation from the ideologically prescribed patterns of social behavior places him in the long line of Megged's nonconforming protagonists.</page><page sequence="10">368 RACHEL FELDHAY BRENNER Indeed, Megged himself stresses the centrality of the outsider in his work. "If I were to find a thread running through all my works," he claims in an interview, "it would be the problem of the individual who is marginal in society-in Israeli society, naturally-and who will always remain an outsider (The Case of the Idiot, Asahel, "Heinz and His Son and the Evil Spirit," "The Wizard," and others)."22 In Foiglman, Arbel's adherence to past Jewish weakness and suffering determines his exclusion from the environment which promulgates obliteration of this chapter in Jewish history. As an historian, Arbel focuses on the long history of Jewish persecution by researching the model of the Jewish town of Zamosc, routinely destroyed in the pogroms of Chmielnicki and Petlyura, and finally in the Holocaust. In his scholarly investigation of the patterns of the perennial persecution of the Jews, Arbel reaches the conclusion that the regularity with which the disasters occur rules out the historical "alternative" (p. 83). The alternative, as Arbel writes, is the possibility to speculate retrospectively as to "What would have happened if?" (p. 83). The notion of the alternative underscores the premise that history, as it unfolds, may shape itself into numerous narratives. The outcomes of these narratives are unforeseeable at the time of their happening. This premise, however, does not apply to the history of the Jewish Diaspora, which, as Arbel sees it, is a "replication of events, unlike the history of other peoples" (p. 82). Invariably, the Diaspora tells the story of the cyclical pattern of unavoidable destruction. As a Jewish historian, therefore, Arbel knows in retrospect no more than the victims of the disastrous events knew at the time. The recurrence of the tragic fate of the previous generations elucidated for each following generation the tragic outcome of its plight. The Jewish historian becomes a chronicler who merely registers the events, or as Arbel observes, "a 'nature researcher,' a biologist-as history becomes biology" (p. 84). Arbel, however, cannot remain an impassive chronicler or an objective scientist vis-a-vis the disastrous history of his people. Unlike his father and his son, who dissociate themselves from the history of Jewish victimization, Arbel cannot help identifying with the persecuted Jews. He tells us that when he conducts his research, "I feel as if I myself was there, in the 'towns of slaughter,' among those fleeing to the fort ... among those huddling together in the synagogue ... among those hiding in the cellars" (p. 84). His empathic 22. Aharon Megged in interview with Anat Feinberg, Modern Hebrew Literature, Winter 1988, p. 48.</page><page sequence="11">ART AND HISTORY IN MEGGED'S FOIGLMAN 369 response to the victim leads him into the land of the annihilated. It estranges him from the present as he becomes increasingly reclusive. Seemingly a typical professor immersed in his research, Arbel immerses himself in the reality of the horror that he recreates. Eventually, he projects himself as a victim. Arbel's insistence on claiming the terrible fate of his people as his own signals a dangerous proposition. By assimilating the victim's fate in the Diaspora, Arbel runs the risk of a-historicizing himself, as his identification with the collective, anonymous victim endangers his identity. An excessive degree of empathy with the Diaspora Jew threatens not only to outdate his function as an historian; it also draws him into the orbit of the anonymity of cyclical annihilation. Arbel cannot fail to see the danger in his association with the Diaspora horror. At the same time, he cannot associate himself with the fiction of Israeli Jews as descendants of the Canaanites, a tendentious misreading of history which has left Israel rootless in terms of its heritage and national identity. The viability of Israel as the center of Jewish life and culture in the post-Holocaust era is predicated upon the acknowledgment of its affinity with the Diaspora. The appearance of Foiglman, a representative of the denied past, indicates the possibility to incorporate the Diaspora past's story into Israel's evolving story and thus to revitalize Jewish history on Israeli ground. The opportunity that emerges, as Arbel sees it, is that of a Hebrew-Yiddish cultural synthesis, whereby Foiglman's immersion in the Israeli landscape becomes an emblematic representation of such a merger. Arbel develops a plan according to which Foiglman will continue to live in Paris, but will spend half a year in Israel; he will continue to write in Yiddish, but his poems will be translated into Hebrew and published in Israel. Arbel rationalizes his solution by stressing the importance of the qualitative rather than the quantitative value of an historical event. He observes that "It is the good deeds-few and far between though they may be-that need emphasizing, so that hope, like a little candle, will light up mankind's path" (p. 152). The cultural alliance promises the reconnection of Israel with its historical roots. On the one hand, in its Hebrew translation, Yiddish poetry, as a representative of the Yiddish heritage, can no longer remain ignored. On the other hand, the exposure of the Holocaust survivor to the vibrancy of Israeli life will integrate the Jewish victim into the Jewish homeland. This cultural synthesis signifies a daring attempt to change the course of history. Not only</page><page sequence="12">370 RACHEL FELDHAY BRENNER will the vitality of Yiddish poetry in Israel defy the Nazi Final Solution, but the transplantation of the Diaspora heritage into Israeli culture will terminate the vicious cycle of Jewish cultural and physical destruction. Had Arbel's plan of an alternative course of history proven successful, the annihilated Diaspora heritage would have been reborn in Israel's consciousness. Ironically, the preposterous "alternative of the Death Ray" (p. 254) suggested by Foiglman communicates the failure of Arbel's plan. Absolutely certain that Israel's enemies will destroy the Jewish state in the same way as the Germans exterminated the Jews of Europe, Foiglman proposes to invent a lethal weapon which will destroy the enemies of Israel. Foiglman's doomsday plan stands in opposition to Arbel's desire to break the cyclical pattern of Jewish history. This plan is, in fact, a reiteration of the cycle of destruction and death which has informed the history of European Jewry. The historical alternative offered by Foiglman amounts to the end of all history. His alternative thus constitutes a parodic commentary on Arbel's plan to infuse Jewish history with the hopeful alternative of the unknown. Foiglman's expectation of another Holocaust marks the unbridgeable gap between the Diaspora Jew and the "new" Israel. It is not only Israel's reluctance to acknowledge the Diaspora past as its own that creates the distance from the Holocaust survivor. It is also the inability of the survivor, the product of the Diaspora, to accept, let alone to internalize, the "un- Jewish," carefree and secular Israeli lifestyle. With regard to the victim of the Holocaust, Israel seems unable to generate the hope of a new beginning; the lifestyle that it offers cannot alleviate the burden of the past. Foiglman is totally immersed in the memory of his Holocaust experience, which he constantly lives and relives through reminiscences, testimonies, and stories of the Holocaust. Thus, for instance, in the first meeting in Arbel's house Foiglman constantly refers to the Holocaust. The fact that Nora was born in Munich brings forth the story of his unexpected meeting with his twin brother at the Munich cathedral after he was liberated from Majdanek (pp. 44-45). The fact that Arbel's father was born in Riga makes him reminisce about an editor of a Yiddish newspaper in Riga who "later committed suicide in the Warsaw ghetto by drinking poison" (p. 45). Even Daumier's drawing of Rosinante reminds him of "the death-train in Don Quixote" (p. 47). Foiglman's name, which connotes the idea of a wandering bird, signifies the intuitive return of the migrant to his native place. Foiglman's inability to leave Europe, the site of the Holocaust, signals the failure of the Diaspora</page><page sequence="13">ART AND HISTORY IN MEGGED'S FOIGLMAN 371 Jew to set himself free of the Holocaust nightmare, whose haunting memory eventually drives him to madness and causes his death. Death, which, as his brother sees it, "lurked and stayed in wait for him-for both of us, all the time that we were there [in the death camp]," has finally caught up with him because of his failure to make Israel his home (p. 13). At the same time, Foiglman's inability to detach himself from the Diaspora and settle in Israel foregrounds Israel's inability to set itself free from Jewish history. In this sense, the inextricable roots of the Yiddish poet in Europe reveal Israel's rootedness in the Diaspora soil. It is therefore not surprising that the nightmare of the destruction catches up with the "new" Israel despite its self-imposed oblivion of the Diaspora. Ironically, Israel's indelible roots in the Diaspora emerge most evidently in the character of Arbel's wife and Foiglman's fiercest antagonist, Nora. The characterization of Nora demonstrates that willed repression of the past does not effect a transition from historical cyclicity to historical progression. Despite her vehement dissociation from the past, Nora, like Foiglman, is trapped in a memory which eventually destroys her. Nora's parents, German- Jewish refugees, have never recovered from their enforced flight from Nazi Germany. Traumatized by her parents' lifelong unhappiness, haunted by her childhood memories of Germany, Nora struggles to repress her fear of helplessness and humiliation. Nora's attitude toward the history of Jewish suffering is reflected in her professional life as a biologist. In her laboratory, she examines ways to destroy pests and parasites. Her last experiment involves an attempt to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly by implanting it with a specimen of fungus which would destroy it. It is in "the silent world [of nature] in which ... fierce battles are raging" (p. 258), ineluctably determined by the principle of the survival of the fittest, that she seeks to escape weakness. The empirical material which she can manipulate at will in her test tubes counteracts the helplessness of the Jews vis-a-vis the "biological" patterns of destruction which determined their history in the Diaspora. Not surprisingly, Nora finds the presence of Foiglman unacceptable. His experience confronts her with the reality of the Jew as the "least fit" to survive. Foiglman's emergence from the shadow of the Holocaust undermines Nora's hard-won repression of her past. Her subsequent escape into Israeli nature and her affair with a young Israeli, "a real nature man" (p. 192), to whom she introduces herself as "Nurit," both an Israeli flower and a typically Israeli</page><page sequence="14">372 RACHEL FELDHAY BRENNER female name, do not provide relief. In the end, her recurring dreams, in which she loses her identity and her mind, searching in vain for her house in "an ancient German city" (p. 120), the dreams in which she screams in German (p. 137), become too powerful to repress. Nora's suicide amounts to an admission of failure to free herself from the past. Her last will "to be buried next to my father and my mother" (p. 4) conveys her sense of affinity with the heritage of humiliation and powerlessness. Thus, in the end, Nora becomes part of the cyclical mode of destruction of Jewish history which she has been denying for so long. Both Foiglman and Nora die before they can proceed with the actualization of their projects. While Foiglman's planned "Death Ray" remains on the pages of his journal, Nora's experimentation with the Mediterranean fruit fly remains confined to the test tube. The silence which envelops their final projects constitutes a tragic commentary on the Jewish victim's inability to break away from an unavoidably tragic end. In the last entry in his journal, Foiglman ceases to see himself as a poet and, in his madness, pictures himself as an emblem of the approaching apocalypse: "I shall be a black raven, flying around the world shouting: Confound Satan!" (p. 254). The unsigned note and the unfinished experiment are all that Nora leaves behind her. The deaths of Nora and Foiglman highlight the historian's failure to shift the course of history onto the path of open-ended progression. In this sense, the novel tells the story of the demise of the historian. Arbel ends up engulfed in the cycles of destruction which preclude any further study of history. A pathetic figure, devastated by his losses, he embodies his own view of the Jewish fate, emerging totally powerless vis-a-vis the forces of destruction that have claimed his loved ones. Himself an "a-historian" now, he wanders in cemeteries, contemplating deaths that he failed to prevent. The story ends showing Arbel observing helplessly how in the decomposing bodies "history [is] transformed into nature" (p. 261). In terms of Arbel's reading of Jewish history's master narratives, his own story provides one more example of this history's inherent element of destruction. In the aftermath of the Holocaust, the history of persecution still claims its victims, even among those who, like Arbel, were not there, but have attempted to contend with its pattern of suffering. While the plot ends on the note of despair and death, however, it does not fully coincide with the message conveyed by the form. As mentioned earlier, the genre of fictional autobiography is of particular importance; it suggests</page><page sequence="15">ART AND HISTORY IN MEGGED'S FOIGLMAN 373 that the demise of the historian has generated the birth of the autobiographer. Through the story which tells of his "death" as an historian, Arbel asserts himself as a subject. In his explanation of why he has decided to write his own story, Arbel says that he has never written a diary, because dealing in history ... makes one humble in its presence, reduced to a miniscule grain of sand. .... My study resembled a chamber at the top of a watchtower from which I looked out, into the expanse of time, through transparent glass which does not reflect one's image. Suddenly you are hit on the head; death has penetrated your well-protected chamber, and you hear a voice commanding you: Look inside, man; examine your ways! (p. 32) This depiction of the genesis of his autobiography, especially in terms of its poetic rhetoric, indicates a shift from the historian's orientation to the perspective of a writer. The emphasis on events which he used to observe and interpret in his capacity of historian gives way to an emphasis on his inner, unique self. As an historian, Arbel ignored the spiritual importance of the arts: "I distanced myself from those springs of life, from the arts, of which poetry-more sublime than even history, as Aristotle maintained, is one" (p. 28). It is through the rediscovery of the power of art that the inner self can be explored. Indeed, the poetic language of Arbel's self-description, whereby he sees himself alternately as "a minuscule grain of sand" and in an elevated position on a watchtower, attests to his growing poetic skill. Furthermore, the rhetoric of the metaphor of the undeveloped self-awareness as "transparent glass," the personification of death, and the dramatics of the imperative mode articulate the speaker's quest for self-knowledge. Rather than the historical determinism of the cycles of death, Arbel's imaginative language points to his awakening vitality. Engagement in an artistic discourse signifies the rediscovery of "the arts" as the "springs of life" (p. 28). Arbel's critical assessment of himself as an historian, related from his new stance as an autobiographer, reveals a considerable measure of insight. As an autobiographer, Arbel understands that his historical study provided a rationalization for self-effacement which excused him from the painful obligation of self-examination. The preoccupation with scholarship, which induced a self-projection from the safety of his "watchtower" into the anony- mous crowds of persecuted Jews, created a distance from contemporaries. His passionate "love affair" with history (p. 39) reduced him to "a grain of</page><page sequence="16">374 RACHEL FELDHAY BRENNER sand," and at the same time, paradoxically, instilled the hubristic ambition to master history by altering its patterns. The deaths of Nora and Foiglman change Arbel's worldview. The loss of his dearest people personalizes the notion of collective suffering, a realization which enforces the self-perception of an accountable individual. The growing self-awareness transforms the historian into an artist. Georges Gusdorf helps to elucidate this transformation when he argues that in autobiography, "the artist and the model coincide, the historian tackles himself as object."23 Autobiography is a story grounded in factuality. The autobiographer is, therefore, an historian whose idiosyncratic rhetoric defines him as an artist. The problematic of the historian as a storyteller emerges in the novel itself. Arbel is conscious of the extent of fictionality in his historical writing: When I examine the material I have collected for my research ... knowing that in order to create a coherent picture of life in a certain period, I will have to arbitrarily select facts, there is a question gnawing in my mind: Isn't this kind of historical writing a form of fiction? In what way am I different from a novelist who, just like me, draws his material from reality, but out of it creates a fictional picture? (p. 153) The proximity of history to fiction raises issues concerning the inten- tionality of the novel's genre of fictional autobiography. Why does the author's representation of his narrator take the form of historian turned autobiographer? If autobiography is, in fact, an historical account, and if an historical account is, as Arbel observes, "a form of fiction," in what way does his autobiographical narrative differ from any other historical text that he has composed so far? The borderline case of fictional autobiography, which invokes, yet does not fit, the generic definition of either autobiography or third-person narrative, seems to suggest that truth in narrative may not be sought at the level of either fact or fiction. Arbel's transformation from historian to autobiographer indicates that it is the process of becoming capable of presenting one's life in one's specific mode that leaves us with the truth of the individual as "subject." This subject represents an I, which is unique and unrepeatable, yet 23. Georges Gusdorf," Conditions and Limits of Autobiography," in Autobiography: Essays Theoretical and Critical, ed.

Arbel's autobiographical confrontation with his own history proclaims the possibility of exploding the notion of the individual's anonymity in endless historical cycles. In contrast with Foiglman's and Nora's stories, which bespeak the dead end of the incoherence of madness followed by the silence of death, Arbel opts for the art of self-articulation as the restorative process toward sanity and life. His story addressed to the reader deconstructs the historian's fantasy of the watchtower's isolation and reconnects him with humanity. Remarkably, the self-consciousness that he gains as an autobiographer seems to rectify Arbel's failure as an historian. His realization of the power of creativity enables him to understand that the possibility of reconnecting Jewish past and present lies in a sophisticated confluence of factuality and art. At the same time, his self-analysis leads him to a recognition of the narcissistic aloofness which has separated him from others. The ability to realize that he is but a link in the generations of students and scholars of history presents him with a spiritual heiress, his last loyal student, Gita Jacobovitz. As Arbel's disciple, Gita first follows in her mentor's footsteps and eventually takes over, enthusiastically suggesting art as a way to impress the integrality of the Jewish heritage upon Israeli culture. Having recognized the importance of art, Arbel also recognizes his limitations as an artist. As he admits to Gita, "I can't invent imaginary things" (p. 237). His autobiographical writing, however, has taught him the importance of creative imagination. This realization allows him to encourage Gita to write a novel which will demonstrate the historical connectedness of the Diaspora and Zionism. Wolfgang Iser writes that in autobiography "the independent environment of man is regarded as having the sole function of actualizing the potential of the character."24 In Megged's Foiglman, and, as mentioned before, in many other of his works, it is the ability to interact meaningfully with the human environment that is essential for the character's self-actualization. Having liberated himself from his watchtower, Arbel is capable of re- sponding positively to Gita, and his response promises to restore the broken links with the past. In the sense of reconnection with the past, Gita's own 24.

She is a newcomer to Israel. Her parents came from Kishinev, the infamous site of terrible pogroms against Jews; they spent the war in the camps in Transnistria and then moved to Romania. Unlike Nora or Foiglman, Gita does not seem incapacitated by her family's historical burden of suffering. Her successful integration into the Israeli landscape as a university student, combined with her interest in Jewish history, attests to the possibility of interconnection between the Israeli present and the Diaspora past. Such a possibility emerges in Gita's intention to explore the affinity between the Bundist and Zionist movements through art. Gita plans a novel which will feature Vladimir Medem, the Bundist leader, and Theodor Herzl, the founder of modem Zionism, as protagonists. The novel will focus on the biographical similarities of these two assimilated Jews, who both recognized the perpetuity of Jewish persecution and set out, each in his own way, to implement a solution to the terrible cycle of Jewish suffering. Gita enthusiastically undertaking to write the historical novel stands in contrast to another of Megged's protagonist-writers, Jonas in Ha-hay al ha-met ("The Living on the Dead"). Here the intended biography of one of Israel's founding fathers produces resistance manifested in an inability to write the story. Gita, on the other hand, feels inspired by the subjects of her biographical novel. The search for models for the Israeli identity should, so it seems, extend beyond the history of the state and of the Yishuv. Through an imaginative composition of historical materials, she will attempt to impress upon Israeli readers the extent to which their identity is predicated upon the history of the Diaspora. In Foiglman Megged presents us with an autobiographical novel which promises a sequel of a biographical novel. The text of Foiglman thus seems to call for continuing artistic efforts to bridge over the historical gap of the denial of the Diaspora. The recourse to artistic solutions which emerges in the novel signals an active and creative search for ways to mend the intentional oblivion of the past. The inconclusiveness of the story, which tells of another story yet to be written, highlights the importance of the artistic quest as a redemptive process. Artistic quest implies the hope of renewal, while the originality of art contradicts the notion of anonymity. Megged's novel offers a mimetic representation of a reality which signals new, unconventional solutions. The author uses the familiar in order to seduce us into a consideration of an imaginative deviation from popular patterns of</page><page sequence="19">ART AND HISTORY IN MEGGED'S FOIGLMAN 377 thinking. In this sense, he creates in Foiglman a fictional world which makes us both recall and respond to the forgotten world of the Diaspora and thus, through our imagination, redeem it from oblivion. The awareness of the nation's past restores memory to the consciousness of the present, memory which no longer can be separated from the narrative of historical progression into the future.
