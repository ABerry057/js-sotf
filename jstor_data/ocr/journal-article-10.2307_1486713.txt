<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael Fishbane. The Kiss of God: Spiritual and Mystical Death in Judaism. The Samuel and Althea Stroum Lectures in Jewish Studies. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1994. xii, 156 pp. At the heart of Judaic spirituality lies the concept of the relationship between human beings and the divine. The elucidation of this relationship involved the greatest minds of successive generations of Jewish scholars in a process of creative reinterpretation both of texts and of interpretations of the past. This process has certainly been studied in many ways, but anything resembling a comprehensive treatment has remained a daunting task, given the required mastery of a broad spectrum of texts and genres of thought. It is a testimony to Michael Fishbane's comprehensive vision of the development of spirituality in Judaism that he has succeeded in treating one topic--that of spiritual and mystical death-and utilizing it in an exemplary way to create a small but wonderful book. Both he and the Stroum Lectureship at the University of Washington, under whose auspices the lectures comprising this book were originally delivered, are to be congratulated. It is clear that the command of Deuteronomy 6:5, "You shall love the Lord</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 403 your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might," is central to any analysis of Jewish spirituality. Fishbane's book is, in a sense, an extended commentary on this verse and its implications as unfolded in Jewish sources from the midrash through Bialik, with not infrequent comparative excursions to such non-Jewish philosophers and mystics as Plato and St. John of the Cross. Within Fishbane's "commentary," the reader will find Jews over the course of millennia seeking God through attempts at both physical and spiritual transcendence. This involved them in attempts at total self-sacrifice that, even if phrased differently by philosophers and kabbalists, were designed to bring the true worshipper to the ultimate freedom and happiness of a "dying into God"--death by a divine kiss. This form of "dying" brought the worshipper, as well, to a contemplation of and confrontation with the prospect of a martyr's death either as a preparation for a possible reality or else as a spiritual exercise designed to facilitate the onset of the divine "kiss." Fishbane gives the reader an insightful glimpse into rabbinic Judaism as it engaged in its process of continual self-definition. As he states it, Judaism is "a vast intertextual system whose internal life expands and contracts through exegesis. This is the secret of its spirit; and this is the reason that even the love of God in Judaism is an interpreted love [emphasis in original]. Only tradition can tell the faithful how to love truly. But only the living God can confirm the quest" (p. 13). Ira Robinson Concordia University Montreal, P.Q.</page></plain_text>
