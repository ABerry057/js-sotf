Ishmael, Sifra, Sifrd to Numbers, and Sifrd to Deuteronomy. South Florida Studies in the History of Judaism, no. 4. Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1990. xv, 224 pp. This book deals with connections between major documents of rabbinic literature. "What I want to know, then, is how the four documents commonly called 'Tannaite Midrashim,' namely the Mekhilta Attributed to R. Ishmael, Sifra, and the two Sifr6s, relate to the Mishnah, at the one side, and the Yerushalmi, at the other" (p. xii). To answer this question, Neusner traces the history of seven "indicative ideas, words, themes, or concepts" in the 2. J. Neusner, Judaism in Society: The Evidence of the Yerushalmi (Chicago, 1983), p. 35. 3. E.g., J.

The seven "ideas" are: the Dual Torah, the Gnostic Torah, the Messiah, the Nations (Rome in particular), Israel, Zekhut, and Woman. The author builds on his previous explorations of the Mishnah and the Yerushalmi on the basis of which he has come to view these two documents as representatives of different Judaisms. The present task is to determine whether the presentation of the seven ideas in the tannaitic midrashim is closer to the Mishnah's or the Yerushalmi's expression of these ideas. The background and theoretical framework of this study are described in chapter 1, "Defining and Explaining the Canonical History of Ideas," and in appendix I, "Testing the Method and Value of the Canonical History of Ideas." Chapters 2-8 treat one idea each, first by comparing the presentations of the idea in the Mishnah and the Yerushalmi and then in the midrashic documents. Chapter 9, "The Intellectual Situation of the Tannaitic Midrashim and the Dating of Documents," reviews the results of the discussion of the ideas as reflected in the tannaitic documents. Chapter 10, "The Relevance of the Canonical History of Ideas," reflects the author's response to critiques of his views and his own assessment of the results of this study for understanding the place of the tannaitic midrashim within the corpus of rabbinic literature. In defining and justifying his methodology, Neusner restates conclusions he has reached regarding the major issues in treating rabbinic documents. First, "documentary formulations play a role in the representation of compositions, so that the compositor's formulation of matters takes a critical place in the making of documentary evidence" (pp. 21-22). Second, attributions of statements to particular sages cannot be taken at face value and thus cannot provide evidence of the time and place in which the authority flourished (p. 22). In contrast to constructing a history of ideas based on the assumption of the validity of attributions, Neusner treats "the historical sequence of sayings only in accord with the order of the documents in which they first occur" (p. 23). In his view, only individual documents taken as a whole "reveal the interiority of intellect of an authorship," and it is that "authorship's" mind and conception that are the target of exploration, not particular sages. Neusner lists what he calls "the range of uncertainty" facing one dealing with this literature. First, we do not know if "the canonical history corresponds to the actual history of ideas" (p. 26). Second, even if a rabbi spoke words attributed to him in a document, the idea would have been expressed "prior to the redaction of the document." "Dividing things up by documents will tend to</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 193 give a later date and thus a different context for interpretation to opinions held earlier than we can presently demonstrate" (ibid.). Third, there is no way of knowing "what people thought whose views are not expressed in documents nor how they influenced or responded to the views eventually expressed in the documents" (p. 26). The focus in this book is on the appearance or nonappearance of an idea in context of particular documents, as a way of underscoring "the presence of an idea for that authorship-that alone" (p. 26). Neusner's methodological statements and the model application of the methodology need to be taken into account by anyone engaged in studying the development of ideas in Rabbinic Judaism. One concern I have has to do with his conceptualization of the nature of the texts as "canonical documents." Manuscripts of rabbinic texts come from the Middle Ages and not from the rabbinic period. In a recent article dealing with the creative scribal process in the copying of Hebrew manuscripts, Malachie Beit-Ari6 has described what he terms the "6tat dynamique du texte."' In regard to the above methodology, perhaps the significant list of "uncertainties" has to be expanded to include the possibility that one is dealing with an individual medieval scribal "authorship" of a manuscript. This would then impact on the meaning of "documents" and on the definition of "canonical." A nuanced exploration would have to discuss the "official" standing of individual manuscripts. Most important, it becomes crucial to ask whether, because of the fluidity of textual traditions, there is a similar fluidity in "ideas." To test this possibility, the model of analysis would have to be extended and applied to various manuscripts of the same work. Until that is done, Neusner's work remains a prime example of the "documentary" approach to the development of ideas in Rabbinic Judaism. Lewis M.
