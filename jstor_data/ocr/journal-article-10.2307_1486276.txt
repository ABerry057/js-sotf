<plain_text><page sequence="1">118 BOOK REVIEWS Harold M. Schulweis. Evil and the Morality of God. Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College Press, 1984. vii, 168 pp. On the surface this book appears to be about evil. In fact it is about theology in general. The work is a statement of a single complex argument for what Schulweis calls "predicate theology." The book can be summa- rized as follows: (1) All traditional forms of theology, which Schulweis calls "subject theology," must solve the problem of theodicy if they are to be internally coherent. (2) All of them fail to do so. (3) An alternative to tradi- tional theology is "predicate theology." (4) Unlike other forms of theology it entails no problem of theodicy. Therefore, (5) predicate theology is prefer- able to subject theology. "Subject theology" is any theology in which God is seen to be some kind of subject to whom predicates adhere. In this case the theologian begins with a preconceptual drive that determines his ideal of perfection, which, in turn, determines his idea of God. Schulweis argues that all subject theo- logians are forced, when confronted with radical evil in the ordinary world (e.g., the Holocaust), to make God beyond moral criticism. They do this by affirming a deity who is totally incomprehensible, which is what it means to say that God's predicates cannot be known. If God has no knowable predi- cates, the problem of evil dissolves. God cannot be accused of not being good, because literally it is assumed that He is not good in any sense of the term that is intelligible to human beings. However, these theologians pay a price for their predicate agnosticism; they abandon any significant sense of God as a moral agent, and they sacrifice all intimacy between God and man. Schulweis offers as an alternative what he calls "predicate theology." Whereas subject theology affirms an existing subject in whom no predicates can be known, predicate theology makes the divine predicates themselves the topic of theology. Its goal is to demonstrate the reality of the divine predicates rather than the divine subject; it offers rational arguments for the faith claim that the set of moral ideals posited by Jewish tradition are in themselves worthy of adoration, cultivation, and emulation. There are a number of levels at which critical comments can be raised about Schulweis's argument. First, the examples of theology that Schulweis gives do not fit as neatly into his theological categories as he would like. For example, Maimonides says that we may affirm of God predicates that express human virtues; to say that God is F means that F is something human beings ought to value. Now, given such claims, why is Maimonides any less a predicate theologian than he is a subject theologian?</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 119 Second, it is by no means settled that subject theology is guilty as charged. For example, it is not the case that in classical philosophy divine predicates are entirely meaningless. Schulweis focuses on the most radical example of negative theology, viz., the position of Maimonides. But Rambam's theory of divine attributes is unique in its radicalness. Further- more, Schulweis cannot justify his choice of Maimonides on the grounds that Rambam represents classical Jewish theology at its best. Particularly on the question of divine attributes, to consider Maimonides' position without any consideration of Gersonides' far more thorough theory of divine attri- butes is to ignore the most sophisticated expression of classical Jewish theology. Third, while the breadth of Schulweis's familiarity with philosophical theology is impressive, there are serious omissions from the book. In terms of classical theology, no consideration is given to the very different God concepts of Spinoza and Hegel. Similarly, in terms of contemporary theo- logy, while Hartshorne is discussed, Norman Malcolm is not; while Buber is considered. Rosenzweig is not; and while Hick is given considerable atten- tion, not one reference is made to Fackenheim in a work that claims to be concerned with "Jewish perspectives." Fourth, it is unfortunate that in a book of only 145 pages, Schulweis does not turn to his positive theology until the last 30 pages. His explanation of predicate theology is in no way as clearly spelled out as are his reasons for rejecting subject theology. I for one would have preferred him to reverse his priorities. As it stands, predicate theology raises more questions than it presents solutions. For example, while the term "God" in predicate theo- logy is not a substantive noun, it is "a functional noun which can be under- stood in terms of its relation to others" (p. 126). But nowhere does Schul- weis spell out what is this function. Furthermore, whereas the claimed task of predicate theology is to demonstrate the reality of traditional virtues, not one moral or aesthetic argument is given in the entire work for any Jewish value. However, I do not want to emphasize in this review my criticisms. Schulweis's Evil and the Morality of God is a serious work in theology by a serious contemporary Jewish thinker. Schulweis claims that the source of his predicate theology is Feuerbach. He also cites the influence of such diverse philosophers as Hermann Cohen, Bertrand Russell, Gilbert Ryle, and Ludwig Wittgenstein in defense of his positive theology. In addition, although the name of Mordecai Kaplan is mentioned only once in the entire book, anyone familiar with Kaplan's The Meaning of God in Modern Jewish</page><page sequence="3">120 BOOK REVIEWS Religion and Judaism Without Supernaturalism will recognize this influence as well. Harold Schulweis is a member of the Conservative rabbinate, and his book was published by a Reform movement press. Still, I am inclined to see this book as the best account of Kaplan's views about God that has yet been published. It is a well-written, carefully reasoned statement of Recon- structionist theology by one of the best minds in the American rabbinate. For this reason alone the book is worthy of the attention of all serious students of contemporary Jewish thought. Norbert M. Samuelson Temple University Philadelphia, Pa.</page></plain_text>
