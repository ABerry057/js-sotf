Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1993. 352 pp. At the 1993 meeting of the American Academy of Religions, a roundtable discussion was held on the nascent field of Hindu-Jewish studies. As the heritages of ancient peoples still surviving today, Hinduism and Judaism bear cogent typological comparisons on problems of scripture, ritual, and pollution that can illuminate the dynamics of religious tradition. Perhaps the most abundant historical field for comparing the two religions is to be found in the Indian Jews, who stand at the margins of the Indian and Jewish worlds. Liable to be treated as a cultural curiosity, they have become the subject of a rich religio-historical study by Nathan Katz and Ellen S. Goldberg, the first of whom chaired the AAR roundtable. Though not the only Indian Jewish community, the Jews of Cochin, on southwestern India's Malabar coast, evolved the richest development of Jewish traditions in the subcontinent. Thus they are better known and better studied than the numerically greater Bene Israel of Maharashtra and the Baghdadi Jews, eighteenth-century immigrants who became economically and socially prominent in the cities of British India. Catching the attention either of social scientists working in India or of historians of Eastern Judaism, the Indian Jewish communities have generally been tangential to their authors' main field of expertise. Few treatments of them bring together competencies in both Jewish studies and Indian studies as fruitfully as Katz and Goldberg's book, and none is as thoroughly grounded in the study of religion. The book is divided into two main parts, the first historically oriented, the second ethnographic. Each part manages to offer both ample detail and comparative insights. The history gives a highly readable interpretation of the extant data on the community, drawing on rare sources to account for particular puzzles regarding Jewish immigration to and peregrinations on the Malabar coast. At the same time, it compares the traditional narratives of Malabar Jews, Christians, Muslims, and Hindus to provide a context for Jewish identity in south India. The authors demonstrate how the Cochini minhag has maintained fidelity to Jewish observance while at the same time has developed customs that parallel local Hindu ascetic practice and royal ritual, thus enhancing the status of the community in the gentile world. Describing complete cycles of seasonal and life-cycle rituals, Katz and Goldberg present some compelling contrasts to the more familiar rites of</page><page sequence="2">474 BOOK REVIEWS European Jewry: a Passover that highlights not family rejoicing but ascetic practice; educational rites that focus not on the adolescent's bar mitzvah, but on the six-year-old's first public reading from the Haftarah. In giving attention to the adaptive strategies of the Cochin Jews, thereby making the very marginality of India's Jews intellectually meaningful, Katz and Goldberg succeed in an important area where many less interpretive stud- ies fail. They explain the dynamics of the long survival and indeed flowering of a Jewish community on the Malabar coast, and-wistfully-account for the nearly complete emigration of its younger generations today.
