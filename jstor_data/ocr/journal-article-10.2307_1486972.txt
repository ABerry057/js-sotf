<plain_text><page sequence="1">Egal Feldman. Dual Destinies: The Jewish Encounter with Protestant America. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1990. xi, 339. Egal Feldman teaches at the University of Wisconsin-Superior, where he specializes in Jewish and interreligious American history. Drawing on extensive study of the many-sided Protestant and Jewish pasts in America, in this work he focuses on the meeting points of the two incompatible and changing traditions, "one dominant, the other subjugated" (p. ix), from colonial days to the present. The narrative provides a useful survey of the relationships (often controversial) between a broad religious movement that has understood itself as representing the majority of Americans and a tiny minority that was destined to increase remarkably in size and complexity, especially after 1880. The author supplies many references to important pri- mary and secondary sources, and hopes that his work "will motivate addi- tional efforts in this neglected but important area" (p. x). Though some chapters of the story may be more familiar to readers of this journal than others, his summary interpretation of the whole story can cast new light even on the parts about which one may know something, and stimulate further discussion and response. The book unfolds largely chronologically from the brief opening chapter, "From the Old World to the New." For some who may wish to use Feldman's work as a classroom textbook, there may be a need to supple- ment it with works cited in the endnotes and selected bibliography, in order to dramatize the continuing impact of early and medieval centuries on both traditions, with tragic consequences for Jews especially, and in order to highlight the way the concept of Christendom exerted its spell on American Christians long after the passage of the First Amendment. The importance of the Holy Land in religious thought and life is not neglected; chapter 8 ("Zionward") shows how Protestant biblical scholars, explorers, missionar-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 351 ies, colonists, writers, and travelers were drawn to it as the nineteenth cen- tury wore on; chapter 13 ("Liberalism and the Genesis of Political Zionism") concisely refers to the growth of the controversial Zionist move- ment among American Jews in the twentieth century, with brief attention to such persons as Gustav and Richard Gottheil, Stephen S. Wise, and Louis D. Brandeis, also mentioning some of the Protestant supporters of a Jewish national homeland, such as Adolf A. Berle, John Haynes Holmes, and Wil- liam E. Blackstone. The important pioneering work of Presbyterian George Foot Moore in the 1920s to correct misunderstandings of Jewish history in Christian and academic circles unfortunately did not catch wide attention; in certain ways he was an American parallel to England's James Parkes. The painful story of the resurgence of antisemitism and anti-Judaism among Protestants (and others) and its role in numbing reactions to the Holocaust is briefly recapitulated. Considerable attention is given to steps "Toward a New Relationship" (chapter 16), with attention to the contributions of those who have insisted that Jews need to be understood in terms of their own his- tory and piety; for example, Abraham J. Heschel, Richard L. Rubenstein, and Irving Greenberg among Jews; Reinhold Niebuhr, A. Roy Eckardt, Franklin H. Littell, and Paul M. Van Buren among Protestants. The first three on the latter list appear again, in a location puzzling to this reviewer: in chapter 17, "Jewish Sovereignty and the Protestant Right," in which the premillennial Dispensationists, including Jerry Falwell, are discussed. That Feldman can discuss helpfully the relations between two such dyna- mic, growing, and complex religious movements is a tribute to his industry and perception. He generally avoids the problem of slipping into too many oversimple dichotomies (e.g., liberal/conservative, fundamentalist/ mod- ernist) in his work, though anachronistically he does so in his chapter 12, "Defending the Evangelical Tradition, 1880-1915." In that period the "evangelical" churches encompassed most of the Protestant spectrum, including the members of the Federal Council of Churches; the distinctively "liberal" churches were then the Unitarian and the Universalist. To be sure, there were many types of evangelicals, including liberal, moderate, conser- vative, orthodox, and fundamentalist parties within many evangelical denominations. The linking of the term "evangelical" to conservative, fun- damentalist, and neofundamentalist Protestantism surfaced after World War II. The sharp-eyed reader may catch a few minor slips; for example, Elias Hicks was not a contemporary of William Penn; Roger Williams did not accept the invitation to minister to Boston's First Church; and the</page><page sequence="3">352 BOOK REVIEWS names of George Whitefield, A. T. Pierson (not Peterson), and Howard Grose are wrongly spelled. But these are small matters in view of the breadth of the author's research and his organization of a vast amount of detail into a readable and informative narrative. The documentation is thorough; there are 980 endnotes (properly compact and referential) for 246 pages of text, averaging four per page. In my judgment, a scholarly book of this kind, published by a university press, should have such notes at the foot of the page; it was frustrating to be constantly flipping back and forth, though the nuggets thus obtained made it worth it. But these quibbles are minor in the face of the value of this impressive scholarly venture, which does invite care- ful reading and discussion. Robert T.
