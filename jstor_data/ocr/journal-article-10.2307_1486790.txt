New Haven: Yale University Press, 1997. xxii, 268 pp.</page><page sequence="2">444 BOOK REVIEWS The story of Meyer Levin's lengthy, tortuous relationship to Anne Frank's Diary of a Young Girl is not a new one, but Ralph Melnick has pursued it more thoroughly than anyone else to date and has produced a book that recasts the players in this complicated tale in some new and revealing ways. In doing so, Melnick poses a serious challenge to other interpretations of this same story, most notably Lawrence Graver's An Obsession with Anne Frank: Meyer Levin and the Diary (1995). Briefly stated, the story that has given rise to both books is as follows. Meyer Levin, a well known and relatively popular American writer of the mid-century, was among the first in this country to read the famous Diary and worked tirelessly to promote it. Among other things, he contacted Otto Frank, the father of Anne Frank and the only surviving member of the Frank family, and secured from him permission to try his hand at turning the book into a stage play. For a number of reasons, Levin's dramatization of Anne Frank's book was passed over for a more popular version by the Hollywood screenwriting team of Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett. This unexpected rejection of his work cut to the core of Levin's sense of himself as a writer and as a Jew and, over the last thirty years of his life, it propelled him to wage a determined campaign for personal vindication and artistic justice. He was convinced that he was the victim of a conspiratorial effort carried on by dogmatic Stalinists and ideological antisemites, whose goals were to strip the Nazi Holocaust of its Jewish character as well as to strip him of his rights as a serious writer. He fought furiously against his enemies, most of whom were themselves Jews, but in his lifetime Levin received little satisfaction for his efforts. Apart from some minor stagings, his play remained suppressed; and its suppression, he was convinced, permitted a sentimentalized -and largely de-Judaized version of Anne Frank to replace the "real" Anne Frank, an invidious development that resulted in a serious distortion of the history of Jewish suffering under the Nazis. In Lawrence Graver's account of this story, there is little reason to believe that Meyer Levin was victimized by any such "conspiracy" as the one he imagined. In many ways, Graver is sympathetic to the author's plight, but in the main he understands Levin's troubles as stemming from his own self-defeating fixation on being a victim as well as from a series of highly tangled personal, legal, commercial, and professional circumstances. Thus, Graver concludes that Levin's assessment of his travail is "mistaken in many of its details and unconvincing in its overall emphasis and final judgment" (p. 207).</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 445 In sharp contrast to Graver's conclusions, those reached in The Stolen Legacy of Anne Frank clearly indicate that Levin has found a latter-day champion in Ralph Melnick. Drawing on archival materials that Graver evidently did not discover, Melnick is able to fill in this story in some new ways and to make more credible, if not wholly convincing, the notion that a degree of ideological censorship may indeed have been a contributing factor in the denial of Levin's work. There is no doubt that, in crucial respects, Levin was his own worst enemy, but The Stolen Legacy ofAnne Frank reveals others who certainly did not wish him well and worked in one fashion or another, and for one motive or another, to help kill his play. These included the writer Lillian Hellman, a well known and highly influential figure in New York theater circles, whom Melnick portrays, more convincingly than not, as a "self-hating Jew and a Stalinist" (p. 34) and a person who was not above acting in underhanded ways. For reasons both personal and political, even if not perhaps as conspira- torial as Melnick makes them out to be, Hellman played a decisive role in sidelining Levin, in bringing in Goodrich and Hackett to replace him and, on various occasions, in influencing the latter in the way they adapted the Diary for the popular theater. Hellman also played a critical role with Kermit Bloomgarden, the play's producer and her onetime lover, who shared many of her political and ideological tendencies, as she did with various others involved in the composition, direction, production, and promotion of the play. Melnick overreaches himself when he argues for a close connection between Hellman's manipulations and the Stalinist executions of Jewish writers in the Soviet Union that were taking place at the same time. But he otherwise succeeds in bringing Hellman prominently to the fore as a determined opponent of both Meyer Levin and a dramatized version of Anne Frank's Diary that would retain more of its recognizably Jewish features. Another key actor whom Melnick recasts in this story is Otto Frank. In Graver's book, Frank emerges as a more innocent figure than he is made out to be in The Stolen Legacy of Anne Frank, where it becomes clear that Frank, "a curious mixture of great emotion and business" (p. 135), dealt with Meyer Levin in ways that were not always fully honest. A highly cultured, more or less assimilated German Jew, Otto Frank was touchy on the "Jewish element" in the play and was basically at odds with Levin over this matter, stating at one point that "the play would be much more readily accepted on its merits if it were written by a non-Jew" (p. xiii). That idea both insulted and infuriated Levin and, in private correspondence as well as in public legal</page><page sequence="4">446 BOOK REVIEWS suits, brought him to hurl charges against Otto Frank that accused the latter of treating him in the same brutal ways as the Nazis treated Frank's dead daughter. Frank was understandably upset by Levin's outrageous verbal and legal assaults upon him, but Melnick makes clear that, for all of its rhetorical wildness, Levin's charge that Otto Frank acted in some ways out of less than honorable motives was not groundless. To be sure, Frank was not consciously in league with Hellman and Bloomgarden in conspiring to block Levin's play. Rather, he was driven by a mission to "propagate Anne's ideas and ideals in every manner" (p. 96) to the widest possible audience. He and not Levin would interpret the "spirit" of the diary and give meaning to its "message," which he did not take to be an especially Jewish one. And if Levin proved to be a hindrance to him in carrying out this sacred "duty," then he could be dispensed with. In the end, though, Frank was himself outmaneuvered as the sole owner or authoritative interpreter of his daughter's "message" by those who popularized her image for the Broadway stage. And ultimately, as Melnick describes him, he became a compromised figure. That, more or less, is the image of Otto Frank and his relationship to Meyer Levin that Melnick gives us. On the evidence drawn from a large volume of published and unpublished sources, it is basically a credible one. Melnick's book does not invalidate Graver's, but it does add dimensions to this complex story that are well worth having. In ways that go beyond the argument presented in An Obsession with Anne Frank, Melnick's study helps us better understand how Anne Frank's "legacy," itself a significant part of the popular image of the Holocaust, has been shaped by people whose motives were sometimes questionable and whose ideas were not always for the best.
