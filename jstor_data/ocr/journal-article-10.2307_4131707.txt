Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1998. 242 pp. In this book, which is a slightly revised version of his dissertation, Aryeh Co- hen tackles the challenge of reading the Babylonian Talmud as "literature." This is a complex task, because the basis for a literary reading is not readily apparent. Large portions of the Bavli consist of logically dense legal argumentation. Cohen is to be commended for making these dense passages that comprise the over- whelmingly larger part of the Bavli the central topic of his analysis, for they give the Bavli its most distinctive literary qualities. Other approaches focus on subunits of rabbinic literature that are overtly literary, like parables or sage stories (ma 'asim). While these approaches stress the literary qualities of rabbinic literature, as Cohen notes, they treat the subunits in isolation and consequently ignore the meaning con- ferred upon them by their broader contexts. Cohen takes the sugya to be the relevant unit of literary analysis in the Bavli. Within the sugya, his reading is generated by several kinds of literary phenomena. First, he notices places where the sugya "doesn't make sense"-either a conclu- sion does not flow smoothly from an argument or a term may appear opaque. These problematic textual moments, or "ungrammaticalities" as Cohen calls them, often generate post-talmudic discussions, and so contention among the post-talmudic in- terpreters is usually a good indicator of such points. Second, Cohen observes re- peated syntactical patterns, tropes, images, and themes within the sugya. Finally, Cohen highlights "concepts introduced under erasure." This term is borrowed from Derrida and applied to passages where the Bavli dismisses a legal principle as ir- revelant. Cohen astutely notes that, by virtue of having been introduced at all, the concept can be literarily significant even when it is legally insignificant. These lit- erary features-ungrammaticalities, repeated tropes, and concepts introduced un- der erasure-expose a progression in the sugya in addition to the linear flow of question, answer, proof-text, rebuttal, and so on, compelled by the sugya's explic- it rhetoric. Cohen provides real service to the field by isolating features within the texture of the text from which a literary reading of the Bavli can ensue. He skill- fully balances the sensibilities of a text critic with those of a literary reader. While he takes the final redacted text as the primary subject of his reading, he also pays attention to the seams that indicate the presence of earlier sources. For Cohen, how- ever, these seams provide stimulus for a literary rather than a text-critical reading. One of Cohen's finest achievements consists in the fact that he points to a literary character of the Bavli that is independent of halakhic or aggadic genre. Indeed he treats halakhic, aggadic, and mixed sugyot. The second major move in this book is to consider the relationship between the world of the text and historical "reality." According to Cohen, the narrative that can be reconstructed from the above-noted literary features provides the link. Co- hen asserts that the textual narrative draws its meaning from the larger cultural nar- ratives of the rabbis. In an exemplary reading of several sugyot from b. Gittin, Co- hen suggests that cultural anxiety about the exilic condition expresses itself in the perception of institutional vulnerability on the part of the rabbis. According to Co- hen, the cultural narrative of exilic chaos is in dialogue with the textual narrative 360</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews of the exemplary sugyot, which try to assert stability through the construction of gender roles and by naturalizing the institution of slavery. This approach of con- necting literary phenomena with historical reality is innovative in talmudic re- search and thought-provoking, but is not as fully developed in its execution as one might wish. Cohen draws most of his evidence of the larger cultural narratives from biblical sources and Ben Sira. This reader would have preferred a more thorough argument to establish his claim that exilic consciousness was a dominant cultural narrative of sixth- and seventh-century Babylonian Jewry. When Cohen places his astute literary observations in the service of an extra- literary project, certain questions about the goals of a literary reading of the Bavli are raised. Are literary observations best exploited when they form the foundation of cultural critique, as in Cohen's work, or when they illuminate discourse within the textual universe of the Bavli? In this regard, Cohen's book provides an inter- esting counterpoint to David Kraemer's Reading the Talmud: The Talmud as Lit- erature, which pursues the same goal of a literary reading of talmudic sugyot; Kraemer's focus remains, however, the textual universe of the Bavli. By implicit- ly engaging these important questions, Cohen's work furthers the scholarly project of reading the Bavli as literature. The book still bears many of the marks of a dissertation. While the ideas are very interesting and original, the arguments are not always expressed as clearly or developed as fully as one might wish. A substantial portion of the book consists of a review of the secondary literature, which, while relevant, might have been con- densed for the transition to book format in order to highlight the author's original thesis. These criticisms notwithstanding, this book makes important contributions to the field. The methodologies that it employs and the ideas that it pursues have potentially far-reaching implications. By marking out important tasks and pro- ceeding with a high level of methodological sophistication, this book welcomes a serious new voice into the arena of literary studies of rabbinic literature.
