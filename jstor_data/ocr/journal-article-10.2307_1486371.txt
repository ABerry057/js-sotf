<plain_text><page sequence="1">ALIENATED INTELLECTUALS IN THE CAMP OF RELIGIOUS REFORM: THE FRANKFURT REFORMFREUNDE, 1842-1845 by MICHAEL A. MEYER A minor historical movement which never assumes mass proportions, which arises and passes from public view in a brief period of time, and which leaves behind no residue of specific lasting effect would seem to possess only the most limited scholarly interest. Its intensive study can be justified only if such research points beyond its immediate subject to broader objective trends and subjective attitudes which it crystallizes or foreshadows. Yet even a small and transient grouping of similarly minded individuals may bring to focus external influences and motivational patterns which are considerably more widespread and which exist over a far longer period of time. This study will focus on a tiny, evanescent phenomenon: the first religiously radical grouping to arise within German Judaism. While not disregarding the spe- cifics of its history, it will seek to indicate how its subject reflects currents and tendencies of considerably broader measure and of longer duration.' 1. The most extensive discussion of the Reformfreunde is in David Philipson, The Reform Movement in Judaism (New York, 1907; 2d ed., 1931), pp. 107-39. The relation of the group to Jewish and secular politics in Frankfurt is elaborated in the first chapter of a Jewish Theologi- cal Seminary doctoral dissertation on Frankfurt Orthodoxy by Robert Liberles, who was kind enough to let me see an early version of this chapter. For the possible relationship with free- masonry see Jacob Katz, Jews and Freemasons in Europe, 1723-1939 (Cambridge, Mass., 1970), pp. 92-94. 61</page><page sequence="2">62 MICHAEL A. MEYER In September, 1842, a group of Jewish men, most of them living in Frankfurt am Main, came together for the first of a series of meetings to dis- cuss their position as Jews. The impetus seems to have come from Theodor Creizenach, a twenty-four year old poet, scholar, and teacher at the Jewish Philanthropin school.2 The other participants included physicians, lawyers, intellectuals, and businessmen. All belonged to the secularly cultured seg- ment of Frankfurt Jewry.9 Although initially no publicity was desired, news of the gatherings soon reached both the general and Jewish press, where it created a considerable stir. It became known that these men had formulated a statement of principles and were seeking signatures in Frankfurt and else- where. The statement which they circulated was exceedingly terse, consisting of only three brief sentences. It had been adopted by a majority vote over an earlier version which contained five points. The earlier version, which came to light only much later, declared that its supporters: 1. considered the Mosaic religion capable of a continuing development; 2. considered the ritual, dietary, and other laws pertaining to corporal prac- tices (Uebungen) which originated in the ancient polity, for example, 3. circumcision, not binding as a religious act or a symbol; 4. did not recognize the Talmud as an authority; 5. neither awaited nor wished for a messiah who would lead the Jews back to Palestine, but rather regarded the land to which they belonged by birth or civil status as their sole fatherland.4 This version had been rejected principally on tactical grounds. The direct attack upon biblical commandments, it was feared, would likely be frowned upon by the governmental authorities, who might regard it as impinging upon the revealed basis of Christianity no less than that of Judaism. More- over, though most of the participants in the meetings seem to have favored abolition of circumcision as a requirement for male membership in the Jewish community, they hoped to attract wider support by elimination of the passage opposing it. The version which was adopted simply stated: 2. Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums (AZJ), May 6, 1843. 3. I. M. Jost, Geschichte der Israeliten, 10 vols. (Berlin, 1820-47), vol. 10, pt. 3, p. 212. 4.

We recognize in Mosaism the possibility of an unlimited further develop- ment. 2. The collection called the Talmud, as well as all the rabbinic writings and statutes which rest upon it, possess no binding force for us either in dogma or in practice. 3. We neither expect nor desire a messiah who is to lead the Israelites back to the land of Palestine; we recognize no fatherland other than that to which we belong by birth or civil status. When this second version, along with several letters, was circulated from house to house in Frankfurt, it fell into the hands of a nonsympathizer who copied the declaration as well as such excerpts from the correspondence as would make the group appear in the most radical light. He then made a lithographed version and sent it to the Jewish press. Ludwig Philippson, the moderate reform rabbi who edited the Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums, had few compunctions about printing the surreptitiously secured and damagingly excerpted texts. Earlier he had already condemned the group on the basis of rumors. Now he followed up publication of the documents with his own withering response. Not surprisingly, the even more conservative Julius Fiirst likewise printed the pirated material in his periodical, Der Orient.5 This premature and incomplete publication embarrassed and angered the Frankfurt circle. In a notice in the Frankfurter Journal, the group offered a reward of fifty florins to anyone who would unmask the cul- prit. To no avail. Signing the declaration now meant taking a stance in a bit- ter controversy. The drive for signatures at this time apparently did not get beyond two dozen.6 Finally, in September of 1843, an official Program for a Declaration of German Israelites, Submitted for their Consideration to Friends of Religious Reform in Judaism made its appearance. The program, written by Creize- nach, was also submitted to the press along with the declaration of prin- ciples and a letter of invitation to membership.' The letter presents the name 5.

In its officially publicized form it substituted "Mosaic religion" for "Mosaism" and limited the second statement to the Talmud alone.

MEYER of the group officially for the first time: it is "The Jewish Friends of Reform" (Die jidischen Reformfreunde). Apparently there were no elected officers. The letters appearing in different Jewish newspapers did not all even bear the signature of the same individual as representative of the group. However, this coming out into the open did have at least some positive effect. Membership increased about this time to forty-five, at which it remained stable.8 The group also gained one friend among the reform rab- bis, Mendel Hess, the extremist chief rabbi of the grand duchy of Saxe- Weimar and editor of Der Israelit des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts.9 In succeed- ing months Hess, alone among his colleagues, championed the cause of the Frankfurt society on the pages of his journal, while one after another, pub- licly or privately, leading figures of the modern German rabbinate, from the conservative Zacharias Frankel to the radical David Einhorn, proceeded to condemn it.lo Undaunted, the Reformfreunde sent out a new circular in December, defending themselves against their detractors." They claimed that many more Jews shared their sentiments than had signed the declaration. The reason for their refusal to associate themselves publicly was very simple: they would gain no personal advantage, only opprobrium on the part of fel- low Jews. Better therefore to remain unofficial sympathizers. Indeed, it seems most likely that even those who signed the declaration preferred not to make an issue of it. No list of members was ever published, and we know the names of only seven individuals who were members of the group.'2 With 8. Der Orient, December 12, 1843. 9.

A final circular was issued in June 1845 and printed only in Hess's paper.14 Wholly anonymous this time, it speaks of persistence in the original principles, success in widening the local circle, and participa- tion in their conversations by "famous literary figures and men learned in Judaism" from outside the city." That summer the second rabbinical con- ference met in Frankfurt, bringing to the community a direct awareness that the theologians had been aroused to activity. In the fall, the Reformfreunde appointed a committee of five to introduce Sunday services,'6 but nothing came of the plan. Their minimal energies and uncertain commitments did not suffice for so practical a project." II The three-year history of the Reformfreunde would justify little more than cursory attention, were it not for what the literature which it generated cian; Dr. Schwarzschild, a practicing physician and obstetrician; Dr. Goldschmidt, an attor- ney; Simon Maas, Dr. jur.; Joseph Riitten, a businessman; and Dr. Neukirch. In addition, the group allegedly had a letter of support from "Herrn Meyer und Comp. in Stettin." But this was later denied. The references are in Der Orient, May 9, 1843, September 26, 1843, December 12, 1843; AZJ, September 11, 1843, October 2, 1843; ZJiD 1 (1843): 259, 2 (1844): 122. It seems likely that the attorney Dr. Goldschmidt was Salomon H. Goldschmidt and that Dr. Neukirch was the attorney Wolfgang Neukirch. The former completed his studies at Heidelberg in 1833, the latter in 1834. Each was the son of a wealthy and prominent Frankfurt family. Neukirch was later elected to the Frankfurt Legislative and Constituent Assembly in 1848/49. See Monika Richarz, Der Eintritt der Juden in die akademischen Berufe (Tiibingen, 1974), pp. 186-87.

MEYER reveals about ongoing psychological and intellectual shifts, in part the result of long-term processes, in part a response to events immediately preceding the formation of the association. The rapid advance of Jewish social and cultural integration in early nine- teenth-century Germany was only sporadically accompanied by efforts at theoretical and practical religious reform. The gap between a broadened professional spectrum and a heightened sense of European cultural identity on the one hand and a basically unchanged Judaism on the other was per- ceived as onerous, especially by those who were personally the most alien- ated from traditional Judaism but still desired to remain within the Jewish community. Their greater penetration into gentile circles made them espe- cially self-conscious regarding the non-Jewish perception of Judaism, and hence also of themselves as associated with it. These feelings were not limit- ed to embarrassment about the lack of decorum in Jewish worship services. They extended to the fundamentals of the faith and especially to the Talmud as the underlying authority for traditional Judaism. The historian Isaac Marcus Jost, who took part in some of the meetings of the Reformfreunde though he did not sign their declaration, traced the intellectual origins of the association to an anonymous letter entitled "Reflections of a Layman," which appeared in Abraham's Geiger's Wis- senschaftliche Zeitschrift far jiidische Theologie as early as 1837.18 The author of this piece did indeed reflect the sentiment which would come to the fore five years later. Noting an abyss between the external and internal worlds of the German Jew, he rejected the possibility of a gradual reform which would bring about reconciliation. His purpose was not reinterpreta- tion or liturgical change. Given the pressures to which he and others like him felt exposed, the proper course was a "solemn declaration" to the effect that those who support it do not feel themselves conscience-bound to attribute final authority to the ordinances of the Talmud and even less so to those of the later rabbis. Rabbinic Judaism possesses only derived authority, insofar as it can be shown by historical inquiry to convey accurately what was transmitted by Moses. Otherwise it falls into the category of purely order for it to perish-in a year people will not be talking about it any more." See Nahum N. Glatzer, ed., Leopold Zunz: Jude-Deutscher-Europaer (Tfibingen, 1964), p. 224. 18. "Bedenken eines Laien," pp. 161-71. It is not entirely clear whether the author was later a member of the Reformfreunde. Jost (Geschichte der Israeliten, p. 212, n. 3) calls him, per- haps generically, "ein denkender Reformfreund."</page><page sequence="7">THE FRANKFURT REFORMFREUNDE 67 temporal institutions which must be evaluated by an external standard, be it reason, "the spirit of Judaism," or appropriateness for the present age. The author did speak about eventual reconciliation, but the pressing need of the moment, he believed, was for an honest public statement by all those who thought as he did. When the laymen came together in Frankfurt five years later, they sought to draft such a clarifying statement. Their principal purpose was clearly public dissociation: they do not accept the authority of the Talmud, they do not desire a messiah who will lead them back to Palestine. The recurring term which seems best to convey their basic motive is repudiation (Lossagung).19 Without question these men desired to make a statement to the non-Jew: do not, on account of our being Jews, take us for what we are not; do not make us suffer for beliefs we do not share. By gathering signa- tures, they also wanted to create an awareness of their strength within the Jewish community, perhaps making communal reforms more likely. But any analysis of their motivations would remain incomplete if it did not con- sider as well that these Reformfreunde felt that they were living a lie.20 Their declaration becomes wholly comprehensible when it is seen as a kind of catharsis of long pent-up and conflicted emotions. Talmud and messiah had become symbols for all that they regarded as negative in Judaism, all that burdened them, not only socially and politically, but psychologically. From their point of view the declaration was an act of self-liberation, not from any actual authority to which they still paid heed in practice, but from a shadow of authority which weighed upon them even as their day-to-day lives no longer reflected its influence. Individually they would have to be considered heretics, together they could be supportive of each other's feel- ings and constitute a counterauthority, however limited, to the authority of rabbinic Judaism. Repeatedly they speak of "clearing away the rubble."2' It is as if they feel they are dwelling in a ruined building: not a few stones have already rained down on them, others continue to tumble. There is no repair- ing the building. All that remains usable is the foundation, but it cannot be built upon anew until the old stones are completely removed. It is of interest that the Reformfreunde did not want to create a schism in the community, let alone to form a new sect. The reason is not simply 19. E.g., Der Orient, September 26, 1843, p. 309. 20.

MEYER because the government might frown on such a step. Rather, they were seek- ing to resolve a severe Jewish ambivalence by separating the positive (Mosaic) from the negative (talmudic) and thereby to make their continued identification with fellow Jews and with Judaism less problematic. The intel- lectual framework of the discourse, at a time when men-in intended con- trast to women-prided themselves on their rationality, must not be allowed to obscure a powerful emotional component which is not always readily apparent. It must generally be read between the lines, derived from occa- sional lapses in official statements, and gleaned from private correspon- dence. The degree of emotional vehemence may be illustrated by the repeated use of certain telling metaphors. The circular of December 1844, referring to the earlier declaration and the opposition it produced, says in justification: "We dared to step on the serpent's head and had to expect that it would squirt poison." On another occasion we find reference to the "unfree, immoral, murderous (meuchelminrderisch) Judaism of rigid rabbinism."22 And a correspondent for Der Orient claimed that a Reformfreunde corre- spondent had written in a general newspaper hostile to the Jews that Jewish literature was full of dirt (Schmutz) with regard to Christianity.23 Reflection upon such language must raise the question whether the concept of Jewish self-hate is not applicable to at least some of the Reformfreunde. Unable to avenge the slights they suffered at the hands of non-Jews, they turned their anger inward against their own Jewishness and against its official expression in the Jewish community. The strong feelings of revulsion directed toward a Judaism more mythical than real surely provided a part of the necessary impetus for what was, to be sure, a considerably more complex pheno- menon. III By examining the relationship of three individuals to the Reformfreunde we can extend our understanding of what the group represented to differing types of Jewish personalities which had emerged in the preceding decades. 22.

His father, Michael Creizenach,25 had already studied at a uni- versity and been early attracted to religious reform. In 1825 he came to Frankfurt to teach at the Philanthropin school, which served not only as a model institution for modern Jewish and secular education, but also pro- vided a partly vernacular service and a sermon every Saturday morning. Its Andachtsstunde was attended not only by the students but also by those adults-mostly women-who were dissatisfied with the unchanged ortho- doxy of the community synagogue and who were not engaged in business on the Sabbath. Over a period of eight years, from 1833 to 1840, the elder Creizenach published a four-volume work entitled Schulchan Aruch, or an Encyclopedic Description of the Mosaic Law. Not hostile to talmudic inter- pretations, which he regarded as sometimes operating in the manner of reforms, he nonetheless reverted increasingly to the Mosaic teachings of the Bible as the basis of modern Judaism. His son was himself a product of the Philanthropin. At age seventeen Theodor began his university studies and by 1839 he had gained a doctorate. That same year he published his first volume of poetry. As a Jew, he now found himself blocked in any academic ambitions that he might harbor. He returned to Frankfurt where in 1842 he became a teacher at his alma mater; when his father died that same year, he took over some of his father's classes as well. Creizenach's inner feelings about Judaism at this point in his life can best be gauged by a collection of five poems which was appended to a manual for confirmands published by his father in 1841.26 At the end of the preface Michael Creizenach wrote: "The poems added by my son breathe complete esteem for Israel and its teaching." He felt, therefore, that he could expect them to be well received. Today forgotten, the poems seem scarcely suited to instill such pure esteem. They convey rather the pain of one for whom Jewishness is a memory but not a vision, a loyalty to the past but not the expression of individual personality. In the first poem, entitled "The Ger- 24.

MEYER man Jew," Creizenach imagines himself standing on a German mountain peak breathing the faint odor of the Cedars of Lebanon, dreaming of the Jordan River and of the Temple on Mount Zion. But the Temple fell, the Jew became a stranger along the Rhine, until at last the new light of the modern age began to dawn. The poem concludes: Mightily life's spirit rises From amidst the old decaying stones! So let us not then perish, Though the old glory sink away; For out of rubble, out of ruin There grows a new day's Tree of Life. Creizenach's Tree of Life may have some of its roots in Judaism, but it is a new creation-as he suggests in another poem, a hybrid of Oriental cedar and German oak. The most poignant of these poems is entitled "Two Generations." A grandfather and grandson walk together hand-in-hand. For the old man "a house remains standing on a firm foundation where others have pnly seen debris." But the grandson fails to discern beauty even in the new ivy that climbs up along its walls. The grandfather can do no better than appeal to loyalty: "If the teaching can give you nothing, 0/ see what it gave to your ancestors." He recalls memories: how his wife told her grandson stories of God and the Promised Land, how she washed his bloody head when the Christian boys assaulted him. The tradition is likened to the grandmother: nurturing, consoling. At length the grandson swears his filial loyalty while the grandfather, unable to face the heat of the new day's sun, hurries to his cooler abode. The poem ends on an ironic note: Let me go now to my books; Into the narrow chamber (Klause) follow me. Surely we shall understand each other! The first gathering of the Reformfreunde came only a month after the elder Creizenach's death. For his son, the new group which he initiated was but the first step away from the mediating position which his father had attempted to maintain. Theodor's attachment to Lebanon's cedars was too weak to endure. He soon went to Paris and there became a friend of Hein- rich Heine, whom he must have admired greatly. By 1854 Creizenach's</page><page sequence="11">THE FRANKFURT REFORMFREUNDE 71 loyalties to Judaism could no longer compete with his desire, similar to Heine's a generation earlier, to enter fully into European culture. He con- verted to Evangelical Christianity and eventually became a professor at the Frankfurt gymnasium, publishing studies in history and literature. He became known as a leading authority on Goethe. For Creizenach the Reformfreunde, like the Verein fuir Cultur und Wissenschaft der Juden for Heine twenty years earlier, was only a station along the way. While Creizenach was the initiator of the Reformfreunde, its most respected member was Moriz Abraham Stern (1807-1894).27 A native of Frankfurt, Stern became a good friend of the slightly younger Abraham Geiger and was, like him, destined for a career in the rabbinate.28 But unlike Geiger, who regarded Stern as a model and an important intellectual stimulus, Stern chose not to become a practical theologian. His interests moved from philology to mathematics, philosophy, and the natural sciences. In 1829, after receiving his doctorate at the University of Gottin- gen, he obtained a position there as a Privatdozent. In succeeding years he published significant books and articles in his chosen field of mathematics. Yet by the time he joined the Reformfreunde, he had been unable to advance on the academic ladder. Lacking independent wealth, he was forced to eke out a meager existence by tutoring, journalistic work, and translations. Only in 1848 did he finally achieve the rank of ausserordentlicher Professor, and finally in 1859-after thirty years on the G6ttingen faculty-became the first Jew in Germany to be named a full professor. By 1842 Stern had been a Privatdozent for thirteen years. One of his friends and later a leading member of the Reformfreunde, the attorney S. H. Goldschmidt, had considered his academic ambitions to be sheer mad- ness. But Stern believed that as a Jew teaching in a university and publishing scientific works he was "contributing something to the honor of our people," and this was one of the goals he had set for himself in life. Frus- trated in G6ttingen, he sought to obtain professorships in France, Switzer- land, and in other German states-but all to no avail. At best he could take 27.

MEYER comfort in the fact that he was not alone. Other Jews with similar qualifica- tions faced the same barriers. Among them were Stern's friends, Gabriel Gustav Valentin, a physiologist who obtained a professorship in Bern; Hein- rich Weil, son of the Frankfurt Philanthropin Jewish educator; Jacob Weil, who was able to succeed academically as a philologist in France; and Lud- wig Wihl, a philologist and writer, who finally became a teacher in Grenoble.29 Although Stern received a number of prestigious prizes for his work, the Hannover regime would recognize his achievements only by granting him a fixed yearly emolument. An article published about the University of Gottingen in 1842 put it bluntly: "Stern would long have been a professor were he not a Jew and as such excluded from a professorship in Hannover as in all of Germany."30 But Stern nonetheless chose to remain a Jew- this despite the fact that he was even further removed from Judaism, at least intellectually, than most of the Frankfurt Reformfreunde. Stern had received an excellent Hebrew education, he knew Talmud well, and he maintained a life-long interest in Semitic languages. But the univer- sity atmosphere had drawn him increasingly away from the beliefs and prac- tices with which he had grown up. He was deeply influenced by his study of Spinoza, who became Stern's "guiding star." The Dutch philosopher had laid the groundwork for a new, more critical spirit in regard to sacred texts and for a philosophy devoid of the old theological myths. Christian circles had been deeply affected by the bracing, healthy air of his thought, but Judaism had yet to be permeated. Although Stern lived in Gottingen, he maintained long-standing friend- ships in Frankfurt and visited there frequently. Michael Creizenach had been his teacher; Theodor had sought him out while a student in Gottingen. As he was visiting his mother in Frankfurt in September of 1842, he partici- pated in the first gatherings of the Reformfreunde. Like the others, Stern was bound to Judaism by a sense of loyalty. He expressed it this way: "What binds me to Judaism, what makes its adherents closer to me than other people, is the pure obligatory sense of filial piety (Pflichtgefiihl der Pietdt)."3 29.

In IdnJ, February 11, 1844, an anonymous writer from Frankfurt, no doubt a member of the Reformfreunde, gave this explanation for their remaining Jewish: "It is the feeling of filial love, of affection for those with whom one has grown up. In a man of character and self- awareness, it is also the disinclination to adopt a religion whose adherents, in their civil and</page><page sequence="13">THE FRANKFURT REFORMFREUNDE 73 What made Stern stand out from the others-and resulted in consider- able embarrassment for the group-was his articulation of a radical theol- ogy. The first principle of the Reformfreunde declaration in its original form spoke of the Mosaic religion being capable of "continuing development" (fortdauernde Entwicklung). By the final version it had undergone a signifi- cant shift. The new language spoke of the Mosaic religion's capacity for "unlimited further development" (unbeschrdnkten Fortbildung). While the earlier formulation implied some degree of continuity with the past and a development upon firm Mosaic foundations, the later version seemed to allow for an ultimate position which was no longer recognizably the Mosaic religion at all. The former assumed that the Mosaic religion contained its own internal principle of development, the latter that its further develop- ment was to be undertaken according to principles originating outside of it. As the other two points of the declaration were both negations, there seemed to be nothing left of the Jewish religion as a coherent entity. In theological terms, the revelatory basis of Judaism seemed to have been removed. Speak- ing for himself, Stern had stated frankly, in one of the excerpted letters, that "the goal of reform is clear to me, it is the destruction of the positive belief in revelation." Once the authority of the Talmud had been removed, the Bible stood exposed to critical exegesis. The first principle was intended to leave room for acceptance of the "highest results of philosophy." In Stern's inter- pretation it thus allowed for the transcendence of Mosaic Judaism in accor- dance with a philosophy of history which saw it only as a stage in the advance of the human spirit.32 In later justifying his position, Stern admitted that he was not a mono- theist in the traditional sense of belief in a transcendent, personal God. Thereby he rejected the theological principle held sacred by the rabbinic reformers no less than by the orthodox. When he was attacked for his immanentist, pantheistic position, Stern began by defending Spinoza as "one of the greatest spirits ever to be born into the lap of our religious com- munity." Even if Spinoza were wrong, "there lay in his titanic struggle for social relationships, display such hostile sentiments to Jews-to the cultured and respectable no less than to the common ones. Thus religious conversion is at once a separation from friends and acquaintances and a desertion to the side of enemies and opponents." 32. AZJ, August 28, 1843, p. 518. Here Stern refers to the earlier language of the first prin- ciple. The later formulation made his interpretation of the principle much more natural.

MEYER cognition of divine truth more genuine Judaism than in many a poetic or prose writing with which modern rabbinism, crawling forward at a snail's pace (derfortkriechende Rabbinismus), has presented us." Then Stern drew upon his Jewish knowledge for a startling comparison. Judaism has not his- torically been "pure monotheism." It has allowed for considerable varia- tion: "Do not the views of many kabbalists, who after all were also Jews, approach the views of Spinoza regarding the nature of the divine to the point where no distinction can be recognized? And who is to say, therefore, whether Judaism in its further development of the concept of God will not once again draw closer to these Spinozistic, or if you will, kabbalistic views?"33 The only concept of revelation which Stern could accept was the human expression of ideas regarding the divine which were far in advance of the thinking of their time and proved fruitful for the conceptions of later genera- tions. The test of revelation was thus historical: whether it could demon- strate its vitality over the course of time. Mosaic revelation could be best understood as the activity of Moses' spirit. Its validity was not intrinsically eternal. By implication, such "revelation" could be negated by further advances of the human mind.34 In addition to philosophical considerations, his awareness of historical criticism had removed Stern from the normative faith community of Juda- ism. He knew that even Jewish authorities of earlier times had cast doubts on the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch and that modern biblical criti- cism had made belief in literal revelation of the biblical text highly prob- lematic. "We must see," he wrote, "whether the positive element of Judaism consists of stories (Geschichten) or of its history (Geschichte), the manner in which it came into existence or what it became.""35 Stern must have realized that his own philosophical and historical views were not shared by many fellow Jews. The first principle in the declaration was deliberately left vague, so that its equivocality would leave room for a variety of theological positions. It was not the task of the Reformfreunde to reexamine the idea of revelation in the light of philosophy and biblical criti- cism. Their task was only to clear away false authority so that free thought would not be constrained. The new structure would be built by Jewish theo- logians-if only they would rise to the challenge! 33.

Why did he not quietly go his own divergent way avoiding the furor and bitter feelings that he must have known would arise from the Reform- freunde declaration? It seems that the most fundamental answer lies in his fear of what would occur if it were not possible to remove the intellectual and emotional onus from Judaism by declaring it devoid of any authority imposing intellectual or practical constraint. In that case, he foresaw that, in the inner struggle between affirmation of filial loyalty and the repulsive force of a negatively viewed authoritative system, the dissociative impulse would prevail. In his own words, written to Abraham Geiger: "I saw myself in my mind's eye twenty years later wandering about with a few others as a curiosity from a bygone age, while all of the younger talents out of disgust and desperation had had themselves baptized, throwing the uneducated masses back centuries."36 Stern feared being left alone-the last cultured Jew. The Reformfreunde provided him with a positive reference group. Its program attempted to remove the psychologically negative elements in Judaism by neutralizing it altogether. After the demise of the Reformfreunde as before, Stern stayed away from synagogues, since he felt the prayers which were said there would for him be blasphemous.37 For some thirteen years he broke with his friend Abraham Geiger on account of their religious differences. Although, like Stern, Geiger was at times highly impatient with the slow pace of what he regarded as the necessary progress of Judaism, his theological orientation was more traditional than Stern's and his stress upon the gradual evolution of Judaism favored historical continuity over revolutionary breaks with the past. Just as important, by the 1840s Geiger was less in emotional conflict with Jewish tradition than were the Reformfreunde. To Stern he wrote that he clung "with love to the entire spiritual development of Judaism from its earliest beginnings down to most recent times and to many of its contempo- rary forms; in a way they make up my personality."38" When later the rela- tionship between the two men was taken up anew, Stern still could not 36.

But Stern's own Jewish interests had not diminished. He commented favorably on Geiger's critical work on the biblical text and he exchanged information with him about the most recent Jewish scholarship and events in the Jewish com- munity. Unlike Creizenach, Stern did not convert to Christianity. Nor did his son, Alfred, a well-known professor of history in Switzerland, who aided the Jewish community of Berne in a lawsuit involving the Protocols of the Elders of Zion and financially assisted young Jewish scholars.39 In the course of his association with the Reformfreunde, Moriz Stern, the freethinking intellec- tual, had chosen to formulate his views on Judaism. Even though the group had been short-lived and severely attacked, the fact that there were indeed some others who shared his feelings of filial piety, and at least partly his religious views, must have provided some reassurance that he would not, after all, remain the only religiously alienated, but emotionally attached Jewish intellectual. When the Reformfreunde beganri to seek adherents, they considered it most desirable that prominent, well-known Jews be won for their cause. In 1842 there was no one who could lend as much prestige to the group as Gabriel Riesser (1806-1863), the inveterate champion of Jewish civil equal- ity in Germany. By November, Stern had been entrusted with the task of writing to Riesser in order to persuade him to join. The two had become close friends a few years earlier, each having the highest regard for the other.40 Like Stern, Riesser too had chosen to sacrifice immediate suc- cess in his career rather than to give up his Judaism. For both, but especially for Riesser, it was a matter of honor. Stern's first letter of November 7, 1842 is not extant, but it must have included both the original declaration of five principles as well as the shorter one which by then had been adopted. In his reply to Stern,41 Riesser leaves no doubt that he prefers the earlier version. The former is forthright and courageous, the latter despicable and cowardly. The original declaration did not shrink back from the rejection of biblical institutions even though to do so was a politically dangerous move. Later it was decided to omit circum- 39.

Giving the Talmud one more blow required considerably less courage. "But to give truth the honor of at least questioning the principle of servility under the yoke of a positive faith, of defending its manly freedom-not to say asserting it- where the stupid tyranny of the state protects a barbaric biblical custom, that naturally is not even considered." And Riesser adds regarding circum- cision: "This repugnant ceremony, insofar as it is to be regarded as religious, must thoroughly disgust every cultured sensibility, as much as Talmud and messiah put together. ...." Riesser was also concerned that the declaration might give comfort to enemies of the Jews. It would make it appear as if Judaism required massive surgery, but Christianity did not. Thus it could lead to the false impression of Judaism's inferiority. Yet Christianity harbored as many abuses as Juda- ism. As long as the dominant faith was not under severe attack, should Jews express themselves so critically about their religion? Riesser would feel comfortable about reforms only when there was full equality and when reform was given free play in both religious camps. If there was to be a dec- laration-and Riesser indicated that he would be willing to sign the first ver- sion-then it would be desirable to add a sentence concerning crass biblical fundamentalism, "in the manner of the worst Protestantism." Although renunciation of the Talmud and of belief in a political messiah would have to be included, he would relegate these statements very much to the back- ground, so there could be no suspicion that the group was courting anti- Semites. From the beginning, reports in the Jewish and general press associated Riesser's name prominently with the Reformfreunde. The connection was widely accepted despite the fact that he had not signed the official declara- tion. In order to set matters straight, Riesser prepared a public statement which was circulated to the Jewish and general press.42 In it he stressed that his failure to join the Reformfreunde had nothing to do with concern for emancipation. Had he believed that a political motive-winning concessions for themselves at the expense of fellow Jews-lay at the bottom of their activity, he would have rebuffed them with utmost contempt. But he was cer- tain that was not the case. Indeed, he respected the Reformfreunde, but he disagreed with them, especially with regard to taking a public stand on cir- 42.

Some fathers were simply having their children baptized, in part at least to avoid the operation. Why could not those who found circumci- sion a more barbaric than religious ceremony, but wished to raise their chil- dren as Jews, be allowed to do so? In response to his statement, Ludwig Philippson politely lectured Riesser on his failure to understand the religious significance of circumcision in Judaism and told him that with regard to the ceremony's physical aspects, he should remember that "our forefathers were fathers too."43 But Riesser had won too great a reputation in German Jewry for anyone to subject him to the same kind of abuse that was heaped on others expounding such views. And, moreover, Riesser-after all-had not joined the group. It is clear from Riesser's letters that his theoretical and practical views were every bit as radical-if not more so-as were those of the Frankfurt circle. Yet his worldview was fundamentally different. As he put it in his let- ter to Stern: "Justice and freedom are still more important to me than enlightenment and reform.""44 It was to the principle of freedom, his Frei- heitsprinzip, that Riesser swore ultimate loyalty. Whether Judaism devel- oped slowly, as reflected by the Hamburg Temple with which he was actively associated, or whether it was much more severely truncated by a group such as the Reformfreunde, did not matter to him as much as the right of the individual to express himself freely in religious matters. He had as much contempt for the forced reform which Mendel Hess had initiated in Weimar as he did for the Frankfurt rabbinate when it attempted to gain government support for the imposition of circumcision on all male Jewish infants regardless of their parents' desires.45 Remarkably free of Jewish self-hate, Riesser was also emotionally more removed from the Jewish tradition than Creizenach or Stern. Not the son of a Jewish teacher or destined for the rabbinate, Riesser had found his religion in political activity conducted 43. Ibid., pp. 486-88. 44. ZGJD, o.s. 2 (1888): 51, and see Stern's recognition of this difference, ibid., p. 72. 45. The circumcision controversy in the Frankfurt community is discussed in Philipson, The Reform Movement, pp. 131-37, and by Liberles. The program of the Reformfreunde stressed that the custom of circumcision was of "pre-Mosaic origin." In the midst of the con- troversy, Joseph Johlson, another teacher at the Philanthropin, published under the pseudo- nym of Bar Amithai a pamphlet entitled Ueber die Beschneidung in historischer und dog- matscher Hinsicht (Frankfurt, 1843). The last two pages contain what must be the first example of a common rite of entry into the covenant for boys and girls. Johlson called it "Die Heiligung am achten Tage (Keduschah lejom hasch'mini)." Despite pressures and some personal distaste, the reform rabbis, during their rabbinical conferences of 1844-46, allowed the omission of cir- cumcision only in cases of clear danger to life.</page><page sequence="19">THE FRANKFURT REFORMFREUNDE 79 according to the highest standards of morality. These standards demanded championing the cause of all Jews and therein he found expression for his Jewish identification.46 While he sympathized with the Reformfreunde, he was unable to reach a meeting of minds with them, not alone because most of the group was more timid than he, but because they simply did not share the same scale of values. IV Any study of the Reformfreunde would be incomplete without a con- sideration of the possible influence of contemporary intellectual currents and of parallel developments in Christianity. As the group's membership consisted largely of men who had studied in universities, who maintained social contact with Christians, and who had a lively interest in the cultural world around them, we should not be surprised to find that the position of the Reformfreunde, while relating mainly to specific Jewish issues, reflects a larger context. In 1842, the dominant philosophy in Germany was still Hegelianism, which in Prussia had received a kind of official status.47 However, Hegel's younger disciples, the Junghegelianer, had transformed the essentially con- servative tone of their master's philosophy into a doctrine that was radical in its consequences for both politics and religion. Far from culminating in the Christian Prussian state, political evolution was expected to proceed beyond it to a breakdown of all authority and, for some, the emergence of anarchy and atheism. This was the viewpoint put forward by the communist writer Moses Hess, who later became a precursor of political Zionism. An article which Hess published in 1843 was held up to the Frankfurt Reformfreunde as drawing out the necessary consequences of their own erosive negativism and their failure to put forward a firm positive doctrine.4s More than once, 46.

MEYER the Frankfurt reformers were accused of a tendency toward nihilism, with its echoes of political subversion. It was David Friedrich Strauss who most thoroughly and effectively drew the consequences of the new Hegelianism for religion. In his Life of Jesus (1835-36), Strauss undermined the most basic dogmas of Christianity with his meticulous analysis of the New Testament text. What made his work especially devastating was the fact that Strauss could not be written off as an outsider with little sympathy for the Christian faith or as a shallow rationalist. He did not attack Scripture on moral grounds like the eigh- teenth-century deists nor merely explain away miracles as natural events in the manner of the rationalist school. Instead, Strauss applied the concept of myth to the Gospel narratives, finding that the stories could not be regarded as historical occurrences, but only as efforts to give substance to contem- poraneously prevailing ideas and expectations. Strauss's work struck at the very heart of Christian doctrine, the miracles and dogmas associated with the life of Jesus. But he himself believed that his criticism had not destroyed the real basis of Christianity; it had only removed it from the biblical text to the soul or spirit of the believer. Its proper object was the idea of humanity as one with God, which the Jesus stories merely exemplified.49 Strauss's carefully reasoned and learned criticism, as well as his insistence upon a spiritual rather than scriptural basis for theology, raised an immense stir in the Christian world,50 and its implications could scarcely be ignored by thoughtful Jews. Strauss's work was paralleled in the writings of other radicals. Ludwig Feuerbach's Essence of Christianity, which appeared in 1841, carried Strauss's theology still further, removing the divine wholly and clearly to the realm of the human spirit, transforming "theology into anthropology." Of Judaism he declared that it was nothing better than a "religion of the most narrow-hearted egoism."5' A year later, and a few weeks after the first meet- ing of the Reformfreunde, the radical Bible critic Bruno Bauer published a study of "The Jewish Problem" in the neo-Hegelian Deutsche Jahrbiicher, 49.

In it he condemned Judaism as a faith which in its theological rigidity and adherence to revealed law had lost its ability to sur- vive in the modern world. History, Bauer proclaimed, had pronounced its final verdict on both Judaism and Christianity.52 It is thus quite clear that in the period leading up to and contempo- raneous with the formation of the Reformfreunde, traditional Christianity, and Judaism along with it, were under severe attack. In the universities and in the press the critical and theoretical work of the Young Hegelian School was the topic of lively and often bitter controversy. The implications for Judaism were twofold. First, the question had to arise: why was similar criti- cism not being undertaken by the Jews with regard to their own tradition? Could reflective Jews blithely continue to believe in a supernatural revela- tion when Christian scholars were undermining such a conception? Second, the aspersions cast on Judaism as a primitive narrow-minded religion could not fail to affect the thinking of those Jews who were most sensitive to opin- ion in the more advanced intellectual circles. The influence of radical Christian thought is most apparent in the writ- ings of the most alienated segment of German Jewry, those for whom even the minimal allegiance to Judaism represented by the Reformfreunde meant an unjustified withdrawal from universalism. In a critique of the Reform- 52. Less well known, but more vicious were the writings of the Nuremberg municipal librarian, Friedrich Wilhelm Ghillany. In a pseudonymous work of 1833 (K. F. Leonegg, Glaubensbekenntniss [Nuremberg, 1833]) he had already cast his lot with theological radical- ism, denying all supernatural revelation and declaring that Jesus was no more than a human being. Following the Damascus Affair he published a thick volume wholly devoted to proving that human sacrifice was a part of the state cult of ancient Israel and that the possibility of its remnants continuing in contemporary Judaism could not be ruled out. The circumcision ritual served him as an example of such a latter-day survival. See F. W. Ghillany, Die Menschenopfer der alten Hebrder (Nuremberg, 1842). Ghillany followed up Bauer's essay with one of his own in which he declared that Jewish emancipation was impossible as long as Jews persisted in their exclusivism. He called for a "reformirtes jildisches Bekenntniss." Though Ghillany aroused widespread contempt among Jews, including reformers, it is not unlikely that the type of think- ing represented by the following statement had its impact on some individuals who were sym- pathetic to the Reformfreunde. He concluded his essay with this warning to the "clearer- headed" Jews: "Should they, however, refuse to dissociate themselves from the traditionalists [den Alten], they would thereby indicate that they too still harbor collective Jewish national hopes, that their connection with fanatical coreligionists is more important to them than entry into the community of German citizens. In that case, they would be well advised to stop talking about emancipation; instead of making accusations against the German spirit (which, to be sure, does not undergo reform rapidly), they should blame no one but themselves."

MEYER freunde, Albert Frainkel, another son of a Jewish educator, complained that Jewish theologians had failed to apply scientific criticism to the Old Testa- ment, completely ignoring the work done by non-Jews in the field. Accord- ing to Frdinkel, if the Reformfreunde would consider seriously what they mean by the Mosaic religion, they would find it is only a stage in the development of the human spirit, not itself capable of evolution.53 Similar views were published shortly thereafter by F. Pinoff, a Jewish physician, who put it very bluntly: "Ruge, Feuerbach, Bauer and their satellites shine brightly and send out their rays to all corners of the world. .... But where are the Jews, who like them would with the power of their spirits and the fear- lessness of their will seek to determine the essence of the human being?""54 Within the circle of the Reformfreunde, it was of course Stern who was most influenced by the Young Hegelians. Riesser had argued that the group might have to mute its criticism of Judaism until such time as free scientific inquiry should lead to practical steps in Christianity as well. His comment astonished Stern, who told him in reply that it was "precisely those move- ments that I see in Christianity which more than anything else spur me just now to desire and further urgently a reforming movement in the Jewish orbit." Stern left no doubt that he was intimately familiar with what he regarded as "the new phase of the philosophical struggle against the belief structure of the church." Young Hegelians were formally renouncing Chris- tianity while there was no equivalent in Judaism to the battering blows they were administering to the dominant faith. Under such circumstances it was the duty of Jews who shared a similar critical perspective to begin the same task in their own domain, thus showing the non-Jews "that we have a com- mon goal.""5 In the course of the controversy over the Reformfreunde, its detractors repeatedly tried to denigrate the group by charging that it was under the influence of Young Hegelian thought.56 Because in the declaration of prin- 53. According to Jost, Geschichte der Israeliten, p. 217, n. 1, Albert Frinkel was the son of David Friinkel who, in addition to being a teacher in Dessau, was a founder and editor of Sulamith, the pioneering periodical of Jewish enlightenment in the German language. His pam- phlet was entitled Das moderne Judenthum, die Frankfurter Reformfreunde und die neue Zeit. Ein Beitrag zur Kritik religioser und socialer Zustande der Gegenwart (Reutlingen, 1844). 54. F.

The very first report on the group stated that their intent was to create a "religion of the spirit" without signs or symbols, and to posit a Judaism which was nothing more than an idea. While the German reform rabbis, devoted to the preservation of Judaism, rejected neo-Hegelianism as a destructive force, the circle of the Frankfurt Reformfreunde found it liberat- ing and-alone within the Jewish community-gave it a hospitable recep- tion. When the Reformfreunde began to hold their gatherings, the theoretical work of the new critics was just beginning to have practical effects in Ger- man Christianity. In 1841 Pastor Leberecht Uhlich created a society calling itself the "Protestant Friends" (Protestantische Freunde).57 The members adopted a set of principles in which they declared it their right to subject all elements of their faith to the scrutiny of reason. By the fall of 1842 they were holding large meetings with the participation of a considerable percentage of laymen. The movement soon developed a radical wing in Halle, led by Gus- tav Adolf Wislicenus, who in a much discussed speech entitled "Whether Scripture? Whether Spirit?" declared that the only authority for Christians was "the spirit alive in ourselves.""8 In 1844 a roughly parallel development occurred in Catholicism with the founding of the German-Catholic move- Schriften 5: 167-70); and many other instances. It is noteworthy that even within the Reform- freunde circle, neo-Hegelianism was not universally regarded as a badge of honor. An unnamed member of the group responded to the criticism of Samuel Hirsch (above, n. 10) by charging the Luxemburg rabbi with Hegelian discipleship. Employing an untranslatable play on words, he wrote: "Unser Verfasser ist wie Ruge, Bruno Bauer, Feuerbach u.a. Hegelscher Ableger, nur ein jfidischer, und possierlich genug, zugleich Rabbine, der, seine Sprache zu reden, das Juden- in Hegel-, und sich in Flegelthum schlechterdings aufgehen lIisst" (IdnJ, October 20, 1844, p. 336). 57.

Directed initially against the antimodern spirit which came to the fore when the church decided to display for pilgrims' veneration the Holy Coat of Trier, it turned against the tight control of the Roman hierarchy and sought to reestablish Catholicism on New Testament foundations. It rejected the abstention from meat on certain days since "the Kingdom of God is not eating and drinking," and it favored religious wor- ship in the German language.59 The Protestant Friends, or Friends of Light (Lichtfreunde) as they were soon called, and the German-Catholics were both imbued with a humanis- tic, universalistic spirit which not only made barriers within Christianity seem less significant, but also drew them closer to nonorthodox Jews.60 59.

The German Catholic movement found some enthusiastic support among German Jews. E. Birkenstein, a teacher of Judaism, urged that Ronge serve as a model for the Jewish reformers. Using-and in part copying without citation-an anonymous pamphlet which had appeared the previous year, he held that the Ger- man Catholics had aroused deep feelings of sympathy among many Jews and had raised their hopes for a similar revitalization and renewal within Judaism. However, the editors of the periodical in which Birkenstein wrote, the reform rabbis A. Adler and H. Wagner, claimed in a note that the German Catholic movement did not influence Jewry and that the Jewish reformers must go their own way. See Die Reform des Judenthums, July 15, 1846, pp. 121-26. The pamphlet was entitled Eine deutsch-jiidische Kirche. Die ndchste Aufgabe unserer Zeit. Von einem Candidaten derjiidischen Theologie (Leipzig, 1845). A K6nigsberg Jew, Dr.ph. M. Frey- stadt, wrote a letter to Johannes Czerski, one of the principal leaders of the movement, telling him that through his efforts all peoples, including the children of Israel, would be blessed. The letter appeared in the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, where it appalled the Berlin Protestant missionary to the Jews, Rev. R. Bellson. He reprinted it in his Blatter fir Israels Gegenwart und Zukunft 1 (1845): 220-21. See also ZrlJ 2 (1845): 426-27. Geiger, too, saw at least some posi- tive impulse for Judaism in the German Catholic movement: Nachgelassene Schriften 5: 177-78. 60. In 1846 Carl Scholl, minister of the Mannheim German Catholic congregation, saw in the new movement "not merely the basis for a unification of Catholicism and Protestantism, but also the possibility of a reunion of Protestantism and reformed Judaism" (cited by Pre- linger, "A Decade of Dissent," p. 353). In later reflecting upon the 1840s Scholl remembered that his efforts had been greeted with sincere enthusiasm by local Jews, who especially appreci- ated the view of Jesus as "an enlightened Jewish reformer." Some had joined their ranks. The German Catholic movement eventually merged with the Protestant Lichtfreunde into "free congregations" which transcended not only internal Christian differences, but Christianity as such. The slogan in the Mannheim community became: "Not pagan, not Jew, but a new creation-not Jew, not Christian, but the new human being."

However, the parallels between the Reformfreunde and its contemporaries are remarkable. Each of the three gave vent to a discontent over the failure of religious institutions to absorb the new critical spirit. Each set itself against accepted authority, whether of ecclesiastical officials or of sacred texts. And each movement ultimately made religion dependent on the divine dwelling wholly in the spirit of man. In the winter of 1845-46, a group of Lichtfreunde was established in tionship between Jews and the free congregations, see Toury, Soziale undpolitische Geschichte, pp. 132-33, and his Die politischen Orientierungen der Juden in Deutschland (Tubingen, 1966), p. 26. 61. Rudolph Benfey (1823-1873) published two pamphlets in which he confessed to Wislicenus that, while he bore the name Jew, he felt himself inwardly to be a Christian. Like the Reformfreunde, Benfey valued the strong family ties among Jews, but he believed that this virtue could serve as the dowry which Jews would bring with them into Christianity. Accepting the Hegelian critique of Judaism as sharply separating the divine from the human, he found his inherited faith religiously deficient and asked Wislicenus to accept him as a Christian. He desired only that Jews be spared the symbolism of separation from their ancestry represented by baptism. The address to Wislicenus was accompanied by a complaint to Moriz Abraham Stern, whom he called his teacher. To Benfey's mind, Stern and the Reformfreunde were engaged in the futile task of trying to preserve a corpse. In contrast, he held that Judaism could not be made to fit the modern world because, by its very nature, it could not fully recognize the historical importance of Christianity. Only a reformed Christianity could approach the ideal of Humanitdit. See his Die Stellung desfortgeschrittenen Juden zu derfreien evangelischen Gemeinde (Halle, 1846) and Die Protestantischen Freunde und die Juden (Leipzig, 1847). Wislicenus wel- comed Benfey's overtures (Bigler, The Politics of German Protestantism, p. 239). Benfey, who like Stern had once been destined for the rabbinate, after his conversion became conf6rencier of Wislicenus's free congregation in Halle. 62. Leberecht Uhlich, Bekenntnisse von Uhlich.

In the press the group was sometimes referred to as "die jiadischen Protestanten" or "die Freien" (Der Orient, August 22, 1843). An orthodox writer of the twentieth century attempted to link the entire awakening of reform activity in the 1840s with the Lichtfreunde and the German Catholics.

MEYER Frankfurt and a number of local Jews participated in meetings where tradi- tional dogmas were argued out of existence.64 A few months later, in the summer of 1846, a petition circulated among Frankfurt Jews accusing the Breslau conference of reform rabbis of disappointing expectations by failing to take more radical actions.65 Though we have no names, there can be little doubt that these gestures were the final protests of Jewish Reformfreunde who had failed in their effort to create the theoretical basis for a radically attenuated Jewishness-one which transcended the Jewish religion in thought and in practice, even as it maintained a spark of loyalty to fellow Jews.
