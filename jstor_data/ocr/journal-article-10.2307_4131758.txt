<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gary Weissman. Fantasies of Witnessing: Postwar Efforts to Experience the Holo- caust. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2004. 288 pp. This is a compelling, meticulously argued, subtle, and literate book on an important subject-although the question of what that subject is remains oddly open. Gary Weissman interprets a number of authoritative and popular represen- tations of the Holocaust (principally those by Elie Wiesel, Lawrence Langer, Stephen Spielberg, and Claude Lanzmann) as evidence of their-and presumably their audiences'-post-Holocaust "efforts to experience the Holocaust" and some- how to recapture that horrific reality in feeling. These efforts, Weissman shows in a measured discussion that contrasts with the high-pitched register of much Holo- 399</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews caust writing, encounter what he sees as fundamental difficulties-and not only because of Primo Levi's chilling reminder that if direct experience is a requirement for authenticity, the only true witnesses of the Holocaust are not those who sur- vived but those who died. The difficulties he identifies vary in the works discussed, and his book's concluding chapter, in which he ends up questioning the warrant for any "fantasies of witnessing," provides only a brief conspectus. He thus leaves his readers to make their own way back to the Holocaust from the post-Holocaust- from which, when the survivors are gone, everyone will set out. This careful line of argument seems to me to lend itself to an even broader rendering of the same evidence. Weissman directs his criticism against attempts to feel the Holocaust anew-more generally, against claims for that as the exclusive criterion of authentic access to the Holocaust. But it is arguable that the true ob- ject of his critique is not the fantasy of current attempts to experience the Holo- caust-a fantasy defined by its failure-but a broader denial of all accessibility whatever to the Holocaust. For the insistence on direct experience follows from a prior claim of the Holocaust's basic incomprehensibility; for all their other differ- ences, the figures Weissman discusses, from Wiesel to Lanzmann, assert in com- mon that there is no understanding or explaining that event. The one route left to them for addressing the Holocaust (as they see it) is then through experience, or feeling-unmediated contact in contrast to the mediations of analysis or reason. The sharp dichotomy assumed here between understanding and feeling is itself questionable, but it is the assumption which appears in it of the inadequacy of all mediated Holocaust-representation that leads into the special pleading (or fanta- sy) on behalf of a form of unmediated experience-one which also turns out (by the claimants' own lights) to fail. The widely held thesis that Weissman attacks thus comes to this: All attempts to explain the Holocaust are bound to be inadequate; the most that can be hoped for, then, is to convey something of the experience-but this, too, must fail be- cause feeling and emotion, even at their fullest, are also inadequate witnesses: They, too, turn out to be mediated. And Weissman's own counter-thesis then emerges: Against the claim that the Holocaust is incomprehensible or inexplica- ble, understanding and explanation are held to be preconditions (and possible, at least to some extent) for access to the Holocaust. It is because the exclusionary ap- peals to experience deny this that the inconsistencies which impede them recur. The fallacy that Weissman brings to light in this way comes out clearly in an otherwise slight incident which he recounts: A dispute between Elie Wiesel and Alfred Kazin over the latter's questioning whether a particular episode in Wiesel's Night-the hanging of a young boy in the camp-was historically accurate. Wiesel's reaction to this challenge was sharp (and ad hominem). Underneath his polemic, however, Weissman identifies a substantive issue: Wiesel's assumption of the privileged authority of the eyewitness (himself) versus the merely historical claims of the scholar (Kazin). This claim of first-person privilege, we are remind- ed, also grounds Wiesel's conception of nonfiction: His book, Night, which on the basis of both internal and external evidence is a novel-libraries typically cata- logue it as fiction-is held by Wiesel himself to be historically factual (or even more truthful than that). Weissman sees in this stance Wiesel's conception of the 400</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Holocaust as metahistorical, beyond analysis or understanding-an assumption to which Weissman attributes the inconsistencies and fissures in much of Wiesel's writing; the unmediated access alleged in Wiesel's retrieval of the past turns out in fact to be mediated in the present, by literary or historical or ideological obtrusions or by language itself. Weissman finds similar lines of reasoning-and difficul- ties-in Langer's (inconsistent) privileging of "Holocaust Testimonies," in Spiel- berg's concealments and omissions in Schindler 's List, and in Lanzmann's stark insistence-notwithstanding his own Shoah-on the Holocaust's incomprehensi- bility. (Just what else, the question persists, would Lanzmann consider the import of Shoah to be?) Even after the many previous readings of the figures and works Weissman discusses, his critique of them is instructive-so much so that I have here gone be- yond the reviewer's normal commission by broadening his argument. Indeed, his objections to what has become a near-canonical conception of Holocaust discourse which assert that the event's unintelligibility for anyone who was not in it suggest a number of more general questions. Unlike many-arguably, most-writers on the Holocaust, Weissman's answer to three principal such questions would almost certainly be no: 1. Is any descriptive or analytic account (even of trivial events, afortiori of momen- tous ones) fully adequate to the events themselves? (Consider how often such ex- pressions appear as "Words fail me . . . ." "Nothing I say can measure up to .... ,' and so forth. Indeed, those locutions represent a standard figure of speech: The preteritio-"No description can come close. .. ."-has been applied to events as large as the Holocaust and as slight as victory in a basketball game. 2. Is personal experience of an event or situations necessary to be able to explain, describe, or understand it? (This claim has at times been made for virtually every type of significant event or experience: sorrow, love, ecstasy, religious belief, dy- ing, fear, beauty. And yet, of course, the efforts of representation-and their achievements-are all around. Is it true in general that one cannotfully grasp or analyze an event or experience without actually living it? Perhaps, but there also are ways of understanding or explaining events and experiences less than fully but significantly-even the Shoah (see again Question 1). (Weissman underscores the often-ignored point that victims of the Holocaust would rarely have seen them- selves as experiencing the Holocaust; brutalized and murdered, they still experi- enced that individually or in small groups.) And then 3. Is the history of the Holocaust as history more difficult to represent-or to un- derstand or to explain-than other complex historical events, for example, the French Revolution or the American Civil War? Perhaps it is the Holocaust's moral enormity that is held to be impossible to comprehend; but what then of radical or even ordinary evil on a smaller scale? In the platonic/rationalist tradition of ethics, all wrongdoing, even the most trivial, is unintelligible, irrational: Is this what makes representation of the Holocaust so difficult? But why accept that platonic view? 401</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews The negative answers to these three leading questions shape an agenda for future discussions of Holocaust-representation. Again, these attributed answers go beyond Weissman's explicit statements-but even without this extension, I would underscore the acuteness of his critique of important figures in Holocaust thought who otherwise have largely escaped criticism (certainly as a group). If my elabo- ration of his views goes too far, readers may (I hope in any event, will) turn to Weissman's own account. To be sure, he might prefer to reach that goal by a less circuitous route-but only a book well worth reading could reach it this way ei- ther.
