<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rivka Ulmer. Ayin Ha-Ra: The Evil Eye in the Bible and in Rabbinic Literature. Hoboken, N.J.: Ktav, 1994. x, 213 pp. Rivka Ulmer's study of the evil eye in rabbinic literature offers a thorough summary of the passages in rabbinic literature which employ the term, as well as of its semantic antecedents in Hebrew Scripture. She examines the meaning of "evil eye" and "good eye," often suggesting psychological understandings. While she has consulted psychological, historical, and folklore research, she rarely applies the methodology of these disciplines in the explication of her literary data. After summarizing significant passages, she usually offers an impressionistic reaction to the meaning of eye imagery in the passage at hand. Following (but not citing) the methodological terminology of Jacob Neusner, Ulmer argues that "the system of rabbinic Judaism is a religious one dealing with God's attributes, emanations, and laws" (p. viii), and she argues that the evil eye went unexamined in rabbinic Judaism because, to her view, the rabbis did not believe that the eye had power independent of divine control. Ulmer does not examine the use of eye imagery in the ancient Near East, where the eye, sight, and the spoken word are all understood to</page><page sequence="2">152 BOOK REVIEWS possess power. Ulmer also imposes a medieval rationalist framework upon the rabbinic literary corpus, for she presumes that the rabbis of all periods spoke with one voice, articulated a single rational theology, and possessed a monochrome view of the world. While the mystical tradition in Judaism spoke of "emanations," the rabbinic system did not. Rabbinic Judaism does not deal with divine attributes, or "predicates," which are a concern of medieval epistemology. Ulmer has not applied the folklore research findings or methodologies of Dov Noy or Dan Ben Amoz, or the implications of culture realia of Daniel Sperber's research. While thorough, she does not present a scientific explication of the evil eye phenomenon in rabbinic literature. After suggesting that the use of the "eye" is a metaphor of intent in Hebrew Scripture, Ulmer contends that the notion of an evil or benevolent eye possessing power is a Mediterranean phenomenon. In point of fact, the biblical and Babylonian face serves a function similar to that of the eye as viewed by the rabbis. The shining face of Shamash is a source of order and legal vindication,' the radiance of the Lord's face in Hebrew Scripture (Numb 6:24-26) is taken to be a source of blessing for Israel, while the biblical hiding of the face (Deut 32:20), taken by the later tradition to be a withdrawal of providential care, indicates divine displeasure. Popular taste and belief are sometimes translated into folk idioms which color the religious applications of the exoteric normative literary canon. The many eyes of the angel of death, like the many eyes of the 'ofanim, reflect ubiquity as well as power. Ulmer does not distinguish between metaphor, meaning, and actual belief, and she does not offer any methodological means of examining the relationships between levels of meaning. On one hand, she concedes that the Angel of Death image appears regularly in the Hekhalot literature but only once in the Babylonian Talmud. The place of the Hekhalot writings in normative, or "Formative" (Ulmer's term, borrowed, again uncited, from Neusner), Judaism should have been examined at this point. By leaving the genre of "rabbinic literature" undefined, Ulmer again gives the reader the confusing impression that the Judaisms of the Mishnah, Midrash Tehillim, the Babylonian Talmud, and the Hekhalot represent one consistent whole, wrought of one seamless conceptual cloth. After suggesting that Balaam's evil eye had to be closed to obviate his using his power against Israel, Ulmer 1. Wapamnz is the Akkadian equivalent of the Hebrew root yp', which means "to appear"; the Akkadian causative ?iGpa means "to shine," and is often associated with the shining justice of Shamash.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 153 contends that the "rabbis generally understood Balaam's power to use an evil eye as an evil characteristic that should not imitated" (p. 121). However, the blinding of Balaam (shetum ha-'ayin [Numb 24:3], taken to be "of closed eye" in the singular in B. Niddah 31a) may be better understood as a divine withdrawal of a gift abused. Further, the "rabbis" to whom Ulmer refers are not adequately defined. There is no attempt to associate the evil eye with a school of thought, geography, or literary form. Rivka Ulmer has done a great deal of research in assembling and orga- nizing the various texts regarding the "evil eye," and for this worthy exercise she is to be commended. She was a visiting scholar at Brown, where she apparently learned the terminology and methodology of Jacob Neusner. But according to Neusner, a document must be studied first in order to determine its message, and then it must be examined as an exemplar of its genre, and finally it must be read in context of the history, literature, and mindset of its age. Subsequent scholarship in the field must take into account the historical situation of the texts which use the idiom, the nature of the various genres of Jewish writing in late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, and how the idiom and idea, with its philological, semantic, and thematic range, is used in cognate languages and neighboring cultures. A structural and/or folklore analysis of the narratives in which the idiom occurs would help to define the context of the idiom as it moved from biblical to rabbinic (as well as Christian and pagan) literatures and cultures.
