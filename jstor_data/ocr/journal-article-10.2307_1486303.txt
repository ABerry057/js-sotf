<plain_text><page sequence="1">THREE CONTEMPORARY PERCEPTIONS OF A POLISH WUNDERKIND OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY by DAVID RUDERMAN University of Maryland I In the year 1620,' Abraham b. Naphtali Hirsch Schor,2 the head of the rabbinical court of Satanov, Poland, wrote to Rabbi Mordecai b. David Katz3 of the neighboring community of Lvov (Lemberg) about a "great and terrible act of God which I heard and saw with my own eyes here in the holy congregation of Satanov." R. Abraham related the following story:4 ... Here in the holy congregation of Gr6dek (Gorodok) three parasangs away 1. The Schor letter is undated but Joseph Solomon Delmedigo, the first to publish the let- ter, had arrived in Poland by the beginning of 1620. (Cf. Isaac Barzilay, Yoseph Shlomo Del- medigo, Yashar of Candia, His Life, Works and Times [Leiden, 1974], p. 59.) Abraham Yagel in Italy had already received an extensive report on the Gr6dek child by late 1620. 2. On Abraham b.

Gedaliah with a small four-and-a- half-year-old son. The youth is a mere boy having no superiority in his studies over the rest of the children of his age. But when his father began to study the Hebrew alphabet and the prayer book with him and saw that the holy spirit rests upon him, he subsequently brought the boy before me to the holy con- gregation of Satanov to test him. And I tested him several times-a hundred times and more-myself along with my colleagues who were with me and we saw the work of the Lord and his wonders, for He is exceedingly great. I asked him: "Please tell me the beginning of the halakhah learned today." He immediately related the halakhah, answering: "Rabbi Ashi said that our mishnah states: I can likewise prove," etc. Rabbi Abraham then proceeded to question the boy about various passages in the Zohar, asking the father to have his son quote from specific pages. The child answered correctly even when the rabbi failed to mention a spe- cific page but only placed his finger on a particular passage in the book hidden from the child but apparently not from his father. The boy was even able to read the rabbi's mind, quoting precisely biblical passages which Rabbi Abraham had been contemplating, again through the mediation of the father. In light of such an incredible demonstration, the rabbi could only conclude that "the boy knows what is in the heart of man and this can only be a spirit of prophecy." He was especially impressed by the child's ability when he considered that the boy still had not learned to read fluently but occasionally mispronounced words and was generally very shy. The news of the extraordinary child of Gr6dek quickly spread to several other Jewish communities in Poland. Quoting R. Abraham's testimony, a Joshua of BrzeS' Litowski (Brest-Litovsk) wrote to the head of the rab- binical tribunal of Vilna, who then ordered that the story not be told to women and children and especially not to Gentiles.5 The bearer of R. Joshua's letter, a Jew from Lublin, also carried to the tribunal a second let- ter from R. Abraham Schor. In this, the Satanov rabbi related how he had 1'" 2 M11)X Vil 1'" ?JYD r 1 O1 n 1? r D I,?'m jD r imo0 onixo p"p? no rnn mxr nx'x yx vrprnu mi i"f ru p'1 rn r'-ri rn awmtv u rm mr'inn "1 x)rr'~ru i v vnxr .ixi, iru ' n rm m" n n x vix'l rW mx in'xi yivx ...-1 1D, -,? l rnnn 'lv.K n VnK u ru~rur wvrn r1 Ir7 112K.

In his Hebrew work Sefer 'Elim, first published in Amsterdam in 1629, Delmedigo quoted R. Abraham's letter in full, mentioned how its contents had reached Lvov and Vilna, and also reproduced another letter from his own disciple, Moses Metz, addressed to a Karaite, Zerab b. Nissim, in which Delmedigo's own role in the entire affair was described.' Metz's letter was an account of how he and Delmedigo had traveled to the town of Gr6dek to observe first-hand the spectacle of the precocious child who had become by that time such a cause c6l1bre that "all the Polish rabbis and with them several thousand Jews feared to see him." But the shrewd Delmedigo was capable of exposing the deception of the Gr6dek child prodigy: For immediately when my teacher [Delmedigo] saw that he needed his father, he detected a trick whereby he [the father] would give him clues in code. For example, for the letter "aleph," he would say "yes" to him in Yid- dish; for "bet," "good"; for "gimel," "right" and so on. And the questioner had to ask the question through his father and his father would elicit an answer from him [the boy], placing in his mouth the letters with these pseudo- nyms so that he would recite the letters without vowels or vocalization and his father would interpret and vocalize them.8 Delmedigo confirmed his initial suspicion by testing the child without the assistance of his father and immediately "the trick was made known to all the congregation." Metz further explained how the father had made a handsome profit from his guile and how the rabbis finally excommunicated the father when they learned of his deceitful behavior. The boy died soon 6.

Metz also acknowledged that even after his teacher had publicly exposed this imposter, some ardent fol- lowers continued to believe in him, and he strongly admonished those who uncritically accepted such popular superstitions "for they are the affairs of women and the masses."9 Elsewhere in Sefer 'Elim, Delmedigo himself recounted the affair, under- scoring the chicanery of the father.'0 In yet another work, Mayref la- hokhmah, he once more proclaimed: "But as regards the affair of the Polish child from Gr6dek, it was a trick, as I have shown to all the world when I came to see it."" From the accounts of Delmedigo and Metz, the matter apparently ended with the excommunication of the father and the premature death of his son, even though they acknowledged that a small number of enthusiastic supporters stubbornly persisted in believing in the boy, "because of their own embarrassment in revealing how ignorant they had been." But both Delmedigo and Metz had apparently underestimated the magnetic appeal of the Polish wonderchild. For despite Delmedigo's insis- tence that he had shown the world the trick of the boy's father, there re- mained those who either ignored Delmedigo's demonstration or else remained impervious to Delmedigo's claim that he had ever exposed the father in the first place. In fact, Delmedigo's assumption that his disclosure had convincingly closed the case of the Gr6dek boy was perhaps more wish- ful thinking than an accurate reading of the responses of the boy's following. Besides the material found in Sefer 'Elim, at least two other contempo- rary references to the Polish child exist, neither published to date. The first is a letter written by Mordecai b. David Katz of Lvov to Hayyim Vital, the major disciple of Isaac Luria and the great kabbalistic authority in Safed. Katz, after having received the initial notice of Rabbi Abraham Schor regarding the boy from Gr6dek, recopied the entire letter of Schor as found in Delmedigo's work and then added the following story: A female servant had worked for a certain Jew in the holy congregation of Potylicz. When two years had passed, she ran away from the Jew without tell- 9.

But immediately after her escape, some hostile Gentiles from the same place of Potylicz arose to slander this Jew by saying: "Where is this woman servant who had worked for you?" But the Jew did not know where she had fled. In short, this confusion continued to in- crease because of our many sins until God gave them the inspiration to say: "Let us go to visit and inquire of this same boy." And behold when they came to the boy, before they said anything to him, the boy began to speak [of how] these men had come to investigate the whereabouts of the maid servant and he mentioned her by name, that she was alive, and that they should be relieved of their confusion. 2 The boy had intended to reveal the woman's whereabouts but was suddenly interrupted by "one wicked man" (could this be a reference to Delmedigo?) who began to argue with the boy's father, causing him to flee from the place. Subsequently, the boy would say nothing more. Rabbi Katz asked Vital to examine the entire matter in order to advise him what action to take. He turned to Vital because he had heard that shortly before Isaac Luria had died, he had told his disciple Vital that during the latter's lifetime "one boy would appear in the land of Edom [=Christian lands] who would relate wondrous and terrible things of God."" The second reference to the Gr6dek boy is found in a large collection of letters and other materials compiled by Abraham b. Hananiah Yagel, an Italian Jewish physician and author.'4 In the fall of 1620, Yagel first heard 12. K'1,n nrni vzo rr'x nT1 1n1ntK nnji 1"n]v i Vt,7xDD Kp- p: ,x,'n r 5x ,m-o nn nnx ? ?n?...

Yagel's</page><page sequence="6">148 DAVID RUDERMAN the news of the Polish child in his place of residence in Modena. Yagel mentioned the boy's impressive knowledge of Jewish law, his ability to answer any question posed to him and his talent to deter successfully "the many who rose up against him to kill him." He also related how the boy heard the sweet song of angels in his ears but, beyond this, it was impossible for him to recount all of his numerous accomplishments. He did, however, wish to emphasize the miraculous dimension of the boy's achievements.'5 Some months later, in a second letter, Yagel added the following details to his earlier description of the boy: Ten Jewish authorities of considerable stature from those regions [of Poland] went and found the boy, met with him in a certain place and asked him to tell them about the redemption and the transformation and the secret of when the wondrous end will come. But the boy refused to answer until they adjured him in the name of God that he tell what he knew. Then he replied: "Know that you will not be set at peace by my words." But their hearts were most troubled concerning this and the men pleaded with him. But when he began to answer them that on the next Nisan, birth pangs will begin and a period of trouble will come to Jacob, he could not manage to say that they would be saved and how the salvation would transpire, for a fire fell from heaven and he departed in a storm and was no longer visible to them.'6 Upon witnessing this miraculous sight, the entire community mourned and fasted in trepidation over what they had experienced. Yagel related how after some forty days the boy finally returned, to the delight and relief of the community. But this time, the rabbis zealously guarded the child and re- frained from asking him any further provocative questions.'7 two letters on the Gr6dek boy are found in MS Moscow Giinzburg 129, fols. 108v-112r.

From Gr6dek to Lvov, to Lublin and Vilna, and finally to Modena and even Safed, reports of the Polish youth had indeed made him a celebrity. And what had origi- nated as merely the tale of a precocious child with an unusual aptitude for reciting passages from the Talmud and Zohar had ultimately become a saga of imposing dramatic appeal which now included an engaging portrait of a miraculous boy sung to by angels, capable of proving false a Christian libel brought against Jews, possessing no less than the secrets of the divine redemption, and ascending in fire to his heavenly abode. Delmedigo's bold assertion that he had shown "to all the world" the trick of the child of Gr6dek had obviously made little impact on what may have been a con- siderable number of people. How might one explain the hypnotic appeal of the Gr6dek child in the face of apparently strong evidence that he was indeed an imposter? How was it possible for a local town-wonder to enjoy such preeminence in the cities of Poland and beyond-to Italy and Palestine? And how might one understand the curious fact that, with the exception of Delmedigo and his associate, the story was considered significant enough to engage the serious attention of not only a group of Polish rabbis and their constituencies but also a major kabbalistic authority and an Italian Jewish doctor and natural scientist? A careful examination of the various perceptions of the boy from Gr6dek might afford an interesting perspective in which to view the highly complex and multifaceted cultural experience of Jews living at the beginning of the seventeenth century. II Of course, the story of the Polish wonderchild was not without precedent in earlier Jewish literature. The motif of a child prodigy unraveling the secrets of the divine had captivated the imagination of many Jews for cen- turies. One need only consider the abundance of stories in rabbinic literature on the infancy and youth of biblical heroes like Cain, Noah, and Moses-in particular their miraculous abilities to speak when new-born babes.'"

The stories of young children with wondrous abilities appearing before wise men and other adults with startling revelations of mystical knowledge were especially favorite subjects to the author of the Zohar.20 In fact, Abraham Yagel himself in his discus- sion of the Gr6dek child did not miss the parallel between these kabbalistic stories and the Polish marvel.2' Of special significance in this regard is the fascinating story of the cha- racter of Rabbi Gaddiel, made famous in most recent times in the writing of S. Y. Agnon22 and particularly well known in Jewish kabbalistic literature of the seventeenth century. The story portrays a wonderchild who possessed divine knowledge and was killed at the age of seven by his enemies, but ascended to the Garden of Eden to learn the divine mysteries from God Himself. As Gershom Scholem has demonstrated, the midrashic work, The Testament ofR. Eliezer the Great, represents the original source of this story. It was later copied by Hayyim Vital and incorporated into the writings attributed to Isaac Luria. In the seventeenth century, R. Jacob b. Hayyim Zemabl, a Portuguese emigre who settled in Jerusalem and a major disciple of Luria, published the story in his Sefer nagid u-mesavveh. It reappeared later in the seventeenth century in a collection entitled the Shulban 'arukh of R. Isaac Luria and in the beginning of the eighteenth century in the Sefer hemdat yamim.23 In fact, the stories of R. Gaddiel and the Gr6dek boy are sources listed in Dov Neuman (Noy), "Motif-Index of Talmudic Midrashic Literature," Ph. D. diss., Indiana University, 1954 (University Microfilms, Ann Arbor, Michigan, F1362), T500-599 (Conception and Birth), including such motifs as a child looks at birth like twenty- year-old youth, child speaks at birth, one-month child speaks to confute false accusations, child walks and talks immediately, etc. 19.

Gaddiel, the Polish child possessed divine knowledge, as the singing of angels in his ears suggested. Also similar in the two stories is the threatening situation in which both found themselves when enemies desired to kill them. Even the background of Gentile hostility to Jews, more obvious in the martyrdom of Gaddiel, is nevertheless intimated in the Gr6dek boy's involvement in the episode of the Jew and his missing Christian maid. Might it not be plausible to surmise that R. Mordecai Katz also had in mind the story of R. Gaddiel when he decided to address his query to the renowned Ijayyim Vital? The phenomena of wonderchildren were not merely the imaginative products of Jewish literary invention; they had also become by the seven- teenth century a part of the historical memory of the Jewish community. At the end of the thirteenth century, the Spanish Jewish community had en- countered a boy prophet similar in many respects to the prodigy of Gr6dek. In a well-known responsum of R. Solomon b. Adret, the rabbi described an unusual child in Avila who, while ignorant and untutored, had experienced angelic visions which inspired him to write a book of biblical commen- taries.24 For Adret, the most puzzling aspect of this spectacle was that an uneducated child was capable of composing written treatises of remarkable erudition. Although the biographies of the Avila and Gr6dek children are not altogether similar, the parallel between the two did not escape the atten- tion of either R. Abraham HIayyim Schor25 or R. Abraham Yagel.26 Both referred to Adret's responsum and both suggested an analogy between the two boys, although for Schor the Gr6dek youth was clearly more remark- able. What both observers could not have failed to note in studying the two figures was the common eschatological import of their prophetic statements. In the case of the Spanish child, his visions were directly related to an inspired Joachimite apocalyptic literature appearing at the end of the thir- teenth century. In fact, Avila itself had emerged as a conjectured place of origin of the Messiah who was to appear in 1295. The aura of messianic anticipation was also manifest in the Gr6dek child who, according to the 24. On the wonderchild of Avila, see R. Solomon b.

A similar eschatological theme was prominent in the tale of an even more illustrious Jewish child prodigy named Nabman.27 The story of this youthful prophet was traditionally ascribed to David b. Abraham Maimuni (1222-1300), the Nagid of Egypt who is thought to have composed a com- mentary on the apocalypse prophesied by Nabman for the rabbis of Bar- celona. In fact, these prophecies were most likely written close to the time of David ha-Nagid, sometime during the thirteenth century.28 In the early six- teenth century, the prophecies of Nabman enjoyed a renewed popularity due to the commentary of R. Abraham b. Eliezer ha-Levi, a Spanish 6migr6 and kabbalist, who wrote his work in Jerusalem in 1517. Primarily because of R. Abraham's treatment of Nahman, the prophecies were widely circulated among the Spanish Jewish immigrants who had settled in Italy, Turkey, and Palestine. At the end of the sixteenth century, Gedaliah ibn Yahya included the story of Nahman in his Shalshelet ha-qabbalah29 and like the Gaddiel narrative, it was included in the Sefer nagid u-mesavveh in the seventeenth century.30 In the aftermath of the Jewish expulsion from Spain, the Nahman prophecies accurately reflected the atmosphere of apocalyptic expectation prevalent in the Jewish community of the sixteenth and seventeenth cen- turies. Joseph Dan has suggested that the story of the Gr6dek child represents a kind of parody of the story of Nahman, embellished by Delmedigo in order to ridicule such imaginative tales.31 That the Gr6dek affair is more than a literary parody on Na1man seems evident, however, from the other con- temporary testimonies regarding the Polish boy discussed above. Yet more remains to be said of the relationship between the two boys. 27. On the prophecies of Nabman, see Gershom Scholem's various articles on R. Abraham b. Eliezer ha-Levi in Kiryat Sefer, especially 2 (1925-26): 101-41; 7 (1930-31): 149-65, and the recently revised edition of these articles by Malachi Beit-Arie, Ha-mequbbal R.

In answer to the first inquiry, Yagel concluded that Nahman's astrological data sug- gested a premature and unnatural death for the boy. In his second response, Yagel copied the boy's biography as told to him by Fano-the circum- stances of his parents, his prophecy at birth, his long silence for twelve years, his final blessing to his parents and his premature death-and then offered a learned interpretation of this phenomenon.33 Fano's inquiry together with Yagel's answer provide further evidence of the wide currency of these prophecies among Italian Jewry at the end of the sixteenth century. Addi- tionally, they offer proof of a direct connection between Nahman and the Polish child. The same Italian Jew who had reported on the Gr6dek youth had also reflected some twenty years earlier on the prophecy of Nahman. Could he have failed to notice the obvious similarities between the two youths-their precocity, their premature deaths and, most significantly of all, the theme of messianic anticipation which infused both their stories? Nahman, it seems, had the opportunity of uttering his messianic prophecies, whereas the Gr6dek boy was interrupted by a heavenly fire before speaking of the redemption. But both stories were obviously products of the same collective mood of Jewish messianic expectation. A generation such as that of Yagel's, charmed by the revival of the story of Nahman and his prognos- tications, would have greeted the tale of the boy from Gr6dek with equal fascination and anticipation. III For Abraham Yagel, however, the appeal of the Nahman and Gr6dek stories was certainly not limited to an anticipation of the imminent coming of the Messiah. Delmedigo had apparently derided such wonderworkers as the boy of Gr6dek because of his own scientific proclivities and rational atti- tude. But Yagel, his contemporary, an erudite physician and important 32. MS Moscow-Giinzburg 129, fols. 72v-73v. 33. Yagel's description of Nabman as told to him by Fano closely parallels the accounts of Ibn Yabya and Zemab. His unique explanation of this phenomenon is further discussed below.</page><page sequence="12">154 DAVID RUDERMAN scientific popularizer in his own right, chose to treat such wonders seriously precisely because of their scientific interest. Yagel and Delmedigo were both outstanding products of the enlightened cultural world of Italian Jewry in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, and both scholars played important roles in introducing the Hebrew reader of their day to the latest scientific information.34 In view of Delmedigo's critical and derisive attitude toward the Gr6dek child, Yagel's contrasting sympathetic treatment is all the more interesting. After recounting the wondrous acts of the Polish prodigy, Yagel attempted to understand the phenomenon. He readily admitted the super- natural dimension of this child, all the more remarkable to him since prophecy according to the rabbis had ceased since the days of Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. But although the prophets no longer existed, Yagel contended, visionaries and seers were still to be found and, on occasion, possessed the "divine spirit on their tongues."" In the case of the boy of Gr6dek: " .. . according to what has been heard, he is accurate in what he says and is consistently wise and knowledgeable; one asks and he responds; one asks about a given subject and he answers correctly as if he were a mature person who had acquired knowledge and possesses heavenly know- ledge to foretell the future ... ."36 Such ability, Yagel concluded, is a univer- sal attribute of certain individuals, both Jews and non-Jews, who are pre- pared to receive divine inspiration either "according to a natural disposition [on their parts] or a disposition achieved by [their own] effort.""37 After defining this kind of prophetic aptitude, Yagel illustrated this observation with a number of examples from history. First he recalled Balaam and his prophetic abilities.38 Then he mentioned two examples of child prophets 34. On Delmedigo's role in writing Hebrew scientific works, see Barzilay, Yoseph Shlomo Delmedigo, especially p. 3.

But this young maiden arose, aroused herself from her slumber, gathered her strength, left her flock in the field, went to King Charles and told him what she told him; for the essence of her words was that she desired to lead his armies and to be victorious over his enemies. And the king trusted her word and placed her in charge of his army; and she girded her weaponry and fought the king's enemies and was victorious over them with great honor. And chroniclers of that time sang her praises as if she were skilled in war from her youth and knew her enemies' strategy in war.39 And who would believe the account of the child born in England named Merlin who revealed future events and secret things and who transcribed in a document before the kings and nobles all that would happen to them in the end of days, in addition to all the incredible feats he accomplished in the days of his youth which were re- corded in the chronicles of that kingdom.40 Yagel concluded his short natural history of divine seers by mentioning two additional examples of Jewish visionaries, the child prophet of Avila 39.

All of these illustrations thus provided sufficient historical precedents to lend credibility to the fantastic tale of the child from Gr6dek. Yagel's natural explanation of the prophetic gift is reminiscent of similar approaches taken by some of his learned Christian contemporaries. Augus- tino Nifo and Pietro Pomponazzi had presented parallel expositions of prophetic endowment almost a century earlier.42 More recently Girolamo Cardano, a leading intellectual figure in the scientific world of sixteenth- century Italy, had likewise sought a natural explanation for the prophetic gift. For Cardano, certain men exceeded others in their powers of clair- voyance and divination, faculties which they had possessed since birth.43 In his massive scientific encyclopedia, De rerum varietate, Cardano claimed that he himself possessed the power to go into a trance whenever he pleased, to see anything he wished by the force of his own imagination, and to foresee his own future in dreams or in his fingernails.44 Immediately fol- lowing the description of his own endowments, Cardano presented a cata- logue of other unnatural and miraculous phenomena, including descriptions of both Joan of Arc and Merlin.45 Abraham Yagel knew of Cardano's work, quoted him directly on other occasions, and appears to have been pro- foundly influenced by this erudite but eccentric Christian scholar.46 In all 41.

Yagel presented a somewhat different explanation, however, in his response to Menahem Azariah Fano regarding Nakman's authenticity as a prophet.47 As with the Gr6dek child, Yagel did not consider Nahman to be a legitimate prophet, but placed him in the category of a monster, a species which, he explained, was well known in nature and previously documented by the ancients such as Xenophon48 and by medieval Arabic scholars such as Ibn Abi 1-Ridjdl (=Aben Ragel).49 Yagel referred to an entire chapter of Ibn Abi 1-Ridjal's work, called in Latin De iudiciis astrorum, on monsters and other natural prodigies.50 By placing Nahman in the category of monsters, Yagel revealed strik- ingly his knowledge of a significant subject of the scientific literature of his day directly related to the subject of wonderchildren.5' By the sixteenth and praised this Italian scholar.

Cf. Belt ya'ar ha-Levanon, book 1, chap. 1; book 4, chap. 71. Perhaps he also re- ferred here to the same birth story or perhaps Yagel's reference to Xenophon was not a direct quotation but simply taken from Ridjal.

As Jean Ceard has recently demon- strated, the unusual fascination with monsters in Yagel's age was symptom- atic of a larger intellectual problem of late Renaissance culture, that of the idea of nature. In the sixteenth century, nature represented a living organism in perpetual activity and thereby revealed a deep structural harmony of analogous relationships and coherence between various parts. A student of nature thus encountered a marvelous variety of things (to use the phrase coined by Cardano as the title of his aforementioned work) which repre- sented both a source of discomfort and even terror to him but, at the same time, constituted the grandeur of his human condition. For man's task was to record the various "signs" that nature revealed, to classify them and to offer a coherent explanation of their origin and behavior. The unusual fas- cination of the age with monsters and prodigies stemmed from the desire to record and measure every abnormality so as to penetrate the order and regu- larity of the universe. Monsters testified to the fecundity and multiformity of nature; they also functioned as portents of things to come. A knowledge of these signs permitted men to acquire greater wisdom about the universe, but at the same time they dramatically indicated the finitude of human experi- ence. For nature still chose to hide its face, to deceive man. And thus accompanying the effort to explain monsters in a natural context was a chill- ing fear that all had not yet been explained. The monster might also repre- sent a sign, an omen, a celestial notice of the potential terror and instability of the yet unknowable future. Thus for most of the sixteenth century, the "natural sciences" of divination and classifying monsters remained closely intertwined.52 Girolamo Cardano was especially preoccupied with numerous tales of 52. This is a summary of the theme of Ceard's work. See especially pp. vii-xiv, 485-93. Ceard's explanation of the sixteenth century fascination with monsters is reinforced by anthro- pologists Mary Douglas and Edmund Leach in their discussions of the concepts of cultural anomalies and taboos. According to their view, each person attempts to perceive the world as a stable entity in which all objects have recognizable shape, location, and permanence. An anomaly constitutes an uncomfortable fact which refuses to fit into any established system of classification, seemingly defying cherished assumptions. Such anomalies attract maximum interest and often elicit intense feelings of taboo. Cf. Mary Douglas, Purity and Danger (Lon- don, 1966), especially pp. 48-53, and Edmund Leach, "Anthropological Aspects of Language: Animal Categories and Verbal Abuse" in Pierre Maranda, ed., Mythology (London, 1972), pp. 39-67.

Yagel in his Gei bizzayon presented a long discourse on unnatural death as well as the strange birth of Siamese twins in Venice during his lifetime.54 In his medical correspondence, he displayed a fascination with various manifestations of psychic pheno- mena,55 and in his Beit ya'ar ha-Levanon, he included an entire treatise on dreams and divination, reviewing both the literature of the ancients and some of his contemporaries on the subject.56 In the cases of the Gr6dek child and Nahman, Yagel thus encountered a subject already familiar to him from his previous reading on divination and monsters and from his own medical experience. Instead of rejecting such children out of hand, Yagel treated them seriously as matters worthy of psychological explanation. With his scientific contemporaries, Yagel shared a view of the universe which hypothesized a harmony of corresponding relationships between each part of the physical and heavenly worlds. Out of such a view arose a sensitive awareness on his part of the ubiquity and in- dividuality of hidden natural powers throughout the entire cosmos. Con- temporary science as understood by Yagel, Cardano and many others, could hardly distinguish clearly between the universe as a religious subject and as a scientific one. Thus, for Yagel, Na1hman and the Gr6dek child were concur- rently objects of scientific inquiry and presages of messianic redemption. Because of the ill-defined area where prophecy, mysticism, and the miracu- lous mingled with scientific experimentation in the sixteenth and seven- teenth centuries,57 Yagel came to share a common universe of discourse with the Polish rabbis and with kabbalistic sages of Safed and Italy such as Vital and Fano. All of them, Delmedigo excepted, treated the Gr6dek child with the utmost seriousness and responded to his fabulous behavior with credu- lity and curious amazement. 53.

For the extraordinary tale of the Polish child is hardly a story unique to the Jewish experience. Indeed it is really no more than a Jewish variation on a theme of universal import. Examples abound in both Western and Eastern civilizations of children with divine qualities, who per- form wonders and possess powers of healing, but at the same time are con- stantly threatened by extraordinary dangers. The spiritual biographies of heroes of classical antiquity are replete with stories of the wonders worked by their subjects in childhood.5" And is there a better example of the won- derchild motif than Jesus the divine child? To be childlike was to be Christ- like, and the followers of Christ were called children of God.59 In Eastern religions the theme was no less common. Krishna was worshipped as a child possessing divine power.60 In like manner Buddha was portrayed as a won- derchild in his religious tradition.6' In the same period that the Gr6dek and Nalman stories had circulated among Jews, the theme of the holy child enjoyed an especially powerful appeal in European civilization. Philippe Aries, in his now classic study of the history of childhood, was the first to locate a distinct awareness of child- ren in European society in the seventeenth century.62 Aries marshaled an abundance of evidence from iconography of children, children's dress, 58. See for example Moses Hadas and Morton Smith, Heroes and Gods (Freeport, New York, 1970), pp. 3, 103; Cairoly Kerenyi, "The Primordial Child in Primordial Times" in C. G.

By that period, portraits of children became commonplace, children ceased to be dressed like their parents, new pastimes were initiated which centered around children and, most significant, a new pedagogic literature emerged placing education in the forefront of man's obligations. Of particular rele- vance to the theme of wonderchildren is Aries's emphasis on the religious importance of children as special objects of devotion. Thus a typical seven- teenth century prayer recaptured the sentiments of Mark: "Give us a holy childhood ... which makes us increasingly new creatures in Jesus Christ and leads us to glorious immortality. .... Be like new-born children ... unless you become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven."63 Children were seen by clerics and laymen alike as witnesses to baptismal innocence, comparable to angels and close to the Christ who loved them. Through discipline and moral instruction, they were capable of being transformed into rational men and good Christians.64 Richard Trexler in his study of the youth of Florence in the late Renais- sance reinforced Aries's general observations with special reference to the new youth confraternities of Florence. As early as the fifteenth century, Trexler argued, a new ideology of youth and adolescence was vigorously proselytized by the confraternities. Savonarola, in particular, saw the young as the salvation of the world who, when segregated from their families and indoctrinated with Christian virtue, could become ideal adult types and ritual saviors.65 Similar fascination with wonderchildren prevailed in England as well in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.66 English literature of this period preserves numerous accounts of wondrous and prodigious children. Especially significant was the revival of interest in the most famous child prophet of England, Merlin, whose prophecies were republished and enthu- 63. Quoted by Aries, ibid., p. 122. 64. Aries's work has been both refined and criticized by later scholars. See for example Lloyd de Mause, ed., The History of Childhood (New York, 1974); David Hunt, Parents and Children in History: The Psychology of Family Life in Early Modern France (New York, 1970). 65.

Yet one might tentatively offer, in conclusion, a tempting hypothesis suggested by a reading of C. G. Jung's essay on the motif of divine children.68 For Jung, the child motif in Western and Eastern literature represents or personifies certain instinctive data of the dark, primitive psyche. The child myth emerges in a culture where man has become unchildlike and artificial and has lost his roots. The sudden appearance of a wonderworking child represents a vehement con- frontation with primary truth or with the original unconscious and instinc- tive state of humanity. Jung understood the miraculous child's emergence as inevitable, coming to compensate, correct, or "heal" the one-sidedness or extravagances of the conscious mind. A common feature of all child myths was that the child who possessed extraordinary powers still remained defenseless, in continual danger of extinction. The adversities of the child were to Jung a symbolic representation of the inevitable conflict between the youthful bearer of a "high consciousness" and his surroundings. In short, the divine child myth graphically represented the yearning of a civilization in turmoil and unsure of itself to recapture its pristine origins and its deepest roots. 67. Ibid., pp. 394-410. A typical example of the wise child motif in English literature of the period is the saga of Charles Bennett of Manchester, preserved in four separate literary accounts in 1679. Charles, who came from a simple English family, was alleged to speak Latin, Greek, and Hebrew at the age of three without having received any instruction. He was soon brought to London where he was tested by certain churchmen on various biblical subjects and in each of the languages he claimed to know. His audience was astounded by his correct responses. Finally, he asked to speak only three words to King Charles II and subsequently prophesied his own death nine days later. Despite their differing religious backgrounds and associations, the Gr6dek child and the Bennett lad were remarkably similar creatures. On Charles Bennett, see W. E. A. Axon, "The Wonderful Child," Chetham Miscellanies, n.s., I (Manchester, 1902). For other examples of wonderchildren in England during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, see the cases mentioned in Axon's introduction as well as that of the boy of Bilson who claimed to have the devil in him in 1622, discussed in Richard Hunter and Ida Macalpine, Three Hundred Years of Psychiatry 1533-1860 (London, 1963), pp. 100-1. 68. C. G. Jung and Ciroly Ker6nyi, Essays on A Science of Mythology, pp. 70-100. Com- pare Otto Rank's somewhat different psychoanalytic interpretation of the birth myth of the hero in his The Myth of the Birth of the Hero, pp. 65-96. For Rank, the mythmakers who fantasized about the extraordinary childhoods of their heroes were investing the latter with their own infantile history.</page><page sequence="21">A POLISH WUNDERKIND 163 The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in Jewish history represented an era of extreme cultural change, major upheaval, and physical disaster, in- cluding the deep-rooted effects of the Spanish expulsion, the oppressive measures of the Counter-Reformation in Italy, the Cossack pogroms in Poland, and the diffusion of Lurianic kabbalah eventually leading to the hysteria surrounding the messiahship of Shabbetai Zevi. Might one there- fore consider the bold suggestion that whatever else children such as the Jewish child of Gr6dek represented, they were in some way tangible mani- festations of a desire on the part of their beholders to return to a world less afflictive, more simple and placid? For who else but a young, virtuous, inno- cent and unscarred child of uncanny insight could undo the wrongs of a weary, tormented, and corrupt world? In the case of the Polish boy, his knack for identifying scriptural passages was perceived by his followers as only a prelude to a far more profound talent. He was empowered-so they thought-to solve the puzzling case of the missing Christian maid and thus to protect the Jewish community from the false accusations of its Christian neighbors. But even more significant, he was considered a creature with supernatural endowments capable of discerning the precise time Israel might be redeemed. The wonderchild from Gr6dek might have represented more than a curious prodigy of nature; he may have offered reassurance to a society in anxious search of miracles. And despite Delmedigo's futile at- tempts to publicize the deception, the authenticity of the Gr6dek child was thus assumed by a community in profound need of his marvelous and heal- ing presence.</page></plain_text>
