Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik, 2000. ix, 477 pp. (Hebrew). This work is an updated revision of Kalimi's Zur Geschichtsschreibung des Chronisten, published in 1995 in the BZAW series, which in turn is based on his Hebrew University dissertation. Kalimi begins by outlining his (mainstream) po- sitions on central questions concerning Chronicles, such as its date, unity, and genre: issues that are crucial before developing his thesis. The bulk of the book comprises nineteen chapters, each dealing with a particular literary or historical principle, such as harmonization, measure for measure, chiasm, inclusio, and use of literary patterning. A final chapter deals with inconsistencies of various sorts, and an "Afterward" discusses how the book has advanced scholarship on Chronicles. The material presented in the core nineteen chapters is often quite technical, but it is presented clearly and is easy to follow. It is not obvious why there should be nineteen rather than eighteen or twenty-one literary principles, but the cate- gories used as chapter headings by Kalimi are quite functional. Most of the ex- amples he offers are convincing, and after finishing this section, any reader would have a good sense of the range of techniques used by the Chronicler in revising earlier material. As might be expected, not all of the several hundred examples adduced are equally compelling. For example, I do not agree with Kalimi's claim (p. 96) that the Chronicler left out 2 Sam 7:14b, nawu rtx 'nn , i tnwax unwa r nn~n in~y-ra, because it reflected poorly on Solomon; Solomon is not punished either by staff or afflictions, and some other reason must be sought for why the Chronicler omits this half-verse from Samuel. Perhaps the Chronicler was more sympathetic to, or was influenced by, the type of Davidic promise narrated in Psalm 132, which like- wise lacks this punishment. (For additional possibilities, see Sara Japhet, I &amp; II Chronicles [OTL; Louisville, KY: Westminster/John Knox, 1993], p. 334.) Although the collection of examples is rich and valuable, I wish Kalimi had been broader in his perspective. This is true on several levels. He often notes cases where a device in Chronicles is found in later rabbinic literature or in Josephus (e.g., pp. 39, 77, 141). There is no systematic overview of this issue; it would have been valuable to note how Chronicles' rhetoric fits chronologically and typologically between the earlier historical writing and that found in the early post-biblical pe- riod and rabbinic writings. Such a discussion would have enriched the book great- ly, and would have been an important contribution to the history of early Jewish historiography. Similarly, insufficient attention is paid to continuity between the Chronicler and earlier biblical works. For example, the first chapter, which touches on chrono- logical rearrangement, would have benefited from David A. Glatt, Chronological Displacement in Biblical and Related Literatures (SBL Dissertation Series 139; 103</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1993), which even discusses some of the examples that Kalimi adduces. The discussion of measure for measure would have greater depth if the study of Patrick D. Miller, Sin and Judgment in the Prophets (Chico, CA: Scholars Press, 1982) were brought to bear. The chapter on names changed to equivalent names would have benefited had it been connected to Talmon's model of synonymous readings (Shemaryahu Talmon, "Synonymous Readings in the Textual Tradition of the OT," Scripta hierosolymitana 8 [1961]: 335-383). The re- sult of these deficiencies is that too often the book reads like a set of lists, lack- ing a broader perspective. Kalimi's final chapter, on contradictions and inconsistencies either retained by the Chronicler from his sources, or created by him, is typical of the gold mine of information collected in the volume. Yet here, too, I wish he had gone further, examining the implications of this material for imagining what the Chronicler's notions of consistency might have been, or even the extent to which we might ex- pect consistency in any ancient text such as the Bible. Similarly, Kalimi does not fit the specific categories he develops into a larg- er conceptual framework. What do they imply for our understanding of the Chron- icler as a historian? How do the literary and the historical urges fit together? In what sense are these changes literary, or are they best seen as rhetorical? Less de- tailed studies, such as Elias Bickerman's quick survey of the Chronicler in From Ezra to the Last of the Maccabees, address such crucial issues in a much broader and more engaging fashion. Additionally, although the book claims to be updated, relatively few works cited were written after the mid-1980s, when Kalimi's doctoral dissertation was completed. It is very surprising, for example, that Rodney K. Duke's The Persua- siveAppeal of the Chronicler. A RhetoricalAnalysis (JSOTSup 88; Sheffield, MA: Almond Press, 1990), which explicitly addresses the literary status of the Chron- icler, is never cited or discussed. Similarly, almost all of the essays in the impor- tant collection The Chronicler as Historian, ed. M. Patrick Graham et al. (JSOTSup 238; Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1997) are ignored, as is the two-volume Chronicles commentary by William Johnstone, published in the same year as Sara Japhet's magisterial Chronicles commentary of 1993. These works would have added depth to Kalimi's observations, and may have forced him to re-categorize some of the texts he did explore. Despite these structural and bibliographical deficiencies, The Book of Chron- icles: Historical Writing and Literary Devices is a very important book, one which enriches our understanding of the Chronicler and begins to systematize the meth- ods that he used. It is indispensable for anyone engaged in studying Chronicles, particularly for anyone interested in understanding in detail how the Chronicler worked with his sources. Marc Z.
