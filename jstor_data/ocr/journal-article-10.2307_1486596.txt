<plain_text><page sequence="1">Anita Norich. The Homeless Imagination in the Fiction of Israel Joshua Singer Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1991. xi, 142 pp. The appearance of this study is indeed cause for celebration, since so little is known about I. J. Singer, the older brother of Isaac Bashevis Singer, the famous 1979 Nobel Prize winner for literature. Anita Norich's book also could create interest in the life and writings of Esther Kreitman, a Singer sister, whose work only recently has been translated by Barbara Harshav. But the value of The Homeless Imagination lies not merely in what it might do for the authors in question, but in what it is, namely, a sophisticated piece of critical scholarship, a sorely needed examination of one of modem Yiddish literature's greatest, whose main misfortune was to be overshadowed by an immensely popular, though, in my opinion, less talented, brother. I. J. Singer's life began in 1893 near Lublin, but soon after, the family moved to a small town outside Warsaw, eventually ending up in the capital proper. His earliest stories appeared in 1918, during which time he pursued a parallel and successful career as a journalist in various parts of Poland and Russia. Abe Cahan, the highly influential editor of New York's Forverts, "discovered" Singer and offered him a job as reporter on Jewish life and culture in Eastern Europe. Indeed, in Norich's extensive bibliography we find a list of hundreds of articles on every possible subject, from economics to avant garde art. While Singer wrote numerous essays and short stories, he is best known in translation for his novels Yoshe Kalb (1932), The Brothers Ashkenazi (1936), and The Family Carnovsky (1943). He came to New York at least twice in his capacity as journalist, but also as the celebrated author of the first two novels,</page><page sequence="2">330 BOOK REVIEWS which Maurice Schwartz, the Joseph Papp of American Yiddish theater in the 1930s, translated to the stage. Events in Europe forced him to stay in New York. On February 10, 1944, he died there of a sudden heart attack at the age of fifty-one. In treating Singer's work, Anita Norich first "considers the varying contexts within which Singer wrote, the cultural history to which his texts refer" (p. x). In chapter 2 she examines "the function of place in his fiction. Singer sees no possible geographical or psychic locus for the Jewish imagination, and his characters remain uprooted in all of the locations they inhabit.... wandering and dislocation emerge as central themes in Singer's writing" (ibid.). The Brothers Ashkenazi and The Family Carnovsky are dealt with in chapter 3; Norich shows here how these novels reveal "the different dynamics of Jewish history ... independent of the linear axis along which the rest of Europe seems to progress" (ibid.). Chapter 4 looks at Singer's view of the individual and the self through an analysis of a lesser-known work, Comrade Nakhmen. The relationship between artistic creativity and social reality is the focus of Norich's next section. In the last part of the book she examines Singer's moving memoir, Of a World That Is No More, and the autobiographical writings of Esther Kreitman. In developing her thematic analysis, the author refers to narrative theoreti- cians-Lukacs, Mendilow, and Girard; scholars of autobiography in general and women's autobiography in particular-Eakin, Fleishman, and Olney; and critics of Yiddish literature-Trunk, Zeitlin, Niger, and Miron. While their various approaches are used to support a certain point or critical position, Norich manages to avoid overburdening her narrative with excessive, and often disruptive, theoretical discussion. A typical chapter opens with a brief introduction to the themes under consideration, follows with a concise and lucid theoretical statement, and ends with a textual analysis. Thus, in the section devoted to Carnovsky, she first places the work within the genre or context of family saga, a la Zola, Dickens, Flaubert, and Tolstoy, while emphasizing the unique problems facing Jewish writers wrestling with the idea of history, continuity, and family. Mendilow's seminal work on time in fictional narrative is used to explain the difference between chronological and fictional time, crucial concepts in understanding this particular novel. Regarding the first issue, Norich points to the various tensions, disjunctions, and ruptures in the personal Jewish family chronicle as it evolves within the larger European movement of time, culminating with the Holocaust. Expanding on the latter is important because the events described-three</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 331 generations of Carnovskys, focusing mainly on the first four decades of this century-are contemporaneous with Singer's life. The Carnovsky saga originates with David Carnovsky, who leaves his native Poland for Berlin because he wants to live in Mendelssohn's great city, among enlightened people, free of religious fanaticism and constraints. Though somehow he manages to be "a Jew at home and a man in the street," his son Georg is repeatedly reminded of who he is despite being a doctor, an officer in the German army, and the husband of a German gentile from a highly respected family. Georg's son Jegor is most waywardly in denying his heritage, for, while both David and Jegor pursue rather conventional routes to integrate into society, Jegor resorts to the extreme measure of actually joining the enemy, a Nazi youth group in New York, where the family seeks refuge from Berlin's "enlightened" Germans. As Norich correctly points out, the Carnovsky tragedy lies in each generation's "surpassing its predecessor in trying to accept the life of the larger world, and thus [finding] the inevitable return to Jewish fate increasingly difficult" (p. 52). Norich shows how language and sexuality express the tensions felt by these characters as they desperately attempt to enter a non-Jewish world that keeps rejecting them. This is a complex matter, and the author convincingly argues her position. I wonder, though, how much of this needs to be read as irony, mixed in with a great deal of the grotesque, a stylistic feature skillfully employed in Yoshe Kalb as well. These two elements dominated the works of many Central European Jewish writers at the time (mostly writing in German), and it would be interesting to know whether this is a case of literary influence or simply a cultural trait common to artists from that part of Europe. I am referring, of course, to Franz Werfel, Stefan Zweig, Josef Roth, and Franz Kafka. Perhaps in a future study the relationship between Singer and European authors, both Jewish and gentile, will be fully explored; I sense a strong kinship here, stronger even than that between Singer and other Yiddish writers. Naturally, if we view Singer as an essentially Central European author writing in Yiddish, this could discourage us from studying him in the context of Sholem Aleichem, Mendele, and Peretz-his great Yiddish precursors. Perhaps we could say that in the selection of themes, characters, and events, he is bound by Jewish history and a Yiddish literary heritage, but in his style, tone, and narrative strategy, he is basically European. Thus, alienation, homelessness, tension between the Jewish world and the surrounding gentile world, disjointedness between Jewish history and general history, are all</page><page sequence="4">332 BOOK REVIEWS typically Jewish themes, invariably treated by Jewish authors through the ages (with the possible exception of the Golden Age of Hebrew poetry in Spain). Clearly, a writer as complex as I. J. Singer cannot be dealt with in one book; Norich sets out to explore several major themes in his work, and she does so exceptionally well. More in-depth analysis of his fiction, with special attention to the surrounding Euopean literatures, is certainly a desideratum. Anyone studying Singer will certainly find a surprising amount of treasure; Norich's pioneering work provides some essential guidelines to understanding his oeuvre, his world, and his major conflicts. Who knows, with time we might remember "the other Singer" (meaning I. B.) as the Nobel Prize winner, and this one (meaning I. J.) as the author of great short stories and novels.
