This distinction holds that one can affirm a set of concepts without commitment to the underlying con- ceptions from which they are drawn. The focus here is upon substantial discrep- ancies between tannaitic and amoraic authorities in the presentation of the ha- lakhot of restitution of lost property. These discrepancies testify to a significant change in the underlying conceptual framework of tannaitic and amoraic halakhic thinking on this topic. Briefly, the primary axis about which the tannaitic treatment revolves is the obligation to come to the aid of one's fellow, making every effort to reverse a po- tentially deleterious situation. The amoraic position, on the other hand, focuses on the concept of rightful ownership, with its goal being the restitution of property to its legal owner. The paper proposes that in the laws of restitution of lost property, the amoraic rabbis understood full well the tannaitic concepts-using them and "playing" with them-yet without internalizing the tannaitic conception underly- ing their deliberations. 129</page></plain_text>
