<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS 119 Joseph P. Schultz and Lois Spatz. Sinai &amp; Olympus: A Comparative Study. Lanham, Md.: University Press of America, 1995. xxv, 790 pp. This big book somewhat lopsidedly compares "the myth and philosophy of archaic and classical Greece and the biblical-rabbinic legacy of classical Is- rael" (p. xv). Naming the civilizations after the mountains becomes awkward: thus in "On Olympus as on Sinai sacred space was carefully designated" (p. 402), the literal meaning reasserts itself as if the two mountains had sanctuaries. The bulk of the work consists of paired studies of "Sinai" and "Olympus" under ten chapter headings. Each has an introduction and a curiously brief section of "Conclusions and Comparisons," only once as much as ten pages. The rare French and German works cited all lack accents. This work is less (as billed) a comparative study than materials for one. The "Sinai" sections are, it seems, by Joseph Schultz (p. xv), "Olympus" by Lois Spatz. Only rarely does either include comparisons with the other culture. The lack of coordination already appears in the Comparative Chronology on facing pages, where the same events can be differently described and dated. (Abraham, Joseph, and Moses appear in the column "Important People," and "Dorian Invasion" and "Exodus" under "Major Events," as if claiming full historical character; a large 0 between B.C.E. and C.E. suggests to the uninformed that a year Zero existed.) The sections on "Olympus" are on the whole competently done. One could wish that the author had given us her own judgments rather than those of other scholars, and had ventured on translations of her own. There are occasional lapses. At p. 15 the Trojan War is cited as if historical. On p. 63 Spatz refers to "the etymological link between the old god Cronus and chronos, the Greek word for time." At p. 108 she misinterprets hyper moron "beyond their fate" (Odyssey 1.34) as "grief which exceeds the natural limits that separate humans from the deathless gods." (The old-fashioned will regret that throughout "human" and "quote" have become nouns, and at p. 56 the gerund "parenting" appears.) I do not know what "a conflation full of ellipsis" (p. 110) is. Mostly these long essays could be lifted out as an independent study of Greek civilization under the ten topics which the authors assigned each other. The sections on "Sinai" are somewhat less satisfactory, in part because of the very broad timespan that the author is assigned to cover. In the process the truly biblical materials suffer. Thus, "The clamor of new voices in the Bible never reached the pitch where a philosopher judged ritual sacrifice</page><page sequence="2">120 BOOK REVIEWS as sinful murder" (p. 32); but see Isa 66:3 (RSV), "He who slaughters an ox is like him who kills a man." At pp. 504-507 on the Pentateuch the four supposed sources J, E, P, and D are treated almost as if positively known, although later (p. 523, n. 6) the author's left hand takes away what his right hand has given. There are some highly speculative materials: at p. 135 Sodom and Gomorrah are annihilated "through what biblical scholars now think was an earthquake and conflagration"; at p. 656 with no apparent irony an author is cited as treating Ezekiel's vision as "the account of the actual landing of extraterrestrial beings reported by a painstaking, truthful and critical observer." (In an introductory section [pp. 607-608] there is reference, again without clear irony, to scientific explanations for "the catastrophe which swallowed up Atlantis and early Athens," including "pole shift.") The "Sinai" author is most at home with rabbinic and kabbalistic interpretations of biblical thought that were often new to this reviewer. But he fails to put the rabbis in their Babylonian, Roman, and Byzantine contexts, while the biblical context is truncated; thus no place has been found for the prophetic proclamation of justice, which makes a nice parallel to Hesiod Works and Days 213-292 on the justice of Zeus. Sinai and Olympus never quite answers a prior question: What kind of comparison is being proposed? Is it between two societies in touch with each other at one or more removes, via Phoenician trade or the like, so that actual historical connections should be sought? Or is it between two societies which, though in large part contemporary, went their own ways, so that only a general structural comparison can be carried out? That the comparison is historical is suggested by the words of the preface, "the distinct Hebrew and Greek currents in Western civilization . . . actually emerged from a common source: the polytheistic Mediterranean culture of the ancient Near East" (p. xiv). But if that were the authors' intention, they should have cited more "comparativists" (p. xvi) who lay out connections between Greece and the West Semitic world. The principal ones cited are M. L. West (in his commentaries on Hesiod and elsewhere), P. Walcot, Thorleif Boman (who appears as "Thorlief'), and R. K. Yerkes on sacrifice.

More often they come close but miss. In all the pages (37-58) devoted to the possible influence of Enuma Elish on Greek, they overlook the fact that Eudemus of Rhodes (4th cent. B.C.E.) preserves a close paraphrase of its first lines with all the divine names in place.7 Spatz does note the similarity between Theognis and the Proverbs of Solomon, but just says that "specific parallels are too numerous to list" (p. 290). She might have cited Theognis 697, "When I am faring well I have many friends" beside Prov 14:20 (cf. 19:4), "The friends of the rich man are many." Schultz (p. 357, n. 18) cites Roland de Vaux for the similarity between Greek and Hebrew forms of sacrifice; but he fails to note the linguistic parallel remarked by de Vaux there between Greek bomos "altar" and Hebrew bmh "high place."8 Perhaps, then, the real intention of the authors was to determine how far a structural parallelism between the two societies existed, divorced from any historical connection. Then the parallelism ought to have been laid out in the introductions, worked out in the essays, and summarized in the comparisons. But none such is prominent. The introductions rely more on Mircea Eliade 1. Walter Burkert, The Orientalizing Revolution, trans. M. E. Pinder and W.

Again the introduction to chapter 8 ("Public Life-Law and the State") is built entirely around the thought of Max Weber; the Sinai author on chapter 8 cites Weber regularly, the Olympus author and the conclusions not at all. If the authors were to proceed forward in a sequel from these copious materials to a substantial comparison, they would have two choices. If they intend an historical comparison of two societies indebted to each other at one or more removes, they should start from documented connections: comparable art-works, common vocabulary, narrative themes, historical contacts (certain or conjectural); and Hebrew texts should be cut off at the same point as Hellenic ones. If they intend a structural comparison, they should design an introductory protocol, partly on the basis of the materials already compiled, that both of them would find it easy to follow. The work should then explain why these two societies were chosen rather than others, define their unifying principles, and show in much more detail how far the working-out of those principles ran parallel.
