<plain_text><page sequence="1">Simon Schwartzfuchs. A Concise History of the Rabbinate. Oxford: Blackwell Publishers, 1993. xii, 179 pp. The author of this work would have been well advised to write a book on the origins and development of the rabbinate, and to leave it at that. In its coverage of origins and development, this book is very admirable. In fact, as I read and contemplated most of the book, I kept thinking that Simon Schwartzfuchs short-changes himself with his title because he actually provides much more valuable detail than A Concise History of the Rabbinate led me to expect. In most of the book, the author deftly provides a fascinating analysis of the origins and development of the rabbinate. Although there are those who would have us believe that contemporary ordination stems directly from thesenzikha of mishnaic times and, perhaps, even earlier, the reality is quite different. As Schwartzfuchs indicates, the original ordination ceased long before the destruction of the Second Temple, and for centuries afterward there was none. Nor was the role of the traditionally ordained analogous to the contemporary role of rabbi. The rabbinate as we know it emerged in Europe hundreds of years later, and it emerged because of communal needs. As the nature of the Jewish community underwent dramatic change with the advent of modernity, so too did the rabbinate, and Schwartzfuchs succinctly delineates the major patterns. The problems emerge when he attempts to cover the rabbinate in the</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 423 modern period in a few brief chapters. His treatment of the American rabbinate is dissatisfying because he limits himself to "The American Rabbinical Schools." Essentially, Schwartzfuchs summarizes the histories of Hebrew Union College, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, and the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary of Yeshiva University. He also includes a few lines about the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College. As good as these synopses are, however, they do not add up to a history, even a concise one, of the American rabbinate. If the late Marshall Sklare's pioneering study did nothing else, it taught that in Conservative Judaism there is a world of difference between the seminary and the synagogue. Although the differences may vary, the same is true in Reform and in Orthodoxy. In one of his chapters on the modern rabbinate, Schwartzfuchs makes a number of sweeping assertions and takes matters out of context, with the result that they lose their meaning. For example, he asserts that the modern rabbinate readily adapted to many of the aims of the Haskalah, such as not condemning science and suppressing exterior signs of difference between Jews and Gentiles. "They opposed," Schwartzfuchs continues, "the continued use of Jewish languages, and preached and wrote only in the national vernacular" (p. 125). Was this the way of the entire "modern rabbinate," of all graduates of the Hildesheimer Seminary? Were not many, if not most, of them not ideologically opposed to the continued use of Jewish languages but acquiescent to the linguistic demands of their congregants? Schwartzfuchs's portrait of the modem rabbinate continues: "They were basically supporters of a religion of rationality and were convinced that it was not antagonistic to revealed religion. In consequence, in a rare show of unity, they opposed Jewish mysticism and succeeded in eradicating all traces of Kabbalistic belief and learning" (ibid.). From the author's "concise history," one would never know that there was a popular Sabbatean movement and that the rabbinate undertook strong measures, discouraging mysticism being a major one, to prevent similar catastrophes. In the same vein and in order to preserve the leadership of the scholarly elite, Rabbi Elijah of Vilna was one of the most vociferous opponents of Hasidism. One would, however, hardly call the Gaon of Vilna a modernist. At least one other objectionable statement appears in the same chapter, in the discussion of women in the rabbinate. Schwartzfuchs naturally begins with the Reform movement, and discusses initial reactions to the newly ordained female rabbis. He asserts that "The Reform movement was faithful to itself in</page><page sequence="3">424 BOOK REVIEWS not hesitating to modify the Halakhah, which refused to recognize women in the public life of the synagogue" (p. 127). This is a basic misunderstanding of the very principles of Reform Judaism. Reform Judaism does not need to "modify the Halakhah," because it does not recognize the binding nature of Halakhah. Such modification is for Conservative Judaism to grapple with; it is simply not an issue for Reform. Despite these troublesome weaknesses, the book is a very good one. There is no other history of the rabbinate of the same breadth and depth. The author is fluent in many languages, which enables him to present primary documents and which gives him important insight into nuances in specific communities. We are thus treated to Schwartzfuchs's unexpurgated translation of one of the earliest rabbinic contracts, that of Man Todros (Theodoros), the rabbi of the German community of Friedberg (Hesse), in 1575, among a number of other gems. For highly informative background on one of the most significant roles in Jewish religious and communal life, Schwartzfuchs's book is, despite its weaknesses, a most valuable source. Chaim I.
