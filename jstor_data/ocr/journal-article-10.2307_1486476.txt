All the things their fathers dreamed of doing They do to each other, From behind a lot, like beasts in the field. And at midnight the bearded voyeur comes, He peeps through the shutters, He is, perhaps, one of the very last prophets Who collects material for his visions.1 "What do we have here?", asks Baruch Kurzweil, reacting angrily and with astonishment to the section of Yehuda Amichai's story "The Bar Mitzvah Celebration" ("Hagigat bar mitzvah") where the poet, as he does in the above poem, "The Voyeur" ("Hamatsitz"), associates expressions, motifs, and concepts taken from the area of religion and holy texts with sexual motifs more appropriate to erotic or pornographic literature. "A strange phenomenon," adds Kurzweil, This article is a revised version of a paper presented at the Tenth World Congress of Jewish Studies, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, August 16-24, 1989. 1.

If something similar had been written by a gentile we would be complaining about wicked antisemitism. But among the many Amichai poems which have been published in recent years in various forums, we have also frequently come across this same self-indulgent licentiousness.2 This serious charge, alleging that the writings of a Jewish poet were in some manner antisemitic, appeared in an article by Kurzweil published in Davar in 1961 to mark the appearance of Yehuda Amichai's first book of short stories, Baru'ah hanora'ah hazot ("In This Terrible Wind"). Although the comments refer to a piece of prose, as the critic himself notes, they could just as well have been directed to many of Amichai's poems, and certainly to a poem like the one quoted above in which the sight of a couple copulating takes the place of the vision of the divine which the prophet is about to describe in his revelations. It is not surprising, therefore, that Kurzweil continues on to talk about the collapse of verities and values, "both traditional-religious and secular," in Yehuda Amichai's poems and stories. Kurzweil explains that he is not defending these values and that his criticism does not emerge from a religious view of the world. Quite the contrary, he takes the trouble to emphasize his respect for "the masculine, atheistic revolt in the name of the new humanism which characterizes the work of Albert Camus" and for "the intellectual profundity of the atheism" that characterizes Musil. "What kind of man does not respect the antireligious view if its source is honesty?" he asks decisively, removing all all suspicion of any orthodox dogma.' Thus it seems that Kurzweil's antagonism to Amichai's writing derives not from the actual expression of a lack of faith (to which, he claims, it is "legitimate to give appropriate expression") but from what he considers to be an offense against good taste and the "absence of any sense of what is acceptable from a cultural-aesthetic point of view." As an example of this he presents an excerpt from the story "The Class Reunion" ("Pegishat Kita") in which the narrator describes how the Old City of Jerusalem looks to him from the window of a lavatory. "The perspective of the Old City of Jerusalem from the lavato3ry is Amichai's poetic innovation," Kurzweil writes with heartfelt sarcasm (the emphasis is in the original). "What is achieved by 2.

Is this a matter of modernism or pointless graphomania . .. in which obscenity is presented as poetry" and in which, "when all the extremes have been used up and there is nothing left to tell, the sex is what remains" as the only saving fixture.4 Kurzweil's comments are not only the opinions of an important authority who, perhaps more than any other, fashioned the critical canon of the period. They are a faithful expression of the feelings of the readers, both believers and nonbelievers, to whom Amichai's writing is addressed. These "implied readers" are familiar with the source material, cherish the holy language, and, therefore, are likely to respond with sensitivity to the transformation which this language undergoes when it is used in a desecrating or degrading context (what Kurzweil ironically calls "the association of different spheres"). An attitude very similar to Kurzweil's is expressed, for example, by Shalom Kremer, who several years later accused Amichai of "going beyond the limits of good taste" in his comments about the "death of God," which, unlike Nietszche's, were not elements of a highly philosophical outlook, but were expressed on the simplistic level of ordinary folks "announcing that there is no love in the world."' Thus it is not the relentless discussion of theological questions or the caustic, Job-like remonstration against heaven, familiar from the poetry of the previous generation's tradition-rich poets (such as Bialik or U. Z. Greenberg),6 that arouses opposition to Amichai (or at least the feeling of "an offense to good taste"), it is the association of "different spheres" in which the sublime and the vulgar, the holy and the profane, discordantly conjoin. 4. Ibid., pp. 226-227. 5. Mozna 'im, 1969, p. 278. 6. For the ambivalent perception of God in Bialik and U. Z. Greenberg, see Baruch Kurzweil, Bialik vetchernichovski: mnehkarim beshiratamn [Bialik and Techernichovski: studies in their poetry] (Tel Aviv: Schocken, 1960). Kurzweil's claim in regard to Greenberg's poetry that "divinity has not been reduced to the level of relativity and atrophy even in the cruelest poetry of loss and protest" (p. 46) certainly suits Bialik, Steinberg, Shlonsky, and many other poets of the period of the revival of Hebrew culture. Moshe Steiner clearly makes this point in his "Merida be'elohim o ma'avak le'emuna bashira ha'ivrit" [The revolt against God; or, the struggle for faith in Hebrew poetry], Ha'umah 17 (1979): 375-385, in which he notes the profound respect and deep faith that were characteristic of the pioneers of modern Hebrew poetry, even in their most extreme complaints to heaven (Y. L. Gordon and Tchernichovski) and their harshest declarations of the death of God (Shne'or and U. Z. Greenberg).</page><page sequence="4">102 YOSEPH MILMAN The same combination of polarized spheres is especially obvious in the iconoclastic imagery which is the focus of the present study and which I wish to relate to from several points of view: as a poetic pattern which characterizes Yehuda Amichai's poetry; as "content-form" which contains a special philosophical-religious outlook; and as a rhetorical device through which the ideational message is conveyed upon the level of emotional experience, and which then provokes a powerful reaction (such as Kurzweil's and Kremer's) in the (implied) reader familiar with tradition to whom Amichai's poetry is addressed. As surprising as it may seem, the subject of Yehuda Amichai's general attitude to Judaism, and in particular the iconoclastic imagery which abounds in his poetry, has not been thoroughly discussed by critics. Both subjects are mentioned here and there in articles dealing with his work in general or in articles devoted to individual poems (for example, in the many interpretations given to the poem "O Lord Full of Mercy" ["El male rahamim"]).7 Except, however, for occasional articles specifically devoted to the concept of God in his work (Barzel, Arpali, Abramson), it seems that criticism in general has only coincidentally and quite superficially touched upon what can be considered to be one of the most unique, complex, and significant aspects of Amichai's poetic universe. Mention, however, is made in the early criticism of the abundance of allusions drawn from the Bible and sacred writings which fill Amichai's poetry. In contrast to those who see his use of holy texts as alien and who thus see him as "a gleaner in foreign fields" (Zemah, Katznelson, and others), most critics recognize, at least in regard to the scope of the traditional materials he uses, that Yehuda Amichai is one of the most outstanding of Israel's post-independence poets. This opinion is held, for example, by Kurzweil, who notes the "importance of the liturgy, the prayer book, and the mahzor [High Holy Days prayer book] in Amichai's poetry";8 by B. Y. Mikhali, who declares that "the pipelines of his creativity are connected to Jewish sources";9 and by Ya'akov Bahat, who devotes a whole article to a typological classification of "Jewish sources and their recollection in Yehuda Amichai's 7. Such as Naomi Sokoloff's detailed study, "On Amichai's El male rahaminm," Prooftexts 4 (1984): 127-140, in which she presents a sophisticated analysis which connnects Amichai's sharply satirical attack upon the vocabulary of religion to the general modernist loss of faith in the power of language to signify. 8.

The common opinion, then and now, is that "in most cases where Amichai uses liturgical material it is only a question of artistic play," of "acrobatics" backed up by "empty prattle," as Kurzweil says," or of "derisive play" built upon "the utilization of biblical names and concepts to needs which have nothing to do with the spirit of the Bible," as Katznelson claims.)2 Thus "the linking of the sacred and the secular" in Amichai's poetry is not generally endowed with any special significance and is perceived, even in cases where it appears in a clear "theological" context, as a part of what Zemah terms "the joining of the dissimilar to the dissimilar." In Amichai, according to Zemah, the coalescence of far-removed elements, which, for the imagists, represented the revelation of "a daring which purifies the soul of poetry with its extremity," degenerated into "pseudo-intellectual inventiveness, whose sharp wit contains nothing more than strangeness, remoteness and fallacy." And these inventions, Zemah maintains, are "hollow devices of fiction and empty sophistication," jocularity and amusement, containing nothing of authentic poetry and characterized by "some sort of contemptuousness and blasphemy."" Amichai's joining of remote semantic fields is also seen as a meaningless and pointless associative game by Katznelson, who ten years later again states that the words in Amichai's poetry "do not follow the facts but, quite the contrary, force the facts to be dragged into a game which is the invention of the words."'4 Similarly, Shimon Sandbank, who belongs to a generation of critics much closer to Amichai's poetry, states (from a basically quite positive standpoint) that the first definition that comes to mind when he thinks of Amichai is that he is a "playful poet," playing with the objects of the world "like colorful blocks which can be brought closer and removed farther away as one wishes," and word play which is marked by pure, "verbal inspiration." Sandbank adds that when the game is "coupled with hard seriousness (as, for example, when it touches upon matters of faith)" it might even "jar the ear, 10.

In a recent article discussing the rhetoric of the conceit in Amichai and the similarities between him and the metaphysical poets of the seventeenth century (especially John Donne),'8 David Fishelov, for instance, arrives at the somewhat one-sided conclusion that in Amichai's poetry, in contrast to what happens in Donne's, "the high religious terms are usually parodied and devaluated," and serve "as a source of playful insinuations" which sometimes turn into bitter irony.'9 Ultimately most critics see Amichai as a clearly atheistic poet and the prayers in his poetry as "expressing apostasy more than anything else," or even as "'lacking a divine presence."20 There is no concept of God in his poetry, they claim, except as "a literary device and a rhetorical goal,"' and 15.

But he is satisfied with drawing our attention to the stylistic resemblance and does not go into the more substantial significance which might be suggested by such similarity (he finds Amichai's conceits to be rather "poor" compared to Donne's). 19. David Fishelov, "Yehuda Amichai: A Modern Metaphysical Poet," Orbis Litterarunt 47 (1992): 188. To my mind, the reduction of Amichai's conceit to a game or satire misses the element of deep ideas which it bears in his poetry. The conceit expresses Amichai's unique conception of "correspondences" (in poems with general existential messages like "Tahazit" ["Forecast"] and "Sonet habinyanim" ["The Sonnet of Verbal Voices," for instance]), as well as being a unique means of expressing a paradoxical view of the world or an inversion of values (as in theological poems like those discussed below). 20.

Such a view can be found in Kavkov when he writes that the "I don't believe" of Amichai provides irrefutable evidence of his struggle to believe,"2 or in Hillel Barzel, who declares that one should not see the mentioning of a God in whom the poet no longer believes as a "sterile stratagem" but as an expression of an authentic profound experience which is astonishing in its self-contradiction.24 A similar view is expressed by Glenda Abramson, who explains that "by building secular structures on sacred foundations Amichai does not reject the original but debates with it";2 and in Chana Kronfeld's statement about Zach and Amichai in which she claims that they "cannot help but identify themselves as evolving out of the same tradition that they so consistently fight."26 In its relationship to Judaism, however, Amichai's poetry is unique in at least three ways. The most important, often noted by critics, is the frequency with which theological problems appear in his poetry either as main subjects or central motifs-as, for example, in many well-known poems which probe the nature of providence ("God Pities the Kindergarten Children," "God's Hand in the World," "O Lord Full of Mercy") or question the relationship between the believer and his God (like "Three Commentaries," analyzed above). Amichai, as Glenda Abramson justifiably notes, is "unique among contemporary Israeli poets in his presentation of God as one of the central themes of his poetry."27 The second aspect is the great variety and wealth of the Jewish sources that furnish both subjects and metaphors. Amichai's motifs come, inter alia, from the Bible and the commentaries, from liturgical poems and other prayers, 22.

Here poems like "Samson," "The End of Days, in a Way," "My Father on Passover," "Hanuka," "A Song for the Fifteenth of Shvat," "And This Is Thy Glory," "Caesarea," and "If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem"-as well as the titles of his poems-speak for themselves. If one were to cull the lines and poems connected with Judaism from Amichai's poetry, and then classify them by subject, the result would be a tome containing a new type of "responsa" (she'elot uteshuvot). Here we have an agnostic rabbi so familiar with religious matters that there is hardly anything of importance in Jewish sacred literature that he does not discuss, either directly or obliquely.28 The third and most distinctive aspect (possibly the most significant one) is the religious element present at all levels of existence, even the most mundane and the most prosaic. It is in evidence, too, in the most intimate of subjects ("What Pushed Joseph" or "Patriotic Thoughts," for example), or in the most carnal of themes (as in "Jacob and the Angel"). True, this mixture of the sacred and the profane leads to harsh, provocative ironies, but the depth of Amichai's relationship to the Jewish heritage manifests itself in the very fact and language of his rejection of it. The poem "Three Commentaries" ("Shelosha perushim"), mentioned above, which presents itself as an interpretation or elaboration of the biblical verse "Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram" (Gen. 17:5), sharply delineates the author's dual relationship with God and the Jewish heritage in general. I Abram who was once Abraham And returned the 'h' to his God Proudly, as a man decorated Returns the medal to his king.29 It is important to note that the God Amichai is referring to in the metaphorical scene presented here (like the image of God in general in his poetry) is no 28. See ibid., pp. 13-18, for Amichai's Jewish background and close knowledge of Jewish religious matters. In an interview with Eyal Megged, Amichai himself stated: "I came from a very religious household, and when I wrote about prayers, for example, it wasn't because I wanted to find roots, but because it was my natural childhood" (YediotAharonor, Nov. 8, 1985). 29.

He is not the exalted, fictitious notion apostrophized by truly secular modem Israeli poets like Ayin Hillel and Chaim Guri-"God as a literary fiction," as Eli Schweid called it in his perceptive article "Invoking God in Modern Hebrew Literature." Similarly, God in Amichai is not a mere verbal entity with no real existence, symbolically representing a distorted world order that the writer deplores, or the perfect order that he desires, as Boaz Arpali argued in Haprahim veha 'agartal.30 Nor is Amichai's God the abstract universal providence, a recondite entity to which one can address the longings of one's heart, prayers, or thanksgiving, as in Amir Gilboa, Tuvia Rivner, Nathan Zach, and others. He is much more authentically the One God of the Jewish religion, the God of the Bible and the other sacred texts of Judaism, the highest expression of religious and national faith, commandments and ethos. When the poet imagines the biblical Abraham, the father of faith, tearing the divine letter, the 'h' sign of the Covenant (which in Hebrew represents the Divine Name itself), from his name (Gen. 17:5), this is to be understood as the sharpest of protests. It comes from one whose faith and virtue once knew no bounds, and who now arises and cuts himself off from a whole world of values and commandments in whose justice and morality he no longer believes. But Amichai carefully selects his metaphor. His lyric "I" returns the medal to the King, to express his relationship both to God and Judaism. But this is no denial of God's existence. On the contrary, the metaphor expresses the recognition of the existence and power of the One to whom protest is addressed. Perhaps the protester still believes that this power rules his own heart and consciousness. Indeed, this is the act of one who believes his protest to be both meaningful and heard. In the same book there is a deeply introspective poem in which the poet discusses his "Meeting with an Old Friend" ("Pegisha 'im yadid vatik"). He is old and ill Already marked, ready to confess Under prolonged torture that there is no God As I, under torture, would be ready to confess That God does exist.31 30.

Amichai, Velo 'al-menat lizkor; p. 103.</page><page sequence="10">108 YOSEPH MILMAN The abstract philosophical question of God's existence here becomes a personal one that guides individual destiny, mandating a decision that is both imperative and impossible. In this poem a clear analogy exists between the first-person lyric speaker and the friend that casts doubt on the possibility of separating them. The friend seems to be the alter ego of the poet, who appears in the end as a split personality, torn and tortured between belief and apostasy, and unable to decide. Significantly, in the two poems previously mentioned, which deal with the speaker's relationship to the Divinity, the imagery is of first importance. The poem "Three Commentaries" revolves around the image of a military headquarters where, amid pomp and ceremony, war heroes are decorated. Yet the poet-speaker sees himself as one who cannot accept a decoration awarded for faith and not for heroism, and he returns it. The gift is obviously from God himself, and there is even an ironic hint at one of the titles of the God of Israel: Lord of Hosts. Hence the metaphorical situation underscores the criticism put forth by the content, causing it to be much more provocative and blunt than it would otherwise have been as a direct discursive expression of the crisis of faith. Something similar happens in "Meeting with an Old Friend." Two situations are placed in apposition, each having equal emphasis (or an absence of emphasis) that indicates equality between them. In the one a person withstands torture in a desperate attempt not to deny God (suggesting the exalted tradition of the Sanctification of the Name, or martyrdom), and in the other, a person undergoes prolonged torture but refuses to falsely declare that God exists. In both cases, the writer states, the victim willingly renounces his innermost beliefs under torture. This too, besides striking at the hallowed and heroic myth, shows the equal value the writer gives to both situations. Thus he achieves both a sarcastic degradation of the traditional Jewish martyrdom which sanctifies God's name and an ironic exaltation of the "sanctification of denying God's name," presented here as an alternative secular belief, or a faith of another kind, which is no less worthy. "What courage a man needs to become an unbeliever when he is near death!" Amichai marvels in one of his later books."2 The implication that the representatives or priests of belief extract false confessions under torture intensifies irreverence to the verge of blasphemy. "Not the one finger of God, 32.

And curse the three Great Religions Which won't let me sleep at night What with bells and howls of muezzins and loud shofars and noisy atonements. Oh God, close your houses, let the world rest. Why hast thou not forsaken me?34 The irreverent challenge, "Why hast thou not forsaken me?", becomes stronger because it is the sarcastic opposite of the believer's plea in Jewish and Christian scriptures alike ("My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" Matt. 27:26; "Forsake me not, O Lord" Ps. 38:21). In "The Fate of God" ("Goral elohim"), too, a work that has aroused much critical interest, it is the sharp metaphoric language more than the idea expressed that blasphemes. The fate of God Is now the fate Of trees and stones, sun and moon, That they stopped worshipping When they began to believe in Him. But He must remain with us At least as trees, as stones As sun, moon and stars.35 33.

It no less arises out of the echo of the curse from Deuteronomy-"And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see nor hear" (Deut. 4:28). The author has chosen the very words that most clearly represent the abominations, "wood and stone," to compare them with the service of the living God. The juxtaposition of these to the Divine Name is in itself an insult to heaven and contemptuous of sacred things-even if there is no actual heresy in the writer's explicit statements. However, the end of the poem reestablishes what the poet undermines at the beginning. True, the second verse employs the same metaphors, the mention of which next to the name of God is blatantly blasphemous; but this time, by separating the words, the allusion to false gods is repressed. The concepts-trees, stones, sun, moon, stars-stand on their own, jointly and separately, in their full, vital, existential meaning of growth, stability, light, love, and holiness, as different aspects of the one and only God, who includes them all, and for whom the lyric speaker finally longs for to the very depths of his soul. And it is somewhat ironic that in the last verse, the star motif, an authentic symbol of idol worship, contributes a faint note of reconciliation, hope, and pure prayer to the conclusion of the poem. The same semantic materials that enabled the poet to build his sharply iconoclastic imagery and to cry out against heaven thus ultimately become the foundation for suggestive metaphor through which he implicitly draws in an enclave, the image he longs for: an omnipresent living God, who has no peer and whose glory fills the world. Amichai again calls on this God, particularly in his last books, in rare moments of weakness or grace. He does so in desire and pain, directly and without guile, forgetting to don the shield of estrangement, paradox, and irony, as in "I Am in Big Trouble" ("Ani betzara gedola"): And of the synagogue of my childhood Only the sky remains That I saw through my window Oh God, I am in trouble.36 36. Me'adam ata, p. 27.</page><page sequence="13">SACRILEGIOUS IMAGERY IN YEHUDA AMICHAI'S POETRY 111 Or in the poem "God My Isolation" ("Elohim habidud"): Layers are breaking in my soul Ceilings fall into my love Give me fossils-not memories! God, my isolation is over My death is revealed.37 Obviously, this concept of God is not the concept of divinity which the poet-speaker wishes to remove by tearing out the letter in his name that symbolizes the Covenant. Nor is it the concept he tries to avoid recognizing even under torture. Yehuda Amichai's confrontation with God in every poem individually, and in his poetry as a whole, can be seen as a selection from the entire vocabulary of the conflicting attributes of God that appears in Jewish sources. These he implicitly places opposite one another in polarized and violent argument. Such a hidden argument, frequently expressed more strongly in metaphor than at the level of explicit statement, reflects more than any other element the poet's dual relationship with God and religion. And it is no coincidence that the same field of imagery serves the poet to undermine one concept of holiness, while establishing the other. Although up to now we have only discussed poems of belief and dis- belief-noting the very fine line that separates them-Yehuda Amichai's relationship with religious tradition is not confined to poems concerned directly with belief or Jewish experience. It appears in all his works, whether depictions of concrete situations, pure lyrics (autobiographic reminiscences, poems of mood, love poetry), or poems on general issues (war, protest, or philosophical questions). In poems not specifically related to faith, religious elements seem to be present mainly as metaphors. Nonetheless, they provide evidence that sacred Jewish concepts and values filter through into all existential situations and, for better or for worse, into all life's great and small concerns. One typical example should suffice to show how this applies to poems remote from the religious sphere discussed so far. The poem "We Did It" ("'Assinu et ze"), as its street-language title suggests, is about an erotic encounter between lovers, and depicts situations rarely met outside obscene literature. 37.

But this is true only if we speak of transposing these pictures into reality, without relating to the language. Apart from the title, however, with its vulgar associations and echoes, which are repeated with gusto, the poem is written in highly suggestive language rich in biblical allusions that increasingly crowd the poem as one reads on. Even in the lines quoted above, the juxtaposition of light and darkness, water, grass, beasts, man and God, connects physical love, in its varied forms, with the story of the Creation in Genesis, and endows the sensuous situations portrayed there with something of the majesty of the biblical text. Although the poet continues to give his imagination free rein in describing the erotic, in the final part of the poem he also broadens and sharpens the allusions suggestive of holiness. ... We did it Like wheels and holy creatures And with chariot-feats of prophets. We did it six wings And six legs But the heavens Were hard above us Like the earth of summer beneath.39 38.

Ibid.</page><page sequence="15">SACRILEGIOUS IMAGERY IN YEHUDA AMICHAI'S POETRY 113 Blasphemy reaches its height toward the end of the poem, where the language portraying the lovers' positions is taken from especially sacred portions of the Prophets, visions in which the Almighty reveals himself. The first is from Isaiah: "Above it stood the seraphim: each one had six wings . . And one cried to the other and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Hosts: the whole world is full of his glory" (Isa. 6:2-3). This text, sacred in itself, became even more so when it was introduced into the blessings pronounced before reciting "Hear O Israel." Here, as in the poem, wheels and holy beasts are mentioned. This passage is also included in the Kedushah ("Sanctification") prayer, which pious Jews utter daily with deep devotion. The second passage alluded to is from the vision of the wheel within a wheel (Ezek. 1), which is of special importance in Jewish occult philosophy as a vision pregnant with secrets, offering possibilities of access to the mystery of divinity and the celestial spheres. The encounter between the daring eroticism and the two most sacred experiences in Jewish religion and mysticism is appalling to believers, for it derides religion and the world of the religious Jew. Nonetheless, the alienation shown in bringing the extremes of holiness and defilement together, though harshly dissonant, has a dual effect here, as in other poems by Amichai. The metaphor that juxtaposes the exalted and the debased not only violates what is sacred but also consecrates the profane. The elevated metaphorical language serves to raise what is earthly to a higher, more spiritual plane. The prophetic revelation imparts holiness to the earthly love-making of man and woman, which is simultaneously evoked as an act of creation and linked to Ezekiel's "wheel within a wheel," thus manifesting God's presence in the world. The very act of love becomes an encounter between the believer and his God, a way to worship through desire in line with the familiar Hasidic concepts of worship through corporeality and knowing God through love (to know in the biblical sense, or as Buber explains the term, to touch). Stripped of its literary trappings, this view of God and of the relation- ship between God and his worshippers is not alien to Judaism. It is nourished by sources and spiritual currents that have always been there from the time of the Bible and the ancient texts (a case in point is the discussion of the sages regarding the allegorical meaning of the Song of Songs as the relationship between the Almighty and Israel, which is also represented by analogy in the Prophets). And it continues through Jewish mystical speculations and their manifestation in Hasidism (the concepts of</page><page sequence="16">114 YOSEPH MILMAN the holiness of sin and of corporeal worship, mentioned above, for example) down to modern Jewish philosophy (Franz Rozenzweig, Martin Buber, and others). Yehuda Amichai's iconoclastic imagery, then, does not take the form of an entirely negative pattern, designed to undermine the foundations of faith. True, Amichai extends to the limit the gulf between the sacred and the profane, between defilement and purity, all within the confines of a single poem. He gives a radical Jewish expression to the principles of tension, complexity, and dissonance that characterize modern poetry. This might dismay those who are sensitive about the profanation of sacred sources and contempt for ancient traditional commandments. But even when he appears to be attacking the highest of values, Yehuda Amichai intends to shake hallowed concepts that have grown rigid, and to test them by confronting them with the true values that they no longer embody. "God!", he declares in "A Way of Life" ("Orah hayim"), one of his later poems: ... we asked you to divide for us Right from wrong And you divided the waters above the firmament From the waters below it. We asked for knowledge of good and evil And you gave us laws like rules for football Dos and dont's, reward and punishment.40 Amichai's use of concepts and metaphors from sacred sources to undermine and replace these very concepts is to be understood as an act which is, at one and the same time, deconstructive-reconstructive. What Buber calls "disintegrative" activity seems most appropriate to describe the "subversion" of Yehuda Amichai. It strives to unmask a false image of God that conceals the true one, to attack a fossilized tradition and undermine the authoritarian 40. Me'adam ara, p. 68. The image which suggests the parallel between religious injunctions and the rules of football is repeated in Amichai's interview with Yotam Hare'uveni in Yedi'ot aharonot (Oct. 17, 1985), where it is given a clear explanation: "What is religion? It's like a game of football. Twenty-two men and the spectators decide that they will not touch the ball or go offside. It's amusing. After ninety minutes you're allowed to touch the ball and stand in an offside position and everything. Imagine if football players controlled the world and imposed their rules. What a bore. . . . I detest intolerance. The destruction of religion will only come out of the religious establishment."</page><page sequence="17">SACRILEGIOUS IMAGERY IN YEHUDA AMICHAI'S POETRY 115 ideology it supports. In building within negation, the purpose is to raise an edifice on the ruins, to revive values suppressed and dimmed, and to set up a new, ideal model for a religion which will not be confused with the religious establishment, but will be no less rooted in the sources and no less faithful to the essence of Judaism. Speaking of his father's house in an interview with Yotam Hare'uveni, Amichai said: I grew up in a religious home. ... I naturally take all those treasures with me now. I would advise any child who wants to be a poet to grow up in a very religious home, or a communist one, with a religion that fills the parents' entire being. Afterwards you fight against it, but the treasures remain.41 Hence it cannot be said that the purpose of Amichai's iconoclastic imagery is to deny God and religion. On the contrary, it reflects the course of a poet who has lost his faith but tongs, deep in his heart, to continue the dialogue with God-however sharp, bitter, or violent his language. Most critics, as noted in the first part of this article, emphasize the systematic desecration in Yehuda Amichai's poetry. Surprisingly, or perhaps not, Hillel Barzel, himself a believer, observed "the bond that connects rejection and acceptance," which characterizes the poet's turbulent world, pointing to the piety embedded in Amichai's poetry. "Such a personal bond can develop only in a poet who has God in his heart," Hillel Barzel says.42 Indeed, only a close personal bond can produce the irreverent yet touching metaphor which both degrades tefillin to the level of something to tread under foot-and sanctifies the sandals that the poet-speaker himself walks on: "The sandals are the reins of my racing feet / And tefillin thongs for a tired foot, in prayer."41 One may therefore conclude that Amichai's iconoclastic imagery is not really a sign of alienation, a challenge to authority, and a provoking impudence, as many of his critics maintain. Even, and perhaps especially, at its most extreme, it is a deeply embedded, fundamental structure, both poetic and spiritual, in the poet's writing. The contrast between the sacred and the profane pervades both the texture and the structure of his work; and it leads to yet another binary confrontation, between two sacred concepts, which even 41.

This is not technique for its own sake, or even a way of conveying meaning, but a form-meaning (as a linked, hyphenated concept). It is a sense and view of the world expressed in speech and idiom, designed to protest against the rigid and authoritarian language from out of which such speech grew, and which it now challenges-not by destroying it but, on the contrary, by reviving and continuing it. In an interview with Nili Sadan, Amichai made the following instructive remarks: Continuity is the language. While the same language goes on being written, there is continuity. Even literature that goes against the current, that wants to innovate and to judge, is continuity. Continuity that imitates isn't truthful. True continuity is dialectic. Every Israeli Jewish poet or author is the continuity of Jewish culture.44 It is clear that the language referred to here is the language of tradition, which Amichai uses for his writing, no less than the spoken vernacular. Otherwise he would not be talking about "going against the current," "judgment," and dialectical continuity. This reminds us of the obvious fact (to which many of Amichai's critics have not given sufficient attention) that in poetry no less than the mass communications media, the message is in "the medium" more than anything else; and that Amichai's deep rootedness in Jewish tradition expresses itself in the omnipresence of traditional elements even when he challenges that tradition. Yehuda Amichai's quarrel with his religious heritage is, then, a tragic lover's quarrel. As he attacks the concept of God by using language and metaphor that traditionally sanctify Him, so he worships Him in a sense, through that same language. And when he flings harsh words at what is holy-or, rather, against what he feels to be an archaic image of God which should no longer be worshipped-he continues "to hearken to the voice by whatever name it is called," carrying on the exalted dialogue which Buber sees as the essence and foundation of true religiousness.45 It is significant that Amichai's later books have a softer, more conciliatory tone, and it is not mere chance that Amichai entitled his most recent book Gam ha'egrof haya pa 'am yad petuha ve'etzba'ot ("The Fist Was Also Once 44.

In Sefer Ha'aggada, a selection of legends from the Talmud and the Midrash edited by Bialik and Ravnitsky, there is a legend attributed to Rabbi Meir which says: "When a man comes into this world his hands are clenched. This means: the world is mine entirely and I possess it. When he leaves this world his hands are spread open. This means: I retain nothing of this world."46 In the legend the demanding clenched fist appears close to the com- mencement of man's way in the world, while the open hand, which, perhaps, expresses disappointment but also a degree of surrender and resignation, connects up with man's ripeness. In the stanza which ends "Hulikat-Dicky's Third Poem" ("Hu- likat-hashir hashelishi lediki"), from which Amichai took the name for his book, the order of things is reversed. The clenched fist links up with a later stage in man's life, perhaps when he makes his final reckoning before quitting this world, while the open hand connects up with the primary stage and the feeling of freshness and hope that experience and the lessons of life have not yet destroyed. Recollect and recall to the fallen fruit The leaves and the branch, Recall to the callous thorns That in spring they were soft and green And neither forget that the fist Was also once an open hand and fingers.47 Amichai's poetry, however, is not really in opposition to the spirit of the legend. The poet-spokesman who, out of his present dry, hard, and close-fisted experience, insists upon remembering and recalling a long-gone situation and time when the hand was open with outstretched fingers, does not simply express rebelliousness and disappointment; he also expresses yearning for a forgotten era of openness and hope, which itself is evidence of the fact that the era has left traces which have not been completely erased. "Hulikat-Dicky's Third Poem" does not revolve around matters of faith, but its soft tone and conciliatory spirit suggest some sort of return, even if it is ambivalent and uncertain, and a feeling of belonging despite everything which 46.

Samuel Beris.</page><page sequence="20">118 YOSEPH MILMAN one recognizes from poems or parts of poems much more directly connected with clear issues of faith and religion. An example of this can be found in the pathos of the lines from Me'adam ata ve'el adam tashuv which give us a hint of the winding path within Judaism, so fraught with contradictions, that leads Yehuda Amichai from the disintegration of all world-unifying beliefs to a return to common prayer and acknowledgment which, perhaps, contain a moment of reunification or, at least, the desire for it. And all the crumbling things All becoming one again Like the "one" that loudly reverberates At the end of "Hear O Israel."48 In "The Jews," one of the last poems in Gain ha'egrof the poet-spokesman emphasizes the deeply rooted bond to the collective national-religious memory as something which defines Jewish identity even in cases in which the Jew has cut himself off from that memory. A Jew remembers the Succah in his grandfather's home. For him the Sukkah remembers The walking in the desert which remembers The blessing of youth and the stone tables of the covenant And the gold of the golden calf and the thirst and hunger Which remember Egypt.49 The question "And what about God?" repeats itself over and over as a persistent chorus. The answer given to this question emphasizes the power of the presence of the memory of God in the Jewish soul even after faith has left. And what about God? God remains likes the fragrance of a beautiful woman who once passed them by and whose face they never saw. But her fragrance lingered, varied fragrances, 0 creator of varied fragrances.50 48. "North of Be'er Sheva," Me'adam ata, p. 66. The Shema prayer, from which this verse is taken, continues: "The Lord our God, the Lord is one." 49. Gain ha'egrof p. 136. Trans. Samuel Beris. 50. Ibid., pp. 135-136.</page><page sequence="21">SACRILEGIOUS IMAGERY IN YEHUDA AMICHAI'S POETRY 119 The lines suggest that the apostasy of a Jew is not, and cannot be, just any apostasy, but is a peculiarly Jewish form of apostasy in which the fragrance of faith still lingers. At the end of the poem the lyric "I" again raises the essential question of God's presence as an insistent question. And in the last response which ends the poem, the same egalitarian equation between faith and apostasy that we found in "Meeting with an Old Friend" again appears. This time, however, it is presented in a soft tone which seems to request intimacy rather than distance. Obvious here, in a much more clear-cut fashion, is the fact that for Amichai Jewish secularity and even specifically Jewish atheism are not, when all is said and done, a severance from tradition and a rejection of God. And what about God? Once we sang "There is no God like ours." Now we sing "There is no God of ours." But we sing, we still sing.5' The essence of Jewishness in this poem is not the belief in the existence of God but the unbroken link which connects both religious and nonreligious Jew to the wellsprings of Jewish tradition. The structural balance of the declarations "There is no God like ours" and "There is no God of ours" blurs the difference between them and cancels the distance separating the believing Jew from the nonbelieving Jew. Emphasis is placed upon the continuity which finds its expression in the singing of the prayer which bursts forth from the two of them and, essentially, in the need for a God who continues to be the object of this prayer, even when he is referred to as "no God." Both the presence and the absence of God are simultaneously expressed in the word shelanu ("our") which is incorporated into the word Ehohenu and used in two contrasting ways: once to affirm God's presence (ein ke'elohenu-"There is no God like ours") and once to reject God's presence (ein elohenu--"there is no God of ours"), which by referring to God as "ours" seems to paradoxically recognize his existence. It is important to note that this kind of acknowledgment of the presence of a God in whom nobody believes any longer can certainly not be regarded as a sort of "repentance and return to faith" (hazara beteshuva). "Water cannot repent and return to its source," writes Amichai in another poem in the same 51. Ibid., p. 137.</page><page sequence="22">120 YOSEPH MILMAN book. "To whence will it return? To the tap, to the source, to the earth, to the roots / to the cloud, to the sea, into my mouth?""52 Ultimately, "The Jews" expresses apostasy no less vigorously than does either the bitter, sarcastic complaint that characterizes Amichai in poems like "O God Full of Mercy" and "God Pities the Kindergarten Children" or the blunt neo-Nietzschian statements which announce the death of God and the kingdom of nothingness that replaces him in poems like "The First Days in New York" and "The Travels of the Last Benjamin of Tudela." And "The Jews" is no less rebellious than poems which call for the deposing of God and the deification of man in his place, like "Thus Will I Be Magnified and Sanctified" or "And This Is Your Praise." Paradoxically, because of their more moderate and balanced tone and their greater awareness of the complexity of the poet's relationship to belief and tradition, "The Jews" and several of Amichai's later poems demonstrate the depth and irreversibility of Amichai's apostasy, as well as how decisive his rejection of Jewish faith is when this faith adopts the form of a system of sacred values which have lost contact with the living present ("The thing most lost is that which is returned after being lost," Amichai writes in one of his quatrains).53 Together with this, lines like those that end "The Jews," in which the poet makes a painful reckoning with his heritage, also demonstrate the profound connection linking Amichai to a Judaism perceived as a living spiritual and cultural heritage. They show the extent to which the religious spirit (or the spirit of "pure faith" as Martin Buber termed it) is embedded in Amichai's, when the poet, sharply challenging some basic law of Judaism, simultaneously expresses his adherence to a no less essential element of Jewish faith-an element which might have been embedded in this same law before it was laid down in an authoritarian book of laws, and when it was still connected to primal sources of life with which the poet has a need to reconnect.
