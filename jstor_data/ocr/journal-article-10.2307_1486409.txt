<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANGLO-JEWRY AND THE JEWISH INTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC IN PROSTITUTION, 1885-1914 by LLOYD P. GARTNER Our tale opens in some little town in the Pale of Settlement between the 1880s and World War I. A well-spoken, well-dressed young man appears and courts an attractive girl of a family belonging to the great majority of the Jewish townspeople-that is, impoverished and burdened with many children. The unknown suitor offers charm and gifts, and speaks knowingly of the great places he has seen and where he has a good business-Paris, Johannesburg, London, or New York.

GARTNER want to stay long enough in town to marry publicly, since he might be seized for military conscription. The girl, excited by the prospect, implores her parents to give their consent to this proposal. She feels she loves this young man. With him, the bleak life and dismal future in the town will be exchanged at a stroke for happiness and prosperity in a great, distant city. Every month a few young townspeople were leaving, mainly for America. Already there were many more marriageable girls in town than there were young men for them. How could such a chance be thrown aside? Might it ever recur? If the girl wondered why of all the numerous poor girls in town she was enjoying these attentions, she would answer in her own mind by complimenting herself on her prettiness. Her parents, or her surviving parent or step-parents, gave their consent. If they were reluctant or had doubts, they had only to reflect on what they could do for the girl's future that was more promising. Now there would be one less at home to feed and worry about, and, once gone, she would learn, like everyone else, to look out for herself. Off went the girl with her young man, oblivious of the skep- tical glances of some neighbors. She realized they were only envious, while warnings of rabbis could readily be disregarded as the cant of stodgy gray- beards. The voyage was exhilarating, even in steerage. Attractively clad, the girl noticed how attentively her young man behaved toward her. She appreciat- ed his protective attitude against the characters that they were likely to meet, especially those from meddlesome Jewish organizations who appeared on board as soon as the ship docked and asked prying questions of one about the other. As cousins traveling together-the girl sensibly said what he had suggested she say-they got past the Jewish meddlers at the dock in Ham- burg and then in London. She felt a twinge of uneasiness at the obvious suspicion and hostility shown to her betrothed. Experiences flew so fast, however, that there was no time to reflect on them. In London, they went to eat in an East End restaurant, where the proprietor knew the young man and displayed marked cordiality to the girl. Then the couple went to a flat belonging to the young man's sister-or was it his friend or cousin? Here the Cinderella story stops. Now a fetid reality comes to the surface. The young man took this trip several times yearly with different girls and, of course, had intentions which were anything but romantic or honorable. He was in fact the first link in a chain of women and men who cooperated in an international traffic in prostitution, known universally as the white slave</page><page sequence="3">ANGLO-JEWRY AND TRAFFIC IN PROSTITUTION 131 trade.' His interest in the poor, attractive girl from the Pale of Settlement lay only in her commercial value for the prostitute's career she was to follow, whether willingly or not. After a day or two in the London flat, she might consent to his advances, and, if not, she might be raped by him and his accomplices. This abuse went on until, in their tested judgment, she was despairing and demoralized enough to go on the streets. If she had relations with him willingly, after a few days she was told there was no more money and that she had to go to "work" on the streets. However, it hardly was profitable to come from Eastern Europe only as far as London. London Jewish girls could be, and were, recruited as prosti- tutes. Commercially speaking, it was better to keep up the romantic pre- tenses as far as the final destination, which was usually Argentina. A demoralized victim might also go out of shame and utter dependence. Once the long voyage from Liverpool or Southampton ended in Buenos Aires, the girl was persuaded or forced to submit in case she had not done so earlier. She was sold to a brothel for ?75 or ? 100 or more, and we may imagine how the purchase price was settled. Constantinople, Bombay, Alexandria, and Rio de Janeiro were other destinations at various times, but Buenos Aires was long the main terminal for Jewish prostitutes. Jewish girls, it was report- ed, were the most in demand and fetched the highest prices from the mer- chants of prostitution overseas.2 Prostitution in the East European Setting This, in essence, was the Jewish white slave traffic. Its source of supply was mainly East European Jewry, which was multiplying at a tremendous rate throughout the nineteenth century while sinking deeper into poverty all the time. Russia, Poland, Rumania, and Galicia had about 1,250,000 Jews in 1800 and 6,200,000 in 1900. Economic opportunities lagged far behind the needs of the new, young population, just over 50 percent of whom had not attained their twentieth birthday when they were enumerated in the 1.

The Jewish population increase was most pro- nounced in cities, especially in such vast new urban Jewish communities as Warsaw, Lodz, Odessa, and Bialystok where the combined number of Jews, about 15,000 in 1800, reached 505,000 in 1900. Some venerable Jewish com- munities also multiplied, such as Vilna, which went from 5,700 in 1800 to 64,000 around 1900. These great population increases entailed not only a massive demo- graphic shift, but also extensive social dislocation. Young men and women left their small towns and moved to large cities, whether in quest of educa- tion or employment, or increased breadth and variety of life. Living apart from their families was a state of affairs which traditional Jewish society hardly contemplated and viewed with disfavor, especially as concerned women. The lot of the single girl in the city was harder than the man's, since her employment possibilities were very limited, hours very long, and pay very low. Nor did these working girls have any suitable place to spend their little free time; no clubs or educational facilities existed for them in Galicia3 nor elsewhere, probably, in Eastern Europe. Traditional Jewish society, with all its communal inventiveness, was still unprepared for such a social group and uncomprehending of its needs. Many a lonely, overworked, underpaid working girl could find her only pleasure and release in sensual gratification. The same might be said of many young men, working as hard as the girls and also lacking family. Their plight often meant that social and sexual norms fell by the wayside. They were portrayed movingly by A. M. Borokhov (Brukhov; later Berekhyahu, 1869-1946), an ex-rabbi turned publicist and living in Berne. He wrote of ... a seamstress or factory worker, an employee in someone's home or store, who loved someone of her own class. On one of the many evenings when after twelve hours' work she sat with her beloved in her room, they poured forth the bitterness of their weary hearts. A feeling of compassion toward one another grew stronger. As compassion toward one another overcame them, so did the feeling of love, which is so much like it. These feelings within them increased in power, as the pair suddenly realized that they were alone in the great world, that no one noticed them or troubled about them ... Their sense of isolation in life drew them close to each other, and they began to dream of the happy 3.

Dreaming led them to a warm intimacy of heart, and this led, as it usually does, to intimacy of body. .. .4 Still, from sexual lapses to sexual promiscuity there was a large step, and thence to prostitution was still a greater one. The transition from occasional or part-time prostitution to employment in commercially organized sexual vice meant a further step. Each of these phases existed in East European Jewry before the close of the nineteenth century. Trafficking in prostitution was treated in that great, unsparing realist Mendele Mokher Seforim's novel In the Vale of Tears (Be-'emeq ha-bakha) and in its Yiddish version, The Wishing Ring (Dos Vintshfingerl). Written during the 1880s, this work was set during the 1840s and 1850s. By the turn of the twentieth century, a demi- monde of brothels owned by Jews and inhabited by Jewish prostitutes existed in Warsaw and Lodz.5 Vilna's Jewish prostitutes, said to be numer- ous, were allegedly drawn from the small towns of Lithuania.6 The existence of brothels owned by Jews and inhabited by Jewish prostitutes is also attested for Brody, Lemberg, Tarnopol, Cracow, and Czernowitz, and they were no doubt to be found elsewhere. A report published in London tells of twenty-six Jews convicted in Lemberg in 1892 for procuring girls who were to be sold in Alexandria and points east. Sixty had been rescued a year ear- lier in Constantinople by the Austrian consul.7 Nevertheless, as late as 1912 the established Jewish communal leadership both in Brody and Tarnopol denied that the traffic existed in their cities although "everyone knew," in 4.

There was no attempt at robbery, everything was completely destroyed." Fifty Jewish brothels were wrecked, and only afterwards did non- Jews join in the rioting (E. B. St. Claire to Ch.

GARTNER the words of Bertha Pappenheim (1859-1936), the German Jewish social worker and feminist, that it did exist.8 Contemporary Yiddish plays of the realistic theater, including Peretz Hirschbein's Miriam of 1905 and Sholem Asch's Got fun nekome (1912) created a stir with their theme of prostitution. Both plays treated the Jewish traffic in prostitution in terms which make clear that the audience was well aware of its existence. Popular awareness is also demonstrated by the large, varied vocabulary and numerous sayings about prostitution.9 Miriam, originally written in Hebrew, was Hirschbein's first dramatic work, and it virtually stages articles written by "A.", discussed below, and Borokhov. Miriam is a lovable, innocent orphan from a village who comes to a "large Lithuanian city"-obviously Vilna-to work in a cellar hosiery workshop. She meets Zilberman, a wealthy, handsome young man and, heedless of her fellow workers' warning, goes with him. She becomes pregnant by Zilber- man, who abandons her. About to give birth, Miriam staggers back to the workshop, where her old friends aid her. The play ends with Miriam as an ill-treated inmate of a brothel, her baby boy cared for by a nurse, visiting remorsefully with a Jewish and a Christian fellow prostitute. All of the themes are present in Hirschbein's play: class distinction between the man and the girl, the disgrace of illegitimate childbearing, the tragic descent into prostitution. Bertha Pappenheim concluded that "the root of the evil [was] misery, with its consequent social debasement of habits, customs, and thought." What was happening in Eastern Europe could happen in East London, she added, because the roots of immorality lay in a "housing problem, a wage problem, an education and upbringing problem."10 She and her associates of the Jiidischer Frauenbund argued that there were elements of the traditional 8.

Hasidim, they emphasized, placed women in "a very, very subordinate position," and their education was sorely neglected. In East European Jewry generally, female literacy was a good deal lower than that of males. Thus, of the 712 unaccompanied girl immigrants who arrived in London in 1907, 65 percent were "totally illiter- ate or could write only a little Yiddish. . . ."" Dazzled by their new life in large towns, girls even from pious families might turn to prostitution, it was contended, since they were untaught in their own individuality and worth.12 Pursuing the point, Pappenheim reported that she repeatedly heard from local physicians of "a shockingly large number of girls and women of 'better families' " who were untroubled by poverty and were outwardly pious, yet carried on furtively as prostitutes.'3 The German Jewish visitor knew of girls who undertook prostitution for amusement, and then, "often depending on external circumstances," made the trade their full-time occupation. Some parents indifferently permitted their daughters to dress up in order to promenade unescorted in the streets, a practice only slightly less reprehensible in terms of traditional norms.'4 Pappenheim insisted not only on a causal nexus between poverty and prosti- tution, but on a far more contentious link between prostitution and the social and religious subordination of women, particularly in Hasidic life. Few would endorse Bertha Pappenheim's views in full. Such a critique of the upbringing and status of women within the traditional community implied a still wider critique, which could not be undertaken by those who desired the collaboration of East European rabbis. Yet the social dislocations described here, and the diminishing hold of traditional life, found these rabbis baffled and disturbed and able to do little. By no means was the recruitment of prostitutes confined to East Euro- pean Ashkenazic Jewry. Pappenheim reported graphically on the extensive recruitment of young Jewish girls in such cities as Salonika, Philippopolis, Adrianople, Belgrade, and elsewhere in Balkan Europe, for brothels operat- ed by Jews in those cities and elsewhere, especially Constantinople. Recruit- ment was in fact more brazen and less furtive than in Eastern Europe.'5 11. JAPG&amp;W, Report, 1907, p. 14. 12. Sidonie Werner, "Zur Sittlichkeitsfrage," in Referate gehalten auf dem 2.

GARTNER It was demographic realities and social and cultural demoralization which brought about the prostitution problem. Demography with its eco- nomic consequences led to mass migration. Thus, prostitution and migra- tion were linked. The statistical basis for this threefold connection of demography, migra- tion and prostitution may be found in the Russian census of 1897. Here, a bulge in one age cohort invites particular attention. The number of male and female children under ten years of age is about equal, but in the next cohort, however, that from ten to twenty years of age, there is a great difference: 646,000 females to 563,000 males, about a 53:47 ratio (in fact, near 54:46), establishing a most unusual disproportion of 113 females to 100 males. Yet in the next older age cohort, that from 20 to 30 years of age, the ratio almost evens itself, with 429,000 females to 414,000 males, a normal 51:49 ratio, or slightly under 104 females to 100 males. Girls were obviously innocent of statistics, but no doubt they noticed how many likely bridegrooms were going away, especially from small towns. By no means did all the young men go abroad; many remained in Russia and were enumerated in large cities. The sex ratio of the 10-20 age cohort in the small places must therefore have been even more lopsided than 53:47. How many girls followed men overseas as wives or fianc6es may be inferred from the evening out in the 20-29 age cohort.16 The girl who persuaded her family to permit her to emigrate in the company of the attractive young man was seeking her future by joining the great tide of young people, first men and then women, who were moving westward. She believed she was going under fortunate circumstances. Available evidence also shows that comparatively few girls and un- married young women emigrated alone. Between 1900 and 1913 inclusive, 375,985 steerage passengers, the vast majority of them Jews, disembarked at the port of London from ships which came from the Continent. Among them were no more than 11,668 unaccompanied females, constituting 3.10 percent of the total, of whom around 10 percent were Christians. During the six years preceding 1897, the proportion of unaccompanied girls and women was in fact somewhat higher: 1,827 out of 40,941 passengers at London, equivalent to 4.46 percent.17 Of the total number of unaccompanied Jewish 16.

Since the age at mar- riage of Russian Jewish women was ascending sharply in the decades before the census, from below 21 before 1881 to 23.0 in 1892-1896, there is also no surprise that the fragmentary information on this point shows that a mere 6.86 percent of the girls under 20 were married when they landed in Lon- don.'8 Of course, girls no less than boys emigrated with parents or some other mature relative. But among young people emigrating alone, there were many times more unaccompanied males from the 10-20 age cohort on the emigrant ships than there were females. For Jewish emigration as a whole to the United States before 1914, the male preponderance was on the order of 56:44. Following World War I the preponderance was reversed, as masses of wives rejoined their husbands after years of separation on account of the war. The view that men going alone emigrated overseas at a younger age than did single or unaccompanied women is therefore well founded. Few young women went alone, most going either as children, or years later as wives and mothers. The numbers recorded in the port of London alone were large enough to influence substantially the census figures in Russia-not to men- tion the port of New York, where no reason is apparent for supposing that the proportions were any different, if the figures existed.19 Thus, young women, far more than young men, stayed behind in Russia and were counted in 1897. Somewhat later they followed the men, but in Russian Jewry itself there was in the meantime a definite shortage of marriageable young men. This imbalance was bound to aggravate existing sexual and marital problems within East European Jewry which social and cultural change had created. A comprehensive view of sexual and marital problems, which pressed extreme conclusions, was presented by "A.", who wrote in the Cracow Hebrew weekly Ha-Dor in 1901. He declared that, notwithstanding literary suggestions to the contrary, Jewish women were chaste before and during random fashion from 6.86% to 16.66%; the average is 9.82%. In the first two years available, 1887-1888 and 1896-1897, there are 432 unaccompanied females, of whom 61 (14.1%) were Christians. However, the proportion of unaccompanied Jewish girls and women to the total number of immigrants is quite stable, dipping no lower than 2.25% in 1912 and climbing no higher than 3.72% in 1903. 18. 52 out of 929 in 1906, and 61 out of 712 in 1907. 19.

GARTNER marriage. However, the men were often libertine, especially those of the upper class and many from the middle class who traveled extensively on business and were seldom at home. "A." alleged regretfully that a double standard applied. The men's offenses were taken lightly, while those of women were judged severely. Married women, he found, tend to flirtatious- ness, but "A." was forgiving: "A Jewish woman false to her husband is an extraordinarily rare occurrence among all our groupings and classes. Only among the obscurantist Hasidim who marry off their 'educated' daughters against their wishes, to men not to their taste-only within this group does it happen that there are 'forbidden relations,' and there too it happens very seldom." The furtive married prostitutes reported by Bertha Pappenheim may have been the same type of woman as "A." knew of, but she found them less rare. "A." argued that educated young women who were accus- tomed to mixed company and moved assuredly within it, maintained their moral purity better than "the daughters of obscurantist parents, brought up like captives, who are never permitted any association with the opposite sex-[it is] they [who] are ready to stumble and succumb, who are about to fall into the hands of any man chancing to meet them furtively." Denied experience of life, such girls conjured up a realm of sexual fantasy to take its place and, unable to cope with realities, were easily seduced.20 But then, the anonymous writer declared, proletarian girls in large cities had become the major exception to Jewish female chastity, and as he would have it, this was largely because of salacious Yiddish literature and the amorous adventur- ousness of upper-class young men. These poor and socially ambitious girls could attract upper-class bridegrooms only by generosity with their sexual favors. Like Hirschbein's Miriam, the girl would merely be exploited and then jilted, most often when she became pregnant. Then, "she must descend into the camp of the 'fallen.' Yes, she must." The informative but highly opinionated article condemned to banishment from decent society every girl who strayed. "The one who goes to a house of shame can no longer damage us, while the offender in our midst can cause harm to her friends' chastity." In order to preserve Jewish moral standards, condemnation had to be ir- revocable, "A." insisted. True, promiscuous men merited as severe a sen- tence as women, "but what can we do, for men alone make the social and religious laws!" Relentless as "A." was against these supposed prostitutes by choice, he was dismayed at "clean and innocent daughters of Israel sold into shame by the deceitful methods of criminal Jews." He alleged that most 20. Pappenheim and Rabinowitsch, Zur Lage, pp. 21-22.</page><page sequence="11">ANGLO-JEWRY AND TRAFFIC IN PROSTITUTION 139 Jews were tolerant of these traffickers, regarding them as men who pursued one branch of commerce which was hardly different from others. Nothing was being done against the traffic; for example, "the masses still follow the advice of their rabbis," and the rabbis were failing to speak vigorously against the evil. "One way or another, the 'trade' is flourishing, and no one lifts a finger to save the daughters of Israel! Yet we swell with pride over our chastity!"21 This astonishing discussion contains a good deal of information and awareness of prevailing sexual relations, which is combined with pro- nounced class prejudice. By the standards he professed, "A." was peculiarly tolerant of middle-class sexual foibles. He regretfully accepted the double standard of sexual morality, by which he largely released men from moral culpability for their misconduct. "A."'s last-ditch defense of sexual morals is strangely selective. It was only upon the frail shoulders of a proletarian Jewish girl, whose hopes and ambitions led to her betrayal by an upper class man, that "A." laid the entire weight of moral responsibility, and he pressed it down harder by the denial that any path to self-correction or forgiveness existed. If such a wayward proletarian girl really represented voluntary prostitution, then the stringent line which "A." drew between the willing prostitute and the involuntary was dubious indeed. Moreover, Jewish public opinion took a more stringent view of traffickers than "A." alleged. There were numerous public warnings against doubtful bridegrooms, and soon after "A."'s article a conference on white slavery was held in Lemberg in 1903 which East European rabbis attended. The brothel keeper in Sholem Asch's play of 1912, God of Retribution, was not permitted to seat him- self in the synagogue or receive any synagogue honors. When as his first step back to decency he commissions the writing of a Torah scroll, no one will enter his house to celebrate its completion. If the Jews would not collaborate with the police force to root out Jewish prostitution, as they were indeed doing in New York City at exactly that time,22 decent Jewish society 21.

"A."'s strictures in Cracow upon Jewish sexual morals in Vilna irritated Ha-MeliS, as did his attack on the morals of Yiddish actors and on "a certain type" of supposedly immoral Yiddish literature.23 Also replying to "A.", A. M. Borokhov objected that it was impossible to expect universal self-restraint in matters of sex. "A." had suggested sexual practices were changing, but then took his stand on one limited issue only, for which he reserved harsh condemnation. Borokhov, in rebuttal, rewrote sympathetically the sad tale of the jilted proletarian girl (quoted above) and proceeded to argue for a revised sexual morality. Girls stray from the path "in every group where it is not customary to marry them off as soon as they reach maturity and whose members retain a spark of life in their breast." Persons whose passions do not kindle should not make boast of the virtue of continence, commendable as that is. "Innocence and chastity" are possible only within a proper family life, and Borokhov there- fore reached the novel conclusion that "whatever a person does with the intention of living a peaceful, loving family life can not be deemed promis- cuity." The proletarian girl who carries on relations with her upper class beloved commits "transgression and sin . .. but not by any means 'promis- cuity' contrary to religious command, nor from the moral viewpoint is she 'falling....' A society which requires for its existence that such girls be thrust into houses of prostitution bears within itself its own poison and rot- tenness. Better for it not to exist."24 This debate ranged far beyond the discussion of a significant social prob- lem. "A.", lenient toward middle class but not proletarian sexuality, took his stand on the sternest interpretation of female chastity, while Borokhov in reply espoused a limited version of a love ethic: a man and woman who seriously meant to become permanently linked could not be morally wrong for having sexual relations. The issues raised by both writers, if familiar and perennial in Western secular society, were not all so in East European Jewry, where halakhah still set the standards for sexual and marital relations. Pre- ferring the claims of true love to the requirements of law was heady stuff. The rival contentions also bear importantly upon the difference between 23. Ha-MeliS, July 11 (24), 1901.

Perhaps the clearest summary of the problem comes from a distant but well-informed source. The Jewish Association for the Protection of Girls and Women, in London, possessed lengthy and intensive experience of the persons involved in the prostitution traffic. Several thousand cases which came to their notice led them to definite conclusions: In Russia, Rumania and Galicia the conditions under which the Jews are largely forced to live is a direct incentive to the White Slave Traffic. Girls are only too glad to escape from the weariness and grinding poverty of homes where they are often not allowed to learn a trade. Their parents, seeing seem- ingly eligible young men come to their villages eagerly give their daughters to them in marriage or entrust them to their care in order to have 'excellent situ- ations' found for them abroad. ... .25 Many written warnings and no doubt oral reports circulated, but nevertheless quite a few of the girls who left home with men were willing, at least at the outset, to enter upon the prostitute's career. Unhappy at home, they were eager to enjoy what appeared from afar to be a life of material and sensual pleasure in the glitter of a great city: Unfortunately, there are also girls who leave their homes knowing that they lead impure lives. But these too are victims. They are told of the attractive side of the life and it is only when they have reached their destinations that they realise the horror of their position and the absolute control over them, morally and physically, acquired by the dealers in human beings. .. .26 A balanced judgment is presented a few years later: Girls from Galicia, Rumania, etc. coming mostly from villages, do not suddenly make up their minds to go to Buenos Aires or Rio to earn a liveli- hood, and at once become women of bad character. It is only under the direc- tion or compulsion of somebody who has obtained an enormous influence over them that they do.27 25. JAPG&amp;W, Report, 1908, p. 19. 26.

GARTNER Traffickers at Work The traffic in actual and potential prostitutes constituted a minuscule part of the vast westward movement of East European Jewry. The traf- fickers' work was made easier by this tide of migration, since it was so com- mon to leave in search of opportunities abroad. The Warsaw Hebrew daily Ha-Sefirah received letters from villages which told of well-dressed, mar- riageable young men who appeared there and took away local girls as their brides. The dangers of the practice were becoming widely known: We recently read a story about many "eligibles," an entire transport of "eligi- ble young men," who came from overseas to the port of Odessa, and spread all over the country, to all the benighted little towns. We can well imagine that before long all these "bridegrooms" will return with their very beautiful "brides" to board ships bound for Constantinople, Buenos Aires, and wherever.... Not a sound, not a word-the story is over.28 Actually, it was "known to the police of various countries that men travel to and fro between Europe and America, going through the [mar- riage] ceremony twice or even three times a year, in order to secure vic- tims."29 The Jewish organizations were aware of these techniques, and recognized that the "cunning" of the traffickers was "most extraordinary." They know the laws directed against them and their evil work quite as well as those who make the laws. They often possess considerable wealth and there- fore do not mind spending money in order to obtain a successful result.... Their agents work unceasingly in the towns and villages of Russia, Rumania, Galicia, and other countries. One of their favorite methods is to lure the girls by posing as well-to-do young men in search of a wife. Their smart appear- ance and persuasive manners soon gain the confidence of their intended victim and even of the girls' parents. ... She consents to marry. The men are general- ly too cunning to go through a proper legal and religious ceremony, though bigamy is a light matter with them, but they get the parties concerned to agree to some secret marriage. Any certificate or papers that may have been used are worthless, and for greater security, they are usually soon destroyed by the men. Another method these wicked men adopt is to hold out dazzling 28. Ha-Sefirah, February 5 (18), 1904. 29.

Or, when they have got their vic- tims far away from their homes, under pretence of finding their relatives or friends, they inveigle them into houses of ill fame and so degrade and ill-treat them that they are afraid, even if they could do so, to tell their story to any- body, fearing that, being in a strange land, not knowing the language, and without friends, they would not be believed.30 As early as 1890, a notice went to the Jewish press on the Continent, "warning young girls from leaving their homes by the advice of strangers or under the care of strangers.""' The evil had increased by 1898, to judge from the pained announcement by eight prominent West European rabbis that year. Addressing their East European colleagues, they too urged them to warn families against the danger of unknown young men seeking to marry local girls only to make prostitutes of them. "Remove this dreadful disgrace from upon us," they implored.32 Bertha Pappenheim claimed that "much of the vice ... is due to the laxity with which marriages are some- times conducted and divorces granted among the Jews in Eastern Europe, including Galicia."33 False bridegrooms to lure girls into leaving home were the means employed by the two Jewish men and the mistress of one of them, who were sentenced in Piotrkow in 1902 for activities which had come to light three years earlier. The "bridegrooms" had claimed they had to leave Russian soil before the wedding, in order to avoid seizure for conscription. Girls from Bendin and Sosnowiec were enticed into the prostitution traffic, once their "fianc6s" crossed the border with them into Galicia at Czernowitz. The girls were passed along on some excuse to other confederates, and they in turn inveigled the girls into boarding British ships. Because they knew no Eng- lish, the victims reportedly felt unable to report any suspicions they might by then have felt. Less innocent girls were tempted with fine clothing and pro- 30.

The three miscreants' sentence of thirty days was increased by a higher tribunal to one year, and the two men were deported to a Siberian penal colony to serve their time.34 At the border railway station of Podwolocyska, where twenty broad- gauge Russian trains arrived daily, girls were often tricked into missing their connecting narrow-gauge Austrian train. They could then be plied by traf- fickers, who might lure them across the border by night train to the town of Maximow, and thence to Tarnopol.35 These border operators were reported to be impoverished individuals, for whom dealing in women was part of their general smuggling activities. A suggestion was even presented to com- pensate these men for ceasing their activities and find honest work for them, but it was promptly rejected.36 Emigrant travel was particularly difficult for unaccompanied women, or those with little children. Suffering from natural physical limitations or frightened by travel, they had to cope with baggage and attend to their children. Parents, and husbands who had emigrated earlier and were now sending for their families, were warned of the dangers. In recent years there has been a great deal of emigration by young women. Most of them are practically girls, sixteen and seventeen years of age, who, in order to calm somewhat their disturbance at traveling, try to attach themselves to some impressive man who will look after them. Usually they happen upon a young man who is also en route to America, and who promises to watch over them attentively. Sometimes the girls are taken in by cheats, and follow them like docile lambs.37 Even mothers traveling with young children were not exempt from molestation and seduction. A young married woman was on her way to England with her three chil- dren, to join her husband. On her journey from Galicia she fell in with a woman who was a notorious trafficker, and who introduced her to a man who was also alleged to be traveling to England. At Hamburg he sent two of the children forward to England by boat and induced the woman to remain 34. Ha-MeliS, July 1 (14), 1902. 35.

He said he had decided to go to Buenos Aires, and under promises of letting her husband know and getting him to join them, he made ready for the journey.38 The promise was of course not kept, and the traces of the acquiescent woman were lost.39 However, it was more common and probably easier to take in an unmarried girl and her family: [A girl] was living with an aged mother at the house of a sister, when a "Shadchan" (Marriage Broker) called and said he had a young man for her. As everything appeared satisfactory to them, the engagement took place. About a week afterwards the young man said he had received an important letter from a friend who was leaving London for America, and he induced the girl to go to London with him, where she stayed at the house of his sister. After a few days he said that the departure had been delayed for a week, and sug- gested that, as they had nothing to wait for, they should get married by "Stille Chupe" [furtive marriage]. She refused this as she wanted to be properly mar- ried in Synagogue. He then told her that he was going to see his friend off from Liverpool and she consented to accompany him. Whilst they were on the boat, it started off, and she became very much afraid. She, however, could speak no English, and was told the boat was going to London first and that it would be all right. She soon, however, found this was a falsehood, but feared to say anything. The man had sent a postcard to her relatives from London, saying they would soon return. She was taken to Buenos Aires. ... 40 By bravery and obstinacy she avoided the prostitute's career which was to be forced upon her and succeeded in escaping and being returned to Russia. In a similar case, however, the girl was lost: ... She had been brought to London by a trafficker. ... He intended tak- ing her to another country. .... The man had gone to the Russian village and stated that he was a wealthy merchant and that he wanted a wife. The girl was introduced and the marriage took place. No proper enquiries as to the man's character appear to have been made. All went well for a little while, the hus- band making only short absences from home, until one day he proposed a journey to London, and gave an address of a friend where they would be stay- 38.

GARTNER ing ... the address given was that of a man who was in league with many traf- fickers and who conducted some of their negotiations. He was severely ques- tioned, but said the couple only stopped with him two days, and then left for America without giving an address. Further enquiries proved that the husband was a well-known trafficker who passed under various names. .. .41 Contemporaries felt uncertain about how much to blame the girls drawn into prostitution, either to work the trade in their native land or to emigrate for that purpose. However, the men were despised and execrated. The daughters of Israel are chaste and modest, but their innocence is their undoing. Most of those entrapped ... struggle with all their might against their bitter fate, and some choose death rather than a life of shame. ... Girls who frivolously subject themselves to disgrace by their free will, for well known social and economic reasons, are not easily redeemed. It is easier to redeem those who fall because of their innocence, and against their will.42 In London during 1892, "a man named Kahn, well-known as one of the chiefs of this inhuman traffic," was tried for the abduction of Fanny E., who had run away from her respectable home after a quarrel with her fiance. The girl, who had been rescued from Kahn in France, insisted on shielding the man in court and he went free.43 One Isaac Schdiferstein was convicted in Vienna in 1902 of transporting an estimated 400 Jewish and gentile girls yearly to brothels in the East, for which he was sentenced to one year in prison.44 East European Jewry was the main reservoir out of which several thou- sand Jewish girls were drawn into prostitution in foreign lands, and out of which Jewish men, as well as women accomplices, emerged as procurers and transporters of prostitutes and keepers of brothels. It is probable that most Jewish prostitutes never left Eastern Europe. However, the most con- 41. JAPG&amp;W, Report, 1911, p. 50. 42. Ha-Sefirah, February 5 (18), 1904. 43.

Girls were transported overseas to South America, South Africa, and even the Far East, usually via England, for a career of service in brothels. Others were taken to Turkish and Egyptian destinations, often by the Danube and Black Sea. Here we shall concentrate on England as a destina- tion as well as a transit point, and describe the efforts made by Anglo-Jewry and its collaborators to suppress the traffic. An Abominable Traffic in London The East European Jewish traffickers who transported Jewish girls to England at first found little obstacle in English law. Prostitution itself had been long known among English Jews, but it was negligible when compared with the extent of prostitution in England at large.45 Extensive evidence exists on the sexual practices and foibles of English society at all its levels, and the prevalence of prostitution.46 Before 1885, the basic law regarding prostitution was the Vagrancy Act of 1824, under which it was an offense, in the words of Halsbury, for a "common prostitute [to be] wandering in a public street or public highway, or in any place of public resort, and behav- ing in a riotous or indecent manner." Such conduct could bring a sentence of thirty days.47 There had to be a complaint by the offended person, who was 45. Todd M.

Obviously, few men who had been accosted by a prostitute would complain, especially because they could be cross- examined and embarrassed. The control of prostitution as established by the Contagious Diseases Acts of 1864, 1866 and 1869, however, constituted a decided infringement on personal liberty. Areas heavily inhabited by soldiers were subjected to this law, under which any woman merely suspected of prostitution could be compelled by the police to submit to a physical examination. If found to be diseased, they could be confined to hospital up to ninety days. Enforcement tended to be brutal and arbitrary and only after several tragic injustices had been committed were the laws repealed.48 While prostitution flourished in nineteenth century London, there were inconsistent figures on the number of women who made their livelihood from the trade. They ranged from 10,000 to 200,000, and 80,000 may be nearly correct.49 The appearance of local and international trafficking in prostitution as a substantial problem among the Jews during the 1880s coincided with a surge of reforming energy in England which extended into the sphere of sexual morals. A sensational agitation, initiated by W. T. Stead's newspaper series, "The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon," made it public knowledge that young girls were bought and sold for prostitution, even by their parents, and were frequently transported abroad for that career.5" Under the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885 (48 &amp; 49 Victoria ch. 69) procuring or keeping girls under sixteen as prostitutes, or being their customers, became an offense, and a felony when the girl had not reached her thirteenth birthday. The difficulties of proof in court were substantially eased by admitting the 48.

Landlords who operated brothels, or knowingly leased dwellings as brothels, as well as the agents and tenants, became liable to fine and imprisonment. Philan- thropic, including Jewish, efforts to reform prostitutes under eighteen years of age were aided by the Act's Section 10, under which not only could a girl's relatives or guardian secure a court order for her removal from premises where she was "unlawfully detained for immoral purposes," but also "any other person" recognized by the court as acting in her interest. Subsequent legislation was vigorously promoted by the National Vigilance Association, the organization which embodied in the sphere of sexual morals English reform and humanitarianism, and also censoriousness. It was founded in 1885 and adorned by eminent names from the clergy and nobility, as well as the chief rabbi and several leading Jews, while directed by its redoubtable secretary William A. Coote (1842-1919).1 Their efforts helped to enact an amendment in 1898 to the Vagrancy Act (61 &amp; 62 Victoria ch. 39), which made it an offense for a man to solicit for a prostitute or to subsist wholly or partly from her earnings. The Aliens Act of 1905 allowed expulsion from England for aliens convicted of offenses connected with prostitution which were not punishable by fine alone, and by 1913 four hundred persons had been expelled for trafficking.52 Speaking generally, legislation was directed against child prostitution and men involved in the trade. The ordinary prostitute could carry on with little interference, provided she was not noisy about it. But there was enough law on the books to make life difficult and risky for men who lived from the prostitute's toil. Chief Rabbi Hermann Adler observed in later years that around 1880, "the social evil had not become a disturbing factor in our community." The change was due "directly to the recrudescence of active Russian persecu- tions in 1881.""3 The first report about organized Jewish prostitution con- nected with recent Jewish immigration came in 1887, when the Jewish Ladies' Association for Preventive and Rescue Work learned from a Chris- 51.

Several houses are filled with them."54 The Association, as well as the rector of Stepney and then Delegate Chief Rabbi Hermann Adler, shocked by the crassness of the soliciting, prodded the police to act. Soon the vicinity was cleared of the nuisance. A substantial number of Yiddish-speaking prostitutes and traf- fickers were carrying on in the port and naval center of Portsmouth around the same time, but a vigorous effort by the local Jews suppressed them.55 The Jewish Ladies' Association, like its larger partner the National Vigi- lance Association, was founded in 1885. One founder recalled the immedi- ate cause as the plight of two repentant Jewish prostitutes who did not desire a Christian refuge, but found no place for themselves in any Jewish institu- tion.56 International trafficking first came to the ladies' attention in 1890, when the Rev. Dr. A. Lowy presented a memorandum "concerning the abominable traffic in young Jewish girls, taken from Austria, Rumania, Galicia to Constantinople," and also "constantly carried on between Eng- land and Buenos Aires." In response the ladies sent notices to European Jewish newspapers, "warning young girls from leaving their homes by the advice of strangers or under the care of strangers."57 "An important case of abduction," that of Fanny E. discussed above, led to "a long discussion... upon what international measures might be adopt- ed for the suppression of the White Slave Trade."58 The traffic itself was well established by then, with its center said to be in the East End of London and "entirely in the hands of foreigners." One such foreigner who sailed for Buenos Aires with three "Polish" girls could not be stopped, and other traf- fickers were doing likewise.59 One informant provided the address of a man in the East End, "who travelled regularly between England and Buenos Aires, taking girls over."60 As a decoy intended to win the girls' confidence, he obtained marriage licenses. Similarly, two women were reported "fre- quent passengers to &amp; from Buenos Aires, that on going out there they were 54. JLA, Report, 1889-1890, pp. 16-17. 55.

Amelia Hyman of Lodz was persuaded by Solomon Balberski, 35, and Jacob Schlamowitz, 40, both hairdressers in London, to come there and marry Schlamowitz. These two, together with a third per- son, one Lefcovitch, met the girl and promptly took her substantial savings of ?15 for safekeeping. Actually Balberski, who was himself married, deposited the money in a bank under his own name. They next took Amelia's clothing and personal belongings and having her in their grip, attempted repeatedly to seduce her. She held them off, until a man named Wolf Levisohn somehow appeared on the scene as the rescuer. Levisohn instigated the girl to have Balberski and Schlamowitz arrested (Lefcovitch disappeared from the picture), and the Gentlemen's Committee of the Jewish Ladies' Association entered the case. It was decided not to proceed under the Criminal Law Amendment Act, possibly because the girl had passed her eighteenth birthday or the two miscreants were not actually keep- ing a brothel. When Amelia Hyman declined to withdraw her complaint in return for getting back her belongings, there apparently was a civil suit besides a criminal case. "Only on its being pointed out to her that she should let the whole story of the attempts made against her to be publicly known, as her doing so might save other girls from a like danger" did she agree to testify "of the more painful portions of the matter." The prosecution was thorough, with seventeen witnesses called and ?150 spent. Her sponsors were pleased with "the success with which she stood a most severe cross- examination prompted by the prisoners who were in the best position to have known if there had been anything discreditable in her past career." The two men were found guilty of conspiring to obtain, and of obtaining, Amelia Hyman's money by false pretenses and with intention to defraud. Schlamo- witz, the supposed bridegroom, was sentenced by the Recorder of London at Central Criminal Court to five months at hard labor, while Balberski was dealt with severely, receiving five years at penal servitude.62 What Schlamo- 61.

A private collection raised a substantial sum to cover the expenses of the case and to provide for Amelia Hyman personally. She was also furnished with a testimonial attesting her high character, and she then disappears from sight.

GARTNER witz and Balberski attempted was one of the standard techniques for entic- ing girls into prostitution, but it was foiled by their intended victim's un- usual courage and determination. To help in locating a girl named Heia Geneindel, who somehow disappeared on board a Hamburg-London steamer, Delegate Chief Rabbi Hermann Adler wrote to the rabbi of Radom at the Association's request. The latter, however, could do nothing without her passport picture. Meanwhile "her friends in Poland fear she has been taken to South America."63 In other cases, the Jewish Association declined to intervene against men about whom girls and women made complaints of assault or theft. The implied reason is that these were "undeserving" persons who had compromised themselves and whose testimony would not hold up. The operations of an international trafficker are illuminated by the case of Marcus Weinbart, a Rumanian Jew aged 55, who was brought to trial in 1896 at Liverpool Assizes. His confederate, one Adolph, was still at large. Weinbart arrived in Liverpool from Buenos Aires during November, 1895, and there met Adolph. This Adolph then left for the Continent, and returned a month later with two "respectable young girls," aged 20 and 21, from "country districts in Austria." Their names were Kurkowaskae and Bendriola (also given as Bendziola), and they were probably not Jewish. Weinbart gave Adolph "a handful of gold." The girls overheard the two men speaking of further trips to and from South America and of girls to be brought there, until Weinbart hushed Adolph. The defendant and the two girls lodged four days in the same room in Copperas Hill. He bought them cheap clothes, promising that they would be finely dressed in Buenos Aires. "You will have to look nice, because gentlemen will come to see you at night." Adolph came to a certain "emigration agent," to say he was going to Vienna, while Weinbart, claiming the two girls were his daughters, gave the same agent money to buy tickets to Buenos Aires. However, the girls took fright, fled the house, and went to the police. At Weinbart's trial, they both testified in an unspecified language by means of a translator. During the trial, one of the girls said she had been told that in Buenos Aires she would meet a friend from home who had left there six months earlier than they had. The defense argued that Weinbart, as well as Adolph, were ordinary, legitimate businessmen who were merely casual acquain- 63.

Jurors should "not allow themselves to assume too much against the Jewish fraternity .... Jews were engaged in commerce all over the world; there was a spirit of brotherhood among them which was unknown to any other race. . . ." Nevertheless Weinbart was found guilty of attempting to procure for prostitution abroad, in violation of the Criminal Law Amend- ment Act, and went to prison for a year at hard labor.64 Eleven years later, Louis Gold, 27, a carpenter, and Harry Cohen, 24, a tailor, were sentenced to fifteen and twelve months' hard labor, respectively, for procuring two East End Jewish girls to become prostitutes abroad. They had sailed from Liverpool to Buenos Aires, only to be refused permission to land and sent back. A third girl who was almost taken gave information about them, and upon their return they were arrested. A police inspector testified that they had carried on as traffickers four or five years. Under the terms of the Aliens Act of 1905, the two men were sentenced to deportation upon the completion of their imprisonment.65 Not all procuring was for export. In Manchester, a cabinet maker named Morgenstern, his wife, and a shopkeeper named Lewis, sought to make a prostitute of nineteen year old Dora. The girl had refused Mrs. Morgen- stern's offers to make her an "independent lady" and to "bring in gentlemen to her." One evening, however, the woman met Dora as she left work, took her to supper, and persuaded her to come with her and the two men by train to Liverpool. Then commenced the attempt to seduce Dora. The four people vainly roamed about, seeking a hotel which would allow Dora and Lewis to occupy one room. Meanwhile, Dora's mother "acting on some- thing she heard," sent her son to Liverpool, where he located his sister shar- ing a room for the night with the Morgenstern woman. Dora went home, and the three conspirators went to jail for eighteen months.66 Another method could ensnare a girl and paradoxically it was marriage. This was the shtile khupe, a clandestine, unregistered form of Jewish mar- riage. Someone promulgated a ketubbah, which later on disappeared, and there were presumably benedictions, wine, a ring, and witnesses. In fact, there was some presumption of validity to this marriage in Jewish law, although none at all in those countries where marriage had to be not only religiously but also civilly performed. 64.

GARTNER In England, where a Jewish marriage performed under the jurisdiction of the chief rabbi was certified civilly to the Registrar's office, it was also pos- sible to contract a civil marriage at the Registrar's office, followed, if desired, by a religious marriage performed by a functionary who stood out- side the chief rabbi's jurisdiction. The furtive shtile khupe, a religious with- out a civil marriage, imitated Eastern Europe where Jewish marriages were solely religious, without civil registration. The loose limits of information and communication made dishonest marriage easier to perpetrate there than in the West.67 "Irregular marriages" in England disturbed the chief rab- binate and the Board of Deputies. They reported in 1892 "a great many" taking place. "Such marriages, being known to those who conduct them to be unlawful, are performed in a secret and sinister manner, and every pos- sible means is adopted to prevent the actors being traced." One virtuoso married nine women in turn, "each of these nine marriages being mere idle forms of enabling the conscious perpetrator of the villainy to discard at his pleasure his innocent and unhappy victims."68 The president of the Board of Deputies, Arthur Cohen (1829-1914), who was one of the foremost lawyers of his time, sought to promote a bill to make "irregular Jewish marriages" illegal. However; the proposal was attacked as a measure to extend further the authority of the Chief Rabbinate and to penalize the innocent errors of immigrant Jews, and it had to be dropped.69 Yet a girl might see "nothing wrong in the proposal of a 'Stille Chuppa,' which is probably the commencement of her downfall.""7 She believed her- self lawfully married. Actually she was at the mercy of her putative husband, who could force her more easily into prostitution and live upon her earnings in the street. Likely as not, he abandoned her in time, and she might be a deserted wife in Jewish law ('agunah), with a child who was illegitimate in the eyes of the law of the land. Otherwise she might be dragged along by him and he could sell her in Argentina to a brothel and return to Eastern Europe to repeat the operation. On one occasion, a girl was rescued from a room she had been locked in, preparatory to a shtile khupe to be followed by departure for Buenos Aires.71 The Jewish Association reported that the "marriage question remains our chief difficulty.

They persisted, according to Dayan Moses Hyamson, only as "the direct consequence of illegal 'Gittin."' A few rabbis-three were cited before the Royal Commission on Divorce and Matrimonial Causes-gave Jewish divorces unreciprocated by the law of the land, and their number "is decidedly on the increase." Remarriage following clandes- tine divorce also had to be clandestine, and the defenselessness of the woman "does in many cases lead to prostitution," according to Hyamson. After hearing the testimony of Chief Rabbi Adler, D. L. Alexander, and H. S. Q. Henriques, the majority of the Royal Commission recommended a penalty against any person issuing a Jewish divorce except after decree of divorce by a court.73 However, the readiest source of girls for the prostitute's career must have been confused, frightened girl immigrants. Unaccompanied girls land- ing at the Port of London were in fact the favorite prey of traffickers. From 1890 through 1897, their number averaged 312 yearly.74 From 1899 through 1906, the annual average leaps to 806, and from 1907 through 1913 it settles back to 695. The peak years are 1902 and 1903 with 1,021 and 1,089 girls respectively. The proportion of unaccompanied girls to the total number of steerage passengers on the ships which brought them, ranges in random fashion from approximately 3 percent to 12 percent. It may be more signifi- cant that the ups and downs in the number of unaccompanied girl immi- grants does not follow the fluctuations of Jewish immigration generally, nor does one detect an inverse relationship.75 About 80 percent to 90 percent of 72.

The remainder, except perhaps 3 percent, were "Ger- mans," "Rumanians," and "Austrians"-the latter probably Galicians and Hungarians. The girls were young. A small proportion, around 3 percent, were children under fourteen.76 The median age stood around twenty: Age 1906 1907 1908 1909 1910 1911 1912 Under 16 78 78 53 88 54 46 35 16-20 402 298 229 283 309 219 221 Over 20 326 338 339 305 336 276 261 (It is difficult to explain the substantial discrepancy between the unaccom- panied girls and the division by age provided in other tables of the same reports. Quite a few Christians were among the former, and probably not the latter.) Unaccompanied, however, did not necessarily mean alone. Youthful brothers, sisters and friends often traveled together without adults. Boats to London usually came from Hamburg. They tied up at Tilbury down the Thames, at Blackwall near the East End, or in midstream and then landed their passengers in small boats. Tilbury passengers disembarked and proceeded by train to Fenchurch Street Station. Boats arriving at Harwich often contained transmigrants who traveled by train directly to Liverpool. Many, however, traveled to London by train, arriving at the Liverpool Street Station at the border of the East End. There was no Ellis Island for immigrants in England. At any of these landing places and railroad stations, immigrants were liable to be annoyed, cheated, and robbed. The manifold methods employed by the crimps, sharks, and runners have been described.77 Beginning in 1885 a representative of the Poor Jews' Temporary Shelter met the boats and shielded their steerage passengers from molestation. In the same year, the Jewish Ladies' Association also began ministering at dockside to the most vulnerable element among the immigrants, the unaccompanied girls. Their agent, bearing a badge in English and Yiddish, was allowed to be the first to board the vessel. Lacking any foreknowledge of arrivals, the organization 76.

Even so, before 1900 a small percentage of ships was not met. Then a second and ultimately a third agent entered the service. The critical moment came when the boat docked. A description of Jewish inspectors' work at its full development is provided in 1911: Our inspectors attend the arrival of every boat which carries passengers from the Continent into the London Docks, and also all the Continental trains which arrive at Liverpool Street Station. They wear a badge upon which the name and purpose of this association is written in Hebrew [letters, i.e., Yid- dish] and English. They go amongst the passengers and ascertain which girls are travelling alone. The captains and officers on board, and the officials at the dock, advise the girls to trust our inspectors. They learn where the girls wish to go, and offer to help and conduct them to their destinations. At the same time those girls who are travelling alone in company of other women, or of men, are spoken to, and if it is found that they are not closely related, the girls are per- suaded to place themselves in the care of our inspectors. All girls are then taken from the boat or train to Sara Pyke House, where they are again inter- viewed by the Lady Superintendent and the Inspector, and if the addresses in their possession prove satisfactory, they are taken to them, after full particu- lars have been entered in our records. In cases where there is no address, or where the address is that of an undesirable person or house, the facts are explained to the girls, and she is offered the protection of the Home, which is very rarely refused. These steps are very necessary, as it oftens happens that girls are given addresses en route, to so-called respectable houses, by un- scrupulous people, or are recommended to persons whom they do not know and who exploit them for their own purposes.78 The entire procedure had the indispensable cooperation of the railroads and steamship lines. Suspicious individuals accompanying girls always gave up and vanished when they failed to persuade the Jewish agent that they had a legitimate relationship to the girls. "The vigilance displayed by the [Jewish] officers has thoroughly disturbed the traffic," declared the Jewish Association with pride.79 Having the police at hand explains why the Jewish Association's agents were not assaulted and harassed by their quarry. No system could reckon with, much less check, every instance of human 78. JAPG&amp;W, Report, 1911, pp. 74-75. 79. JAPG&amp;W, Report, 1906, p. 25.</page><page sequence="30">158 LLOYD P.

Arrived in London in company of a trafficker. Upon hear- ing of her danger she left him, and was escorted to her sister's home. Case 32.-Aged 23. Was seen in the streets in company of the same trafficker referred to above. The girl was warned, but hesitated to believe. We took her to see the girl in Case 31, and upon hearing her story she consented, and gave up the man. Case No. 82.-Aged 19.-Induced to leave her home by a woman who promised her good work in England. Upon arrival the girl was met, taken care of, and ultimately sent home by us. Her travelling companion proved to be connected with a gang of traffickers. There was not sufficient evidence for prosecution. Case No. 26.-Aged 16. Arrived from Russia in the company of a woman whose acquaintance she had made on the journey, and who had taken all her money. She was taken care of by us, her money was restored, and ultimately we handed her over to her father in London.80 The great majority of the unaccompanied girls desired simply to join relatives or friends in London or the Provinces. They were escorted to the local addresses if those were respectable. But when they were in the Jewish Association's carefully kept black book the girl was warned and urged not to go there. She was taken there if she repeatedly insisted, and the escort then told the inhabitants of the house that the Jewish Association and the police had an eye on them. Frequently, addresses were lost en route, out of date, or so garbled that they did not make sense, for example: Engleu mano Widnes Ckrnwel stri No. 64 piten Cudrewieze.81 The Jewish Association's agents became quite skillful in reading the un- readable. Often frustrated at the docks, traffickers and their accomplices resorted to the simpler method of giving the addresses of supposed lodging houses to unsuspecting girls on board ship. These were brothels or linked with 80. JAPG&amp;W, Report, 1901, pp. 49-53. 81.

A case in 1901 may illustrate the vagaries of addresses, reputable and otherwise: Case 74. This girl (aged 19) was followed from Antwerp by traffickers, and was seen by our officer on arrival at a London Railway Station in the com- pany of two men. On being questioned they produced the address to which they intended to take her. Our officer seeing that it was one which is on our list of suspected houses, warned the girl and asked if she had any friend in Lon- don. The men insisted on taking the girl with them, so our officer followed. Then one man ran away, and the other seeing that our officer still persisted, allowed the girl to go with him. She was taken to our home, and thence to her friends, who were very grateful for the protection accorded.82 Jewish traffickers and prostitutes tended to quit the East End of London. Streets where brothels had abounded became centers of Jewish immigrant settlement, and the disreputable inhabitants were forced out.83 Yet "houses of evil repute" were still conspicuous around 1905.84 Those who left removed to Soho, where prostitution became predominantly foreign. Cer- tain streets around Piccadilly were the particular resort of prostitutes from abroad. Police officials even compared the foreign with the native brand, finding the former "more shameless and persistent," and the latter more drunken and disorderly.85 The Yiddish poet Morris Rosenfeld (1862-1923) sentimentally sympa- thized with these girls: In England iz do a shtot Lester In England there is a town called Leicester In London iz do aza skver In London there is such a square Dort shteyen shtendig dray Three sisters always stand there shvester Ver ken zey nit, ver, nit ver?

GARTNER The mundane records of the Jewish Association for the Protection of Girls and Women suggest the extent of Jewish involvement in prostitution. The categories devised for its detailed, informative annual reports include missing girls who were found "in unsatisfactory surroundings" (below, column 1) as well as missing girls "not found" (below, column 2) and quite possibly transported abroad or inhabiting a London brothel. "Many com- plaints" reached the police concerning Jewish girls disappearing from the East End.86 Some girls were "traced and found to be leading immoral lives (unable to ascertain whether willingly or not)" (below, column 3). Also reported were "houses and people suspected of carrying on, or profiting by, the White Slave Traffic" (below, column 4).

Noone is known to have ventured an estimate at the time, and perhaps it is hardly worthwhile to make the attempt now. Yet there might have been nearly one thousand Jews, men and women, who found more or less full employment in the traffic, and their faces changed all the time. It is clear that as a Jewish social problem the traffic in prostitution was not overwhelming, yet not at all negligible. But it was disgraceful and embarrassing. Antialien agitators and anti-Semites began to make capital of the subject 86. The Times, April 29, 1907, p. 4.</page><page sequence="33">ANGLO-JEWRY AND TRAFFIC IN PROSTITUTION 161 as early as 1892. The menace to British morals from immigrant Jewish pros- titutes and traffickers became one of their stock themes.87 Arnold White, the most talented of the agitators and one of the most assiduous, added sexual immorality to the calamities which alien Jews were inflicting upon his England. When he inquired of the Metropolitan Police in 1907, the Chief Clerk, besides enlightening him about the terms used in the trade, assured White that there was no central traffickers' organization. "The recruits are chiefly of French, German, and Belgian nationalities."88 Nevertheless, it was believed that White, undaunted by police information, was the author of a mendacious newspaper series in 1911, "The Problem of the Alien," meaning 90 percent Jews, which included a piece on the alien's evil moral influence. The alien Jew, as a member of a physically and mentally inferior race, was guilty of "immorality in its most abominable forms." He was "a keeper of gambling halls and disorderly houses, a procurer and a bully. ... Procuring for the 'white slave' trade, and living upon the earnings of women, are now two of the regular professions of the alien Jew."89 The secretary of the Jewish Association's Gentlemen's Committee, supported by W. A. Coote's evi- dence, pronounced White's statement "a deliberate falsehood."90 However, White and other antialiens and anti-Semites were not to be silenced. In the struggle to influence public opinion, the disturbing truth had to be accepted that Jews figured prominently among the traffickers and, if slightly less so, among prostitutes. Combating the traffic was not only a matter of morals and philanthropy but also of protecting the good name of the Jews. The question inevitably arose why Jewish girls turned to the prostitute's career. In certain cases they were inducted into the trade by the atmosphere in their families. It appears likely that most prostitutes quit their trade and married after their prime years were past. The sexual undertones in many such homes would have nudged susceptible daughters toward the traffic. While some girls sought to leave, or were removed from, the corrupting influence of parents, uncle, sister, brother-in-law, or some other relative, there can be little doubt that others stayed on and became prostitutes.91 87.

GARTNER Other answers could give little comfort, since they reflected upon conditions of Jewish life, or upon the social order itself which liberal bourgeois Jewish philanthropy felt unable to touch, much less change. There were conditions about the life of working girls in a great city which led Jewish no less than Christian girls toward prostitution. Perhaps the foreign, lonely Jewish girl suffered greater hardship than did the native Bri- tish. "Slackness of work, especially in the seasonal trades" was blamed, and also "the terrible poverty of some, the dearth of work for willing hands, the ill-health and utter friendlessness."92 Communal workers emphasized "a quarrel at home, slackness of work, lack of proper amusements, and some- times, nay, often the inability of the parents" to deal with their children.93 Restless, unhappy girls and reckless young men could meet in "some of the 'restaurants' in the East End and Soho districts . .. which are nothing more than gambling dens and houses of assembly for men and women engaged in this nefarious traffic."94 The young man might "'treat' them in cafes and restaurants, and by the promise of marriage or by other inducements, bring about their downfall. The rest is easy for them. After her fall, the girl, ashamed to face her parents, does not like to return home." Soon she becomes a streetwalker.95 The Jewish Association had "reason to fear that there are organized gangs who are always searching for young and helpless victims," and it urged the Yiddish press, rabbis, and friendly societies in the East End to publicize these facts as a warning.96 The social sources of the Jewish traffic in prostitution and its practices are illustrated by the case of Joe Anker, "James Smith," and their confeder- ates, who were tried early in 1898 for attempted trafficking. Fourteen months earlier, Anker had appeared at the Jewish Association's Sara Pyke House where he virtuously informed the matron "that a woman named Some Firestein, living at 134 Stamford St. Waterloo Road [one of London's centers of prostitution] had recently got hold of 6 girls whom she obliged to go on the streets. One of these girls had been at S. P. House.""97 The quarrel between Anker and the Firestein woman was patched up, because they were 92. JAPG&amp;W, Report, 1912, pp. 24, 76. 93.

The offense alleged against them was "unlawfully administering spirits of wine and beer to Toba G**, 17 years of age, and to Fanny R**, 151/2 years old, so as to stupefy them for an unlawful purpose." "All the persons concerned in the case were Jews of foreign nationality," and the judge refused to allow bail for any of them.98 Maurice Silvermann, 25, living in the East End and described as a leather merchant, was added to the case on the charge of having procured the girls, and "James Smith" was also charged. Toba had been in England eighteen months, and Fanny, six months; both testified in Yiddish through an interpreter. The younger girl was living in Commercial Road with a guardian, and elsewhere in London she had a brother who lived with their stepbrother and his wife. This brother, Auscher, once came to see her and her visiting friend Toba, and took them out to the street to meet the stepbrother, who was with Shrednecki and Kuncher. They all repaired to the stepbrother's house, where his wife served spirits. Kuncher then displayed a marquise and declared to Toba, "I desired to be married to you." He probably intended a mock Jewish marriage, to delude the girl that they were genuinely married. The scene of activity then transferred to the house managed by Anker and the Firestein woman where, stimulated by liquor, relations continued between the two girls and the two men, until Fanny's guardian learned what was afoot and took action.99 The implications of this squalid little tale are clarified by the charge against "James Smith, 29, described as a draper, of American nationality, living at St. Mark's street, Aldgate," for conspiring with Anker and Fire- stein "to procure one Rachel L* for an immoral purpose... ." The girl worked as a button-hole maker, one of the worst paid jobs in the clothing industry, and was in England six months. She was introduced by a fellow lodger to Smith and Anker, and after some meetings and drinks, Smith offered her marriage and induced her to move into the American Hotel, a brothel in the Waterloo Road area. On the first morning Smith raped Rachel, but she stayed on with him at the place for two weeks. He, Anker, and Feierstein answered the girl's request for money by demanding, with words and blows, that she go on the streets, which she refused to do.0oo It is 98.

He settled in Pittsburgh, where he served a term for burglary, and then in New York, where as Joe Silver, he became a citizen and an agent of the Parkhurst investigation into police corruption. In 1895 Lis-Silver quit the United States for England. There, as James Smith, he commenced a long career as a fence and trafficker, which led him to British and German South Africa and to the Continent.'10 "Smith's" case was joined to that of the others, and their trial, which was held before the Common Serjeant of London in Old Bailey, lasted three days. A solicitor "watched the case on behalf of certain persons interested in it," quite possibly the Jewish Association. It ended in acquittal, probably because the defendants, each of whom was "a competent but not compel- lable witness," did not testify and the girls' testimony was not sufficient. "The details of the case were unsuitable for publication," The Times found.102 The three defendants were collaborators, not a cohesive gang. They fell in and fell out with one another as their convenience and unstable moods dictated. Many such groups carried on. In one case during 1902, a girl was rescued from a man who "belonged to a gang of bad characters who live by the earnings of their victims." There was a prosecution, and "during the trial some of the gang violently assaulted our informant." Two of the assailants were likewise prosecuted, and convicted.'03 Yet, there is no evidence nor any contemporary allegation that any centrally organized vice ring functioned. With "amazing cunning" traffickers, who knew one another and frequently were members of a family, cooperated in a chain which led from Eastern Europe to brothels overseas.104 "A girl employed in a factory in Lodz was induced by a male and female acquaintance to come over here so as to earn higher wages." She was forced into prostitution and "cruelly beaten" when she attempted to escape. When she was arrested for soliciting on the streets, 101.

The date is July 2, 1899: ... the girl Sprinze F. ... had now come with quite a different account of her case. The girl now states her real name to be Perl B., that she had by a so called "stille Chasne" been married in Warsaw to the man S., whose real name she said was Jossel R. &amp; who was a ponce &amp; trafficker. She had through Rabbi W. here obtained a divorce from R. &amp; since then married a man called Jisroel T., who had gone back to Warsaw. It was suggested that Rabbi W. be asked if he had divorced B. &amp; R. The ... Christian girl Martha P. of Frankfort ... had been rescued in Verviers. The further development of the case of Eva B. was reported. In regard to the alleged concealment of the birth of Eva's child the Committee decided to assist Mr. B., the girl's father, if he wished to take any action in the matter ... In regard to the case of Rachel C., whose parents kept a brothel at 23 Denman Street the Committee instructed the Sec. .... to have Rachel &amp; her brothers removed from their surroundings &amp; out of the control of their parents by an application to the Police ... The Sec. reported the case of Leah S. &amp; said that he knew from another case, that the informant Mr. R. the girl's brother-in-law was connected with the traffickers. ... A full account was further given by the Sec. of the cases of Rivka F. &amp; Chaje J. The two girls upon arrival at S[ara] P[yke] H[ouse, home for work- ing girls] had shown an address to Stamford Street but were taken to an address, 22 Jane Str., E. which a country-woman of one of the girls who hap- pened to be just then at S.P.H. gave as that of the girls' relatives. When the Assn's visitor, Miss Levy, called at 22 Jane Str., Mrs. M. denied all knowledge of the girls. Incidentally the Sec. Dr. Fr[iedberger] heard of the girls being missing, he took the case in hand &amp; through [their inspector] Solomon traced 105. Ibid., p. 24. 106.

Solomon had traced a trafficker who arrived this week from the Con- tinent via Harwich to have taken his victim to 4 Hannibal Road, the tenants of which house were known to him, the Sec., as thieves, ponces &amp; traffickers. With regard to another case of suspected traffickers, who had arrived here a few days ago, he the Sec. had sent by wire full information to the Sec. of the Liverpool Committee, in order to have the Bellagio watched, which vessel left yesterday (July Ist) the Liverpool Docks for B/A [Buenos Aires]. Success did not attend all the efforts. Anglo-Jewish A ction against the International Traffic The Jewish community, for moral and philanthropic reasons, concerned itself with the problem of prostitution, and its efforts were tenacious and prolonged. The Jewish Ladies' Association for Preventive and Rescue Work, as we have mentioned, was founded at the apogee of Victorian reform, in 1885, to meet unaccompanied immigrant girls and women on immigrant boats, to combat the traffic in prostitution and to help prosti- tutes seeking to return to decent society. Over the years it established a tem- porary shelter for newcomers, Sara Pyke House for respectable working girls, Charcroft House for unmarried mothers and their babies, and a small "industrial school" for girls removed from disreputable environments."70 There was a Gentlemen's Committee which commenced to function in 1888, and took over the services provided at dockside and railway terminals. It also conducted the campaign against the traffic in prostitution. In 1896, the organization changed its name to the Jewish Association for the Protection of Girls and Women. With the wealthy elite of Anglo-Jewry as its sup- porters and with subsidies from the Jewish Colonization Association, the JAPG&amp;W was well financed. It cooperated closely with the Travellers' Aid Society and the National Vigilance Association, and maintained small local branches in Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, and at the port towns of Grimsby and Southampton. The NVA's five year campaign which led to the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1912 (2&amp;3 Geo. 5 ch. 20) had the vigorous support of the Jewish Association, while the statute itself was 107.

Alexander, K.C., President of the Jewish Board of Depu- ties. W. A. Coote's international crusade had his personal religious vision as its inspiration, but much of the practical guidance came from the Jewish Association, which already had considerable knowledge of the trafficking problem abroad.'"1 The National Vigilance Association, as led by Coote, took action against literature and performances it deemed indecent, but the Jewish Association dedicated itself to antiprostitution efforts, with some attention to girls' personal and family problems. In the eyes of the Jewish Association, prostitutes were always victims, whether of bad men, poor upbringing, deficient education, or poverty, and as victims they were to be, in the term regularly employed, redeemed. There is no known case where the association prosecuted a prostitute. Nothing in the backgrounds of the men in the trade, however, served to mitigate the execration heaped upon them as "vile," "evil," "human vultures," and the like. The Reverend Simeon Singer, as his son-in-law Israel Abrahams recalled, "would consent to no condonation of Jewish offenders, but frequently instituted prosecutions."'09 The act of 1912, following the pattern of previous legislation, was aimed at traffickers rather than prostitutes. It enlarged landlords' responsibility for premises rented out and used as a brothel, permitted the arrest without war- rant of suspected procurers, and authorized whipping to be added to the sentence of convicted procurers. The Jewish Association for the Protection of Girls and Women was drawn deeply into combating international trafficking. Great Britain's geographic position, and her immense maritime commerce which dominat- ed the world's shipping, meant that most prostitutes for export would pass through British ports. The international problem was known of by 1890, and more information constantly came from later reports. The prime desti- nation of this traffic was Latin America, and Buenos Aires was its main port of arrival. A report of 1892 suggests the reputation which the city was acquiring when, in speaking of Colonel Albert E. W. Goldsmid's struggle against the traffic during his sojourn in Argentina on behalf of the Jewish Colonization Association, it denounced "the moral miasma that rises from 108.

The morality of those settled here (not the recent arrivals from Russia but chiefly those from Germany and engaged in commerce) is bad beyond description. A vile traffic has long been the curse of the city, and many a poor Jewess has been inveigled into it by these beasts in human form.""I1 Argentine Jewry itself treated everyone involved in the traffic as outcasts, but the actual cam- paign against Jewish commercial prostitution was organized and paid for by the Jewish Colonization Association and by the Jewish Association in Lon- don."' The traffickers' methods of persuasion and deceit to bring Jewish girls from Europe show that what had to be combated required effort in several countries. In July 1900 a prospering young jewelers' agent came to Austria, probably meaning Galicia, from the United States-so he represented him- self. He met and properly married the daughter of a respectable family. The new couple departed for Vienna en route back to the United States, but when next heard from months later, they were in Buenos Aires. The bride knew nothing of the traffic in prostitution, but her husband had been unable to persuade her to go there anyhow, even for the promising business oppor- tunity which awaited him. He deceived her into embarking on a boat to Argentina, saying simply its destination was the United States. Once in Buenos Aires and living in poverty, the woman began to be importuned by her brother-in-law, a brothel keeper, to go on the streets. He became more insistent when the husband had to be hospitalized for illness, but she stead- fastly refused and underwent privation and mistreatment. The young woman was rescued on account of the appeals to Jewish institutions from her family in Europe, who were suspicious why she was in Argentina at all.1"2 A child she bore her husband belonged to him by law, and had to be left behind. Another case reported by the Jewish Association likewise exemplifies the use of false destination, by more skillful operators: When visiting one of the Dutch boats that call at Southampton on their way to 110.

The latter was a very suspicious looking person, and questions were therefore asked, it was found that the wife was quite unaware of her destination. The girl's father, communicated with, said his daughter and her husband were supposed to be going to America, and begged us to rescue his daughter. He stated that this man had spent a great deal of money whilst in their village in Russia, and that he had even paid all the wedding expenses of an elder sister of the girl, in order to get the younger one. However, there was no legal basis for preventing the couple from sailing. The Buenos Aires committee, which was requested to seek them out, could not trace the husband and wife: They did not arrive at that city, and must have left at an intermediate port. The man had been heard to boast that he had several women who were bring- ing him in hundreds of pounds."3 They probably landed at Montevideo or Rio de Janeiro, which substi- tuted for Buenos Aires when the Argentine port began to inspect arrivals more strictly after approximately 1901.114 Abduction could also be practiced in London. A fifteen year old girl dis- appeared in 1898 after she met a man on the street who was seeking girls to go with him to South Africa as clerks in his business. She was prevailed upon to steal away from home, and her route led from Waterloo Station to Southampton to Le Havre. There she was given a ticket not to South Africa but to Montevideo, and the pair traveled separately on the same boat, "as someone might be looking for her. The man seemed afraid of something or other." Upon landing without interference, the girl was taken to a brothel and sold for ?100, and was told she had incurred a debt of ?120 which had to be worked off. Then she was moved to Buenos Aires, where she found herself among thirty girls in a brothel who were all working perpetually to pay off some "debt." The British Consul and the Commissioner of Police came together to look for her, but she was compelled to misstate her name and age. Then the Commissioner came alone and succeeded in identifying her. Once rescued and sent home, she reported that "most girls brought 113. JAPG&amp;W, Report, 1910, p. 46. 114.

GARTNER out to Buenos Aires, come induced by false pretenses, and have no idea of their fate ... many being absolutely illiterate and ignorant, became abject slaves.""' The traffic within the British Empire was of particular interest to the Jewish Association. When Rabbi Joseph H. Hertz (1872-1946) came to London during the Boer War after stormy years in South Africa advocating uitlander rights, he reported in private that "the traffic there was almost exclusively in the hands of Polish &amp; Russian Jews.""I6 He openly stated that "of late years the term 'Jewess' had become a byword and a hissing on the East Coast of Africa. From Delagoa Bay northward to Port Said there must be some 750 Jewish women (Aden of course excluded)," of whom 95 percent were prostitutes."7 In Lorenzo Marques, where he went after his expulsion from Johannesburg by the Boer government, Hertz found only one or two Jews living with their families. Besides recommending to them that they establish a synagogue and a cemetery and secure the services of a shobet, the future Chief Rabbi urged them to set up an antitraffic committee."8 This advice must have been proffered in heavy irony, since Hertz privately gave the Jewish Association "his opinion that 70% of all women trafficked came through Lorenzo Marques. ... There were from 60 to 100 Jewish prosti- tutes in Lorenzo Marques." In other places the state of affairs was also disreputable: In Beira the entire Jewish Community were traffickers, also in Salisbury, where the President &amp; the Chasan (Reader) of the community were traffickers. In Bulawayo a good many Jews, about 1/5 of the entire community were inter- ested in the traffic. As to Johannesburg, "there existed a Club, called the American Club, which consisted of traffickers from New York who if they were not natives of America had lived there for many years." Hertz could report "that one of the worst of the gang of traffickers" in Johannesburg, who qualified for the 115.

It is indeed suggestive that the intervention of perhaps the foremost banker in the world was required to make the Buenos Aires police remove one girl from a brothel. 116.

The Committee must have nodded in recognition of the man whom the minutes promptly identified: "[Joe Silver is Joe Lis, alias Abraham Ramer alias James Smith.]" On the other hand, thanks to a vigilant Jewish chief of police in Durban, there were hardly any prostitutes in that town. Elsewhere there were local committees to combat the traffic, some of which were founded after prodding by the Jewish Association in London and by Chief Rabbi Adler."l9 White women were scarce in South Africa, and among the Jews, who largely constituted the commercial class, some were ready to provide sex as a commodity. Not all girls who went to Argentina, South Africa or many other places were unaware of what they were meant to do there. Late in the night of November 30, 1899, the Secretary of the Jewish Association hurried to Liverpool "in pursuit of a suspected trafficker Menachem R., who was sail- ing with 2 young girls, Gitel &amp; Sarah L. by the 'California' for Boston." Representatives of the organization's Liverpool branch "awaited with a detective the arrival of the suspected party as well as that of Dr. Friede- berger in the early hours of the morning. The Police there were also ready to assist him and anxious to act. But R. and the L. girls having agreed to come to the Police-station Dr. Friedeberger found he could do no more than seriously warn the girls of their danger. They, however, would pay no atten- tion to it."120 Anglo-Jewry Leading an International Campaign Efforts to combat the Jewish traffic in prostitution within Britain took, as we have seen, the form of legislation, public and private warnings to girls and their families, reforming prostitutes, and prosecuting traffickers. Some of this was done in collaboration with general British efforts. The protection of immigrant girls arriving unaccompanied or in the company of suspected men at the docks and railway terminals could help to disrupt the inter- national as well as the domestic traffic, by breaking the chain which led from the East European sources of supply to the overseas markets. 119.

GARTNER However, the only sure way to break up the international Jewish traffic was to eliminate its source of supply, through education and warnings in Eastern Europe. The girls who were drawn into the traffic came predominantly from the impoverished masses who still held largely to the traditional forms of life and values, and whose leaders were rabbis of the traditional cast. West European Jews who were concerned with the problem of prostitution deemed it essential to secure the rabbis' cooperation. Better than anyone, the rabbi could dissuade girls and their families from marriages with young men who might be agents in the prostitution traffic. East European rabbis, however, usually played an aloof, honorary role in community affairs and were seldom active leaders. Few of them would have had much association with the class from which the girls were usually drawn. Yet their word car- ried weight, and it was worth soliciting. Especially was this so among Hasid- im, who regarded their rabbis in more than human terms. Bertha Pappen- heim succeeding in securing the endorsement of the Aleksandrov rabbi, R. Samuel Zvi, for her efforts, and the strong sympathy of the Czortkow rabbi for antitraffic work was also reported.121 Rabbi Ferdinand Rosenthal of Breslau sent a circular to the Galician rabbis early in the 1890s, urging them to tell their people to beware of unknown, eligible young men who wished to marry local girls.122 In 1894 the Hamburg Henry Jones lodge of the German Bne Brith com- menced their efforts in the field, and the organization elsewhere in Germany followed their lead. They protected girls at Hamburg and other ports, as well as at railroad stations and border points, and broadcast information in Eastern Europe concerning the dangers of the traffic. The German Jews did not refrain, as did the British Jews, from openly publishing the names and descriptions of male traffickers. On the other hand, they did not maintain institutions for wayward girls, as did the Jewish Association in London. In 1897, the Henry Jones lodge dispatched a circular letter of warning to rabbis and lay leaders in Galicia. It cautioned that "many men" who posed as pious Jews but were evil and sinning, were taking away innocent girls. Such charges, it added, had appeared in the anti-Semitic press, but unfortunately were now authenticated by sources of unquestioned veracity. The rabbis and lay leaders were urged to spread the word among their people. Signers included leaders of German, Austrian, and Rumanian Bne Brith, represen- 121.

However, the seeming emphasis on Galicia alone may have irritated some of the circular's recipients, as some of the proceedings during the Lemberg conference in 1903 were to show.123 In 1899 yet another circular went to the rabbis of Eastern Europe and appeared also in the Hebrew press. Its seven signers included again the chief rabbi of Great Britain, who was its author, and the chief rabbis of France and the Jewish communities of Berlin, Vienna, Rome, Frankfurt, and Hamburg. The sad tidings have come to us that evil men and women go about in your countries from town to town and village to village and induce Jewish maidens, by false representations, to leave their native land to go, by their advice, to dis- tant countries, telling them they will find there good and remunerative situ- ations in business houses. In some instances these wicked men add to their iniquity by going through the form of religious marriage with the girls. Then they take them on board ship to India, Brazil, Argentina, or other countries in South America, and then sell them there to keepers of houses of evil repute. Who can adequately describe their bitter fate and terrible suffering ... We therefore approach you today to confer with you and to receive your advice how and in what way, we can remove the terrible shame from us.... Upon us all the duty lies to remove this horrible evil from our midst ... 124 The rabbis recommended that known traffickers be cast out of their communities. No published reaction to these appeals has come to light, but the subject itself and the galaxy of rabbis who signed must have given them considerable attention. Now rabbis began to play an active role in combat- 123.

GARTNER ing the traffic. The Union of German Rabbis (Deutsche Rabbinerverband) devoted part of its second annual meeting in July 1902 to "The Struggle against the Traffic in Girls," which was the title of the main address by Rabbi Leopold Rosenak (1870-1923) of Bremen, who had been campaign- ing on the subject for several years. Noting the high proportion of Jews among the girls transported to Argentina, and the even higher proportion of Jewish men among the traffickers, Rosenak urged that besides protective and police measures, a long-range program of social and educational reform be undertaken in Eastern Europe. His colleagues generally endorsed Rosenak's views.'25 As the pace quickened, the Hamburg lodge's activities in the field broadened. Under its auspices Bertha Pappenheim undertook a survey of conditions in Galicia together with the young sociologist Dr. Sara Rabino- witsch (b. 1880). Her share in their joint report "On the Condition of the Jewish Population in Galicia" included a section on the traffic in prostitu- tion.'26 German efforts came to a climax when the Hilfsverein der deutschen Juden convened a conference in Lemberg, held on September 15 and 16, 1903. Galicia was the locale not only because the traffic in prostitution was actively carried on there, but thanks also to the political emancipation under Hapsburg rule which, unlike Russia, permitted public meetings and conferences to be held readily. Such notables attended as Paul Nathan (1857-1926), head of the Hilfs- verein, the Austrian Reichsrat member for Galicia Emil Byk (1845-1906), lawyer and politician, and Gustav Tuch (1834-1909) of Hamburg, poly- math, economist, poet, and lawyer. One representative came from England, the Rev. Simeon Singer. Rabbi Rosenak, Bertha Pappenheim, and numer- ous communal officials, leaders, and antiprostitution activists were also present, and the event was open to the general public. But the most signifi- cant personalities, for the sake of whose presence the conference was held in Eastern Europe, were rabbis of Galicia. Two rabbis of Lemberg attended, Isaac Schmelkes (1828-1906), one of the foremost respondents (poseqim) of the age, and Ezekiel Caro (1845-1915), a Germanic modernist and his- 125.

The former's nephew, Rabbi Gedaliah Schmelkes (1857-1928) of Kolomea, somewhat a modernist although an old-fashioned rabbi in exter- nals, also came.127 Cracow sent the Westernized Rabbi Osias Thon (1870-1937) and the traditional Rabbi Hayyim Aryeh Horowitz (1851-1904). Others included Rabbis Schnur (b. 1858) of Tarnow, Lilienfeld of Podheitz, and Jacob Nacht (b. 1873) of Focsani in Rumania. No Hasidic rabbi was present. Emil Byk opened the proceedings with the hope "that East and West may work together beneficially. Then the East will learn, and the West will understand better and forgive the conditions in the East." Gustav Tuch explained the methods employed by the traffickers, and Rabbi Rosenak next spoke of the necessity of cultivating work habits, improving the Jewish school, and limiting the rush to emigrate. Simeon Singer presented a letter from Lady Rothschild (wife of Lord Rothschild) which urged rabbis and others to impress upon parents not to allow their daughters to emigrate "without any positive knowledge of their destination or future." He regret- ted "the backward state of female education and training" in Galicia. Then Meier Munk of Lemberg proposed in detail an organization to protect women and girls. The discussion which followed included expressions of dis- sent which exemplified the sensitivities of East European Jews facing the West. Rabbis Caro and Horowitz disputed the need for an organization devoted to moral improvement, which must have seemed to them Western condescension. Horowitz attacked the view, which he presumably detected in what had been said, that Galician Jews were morally inferior. To the pro- longed applause of the meeting, he assailed the foreign intruders. The rabbi of Cracow also saw no need for the association mooted by Munk, "particu- larly since it is still in doubt whether there are really such traffickers in this country." Nevertheless, the idea of protecting girls proved acceptable to the assemblage. General improvements such as Rabbi Rosenak advocated, which were offered as a long-range preventive to prostitution, implied changes in the traditional way of life, and were not taken up. Horowitz acknowledged that poverty lowered moral standards, while noting that there were also daughters of the rich who "go the evil way." He urged there- fore that the sale of erotic literature be prevented. Rabbi Gedalia Schmelkes desired that rabbis have a voice in the projected society to combat the traffic 127.

GARTNER and also in the policy of the Yiddish newspaper whose establishment was suggested. The conference concluded with a series of detailed resolutions, declaring its determination to uproot Jewish manifestations of the pernicious traffic, which existed only because of the extreme impoverishment of Galician Jewry. It was also agreed that prevention required a network of institutions for welfare and education. Besides such general statements the Lemberg conference expressed satisfaction that branches of the local Jildische Verein- igung zum Schutze von Maidchen und Frauen-a literal translation of the London society's name-would be established throughout Galicia. Bertha Pappenheim urged that each branch have a women's auxiliary. Rabbi Rosenak proposed a Yiddish newspaper whose policies the rabbis would control, and the inspection of Jewish educational institutions in order to raise their standards. He joined Singer in urging rabbis to shun the shtile khupe. Rabbi Gedaliah Schmelkes proposed that Galician Jews be coun- seled that turning traffickers over to the police was not at all a transgression of informing against a fellow-Jew, but was really an act of religious merit. The closing reception was enlivened by verbal sparring between Zionists and their opponents.'28 The Lemberg conference succeeded in the only sphere which could really succeed in Galicia, that of publicizing the traffic and the means it employed to lure girls. Larger projects of education and welfare lay beyond the resources of Galician Jewry and would have probably become enmeshed in controversy among the conflicting outlooks. Several years passed before the next conference. Meanwhile, the network of protective societies expanded in the west, but Eastern Europe remained weakly organized while Jewish emigration reached unprecedented propor- tions. The last conclave before the first World War, and the most compre- hensive and fully attended, took place in London at the call of the Gentle- men's Committee of the Jewish Association for the Protection of Girls and Women. It met privately on April 5, 6, and 7, 1910, and was attended by eighty-two London delegates'29 and sixteen from the Provinces, as well as "a large number" of institutional representatives and subscribers to the Jewish Association. Foreign delegates numbered twenty-seven, ten of whom came from Germany, and merely five from Eastern Europe. The latter 128.

No effort had to be made at this conference to persuade anyone that the problem existed, and that the traffic among Jews ought to be suppressed by Jews.130 A detailed agenda was presented, and each session had its theme which was stated as a question. The first session dealt with "means ... to ascertain the extent of the participation by Jews and Jewesses in the traffic." The following session took up "the causes of the traffic among Jews" and means of checking the traffic at seaports and at international borders, as well as cooperation between Jewish and general bodies in the field. "Illegal Marriages and Divorces," "The Marriage Broker ('Shadchan')," and "Advertisements re: Situations" were included within the third topic, which dealt with "the lack of responsibility of parents and guardians," marriages which were im- prudent or not in accord with the law of the land, and the need for parents and guardians to make "strict enquiries concerning situations abroad." The fourth session took up the arousal of Jewish public opinion against the traf- fic including "ineligibility of those concerned in the traffic to hold com- munal offices." Finally, it was asked "how far can education and social work be helpful" in view of the role of "bad economic conditions [as] an undoubted source of the Traffic. ... ."'3' The discussion was of high, informed quality. The British emphasized social and educational work and recreation for working girls, as well as criminal penalties for traffickers. The German speakers appear to lay emphasis on reaching Eastern European Jewry. The conference declined to set up an international Jewish association, but the lines of communication were extended and tightened. Anglo-Jewry's primacy in the antiprostitution field was confirmed, because of its institutional strength and the com- munity's connections overseas. Thus, a delegate from the United States came for the first time. She was Sadie American of the National Council of Jewish Women, who brought with her memoranda from other Americans in the field. After three days of deliberations the delegates returned home to their local efforts. Besides Jewish conferences, Jews also attended international gatherings 130. Israel Zangwill, representing the Jewish Territorial Organization, did inquire why a distinct Jewish effort was required, and Claude G. Montefiore replied that "the evil has also a special Jewish side" and there was close collaboration with general organizations which were functioning in the field.

After Chief Rabbi Hermann Adler died in 1911, his successor Joseph H. Hertz followed Adler's habit and attended the 1913 congress. Those accustomed to Adler's caution and restraint must have been startled when Hertz, speaking after the archbishop of Canterbury and the Catholic primate to offer the usual clerical greetings which opened these conclaves, vehemently denounced the Russian regime, which permitted Jewish girls to settle as students in St. Petersburg outside the Pale of Settle- ment only if they accepted the yellow ticket of the prostitute. The police compelled them actually to act as prostitutes.'32 With the outbreak of war one year later every plan was altered and the international traffic stopped. When the war ended new social and political conditions greatly changed the earlier picture. Our understanding of this whole slimy business would in no way be improved by ready reference to "the world's oldest profession," and hardly any more so by pieties about "the breakdown of Jewish family life." Grant- ing the universality of sexual drives and the Jewish ideal of sexual purity and family fidelity, the necessity remains of explaining why the traffic in Jewish prostitution flourished when it did, despite intensive efforts to uproot it in England and the ostracism placed upon everyone who was involved in it. We should emphasize the exceptionally difficult social situation which prevailed in the heyday of the great Jewish migration and for some time after it. Vast Jewish population increase and profound poverty in Eastern Europe meant great strain and suffering in families, while the existence of lands of promise to the west made the desire to escape and better oneself possible of realization. Finding economic security and personal identity in the new lands placed an unbearable burden upon many individuals, espe- cially those who came from families which were broken, temporarily or per- manently, in the course of migration. In the interstices between departing and arriving, between uprooting and settlement, piercing shafts of light are shed upon the harshness and the instability within Jewish social life. Unscru- pulous, sadistic individuals sought large profits. Lonely, discontented, or unloved young women sought security and love. Their deluded quest brought them only debasement and misery.
