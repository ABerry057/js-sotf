Etudes sur le Judaisme m6di6val, vol. 14. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1992. xvii, 359 pp.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 217 The book under review is a revised version of the author's 1987 doctoral dissertation, "Judeo-Arabic, Written and Spoken in Egypt in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries," written at the University of California at Berkeley under the guidance of Arabist William Brinner and Semitist Ariel Bloch. It is largely an edition and translation of Megillat Purfm il-Misriyyfn, the Purim Scroll of the Cairene Jewish Community, written in 1524 in commemoration of the deliverance of Cairene Jewry from the hands of Ahmad Pasha, the ruler of Egypt. The text has come down to us in two versions: A (edited on pp. 133-215), and B, Hebrew only, with the Judeo-Arabic translation not yet found (pp. 217-239). The most important part of the book, in my view, is the reevaluation of the (socio)linguistic concept of diglossia, using instead the notion of "multiglossia." Hary delves into the minutiae of much of the scholarly literature on diglossia.1 This is certainly an appropriate place for me to react to his commentary on my "Remarks on Diglossia in Arabic: Well-Defined vs. Ill-Defined" (1972), a slightly revised version of a paper, "Modem Standard Arabic and the Colloquials" (1970). Hary states: "It is difficult, however, to observe the uniformity that Kaye claims to see in the Arabic dialects. He assumes that the dialects have well-defined rules, certainly more defined than Modem Standard Arabic, but the dialects have their own features or [sic] linguistic variations, too, and their rules are not that 'well-defined"' (p. 7). Firstly, what I said was that the Arabic colloquial dialects are all native tongues, whereas Modem Standard Arabic is not anyone's native language. In fact, Modem Standard Arabic actually depends on the nature of the native colloquial acquired (e.g., in matters of stress), and some Arabs have little or no command of the standard language at all. Hary alludes to the essence of the problem (not really properly addressed in his theoretical model) because he further states that "some native speakers master Modem Standard Arabic better than others" (ibid.). What about the Moroccan fallah or the Sudanese Arab villager who has not mastered it at all because, as Hary correctly maintains, "Modern Standard Arabic is acquired through formal education" (p. 8)? Since my space here is limited, let me refer the reader to an article expounding some of my current thinking on the Arabic speech 1.

Chapter 2 (the second-most-important part of the book) discusses the beginning of Arabic multiglossia (pp. 29-47) by considering parallel de- velopments in other Semitic languages; the Arabic koined theory developed by Charles A. Ferguson (1959), but not called this herein (pp. 33-34); and Kees Versteegh's controversial pidginization-creolization theory (1984). The latter, rejected by most scholars, is called "challenging" (p. 40), is said to contain "new notions" (p. 46), and is suggested as a possible theory for some other Semitic languages, "perhaps through a process of pidginization and creolization" (ibid.). I remain pessimistic, however, that the modern Arabic dialects developed through the pidgin-creole cycle.3 Chapter 3 is on Middle Arabic (pp. 49-69). Although Hary states that the terms used in Middle Arabic scholarship are "inadequate" (p. 55), and "insufficient, inappropriate, and inconsistent" (p. 69), I am not sure that the final word has yet been written in this complicated arena. Hary would do well to consider Wolfdietrich Fischer's excellent "What Is Middle Arabic?"4 Chapter 4, on Judeo-Arabic (pp. 71-114), is a nice summary of well- known material (the name of Joshua Blau, one of Hary's undergraduate teachers, readily comes to mind here as the leading specialist). The next part of the tome presents the grammar and linguistic background of the Megillah. I found the treatment of the orthography and phonetics competent (pp. 247-270); however, Hary does not firmly establish that the orthography proves that "the sound shiftj&gt;g was in progress" (p. 257). Could it be the case that writing the jim as a dotted gimel or an undotted one has to do not so much with actual sound change per se, but rather with the nature of the speech continuum and various stylistic factors, such as prestige, formality, 2.

Is it not also possible that a scribe just forgot to dot the gimel in at least a few instances (cf. dotting the i in English)? The aforementioned remarks should not be interpreted to mean that the book under review is not a good one. It is a very solid work, carefully researched, with an excellent bibliography (pp. 327-345). The Hebrew and Arabic fonts used in the tome are elegant, and Brill is certainly to be congratulated on a superb-looking book. Also, there are remarkably few typographical errors for such an intricate subject matter. Alan S. Kaye California State University at Fullerton Fullerton, Calif.</page></plain_text>
