New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1998, xvi, 304 pp. Anyone who was personally privileged to meet the late J. H. Hertz, as was this reviewer from time to time in his student days, could not fail to be conscious of being in the presence of greatness. Short in natural height, he was a man of im- pressive stature. A commanding personality, he was easily the most outstanding individual ever to occupy the exalted position of chief rabbi of the British Empire (1913-46). He was courageous, energetic, eloquent, and determined, and he left an indelible impression on English-speaking Jewry. He bequeathed enduring, liv- ing monuments in the form of his Book of Jewish Thought (1917), his Commen- tary on the Torah and Haftorahs (1929-36), and his Commentary on the Prayer Book (1942-45), apart from numerous essays and addresses. As the Torah writes of Moses, "his hands were steady until the setting of the sun" (Exod. 17:12). Dr. Meirovich's study concentrates on the Commentary to the Pentateuch, or, more specifically, on its general style, arrangement, organization, and con- stituent elements, and on the factors that weighed upon Hertz in editing it. 399</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review The first chapter, entitled "Intellectual Roots, Theological Objectives," details the influences that swayed the young Hertz as a student at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, particularly those of Sabato Morais and Alexander Kohut. Although Hertz graduated in 1894, whereas Solomon Schechter did not take over JTS until 1904, it is clear that the writings of Schechter, too, exerted an influence upon him. On becoming British chief rab- bi, Hertz found himself confronted with contemporary Christian anti-Jewish bib- lical scholarship, which was strongly swayed by Julius Wellhausen's reconstruc- tion of Israelite history and religion. Schechter had called it the "Higher anti-Semitism," and had urged the production of a distinctly Jewish commentary on the Bible. Hertz also faced the activities of Claude Goldsmith Montefiore, the outspoken and prolific scholarly leader of so-called Liberal Judaism in England. The second chapter of this book, entitled "Inspiration and Perspiration," evalu- ates the impact that all the foregoing had on Hertz's plan and formulation of his commentary on the Pentateuch, and on his trials and tribulations in the initial ef- fort to execute it. The third chapter, "Biblical Criticism," discusses in greater detail the Chris- tian scholarly onslaught on the Mosaic authorship of the Torah, and the compara- tive study of the religion of Israel with that of the pagan ancient Semites. Following is a chapter on "Hebraism and Hellenism" in which Meirovich shows how Hertz harshly denigrated the latter's morality and emphasized the con- sequent baneful influence of Hellenism upon Christianity and the Christian world of the West. Chapter Five, "Aspects of a Jewish Theology," constitutes a reconstruction of Hertz's main points and a critical review of his tendencies to explain away the shortcomings and character-blemishes of biblical heroes and to smooth over the clear instances of cruelty and barbarism occasionally found in the biblical narra- tives. In the final chapter, "Achievement and Impact," Meirovich reports on Hertz's lamenting the initial poor response to his volume on Genesis, the sluggish sales, and the lack of support from Conservative and Orthodox rabbis. This pa- thetic reception evaporated with the appearance of the one-volume edition of the entire Pentateuch. A drastic lowering of its price boosted sales in the postwar years, but Hertz was then no longer alive. A summary of critical reviews follows. Censorious comments took note of Hertz's use of the King James English translation of the Bible instead of the 1917 Jewish Publication Society version. This, however, was an unfair criticism, because Hertz had made strenuous ef- forts, unsuccessfully, to utilize the latter. More to the point was the condemna- tion of the chief rabbi's affinity for glossing over problematic verses, his sim- plistic rationalizations, his selective use of non-Jewish sources, and particularly his tendency to cite the supportive testimony of non-Jews. His obvious bias against Christianity and Hellenism also drew the attention of some critical re- viewers. Meirovich may be congratulated for producing a painstaking, thoroughly re- searched, and impressive study, exceptionally well written. The notes to each chap- ter are invaluable and reveal a wealth of learning and scholarly erudition meticu- 400</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews lously documented.
