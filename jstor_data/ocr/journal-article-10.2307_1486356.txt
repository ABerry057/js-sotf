<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ART OF METOPOSCOPY: A STUDY IN ISAAC LURIA'S CHARISMATIC KNOWLEDGE by LAWRENCE FINE Amongst the most important roles which Isaac Luria (1534-1572), the preeminent kabbalist of sixteenth-century Safed, played in the lives of his disciples was that of physician of the soul. Before they could practice rituals which were intended to enable them to bind their souls to the divine realm, and to "repair" that realm in accordance with the teachings of Lurianic mythology, his disciples had first to mend their own souls, to cleanse and purify them of all imperfection.' No individual whose own soul had failed to achieve a certain level of perfection could hope to engage successfully in the 1. The major exposition of Lurianic mythology is by I. Tishby, Torat ha-Ra ve-ha-Kelippah be-Kabbalat ha-Ari (Jerusalem, 1960). See also idem, "Gnostic Doctrines in Sixteenth Century Jewish Mysticism," Journal of Jewish Studies 6 (1955); G.

A person had to undergo a period during which he cultivated certain spiritual and moral traits and atoned for whatever sins he might have committed. Luria, in fact, provided his followers with highly detailed rituals of atonement by which they were to mend their souls. These penitential acts were known as tikkunei avonot ("amends of sin") whose purpose, in the words of IHayyim Vital's son Shmuel, was to "mend his soul" and "cleanse him from the filth of the disease of his sins."3 IHayyim Vital (1542-1620), Luria's chief disciple, himself introduces the tikkunei avonot with a dis- cussion of the relationship between one's soul and sin.4 The following passage provides a lucid account of the Lurianic theory of sin and the effectiveness of genuine repentance: Man is created from matter and from form, which consists of soul [nefesh], spirit [ruah], and super-soul [neshamah], the divine portion from above, as it is said: "and [God] breathed into his nostrils the breath [nishmat] of life" [Gen. 2:7]. And his body is dark matter from the side of the "shell," luring and preventing man from [achieving] perfection of his soul [in order] to cut it [i.e., his soul] off from the Tree of Life .... and so "there is not a righteous man upon the earth that doeth good and sinneth not" [Eccles. 7:20]. It is known that sin is a blemish, stain, and rust in the soul, and that it is the sickness of the pure soul. When it [is immersed] in filth and stain, it is unable to perceive and achieve the true perfection, which is [attainment of] the mysteries of the Torah.... And the transgression becomes a barrier separating the soul from her Creator, preventing her from perceiving and comprehending holy and pure supernal matters, as it is said: "The law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul" [Ps. 19:8].... When the soul is pure and unblemished, then the supernal holy matters take shape in her, and when she dwells in rust and stain everything becomes bittersweet [i.e., evil appears as good]. [This is] similar to the sick person who, when he is ill, abhors the good things and loves things which aggravate his 2. For a detailed study of the Yihzudim, see L.

The doctor, in order to restore his health, gives him spices, including gall, by which his nature will return to what it originally was, and his health as before. So, too, the sick soul, to remove the sickness from her, must receive the bitterness of medicine and "return" in [the form of] mortification and fasts, sackcloth, ashes, and stripes, ritual immersions, and purifications from filth and the stains of sin. [This is] in order to be able to attain and comprehend supernal matters, which are the mysteries of the world.5 Only the weapons of ascetic piety are potent enough to cleanse the soul of the filth that clings to it. Luria himself, proclaims Vital, is the diagnosti- cian and healer of diseased souls! Luria's powers stem from the spirit of prophecy which he possessed, meriting him divine light and esoteric knowl- edge with which to teach his followers. But Luria only revealed his knowledge to those disciples who were completely pure and worthy. To this end he prescribed for each of his students personalized penitential deeds to meet their specific needs. He would not reveal any of the mysteries of this holy knowledge to one in whose soul he perceived, with the aid of the Holy Spirit, a blemish-until he gave him penitential acts to straighten out all he did crookedly. And like the expert doctor who prescribes for each sick person the proper medicine to cure this illness, so too [Isaac Luria], may he rest in peace, used to recognize the sin, tell him where he had incurred a blemish, and prescribe for him the peniten- tial act needed for this transgression in order to cleanse his soul, so that he could receive the divine light, as it is written: "O Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved" [Jer. 4:14].6 Isaac Luria did what any good physician would do; he carefully diagnosed the specific maladies which his "patient" had and prescribed the appropriate cure. Among the several diagnostic techniques which Luria had at his disposal, according to Hayyim Vital and others, the most important appears to have been his capacity to discern and interpret the meaning of Hebrew letters visible upon an individual's forehead, a variation on the medieval art known as metoposcopy. Metoposcopy was one of the wide array of divinatory or mantic arts practiced especially in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, along with 5. Sha'ar Ruah ha-Kodesh of the Shemonah She'arim, p. 39 (hereafter cited as SRH). 6. SRH, p. 40.</page><page sequence="4">82 LAWRENCE FINE similar arts such as chiromancy (palmistry) and physiognomy (form and shape of various other physical features, particularly facial features). As with these other "sciences," metoposcopy was employed for purposes of judging an individual's character and personality, and in many cases, for predicting one's future. As Jewish sources themselves attest, a variation of this art was known at least as early as late antiquity, but it flourished in the Middle Ages and most especially in the Renaissance. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the publication of metoposcopic works proliferated. Like chiromancy, metoposcopy was primarily concerned with the signifi- cance of lines, in this case, on the forehead, and was typically associated with astrological notions.' The purpose of the present study is to examine the theory and practice of metoposcopy according to Lurianic teachings, and, more broadly, to explore the ways in which Luria's disciples regarded this type of knowledge on their master's part. In the various lists detailing Isaac Luria's extraordinary abilities with which our sources provide us, one of the standard items is his skill at metoposcopy. Concerning his attainments, it is impossible for one to relate them [even] in general terms, no less in detail. However, these are the wondrous and true things which I witnessed with my own eyes: He knew how to make a future soul appear before him, as well as the soul of a living or deceased person, from among the early as well as later sages. He could inquire of them whatever he wished concerning knowledge of the future and secret mysteries of the Torah. The prophet Elijah, may his memory be a blessing, would also appear to him and teach him. He could also recognize the letters on the forehead and [was adept at] the science of physiognomy, as well as at [recognizing] the lights that are upon the skin and body of an individual. [He was also skilled at recog- 7. For treatments of non-Jewish approaches to metoposcopy, see L. Thorndike, A History of Magic and Experimental Science (New York, 1923-58), especially vols. 6-8; K.

[He understood] even the speech of inanimate things, as Scripture says: "For the stone shall cry out of the wall [and the beam out of the timber shall answer it]" [Hab. 2:11]. [He knew] the language of the burning candle and the flaming coal; he was able to see the angels who announce all the proclamations [from on high], as is well known, and to converse with them. His knowledge was expert concerning all the plants and the genuine remedies [which they provided]. There are many other such things which cannot even be related. Those who hear of them will not believe them when told. I have recorded that which my eyes have seen in all truth.8 The theoretical basis for the recognition of letters upon the forehead (.hokhmat ha-par;uf) has to do with a set of kabbalistic beliefs concerning the relationship between language and creation as a whole. These beliefs go back, in part, to the first systematic attempt at speculative thought in Hebrew, the Sefer Yetirah, probably written sometime between the third and sixth centuries.' According to the opening chapter of this brief and highly enigmatic book, God brought all of creation into existence "by means of thirty-two wondrous paths of wisdom." These thirty-two paths comprise "ten sefirot beli mah," the ten fundamental numbers, and the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The bulk of the book's specula- tive efforts concern the function and role of these letters in the process of cosmogony. Everything that exists came into being through combinations of the alphabet's letters, particularly by means of two hundred and thirty-one "gates," combinations of the letters into sets of two in which every letter of the alphabet is joined to every other. All existence is invested with these different combinations of letters and is nourished by their power. When, centuries later, medieval kabbalists appropriated the ideas of the Sefer Ye;irah, this linguistically founded world was understood as an 8. SRH, p. 19. Other versions of this list are found in Sefer ha-Gilgulim (Przemysl, 1875), p. 26; Shivhei ha-Ari (Bardejov, 1929), pp. 6-7; Sefer Toledot ha-Ari, ed. M.

According to this concep- tion, the Hebrew letters and their combinations are not merely instruments by which the Creator wrought creation, but forms assumed by the divine itself. That is, not only can the revelation of deity be described in terms of the ten sefirot, the most familiar and typical symbolic system of the kabbalists, but it can be imagined as well as the ever unfolding word of God which expresses itself in a virtually infinite variety of combinations and gradations. In this symbolism the Torah is understood to comprise a vast network of "names," each of which signifies a particular concentration of divine power or energy. As such these "names" possess a plenitude of meaning not exhausted by conventional human language. Nowhere is the divine/linguistic constitution of all creation more evident than in the case of human beings themselves. According to HIayyim Vital, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet are present in each of the three aspects of the human soul, in ascending hierarchical order, nefesh, ruab, and neshamah. 0 Each is constructed, so to speak, on the basis of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The character and quality of each set of letters are some- what different in accordance with the different levels of the soul's tripartite division. The letters present in the nefesh are small, those of the ruab are medium in size, and those of the neshamah are largest of all. These three dimensions of soul clothe one another, as it were, with the body's skin constituting the outer covering of all. In the case of a wicked individual, the lights/letters of the soul remain covered and concealed by the skin. But when a person perfects himself by practicing the commandments and study- ing the Torah, he gradually purifies the various parts of soul, thus enabling the power and light of the letters within each part to come to the surface. 10. SRH, p. 16. This idea is already found in the Zohar, in the context of its discussion of physiognomic matters. See, for example, Zohar 2, 73a, where we learn that the mystery of the twenty-two letters is engraved within the ruah of an individual, and that these letters can appear on the face. According to the anthropological views of the Kabbalah, the soul is considered to have three aspects. The nefesh is automatically present and active in every individual; the two more elevated levels, however, are latent. These manifest themselves only in the case of persons who are spiritually advanced and who have strived to develop themselves through religious activity. Such activity aids in the cultivation of the higher powers of cognition and results in the fullest maturation of the soul. Later kabbalists-including the Lurianists-added two other levels of soul. These are hayyah and yehidah, and are considered to represent still higher stages of spiritual attainment, present only in the most select figures. These two aspects of soul do not figure in the Lurianic discussion of metoposcopy.</page><page sequence="7">THE ART OF METOPOSCOPY 85 The letters are unveiled and manifest themselves in a way which is visible to the skilled eye. The appearance of the letters on the skin allows one who can recognize them and determine their meaning virtually to see the divine part of the human personality, the soul itself. One "sees" the soul in the sense that the letters are a relatively material expression of that which is otherwise immaterial. In the case of one who has sufficiently mended all three grades of soul, the entire alphabet belonging to each grade will appear, at one time or another, on the body's skin, most especially upon the forehead." According to Vital, the forehead discloses the soul's letters best of all, due, in part, to the fact that the letters of the alphabet as a whole correspond to the sefirah Binah, which, in turn, is symbolized by the forehead."2 The 11. SRH, pp. 15-16. The primary Lurianic account of metoposcopy is found in SRH, pp. 15-22. The earliest Jewish interest in physiognomy, in general, appears to go back to a Qumran document, published as 4Q 186. According to this text certain physiognomic criteria, such as the size and shape of the thighs, toes, fingers, hair, eyes, beard, teeth, height, and quality of voice, can be examined to ascertain an individual's moral and spiritual status. Such criteria, along with a person's zodiacal sign, were used to determine a person's fitness for membership in the "House of Light," that is, the righteous among Israel. Concerning this, see Discoveries in the Judean Desert, vol. 5, Qumran Cave 4, ed. J. M. Allegro (Oxford, 1968), pp. 89-91. Physiognomic considerations play little role in conventional rabbinic materials, but were of great interest to the Merkavah mystics. As in the Qumran text, the Merkavah literature indi- cates that physiognomic criteria were employed to determine eligibility for admission into the circle of mystics. These criteria have to do with the character of the nose, lips, eyes, eyebrows, eyelashes, and sexual organs, although greatest significance was attached to the lines and letters upon the palm and forehead. These texts already speak, albeit in an unsystematic and exceed- ingly obscure way, of certain letters which appear on the hand and forehead. The primary text in this connection is Hakkarat Panim le-Rabbi Yishmael, which speaks of twelve letters that are visible on the forehead, although it does not specify which letters these are. This chapter and related materials are analyzed in two articles by G. Scholem, "Hakkarat Panim ve-Sidrei Sirtutin," in Sefer Assaf (Jerusalem, 1953), pp. 459-495 (see particularly, pp. 481-485), and "Ein Fragment zur Physiognomik und Chiromantic aus der Spatantiken judischen Esoteric," in Liber Amicorum: Studies in Honor of Professor Dr. C. J. Bleeker (Leiden, 1969); see also idem, "Chiromancy," in Scholem's Kabbalah (Jerusalem, 1974), pp. 317-319; I. Gruenwald, "Ketaim .Hadashim mi-Sifrut Hakkarat Panim ve-Sidrei Sirtutin," Tarbiz 40 (1971): 301-319; idem, Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism (Leiden, 1980), pp. 218-224. The most extensive treatment of physiognomy, chiromancy, and metoposcopy in medieval Jewish literature, prior to the Lurianic texts, is found in the zoharic corpus. Concerning this, see below, n. 12. 12. SRH, pp. 15-16. While the Lurianic notions of metoposcopy described here do not appear to have any direct link to the material found in the Merkavah literature (see above, n. 11), they are unmistakably indebted, at least to some degree, to the fairly extensive discussions in the zoharic corpus. The literature of the Zohar treats physiognomic, chiromantic, and metoposcopic issues in several places, including: (1) Zohar 2, 71a-78a (along with the parallel version in Raza de-Razin); (2) Zohar 2, 272b-276a; (3) Zohar Iadash 35b-37c; and (4) Tikkunei Zohar, tikkun 70. These speculations are based, in part, on exegesis of Exodus 18:21.</page><page sequence="8">86 LAWRENCE FINE particular letters which appear on a person's forehead depend upon the commandments which that individual performs properly. For there is a letter to correspond to each and every precept (although we are informed about only a few of the details of this correspondence). Thus, the person who performs all the commandments on a regular basis, and in whom there is no sin, will bear all the letters upon his forehead. Certain letters, however, will appear more brightly than at other times under various conditions. When one performs particular mi;vot, the appropriate letters shine especial- ly brightly on that same day. Sometimes a certain word-such as the word bayyim (signaling that a person can expect to continue in life)-will appear briefly and then disappear. One skilled in this art, then, must be careful to gaze at the right time upon an individual's forehead. An exception is the deed of charity (;edakah), whose letters remain shining brightly upon one's forehead for an entire week. This is demonstrated by the scriptural text: "And his righteousness [;idkato] endureth forever" (Ps. 111:3). The level of soul which one has achieved is also discernible on the basis of the size of the letters which appear. Thus, if a person has only perfected the level of nefesh, the letters will be small, and so on. If an individual mani- fests only one set of letters, having attained only the level of nefesh, and more than one of a particular letter is required to spell out a word on his forehead, the letter will initially appear brightly in one place in the word, and reappear a second or third time as needed. The letters of the alphabet also possess a sefirotic correspondence. That is, it is possible to identify different letters with each of the ten sefirot. By While I plan to analyze these materials elsewhere, it is worth noting here certain substantial differences between the Zohar's discussions and the Lurianic one: (1) Whereas the Zohar treats in some detail the several subjects of physiognomy, chiromancy, and metoposcopy-discussing the significance of the hair, forehead, eyes, face, lips, lines on the hand, and the ears-Luria was almost exclusively concerned with metoposcopy, that is, the forehead. He takes up other matters in the most passing way. (2) The Zohar's analysis of metoposcopy is mostly concerned with the shape of the forehead and with the lines or creases appearing in it, and far less with letters. In Luria's case, on the other hand, there is no discussion of anything but the letters and words which manifest themselves. (3) Whereas the Zohar's discussion incorporates elements of astrological speculation, the Lurianic account has only the briefest passing reference to this (see SRH, p. 16) and is clearly not genuinely concerned with astrology. (4) The Zohar tends to indicate how physical characteristics, such as the shape of the forehead or eyes, signify certain moral and spiritual traits in general ways. Thus, for example, a person is said to be inclined toward anger, impulsiveness, or joyfulness. In our texts, Luria is able to determine the specific sins or righteous acts which a person has performed.</page><page sequence="9">THE ART OF METOPOSCOPY 87 virtue of this one can ascertain the sefirotic root of a person's soul, for the appropriate letters will appear more frequently than the others.'3 The recitation of the one hundred berakhot (blessings) required daily of every individual also induces the manifestation of letters.14 For just as the 613 mi;vot as a whole have their corresponding letters, so too do the berakhot that one recites, such as in the course of daily prayer. The lights of the letters which appear on the skin as a result of reciting berakhot are special insofar as there is light surrounding each letter; this surrounding light is more luminescent than that of the letter itself. If one sees that the opposite is the case, that the light of the letter is more intense than the surrounding light, it signals that the blessing was not performed properly. Moreover, if one fails to perform certain berakhot altogether, their corresponding letters do not appear at all. If a berakhah is recited with a mistake, then the letter will appear but will be incomplete or imperfectly formed. And if it is per- formed correctly, but without appropriate contemplative intention, the letter will be present, but will be dark and unillumined. If the appearance of letters signifies virtuous behavior, then their absence indicates sinfulness, be it a sin of commission or omission. One who is responsible for some transgression will be lacking in the corresponding letters, which will thereby fail to display themselves on his forehead. Indeed, someone upon whose forehead no letters are discernible can expect to meet his death within thirty days unless he performs acts of great restitution and repentance. 5 There are other indications of the presence of sinfulness, or that some- thing tragic has befallen the individual involved. Sometimes a particular letter will appear broken in the middle. In the case of the letter bet, for example, this indicates that one's son has died. At other times letters may appear upside down or lying on their side. There is one letter, for example, which, if it appears abnormally, indicates that a man has had intercourse with his wife in an improper manner. In this connection, Vital relates an interesting incident. The wife of a certain individual had demanded of him that he engage in intercourse, something which he didn't want to do, since it 13. SRH, p. 17. 14. Ibid., p. 18. According to B.T. Menabot 43b, R. Yose declares it to be the duty of every- one to recite one hundred blessings daily, whereas Numbers Rabbah 18 indicates that King David instituted the one hundred daily blessings. 15. SRH, p. 16.</page><page sequence="10">88 LAWRENCE FINE happened to be a weekday rather than Sabbath, the preferred time for marital love. Luria informed Vital that he had recognized the letter gimel on the man's forehead, but that it appeared upside down. The gimel, Luria told Vital, symbolizes the sefirah Yesod, the sefirah associated with male procrea- tive vitality, human and divine. Insofar as the man involved did not intend to stimulate Yesod by having sex at what he considered to be an improper time, the gimel appeared in this unusual manner. Luria indicated that such an act should not be considered a transgression, despite the fact that it occurred on a weekday. Were it a sin the letter would have been turned upside down, but would not have shone brightly as it did. In general, when a letter manifests itself upside down, it signifies that the realm of the feminine is involved. For this reason, the letters on the forehead of a male whose soul-ancestry (gilgul) derives from the feminine side of the divine structure will consistently appear upside down.16 If a person experiences a nocturnal emission (tumat keri), says Luria, the evidence of his impurity will appear on his forehead the following day. If he seeks to cleanse himself of this impurity through ritual immersion in water, then the evidence will remain during the day but will be only mildly visible. However, if he does not undergo ritual immersion, the sin will be discernible until he does so. The transgressions of a person who, by virtue of other deeds he has carried out, merits the "extra" soul which people can acquire on the Sabbath, will not be visible upon the forehead during the course of the Sabbath itself. This is due to the fact that the powers of evil have no potency on the Sabbath. The very presence of the additional Sabbath soul can be determined by gazing upon the forehead. For as soon as one performs the ritual immersion required as preparation for the Sabbath, the extra Sabbath soul manifests itself, the evidence for which is found upon his forehead. Interestingly, we learn that scholars of the Torah experience a special kind of dispensation. If a person is a great scholar of Torah, and particularly if he is a student of Kabbalah (hokhmat ha-emet), his study has the effect of covering over the sins for which he is responsible, providing that they are minor transgressions. In such instances, one's sins are not visible upon the forehead." If, however, they are significant sins, then they will be discerni- ble, scholarly merit notwithstanding. 16. Ibid., p. 17. 17. Ibid., p. 22.</page><page sequence="11">THE ART OF METOPOSCOPY 89 In this connection, HIayyim Vital indicated that there were limitations to his master's abilities to diagnose the status of the soul on the basis of metoposcopy. At times he had to resort to more direct communication with an individual's soul. He possessed another kind of skill; he could call forth the nefesh, ru'ah, or neshamah of an individual, and speak with it [directly]. He would inquire of it and ask it questions, and it would answer whatever it was he desired to know, even including matters of detail. He told me that there are some things which he is unable to discern when he gazes upon the letters of the forehead, due to their being too subtle and concealed. However, when he inquires and searches out a person's soul [directly], then he is able to learn things with great accura- cy and clarity.'8 While the forehead was the most common place for the materialization of the soul's letters, they could appear on any part of the body. "Know that in each and every organ of a person's body, there are letters engraved, informing us about that individual's actions. But the primary place is the forehead, as indicated earlier." "9 In addition, other parts of the body have special features which are instructive with respect to one's conduct and character, especially the eyes, fingernails, and all types of bodily hair. In the case of hair, for example, color, length, type of hair, and the way that it lies, all are clues to a person's status, although we are provided no details about this. There are a substantial number of anecdotal reports by Vital and other Safed scholars about Isaac Luria's practice of the art of metoposcopy. Such evidence clearly suggests that Luria actually engaged in this activity, and that it was not merely a matter for theoretical discussion. Moses Galante, for example, writes that he had personally seen sages who had the ability to practice the art of "determining [the letters on] the countenance." 20 Similar- 18. Ibid., p. 17. 19.

Berakhot 58a]. In Safed, located in the upper Galilee, there have already appeared sages for whom it was appropriate to recite this blessing. They were capable of practicing the art of physiognomy [bokhmat ha-parguJ] and were able to inform a man concerning all that he had done-whether it was good or evil. To be sure, these individuals did not merit this wonderful wisdom (which is akin to possessing the Holy Spirit) except on account of their virtuous deeds and saintly behavior.21 There can be little doubt that both Galante and de Vidas had in mind Isaac Luria, although it is interesting to note that each of them implies that there may have been others with this skill. Eleazar Azikri preserves a story bearing upon Luria's knowledge of metoposcopy in his Sefer .Haredim.22 Azikri reports that Luria once gazed upon the face of a certain sage and told him that "the transgression of cruelty toward animals is inscribed upon your countenance." The distressed man returned home to discover that his wife had failed to feed their turkeys and had left them to wander in the street. After making sure that his wife took corrective action to care properly for the animals he came again before Luria. Without knowing what had taken place, Luria informed him, upon looking into his face, that the transgression had been expiated. The sage then proceeded to tell Luria what had tran- spired. Vital reports an incident in which Luria gazed upon the forehead of a certain sage and informed him that in his entire life this man had never recited a certain prayer correctly.23 Elsewhere, we learn in more general terms that Luria "used to recognize, upon the forehead of a man, the virtuous deeds and the sins which he had committed or had contemplated committing. He knew the gravity of the injury brought about by each transgression, where [on high] the harm had its impact, and the nature of the harm. He [also] knew the restitution that 21.

He would provide each and every individual with the means of atonement in accordance with the sin he had committed."24 Our sources also indicate that Luria utilized his skill for a purpose other than determining a person's moral status, although even here the soul's per- fection was at issue. In Sha'ar ha-Gilgulim Vital writes that every single evening his master would gaze upon the face of each of his disciples. He would see a scriptural verse shining upon the forehead; the visualized verse was one that pertained to that particular student's soul, in accordance with the Lurianic notion that every soul possesses interpretations of Scripture that are unique to it. Luria would then partially explain the esoteric meaning of the verse, in terms of the significance that it held for that individual's spiritual condition. The disciple was then instructed to concentrate upon the explanation he had been given, and to recite the verse before going to sleep. He did this so that when his soul ascended to the upper realm during sleep, he might gain full knowledge of the verse's meaning. In such a way the individual's soul would increase in purity, and ascend to still higher levels in the divine realm, where it would enjoy the revelation of additional mysteries of the Torah.25 Elsewhere Vital describes this activity in a somewhat different way. Luria would gaze upon the forehead of each student after sunset, and deter- mine what kind of text his soul would study that night when it ascended on high, be it some rabbinic work such as the Mishnah, or an esoteric one such as the Zohar. Here too he instructed the disciple to recite this text before falling asleep.26 Vital also preserves several anecdotes in which he himself was involved. On one occasion, he writes, Luria identified the letters alef, bet, and gimel on his forehead. This demonstrated, according to Luria, that Vital needed to show compassion toward his father.27 In a different version of this tradition we learn that the letters alef and bet, spelling out the word av ("father"), were written in normal fashion, while the gimel was upside down.28 24.

Sometime during that Sabbath day Vital became angry while in his house, by reason of which Hezekiah's soul departed. The following week Vital repented for having been angry, where- upon, on the next Sabbath eve, Luria recognized the spirits of both Hezekiah and Rabbi Akiva upon Vital's forehead. Again, however, Vital experienced anger, causing these spirits to leave him. After Vital had wept and repented once again for the sin of anger, Luria informed him that the spirit of Ben Azzai had invested itself in him, despite the fact that Ben Azzai and Vital did not share the same soul-ancestry. Ben Azzai was, however, Akiva's son-in-law. In this story, then, Luria is reported to have been able to determine the coming and going of Vital's visiting souls by gazing on his forehead. It is interesting to observe that in this series of incidents Luria is not said to have determined the deeds for which Vital was responsible, but the effect those deeds had upon his spiritual state. In another entry in his diary, Vital reports a story with a similar theme.30 His teacher is able to explain the meaning of a dream that Vital had by refer- ence to the name of Rami bar Hami, which Luria had seen on Vital's fore- head the evening before. The conclusion Luria reached was that Vital was invested with the soul of this Babylonian amoraic sage. In Sha'ar ha-Mi;vot Vital preserves yet another story, according to which he spoke the name of Samael (i.e., Satan) while conversing with someone at night. The following morning Luria looked at his face and told him that he had violated the pro- hibition against uttering the names of other gods. Writes Vital, "he strictly warned me that under no circumstances, neither during the day nor the night, should I utter Samael's name." To do otherwise can have injurious consequences, causing one to fall prey to sin or to be punished."3 The common feature in these incidents is Isaac Luria's role in bringing to 29.

These reports, along with the ones described earlier, make it clear that Luria did not use this technique for purposes of predicting the future; nowhere are we told that Luria had prophetic knowledge of what was to come. Rather, he employed the art of metoposcopy in order to determine the status of a person's spiritual condition on the basis of his actions. While we cannot know whether the incidents reported here occurred as described, what these stories do tell us is that Luria's practice of this art was sufficiently commonplace for it to be mentioned as a matter of fact. In Vital's case the motivation in narrating these incidents was not to impress the reader with Luria's skill as much as to inform him about Vital himself. The reader could be expected to be familiar with the remarkable wisdom and knowledge which Isaac Luria exhibited. III The accounts by Ijayyim Vital and others concerning Isaac Luria's practice of metoposcopy prompt important questions having to do with the character of Luria's knowledge and the source of his authority. While the present study cannot treat these complex issues in the detail they deserve, even a general discussion of such questions will enable us to place the phenomenon of metoposcopy within a broader Lurianic context. Vital's discussion of the various esoteric skills Luria possessed, and the types of knowledge he exhibited, as seen earlier,32 suggests the way in which Luria's followers regarded these abilities. They are, in Vital's words, "wondrous and true things" which "it is impossible for one to relate." One has to witness them in order to comprehend their extraordinary nature. Their wondrous character had to do, in significant part, with the fact that they demonstrated Luria's masterful ability to communicate with a wide range of heavenly messengers. Thus he could speak with the souls of de- parted sages, from the distant as well as the more recent past, inquiring of them "knowledge of the future and secret mysteries of the Torah." He could 32. See above, sec. I.</page><page sequence="16">94 LAWRENCE FINE communicate with the angels on high "who announce all the proclamations ... and converse with them." He was able to comprehend the language of birds, a language which contains mysteries from above. Most significantly, he experienced revelations from a heavenly agent of even greater importance than the rest of these, Elijah the prophet. As Vital reports, "Elijah would constantly reveal himself to him, speaking to him directly, and instruct him in these mysteries." 33 Luria, then, was considered to have easy and ongoing access to the heavenly realm, and to be uniquely adept at holding direct conversations with a wide assortment of ancient prophets, teachers, and angels. The deep wisdom, knowledge, and skills acquired by these means, more- over, were believed to be largely unavailable through conventional methods of attaining knowledge of the Torah, namely, intellectual study. Vital makes this clear in rather explicit terms: The secrets of the Torah and her mysteries are not revealed to human beings by the power of their intellects, but only by means of divine vitality which flows from on high, through God's messengers and angels, or through Elijah the prophet, may his memory be a blessing.34 Vital amplifies this point in the following words: ... there is no doubt that these matters [i.e., esoteric knowledge] cannot be apprehended by means of human intellect, but only through Kabbalah, from one individual [directly] to another, directly from Elijah, may his memory be a blessing, or directly from those souls which reveal themselves in each and every generation to those who are qualified to receive them.35 In this context, Vital provides us with Luria's views regarding the history of the transmission of kabbalistic knowledge. Kabbalistic mysteries were 33. Sefer ha-Gilgulim, p. 27. The Lurianic literature is replete with stories and references to Luria's experience of meriting the revelation of Elijah. See, for example, the references to Elijah in Sefer Toledot ha-Ari, Benayahu, index to the names of individuals, p. 379. Regarding revela- tions of Elijah experienced by earlier kabbalists, see G. Scholem, Reshit ha-Kabbalah (Jerusa- lem, 1948), pp. 66-98. Concerning the multifaceted role of Elijah in Jewish literature, see A. Wiener, The Prophet Elijah in the Development of Judaism (London, 1978). 34. Sefer ha-Gilgulim, p. 25a. 35. Ibid., p. 25b.</page><page sequence="17">THE ART OF METOPOSCOPY 95 taught openly and publicly until the death of Rabbi Simeon bar Yobai (Rashbi), to whom tradition ascribes the authorship of the Zohar. Quoting the Zohar's own words on this subject, Vital writes that ever since Simeon bar Yohai's death "wisdom has departed from this earth" (Zohar 1, 217a). All of those sages who had borne kabbalistic wisdom since that time have done so in great secrecy, each disclosing his knowledge to a single disciple. What is more, even to these select disciples, kabbalistic masters taught in generalizations only, revealing but a portion of their knowledge. In such a fragmented and fragmentary way kabbalistic wisdom was passed from one generation to the next until the time of Moses ben Nabman (Nabmanides), the great Spanish rabbi of the thirteenth century.36 Following a well-known tradition recorded by Menahem Recanati (ca. 1228-ca. 1290), Vital informs us that during this time certain sages were privileged to merit direct, per- sonal revelations from Elijah the prophet, including Abraham ben David of Posquieres (1120-1191), and the latter's son, Isaac the Blind. Isaac, in turn, passed his tradition on to his two disciples, Ezra and Azriel of Gerona. From them kabbalistic tradition passed to the final teacher of genuine Kabbalah, Moses ben Nabman.37 What was Isaac Luria's place in this process of transmission? Luria, according to Vital, represents nothing less than the first and only appear- ance of authentic kabbalistic knowledge since Nabmanides. Even more, his knowledge may be compared only to that of Rabbi Simeon bar Yobai him- self. For this knowledge has "been neither seen nor heard in all the land since the days of Rabbi Simeon bar Yobai, may he rest in peace, until now." 38 Despite the aforementioned claim that true Kabbalah had not manifested itself since Nahmanides, Vital writes that in every generation God displays his compassion by giving Israel extraordinary individuals (yebidei segullah) "upon whom the Holy Spirit rested, and to whom Elijah, 36. Ibid. p. 37b. 37. In this connection, see M. Idel's study of Nabmanides' own view regarding what consti- tutes genuine and legitimate kabbalistic tradition, "We Have No Kabbalistic Tradition on This," in Rabbi Moses Nahmanides (Ramban): Explorations in His Religious and Literary Virtuosity, ed. I. Twersky (Cambridge, Mass., 1983), pp. 51-73. Concerning the question of divine revelations experienced by the earliest kabbalists of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, see A. J.

In our generation, God has not withheld a redeemer from Israel, sending us a saintly angel, "the great rabbi, our saintly teacher, our rabbi and master, Isaac Luria Ashkenazi, may his name be for an ever- lasting blessing, filled like a pomegranate with [knowledge of] Scripture, Mishnah, Talmud, Pilpul, Midrashim, Ma'aseh Bereshit, and Ma'aseh Merkavah." 39 All who witness Luria's knowledge and skills, and all who familiarize themselves with his teachings will recognize "that the human mind [by itself] could not attain such deep and wondrous matters without the power of the Holy Spirit, mediated through Elijah, may his memory be a blessing." 40 Isaac Luria, then, may be said to have been regarded by his circle as an individual possessing knowledge of a charismatic type, that is, as a person to whom direct and exceptional knowledge of the sacred had been vouchsafed. Luria's charisma, his especially close relationship to the sacred, was evi- denced not only by his remarkable saintliness, but even more significantly, by his unusual knowledge and esoteric skills, mysteries which are typically beyond the grasp of ordinary human beings.41 Mastery of the art of meto- poscopy, the knowledge of which, it was believed, could only have come from on high, should be understood as one aspect-albeit a most important one--of a type of knowledge which helped establish Luria as a teacher and religious mentor of unique status in Safed. From an historical point of view, this legitimization by the Lurianic fellowship of the charismatic mode of acquiring religious truth is, in my view, extremely significant. The effort to gain kabbalistic knowledge through such means stands, of course, in marked contrast to traditional rabbinic methods of developing teachings through various types of textual inquiry. While different hermeneutical styles may be brought to bear upon such inquiry, the common factor is the essentially intellectual process of studying an existing text for the purpose of clarifying, interpreting, or 39. Sefer ha-Gilgulim, p. 26a. 40. Ibid., p. 27a. It would be mistaken to conclude from this that Luria did not engage also in conventional textual study, of both exoteric and esoteric texts. Concerning this subject, see, for example, the traditions reported in Sha'ar ha-Mipvot, Parashat Ve-ethanan; SRH, pp. 34-46. Some of the relevant texts are translated in Fine, Safed Spirituality, pp. 68-70. 41. For a discussion of the notion of religious charisma as it is used here, see Charles F.

Williams, Journal of the American Academy of Religion Thematic Studies 48, nos. 3 and 4 (1982): 1-22.</page><page sequence="19">THE ART OF METOPOSCOPY 97 furthering meaning. For meaning is believed to reside within the texts themselves; one need only apply the appropriate techniques in order to ferret out the intention of the text. This was the case not only for the rabbis of late antiquity; it was true for the medieval philosophers, biblical exegetes of various types, as well as most kabbalists. In Luria's case appeal was not made to the inherent meaning of existing texts which could be discovered through rational inquiry, but to some heavenly source. Knowledge, as we have seen, was regarded as deriving directly from on high, rather than from an individual's own intellectual power to determine God's will. Whereas the talmudic sages went out of their way to deny the possibility of further prophecy, claiming instead that the privilege of understanding the meaning of Torah was now a more "earthly" one,42 the Lurianists reasserted the contention that more direct channels of communication were not only possible, but urgently preferable. As we have already seen, there were earlier kabbalists whom kabbalistic tradition regarded as having gained their knowledge in this way. But it was not until the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries that we encounter the pro- liferation of this type of activity on a large scale. The revelatory maggid of the Turkish kabbalist Joseph Taitaeak, the heavenly disclosures experienced by Moses Cordovero and Solomon AlkabeZ during their walks amidst the grave sites of Safed, Joseph Karo's maggidic visitations, and Hayyim Vital's technique of communing with the soul of a departed tanna, are all vivid examples of the emergence of a new point of view.43 When Isaac Luria 42.

Luria was not, however, merely another example of a general tendency. Rather, in Luria we see a rich and full realization of this tendency. Luria stood out in large part because he was perceived as a virtuoso at such acti- vity, as one who was gifted beyond compare. Through the strength of his impressive personality, as well as through the power of his teachings them- selves, Luria was well positioned to raise the phenomenon of charismatic experience to a status which it had not known for centuries.44 IV Luria's capacity to diagnose the moral status of his disciples and others through the art of metoposcopy has also to be understood within the specific context of the redemptive process of which he and his circle believed them- selves to be a part. The project of redemption, toward which Isaac Luria's mythological teachings were directed in their entirety, required each of his disciples to assume responsibility for the extremely complex task of tikkun. Tikkun refers to the elaborate activity of mending the cosmic flaws brought about by the intradivine rupture known as the "breaking of the vessels," as well as by human sin. At its deepest levels this was to be accomplished through the performance of intricate contemplative and theurgic rites, described in such detail in the Lurianic literature. But such rites, as men- tioned earlier, could be practiced successfully only by individuals who were thoroughly worthy, that is, by those who had already achieved a degree of personal tikkun. Luria's expertise at diagnosing sin and offering precise penitential exercises with which to purify the soul was perceived by his circle as an essential demonstration of Luria's redemptive role. Luria was indeed a "redeemer," as Vital tells us, insofar as healing the soul was an indispensable stage in the larger task of messianic redemption, and insofar as he imparted 44. One ought not to underestimate the influence which the personality of Isaac Luria exerted upon later mystical developments, particularly Sabbatianism and IHasidism, in signifi- cant part through the hagiographical works on Luria, Shivbei ha-Ari and Toledot ha-Ari. In this connection, see J. Dan, Ha-Sippur ha-Ivri be- Yemei ha-Beinayim (Jerusalem, 1974), chap. 11. This is a subject which deserves further investigation.</page><page sequence="21">THE ART OF METOPOSCOPY 99 techniques of contemplation to those he deemed worthy to play a further and more advanced role in the process. For Isaac Luria and his followers believed that theirs was the final, messianic generation, and that the time was ripe for the increased disclosure of heavenly secrets. ... for this wisdom was concealed since the days of Rashbi, may he rest in peace, until now, as he [i.e., Rashbi] taught: "Permission is not given to reveal it until the final generation, until the king Messiah comes." Now is the time, for on account of our saintly teacher, our honored master, Rabbi Isaac Luria, may his memory be a blessing, by means of the spirit of prophecy which appeared in him, our eyes have begun to be enlightened with the light of divine wisdom, hidden [until now] from the eyes of all living things.45 The connection between Simeon bar Yobai and Isaac Luria goes even deeper. Luria regarded himself as Simeon bar Yobai redivivus, and believed his closest disciples to be reincarnations of Rashbi's comrades!46 While there is rich and diverse evidence attesting to this, one tradition is of particular relevance to our subject. According to this tradition-recorded in several places in slightly different versions47-Luria and his disciples journeyed to the same place where Rashbi and his fellowship had engaged in a dramatic study session, an event known in the Zohar as the Holy Idra ("threshing floor"). According to the Zohar, in the course of this event Rashbi and his disciples revealed recondite mysteries of the Torah.48 Luria is reported to have sat in the exact spot that Rashbi had occupied, and to have placed each of his disciples in the position of one of Simeon bar Yobai's comrades, revealing to each disciple the comrade with whose soul he was bound through the process of metempsychosis. Luria is also reported to have engaged in a ritual known as yihud ("unification") by lying stretched out upon Rashbi's grave, as a result of which Rashbi revealed to Luria "all that 45. SRH, pp. 39-40. 46. This has already been noted and briefly discussed by Y. Liebes in his important study, mentioned in n. 43, Ha-Mashiah shel ha-Zohar, pp. 109-110 and passim. 47. See Shivbei ha-Ari, p. 17; Sefer Toledot ha-Ari, Benayahu, pp. 179-180; Sefer ha- Hlezyonot, p. 153. 48. The section of the Zohar entitled Idra Rabba is in Zohar 3, 287b-296b. For an English translation of these sections, see R. Rosenberg, The Anatomy of God (New York, 1973). The Idra Rabba is studied in the monograph by Liebes mentioned in the preceding note. In general, the Idra Rabba played an exceedingly important role in Isaac Luria's thinking.</page><page sequence="22">100 LAWRENCE FINE he had learned in the academy on high, just as a man speaks with his friend."49 According to one version of this story, Luria and his disciples also engaged in the study of the Idra itself, in the course of which Luria revealed the secret meaning of Simeon bar Yolai's Idra teachings.50 It is clear from this that Isaac Luria and his circle believed that they were reen- acting and furthering the redemptive work that had been carried out by Rashbi and his fellowship. The mythological basis for this tradition lies in an intricate set of Lurianic teachings concerning the transmigration of souls, particularly those of Luria's own inner circle.5' For present purposes it is sufficient to point out that Luria devised a transmigratory chain which linked Joseph and his brothers, Rabbi Akiva and the other "Ten Martyrs," Rashbi and his comrades, and Luria's fellowship. Each group represented a decisive stage in the process of tikkun. Through their efforts to bring about tikkun in the supernal realm, the members of these circles occupied critical roles in the redemptive process.52 Moreover, each group galvanized around a central figure who stood at the center of these efforts. This process had reached a new and critical stage with Isaac Luria and his disciples; for they believed that their actions were capable, at least potentially, of realizing the redemp- tion once and for all. The Safed kabbalists appear to have thought that the year 1575 would witness the beginning of the messianic age. According to the Lurianists, sin and exile had caused the exile of the inner secrets of the Torah; in the messianic age, however, these mysteries would be revealed once again. The redemption of holiness, which lies at the heart of Lurianic mysticism, extended even to the redemption of the Torah itself. Whereas now only frag- 49. Shivhei ha-Ari, p. 17. 50.

Scholem, Pirkei Yesod be-Havanat ha-Kabbalah u-Semaleha (Jerusalem, 1976), a German version of which is found in idem, Von der mystischen Gestalt der Gottheit (Zurich, 1962). A thorough study of the place of metempsychosis in Luria's mythology, and its relationship to his fellowship's self-understanding, is still needed. 52.

The special knowledge merited in the unredeemed state by Luria-and to a lesser degree by his disciples and others-was regarded as a sign of the coming redemption. But it was far more than a mere signal. For this knowledge, a "knowledge of the future and secret mysteries of the Torah," was also a means through which Isaac Luria could facilitate the task of tikkun.
