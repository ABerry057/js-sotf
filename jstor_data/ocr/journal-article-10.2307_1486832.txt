<plain_text><page sequence="1">Doron Mendels. The Rise and Fall of Jewish Nationalism: Jewish and Christian Ethnicity in Ancient Palestine. Anchor Bible Reference Library. New York: Doubleday, 1992. x, 450 pp. Doron Mendels's The Rise and Fall of Jewish Nationalism is accessibly written and attractively produced, and is meant to be sold to a wide audience. If it were merely another specialized scholarly monograph, it could be dismissed with a sigh. Unfortunately, the book may well be used in undergraduate courses and the like. A stern warning is therefore in order. The argument of the book is as follows: The ancient Jews, like many other ancient nations, were nationalistic; sometimes their nationalism was passive (i.e., they did nothing about it), and a small number of mainly upper-class Jews "hellenized" (i.e., gave up nationalism), but these qualifications do not alter the prevailing facts. The Jews' political nationalism centered around kingship, land, the Temple, and the army. All of these symbols attained their fullest realization under the Hasmoneans, the dynasty which embodied the Jews' independent rule of their land, now purified of pagan presence and Hellenistic influence, and their control of their similarly purified Temple. The early Hasmonean army, too, was a potent national symbol, comparable to the citizen armies of revolutionary America and France, standing in sharp contrast to the ethnically mixed, largely mercenary armies of the Hellenistic emperors.</page><page sequence="2">410 BOOK REVIEWS This situation was drastically transformed under the Herodian kings. They were mere vassals of Rome, and indeed were not even purely Jewish (on p. 7, Mendels calls them "pseudo-Jewish"!). In this period, which began in 37 B.C.E., the nationalist symbols declined: the kings themselves were inadequate; they patronized pagans as well as Jews and thus did not allow the Jews fully to control their own land; they debased the Temple and the priesthood and deprived these institutions of their political power; their armies were only part-Jewish and were used mainly to terrorize the Jewish population of the kingdom. Matters declined still further after the death of Agrippa I in 44 C.E., when the Jews lost even their unsatisfactory king and army. Nevertheless, nationalist sentiment apparently has its own mystical economy, for the death of Agrippa in fact made an explosive reassertion of nationalism inevitable(!). Hence the doomed revolt of 66-70 C.E., which strove to reactualize the nationalist symbols, but came up against the insuperable might of the Roman legions. This argument is based on a reading of the evidence marked by elementary methodological unsoundness. How depressing it is to find speeches invented by ancient historiographers taken as the ipsissima verba of the characters supposed to have declaimed them. How depressing it is that Mendels reads Josephus's moralizations as if they represented the views of "the Jews," though even Josephus never claimed, for example, that "the Jews" were outraged at the decision to allow Levite Temple choristers to wear white linen-a decision which can have been controversial only among the Temple staff; Josephus says only that he himself was outraged, along with God. How depressing to read in a new book about the long-discredited idea of a "Zealot movement," to learn that "the Jews" hated "Hellenists," that "Hellenists" could not be pious Jews, and that the Jewish supporters of Rome were "Hellenists." How depressing, in sum, to read a book whose historical content is virtually a catalogue of discredited, credulous, and wholly unexamined opinions. Nor, as may be inferred from the summary provided above, is Jewish Nationalism rescued by conceptual sophistication. On the contrary, the very title warns of the muddle that lies ahead. It is very unwise to ascribe "nationalism"-which, to use the neat definition of Ernest Gellner, is the conviction that ethnic and political boundaries should be coextensive-to any premodern group without detailed and refined argumentation, mainly because nationalism in the strict sense presupposes the disembedding of the categories of politics and culture, which we would not expect to find in</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 411 premodern societies. We should require such argumentation all the more so if some of the items of the alleged nationalist program (in this case "the land" and the army) seem to owe more to the concerns of romantic nationalism as mediated through classical Zionism than to the ancient evidence. In my opinion, Mendels's original contribution of such concepts as "passive [and so, undetectable!] nationalism," and his fateful conflation of nationalism and ethnicity, not to mention his chaotic and uninformed use of words like "symbol" and "ideology," bury the book.
