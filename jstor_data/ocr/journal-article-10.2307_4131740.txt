Tiibingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2004. 284 pp. David Noy has labored in the past decade to update J. B. Frey's Corpus in- scriptionum iudaicarum (vol. 1 [Rome 1936; revised by B. Lifshitz, New York, 1975]; vol. 2 [Rome, 1952]). He has already produced two volumes on the North Mediterranean (the Balkans and southern Italy, 1993, and Rome, 1995) and an- other for Greco-Roman Egypt (with William Horbury, 1992). Noy offers in this volume (No. III of the IJO) the Jewish Inscriptions of Syr- ia and Cyprus, completing a project initiated by Hanswulf Bloedhorn for the Karte B VI 18 of the TiibingenAtlas des Vorderer Orients. Earlier volumes oflJO include (1) Eastern Europe and (2) North of Syria, that is, Kleinasien, edited by Walter Ameling. These studies are a welcome tool to scholars and students. When com- pleted, Noy's corpus will be a basic reference text for research into Jewish settle- ment and communal structure as well as epigraphy. In the meantime the Bulletin ofJudeo-Greek Studies provides biannual updates on bibliography and occasion- ally publishes new inscriptions. As with earlier volumes, this one has a cutoff date of 700 CE. (Hence his 1993 volume excludes the Hebrew epitaphs of Southern Italy, and scholars will have to search out the seminal studies of Cesare Colafemmina for these.) The ge- ographical range includes the Roman province of Syria and Mesopotamia (as far east as Dura-Europus) in the second and third centuries, excluding those sites with- in the borders of Modern Israel, although one may find Eretz Yisrael inscriptions in the corpus (e.g., Syr 5, p. 6, and the relevant epigraphy of Beth Shearim) and west to Cyprus. The volume throws interesting light on some of the best-known centers of Jewish life in Syria. Scholars familiar with Noy's previous volumes are aware of his thorough- ness: all inscriptions in Hebrew, with Jewish symbols or terminology, or names whose presence indicates a synagogue or a Jewish graveyard, or pertaining to Samaritans-or any part of above-is included by definition. Other languages in- clude Greek, Aramaic, local Semitic dialects, and Persian. Spurious or doubtful epitaphs are in appendices. Hence we can be confident for the nonce that all the basic texts are included in the volume, thus superseding other collections with varying criteria for inclusion, that is, CIJ, and L. Roth-Gerson's (Hebrew) collec- tion of Greek inscriptions from Syria (Jerusalem, 2001). A few comments and observations about the texts: in general, the argument based on the Jewishness of a name raises the question of Jewish assimilation. Jews are notorious for adopting names of the dominant culture-even if theophoric or religiously identified: for example, Eshbaal, Hyrcanus, Isidore, Peter, Paul; hence one should be wary of assuming a priori the opposite in individual cases (e.g., p. 4). Syr 27: pino means "I drink" rather than "I am hungry" while the reverse reads CrlK~V (rather than the editor's izrgyKev), possibly from TKCO "I pine", which gives a possible reading of"Lord, help Salome, whom Ester [AuTlnp] 365</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews "pined for" (rather than "whom Ester bore). The reading of ACOHP in Syr6 is not strong enough to assume a misspelling in Syr27. The three vertical I's on the obverse remain a mystery. The ibis (?) and the snake recall Josephus's midrash on Moses and the Ethiopians. Syr 30: Can Sambati ... be a female archon? Greek usually writes B as "MP"; here the M closes a syllable making the B emphatic rather than a V [Hence from Shabbat?]. The date reads 30 March 416, not 316. Syr 35 line 2: The aleph looks like a ligature for %x while line 3 illustrates the dif- ficulty of Hebrew epigraphy. Syr 40 recalls the late antique "Synagogue of the Hebrews" in Corinth. Syr 50 notes that three generations in Palmyra carry the same name, Samuel. Syr 51 from Palmyra remembers the "only banker recorded in Antiquity". P. 116 notes that Antioch preserves only one clearly Jewish inscription. Syr 73: Unfortunately there is no picture of the menorah. Syr 75: Symbol 2 on p. 120 looks like a line drawing of a rosette. Syr 76 is an interesting amulet from Aleppo now in Jerusalem. Syr 77 parallels the well-known medallion in the Jewish Museum of London. A picture of both in tandem would be useful. Syr 81: um0 is clearly one word; Jastrow has sub ua: uua emphatic uun [engraving]. Zigzag line above letters begs for a picture showing the context. Syr 82 and Syr 83: More letters can be read on these graffiti. Syr 88: 'Apo6you is known from Josephus as the king of the Parthians. Perhaps we can read "Both Abram of Arsaces and Silas of Salman helped". Syr 104: -umoK transliterates Greek AcTz~ p. Syr 105: x7?rn transliterates Greek 'Ekta(). The Dura graffiti and inscriptions provide grist for speculation as summa- rized by Noy and indicates the necessity for reader caution. Cyp 2 is printed backwards. The menorah style is similar to Greece and Southern Italy eighth to eleventh centuries. Cyp 3: The translation of to nav Apyov -TYOV 'EppaiKrlg (hedera) as "the whole building of the Hebrew (community?)" is debatable. Apyov means "work" while EppaiK7i is the standard designation for the Jewish Quarter in Byzan- tium. The inscription may read as: "Yose, presbyter, son of Synecius, reno- vated all the work of the Jewish Quarter." The suggested (hedera) and commentary is superfluous. The verb in plural, if not a mistake (unaccept- able to a literate presbyter), suggests that both father and son renovated the quarter. Cyp 4: It is a little premature to say that "it [Kition] is the origin of the Hebrew term Kittim". Most scholars, however, follow Josephus who contributes this etymological midrash (Antiquities I, 128). The preceding comments do not detract from the thankless labor that the ed- itor, his colleagues, and his predecessors have exerted to recover and present these valuable shreds of evidence. The volume's seventeen pages of bibliography and eighteen pages of indices make this a user-friendly reference volume.
