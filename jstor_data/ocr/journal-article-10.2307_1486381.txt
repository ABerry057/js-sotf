The earliest appearance of the term "state within a state," which has become a shorthand expression for the latter view, was recently located in Venice in 1631.2 The Jews of Venice organized themselves into three ethnic communities: German, Levantine, and Ponentine. The three ethnic communities main- tained an umbrella political apparatus to deal with tasks and problems fac- ing all the city's Jews.3 In May of 1631 a struggle took place between the heads of the German Jewish community of Venice and the leaders of a local Jewish professional association.4 In the course of the dispute the latter were reminded of a communal statute forbidding any action injurious to the general Jewish community, apparently to deter them from inviting the state's intervention. This must have happened, nevertheless, because several community leaders were interrogated by one of the magistrates called Avogadori del Commune.5 Word of the statute caused the investigating magistrate to suspect the Jewish community of overstepping the bounds of the privileges granted in its charters, and of being disloyal to the state. The Avogador called on one of the government's theological juris- consults, Gaspar Lonigo.6 The office of theological jurisconsult had been 2.

In order to enable Lonigo to examine the suspicious Jewish statute, it was translated from Hebrew into Italian.8 Lonigo's reaction was violent. In a short brief, he declared the Jews had formed "a republic separated from any other dominion."'9 Lonigo recommended that the Jews' book of statutes be burned and their leaders punished commensurately. The entire matter was then brought before the Venetian Senate, which decided to postpone any decision until a more informed evaluation of Jewish self-government was available. To that end the Senate ordered that the record book contain- ing the relevant statute be translated into Italian in its entirety. The book was consigned to Sebastian Venier, a government employee involved in the censorship of books.'0 The translation project has proven a boon for Jewish historians. The translated volume, known as the Libro Grande,' lay for centuries in the files Lonigo also appears, together with Micanzio, in a manuscript of the Marciana library; IT MS. CI. VII, Cod. MDCLIX, n.p. 7. See William J. Bouwsma, Venice and the Defense of Republican Liberty (Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London, 1968), p. 358, and the literature cited there in note 77. 8. It was not unusual for the authorities to examine Jewish statutes. For example, in 1604 Samuel Luzzato brought the Italiani synagogue's "book of statutes and regulations" (libro delli parti et regolationi) to the Cattaveri. See Archivio di Stato di Venezia (ASV), Ufficiali al Cattaver (Cattaver), b. 246, fol. Iv, 27.IX.1604; b. 245, fol. 82v, 16.XII.1613. The community was also accustomed to providing translations. Marco Moist Jonah succeeded Samuel Spiera to the office of community secretary and translator. See ItzIak Min-Halleviyyim, Medabber Tah- puchoth, ed. Daniel Carpi (Tel Aviv, 1985), p. 73. See also Daniel Carpi, ed., Pinkass Va'ad K.K. Padua. 1577-1603 (Jerusalem, 1974), pp. 514, 521. The community provided the govern- ment with two substantially identical translations of the statute, by R. Leone Modena and by Jacob Levi. See Ravid, "A Republic," pp. 67-70, 74-76. Medieval Jewry law forbade Christian courts from accepting translations made by only one Jew. See Kenneth R. Stow, Catholic Thought and Papal Jewry Policy 1555-1593 (New York, 1977), p. 110. 9.

Micanzio had come from Bologna during the interdict at the request of Paolo Sarpi, and became Sarpi's assistant, confidant, and ultimately biographer." Micanzio studied the Libro Grande, consulting with a Venetian rabbi for clarification of difficult points. His opinion, issued in the form of a letter to the Venetian Senate, amounted to a detailed defense of Venetian Jewish self- government.'4 He argued that public authority and order were not jeopar- dized by Jewish self-government, and recommended that no further steps be taken. The present article is devoted to a summary and analysis of Mican- zio's apology. Micanzio's motive for defending Jewish self-government is unclear. There is no evidence that the Jewish community had a hand, honest or dishonest, in this decision. It seems, however, to have influenced the form of Micanzio's apology. Micanzio appends several arguments he heard from his rabbinical consultant, and these points are identical to central arguments in the main body of the treatise, as will become evident."5 grande), which Modena used in his translation of the statute, is apparently an abbreviation.

See note 65, below.</page><page sequence="5">THE TENUOUS THREAD 227 Micanzio's sympathy for the Jewish community apparently led him to conceal from the Senate the fact that the community had tricked the Avo- gador. The Avogador had ordered the community to produce an Italian translation of the Libro Grande statute which had aroused his suspicion. Rabbi Leone Modena and Jacob Levi obeyed by presenting a Libro Grande statute prohibiting members from taking any action that might cause damage to the community. This statute was accepted as the correct one, but in fact, an earlier Libro Grande statute explicitly prohibited recourse to the authorities.'6 It seems that Modena and Levi decided to shield the commu- nity by presenting the A vogador with the less incriminating statute. Mican- zio, having read the entire Libro Grande, must have noticed the earlier statute and recognized the substitution. Nevertheless, he made no reference to it whatsoever. It may be that Micanzio did not share Lonigo's instincts about Jewish self-government, even before he had plowed through the Libro Grande. On February 1, 1633, he wrote the Senate a letter begging off from the assign- ment of examining the Libro Grande on the grounds of ill health, little talent, and a crowded schedule.'7 The Libro Grande is a huge book, and Micanzio may simply have been daunted by the magnitude of the assignment. Still it does suggest that Micanzio was not as outraged as his fellow jurisconsult by the idea of Jewish self-government. The outcome of the Libro Grande affair is a mystery. Whether or not Micanzio actually submitted a written legal opinion cannot be verified. The margins of the extant version of the treatise contain numerous amplificatory clauses, sentences, and even entire paragraphs, written in a somewhat darker ink and in a slightly different handwriting. These suggest that ours is only a draft. The records of the Venetian Senate do not contain a clean copy of the treatise, or any other material on the Libro Grande affair. An autono- mous Jewish community continued to exist in Venice until the fall of the Republic in 1797, so the crisis did not change the status quo. Nevertheless, the community may have not entirely escaped punishment. An archival document states that Isach Luzzatto, Guglielmo Baldosa, Gesua Penso, Giosef Sachi, Leo Cervi, Isach Papo, and Salamon d'Abram Zacut were imprisoned on August 25, 1633, and released on September 18, 16.

The translation of the Libro Grande was completed on December 1, 1632,'9 and Micanzio's review is dated April 30, 1633. The simultaneity and timing of their imprisonment suggest that the Libro Grande affair may have been the cause of their incarceration. The Libro Grande affair also left a mark on the charter granted Venice's Levantine and Ponentine Jews in 1636. The Jews were permitted to judge only commercial disputes. Their judges were forbidden to lay down the law "with duress, violence, or by means of excommunication." Anyone pro- nouncing an excommunication without governmental permission would be subject to prosecution.20 The harsh tone of the charter suggests that this article was formulated in reaction to a specific incident, probably the Libro Grande affair. II Venetian objections to Jewish self-government did not begin with the Libro Grande affair. Even before the Libro Grande affair, the Venetian authorities periodically reacted to the existence of Jewish tribunals and the Jewish community's attempts to forbid its members recourse to the state's magistracies.2' The title page of a 1616 Cattaveri investigation, for instance, reads: "A Case Against Jews Judging with Absolute Authority."

A copy of the 1628 document appears in ASV, Com- pilazione Legge, b. 188, fol. 840r (CAHJP #HM5339). An earlier supplication by the heads of the Jewish Strazzaria guild to judge disputes between members appears in Cattaver, b. 246, foi. 173v, 24.1.1611. The Cattaveri approve, provided that both parties agree to this form of litiga- tion and that executive power remain solely in Cattaveri hands. The government's fears of the seditious fruits which the Jewish prohibition of recourse might bear were borne out in the aftermath of the Venetian fire of 1513. Some Jews apparently participated in the looting that ensued, and an excommunication was issued prohibiting anyone from informing on the looters. Tensions ran high in the community, as several community lead- ers opposed the excommunication.

The informer formulated his accusation as follows: The audacity of many Jews has increased so greatly that, with little regard to the interests of justice and the jurisdiction of the magistrates, they permit themselves, pushing aside any fear, to create magistrates amongst themselves, and to sentence and condemn, taking upon themselves authority which belongs not to them but to the representatives elected by the most excellent Great Council, such as your most illustrious selves, and other most brilliant magistrates. When those sentenced by the Jews do not wish to obey their sen- tences, they resort to excommunications and curses, with which they coerce [the accused] by force to remain within their judicial authority, and impede them with these diabolical ways from coming before the Christian magis- trates.22 The informer's rhetoric indicates that Catteveri opposition to the existence of Jewish courts and to the prohibition of recourse to the authorities was common knowledge. In December of 1618 Hieronimo Barbarigo, one of the Cattaveri, penned a critical review of a proposed renewal of the Jews' charter. One of his com- ments touched upon the arrogation of sovereignty. Regarding the third clause of the old charter, concerning the words "to live according to their rites": These people execute this not only with regard to their synagogues. Under this pretext of "to live," they have also begun forcing Jews, with threats of excommunication and curses more hebreorum, to remove themselves from civil and criminal litigation. They forcefully have them sub- mit to Jewish judges, who then judge them, robbing the magistracies of 22.

Erecting tribunals and judges among themselves, they form (so to speak) a new Republic. Therefore, I think it should be declared that this rite of theirs refers to their synagogues but not to judgment of matters pertaining to any magistracy of this state.23 Barbarigo articulated the legal problem which lay at the heart of the Libro Grande affair thirteen years later, and hisphrase "new Republic" anticipat- ed a phrase which Lonigo would use: "a Republic separate from any dominion." However, Lonigo's harsh recommendations surpass Bar- barigo's, who merely suggested that the coming charter be formulated with greater precision. Similarly in 1625 the Cattaveri objected to the fact that the Jewish community forced its members to submit internal litigation to binding arbitration.24 They ordered the community henceforth to obtain prior 23.

Perb parmi si debba dechiarire che detto ritto loro s'intendi quanto alle sinagoghe et non quanto al giudicare cose appartenenti a qual si sii magistrato di questa citta." Professor Brian Pullan very kindly provided me with this text. The text refers to the charter periodically granted the German and Italian Jewish population of Venice. The charter was valid for a specified term, towards the end of which the community had to petition for renewal. At that point a new charter was formulated, and was evaluated by the three government offices intimately involved with Jewish affairs: the Cattaveri, Cinque Savi alla Mercanzia, and Sopra- consoli. The clause cited by Barbarigo is the charter's only reference to Jewish autonomy. This contrasts rather sharply with the charter granted the Levantine and Ponentine communities, beginning in 1589, which defined the boundaries of their jurisdiction. See Ravid, "First Charter," p. 206. 24. Professor Reuven Bonfil has argued, correctly in my opinion, that the Jewish judicial process in Venice, among other communities of Renaissance Italy, was limited to arbitration, which had a basis in medieval law. See Ha-Rabbanut, pp. 135-161. The terms "courts" and "judges," therefore, should be understood to refer to courts of arbitration. This rule is applicable to the Libro Grande statute that mentions the judicial func- tion of rabbis ("pratichar nelle corti," fol. 181v). It is also applicable to the testimony on Vene- tian Jewish jurisprudence taken in a 1579 court case in Mantua. A local witness testified that in Venice the Jews appoint three men, called in Hebrew bet-din, who dealt primarily with matters of personal status. R. Jacob b. Abraham (Baruk Cohen), a Venetian rabbi, testified that the Jewish courts had no need of confirmation by a Christian magistrate. The first statement indi- cates that the term bet-din was used in reference to courts of arbitration. These, of course, were recognized by the state, as the second statement declares. See Shlomo Simonsohn, History of the Jews in the Duchy of Mantua (Jerusalem, 1977), p. 356, n. 130.</page><page sequence="9">THE TENUOUS THREAD 231 government approval for four types of excommunications. The fourth of these was excommunications intended to force Jews to submit to arbitra- tion, "so that they shall not be able to seek out the civil and criminal magis- tracies."25 Objections to Jewish self-government were not unique to Venice. Numerous earlier sources document government sensitivity to the question of the limits of Jewish autonomy in many places and times. In 1420, for example, the Sicilian government took action against its Jewish functionary for seeking to extend his jurisdiction by reinforcing ordinances with the threat of excommunication. In 1559, in Ferrara, Jewish juridical power was seen as a "diminution of the jurisdiction of the most distinguished duke," and was abrogated. The Jews were ordered to refrain from passing a law of any kind forbidding a Jew from going before Christian tribunals, and this order was repeated in 1564.26 In sixteenth-century Arta, under Ottoman rule, rabbinic and lay leaders were forbidden to exercise Jewish jurisdiction without official permission. Similarly, the Salonikan authorities were informed that a certain rabbi had violated the laws of the state by judging financial disputes, and by issuing a nationwide decree prohibiting Jewish disputants from approaching the state's judicial authorities, and ordering them to make use of his own judicial services.27 In 1639 the Florentine government allowed the leaders of its Jewish community to deal with legal disputes between Jews, but required governmental approval of decisions ordering offenders to be exiled.28 Governments also addressed the question of the limits of Jewish self- government in the charters they granted. The Mantuan charter of 1590 granted the Jewish community permission to enforce arbitration according to Jewish law, though it required government participation in the execution of sentences.29 The Venetian government also expressed its concern in legis- lative terms.

The 1589 charter, which resulted, did not, however, grant this request, and referred the problem to the state's magistrates.30 It is noteworthy that there are cases where the Venetian government expressed approval of Jewish self-government. This suggests that Venetian concern was more with being involved in the process of Jewish self- government than with the nature of Jewish legal practice.3' The community was, therefore, able to obtain Cattaveri approval for measures which, if passed clandestinely, might have met with resistance. Thus in August of 1613 the community issued a statute threatening excommunication to any unauthorized individuals approaching and involving the authorities in com- munity affairs.32 The Cattaveri magistracy promptly issued an identical order, thereby confirming the Jewish statute.33 The community and Cat- taveri went through the same procedure in 1616.34 III Micanzio identifies and refutes the following nine objections which he claims might be raised against the Libro Grande. He then adds arguments he heard from the rabbi to whom he was referred by the Senate for clarification of difficult points. 1. Throughout the Libro Grande the Jews refer to themselves not as Vene- tians, but as members of the German, Levantine, or Ponentine nations,35 which suggests a lack of allegiance to the Venetian state. 30.

Micanzio makes no reference to the Italiani community of Venice because he limits his discussions to the picture of the community that emerges from the Libro Grande, which only deals with these three communities. Most of Micanzio's remarks about the nature of the Venetian Jewish community are identi- fiably based on the Libro Grande, and others are based on information received from the unnamed rabbinical consultant. In general, he avoids basing his observations on personal impressions of Jewish life in Venice, though his motive for this policy is unclear.</page><page sequence="11">THE TENUOUS THREAD 233 In refutation Micanzio claims that these appellations bear no relation to the issue of Jewish patriotism. Rather, they are denominational labels that denote differences in religious practice, similar to those used among Chris- tians. The national labels used to distinguish the rites of various groups of Jews should no more be considered unpatriotic than the label of "Greek," used to identify the Greek Orthodox Christians. As proof Micanzio notes the fact that the "Jews of Italy" perform their rites together with the German nation, even though they were born in Venice. He explains that these rites differ from others with regard to liturgy, foods, and other matters.36 2. The Jews assemble without asking the government's permission, and without the presence of government representatives, even though in these meet- ings they establish laws, appoint judges, and assign tasks, as if they had inde- pendent jurisdiction and were not subordinate to the ruler. Micanzio answers with the following arguments: First, throughout the Libro Grande the community acknowledges its subjugation to the government. Therefore the government need have no fear of Jewish disloyalty or rebellion. Second, legislation must have coercive force for it to be considered a threat to the sovereignty of the state. The laws passed in the Jews' assemblies pose no threat because they are really canons, like those of the church, which exert no coercive force over members of the community. Third, foreigners immigrating to a state or city are received either as individuals or as societies, communities, or corporate bodies. Those coming as individuals are not permitted to have their own laws or statutes, though they may have whatever arrangement they please in their homes. Those coming as societies, communities, or corporations, however, are granted permission to have their own laws. Indeed, Micanzio goes on, it is impos- 36. The remarks about the "Jews of Italy" are not based on the Libro Grande, no matter how the text ought to be filled in, and their degree of detail suggests that they were told to Micanzio by the rabbi with whom he consulted. Micanzio has responded to the charge that the Jews do not identify with the Venetian nation by disqualifying the argument from ethnic nomenclature, but he has not argued against the charge per se. Patriotic sentiments do not appear in Jewish literature of this time and place. Shlomo Simonsohn concluded from the fact that Jews bequeathed sums to the Mantuan municipal hospital and donated to Christian charities that the Jews "felt themselves natives and citizens of their country." See his Mantua, p. 527.</page><page sequence="12">234 DAVID MALKIEL sible that they not have their rules of self-government. The Jews were chartered as a community and corporation, with the express license to have their own assemblies and elect political leaders. The government deals with them as with a community, upon which it imposes the obligation to operate loan banks, provide public services, and make occasional contributions to the treasury. Therefore, by virtue of their charter, they are permitted to have the canons and rules implicit in self-government. Finally, the charter granted to the Jews allows them to assemble without the participation of government representatives. Micanzio relies here on the maxim that whatever a "wise and patient ruler""'37 does has the same author- ity as any written privilege until revoked. 3. The Jews do not have their laws confirmed by the government, as societies and confraternities must.38 Micanzio replies that the Jews were not ordered to do so by the govern- ment, as other bodies were. No government had ever made this demand, neither when the Jews were first dispersed, during the Roman empire, nor under the rulers who inherited the empire. Micanzio then departs from his pattern of refutation to assert that tam- pering with the statutes of the Jews would be imprudent. Arguing first from precedent, he states that no ruler had ever "wanted this tempest."39 This, Micanzio asserts, was a wise policy, because of the large number of laws involved, and because many of them would seem absurd to one not sharing Jewish beliefs, and unworthy of being heard, much less judged, by public officials. Moreover, if the ruler were to hear the Jews' laws and approve any part of them, he would be committing an offense against Christianity. The Jews' statutes, Micanzio points out, dealt largely with the use of excom- munication and malediction to obtain payment of communal taxes. Tax revenues were needed to pay for such things as synagogues and rabbis, the baking of unleavened bread, festival celebrations, Torah classes, the ordain- 37. Quodfit Principe sciente et paciente.

Returning to his refutation, Micanzio invokes the legal principle that all laws not contrary to the state's laws are subordinate to them. The Jews' laws can be tolerated because they do not contradict any of the public laws. Finally, Micanzio turns his attention to the comparison of the Jewish community to other societies and confraternities found in Venice. The Jews were not required to confirm their internal religious and communal regula- tions because the Jews are of a different religion. Other societies and con- fraternities would be entitled to the same measure of independence if they were in the same situation.42 4. The penalties of excommunication and malediction in Jewish legislation are prejudicial to the sovereignty of the state.43 Micanzio argues that, according to theological doctrine, spiritual disci- pline never constitutes ikse-majestd and poses no threat to Venetian society or government because its force depends on credence. The Jews, like the Christians, added many "vanities" to their excommunication ritual and formula over the centuries in order to make them more frightful. Knowing that excommunications only have an effect on the believing listener, the 40. This characterization of the excommunications and taxes contained in the Libro Grande is incorrect. The Libro Grande discusses taxes raised for the loan banks which the community was obligated to erect and administer, but makes no mention of taxation for intracommunal purposes, which must have been accomplished through other mechanisms. Micanzio's distor- tion of the Libro Grande suits his theological argument, which would not be served by admitting that the community's taxes served the state's interests. 41. In the thirteenth century Alexander of Hales anticipated Micanzio's distinction between toleration of Jewish rites and practices on the one hand, and their confirmation on the other. See Robert Chazan, Church, State and Jew in the Middle Ages (New York, 1980), p. 48. 42. This point apparently hinges upon Micanzio's earlier claim that, for theological reasons, the state cannot place itself in a position that might entail confirmation of unchristian doctrines. 43. Micanzio writes that he is appending a copy of the most severe form of the Jews' excom- munication to his letter. Such an appendix is not included in our manuscript. The absence of the appendix does not prove that the treatise was or was not submitted to the Senate.</page><page sequence="14">236 DAVID MALKIEL doge would probably not be able to listen to the extravagant Jewish excom- munications without feeling amused or compassionate, but certainly not threatened.44 Micanzio also stresses the antiquity of the Jews' right to excommunicate their sinners. Since Roman times, when they were denied temporal power, the Jews were always granted spiritual disciplinary power, because it was evident that their community could not survive without some penalty to ensure observance of Jewish laws and rites. Micanzio supports this argu- ment by pointing out that Jesus adopted excommunication for the church's spiritual arsenal from the Jews.45 He concludes, dramatically, that accusing the Jewish community of treason is tantamount to accusing the church of the same crime, which would be a grave falsehood and blasphemy. Returning to the present, Micanzio warns that stripping the Venetian Jewish community of this power would have chaotic results. The Venetian state ought to follow the example of other states, none of which was ever harmed by Jewish excommunication and malediction, and allow the com- munity its disciplinary measures. 5. The Jews impose monetaryfinesfor offenses against their laws, and thus are exerting temporal, as well as spiritual, discipline over the community. Micanzio responds that according to Jewish legislative procedure, any decision taken by a plurality of members in any of its governing bodies is to be viewed as if it had passed unanimously. Similarly, the Jews' policy is that decisions made by elected community officials are considered as if they were made by the entire community of members.46 Micanzio means that Jewish laws should not be considered an external imposition, because they are passed by common consent, and are therefore no threat to the sovereignty of the state. Micanzio asserts that the executor of a fine, rather than its legislator, determines whether or not it is prejudicial to public rule. The Jews' fines are collected by agents of government magistracies, the Sopraconsoli or Cat- taveri, who could always decide not to collect a fine if it were deemed unjust. Micanzio also makes much of the fact that the fines imposed in the Libro 44. Micanzio does not mean to imply that excommunication is meaningless; only that reli- gions are mutually isolated systems, and that an excommunication cannot spill over from one religion to another. 45. Micanzio quotes John 16:2.</page><page sequence="15">THE TENUOUS THREAD 237 Grande are applied to the Venetian hospital or arsenal, or to one of the magistracies in charge of the community. He says he only noticed one place where a small sum is supposed to be applied to the ghetto poor, though this too was to be collected by the Venetian government's agents.47 Finally, all sorts of contracts contain clauses imposing monetary penalties for non- compliance, and they too are never considered prejudicial because it is the collector, not the legislator, that matters. 6. Community members are enjoined to silence and secrecy concerning the statutes.48 They are also forbidden recourse to government magistracies, and forbidden to obtain exemption from communal obligations by means of govern- ment mandates (mandati), namely, orders allowing an individual a certain privilege.49 These four measures appear to infringe upon the sovereignty of the Venetian government. For the first and only time in his discourse, Micanzio agrees that here the Jews express a lack of respect for the government, since presumably the government would never issue unjust mandates. Though Micanzio argued all along that the state should not revoke or even change the Libro Grande, he admits that annulling the "mandates" clause might be justified. He is equally offended by a Libro Grande statute which states that Jews regularly exploit noble acquaintances in order to buy meat in excess of their quota.50 Micanzio feels that this statute expresses disrespect for the nobility, and admits that it might also be revoked. However, pointing out that this book 46. See Leone Modena, She'elot u-teshuvot Zikne Yehuda, ed. Shlomo Simonsohn (Jerusa- lem, 1957), p. 43. See also Shmuel Shilo, s.v.

Internal application of fines might suggest the arrogation of sovereignty, but their application towards state projects or offices would support the argument that Jewish self- government is beneficial to the state. 48. This was true of communities and confraternities in general. The record book of Padua's Jewish community forbids anyone to reveal the slightest detail of any community statute to non-Jews. See Carpi, Pinkass, p. 289. On confraternities, see Beracha Rivlin, "Ha-Hitargenut li-ezra hadadit bi-ltalia ben ha-meot 16-18" (Ph.d. diss., Hebrew University, 1985), p. 281. 49. Part of a Libro Grande statute on this subject translates as follows: "No one in the com- munity shall get any mandate (mandato) nor obtain any order (ordine) from any magistracy in this city, in order to flee and escape from being elected to any office" (fol. 123r, 5.11.1614). 50. Libro Grande, fols. 49v-50r.</page><page sequence="16">238 DAVID MALKIEL and its laws are quite old, and that tampering with them would wreak havoc, Micanzio decides to argue for excusal of the community's behavior in the following manner: Micanzio first excludes from the discussion all the cases in which the government is not mentioned, and the imposition of silence and secrecy applies only among members. These, he says, do not offend the public interest in any way. The prohibition of recourse is not really a violation of sovereignty. The judicial process requires three participants: plaintiff, defendant, and judge. Any impediment in the way of defendant or judge would indeed violate the power of the judicial process. The Jews, however, are only accused of hindering the plaintiff from filing suit, which Micanzio argues is no crime. The community recognizes the right of the plaintiff to file suit, but seeks to impede the exercise of that right. The same is true for mandates: the fact that the Jews outlaw government mandates proves that they acknowledge their validity. Micanzio points out that the obstruction of legal recourse is common practice among friends or relatives of any nationality, and should not be considered dangerous. St. Paul himself forbade the faithful from bringing fellow believers before the infidel authorities, and surely no one would argue that he advocated something prejudicial to secular rule.5 The obstruction of recourse is actually beneficial to the government, because rulers generally dislike lawsuits, and prefer settlement of disputes. Moreover, recourse is usually a remedy to the injustice and oppression that an individual suffers. Here, however, the individual is causing damage to the general community by involving the government in community affairs. The four communal measures under discussion occur with extreme rarity in the Libro Grande. Micanzio proceeds to discuss each occurrence, and shows that the law was never designed to keep the government ignorant of Jewish practices. 51. I Corinthians 6. Micanzio makes the same point in his Annotazioni e Pensieri, in response to Robert Bellarmine's claim, from the I Corinthians text, that the church possesses supreme temporal power: "Nowadays the republic lets the geto have a constitution of its own, which decides, judges." Micanzio then mentions the Venetian practice of installing bailiffs, with judicial authority, in several mercantile centers. "If they [i.e., litigants] choose to submit to this justice, they do so. Who can claim that the same is not done among litigants in every family?" See Storici e politici veneti del cinquecento e del seicento, pp. 766-767. The I Corinthians prece- dent was also noted by Baer, "Ha-yesodot," p. 4.</page><page sequence="17">THE TENUOUS THREAD 239 Micanzio begins with a discussion of the community's assessors, officials elected periodically to decide how much each community member shall pay in taxes.52 This office is understandably unpopular, and members habitually seek to avoid election. Well-connected Jews seek exemption through man- dates from the Venetian government, hence the community's prohibition of recourse and mandates. These assessors discuss each member's finances and then assess his tax liability. Their decisions are made public only after the entire community has been thus assessed. Premature disclosure of an individual assessment would likely result in great disturbances, and silence is therefore enjoined by the community. The amount suggested by each assessor for any individual is likewise considered sensitive information to be kept secret, since members often consider their sum too high and bear grudges against their perceived oppressors. Finally, Micanzio discusses the measure prohibiting private recourse to the authorities on community affairs. Matters involving the Venetian authorities are capably handled by the community's efficient bureaucratic machinery. This established system could only be harmed by the inter- ference of individuals. Micanzio considers this case so clearly justified that he says he feels no need to add to what has been said. City councils are forbidden to meet without government representatives and without a written agenda because they have the power to foment sedi- tion. The Jews, however, are powerless, and have no history of sedition. Sedition usually takes place in small groups, rather than great and open assemblies, such as those of the Jews. Finally, the Jews are unlikely to betray the state, on account of the felicity they enjoy under the supremely peaceful Venetian government, the riches they possess, and the solidity of their Large Assembly's electorate, who are all well-off and have all been married for at least a year."53 7. The Jews legislate on civil matters like sumptuary law, counterfeiting, and rents, which are the domain of the state, and this constitutes l1se-majest&amp;. 52. The community's 1607 constitution on assessors and the assessment process appears in the Libro Grande, fols. 18v-41v. 53. Francesco Sansovino wrote, in his Venetia cittd nobilissima, et singolare (Venice, 1604), that the Jews preferred Venice to any other part of Italy: "Living in most singular peace, they enjoy this country almost like a true Promised Land." See Bouwsma, Republican Liberty, p. 117.</page><page sequence="18">240 DAVID MALKIEL Micanzio responds that these prohibitions help rather than offend public law, Moreover, canon law also covers civil matters, but has never been accused of usurping secular authority. Punishment for something covered by civil legislation is a commonplace between fathers and children, and among confraternity members, without the government fearing for its sovereignty. It is not prejudicial to public rule as long as the law and punishment laid down by the government are affirmed. With regard specifically to rents, Micanzio argues that the Christian landlord can always have recourse to the government in the event of a grievance, and therefore the Jewish law poses no threat to the public interest.54 Micanzio explains that the Libro Grande's law serves to prevent, rather than perpetrate, injustice, and should therefore be tolerated. Jewish tenants are of two categories. Those of the first pay a uniform rent for the duration of the Jews' charter and thereby obtain the Cazacha', or the possessive right over the property, until the expiration of the charter. An attempt by another Jew to force the tenant to give up his right would be an injustice, which the Jews prohibit and punish, and this in no way offends the state. Jews of the second category possess three- or five-year rentals, according to the period of the charter, with various conditions and terms, rather than a possessive right. Here too, pressure to abandon a lease would be an uncharitable and uncivil act." Micanzio includes a defense of the Jewish visitors' inn in the ghetto, saying that as long as it complies with Venetian law it does not jeopardize Venetian sovereignty. The statement that members of the community's Large Assembly had to have been married for at least a year does not appear in the Libro Grande and may be without foundation. Note his oligarchic characterization of the Jews' Large Assembly. 54. The community's control of housing was not a new issue. A Libro Grande statute on this subject (fols. 45v-47r) refers back to one promulgated by R. Meir b. Isaac Katzenellenbogen in 1541, when the ghetto vecchio was established. See R. Moses Isserles, Responsa, ed. Asher Ziv (Jerusalem, 1970), pp. 248-263, and Ravid, "Ghetto Vecchio." In 1606 the Venetian Jewish community was accused of usurping governmental jurisdiction on account of its adjudication of rental disputes. See Colorni, Legge ebraica, pp. 372-374. This issue appears again in Bar- barigo's text, cited above. It also comes up after the Libro Grande affair. See Ravid, "The Establishment of the Ghetto Nuovissimo of Venice," in the forthcoming Memorial Volume for Umberto Cassuto (Jerusalem). 55. The information about the different categories of rentals is not taken from the Libro Grande, and may have come from Micanzio's rabbinical consultant.</page><page sequence="19">THE TENUOUS THREAD 241 Micanzio sums up this section by saying that the Jews' successful weath- ering of the recent plague of 1630-31 indicates that their civil legislation is a boon, rather than a threat to the public interest.56 8. Jewish officials meet almost as a tribunal, with judicial acts, which indi- cates a usurpation of Venetian jurisdiction. Micanzio responds that the Jewish tribunal charged with hearing claims for the reduction of assessments should not be considered offensive to the public dignity or power, because its only power is to declare the new assess- ment, not to pass sentence. Moreover, Micanzio reiterates that tax collec- tion is done through government executive means. Micanzio discusses a specific lawsuit narrated in the Libro Grande, between one Mois&amp; Luzzato and the community.57 In 1619 the community passed a law including all members in an upcoming assessment. Luzzato protested that he held a special privilege from the Jewish community exempting him from taxation, and demanded justice. A Jewish court was set up to hear the claims of both sides, with the decision ultimately going in the community's favor. Though Micanzio acknowledges that this was a tribunal of sorts, he points out that the community was allowed to handle the matter of assessments internally. Moreover, government approval of the proceed- ings had been obtained. Micanzio concludes that nothing here was prejudi- cial to Venetian authority. Micanzio describes a second court case, related in the Libro Grande, in which the community appears to arrogate judicial power. Marino Lion da Fano from Padua had written the Venetian Jewish authorities an insulting letter, and was summoned to Venice to apologize.58 The problem here was that the Venetian community exerted general authority over Terraferma ("mainland") Jewry, though it only had authority to do so on matters of taxation. Micanzio argues that this action was justified, since license for the 56.

The community heads can spend money without rendering an account, which appears prejudicial to public order. Micanzio replies that the damage involved could not be significant, since the sum in question is small. He adds that this policy had been approved by the community, and the state should ignore the complaints of individuals. After posing the nine objections to the contents of the Libro Grande from the perspective of the Venetian government and refuting them, Micanzio reminds the Senate that he had accepted the task of reviewing the Libro Grande with the utmost reluctance.60 He sums up his report by stating that the book contains nothing basically offensive to Venetian jurisdiction and authority, although it is full of barbarous phrases and ridiculous exaggera- tions.6' The only possible course of action would be to annul all of the book's statutes, which would be unwise. Micanzio concludes the report with points he heard from his rabbinical consultant. First, the statutes in the Libro Grande are an ancient part of the Jewish people, little altered through the centuries. They have never caused the Jews difficulties with their host government,62 and contain nothing con- trary to the public government, to which the Jewish nation considers itself totally subject. Moreover, the community's constituents are hardheaded and stub- born,63 and likely to dispute everything unless curbed by some form of discipline. Communal disciplinary power keeps the "ghetto rogues"64 in check. Without it, the plague of 1630-31 would have caused such disorder that all the ghetto inhabitants would have perished. The removal of disci- 59. The Libro Grande regulations for the structure and function of the community's Small Assembly do not assign that body a judicial function. Micanzio testifies, correctly, to the dearth of judicial material in the Libro Grande. There is, therefore, no basis for Cecil Roth's assertion that the Small Assembly acted as the community's court. See his Venice, pp. 128-129. 60. Micanzio may be alluding to his letter, mentioned earlier. See note 17. 61 ... d'incongruita, di frasi dure, barbare, di essagerationi ridicoli, impossibili, inos- servabili (fol. 236v). 62.

Additionally, the obligation to silence only affects the discussions of issues. Actual decisions, however, are publicized, and therefore, the overall policy of silence and secrecy should not pose a problem. Moreover, this measure only applies to matters likely to create enmity towards community leaders, like fixing tax assessments, or electing assessors and community heads. Finally, the rabbi noted that the community has no coercive power, and should therefore not be accused of usurping government authority. Its only weapon is excommunication, which is merely verbal discipline. This "tenuous thread" (tenue filetto) should rightfully be conceded to the com- munity, since the Venetian government does not obtain complete obedience to its laws even with the coercive power at its disposal.65 65. Micanzio's rabbinical consultant is not identified explicitly, but could have been Leone Modena. Modena mentions the ghetto rabble a few times in his autobiography; see pp. 43, 69. He also discusses the disorder in the ghetto during the plague of 1630-31; see p. 85. Additionally, Micanzio probably knew Modena. First, Modena mentions his reputation among Christian nobles and dignitaries several times in his autobiography. Second, Modena completed his Diffessa in 1627, and when he submitted it for publication, it came before none other than Micanzio. See Clemente E. Ancona, "Attachi contro il Talmud di Fra Sisto da Siena e la risposta, finora inedita, di Leon da Modena, Rabbino in Venezia," Bolletino dell'istituto di storia della societh e dello stato Veneziano 5-6 (1963-64): 323. Third, Modena was one of two community members ordered, in the initial stage of the Libro Grande affair, to prepare a trans- lation into Italian of the statute forbidding recourse to magistrates, and was clearly considered an authority. See Ravid, "A Republic," pp. 54-55, 67-69. Micanzio's rabbinical consultant was apparently a talented apologist. He appears to have deeply influenced Micanzio, since some of the treatise's key points are ultimately attributed to the rabbi. The notions that a distinction ought to be made between the Jews' spiritual discipline and coercive power, and that a community cannot survive without some form of coercive power, as well as the appeal to the antiquity of Jewish law, are some examples. Nevertheless, Micanzio did not assimilate the rabbi's point about the state's ineptitude at law enforcement into the main body of his presentation, probably for fear of offending. This boldness of expression lends some support to the suggestion that Modena was Micanzio's rab- binical consultant. Modena's writing is generally assertive and colorful, and he often reveals a lack of tactical humility or diplomacy. For example, he writes that if Christians treat Jews badly, they are not to be considered brethren, and it is permitted to cheat them. See his Diffessa, p. 319.</page><page sequence="22">244 DAVID MALKIEL IV Micanzio's treatise is extremely important for the study of European attitudes towards Jewish self-government. Historians have been forced to base their analyses of the legal status of premodern Jewries on charters and lawbooks rather than on theoretical discussions by jurists. Micanzio's treatise fills this gap. His is the only known comprehensive discussion of the question, at least from this period. The only treatment which is at all com- parable, the De ludaeus of Marquardus de Susanis, a sixteenth-century jurisconsult from Udine, is much more restricted in scope, and in fact deals with a different problem.66 De Susanis was concerned primarily with a theo- logical issue and objected to Jewish autonomy as lbse-majestd against God. He stressed that the condition of the Jews in Christendom must mirror the prophecy that "the scepter shall not depart from Judah," etc. (Gen. 49:10), in order to facilitate the conversion of the Jews. Therefore, he argued, Jewry law denied the Jews any form of jurisdiction entailing the exercise of power and the award of dignity. Micanzio, on the other hand, was concerned with the relation of Jewish self-government to the state. Furthermore, Mican- zio's discussion surpassed that of De Susanis in breadth. He analyzed the legislative and executive features of Jewish self-government, whereas De Susanis only dealt with the judicial issue. Micanzio's treatise also contributes to the study of church-state rela- tions in the turbulent period of the Counter-Reformation. Lonigo's critical brief and Micanzio's sympathetic one are richly resonant with the theo- logical-political tensions of the interdict period. As disciples of Sarpi and as Venetian theological jurisconsults, the state's two opposing theologians were both steeped in the history and issues of the conflict with Rome. Each saw the Libro Grande affair through the prism of the interdict, as will be made plain, though they took opposing positions. Micanzio's treatise is rooted in, and designed to appeal to, Venetian taste. He expresses a typically Venetian conservative bent, as well as a pre- ference for pragmatic and utilitarian considerations over ideals, a pattern of 66. Stow, Catholic Thought, pp. 112-113, 120-121, 152-164. See also Bonfil, Ha- Rabbanut, pp. 135-139, 144-145. The legal brief in defense of Jewish arbitration mentioned on p. 138 is suggestive of the Micanzio text. The Shuda de-Dayyane statute of 1677 Mantua was a continuation of the effort to define the place of Jewish jurisdiction within the general legal system. See Simonsohn, Mantua, pp. 361-366.</page><page sequence="23">THE TENUOUS THREAD 245 thinking known as ragione di stato (raison d'detat) and also characteristic of Venice. During the interdict period papal polemicists trumpeted the charge that Venetian policy was set by political, rather than idealistic, considera- tions.67 Micanzio expresses his utilitarian approach when he asserts that some questionable Jewish practices, like the commandment of secrecy, are just and beneficial to the state. The state should, therefore, tolerate them, even though they infringe upon its sovereignty. Moreover, Micanzio explicitly warns his audience that abolishing Jewish self-government would cause chaos in the ghetto. This line of reasoning is predicated upon the axiom that the national government is weak, and finds it difficult to manage its affairs alone. Essentially conceding Lonigo's point, Micanzio argues that the viola- tion of sovereignty is tolerable because it helps get the job of governing done. Micanzio's emphasis on utility, rather than ideology, is reminiscent of Sarpi, who preferred particulars over generalities, and was praised for his concreteness.68 It is typical of the general Venetian approach to human affairs, which has been characterized as "earthbound and empirical."''69 Micanzio also appeals to his audience's conservative tendencies towards conformity and complacency. This tendency is usually related to the Vene- tians' pride in the antiquity of their independent republic, mixed with a distrust of change as Venice began to decline in European stature.70 Micanzio plays upon his readers' reluctance to break with tradition. He stresses that predecessors and contemporaries have found the status quo appropriate, and discourages needless change. Historical precedent becomes Micanzio's tool. St. Paul forbade believers from bringing fellow Christians before an infidel court, as the Jews do now; Jesus himself institutionalized excommunication; on a secular plane, previous doges have found the Jews' arrangements acceptable. 67.

Micanzio implies that if self-government had been acceptable to venerated predecessors and respect- ed contemporaries, including even the pope, it should be legitimate for Venice, and that to reverse their policy would be blasphemous, disloyal, or simply foolish. This line of thinking is entirely compatible with the general Venetian pragmatism and antipathy to speculative systems."7 Micanzio expects his reader to see no reason for change on purely ideological grounds when the status quo is both effective and traditional. Micanzio uses both conservatism and pragmatism when he compares the Jewish community to Venice's panoply of autonomous societies and con- fraternities. He points out that all groups of immigrants arriving in Venice as communities are permitted to live by their own laws. Micanzio's implication is that the Jews do not represent a greater threat to the sovereignty of the state than do other corporate groups, which is an argument from pragma- tism. This theme reinforces the argument made elsewhere in the treatise that Jewish practices which seem prejudicial to the sovereignty of the state are grounded in their charters, which is an argument from tradition. In addition to ragione di stato, Micanzio appeals to the Venetians' compulsion to affirm and demonstrate their doctrinal orthodoxy on matters of religion. This tendency was motivated by the political tensions with Rome during the interdict period rather than by the Counter-Reformation. While struggling to preserve her political independence from Rome, Venice pro- tested her devout Catholicism to avoid acquiring a popular image as the Antichrist.72 Micanzio accomplishes this goal by drawing parallels between the Jewish community and the church, comparing the Jews' ethnic groups to Catholic denominations, and their use of excommunication and malediction to the same Catholic power. He uses historical and contemporary church 71. Bouwsma, "Political Education," pp. 446, 459, 460. King Louis X of France also used Rome as a precedent and rationale for tolerating the Jews in 1315, as did Duke Emanuele Fili- berto of Savoy in 1572.

One type of comparison Micanzio makes with the church has a particu- larly Venetian character. He repeatedly compares Jewish legislation to church canons, and claims that both are based on spiritual discipline rather than coercion. Hence neither is prejudicial to the sovereignty of the state. The view that the authority of the church is solely of a spiritual nature was an important Venetian argument during the interdict, expressed as follows by Micanzio's mentor, Sarpi: It is called the kingdom of heaven, not only because it will attain perfection in heaven, but because while yet on earth it reigns and governs not by rules and worldly interests but by completely spiritual ordinances.73 Rome was the obvious counterpoint to this image of the ideal church. Micanzio expresses the same image of the church, which he then uses to defend Jewish self-government. V The Libro Grande affair originally attracted scholarly attention because it appeared to inaugurate the charge that the Jewish community constituted a state within a state and hence a threat to the sovereignty of the state, with its new absolutist self-perception. The novelty of the charge has been dis- credited in our earlier discussion. It remains, then, to assess the novelty of the arguments made by Micanzio and Lonigo. The traditional Venetian character of Micanzio's arguments proves that his treatise, though impor- tant as a systematic and comprehensive presentation, was not new. The traditional character of Micanzio's thinking is evident from the fact that he never questions the fundamental rightness of the corporate system of government, the demolition of which later marked the beginning of a new era in European political history.74 The new era saw European Jewry trans- 73.

This change, too, was one Micanzio could not have imagined. Micanzio warns that stripping the community of its disciplinary power would lead to a total breakdown of the Jewish community, because he assumes that no community can function without some means of coercion. The view espoused by Lonigo was as traditional as that of Micanzio. Aside from the obvious theological base on which he could draw, namely, the position articulated by De Susanis, Lonigo was expressing a traditional Venetian concern with sovereignty, one which had been intensified by the interdict. He emphasizes the absolute supremacy of the state's jurisdiction, declaring resoundingly that "in the free and independent Venetian state there is no ruler other than Your Serenity, nor can anyone exercise any juris- diction, high or low, unless he is recognized by your supreme hand.""75 Concern for absolute sovereignty was the linchpin in the Venetian case dur- ing the interdict. At that time the struggle for exclusive jurisdiction over church officials was one of the most important issues. For Sarpi, "sover- eignty is a power absolute by nature, from which nothing can be exempted or excepted."76 The Venetian people believed that the Republic had divine sanction.77 This belief explains Lonigo's conclusion that the Libro Grande contains material "reprobated by God and by the world."78 He therefore suggests measures generally reserved for heresy, recommending that the state burn the Libro Grande.78 75. Ravid, "A Republic," p. 71: "nello Stato Veneto libero et independente non vi i altro Prencipe che la Sereniti Vostra ne alcuno puo' essercitarli giurisdittione alcuna ne alta ne bassa se non lo riconosce dalla suprema sua mano." 76. Bouwsma, "Venice, Spain, and the Papacy," p. 373; Republican Liberty, pp. 346, 369, 442-443. Sarpi also emphasized the state's right to judge church edicts, including excommuni- cations. On excommunication as an issue of state sovereignty, see also Alexander Altmann, "Moses Mendelssohn on Excommunication: The Ecclesiastical Law Background," in Studies in the History of Jewish Society in the Middle Ages and in the Modern Period Presented to Professor Jacob Katz, ed. E. Etkes and Y. Salmon (Jerusalem, 1980), pp. 41-61. 77. The doge's participation in religious processions and Venice's tradition of independent apostolic foundation (by St. Mark) support the view that Venetians considered their state holy. See Bouwsma, Republican Liberty, pp. 47, 65, 72, 74; Lane. Venice, pp. 88, 90. 78. Ravid, "A Republic," p. 72: materie cosi reprobate da Dio e dal mondo. This phrase parallels Lonigo's earlier characterization of the community leaders as persone infedeli a Dio et al mondo (ibid.).</page><page sequence="27">THE TENUOUS THREAD 249 The fears and suspicions of Jewish treachery about which Lonigo warns the Senate are also traditional Venetian material. The Venetian nobility had a history of suspecting its Levantine Jews of seditious activity, particularly because they were Ottoman subjects until 1589. Jewish merchants were interned during the 1571 war with the Ottoman empire.79 In 1571 the Vene- tian nobleman Alvise Grimani attempted to persuade the Senate to revoke the Jews' charter, accusing them of spying for the Turks, and disloyalty to the state was one of the reasons given for the expulsion of 1571.80 In 1603 Immanuel Aboab addressed the Great Council on the subject of Jewish loyalty."' Finally, the accusation of Jewish disloyalty is discussed in Luz- zato's Discorso.82 Lonigo's position, moreover, was grounded in the church's traditional view that the Jews ought to be kept in a servile, abject condition.83 He begins his presentation with the statement that "the Jews are undoubtedly subject in civil and criminal matters to the laws and statutes passed by the rulers and governments of their places of residence, and as such, ought to be judged and punished just like any other person,"84 but then takes back his compari- son with other people, and suggests that the Jews ought to be punished more severely than others, "on account of their having a condition inferior to anyone."85 Though ghettoization wrought profound changes in the relations between Jew and Christian, the Libro Grande affair illustrates the eternal 79.
