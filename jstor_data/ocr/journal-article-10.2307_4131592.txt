Brill's Series in Jewish Studies. Leiden: Brill, 1999. xx, 418 pp. Allison Coudert is not the first historian to underscore the importance of the seventeenth century as a critical moment in the history of Jewish-Christian rela- tions in Western civilization. Scholars engaged in Spinoza's thought have focused for some time now on the rich converso culture of Amsterdam and its mediating role between Judaism and Christianity.' More recently, the messiahship of Shab- betai Zevi and the crisis his apostasy precipitated in the Jewish world have been scrutinized within the broader context of Jewish-Christian interactions.2 Coudert is the first, however, to study closely the circle of Christian thinkers and their fasci- nation with the Kabbalah at the court of Sulzbach, especially Francis Mercury Van Helmont, the son of a famous Paracelsian physician, and his close colleague, Christian Knorr von Rosenroth, the compiler of the greatest Latin collection of Kabbalist writings ever published, the Kabbala denudata. Gershom Scholem, among others, held a high regard for Van Rosenroth's ac- complishments,3 and Frank Manuel begrudgingly acknowledged the influence of Van Helmont on Henry More, Ann Conway, Gottfried Leibniz, and some of the Quakers,4 but neither undertook a systematic examination of the political and in- tellectual worlds of these remarkable thinkers. Coudert has accomplished this task in a careful and intelligent manner. She has read extensively the writings of each of these principal thinkers and more; has studied the political context of their in- teractions based on impressive archival research; and has not only availed herself of the most recent work of intellectual historians working on the seventeenth cen- tury, especially those associated with the work of Richard Popkin, but has also at- tempted to read widely in the recent work of historians working on Jewish culture in early modem Europe. The result is an impressive reconstruction of a relatively 1. I refer here generally to the many volumes edited and written by Richard Popkin, Yosef Kap- lan, David Katz, E. G. E.

Although Coudert is well aware of the excesses of some ofYates' grandiose claims and the specific revisions offered by her thoughtful critics over the years, she is, nevertheless, quite convinced of the overall legitimacy of Yates' thesis. Her rich intellectual biography of Van Helmont is merely the launching pad to canvass the larger intellectual links he established with his illustrious contemporaries, Christian August, the count of Sulzbach, Von Rosenroth, More, Conway, Leibniz, George Keith, the Quaker theologian, and even John Locke. What emerges is a clear demonstration of the centrality of the Kabbalah in the consciousness of Chris- tian thinkers very much engaged in the critical religious and political issues of their age, in many ways analogous to the uses of the Kabbalah two centuries earlier in the work of such thinkers as Pico della Mirandola and Johannes Reuchlin. Unlike these fifteenth-century figures, however, Coudert's subjects, through the masterful translations of Von Rosenroth, assimilated especially some of the principal themes of the Kabbalistic system of Isaac Luria, as transposed into a neo-Platonic key by such Jewish writers as Israel Sarug, Abraham Herrera, and Joseph Delmedigo. What emerges, according to Coudert, is an enthusiastic appropriation of Lurianic notions by these Christian intellectuals, especially their use of his view of transmigration (gilgul) and his radical optimism as reflected in the notion of tikkun. Although mixed with other forms of gnosticism found in Hermetic, Neo- platonic, and alchemical sources, their new infusion of Lurianic ideas is signifi- cant for several reasons. In the first place, these thinkers adopted a vitalistic phi- losophy of perfectionism and universal salvation at the expense of rejecting partially or completely the traditional Christian notions of predestination, original sin, and the eternality of hell, while at least minimizing the role of Christ in the re- demptive process. Second, by de-emphasizing these dogmas, they promoted a more tolerant and open version of Christianity that blurred the boundaries between Catholics and Protestants and between Christians and Jews. Third, by privileging the Jewish notions of theodicy and progress, they reveal their great indebtedness to Jewish and converso thought at a critical moment in the reshaping of Western culture. Finally, these individuals exemplify the religious roots of the process of secularization and the Enlightenment and the intimate connections of Jewish and Christian gnosticism and messianism with science, toleration, and progress. These are not small claims and, if correct, they call for a major re-evaluation of much previous thinking about the origins of the Enlightenment, on the one hand, 5. In some interesting ways, her work converges with that of the Italian historian Sylvia Berti. See especially her "A World Apart? Gershom Scholem and Contemporary Readings of 17th Century Jewish-Christian Relations," Jewish Studies Quarterly 3 (1996): 212-24; and her "At the Roots of Un- belief," Journal of the History of Ideas 56 (1995): 555-75. 195</page><page sequence="3">AJS Review and the place of Jewish ideas in the shaping of early modern European culture, on the other. Especially noticeable is Coudert's plea directed at the Scholem school calling for the integration of the Kabbalah into the cultural history of Christian Eu- rope. By her careful study of how Lurianic notions were not merely translated into Latin but integrated into the Christian thinking of Van Helmont and Von Rosen- roth, and through them, a circle of other associates, Coudert has made her most important contribution. No doubt her own readings of these thinkers will be chal- lenged and refined by future researchers, particularly regarding the weight she at- tributes to Kabbalistic ideas in the evolution of their theologies. Nevertheless, her well-researched and stimulating book has significantly advanced our understanding of both the history of modern thought and its ecumenical underpinnings. David B.
