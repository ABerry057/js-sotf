<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jacob Mansour. The Jewish Baghdadi Dialect: Studies and Texts in the Judaeo-Arabic Dialect of Baghdad. Studies in the History and Culture of Iraqi Jewry Monographs. Or-Yehuda, Israel: Babylonian Jewry Heritage Center, Institute for Research on Iraqi Jewry, 1991. xxi, 329 pp. This volume is a synchronic description of the Arabic dialect employed by the Jews of Baghdad (hereafter JB). The city of Baghdad before 1948 exemplifies an interesting linguistic situation where three distinct communal dialects intersect: the dominant Muslim, the Christian, and the Jewish. Haim Blanc published in 1964 his monumental volume, Communal Dialects of Baghdad, in which he compared and analyzed these three dialects. Mansour's volume, on the other hand, attempts to describe only JB in depth. The book is an adaptation of two previous volumes on the topic published in 1974 and 1977 in Hebrew. The changes made in this work relate to a more accurate transcription and analysis. There also is an additional new chapter in which the author summarizes in general the characteristic features of JB and compares them to Classical Arabic as well as to the Muslim and Christian Baghdadi dialects. Part I of the book includes a very detailed phonological analysis of JB and a less-detailed analysis of its morphology. Mansour deals in great depth and accuracy with consonants and vowels, stress patterns, clusters and anaptyxis, diphthongs and glides. In addition, he analyzes the root patterns of the verb and treats its inflectional affixes and pronominal suffixes. In part</page><page sequence="2">298 BOOK REV[EWS II Mansour provides five fascinating texts transcribed in the dialect with an accurate English translation. The following remarks relate to different aspects of the book: 1. Mansour mentions throughout the book that he analyzes the dialect only synchronically. I do not understand why in a synchronic description of a dialect one cannot employ diachronic explanations as well. This could prove helpful, as to determine, for example, whether e and o are indeed discrete phonemes (p. 85) or just variants of the corresponding long vowels 5 and j, as Blanc suggests.' 2. It is not true that JB does not have a written form. There are Baghdadi Judeo-Arabic (hereafter JA) texts (such as ?arlh, folktales, and more), and one may see dialectal elements in these writings. In fact, JA has been spoken and written in various forms by Jews throughout the Arabic-speaking world; its literature is concerned for the most part with Jewish topics and is written by Jewish authors for Jewish readers. Its linguistic components are Classical Arabic, dialectal elements, pseudo-corrected features, and standardization of such features. In addition, like other Jewish languages, JA has several other peculiar features: the use of Hebrew characters, different traditions of ortfiography, elements of Hebrew and Aramaic vocabulary and grammar, and the language layer of the sadrh-a literal, or direct, translation of Hebrew sacred texts into JA. In addition, JA consists of five periods: Pre-Islamic JA, Early JA (eighth/ninth to tenth centuries), and Modern JA (twentieth century). JB treated in this volume belongs to the final period of JA, Modern JA, where the literary language is characterized by production of S'urulh, folktales, and other types of "popular literature." Moreover, the language demonstrates a stronger dialectal influence than that of the preceding periods, and also exhibits localized elements from the spoken variety.2 3. When Mansour talks about the "original form" of JB on p. 19, it is not clear to what period he alludes. 4. In his attempt to give reasons for the emergence of JB on pp. 25-26, Mansour actually only relates manifestations of the dialect. Moreover, there is a marked difference between Classical Arabic and the Muslim dialect. I do not think the development of the Muslim dialects was hindered by the 1. Haim Blanc, Conmmntunal Dialects of Baghdad (1964), p. 30. 2. For a thorough discussion of the issue, see B. Hary, Multiglossia in Judeo-Arabic (1992), pp. 71-114.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 299 ideal of al-'Arabiyya, since only the development of Classical Arabic was dependent on it. 5. On p. 33, bottom, I interpret the p in petahayyini 'cemetery' as a hyper-correction; consequently, the claim that speakers did not realize that p is a foreign consonant is erroneous. 6. On p. 55, n. 7, g is not the voiced counterpart of q; it is explicitly stated on p. 53 that g is the voiced counterpart of k. Mansour's contribution is as follows: 1. There is no other book that analyzes JB with such great precision and detail. It is an important addition to Blanc's 1964 volume on the various Baghdadi dialects. 2. This detailed analysis of JB can be a model for any textbook on an Arabic dialect. Especially valuable are the conclusions at the end of chapters 4, 9, 10, and 11. 3. Mansour manages to apply recent phonological findings to JB; he does so especially skillfully in the chapter on clusters, sonority, and anaptyxis. 4. The selection of the texts in part II is excellent ; scholars and students interested in the folklore and cultural life of Baghdadi Jews will find them especially useful. It is my sincere hope that this volume will be followed by an additional book that will treat the morphology of JB in more depth. Moreover, a syntactic analysis and a lexicon are desiderata. To conclude, despite the few minor faults described above, this is an important contribution to the understanding of Arabic dialectology on the one hand, and of Jewish languages on the other.
