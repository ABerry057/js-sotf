<plain_text><page sequence="1">Alan T. Levenson. Between Philosemitism and Antisemitism.: Defenses of Jews and Judaism in Germany, 1871-1932. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2004. xvi, 194 pp. The intense response to G6tz Aly's recently published book, Hitlers Volksstaat: Raub, Rassenkrieg und nationaler Sozialismus, attests to the continued interest in studies related to Germany's "Jewish Question" and the forces that motiv- ated German citizens to support National Socialism. The scholarship produced decades ago by Paul Massing, Peter Pulzer, Fritz Stem, and George Mosse and reenergized by Christopher Browning and Daniel Goldhagen in the 1990s has produced a rich and detailed analysis of the role that Jews occupied within the German national community. Not surprisingly, the origins and manifestations of anti-Semitism occupy center stage within this body of work, and less antagonistic relations between Jews and Gentiles in Germany receive scant attention. Studies that depict Gentile supporters of Jews and Judaism are virtually nonexistent. Alan Levenson's monograph, Between Philosemitism and Antisemitism, compels us to reconsider the continuum of attitudes toward Jews that existed in Germany from the establishment of the Kaiserreich to the advent of Nazism. The book's eight essays, all of which have been previously published, probe the limits of philosemit- ism within an anti-Semitic environment and flesh out the opposite end of the societal spectrum from those occupied by German anti-Semitism (xi). Philosemitism, according to Levenson, constitutes "any pro-Jewish or pro- Judaic utterance or act" (xii). Within Germany, there was no philosemitic tradition 206</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews or movement to speak of, and the vast majority of Gentiles who wrote in defense of Jews and Judaism did so in response to anti-Semitism. In many respects, philo- semitism can be understood as "anti-anti-Semitism." Like the German liberals who supported Jewish emancipation and integration, most philosemites harbored serious misgivings about the continued existence of Jews within German society. Operating within a context in which an "ingrained German antipathy toward Judentum" was accepted without reservation, philosemitic discourse was greatly circumscribed. To remain above reproach and avoid being labeled "Jewish," most Gentile supporters of Jews readily acknowledged Judaism's shortcomings and failings. They were also acutely aware that "the slightest Jewish contact deva- lued a defense of Judaism" (7). Gentile criticism of anti-Semitism, therefore, focused on its threat to Christianity or the rule of law, not on the fallacy of its underlying premises about Jews and their place in German society. Levenson per- suasively argues that "the defense of Jewish emancipation relied on the prop- osition that there was something wrong with antisemites, not that there was something right with Jews." "Good Jews" were viewed as "exceptional," and "positive Jewish qualities" were lauded for their compatibility with German Kultur (19). In chapter 2, Levenson explores philosemitic sentiments within the German peace movement, which was populated by "outspoken anti-antisemites" who col- laborated freely and equally with Jews. Berta von Suttner, a novelist and leading figure within the movement, viewed anti-Semitism and war as deleterious mani- festations of militarism, brutality, and cruelty, a common spirit against which she campaigned vigilantly. Von Suttner was an avowed secularist, whereas others within the movement, such as Friedrich Wilhelm Foerster and Heinrich Coudenhove-Kalergi, combated anti-Semitism from a "Christian, assimilationist" perspective that viewed conversion as the ultimate solution to the Jewish Question. Although both groups ultimately expected Jews to "become indistinguishable from other Germans," the German Peace Society provided an example of a "neutral society" critical to Jewish emancipation and social integration (42). The book's third and fourth chapters take the reader into the realms of German literature and missionary Protestantism, where the author uncovers philo- semitic sentiments, albeit limited in scope and appeal. Challenging the assumption that German literature since Lessing's Nathan failed to produce sympathetic por- trayals of Jews and Judaism, Levenson's close reading of relatively obscure novels reveals Jews depicted favorably. The goodwill of authors who wrote in this genre, however, did little to resolve the "problematical German-Jewish encounter" (63). The same could also be said about missionary activists Franz Delitzsch and Hermann Strack, both of whom defended Judaism while seeking to convert Jews. Though convinced of Christianity's theological superiority, both men opposed German anti-Semitism and contributed positively to Jewish scholarship. The irony of this situation is not lost on Levenson, who comments that "German Jews would have risked the threat of a few more apostates for a few more defenders of the caliber of Delitzsch and Strack" (90). In the monograph's closing chapters, Levenson's analytical gaze turns to "Philosemitic Tendencies and Individuals" and challenges readers to broaden 207</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews their perceptions of philosemitism. The chapters on the Gentile reception to Herzlian Zionism, a "Jewish" reading of Thomas Mann's Joseph and His Brothers, and Selig Cassel and Edith Stein's postapostasy positive Jewish self-identification push the examples of philosemitism to the limit. Stretching the boundaries of philosemitism is necessary within an environment in which pro-Jewish acts or utterances did not always present themselves as such. Between Philosemitism and Antisemitism reveals the paradoxical situation occupied by German Jews from their emancipation until the demise of German democracy under the aegis of National Socialism. Increased social integration was countered by a pervasive sense of Jewish otherness. Individuals and organi- zations that sought to promote a homogenous German culture challenged Jewish opportunities for educational and professional advancement. Alan Levenson poignantly reminds us that even in Germany, where the dominant societal impulses appeared to be perpetually hostile to all things Jewish, countervailing forces existed. As we are painfully aware, however, the failure to nurture this balance was disastrous. Perhaps late nineteenth-century German history has more to teach us about contemporary society than is often suspected. In this regard, Levenson's underlying thesis is right on target.
