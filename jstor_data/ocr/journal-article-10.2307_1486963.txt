In A History of Habsburg Jews, 1670-1918, William O. McCagg, Jr., attempts to redress the im- balance in Jewish historiography, arguing that Habsburg Jewry provides an alternative model of Jewish modernization because it was "fuller in scope" than West European Jewish communities, while its experience was "less painful" than that of the Jews of Russia. Because of the nearly insurmount- able linguistic obstacles to studying Habsburg Jews, no one has attempted such an ambitious project before. McCagg, an eminent Habsburg historian with the amazing ability to read the literature in German, Czech, Polish, and Hungarian, but not Yiddish or Hebrew, focuses here on the issue of modernization and on those sectors of the Jewish population that were on its cutting edge. His is an extremely interesting and suggestive, but also problematic book. McCagg argues that Jewish modernization involved "self-denial," or "self-demolition," that is, the rejection of the national dimension of Jewish identity. This denial, he points out, was facilitated by the fact that nine- teenth-century Austria itself never developed a modern national identity in the style of the Western nation states. With no positive nationalism to over- whelm them, modernizing Jews felt freer to form a new identity. At least before 1848, Jews could deny their own national identity without having to "convert" to another one. Most modernizing Jews chose a German cultural orientation, but they did not thereby became Germans. They were Austrian, not members of any particular national group. Unfortunately, much to McCagg's regret, the nationality conflict which beset the monarchy in the late nineteenth century ended any hope for the full-blown development of this Habsburg Jewish path to modernity. Habsburg Jewry splintered, as Jews responded to the new pressure to abandon German for Hungarian, Czech, and Polish. A united Habsburg Jewry-if such a thing ever exist- ed-shared the fate of the Habsburg multinational state. Clearly the crafting of a new Jewish identity in modernity was more com- plicated in multinational Austria than in the West, but it was even more complicated than McCagg allows. Most Jews in Austria-Hungary persisted in their Austrian identities down to the dissolution of the monarchy in 1918, despite the fact that many of them had chosen new "national" identities. More importantly, the fact that the Habsburg monarchy never developed a modern national-political identity also had the opposite effect than the one McCagg emphasizes. Indeed, Habsburg Jewry used the opportunities creat- ed by a supranational state in which the nationalities vied with each other</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 329 for greater autonomy to assert Jewish ethnic identity. Faced, for example, with the need to choose between Germans and Czechs in Bohemia and Mor- avia or between Poles and Ruthenes in Galicia, many Jews decided to iden- tify as Jews. The strength of Zionism and diaspora Jewish nationalism in Galicia, Bukovina, and even Vienna reveals the high level of Jewish ethnic identity in the Habsburg monarchy. So too does the reality of masses of utterly traditional Jews in Galicia and Hungary. There are many strengths to McCagg's book. He does well to emphasize the role of the state in fostering Jewish modernization and in determining the German orientation of Habsburg Jews, and the role of schools in facili- tating modernization all over. He also reminds us of the significance of such factors as economic prosperity, size and density of the Jewish community, and attitude of Jewish communal leaders in determining the course of Jewish modernization. Bohemian Jews experienced early and profound modernization because of state policy, the willingness of Jewish communal leaders to accept a conservative version of secular education, and the small size of the Bohemian Jewish community. In Galicia, on the other hand, local autonomy, extreme Jewish population density, and the vigorous opposition of traditional Jewish leaders to modernity meant that few Galician Jews abandoned tradition in the ninteenth century. Despite similar obstacles, more Jews modernized in Hungary than in Galicia because the local nobility encouraged such modernization and because Hungary was more pros- perous. McCagg also broadens Jacob Katz's concept of the "neutral space" in which Jews and non-Jews first came to associate with each other beyond Enlightenment intellectuals to the circles of leading businessmen. His point is very appealing, since economically generated neutral space could affect more people than could literary salons. Unfortunately, McCagg does not offer proof that Jewish and non-Jewish businessmen really did mingle socially. On the other hand, McCagg does argue convincingly that the exis- tence of an already assimilated group of Jews played a major role in the granting to the Jews of emancipation, but here he trivializes his own point by emphasizing Jewish assimilation to Viennese kitsch, and he ignores the very real role of liberal ideology in emancipation. A History of Habsburg Jewry suffers from some serious flaws. In the first place, despite his impressive linguistic abilities, McCagg does not know the Jewish languages, Yiddish and Hebrew. As a result, he misunderstands Galician and Hungarian Jewry. He argues, for example, that Hungarian</page><page sequence="4">330 BOOK REVIEWS rabbis were much more open to modern, secular culture than were their Galician counterparts. Such an argument ignores the aggressive anti- modernism of the disciples of the IHatam Sofer and of Hungarian Hasidim. Of course, McCagg does not have to understand Hasidism if he is focusing on people at the cutting edge of modernization. Yet, not reading the Jewish sources also makes him ignore the important role of Zionism and diaspora Jewish nationalism, especially in Galicia and Bukovina. Another serious problem in this book is the fact that McCagg overem- phasizes the role of converts from Judaism to Christianity in Jewish modernization. McCagg goes too far when he says, for example, that the late-eighteenth-century convert Joseph von Sonnenfels provided the Jews with an important role model, perhaps even more important than Moses Mendelssohn. McCagg forgets that most Jews who sought to modernize wanted to do so as Jews, not as Christians. There is nothing modern about integration through baptism. Finally, this reviewer wishes the book had been edited with more care so that some obvious errors would have been corrected. McCagg, for example, refers to the Agudath Yisrael as the Agudas; he labels the integrationist Osterreichische Wochenschrift a Jewish nationalist newspaper; he says that the majority of Galician Jews in Vienna married non-Galician Jews when counting women reveals that the opposite was the case; he reports an incor- rect population figure for Vienna Jews in 1910; and he assumes that all Jewish "business employees" were industrial managers when most of them were clerks and salesmen for commercial enterprises. Despite the errors, A History of Habsburg Jewry makes an important contribution to our understanding of Jewish modernization. Perhaps the Habsburg model was not quite what McCagg claims it to be. Nevertheless, the Jews of East Central Europe did have a different experience in moder- nity than did the Jews of Germany or Russia. Political context is obviously a crucial ingredient in the modern Jewish experience. Marsha L. Rozenblit University of Maryland College Park, Md.</page></plain_text>
