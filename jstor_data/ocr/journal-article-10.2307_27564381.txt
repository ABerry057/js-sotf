Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2005. xvii, 400 pp. doi: 10.1017/S03640094080013 84 Shaul Magid's Easidism on the Margin is a rich and erudite study of the Izbica/Radzin literary tradition, one of the most distinctive and radical streams within Hasidism. While there have been a number of studies of Mordekhai Yosef Leiner of Izbica and his Mei ha-shiloah, these studies have generally focused on the author's well-known deterministic pronouncement that "all is in 441</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews the hands of heaven, even the fear of heaven," as well as on the radical justification of biblical sins and sinners. Magid's work goes beyond the earlier studies in a number of distinct ways: First, his study focuses on the tradition as it is fleshed out by R. Mordekhai's grandson, Gershon Henokh Leiner of Radzin, in a program matic work entitled Ea-hakdamah vehapetihah. Because Gershon Henokh was Mordekhai Yosef's disciple and editor, Magid uses the grandson's works as a key to unlock the enigmatic style of the grandfather. Second, Magid trains his lens on the hermeneutical assumptions of the Leiner family. To this end, Magid charts Gershon Henokh's use of Maimonides' hermeneutical assumption about scripture's "wily, gracious ruse" (i.e., the Torah's concession to human needs in its fashioning of stories and commandments while maintaining a higher, esoteric spiritual goal for the elite) as a guiding light for his own treatment of what he calls the "Torah of Yosef and the "Torah of Yehudah," a duality that structures the Jewish relationship to God, law, and redemption. Third, this is one of the first studies to treat Hasidism in the context of meta-halakhic Jewish literature, incor porating both Kabbalah and medieval Jewish philosophy and their attention to epistemology and esotericism, which, in this instance, are the essential philosophi cal categories structuring Izbica-Radzin thought. Fourth, though Scholem's use of the term "antinomianism" had a long-lasting impact on research into Jewish mysti cism, this book is the first to seriously consider the definition and parameters of that term. Finally, while other scholars have attended to the prevalence of messia nic aspirations in Hasidism, Magid attends to the distinctive construction of the messianic personality in the Izbica/Radzin tradition. The first part of the book, "The Piety of Secrecy: Esotericism, Faith, and the Hasidic Construction of Origins," is a detailed examination of Ea-hakdamah vehapetihah, Gershon Henokh Leiner's reconstruction of the dialectical history of esoteric concealment and revelation. From Abraham through the succession of his descendants, continuing with the revelations at Sinai, the publication of the Zohar (by Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai as per traditional belief), and the philoso phical writings of Maimonides, Gershon Henokh views Jewish history as a series of disclosures of divine secrets. This esoteric lore will only be fully revealed at the time of redemption, but until that time, various figures reveal esoteric lore to the extent that they are privy to it. Thus, Melchizedek reveals a monotheistic belief but conceals immanence, a feature of divinity revealed by Abraham. These two bib lical figures mark the divide between a rational monotheism and a miraculous monotheism, between concealment and revelation. Later stages of this dialectic emerge in the relationship of rabbinic writings and Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai's pub lication of the Zohar, and then in the writings of Maimonides in relation to Hasid ism. In each case, the latter figures serve to clarify and illumine the esoteric doctrines that had been concealed by the former. There was a long-standing legend that Maimonides had turned to kabbalistic thought late in his life, but Gershon Henokh is the first to have incorporated Maimonides into a history of Jewish esotericism. The second part, "Hasidism and the Hermeneutical Turn: Reading Scripture Against Itself," trains its focus on the issues informing Izbica-Radzin tradition's hermeneutic: free will, determinism, esotericism, and messianism. It is in the 442</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews biblical pairs of Yehudah/Yosef and Zimri/Pinhas that the Izbica/Radzin vision unfolds. Magid expresses the tension between these two poles succinctly with regard to the Yehudah/Yosef paradigm: "The final reconciliation of these personality types is Joseph's understanding of how Judah's relationship to God cannot be expressed solely within the confines of the halakhic life. The inability of the Judah archetype to live solely within the halakhah results from his inner drive to act outside it and his understanding that that drive (i.e., his will) is iden tical to God's will" (120). Ultimately, this paves the way for a vision of the obso lescence of the commandments, a central feature of Magid's readings of both Mordekhai Yosef and Gershon Henokh. Magid argues that the nullification of commandments, an idea posited in rabbinic literature for the End of Days and used explicitly or implicitly in much of Jewish mystical literature as a way of thinking about the spiritualization of the Torah and its laws, is held in tension with the temporal requirement to observe the law for all figures, even the proto messianic personalities such as Yaakov and Yehudah. By distinguishing between human perfection and historical redemption, both Mordekhai Yosef and Gershon Henokh strive for a balance between the permanence and obsoles cence of commandments. Once Yaakov develops self-consciousness as a protomessianic figure, sin becomes obsolete for Israel, relegated to non-Jews alone. The conceptual elimin ation of sin for the descendants of Yaakov makes any subsequent Israelite sin a challenge for the exegete. Because Magid demonstrates that for Gershon Henokh the fundamental ontological framework is established with the pair Yosef/Yehudah, all other biblical sins require rereading. Among the various examples of Gershon Henokh's interpretation of biblical narratives of transgres sion, Israelite sinfulness receives its greatest apologetic argument in the case of the Pinhas-Zimri narrative, which, Magid argues, is "the epicenter of the Izbica/ Radzin worldview and not merely a curious aberration" (175). Here, too, the mes sianic personality Zimri recognizes God's highest will, in contrast to Pinhas, who only comprehends God's will through the conventions of the commandments. Moshe 's reticence in the matter embodies the tension between the two different and crucial impulses, expressed by the two fundamental biblical figures. Yosef and Yehudah emerge as two types manifesting two seminal approaches to law: Yosef as the master of restraint, operating within the norms of the law, and Yehudah as the proponent of a vision that exceeds the law when necessary. Magid says pointedly that the hermeneutical edge of the "Izbica/Radzin exegesis is a reading of the Bible from the vantage point of Yehudah" (169). In the final part, "The Law and Its Discontents," Magid turns his attention to the question of antinomianism. Following a historical discussion of determinism and antinomianism, primarily within a Christian framework, with special attention to Calvinist thought, Magid argues that Izbica/Radzin Hasidism offers "a soft anti nomianism, whereby the law is undermined yet protected, or supplanted yet not erased, resulting in twin mediations, halakhah for the unenlightened and devekut for the enlightened. It is precisely the ideational erasure of the law by the enlightened?although they themselves by and large observe the law?that prepares the world for the final fulfillment of the law as an overcoming of the 443</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews law." Magid suggests that "Hasidism presents a religious critique, founded on piety, that sets the stage, at least ideationally, for future religious reform" (203). Zeev Gries had written that the hasid is first and foremost a man of halakhah. If this is so even for the Izbica/Radzin tradition, it puts an enormous burden of secrecy and continence on the messianic personality as Magid defines it. It is only through an ascetic stance and extensive berurim, the self-evaluation required of the righteous, that one can determine whether one ought to violate the halakhah. While one does not normally associate pietism with antinomianism, Magid argues that both are modes of critiques of religious culture, often sharing determinist underpinnings. Thus, Jewish antinomianism, in a premodern context, usually results in supererogatory rather than antinomian behavior. At the very least, what emerges in Magid's reading of the soft antinomianism of Izbica/Radzin is comparable to the Maimonidean approach to the commandments even after the personal utility of any given commandment has been exhausted: "Piety is the sub mission to the overarching principle of mitzvot?to occupy oneself with God, even as the specific mitzvah may no longer serve any constructive function" (233). While largely enriched by this book, I take exception to some of the formu lations, which I would consider to be anachronistic. The tensions of the Yosef/ Yehudah relationship serve as an organizing theme in the book. Magid represents Yehudah as Gershon Henokh's hero, and, without doubt, it is the Yehudah-angle that is distinctive in his thought. Magid tips his hand, however, when he formu lates the two purposes for halakhah in Izbica-Radzin: (1) to keep the messianic personality rooted in the protomessianic world, and (2) living in tension inside the halakhah by "extending its elasticity" (240). Is Gershon Henokh indeed inter ested in "elasticity" in the halakhah? Or is this a retrojection from within the framework of contemporary Jewish denominations? Creative tension rather than elasticity seems to be the goal. A similar retrojection occurs when Magid suggests that Mordekhai Yosef is "elevating the stature of individual experience" in his attention to the messianic personality (225). Here, too, "individual experience" seems too modern a formulation, and, to the modern audience, it connotes an epis temological foundation for religious commitment, whereas for the Izbica-Radzin tradition, it is only the most rarefied individual who attends to his experience. There are also technical and literary problems in the book that hamper the reading of it and, with regard to one issue, its usability. There is an unfortunate profusion of jarring transliterations (e.g., yen ah rather than yir 'ah); citations of prooftexts are sometimes incorrect or confusing; the index is structured primarily around names of figures, so there are no independent entries for central themes such as "doubt," "faith," and "free will," which is decidedly unhelpful; and finally, while the book is generally quite readable if difficult, there are times in which the density of the prose is baffling. Notwithstanding these critiques, Shaul Magid's study offers a cogent and learned analysis of the primary themes and tensions within the Izbica/Radzin tra dition. He has offered compelling readings of the often enigmatic Mei ha-shiloah and of the overarching systems proposed by Gershon Henokh. Placing discussions of hasidic writers in the context of hermeneutics and antinomianism also entails important reorientations of the approach to these topics in Jewish studies. 444</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews As such, the work is indispensable for any Jewish studies collection and for scholars interested in Hasidism and questions of hermeneutics, messianism, antinomianism, and approaches to law.
