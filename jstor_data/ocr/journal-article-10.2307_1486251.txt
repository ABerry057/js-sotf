Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College Press, 1983. 332 pp. The notion that "one who wants to be pious should observe the laws of [tractate] Nezikin" (B. Bava Kamma 30a) may explain why Stephen Passa-</page><page sequence="2">258 BOOK REVIEWS maneck has translated the section of the Shulban Arukh treating the laws of sale. Since these laws deal with everyday matters still current in modern society, he believes that the rabbinic laws on the subject are not "obscure and arcane" but provide the reader with a direct experience of Judaism as a legal and ethical system. As we shall see, however, while Passamaneck points to certain features of the legal system, he lets the text itself convey the overall message; hence it is to those interested in that text that the work is most useful. The bulk of the 73-page introductory material is a synopsis of the Shulhan Arukh that makes preliminary comparisons with Roman and medieval civil and canon laws of sale. The translation, running 195 pages, is followed by 49 pages of notes and a 13-page index. Passamaneck bases the translation on the Vilna 1871 edition of the Shulhan Arukh, and, although not purporting to provide a critical text, annotates where the earlier editions have a different reading. Observing that the Shulban Arukh often was "corrected" to conform to readings of parallel passages in the Tur Shulban Arukh, the Mishneh Torah, and the Babylonian Talmud, he pro- vides a model of how to assess variants in the text of the Shulhan Arukh.' The translation is faithful to the original, though not literal, and excellent in finding proper English equivalents for the Hebrew legal terminology. Parenthetical comments add to the intelligibility of the rendering. Using the translation with the original will therefore aid as well the nonexpert in- terested in becoming familiar with the Shulban Arukh's style. Since Passamaneck is concerned solely with the Shulbhan Arukh, and his notes at most direct the reader to earlier and parallel sources, the volume does not offer a history of the law of sale. Indeed, even more than other works in Mishpat Ivri, it does not relate the material to nonlegal issues. The introductory synopsis does make stimulating comparisons, but, as Passa- maneck states, they must be further pursued. Take, for example, the notion of the effectuation of a sale. In Roman law the bare consent, as in the writing of a contract, effected acquisition, while in rabbinic law consent had to be accompanied by a formal act, such as the conveyance of the object. His- torians of Judaism may associate this position with the view already well attested in early rabbinic sources that intent must be expressed not merely by mental thoughts but in action. 1. Notably, while interested in variants found in medieval works and citations, Passa- maneck does not bring into the discussion manuscript readings of the talmudic literature.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 259 Passamaneck has thus produced a competent though narrowly defined translation of an important medieval Jewish work. Although as a code the Shul#han Arukh levels variations and developments (notwithstanding the glosses of Moses Isserles) and offers a picture of an ideal legal system apply- ing legal principles, it nonetheless played a formative role in many Jewish communities and thus may help illuminate aspects of medieval Jewish civil life. But other research will have to trace the intersection of the legal and social and religious trends. This volume will therefore be useful to those desiring an excellent English rendering of such a code, whether for itself or for research, and to those interested in mastering the Shulban Arukh's Hebrew style or in assessing its textual history.
