<plain_text><page sequence="1">David Aberbach. Realism, Caricature, and Bias: The Fiction of Mendele Mocher Sefarim. London: Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 1993. 131 PP. David Aberbach's study of Mendele's fiction reminds us of the centrality of this literary figure and the difficulties faced by those who seek to translate the cultural milieu in which he flourished. Explicating the fiction of an author</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 185 whose writing was equally influential in Yiddish and Hebrew, and whose name has become synonymous with the Jewish Enlightenment, is a formidable task. It demands, at the very least, a consideration of such theoretical concerns as literary allusion and intertextuality, historical transformations in all their social, political, and psychological volatility, and Jewish culture at its emergence into modernity. In the case of Sh. Y. Abramovitch/Mendele, it also requires an exploration of the very name of this founding father of modern Hebrew and Yiddish prose. Whether we think of him as Abramovitch, the maskil (follower of the Enlightenment), Mendele Mocher Sefarim, the Hebrew-speaking and -writing bookpeddler, or Mendele Moykher Sforim, the Yiddish-speakingfolksmentsh, the centrality of this figure in any consideration of modern Jewish culture is indisputable. Despite his importance, however, he has become increasingly inaccessible to readers of Jewish fiction. His Yiddish prose, layered with Hebrew and biblical allusions, and his now seemingly heightened Hebrew prose make the original texts elusive and translation difficult. Added to such difficulties are satiric and often bleak views of Eastern European Jewry that may be unsettling to contemporary readers schooled in a more nostalgic understanding of the past and unresponsive to the extraordinarily textured cultural idiom of this fiction. The writer whom Sholem Aleichem called der zeyde ("the grandfather") of Yiddish literature wrote most of his stories first in Yiddish, offering later versions in Hebrew that were, as Aberbach observes, less translations than reworkings of their Yiddish originals. Aberbach joins those critics who view Mendele's primary achievement as giving "modern Hebrew literary prose the breath of life via Yiddish" (p. 11). But the construction of Yiddish as the handmaiden to enduring Hebrew, the paucity of Yiddish critical sources in this study, and the consistent reliance on Hebrew editions of these works underscores Aberbach's repeated privileging of Hebrew texts. He does argue convincingly that Mendele broke new ground in Hebrew literature, anticipating writers like Eliot and Joyce in his adaptations of traditional sources to modernist sensibilities. There is even a provocative comparison between Abramovitch and Charlie Chaplin with a bow to Dickens: artists whose familiarity with childhood traumas, poverty, and loss led to a similar "bittersweet mix of laughter and sentiment" (p. 29). And, finally, Aberbach acknowledges the influence of Russian culture on Mendele. Despite such comparisons, the charged relationship of author to language remains the most noteworthy aspect of this study. Abramovitch, Aberbach</page><page sequence="3">186 BOOK REVIEWS claims, could not abide hearing Hebrew spoken. After the pogroms of the 1880s Abramovitch introduced the figure of Mendele into stories he wrote in Hebrew, having reserved earlier manifestations of that character for Yiddish originals and their Hebrew adaptations. Along with other Hebrew writers, he also eschewed satire in favor of social allegory at this time. It is difficult to reconcile the figure of Mendele, Abramovitch's most energetic, talkative figure, with an authorial distaste for the sounds of the Hebrew language his most remarkable creation was purported to speak. The problem of authorial identity presents an even greater difficulty, one that emerges as Aberbach's primary concern and is made even more acute by the critic's initial insistence upon, subsequent attenuation and final elision of the distinctions between Abramovitch and Mendele. Given Dan Miron's definitive A Traveler Disguised (1973), it is surprising to find "Mendele" understood as no more than a "pen-name" used by Abramovitch. Aberbach argues that the two have only superficial differences and that their remarkable similarities are revealed by the kinds of psychological analyses he provides. Aberbach thus attributes to the character Mendele, rather than to the author Abramovitch, both the maskilic interests that critics have traditionally associated with the author's fiction as well as the intense insecurity and Jewish self-hate that Aberbach claims were also characteristic. More than an argument about the poetics of pseudonyms or masks, this blurring of distinctions is, in fact, central to the thesis of Realism, Caricature, and Bias. "Mendele's satires of the Jews and of himself are seen to run parallel to one another: his portrayal of the Jews is virtually a self-portrait" (p. 7). Presenting the view of Mendele as "the familiar embarrassing, lovable image of the traditional, impoverished Jew whom Abramowitz [sic, Aberbach's spelling] would not have allowed into the house when his son [a revolutionary and a convert] was there" (p. 29), Aberbach goes on to suggest that "Mendele's Jewish self-hate was so strong that brief acquaintances who caught him at a bad moment could come away convinced that he was a rabid antisemite" (p. 48) or, in a parallel vein, that "the central, formative trauma of Mendele's early life is . . . the death of his father when he was 13 or 14" (p. 87), a trauma which led him to a rejection of his father's religious orthodoxy, to a hatred of authority, and to recurrent uncertainties about masculine identity. Ultimately, according to Aberbach, these tendencies meant that "Mendele knowingly projected elements of his own pathology on to the Jews" (p. 106). Such analyses underscore the extent to which this study deliberately collapses the distinctions not only between author and character but also</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 187 between fiction and autobiography, the self and society. This approach may be designed to make the texts of the most significant Jewish literary figure of the nineteenth century more accessible, but it also diverts attention from the social, political, and cultural innovations long associated with Mendele's name.
