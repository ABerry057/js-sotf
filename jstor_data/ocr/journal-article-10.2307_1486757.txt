The first three books under review treat the history of racial categories, and racial prejudice, in the United States as the key to understanding the evolution of modem American Jewish identity. The traditional explanations of the economic and social mobility enjoyed since the late nineteenth century by Jewish immigrants and their descendants--e.g., high levels of literacy and educational aspiration, 1.

What really matters is the advantage of historically constructed "whiteness."2 The fourth book explores the extent of Jewish involvement in the Atlantic slave trade which originated America's racial dilemma. Berkeley political scientist Michael Rogin's Blackface, White Noise is a study of blackface minstrelsy and racial imagery in the first half-century of American films. It is heavily indebted for context to Neal Gabler's popular book, An Empire of Their Own (1989), on how "the Jews invented Hollywood." Nor entirely new is its central thesis that the rite of passage from European to American was fostered by white performers---primarily, after 1900, immigrant Jews (succeeding Irish Americans)-who assumed the blackface mask. Over twenty years ago, Irving Howe analyzed how for performers like Al Jolson, Eddie Cantor, George Jessel, and Sophie Tucker, and for composers like Irving Berlin and George Gershwin, "black became a mask for Jewish expressiveness, with one woe speaking through the voice of another."3 What distinguishes this book is the extremes to which it takes its condem- natory vision of "Jewish Americanization through racism" (p. 254). According to Rogin, "Jews acquired American credentials by, in this racially divided society, taking control of the black role" (p. 17). "Allowed to rise above the people whose cause and whose music they made their own" (p. 68), many Jews acquired "their own stain of shame" (p. 11) by "expropriating black music" (p. 103). "It was not just that antiblack racism was the badge of belonging in the United States," the author asserts, "but that the badge was worn as blackface, and often by Jews" (p. 64). American nationalism, "contaminated" (p. 38) by its "blackface past," prefigures America's "apartheid future" (p. 253). "A single image," Rogin tells us, "inspired the present study: Al Jolson, born Jackie Rabinowitz in The Jazz Singer and reborn as Jack Robin, singing 'My Mammy' in blackface to his immigrant Jewish mother" (p. 5). Indeed, 2. For the new "white studies" movement seeking to deconstruct white privilege, see the journal Race Traitor, edited by Noel Ignatiev and John Garvey, and Joe L. Kincheloe, Shirley R.

(1930), made during Hollywood's intense but relatively short infatuation with blackface movies. An enthusiast of the Frankfurt School's Freudianized Marxism and Jacques Lacan's postmodernism, Rogin offers jargon-laden theoretical glosses on blackface that can be difficult to digest.4 The author of a previous book on Herman Melville, Rogin here rivals Ahab's hunt for the White Whale in his own intrepid quest to use the key of blackface to decipher every "sinister paradox" (p. 112) of American culture. Hence, in addition to "literal blackface" films, Rogin analyzes the many guises of "metaphorical blackface" (p. 252). These include films like Gone With the Wind (1939), in which black actors were limited to servile roles, and even antiracist postwar films featuring stellar black protagonists like Home of the Brave (1949) and No Way Out (1950), which Rogin mercilessly dissects as symptomatic of the racially patronizing attitudes of the Popular Front, usually the Jewish filmmakers who made them. Nathan Glazer, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and historians Oscar Handlin and Stanley Elkins are among those lampooned as practitioners of scholarly "liberal blackface" (pp. 247-248, 261-263). Even more broadly, Rogin views the Black-Jewish civil rights alliance as political blackface in which Jewish "ventriloquists" (p. 99) served as "mouthpieces" (p. 10) for African Americans who were not allowed to speak "for Jews" (p. 17) or unconstrainedly for themselves (p. 257). Rogin is aware but unfazed that some will find in his book echoes of "Henry Ford's ravings about 'Jewish supremacy in the motion picture world'" (p. 89), of Nazi and McCarthyite gibes against malevolently self-interested Jewish manipulation of race relations (pp. 58, 212), and of more recent accusations by Minister Louis Farrakhan and Professor Leonard Jeffries that Hollywood is a Jewish-controlled conspiracy against African Americans (p. 16). While Rogin's motives have not been questioned, Blackface, White Noise has been criticized for arbitrariness by scholars of Black-Jewish relations and 4. For example, "the fetish condenses the unanalyzed magical significance assigned to blacks, functioning like the substitute phallus in Freud's analysis and like the commodity in Marx's. Signifying transvestite masquerade and expropriation of black labor, burnt cork fetishized not only blackness but sexual difference and the commodity form as well. But though blackface is detachable and reattachable-like Freud's fetish-making visible the pleasure of putting on and taking off burnt cook may seem to violate the Marxian/Freudian rule that demystifying the fetish interferes with its work" (pp. 182-183).</page><page sequence="4">328 HAROLD BRACKMAN movie industry history whose work it selectively deploys.5 Its one-dimensional interpretation of minstrelsy on both stage and screen also fails seriously to engage more nuanced interpretations. Where Rogin sees unalloyed racist denigration, others see racial ambivalence combined with class subversion of the cultural inhibitions of Victorian America.6 In terms of Black-Jewish relations in twentieth-century popular culture, Maria Damon has demonstrated that Jewish musician Milton "Mezz" Mez- zrow embraced African American jazz during the 1930s and 1940s, not to assimilate, but to put as much distance as possible between himself and the white middle class.7 Where Rogin dismisses Jewish musicians during the 1920s as "white noise" drowning out black creativity, Ann Douglas points to Sophie Tucker's repertoire, which combined "My Yiddishe Mama" with songs by African American composers, as "proof that Jewish and Negro musical styles and influence could and often did flow seamlessly together."' While Jewish institutional and financial support helped nurture the post- World War I Harlem Renaissance, the cultural relativism of Jewish anthro- pologists Franz Boas and Melville Herskovitz, according to Wilson J. Moses, were laying the foundations for what are now known as multiculturalism and Afrocentrism.9 During the Depression and World War II, Jewish Communists, according to Gerald Home were much more prone to accommodate than "dominate" African American Communists.10 Before Hollywood absorbed 5.

Douglas calls such multifaceted creative interchanges between Jews and African Americans "cultural miscegenation." (Rogin also does not explain why Jewish borrowing from black popular culture is theft, but African American indebtedness to the Book of Exodus for a liberation theology is not.) Even in today's politically correct environment, Anne Pelligrini shows how Jewish lesbian comedienne Sandra Bernhardt still satirically "blackens up" in order to act out the permeability of racial and sexual boundaries and the hybridity of American culture.'2 In parallel fashion, African American actress Anna Deavere Smith played Jewish and African American characters of both genders in her one-woman play Fires in the Mirror, dramatizing the tragedy in Brooklyn's Crown Heights.'3 Rogin follows his own dictum that "the contemporary critic" need not be bound by the intention of the performer or the reaction of the audience. He has anachronistic disdain for how both Jewish and African American film audiences of an earlier era viewed The Jazz Singer, for example. Despite the sensational innovation of sound, there is no evidence that Jewish audiences shared Rogin's fixation on Jolson's corking up for the climactic song. A Yiddish reviewer was pleased that "the son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world's history."'4 Otherwise, the film seems to have been viewed as one among many generational-conflict dramas about the contradictory demands of tradition and ambition; among these was the play Der vilner balebesl, also about a cantor's son who has to choose between filial obedience and artistic success, not on Broadway singing jazz in blackface to an audience that includes both his Party," in The Narrow Bridge: Jewish Views on Multiculturalism, ed.

W. Griffith's virulently racist Birth of a Nation (1915)."7 Rogin has only weak explanations of why African American audiences a decade later enthused over The Jazz Singer and an African American newspaper editorialized of Jolson that "every colored performer is proud of him" (pp. 196-197). The reader skeptical of Rogin's claim to superior insight may take seriously his joke that his own "attack on blackface may simply be another way of putting it on" (p. 99). In How Jews Became White Folks, Karen Brodkin, a UCLA anthropolo- gist, utilizes family history (her own) and social commentary to complement Rogin's picture of American Jewry's embourgeoisement at the expense of African Americans. According to Brodkin, Jews and other European immigrants experienced a "temporary darkening during the period when they formed the core of the industrial working class" (p. 76). After World War II, however, in a period of declining antisemitism, they renegotiated their "ethno-racial assignment" (pp. 22, 103) and were extended "white privilege" by participating in "affirmative action programs for Euromales" (e.g., the GI Bill, FHA home loans) who were guilty of "institutionalized racism" against African Americans (pp. 38-43). "Jewish ethnic wisdom" that Jews "pulled themselves up by their own bootstraps" is largely mythical (pp. 26, 50-51). It has been perpetrated by male Jewish intellectuals--"somewhere between wannabes and nouveau arrivistes, accepted as white, but not securely" (p. 153)-whose celebration of the Jewish "model minority" and deprecation of black "deficit culture" contrasted "'good' Jewishness ... with 'bad' African Americanness" (p. 146). Public intellectuals like Nathan Glazer and Norman Podhoretz were also responsible for the adoption of "images like Jewish 15.

Brodkin characterizes her own grandmother as a racist for calling the Jamaican immigrant maid whom the family hired after moving to a Long Island suburb in 1949 "the shwartze" (pp. 17-18). Even so, she nostalgically venerates "the Yiddishkeits of memory" (p. 187)-a lost world where "a hege- monic Jewish socialism" (p. 104) ostensibly immunized her grandparents' generation against the acids of capitalist modernity (pp. 106, 186).18 In those "messianic" (p. 186) days of yore, Jews were symbolically black or at least "off-white" (p. 1) by virtue of their poverty and persecution. Given her claim to be a radical who has outgrown her earlier Jewish and New Left romanticisms (pp. 19, 170-171), Brodkin's sentimental vision of the pristine Lower East Side ironically resonates with Al Jolson's vocal tributes to his imaginary "Old Folks at Home" on the Southern plantations.'9 Quite unconvincing as an analysis of Black-Jewish relations, a subject which she treats as if there were no such thing as a successful African American middle class that increasingly defines itself in competition with Jews,20 Brodkin's stylistically accessible book can be read with cautious edification as a participant-observer's account of "gender wars" within Jewish America. In Whiteness of a Different Color, Matthew Frye Jacobson, who teaches American Studies at Yale, treats the evolution of American Jewish identity in the context of two centuries of evolving conceptions of racial classifications and consciousness in the United States. Jacobson recognizes that "the Jews' version of becoming Caucasian" (p. 172) is rooted in the distinctive history of antisemitism in both Europe and the United States. Yet he argues for viewing the American Jewish experience comparatively with that of other immigrant groups in terms of a three-stage periodization: 1790-1840, when all European newcomers were accepted as "presumptively white" and entitled to full citizenship rights (pp. 15-28); 1840-1924, when a nativist reaction resulted 18.

Jacobson's approach frames an important twentieth-century change in how American Jews were viewed, and sometimes viewed themselves, between 1915, when Leo Frank was lynched in Georgia, having earlier been wrongfully convicted of raping and murdering a gentile factory girl, on the basis of the testimony of his African American janitor (pp. 62-67), and 1947, when the film version of Laura Z. Hobson's novel Gentleman 's Agreement, starring Gregory Peck, dramatized antisemitism as the misperception that Jews "looked different" from other whites (pp. 125-131). Jacobson's research is wide-ranging in legislative debates and law codes, judicial opinions, and scientific (and pseudo-scientific) treatises, as well as literature and popular culture. Mercifully jargon-free, Jacobson's finely written book also manages to keep fairly tight rein on ideological predispo- sitions-for example, that the United States is exceptional primarily for its racial pathology--that are freely vented by Rogin and Brodkin. The book does, however, have limitations. First, despite the discussion of the Frank case and of "frontier race relations" (pp. 155-161), it does not deal in sustained fashion with ongoing regional differences between North, West, and South. Particularly with regard to Southern Jews, with a history of being viewed as "neither fish nor fowl" by both white and black Southern gentiles,21 Jacobson provides very little clarification of whether they benefited or suffered in terms of racial hierarchization from their distinctive regional exposure.22 Second, despite Jacobson's recognition of antisemitism's long transatlantic history, his analysis does not go back far enough to properly gauge its impact on American race relations. He cites James Shapiro's 21. Eugene Levy, "'Is the Jew a White Man?': Press Reaction to the Leo Frank Case, 1913-1915," Phylon 35 (Summer 1974): 212-222; Richard M.

Granting his argument that the participants in the European mass immigration to the United States enjoyed, even during difficult times, advantages as "probationary whites," this hardly justifies, without further analysis of the operation of current racial preference systems, Jacobson's dismissal as "spurious" the complaints of discrimination by today's "Euro-Americans" (pp. 7, 278-280). He also leaves unanalyzed the political logic behind the Census Bureau's classifications of many new immigrants (Israelis of North African origin, for example, are shoehorned into the category "non-Hispanic white") and its refusal to adopt a new "mixed race" category for Americans of multiple heritages.27 Despite these criticisms, Jacobson's core thesis that races, far from in The Quiet Voices: Southern Rabbis and Black Civil Rights, 1880s to 1990s, ed.

For David A.

Eli Faber's Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade is the latest, least polemical, and arguably most important contribution to the veritable cottage industry of essays and books refuting this charge.29 An indefatigable researcher into the history of Anglo-American Jewry, Faber deploys his mastery of archival materials on both sides of the Atlantic to reinforce the conclusion, already reached by Jacob Rader Marcus over a quarter of a century ago, that the Jewish role in the trade was minimal. He breaks new ground by showing not only that British and American Jews were marginal players in the Atlantic slave trade, but that this odious traffic did not contribute significantly to the economic development of either Old World or New World Jewry. Faber's focus is on Great Britain's transatlantic commerce during its preeminent period as a slave-trading power. Between the late seventeenth and early nineteenth centuries, nearly half of the almost seven million slaves transported from Africa to the Americas were carried on British ships (pp. 9, 259). Faber uses Spanish and Portuguese surnames on British merchant lists to identify Sephardim. He cross-checks less distinctive patronymics against synagogue rolls, naturalization lists, testamentary records, tombstones, and genealogical studies to confirm the Jewish identity of other, often Ashkenazic he calls "the enthno-racial Pentagon," see Postethnic America: Beyond Multiculturalism (New York: Basic Books, 1995), pp. 19-50. 28.

His comprehensive samples for both the home country and its colonies reveal the role of Jews as investors in slave-trading companies, owners of slave ships, slave-retailing factors, and employers of slave labor. From Bristol to Barbados and Nevis to Newport, the general picture that emerges amidst regional variations is of very limited Jewish participation. Jewish merchants in Great Britain were extensively involved in inter- national trade in textiles, gold, silver, and diamonds, but not slaves. None invested in the Royal African Company until 1691, two decades after it was chartered. Subsequently, they preferred investing in the Bank of England and the East India Company (pp. 23-24). Jews do not seem to have been among the primary owners of, or even consistent minor investors in, the slave fleets of London, Bristol, and Liverpool (pp. 41-42). Overall, Jewish involvement in Britain's eighteenth-century slave trade was "minute in the extreme" (p. 144). In the Western Hemisphere, individual Jewish firms, such as Lindo, Aguilar &amp; Dias in Jamaica, emerged as important slave retailers during the 1780s, but they were the exceptions to the rule (pp. 39, 116). Between 1742 and 1769, of 149,705 African slaves imported into Jamaica, only 665-four-tenths of one percent-were carried on ships owned by Jews (p. 74). The Jewish role in the reexport trade of so-called refuse Negroes-ill or infirm slaves who were rehabilitated for resale on the Spanish Main-accounted for about six percent of such slaves sales during most of the eighteenth century (pp. 80-82). Yet it was enough to foster an enduring image of Jews as the "used car dealers" of the slave trade. In terms of slave ownership, the Jewish share on Britain's Caribbean islands varied between one and two percent (pp. 123-125). In the plantation economy, which employed over nine-tenths of the slaves, Jewish masters were almost unknown, though Jewish traders were accused of corrupting field hands by trafficking with them in stolen goods (pp. 62-63). In the cities, Jews were as likely or even more likely to own slaves as non-Jews, but Jewish owners typically owned fewer slaves than their non-Jewish counterparts. Jewish masters were also credited with giving their slaves Saturdays off in addition to Sundays (pp. 111-112, 123-124). In the mainland colonies that matured into the United States, Newport, Rhode Island, was the preeminent slaving entrepot, but ranked a distant fourth behind London, Liverpool, and Bristol, which sent in excess of 10,000 slave-trading voyages to Africa during the eighteenth century. Jewish merchants, notably Aaron Lopez and his father-in-law, Jacob Rodrigues Rivera, were responsible for thirty-four of Newport's over 900 slave trading</page><page sequence="12">336 HAROLD BRACKMAN voyages-under four percent-between 1709 and 1807 (pp. 136-137). Slave trading has left an indelible imprint on Lopez's reputation, but it should be borne mind that only ten percent of his seaborne ventures involved slaves (p. 138). Faber does not address the question of motivation. Given their proficiency in Spanish and Portuguese, and network connections with the New Christians of Latin America, why did the Jewish merchants of the British Empire and budding United States fail to carve out a larger niche for themselves in the Atlantic slave trade? Were they inhibited solely by economic calculations of risk vs. reward? Or did ethical scruples also play a role? Despite such unanswered questions, Faber's book is a definitive refutation of a dangerous historical libel.
