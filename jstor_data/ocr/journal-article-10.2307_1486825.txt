Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1992. xxxi, 199 pp. This volume, despite its relative slimness, is a comprehensive and balanced treatment of the ancient Near Eastern vow. It begins with exacting definitions of the terminology and a critical distinction between vows and oaths (pp.</page><page sequence="2">392 BOOK REVIEWS 11-35), followed by a thorough survey of past literature (pp. 36-72) and a detailed analysis of the vows extant in ancient Near Eastern (pp. 73-136) and biblical literature (pp. 177-199). Tony Cartledge succeeds in demonstrating that every ancient Near Eastern culture practiced vow-making; that vows were, with rare exceptions, made to a god and fulfilled at a sanctuary; that vow-fulfillment was a public matter; that prompt payment of a vow was essential; that vows were motivated by personal or (occasionally) national distress; and-for this reviewer his most important contribution-that vows were always conditional: if the deity did not fulfill the request, the maker of the vow was not obligated to fulfill the vow. A more nuanced distinction between oaths and vows would have been gained by referring to Loewenstamm's discussion in the Encyclopaedia Biblica.' Cartledge's conclusion that Num. 21:1-3 is a "crucial transition piece" would have been enhanced by examining the structure of Numbers 20-21.2 Also, the error of labeling Lev. 27:9-13 a consecration rather than a vow would have been avoided by simply observing that this section opens with the particle 'im, signifying that it forms a subunit of the preceding section (vv. 1-8), which explicitly deals with vows. The following section (vv. 14-25), dealing with consecrations, opens with the particle ki, signifying the beginning of a new unit. Cartledge's strength lies in literary analysis. A parade example is his close reading of Gen. 28:10-12, which allows him to build a strong case for declaring Jacob's vow to be "manipulative, manifold, and self-centered" (p. 171). His work is a substantive contribution to a long-neglected feature of the private individual's mode of worship in the ancient Near East.
