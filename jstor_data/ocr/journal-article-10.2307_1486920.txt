<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael Galchinsky, The Origin of the Modern Jewish Woman Writer: Romance and Reform in Victorian England. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1996. 275 pp. Michael Galchinsky introduces a group of writers who remain almost entirely unknown to English literary studies despite recent critical efforts to recover forgotten voices from the margins of literary culture. These writers are doubly marginalized, as women and as Jews. They published between 1830 and 1880, the period in which for the first time women in large numbers rose to prominence in English literature, many entered the sphere of high culture, and a few eventually attained canonical status; a period, too, during which English Judaism was beginning the process of internal reform and Jews won relief from civic disabilities and acquired a new standing in English society. But these changes were for the most part still tentative and contested. Celia Moss, her sister Marion Moss Hartog, and Grace Aguilar, the main figures in this study, were anomalous in the Jewish context as well as in the English one; they published fiction before Jewish men did, and preceded Jewish women on the continent and in America in publishing at all. Much of their writing was directed to Jews on behalf of women, supporting women's education and the religious reform movement that would, they hoped, improve the position of women in Judaism. To the English they spoke on behalf of Jews, endeavoring to counter popular stereotypes and present Jews and Judaism in a favorable light to the Christian world. They began writing fiction, Galchinsky persuasively argues, in response to an English romance tradition in which a Jewish heroine rebels against her materialistic father and finds happiness in a spiritually exalting marriage with a Christian. In such stories Jewish women (in what we have come to recognize as a typical orientalist formulation) are oppressed, inadequately educated, and ready for conversion. This tradition created a discursive space in which Jewish women could write about Jewish heroines for both Jewish and non-Jewish audiences, with a ready-made set of narrative conventions they</page><page sequence="2">278 BOOK REVIEWS could simultaneously use and oppose. Their romances reconceive the father- daughter plot and affirm the spiritual values of Judaism. The first chapter of Galchinsky's book traces nineteenth-century conversionist romances from their roots in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice and Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe. The second chapter deals with Jewish men, who also wrote about father-daughter conflict, although mostly in midrashim rather than prose fiction, and who upheld paternal authority and the subordination of women. Here Galchinsky tells the sad story of Marion Moss Hartog's Jewish Sabbath Journal, the first Jewish women's periodical, which appeared briefly in 1855 only to be crushed out of existence by the hostile editor of the Jewish Chronicle. Hartog, who tried to resist conventional Jewish and Victorian ideals of femininity, is the heroine of this book; Grace Aguilar, "who did not resist but spoke the contradictions of her culture" (p. 171), and whose works remained popular with wide and varied audiences from the mid-nineteenth century into the early twentieth century, is its exemplary figure. The book is organized around a set of oppositions: not only Christian/Jewish and male/female, but also Sephardic/Ashkenazic, upper class/middle class, traditionalist/reformist, and (in line with current work in Victorian studies) feminist/nonfeminist. As is natural when introducing hitherto-overlooked writers, the author is somewhat inclined to overrate both their literary merit and the degree to which their attitudes correspond to those in favor today, although he is generally careful to moderate his claims. The literary merits of the works discussed remain dubious. By 1830 the romance form had been pretty much drained of literary vitality, and Grace Aguilar's defensive, ideology-ridden domestic narratives lack the sharpness of observation, the distinction of style, and the edgy ambivalence with which Amy Levy (whose works fall just too late for the time-frame of this book) at her best depicted contemporary Jewish and English life. Whatever feminist impulses may have impelled them, moreover, these women rebelled overtly against male authority only rarely (and not, as Marion Moss Hartog learned to her sorrow, with impunity); they are accurately described as "transitional foremothers who came to prominence by decking themselves submissively in the mother's mantle, but who nevertheless managed to create a woman-centered vision of Jewish history and Jewish practice" (p. 192). Other women get less attention than the fiction writers, although the brief descriptions offered make them seem at least as interesting. Upper-class women directed their literary efforts to the edification and improvement of the Jewish poor, while Anna Maria Goldsmid, coming from a rich and</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 279 powerful family (her brother was a member of Parliament), wrote sermons and translations. Almost all the women writers were interested in improving women's education, and translation acquired a unique importance when women were barred from linguistic access to the basic texts of Jewish culture; one might compare the situation of Englishwomen who yearned for the cultural authority conferred by knowledge of Latin and Greek. Like their female English contemporaries, Jewish women professed their dedication to domesticity and the private sphere even as they entered the public sphere through their writings, and disclaimed any interest in fame while busily working to acquire it. This typical Victorian contradiction is heightened, however, for Jewish women who want Jews to assimilate publicly and practice Judaism behind closed doors at home, and even more for those who open an idealized Jewish family life for Christian inspection. The Sephardic Aguilar, Galchinsky argues, takes impetus both from the matriarchal storytellers who kept Judaism alive in ostensibly converted homes, and from the tradition of concealment itself. Introducing a new set of writers with their distinctive inflection of Victorian women's literary situation-the only comparable study, Linda Gertner Zatlin's The Nineteenth- Century Anglo-Jewish Novel (1981), has a different emphasis altogether-this book makes an original and important contribution both to Victorian studies and to Jewish studies.
