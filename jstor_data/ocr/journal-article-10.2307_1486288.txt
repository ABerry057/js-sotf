Albany: State University of New York Press, 1988. 178 pp. In the last year the writings of Moshe Idel, the eminent Israeli scholar of Jewish mysticism, have at least been made available, and on a grand scale, to readers of English. In the present review I shall discuss two of these volumes. The first, The Mystical Experience in Abraham Abulafia, represents a partial translation of the author's doctoral dissertation, "Kitve R. 'Avra- ham 'Abul'afiyah u-Mishnato" (Hebrew University, 1976). Some of the remaining chapters from the dissertation have been published in the same series under the title Language, Torah, and Hermeneutics (1988). In both cases, however, Idel has slightly revised the material, especially updating the notes with references to studies that have been publishled since the writing of the dissertation. The author is to be commended for undertaking the difficult task, begun as a graduate student, of sifting through the corpus of Abulafian texts, mostly buried in the manuscript collections of various university libraries. The sheer work of reading through this material, let alone organizing it in a thematic way, was no easy matter, and Idel has proven to be a master at both. Through his published work, including this book and many other studies, Idel has made available to scholars in the field of Jewish mysticism as well as to nonspecialists a body of sources that would not have been avail- able otherwise. He has also managed to discuss the material in several thematic categories that are of especial interest to the historian of the reli- gious experience. Perhaps more than any other scholar of Jewish mysticism before him. Idel has paid a great deal of attention to the experiential dimen- sion of kabbalistic texts. As the very title of the first book indicates, deter- mining in a precise way the phenomenological parameters of the mystical experience in Abulafia's writings provides the link connecting the essays translated in this volume. Although Abulafia's works were not totally unknown to earlier scholars (e.g., in the nineteenth century Adolf Jellinek published some of the relevant texts), it was Gershom Scholem who first understood the seminal impor- tance of this kabbalist in the larger history of Jewish mysticism. Thus Scholem dedicated a whole chapter of his Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (first published in 1954) to a description of Abulafia's system of thought and mystical techniques of letter-combination and recitation of divine names.</page><page sequence="2">82 BOOK REVIEWS Scholem noted that in the Spanish Kabbalah of the last quarter of the thir- teenth century there were two opposing schools, which he termed the "ecsta- tic" and the "theosophical." While Moses de Leon, assumed by Scholem to be the author of the Zohar, is a representative example of the latter, Abula- fia is representative of the former. Idel's own study of Abulafia's mysticism, which he likewise terms "ecstatic" Kabbalah (Abulafia himself refers to his mystical system as the "prophetic" Kabbalah, for it is meant to induce a state of mystical union understood by Abulafia to be a state of prophetic rapture), is part of his larger programmatic study of Jewish mystical texts in terms of two major trends in Kabbalah: the theosophical-theurgical and the ecstatic. This schematization is most fully elaborated in Idel's Kabbalah: New Perspectives (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988), but it is already operative in his early works. Broadly speaking, whereas the theosophical- theurgical Kabbalah is most interested in a theosophical conception of God based on ten emanations (sefirot) and the possibility of human action (or misaction) to affect that structure, ecstatic Kabbalah is most interested in the experience of unio mystica, achieved primarily through various medita- tive techniques. Idel's phenomenology of the two trends in Kabbalah is clearly based on the research of Scholem as well as other scholars, including, most prominently, Ephraim Gottlieb, but it is to Idel's credit that he tries to contextualize these types within a larger framework of Jewish sources, see- ing them not merely as schools that erupted in the thirteenth century in Spain but trends which have a long history in the Jewish literary tradition. The two basic forms of Jewish mysticism-mystical union and theurgy-can be traced to developments in early rabbinic Judaism, the former to the world of merkavah mysticism and the latter to the world of midrashic thinking. In The Mystical Experience in Abraham Abulafia Idel gives a highly detailed and well-documented account of the leading exponent of ecstatic Kabbalah. Idel focuses on the different techniques developed by Abulafia and some of his disciples to attain a state of ecstasy resulting in the experi- ence of mystical union between self and God. The chief techniques, as I noted above, are letter-combination (in three stages: written, oral, and mental) and recitation of the divine names, which itself involves special breathing exercises as well as bodily motions (see The Mystical Experience, pp. 13-54). These techniques are intended to help the individual to free his true self, i.e., the intellectual or rational soul, from the bonds or knots of the body so that he may ultimately achieve a state of cleaving to God, devequt.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 83 This cleaving is understood by Abulafia in terms of strictly philosophical categories, i.e., as the union of the human intellect with the Active Intellect. Thus, in one place in his 'Or ha-Sekhel Abulafia puts the matter as follows: "The connection of human existence with the divine existence during intel- lection-which is identical with the intellect in [its] existence-until he and He become one [entity]" (I have utilized with slight modification the trans- lation in Studies in Ecstatic Kabbalah, p. 67; for a less desirable translation, see The Mystical Experience, p. 129). The union of the human intellect with the Active Intellect is so complete that the difference in identity between human and divine breaks down. Hence the individual in the ecstatic- prophetic state can utter: "He is I and I am He" (ibid., p. 127). Although the basic outline of Abulafia's system has been known for some time from Scholem's account, Idel goes way beyond Scholem in describing the com- plex and intricate strands of ecstatic Kabbalah. Special mention should also be made of the fact that Idel attempts to locate the Abulafian technique of the recitation of divine names as an ecstatic-mystical exercise in the history of Jewish mysticism, beginning with merkavah texts of late antiquity and culminating in some of the esoteric writings of the German Pietists. More- over, there are some striking parallels between Abulafia's system of letter- combination and Eleazar of Worms, whose works Abulafia admits having studied (see The Mystical Experience, pp. 14-24). In short, then, Idel's pre- sentation of Abulafian Kabbalah is the most comprehensive one to date, in terms of both historical context and phenomenological description. The second volume, Studies in Ecstatic Kabbalah, is a collection of several of Idel's studies on the Abulafian trend in Kabbalah written in the decade or so after he completed his doctorate. The topics dealt with in this series of articles relate either directly to Abulafia or to the development of ecstatic Kabbalah until the middle of the sixteenth century. Here too one finds a significant advance beyond Scholem's discussion of Abulafia. Although Scholem already remarked that Abulafian Kabbalah led an under- ground life in the history of Jewish mysticism (see Major Trends, pp. 124-125), and he further mentioned that the sixteenty-century Safedian kabbalists, Moses Cordovero and Hayyim Vital, quote Abulafia as an authoritative source (ibid., p. 378, n. 14), Idel has set out to demonstrate in a more thorough way that Abulafian techniques to attain ecstatic union were indeed highly influential in the subsequent history of Kabbalah (see esp. Studies, pp. 103-169). In particular, Idel convincingly shows that in the last decade of the thirteenth century a circle of Abulafian Kabbalah was estab-</page><page sequence="4">84 BOOK REVIEWS lished in northern Palestine (see ibid., pp. 91-101). From this circle, which combined Abulafian mysticism with Sufic ideas, derived the Liqqute ha- RaN, i.e., the teachings of R. Nathan, and the anonymous Sha'are Zedeq (see ibid., pp. 73-89). It is likely, moreover, as Idel argues, that the kab- balists Isaac of Acre and Shem Tov ibn Gaon were influenced by this circle and thus assimilated ecstatic Kabbalah within their respective theosophic orientations. The geographical location of the Abulafian circle in Palestine continued to have an influence up until the sixteenth century, when it again appears explicitly in Safed in the writings of Solomon Alkabez, Moses Cordovero, Elijah de Vidas, and Hayyim Vital, and in Jerusalem in the writ- ings of Judah Albotini and Joseph ibn Zaiah (see pp. 95-96). Most interest- ingly, Idel has pointed out that according to Cordovero, often considered to be the theosophist par excellence, there is a decided gradation of Kabbalah: (1) the lower level consists of the theosophic Kabbalah, i.e., speculation on the sefirot, derived mostly from the zoharic literature, and (2) the higher level comprises the ecstatic-prophetic Kabbalah of Abulafia (see pp. 126-131, 136-140). As Idel further suggests, the Cordoverian gradation had a decisive influence on subsequent Hasidic texts, a position developed at greater length in some other studies by Idel. Hence, Idel has succeeded in illustrating the distinct ways that Abulafian Kabbalah, though removed from its native Spanish soil, continued to play a central role in the shaping of Jewish mysticism. In sum, these two books of Idel's have contributed significantly to our understanding of one of the more difficult chapters in the history of Jewish mysticism. While Scholem is certainly to be given credit for recognizing the importance of Abraham Abulafia's particular brand of ecstatic Kabbalah distinct from that of mainstream theosophy, Idel has given us a fuller pres- entation of this system. In addition, Idel has suggested some earlier roots for ecstatic Kabbalah in merkavah mysticism and German Pietism. He has also carefully charted out the evolution of these ideas in subsequent stages, especially in mystical circles that were active in Palestine. The influence of Abulafia reached a climax in sixteenth-century Safed and from there, large- ly due to the writings of Cordovero and Vital, helped inform the mystical orientation of the Hasidim in the eighteenth century.
