Leiden: Brill, 2005. x, 155 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000657 My initial interest in Ann Brener's book, Judah Halevi and His Circle of Hebrew Poets in Granada, derives from my own research in and teaching of the English poet John Donne. Writing his poetry during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, Donne has traditionally been considered a "metaphys ical" poet?one who emphasizes the use of complex metaphors (or conceits), paradox, and wit. Taken together, these characteristics mark out a common poetic tradition shared by the poets of the English Renaissance and the Hebrew poets of the medieval Renaissance (late eleventh to twelfth centuries).1 Yet on reading Brener's book, I discovered a second, significant aspect of Halevi's poetic practice that is shared by Donne. This is her pivotal thesis regarding Judah Halevi's participation in what she so vividly brings to life as "a unique circle of Hebrew poets loosely centered around the [Muslim-Spanish] city kingdom of Granada" toward the end of the eleventh century (ix). Much as has been argued about Donne, therefore, Brener effectively demonstrates that Halevi was part of what can be termed "coterie poetry," which in both periods was written specifically for a close-knit group of young men for whom writing verse was an important part of their scholarly and cultural accomplishments, in addition to designing the "occasional," which was composed to mark a myriad of personal and literary situations (62-64).2 1.

Marotti, John Donne, Coterie Poet 382</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews The interwoven interests, goals, and camaraderie sustained by the Granada coterie group are the focus of Brener's cogent study of poetic tradition and community. In the first part of the volume, titled "On the Road to Granada," Brener spends four chapters tracing Halevi's introduction to?and acceptance into?the Granada coterie through an innovative delineation of groups of poems: first, Moses ibn Ezra's Bein ha-hadasim (Amongst the Myrtles), Halevi's Tmdu (amodu (Stay, O Stay), and Ibn Ezra's Yaldei yamim (The Children of Time); second, (perhaps) Ibn Ezra's Leyl mahshavot lev a 'irah (Nightly I Rouse the Musings of My Heart) with Halevi's rhymed letter and Ahar galot sod (After Revealing the Secret); third, a lost poem by Judah ibn Ghayyat that includes the words Ein 'al-'ofarim peli (Gazelles Can't Be Held Guilty), Halevi's Ma-li leravot (Why Should I Soak the Land?), and Ibn Ghayyat's Mi-bein (ofaim (Amongst the Branches); and finally, Ibn Ezra's panegyric to Halevi, titled Siftei nitzanim (The Lips of Flowers). Brener very convincingly recreates the coterie of Halevi's circle by juxtaposing these particular poems as literary and coll?gial responses among its members, basing her discussion on carefully reasoned arguments and on meticulous and sensitive intertextual readings. The second part of this volume, titled "A Circle of Poets," moves into a discussion of poetic genres and motifs within the Granada coterie and develops Brener's central argument about "the dynamics of composition governing our Hebrew circle of poets" (125). Each of the four chapters in this part focuses on a different genre or motif: Halevi's poems of "wine-drinking parties" (e.g., invitation, love, riddle); the "dialogue of poetry" (93) among Solomon ibn al Mu'allim, Moses ibn Ezra, and Judah Halevi in the form of interrelated panegy rics; poems "anchored in the traditional Jewish calendar" (111), such as a Purim poem by Halevi and a wedding poem by Ibn Ezra; and poems by Ibn Ezra and Halevi in which the city of Granada is "a very specific presence" (129). Each chapter adds weight to Brener's thesis about Halevi's participation in the Granada coterie, culminating in her astute summary of the three different models of composition that relate the various poems to each other. Thus, she delineates the following: the etiquette of "a panegyric and a panegyric-in reply" (125); the "spirit of contest and challenge" in which one poet responded in kind to "a difficult model-poem specifically held up as a challenge" (125); and an "impromptu composition or improvisation" (126), in which several poets jointly composed a poem. This latter part of the book sketches out a wider cultural and poetic tradition for understanding the particular phenomena of the Granada coterie, as Brener deftly moves back and forth among all the poetic texts discussed in her volume. Brener's study of the poetry of the Granada coterie is in essence very much a part of contemporary studies in the history of the book, as it examines various (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1986); and Ted-Larry Pebworth, "John Donne, Coterie Poetry, and the Text as Performance," Studies in English Literature, 1500?1900, 29 (1989): 61?75. 383</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews manuscripts and editions to produce a scholarly and lively study of poetic tradition and community. In the end, I should especially mention Brener's finely wrought translations into English of poetry by Judah Halevi and the Granada coterie. Several previous translations of Halevi's poetry have appeared in the past? particularly Nina Salaman's Selected Poems of Jehudah Halevi and Franz Rosenzweig's Ninety-Two Poems and Hymns of Yehuda Halevi.3' Brener's trans lations not only considerably enlarge this corpus but also are accompanied by extensive notes and interpretive discussions. She thus brings the varicolored world of the Granada coterie to an English-speaking audience, opening up inter esting vistas for further thought and research.
