New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. 370 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S036400940700027X This book speaks with two distinct voices: the historical/analytical and the normative/polemical. The bulk of the book is written in the historical/analytical voice. Leonard B. Glick, professor emeritus of anthropology at Hampshire College and author of Abrahams Heirs: Jews and Christians in Medieval Europe (1999), competently surveys the history of Jewish circumcision from the Bible to modern America. The author writes well and gives evidence of a keen intelligence at every turn, even if he presents virtually no new scholarly argu ments. The author relies heavily on secondary sources in English, but to his credit, he has done his homework thoroughly?the book is outfitted with a very full bibliography?and has chosen his sources well. For example, for rabbinic material, he relies on Lawrence Hoffman (mistakes and all) and Howard Eilberg Schwartz; for Christian perceptions of circumcision in the sixteenth and seven teenth centuries, he relies on James Shapiro; for the nineteenth-century Jewish cir cumcision controversies, he depends on Jacob Katz, and so on. The author correctly notes that until the nineteenth century, Jews stoutly defended circumcision, attributing to it all sorts of positive physical and metaphys ical effects; the only opponents of circumcision were Christian. In the course of the nineteenth century, however, a striking paradox developed: Many Jewish thinkers, especially in Germany, began to oppose circumcision because they saw in it a barrier to the full acculturation of Jews in German society. By the end of the nine teenth century, some physicians, most of them Christian and most of them in the United States, had begun to see in circumcision a panacea for a host of medical ills, and circumcision, now defined as a medical procedure, began its ascent into acceptability in general society. By the end of the twentieth century, many Americans, including most American Jews, were content to have their infant sons circumcised in the hospital by a physician. The medical literature is filled with endless debates about the alleged medical benefits of circumcision?Glick argues that no one has yet demonstrated that circumcision provides any statisti cally significant medical benefit?and a small but increasingly vocal group is arguing that routine neonatal circumcision is a form of child abuse that must be prohibited by law. Glick tells this story well. When Glick is speaking in his historical/analytical voice, the reader seldom realizes that the author is a firm opponent of circumcision who has associated himself with the leaders of the anticircumcision movement in this country. This book is dedicated to Marilyn Fayre Milos, the well known anticircumcision crusader. The author does not conceal his position; on the contrary, he flaunts it, especially in the prologue and epilogue, which are 167</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews written in the normative/polemical voice. The last paragraph of the texts reads as follows: I've tried to summarize in these few pages the wealth of information that con vinced me that male infant circumcision is medically unnecessary, harmful to normal sexuality, and ethically unjustifiable. When all is said and done, I believe we face a single inescapable question: Are we now prepared to accept the principle that, from the moment of birth, every child has all the human rights of any other person?including the inviolable right to freedom from nonconsensual, nontherapeutic bodily alteration? (281) By the epilogue, the Bible, Judaism, and Christianity?the subjects of the first three quarters or so of the book?have retreated into irrelevance because, for the author, the circumcision question is ultimately not about religion but about human rights. Perhaps this is a powerful argument against circumcision, perhaps it isn't. Ethicists debate (often in connection with the practice of female excision) whether the claim of "universal rights" is the product of a legitimate concern for the welfare of all humans or whether it is a new form of Western cul tural imperialism in which enlightened (usually pale-skinned) Westerners invoke notions of "universal human rights" to instruct unenlightened (usually dark skinned) primitives on what they may and may not do. Here Glick invokes the idea of "human rights" to oppose infant circumcision, both Jewish and otherwise, but a full discussion of this argument would have meant a different book. (One assumes that Glick would advance the same argument against Islamic circumci sion, but Islam is missing from this book.) In sum, the book is a useful summary of contemporary scholarship on the history of Jewish circumcision and a thorough study of the phenomenon of cir cumcision in contemporary American society. It is also a good point of entry into the polemics that surround the practice of circumcision. Shaye J. D. Cohen Harvard University Cambridge, Massachusetts</page></plain_text>
