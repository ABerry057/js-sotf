The practice of fasting on this day is puzzling for a number of reasons. Although the Bible describes fasting in the year of the Purim threat, this fast occurred in Nissan and the weeks thereafter. Nor does tannaitic or amoraic literature mention the practice of fasting on the 13 th of Adar. To add to the puzzle, Megillat ta'anit, compiled in the first century ce, includes the 13th of Adar as a day on which Jews were prohibited from fasting. It is true that the practice of fasting on the 13th of Adar is referred to in the She'iltot of R. Ahai Gaon, an early geonic work. But recent scholarship suggests that the relevant she 'Uta (discourse) made its way into this work some one or two centuries after the work left the hands of R. Ahai in the eighth century.1 The ear- liest reference to fasting on the 13th of Adar occurs, instead, in a geonic respon- sum included in Midrash Tanhuma. This responsum has not been closely analyzed until now. It is there that we find the clues to the origin of this fast. I. Fasting in the Year of the Purim Threat The book of Esther records that the decree to destroy the Jews was issued on the 13th of Nissan (Esther 3:12). It then mentions fasting in two contexts. In verse 4:3, it is told that Jews expressed great mourning wherever they received news of the decree, reacting with fasting, crying, and wailing. Since it would have taken weeks for the decree to be spread throughout the Persian Empire, the implication * I would like to thank Rabbi Nosson Dovid Rabinowich whose article, "7îz 'anit Esther" in his Binu shenot dor va-dor (Jerusalem: Feldheim, 1985) first interested me in this topic. I would like to thank Prof. Robert Brody, Prof. Daniel R. Schwartz, Dr. Roni Shweka, Rabbi Moshe Yasgur, Rabbi Mordy Friedman, Rabbi Ezra Frazer, Sam Borodach, Yitzchok Stern, Allen Friedman, and my sons Shaya and Daniel First for their thoughts and assistance. The views expressed in this study are solely my own. This study would not have been possible without Prof. Brody's works, including Le-toledot nusah ha-she'iltot (New York and Jerusalem: Ha-akademyah le-mada'ey ha-yahadut, 1991), Teshuvot Rav Natronai bar Hilai Ga'on (Jerusalem: Mekhon Ofek, 1994), and The Geonim of Babylonia and the Shaping of Medieval Jewish Culture (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1998). 1 . See below, Part IV. 309</page><page sequence="2">Mitchell First is that fasting in the Jewish communities started in the middle of Nissan and was ongoing for weeks. In verses 4:16-17, we are told that Esther requested that Mor- decai instruct the Jews of Shushan to fast for three consecutive days,2 and that Mordecai complied with her request. Much later, at 9:30-3 1, we learn that letters were sent to Jews in all the pro- vinces, instructing them to keep the holiday of Purim in future years, as Mordecai and Esther had commanded them, "and as they had accepted upon themselves and zar 'am the matters of the fasts and their outcry."3 If zar 'am here takes on its usual meaning of "descendants," this phrase could suggest that Jews of all the provinces had already taken upon themselves and their descendants the duty to commemor- ate the fasts described at 4:3, or the three consecutive days of fasting observed by Esther and the Jews of Shushan.4 The phrase could alternatively refer to the Jews' practice of fasting in connection with remembering the destruction of the First Temple.5 2. The earliest rabbinic tradition is that these fasts were observed on the 13th, 14th, and 15th. This is explicit in Esther rabbah (8:7) and Pirkey de-Rabbi Eliezer (chap. 50), and implicit in the earlier source, Seder olam. Seder olam (chap. 29) records that Haman was hanged on the 16th. This implies that the first of Esther's two meetings with the king was on the 1 5th and that Esther began her fasting on the 13th. (Some manuscripts of Seder olam include an explicit statement that Esther's first meeting with the king was on the 15th.) Also, Rav (B. Megillah 15a) comments on va-ya'avor Mordekhai (Esther 4:17): she-he 'ivir y om ris hon shel pesah be-ta'anit (he transgressed the first day of Passover with a fast). Since this statement does not mention the second day of Passover, it seems to view the fasts as having been observed on the 13th, 14th, and 15th. Later rabbinic sources record a tradition that the fasts were observed on the 14th, 15th, and 16th. See, e.g., Midrash panim aherim, version 2, chap. 4, and Yalkut shim 'oni, para. 1056. This view is followed by Rashi. See his commentaries to Esther 4:17, and B. Megillah 15a and 16a. See also the statement by R. Sheshet at B. Megillah 16a. B. Yevamot 121b seems to view the fasts as having spanned three full days (days and nights). Compare Midrash tehillim 22:5. 3. Diipyn rraisn nm ny-ir *?yi d^d: *?y i»v ymoi. 4. The three consecutive days of fasting observed by Esther and the Jews of Shushan did influ- ence some over the centuries. For example, Sefer minhag tov (thirteenth-century Italy, author unknown) recommended fasting three days before Purim. The author wrote that ideally one should fast the three days consecutively. See Meir Zevi Weiss, "Sefer minhag tov" Ha-zofeh 13 (1929): 236. Also, a custom to fast three days in commemoration of the fasts initiated by Esther was found among Marrano women. The tradition was to fast the three days one month before Passover. See, e.g., Elliott Horowitz, Reckless Rites (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2006), 52-56. R. Abraham Ibn Ezra, commentary to Esther 9:30, implies that the Karaites interpreted verse 9:31 to indicate an acceptance by the Jews of a fast of three days on future generations. But I have not found such a view in any Karaite source. Anan, the eighth-century founder of the sect, believed that the Jews fasted seventy days in the year of the threat, from the 13th of Nissan until the 23rd of Sivan. He also believed that verse 9:31 indicated that this period of seventy days, of fasting, and fasting on both days of Purim, were accepted by the Jews as an annual obligation. See Avraham Harkavy, ed., Zikhron la-rishonim: mahberet sheminit ... likkutey kadmoniyyot le-korot dat beney mikra ve-sifrutam (St. Petersburg, 1903), 40, 130, 133, 149, 157, and 164. 5. This is how R. Abraham Ibn Ezra interprets the phrase. See his commentaries on Esther 9:30 and Zechariah 8:18. But in this interpretation, the verse is suddenly switching contexts and referring to fasts not mentioned elsewhere in the book. The other problem with this interpretation is that the phrase refers to fasts associated with za 'akah (outcry). This fits the fasts of Esther 4:3 and 4: 16-1 7. But it does 310</page><page sequence="3">The Origin of Ta'anit Esther The most likely interpretation, however, is that here zar 'am means "chil- dren,"6 and that the phrase refers to the fasts observed in the year of the threat. The reference could be to the fasts observed by the Jews throughout the provinces, or to the three days of fasting observed by the Jews of Shushan, or to both.7 The significance of the instruction at 9:30-3 1 is that just as the Jews and their children were ready to fast in the days of their distress, so should they be willing to rejoice on the anniversary of their deliverance. No verses in Megillat Esther refer to fasting on the 13 th of Adar.8 II. The 13th of Adar in I and II Maccabees and Megillat Ta 'anit Both I Maccabees and II Maccabees record details about the defeat of the Syrian military commander Nicanor by Judah and his men, in a battle fought on the 13th of Adar. This battle took place in 161 BCE,a few years after the rededica- tion of the Temple in 164. I Maccabees records: [T]he victors cut off the head of Nicanor and his right hand, which he had so presumptuously raised in oath, and brought and raised them where they could be viewed in Jerusalem. The people were overjoyed and observed the day as a not easily fit the fasts established in connection with the destruction of the First Temple, which were fasts established for mourning. 6. Admittedly, zar 'am usually means descendants. Indeed, just a few verses earlier, in verses 27 and 28, it does take on this meaning. But one can respond that, having used the word zar 'am in verses 27 and 28, the author chose to use the word again in verse 3 1 , even though it was now not being used in its usual sense. Ve-za 'akatam (and their outcry) supports the interpretation that zar 'am means children here. Za 'akah does not sound like something accepted by future generations. 7. The fact that the letters were sent to the Jews of all the provinces suggests that the reference is to the fasts of 4:3. But the plural ha-zomot perhaps suggests that the reference is to the fast of three days, and ve-ka 'asher kiyyemu implies that the reference is to fasts that were observed pursuant to an instruc- tion, which also suggests these fasts. 8. Nevertheless, there are rabbinic sources that interpret verse 9:31 to imply the Jews' accep- tance of an obligation to fast annually on the 1 3th of Adar. R. Abraham Ibn Ezra tells us that many in his time interpreted verse 9:3 1 as referring to Ta 'anit Esther. Later sources that adopt this interpret- ation include (1) R. Abraham b. David of Posquieres, cited by the Ritba, in his commentary to Ta'anit 10a, and by the Ran in his commentary to Rif, Ta'anit 7a (in the pages of Rif); (2) Kol Bo, sec. 62 (but compare sec. 45); and (3) Meiri, Magen 'avot, treatise 23 (but compare his commentary to Megillah 2a). See also R. Isaac b. Abba Man, Sefer ha-ittur, 220. It can be argued that R. Se'adyah adopts this interpretation as well. See below, n. 84. Presumably this interpretation understands the verse to be teaching that the Jews accepted the zomot of Nissan by agreeing to adopt a yearly zom on the 13th of Adar. This day might naturally have been chosen as the day to observe an annual fast because it was the day on which the massacre of the Jews had originally been scheduled to take place. Also, it was the day the actual fighting took place. But this is all speculation, as there is nothing in verse 9:3 1 to connect it to the 13th of Adar. Moreover, there is nothing in I Maccabees or II Maccabees to suggest that the holiday declared in 161 bce was declared on a day that had previously been designated a day of fasting. The Talmud mentions verse 9:3 1 briefly at B. Megillah 16b. But the passage does not seem to have any bearing on our issue. 311</page><page sequence="4">Mitchell First day of great rejoicing. They decreed that the day, the thirteenth of Adar, should be observed annually.9 And the following is the relevant text in II Maccabees: [Judah] had the severed head of Nicanor hung from the Akra .... By a unan- imous vote of the people they decreed that they would by no means let that day pass unmarked, but that they would keep as a special day the thirteenth of the twelfth month, called Adar in Aramaic, the day before the Day of Mordechai.10 Josephus, too, notes that this day was observed as a holiday in his own time: Now the victory took place on the thirteenth of the month which is called Adar by the Jews .... And the Jews celebrate their victory every year in this month, and observe this day as a festival.11 Although these sources record the 13th of Adar as a festive day, they do not record a prohibition of fasting on this day.12 To find that prohibition, we have to look to Megillat ta'anit,13 a list of approximately thirty-six Jewish holidays, mostly from Hasmonean and Roman times. Fasting was prohibited on these holidays; on the more important ones, eulogizing was forbidden as well. Megillat ta'anit includes the 13th of Adar as one of the days on which eulogizing was prohibited.14 The day is referred to as Yom Nikanor,15 an obvious reference to the event above. In ascertaining when the fast on the 13th could have arisen, we need to con- sider when the holiday of Yom Nikanor ceased being observed in Babylonia. Babylonia is of interest to us because (as will be shown) it is the place where 9. I Maccabees, 7:47^9 (Jonathan A. Goldstein, trans., The Anchor Bible. I Maccabees [Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1976], 328). 10. II Maccabees, 15:35-36 (Jonathan A. Goldstein, trans., The Anchor Bible. II Maccabees [Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1983], 476). 11. Josephus, Jewish Antiquities, XII, para. 412 (Loeb edition). 12. There may not even have been a prohibition to last on days such as this until Megillat ta 'anit, the collection of these holidays, was authored and accepted. 13. Megillat ta 'anit is referred to in M. Ta'anit, 2:8. According to the Talmud (B. Shabbat 13b), it was compiled by Hananiah b. Hezekiah b. Garon (first century). It is a brief list of holidays, in Aramaic. There also exists a scholium to Megillat ta'anit. The scholium was compiled in a later period. Traditions about Yom Nikanor are found in the scholium, and in B. Ta'anit 18b, Y. Ta'anit 2:13 (66a), and Y. Megillah 1:6 (70c). 14. it was mennonea earner inai some auinonues înierpreieu csuier y.jv-j i io ímpiy me jews acceptance of an obligation to fast annually on the 13th of Adar. It is not known how most of those adopting this interpretation explain the listing of the 13th of Adar in Megillat ta'anit as a day upon which eulogizing, and by implication fasting as well, are prohibited. But in the case of R. Abraham b. David of Posquieres, there is a record of his explanation. According to the Ran (Ta'anit 7a, in the pages of Rif), R. Abraham b. David took the position that Megillat ta 'anit never meant to prohibit fasting on the 13th of Adar. It only meant to prohibit eulogizing. 15. Or Nikanor. There are different readings. 312</page><page sequence="5">The Origin of Ta'anit Esther the fast of the 13th was first observed. The last clear evidence of any of the Jews of Babylonia observing any of the holidays mentioned in Megillat ta 'anit comes from a story about R. Nahman (late third-early fourth century).16 Nonetheless, some have argued that the holidays may have been observed in Babylonia for several centuries after his time.17 III. Babylonian Geonic Sources That Refer Briefly to the Practice of Fasting on the 13th of Adar Several Babylonian geonic sources make brief reference to the practice of fasting on the 13th of Adar. The sources in this section date from the ninth century ce and later. The earliest such source is a responsum of R. Natronai,18 16. References to "R. Nahman" in the Babylonian Talmud are generally assumed to be refer- ences to R. Nahman b. Jacob. His year of death is estimated at 320 ce {Encyclopaedia Judaica 12:773). (All references to the Encyclopaedia Judaica in this article are to the first edition, unless other- wise noted.) The story, at B. Ta'anit 18b, records that R. Nahman declared a fast on the 12th of Adar. The rabbis of his time objected because it was Trajan Day. R. Nahman responded that Trajan Day was no longer in effect due to a certain tragedy that had occurred on it. The story clearly implies that the rabbis of his time held that Trajan Day was still in effect, or would otherwise have still been in effect, if not for the tragedy. 17. Although, as we learn from B. Ta'anit 18b, some of the holidays may have been discontin- ued earlier. Both the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds include passages recording the views of Amoraim on the issue of whether the holidays of Megillat ta'anit were still in effect. See B. Rosh Ha-shanah 18b-19b, Y. Ta'anit 2:13 (66a), Y. Megillah 1:6 (70d), and Y. Nedarim 8:1 (40d). All but one of the Amoraim whose views are recorded are Palestinian. Almost all of these take the position that the holidays were no longer in effect. The only Babylonian Amora whose view is recorded in these sources is Rav (or in another version: Rav Huna). The view recorded in the name of this Sage is also that the holidays were no longer in effect. Those who argue that the holidays of Megillat ta 'anit survived in Babylonia well into the amoraic period point to the fact that only one Babylonia Amora is recorded in the above sources as taking the position that the holidays were no longer in effect. See, e.g., Yosef Tabory, Mo 'adey yisra 'eil bi-tekufat ha-mishnah ve-ha-talmud (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1995), 320-21. Also, B. Rosh Ha-shanah 19b records two different traditions about whether the holidays were still in effect: ve-hilkhita batlu and ve-hilkhita lo batlu (or in the version of the Rif, Rosh, Ritba, and others: ve-hilkhita batlah and ve-hilkhita lo batlah). Perhaps there was no contradiction that needed to be resolved, just two different viewpoints about whether Megillat ta 'anit was still in effect. Moreover, according to many scholars, the term ve-hilkhita often reflects a statement made in the late amoraic, or savoraic, period. Thus, it can be argued that even in the late amoraic period and perhaps beyond, there were those in Babylonia who considered Megillat ta 'anit to still be in effect. The resolution of the "contradiction" (one statement applies to Hanukkah and Purim, and the other to the balance of the holidays) perhaps came in an even later period. See David Halivni, Mekorot u-mesorot: bi'urim ba-talmud le-seder mo' ed (Jerusalem: Beit ha-midrash la-rabbanim be-America, 1975), 386 (commentary to B. Rosh Ha-shanah 18b); and Vered Noam, Megillat ta'anit (Jerusalem: Yad Yizhak Ben-Zvi, 2003), 356, and more generally, 355-61. 18. See Brody, Teshuvot Rav Natronai, 303-304, responsum 177. In this work, Brody gathers from a variety of sources the responsa that he can attribute to R. Natronai b. Hilai. This particular responsum had been printed in the geonic collection Hemdah genuzah in a section of twenty-four responsa attributed to R. Natronai and R. Paltoi. For a variety of reasons, Brody concludes that all twenty-four were written by R. Natronai. That our particular responsum was composed by R. Natronai is confirmed by another work, Seder pars hiyyot shelyamim tovim ve-haftarot shelahen. The expanded 313</page><page sequence="6">Mitchell First head of the academy at Sura from 857 to 865 ce.19 R. Natronai writes that on the fast days after the Shabbat shel regel,20 and on all fast days,21 whether on fixed dates or decreed by beit din, and oms mum,22 the practice was to read va-yehal Moshe at both shaharit and minhah P Another source is the Siddur of R. Se'adyah (882-942),24 which provides texts of three selihot for the 13th of Adar in the same section as that of selihot for the 9th of Av, the 17th of Tammuz, the 3rd of Tishrei, and the 10th of Tevet.25 Writing in Arabic, R. Se'adyah calls the fast rhixhin Dix (the fast of the Megillah).26 version of this work includes a shortened version of our responsum, with an attribution of the respon- sum to R. Natronai. (The original version of Seder parshiyyot is shorter and does not include any version of our responsum.) Seder parshiyyot will be discussed further in Part VI. The responsum (not the shortened version) is also found in Sefer ha-pardes, 261, and Likkutey pardes, laws of the 9th of Av. It is not attributed to any particular Gaon in these sources. It is also included in Ozar ha-ge'onim, Megillah, 58 (sec. 216). 19. 1 have followed the dates for R. Natronai given by Brody in The Geonim of Babylonia, 344. 20. The Shabbat shel regel is most likely a reference to a special Shabbat in honor of the Exi- larch that was observed annually on Shabbat parshat lekh lekha. Brody, Teshuvot Rav Natronai, 303 n. 5. The fast after this Shabbat was most likely instituted to atone for any sins that may have been inad- vertently committed on the occasion. 21 . The responsum provides one exception to this rule. On the 9th of Av, the custom was to read ki tolid banim at shaharit, and ve-yehal Moshe at minhah. 22. The responsum does not state explicitly that the fast was on the 13th. When this responsum was printed in Hemdah genuzah, the text printed was oniD JTPjyro. This could be understood as a refer- ence to the Palestinian custom of three days of fasting in Adar, perhaps as a consequence of the emigra- tion of Palestinian Jews to Babylonia. But most of the responsa printed in Hemdah genuzah are also found in manuscript Cambridge 474, and this manuscript reads nniD rrara. For a description of manu- script Cambridge 474, see Solomon Schechter, "Notes on Hebrew Mss. in the University Library at Cambridge," Jewish Quarterly Review O.S. 4 (1892): 89-101. Both Sefer ha-pardes and Likkutey pardes also read ams wivm. Brody has little doubt that this is the correct reading and that here we have an early reference to the practice of fasting on the 13th. The fact that the shortened version of the responsum reads either nniD msm or "inox Iran (see below, Part VI) confirms this reading as well. 23. R. Sar Shalom (R. Natronai 's predecessor at Sura) wrote a very similar responsum, except that it contains no reference to the fast days after the Shabbat shel regel and no reference to any fast day in connection with Purim. (Perhaps this is significant. See below, n. 133.) This responsum of R. Sar Shalom is quoted in many places, the original version and an abbreviated version. See, e.g., Seder Rav 'Amram Ga'on, ed. Daniel Goldschmidt (Jerusalem: Mossad Harav Kook, 1971), 95-96, and Tur OH 566. For the additional references, see Refael Shmuel Weinberg, Teshuvot Rav Sar Shalom Ga'on (Jerusalem: Mossad Harav Kook, 1975), 87-88. 24. Although R. Se'adyah lived in Egypt for approximately the first thirty years of his life, there is convincing evidence that his siddur was composed in Babylonia. See Siddur Rav Se'adyah Ga 'on, eds. Israel Davidson, Simhah Assaf, and Yissakhar Joel (Jerusalem: Rubin Mass, 1941), intro., 22-23. (I will abbreviate this work hereinafter as SRSG.) 25. SRSG, 319-38. See also SRSG, 258. 26. SRSG, 319. Also, the selihot themselves refer to the practice of fasting. The second selihah for the 13th of Adar begins: tela'ot be-yom zomi 'asaprah (on this fast day, I will tell the story of things that made me weary), SRSG, 337. The third selihah also refers to the practice of fasting. See below, n. 84. 314</page><page sequence="7">The Origin of Ta'anit Esther The fast is also referred to in a responsum that constitutes a reply from R. Sherira (d. 1006) and R. Hai (d. 1038) to R. Jacob of Kairouan.27 We do not have the actual responsum, but we do have an index to a collection of geonic responsa in which its compiler recorded the first few words of each responsum and the name of the relevant talmudic tractate. For this particular responsum, the compiler wrote the following in his index: V19Í7 UK "pVn Tua T 2Vr mynm (on the fast of the 13 th of Adar, it is our practice to recite the Tahanun prayer), and the name of the tractate, Ta 'anit. Also, a responsum addressed to R. Hai inquires whether, in the case of a hakhnasat kallah that occurs on a fast day such as the 13th of Adar, the one who makes the blessing on the cup of berakhah is permitted to drink.29 An anonymous geonic responsum includes the following statement: wn "17X to 3i'*O TOTiö "TM liWK-in 17K *7W a'*1! (on the 13th of the first Adar [in a leap year], we also fast as on the 13th of the second Adar).30 Finally, Sefer ha-mikzo'ot, a work by an unknown author from the late geonic period, refers briefly to the fast, as will be discussed in Part VI.31 Not all of the selihot which R. Se'adyah included in his Siddur were composed by him. Menahem Zulay believed that the three included for the 13th of Adar were composed by R. Se'adyah. See his Ha-askolah ha-payyetanit shel Rav Se'adyah Ga'on (Jerusalem: Mekhon Shoken, 1964), 45. More recently, Yosef Tobi took the position that this is probable. See his Piyyutey Rav Se 'adyah Ga 'on (Jerusalem, 1982), 129 and 132. There is a geonic responsum that cites lines from the first of these three selihot and attributes the selihah to R. Se'adyah. See Jacob Mann, "Addenda to 'The Responsa of the Babylonian Geonim as a Source of Jewish History,'" Jewish Quarterly Review 1 1 (1920-21): 465 n. 32. But there is no source that connects R. Se'adyah with the second or third of the three selihot, even though it is reasonable to presume that he composed them. Tobi points out that it is now known from Genizah material that R. Se'adyah composed more selihot for the 13th of Adar than are included in his siddur. One such selihah was printed in SRSG, 423 (appendix). 27. Louis Ginzberg, Geonica (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1909), vol. 2, 67-68. 28. Ginzberg suggests that this word should be read shel or yom. 29. Shelomoh Wertheimer, Sefer kohelet Shelomoh (Jerusalem: A. M. Luntz, 1 899), 14. In this responsum, the question mentions the custom of fasting on the 13th of Adar, while the answer does not. From reading the answer, there is no reason to doubt that R. Hai accepted the premise of the question that the 1 3th of Adar was a fast day. JU. Louis uinzberg, ed., Uinzey òchechter, vol. 1 (New York: Beit ha-midrash ha-rabbanim be-America, 1929), 136.

This responsum seems to include the same statement, but the statement is cut off mid- sentence. (This may be the same responsum, included in a different collection of geonic responsa.) 3 1 . A few other early references to the fast of the 1 3th of Adar also deserve mention, even though they are not from geonic Babylonia: Al-Biruni, a Muslim scholar of Persian origin, writing in 1000 ce, refers to the Jews' obser- vance of a fast on the 13th of Adar. He refers to the fast briefly, calling it "the fasting of Alburi" (Purim). See Al-Biruni, The Chronology of Ancient Nations, trans. C. Edward Sachau (London: W. H. Allen, 1879), 273.

MlDRASH TaNHUMA AND THE She'ILTOT OF R. AHA! GaON An anonymous Babylonian geonic responsum that made its way into Midrash Tanhuma refers to a practice of fasting on the 13th of Adar.32 A discus- sion similar to that found in this responsum also occurs in the She 'iltot of R. Ahai Gaon,33 a work composed in eighth-century Babylonia.34 Recent scholarship, Ha-'iggud ha-'olami le-mada'ey ha-yahadut, 2007), 105-14. Yanon b. Zemah, a pay tan from Syria in the first half of the eleventh century, refers to the fast. See below, n. 130. One of the three texts of Megillat ta 'anit batra found in the genizah includes the 13th of Adar, recording: "inox imn "Q a"' See Elizur, Lammah zamnu, 159 n. 42. This text most likely dates to the eleventh century. (Dr. Edna Engel, The Hebrew Palaeography Project of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, private correspondence, January 1 , 2009.) A passage that refers to the practice of fasting on the 13th of Adar is found in one of the three manuscripts of the Seder Rav 'Amram. See Seder Rav 'Amram Ga'on (ed. Goldschmidt), 101. But Goldschmidt believes that this passage is an addition to the Seder from the time of the Rishonim. It is accepted that many additions and changes were made to the Seder in the centuries after R. ' Amram 's death (c. 875). The manuscript that included the reference to the fast was copied in 1426. (The other two manuscripts of the Seder are also late.) Goldschmidt observed that this manuscript included many unique additions, and that it reflected the traditions of Northern France. See Seder Rav 'Amram Ga'on, 17-18. 32. The responsum is found at Midrash Tanhuma, Bere 'shit, sec. 3. (When I refer to Midrash Tanhuma, I am referring to the standard printed Midrash Tanhuma. The responsum is not found in the edition of Midrash Tanhuma first published in the late nineteenth century by Solomon Buber.) Midrash Tanhuma also includes passages taken from the She 'iltot of R. Ahai Gaon. See Midrash Tanhuma, Bere shit, sec. 2, Noah, sec. 4, Hukkat, sec. 2; and Brody, Le-toledot, 118. Based on this, scholars believe that Midrash Tanhuma underwent final redaction in geonic Babylonia (or in an area under the sphere of influence of the Babylonian geonim). See Encyclopaedia Judaica 19:503 (2nd ed.); and Mark Bregman, Sifrut tanhuma-yelammedenu (Piscataway, NJ: Gorgias Press, 2003), 184-86. See further, below, n. 100. 33. There are many differences in the wording of the two sources, and it does not seem that the later of the two sources is copying from the earlier. She 'Uta 79, in giving its source for the interpretation oîyom ha-kenisah, does use the phrase peirshu hakhamim (the Sages explained). But it is unlikely that she 'Uta 79 is referring directly to the geonic responsum. More likely, the reference is to the Sages of geonic times. 34. 1 will refer to the entire work as the She 'iltot. I will refer to individual units by the lower case she 'Uta (pl. she 'iltot). The earliest source that connects R. Ahai with a collection of she 'iltot is a responsum by either R. Sherira or R. Hai. See Brody, The Geonim of Babylonia, 207. Probably, many of the discussions in the She 'iltot were written by others, and only collected or adapted by R. Ahai. (But some of the textual witnesses to the She 'iltot contain material that is later than R. Ahai.) According to the letter of R. Sherira, R. Ahai left Babylonia for Palestine around 750 ce, when his disciple was promoted to the position of Gaon of Pumbedita instead of him. This raises the possibility that the work was com- posed or completed in Palestine. But there are strong reasons for believing that the work represents a collection of material from Babylonia (even allowing for the remote possibility that it was completed by R. Ahai in Palestine). A few of these reasons are: (1) a she 'Uta is a homily of a particular form that was prevalent in Babylonia and differed from Palestinian-type homilies; (2) the She 'iltot is organized according to the Babylonian Torah portions (i.e., it follows the yearly cycle of portions and not the tri- ennial cycle used in Palestine); (3) the various she 'iltot in the work use phrases like Ian, 'anan, and 316</page><page sequence="9">The Origin of Ta'anit Esther however, strongly suggests that the relevant she 'Uta is a later addition that made its way into the work one or two centuries after the text left the hands of R. Ahai.35 Both the geonic responsum and the relevant she 'Uta record an interpretation of certain verses in Chapter 9 of the book of Esther and of the statement of the Amora R. Samuel b. Isaac: KT1 W? rfrnp pT y» (the 13th was a day of gathering for all).36 This interpretation asserts that the statements in the book of Esther at 9:1-2 and/or 9:16-17 that the Jews gathered themselves C^npJ) on the 13th of Adar, and the above statement by R. Samuel b. Isaac, all indicate that the Jews fasted on the 13th of Adar in the year of the threat.37 Also, both the geonic hakha when referring to Babylonia, and phrases like hatam and lehu when referring to Palestine. Brody also argues that the She 'iltot, in its original form, never cites the Jerusalem Talmud or Palestinian mid- rashic collections. Meiri, in his introduction to M. Avot, tells us that R. Ahai died in the year 4512. If this tradition is accurate, this would be 752 ce, only a short time after R. Ahai arrived in Palestine. For further background to the She'iltot, see Brody, The Geonim of Babylonia, 202-215. 35. This will be explained further below. 36. B. Megillah 2a. R. Samuel b. Isaac does not cite any verse, but he is probably alluding to a verse or verses. The verses to which he could be alluding would be 9:1-2 (which include the word nikhalu in verse 9:2), 9:16-17 (which include the word nikhalu in verse 9:16), and 8:11-12 (which include the word le-hikkaheil in verse 8:11). The geonic responsum, when providing its interpretation of yom ha-kenisah, only includes one citation to verses. The verses it cites, in all the editions I have seen, are 9: 1-2. She 'ilia 79, when provid- ing its interpretation, cites verses twice. In Appendix I, I have printed the text of the 1546 Venice edition of she 'Uta 79. The citation there is to 9: 16-17 in both instances. But when one looks at manuscripts, and sees how she 'Uta 79 is cited in the Rishonim, the picture is different. Samuel Kaiman Mirsky prepared an edition of the She 'iltot based on nine relatively complete European manuscripts. Of these, eight include she 'ilia 79. Four of these mention 9:2 in both citations. Of the four manuscripts that cite to 9:16-17 in the first citation, all of these, in the second citation, start with nikhalu ha-yehudim, a phrase from 9:2, even though their citation continues with 9:17. See Mirsky, She'iltot de-Rav Ahai Ga'on (Jerusalem: Ha-makhon le-mehkar u-le-hoza'at sefarim Sura, 1960-77), vol. 3, 225, notes to line 54, and see below, Appendix I, n. 147. Surely, she 'Uta 79 did not cite a combination of two verses in its second citation, and some textual corruption has occurred. With regard to the way she 'Uta 79 is cited in the Rishonim, most of the time its interpretation is summarized briefly without citation to any verse. But the few times a verse is cited in the sources that I have seen, the citation is to 9:2 (or to 9:1-2). See, e.g., R. Eliezer b. Joel ha-Levi, Sefer Ravyah, sees. 550 and 559; and R. Isaiah Di Trani, Tosafot Rid, commentary to Megillah 2a. But see the Genizah fragment of the latter part of she 'Uta 79, referred to at Appendix I, n. 147. 5 1. As to what happened alter the year ot the threat, she Uta ly reters to yom ha-kemsah as something in effect bi-zeman she-beit ha-mikdash kayyam (during the period that the Temple was stand- ing). The geonic responsum includes no such statement. But in describing what occurred in the year of the threat, the geonic responsum includes the phrase ve-gazru ta 'anit, and in describing the fast day, the geonic responsum calls it a de-rabbanan. Taken together, these passages imply that the view of the geonic responsum was that in the year of the threat a decree was enacted that bound future generations. Neither the geonic responsum nor she 'Uta 79 refers to the prohibition to fast on Yom Nikanor. According to rabbinic chronology (e.g., Seder olam, chap. 28 and B. Megillah 1 lb), Ahashver- osh was the king immediately before the Darius in whose reign the Second Temple was built. In fact, Ahashverosh is to be identified with the king the Greeks called Xerxes (whose Persian name was Khshayarsha, and whose name was recorded in Aramaic documents as Witn2m,t2rpwn and unwiN). 317</page><page sequence="10">Mitchell First responsum and the relevant she 'Uta interpret the term yom ha-kenisah in M. Megillah 1:1-2 as a reference to the 13th of Adar as a fast day (the day on which the Jews gather to fast). M.

Towns that were surrounded by walls at the time of Joshua son of Nun read on the 15th. Villages and cities read on the 14th, but villages may advance their reading to yom ha-kenisah. How does this occur? If the 14th falls on a Monday, villages and cities read that day, and walled towns read the next day. If it falls on a Tuesday or Wednes- day, villages may advance their reading to yom ha-kenisah. Cities read that day (the 14th), and walled towns read the next day. If it falls on a Thursday, villages and cities read that day, and walled towns read the next day. If it falls on Erev Shabbat, villages may advance their reading to yom ha-kenisah. Cities and walled towns read that day (the 14th). If it falls on Shabbat, villages and cities may advance their reading to yom ha-kenisah. Walled towns read the next day. If it falls on the day after Shabbat, villages may advance their reading to yom ha-kenisah. Cities read that day (the 14th), and walled towns read the next day.38 These sections of the Mishnah permit villagers to fulfill their Megillah obli- gation on the 11th, 12th, or 13th of Adar under certain conditions. In the plain See Mitchell First, Jewish History in Conflict (Northvale, NJ: Jason Aronson, 1997), 166 n. 17; and Bezalel Porten and Jerome A. Lund, Aramaic Documents from Egypt: A Key-Word-in-Context Concor- dance (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2002), 356. Xerxes reigned from 486 to 465 bce, immediately after Darius I, in whose reign the Second Temple was built. According to Herodotus (middle of the fifth century bce), the name of Xerxes' wife was Ames- tris. The "is" at the end of this name is just a Greek addition (just like the "es" at the end of "Xerxes"). We have no Persian sources for her name, but can deduce from the Greek name Amestris that her name in Persian was likely based upon the consonants M, S, T, and R. Almost certainly, Esther (consonants S, T, and R), and Amestris are one and the same, despite one or two discrepancies that exist between the little information about Amestris furnished by Herodotus and certain details found in the book of Esther. 38. The text of these sections is fairly well established. I have printed a standard text. The trans- lation is my own. 318</page><page sequence="11">The Origin of Ta'anit Esther sense of these sections, yom ha-kenisah refers to Mondays and Thursdays,39 and the teaching is that the reading for the villagers may be advanced to these days, when the villagers enter, or gather in, the cities.40 But in the interpretation adopted by the geonic responsum and the relevant she 'Uta, yom ha-kenisah means the fast of the 13th of Adar (the day on which the Jews gather to fast). The reading for the villagers is allowed to advance because the date of the observance of the fast day is advanced due to a prohibition of fasting on Shabbat and Erev Shabbat that is read into the Mishnah. In this interpretation, the advanced fast day is a day upon which the reading for the villa- gers is allowed.41 If the 14th fell on a Sunday, the fast would be observed on Thursday, the 11th.42 If the 14th fell on Shabbat, the fast would be observed on Thursday, the 12th. If the 14th fell on Erev Shabbat, the fast would be observed on Thursday, the 13th.43 The following is the relevant passage in Midrash Tanhuma: -ws; n^tm iwy mwa -iwy inxa nxipi rft^a pm xn Ï7xw xnaTiaa it rfrxw naitzmi ppna wimw pra Yia^x nnrr t'xi ,-inr íòi nina vb -iwy nwana -îwy nyaixa x*?x nnix imp "px p rxva xanoai ^xin mn pra *?ax ,inaix *?y p™ ^xiun nrx rfr^a p'Tft va min*5 "a-ft ra ia^n ,nnrr "»ana na^n ix p"na na^m ruara nmx imp lu ia ywirr mo*»» nain copian raía p"n laxp "on nsara x^x nxipj xm no^an dv1? ranpa onDant^ x^x ir"»a imp m^na rm^i nriDa it^y n^ana x^x n^an r')oi "»d "iaa^ n^yna a^v1? nai Ji'^a a'^a x'^a nx"ip3 n^a pm 39. See the discussion below. 40. Villagers would typically enter and gather in the cities on Mondays and Thursdays for various ritual and judicial practices. See Hayim Lapin, "Some Observations on Mishnah Megillah 1:1-3," in Netiy'ot le-David: sefer ha-yovel le-David Halivni, eds. Yaakov Elman et al. (Jerusalem: Orhot, 2005), 92-111. Another way of reading the Mishnah is that the reading on the advanced dates is taking place in the villages. In this reading, the term j&gt;ow ha-kenisah is used because villagers would typically gather in their synagogues (battei kneisiyyot) or in some other manner, on Monday and Thursday. See, e.g., Tosafot, Yevamot 14a, s.v. hi, and Maimonides, Mishneh torah, hilkhot megillah 1:6. That the villagers are traveling to the city for the advanced reading is the simpler reading of the Mishnah, and is implied from the various statements at Y. Megillah 1 : 1 (70b); and B. Megillah 2a, 4a-b, and 19a about the villagers providing food, or water and food, to the cities. 41 . M either trie geonic responsum nor she Uta IV states wnetner tnis advanced reading is taking place in the cities or in the villages. See Appendix III. 42. Both the geonic responsum included in Midrash 1 anhuma and she ilta 79 stated that the last is observed on Thursday when the 14th falls on Sunday. In the period of the Rishonim, most commu- nities followed this practice. But the custom in Provence was to fast on Friday in such a case. See, e.g., Aaron b. Jacob ha-Kohen, Orhot hayyim, hilkhot megillah w-Purim, sec. 26; and Meiri, Magen 'avot, treatise 23. 43. If the 14th fell on Tuesday or Wednesday, the fast would be observed on the 13th. These cases are not included in the responsum, but follow from the interpretation. If the 14th fell on Monday, the responsum instructs that the reading could not be advanced. It is forced into this position by the text of the Mishnah. The text of the Mishnah also forces the position that the reading cannot be advanced if the 14th fell on Thursday, even though this case is not included in the responsum. 319</page><page sequence="12">Mitchell First 44uv "iwy rwhw ia naxi '^npn uv no^an uv •'xai ,ncnan or1? ranpa ansane ïïnpi nyi in or iwy ntzftwa tin win xm win iwy D^wai aviai trn biï n*?np xm trv -îtpy nyaix ^ax "nxa -iwy nuftwa myn nm i^npa 'in arrnya Dmrrn x*?x im x1? nTan iwiwai ,nnawi nnwa or imx nwyi in -iwy nyaixa nui aviai n^a irww ht .ait: uv rtznyi i"ua imp rspian *?ai ltznw la^o1? -iwy nwana nawa inxa rrprf7 r1» *?n ûxw nn^3 m»na n^ iioiw irara a^r1?

R. Judah said that this rule is only in effect when the calendar is established by the testimony of witnesses and Israel dwells on its own land, but in our times49 ... the Megillah can only be read on the proper date (the 14th or 15th). Does the halakha follow the first opinion or does it follow R. Judah? 44. This source has vom, while B. Megillah 2a and she 'Uta 79 have zeman. 45. There are rishonim who cite teshuvot ha-Ge'onim (or teshuvat ha-Ge'onim) for the ruling that when the 14th of Adar falls on Sunday, the practice is to fast on Thursday, because the recital of selihot and tahanunim on Erev Shabbat would interfere with the preparations for Shabbat. See, e.g., R. Isaac of Vienna, Orzarti 'a, hilkhot megillah, sec. 367; Rosh, commentary to Megillah 2a; and Tosafot Rosh, commentary to Megillah 2a; and Ran, his own commentary to Megillah 2a, and his commentary to Rif, Megillah 2a (p. lb in the pages of Rif). I have not seen any such geonic responsum, and it is possible that the source is the above responsum in Midrash Tanhuma (even though the responsum uses the word rahamim, and not tahanu- nim). If this is the case, it is surprising that the responsum is not referred to as* being from Midrash Tanhuma. Perhaps after the earliest source (R. Isaac of Vienna, or some earlier source) referred to the responsum loosely as coming from teshuvot ha-Ge 'onim, the later sources merely repeated this reference. 46. A similar expression is used by Pirkoy Ben Baboy (early ninth century). This will be dis- cussed in Part VI. 47. In the next few lines, the responsum is quoting selectively from the Mishnah and paraphrasing. 48. The quotation of the responsum ends here. 49. 1 did not translate the phrase p TWpa xano&amp;T rxin, as it seems to be an erroneous reading. (Ez Yosef takes this position as well.) The phrase makes little sense coming from a Tanna. The statement of R. Judah is found at both B. Megillah 2a and T. Megillah 1:3. In these sources, the words immedi- ately following bi-zeman hazeh are either nu fanoni 'rNin (because they anticipate it) or T»»noai 'rxin m (because they endanger themselves through it). See Saul Lieberman, Tosefta ki-feshutah, T. Megillah 1:3. 320</page><page sequence="13">The Origin of Ta'anit Esther They responded: According to both R. Judah and the first opinion, the Megillah can only be read on the proper date. The following is what the first opinion meant. Towns that were surrounded by walls at the time of Joshua son of Nun read on the 15th. Villages and cities read on the 14th, but villages may advance their reading to yom ha-kenisah. When the Mishnah taught that the Megillah may be read on the 11th, 12th, 13th, etc., that applied to one who is engaged in fasting, as it was taught at the end of the Mishnah: "but villages may advance their reading to yom ha-kenisah." What is yom ha-kenisahl The day of gathering, as it is stated (in the Talmud): The thirteenth was a day of gathering for all, as it is written (Esther 9:1-2): "In the 12th month, the month of Adar, on its thirteenth day ... the Jews gathered themselves in their cities." They gathered themselves and decreed a fast on the 13th of Adar. But the 14th was a holiday, as it is written (Esther 9: 17) "and they rested on its 14th and made it a day of feasting and gladness." In Shushan ha-birah, they only rested on the 15th. Therefore, Shushan and all walled towns read on the 15th and make that a festive day. When the Mishnah taught that "the Megillah may be read (on the 11th, 12th, 13th ... )" that concerned one who is engaged in fasting, because it is forbidden to engage in fasting on Shabbat. If the 14th falls on the first day of the week, it is forbidden to fast on Shabbat. It is also forbidden to fast on Erev Shabbat, because of the necessity of preparing for Shabbat. Rather, the fast is advanced to Thursday, which is the 11th of Adar. If the 14th falls on Shabbat, it is forbidden to fast on Erev Shabbat because of the necessity of preparing for Shabbat. The primary reason for a fast day is the recital of selihot and rahamim, and reciting these (instead of preparing for Shabbat) will detract from honoring the Shabbat. Honoring the shabbat is more impor- tant than a thousand fasts, for honoring the Shabbat is a commandment from the Torah, while the fast is a rabbinic decree. The Torah commandment of honoring the Shabbat takes precedence over the fast, a rabbinic decree. Hence the fast is advanced to Thursday, the 12th. If the 14th falls on Erev Shabbat, the fast is observed on Thursday, which is the 13th. This is set forth in the Mishnah. How does this occur? If it falls on a Monday, villages and cities read that day and walled towns read the next day. If it falls on Shabbat or the first day of the week, villages advance the reading to yom ha-kenisah, etc. But when the 9th of Av falls on Shabbat, the fast is postponed until after Shabbat, since this fast was instituted as a punishment. Therefore, the fast is postponed and not advanced. From the above discussion we learn that one may not engage in a volunta- rily self-afflicted fast on Erev Shabbat. Neither the community nor the individ- . ual. That is the law.50 50. Midrash Tanhuma, Bere shit, sec. 3. The previous section in Midrash Tanhuma (sec. 2) had discussed the issue of what time one who is fasting on Erev Shabbat is required to end his fast. (Sec. 2 was an abridged version of the first she 'Uta in Bere shit.) The redactors of Midrash Tanhuma apparently decided to include our responsum here because it discussed the issue of fasting on the 13th of Adar when it fell on Erev Shabbat. I have printed the text of the Jerusalem 1958 edition. This version of Midrash Tanhuma was first published in 1520-1522. The third edition, published in 1563, served as the basis for all later editions. 321</page><page sequence="14">Mitchell First One of the cases discussed in this responsum is the case of the 14th of Adar falling on Shabbat. Almost certainly, this would no longer have occurred at the time this responsum was composed.51 This suggests, as does a close reading of the responsum, that it is not describing a still current practice of fasting on the 13th. It is only interpreting M. Megillah 1:1-2, the ninth chapter of the book of Esther, and the statement of R. Samuel b. Isaac, and describing a practice of fasting on the 13th that theoretically occurred in ancient times, according to the interpretations it was offering. With regard to the relevant she Hita, she 'Uta 79,52 1 have printed it in Appen- dix I. It is one of four she 'iltot for Purim. Robert Brody has suggested that the four she 'iltot for Purim were probably not in the original she 'iltot when it left the hands of R. Ahai, but were composed at a later stage.53 She 'Uta 79 is even more problematic than the other three. After the first few lines in Aramaic, its balance is almost entirely in Hebrew, unlike the rest of the she 'iltot.54 Also, the characteristic structure of a she 'Uta, a problematic question and its resolution, is completely lacking in she 'Uta 79. Careful reading of the geonic responsum and she 'Uta 79 suggests that the geonic responsum is the earlier source. It is organized and concise, and seems to reflect an attempt to record an official interpretation of M. Megillah l:l-2.55 She 'Uta 79, by contrast, seems to take for granted an already established expla- nation of these sections of the Mishnah, which it reiterates and comments upon. In its reiteration, she 'Uta 79 leaves out certain points, making it difficult to under- stand without reference to the geonic responsum. Nonetheless, in some areas it is more expansive than the geonic responsum. She 'Uta 79 can be read as only reiterating interpretations of M. Megillah 1 : 1- 2, the ninth chapter of the book of Esther, and the statement of R. Samuel b. Isaac, without describing a practice of fasting in its own time or implying that there was I have looked at a reprint of the 1563 edition. It is practically the same as that which I printed. The translation is my own. 51. When the 14th of Adar falls on Shabbat, the upcoming Yom Kippur would fall on Friday. Already in the time of R. Yose b. Bun (c. 300), the 14th of Adar was not being allowed to fall on Shabbat or Monday, so that Yom Kippur would not fall on Friday or Sunday. See Y. Megillah 1 :2 (70b), Encyclopaedia Judaica 5:49, and Tabory, Mo'adey yisra'eil, 28. See also B. Rosh Ha-shanah 20a. She 'Uta 79 stated explicitly that the 14th of Adar no longer fell on Shabbat in its time. 52. 1 am following Mirsky's numbering, which is followed by Brody. These numbers are arti- ficial, as the she 'iltot can be broken up in different ways. In Mirsky's edition, she 'iltot 76-79 are located where the she 'iltot for va-yakhel would be, and are called she 'iltot for Purim. In some of the other printed editions, these she 'iltot are called she 'iltot for va-yakhel (and have a different numbering). 53. Brody, Le-toledot, 186 n. 5, and The Geonim of Babylonia, 209 n. 29. Structurally, they are deficient as she 'iltot. (She 'iltot 76 through 78 are very short and undeveloped. With regard to she 'Uta 79, see the text above.) Also, there is some variation in the manuscripts with regard to their location in the work. This suggests that they were later additions, attempted to be integrated into an already fixed work. 54. Brody, Le-toledot, 186 n. 5. 55. Even though the interpretation itself may have been older. Brody, in private correspondence, agrees that the geonic responsum was probably composed before she 'Uta 79. 322</page><page sequence="15">The Origin of Ta'anit Esther such a practice. But a better reading of this entire she 'Uta suggests that a practice of fasting on the 13th of Adar at that time is implied. She 'Uta 79 probably dates from the ninth or tenth century,56 and it is reasonable to work with the assumption that the geonic responsum dates from the eighth or ninth century.57 The interpretation of the word nikhalu as expressed in the geonic responsum and she 'Uta 79 strays far from the word's plain sense. The root k-h-1 implies only gathering, not fasting, and it is clear from the contexts in Esther 9:2 and 9:16 that nikhalu refers to a physical gathering to fight enemies.58 Also far from its plain sense is the interpretation of the statement of R. Samuel b. Isaac, yod-gimmel zeman kehillah la-kol hiy.59 The plain sense of the statement is that R. Samuel b. Isaac is describing the 13th as a day on which the Jews gathered to fight.60 He employs the word kehillah because the book of Esther uses words from this root several times in its eighth and ninth chapters, when describing the Jews' activities on that day. 56.

Also, nikhalu ve- 'amod 'al nafsham at 9: 1 6 is parallel to le-hikkahel ve-la 'amod 'al nafsham at 8: 1 1 , and the context at 8: 1 1 is even clearer that le-hikkahel refers to a physical gathering to fight their enemies. 59. The full statement is ""OÏ7 fix xti NT! 737 7'T7''? pT x ' B. Megillah 2a. In manuscripts ot the Talmud, there are variants here with regard to the last three words.

Another does not have the last three words at all. 60. There is no doubt that this is the plain sense interpretation of his statement. But as further support, a statement by R. Helbo at Y. Megillah 1:1 (69d) calls the 13th of Adar "yom milhamah" in its parallel (but not identical) discussion. Even though the rishonim (other than those following the interpretation included in Midrash Tanhuma and she 'Uta 79) agree that R. Samuel b. Isaac is referring to the 13th as a day of fighting, there is still a disagreement as to how to understand his statement. The main approaches are that of Rashi, and the Ri (R. Isaac of Dampierre; the view of the Ri is described in the Rosh and in others.) According to Rashi, R. Samuel b. Isaac is expressing the view that because the 13th of Adar was the day that all the Jews (not just the Jews in Shushan) gathered to fight, this was the day of the main miracle. Therefore, the Men of the Great Assembly did not need to find an allusion in a verse to enable them to permit the reading on this day. As to the Ri, he notes that Y. Megillah 1 : 1 (69d) states that if the reading is permitted on the 12th and 14th, it is illogical to hold that it cannot be read on the 13th. Therefore, one does not need to derive the permission to read it from a verse. Ri argues that R. Samuel b. Isaac is taking the same position. (But Ri's explanation does not fit the language of the statement of R. Samuel b. Isaac.) For an alternative approach to these passages, see Daniel Sperber, Minhagey yisra'eil, vol. 4 (Jerusalem: Mossad Harav Kook, 1995), 250-52. Note that the statement of R. Samuel b. Isaac is recorded twice at B. Megillah 2a (and in many of the manuscripts). First, it is recorded in a section that begins with a statement by R. Shemen b. Abba. A few lines later, it appears in a section that begins with a statement by R. Samuel b. Nahmani. When R. Samuel b. Isaac's statement is recorded in the first section, it is written in a way that clearly suggests that it was first made in a different context (. . . TO XDH . . . pmr "Q 7X1BW m 1BX7D). If the statement was orig- inally found in another context, we would need to see this original context to truly understand the state- ment. But the statement is not found anywhere else, and when the statement appears in the section that begins with R. Samuel b. Nahmani, it does not occur with a ke-de- 'amar or hakha nami. It has been suggested that the other context referred to was simply the section that begins with R. Samuel b. Nahmani. 323</page><page sequence="16">Mitchell First The interpretation of the term yom ha-kenisah is also removed from its plain sense. If M. Megillah 1:1-2 were referring to changing the reading to a fast day, the term we would expect it to use would be yom ha-ta 'anit. Moreover, M. Megil- lah 1:3 includes the following statement by R. Judah: When [may the reading be advanced]? In a place where they enter (makom she-nikhnasin) on Monday and Thursday. This strongly suggests that the term yom ha-kenisah at M. Megillah 1:1-2 refers to Mondays and Thursdays. Finally, an anonymous talmudic discussion at B. Megil- lah 4a-b understands yom ha-kenisah as a reference to Mondays and Thursdays, and states explicitly that yom ha-kenisah can occur on days such as the tenth or eleventh.61 The critical question is what motivated these three unusual interpretations. Obviously, one possible motivation was an attempt to justify an existing practice of fasting on the 13th. But in Part VI of this article, I will suggest something entirely different for the motivation behind these unusual interpretations. V. The Palestinian Custom of Fasting Three Days in Adar Three sources that document a Palestinian custom of fasting three days in Adar have come to light from the Cairo Genizah. One source is a siddur fragment recording a custom of fasting on the Monday-Thursday-Monday set in Adar 61. The severe difficulties with interpreting yom ha-kenisah as the 13th of Adar are noted by many authorities. See, e.g., R. Eliezer b. Joel ha-Levi, Sefer Ravyah, sec. 559; R. Isaiah Di Trani, TosafotRid, commentary to Megillah 2a; R. Naphtali Zevi Judah Berlin (Ha-'emekshe 'elah' commen- tary to the above passage in the She'iltot; and R. Hanokh Zundel b. Joseph, Ez Yosef Midrash Tanhuma, Bere 'shit, sec. 3. Nevertheless, the unusual interpretation of yom ha-kenisah is followed by some authorities. One who seems to follow it is the author of Sefer ha-mikzo 'ot (see above, Part VI), quoted by R. Isaac of Vienna. Also, R. Isaac himself, after quoting it in the name of the Sefer ha-mikzo 'ot and the She 'iltot, does not make any attempt to disagree. It is also perhaps followed by R. Tarn (see Appendix III). Perhaps the authors of the unusual interpretation of yom ha-kenisah had a text of the Talmud that did not include the above anonymous discussion at Megillah 4a-b. Perhaps they also did not have M. Megillah 1:3 as we have it. Note that the geonic responsum included in Midrash Tanhuma records the text of the question asked, and it can be argued that the questioner did not have R. Judah's statement at M. Megillah 1:3. Many authorities followed the unusual interpretation of zeman kehillah la-kol hiy. Some of the earliest to do so are: (I) Sefer ha-mikzo 'ot; (2) R. Tarn, quoted by the Rosh and many others (see Appen- dix III); (3) R. Isaac b. Abba Mari, Sefer ha-ittur, 220; and (4) R. Abraham b. Nathan ha-Yarhi, Ha-manhig, 1:244-45 (ed. Raphael). (Regarding the last source, the emendations suggested at 245, notes 95 and 96 are undoubtedly correct.) Interestingly, there exists a manuscript of Megillah 2a (NY-Columbia X 893 T141) in which R. Ahai and a summary of the interpretation attributed to him are included on the talmudic page. The statement included is: nv xim nrotf? ins xVi nrmsn DTirrn "frnpi 'iw wn W nVnp pr ivv mhw xnx y' 'td 324</page><page sequence="17">The Origin of Ta' anit Esther closest to the first of Nissan.62 Another source is a list of fast days that records that three days of fasting for Purim were observed in Adar, even though the specific days in Adar are not provided.63 The final source is a siddur fragment noting that three fast days are observed in Adar before Purim.64 Additionally, Massekhet soferim refers to a Palestinian custom of fasting on a Monday-Thursday-Monday set in Adar. Until recently, Massekhet soferim was viewed as a Palestinian compilation dating from the eighth century.65 Scholars have now begun to regard it as a work compiled outside of Palestine, in an area under Palestinian influence such as Italy or Byzantium.66 Moreover, the work was probably not completed until the ninth or tenth century, even though the material in the first nine of its twenty-one chapters is older.67 Its reliability with respect to Palestinian customs has also been called into question.68 Massekhet soferim includes the following passages in its seventeenth and twenty-first chapters: ^n-iw pop irrnrm ^m "warn ^w rmo n*7N "psm ]mx i^yntt "px mxn w nw1?^ .•pEPiptt fw jTUjniM Tnnxnw run VTnm69 -mp^ ^do omon w inx rmnrf? urn 62.

Massekhet soferim makes prolific usage of the Palestinian Talmud, but follows the Diaspora custom of a two-day festival (14:16, ed. Higger). Higger had viewed references in this work to customs of the Diaspora as later glosses by a Babylonian hand. 67. The Babylonian Geonim never refer to the material in chapters 10-21. Material from these chapters is not quoted anywhere until the eleventh century, in Ashkenaz. See Blank, 4 n. 10, and 1 8, and Higger, 36 and 58. 68.

The meaning of the phrase Nikanor ve-haveirav is subject to debate. Encyclopaedia Judaica 6:914 interprets it to mean Nicanor and his men. But Alter Hilvitz, Hikrey zemanim, vol. 1 (Jerusalem: Mossad Harav Kook, 1976), 373; and Tabory, Mo 'adeyyisra 'eil, 322, suggest that ve-haveirav means the holiday which Megillat ta 'anit lists for the 12th of Adar. Hilvitz goes further and suggests that the true reading may be ve-haveiro. (Higger's critical edition does not mention any such variant.) My friend Joshua Zakheim suggests that the meaning is "Nicanor, which is one of those Megillat ta 'anit holidays." The reference to Yom Nikanor here has engendered much discussion. One way to understand this passage is that it is implying that Yom Nikanor was still observed in Palestine at the time this passage was written. But the fact that almost all of the Palestinian Amoraim whose views are recorded express the view that Megillat ta 'anit was no longer in effect in their times (see above, n. 1 7, and especially the pas- sages in the Jerusalem Talmud) suggests that this interpretation is not correct. In light of recent 325</page><page sequence="18">Mitchell First The three fast days are not fasted consecutively but separately: Monday, Thursday, and Monday. The Sages of the land of Israel were accustomed to fast after the days of Purim70 because of Nikanor and his friends, and also because punishments are postponed and not advanced. *w cmD -iníòi nnra "ìnoxi "ona dix w mhw nuynrft myaziw irrnzn ama 71.icn tqspw iv tiox -nrxa dis slip1?. . . pn unm imx pjynö t»n naVi .nun "warn The custom of the Sages of the West is to fast the three fast days of Mordecai and Esther separately, and after Purim, on Monday, Thursday, and Monday. Why are they not observed in the month of Nissan? ... To call a public fast is forbidden until Nissan passes.72 It is almost certain that the Palestinian custom of fasting three days in Adar was established to commemorate the three days of fasting initiated by Esther. With regard to the antiquity of this custom, there is documentation showing that it was a practice among many Jews in Palestine in the tannaitic and amoraic scholarship that suggests a late date for chapters 10-21 of Massekhet soferim and authorship of these chapters outside of Palestine, it is probably a mistake to read much into the Yom Nikanor reference here. The author may have just been conjecturing about why the three days of fasting in Palestine were observed after Purim. The author goes on to provide an alternative explanation for the practice. There are sources that describe fast days that were observed in Palestine in the post-talmudic period. See, e.g., Sid Z. Leiman, "The Scroll of Fasts: The Ninth of Tebeth," Jewish Quarterly Review 14 (1983): 174-95; and more recently, Elizur, Lammah zamnu. The earliest such source (aside from a very fragmentary fifth- or sixth-century list inscribed on a synagogue wall) is a piyyut of R. Eleazar Kallir. This piyyut was first published by Fleischer in his "Compoziziyyot Kaliriyyiot le-tish'ah be-'Av," Hebrew Union College Annual 45 (1974): 21-23 (Hebrew section). Among the fast days included in this piyyut is the 10th of Nissan. Yet Megillat ta'anit forbids fasting from the 8th through the 2 1 st of Nissan. This suggests that Megillat ta 'anit was ho longer being observed in Pales- tine in the time of Kallir. Moreover, on several occasions in this piyyut, Kallir does not even give the date of the fast, only specifying the month and the event. This suggests that the fast days he included were well known and may have been observed for generations by his time. Fleischer estimates Kallir's life- span as 570-640 ce. See his ^Le-pitron she'elat zemano u-makom pe 'iluto shel R. Eleazar be-Rabbi Kallir" Tarbiz 54 (1985): 383-427. It remains unclear whether the fast days described by Kallir, and later by R. Phinehas b. Jacob ha-Kohen (eighth century) in his Kiddush yerahim, were observed by the majority of Palestinian Jewry, or only by a small segment of the community (perhaps by the leaders only). On this issue, see Elizur, Lammah zamnu, 25 and 230-32. 70. One can make an argument (especially if these chapters of Massekhet soferim date as late as the tenth century) that this language implies an alternative Babylonian custom of fasting before Purim, on the 13th. Scholars who make this argument include Samuel K. Loewenstamm, "Esther 9:29-32: The Genesis of a Late Addition," Hebrew Union College Annual 42 (1971): 123; Hilvitz, Hikrey zemanim, vol. 1, 354; Elizur, Lammah zamnu, 158 n. 40; and Fleischer, Seridim, 10. But if this passage was com- posed in a place such as Italy or Byzantium, one could understand the implication differently. The passage could be implying that the three fast days were observed before Purim in the locale of the author. 71. The printed text of Massekhet soferim reads differently: ICJ TOSH? IV tick TIT2D TOTH1?. 72. Massekhet soferim 17:3 and 21:1 (ed. Higger). Despite the last statement, it is possible that the custom to fast three days in Adar originated before there was any prohibition to fast in Nissan. The choice of Adar may have simply come from a desire to observe the fasts close to the time of Purim. 326</page><page sequence="19">The Origin of Ta'anit Esther periods to fast regularly on Monday and Thursday.73 The institution of a fast on a Monday-Thursday-Monday cycle in Adar would have been a natural extension of such a practice.74 Admittedly, however, there is no reference in either the Jerusalem or Babylonian Talmud to a Palestinian custom of fasting on a Monday-Thursday- Monday cycle in connection with Adar or Purim.75 VI. Approaches to the Origin of the Fast of the 13th One approach to the origin of the fast of the 13th of Adar ("the first approach") is to regard it as a post-talmudic custom designed to commemorate the three days of fasting initiated by Esther in Nissan.76 An early authority who seems to take this approach is Maimonides (1138-1204).77 Those who follow 73. The main sources for this practice are found in Gedalyahu Allon, "Li-yeshuvah shel bar aita 'ahatr Tarbiz 4 (1933): 285-91. Many of these are early Christian sources that refer to Jewish prac- tices. For example, the practice is probably alluded to at Luke 18:12 in a parable about a Pharisee who declares his righteousness by proclaiming: "I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I possess." (Allon cites more explicit Christian sources for the Jewish practice as well.) See also the variant of T. Ta'anit 2:5: yom sheni ve-hamishi yahid yoshev be-ta'anit zibbur, B. Ta'anit 12a: yahid she-kibeil 'alav sheni ve-hamishi kol ha-shanah kulah, and the references at Y. Ta'anit 1:6 (64c) and Y. Pesahim 4: 1 (30d) to a custom of women to refrain from work on Monday and Thursday 'ad de-yitfeni ta'anita (until the fast ends). For additional sources aside from the many collected by Allon, see Elizur, Lammah zamnu, 160. Even though numerous sources confirm the existence of such a practice, it was probably not the tradition of a majority of Palestinian Jewry but was likely a practice of pious individuals only. 74. See, e.g., Hilvitz, Hikrey zemanim, vol. 1, 372; and Tabory, Mo'adey yisra'eil, 405-406. 75. The Palestinian custom of fasting may also be alluded to in the Targum Rishon to Esther 9:31. This source includes the word "pTDi in its translation: finnici ÌTBTC ""mns ï&gt;TD7 ïirrintf?. Bernard Grossfeld, The First Targum to Esther (New York: Sepher-Hermon Press, 1983), 72, translates: "that they remember the matters of the fastings and their prayers." According to Grossfeld, this Targum was composed between 500 and 700 ce in the Galilee area. But the Monday-Thursday-Monday fast days in Adar are not included in the piyyut of Kallir (see above, n. 69). Nor are they included in the Kiddush yerahim of R. Phinehas b. Jacob ha-Kohen (eighth century). But their omission from these sources would not be surprising. The three Adar fast days did not occur on the same calendar date each year, and were not designed to commemorate a his- torical event that took place in the particular month, unlike the other fast days included in these sources. 76. This approach to the origin of the fast is accepted by many today, in part because it is called Ta 'anit Esther. But the earliest source that referred to the fast by a name is R. Natronai, and he called it Ta 'anit Purim. See the discussion below in this section. One can suggest alternatively that the fast on the 13th was a custom designed to commemorate the fasting by the Jews throughout the provinces (mentioned briefly at Esther 4:3). The difficulties raised with the first approach will apply to this suggestion as well. 77. To properly understand the view of Maimonides, one must first establish the correct text of Mishneh torah, hilkhot ta 'aniyyot 5:5. It turns out that an erroneous period and vav (the vav of a'*ai ) made their way into the standard printed text here, after the sixth word. (The necessary corrections have already been made in the Frankel edition. The corrected version also accords with the way the passage is quoted in Beit Yosef, OH 676.) As corrected, hilkhot ta 'aniyyot 5:5 reads: ...nnpyn Maimonides clearly states here that the custom of fasting on the 13th is only of recent origin, and that it 327</page><page sequence="20">Mitchell First this approach assume that those who started the custom chose to move the com- memoration from Nissan to Adar, perhaps because of a prohibition on fasting in Nissan, and chose to limit the fast to one day. The idea of commemorating these fasts may have been the Babylonian community's response to a possibly earlier Palestinian custom of commemorating them. More likely, the motivation may simply have been the Babylonian community's own desire to commemorate this set of effective fasts described in the Bible.7 In the first approach, one might view the geonic responsum included in Midrash Tanhuma as motivated by an attempt to justify an existing custom to fast on the 13th.79 One weakness with the first approach is that neither Talmud records a pro- hibition on fasting in Nissan.80 If the leaders of Babylonian Jewry in the early or middle geonic period wished to institute a commemoration of the fasts initiated by commemorates a fast from the time of Haman, i.e., in Nissan. Some have wondered why Maimonides refers to Esther 9:3 1 , a verse that includes the word zar 'am and can be interpreted to refer to a fast that was accepted for all generations. But the fact that Maimonides clearly states that the custom of fasting on the 13th is only of recent origin indicates that he does not accept this interpretation and is only refer- ring to 9:31 to show that there was fasting in the year of the threat. That he does not cite 4:3 suggests that he believes the fast commemorates the three days of fasting initiated by Esther, and not the fasting by the Jews throughout the provinces, even though he could have stated this more clearly. He is forced to cite chapter 9 because chapter 4 does not explicitly state that the Jews of Shushan fasted in response to Esther's request. Rashi (d. 1105) is reported to have stated that fasting on the 13th of Adar is only a minhaga be- 'alma she-nahagu ha- 'am, because Mordecai fasted at the time of Passover, for three days. (For the citation, see below, n. 139.) One can interpret Rashi to be rejecting any connection between the fast on the 13th of Adar and those observed in Nissan. But one can also interpret Rashi as believing that the fast of the 13th of Adar was meant to commemorate the fasts observed in Nissan. He was only explaining the differences to show that the fast on the 1 3th cannot be an obligation, only a custom. A thirteenth-century authority who follows the approach that fasting on the 13th of Adar is a post-talmudic custom designed to commemorate the three days of fasting initiated by Esther is R. Tze- dekiah b. Abraham Anav. See his Shibboley ha-leket, sec. 194. /o. Une tactor mat may nave motivated mis desire was verse v: ó i oí me dook or usiner: as they accepted upon themselves and zar 'am the matters of the fasts and their outcry." See Abraham P. Bloch, The Biblical and Historical Background of the Jewish Holy Days (New York: Ktav, 1978), 230. This verse cries out (pun intended!) to be interpreted on a secondary level as an instruction to the generations to fast, even though the plain sense of the verse is otherwise (see above, Part I). It was noted above (n. 8) that some interpreted Esther 9:31 to refer to the fast of the 13th. But this interpretation surely arose only after the practice of fasting on the 13th had already begun. 79. Throughout the discussion in Part VI, I will be discussing the geonic responsum included in Midrash Tanhuma and not discussing she 'Uta 79, because I believe the geonic responsum is the earlier of the two. Close analysis ofthat source is the key to understanding the origin of the fast. Everyone who has written about the origin of the fast until now has made the erroneous assumption that she 'Uta 79 was composed or edited by R. Ahai (middle of the eighth century), and then assumed that she 'Uta 79 was probably the earlier source. 80. Megillat ta 'anit would have prohibited fasting on the first twenty-one days of Nissan. But the holidays of Megillat ta 'anit were almost certainly no longer observed in Babylonia at the time the practice of fasting on the 13th of Adar commenced. 328</page><page sequence="21">The Origin of Ta'anit Esther Esther and wanted to limit the commemoration to one day, it does not seem that they were facing any prohibition to fast in Nissan.81 All that was necessary was for them to set up a commemorative fast on the 13th of Nissan.82 But admittedly, even without such a prohibition, the leaders of Babylonian Jewry may have decided it was more appropriate to observe the commemoration on a day adjacent to Purim.83 The more serious weakness with the first approach is that the idea that fasting on the 13th of Adar is a post-talmudic custom designed to commemorate the fasts initiated by Esther is not found in any of the geonic sources.84 8 1 . Admittedly a prohibition to observe a communal fast in Nissan is recorded in the twenty- first chapter of Massekhet soferim. But the tenth through twenty-first chapters of Massekhet soferim were probably composed only in the late geonic period, and not in geonic Babylonia. See Part V. I am not aware of any prohibition to fast in Nissan preceding the one found in the twenty-first chapter of Massekhet soferim. By the early geonic period, there seems to have already been a custom in the Academies not to recite tahanun in Nissan (and Tishrei). See Sefer sha 'arey teshuvah, ed. Yeruham Fishel (Leipzig: Leopold Shenois, 1858), responsum no. 243, attributed to R. Moses Gaon (early 9th cent). See also nos. 336 and 337, attributed to R. Hai. 82. It was mentioned earlier (above, n. 2) that rabbinic sources include two different traditions with regard to when the three days of fasting were observed in the year of the threat. The tradition that viewed the three days as the 13th, 14th, and 15th seems to have been the earlier one. There is no evi- dence that the other tradition even existed in the early and middle geonic periods. Although the custom of firstborns fasting on the 14th is mentioned in Massekhet soferim (21:1, ed. Higger), this practice is not recorded in the Babylonian Talmud nor in any Babylonian geonic sources. See Daniel Goldschmidt, " 'Al ta'anit bekhorot" De'ot 9 (1959): 3-5. In the Jeru- salem Talmud, there is no reference to a widespread custom of firstborns fasting on the 14th. Mention is made at Y. Pesahim 10:1 (37b) that R. Yehudah ha-Nasi fasted on the 14th, and one of the suggestions offered by an Amora to explain this practice is that R. Yehudah ha-Nasi was a firstborn. An alternative suggestion is offered to explain R. Yehudah ha-Nasi 's practice. Mention is also made of another firstborn Sage who did not fast on the 14th. R. Eliezer b. Isaac of Worms, Sefer ha-rokeah, sec. 270, writes that the custom of firstborns fasting on the 14th is men- tioned in a passage in Massekhet semahot. This tractate may date from the tannaitic period (Ency- clopaedia Judaica 14:1139). But no such passage is found in the present versions of Massekhet semahot. Even assuming that there was a custom of firstborns fasting on the 14th in geonic Baby- lonia, this would not likely have prevented the designation of the 1 3th of Adar as a fast day. These fast days are not full fast days, so adjacent fast days could have been observed. See, for example, the discussion below of the extended fasting that took place between Rosh Ha-shanah and Yom Kippur in parts of geonic Babylonia. 83. Also, the 13th was a significant day in its own right. It was the day originally planned for the destruction of the Jews by Haman (Esther 3:13), and was the first and main day of battle in the year of the threat. 84. Although there is perhaps one geonic source that refers to the fast as Ta 'anit Esther. This will be discussed below. It was noted above (n. 8) that an interpretation among the rishonim claims that the fast of the 13th is referred to in Esther 9:31. One might argue that R. Se 'adyah adopted this interpretation as well. This would be a geonic source that viewed the fast of the 13th as a commemora- tion of the fasts initiated by Esther (or of the fasts of Esther 4:3). But in this approach, the commemora- tion is not of post-talmudic origin, but a rabbinic obligation dating from the biblical period. Even if R. Se'adyah adopted this view, this interpretation surely arose only after the practice of fasting on the 13th had already begun. 329</page><page sequence="22">Mitchell First Rather, when the geonic sources express or imply an origin for the fast, these sources consistently express or imply that the fast is a rabbinic obligation dating from the biblical period. Specifically: • The geonic responsum included in Midrash Tanhuma uses the phrase ve-gazru ta 'anit to describe what occurred in the year of the threat, and describes the practice of fasting as a de-rabbanan. The import of these statements, taken together, is that in the year of the threat a decree was enacted that bound future generations.85 • R. Se'adyah, in his siddur, mentions the fast along with the four other rab- binic fasts from the biblical period, as if to say that the origin of this fast is found there as well. He writes, in a section on selihot: I would like to record ... 27 additional selihot: 1 1 of these for the Ninth of Av, 2 for the Seventeenth of Tammuz, 2 for the Third of Tishrei, 2 for the Tenth of Tevet, 3 for the Fast of the Megillah (jbxh* Dis), and 7 for an ordinary fast. . . ,86 Also, in its plainest sense, the term rfttrf?X U'l means the fast referred to in the Megillah.87 The argument that R. Se'adyah interpreted 9:31 to be referring to the fast of the 13th of Adar is based on a passage in the third of the three selihot that R. Se'adyah included in his siddur to be recited on this day: .anpyn maixn nai am-m1? imp p1? aronon nViwfr nViiu SRSG, 338. The last four words are a paraphrase of Esther 9:3 1 . The substitution of the word le-dorotam for zar 'am shows that the passage interprets Esther 9:3 1 to be referring to the acceptance on future gen- erations of the fasts mentioned in chapter 4. As this is apiyyut to be recited on the 13th, it seems reason- able at first glance to read it as expressing R. Se'adyah's explanation for the fast of the 13th. But Palestine was the source of much of the liturgical poetry found in Babylonian geonic literature. If this selihah was not composed by R. Se'adyah but merely incorporated by him, it very possibly had its origin in Palestine. If it was composed by R. Se'adyah, it very possibly was written in the first three decades of his life when he lived in Egypt, or during the years he lived in Palestine before he moved to Babylonia and composed his siddur there (see above, n. 24). If the selihah was composed in Palestine or Egypt, it would reflect an explanation for the Palestinian practice, not the Babylonian. The second of R. Se'adyah's selihot for the 13th of Adar begins tela 'ot be-yom zomi 'asaprah. One can argue based on these words that this selihah was composed in Babylonia, but this argument is weak. 85. Although these phrases are not found in she 'Uta 79, there is nothing in she 'Uta 79 to suggest that it takes a different approach. 86. SRSG, 319. That R. Se'adyah also refers to ordinary fast days here does not detract from the interpretation that he views the origin of the fast of the 13th as parallel to the origin of the four tra- ditional fast days. See also SRSG, 258. 87. And not the fast that commemorates fasts mentioned in the Megillah, which were observed in Nissan. It also seems unlikely that it would mean the fast that it was decided should be observed annually on the 13th in subsequent years, even though no such fast occurred in the year of the threat. (This is an argument against the claim that R. Se'adyah interpreted verse 9:31 to imply the Jews' acceptance of an obligation to fast annually on the 13th.) 330</page><page sequence="23">The Origin of Ta'anit Esther • An anonymous geonic responsum takes the position that, in a leap year, one fasts even on the 13th of Adar I.88 Most likely, it takes this position because it views fasting on the 13th of Adar as an obligation, based on the geonic interpretation of nikhalu. If it viewed the fast as a post-talmudic custom designed to commemorate fasting that took place in Nissan, a fast on the 13th of Adar II would almost certainly have been viewed as sufficient. • Sefer ha-mikzo of,89 a work of unknown authorship from the late geonic period, includes the statement that fasting on the 13th is an obligation ordained by ha-kadosh barukh hu. The passage reads: bwtow m imi90 -ws; rnzfttzn irrnra "us?1? ^k-w1?

Samuel b. R. Isaac said: the 13th is a day of gathering for all, as it is written "the Jews gathered themselves" (Esther 9:2). Why is it called yom kehillah, yom ta 'anit, yom kenisahl91 Because Israel gathers on this day, and engages in fasting, and requests mercy, as it is written "the matters of the fasts and their outcry" (Esther 9:31). The intent of the author is probably that the fast is an obligation based on a biblical verse (the Divine word) and that this obligation commenced in the biblical period. This is not the language of someone expressing the view that the fast is a post-talmudic custom. Finally, if one reviews all the Babylonian geonic references to the fast of the 13th of Adar, as collected in Parts III and IV, words such as nahagu, nohagin, or minhag are not used with reference to the fast.92 88. See above, Part III. 89. The original is lost; the work is only known from quotations in later sources. The statement above is from Or zaru'a, hilkhot megillah, sec. 367, in Or zaru'a ha-shalem: hilkhot mo'adim ve-zera 'im, ed. Avraham Marinberg (Jerusalem: Makhon torani yeshivat Or Ezion- Makhon Yerusha- layim, 2006). Sefer ha-mikzo 'ot (in the small portion of the work that is known) includes numerous responsa from the Babylonian Geonim. Simhah Assaf writes that it was probably composed in Baby- lonia or its environs, but also suggests authorship in Ashkenaz. The work is only quoted by sources from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and only in Ashkenaz. See Assaf, Tekufat ha-ge'onim ve-sifrutah (Jerusalem: Mossad Harav Kook, 1955), 207-209. 90. From de- 'amar until rahamim, the author is paraphrasing she 'Uta 79. The citation to Esther 9:31 (the last four words) is not from this or any she 'Uta. The citation to Esther 9:31 is only meant to show that the purpose of a fast day is for Israel to cry out for mercy. 91. The precise meaning here is unclear. There is perhaps a textual problem. 92. In contrast, the use of the words nahagu, nohagin, and minhag in connection with the fast are common among the rishonim. See, e.g., Rashi (below, n. 139); R. Isaac b. Abba Mari, Sefer ha-ittur, 220 (one view); R. Zerahiah b. Isaac ha-Levi, commentary to Rif, Megillah, end of first chapter; Mai- monides (above, n. 77); Nahmanides, commentary to Rif, Megillah, end of first chapter; R. Meshullam 331</page><page sequence="24">Mitchell First It can be argued that the name of the fast, Ta 'anit Esther, is consistent with the approach that the fast commemorates the fasts initiated by Esther. But if one looks at the names for the fast in the geonic period in Babylonia and its environs, R. Natronai calls the fast oniD Iran, R. Se'adyah calls it rfttö^X DIX, and Al-Biruni (a Muslim writing in the year 1000) calls the day "the fasting of Alburi" (Purim).93 b. Moses of Bezier, Sefer ha-hashlamah, commentary to Ta'anit, second chapter; Rosh, commentary to Megillah, sec. 8, and commentary to Ta'anit, sec. 24; R. Tzedekiah b.

Aside from those who interpret Esther 9:31 to imply the Jews' acceptance of an obligation to fast annually on the 1 3th of Adar (see above, n. 8), very few rishonim express the view that the fast is obligatory. One who does so is R. Hayyim, the son of R. Isaac of Vienna. R. Hayyim quotes from the Sefer ha-mikzo 'ot, quoting the first few words above that his father had quoted. See Or zaru 'a ha-shalem: hilkhot mo 'adim ve-zera 'im, 465. R. Isaac also presumably felt that the fast was an obligation from the biblical period, as he did not express any disagreement with the statement of the Sefer ha-mikzo 'ot. R. Abraham Ibn Ezra views the fast as an obligation from the Sages. See below, n. 13 1 . R. David Abudarham uses the word tiknuhu with regard to the fast, but states that this was by post-talmudic Sages. See below, n. 1 39. R. Abraham b. Isaac of Narbonne uses the words nitkan and kav 'u with regard to the fast (see below, n. 138), but implies that the fast was established sometime after Megillat ta 'anit was discon- tinued. Finally, see the view of R. Tarn discussed in Appendix III. Because of the numerous rishonim who viewed the fast as only a custom, R. Moses Isserles (OH 676) was comfortable writing ve-ta'anit zeh 'eino hovah. R. Caro had written only mit 'annin be-yod-gimmel be-Adar, without clarifying the nature of the obligation. Although R. Caro titles sec. 676: Din Ta 'anit Esther, he nowhere uses the term ta 'anit esther in 676(2), the subsection in which he dis- cusses the fast of the 1 3th. He only uses the term in 676(3), the subsection in which he describes the custom to fast three days: yesh mit'annim gimmelyamim zeikher le-ta 'anit Esther. It can be argued that he con- cluded (after collecting various opinions in his Beit Yosef) that fasting on the 13th was based on the deri- vation from nikhalu and was not a commemoration of the fasts initiated by Esther. See also OH 550(4) where he does not call the fast Ta 'anit Esther, but Zom Purim. But see Sperber, Minhagey yisra 'eil, vol. 1, 169 n. 1, for a different explanation for the use of this name for the fast. 93. See above, n. 3 1 . He was writing in Arabic, which lacks a letter for "p." It is clear from his Chronology of Ancient Nations that he had an extensive knowledge of the Jewish calendar and its holi- days. See Ratzaby, "Megillat 'ta 'anit zaddikim ' be-makor 'aravi," Sinai 106 (1990): 3. The Chronology of Ancient Nations was written by Al-Biruni in Jurian (an area southeast of the Caspian Sea), but he seems to have lived most of his life before this in Khwarizm (Greater Iran, now Uzbekistan). Early rishonim who refer to the fast as Ta'anit Esther include R. Abraham Ibn Ezra (1089- 1164), commentary to Esther 9:30 (this commentary was written in Italy, see Uriel Simon, Four Approaches to the Book of Psalms, 260 n. 18); R. Abraham b. David of Posquieres (c. 1125-1198), quoted by the Meiri, Magen 'avot, 154; and R. Eliezer b. Isaac of Worms (1165-1230), Sefer ha-rokeah, sec. 240. Many rishonim refer to the practice of fasting on the 13th of Adar without giving it a name. Also, one of the three texts of Megillat ta 'anit batra found in the Genizah refers to the fast as Ta'anit Esther. See above, n. 31. This text probably dates from the eleventh century. The Rosh refers to the fast as Ta 'anit Esther in his paraphrase of the view of R. Tarn. See Appendix III. But this does not mean that R. Tarn used the term himself. Massekhet soferim, which most likely dates from the ninth or tenth century, refers to the fast as sheloshet yemey zom Mordekhai ve-Esther. But this work was most likely composed in a community under Palestinian influence. See above, PartV. 332</page><page sequence="25">The Origin of Ta'anit Esther Only one Babylonian geonic source might conceivably have referred to the day as Ta 'anit Esther: the expanded version of Seder parshiyyot shel yamim tovim ve-haftarot shelahen.94 This source probably dates from the late ninth or early tenth century, and includes a shortened version of the responsum of R. Natronai that referred to the fast. There are only three manuscripts of the expanded version of Seder parshiyyot, none of which was actually copied in geonic Baby- lonia.95 Two of the manuscripts read "inoK rrjyn,96 while one reads oms rra?n.97 Since R. Natronai's original responsum called the fast Ta'anit Purim, it seems likely that the manuscript of Seder parshiyyot that reflects this reading has pre- served the original and that the other reading originated when a copyist altered the name to fit the name for the fast prevailing in his region.98 94. The earlier version of Seder parshiyyot is included as a section in Halakhot pesukot (and in the Hebrew adaptation of this work, Hilkhot reu). It is shorter, and does not include any version of R. Natronai's responsum. See Saliman Sassoon, ed., Sefer halakhot pesukot le-Rav Yehudai Gaon (Jeru- salem: Makor, 1971), 449-64. 1 am going to assume that the material in the expanded version was com- posed in Babylonia or its environs, although it is possible that this material was composed elsewhere, such as in North Africa. 95. The three manuscripts are Vatican 142, Milan (Ambrosiana CI 16 Sup.), and De Rossi 1089. The Vatican 142 manuscript is estimated to have been copied in North Africa in the eleventh century. See Elizur, Lammah zamnu, 45. Seder parshiyyot is included in this manuscript as a section in the Hala- khot gedolot. An edition of the Halakhot gedolot based on Vatican 142, and including the chapter Seder parshiyyot, was published by Azriel Hildesheimer at the end of the nineteenth century. (Most likely, the expanded version of Seder parshiyyot and other material were added to Halakhot gedolot in North Africa, at the end of the ninth or beginning of the tenth century. See Brody, Le-toledot, 136 n. 21.) The Milan (Ambrosiana CI 16 Sup.) manuscript was copied in Italy, c. 1400. Seder parshiyyot is also included in this manuscript as a section in the Halakhot gedolot. For a description of this manu- script, see Elizur, Lammah zamnu, 45. (A descendant of Hildesheimer published an edition of Halakhot gedolot based on this manuscript, but he did not include the Seder parshiyyot section.) The De Rossi 1089 manuscript was copied in Italy in the late thirteenth century. See Benjamin Richler, Hebrew Manuscripts in the Biblioteca Palatina in Parma (Jerusalem: Jewish National and University Library, 2001), 193. It was published by Chaim M. Horowitz in his Beit nekhot ha-halakhot o toratan shel rishonim (Frankfurt am Main: Slobotzky, 1881). Nahman Danzig refers to a Genizah frag- ment of the expanded version of Seder parshiyyot. See his Mavo le-sefer halakhot pesukot 'im tashlum halakhot pesukot (New York and Jerusalem: Beit ha-midrash la-rabbanim be- America, 1999), 299 n. 100. But I am not aware of any Genizah fragment of Seder parshiyyot that includes the shortened version of the responsum of R. Natronai. 96. Vatican 142 and De Rossi 1089. 97. Milan. 98. Seder parshiyyot is the kind of source that lent itself to being changed by copyists, who might conform the text to reflect the customs in their locale. See Danzig, Mavo, 189 n. 69. A change of name (without a change of a custom) would seem to be an even more likely occurrence. That the Palestinian custom was understood to commemorate the fasts initiated by Esther prob- ably caused the Jews in Palestine, Egypt, and North Africa to assume that this was the basis for the fast of the 13th as well and to call that fast Ta 'anit Esther. This would have influenced the North African copyist of Vatican 142 (or the earlier Palestinian, Egyptian or North African source he was copying from) to change Ta 'anit Purim to Ta 'anit Esther. With regard to the De Rossi manuscript, this manu- script was copied in Italy in the late thirteenth century. By that time, the term Ta 'anit Esther was prob- ably in use there. (R. Abraham Ibn Ezra used the term Ta 'anit Esther in his commentary to Esther 9:30, and this commentary was written in Italy. Also, the term Ta'anit Esther is found in sec. 194 of the 333</page><page sequence="26">Mitchell First As the first approach is not consistent with the statements about the fast that are found in the geonic sources, I would like to suggest another approach to the origin of the fast ("second approach"). This approach has not been suggested else- where." But it is largely consistent with what is found in the geonic sources, although it does raise some issues of its own. In this second approach, the custom to fast on the 13th arose as a result of the unusual interpretations expressed in the geonic responsum included in Midrash Tanhuma. As explained in Part IV, yom ha-kenisah in M. Megillah 1:1-2 was interpreted as a reference to the 13th of Adar as a fast day (the day on which Jews gather to fast). The statements in the ninth chapter of the book of Esther that the Jews gathered themselves ("frnpJ) on the 13 th of Adar were inter- preted as indicating that the Jews fasted on the 13th of Adar in the year of the threat. Finally, the statement of R. Samuel b. Isaac, *rn W7 rfrnp pî l"' was also interpreted as indicating that the Jews fasted on the 13 th of Adar in the year of the threat. A claim that the custom to fast on the 13th arose as a result of the above unusual interpretations is justifiable only if one can suggest a reason for the unusual interpretations other than to justify an already existing practice to fast that day. Such a reason can easily be suggested, based on a careful reading of the responsum included in Midrash Tanhuma and an understanding of the issues of halakha that were subject to major dispute in the geonic period. The responsum included in Midrash Tanhuma was from Babylonian geonim. It is reasonable to work with the assumption that it dates from the eighth or ninth century.100 Shibboley ha-leket of R. Tzedekiah b. Abraham Anav. R. Tzedekiah does not use the term himself, but quotes from Minhagot hakhmei Magenza, which used the term.) Also, the text of the De Rossi manu- script largely follows the text of Vatican 142. 99. It has been overlooked because those who analyzed the origin of the fast always assumed that she 'Uta 79 was the first explicit reference to fasting on the 1 3th. But the geonic responsum included in Midrash Tanhuma is probably earlier (see above, Part IV), and is the source that deserves the closer analysis. A key passage, nvmn tfixn raw «yro Tœi (honoring the Shabbat is more important than a thou- sand fasts), is found in the geonic responsum included in Midrash Tanhuma, and not in she 'Uta 79. 100. Midrash Tanhuma includes three passages from the She'iltot, an eighth-century source (one of which is at Bere 'shit, sec. 2, right next to our passage at sec. 3). See above, n. 32. Also, Midrash Tanhuma, Noah, sec. 3, has much in common with a section of the letter of Pirkoy ben Baboy, a source from the late eighth or early ninth century (see below, n. 103), and with a text that B. M. Lewin published and called a new version of this letter. According to Brody, this text published by Lewin is most probably an earlier polemical letter, not by Pirkoy, composed perhaps in the middle of the eighth century. See Lewin, "Mi-seridey ha-genizah," Tarbiz 2 (193 1): 394-96 and 400-403, Robert Brody, Pirkoy ben Baboy ve-toledot ha-pulemus ha-penim-yehudi (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Univ., 2003), 18-30, and Nahman Danzig, "Bein Erez-Yisra'eil le-Bavel: dappim hadashim mi-hibbur Pirkoy ben Baboy," Shalem 8 (2008): 5 n. 13. Midrash Tanhuma also includes a brief passage, at Noah, sec. 1, which reflects an anti-Karaite polemic. See Bregman, Sifrut tanhuma-yelammedenu, 185. This passage probably does not date from the eighth or early ninth centuries, but is later. Scholars have pointed to additional passages in Midrash Tanhuma that may date from the geonic period. But Bregman points out (280 n. 136) that such passages may not be reflected in the manuscripts and may only be later additions to particular versions. (See, for example, his comments 334</page><page sequence="27">The Origin of Ta'anit Esther As I will document shortly, a major issue of halakha in this period was the permis- sibility of fasting on Shabbat.101 The unusual interpretations can be explained if we assume that the authors were responding to and opposing widespread practices of fasting on Shabbat and Erev Shabbat in their time. Interpreting yom ha-kenisah the way they did enabled them to cite M. Megillah 1:1-2 as a source to prohibit fasting on those days. In their interpretation, the reading of the Megillah for the villagers is allowed to be advanced because the date of the observance of the fast day is being advanced. It is being advanced due to a prohibition to fast on Shabbat and Erev Shabbat that they were reading into the Mishnah. One clue that the authors were responding to existing practices of fasting on Shabbat and Erev Shabbat is that the responsum includes a polemical line stressing the importance of honoring the Shabbat: If the 14th falls on the first day of the week, it is forbidden to fast on Shabbat. It is also forbidden to fast on Erev Shabbat, because of the necessity of pre- paring for Shabbat. Rather, the fast is advanced to Thursday, which is the 11th of Adar. If the 14th falls on Shabbat, it is forbidden to fast on Erev Shabbat because of the necessity of preparing for Shabbat. The primary reason for a fast day is the recital of selihot and rahamim, and reciting these (instead of preparing for Shabbat) will detract from kavod Shabbat. Hon- oring the Shabbat is more important than a thousand fasts, for honoring the Shabbat is a commandment from the Torah, while the fast is a rabbinic decree. The Torah commandment of honoring the Shabbat takes precedence over the fast, a rabbinic decree... .102 In the eighth and ninth centuries, there was much discussion about the issue of fasting on Shabbat in the context of fasting on the Shabbat before Yom Kippur. One of the many Palestinian practices that the letter of Pirkoy ben Baboy103 criticized was on Midrash Tanhuma, Mezora, sec. 8.) This is in contrast to the passages mentioned above, which are recorded in the major textual witnesses to Midrash Tanhuma and are evidence of when and where the work was redacted. 101 . For a discussion of the issue of fasting on Shabbat throughout the centuries, see Yizhak D. Gilat, "Ta'anit be-Shabbat," Tarbiz 52 (1983): 1-15. 102. The fact that the responsum does not illustrate seven scenarios, but only the scenarios of the 14th falling on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, also suggests that the main motivation for its interpretations was related to Shabbat and Erev Shabbat. 103. This was a polemical letter written to the Jews of North Africa and Spain, instructing them that Palestinian customs should not be followed. Pirkoy, a Babylonian Jew, tells us that he was a dis- ciple of someone named Rava who was a disciple of R. Yehudai. (R. Yehudai was head of the academy at Sura from approximately 757-61 ce.) Pirkoy writes that many of the Palestinian customs originated as emergency measures during times of persecution, or were customs resulting from ignorance. It was only in Babylonia that accurate traditions were preserved. For further background to the letter, see Brody, The Geonim of Babylonia, 113-117, and more recently, Danzig, "Bein Erez-Yisra'eil le-Bavel," 1-32. 335</page><page sequence="28">Mitchell First their practice of fasting on Rosh Hashanah and the Shabbat before Yom Kippur.104 Those who followed this practice did so as part of a practice to fast for the entire ten days of repentance.105 Also, R. Yehudai Gaon106 is recorded to have opposed fasting on the Shabbat before Yom Kippur.107 He is also recorded to have opposed 104. "And because they fast on Yom Tov and on Shabbat and on the first two days of Rosh Ha-shanah and on the Shabbat between Rosh Ha-shanah and Yom Ha-kippurim." See Ozar ha-ge'onim, Yom Tov, 19, sec. 41. 105. Pirkoy does not indicate whether the Palestinian practice he was criticizing was the practice of the majority of Palestinian Jewry. A practice of yehidim (rabbinic scholars, see Ta'anit 10a) fasting for the entire ten days of repentance seems to be referred to at Leviticus rabbah 30:7: On the day preceding Rosh Ha-shanah, the leaders of the generation fast and the Holy One Blessed Be He releases (Israel) from one third of their sins. From Rosh Ha-shanah until Yom Ha-kippurim, the yehidim fast and the Holy One Blessed Be He releases (Israel) from one third of their sins. On Yom Ha-kippurim everyone fasts . . . Leviticus rabbah was probably composed in fifth-century Palestine {Encyclopaedia Judaica 1 1 : 147). A similar passage is found at Pesikta de-Rav Kahana, sec. 27. (In Pesikta de-Rav Kahana, most manu- scripts read ha-kesheirim instead of ha-yehidim. See ed. Mandelbaum, vol. 2, 412.) Pesikta de-Rav Kahana also probably dates to fifth-century Palestine. See Pesikta de-Rav Kahana, eds. William G. Braude and Israel J. Kapstein (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1975), intro., xlvi. (Parallels to the above passages are at Midrash Tanhuma, Emor, sec. 22; Kohelet rabbah 9:7; Midrash ha-gadol, Emor, 658; and Yalkut shimoni, Emor, sec. 651.) By the time of Pirkoy, the majority of Palestinian Jewry may have been following the practice of fasting for the entire ten days. Support for this might be found in the responsa at Ozar ha-ge'onim, Yom Tov, 24, sees. 47 and 48. Both of these record a practice of fasting for the entire ten days of repentance, and the practice does not seem to have been limited to rabbinic scholars. The authors of these responsa are unknown, but some have argued that they are from Palestine (see below, n. 109). (These responsa recommend that kol yisra'eil follow the practice of fasting the entire ten days.) Sec. 48 also quotes the passage referred to above from Leviticus Rabbah. In some versions of the responsum, the word beinonim is used instead of ha-yehidim. 106. R. Yehudai was a leading scholar at Pumbedita who eventually became head of the academy at Sura. He served in this position for three and a half years, approximately 757-61 ce. (Prob- ably these were the last years of his life.) The statements attributed to him could have been made while he was at Pumbedita, or while he was the head of the academy at Sura. During the period that he was head of the academy at Sura, his brother was the head of the academy at Pumbedita. 107. See Ozar ha-ge'onim, Yom Tov, 21, sec. 42. This is a section from Halakhot kezuvot, a work that seems to have been written in Italy in the ninth century. In this section, the issue of fasting on the Shabbat before Yom Kippur is discussed, and a decision opposing it is attributed to R. Yehudai. The section also includes statements such as: (1) whoever fasts on the Shabbat before Yom Kippur profanes the Shabbat and violates the commandments of zakhor and shamor and (2) the only time fasting on the Shabbat is allowed is on Yom Kippur and in the case of ta 'anit halom (and the allowance for a ta 'anit halom is defined very narrowly: only in a case where one dreams that the government has decreed against him and placed him in chains or prison). These statements may reflect the views of R. Yehudai, or may only reflect the views of the author. Danzig, Mavo, Al 5, suggests that the source for the statement in Halakhot kezuvot that R. Yehudai opposed fasting on the Shabbat before Yom Kippur and the statements of others that R. Yehudai opposed fasting on the first two days of Rosh Ha-shanah (see the note immediately below) was merely the letter of Pirkoy ben Baboy. 336</page><page sequence="29">The Origin of Ta'anit Esther fasting on the two days of Rosh Hashanah.108 It is possible that his statements were made in response to the Palestinian practice. But it is more likely that he was respond- ing to a Babylonian practice of fasting for the entire ten days of repentance.109 Another context where the issue of fasting on Shabbat arose was the context of a regular Shabbat. Pirkoy ben Baboy criticizes a Palestinian practice of fasting on a regular Shabbat.110 It is possible that he is referring to small numbers of individuals who fasted on Shabbat for exceptional reasons. But it seems more likely from the context that he is referring to larger numbers of Palestinian Jews fasting on Shabbat, probably as a form of repentance or piety.111 108. See Ozar ha-ge'onim, Yom Tov, 18, sec. 39. On the custom of fasting on Rosh Ha-shanah, see Ya'akov Gartner, "Ta'anit be-rosh ha-shanah" Ha-darom 36 (1973): 125-62. 109. There is no specific evidence that a custom to fast for the entire ten days of repentance existed in Babylonia as early as the eighth century. But R. Natronai (head of the academy at Sura, 857-65) approved fasting on the last nine days of the ten, and described it as an old custom. He first writes that one is not allowed to fast on the first day of Rosh Ha-shanah, but continues: irrnm uru "p^1? ruwn ma1» ^dö miroa V?n nw rrvmn irtzn¡? ira n^ rawai ted *?2r .Vim fa mvi vi rrara nm ivr1? wivmnr] But on the second day (of Rosh Ha-shanah) and on Shabbat, there is no problem (with fasting) because these ten days are different from the rest of the days of the year. There- fore, our early Masters were accustomed to engage in fasting on these days, whether on Shabbat or on a weekday. See Brody, Teshuvot Rav Natronai, 308-09, responsum 182; and Ozar ha-ge'onim, Yom Tov, 23, sec. 45. (In the version quoted by the Rosh, commentary to Rosh Ha-shanah, end of the fourth chapter, the responsum reads nohagin rabboteinu instead of nahagu rabboteinu ha-rishonim.) There is also a responsum that records that the custom bi-mekomeinu u-vi-yeshivot (in our locale and in the Acade- mies) is to fast all ten days. See Ozar ha-ge'onim, Yom Tov, 24, sec. 47. Weinberg, Teshuvot Rav Sar Shalom Ga 'on, 39, suggests that the responsum was written by R. Zemah b. Solomon (ninth century, Babylonia). (In Hemdah genuzah, sec. 129, it is included in a section of responsum attributed to a R. Zemah.) But this responsum may be Palestinian, and from a later time period. See Gartner, 126, and Lewin 's comments to sec. 48, which is a responsum similar to sec. 47. R. Sar Shalom, who was R. Natronai 's predecessor at Sura, is recorded by R. Eliezer b. Joel ha-Levi as having been opposed to fasting on Rosh Ha-shanah. See Sefer Ravyah, sec. 537. However, he may still have permitted fasting on the other nine days, in accordance with the custom mentioned by R. Natronai. R. Hai (head of the academy of Pumbedita, d. 1 038) is recorded as opposing fasting on the Shabbat before Yom Kippur, but allowing fasting on both days of Rosh Ha-shanah. See Ozar ha-ge 'onim, Yom Tov, 22, sec. 43. (In another source, he is recorded as opposing fasting on both days of Rosh Ha-shanah as well; ibid., 23, sec. 44.) The custom of fasting for the entire ten days of repentance continued in some locales in the time of the rishonim. See the articles by Gartner and Gilat referred to above. See also R. Moses Isserles, OH 581(2). 110. See above, n. 104. 111. The fasts of Megillat ta 'anit batra originated in Palestine, as did the practice of fasting on Monday and Thursday. Palestine was an area with a tendency toward asceticism. Pirkoy quotes a statement by a Palestinian Amora recorded at B. Berakhot 31b: ... rut? wvim *w in -in V? "py-iip rwn irayrn iwn *?d (Pirkoy only quotes up to dino). He implies that this statement served as a basis for the Palestinian prac- tice to fast on Shabbat.

Mehalaleha means one who does not treat it with delight but treats it as an ordinary day.112 Strikingly, Pirkoy uses almost the same language as the geonic responsum included in Midrash Tanhuma: 113.myn nettai rmanp h*?n anpaa inv inx naw airy Vi*m One who delights in one Shabbat is greater than one who sacrifices a thousand sacrifices and (fasts) a thousand fasts. The practices that the authors of the unusual interpretations could have been responding to could have been: (1) the practice in Babylonia of fasting on the Shabbat before Yom Kippur; (2) practices in Babylonia of fasting on Shabbat as a form of repentance or piety, or by those whose ideal Shabbat consisted of and death are at stake, such as the case of one who had a dream that the government decreed against him, and now fears for his life. Scholars have also noted the above statement by the Palestinian Amora at B. Berakhot 3 lb and suggested that it was the cause of, or evidence of, a Palestinian practice to fast on Shabbat in the amoraic period. See, e.g., Gilat, 6-7; and Gartner, 145. B. Shabbat 1 la includes a statement by R. Yosef permitting ta 'anit halom on Shabbat. There- fore, the Babylonian geonic tradition limited the statement at B. Berakhot 31b to ta 'anit halom. See, e.g., Ozar ha-ge'onim, Berakhot, ozar ha-peirushim, 44, sec. 135 (R. Hai). See also Ozar ha-ge'onim, Berakhot, nisfahim le-ozar ha-peirushim, 40, sec. 133; Tosafot Berakhot 31b; and Rashba, commentary to Berakhot 31b. (See also Solomon Buber, Midrash tehillim, intro., 69.) Mahzor Vitry, 234 (ed. Hurwitz), records that there is another version of the statement at Berakhot 3 lb. In this version, the statement explicitly refers to ta 'anit halom (kol ha-yosheiv be-ta 'anit halom be-Shabbat ... ). 1 1 2. Ozar ha-ge 'onim, Yom Tov, 1 9, sec. 4 1 . Halakhot kezuvot had also used strong language in opposing the practice of fasting on the Shabbat before Yom Kippur. See above, n. 107. But as men- tioned above, the words used may not have been those of R. Yehudai. 113. Ozar ha-ge 'onim, Yom Tov, 20, sec. 41. The similarity between this passage and the passage in the geonic responsum in Midrash Tanhuma was noted long ago by Jacob Mann when he first published this passage.

It was in the context of giving the reason for the prohibition to fast on Erev Shabbat that the responsum used its polemical language. Moreover, a variety of early sources already existed reflecting a prohibition to fast on Shabbat.116 A mishnaic source reflecting a prohibition to fast on Erev Shabbat would be new (outside of the limited context of 'anshei ma'amad)}11 In the second approach, I am suggesting that the unusual interpretations expressed in the geonic responsum arose out of one or more of these polemical motivations, leading M. Megillah 1 : 1-2 to be interpreted as implying a prohibition 114. B. Pesahim 68b records that Mar the son of Ravina fasted the whole year, aside from Shavu'ot, Purim, and Erev Yom Kippur. On the simplest level, this means that he fasted every Shabbat. Of the rishonim who accept the interpretation that he fasted on Shabbat (not all do), some understand its permissibility as based on his being occupied with prayer or study. See, e.g., the com- mentaries of R. Eliezer b. Joel ha-Levi, Sefer Ravyah, sec. 876; and R. David Bonafed (commentary to Pesahim 68b). Many others interpret his fasting on Shabbat as for a ta 'anit halom. Danzig suggests, based on a weak inference, that the author of the Halakhot gedolot (9th century) may have permitted fasting on Shabbat even outside the context of ta 'anit halom. See his Mavo, 119. One can make the same claim about the position of the Seder Rav 'Amram. See Seder Rav 'Amram Ga 'on, ed. Goldschmidt, 97, sec. 60. 1 15. As noted, the issue of fasting on Shabbat also came up in the context of ta 'anit halom. B. Shabbat Ila included a statement by R. Yosef permitting ta 'anit halom on Shabbat. It is possible that some in geonic Babylonia might have interpreted this permission broadly. (See perhaps she 'Uta 1, Bere shit, which seems to give permission to fast to one who merely sees a milta de-za'ara and has a halma bisha.) The authors of the geonic interpretation of M. Megillah 1 : 1-2 could have been respond- ing to this and implying that permission to fast on Shabbat in the case of ta 'anit halom should be severely circumscribed. This would be consistent with the views of Pirkoy and the author of Halakhot kezuvot, which both may reflect the view of R. Yehudai. The standard edition of the Tur includes a statement that R. Amram and R. Kalonymus held that ta 'anit halom is forbidden on Shabbat. But in the manuscripts of the Tur and the early printed editions, the statement is recorded in the name of R. Kalonymus only. See Tur, OH 568, Mosdot shirat Devorah edition (Tel Aviv: Deborah, 2000). 116. A prohibition ot tasting on snaooat is implied iainy cieariy m i. ia aim z:/. /'isu, m. Ta'anit 2:10 perhaps implies such a prohibition. M. Ta'anit 4:3 records that 'anshei ma' amad did not fast on Shabbat. B. Eruvin 41a includes an explicit statement by Ravina prohibiting such fasting. (Statements in the Jerusalem Talmud prohibiting fasting on Shabbat are quoted by Gilat, 1.) Nevertheless, an additional source for a prohibition to fast on Shabbat would have had some value. The other sources can be read as prohibiting fasting in certain contexts only, or as general prohibitions that allowed for the possibility of limited exceptions. Also, in rabbinic argumentation, it is natural to attempt to marshal as many sources as possible to support one's position. 117. Fasting on Erev Shabbat had long raised issues in halakha. See, e.g., M. Ta'anit 2:10 and 4:3, Tosefta Ta'anit 2:7 and 2:8, B. Eruvin 40b-41b, and she'ilta, Bere'shit, 1. M. Ta'anit 4:3 records that y anshei ma 'amad did not fast on Erev Shabbat out oikavod Shabbat, but the prevailing view in mishnaic and talmudic times (and the view of the above she'ilta) was that it was permissible to fast on Erev Shabbat. The only issue concerned the time of the end of such a fast. The geonic responsum, in interpreting M. Megillah 1 : 1-2 to prohibit fasting on Erev Shabbat, would be advocating a new, more stringent approach. 339</page><page sequence="32">Mitchell First to fast on Shabbat and Erev Shabbat. A new "tradition" about an ancient fast on the 13th of Adar was the result. The unusual interpretations of nikhalu at Esther 9:1-2 and/or 9:16-17, and of the statement of R. Samuel b. Isaac, are just ancillary; they are merely attempts to support the claim that a fast was observed on the 13th in the year of the threat, so that yom ha-kenisah in M. Megillah 1:1-2 might refer to a fast day on the 13th. The authors of the unusual interpretations were not motivated by an attempt to justify an existing custom to fast on the 13th, as there was no such custom. Although the second approach is consistent with the geonic statements about the fast of the 13 th of Adar,118 it does have some weaknesses. The first weakness is that if the fast originated in the manner suggested, one should perhaps only find evi- dence for the fast in areas that prohibited fasting on Shabbat (except in cases of ta 'anit halom).119 However, R. Natronai refers to the fast with seeming approval,120 and at the same time permits fasting on the Shabbat before Yom Kippur.121 One might respond that after the interpretation of M. Megillah 1 : 1-2 arose, and the practice of fasting on the 1 3 th commenced based on this interpretation, the under- lying motivations that gave rise to the interpretation may no longer have mattered. An alternative response is that R. Natronai may have been aware of and in essential agreement with the motivations behind the geonic interpretation of M. Megillah 1 : 1- 2. However, he might have believed that the policy of prohibiting fasting on Shabbat was entirely inapplicable to the Shabbat before Yom Kippur. In his responsum that permitted fasting on the Shabbat before Yom Kippur, R. Natronai stated clearly that the ten days of repentance were different from the rest of the year.122 A second weakness is that the language of the geonic responsum in Midrash Tanhuma might be read as describing a practice of fasting on the 13th in its time. But this is not the simplest reading of the responsum, which seems only to offer an 1 1 8. It also provides an answer to the question discussed in Appendix II: If Purim was one of the two holidays of Megillat ta 'anit that were never discontinued, and there was a prohibition to fast on the day before it, how could a fast on the 13th ever have arisen? The second approach has an easy answer. In describing what occurred in the year of the threat, the geonic responsum included in Midrash Tanhuma included the phrase ve-gazm ta 'anit, and in describing the fast, called it a de-rabbanan. Taken together, these passages imply that the geonic interpretation took the position that in the year of the threat a decree was enacted that bound future generations. If the practice to fast on the 13th arose as a result of this interpretation, the practice would have easily overridden any possible prohibi- tion to fast. The practice would have been viewed as the resumption of an ancient obligation, based on a biblical verse. A few sources allude to this answer. See, e.g., Rosh, commentary to Ta'anit, sec. 24, and Tur, OH 686. (As to the effect of Megillat ta 'anit on this ancient fast, perhaps it was thought that the fast was suspended during the centuries that Megillat ta 'anit was in effect.) But there are several other easy answers to the question raised in Appendix II (see particularly answers 1 , 2, and 3). Therefore, one cannot point to the fact that the question is easily answered in the second approach as evidence that it is the correct approach. 119. Based on B. Shabbat Ila, the Babylonian Geonim were in agreement that some type of fasting for ta 'anit halom on Shabbat had to be permitted. 120. See above, Part III. 121. See above, n. 109. 122. Ibid. 340</page><page sequence="33">The Origin of Ta'anit Esther interpretation of M. Megillah 1:1-2, the ninth chapter of the book of Esther, and the statement of R. Samuel b. Isaac.123 The most serious weakness is the argument that geonim would unlikely have polemically interpreted a Mishnah to such an extent that their interpretation would result in the observance of a new (assumed to be ancient) fast day. A response is that the authors of the interpretation may have convinced themselves of the truth of their interpretation. Far more difficult mishnaic interpretations than this were adopted by Amoraim throughout the Talmud. Although the interpretation was not a plain-sense interpretation of nikhalu in the book of Esther, it was plain sense enough as an interpretation of yom ha-kenisah124 and M. Megillah l:l-2.125 It was also plain sense enough as an interpretation of R. Samuel b. Isaac's statement. An alternative response is that those who composed the interpretation did not foresee that a new fast day would later be observed as a result of their words, even though the terms ve-gazru ta 'anit and ta 'anit de-rabbanan, taken together, imply that a decree was enacted in the year of the threat, and was binding for fiiture generations. A third response is that the interpretation may have initially arisen orally, without all the elements and terms later included in the written responsum. The authors of the original version of the interpretation did not foresee how it would eventually develop and imply that a decree was enacted in the year of the threat, and was binding for future generations. • • • If one believes that there was a preexisting practice to fast on the 13 th which the geonic interpretation of M. Megillah 1:1-2 was trying to justify, then a third 123. But admittedly, it does use the phrase ve-gazru ta 'anit to describe what occurred in the year of the threat, and describes the practice of fasting as a de-rabbanan. The import of these statements is that in the year of the threat a decree was enacted that was binding on future generations. In this way, the responsum does imply that there at least should have been a practice to fast on the 1 3th in its time. If one wants to read the responsum as implying not only that there should have been, but that there actually was a practice of fasting on the 13th in its time, a response could be that the interpretation originated earlier, before the responsum was reduced to writing. By the time the responsum was reduced to writing, the practices it implied were already in existence as a result of the oral interpretation. This would also be a response to any evidence that the written responsum included in Midrash Tanhuma dates from after the time of R. Natronai. 124. The root DJD appears in the context of Esther's command to the Jews of Shushan to fast (in Nissan). She instructs Mordecai: "Go, gather (0133) all the Jews found in Shushan, and fast for me ... (Esther 4: 1 6). This helps support the interpretation of yom ha-kenisah as a fast day. I would like to thank Rabbi Richard Wolpoe for this observation. 125. Also, perhaps the authors of the unusual interpretations had a text of the Talmud that did not include the anonymous (late?) discussion at Megillah 4a-b which understood yom ha-kenisah as Mondays and Thursdays, and perhaps they did not have M. Megillah 1 :3 as we have it. (The statement of R. Judah at M. Megillah 1:3 strongly suggests that the term yom ha-kenisah at 1:1-2 refers to Mondays and Thursdays, but does not absolutely mandate this interpretation.) 341</page><page sequence="34">Mitchell First approach to the origin of the fast might be suggested.126 In this approach, the fast originated as a custom.127 But once the above geonic interpretation became wide- spread, the original reason for the fast and its true period of origin were forgotten, and the fast came to be treated as a rabbinic obligation from the biblical period.128 The most reasonable explanations for the origin of a custom to fast on the 13th of Adar would be: (1) a desire to commemorate the three days of fasting initiated by Esther;129 (2) a desire to commemorate the fasts throughout the pro- vinces referred to at Esther 4:3; (3) a desire to commemorate the 13th of Adar as the day originally planned for the destruction of the Jews by Haman;130 and (4) a desire to commemorate the 13th of Adar as a traumatic day in the year of the threat, the first and main day of the battle.131 126. In this approach, one can still accept the suggestion that the authors of the unusual interpretations were motivated by opposition to practices of fasting on Shabbat and Erev Shabbat that were widespread in their time. One can believe that the motivation behind the unusual interpret- ations was twofold: opposition to practices of fasting on Shabbat and Erev Shabbat, and a desire to justify a preexisting custom to fast on the 13th. 127. One can alternatively suggest that it began as an enactment from the geonic period, without a claim by the geonim that it had ancient origins. 128. One can also suggest that the fast came to be treated as a rabbinic obligation from the bib- lical period based on the interpretation of 9:3 1 that eventually arose, if this interpretation arose as early as the geonic period. It can be argued that there is evidence for this interpretation in R. Se'adyah. See above, n. 84. 129. This explanation was already discussed at length (the first approach). 130. See Esther 3:13. The only source in the period of the geonim that perhaps alludes to this approach is &amp; piyyut composed by a Syrian paytan from the first half of the eleventh century, Yanon b. Zemah. This piyyut (based on the fasts of Megillat ta 'anit batra) includes one line regarding the 13th of Adar: .DTirrn *?d nx 73*òi mrfr vmrb pn my in -iizro nu^ra On its 13th day, Haman arose to destroy, kill and annihilate all the Jews. See Menahem Zulay, "Shivrey zelilim" Sinai 28 (1950-51): 167-69; and Elizur, Lammah zamnu, 95. But the Jewish community of Syria is usually considered to have been within the ambit of the Jewish community of Palestine. Thus, I am hesitant to rely on a paytan from Syria to help explain the origin of a custom that originated in Babylonia. It is also very possible that the line in this piyyut has nothing to do with the suggestion I made in the text. The term 'amad Haman suggests that the author of the piyyut believed that Haman was still alive on the 1 3th of Adar and still trying to destroy the Jews. See similarly some of the later versions oí Megillat ta 'anit batra quoted by Elizur at 1 59 n. 42 (p-9, n-5, p-18) and her reference to Sefer ha-tadir. 131. Even though the Jews had by now been given the right to fight and destroy their enemies (Esther 8:11-13), and were being assisted by the governors of the provinces and were feared by the masses (Esther 8:17, 9:2 and 9:3), the 13th of Adar must still have been a traumatic day. R. Abraham Ibn Ezra writes (commentary to Esther 9:30): nv rmynn wnp Vi irftDn Tiin "»D^i "mon (in my opinion, the Sages established this fast on the day of fear.) Probably he is adopting this approach. In the second recension of his commentary to Esther, Ibn Ezra writes very simi- larly: 7non UV2 ms/nn upn V'T D'TDDm. He adds that perhaps there was a tradition that the Jews fasted on the 13th in the year of the threat. See Joseph Zedner, Va-yosef Avraham (London: D. Nutt, 1850), 34. Uriel Simon, Four Approaches to the Book of Psalms (Albany: SUN Y Press, 1991), 154, refers to a manuscript with a third commentary on Esther by Ibn Ezra. I have not seen this manuscript. 342</page><page sequence="35">The Origin of Ta'anit Esther But if there was an earlier custom to fast on the 13th that the geonic respon- sum was trying to justify, it can be argued that the fast on the 1 3th would have been more widespread than is reflected in the sources. The custom is not included in the Halakhot gedolot, and its inclusion in Seder Rav 'Amram probably dates only from the time of the rishonim.132 This suggests that the custom originated at a later stage, and seems more consistent with the approach that it started as a con- sequence of the geonic interpretation expressed in Midrash Tanhuma ("second approach"), and not before it.133 Finally, several interesting explanations for the origin of the fast that have been suggested over the centuries deserve mention: • A fast was set up on the 13th, the day immediately before the holiday, to remind us that God answers the prayers of those who turn to Him, just as He answered the prayers of the Jews that year, when they fasted for three days in Nissan.134 • The 13th was a day of fighting in the year of the threat, whereas the next day the Jews were victorious and rested. The commemorative fast and holiday were enacted at the same time to model the fact that the Jews went from distress to salvation that year.135 • The Jews fasted on the 13th in the year of the threat, and it would not be proper to accept the joyous events of the year of Purim without also accepting the difficult events.136 Worth mentioning is the explanation for the origin of the fast set forth in Siddur kol Ya'akov/The Complete ArtScroll Siddur, 855 (italics are mine): It is di foregone conclusion that our ancestors fasted on that day [the 13th of Adar in the year of the threat], because the Jewish people never went to war without fasting and repenting in order to be worthy of God's assistance. 132. See above, n. 31. 133. The earliest dateable reference to the fast of the 13th is found in a responsum of R. Natro- nai. It was mentioned earlier (above, n. 23) that R. Sar Shalom, R. Natronai's predecessor at Sura, wrote a responsum very similar to the one by R. Natronai, except that it included no reference to the fast. This might suggest that there was no practice of fasting on the 13th at the time of R. Sar Shalom. A less drastic interpretation is that the difference between the two responsa helps define the period when the practice of fasting on the 13th began to spread. One might point to the lack of a reference to the fast in the Halakhot gedolot (a work compiled around the middle of, or perhaps the early, ninth century) as evidence that there was no practice to fast in Babylonia then. But this argument is weak. Halakhot gedolot may have been compiled outside of Babylonia (see Brody, The Geonim of Babylonia, 228) or perhaps inside Babylonia but outside of the Babylonian yeshivot, where the fast may have first arisen. 134.

By fasting on the 13th, Jews show that when we drink wine the next day, it is only as part of our divine service, and not to satisfy our own urges. 137 • A fast on the 13th was established to make sure that people come eagerly to hear the Megillah reading on the night of the 14th. VII. Summary and Conclusions The practice of fasting on the 13th of Adar originated in geonic Babylo- nia.139 The responsum of R. Natronai is the earliest Babylonian geonic source 137. Maggid mesharim, pars hat va-yakheil. This suggestion of the Maggia, mesharim is quoted in the Kafha-hayyim, OH 686. The Maggid mesharim also suggests this as the reason for the custom of the firstborn and others who fast on the day before Passover. The Maggid mesharim was composed by R. Joseph Caro {Encyclopaedia Judaica 5:200). 138. R. Abraham b. Isaac of Narbonne, Sefer ha-eshkol, vol. 1, 137: .n1?^ xipa [D7ip ] bvtf? *òw msrn isnp ~'y&amp; nVaa x-ipa snnw1? it-it vtpw hd ìòx rrann ht îpru íò Finally, an interesting suggestion made by Daniel Sperber, in the Journal for the Study of Judaism 16 (1985): 280-8 1 , also deserves mention. (He repeated the suggestion with minor variations in Minhagey yisra 'eil, vol. 1, 176-77.) Sperber suggested that when the statement of R. Samuel b. Isaac is quoted at B. Megillah 2a, only a portion of the original statement is being quoted. He suggested that what follows the statement of R. Samuel b. Isaac in she 'Uta 79, a citation to a verse and the phrase ms/n DV rtrnp "»xa, were also part of the original statement. Sperber noted that when this statement was first recorded at B. Megillah 2a, it is recorded with the following language: ke-de- 'amarRav Shemuel bar Yizhak . . . hakha nami . . ., suggesting that the statement was initially made in another context, and allowing for the possi- bility that B. Megillah 2a was not quoting the full statement. R. Samuel b. Isaac was a Babylonian Amora of the late third and early fourth centuries ce. If the full statement of R. Samuel b. Isaac were as Sperber hypothesized, this would be evidence that the fast was kept in Babylonia as early as his time, or would be a statement by an Amora which could have motivated people to start fasting on the 13th. (Sperber suggests only the former. I am adding the latter.) But the practice of fasting on the 13th is not included in the Halakhot gedolot, and its inclusion in Seder Rav 'Amram is only from the time of the rishonim. This suggests that the practice did not exist as early as the third or fourth century. It also suggests that it did not arise in response to a statement by a third- or fourth- century Amora, but arose later. Also, the full statement of R. Samuel b. Isaac quoted in the Talmud is ""Q-i1? t»-ix «Vi XTi tt rr&gt;n¡? pT r' There are different readings in the manuscripts with regard to the last three words (see above, n. 59), but the second part of the statement is there in some form in all but one manuscript. If the statement of R. Samuel b. Isaac had a second half, one cannot read she 'Uta 79, which does not have any statement beginning with ve-lo zarikh, as the full statement of R. Samuel b. Isaac. The same problem exists if one attempts to claim that the geonic responsum included in Midrash Tanhuma records the full statement of R. Samuel b. Isaac. Rather, both the geonic responsum in Midrash Tanhuma and she 'Uta 79 offer an interpretation that has expanded upon the original statement of R. Samuel b. Isaac. 139. That the fast is geonic or post-talmudic in origin has been set forth explicitly by several of the rishonim. See, e.g., (1) Haggahot maimuniyyot, hilkhot ta 'aniyyot 1:6: mi-divrey ha-Ge'onim; and (2) R. David Abudarham, Sefer Abudar ham, 282: ha-hakhamim ha-'aharonim tiknuhu 'ahar hatimat ha-talmud. See also the statement of Maimonides quoted above, n. 77 (ve-nahagu kol yisra 'eil bi-zemanim 'eilu ...). Also, Rashi implies that the fast is post-talmudic. In a responsum quoted in Mahzor Vitry, he writes that this fast is not from the Torah or from divrey Soferim, but is a minhaga be- 'alma she-nahagu ha- 'am. See Mahzor Vitry, ed.

Of the four sources in the geonic period from Babylonia and its environs that refer to the fast by a name, most likely none of them calls it Ta 'anit Esther}*0 When the geonic sources express or imply something about the origin of the fast, they consistently state or imply that the fast is a rabbinic obligation dating from the biblical period. The approach most consistent with the geonic sources is that the fast arose as a consequence of an interpretation of M. Megillah 1:1-2 ("second approach"). It has been suggested that the authors of the interpretation were responding to and opposing widespread practices of fasting on Shabbat and Erev Shabbat. This led them to interpret M. Megillah 1 : 1-2 to imply a prohibi- tion of fasting on Shabbat and Erev Shabbat. The result was a new "tradition" about an ancient fast on the 13th of Adar. There had not been a practice of fasting on the 13th at the time the geonic interpretation of M. Megillah 1:1-2 originated. Finally, we have documented four sources that refer to a Palestinian custom of fasting for three days in Adar. This custom almost certainly was a commemora- tion of the three days of fasting initiated by Esther. Mitchell First Teaneck, New Jersey ha-poskim, 2004), 372. (See similarly, Mahzor Vitry, ed. Hurwitz, 210.) This responsum of Rashi's is quoted elsewhere in Rashi literature at Siddur Rashi, sec. 345; Sefer ha-pardes, sec. 204; and Teshuvot RashU sec. 128. It is also included in Beit Yosef, OH 686. R. Caro's source for it was Shibboley ha-leket, sec. 194. Many rishonim use words such as nahagu, nogahin, and minhag when describing this fast. See above, n. 92. These words often imply post-talmudic origin. But most of the rishonim who used these words probably believed that Megillat ta 'anit was cancelled prior to the conclusion of the amoraic period. There would have been room, in their view, for a custom of fasting on the 13th to have arisen during the talmudic period. One interesting reference cited in n. 92 is Nahmanides. He writes that there was no fasting on the 13th in the days of rabboteinu, because it was Yom Nikanor. He does not specify whether by the term rabboteinu he means the entire amoraic period or only part of it. 140. See above, Part VI (the possible exception being Seder pars hiyyot, where a question exists about whether the original reading is Ta 'anit Esther or Ta 'anit Purim). The earliest undisputed refer- ences to the fast as Ta'anit Esther are: (1) manuscript Vatican 142 of Seder parshiyyot, estimated to be from North Africa in the eleventh century; (2) a text of Megillat ta 'anit batra found in the Genizah, which probably dates from the eleventh century (see above, n. 31); and (3) the commentary to Esther 9:30 of R. Abraham Ibn Ezra (which was composed in Italy). As suggested in Part VI (n. 98), the name Ta'anit Esther for the fast of the 13th may have originated in Palestine, Egypt, or North Africa, influenced by the Palestinian custom of three days of fasting, which did commemorate the fasts initiated by Esther. Also, if the true origin of the fast lies in the second approach, an approach based on unusual interpretations of nikhalu andyom ha-kenisah, it is not surprising that an alternative "folk" understanding of the origin of the fast eventually arose. The name Ta 'anit Esther would be the result of this folk understanding. 345</page><page sequence="38">Mitchell First Appendix I: She'ilta 79 The following is the text of she Hita 79, taken from the Venice edition of 1546:141 t?m nxn ivy warm -itzw nymxn xrôna x^a np^a1? nw rrn "»ttioï xn^xw "iwy ni73"iK pv nx D^w niran nsn P'wrn DTisn PTirrn p ^y xip laxi xm iax iip*»1? x1?

This was the first printed edition. Mirsky prepared an edition of the She'iltot utilizing nine relatively complete European manu- scripts (eight of which include our passage). See his She'iltot de-Rav Ahai Ga'on, 5 volumes (1960- 77). I will mention some of the variants he noted. Mirsky made very little use of the Genizah material. (He intended to devote a separate volume to the Genizah material, but died before he was able to do so.) Dozens of Genizah fragments have been discovered. Of the limited Genizah material that has been pub- lished or described to date, the only fragment of she 'Uta 79 that I am aware of is the one described by Shraga Abramson mentioned below. 142. The text I printed is citing 9: 16-17 here, except that it skips the last twelve words of verse 1 6 after nafsham, and continues with the first five words of verse 1 7. In the case of the four manuscripts that cite to 9: 1 6-1 7 here, they skip the last fifteen words of verse 1 6, and include the first eight words of verse 17. (Mirsky's notes indicate that these four also include the word gam at the beginning of verse 17. But there is no such word at the beginning of verse 17.) 143. Six of the eight manuscripts read ncnan. Two of the manuscripts read no::&gt;n. Mirsky notes (vol. 3, 223) that four of the eight manuscripts include the additional words nv "•warn tip after the phrase ncHDn nv ""KQi. These additional words would make the definition of yom ha-kenisah more consistent with the Mishnah and Talmud. However, this she 'Uta repeats its interpret- ation of yom ha-kenisah later, and Mirsky does not note any such variants there. Moreover, the Genizah fragment referred to by Abramson seems to be consistent with the present text there; see below, n. 147. There is no question that this she 'Uta defined yom ha-kenisah in the way that it did, as the geonic responsum included in Midrash Tanhuma takes the same approach. Moreover, this she'ilta and its unusual definition of yom ha-kenisah are cited by many rishonim (whether they agree or disagree). Also, none of the manuscripts used by Mirsky come from earlier than the fourteenth century. Surely, the additional words in the four manuscripts noted by Mirsky originate with an addition by a copyist attempting to bring at least one of the statements in this she 'Uta in line with the traditional understanding of yom ha-kenisah. (These same four manuscripts also include a passage stating that when the fast falls on Shabbat, the villages and cities advance the reading to yom ha-kenisah.

In the case of such holidays, the Mishnah in M. Ta'anit 2:8 instructs that a prohibition existed to fast on the day before the holiday as well. This was accord- ing to the view of the tanna kamma, and according to the other view recorded in the Mishnah, that of R. Yose.149 The Talmud records a third tannaitic view, that of R. Simeon b. Gamliel, who took the position that there were no prohibitions on days surrounding Megillat ta 'anit holidays. The Talmud (Ta'anit 18a) records tra- ditions in the name of Rav and R. Yohanan that the halakha follows R. Yose, and in the name of Samuel that the halakha follows R. Simeon b. Gamliel. In such a case, the halakha would normally follow Rav and R. Yohanan.150 All agree that Purim survived the discontinuance oí Megillat ta'anit. If there was a prohibition to fast on the day before Purim, we need to explain how a fast on the 13th of Adar could ever have arisen.151 An answer was suggested in Part VI. If the fast arose as a consequence of the geonic interpretation recorded in Midrash Tanhuma, the fast would have been viewed as a resumption of an ancient obligation to fast on the 13th, based on a biblical verse. This would have easily overridden any possible prohibition to fast.152 But most of the rishonim give other answers to the question. The main responses are as follows:153 149. The disagreement between them was that R. Yose held that fasting on the day following such a holiday was prohibited as well. 150. In disputes between Rav and Samuel, the halakha follows Rav in the case of prohibitions. (It follows Samuel in monetary matters.) See B. Bekhorot 49b, B. Niddah 24b, and Yad Mal'akhi, sees. 147-51. In disputes between R. Yohanan and Samuel, the halakha follows R. Yohanan. See B. Eruvin 47b and Yad Mai 'akhi, sec. 616. 151. Of course, for those who believed that the fast of the 1 3th was referred to at 9:3 1 , this ques- tion did not arise. 152. See above, n. 118. As stated there, some rishonim allude to such an approach. 153. See, e.g., R. Zerahiah ha-Levi, commentary on Rif, Megillah, end of first chapter; R. Isaac b. Abba Mari, Sefer ha-ittur, 220-21; R. Abraham b. Isaac of Narbonne, Sefer ha-eshkol, vol. 1, 136- 37; R. Eliezer b. Joel ha-Levi, Sefer Ravyah, sees. 550 and 559; Tosafot Ta'anit 18a, Nahmanides, com- mentary on Rif, Megillah, end of first chapter; Ran, commentary on Rif, Ta'anit 6b-7a (in the pages of 348</page><page sequence="41">The Origin of Ta'anit Esther 1 . Even though Purim and Hanukkah themselves survived the discontinu- ance of Megillat ta 'anit, the prohibitions regarding surrounding days ended with the discontinuance of Megillat ta'anit.1 4 2. As stated explicitly in both Talmuds, the prohibitions regarding sur- rounding days were meant to strengthen the observance of rabbinic holi- days. Although included in the list of Megillat ta'anit holidays, Purim differed in that it was a holiday of biblical origin. The prohibitions regarding surrounding days were never applicable to this day. 3. Once it was decided that the observance of Yom Nikanor was to be can- celled and that the 13th of Adar should no longer be a holiday, it would have made little sense to invoke a new prohibition merely because the day happened to be the day before another holiday.155 4. The prohibitions regarding fasting on surrounding days of Megillat ta 'anit holidays only applied to fasts observed out of distress. The fast on the 13th of Adar celebrates miraculous deliverance, and is a fast of joy- A few rishonim take the approach that the halakha follows R. Simeon b. Gamliel.156 Rif), Tur, OH 686; R. Aharon ha-Kohen of Lunel, Orhot hayyim, hilkhot megillah u-Purim, sec. 25; Kol bo, sec. 45; Rosh, commentary to Megillah, sec. 8 and commentary to Ta'anit., sec. 24; Mordekhai, commentary to Megillah, sec. 776; Ritba, commentary to Megillah 2a, Rosh Ha-shanah 19b, and Ta'anit 10a and 15b. 1 54. It must be mentioned that the Jerusalem Talmud takes the position that there was a prohibi- tion to fast on the day before Purim even before the advent of Yom Nikanor. See Y. Ta'anit 2:13 (66a), and Y. Megillah 1:6 (70c). Presumably, such a prohibition would have survived the discontinuance of Megillat ta 'anit. 155. This approach is based on a statement made by R. Ashi at Ia'anit 1 8b in an analogous case. 156. See, e.g., (1) R. Judah b. Barzilai Al-Bargeloni (late eleventh-early twelfth century, Spain), author of Sefer ha-ittim, cited in Nahmanides (commentary to Rif, Meg., end of first chapter) and many others; (2) R. Ephraim Ibn Avi Alragan (late eleventh-early twelfth century, N. Africa), author of a commentary on the Rif, cited in Nahmanides, ibid.; (3) R. Meshullam of Bezier (late twelfth-early thir- teenth century, Provence), Sefer ha-hashlamah, commentary to Ta'anit., 2nd chapter; and (4) Ritba, commentary to Ta'anit 10a and 15b, and to Rosh Ha-shanah 19b. One other authority who takes this approach, in a responsum, is R. Abraham b. Isaac of Narbonne (twelfth century). See Elizur, Lammah zamnu, 115 n. 2. This responsum may not yet be published. It is found in a manuscript that includes geonic responsa, interspersed with responsa by the Rif and his pupils and by Provençal sages. The geonic responsa included in this manuscript have been published by Simhah Emanuel. See his Teshuvot ha-ge'onim ha-hadashot (Jerusalem: Mekhon Ofek, 1995). Emanuel shows that the author of the Shibboley ha-leket used this manuscript. The author of the Shibboley ha-leket refers to the responsum of R. Abraham b. Isaac without mentioning the name of its author, but instead uses the phrase: sha 'alu le-Ge 'onim z "1 .... See Shibboley ha-leket, sec. 278 (included in Ozar ha-ge 'onim, Ta'anit, 17, sec. 33). The attribution of this responsum to the "Ge 'onim " has misled many, as pointed out by Elizur. See her Lammah zamnu, 1 1 5 n. 2. But it is not uncommon among rishonim to use the term Ge 'onim to mean early rishonim. (The responsum of Abraham b. Isaac is also referred to in Tanya rabbati, sec. 62, a work closely related to the Shibboley ha-leket. See Encyclopaedia Judaica 2:938. 349</page><page sequence="42">Mitchell First Appendix III: The View of R. Jacob Tam The view of R. Tam is often cited in connection with the origin of the fast of the 13th A few matters in connection with his view require discussion.157 In the Rashba, Ritba,158 and others, R. Tam expresses essentially the same interpretation of zeman kehillah la-kol hiy as found in the geonic responsum included in Midrash Tanhuma and she 'Uta 79. But the unusual interpretation of yom ha-kenisah is not discussed or alluded to. But the way the view of R. Tam is cited in one place in the Rosh, R. Tam seems to be following the unusual interpretation of yom ha-kenisah. In his commentary to Meg. 2a,159 the Rosh writes that, according to R. Tam, zeman kehillah la-kol hiy meant that everyone gathers for Ta 'anit Esther, and the villagers come to the cities. 160 Similar language is used by the Tur.161 The way R. Tam is cited in the Mordekhai also suggests that R. Tam was following the unusual interpretation of yom ha-kenisah. l 2 The view of R. Tam is cited by the Rosh and many of the rishonim as if it is his own. But the fact that R. Tam follows at least one of the unusual interpretations found in the geonic responsum and she 'ilta 79 suggests that he had at least one of these sources in front of him. Several sources state that R. Tam used the She 'iltot here,163 but it is possible that he had the geonic responsum before him as well (or instead). In his commentary on Meg. 2a, the Rosh writes: It is attributed to Ge 'onim there as well.) I could find no evidence of an actual geonic view that the halakhah followed R. Simeon b. Gamliel. 157. His view is only known from summaries by others. 158. See their commentaries to B. Megillah 2a. 159. Megillah, sec. 1. 16U. niT^1? DnDDH ■»aa n^xai inox nvvm "psoxnö iirw. The Rosh mentions the view of R. Tam elsewhere in his commentaries: commentary to Megil- lah, sec. 8, and commentary to Ta'anit, sec. 24. He does not include this language there. Nor does Tosafot Rosh, commentary to Megillah 2a. R. Tam states that the reading, when advanced, takes place in the cities. This is not inconsistent with either the geonic responsum or she 'ilta 79, as neither states clearly where this reading takes place. Both refer to the 13th as a day on which Jews are yoshev be-ta 'anit or yoshvin be-ta 'anit, but this is an idiom and does not necessarily imply that one stays in one's locale. She 'Uta 79 includes more explanatory statements than the geonic responsum and some of the statements in she 'Uta 79 can perhaps be read to imply that the reading, when advanced, takes place in the cities. Also, the people who knew how to read the Megillah would have lived mainly in the cities. 161 . OH 686. The Tur is the son of the Rosh. The Tur does not state here that he is describing the view of R. Tam, but that is clearly what he is doing. 162. Comm. to Megillah, sec. 776, in Mordekhai ha-shalem, ed.

"inoxi "on» wi mv From here,164 it appears to Rabbeinu Tarn that we have a support for Ta'anit Esther that we observe, as they observed it in the days of Mordecai and Esther. This sounds like R. Tarn's position might be that, after the year of the threat, the fast on the 13th was not observed until it was instituted again in later times. But the Rosh writes elsewhere that, according to the view of R. Tarn, Ta'anit Esther was an enactment of the Sages even before Megillat ta'anit was annulled.165 Here, the Rosh has not attributed to R. Tarn the position that the fast was observed every year after the year of the threat, but has attributed to him the position that the fast was observed in ancient times. The Rosh does not state how R. Tarn reconciled his position with the observance of Yom Nikanor. Finally, R. Tarn attempts to support the interpretation that the Jews fasted on the 13th at the time of their battle with their Persian enemies by pointing to the tradition that the Jewish people fasted when they battled Amalek in the time of Moses.166 He is the earliest authority recorded to have made this point, and it is repeated by many others.167 164. B. Megillah 2a: zeman kehillah la-kol hiy. 165. Comm. to Megillah, sec. 8: myn jits» rnraœ DTip «i« oron ropn "inox iran "»in. 166. This tradition is found in many sources. See, e.g., Mekhilta ofR. Ishmael and Mekhilta of R. Simeon b. Yohai to Exodus 17:9 and 17:12; and Midrash Tanhuma, Beshalah, 27. This tradition is followed by Rashi in his commentary to Exodus 17:10. For additional sources, see Menahem M. Kasher, Torah shelemah, Beshalah, chapter 17, sees. 62 and 97. Many rishonim cite this tradition as being in the Talmud, Ta'anit, although it is not in our printed editions. 167. R. Tarn does not say this, but the reading of the Megillah every year can be construed as an engagement with Amalek's descendant. In rabbinic tradition (B. Megillah 13 a), "Haman, the son of Hammedata, the Agagite" (Esther 3:1) teaches that Haman was a descendant of the Agag who was king of Amalek at the time of Saul. 351</page></plain_text>
