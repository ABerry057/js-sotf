The documents reflect the perspectives of Jews and non-Jews alike and were originally reported by Kurdish officials of the Jewish colonies in Iranian Kurdistan,1 by Jewish sena tors of the National Parliament of Iran, as well as by Kurdish peasants of Kurdi stan. Most of the documents are in Persian, with the exception of perhaps nine in French stemming from Westernized Jewish circles.2 The purpose of the present contribution is not to offer a review of previous scholarship on Kurdish Jews. For this the reader may consult a number of recent valuable contributions.3 Rather, the aim here is simply to describe the outlines of a 1. Most of the Jews in Iranian Kurdistan lived in isolated towns, such as Qesr, Bicar of Gerus, Sine, Kirmasan, Seqiz, and tiny groups of Mukri Kurdistan. The fundamental work on the history of all Iranian Jews, including the Kurds, is still the three-volume Persian work by Hab?b Levy, T?rikh-i Yah?d-i Iran (Tehran: Librairie Y. Beroukhim et fils, 1955-60; repr., Beverly Hills: Iranian Jewish Cul tural Organization of California, 1984). Though indispensable, it is in need of much revision. 2. Despite the prominence of Persian in the archives, the Jews of Kurdistan spoke a distinctive dialect of neo-Aramaic very similar to that of the surrounding Kurdish community. See Haideh Sahim, "Languages and Dialects of the Jews of Iran and Afghanistan," in Esther's Children: A Portrait of Iranian Jews, ed. Houman Sarshar (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 2002), 287. 3. First of all, see P. J. Magnarella, "Jewish Kurds of Iran," Jewish Digest 15 (1970): 17-20.

Each document has its own personality and its own individual character, colored by the particular perspective of the individual who produced the record in a particular time and place. We learn, among other things, about the extent of bribery, extortion by government officials, and insecurity along the roads, all of which threatened the activities of Jewish mer chants, as well as the journeys of pilgrims. Other sources, not always stemming from Jewish circles, allude to the tendency of some mercantile Jewish families to make marriage liaisons with Muslims of comparable social class. This provides fascinating and important insights into the existence and operation of family net works within and across the Muslim and Jewish communities. Numerous allusions suggest that the members of prominent families experienced varying degrees of persecution and oppression at the hands of Sunni Kurds. Other documents, on the strength of incidental references, suggest the variety of Jewish connections to the power structure in Tehran. Furthermore, we may notice many details con cerning the character and disposition of the various Muslim Kurdish officials with whom Jews interacted. Finally, despite a nearly complete lack of explicit reference to the political frontiers of Iran, the collection's materials concerning the geographic distribution of Jews, especially their dispersion into neighboring states, affords a better understanding of the Kurdish-speaking communities and the Jews in Iraqi and Turkish Kurdistan. The List of Records The list of documents indicates the kinds of sources that are preserved in the collection. I present them with brief descriptions and notes. The collection con tains approximately 400 pages, measures 21x14 inches (29*21 centimeters). Sometimes the records can be found in more than one file and in more than one format (manuscript, type, or print). The appendix offers photographic reproduc tions of some of the materials.5 Herewith is the list: 1. April 1911, Doc. 17/14/131. Letter from a Jewish woman who converted to Islam, married a Muslim in 1905, and sought to inherit the properties of her paternal Jewish uncle. 4. A Persian librarian mentioned to me the existence of a "very few French documents" that relate to the more Westernized Jewish Kurds, but I have not had the opportunity to look at them or to record their titles. 5. No part of this collection is reproduced or transmitted in any form or by any means, photo copying or recording, including any information storage and retrieval system, without permission in writing from the Iranian Parliament Records. I have attempted to include some documents of the Jewish Kurds that have not been treated by earlier scholars, and I have incorporated some basic biblio graphical notes. However, because of the sensitivity of the Kurdish-Jewish theme in Iran, I can claim neither completeness nor consistency in these matters. 318</page><page sequence="3">Tehran's Unmined Archive Kurdish Jewry 2.

Moreover, there is, to my knowledge, no "Ily?s" school in Kurdistan. The reference is probably to the Alliance Isra?lite Universelle schools in Kurdistan. On the establishment of the Alliance schools in Kurdistan and Persia, see especially the material in Faryar Nikbakht, "As with Moses in Egypt: Alliance Isra?lite Universelle Schools in Iran," in Sarshar, Esther s Children, 199-212. 10. The reference is to Ay?b Luqm?n Neh?r?y, the active representative of the Jews in the Iranian Parliament or Majlis (1909-^13) and one of the founders of Zionism in Iran. Cf. Shirin D.
