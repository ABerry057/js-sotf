Bloom- ington: Indiana University Press, 1990. x, 244 pp. Robert Gordis has throughout his life been one of the Conservative</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 215 movement's leading thinkers, and one of its ablest exponents. His dual titles of professor and rabbi are not, as is so often the case, merely adornments to his person, but are both integral to his personality. His academic scholar- ship is always at the service of his religious calling; his theology is always informed by his scholarship. These qualities are amply in evidence in the book under review. Gordis presents us with a well-reasoned philosophy of halakhah, one which grows organically out of a clearly defined conception of Judaism in its totality. The title of this book, The Dynamics of Judaism, and its subtitle, A Study in Jewish Law, accurately reflect the relationship between its general and its specific emphases. The author begins his book on Jewish law with a discussion of the impact of Israelite bondage in Egypt, and even more so of the liberation therefrom, on the Jewish religious psyche. Then he continues with a chapter entitled "The Primacy of Ethics." Gordis is specifically a bib- lical scholar, and one can see here how his biblical orientation is integrated with his concept of Judaism as a whole. These chapters, and the latter one especially, later play a crucial role in the conception of halakhah which he develops. Gordis utilizes for his purpose modern critical scholarship in Bible, rab- binics, and intellectual history. Actually, the verb "utilize" understates the case. As thoroughly as fundamentalist Orthodoxy bases itself on a literalist understanding of revelation, Gordis bases his philosophy of Judaism on the premises and conclusions of critical scholarship. This trait combines with a mustering of cogent sources which gives the work credibility on a purely academic level. It is this which allows him to state in the introduction, "The present book is not written in a partisan spirit. . . . I believe that the outlook expressed here cuts across denominational lines and is accepted by thought- ful men and women in all sectors of the Jewish community" (p. 10). However, the nature of the study as a purely academic analysis, one which can be convincing on its merits without regard to partisan positions, is undermined by the attention to issues of contemporary relevance which pervades the book. Gordis explicitly recognizes this aspect of his study, along with an awareness that some readers may see in his book a partisan, and therefore an "unacademic," work. He states in the preface: "The pre- sent work has been written in a spirit of conviction. . . . I therefore venture to hope that the scholarship reflected in these pages will not be impugned by its concern for the grave problems confronting Jews and all human beings in the last decade of the twentieth century" (p. vii). This passage does not,</page><page sequence="3">216 BOOK REVIEWS however, indicate an awareness that any attempt to deal with "live" issues will necessarily become partisan. The partisan nature of the book, in fact, intrudes itself on many levels. It could hardly have been otherwise, in view of the fact that the book proceeds from the pen of so dedicated a spokesman for Conservative Judaism as Gordis, and grapples with issues which stand at the forefront of current con- cern, such as the ordination of women, and feminist issues in general. The large amount of space, relative to the broad scope of the book as a whole, which is dedicated to these matters, as well as to the issue of mixed pews (pp. 114-119), is indicative of the book's true agenda. Gordis presents a classic version of "positive-historical" Judaism, stressing the response to historical, social, and economic forces, the balance between continuity and change, and the human interpretive and decision-making role in general, in the legi- timate formulation of halakhah. In addition to these he sees an evolving ethical sensitivity as one of the main factors contributing to halakhic change. The notion of an evolving ethical sensitivity relates to one of the central elements in Gordis's philosophy, a belief in human progress in the sphere of ethics and morality. Gordis takes such progress for granted, though one would think that in the post-Holocaust world the notion would require some justification. Another element which plays a crucial role in his think- ing is the concept of "normative Judaism." Gordis is aware that this concept is not so much in vogue these days (p. 30), having been put into question by the work of Gershom Scholem. He acknowledges that "a good deal of merit inheres" in the view which negates the concept of normative Judaism, but the implications of this position do not affect his basic thinking one iota. In the immediate sequel (pp. 31-35) he comes to grips with the role of mysti- cism in the makeup of Judaism. Gordis is clearly uncomfortable with mysti- cism. It does not fit at all into his conception of normative Judaism. On the one hand he is dedicated to the acceptance of modern critical research; on the other, the irrational basis of mysticism is counter to his entire worldview. He struggles with this dilemma, and finds his peace with it. Partisanship makes itself felt also in a certain combative stance which runs through the book, and an expressed disdain for fundamentalist posi- tions. Gordis is certain that the Orthodox withdrawal into stringency in the face of the onslaught of Westernization was counterproductive, as evidenced by "the wholesale defection of the vast majority of modern Jews from the Halakhah" (p. 93). But could any strategy in the world have prevented this?</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 217 The phenomenon of the baal teshuvah movement is dismissed as a naive attempt to turn back the clock (p. 93). But right-wing Orthodoxy, in both its yeshiva and its Hasidic guises, is undergoing an amazing spurt of growth and vitality these days, while the Conservative movement and modern Orthodoxy are increasingly facing the ravages of assimilation. Gordis does not deal with this phenomenon. It is axiomatic for him that the future is on his side. He claims that the results of modern scholarship in Jewish studies support his theology, which allows for a human role in revelation (pp. 75, 172). But it is not the facts to which he refers that are in dispute, but rather their interpretation. It is gratuitous to allege that Orthodox opposition to women rabbis stems solely from the fact that women did not fill that role in the past (p. 172). Gordis argues for a deliberate, rabbinically initiated adaptation of halakhah to the needs of the hour and enhanced ethical standards, a view very much in accord with Conservative philosophy. In doing so he empha- sizes the rabbinic role in halakhic adaptation and undervalues the role of minhag, popular religious practice. Laws which "they [the rabbis] felt were inappropriate to their situation" were "simply ignored in practice and, where possible, passed over in silence" (p. 89). Elsewhere he talks about new conditions being meant by the "protean capacity for adjustment upheld by its [the halakhah's] more liberal expounders" (p. 94). But generally, if not always, the rabbis were reflecting and responding to popular usage. The Mishnah's metaphor, that the laws on annulment of vows are "floating in the air," a comment referring to their lack of basis in the Written Torah, is cited as "clear" proof that the rabbis consciously innovated these laws. It is just as easy, and probably more historically accurate, to assume that here too the rabbis of the Mishnah were reflecting a long-entrenched practice. Gordis's zeal for making his point overtakes him elsewhere as well. He misstates the argument of the opponents of women's ordination when he confuses obligation to pray with the right to pray, and ignores the talmudic source for this distinction (p. 181). He views the talmudic requirement, and common practice, of bearing many children as representing a nullification of the minimal standard of two as recorded in the Mishnah (pp. 90, 191). Aside from the fact that the introduction of a more stringent requirement is com- mon in the history of halakhah, and is not commonly viewed as a nullifica- tion of a laxer standard, it so happens that there is a tannaitic view (of Rabbi Joshua, Yevamot 62b) which requires a continuing process of procreation. Though the book is well documented, there are a number of occasions</page><page sequence="5">218 BOOK REVIEWS where documentation is missing. Most blatant of these are two on which a quotation is unannotated, on p. 166, a citation of Salo Baron, and on p. 157, a reference to "surviving documents" from Egypt and Palestine. No source is given for the intriguing explanation, which Gordis calls "obvious," that plowing with an ox and donkey together was prohibited because of the hard- ship for the weaker animal (p. 41). There are a number of questionable state- ments which I would have liked to have seen documented or defended: that the literal meaning of Song of Songs was not lost on the Jews who read it on Sabbath eve (p. 19); that in the case of the two men in the desert with a single flask of water, Akiba would have admitted that the one with the water "would be free to give his bottle to his companion, out of love for him or out of the conviction that there was a greater gain in preserving the life of his companion than his own" (p. 21); that "apparently" nazirites "were also called upon to refrain from sexual relations" (p. 32). The error in the dates for Israel Independence Day and for Jerusalem Liberation Day (p. 120) is, I am sure, inadvertent, though perplexing. More serious is the reference to Isserles' gloss allegedly permitting women to be called to the Torah. A check of the reference shows that such is not the case. These lapses, however, are few and minor. The book is a coherent and readable statement of Gordis's philosophy of Judaism, a spirited and chal- lenging integration of the insights of modern research with the teachings of a venerable tradition. It is a book well worth reading. Samuel Morell State University of New York at Binghamton Binghamton, N.Y.</page></plain_text>
