<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DUISBURG AFFAIR: A TEST CASE IN THE STRUGGLE FOR "CONQUEST OF THE COMMUNITIES" by JACK WERTHEIMER During the years immediately preceding World War I, German Zionism boldly reoriented its ideological and political program. New leaders drawn from the ranks of a younger generation now emphasized the critical neces- sity of their movement for the survival of German Jewry and rejected their predecessors' view that German Zionism was primarily a philanthropic cause designed to aid imperiled East European Jews. The movement also increasingly criticized the tactics and policies of other Jewish groups, claim- ing that Zionists best knew how to solve the problems of German Jewry. The transformed Zionist Federation of Germany thereby abandoned its earlier posture of moderation and conciliation in favor of a radical and aggressive stance intended to revitalize the movement and challenge the incumbent leadership of German Jewry.' NOTE: I am indebted to the National Foundation for Jewish Culture and the Leo Baeck Insti- tute for generously financing my research trips to archives in Israel and the German Federal Republic. 1. Within the past decade, several scholars have written important monographs that analyze the reorientation of German Zionism and its consequences. The first major work to focus on this subject was Ismar Schorsch's Jewish Reactions to German Anti-Semitism, 1870-1914 (New York and Philadelphia, 1972), chap. 7. See also, the subsequent works of Jehuda Reinharz, Fatherland or Promised Land.- The Dilemma of the German Jew, 1893-1914 (Ann Arbor, 1975), chaps. 3-5 and Stephen M.

Jewish liberals proudly proclaimed themselves German citizens of the Mosaic persuasion and rejected claims of Jewish nationalism as slanderous. In fact, they demanded Jewish legal and social equality precisely on the grounds that Jews were indistinguishable from their compatriots in every manner save religion-and that was a private concern.2 They, therefore, responded to their opponents' radical challenge by launching a forceful barrage of anti-Zionist propaganda, and, in short order, Zionists and liberals were joined in a bitter public struggle. Particularly within the past decade, historians have lavished careful attention on the origins and consequences of this conflict. To date, however, scholars have focused exclusively on ideological confrontations and have ignored or minimized the political dimension of this struggle. Recent his- toriography suggests that Zionists sought mainly to challenge the ideology of liberalism, but refrained from engaging their opponents in the political arena.3 An examination of the Duisburg Affair, a critical test case in the Zionist/liberal rivalry, will enable us to reassess some common assumptions concerning the naure of the Zionist challenge and the consequent political struggle within German Jewry on the eve of World War I. The battleground in the conflict between liberals and Zionists was a uniquely Central European institution-the Jewish Gemeinde. German state laws, rather than Jewish voluntarism, constituted the basis for this form of 2. Liberals, the vast majority of German Jewry, eschewed the extremes of orthodoxy and radical reform in matters of religion. In this regard, they differed little from Zionists in their personal ritual practices. But for political and ideological reasons, Zionists defended the interests of orthodox Jews when liberals sought to introduce reforms. See Reinharz, pp. 208 and 247, n. 45 for a brief discussion of the term "liberal" in the Jewish context. The works cited in n. 1 all refer to the ideology of Jewish liberals in Germany. On the activities of Jewish liberals in the German, rather than Jewish, political arena, see Marjorie Lamberti, Jewish Activism in Imperial Germany (New Haven, 1978). 3. See the references in n. 1 for examples of this tendency. Jehuda Reinharz contends that "until after World War I the Eroberung der Gemeinden [conquest of the communities] remained for the most part an ideological issue rather than a real threat to the rule of the notables" (p. 137).</page><page sequence="3">THE DUISBURG AFFAIR 187 communal structure. Governments compelled Jews in every locality to establish, join, and support Gemeinden; they insured the financial resources of communities by collecting taxes for the Gemeinden; and they regulated communal activities, requiring Jewish leaders to report when they hired or fired synagogue functionaries, allocated budgets for Gemeinde-run syna- gogues, schools, libraries, clinics, charities, and so forth, and revised com- munal statutes. State officials even supervised the election of communal representatives by male franchise-holders and the selection of an Executive Board (Vorstand) by the Representative Assembly.4 Around 1910, conflicts within Jewish communities erupted when Ger- man Zionists embarked on a program to win control of Gemeinde offices. Taking as their slogan Herzl's call for Zionist "conquest of the communi- ties," a cadre of young radicals struggled to wrest communal leadership from the long domination of liberal notables. In some Gemeinden, notably Berlin, Posen, and Munich, Zionists challenged existing election systems and campaigned for changes that would strengthen minority factions by substituting proportional representation for list voting. In other communi- ties, Zionists formed a Neue Jiidische Gemeindeverein that ran slates in cities such as K6nigsberg, Dessau, and Chemnitz. Where it seemed expe- dient, the Zionists forged political alliances with orthodox groups to broaden their electoral base further. As the first decade of the twentieth cen- tury came to a close, such self-styled "conservative" blocs of Zionist and orthodox factions began to register impressive electoral gains in several Gemeinden.I 4. For a concise analysis of the structure and function of modern Gemeinden, see Kurt Wilhelm, "The Jewish Community in the Post-Emancipation Period," Yearbook of the Leo Baeck Institute 2 (1957): 47-75. Various state governments referred to the communities by dif- ferent names: Jaidische Gemeinde, Synagogengemeinde, Israelitische Gemeinde, Israelitische Kultusgemeinde or Religionsgemeinde. Nevertheless, all of these bodies shared three common characteristics: 1. they were recognized public bodies; 2. membership in them was compul- sory; 3. they had the right to levy taxes (Wilhelm, "Community," pp. 47-48). It is, therefore, possible to refer to them generically as Gemeinden. 5. Herzl issued his charge at the Second Zionist Congress of 1898. The Hamburg Israeli- tisches Familienblatt (I.F.H.) provides a good survey of challenges to the electoral system (February 22, 1912, p. 2).

Incumbent liberal representatives in approximately ten Prussian Gemeinden revised their communal statutes so as to disenfranchise all Jews who lacked citizenship in a German state. They acted on the assumption that Jewish aliens represented the balance of power in many communities. Deprived of the immigrant vote, Zionist/orthodox coalitions stood little chance to win elections; with the votes of foreign Jews, however, the new alliances could oust liberal notables from communal offices in several Gemeinden. In direct response to their fear that an ever-growing influx of immigrants might permanently tip the balance of power toward their opponents, liberal leaders disenfranchised alien Jews. Their primary goal was not to attack foreign coreligionists, but to fortify their own political positions.6 The Zionists recognized the political danger posed by the proposed sta- tute revisions. They quickly rose to the defense of immigrant Jews, indig- nantly fighting for the legal equality of all Jews. Such a stance could hardly hurt the Zionist cause among immigrant voters. More important, Zionists seized upon the voting-rights issue to castigate further Jewish liberalism and scornfully denounce the incumbent liberal leadership of German Jewry. Voting rights controversies provided ideal opportunities for the small and 6. Until now, scholars have virtually ignored the controversy over voting rights, an issue that sorely divided and troubled German Jewry. Shalom Adler-Rudel dismisses it in two para- graphs (Ostjuden in Deutschland [Tfibingen, 1959], pp. 27-28). Other historians are under the erroneous impression that there were no voting rights to take away since aliens rarely pos- sessed the franchise. Naomi Katzenberger is one of the first to appreciate the importance of this controversy in her brief introduction to several documents that she published in "Dokumente zur Frage des Wahlrechts Ausliindischer Juden in den Preussischen Synagogengemeinden," Michael 2 (1973): 191-203. As the present essay neared completion, my attention was drawn to a dissertation that concisely describes the general voting rights issue in order to place the par- ticular controversy in Danzig into its proper context. See Elijahu Stern, "The History of the Jews in Danzig from the Emancipation Until Their Deportation in the Nazi Era" [Hebrew], Hebrew University, 1978, pp. 54-63. The present analysis of the voting rights issue is based on Chapter Nine of my doctoral dis- sertation, "German Policy and Jewish Politics: The Absorption of East European Jews in Ger- many, 1868-1914," Columbia University, 1978. There, I discuss the participation of Eastern Jews in Gemeinde politics and the disenfranchisement movement that swept across Prussia between 1910 and 1914. (The Prussian Gemeinden of Bochum, Cologne, Danzig, Dessau, Dort- mund, Duisburg, Hamborn, Hamm, and Miinster, as well as the Saxon community of Chem- nitz all revised their statutes during this period in a manner that stripped foreign Jews of their franchise.) See that chapter also for additional evidence to support my thesis that the disenfran- chisement movement was an anti-Zionist, rather than an antiimmigrant, cause.</page><page sequence="5">THE DUISBURG AFFAIR 189 outnumbered Zionist movement to score propaganda victories and press their political attack on liberal notables. The Zionists chose a voting rights controversy in the small Rhenish community of Duisburg as their major test case. Although this Gemeinde was not the first to propose the disenfranchisement of its immigrant popula- tion, the Zionists highlighted events in Duisburg in order to expose the crudity and irresponsibility of their liberal opponents. So starkly defined were the issues and so transparent were the motives of liberal leaders, that the small Zionist party could exploit the petty conflicts in Duisburg to win a major political and propaganda victory. Once they recognized the political opportunity, Zionists shrewdly transformed developments in Duisburg into an affair of national and even international consequence for Jews. The Duis- burg Affair both mirrored the internecine rivalry that divided German Jewry, and simultaneously further inflamed political tensions between liberals and Zionists.7 Duisburg was an unlikely setting for such a major test of wills. Though its 229,000 inhabitants constituted Germany's twentieth largest urban popu- lation in 1910, Duisburg was hardly a major metropolis and was over- shadowed by nearby DiUsseldorf, the administrative seat of Prussia's district governor. Moreover, Duisburg's small Jewish community contained only 1,554 souls in 1910, ranking it thirty-fifth among Jewish Gemeinden. With the exception of Harry Epstein, the leading Zionist spokesman in Duisburg, this community boasted no nationally prominent Jewish leaders. Yet despite its modest size and reputation, the Duisburg Gemeinde became the locus of a minor cause cdlkbre.8 7. This account of the Duisburg Affair is based primarily on documents from the archives of two major participants-the Prussian district governor in Diisseldorf and the Zionist attor- ney, Harry Epstein. As the state official responsible for Gemeinde affairs in Duisburg, the Prus- sian Regierungsprdsident received memoranda from all concerned parties. His papers relating to the Affair are located in the Hauptstaatsarchiv Dfisseldorf, Zweigarchiv Kalkum, Reg. Diisseldorf #30567 (hereafter Dfisseldorf #30567), "Synagogengemeinde in Duisburg, 1891-1916." Harry Epstein acted as the central spokesman for "conservatives" in Duisburg. His collect- ed, but uncatalogued, papers contain numerous copies of memoranda and letters exchanged during the controversy-especially by the Zionists. This collection is located in the Central Zionist Archives, Jerusalem (hereinafter C.Z.A. A 101/Box number). 8. The statistics on Jews in Duisburg are based on Heinrich Silbergleit, Die Bev6lkerung und Berufsverhaltnisse der Juden im Deutschen Reich (Berlin, 1930), p. 24.</page><page sequence="6">190 JACK WERTHEIMER The prologue to the affair occurred during the communal elections of December 1909. Ostensibly, voters were simply asked to cast ballots for five new members of the Representative Assembly. In fact, the election was a test of strength between incumbent liberal leaders and a newly founded coalition of Zionist and orthodox Jews in Duisburg. The latter had been created to block prayerbook reforms recently proposed by the liberals. Led by the Zionist attorney Harry Epstein, a self-styled "conservative" coalition suc- cessfully managed to win several seats in the Representative Assembly and thereby gained a veto power over the reforms.9 Liberal representatives responded to their defeat by petitioning the Prus- sian district governor in Diisseldorf to nullify the election results. They claimed that one newly elected representative, the above mentioned Harry Epstein, was ineligible to hold office since he had not maintained continuous residence in Duisburg for three years prior to the election. (Such a residency requirement was stipulated in Article 15 of the Gemeinde statutes as a pre- requisite for officeholders but not voters.) The "conservatives" in turn defended Epstein and challenged the election of a new liberal representative on other technical grounds. Within a month, the governor disqualified Epstein, but upheld all other election results. This decision left both sides dissatisfied and prompted appeals to the provincial governor in Koblenz, the liberals demanding an entirely new election and the "conservatives" urg- ing a by-election to replace Epstein. The governor in Koblenz, however, backed his subordinate.'0 The entire matter left the liberals so embittered that they threatened to secede from the Gemeinde. They were dissuaded, however, by the communal 9. Jadische Rundschau (J.R.), December, 1910, pp. 577, 587; FI.F, December 10, 1910, p. 3. The terms "liberal" and "conservative" were employed by both Jewish and gentile contem- poraries in characterizing these factions. For example, the district governor in Dfisseldorf informed his superior, the provincial governor in Koblenz, that the Duisburg community was divided into two "parties"-"the liberals" and the "conservatives [orthodox]." Diisseldorf #30567, Memorandum of August 19, 1913. See below for examples of Jews who employ these terms. We must note, however, that Zionists were not necessarily religiously conservative, and they were radical in regard to Jewish internal politics. 10. See Diisseldorf #30567 for a series of petitions and memoranda dated December, 1909-April, 1910. A memorandum from the mayor of Duisburg is especially useful in clarifying the major issues of contention (January 15, 1910). Additional memoranda on this election con- troversy are available in the archive of the Prussian Provincial Governor in Koblenz. See Landeshauptarchiv Koblenz, Oberprasidium der Rheinprovinz, Bestand 403 Nr. 16011, "Bech- werden und Antrige in Verwaltungsangelegenheiten der jiidischen Synagogengemeinden, 1902-1929," pp. 365-96.

This liberal rabbi fully supported prayer- book reforms, and he depicted opponents of such changes as Jews "coming from an entirely different environment who have no judgment or under- standing concerning the problems and needs of our community." Neumark, however, appealed to his liberal supporters not to destroy the unity of the community by seceding." The events surrounding the election of 1909 foreshadowed the Duisburg Affair in several important ways. As early as 1909, a Zionist-led coalition successfully challenged liberal incumbents and scored impressive electoral gains. In response, liberals sought technical grounds to undo their defeat at the polls by requesting governmental leaders to invalidate election results and challenging the voting rights of a recent arrival in Duisburg. Finally, some liberals blamed their electoral defeat on foreign Jews within the com- munity. When a new election was called three years later, unresolved tensions between liberals and Zionists erupted with greater intensity. The campaign preceding the election of December 10, 1912 was particularly hard fought because an unusually large number of communal positions were vacant. Due to several deaths and resignations, five out of nine seats in the Repre- sentative Assembly and all three substitutes (Stellvertreter) were up for elec- tion. The outcome of the balloting was disastrous for the liberals. Their opponents captured all five seats in the Representative Assembly and all three stand-in slots. The liberals had lost control of the Representative Assembly and only managed to retain a hold on the Vorstand because incumbent representatives selected its members.'2 Stunned by their electoral loss, liberal representatives and their sup- porters hastily convened at a local caf6 to devise a strategy. They planned to overturn the election results by convincing government authorities that the balloting had been fraudulent. And to insure future victories, they sought to disqualify a sizable number of orthodox and Zionist supporters from par- ticipation in coming elections. 11. On the liberals' threat, see references in n. 9. Rabbi Neumark's appeal, "Die Biirg- schaftspflicht. Ein Mahnruf an die Gemeinde," is in C.Z.A. A 101/ Box 9. 12. On the election campaign see C.Z.A. A 101/ Box 4 (Epstein's memorandum of April 10, 1913) and a letter from the Mayor of Duisburg dated December 30, 1912 in Diisseldorf #30567. Although we lack a definitive reference to the political allegiances of the newly elected leaders, we can surmise their affiliations from the fact that they all signed "conservative" petitions that denounced not only liberals but also liberalism. (See nn. 17 and 18 for references to these peti- tions.)</page><page sequence="8">192 JACK WERTHEIMER On December 19, 1912, fifty-five liberal members of the Duisburg Gemeinde petitioned the Prussian district governor in Duisseldorf to over- turn the recent election on the grounds that orthodox Jews had perpetrated voter fraud. The petitioners claimed that orthodox Jews were so intent on ousting liberals from office that they solicited support from Galician co- religionists residing in Duisburg. But the latter did not deserve to participate in elections, for "these elements mostly immigrated in recent years and stand apart from their native coreligionists due to their religious require- ments and way of life.... They display their aloofness practically by sup- porting a separate prayer-house where they conduct services according to the rites of Hasidim, a group considered fanatical by right-minded Jews." Foreign Jews even maintain their own ritual slaughterer, rather than sup- port the Gemeinde shohet. "On the whole, these seventy or eighty people play no role in communal affairs but are manipulated by a small minority of orthodox Jews during election campaigns." It would be unthinkable to per- mit foreign Jews who have little contact with communal life and who prac- tice a sectarian form of Judaism to decide the future of a German Gemeinde.'3 The petitioners further contended that the participation of Galicians in Gemeinde elections was not only unfair but inevitably led to corrupt cam- paign practices. Since it was easy to deceive inexperienced newcomers, orthodox Jews spread false rumors to frighten Galicians into voting against liberal candidates. Some orthodox Jews had warned observant foreigners that if liberals won the election, they would shift the Jewish Sabbath to Sun- day and eliminate Hebrew from the prayerbook. When scare tactics and coercion failed to convince the Galicians, the orthodox openly bought votes. They bribed Samuel Halsband, the Galicians' spiritual leader, to pay his fol- lowers five marks each to vote for "conservative" candidates. (The petition includes the names of eight Galicians who allegedly confessed their involve- ment in vote buying or selling.) The orthodox even drove Galician voters to the polls and wrote out in Hebrew characters the names of "conservative" candidates. The liberals' petition concluded with an appeal for the nullification of the December 12 election. Since barely fifteen to twenty votes had decided the election, whereas some thirty to forty Galicians had voted, it was evident that the corrupt and unfair participation of alien Jews determined the out- 13.

A second election surely was necessary under the circumstances.'4 A few days after submitting their petition, and just eight days before their term of office expired, the liberal incumbents hastily approved a revi- sion of their communal statutes that would ensure a different result in future elections. Henceforth, only men of "German citizenship" could vote who had resided in the Gemeinde for at least one year and had earned sufficient income to be assessed for communal tax. The Duisburg elders clearly aimed to strip aliens of the franchise by creating the fictional category of "German citizenship," rather than accepting solely Prussian citizens. (In Imperial Germany, one possessed the citizenship of an individual state but not Ger- man citizenship. Hence, there were Prussian but not German citizens.)'5 The Duisburg Executive Board sent a memorandum to the district governor in Diisseldorf in order to acquire the necessary governmental approval for this statute revision. The Vorstand justified its action by pe- joratively depicting the soon-to-be disenfranchised foreign Jews in Duis- burg. The liberals claimed it was preposterous to grant aliens "of a lower culture ... whose hearts cannot beat in unison for Germany" the power to determine the future of a German-Jewish community. Yet, in this memo- randum the Duisburg elders directed their greatest ire not at the Galicians or even the orthodox, but rather at another faction-the Zionists. Com- munal peace "would have continued had the Zionists worked within the system. But that faction has recently sought to bring their originally purely political opposition to the .. . majority into the religious sphere. The Duis- burg Zionist group, a numerically insignificant one ... already in the second to last election [that of 1909] gained the votes of Galicians. . . . This is the 14. It is difficult to verify the statistics offered by the liberals. We do know, however, that successful candidates each received between 91 and 101 votes, whereas the losers each garnered between 72 and 83 votes. Thus, 40 Galician voters could well have swung the election. (See the mayor's memorandum dated December 30, 1912 in Dfisseldorf #30567 for vote tallies.) Let us note that in December 1910 there were 1,554 Jews in Duisburg, of whom 309 (19.88 percent) were aliens. Yet in the election of 1912 no more than 175 Jews exercised the franchise. (Accord- ing to the Mayor of Duisburg, only 100 individuals voted; but on the basis of the election returns, this figure is below the actual tally. On the other hand, the J.R. places the figure at 320 voters-an exaggeration.) The statistics on Jews in Duisburg are in Heinrich Silbergleit, Die Bevolkerung ..., p. 24 and Vierteljahreshefte zur Statistik des Deutschen Reiches, supplement to 1916, p. 86. 15. These developments were first reported in the E.I.F on December 27, 1912, where mention is made of an attempt to introduce a three-tier voting system that clearly favored the wealthy. This system was not, however, proposed in the revised statutes. For more on the behind-the-scenes maneuvering, see C.Z.A. A 101/Box 7.</page><page sequence="10">194 JACK WERTHEIMER question: In the future should the community be led and represented by German-feeling men or by men who ... want to revise world history to reestablish a national Judaism and who do not partake of the German national sensibility [Volksempfinden], its thinking, feeling, and aspira- tions!"'6 The Duisburg liberals revealed their hidden agenda with this declara- tion. For what concerned them had little to do with corrupt campaign prac- tices and undue foreign influence in Gemeinde affairs. Instead, they feared the increasing strength of their political opposition, the Zionist-led coali- tion. Since immigrants bolstered that political bloc, they had to be eliminat- ed from elections. The voting rights controversy in Duisburg-as else- where-was only incidentally over East European Jews. Liberals disenfran- chised immigrants in order to weaken the insurgent Zionist/orthodox camp. Orthodox and Zionist Jews in Duisburg recognized the danger and responded forcefully to their opponents' actions. As early as December 17, 1912 they pledged to "battle against Jewish liberalism and for freedom and Judaism" and warned the liberals to back down lest a bitter struggle ensue. When the liberals took matters before government officials, the self-styled "conservatives" drafted their own memorandum. They argued that the pro- posed statute revision was illegal since Prussia's Jewry Law of 1847 (which still governed Gemeinde affairs) protected aliens as full members of the com- munity. They stressed that discrimination based on nationality would destroy communal unity, and they portrayed liberals as political hacks intent on rushing through a statute revision against all democratic and reli- gious rules of procedure."7 The newly elected representatives and stand-by candidates defended the legality of the December 12 election and countered the damaging charges of voter fraud. The source of these allegations was a Galician named Chaim Artmann, "a very limited individual who neither reads nor writes, either in German or Yiddish." Artmann's employer, an unsuccessful candidate in the elections, wished to retaliate for his defeat by damaging the reputation of 16. The memorandum (dated December 28, 1912) is located in C.Z.A.

The petitioners argued that these allega- tions were without any foundation and that Galicians were prepared to testify that no one sought or received money for voting.'8 The mayor of Duisburg concluded after investigating these charges and countercharges that the election of 1912 had been orderly and had met legal requirements. In a memorandum to his superior, the district governor in Diisseldorf, the mayor rejected charges of voter fraud as baseless. True, some orthodox and Zionist campaigners had driven their supporters to the polls, but there was no evidence to support charges of vote buying. Based on these assurances, the Regierungspraisident in Duisseldorf ratified the election results and rejected the liberals' protest. He did not, however, rule on the proposed statute revision.19 Two days after this decision was handed down, the still dissatisfied liberals again hurled charges of voter fraud. Members of the Duisburg Gemeinde had gathered to debate new religious guidelines drafted by a synod of liberal rabbis. The community had a special interest in the meeting since Rabbi Neumark of Duisburg had signed the guidelines. An orthodox spokesman began the proceedings by denouncing the guidelines, after which Neumark spoke in his own defense. Harry Epstein then took the floor for the Zionists. He proclaimed that "the Rabbi spoke falsehoods and does not know what truth is." In the ensuing uproar, Epstein was warmly applauded by his supporters, including Galician Jews seated together in the rear of the room, and hooted by the liberals. A liberal merchant named Levy Rosenthal thereupon turned to the foreign Jews and shouted in exasperation-"Silence you Galicians, you five mark men!" Epstein and Samuel Halsband, the Galician leader, subsequently sued Rosenthal for libel, knowing that the hapless Rosenthal was in a weak position because he aired a charge that just had been rejected by the Duisburg mayor and Prussian District Governor.20 This incident further illustrates the bitter antagonism that divided the 18. The "conservative" petition, dated January 6, 1913, is in Diisseldorf #30567. We should note that if allegations of voter fraud were proven correct, far more than the election would be at stake. German law mandated imprisonment for up to two years and a loss of many rights for both buyers and sellers of votes (J.R., October 31, 1913, pp. 467-78). Foreign Jews found guilty of breaking the law faced immediate expulsion. 19.

The</page><page sequence="12">196 JACK WERTHEIMER Duisburg Gemeinde and the aggressiveness with which both sides battled their opponents. In the heat of the controversy, communal leaders publicly humiliated one another, laymen branded rabbis as liars and cheats, and neighbors slapped each other with legal suits. In some instances, families were split into feuding camps. The family of Harry Epstein, for example, was bitterly divided between his own Zionist sympathies and the liberal leanings of both his father and father-in-law. Both of the elder men were even prepared to testify on behalf of Rosenthal against their own kin.2' Clearly, then, the voting rights struggle in Duisburg was far more than an academic debate over ideology; it was a bitter struggle for power. The affair entered a new phase in late November 1913 when the Zionists brought events in Duisburg to the attention of all German Jewry. In a sear- ing indictment entitled "The Shame of Duisburg," the Jiidische Rundschau, German Zionism's press organ, transformed the affair into a nationally debated scandal. The Zionist newspaper viewed "what occurred in Duis- burg as but the wildest expression of that spiritual corruption which we sadly find among our assimilated Jews." The Duisburg elders were no better than German anti-Semites; their slanders against alien Jews were analogous to recent blood accusations made in Germany and Russia. How could liberal organizations such as the Central Union of German Citizens of the Mosaic Persuasion (Central Verein) and the Association for Liberal Judaism in Germany tolerate in their midst members who mistreated fellow Jews? Surely, the spiritual and moral bankruptcy of liberal Jews was appar- ent from their mute acceptance of discrimination against alien coreligion- ists!22 Remarkably, nearly a full year had elapsed from the onset of the affair before this critique brought events in Duisburg to the attention of all Ger- man Jewry. That liberals failed to publicize this embarrassing episode is not liberal guidelines are translated in W. Gunther Plaut, The Growth of Reform Judaism (New York, 1965), pp. 68-74. 21. Rosenthal's attorney threatened that Siegmund Epstein and Emanuel Lowe would tes- tify against Harry Epstein. See letter dated April 10, 1913 in C.Z.A. A 101/Box 4. 22.

Zionist editorialists lamely explained their initially poor coverage of developments in Duisburg as a consequence of their decision to preserve Jewish unity until the resolution of the Mendel Beilis Affair. In all likeli- hood, however, Zionists seized upon the case of Duisburg because it provid- ed the best ammunition to fight a movement to disenfranchise foreign Jews rapidly spreading through Prussian Gemeinden at this time. In order to discredit the entire movement, Zionists focused on the particularly question- able practices of Duisburg's liberal representatives who alone had acted to revise communal statutes after their electoral defeat and had accused fellow Jews of voter fraud and sectarianism. Thus, Zionists launched their propa- ganda campaign against the disenfranchisement movement by focusing attention on an unusually scandalous case.23 "The Shame of Duisburg" provided Zionists with a major propaganda coup. Jewish newspapers as far away as London, Baltimore, and Philadel- phia published summaries of the article, fully accepting the Zionist critique. In Germany, some general periodicals rebuked Jewish liberals for acting in so illiberal a fashion, while anti-Semites gleefully quoted liberal references to the sectarianism of Galician immigrants, thereby exposing Duisburg's liberals to charges of playing into the hands of Jew-haters. The German- Jewish press subjected notables in Duisburg and liberal Jewry in general to a torrent of criticism. National organizations of liberal orientation, such as the Central Verein, the Bnai Brith, and the Association for Liberal Judaism came under attack for their failure to disassociate themselves from Duis- burg's representatives. On the whole, liberal Jewry responded feebly to this criticism, primarily because it was divided over the issue of disenfranchisement and deeply embarrassed by the bungling actions of the Duisburg representatives. No national leaders of a liberal organization publicly supported the disenfran- chisement of alien Jews. In fact, two national agencies-the Verband der 23.

The J.R. refers to a discussion of the affair at a meeting held by the anti-Semitic German Social Party in Berlin (December 19, 1913), p. 548.

Other major organiza- tions remained officially neutral on the issue of disenfranchisement. However, liberal groups did defend their members in Duisburg from ortho- dox and Zionist attacks. The Central Verein, for example, rose to the defense of the Duisburg liberals since Zionists were using the affair to casti- gate Jewish liberalism. At the same time, however, the Central Verein took no stance on the general issue of voting rights, claiming that it could not meddle in local communal affairs.24 While organizations kept quiet, individual liberals occasionally went on the offensive. The Duisburg attorney, Immanuel Saul, was not content with defending his group's proposed statute revision; he also portrayed his Zion- ist opponents as motivated solely by political hatred for liberal Jews. For the sake of a propaganda victory, Zionists had blackened the name of all Jews by turning the Duisburg Affair into an international scandal. The liberal Geheimrat Ludwig Geiger referred to the equal rights of foreigners as "a Zionist Utopian dream," presumably because this would increase voter sup- port for Zionism. Other liberals took advantage of the controversy to impugn the motives of Zionists, charging that the latter did not really care a whit about aliens, but merely used them as a convenient instrument to flay liberals. For the Zionists, according to their opponents, were primarily interested in increasing their own power.25 Both sides waged a propaganda campaign both to win the sympathy of Jewish public opinion and also to influence government officials adjudicat- ing the affair. Several Jewish newspapers commissioned prominent attor- neys to write briefs on the legality of disenfranchising alien Jews.

Harry Epstein, Siegfried Schwarzschild, and Joseph Heimberger argued in Zionist and orthodox periodicals that the 1847 law ignored the issue of nationality when discussing Gemeinde membership simply because citizenship did not matter: the Gemeinden were "confessional organizations," and therefore a Jew's place of birth was immaterial in regard to membership and voting. Both liberals and "conservatives" forwarded reprints of these legal opinions to Prussian bureaucrats.26 Both factions also lobbied personally to sway government officials. Although most of our information on such activities comes from the archives of leading Zionists, it is possible to piece together a pattern of action on behalf of the liberal cause. Liberal notables apparently even con- vinced Duisburg's mayor to plead their case before the provincial governor. Their Zionist and orthodox opponents coordinated a national network of attorneys and rabbis who bombarded Prussian officials with copies of legal opinions arguing against disenfranchisement and regularly met with govern- ment officials. The Zionists played upon their self-styled conservatism in order to gain support from right-wing politicians. At a meeting with the governor of the Rhine Province, Harry Epstein and Max Bodenheimer, the elder statesman of German Zionism, claimed that there was often a direct correlation between religious and political affiliation: Jews of the Zionist and orthodox persuasion were politically conservative whereas most reli- gious liberals were leftward leaning in their political beliefs. Bodenheimer then proposed the formation of a political organization to unify all Jews who supported conservative politicians. This brazen bid for a quid pro quo, government support in internal Gemeinde affairs in return for Jewish sup- port of the Right in German elections, was consistent with a technique that the Zionists often employed during the voting rights controversy: they pic- 26. Michaelis first addressed the issue in the A.Z.J., May 24 and 31, 1912 (pp. 241ff. and 251ff., respectively). His article was designed to influence the Prussian government to approve the disenfranchisement of foreign Jews in Bochum. He was answered in print by Siegfried Schwarzschild (Der Israelit, March 6, 1913 and March 13, 1913); Harry Epstein (J.R., August 22, 1913, p. 353); Joseph Heimberger (Jaidische Presse, August 22, 1913). Michaelis responded to his critics in A.Z.J., December 5, and 12, 1913, which, in turn, Harry Epstein rebutted in the J.R., January 23, 1914. It is clear that Prussian officials considered these legal opinions before deciding the case. See, for example, Dfisseldorf #30567, Memorandum to the Oberprdsident dated August 19, 1913.</page><page sequence="16">200 JACK WERTHEIMER tured themselves as political conservatives and their opponents as dan- gerous radicals.27 The question of voting rights in Duisburg had thus become enmeshed with the larger political struggle between liberals and Zionists. At the outset, the affair was merely a local fracas, but, eventually, it took on national importance. With the exception of Harry Epstein, no Duisburg Jew played a role in the frenzied political and propaganda campaign after the initial sub- mission of petitions to local governors. Instead, the major spokesmen and press organs of German Zionism, orthodoxy, and liberalism dominated the affair. The issue was no longer a statute revision in one small community, but the legality of disenfranchisement throughout Prussia, and possibly other states as well. Even more important, the Duisburg Affair came to represent in microcosm the bitter struggle for power between contending German-Jewish factions. Ultimately, the state resolved both the Duisburg Affair and the larger issue of voting rights, since government officials alone were empowered to approve or reject changes in communal statutes. The local mayor and dis- trict governor could have ratified emendations to Gemeinde regulations under normal circumstances. Because the question of voting rights was now disputed throughout Prussia, these lower officials turned to their superiors for guidance. The district governor in Diisseldorf appealed to his provincial governor in Koblenz, and the latter requested a definitive ruling from Prussia's Minister of Interior.28 27. On liberal lobbying, C.Z.A. A 101/Box 7, letter by Epstein to the Berlin office of the Zionist Federation of Germany (November 24, 1913). Epstein was told by the governor in Koblenz that the mayor of Duisburg had preceded him.

The Minister of Interior ruled that Prussia's Jewry Law extended membership to all Jews, regardless of their nationality, and that the law granted voting privileges to all Gemeinde members. He therefore invalidated all communal statutes that disenfranchised foreigners. The Minister did tighten regulations in one area by requiring all newcomers, even those born in Germany, to live in a community for "several years" before exercising the active vote. (Some communities, including Duisburg, stipulated no mini- mum residence period for eligible voters.) Yet even in this minor departure, the overriding issue was residency, not citizenship; it was still illegal to dis- criminate between citizens and aliens in Gemeinde elections. The Minister, thereby, acted to maintain existing electoral practices. Presumably, this con- servative bureaucrat was motivated less by a concern for democratic pro- cedure or sympathy for immigrant Jews than by a desire to preserve the status quo.29 Following the Minister's decision, the provincial governor of the Rhine- land informed Duisburg's Representative Assembly that "there is no reason to exclude people who have lived in the community for years from the fran- chise." He then quashed proposals to disenfranchise alien Jews and the Duisburg Affair came to an end.30 The affair concluded as it had begun-with the abysmal defeat of the liberal cause. Duisburg's liberals failed to win government approval at every stage. At the outset of the affair, their bid to invalidate the election results of 1912 was rebuffed and charges of vote buying were thrown out. At the con- clusion, government officials rejected the interpretation of Prussia's Jewry in the Gemeinde for a set period of time would be granted the franchise. When this suggestion was rejected by both sides, the mayor turned to his superiors for help (Diisseldorf #30567, letter of August 19, 1913). 29. The Minister's decision is reported in C.Z.A. Alfred Klee Collection A142/79 (letter from the Oberpraisident in Koblenz to Rabbi Wolff). The Minister's decision was apparently sent to all governors. I located a copy of the decision in the files of the provincial governor in K6nigsberg (G6ttingen Archivlager [now Pr. Geheimes Staatsarchiv, Berlin-Dahlem], Rep. 2, no. 212, vol. 1, p. 374). According to Article 19 of the Duisburg communal statues, members of the Gemeinde who had not resided in the community for three years were entitled to the active, but not the passive vote; they could vote but not stand for election. 30. On the Oberprdsident's message to the Gemeinde, see letter in C.Z.A. A 142/79 from Rabbi Munk to E. Strauss, dated May 18, 1914. See also J.R., May, 1914, p. 232. The provin- cial governor required active voters to prove that they had resided in the community for three years, a stipulation that conformed with the Minister of Interior's ruling.</page><page sequence="18">202 JACK WERTHEIMER Law put forward by the liberals. In practical terms the resolution of the affair assured continued strength for Zionists and their allies: newly elected representatives of the Zionist-led coalition retained their positions of power and foreign Jews still possessed the franchise, which they might again exer- cise in support of orthodox and Zionist candidates. The liberals' defeat, however, transcended the small community of Duis- burg. By rendering a decision on voting rights in general, rather than limit- ing himself to the specific case of Duisburg, the Minister of Interior guaran- teed the franchise to all foreign Jews in Prussia. District officials rejected in quick succession several pending statute revisions aimed at stripping foreign Jews of the right to vote. These decisive actions undoubtedly discredited the entire disenfranchisement movement. Communities that had decided to imitate the Duisburg model changed their plans. There is even some evi- dence that the Prussian decision influenced Gemeinden and governments in other German states. Clearly, then, the Duisburg Affair served as a test case for all German Jewry.31 The magnitude and implications of the "conservative" victory in Duis- burg require the reexamination of some common assumptions about the conflict between liberals and Zionists in Imperial Germany. To begin with, we must recognize the critical importance of electoral politics in the rivalry between these two factions. Recent works permit ideological issues to over- shadow the political dimension of this confrontation and give the impres- sion that the liberal/Zionist struggle was conducted solely in the rarefied atmosphere of editorial offices and organizational bureaus. Voting rights controversies in communities such as Duisburg demonstrate, however, that local Gemeinden were the setting of equally decisive political contests. On the eve of World War I, Herzl's followers in Germany interpreted literally his call for "conquest of the communities," and in response liberals fought tenaciously to maintain their grip on communal offices. 31. Pending statute revisions in neighboring communities: Diisseldorf #30567, letter to the Regierungsprdsident dated October 28, 1913. Harry Epstein was particularly concerned about the impact of an adverse ruling in Prussia upon a new Jewry Law under consideration in Bavaria. (See Naomi Katzenberger, "Dokumente," p. 201 and Epstein's letter to E. Strauss in C.Z.A. A 101/Box 21, May 13, 1913.) Let us note in this context that the disenfranchisement movement was defeated only temporarily; it arose once again after World War I with even greater strength.</page><page sequence="19">THE DUISBURG AFFAIR 203 One of the few writers who noted the central importance of this power struggle was the Zionist historian Adolf Boehm: The most important authority controlled by the assimilationists was the reli- gious community (also known as the Jewish Gemeinde), the only official, pub- licly and legally recognized Jewish representation.... The Zionist program aimed to transform the Jewish religious community into a Jewish people's community [Volksgemeinde] and to build upon its foundations a broadened national self-representation. Until World War I, the rulers of the religious Gemeinden in Central and Eastern Europe countered this program by main- taining a plutocratic voting rights system under the patronage of the govern- ment.... Moreover, the communities of the West attempted-usually suc- cessfully-to bar the incoming East European Jews from the franchise.... By so doing, the assimilationist Notables could prevent the Gemeinden from becoming democratic and nationalistic [Zionist]. This policy was reactionary and un-Jewish.... It appeared grotesque that the Jewish communities remained islands of reaction while Jews stood in the vanguard of freedom fighters in all countries .... 32 The Duisburg Affair suggests the need to revise Boehm's account. His depiction of the grotesque and reactionary behavior of some liberal notables is understandable, though one-sided. There is no question that liberals fought vigorously and, at times, ruthlessly to hold onto their positions of power. Nevertheless, Boehm errs when he describes the outcome of voting rights controversies. His misconception that East European Jews were disenfranchised is shared by others and deserves to be laid to rest. In fact, notables in Duisburg and elsewhere in Prussia failed to strip East European Jews of the vote. Throughout the history of Imperial Germany, foreign Jews possessed the right to vote and hold elective office in all Prussian Gemeinden and in most other German communities as well.33 32.

For an example of such misrepresentation, see Zosa Szajkowski, "The Komitdfuir den Osten and Zionism," Herzl Yearbook, 1971, p. 199. See the following works on the voting rights of alien Jews in: Wfirttemberg: Alfred Gunzenhausen, Sammlung der Gesetze, Verordnungen, Verflagungen, und Erlasse betreffend die Kirchenverfassung und die religidsen Einrichtungen der Israeliten in Warttemberg (Stuttgart, 1909), esp. pp. 27-28 where the law of 1851 is quoted.

See also, Siegfried Wolff, Das Recht der Israelitischen Religions-Gemein-</page><page sequence="20">204 JACK WERTHEIMER There is a more subtle misrepresentation in Boehm's account, which is tacitly accepted by contemporary historians. Although recent works stress that the Zionists voiced their opinions forthrightly and at times even boister- ously, they often downplay the strength of Zionist forces and exaggerate the power of the liberals. Boehm, too, implies that liberal leaders bullied the Zionists. But our description of the Duisburg Affair makes it clear that the liberals were on the defensive in voting rights controversies. These contro- versies erupted precisely because coalitions of orthodox and Zionist groups registered impressive gains in election campaigns. The liberals' efforts to disenfranchise alien Jews were born of desperation, not strength. Their allegedly impotent Zionist foes turned the voting rights issue into a national scandal by adroitly seizing upon this issue to lambaste liberalism. Zionist and orthodox newspapers mercilessly ridiculed the liberals, leaving the latter embarrassed and humiliated. In assessing the struggle for "conquest of the communities," it must be recognized that Boehm's omnipotent "assimilationists" were at times defeated, whereas Zionists waged and won propaganda battles. This is not to suggest that the Zionists won every campaign against liberals. The par- ticular issue of voting rights was atypical in the larger struggle between Zionists and their opponents since many liberals, especially national leaders, did not sympathize with efforts to disenfranchise alien Jews and felt offend- ed by the smear campaign carried on by the Duisburg representatives. Liberal forces were far more united and assertive in other conflicts with Zionists. It is worth noting, however, that Zionists were adept at seizing an schaft des Grossherzogtums Baden (Karlsruhe, 1913), pp. 54-58, 97-98, 140.

Hesse: Leopold Katz, Die Rechtliche Stellung der Israeliten nach dem Staatskirchenrecht des Grossherzogtums Hessen (Giessen, 1906). Saxony was the only state that failed to require the enfranchisement of alien Jews. Conse- quently, some Gemeinden in that state-notably Dresden and Leipzig-never enfranchised members of the community who lacked Saxon citizenship. Another community in that state, Chemnitz, initially did grant the franchise to aliens. But early in the twentieth century that Gemeinde stripped aliens of the passive vote and, in 1913, of the active vote also. On the vague- ness of the Saxon laws, see Curt Graf, Das Recht der Israelitischen Religions-Gemeinschaft in Sachsen (Frankfurt, 1914), p. 35. On developments in Chemnitz, C.Z.A.

The Zionist victory in Duisburg also requires us to reconsider Boehm's sweeping assertion that "the plutocratic voting rights system [was] under the patronage of the government." The voting rights controversy demonstrates the very reverse. Prussian bureaucrats rejected the undemocratic position espoused by liberals and compelled Gemeinden to enfranchise all members, thereby siding with the insurgent coalition of Zionist and orthodox Jews rather than with the notables. The crucial role played by Prussian officials in resolving the Duisburg Affair provides us with an additional insight into the communal history of Jews in Imperial Germany. The government intervened even in matters that appear to concern only internal communal affairs. State officials regulated virtually all aspects of communal life-whether they concerned Jewish poli- tics, education, charity, rabbis and religious functionaries, or Gemeinde statutes, for states created and supervised the Gemeinde system. Any account of the "internal" affairs of Central European Jewry, therefore, must consider the "external" context of governmental laws and bureaucratic interference.34 Yet just as the affair underscores the need to broaden our scope to include the role of the government, it also illustrates the value of examining national issues from the perspective of smaller communities. To date, his- torians have paid scant attention to local issues and instead have focused on the national leadership of German Jewry. Such a comprehensive approach is laudable, but now that we possess a broad overview, details need to be filled in. We know little concerning the role played by the rank-and-file in liberal/Zionist struggles, the sensitivity of national leaders in both camps to the concerns and needs of their followers, and the extent to which ideologi- cal disagreements between national leaders affected and reflected communal politics on the grass-roots level. Certainly, the concerns of Jews in small Gemeinden tend to appear narrow and parochial compared with dramas enacted on the national stage. Due to the petty behavior of some local Jews, the Duisburg Affair often teetered between drama and farce. Nonetheless, after studying the responses of small communities to national controversies, we may alter our perceptions of the larger issues. 34. German state, provincial and municipal archives possess rich collections of documents that shed light on Jewish communal affairs. To date, few Jewish historians have tapped these invaluable resources.</page><page sequence="22">206 JACK WERTHEIMER In the case of the Duisburg Affair, we can learn what conflict between liberals and Zionists meant on the grass-roots level. Whereas national leaders and major organizations were preoccupied with ideological debates and party resolutions, Jews in small communities waged bitter electoral battles. For liberals and Zionists in communities such as Duisburg, the con- frontation was not only over ideas, but power. At bottom, nothing less was at stake than political domination of the Gemeinde.
