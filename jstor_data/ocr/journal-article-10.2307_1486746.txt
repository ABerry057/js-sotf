Haynes's scholarly book is a serious reflection of the Jew in the imagination of the Christian. Haynes uses the term "witness-people myth" to capture the Christian vision of the Jews through the ages. What is central to this vision is that Christians through the ages have not thought of Jews as normal, typical human beings. The Jews, according to Christian myth, are characterized by a polarity of negative and positive characteristics. The negative view stems from the fact that the Jews killed Christ. The positive aspect is that in spite of being the killers of God, the Jews nevertheless remain the people of God, chosen by God. The thesis of Haynes's book is summarized in the statement by Karl Barth which serves as the book's epigraph and provides its title: [The Jews] could and can disappear just as little as God's faithfulness can come to an end. . . . This continued existence of the Jews which is so puzzling is a sign which cannot be ignored. . . . Yet they are no more than the shadow of a nation, the reluctant witnesses of the Son of God and Son of Man ... whom they rejected, yet who has not ceased to call them.' In the first three chapters, Haynes develops this thesis in detail. He is especially strong in exploring the myth in the New Testament, the Church Fathers, particularly Augustine, the Middle Ages, and the Reformation, especially emphasizing Luther. Haynes concludes his overview with modem secular versions of the myth. In chapters 4 and 5 Haynes presents a thorough and convincing analysis of the manifestations of this myth in the works of the great Christian theologian Karl Barth and of the prominent American novelist and philosopher Walker Percy. Chapter 7 is devoted to exploring the myth in the writings of such evangelicals as Hal Lindsey, Jerry Falwell, and Pat Robertson. The most interesting, and for me most problematic, part of the book is chapter 6, in which Haynes deals with some of the major Christian theolo- gians who have confronted the Holocaust. He argues that these theologians perpetuate the witness-people myth in their theology. Among those whom 1.

Roy Eckardt, Robert Everett, and James Moore. Although he is aware of their respect for Jewish tradition, he argues that their theology has "deep connections with the witness-people myth" (p. 136). For Haynes the affinity between the Christian Holocaust theology and the witness-people myth is evident in the theology's stress on the Jews as God's chosen people set apart from the rest of humanity. Haynes's statement about Paul van Buren is representative: "The assumption that Jews were and are God's elect people is beginning, middle, and end in van Buren's theology" (p. 139). Although Haynes is aware of the differences between the myth as it has been manifested throughout history and the Christian Holocaust theologians' attitudes toward Judaism, I do not feel that he sees clearly the radical nature of the differences. The fact is that Christian Holocaust theologians have strongly rejected the view that the Jews are responsible for the death of Christ and also the view that Judaism is not a valid religious tradition. This new theology of Judaism seems to me to be a radical break from the traditional witness-people myth, in spite of the fact that some affinities remain. Haynes's book takes a phenomenological approach. His aim is not to support or discredit the witness-people myth. However, in his conclusion it becomes clear that he believes that the ambivalent Christian attitude toward Jews is a danger to the Jewish people. Haynes does not see much hope for change in the Christian image of the Jew as long as both Jews and Christians continue to hold to the eternal election of the Jewish people. Haynes seems to believe that for change to come about, the Jews would have to give up the concept of the chosen-as have Richard L. Rubenstein and the Reconstructionist Movement in Judaism. Since Haynes realizes that this is not about to occur, he feels that the witness-people myth will continue to be pervasive. I believe that Christian Holocaust theology departs radically from the traditional Christian view. Although I disagree with Haynes's analysis of the Christian Holocaust theologians, I find this book very helpful in understanding Christian per- ceptions of Jews through the ages. I recommend his book for courses on Jewish-Christian relations. Harold Kasimow Grinnell College Grinnell, Iowa</page></plain_text>
