<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jose Luis Lacave. Medieval Ketubot from Sefarad. Hispania Judaica 11, ed. H. Beinart et al. Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 2002. 268 pp. Professor Jose Luis Lacave collected thirty ketubot (marriage contracts) from various medieval Hispanic kingdoms. These ketubot were found in different libraries and archives. Most of the documents have been published before, some of them by Lacave himself. Three are published here for the first time. The author examined the ketubot and made a detailed comparison between them. Twelve ketubot are from Catalan (most of these are from Barcelona); four are from Majorca; nine are from Navarre (most of these from Tudela); four are from Castile; one is from Toledo. All were written during the thirteenth through fifteenth centuries. 364</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews In the first chapter the author gives a general description of the documents and the texts. This description includes: the name of the library; catalogue num- ber; date of signing of the document; size of the parchment; general context; kind of script; first publication, and so forth. In the second chapter the author deals with the historical background of each document. He provides details of the date, dowry, dowry increment, usual gift, and the separate gift. Additional information is supplied about the groom and his fam- ily, the bride and her family, the witnesses, the guaranties, and the judges. The third chapter discusses the structure and content of the ketubot, their decoration, and their preamble. He also gives information about the formularies of the date, the place where the ketubah was signed, and other formularies of the Jew- ish contract as an acquisition, and the signatures of the witnesses. The next chapter includes an analysis of the dowry's parts and a comparison between them. We also read about a unique formula that is written on the same parchment together with the text of the ketubah, "the receipt for the dowry." The groom acknowledges having received all the money stipulated in the dowry. The fifth chapter deals with the conditions of the ketubah. The chapter is di- vided into several sections. The first section discusses the ketubah's guarantee, that is, that the groom commits himself and his property to fulfill what is stipulated in the ketubah. The next section deals with the separate gift. The following section deals with the bride price (mohar) and the question of whether it is required by bib- lical sanction or rabbinical law. The chapter concludes with some other conditions of the ketubah including oath, fine, trust, and others. The sixth chapter contains a brief discussion about the levirate ketubah. In the last part of the book the author brings the text of the ketubot and dis- plays photographs of each document. Professor Lacave, a leading expert on the material remains of Spanish Jew- ry, has provided very important research in his book. He enriches us with instruc- tive information culled from the collection of ketubot. Here are a few examples. Since the signatures of the same witnesses appear on many documents, we can as- sume that these people were professional notaries (p. 31). The Barcelona 2 ketubah was signed in Barcelona only one year before the assault on the juderia of Barcelona (August, 1391) (p. 32). The Majorca 3 ketubah was signed six months before the assault and sacking of the Jewish quarter in this city (p. 47). The bride mentioned in the Barcelona 4 ketubah died without children a few years after the wedding (p. 34). In many cases numerous witnesses signed the ketubah (pp. 47, 49). The author claims that the two family names Azafar and Amarillo are one and the same (p. 60). A grandson of the bride's father was probably the famous fish trader of Tudela (p. 63). One of the ketubot was signed in the city Segura de Leon, which was a leading economic force in the province of Badajoz. It was probably for that reason that Isaac Abravanel took refuge there and lived there for a while (p. 71). When one bride presented her ketubah before the court, demanding her dowry, the court ordered two converted Jews to translate it into Castilian (p. 72). Against Maimonides' ruling (Ishut 10:14), no less than half of our ketubot are dat- ed on Friday, which was probably the day on which the rabbinical court met (pp. 77-78). The author notes a development related to titles of the groom. In the 365</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews thirteenth and fourteenth centuries his name is preceded by the title "Rabbi," whereas at the end of the fifteenth century he is called "the pleasant young man" or "the charming young man" (p. 79). In one case the bride was preceded by the title: "the gracious gazelle" (p. 80). The professions of the parties and their an- tecedents were not customarily indicated. Only in two cases do we read that one of the parents was a physician (p. 80). The place of residence is mentioned only when the parties live in different places (p. 80). Like other contracts, the ketubah must conclude with the formula "and everything is firm and stable" (p. 81). Like- wise, it includes the acquisition formula "and we the witnesses have received the acquisition from Rabbi So-and-So" (p. 82). The author also analyzes the differ- ences among the ketubot of the different kingdoms. In the Navarrese ketubot the witnesses bring the groom's speak in the first person; the female is referred to "this wife of mine" and not "the bride" as in some other provinces (p. 87). A very im- portant question is whether there is any connection between the amount of the dowry that was brought by the bride and the dowry increment, which is the groom's additional obligation; according to the Catalan ketubot, there is (p. 91). As men- tioned above, the receipt for the dowry was sometimes written on the same parch- ment as the ketubah. This was common in Catalonia but less so in Navarre (p. 95). Also the groom waives making any claim in the future to any amount of the dowry (p. 97). In order to reinforce the guarantee, the contract may include an endorse- ment of the guarantee by a guarantor, generally, the groom's father, so that if the groom does not pay his debt, the bride can collect it from the guarantor (p. 105). In some cases the groom reinforces his guarantee by an oath (p. 106). One of the interesting phenomena in our collection is the separate gift, an issue discussed by previous scholars. Here we can see that the amount of this gift is not equivalent to the whole amount of the ketubah but only to the dowry increment or even less (p. 205). There was also historical development here: In our collection this gift is written on the same parchment as the ketubah, in contrast to what was done in pre- vious centuries. Among the additional conditions in the ketubah we find the groom's promise not to marry another wife while still married to the first one; not to divorce her against her will; and not to leave the place where the couple live without her consent (p. 134). Another clause deals with the dowry. It states that if the wife dies without children, the husband is obliged to return to her family an amount equal to half of the dowry (p. 135). Only in a few regions do we find the stipulation in which the groom's brother promises to grant halizah to the bride should circumstances requiring this arise (p. 151). At this point I would like to make some comments. 1. Generally, it would have been better to have combined the two first chap- ters into one. 2. The author failed to discuss two important published ketubot: one from Villa del Rey, published by S. Abramson, in Tractate Abodah Zarah (New York: The Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1957), p. 132; and the Cairo Ge- niza document from Valencia, published by E. Ashtor, Sefarad, XXIV (1964), pp. 73-74. 3. The sentence: "A widow without children" (p. 69) is incorrect. Correct is: "A widow, whose late husband died without children". 366</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 4. In connection to the ketubah, the translation "shoshbin" as "an agent" is superior to "best man" (p. 84). 5. "The dowry remains by law, the property of the husband in case of divorce ." (p. 86). According to Talmudic law (Yebamot 66b) the wife can demand this property as a part of the ketubah payment. 6. The author writes that the ketubah was signed "between the betrothal and the wedding" (p. 144), but he does not explain why. This follows the Talmudic rule (Ketubbot 83a) that a husband who wishes to waive his rights must do so before the wedding. 7. The self-imprisonment mentioned in some ketubot (pp. 242; 244) was not analyzed by the author. This is a very important subject that was dealt with by RI- VASH (responsum no. 484). 8. The clause about the Sabbatical year mentioned in some ketubot (pp. 171; 174), discussed by some scholars, could be a great contribution to research. 9. Polygyny was dealt with by Professor M. A. Friedman. Lacave mentions the subject (p. 134), but does not analyze it nor mention Friedman's discussions. Finally, some technical comments: 1. It would have been helpful to include a map with the regions and cities mentioned in the documents. 2. There are many printing errors, especially in the Hebrew text. I supply only a few examples: On page 87, the text should read: inn~s innin; on page 89, the text should read: pu'wlrnm; on page 93: mnvnuan; on page 110: ps'Irn ln ]prt; on page 111, the words: 1p Inn -pmrn~ ' 1 " L1K a5nx are not in the right place; on page 113, the Hebrew text was truncated; on page 128, in the first Hebrew paragraph: poln, n ,n1n1 ,7'1nvn; on page 167: x5i-, and so forth. Despite these shortcomings, Lacave's book greatly expands our knowledge of the Jewish marriage contract. This book is a very significant contribution to the study of Jewish law, including such issues as Jewish society, the Jewish family, the interaction between Jews and their surroundings, and so forth.
