<plain_text><page sequence="1">David Novak. The Theology of Nahmanides Systeniatically Presented. Brown Judaic Studies, no. 271. Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1992. xiv, 149 pp. David Novak's book systematically presents the theology of Nahmanides (Ramban) in eight chapters. Nahmanides' views on the human soul, faith, tradition, miracles, the natural and the supernatural, Eretz Israel, ta 'amei ha-mitzvot ("the reasons for the commandments"), and eschatology are clearly and crisply presented. Novak proceeds in each chapter by means of a commentary on and/or explication of illustrative texts. In general, the texts employed are from the Commentary on the Torah, Nahmanides' crowning achievement, which he completed shortly before his death in Eretz Israel in 1270. I suspect that Novak's system of enumeration of texts will henceforth</page><page sequence="2">418 BOOK REVIEWS facilitate references to Nahlmanides' work; thus, CT: Lev. 19:1-II,15, referring to Nahmanides' Commentary on the Torah in Chavel's edition, may become Nalhmanides 7.3 (Novak). While a certain loss of specificity is to be noted, it surely beats having to haul around Chavel's multivolume edition. In sum, Novak's Summa presents a fine overview of NaIhmanides' theology in a felicitous translation. Novak's book was written expressly to explicate an understanding of Nalhmanides' theology for contemporary theologians, those committed to the project of constructive Jewish theology in our day. Novak's project, therefore, is a normative, nonhistorical, one. He writes: "In attempting to adopt the methodological model of the classical codifiers [of Jewish law], I am expressing a commitment to the view that theology is a normative task for Jewish thinkers today" (p. xii). The very strength of Novak's systematic presentation of Nahmanides' theology creates a paradox at the heart of the book. The paradox is perhaps best illustrated by comparing Novak's book with a book like G. M. A. Grube's Plato's Thought.' The latter work presents in a systematic way, albeit without illustrative texts, the metaphysical, epistemological, moral, etc., views of a wholly unsystematic thinker, Plato. The comparison is revealing because for Novak, Nalhmanides too is an unsystematic thinker. Novak writes of Nalhmanides: ". . . had he presented a strictly kabbalistic theology, the richness of his approach would have been much diminished. His eclecticism allows a diversity of the types and methods of interpretation; and it is precisely as an exegete that he is best understood. A comprehensive system would have narrowed his exegetical options" (p. 15). And so, the paradox of Novak's book, a systematic presentation of an unsystematic thinker. The question for both Grube and Novak thus becomes: how much is lost in presenting an unsystematic thinker systematically? Certainly one loses the heuristic (exploratory) and dialectical flavor of their approach, the interplay (the "eclecticism") between different modes of presentation. In the case of Nahmanides, the interplay between philosophy and kabbalah, the very hallmark of his exegetical method, is diminished by adopting the model of the codifiers of the law. The paradox I have noted is, of course, motivated by Novak's desire to present Nalhmanides for contemporary theologians. Given this and his consequent adoption of the model of the classical codifiers, the 1. 2nd ed., Indianapolis: Hackett, 1980.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 419 paradox is inevitable. It is to Novak's credit that he is clearly cognizant of the conundrum. But again, for a reader coming to the book from a non-normative, historical (or literary) background, a background opposite to that of Novak's explicit audience, the paradox will remain not only unresolved, but troubling. Novak tends to play Nahmanides off against his predecessor, Maimonides. The former is unsystematic, the latter is systematic; the former is the great compromiser between the dictates of philosophy and of kabbalah, the latter is systematically philosophical. The contrast between Nahmanides and Mai- monides is, I think, overdrawn. Maimonides is not such a philosophical system builder as Novak suggests. Maimonides is fully alive to the importance of historical, nonphilosophical, explanations in explicating ta 'amei ha-nmitzvot (e.g., Guide 3.32); indeed, Novak himself says that "Maimonides does invoke history when explaining some of the lIiuqqim" (p. 9). And though Novak wishes to understand such historical explanations as subserving universal, perennial concerns which Maimonides wishes to underscore, this is not to deny the foundational role of history for Maimonides in any viable explanation of the law (especially huqqim) and our obedience to it. Readers will wish to compare Novak's claim (pp. 9-10) that for Maimonides, the huqqim are from a philosophical perspective the least important of the three types of commandments (contra Nahmanides, for whom, according to Novak, the huqqim are the most important on account of "their very mystery" [p. 10], their unphilosophical nature) with Josef Stern's quite opposite claim as to the emblematic nature of the (historical) huqqini for Maimonides.2 Indeed, it is Nahmanides who, in understanding the hzuqqinm as shrouded in "mystery," has recourse to the ahistorical mysteries of the kabbalah. My apology on behalf of Maimonides is not meant to detract from the real differences between Nahmanides and Maimonides, which Novak well brings out. Clearly the kabbalistic influence upon Nahmanides is a major non-Maimonidean moment. But in accepting kabbalah over philosophy as the deepest teaching of the Torah, it no longer is obvious to me who, Nahmanides or Maimonides, places "precedence of datum over theory" (p. 15).
