Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2004. xi, 293 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S036400940700030X Robert Kawashima asks a perennial though pertinent question: What is it that makes Hebrew Bible storytelling so compelling, so special? In other words, what are the Bible's "literary origins," and how does it compare to its predecessors and contemporaries? To answer, Kawashima makes the following moves. His introduction immediately puts forward his premise: that the Hebrew Bible is unique not for confessional but for literary reasons. In this introduction, he sets out further assumptions and arguments: that biblical narrative, as he summarizes, constitutes "a radical break between the Bible and epic by ... a shift from the medium of the spoken to the written word" (14). To show this, he describes biblical literature against the backdrop of Homeric and Greek epics, on one hand, and modem literary theory?especially that of storytelling and the novel?on the other. In that journey, Kawashima makes it easier for readers to follow his intellectual and scholarly background?or kit bag, if you wish?by stating the theoretical resources he uses in his acknowledgments, as well as by supplying extensive mortos at the beginning of each chapter. Chapter 2, "From Song to Story" (17-34), is a case study analysis of Judges 4 and 5. In it, Kawashima arrives at the conclusion that the characterization is typical of a written mode: "Biblical narrative comes after [Walter] Benjamin's storyteller, after the epic rhapsode" (34). Chapter 3 deals with "Narration and Discourse" (35-76), making a distinction in written storytelling (i.e., literature) between language and discourse and discussing the implications for biblical as opposed to Homeric or Ugaritic literature. He concludes that the biblical story tellers "uncannily anticipate^] the modem novel" (76). Chapter 4 examines how consciousness is represented in biblical narratives (77-123). Represented consciousness in the Bible is seen as a "historical innovation" (111), and space is properly given to the issue of syntax as opposed to context, with an engagement of Berlin and Anderson's analyses (114 ff). Chapter 5 is about "Biblical Time and Epic Time" (124-60). Homeric time is characterized as linear in its forward move ments, whereas biblical time is historical and simultaneous in its innovative temporality. In Chapter 6, Kawashima discusses the "Art of Biblical Narrative as Technique" (161-89): In analyzing the literary convention known as the "type-scene," especially the Hero's Birth annunciation scene, Kawashima uses Walter Benjamin's notions about storytelling and Shklovsky's concept of "defami liarization" to distinguish between the epic/oral and the biblical/written modes. He concedes that both share certain traditions, but he points to different techniques and achievements. Chapter 7 is his conclusion (190-214). Here, finally, the issue of biblical religion is discussed, focusing on the conception of God that emerges from the biblical narrative. Here, we are not surprised to learn that this conception is novel and rather discontinuous with neighboring cultures. Kawashima attempts an admittedly modest "archaeology of ancient Israelite knowledge" (197); 176</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews pmdently, although he believes in early monotheism, he does not go beyond what he calls preliminary evidence of biblical literary modes for the subject. An examin ation of Genesis 1-11 titled "Monotheistic Mythology" (200-10) is followed by a short section called "?criture Biblique" that characterizes, finally, biblical storytell ing as a written form advancing the novel "knowledge of a transcendent God, of history, of the human subject" (214). Endnotes (215-67), bibliography (269-84), and a general index (285-93) follow. There is, unfortunately, no index of biblical and other ancient sources. Especially because Kawashima's extensive and compara tive use of cognate sources, such an index would have been welcome. Kawashima takes notions of orality and writing as applied to the Hebrew Bible beyond the current state of the debate. I am not sure that his assumptions and theorizing are always convincing, but nevertheless I find them thought pro voking. Reading the Bible against or with ancient cognates?"Semitic" or Helle nic?is certainly not new. Cassuto and others in his footsteps have shown that such readings may support notions of biblical continuity with previous and contem poraneous literatures, as well as a break from them. However, the strength of Kawashima's book, for this reader, is his insistence (at times apologetic) on the methodological legitimacy, even desirability, of analyzing biblical storytelling as literature. In comparison to modemist literary forms such as the novel, I see no "ana chronism" here, only advantages for understanding biblical literature from a reader response perspective. Extending the comparative field is both welcome and enligh tening. I'm also deeply impressed by his usage of nonbiblical knowledge bases of literary theory, as well as biblical scholarship?although here I do find some lacunae, such as the works of Yairah Amit and Frank Polak on biblical storytelling and discourse and James Barr on biblical "time," among others. In general, then, I found this book emdite and instinctive?with a serious reservation. I am a deeply nonconfessional Bible scholar and student: I love the Bible (not all of it, though!), not only as part of my heritage but also for its literary qualities. However, it is clear to me that at least a certain measure of the bible's perceived literary excellence is anchored in the reader's (also mine) confessional or cultural bias in its favor. In other words, the notion of "novelty" heavily and ideologically links the medium with the message, as becomes clear in Kawashima's final chapter. Although this chapter is named "Conclusion," it broaches an almost completely new area, that of monotheism and the Bible as literature of the sacred; discussion of difference and technique remain at the background. This is less a conclusion in the sense of recapping previous arguments and more an "implications" section. And it belies the admiration for the Hebrew Bible's literary qualities for a nontheoretical component. Therefore, I doubt that Kawashima is exempt from a bias that enforces notions of biblical novelty, great ness, and achievement that are extrinsic to his literary analysis.
