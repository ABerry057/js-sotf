New York: Continuum, 2001. xx, 821 pp. This set of interrelated studies is full of closely reasoned analyses and bold but careful speculation. Several of these studies provide a model, almost unique within biblical studies, of how to integrate biblical and extra-biblical data within a framework deeply informed by theory. The book is intended for specialists with expertise in technical details the book addresses but rarely pauses to describe. This work's breadth is noteworthy. It contains lengthy studies of Israelite cult places uncovered by archaeologists (not only familiar ones such as Arad and Beer- sheva, but also smaller and less well-known enclosures and tumuli throughout the areas in which ancient Israelites lived), cult items (altars, figurines, cult stands), inscriptions, as well as historiographic and prophetic texts from the Hebrew Bible. Zevit emphasizes that there were many forms of religious practice in ancient Is- rael, that various gods were worshipped in motley settings, that worshipers of YHWH may often have worshipped other deities as well, and-most significant- ly-that one can appreciate the varieties of religious experience in ancient Israel only by coordinating the data that come from the full range of texts, artifacts, and perspectives this study utilizes. New insights regarding specific issues abound. Space permits only a few ex- amples. Zevit's discussion of the origin of the Israelites (pp. 84-121) is one of the finest treatments of this controversial issue available. His mastery of archaeolog- ical and textual data is perhaps unmatched by other scholars who write on this sub- ject, most of whom focus on one type of evidence and are embarrassingly unfa- miliar with responsible use of the others. Zevit concludes that a significant discontinuity between the Late Bronze and Iron Age populations of the highlands of Canaan emerges from several different types of evidence. It follows that the Is- raelites did not originate in Canaan, though significant elements of the Canaanite populations were absorbed into Israel early in the period of the monarchy. The range of evidence used by Zevit and the methodological self-consciousness with which he analyzes it render this discussion one of the most convincing ever pub- lished. The lengthy analysis of Hebrew inscriptions is full of new readings and in- terpretations, which cannot be treated here. The most significant suggestion Zevit makes is that phrases like lyhwh wl's'rth in the Kuntillet cAjrud and related in- scriptions refer not to YHWH and His partner, the goddess Asherah (which is, as he notes in his painstaking review of the literature, grammatically impossible), nor to YHWH and His cult-pole, but to YHWH and the goddess named Asheratah, whose relationship to YHWH is not spelled out in the phrase itself. Zevit proposes a startling new view of the Elohistic Psalter (Psalms 42-83). Most scholars believe that the tetragrammaton has been replaced throughout this 159</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews collection by the appellation 'elohim, perhaps due to the tendency of post-exilic Judeans to avoid pronouncing the former. Zevit rejects this explanation because the tetragrammaton's occasional presence in these psalms suggests that it has not been systematically removed. Because some texts found in the Book of Psalms seem to have existed outside Israel as prayers to other gods (for example, Psalm 20 occurs in an Aramaic version as a prayer to Baal/Horus), Zevit proposes that the divine names removed from the Elohistic Psalter were names of gods other than YHWH who were worshipped in Israelite sanctuaries. As polytheistic worship be- came more problematic for some Israelites, the replacement of these names by the vague term 'elohim allowed these psalms to continue in use in a less controversial way, and ultimately allowed them to be read as monotheistic texts. Unfortunately, several factors will limit the usability, and hence the impact, of this work. In spite of its subtitle, this anthology does not synthesize the conclu- sions of the many individual studies it contains. It remains, rather, a collection of highly detailed discussions, united by their insistence on utilizing a wide range of material but never achieving the unity a book has. (One might contrast, say, Yehezkel Kaufmann's eight-volume history of Israelite religion or Rainer Albertz's two-volume history. Both contain extraordinarily detailed treatments of specific issues, but they marshal all these details on behalf of a larger thesis, so that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.) Aggravating this lack of synthesis is the absence of a detailed table of contents. It will be difficult for readers to know where topics that interest them in this encyclopedic work are located. (How would a student of Psalms know that the chapter entitled "Israelite Religions: A Paral- lactic Synthesis" contains what amounts to a twenty-page article on the origin of the Elohistic Psalter? How would a person researching social structure know that the same chapter begins with a forty-page article on tribalism?) Moreover, the ab- sence of a detailed table of contents makes it difficult to discern whether there is any overall trajectory to the work, much less what it is. This difficulty is made more acute by Zevit's fairly consistent refusal to include anything resembling a thesis statement at the beginning of most chapters, sections, and sub-sections. Each hits the ground running, but where we are running is rarely made clear. This work con- tains impressive amounts of data, but the point of the data is not often articulated. Sometimes it is not evident that there is a specific point at all: parts of this work belong to the genre of antiquarian research rather than historiography. This work provides a fine example of how to pursue research in the history of ancient Israel and its religions. Alas, it does not provide a model of how to pub- lish the results. Benjamin D.
