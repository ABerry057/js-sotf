It is intertwined with a second story, namely, the formation of Ashkenazic Jewish identity.2 Efforts to codify a body of law are tied necessarily to questions of political This article was written in memory of my teacher, Professor Isadore Twersky. It was first presented as a lecture at the conference on "Ashkenaz: Theory and Nation," sponsored by the Jagiellonian Univer- sity of Cracow and Ohio State University. Neil Jacobs's questions in his keynote address on the geog- raphy of Ashkenaz shaped the exposition in this article. A later version was presented as a lecture at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. I thank the audience at both lectures for their useful ques- tions and suggestions. Elhanan Reiner, Adam Teller, and Jeffrey Woolf helped clarify for me some of the issues discussed in the article. I thank Ernest Davis and Joel Hecker for bibliographical assistance. I also thank the staffs of the Gratz College library and the library of the Center for Judaic Studies in Philadelphia (the former Dropsie College). The errors are, of course, my own. 1.

An excellent recent study of identity-formation among a group of early modern Jews is Miri- am Bodian, Hebrews of the Portuguese Nation: Conversos and Community in Early Modern Amsterdam (Bloomington, IN, 1997). The formation of Polish Jewish identity was the topic of Adam Teller's lec- ture, "Yeven Metzula and the Formation of Jewish Self-Consciousness in Eastern Europe," which I was privileged to hear, and which is expected to appear in Jewish History in a special issue on the massacres of 1648.

It can erase local differences and serve a universalizing goal. Or, by giving local differences written form and official sanction, it can serve to defeat universalizing trends in the law, and preserve and foster a sense of local or regional identity. Throughout Europe-in France, the Low Countries, Spain, England, Ger- many, Poland, and the Ottoman Empire-the sixteenth century was an age of le- gal codification.4 In England, Richard Morison wrote to King Henry VIII in the 1530s, proposing that "the common laws of this your realm that now be unwritten might be written, that now be dispersed and uncertain might be gathered together and made certain.""5 A few years earlier, the Polish parliament decreed that "all the customs, laws, and ancient statutes should be gathered from every province, that we may begin the reformation of the entire constitution."6 Consuetudines Terrae Cracoviae ("The Customs of the Land of Cracow") had already been published in 1506.7 Five years after the appearance of the Shulhan 'Arukh, in 1569, an enor- mous legal code, the Recopilaci6n des Leyes, was published in Castile. Each of these efforts strengthened certain political identities and weakened others. The boundary between England and Wales was weakened in the sixteenth century by the extension of English common law to that region.8 In the Polish 3.

But who is an Ashkenazic Jew? To whom do the strictures of Isserles' commentary apply? Whose customs did Isserles codify? A variety of answers, some complementary, some contradictory, were of- fered to these questions by sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Jews during the conflict over the reception of the Shulhan 'Arukh. It was suggested that the Ashke- nazim were the descendents of a group of common ancestors; that they were the Jews who lived in Germany, Ashkenaz; that they were those who lived throughout Central and Eastern Europe; that they were Yiddish-speaking Jews; or even, for the purposes of Jewish law, that they were exactly those Jews whose communities ac- cepted the authority of Isserles' code. Three Sixteenth-Century Theories of the Ashkenazic Community It is when one goes abroad and lives among strangers that one's identity is apt to be challenged. Ashkenazic Jews living in Central and Eastern Europe in the early modern period did not frequently need to ask themselves who was and who was not an Ashkenazic Jew. Those living in Mediterranean lands, however, were forced to address this question. Beginning in the fourteenth century, after the Black Death and the massacres of German Jews that followed in its wake, communities of Central European Jews began to be established around the Mediterranean.12 By the mid-sixteenth centu- ry, there were communities in Mantua, Verona, Venice, Rome, and some other Ital- ian cities; in Salonika, Constantinople, Adrianople, and a few other places in the Balkans and Greece; and in the land of Israel, in Jerusalem and Safed.13 liament, 1543-1624," in Law and Government under the Tudors: Essays Presented to Sir Geoffrey El- ton, ed.

We may begin with Karo. The author of the Shulhan 'Arukh yearned for the unification of Jewish practice, and strongly favored the customs of the Spanish Jews.18 Karo should not be seen, however, as denying the legitimacy of local cus- ha-i ha-Balqani ba-me'ot ha-15 veha-16," and Leah Bornstein, "Ha-Ashkenazim ba-Imperyah ha-Oth- manit ba-me'ot ha-16 veha-17," both in Mi-Mizrah umi-Ma'arav 1 (1974), 59-79, 81-104; Abraham David, "Qavim li-demuto shel ha-qehilah ha-Ashkenazit bi-Yerushalayim ba-me'ah ha-16," Sixth World Congress of Jewish Studies, vol. 2, Hebrew sec., pp. 331-341; Minna Rozen, Ha-Qehilah ha-Yehudit bi-Yerushalayim ba-me 'ah ha-17 (Tel Aviv, 1985), pp. 99-102; Moses Shulvass, "Dos Ashkenazishe Yidntum in Italye," Yivobleter 34 (1950), 157-181 (also published in English as "Ashkenazic Jewry in Italy," YIVO Annual of Jewish Social Science 7 (1952), 110-131). 14.

The Ashkenazic communities of Central and Eastern Europe were not generally divided into separate co-territorial Jewish communities. Thus, for instance, there was no community of German or Polish Jews in Prague. An exception was the Jewish community of Cracow, which in the early sixteenth century was divided for some time into separate Polish and Bohemian communities.

See Ta-Shma, "Rabbi Joseph Caro and his Beit Yosef" (above n. 1). Benayahu (YosefBeiri, p. 28; cf. p. 140) suggests that Karo "wished the Sefardim to exercise hegemony" in Safed. In 1555, Karo was involved in a conflict with Moses b. Joseph of Trani (MaBIT) over a case in which Karo re- jected a custom observed by the pre-Sefardic (Musta'arabic) community of Safed.

He accepted certain variations in customs (he could hardly have done oth- erwise; the principle has a firm grounding in talmudic law). Specifically, he ac- cepted local stringencies, humrot, but not local leniencies, qulot. His hope, that is, was not for complete uniformity of practice throughout the Jewish world, but for a baseline of required behavior, to which local communities would add further de- tails and regulations according to their desire and in keeping with local circum- stances, but from which they could not detract.19 Karo's view of the multi-ethnic Jewish community, with its diverse sub- communities and their diverse customs, is less clear. In some of his responsa he endorsed the legitimacy of ethnic subcommunities. Nevertheless, in his commen- tary to Maimonides' Mishneh Torah he cast doubt on their halakhic status, and seemed to conclude, as Maimonides had, that in one city, one Jewish court and one set of customs should prevail.20 Karo's objections to local halakhic pluralism took a particularly sharp form in a responsum that he wrote early in his career, before he settled in the land of Is- rael, when he was still a rabbi in Nikopolis (a town in what is today Bulgaria).21 He was asked by the Jews of Pleven, a nearby town, whether the community should follow Ashkenazic stringencies in the laws of ritual slaughter. Karo answered that they should not. He argued that even Ashkenazic Jews who had immigrated to Pleven were permitted to abandon their native stringencies and adopt the customs of their new home. Even if a majority of the Jews of Pleven, he added, were Ashke- nazic immigrants, they were still permitted to adopt the local leniencies, because they had immigrated one family at a time, and as soon as each family arrived, it lost its former status and became part of the Pleven community.22 That is, Ashkenazic identity, for the young Karo, was tied exclusively to place of residence. An "Ashkenazic Jew" was exactly one who lived in the Ashkenazic 19. See Karo's introduction to Beit Yosef: "If in certain lands, they are accustomed to forbid cer- tain things, even though we shall decide the law to the contrary, they should hold fast to their custom, for they have already accepted the words of the sage who forbade it, and it is prohibited to them." Cf. Jose Faur in Raphael, Rabi Yosef Qaro, pp. 192-193. 20. See Karo's comment in KesefMishneh on Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot 'Avodat Kokhavim 12:14, and his criticism of the view of R. David ben Hayyim of Corfu. Contrast, however, She'elot u-teshuvot 'Avqat rokhel nos. 32 and 191, and see below n. 32 on the principle, invoked by Karo in these responsa, that an ethnic community may be considered a "city unto itself." There are a number of expressions by Ottoman Jews in this period of the principle that the Jews of a single local- ity ought to be united and observe a single set of customs. For instance, a sixteenth-century communal statute of the Jews in S6rrai in Macedonia prohibited anyone from forming a competing synagogue in that place. See Rivka Cohen, Qushta-Saloniqi-Patros (above n. 17), p. 148. 21. Joseph Karo, She 'elot u-teshuvot 'Avqat rokhel, no. 212 (ed. New York, 1959, p. 193).

This theory of the legal status of immigrants was made more flexible by Samuel de Medi- na in his responsum 40 on Yoreh de 'ah. He distinguished between immigration by isolated individuals (to whom Karo's rule would apply) and immigration en masse by a group, whose members keep their ethnic status and form a separate new community of their own. On de Medina, see Morris Goodblatt, Jewish Life in Turkey in the XVI Century: As Reflected in the Legal Writings of Samuel de Medina (New York, 1952), but the work should be used with caution. 255</page><page sequence="6">Joseph Davis lands. An Ashkenazic Jew in Pleven was, for the purposes of Jewish law, no longer Ashkenazic. A different point of view was represented in Safed by a young scholar born in Egypt to a mixed Ashkenazic-Sefardic family: R. Isaac Luria, the Ari. In a much- quoted comment, Luria is said to have recommended that each community of Jews maintain the customs of its ancestors. Concerning the many differences in the prayers ... between minhag Sefarad, minhag Catalonia, minhagAshkenaz, and so on ... he said that in heaven there are twelve windows corresponding to the twelve tribes, and that the prayers of each tribe ascend through a different gate that is special to that tribe. .. .There- fore it is proper that each person hold fast to the order of the prayers accord- ing to the customs of his forefathers, for although no one living today knows who is descended from one tribe or another, it may be, since his forefathers held fast to those customs, that he is descended from that tribe . .. and that his prayers will not ascend unless they are said in that way.23 We recall that in sixteenth-century Safed there were exactly twelve commu- nities. For Luria, each community stood in place of, and perhaps was descended from, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. Each community was defined essentially by its ancestry and only accidentally by the region of Europe for which it was named.24 A similar stress on lineage may be seen in another passage, written from a more sober halakhic point of view, by the second commentator to the Shulhan 'Arukh (Isserles was the first), a leading rabbi of Egypt in the generation after Karo, Rabbi Jacob Castro (ca. 1525-1610). The topic of Castro's comment is the herem of Rabeinu Gershom, the prohibition on polygamy. Karo had taken the view that the prohibition was time-bound and no longer in effect; he also admitted, follow- ing his notion of local legal stringency, that polygamy might continue to be pro- hibited in certain places. Jacob Castro wrote, by contrast, "The herem of Rabeinu 23. See Hayyim Vital, Sha 'ar ha-Kavanot in Kol kitve ha- Ari z "l, ed. Judah Zvi Brandwein, vol. 8 (Jerusalem, 1988), p. 328. The passage is quoted in Zimmels, Ashkenazim and Sephardim, p. 116, n. 6, and also in such seventeenth-century halakhic works as Joseph Hahn N6rdlingen, Yosif 'omes (Frankfurt am Main, 1928), p. 12, and Abraham Gombiner, Magen Avraham on Shulhan 'arukh, Ora ayim, sec. 68. 24. It should be noted that Luria did not see ancestral liturgical customs as halakhically bind- ing. He himself used an idiosyncratic prayer text, the so-called Nusah ha- Ari. Cf. the halakhic view of Samuel de Medina, below n. 35. Nusah ha- 'Ari combines aspects of the Sefardic and Ashkenazic texts, and in that respect resembles Karo's efforts at halakhic unification (on which see Ta-Shma, "Rab- bi Joseph Caro and His Beit Yosef"). It was promoted by Vital and later became widespread among Ha- sidic groups. There is no evidence, however, that Luria himself intended his prayer text to have wide- spread use or to replace the various traditional prayer texts (as was later alleged). On the later reception of Nusah ha-Ari, see Joseph ben Hayyim Moses Nazir, She'elot u-teshuvot Mateh Yosef(Constantino- ple, 1717), pt. 1, no. 3; Dov Baer of Mezhirech, Magid devarav le-Ya 'akov, ed.

For Isaac Luria, for Jacob Cas- tro, and (as we will see) for Isserles as well, Ashkenazic Jews are defined by ge- nealogy, not only geography. Being Ashkenazic was passed on from father to son.26 Are a group of Jews united, are they subject to the same laws, because they all live in the same place? The notion of a territorial state, a polity that consists of the inhabitants of a certain place, all of whom must observe certain customs, ex- ists, of course, in many cultures; perhaps it is universal.27 The talmudic notion of custom is based on that thought; so is the fundamental form of the medieval Jew- ish community, which was a group of Jews who lived in a certain place, usually a certain town.28 A competing concept, however, both in the sixteenth century and afterwards, is the ethnic state, a polity that comprises all the members of a certain ethnic group. Among sixteenth-century Jews, ethnicity was often reduced to lineage; alongside of local custom, minhag ha-maqom, stood ancestral custom, minhag avoteinu. The notion of ancestral custom could justify the continuance of the diverse ethnic Jew- ish communities in the Ottoman cities.29 25.

Elimelekh Westreich has written a series of articles on the history of the interpretation of the herem Rabeinu Gershom. See esp. "'Ilot le-hatarat herem de-Rabeinu Gershom be-Italyah ba-me'ot ha-hamesh ve-ha-shesh 'esreh," Mehqere mishpat, 9 (1991), pp. 227-256; and "The Ban on Polygamy in Polish Rabbinic Thought," Polin 10 (1997), pp. 66- 84. In one of his responsa (She 'elot u-teshuvot Beit Yosef dine ketubot, no. 14) Karo reports that the Ashkenazic Jews in Jerusalem and Turkey themselves permitted polygamy. Their theory of the opera- tion of the herem must therefore have been different from Castro's (although it may also have been dif- ferent from Karo's). Cf. OSar ha-posqim, 'Even ha-'ezer, vol. 1 (Jerusalem, 1956), p. 70. 26. Cf. Talmud Bavli, Pesahim 50a, codified in Yoreh de 'ah 214. The herem of Rabeinu Ger- shom, as a herem, is said by some early modern halakhists to have a special status that makes it oblig- atory on children and children's children; whether other Ashkenazic minhagim are similarly inherited remained debatable. The principle that ancestors may bind future generations of descendents to a cus- tom or practice is also stated (in regard to the celebration of a special Purim) by R. Moses Alashkar in his Responsa, no.49; cf. R. Joseph Furman, quoted by Rivka Cohen, Qushta-Saloniqi-Patros, p. 150. Samuel de Medina qualified this rule in his responsa, 1:40, children may be released from an ancestral custom unless it is an interpretation of the talmudic law that they have accepted. 27. Cf.

Rather, they developed a new halakhic theory and defined the subcommunities as a third type of group, neither local nor genealogical. Each was defined as a qehilah, a cor- poration or college, in the medieval sense of those terms.30 The essential basis of membership in a medieval corporation was simply that the other members of the corporation let one join. An implicit contract existed (as medieval civil lawyers analyzed the matter) between the new member and the old. The old members could extend the contract to anyone.31 As rabbis like David ben Hayyim of Corfu (d. 1530) and Samuel de Medi- na (1506-1589) put it (and Karo himself in some of his responsa, as we have men- tioned), each qehilah, each community, was considered "a city unto itself." Geog- raphy was made fictive. The legitimacy of local difference was extended to permit communal difference as well. The new qehilah was not a location, and its basis in lineage was hidden; it was, rather, an independent corporation. Jewish law has moved from local autonomy to corporate autonomy.32 Among the Ottoman Jewish communities there was often great fluidity in deciding who belonged to which qehilah. In Istanbul in 1549, the rule was estab- lished that "anyone is permitted to register and to pray in any congregation that he chooses."33 Rabbi Samuel de Medina wrote in a responsum, "There is no force in 30. Cf. responsum 78 of R. Elijah Mizrahi: "The name 'Ashkenazi' in this place does not sig- nify that its bearer came from the kingdom of Germany, but rather that he is a member of the qehilah of the Ashkenazim who live in the city of Constantinople." Note also the debate of two Egyptian rab- bis of the end of the seventeenth century, Joseph ben Moses Nazir and Abraham ben Mordechai ha- Levi. Both addressed the question of whether Jews of Ashkenazic ancestry (or place of birth) should continue to observe Ashkenazic customs after settling in Egypt. Abraham ben Mordechai answered that they should not, because there was no Ashkenazic qehilah in Egypt. In a palce where there is a qehillah, however, "each qehilah is considered a city unto itself." See Joseph ben Moses Nazir, Mateh Yosef pt. 2, Yoreh de 'ah, no. 1; Abraham ben Mordechai, She 'elot u-teshuvot Ginat veradim (Constantinople, 1717), Yoreh de'ah 3:5.

(Each one has parallels in medieval and early modern Roman law.)36 The first is a geographic theory, that of Karo in his responsum to Pleven: Ashkenazic Jews live in a certain place; when they leave, they are no longer Ashkenazim. The divided, multi-ethnic Jewish community, in this view, is not halakhically legitimate. The second theory is genealogical, that of Jacob Castro in his analysis of the herem of Rabeinu Ger- shom: the Ashkenazim are the descendents of certain Jews who once lived in Ashkenaz. The third, an innovation of the sixteenth century, is a corporate theory: the Ashkenazim are the members registered in a certain synagogue and a certain qehilah. Isserles: The Tosafists as Ancestors and Legislators We turn now to Rabbi Moses Isserles.37 How did he define the Ashkenazic Jews as a group? There are two passages in Isserles' introduction to his comments on the Shulban 'Arukh in which he seems to define his audience. (The introduction is where a legal writer will typically place any discussion of why his work is author- itative, and for whom.) In the first, Isserles constructed the Ashkenazim as a lin- eage group, in the second, as a territorial group. Isserles wrote: 34. De Medina refused to allow a community to exclude new immigrants from membership (that is, to apply against them the hezqat ha-yishuv), see the responsum discussed by Baron in A Social and Religious History of the Jews, 2nd ed., vol. 18, p. 59. Thus, he left the initiative very much in the hands of the individual. The community can neither coercively exclude nor retain members. Fluidity among Jewish ethnic groupings in Italy is emphasized by Baron (Jewish Community, pp. 19-20); by Stow, "Ethnic Rivalry or Melting Pot"; and by Westreich, "'Ilot le-hatarat herem de-Rabeinu Gershom." 35. She 'elot u-teshuvot Maharshdam 1:35. Cf. no. 36. The incident is discussed by Rivka Co- hen, Qushta-Saloniqi-Patros, pp. 145-150. It is not clear whether de Medina would have accepted a decision by a community to abandon the Sefardic rite in favor of another; he praises the special clari- ty and simplicity of the Sefardic rite. Note also Samuel de Medina's attempts in one of his responsa (She 'elot u-teshuvot Maharshdam, Yoreh de 'ah 40) to justify the continuation of Sefardic customs by the Salonika Jews, while at the same time allowing the Jews of Sofia to abandon Hungarian customs of ritual slaughter. Cf. nn. 22, 26 above. 36. See Wells, Law and Citizenship in Early Modern France. Wells disproves the commonly held view that the concept of citizenship did not exist in premodern times. She shows that rights to cit- izenship were held to be based on a number of separate claims: blood relation, place of birth, place of residence, and subjective allegiance, as demonstrated, for example, by an oath. A person might become a citizen upon birth or through a contract with the city. 37. On Isserles, see generally Siev, Rabeinu Mosheh Isserles and the extensive bibliography there, pp. 267-300; Jonah Ben Sasson, Mishnato ha-'iyunit shel ha-Rema (Jerusalem, 1984); Elhanan Reiner, "The Ashkenazi Elite at the Beginning of the Modern Era: Manuscript vs. Printed Book," Polin 10 (1997), 93-98. 259</page><page sequence="10">Joseph Davis [Karo's] books are full of decisions that do not follow the interpretations of the sages from whose waters we drink, the famous authorities among the Jews of Germany [bi-venei Ashkenaz] who have always been eyes for us, and upon whom the earlier generations relied, ... [interpretations] which are all built on the words of the Tosafists and the sages of France, whose children's children we are.38 Why are Rashi and the Tosafists to be followed rather than Maimonides, quoted so extensively by Karo? Isserles did not argue that the Tosafists were greater sages than Maimonides, or that their interpretations of the Talmud were truer than the philosopher's. He argued simply that their rulings carried authority for their de- scendents. It is easy, at a distance of four centuries, to lose sight of the differences be- tween Karo's and Isserles' communities. Karo spoke from a place of authority, the land of Israel.39 Isserles, by contrast, was rabbi in a city and a land that had as yet made no mark on Jewish scholarship or on Jewish history, whose claim, therefore, to the excellence of its traditions might seem weak. Isserles compensated by lay- ing stress on the community's illustrious ancestors. One medieval Jewish view of customs, basing their power on rabbinic rather than on popular authority, was that every custom must have been approved by the great rabbis of former times. This theory was put forth strongly in the late fifteenth century by one of the leading rabbis of Italy, R. Joseph Colon (d. 1480), a scion of French (Savoyard) Jews. The ancient customs of the French Jews, he claimed, were all based on the teachings, written or unwritten, of the Tosafists.40 In 1541, Elijah Levita had claimed that "it is well known that we Ashkenaz- im are the descendents of the French Jews."41 Isserles extended this claim and nar- 38.

The introduction, which is not in all editions of the Shulhan 'arukh, is published, for example, in the photo-offset reprint of the first Cracow edition (Jerusalem, 1974), and in Raphael, ed., Rabi YosefQaro, p. 96. Isserles re- peats the phrase in Yoreh de 'ah 39:18: "the ancient sages of France and Germany, whose children's chil- dren we are." Isserles' remark is echoed in the 1649 responsum of R. Yom Tov Lipman Heller, She 'elot u-teshuvot Ge'onei batra'ei, ed. Elijah b. Moses of Pinczow (ed. princ. Turka, 1764), no. 10: "We are the descendants of the Jews of France and Germany, and we decide halakhah in accordance with their opinions, as ... Rabbi Moses Isserles wrote." 39. Karo was regarded by rabbis of the subsequent generations, such as Mordechai Jaffe and many others, as an "Oriental" rather than a Spanish Jew. See the introduction to Jaffe, Levush Malkhut: "[Karo] decided the majority of his rulings ... in accordance with the customs of the Islamic lands, because he was their leader." Cf. Hayyim ben Besalel in Vikuah Mayim Hayim (in Tchernowitz, Tole- dot ha-Posqim, vol. 2, p. 98), who characterizes Karo's rulings as minhag Eres Yisra 'el; see also Hay- yim Benveniste (1603-1673), in the introduction to his Keneset ha-gedolah, and the quotation from Joshua Falk Cohen below at n. 77. 40.

Cf. the remark by the early seventeenth-century grammarian 260</page><page sequence="11">The Reception of the Shullhan 'Arukh rowed it. He extended it to the Ashkenazic Jews of Poland and elsewhere, who were descendents of the German Jews; but he narrowed it at its root, for he did not claim lineage merely from the French Jews, but from "the Tosafists and the sages of France."42 Isserles did not merely claim (echoing Colon) that his ancestral customs were Tosafistic; he claimed that the Tosafists themselves were his ancestors. Isserles, as it happens, was descended on his mother's side from the Luria family, which traced its ancestry to Rashi himself.43 But Isserles was not making a personal genealogical boast. He was adapting his own genealogy into a founda- tion myth for all of his readers, for all ofAshkenazic Jewry. In this myth, as in Isaac Luria's, Ashkenazic Jews were conceived of as a lineage group.44 In the introduction to one of his law books, Sir Edward Coke, the great sev- enteenth-century defender of the English common law, cited the medieval legend that Britain had first been settled by Brutus, a refugee from ancient Troy. Sir Ed- ward found in the ancient ancestry of the British a grounding for his belief in their "ancient rights," inalienable rights given prior to the decrees of any British mon- arch. In just that way did Isserles present "the Tosafists and the sages of France" as both ancestors and legislators.45 Isserles' major opponent in the Polish rabbinate was his cousin, R. Solomon Luria.46 Like Isserles, Luria traced his genealogy back to Rashi. Like Isserles, al- and liturgist Shabbetai Sofer: "The German Jews are the French Jews" (!), quoted by Stefan Reif, Shab- bethai Sofer and His Prayer Book (Cambridge, 1979), p. 80, n. 86. 42. One may contrast other medieval theories of the origins of the German Jews, and particu- larly the theory of Maharil that the German Jewish settlements were ancient, and predated the de- struction of the Temple. See Abraham Grossman, Hakhmei Ashkenaz ha-rishonim 'ad ... tatnu [= 1096] (Jerusalem, 1981), pp. 2-5. Similarly, R. Asher ben Yehiel's claim (quoted by Maharil in his Responsa, no.100 [ed. Satz, p. 172], and then by R. Hayyim ben Besalel [in Tchernowitz (above n.1), p. 98]) that "the traditions of the German Jews are to be preferred ... because the Torah is an inheri- tance for them from their ancestors," does not seem to trace that tradition through the French Jews. 43. See Siev, Isserles, pp. 8-10. The genealogical tradition of the Luria family was first record- ed in the early sixteenth century; it reached back as a continuous genealogical record to the fourteenth century. From there to Rashi, it merely asserted the existence of a genealogical link. See Israel Yuval, Hakhamim be-doram: manhigut ha-ruhanit shel Yehudei Germanyah be-shilhei yemei ha-beinayim (Jerusalem, 1989), pp. 249-252. 44. Cf. Isserles' role in the creation of the story of the translatio studii from Germany to Poland (the story of R. Jacob Pollak), discussed by Elhanan Reiner in "Temurot bi-shivot Polin ve-Ashkenaz ba-me'ot ha-16-ha-17 veha-vikuah 'al ha-pilpul," in Israel Bartal et al., eds., Ke-minhag Ashkenaz u-Folin: sefer yovel le-Chone Shmeruk: qoves mehqarim be-tarbut Yehudit (Jerusalem, 1993), pp. 47- 53.

(He did not make them all, as Isserles did, descendents of great rab- bis.) However, Luria opposed the notion that genealogy could be made into a ba- sis for Jewish jurisprudence. Luria wrote in the introduction to his Yam shel She- lomoh: "In this view, each one could choose his own, the Spanish [Jew] choosing Spanish authorities and the French [Jew] choosing French authorities, each one in its own language, believing that the Torah is inherited by families. But this is not the way and this is not the city."47 The mainstream of talmudic interpretation, as Luria presented it, passed through the Tosafists rather than Maimonides. Luria stressed, however, that the true heirs of the Tosafists and the true intermediaries between himself and his Tosafist ancestors were not the intervening generations of parents and children, but the Spanish Talmud commentators, beginning with Nahmanides, who had imbibed the teachings of the Tosafists. Isserles presented the differences between Karo and himself as the differ- ence between universalism and particularism.48 Karo's code announced the law ideally for all Jews and ultimately for all humankind; Isserles was more modest, stating the law only for a particular group. Solomon Luria agreed with Isserles in preferring the views of the Tosafists to those of Maimonides. He agreed with Karo, however, that in principle Jewish law ought to be universal to all Jews, and that interpretations of Jewish law are not inherited by children from their par- ents.49 Isserles and the Geography ofAshkenaz In another passage in the introduction to his commentary to the Shulban 'Arukh, Isserles offered another definition of his limited audience, a geographical definition. Whereas the great author of the Beit Yosef and the Shulhan 'Arukh ... left af- ter himself no room for any addition, except to gather the words of the most recent rabbis and to set down the minhagim that are customary in these lands [bi-medinot eilu], therefore I have come after him to spread a tablecloth on the Laden Table [shulhan 'arukh] that he wrote, upon which will be every ripe fruit and every delicacy that is beloved of men. For without this, the table ume (New York, 1945), Hebrew section, pp. 45-63, and cf. the literature cited by Jacob Elbaum, Petihut ve-histagrut: ha-yesirah ha-ruhanit-ha-sifrutit be-Folin uve-arasot Ashkenaz be-shilhei ha-me 'ah ha- 16 (Jerusalem, 1990), p. 19, n. 20.

Bellomo, Common Legal Past of Europe, p. 78, on presentations of German vs. Italian law as a contrast of the particular and the universal. 49. Universalism is not, of course, identical to tolerance. Unlike Karo, who tried to ingratiate himself to Ashkenazic Jewish readers among others (see Ta-Shma, above n. 1), Solomon Luria attacked Spanish Judaism in the introduction to Yam shel Shelomoh. See below n. 94. 262</page><page sequence="13">The Reception of the Shulhan 'Arukh which he laid before the LORD is not yet ready for the men of these lands [benei adam asher bi-medinot eilu], for in the majority of the customs of these lands [minhagei medinot eilu], we do not follow his opinions.50 Isserles was thus writing for "the men" (clearly he meant the Jews) "of these lands." But which lands precisely are "these lands"? Isserles' vagueness here is striking. One may contrast his commentary to one of its major sources, the Turim of Rabbi Jacob ben Asher. At the beginning of the fourteenth century, Jacob ben Asher had moved with his father (Rabbi Asher ben Yehiel) from Germany to Spain. In his law code, the Turim, he contrasted the cus- toms of the Jews of Spain to those of Germany (Ashkenaz) in more than one hun- dred different passages.51 (The Turim was perhaps the first work in which the op- position of Sefarad and Ashkenaz was made into a fundamental dualism of Jewish life.) In contrast, Isserles' work is singularly devoid of place-names. The name Ashkenaz in particular appears only ten times.52 The erasure of place-names is one of Isserles' most characteristic editorial procedures. Where exactly are Isserles' "lands," medinot eilu? Not surprisingly, the mat- ter was disputed after Isserles' death. The debate centered on the question of whether "these lands" included the land of Germany. Were the Jews of Poland and Germany members of one polity, with shared customs and a shared interpretation of Jewish law, or did they form two separate groups?53 The first readers to address this question were Isserles' Cracow publisher, Isaac of Prossnitz, and his proofreader and editor, Samuel ben Isaac the Martyr Boehme (Pihem). The title pages of the various Cracow editions of the Shulhan 'Arukh (1570, 1577, 1583, and so on) read: "Shulhan 'Arukh ... written by ... R. Joseph Karo, with many comments ... by ... Moses Isserles ... and a guide 50. From the introduction to Isserles' commentary to the Shulhan 'arukh. Cf. Isserles' intro- duction to Torat ha-Hatat, "If a man were to decide the law following [Karo's] opinions set down in his Shulhan 'arukh, especially in matters of ritual prohibitions [isur ve-heter], he would contradict all of the customs that are followed in these lands [ba-medinot ha-eilu]." Similarly, in Isserles' introduction to Darkhei Mosheh, his commentary to the Turim, among the objections that Isserles made to Karo's decisions was that "[Karo] contradicts all of the customs that are observed in these lands (be-eilu ha- medinot)." Cf. also Darkhei Mosheh on Yoreh de'ah 35:7. 51. See, for example, Tur, Orah hayim, para. 47, 48, 49, 51, 59, 60, 114, 129, 131, 147, etc. Sometimes R. Jacob contrasted Spain to "France and Germany," Sarefat ve-Ashkenaz. Cf. Israel Ta- Shma, "Rabeinu Asher u-veno R.

The later parts of Isser- les' comments to the Shulhan 'Arukh were published posthumously, and Samuel ben Isaac, lately arrived from Venice, saw them from manuscript into print. He was a grandson of the famous Yiddish poet and Bible scholar Elijah Levita (Eliyahu Bokher).55 Not long after, however, there was a protest on the part of one of the leading rabbis of Germany, R. Hayyim ben Bezalel (ca. 1520-1588), the brother of the better-known Rabbi Judah Loewe (Maharal) of Prague.56 In the same way that Is- serles had rejected Karo's pretensions to legal authority over Ashkenazic Jews, R. .Hayyim rejected the notion that Isserles could decide law for German Jews. R. Hayyim composed a set of objections to an auxiliary work of Isserles, called Torat ha-Hatat. There is a great need to assert the differences between the customs of the Jews of Germany [benei Ashkenaz] and those of the land of Poland. ... Rabbi [Is- serles] himself in his introduction [to Torat ha-Hatat] did not mention the cus- toms of Germany at all, but only those of his own land. The introduction of the proofreader, however, mentioned explicitly "Poland, the Ukraine, Bo- hemia, and Moravia." And he extended the borders even farther, and wrote, "and perhaps every place where German [leshon Ashkenaz] is spoken by Jews." One may see that he expressed uncertainty whether the book applies to German Jews [benei Ashkenaz] or not. So the printer added that on his own and mentioned Germany as well on the title page, so that he would increase his sales in all of those lands, because buyers always look at the beginning of the book.57 Rabbi HIayyim framed his debate as being merely with Isserles' publisher and his editor. (Reading carefully, he noted as well that even Samuel ben Isaac, in his introduction to Torat ha-Hatat, had expressed hesitation concerning Isserles' relation to the customs of Germany.) R. Hayyim believed the extension of Isser- les' authority into Germany to be merely, as we would say today, publisher's hype. He believed that Isserles had only intended to write a law book for Polish Jews. 54.

HIayyim first appeared in the first volume of the Shulhan 'Arukh with Isserles' notes, which was published during Isserles' lifetime. This in itself suggests that Isserles approved of it; so does the unanimous agreement of Isserles' students (as will be discussed below) with the printer's ex- pansive view. It is possible, however, to argue on behalf of R. Hayyim's narrower reading of Isserles' intent.58 Hebrew printers were indeed capable of expanding a law code's an- nounced authority. This is clear from the case of R. Isaac of Tyrnau's Sefer ha-Min- hagim, written about 1410. R. Isaac wrote at its head that he would include the cus- toms of "Austria, Hungary, Styria, and Moravia." The four regions that he listed form a compact area centering roughly on Vienna. The work was later published in 1566 in Venice. The title page of the published volume, however, included a new list of places whose customs were said to be collected in the book. The work had now be- come "The Book of the Customs of Poland, Bohemia, and Germany."59 A second and more decisive argument may be brought from Isserles' own writings. "These lands" is a phrase that Isserles was fond of, and he used it sever- al times in his Responsa.60 In one place, he contrasted "these lands" to Italy: oil brought from Italy to "these lands" cannot be used. In another place, he contrast- ed "these lands" to Moravia: attitudes of Jews in the two places differ in regard to drinking wine made (or touched) by non-Jews. In a third responsum, importantly for us, Isserles contrasted "these lands" to Germany. "In these lands, the hatred of the Gentiles is not as strong against us as it is in the lands of Germany."61 The evidence of the usage in Isserles' responsa, that is, favors R. Hayyim's interpretation. Isserles used "these lands" to mean the lands of Poland. The "cus- toms of these lands" that Isserles codified in his notes to the Shulhan 'Arukh were the customs of the Polish Jews. The Geography ofAshkenaz: The Formation of German Jewish Identity Ashkenaz is a biblical name that was appropriated in the Middle Ages for Germany.62 An "Ashkenazic" Jew was therefore, in the first instance, a Jew who lived in Ashkenaz, in Germany. Beginning in the sixteenth century, however, the term came to have a wider semantic connotation that included, as we have seen, all 58. Professor Twersky argues ("The Shulhan arukh," p. 151) that Isserles' and Karo's intentions were not decisive in the later use of their book (and need not be decisive, for that matter, in our inter- pretation of it). This is, of course, far from arguing that Isserles had no specific intention in mind. 59. Sefer ha-minhagim le-Rabeinu Ayziq Tirna, ed.

The phrase "these lands," (medinot eilu, or eilu ha-medinot, or in some places gelilot eilu or arasot eilu) appears frequently in the text of Isserles' glosses to the Shulhan 'arukh: Orah hayim, par. 28, 31, 128, 291, 366,447, 608, 646, 892, 894, Yoreh de 'ah par. 39, 55, 68, 115, 196, 316, 322,'Even ha-'ezer par. 1, Hoshen mishpat par. 207. 61.

The Jews who lived in medieval Germany, in "Ashkenaz," did not see themselves consistently in that light. Their stronger iden- tifications were frequently regional or local.64 For instance, the great fifteenth- century rabbi Jacob Moellin, called Maharil, debated with his contemporaries whether such regions as Thiiringia and the Rhineland were separate "lands" or whether all of Germany should be considered one "land."65 The localism of the German Jews of the late Middle Ages found strong ex- pression in the realm of minhag, religious custom, the topic that would, of course, be so important to Isserles. In the extensive literature of customs produced by rab- bis of Central Europe in the fifteenth century, the notion of minhag Ashkenaz, of the custom of German or Ashkenazic Jews, appears rarely.66 Rather, Central Eu- 63. Max Weinreich has designated these meanings as Ashkenaz I and Ashkenaz II, respective- ly. See Weinreich, Geshikhte (above n. 41), vol. 1, p. 5; cf. vol. 1, p. 323; vol. 3, p. 5, n. 2. Weinreich's earliest citation for the term "Ashkenaz" used in its broader sense (Ashkenaz II) is from R. Anshel, Mirkevet ha-mishneh (Cracow, 1534). The name "Ashkenaz" did not lose its earlier narrower connota- tion, so there is an ambiguity that can be seen, for instance, in a quotation from R. Benjamin Slonik that we will cite later. On similar ambiguities in the meanings of "Germany" and "German" in the six- teenth century, see Istvin Bejczy, "Erasmus Becomes a Netherlander," The Sixteenth Century Journal 28 (1997), pp. 387-400. 64.

The upsurge of German national con- sciousness at the turn of the sixteenth century, inspired partly by German humanists such as Ulrich von Hutten, is well known. Modern historiography has exaggerated the degree to which consciousness of national identity in Europe has tended to increase monotonically since early in the Middle Ages, and to denigrate other competing conceptions of group identity that have existed since that time. Michael Stolleis argues that national consciousness and imperial patriotism in Germany went through waves of increased and decreased intensity in the early modern period.

A significant exception is the custom, described in Sefer Maharil (ed. Satz, p. 159) as ob- served throughout Germany, of an annual recitation of the names of all the communities that suffered massacres in 1096. "German" identity was tied partly to the memory of the massacres. Cf. Adam Teller's article (above n. 2). 266</page><page sequence="17">The Reception of the Shulihan 'Arukh ropean rabbis of the period tended to conceive of custom on the basis of cities or regions. Of particular importance were the customs of "Austria" and "the Rhine- land."67 In Leqet Yosher, Joseph of Miinster's collection of customs, there are (if we may rely on Freimann's index) twenty-three references to the Rhineland, sixty- four to Austria, and none at all to Germany.68 Zalman of Sankt-Goar, to consider another example, included in his Sefer Maharil a cautionary tale of Maharil's trip to Regensburg. In leading the prayers on the High Holidays, Maharil failed to observe all of the customs of the Regens- burg Jews. When his daughter died on Yom Kippur, Maharil interpreted his loss as a punishment for that sin. The stress was on the diversity of customs among the Jews of different German cities; any attempt to establish a normative "Ashkenaz- ic" set of customs was rejected.69 The localism of German Jews did not, of course, ever disappear. In the sixteenth century, rabbis were still being sworn to preserve the local customs; in the seventeenth century, collections of local minhagim were still being pro- duced.70 Nevertheless, the general councils of German Jewry in the second half of the sixteenth century gave evidence of the new, clearer sense of forming a single com- munity. "The kings have gathered," wrote the Frankfurt council of 1603, "the heads of the people and the communities... at the order of our masters the sages of Ger- many, to study and to solve the needs of the community." 67. See recently Eric (Yishaq) Zimmer, 'Olam ke-minhago noheg: peraqim be-toledot ha-min- hagim, hilkhoteihem, ve-gilguleihem (Jerusalem, 1996), pp. 217-295; Shelomoh Spitzer, "Minhag benei Ostraykh: meqoro ve-hitpathuto be-meshekh yemei ha-beinayim," Sinai 87 (1980), 55-64.

Zimmer (p. 217) and Spitzer both make assurances that the customs of "Austria" and "the Rhineland" agreed more than they disagreed. Note, however, that our question is not how modern ethnography sees medieval German Jews and their diverse but related customs, but how they saw the matter themselves. Notoriously, groups that seem very similar to outsiders may re- gard themselves as entirely different. R. Shalom of Neustadt, a rabbi in Austria, regarded Rhenish min- hagim as customary throughout Germany: "The main part of the kingdom of Germany is the Rhineland, and the other lands follow it."

Hayyim's defense of the boundaries of German Jewish customs against the pressures of Polish Jewish customs reflected this sense of Ger- manness.72 The late medieval distinction of "Austria" and "Rhineland" remained, how- ever, the geographical framework offered by another rabbi of the late sixteenth cen- tury, in trying to define the scope of Isserles' authority. According to Rabbi Isaac Mizeya, a rabbi in southern Germany (and possibly a student of Hayyim ben Beza- lel), Isserles had not meant to codify the customs of Germany, nor had he meant, on the other hand, to restrict himself merely to Poland. Mizeya wrote in a respon- sum, "Isserles' place is in the land of Austria [Meqomo shel moreinu ha-ray Rema haynu medinat Ostraykh]."73 There is no reason to imagine that Rabbi Mizeya was confused as to Isser- les' place of residence, or that he foresaw Cracow's years as part of the Austrian Empire. Rather, Isserles' "place is Austria" in the sense that Isserles codified "the customs of Austria," customs set down by such authorities as R. Isaac Tyrnau and R. Israel Isserlein. For the purposes of Jewish law, do the borders of Jewish groups follow the political borders of European kingdoms? Implicitly, Ijayyim ben Besalel suggest- ed that they do. Isserles may have taken that position himself, as we have seen; by "these lands," he may well have meant the lands of the Polish crown. Mizeya, how- ever, expressed Isserles' place not by the political geography of nations, but by the peculiar geography of Jewish religious custom. Isserles' students, as well as his publisher and editor, likewise took the position that the Ashkenazic Jews, though they have might lived in various kingdoms, nonetheless comprised one group liv- ing under one law. 71. "Hus li-Medinat Ashkenaz," "ausserhalb Teutschlands" or in another version, "aus dem Rdmischen Reich."

Much of the credit for the new sense of German Jewish community goes to the Habsburg emperors, notably Charles V, and to the men whom they appointed to be leaders of all German Jewry, notably Josel of Rosheim. See Zimmer, Gahalatan shel hakhamim, p. 263. 72. Note that R. Hayyim, unlike Maharil, can conceive of a codification of the customs of the "German" Jews. See Vikuah mayim hayim in Tchernowitz (above n. 1), p. 94. Similarly, R.

Hayyim ben Bealel, was promoted not only by Isserles' publishers, but by his students. Indeed, all of the earliest published affirmations of Isserles' authority came from his stu- dents. Four of Isserles' students, Rabbi Abraham Horowitz, Rabbi Benjamin Slo- nik, Rabbi Mordechai Jaffe, and Rabbi Joshua Falk Cohen, regarded the minhag- im collected by Isserles to be those not only of the lands of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, but of the lands of the German Empire. In this way, in spite of their hesitancy about accepting the authority of the Shulhan 'Arukh, even with Is- serles' corrections (Jaffe, for instance, wrote a competing code, the Levushim), their remarks tended to aid its spread throughout the world of Yiddish-speaking Jewry. Of the four, Rabbi Joshua Falk Cohen offered the longest analysis of the origins of the Sefardi-Ashkenazi split; he associated it with linguistic differences. Rabbi Mordechai Jaffe (ca. 1530-1612), in the introduction to his Levush Malkhut, a work that in some ways competed against, and in other respects imi- tated, the Shulhan 'Arukh with Isserles' comments, echoed Isserles' words from his introduction to the Shulhan 'Arukh. Jaffe clarified, however, the vague reference to "these lands," accepting the interpretation of the publisher: "[Karo] decided most laws in accordance with the views of Maimonides, because that is the custom in the lands of Ishmael, and he ... was their leader. . . . But that is not the custom ... in these lands [eilu ha-arasot]: Germany, Bohemia, Moravia, Poland, Russia, and the surrounding areas."74 Rabbi Abraham Horowitz (ca. 1530-ca. 1610) wrote in a special appendix to his 'Emeq Berakhah (Cracow, 1597): "We the Ashkenazim [benei ha-Ashke- nazim] follow my teacher and master ... R. Moses Isserles, for this man Moses is the most recent authority . .. and agrees with the truth and with the custom of these lands [medinot ha-eilu]."75 For Horowitz, "these lands" are apparently all the lands in which Ashkenazic Jews live, including, presumably, Germany. Likewise, R. Benjamin Slonik (ca. 1550-ca. 1620) wrote in a responsum, around 1604, "[Is- serles'] words have been accepted in all the lands of Germany [be-khol medinot Ashkenaz]."76 Finally, Rabbi Joshua Falk (ca. 1550-1614) wrote in the introduction to his commentary to the Shulhan 'Arukh, called Sefer Me 'irat 'Einayim: 74. From the introduction to Jaffe, Levush malkhut. Jaffe copies Isserles' phrase medinot ha- eilu in his own halakhic work: see, for example, the passages quoted by Zimmer, 'Olam ke-Minhago Noheg (above n. 67), pp. 140, 202. Another student of Isserles, the historian David Gans, also used the same phrase with the larger sense of the Ashkenazic lands. See his Semah David, pt. 1, for the year 1530 (ed. Mordechai Breuer [Jerusalem, 1983], p. 138); the passage is discussed in Reiner, "Temurot" (above n. 44), p. 48. 75.

Differences of language were also responsible for this, because their language in which they made legal decisions was Arabic, which is not like the languages of Ger- many and France. ... And the commentaries of Rashi and the Tosafists were followed by all the great rabbis of Germany and France who came after them, from whose waters we drink. .... And R. Joseph Karo ... lived in the lands of Islam.... But those who live in these lands, Germany, Poland, and Ukraine, follow the sages and leaders of Germany and France. ... Therefore we need the work of [Isserles], who gathered, collected, and codified all of the customs of Ashkenaz.77 What united the Jews of Poland and Germany? Was it the observance of iden- tical rituals and customs? That was Jaffe's implicit claim. Like Isserles, like Jacob ben Asher before him, Jaffe contrasted the customs of the Polish and German Jews to those of the Spanish Jews. As we have seen, Hayyim ben Besalel had disputed the claim. Was it the reliance of Jews in both kingdoms on the interpretations of Rashi and the Tosafists? So Joshua Falk suggested, but this immediately raised the question of why Rashi and the Tosafists were authoritative for Ashkenazic Jews, authoritative in a way that they were not for other Jews. We have seen Isserles' answer to this question: "we are their children's children." Interestingly, Joshua Falk Cohen did not accept Isserles' reliance on lineage. Perhaps, having studied under Solomon Luria as well as Isserles, he had been dissuaded by Luria's argu- ment. Groping for an alternative answer, R. Joshua, like Samuel ben Isaac, Isser- les' editor, suggested language. Jewish traditions, he suggested, are transmitted within language groups. In at least two respects, this is not at all satisfactory. In the seventeenth cen- tury, there was no halakhic theory that would explain why Jews who speak the same language should be subject to the same laws. Furthermore, Falk had to gloss over the major differences between the French spoken by Rashi and the Tosafists and the German or Yiddish of later Ashkenazic Jews, and between Arabic and Spanish. In another respect, however, the suggestion was an insightful one. It is sig- nificant that in the multi-ethnic communities of the Mediterranean, German and Polish Jews almost never formed separate synagogues or separate qehilot.78 Their 77.

An exception that proves the rule was in Amsterdam, where the Polish Jews split away from the German Jews in 1660. The two groups composed their differences and joined together again as one community in 1673. On the incident, see Bodian, Hebrews of the Portuguese Nation (above n. 2), pp. 125-131; Yosef Kaplan, "The Portuguese Community in the Seventeenth Century Amsterdam and the Ashkenazi World," Dutch Jewish History 2 (1989), p. 42; Moshe Rosman, "Samkhut shel Va'ad 'Arba 'Ara sot mi-hus le-Folin," Bar Ilan 24-25 (1989), 19-20; D.

Hayyim ben Beza- lel), but also on their shared Yiddish language. "It has been the custom throughout the Diaspora," wrote R. David ibn Abi Zimra in the sixteenth century in Egypt, "that the men of each city and each language form communities of their own and do not mix with the men of other cities and other languages ... for hearts are di- vided according to the divisions of places and languages."79 Whether or not the Ashkenazic Jews were in truth a lineage group in the simple sense implied by Isserles, they were surely a linguistic group. A collection of lands that might otherwise seem almost random-Lithuania, Moravia, Ger- many-had in common that the great majority of their Jewish inhabitants spoke Yiddish. They were Ashkenazim not because they lived in Ashkenaz, but because they spoke leshon Ashkenaz, German or Yiddish. Medieval Theory of Corporations and the Reception of the "Shulhan 'Arukh " We have asked how the authority of the Talmud commentaries of Rashi and Tosafot was defended in this period. We must now ask why the Talmud itself was regarded as authoritative. There were three essential theories, all of which are set forth in Moses Maimonides' introduction to his Mishneh Torah. According to the first, the Talmud is authoritative because it is the correct interpretation of the Torah; according to the second, because it was agreed to by all the rabbis; according to the third, because it was accepted by the Jews: "All of Israel is required to observe everything that is in the Babylonian Talmud ... [and] to observe all the customs instituted by the sages of the Gemara ... since all of Israel consented to everything in the Talmud."so In the terms that we suggested earlier, the third theory casts the Jews as a medieval corporation, accepting laws by an act of corporate will. Karo accepted Maimonides' theory of authority based on popular consent.81 Amsterdam mi-shenat 1635 'ad shenat 1795," in Mehqarim 'al-toledot Yahadut Holand, vol. 1 (1975), pp. 69-87. (Sluys's article appeared originally in Dutch: "Hoogduits-Joods Amsterdam van 1635 tot 1795," in Geschiednis der Joden in Nederland, ed. H. Brugmans and A.

II, no. 72: "In Salonika,... when they arrived after the expulsions, each language established a community for itself, and no one goes or comes from community to community, and each community supports the poor of their lan- guage." Salo Baron quotes the passage in his Social and Religious History of the Jews, vol. 18, pp. 55- 56. 80. On Maimonides' theory of talmudic authority, see Menahem Kellner, Maimonides on the 'Decline of the Generations' and the Nature of Rabbinic Authority (Albany, 1996). "They vowed and accepted"-qiyemu ve-qibelu (Esther 9:27)-is the catchphrase that is very often used for popular re- ception of a law or lawcode. A different view of Jewish law derives the authority of Jewish communal institutions from Talmudic law; here it is the reverse. 81. Karo was among those who applied the theory to Maimonides. See She'elot u-teshuvot 'Avqat rokhel, no. 32: "All the communities of the Land of Israel and Arabistan and the Maghreb are accustomed to follow his opinions, and have accepted him as their master." See also the passage from Karo's introduction to Beit Yosefquoted above n. 19. Maimonides' theory of consent forms the basis for his theory of the possible future renewal of rabbinic ordination. It is therefore significant that Karo was involved in R. Jacob Berav's movement to ordain rabbis in Safed. On that event, see the revised 271</page><page sequence="22">Joseph Davis Moses Isserles, on the other hand, does not appear to have accepted either the the- ory or the corollary notion of the "reception" of a law or a law code.82 He did not invoke it on his own behalf or on behalf of any other work; his own theory of the authority of Rashi and the Tosafists, namely, that their authority derived from their being the ancestors of present Ashkenazic Jews, was quite different. The notion of reception was applied to Isserles' work, however, as well as Karo's, in the generations after them, by (among others) R. Isaiah Horowitz (ca. 1560-1626), author of the kabbalistic and moralistic work, Shenei Luhot ha- Berit.83 Suggesting that the Ashkenazic Jews had collectively chosen Isserles as their guide, Horowitz cast them as a sort of qehilah or super-qehilah. Isaiah Horowitz, whose father Abraham (as we have mentioned) was a stu- dent of Isserles, was convinced, just as his father had been, that Isserles' work was authoritative for Ashkenazic Jews. The son did not agree, however, with any of the reasons that had been put forward by his father, nor indeed with any of the reasons that had been put forward by Isserles himself. Isaiah Horowitz made no use of Isserles' claim (repeated, as we have seen, by his students) that he had collected the customs of the Jews of "these lands." Nor did he repeat Isserles' foundation myth of the ancestry of Ashkenazic Jews. R. Isa- iah argued, moreover, that Solomon Luria was more insightful than Isserles as a Talmud interpreter. Isserles' comments, according to R. Isaiah, do not correspond most closely to the "true meaning" of the Talmud or the Torah; Isserles is not au- thoritative on that account. Isaiah Horowitz argued finally, against his father, that, having seen Isserles' views and responded to them, Solomon Luria should be con- sidered the more "recent authority." Applying (as had both his father and Isserles) the talmudic principle that "the law follows the most recent authority [halakhah ke-vatra 'ei]," the younger Horowitz suggested that Luria's views ought to have been decisive; and yet he admitted that they were not.84 [Isserles'] coinage has been accepted, and we must follow his opinions and render decisions in accordance with his views. Doubtless he merited this from version of Jacob Katz, "Maloqet ha-semikhah bein Rabi Ya'aqov Berav veha-Ralbah," in his Halakhah ve-qabalah (Jerusalem, 1984), pp. 213-236, and the literature cited there. On Karo's use of Mai- monides, see Twersky, "R. Yosef Qaro," above n. 1. 82. Note as well that R. Joshua Falk Cohen, in his discussion of the Talmud's authority in the introduction to Sefer Me 'irat 'Einayim, bases it only on rabbinic consensus. 83. Note also the formal acceptance of Karo's authority by the rabbis of the land of Israel in the seventeenth century, reported by Jacob Hagiz and discussed by Toledano in Raphael, ed., Rabi Yosef Qaro, p. 185. 84. Isserles claimed in his introduction to the Shulhan 'arukh that Karo, in relying on Mai- monides, had unjustly neglected the more "recent authorities" whom it is right to follow, such as the fifteenth-century Ashkenazic rabbis. Abraham Horowitz (n. 75 above) argued that Isserles himself was the most "recent authority," and that on that account he should be followed. On the principle that "the law follows the recent authority," see Israel Ta-Shma, "Hilkheta ke-vatra'ei: behinot historiyot shel ke- lal mishpati," Shenaton ha-mishpat ha-'Ivri 6-7 (1980), pp. 405 -425; Meir Rafeld, "'Hilkheta ke- vatra'ei' es el Hakhmei Ashkenaz u-Folin ba-Me'ot ha-15-16: Meqorot u-Sefihin," Sidra 8 (1992), pp. 119-140; Israel Yuval, "Rishonim ve-'aharonim, Antiqui et moderni: toda'at ha-zeman ve-toda'ah 'asmit be-Ashkenaz," Zion 57 (1992: 369-394). 272</page><page sequence="23">The Reception of the Shulhian 'Arukh heaven, just as the House of Hillel did. ... In the Diaspora, in the lands of the Polish crown, in Bohemia, Moravia, and Germany, the [practice] has spread to render decisions in accordance with his views .... In this generation, we follow the opinions of R. Moses Isserles, and who shall permit what he for- bade?85 Horowitz claimed that Solomon Luria was the more profound talmudist and the more recent authority, but that the providentially guided communities of Cen- tral and Eastern Europe had accepted Isserles. They are all governed by the same laws because they have accepted them together. Exercising a putative common will, the Ashkenazic Jews (in the broader sense of the term) have constituted them- selves into a single juridical community.86 In the generation before Horowitz, R. Benjamin Slonik (whom we quoted above) had already applied to Isserles the idea of voluntary reception. "[Isserles'] words have been accepted in all the lands of Germany [be-khol medinot Ashke- naz]." (We may remark that Slonik's and Horowitz's comments seem somewhat premature: Isserles' victory in Germany, although it had begun before 1600, was not assured until after 1650.)87 In the generation after Horowitz, the thought that Isserles had been accept- ed by popular acclaim was repeated by a minor rabbi in Cracow, Hayyim Buchner (ca. 1610-1684). R. Moses Isserles exerted much effort and searched, like the search of Jerusalem by candlelight, for all the customs of the lands that belong to the Ashkenazim [medinot ha-mityahasim la-Ashkenazim].... And truly one must follow the decisions of the great rabbi ... R. Moses Isserles of blessed mem- ory, for the Jews have vowed and accepted that they will follow him in every regard.88 85.

Zimmels, Ashkenazim and Sephardim, exaggerating somewhat, claims that "it was only through Caro and Isserles that the Sephardim and Ashkenazim became united among themselves" (p. 58). 87. The reception of the Shulhan 'arukh in Germany is surveyed by Zimmer in Gahalatan shel hakhamim (above n. 1), pp. 257-258, and in greater detail, pp. 210-237. The reception of the Shulhan arukh had at least four aspects, not all of them simultaneous. (1) Its widespread use was nearly in- stantaneous. (2) The decline and gradual falling out of print of competing codes, such as Sefer misvot ha-gadol; the Mordechai; the Turim; and the Talmudic digest of R. Asher ben Yehiel, began about 1600 and was complete after 1640, after the death of R. Joel Sirkes, who had championed the Turim. (3) Be- ginning at the turn of the seventeenth century, the authority of the Shulhan 'arukh was also asserted by major rabbis, by students of Isserles and later by their students and (particularly after mid-century) by their students' students, and by others. (4) Finally, after the second quarter of the seventeenth century, statements of opposition to the Shulhan 'arukh by major rabbis trail off. Statements of support and op- position to the Shulkhan 'arukh are collected by Siev (above n. 1), pp. 286-296. Cf. Reiner, "Temurot" (above n. 44), pp. 21-22, n. 20. 88.

He may have been writing imprecisely, and meant only "the Ashkenazic Jews." It is possible, 273</page><page sequence="24">Joseph Davis Consider, finally, the case of the Jews of Buda. In the sixteenth and seven- teenth centuries, Hungary was a part of the Ottoman Empire, and its Jewish com- munity balanced itself between the Ashkenazic and Sefardic worlds. In the Otto- man Empire, Hungarian Jews were frequently distinguished from "Ashkenazim." We recall, for instance, that in Safed there were separate Hungarian and Ashke- nazic communities.89 Sometime in the mid-seventeenth century, however, the community of Buda enacted a communal decree that their rabbis should "make no decision in Jewish law except in accordance with the Turim, the Beit Yosef and its pure Shulhan ['Arukh], following the decisions of The Tablecloth [Isserles' com- mentary], and their recent commentators."90 The Jews of Buda voted themselves into the Ashkenazic world by accepting the authority of the Shulhan 'Arukh and its Ashkenazic commentators. The Formation ofAshkenazic Identity in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries Isserles' authority, so wrote Isaiah Horowitz, was accepted because "he mer- ited it from heaven." Comparing Isserles to the House of Hillel, Horowitz perhaps meant to suggest that Isserles' personal character, which is reflected in his legal writings, had played a role in winning acceptance for his work: Isserles' generos- ity, kindness, and modesty. No doubt these qualities are significant, and a more stringent work or a more strident one would not have been as popular. Neverthe- less, the ambit of Isserles' acceptance still needs to be explained. As we have seen, the Jews of "the lands of the Polish crown, Bohemia, Moravia, and Germany," were not typically a unanimous group. Why did the Ger- man or Bohemian or Moravian or Lithuanian Jews not accept some other legal code? There were enough to choose from, medieval codes as well as more recent ones.91 however, that, like certain other rabbis in his day such as R. Hayyim Benveniste in Izmir, Buchner thought of Isserles' comments as being applicable in principle to all Jews. See Hayyim Benveniste, in- troduction to Keneset ha-gedolah (Livorno, 1658). 89. On the relation of Hungarian Jews and Ashkenazic Jews in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, see Bornstein (above n. 13), pp. 82-86. There were separate communities of Hungarian and Ashkenazic Jews in Constantinople as well (p. 82, n. 6). By the second quarter of the seventeenth cen- tury, however, two Salonika rabbis, R. Daniel Estrossa and R. Hayyim ben Shabbetai, referred to the Buda Jews in their responsa as "Ashkenazim" (pp. 83-84). 90. See Ephraim ben Jacob ha-Kohen, She 'elot u-teshuvot Sha 'ar Efrayim, no. 113, quoted in Siev, p. 291, and in Tchernowitz, p. 157 (both above n. 1). In a reponsum written between his arrival in Buda in 1666 and his death in 1678, R. Ephraim wrote that he had found these taqanot in the pinqas of the community. He added that the community had placed clauses to this effect in the contracts of some of his predecessors. (Contrast the contract of the rabbi of Friedberg, above n. 70.) 91. For example, the acceptance of the Shulhan 'arukh by the Prague rabbinate before the end of the seventeenth century is not clear. There were attempts in Prague to promote Jaffe's Levushim (Jaffe was a Prague native), as well as R. Asher ben Yeiel's Pisqe ha-Rosh. In the early seventeenth century, while the Shulhan 'arukh was not published in Prague, the Levushim was reprinted twice: in 1609 and again in 1622-1624. R. Yom Tov Lipman Heller made efforts to promote R. Asher's Digest, as had Ma- haral before him; volumes of R. Asher were published in 1619 and 1628. Volumes of the Shulhan 'arukh were finally published in Prague in 1688-1695. See Tchernowitz (above n. 1), pp. 185-186 on Eliyah Rabah by the Prague rabbi Elijah Spira, which was written about 1690 as commentary to the Levushim, but published in the eighteenth century as a commentary on the Shulhan 'arukh. 274</page><page sequence="25">The Reception of the Shulhan 'Arukh The political scientist Liah Greenfeld, in her analysis of the rise of national- ism in the modern period, emphasizes the role played by imitative pressure, which she calls ressentiment. French nationalism was inspired by British nationalism, German nationalism by French, and so on.92 Mutatis mutandis, this notion may be applied to our story. The wealthier, more eminent, and more populous Sefardic communities pressed against the Ashkenazic Jews of the sixteenth century in many realms, such as theology and educational practice.93 Isserles felt the pressure especially keenly in the realm of law. In opposition to Maimonides, on whom the Sefardic rabbinate relied, Isserles placed Rashi and the Tosafists "the sages from whose waters we drink." Solomon Luria, who rejected the rationalism of Spanish Jewry, found space in the introduction to his great work ofjurisprudence to include a diatribe against Maimonides, and also against, of all people, the Spanish Bible commentator Abra- ham ibn Ezra. Isserles' character was to avoid polemics, but the double form that he created for the Shulhan 'Arukh, with its contrasting sections of Karo's rulings and his own comments, also placed Ashkenazic Judaism in implicit opposition to Spanish or Oriental Judaism.94 Before 1492, Sefarad (Spain) and Ashkenaz (Germany) were simply two of the many lands in which Jews lived, each with its own traditions and customs. Af- ter 1492, Sefardic identity was released from the bounds of geography and was based instead on communal association, lineage, and language; similarly, the def- inition of "Ashkenaz" was extended in these ways.95 Another political scientist, Benedict Anderson, examining the same question of the rise of nationalism, emphasizes two other factors: first, printing and the rise of standardized national languages, and second, the creation of centralized bu- reaucracies.96 Here again, there are parallels to our case. The invention of printing created an opportunity for the codification of Jewish law and the centralization of rabbinic authority, an opportunity that was taken by Karo and then by Isserles. The spread of each work depended partly on the established markets for Hebrew books from Venice and Cracow, respectively. The code of Isserles (i.e., the Shulhan 'Arukh with 92.

Luria's identification of Spanish Jewry with philosophical rationalism prefigured (albeit with a negative slant) the "Sefardic Mystique" of the Haskalah, on which, see Schorsch (above n. 2). Cf. the remarks of the Messianic visionary Asher Lemlein in the wake of the expulsion of the Spanish Jews in 1492 ("Hezyonotav shel R. Asher be-R. Meir ha-mekhuneh Lemlein Reutlingen," ed. Ephraim Kupfer, Qoves 'al yad 18 [1976], p. 406). Isserles, to the contrary, was a follower of Maimonidean ra- tionalism: see Jonah Ben Sasson (above n. 37). Isserles restricted Ashkenazic difference to law and practice; he did not believe in the existence of an "Ashkenazic theology" nor a "Sefardic theology" that would be distinctive in any way. Isserles' tendency to avoid polemics is remarked on by Twersky, "The Shulhan 'Arukh" (above n. 1), p. 150, n. 29. 95. On Sefardic identity, see Bodian (above n. 2). 96. Benedict R. O'G.

Ashkenazic Jews in the early modern period did not develop a centralized court system (Polish Jews did), but they did have a shared rabbinic elite. The success of Isserles' code, his- torians have noted, was tied to the success of the Polish yeshivot, and to the ac- ceptance of rabbis trained in Poland by the German Jewish communities.99 We have already seen the efforts of four of Isserles' students to promote the authority of their teacher both within Poland and outside it. Rabbinic graduates of the Pol- ish yeshivot, students of Isserles' students, and the students they in turn taught, gave authority to Isserles' work. In so doing, they gave legal substance to the no- tion of Ashkenazic Jews as a group. The pressure of Sefardic Judaism, the common market for Yiddish books, and a shared rabbinic elite all helped make Ashkenazic Jews into a unified and dis- tinctive group. Seeking to explain and to justify that unity, Isserles invoked the no- tions of shared lineage ("we are their children's children") and geographical co- herence ("these lands"). His printer, his editor, and most importantly his students then expanded Isserles' view of "these lands" from the Polish lands to include all of Central and Eastern Europe; they added by way of explanation that the Jews of this entire area were united by language. Finally, in the seventeenth century vari- ous authorities added to these two legal bases of Ashkenazic unity (ancestral tra- dition and local custom) a third one: namely, that for all these Jews, the authority of Isserles had been established by communal act.
