<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE JEWS: ASSESSING THE CULTURAL IMPACT by JAY R. BERKOVITZ Introduction For the Jews of France, as for their fellow countrymen, the French Revolution came to constitute the myth of origin, the birthdate of a new existence. On September 27, 1791, two years after the storming of the Bastille and the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the French National Assembly voted to admit the Jews of Alsace-Lorraine to citizenship. Subse- quent generations would recall this momentous event as a turning point of extraordinary magnitude, and would view themselves as compelling evidence of its transformative power. Their memories tended to be dominated by images of celebration and glory, comparing the Revolution to the Sinaitic revelation and referring to it in messianic-redemptive terms. Not surprisingly, the many setbacks and misfortunes suffered by the generation of 1789 were largely absent from these recollections, while only meager appreciation for the complexities introduced into Jewish cultural life can be detected in the half-century following the Revolution. Even more significant was the ascendant historical view, undoubtedly colored by a pervading sense of optimism among leaders of French Jewry, that credited the Revolution with having put an end to centuries of humiliation, legal discrimination, and exclusion from the mainstream of society.1 1. For several references to the Revolution in messianic-redemptive and revelatory terms, see Michael Marrus, The Politics of Assimilation: A Stud)y of the French Jewish Connmmunity at the Time of the Dre'fus Affair (Oxford, 1971), pp. 90-92, 106-107.

BERKOVITZ The historical record, however, reveals a much more complex picture. Civic equality came at a heavy price, and only after a long and arduous struggle. The bestowal of citizenship was finally granted on the condition that the Jewish communities surrender their special privileges of communal au- tonomy and rabbinic jurisdiction in civil affairs. Nevertheless, although these two concessions would ultimately prove highly repercussive, their impact was not felt immediately or uniformly. For most of France's Jewish population the Revolution introduced no abrupt changes. Occupational structure, residence patterns, and the rhythm of religious life remained, for the vast majority, unchanged until the latter part of the century. Likewise, rabbinic leadership, though its power was undeniably curtailed by the loss of civil autonomy, continued to exercise authority in religious and communal affairs for much of the nineteenth century, while within French society anti-Jewish hostility has persisted unremittingly for an even longer period. Whatever the uncertainty concerning the tangible effects of the Revolution, however, the eventual triumph of its ideals assured the mythic view of the Revolution a place of prominence in the consciousness of French Jewry.2 Pricis de l'histoire des hebreux depuis le patriarche Abrahamn jusqu 'en 1840 (Metz, 1840), esp. pp. 406-407; Leon Kahn, Les Juifs de Paris (Paris, 1898), p. 356; and the triumphalist remarks of Rabbi Simon Debre, "The Jews of France," Jewish Quarterly Review 3 (1891): 367-435. On the general tendency to use the Revolution for political purposes, see Eric Hobsbawm, "Mass-Producing Traditions, 1870-1914," in The Invention of Tradition, ed. Eric Hobsbawm and Terrence Ranger (Cambridge, 1983), pp. 270-273. On the Revolution as myth, see Alice Gerard, La Rdvolution: mythes et interprdtations, 1789-1975 (Paris, 1976). 2. The role of the French Revolution as an agent of change in modern European society is still fiercely contested even after two centuries. According to the conventional view, it was one of history's pivotal events, an upheaval which triggered decisive changes in political, social, and economic life, first in France, and subsequently in the rest of Europe. All vestiges of feudalism were swept away, peasants were freed from ecclesiastical tithes and seigneurial dues, and free trade was established throughout the territories under French control, while autonomous corporations were abolished, local and provincial privileges were curtailed, and a new democratic tradition emerged. However, beginning with de Tocqueville's assertion of continuity in political behavior and attitudes before and after the Revolution, a tendency to minimize the historical significance of the events of 1789 has gained in strength and may today be dominant. Georges Lefebvre concluded that the economic impact of the Revolution, particularly with respect to agrarian reform, had been greatly overstated, and for many scholars specializing in social history, the pace of modernization, and not the Revolution, was the decisive factor. Data cited by Maurice Agulhon and Eugen Weber concerning the steadfast traditionalism of vast sectors of the rural population throughout most of the nineteenth century suggest how ineffectual the Revolution was in the countryside. Others point to extensive</page><page sequence="3">THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE JEWS 27 Developments over the course of the nineteenth century show that Jewish life in France was dramatically transformed in both objective terms and with respect to Jewish self-understanding. But precisely what function did the Revolution serve in this transformation, and how critical was its mythical dimension to the process? Toward the goal of clarifying the role played by the Revolution in the modern history of French Jewry, our analysis will distinguish between various internal and external forces which have molded the character of Jewish life. As in the case of virtually all minorities, Jewish culture is shaped both by forces which are intrinsic to it, and therefore present over a wide range of localities, and by forces which are extrinsic to the normal functioning of the local community. Our examination of the Revolution's impact will therefore require comparisons with Jewish communities beyond the borders of France during the half-century that followed 1789.3 Attention to comparative issues will also highlight the distinction that needs to be drawn between the changes resulting from the general transformation of indications of social change before 1789, claiming that modernization in France, ironically, may very well have been interrupted by the Revolution. Most recently, Simon Schama has added to this last argument the claim that the legacy we normally associate with the Revolution was already represented at the highest levels of French society before 1789. The "great period of change," according to Schama, "was not the Revolution but the late eighteenth century." See Alexis de Tocqueville, L'Ancien regime et la rdvolution (Paris, 1856); Georges Lefebvre, "La place de la Revolution dans l'histoire agraire de la France," Annales d'histoire cononmique et sociale 1 (1929): 506-523.

On political culture in revolutionary France, see Lynn Hunt, Politics, Culture, and Class in the French Revolution (Berkeley, 1984). For an excellent review of the literature on the role of the Revolution in the countryside, see Peter McPhee, "The French Revolution, Peasants, and Capitalism," American Historical Review 94 (1989): 1265-1280. 3. The remarkable degree of uniformity present in Jewish communal life throughout western and central Europe until the mid-eighteenth century provides the basis for a comparative approach to the changes that would soon transform European society. Precisely what triggered the breakdown of traditional Jewish life, and just when that break occurred, remains the subject of much scholarly debate. For a rich array of sources indicating a decline in religious observance in the early part of the eighteenth century, see Azriel Shohet, The Beginnings of the Haskalah in Germany [Heb.] (Jerusalem, 1960). Shohhet's work evoked considerable criticism; cf. Barukh Mevorakh's review in Kirat Sefer 37 (1961/62): 150-155, and Jacob Katz, Out of the Ghetto: The Social Background of Jewish Emancipation, 1770-1870 (Cambridge, Mass., 1973), pp. 34-36. Cf.

BERKOVITZ European society beginning in the late eighteenth century and those that may be attributed specifically to emancipation/revolution. An entire host of forces, including Enlightenment, industrialization, and urbanization, to name only a few, either effected change independently of the Revolution or were in a position to fortify, neutralize, or even counteract its effects. Paula Hyman has correctly pointed out that neither the erosion of the economic role of the Jews in the Alsatian countryside, nor advances in social integration and mobility through education, nor the involvement of the state in Jewish affairs in order to encourage reform stemmed directly from the Revolution. Rather, the impact of the Revolution is most discernible in the construction of a Franco-Jewish identity and in the development of programs designed to meet the demands of the new civic status.4 It is hoped that the present study will alert the reader to the distinctiveness of French Jewry's efforts to meet the challenges it encountered, without losing sight of those aspects of the struggle that it shared with other Jewish communities. Our efforts to measure the significance of the revolutionary upheaval will concentrate both on the internal, cultural dynamic of France's Ashkenazic Jews, in Alsace-Lorraine and Paris, and on the pace of their transformation. Typically, historians have focused on the enormous promise of the Revolution and on the difficulties encountered by Jews in meeting the social and political challenges that ensued. In the process, however, the Revolution has tended to blind modern scholars to the more opaque, though potentially most revealing, aspects of French-Jewish history. This paper will direct its attention upon the centrality of religious values and authority among French Jews, placing special emphasis on issues of cultural continuity and change. We shall refer to the transformation of Jewish life using the term "modernization," albeit in the general, nontechnical sense, to denote the aggregate metamorphosis engendered by urbanization, economic development, and industrialization. Our chief concern, however, is not with the socioeconomic aspects of modern- ization, but with the progressive secularization and decline of the traditional Jewish value system resulting from the encounter with non-Jewish ideas and symbols.' The dynamics of this process will be observed on several levels: 4.

Initially, the</page><page sequence="5">THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE JEWS 29 the authority of religious leaders and institutions; attitudes toward integration into the surrounding society; and efforts to redefine the knowledge formerly restricted to traditionalist interpretation. Our objective is not only to assess the subtle shifts in behavior and thought that may have reflected a dissatisfaction with, or conversely, a reaffirmation, of the traditional religious worldview, but also to determine how they served as the basis for a new consciousness, a reconstructed identity. In charting the evolution and substance of the new Franco-Jewish self-image, the point of reference to which we shall return periodically is the role of the Revolution as an idea, a legacy, that lent itself to an ongoing hermeneutic.6 Precisely how did Franco-Jewish leaders understand the meaning of the changes which had begun to be felt in their communities, and how did they integrate the significance of the Revolution with their conception of Jewish tradition and existence? What was the impact of Jewish culture on the construction of Jewish identity?7 term "secularization" was used to describe the transfer of church property to state control. It has also been used to refer to the decline in religious observance, and to the failure of religious rituals and symbols to answer questions about the meaning of life. Our use of the term will draw on its original meaning, i.e., expropriation-not with respect to property, but to domain or authority. Employing the tools of sociology, Peter Berger has made several important contributions to our understanding of secularization. Cf. The Sacred Canopy (Garden City, N.Y., 1969) and The Heretical Imperative (New York, 1979). For several examples of specialized studies which are particularly useful, see Thomas Kselman, "Funeral Conflicts in Nineteenth-Century France," Comparative Studies in Society and History 30 (1988): 312-332, esp. 328-330; Vernon Lidtke, "Social Class and Secularization in Imperial Germany-the Working Classes," Leo Baeck Institute Year Book 25 (1980): 21-40; Bryan Wilson, "Secularization: The Inherited Model," in The Sacred in a Secular Age, ed. Philip E. Hammond (Berkeley, 1985), pp. 9-20. 6. For a recent study devoted to this subject, see Noel Parker, Portrayals of the Revolution: Images, Debates and Patterns of Thought on the French Revolution (Carbondale, Ill., 1990). 7. The distinction between "culture" and "identity" requires some clarification. By "culture" we are referring to public, socially established structures of meaning in terms of which people behave. See Clifford Geertz, The Interpretation of Cultures (New York, 1973), pp. 12, 89. Denoting any historically transmitted system of thought, belief, and values, culture is expressed in symbolic forms. "Identity," by contrast, lacks the dimension of continuity associated with culture. It is the consciousness or self-reflection resulting from a confrontation with the realities of the day and is therefore given to more frequent shifts and mutations; its contours are shaped by significant events, ideological currents, and social forces. Nevertheless, "identity" and "culture" are not independent entities, but act reciprocally upon one another. Manifestations of identity are all potential forms of culture, especially when institutionalization transforms them from ephemeral to more lasting expressions. They may also represent an orientation that can predispose individuals to greater or lesser receptivity to a particular cultural legacy. "Culture,"</page><page sequence="6">30 JAY R. BERKOVITZ While it is quite evident that a distinct Franco-Jewish identity was eventually to emerge out of the events of 1789, it is not at all clear how quickly this development occurred. Moreover, no effort has as yet been made to determine how the pre-1789 Jewish historical experience impacted on expressions of, and struggles for, self-definition among modem French Jews. Toward the goal of clarifying the relationship between the pace of transformation and the timing of emancipation, our inquiry will concentrate first on trends in Jewish culture in the ancien rdgime, and then on the ideology of regeneration. Based on this analysis, we shall suggest that although certain changes in the nature of community leadership and in the provenance of rabbinic culture were already in motion before the Revolution, the general patterns of social, economic, and religious life. tended to be more unyielding. Compared to developments in neighboring Germany, where cultural transformation was relatively swift, modernization in France appears to have been impeded, not accelerated, by the Revolution. But this should not imply that the impact of the Revolution was insignificant. We have found that the effects of this delay were quite imposing and ought to be understood as belonging indisputably to the Revolution's legacy, although they were not noticeable until much later. The issue is not whether the Revolution single-handedly transformed Jewish life in France. I shall argue that the Revolution must be viewed within a broader chronological framework as the first, and indeed the most important, in a series of events that together left an indelible mark on Jewish consciousness. We shall therefore track the impact of the Revolution over a period of several generations, tracing the emergence of an "ideology of emancipation" through its three principal stages of development. What links the Reign of Terror, the Napoleonic Empire, the Bourbon Restoration, and the July Monarchy with the Revolution is a shared commitment to the ideals of 1789, a commitment that would, nonetheless, reflect the particular emphases and interpretations of each ensuing political regime. Throughout each of these eras the question of Jewish civic equality and social integration occupied the attention of civil servants, public officials, by the same token, can serve as the basis upon which identity is constructed and may influence the forms of its expression. Prior to the Revolution, identity flowed evenly from Jewish culture. Questions of identity were far less pressing, if at all relevant, in an age when Jews lived in an insular cultural environment where a consensus on values prevailed. With the Revolution and the ensuing encounter with modernity, culture and identity were split apart. As connections to Jewish culture became somewhat attenuated, issues of identity became increasingly compelling.</page><page sequence="7">THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE JEWS 31 and intellectuals, and in certain ways served as a unifying element in the continuing discourse on the Revolution. Tradition and Change in Alsace-Lorraine on the Eve of the Revolution No assessment of the impact of the Revolution is possible without first examining cultural conditions prior to 1789. Throughout the ancien regime, the Jews of Alsace-Lorraine belonged to a cultural orbit that extended well beyond the eastern border of France. Modes of Talmud study, rabbinic peregrinations and appointments, religious customs, marriage patterns, and liturgical rites indicate that toward the end of the ancien regime the area stretching from Metz in the west to as far as Prague in the east was still a unified religio-cultural entity,8 circumscribing the traditions of western Ashkenaz (as distinct from those of Russia and Poland).9 Young men moved freely between France and central Europe, often driven by a spirit of adventure in their struggles to master talmudic literature.'0 With the growth of Jewish settlement throughout western and central Europe, the phenomenon became 8. The Prague community's inclination toward western traditions has been noted by Eric Zimmer, "Relations of German Jewry to Influences of the Center in Poland in the Early Seventeenth Century" [Heb.], Sinai 102 (1988): 233. Although the precise nature of the bond with Prague is still unclear, we may note that most of the rabbis who served Metz in the eighteenth century had previously held positions in Prague, including Gabriel Eskeles (1694-1703); Abraham Broda (d. 1713); Jacob Reischer (1719-33); Jonathan Eibeschiitz (1742-49). Others, such as Shmuel Hilman, a native of Krotoschin, first went to study in the Prague yeshiva and then held rabbinic positions in Moravia and Germany before coming to Metz. This was also the case for Rabbis David Sintzheim and Moses Munius, both descendants of Prague families, who studied in Prague before assuming positions in Alsace. On westward migrations from Poland, see Moses Shulvass, From East to West (Detroit, 1971). 9. For evidence of strong ties between the Jews of Poland and the Jews of France, see Israel Bartal, "Polish Jews in Southwest Europe in the Middle of the Eighteenth Century," in Changes in Modern Jewish History: Essays Presented to Shnmuel Ettinger [Heb.] (Jerusalem, 1988), pp. 413-437. On their own, these ties do not prove that Metz and Poland were part of the same cultural orbit. The claim of cultural affinity will require additional evidence of shared minhagint, halakhic views, liturgical rites, and linguistic similitude. 10. The practice of leaving home to engage in Torah study was a time-honored tradition intended to broaden the intellectual horizons of budding scholars, and rabbinic literature consistently endorsed the custom approvingly. The phenomenon of the wandering yeshiva student in the medieval period has recently been treated by Mordecai Breuer, "Wandering Students and Scholars-A Prolegomenon to a Chapter in the History of the Yeshivot" [Heb.], in Culture and Society in Medieval Jewry: Studies Dedicated to the Memory, of Haimn Hillel</page><page sequence="8">32 JAY R. BERKOVITZ especially widespread. Owing to the prestige of the Metz yeshiva and the relatively secure conditions in Alsace-Lorraine, many students were drawn to France in the middle decades of the eighteenth century. Though situated on the far periphery of the Ashkenazic world, Metz had, since the early eighteenth century, achieved distinction as a center of western Ashkenazic culture through its distinguished rabbinical leadership and well-funded yeshiva. This prominence was unquestionably made possible by the general economic prosperity in the Metz region, and resulted in a swelling of the student ranks from central and eastern Europe. 1 Young men from Alsace typically began their studies at the local academy, then traveled to Metz, and from there continued at one or more of the yeshivot in Germany. Whatever their origins, the itinerant young scholars wandering from city to city, from yeshiva to yeshiva, served as vital links between the various centers of Torah study and Jewish settlement, thus contributing significantly to the diffusion of knowledge, novellae, books, and manuscripts, and ultimately forging a remarkable measure of cultural unity in the regions they traversed. Marriage patterns of rabbis and yeshiva students, many of whom looked beyond the French border for their prospective mates, undoubtedly gave expression to, and in some instances facilitated, the bonds uniting northeastern France with territories to the east.12 Ben-Sasson, ed. Menahem Ben-Sasson, Robert Bonfil, and Joseph Hacker (Jerusalem, 1989), pp. 445-468. 11. According to R. Jonathan Eibeshutz, superior conditions in the West account for the influx of Polish yeshiva students to Metz. See the statement in his sermon of Av 5509 (1749), published in Ya'arot Devash, 2 vols. (Jerusalem, 1984-85), vol. 2, p. 121. The linkage between economic prosperity and cultural prominence is also argued by Samuel Kerner, "La Vie quotidienne de la communaute juive de Metz au dix-huitieme siecle" (Th6se de Doctorat de 3eme Cycle, Universit6 de Paris, 1977-79), p. 3. The situation in Metz contrasted sharply with conditions in Germany at mid-century. Yeshiva students in Frankfurt complained of not being fed, while the Mainz community was forced to limit its support to four poor yeshiva students. See Shohet, Beginnings of Haskalah, p. 112. 12. The biography of Issachar Berr Carmoly (1735-1781) vividly exemplifies the pattern of movement and the adventurism of his Alsatian peers. A native of Ribeauvill6, he attended the local yeshiva and was subsequently sent to Metz to study under R. Jonathan EibeschUtz. After three years in Metz, having received the title haver (indicating the completion of the first level of rabbinic studies), he was invited by his great uncle, R. Jacob Poppers, alv beit din of Frankfurt am Main, to study there and become acquainted with the German branch of the family. In Frankfurt, Carmoly became a student of R. Jacob Joshua Falk, author of the P'nei Yehoshua, but after a year, returned to Metz, resumed his studies with Eibeschtitz, and then with R. Shmuel Hilman, EibeschUitz's successor, from whom the young scholar received the title rav</page><page sequence="9">THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE JEWS 33 Rabbinic appointments and religious customs corroborate the fluidity that characterized the region as a whole, and also confirm that for much of the eighteenth century Alsace-Lorraine was a point of attraction for rabbis and students from the east. Several factors account for this development. First, in the early part of the century Alsace witnessed a dramatic increase in its Jewish population, and the growth remained steady until the Revolution, while a relative decline in the population of Jews in the same period may be discerned elsewhere on the continent.13 Second, the Metz community followed a tradition of appointing only rabbis who had no family residing in the city, in an effort to ensure the independence of its rabbinic leaders. By recruiting distinguished rabbis from afar, the community was thus able to enhance its prestige considerably. Although communities in Alsace-Lorraine haver. From there he went to Ftirth and studied under R. David Strauss. Carmoly subsequently returned to Nancy, married the daughter of a wealthy parnas of Soultz, and through the influence of his father-in-law was appointed av beit din. Some years later, he established a yeshiva in neighboring Jungholtz. Carmoly was the author of numerous works of rabbinic scholarship, all of which are in manuscript, with the exception of Yam Issachar on Tosefta Beiza (Metz, 1768). See Eliakim Carmoly, "Issachar Carmoly,"Revue orientale 2 (1842): 345-349, 3 (1843-44): 240-244. Shlomo Lvov, another itinerant student originally from Mannheim, studied first in Alsace, then Fiirth, before coming to Metz. He lived in Alsace for the remainder of his life. See the introduction to his Heshek Shlonto, ms. (Dittwiller, 1784), Institute of Hebrew Manuscripts, Jerusalem, no. 8* 3394. Yedidiah (Tiah) Weil (1721-1805), whose father Netanel (author of Korban Netanel) had studied in Metz under R. Abraham Broda, came to the Metz yeshiva himself in 1745 after the Prague expulsion, but returned to Prague, as did most other former Jewish residents, when the order was rescinded in 1748. The institutional framework most directly responsible for the nurturing of scholarly traditions and religious norms was, of course, the yeshiva. Regrettably, no scholarly treatment of the yeshivot of Alsace-Lorraine has yet been undertaken. Bischeim, Bouxwiller, Ettendorf, Mutzig, Nancy, Niedernai, Ribeauville, and Jungholtz are several of the small academies that dotted the terrain of the region. For rare information on the founding of one these academies, see Raphael Blum, "Le fondateur du grand Beth Hamidrash de Bouxwiller," Univers israeelite 35 (1879): 85-88, 112-114. Heading these yeshivot were impressive, though not very well-known, talmudists, including R. Stissel Moyse Enosch, Issachar Berr Carmoly, Wolf Jacob Reichshoffen, Yizhak Netter, Itzik Phalsbourg, and Abraham Isaac Lunteschtitz. Each has left novellae, which together contain rich material for a history of rabbinic learning in pre-revolutionary Alsace-Lorraine. Until this literature, most of which is in manuscript, is studied carefully, it will be impossible to make any definitive judgments concerning the nature of the local scholarly and popular traditions. For an illustration of the exclusively Alsatian character of the body of students at the yeshiva of Ribeauvill6, see the list published in Carmoly, "Issachar Carmoly," pp. 346-347. 13. See the observations of Israel, European Jewro. in the Age of Mercantilism, p. 237.</page><page sequence="10">34 JAY R. BERKOVITZ did not, as a rule, adhere to the foregoing practice, they frequently hired immigrant rabbis as well. The Haguenau community, for example, selected Tevele Scheuer, dayyan in Frankfurt am Main, to serve as its rabbi. Following Scheuer's refusal of the offer, R. Samuel Halberstadt, who had come to Alsace following the 1744 expulsion of the Prague Jewish community, was appointed to the position.14 The election of R. Stissel Moyse Enosch to the position of av beit din of Ribeauvill6 in 1753 reveals the effects that kinship ties might exert on rabbinic appointments. Though a resident of Frankfurt am Main, Enosch was appointed to the Ribeauvill6 post owing to the efforts of his son-in-law, Lippmann Moyses. An influential syndic of the Haute-Alsace region, Moyses succeeded in winning support for his father-in-law over the several other candidates, each of whom was Alsatian.'5 The long-standing ease of movement between France and Germany, as well as the growing presence of immigrants and yeshiva students from the east, may explain the unusual publishing format of Metz siddurimn in the 1760s. These volumes contained all the liturgical variants likely to be used by the diverse local population: nus'haot (rites of) Ashkenaz, Frankfort, Poland, as well as Metz. In addition to the indisputable market advantage of such siddurim, it appears that their composition evinced the socio-cultural 14. On the general history of the Metz rabbinate, see Abraham Cahen, "Le Rabbinat de Metz pendant la p6riode frangaise," Revue des ftrudesjuives 7 (1883): 103-116; ibid. 8 (1884): 255-274; ibid. 12 (1886): 283-297; ibid. 13 (1886): 105-114. The tradition of appointing foreign rabbis was not uncommon; it was also practiced in Fftrth, Altona-Hamburg-Wandsbeck, and Prussia, for example, as indicated in in Shohet, The Beginnings of Haskalah in Gernmany, pp. 93-94. The significance of a "foreign" rabbinate for the religious life and communal affairs of Metz still awaits careful investigation. On the offer to Scheuer, see Eliakim Carmoly, "Notice biographique," Revue orientale 3 (1843-44): 249. Halberstadt gained his appointment with the assistance of his teacher, R. Eibeschiltz. Others, such as Aviezri Auerbach and Lazarus Moyses, who came to Bouxwiller and Haguenau respectively, were undoubtedly attracted by the relatively good conditions in Alsace at mid-century. 15. Although no systematic study of marriage among Jews of the region has yet been done, there is abundant evidence that Alsatians frequently looked eastward for their partners. See Freddy Raphael and Robert Weyl, Juifs en Alsace: culture, socidti, histoire (Toulouse, 1977), pp. 133-134. In part, this was linked to patterns of yeshiva study. For an example of this phenomenon as it related to the relations between Metz and Trbves, see M. Ginsburger, "La Famille Schweich," Revue des etudes juives 47 (1903): 128-131. On the appointment of Enosch, see M. Ginsburger, "Une 61lection rabbinique au XVIII siecle," Univers israelite 58 (1903): 625-628, and the archival sources published by Ren6e Neher-Bernheim, Documents in6dits sur I'entrde des juifs dans la socidt frangaise (1750-1850), 2 vols.

Which liturgical rite a particular community might observe could depend on well-established tradition, or alternatively, on the personal custom of the local rabbinic authority. In Ribeauvill6, for example, the community had adopted the minhagim of Frankfurt upon the arrival of R. Stissel Enosch at mid-century,'7 a development we may assume was not perceived as an extreme innovation. The self-image of communities in northeastern France as being largely undifferentiated from their more eastern counterparts clearly was a reflection of general political and economic conditions promoting the unity of Alsace-Lorraine with territories to the east. Until the collapse of the ancien regime, Alsace-Lorraine and Franche-Comt6 remained virtually detached from the interior of France because of customs restrictions, while trade with foreign countries was unhampered.'" Trends in Jewish culture appear to have been consistent with this state of affairs. Evidence from the realm of halakhah and minhag confirms that the com- munities of Alsace-Lorraine firmly identified with the western Ashkenazic heritage. Rabbi Aaron Worms's Me'orei Or, a seven-volume work of talmudic and halakhic scholarship (Metz, 1789-1831) which represents the single most extensive discussion of ritual practices observed in Alsace-Lorraine before the Revolution, records hundreds of traditions shared by communities in northeastern France and Germany. Faithful to the legacy of halakhah and minhag that had originated with the Maharil, Rabbi Jacob Moellin of Mainz (1356-1427), Worms challenged the authority enjoyed by Rabbi Moses Isser- les in western communities. According to Worms, Isserles had relied much too heavily on Polish minhagim in setting down his glosses on the Shulhan Arukh, while paying insufficient attention to classical Ashkenazic sources.19 16.

BERKOVITZ This challenge to Isserles' preeminence was a bold attempt to reclaim the western tradition to which Alsace-Lorraine and Germany maintained strong historical ties. It was built upon the assertion that the authentic minhag Ashkenaz had its origins in the customs attributed to the Maharil,20 and indeed was consistent with a conception of the geographical landscape of western Ashkenaz articulated in the responsa of Rabbi Joseph Steinhardt one generation earlier. For Steinhardt, who became head of the Ftirth (Bavaria) yeshiva in 1767 after having served as av beit din in the Alsatian community of Niedernai, proximity to the Rhine River was the defining characteristic of the region, and carried important implications for ritual observance. Responding to a query from Alsace, he asserted "that without any doubt, our land [medinatenu] is known as [that of] b'nei Rhinus, since the land [ha-medinah] is entirely along the banks of the Rhine," a definition that presupposed a measure of halakhic uniformity for communities throughout the region. In theory, then, the same customs concerning marriage and divorce, for example, would prevail, regardless of where in the Rhineland a particular ceremony, or dispute, had taken place.21 Steinhardt's reference to b'nei Rhinus suggests that the presumption of regional uniformity rested firmly on a continuous historical tradition that was at least four hundred years old. It should be pointed out, however, that the unity of northeastern France with Germany was undeterred by the diversity of minhagim throughout the region. A central feature in the world of medieval Ashkenaz, diversity was an expression of the importance placed on the cultural autonomy of the city (or town) and its environs. Differences Div. C, vol. 1, pp. 65-72. The standard text of mninhagim of the Maharil is the collection assembled by Zalman of St. Goar, Sefer Maharil, ed. Shlomo Spitzer (Jerusalem, 1989). 20. Varying degrees of disapproval of the Isserles glosses were voiced repeatedly in the central European rabbinic literature, typically accompanied by expressions of reverence for the Maharil. Cf. the stern critique advanced by Hayyim ben Bezalel Friedberg, Viku'ah Mayyim Hayyim (Amsterdam, 1712), introduction, and the implicit criticism of Yair Hayyim Bacharach, Mekor Hayyinz (Jerusalem, 1982). On attitudes toward the Maharil in medieval and early modem halakhic writings, see Benjamin S. Hamburger, "The Historical Foundations of Minhag Ashkenaz," in The Minhaginl of the Worms Commnnunitry According to R. Juspa Shamnash, ed. Israel Mordekhai Peles (Jerusalem, 1988), pp. 101-105, 21.

Overall, pluralism of this sort was legitimized by the preference for local custom over regional uniformity, provided it was consistent with the broad cultural and halakhic framework of the Ashkenazic tradition.22 It is thus clear from linguistic patterns, rabbinic appointments, liturgical traditions, and the general evidence of minhagim, that Jewish life in Alsace-Lorraine was an integral part of a cultural and religious tradition that transcended the eastern border of France. This state of affairs was already in the throes of change approximately two decades before the Revolution. Following the tenure of Rabbis Eibeschutz and Hilman, the Metz yeshiva and community appear to have lost some of their prominence and to have entered a state of decline in the generation preceding 1789.23 According to Shlomo Lvov, author of a 1784 tract bemoaning the erosion in religious standards among Alsatian Jews, yeshiva students were no longer able to count on their status as scholars in order to obtain a good match. Although this complaint was neither new nor limited to Alsace-Lorraine, the length of Lvov's tract, as well as its tone, exhibits a sense of urgency which other sources elsewhere do not contain.24 We may assume that the students' loss of prestige was a reflection of the progressive decline in the role of 22. Various orders of selihot point to the differences in the customs of the Upper Rhine and Metz. Compare, for example, Selihot mi-kol ha-Shanah ke-minhag Alsace (Frankfort am Main, 1691/2) with Seder Selihot ke-minhag ha-Ashkenazimn (Metz, 1768/9). Because virtually all of the rabbinic scholarship in northeastern France has remained in manuscript, it is impossible at present to judge whether the halakhic orientation there was consistent with the aforementioned general cultural patterns. For a preliminary study of these trends, see Jay R. Berkovitz, "Rabbinic Scholarship in Revolutionary France: Rabbi Aaron Worms' Me'orei Or," Proceedings of the Tenth World Congress of Jewish Studies (Jerusalem, 1990), Division B, vol. 2, pp. 251-258. 23. The rabbinic contract offered to Samuel Hilman included the phrase "to restore the crown to its former glory," suggesting that the Metz community may have previously suffered some decline. In the contract offered to Aryeh Loeb Giinzberg in 1766, the Metz community demanded a twelve-year commitment, accompanied by penalties should the rabbi leave before the end of the term. It is conceivable that the community's insistence on a lengthy commitment was motivated by concern over its ability to compete successfully for distinguished rabbinic candidates. The Hilman contract was reprinted in Blatter fur Jiidische Geschichte und Litteratur 1900, pp. 39-40, and the GtInzberg contract was published and annotated most recently by Simon Schwarzfuchs, "The Rabbinic Contract of the Sha'agat Aryeh in Metz," Moriah 15 (1986): 81-90. 24.

BERKOVITZ the yeshiva as a venerated communal institution. While the faltering of the yeshiva was related to a general breakdown of traditional life in the west at the onset of modernity, regional conditions in Alsace-Lorraine accelerated the process. Above all, economic factors contributed decisively to the eastward shift in the center of gravity of the western Ashkenazic tradition. Troubles in the Lorraine region, as seen in diminishing revenues and decreasing salaries in the second half of the eighteenth century, may explain Metz's Jewish population decline and its progressive impoverishment in the same period. The Metz pinkas contains ample evidence of financial difficulties in the Jewish community. Complaints that income did not keep pace with expenses (1772) were reflected in limitations on the number of foreign students admitted to the yeshiva (1780), and in the av beit din's approval of a request that money collected for the yishuv in Eretz Israel be used for local needs instead (1782).25 In Alsace conditions were no better. From 1775 Strasbourg saw its river trade decline in favor of that of Mayence, resulting in a lower volume of sales to merchants in many Rhenish towns.26 All of this was exacerbated by the influx of immigrants from Poland, most of whom were poor. The number of rabbis and their students exceeded the number of available positions, forcing many to migrate to Germany and to Switzerland.27 1, pp. 301-2, and Ezekiel Landau, Derushe Ha-Zelah (Warsaw, 1899) [reprinted Jerusalem, 1966], p. 16a.

Although population figures tend to be unreliable, it is clear that the number granted the right of domicile by the community was on the decline. In the years 1759-1769, twenty-four foreigners were naturalized; the next two decades witnessed a total of thirteen. See Kerner, La vie, pp. 75-77. The rdglement concernant le droit de risidence of February 24, 1780 indicates that economic troubles were increasingly problematic: "Le temps est de plus en plus trouble et le moment exige qu'on erige des remparts pour am61iorer la situation de notre sainte communaut6." Taxes and duties were heavy, and the treasury of the conseil was insufficient to meet its responsibilities.

By the last third of the century, talmudic academies in Frankfurt, Ftirth, and Mayence attracted many students from the French territories, while far fewer came in the opposite direction.28 Naphtali Hirsch Katzenellenbogen, a grandson and student of R. Samuel Hilman in Metz, was sent to the yeshiva of Silesia following the death of his grandfather in 1765. In 1794 he was appointed rabbi of Frankfurt an Oder, where he would remain until after the turn of the century.29 Metz native Daniel Jacob Rottembourg, a student of R. Aryeh Loeb Gtinzberg at the Metz yeshiva, was sent to the Ftirth yeshiva in 1782; after the completion of his studies he remained in Germany, assuming the position of rabbi of Boedigheim (Baden) until his death in 1845. Several accomplished Alsatian scholars also felt the attraction. R. Wolf Reichshoffen, av beit din in Bouxwiller and head of the Ettendorf yeshiva and Bouxwiller klaus, was invited in 1786 to become rabbi of Mayence, but in the end declined the offer.30 R. Joseph Steinhardt, head of the beit din and yeshiva in Niedernai, could not resist a similar opportunity in 1763, despite his general satisfaction with conditions in Alsace. In his introduction to Zikhron Yosef, Steinhardt praised Alsace for its "learned and wealthy men who are God-fearing and pious. . . who strive to maintain the Torah and to give it dignity, and maintain students appropriately." Nevertheless, Steinhardt decided to leave Niedernai in order 28. Information on the yeshivot is extremely scarce. According to local record books, the Frankfurt yeshiva counted 120-130 students in 1780; by 1793, however, the number declined to 60. Figures for Ftirth are not available, except for 1827, the year it closed, when there were, according to one source, 150 students. The yeshiva of Mayence had approximately 50 students in 1782. For a brief summary of these and other yeshivot in the region, see Mordechai Eliav, Jewish Education in Germany in the Period of the Enlightenmenmt and Emancipation [Heb.] (Jerusalem, 1960), pp. 149-153. Statistics for the Metz yeshiva are not extant; however, we do know that the rabbinic contract of R. Aryeh Loeb Giinzberg allowed for the support of 25 students, and that the number of foreign students was at least 60 in 1780. 29. Katzenellenbogen returned to his native Haguenau in 1805 when he accepted the position of rabbi of that community. See Revue orientale 2 (1842): 339. 30. See the letter from Cerf Berr to R. Wolf Reichshoffen, 4 Iyar 5546 (May 1786), published in J. Weil, "Contribution a l'histoire des communautes alsaciennes au 18eme siecle," Revue des dtudesjuives 81 (1925): 169-180. In his summary of the document, Weil mistakenly calculated the date as 1787.

BERKOVITZ to become head of the Ftirth yeshiva because, in his words, "God lifted my banner and my stature ... and brought me here to the glorious community of Fiirth, a great city of Israel, full of scholars and sages, students of Torah and the affluent who maintain them in honor and dignity, [and] this has increased the number of students who follow me."3' The decision to leave Niedernai for Fiirth may be interpreted as further proof that in the ancien regime regional loyalty transcended political boundaries, but in this case, the issue was primarily the growing attractiveness of the east over the smaller communities of Alsace-Lorraine. The fact that Ftirth had become one of the largest and most important Jewish communities in Germany, and was the site of the well-funded and prestigious yeshiva and an important Hebrew press as well, was, without doubt, the critical factor in Steinhardt's decision. Indications of change were also evident in the religious lifestyle of Metz Jewry in the last decades before the Revolution. Paternity suits, instances of pregnancies before and outside of marriage, and the adoption of the mores of the surrounding culture were certainly noted regularly in the Metz pinkas and in the records of the beit din. The repeated condemnations of luxury and of the failure to adhere to the discipline set forth in the sumptuary laws of 1769 suggest that these trends were on the rise, and confirm the well-known criticisms voiced by R. Eibeschutz several decades earlier.32 While there is no reason to question the reliability of these reports, caution should nonetheless be applied in interpreting their significance. It may be assumed that the violations recorded in the communal register were still, for the most part, sporadic. Moreover, there is no evidence that these acts constituted an ideological assault on the authority of halakhah or the rabbis. It is much more likely that those who vilated Jewish law considered their behavior to be a deviation for the normative tradition. The fact that these vilations or excesses had become distressful for community leaders may be 31. Steinhardt, Zikhron Yosef, introduction. 32. Evidence of sexual immorality and claims of a breakdown in discipline are cited by Kerner, La vie quotidienne, pp. 208-218. For examples of Eibeschutz's criticisms, see Ya'arot Devash, sermon of 7 Adar 5504 (1744), vol. 1, pp. 60-61, and the sources noted in Hertzberg, French Enlightenment and the Jews, pp. 164-165, esp. n. 67, and 212-213. Shlomo Lvov, in his Heshek Shlomo, decried the rapidly declining religious standards of his day (1784), and the failure of the rabbinic leadership to exhort the people. The problematics of using musar (moralistic) literature to determine levels of religious observance have been discussed by Barukh Mevorakh in his review of Shohet, Beginnings of the Haskalah, above, n. 2.</page><page sequence="17">THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE JEWS 41 more a indication of a growing awareness that their own power and the authority of tradition were in a precarious state. As for a general weakening in the status of the rabbinate in the northeast, the sources are hardly unequivocal. According to the view of S. Posener, the rabbinate in Metz and Alsace-Lorraine became relatively impotent in communal matters from approximately the 1760s. Posener asserted that Eibeschutz was the last Metz rabbi to impose his authority on the leadership of the community.33 In this same period, rabbinic jurisdiction in civil affairs appears to have become more limited. Following a case in 1759 when a widow appealed to the Metz parlement after having received an unfavorable ruling from the local beit din, Jewish authorities were forbidden by the same parlement from imposing the herem on recalcitrant individuals. In the face of the mounting challenges to traditional authority, and in light of the 1759 restriction, the Metz community's riglement of 1769, which placed strict controls on social, economic, and religious behavior, particularly on individuals who had recourse to non-Jewish courts and authorities, ought to be viewed as an effort to maximize the influence of social pressure. These controls ultimately proved to be ineffective.34 Several years later, in 1777, rabbinic jurisdiction in civil affairs was reconfirmed by the king, only to be subsequently limited by the parlement to those instances when Jews chose of their own accord to submit to Jewish courts.35 On the eve of the Revolution the authority of the Metz rabbinate was certainly no longer absolute as in 33. S. Posener, "The Social Life of Jewish Communities in France in the Eighteenth Century," Jewish Social Studies 7 (1945): 215-217. From the resolution of the conflict between Rabbis Lehmann and Sintzheim we may infer that by the early 1780s the Frankfurt beit din had surpassed the rabbinic courts of Alsace-Lorraine in prestige. The case was submitted to the Frankfurt beit din, which ruled in favor of Lehmann. Moreover, the rabbi of Niedernai was ordered to read the decision publicly in the synagogue. On the conflict and its resolution, see M. Ginsburger, "Familles Lehmann et Cerf Berr," Revue des etudesjuives 59 (1910): 106-130, and Loeb, Les Juifs de Strasbourg, p. 174. 34.

Sorkin asserts that state encroachment on communal autonomy stripped rabbis of their civil jurisdiction, and as a result, Jews turned to non-Jewish courts. In Sorkin's words, "the political interference of the state and mercantilist economics impinged on the Jewish community at the time when its religious leadership was least able to respond forcefully." 35.

BERKOVITZ earlier times, but continued to be rooted deeply in the consent of community members. Voluntary subordination to rabbinic authority was accompanied, invari- ably, by a decline in the stature of rabbinic leadership. The fact that no rabbis were appointed either to the Malesherbes commission (1788) or to the committee charged with drafting the cahiers de doleances for submission to the Etats G6n6raux (1789) is adduced by Posener as further proof that toward the end of the ancien reginme the rabbis were no longer the principal leaders of Jewish life in France. This generalization appears to be contradicted by evidence drawn from Jewish provincial organizations in Alsace. Until the Revolution, the av beit din was still a central communal figure, and where his authority may have eroded, efforts were made by the syndics to strengthen his position. We may resolve the difficulty by noting the distinction which had become significant in the last decades of the ancien rigime between internal community matters, on the one hand, and external political affairs, on the other. Certainly with respect to religious life, family, and education, the rabbis continued to be the major communal force. However, with the prospects of improvement in the political and legal standing of the Jews of Alsace and Lorraine, a cadre of new leaders emerged among men whose influence rested on their economic prowess. Cerf Berr (1726-1793), a large-scale army purveyor, was the best known among a number of prominent Jews who were able to intercede with the government on behalf of their coreligionists. Several of them were in close contact with leading figures of the Berlin Haskalah and were attracted to their ideology, and this enabled them to gain the support of sympathetic gentiles such as Dohm and Lacretelle. Particularly from 1784, when the Jews' right to elect syndics was affirmed, the new shtadlanim came to be viewed by government officials, and probably by members of the local communities as well, as official representatives of the mnedinah, and as such gained a measure of prestige that at least equaled, if not exceeded, the stature of the rabbis.36 36. Posener, "Social Life of Jewish Communities," pp. 217, 202-203. The Jews of eastern France had been excluded from the assemblies which prepared the cahiers de doldances and from the election of delegates to the Etats G6n6raux. After complaints by Cerf Berr, the Jews of Alsace-Lorraine and Metz were permitted to submit a report, though not a cahier, and one rabbi, David Sintzheim, was in fact among the six delegates chosen to prepare the draft. On the preparation of this report, see J. Godechot, "Comment les juifs 61urent leurs d6put6s en 1789," Revue des itudesjuives 81 (1925): 48-54, and David Feuerwerker, L'mnancipation des Juifs en France de l'Ancien Regime at la fin du Second Empire (Paris, 1976), pp. 241-261. On</page><page sequence="19">THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE JEWS 43 Several conclusions may be drawn from the preceding discussion. First, Jewish culture in Alsace-Lorraine appears to have been virtually indistin- guishable from the larger Ashkenazic trends and barely influenced by the French context. Second, the image of a community unified in its loyalty to Jewish tradition on the eve of the Revolution ought to be revised. As Salo W. Baron observed, the dissolution of Jewish communal autonomy in western and central Europe was related primarily to the birth pangs of the modern state and to the general policy of leveling down corporations, a process first discernible in the 1770s. To this may be added a growing dissatisfaction with authority in general and with rabbinic authority in particular from the mid-eighteenth century.37 Whatever the precise cause, evidence of eroding standards of religious observance and a weakening of rabbinic authority in France in the 1770s and 1780s may suggest, then, that the breakdown of the kehillah was partially underway in the cities even before the Revolution and the 1791 decision to relinquish autonomy. Regeneration: Ideological Progress and Social Stagnation The most important long-term cultural development to have resulted from the revolutionary upheaval was the progressive break with the tradition linking the Jews of Alsace-Lorraine with communities of central and eastern Europe. This cultural transformation was not abrupt, but evolved over the course of a half-century. Its development was influenced by a combination of ideological, political, and social factors, including the urgency of rig~ndration, the severe communal crisis of the 1790s, the creation of important institutions under the role of the rabbi in the provincial organizations of the northeast, see for example J. Weil, "Contribution a l'histoire des communautes alsaciennes au 18eme siecle," Revue des etudes juives 81 (1925): 169-180, and the Extrait du protocole de la nation de l'assemblde du 21 lyyar 5537, published in Loeb, Les Juifs de Strasbourg, pp. 181-198.

BERKOVITZ Napoleon, and finally the emergence of a distinct Franco-Jewish identity during the Bourbon Restoration and the July Monarchy. With the Revolution and the promise of a new world, Jewish communal and intellectual leaders encountered difficult struggles on two fronts. Most urgent was the battle for civic equality, which was conducted in the political arena, particularly in the French National Assembly, in the press, and behind the scenes; the second involved an internal debate concerning the nature and scope of the transformation demanded of Jews by gentile critics and supporters alike. Bridging the two struggles was the idea of rdgne'ration, the foremost expression of Jewish accommodation to the prospects of civic equality. Strikingly similar to proposals advanced by maskilim in communities such as Berlin, Koenigsberg, Hamburg, and Prague, idg~inration rested on the prevailing assumption that a dramatic improvement in the socioeconomic and cultural mores of the Jews was necessary before they could become productive members of the larger society. What distinguishes the shaping of Jewish identity in France from parallel developments in central and western Europe, however, was the profound impact of civic equality and the accompanying demand for social integration (i.e., igalite and fraternite) on Jewish consciousness. In the social and political milieu of postrevolutionary France, the ideas of igalite and fraternitu imbued rgie'ndration with an uncommon sense of urgency. Critics and observers of the Jewish scene continually reminded French Jewry that rigeiunration was a sacred obligation upon which the bestowal of civic equality had been conditioned, and it is no surprise that this view was quickly internalized by members of the Jewish communal establishment. Intimations of the new worldview, accompanied by a rudimentary aware- ness of the implications which civic emancipation held for Jewish life in France, were evident in the first reactions to the Revolution.38 Although 38. An appreciation for the critical importance of the reform of Jewish mores was certainly in evidence among some Jewish intellectuals in the years preceding the Revolution, particularly in the writings of Zalkind Hourwitz, Isaiah Berr Bing, and Berr Isaac Berr. Their proposals, which include criticism of the rabbinic leadership, appeals for the elimination of moneylending, the assertion that Jews are obligated by their religion to love members of other faiths, and recommendations for educational reform, bear striking similarity to views advanced by maskilim elsewhere. For a discussion of Hourwitz, Bing, and Berr, see Jay R. Berkovitz, The Shaping of Jewish Identit, in Nineteenth-century3 France (Detroit, 1989), pp. 57-77. My contention in this paper is that the promise of civic equality, and its eventual realization, set the consciousness of French Jews apart from that of their coreligionists abroad.</page><page sequence="21">THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE JEWS 45 the Ashkenazic leadership exhibited considerable apprehensiveness over the surrender of communal autonomy during the two years following the Revolution, enthusiasm for civic equality and duties to the state was unequiv- ocally displayed. From the start, even before the bestowal of citizenship, the Revolution enjoyed wide support, expressed in the enlistment of more than one hundred Jews in the National Guard, including several rabbis.39 For Berr Isaac Berr of Nancy, the Revolution and the bestowal of civic equality were interpreted in profoundly religious terms. Seen as an act of divine providence, emancipation was a modern-day redemptive experience, a reenactment of the liberation from ancient Egyptian slavery. Representations of this sort appear in Berr's writings in conjunction with a related religious motif: the necessity of undergoing self-examination, leading to repentance from the incorrect path. In his view, civic equality constituted an unprecedented expression of confidence in the Jews, one that required corresponding dedication to social and cultural transformation.40 The identification of this transformation with the term rge'~iuration suggests that the process of change was considerably more complex than Berr had initially envisioned. First used in reference to the Jews by Pierre Louis Lacretelle in 1775, rginderation only became part of the vocabulary of the Jewish question in 1788 after it was the subject of the Abbe Henri Gregoire's Essai sur la rigendration physique, morale et politique des Juifs.41 While Gr6goire's precise motivations in arguing for the regeneration of the Jews are still the subject of scholarly debate,42 the religious significance of the 39.

For a similar use of religious imagery, see Gerson-L6vy, Orgue et Pioutini (Paris, 1859), p. 108. 41. On Lacretelle's use of the term rgiendration, see Richard I.

Cohen (Jerusalem, 1991), pp. 148-149, and on Gregoire, pp. 149-162. Gr6goire's work originated as an essay submitted to the competition sponsored by the Soci6t6 royale des arts et sciences de Metz in 1785. It was subsequently revised and finally published in Paris in 1788. 42. The controversial passage in Gr6goire's Essai, p. 132, reads as follows: "L'entiere libert6 religieuse accord6e aux Juifs sera un grand pas en avant pour les r6former, et j'ose le dire, pour les convertir." It is clear that Gr6goire envisioned the eventual conversion of the Jews to Christianity, and that he regarded improved treatment of the Jews and their civic emancipation as laying the groundwork for that eventuality. But whether this was to be achieved through a direct, aggressive policy is another matter. Paul Gruenbaum-Ballin has argued persuasively</page><page sequence="22">46 JAY R. BERKOVITZ word regeneration certainly cannot be dismissed. In the classical Christian tradition, regeneration signified an ideology of spiritual renewal and rebirth, and it is not unlikely that with this in mind Gregoire, a Jansenist, applied the term to the disconsolate plight of the Jews. Under the impact of the Revolution, the term would soon undergo a process of secularization in much the same way as had other religious symbols and concepts.43 The French emphasized the role of their nation as Redeemer of mankind. In a proclamation made on February 21, 1793, the Convention entrusted the armies with the following sacred mission: "If you are victorious . . . nations will embrace each other, and, ashamed of their long-standing error, they will forever extinguish the torch of war. You will be proclaimed saviors of the fatherland, founders of the Republic, regenerators of the universe."44 The Revolution thus appropriated that Gregoire's statements in his Essai and subsequent writings ought to be understood as having mystical significance only. See his "Gr6goire convertisseur? ou la croyance au 'Retour d'Isral,' " Revue des &amp;tudesjuives 121 (1962): 383-398. My sense is that one can legitimately attribute more than mystical meaning to Grdgoire's plan without necessarily concluding that the abbe had missionary objectives. It is not unlikely that Gregoire, like others, expected that the Jews would gradually become convinced of the superiority of Christianity through political and cultural reg~ndration. For an example of the reactionary-Christian position on this subject, compare the view of Louis de Bonald, Mercure de France, February 8, 1806, where the author argued that the rdgineration of the Jews would remain impossible until they first accepted Jesus. 43. For a useful discussion of the meaning of rtgeindration in early Christianity, see Gerhart B. Ladner, The Idea of Reform: Its Impact on Christian Thought and Action in the Age of the Fathers (Cambridge, Mass., 1959), pp. 10-32, 50-51. Ladner notes that in the Gospel of John and the Letter to Titus, rebirth signified spiritual regeneration through baptism, and that the individual Christian "must die with Christ, be reborn in Him, and begin a new life following Him" (p. 51). On the term rigne'ration in its revolutionary context, see Cohen, "Rhetoric of Jewish Emancipation," pp. 145-169, and Mona Ozouf, "La Revolution frangaise et 1'idre de l'homme nouveau," in The French Revolution and the Creation of Modern Political Culture, ed. Colin Lucas, 2 vols. (Oxford, 1988), vol. 2, pp. 213-232. We may infer from the Ozouf article (p. 218) that in the immediate aftermath of the Revolution the idea of regendration was still in transition between its religious and political meaning. As Ozouf points out, for some, such as Lamourette, regendration was the meeting point between Christianity and the revolutionary enterprise. 44.

In the spirit of revolutionary rhetoric, rdgendration would come to represent the basis of a new faith in the future of humankind, led by the France of the Revolution.45 In regineration the French saw the promise of a new era unencumbered by the failings of the past. It embodied the vision of a social and cultural revolution that would complete the work begun in 1789.46 The fact that regendration was applied to the Jews is proof of the comprehensiveness and ambitiousness of that dream. Nevertheless, the shared use of the term regeneration in general and Jewish writings ought not to conceal the widely divergent thinking on what it entailed. For the French, regendration was a break from the past, a rejection of a national history marked by corruption and degeneration. The belief that nothing was worth preserving explains the Revolution's early radical character.47 Accordingly, French expectations for the transformation of the Jewish population were far-reaching. Owing to the links between regeneration and Revolution, the anticipated metamorphosis of the Jews was framed in extraordinarily compelling terms. Its religious, patriotic, and universalistic characterization served as the primary impetus and conceptual foundation for confronting the Jewish question directly. For Jewish leaders, rgeine'ration represented a far less radical proposition. It signified not an outright rejection of traditional values and norms, but the act of restoring to its original state that which had become corrupted over the 45. For additional evidence of the secularization of regeindration, see Gary Kates, The Cercle Social, the Girondins, and the French Revolution (Princeton, N.J., 1985), pp. 99-120. Jews, too, would occasionally use the term rdg~ndration to refer to a universal-secular messianic vision. See, for example, Des riform7es religieuses et du Judai?sme, part un habitat de Metz [anon.] (Metz, 1842), p. 8. For one of the most vivid descriptions of the concept of rdgeiundration, see Philippe Sagnac, La Formation de la sociedtdfrangaise moderne, 2 vols. (Paris, 1946), vol. 2, p. 298: "Mais au-dessus de cet ensemble, le maintenant, le vivifiant, lui donnant le mouvement et la vie, il est un sentiment puissant qui lui communique une 6nergie infinie-infinie comme la religion meme-c'est la foi en la 'reg ndration' de la socidt6 franqaise.

The success of this restorative process would depend on careful historical investigation in order to distinguish between the essential and the nonessential elements of the Jewish religious tradition. For the following two or three generations, discussion of the long-awaited socioeconomic and cultural transformation would be framed principally in religious terms, owing to the consensus shared by virtually all members of the community on the need to invoke the authority of Judaism in support of their respective visions.48 The notion of tradition, though reinterpreted and redefined throughout the nineteenth century, would endure as the linchpin of Jewish identity in France, and suggests that use of the term "secularization" may be an unsatisfactory characterization of French Jewry's ideological transformation. More striking is the markedly conservative conception of tradition espoused by French Jews in the face of swift and dramatic changes in modem society. Explanations for this restraint have proposed that French Jewry's achievement of civic equality without a prolonged political struggle made religious accommodation unnecessary.49 The present analysis takes a different approach, concentrating on developments within the Jewish community in the revolutionary era and after. Initially we may observe that a new Franco-Jewish consciousness emerged very deliberately, apparently slowed by well-established social and cultural patterns which prevailed during the ancien riginme and which continued to influence the nature of Jewish identity in the modern period. Ironically, even the relatively slow progress made on the ideological level outstripped practical efforts at implementation. The leaders of the first generation of emancipated Jewry failed to translate their commitment to regeneration into a concrete program of action. Their failure was due, in large part, to a delay in the transformation of French Jewry-a development that would have far-reaching consequences for much of the nineteenth century. From a comparative perspective, the regeneration of Jewish life in the northeastern provinces proceeded at an exceedingly slow pace. The Jews of Alsace-Lorraine remained largely isolated from the effects of modernization already underway in central Europe at the end of the eighteenth and early 48.

Throughout Bohemia and Moravia, and to a large extent in Hungary, Galicia, and Bukovina, state-sponsored normal schools were established in the 1780s, and within a decade thousands of Jewish children had already attended these institutions. Great strides were also made with respect to vocational training. In Kassel, for example, the Gesellschaft der Humanitit, founded in 1802, assumed responsibility for encouraging Jews to learn artisan trades. Frankfurt's 1807 regulations allowed Jews to learn and pursue trades, and the director of the Philanthropin school resolved to indenture suitable students with Christian masters, and to do the same for nonstudents as well. Toward the same goal, the Society for the Promotion of Industry among the Jews of Prussia was chartered in 1813, following the Judenedikt of 1812. These developments in Jewish schooling and vocational training in the Habsburg Empire and Germanic lands in the last third of the eighteenth century offer striking examples of advanced socioeconomic and cultural transformation achieved independently of political emancipation.50 Modernization clearly preceded the emancipation of central European Jewry. The situation was far different in France. No modern Jewish schools were established until the early years of the Bourbon Restoration, and no sustained effort in the active encouragement of productivization can be discerned until after 1820. The educational program advanced in 1782 by Berlin maskil Naphtali Hirz Wessely, in his Divre Shalom ve-Emnet ("Words of Peace and Truth"), though available through the publication of a French translation the following year, remained a theoretical proposition only, and would not be implemented until several decades later.5" Although the immediate improvement in legal standing heightened the expectation of far-reaching 50.

See Lee Shai.Weissbach, "The Jewish</page><page sequence="26">50 JAY R. BERKOVITZ changes, the transformation of the Jews in France lagged far behind that of their coreligionists to the east. Even two decades after the Revolution the Central Consistory complained that less than 10 percent of Jewish children in Alsace were able to attend public schools, while in Lorraine, according to the prefect of Vosges, only a slightly higher proportion, 20 percent, attended such institutions.52 In the economic sphere change was quite slow in coming. Movement away from commercial activity, especially petty trade and moneylending, was rare, thus serving to buttress conservative trends.53 For the vast majority of Jews of France, emancipation, not modernization, came first. Three general factors account for this delay. First, the surrounding society in eastern France was at a very low cultural level, and the pace of moderniza- tion there was exceptionally slow. The persistence of a traditional orientation was manifested in community organization, family, schooling, religious ritual, and in the remarkably tenacious attachment to patois. Owing in part to the general view that Alsace-Lorraine was still outside the mainstream of French social and political life, relatively little effort was directed at the modernization of rural populations until the last third of the nineteenth century, when the spread of government-sponsored communication and transportation systems succeeded in bringing the modern world into the village.54 Until that point, most Jews of Alsace-Lorraine, like their gentile counterparts, lived in rural districts where social conventions were dominated by religious tradition, still Elite and the Children of the Poor: Jewish Apprenticeship Programs in Nineteenth-Century France," AJS Review 12 (1987): 123-142; Christine Piette, Les Juifs de Paris (1808-1840): la marche vers l'assimilation (Quebec, 1983), pp. 43-44.

The territorial marginality of Alsace-Lorraine in the period preceding the Revolution is evident in the customs restrictions which prevented the region from trading with the rest of France. On this point see Lough, Introduction to Eighteenth Century France, p. 70. The persistence of the view that the region was not an integral part of France accounts for the retrograde conditions well into the nineteenth century. See Weber, Peasants into Frenchmen.</page><page sequence="27">THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE JEWS 51 insulated from many of the social and cultural forces at work in urban areas. Although the Jews of eastern France displayed an impressive commitment to learning French and underwent urbanization more rapidly than their non- Jewish neighbors, the continuation of traditional cultural and social patterns was invariably a product of the general environment in which they lived. Among Jews in rural communities, even well into the nineteenth century, apprehensiveness concerning the dangers of modernity severely limited the effectiveness of separate Jewish regenerative institutions. Fearing the effects of secular studies and the difficulties of remaining religiously observant, many were reluctant to send their children to modern Jewish schools or institutions for vocational training. The endurance of Yiddish as a spoken language, the comparatively high birthrate, the relatively slow movement to the cities, and the rejection of religious reform provide further indications of just how strong the grip of tradition remained.55 A second factor contributing to the slow pace of change was the hostility which the Jews encountered within French society in the aftermath of the Revolution and the bestowal of civic equality. Relations with the general population had been governed by a long-standing tradition of legal exclusion. The plage corporel, residence restrictions, and stringent economic regulations had been renewed periodically throughout the ancien r girme, and indeed the 1784 decree eliminating the plage corporel met with resistance from the general populace.56 The sudden break with this legacy certainly did not gain universal approval, to say the least. In July 1789, after news of the Revolution had reached the countryside, anti-Jewish riots broke out in twenty Alsatian communities. Estimates have between 1,200 and 3,000 Jews injured, while the number fleeing to Basel and Mulhouse may have been nearly 1,000. According to Zosa Szajkowski, the riots must be viewed in their larger context: Alsatian farmers, frustrated by the delay in the law granting them ownership over the land they were working, directed their violence against the nobility and the Church, and in some instances, even against Protestants. Jews, too, were victimized, although in most communities where Jews lived 55. On the general history of rural France in the nineteenth century, see Weber, Peasants into Frenchmen, and on the slow pace of modernization of French Jewry, see Paula Hyman, "Emancipation and Cultural Conservatism: Alsatian Jewry in the Nineteenth Century" [Heb.], in Umah ve-toldoteha, ed.

Loeb, Les Juifs a Strasbourg, pp. 142-153.</page><page sequence="28">52 JAY R. BERKOVITZ there was no violence." Still, the fact that the revolutions of 1830 and 1848 also triggered riots against Alsatian Jews provides some indication of the vehemence and durability of anti-Jewish sentiment, Szajkowski's qualifications notwithstanding. In the early 1790s efforts to deny Jews their newly won legal equality were not uncommon. In Strasbourg, for example, the municipality only permitted the Jews to take the civil oath after a full four months had elapsed following the passage of the law of citizenship,58 while in Bischeim the mayor prevented a group of Jews from voting in an election for justice of the peace.59 In Haguenau the first tribun re'volutionnaire advocated the expulsion of the Jews from the' city. This step was never taken, but the plage corporel did survive for Jews at least until 1796.60 Riots against Jews in Metz in 1792 were suppressed by the municipal council and the military authorities soon after they began, causing little harm.61 The varied expressions of hostility toward the Jews in the aftermath of the Revolution were, nonetheless, a clear vestige of the ancien rigimne that not only persisted despite the new legislation, but was intensified by opponents of the new order. 57. The riots were concentrated in Upper Alsace. Outbreaks were reported in Nancy and Metz, but not as serious. See Szajkowski, "Riots in Alsace during the Revolutions of 1789, 1830, and 1848," Zion 20 (1955/56): 88-91, and Jacob Toury, Turmoil and Confusion in the Revolution of 1848: The Anti-Jewish Riots in the "Year of Freedom" and Their Influence on Modern Antisemnitism [Heb.] (Tel Aviv, 1968). The right of refuge in Switzerland had been obtained in connection with trading permits. The 708 Alsatian Jews who fled to Basel in 1789 were not granted residential authorization, however, only temporary asylum. Cf.

The upheavals of revolution and war severely aggravated economic conditions in a territory where crude industrial and agricultural technology prevailed. Ultimately, the elimination of the feudal order and the introduction of agrarian reforms would transform the French economy, but the short-term economic effects of the Revolution were disappointing. Michael Graetz has recently shown that as a result of this economic standstill, Jewish army purveyors continued, for the next quarter-century, in the role they had played before the Revolution. His study suggests that the transformation of Jewish economic activity thus depended upon macrocosmic changes in industry, agriculture, and banking.62 For the largest number of Jews in Alsace-Lorraine, economic devastation was the most immediate consequence of the Revolution, as is illustrated by conditions in Metz in 1791-92. In an impassioned plea directed at Jewish communities throughout Europe, Metz leaders described the rampant poverty that had overtaken their community. New customs restrictions and the enforcement of laws regulating moneylending had become overbearing. Many were without food, while Torah scholars, formerly maintained by communal funds, could no longer be supported. Less than a year after the bestowal of civic equality, the community had fallen deeply into debt and was threatened with expulsion.63 This situation was by no means limited to Metz. For many wealthy Jewish families in the northeast, the Revolution was the cause of financial ruin. Isaiah Berr-Bing, for one, lost two-thirds of his fortune, while many others experienced similar difficulties.6" Beyond the obvious fiscal impact, the widespread confiscation of property and the loss of fortunes aggravated the difficult conditions in the postrevolutionary era. 62.

BERKOVITZ During the Reign of Terror the situation deteriorated dramatically. The kehillah fell into a state of disorder, while many who publicly observed certain Jewish ritual practices became the victims of a general trend to assail established religions and replace them with the Cult of Reason. In Alsace-Lorraine, especially, the Jewish religion was persecuted: synagogues and yeshivot were either closed down or in a state of disarray, cemeteries were desecrated, Torah scrolls were publicly burned, circumcision was prohibited, and Sabbath observance was punished. Numerous instances of denial of personal freedom were also recorded.65 According to one Jacobin, the demand for the expulsion of the Jews from Strasbourg was justified because "they substitute cupiditd for love of the patrie, and their ridiculous superstitions for reason." The solution, he concluded, would require nothing less than "reg~inration guillotinidre."66 As a result of the deterioration of conditions in Alsace-Lorraine, an entire generation of yeshiva students and rabbis emigrated to Germany, where they pursued their studies. Loeb Sarassin, a native of Bischeim, had attended the local yeshiva until it closed in 1796; he subsequently left for Germany to study at the yeshivot of Mayence, Mannheim, and Frankfurt am Main, only to return to France in 1813 when he was appointed rabbi of Ingwiller. Similarly, Rabbi Samuel Wittersheim of Metz settled in Westphalia after having been ruined financially by the Revolution, and remained there until 1813 before returning to Metz. Others 65.

Memories of the persecution suffered during the Terror have been preserved in various books, manuscripts, and traditions. R. David Sintzheim, for example, described the burning of Torah scrolls and holy books, the closing of the house of study, and his own wanderings in Yad David (Offenbach, 1799), introduction. Others, such as R. Jacob Mayer of Niedernai, were imprisoned, while R. Simon Horchheim of Mutzig was arrested and nearly executed for violating the order prohibiting Sabbath observance. On the latter, see Herz Scheuer, Turei Zahav, Moshe Reis (Mainz, 1874/75), p. 175. Among the most poignant traditions is one describing R. Jacob Gougenheim of Haguenau, who was ordered to turn the keys of the synagogue over to the authorities of the city, and was thereafter prohibited from bearing the title "rabbi." 66. For an example of a pamphlet that criticized the Jews for their alleged idleness, see Les Juifs d'Alsace, doivent-ils etre admis auI droit de citoqens actifs? (n.p., 1790). The Jacobin quotation is cited in Reuss, "Quelques documents nouveaux sur l'antisemitisme," pp. 251-252.</page><page sequence="31">THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE JEWS 55 were not as fortunate in returning to their native land. Rabbi Abraham Isaac Lunteschtitz saw the collapse of the yeshiva he directed in Westhoffen, lost his fortune, and was imprisoned during the Reign of Terror. Failing to find a position in France, he was later selected as rabbi of the communities of Endigen-Lengnau, Switzerland.67 The cumulative impact on the rabbinate was profound. Until 1840 virtually all of the rabbinic positions throughout France were occupied by men who had received their training in German yeshivot.68 Problems did not disappear with the Terror. Various sources point to the persistence of public ridicule, continued discrimination, and widespread persecution well into the nineteenth century. According to a letter sent in 1806 to the Minister of Cults by four Bas-Rhin delegates to the Assembly of Jewish Notables, anti-Jewish sentiment in the villages was spirited; local clergy reportedly were responsible for stirring the general populace to violent acts directed against the Jews and their property.69 Not surprisingly, relatively few Jewish families ventured beyond the security of their communities. In Metz, according to the prefect of Moselle, only twenty-nine Jewish families had left the ghetto.70 The result was the preservation of an unmistakable social distance between Jews and their gentile neighbors in the villages, at least until mid-century. The economic hardship caused by the Infamous Decree of 1808 further depleted the ranks of Jewish communities across Alsace-Lorraine, only aggravating the emigration pattern that had begun in the 1790s. In general, the leaders appear to have been demoralized by these developments.71 67. Only fragments of information on the lives of French rabbis of this period remain.

BERKOVITZ The disruptive effects of the Revolution and the Reign of Terror on Jewish communal life and leadership presented formidable obstacles to the implementation of regenerative proposals. In Haguenau the rabbinate remained vacant until 1808, while Metz was without a chief rabbi during the same period. With the closing of schools and synagogues, and the cessation of the Hebrew press in Metz, no conventional medium permitting an effective call to action was still available. Owing to the crushing effects of the Terror on community institutions, as well as the turmoil that disrupted Jewish life in general, the Jews of Alsace-Lorraine found themselves in the throes of a severe communal crisis that was to leave its mark on Jewish life throughout France for much of the nineteenth century. The state, for its part, was preoccupied with first establishing and then consolidating its power during the 1790s, and therefore took little interest in the transformation of the Jews. In fact, aside from initiating the administrative reorganization of French Jewry in 1808, the state refrained from intervening in Jewish affairs as was done in the Habsburg Empire, where legislation preceded and prompted social change.72 This tendency, which was to continue for some time, was reinforced by the belief that the natural forces of modernization and civic equality would yield the desired results. For nearly thirty years the much-heralded program of regendration was virtually stillborn. The Ideology of Emancipation: Three Stages The long-term consequences of the delay in the modernization of French Jewry were clearly evident in the ideological realm. Owing to the centrality of the idea of civic equality in the Revolution, the course of Jewish emancipation in France remained interwoven with the revolutionary legacy. The emergence of a modem Jewish consciousness would be guided by the progressive interpretation of this legacy, which in turn would depend on political and Reinharz and Walter Schatzberg (Hanover, Mass., 1985), p. 40. Szajkowski, "Riots in Alsace," pp. 82-102. 72. This situation would persist in some areas well beyond the revolutionary era. For example, the training of rabbis in France at midcentury suffered from what Ismar Schorsch has called a "lack of determined government enforcement," in "Emancipation and the Crisis of Religious Authority: The Crisis of the Modern Rabbinate," Revolution and Evolution: 1848 ill German-Jewish History, p. 228.</page><page sequence="33">THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE JEWS 57 social forces within and beyond the Jewish community. The various terms used in reference to emancipation--mancipation int"rieure, emancipation industrielle, mnzancipation civile, and imancipation politique, to name only a few-suggest that Jewish communal and intellectual leaders developed an appreciation for the complexities of emancipation, and understood that for it to be realized fully, the process would unfold only in phases.73 Accordingly, we shall trace the course of ideological transformation through its three principal stages: the Napoleonic era, the Bourbon Restoration, and the July Monarchy. 1. The Napoleonic Era The Napoleonic years represent a critical period of transition when efforts to transform French Jewry were undertaken in accordance with a new vision of the Revolution. Enthusiastic support for the emperor at the turn of the nineteenth century, prior to the unveiling of his policy initiative vis-a-vis the Jews, points to the awakening of deep national sentiment in diverse quarters of the Jewish community. A profusion of literary creativity, dominated especially by Hebrew poetry, flourished among several rabbis and in the small circle of French maskilim. Rabbis Jacob Mayer (Bergheim, Bas-Rhin) and Abraham Cologna (Paris) each published poems honoring the emperor. Hebrew and German poetry exalting Napoleon and his military prowess sprang from the French Haskalah, which counted among its leading figures Moses Ensheim, Elie Hal6vi, and Lipmann Moses Buschental. Several poems composed by Hal6vi in particular reflected an effort to identify with the military campaigns undertaken by the regime. In "Ha-Shalom," composed in 1801, Hal6vi praised France using terms normally reserved for the Land of Israel, and on the occasion of several battles he wrote prayers that were recited in the Paris synagogue.74 We would be in error, however, were we 73.

BERKOVITZ to overestimate the significance of this literature. Although the compositions that appeared in these years may reflect a wish to identify with the state in times of crisis, they belong, more correctly, to a literary genre of the early Haskalah era; they contain no evidence of a new Jewish consciousness. In the first years of Napoleonic rule, Haskalah in France continued to assume the form of a received ideology which imaskilim appropriated from Berlin with only minor modifications, if any." No distinct prescription for Jewish modernization emerged in these years, and in fact activity was limited to literary affairs. Traces of a revolutionary consciousness reminiscent of the optimism of Berr Isaac Berr and Isaiah Berr-Bing can be detected, however, in a pamphlet that appeared in Paris in 1806. Authored by Simon Mayer, the brief tract was issued in response to an essay published by Louis de Bonald on the eve of the Assembly of Jewish Notables, charging that the Jews refused to recognize the laws of the state. Vehemently denying de Bonald's claim, Mayer expressed the view that political emancipation would lead naturally and directly to the integration of the Jews within French society. Mayer boldly asserted the right of Jews to defend their honor, but his confidence in the capacity of the legal and political system to achieve "la rdunion de tous les Frangais" was based on an overly naive assessment of the difficulties inherent in social integration. We may assume that his nafvet6 was typical for the time, and that it would endure until he and other Jewish communal leaders became convinced of the urgency of establishing separate Jewish institutions.76 More significant efforts to confront the new social and political order engendered by the Revolution Mevorakh, Napoleon utekulfato (Jerusalem, 1968). A decade before, Moses Ensheim had composed a Hebrew poem that was recited in the Metz synagogue on October 21, 1792 in honor of the revolutionary victory.

The underpinnings of a new social and political vision on the part of the Jews were first set down precisely at the point when their envisioned transformation was perceived to be at its lowest ebb. Government intervention in Jewish communal affairs during the First Empire was precipitated by the growing disappointment in the socioeconomic regeneration of Alsatian Jewry, but also rested on a new view of the primacy of the state in the promotion of social reform. The Napoleonic program to reform the Jews was a radical departure from the policies pursued during the fifteen-year period following the Revolution. Emancipation had apparently been understood to signify freedom from state interference, but it is evident from examples in central Europe that state intervention was critical to the modernization of the Jews insofar as the state could exert its coercive powers upon the Jewish community. At a time when both French republicanism and the Jews suffered devastating consequences, the Napoleonic regime inaugurated a period of rehabilitation of Jewish life ravaged by a decade of violence and turmoil. Although Napoleon's extremely hostile views toward the Jews culminated in severe limitations on their economic freedom, he nevertheless took important steps to secure the legal foundation guaranteeing their civic equality. This policy was consistent with his general plan to consolidate the changes conceived by the Revolution.77 In this spirit Napoleonic legislation defined the structure of Jewish communal organization and the relationship of Jews to French society, while the convocation of the Paris Sanhedrin demanded that Jewish leaders rethink the relationship of Judaism to the state. While the First Empire was clearly a political and economic setback for the Jews in the short run, the institutional achievements of the regime proved to be of more enduring significance. Egalit" and fraternite" found expression in three areas representing the fusion of the legacy of 1789 with succeeding interpretations: 77. Overall, the most important vehicle for the concretization of revolutionary ideals was the Code Napoleon. Promulgated in 1804, it endowed France with a uniform legal system, codifying the laws produced by various revolutionary assemblies. Equality before the law, freedom of conscience, freedom for trade and industry, and the registration of births, deaths, and marriages by municipal authorities were all reconfirmed by the new civil code. Cf. Lough, Introduction to Eighteenth Century France, esp. pp. 320-332. Formulated slightly differently by Emmet Kennedy, A Cultural History, of the French Revolution (New Haven, 1989), p. 377, "Napoleon synthesized the egalitarianism of the Revolution with the authority and centralization of the old regime."</page><page sequence="36">60 JAY R. BERKOVITZ (1) administrative centralization; (2) the subordination of religion to the state; (3) civic equality and the legal parity of religions. (1) More than any other European nation, the French made great strides toward the achievement of political, social, and cultural unity, principally under the aegis of governmental centralization. Although this objective was not easily realized in the provinces--or, perhaps, precisely because of the difficulty-the drive for unity through centralization came to occupy a prominent place in the consciousness of the general and Jewish elites. It was enhanced by the emergence of the state as a framework for collective action and consciousness, and by the advancing process of emnbourgeoisement. With the influence of unifying concepts such as la mission civilatrice, the Jewish question was included in the more universal vision of la question sociale. Jewish leaders saw in the concept of unity an important ideal that deserved to be nurtured in every way possible. Echoing governmental efforts to impose centralization on the general populace, the unity theme inspired the invention of certain ritual ceremonies, such as the initiation religieuse, the quest for a fusion of the Ashkenazic and Sephardic liturgies into a single rite, and the attempt in 1856 to ratify halakhically acceptable reforms for communities throughout France. Centralization made it possible not only to promote regenerative programs in the outlying provinces but also to foster the highly valued sense of unity. To the extent that unity was successfully realized, the achievement represented a significant departure from the mentality of the ancien rigimne, where local and regional forces were paramount.78 In most instances, however, "unity" was still a reflection of the mythic Revolution, and would remain elusive for much of the century. (2) Emboldened by his success in defining the respective spheres of influence of church and state, Napoleon sought to clarify Judaism's position vis-a-vis civic duties by convening an assembly that could speak authorita- tively for the Jewish population of his empire. These efforts, culminating in the convocation of the Paris Sanhedrin in 1807, played a critical role in the shaping of a distinctive consciousness among French Jews. The Sanhedrin owed its prominence to the undisputed view that fraternite ought to serve as the exclusive mediating principle between the Jewish religion and French society. In this regard the assembly was able to rely on the proposition 78. See Theodore Zeldin, France, 1848-1945: Politics and Anger (New York, 1982), pp. 16, 20; Weber, Peasants into Frenchmen, pp. 95-96; Berkovitz, Shaping of Jewish Identitr, pp. 148-149.</page><page sequence="37">THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE JEWS 61 advanced by Mendelssohn that Judaism need not clash with the secular state.79 Conflicts between the duties demanded of Jews by Judaism, on the one hand, and the state, on the other, were to be resolved in favor of the latter, thus mirroring a general trend to relegate religion to a secondary position in society. To this proposition the French rabbis lent their qualified support. Leaving nothing to chance, each of the riglements issued by the Consistoire Isra6lite required them to teach the decisions of the Sanhedrin in their sermons, while the text of the decisions was reproduced in every textbook approved for use in Jewish schools. In one instance the public pronouncements of the Paris Sanhedrin penetrated the more insular world of rabbinic learning; the ideal of fraterniti found expression in the talmudic novellae of Rabbi Aaron Worms of Metz, who asserted that from the standpoint of Jewish law, Christian Frenchmen ought to be regarded as brothers in the civil sphere.80 For the authoritative interpretation of emancipation; its answers and doctrinal decisions formed a new and central text for subsequent generations. Beyond its accommodationist posture, however, the Sanhedrin was viewed as having defined the limits of emancipatory transformation. The absence of any reference to religious reform, either in the question addressed to the assembly or in the assembly's responses, confirmed for contemporaries and their descendants that political loyalty and a commitment to social integration alone were the basis of French citizenship. Even fifty years after the convocation, the authority of the Sanhedrin was still in force among all sectors of the community, though subject to differing interpretations. Religious reformers and staunch conservatives alike found in the Sanhedrin's decisions clear proofs to bolster their positions. For all intents and purposes, however, the Sanhedrin removed the question of ritual reform from French 79. For a discussion of Mendelssohn's views on this issue, see Alexander Altmann, Moses Mendelssohn: A Biographical Study (Philadelphia, 1973), pp. 465-468. 80. See Salon W. Baron, The Jewish Community, 3 vols. (Philadelphia, 1942), vol. 2, pp. 115-116, and Katz, Tradition and Crisis, pp. 85-86. Aaron Worms had been a delegate to the Assembly of Jewish Notables and the Paris Sanhedrin. Toward the end of his life, after having served as community poseq, dayyan, and teacher in Metz, he was named chief rabbi (in 1831). In the final volume of his major work, Me'orei Or (Metz, 1831), vol. 7, pp. 10b-llb, commenting on the talmudic discussion of b'nei Noah, Worms cited the address which he had made before the Paris Sanhedrin on the status of gentiles according to Jewish law. Worms's discourse was clearly the foundation for the assembly's pronouncements on attitudes toward Frenchmen, and specifically on the subject of moneylending; see Berkovitz, "Rabbinic Scholarship in Revolutionary France," pp. 251-258.

BERKOVITZ Jewry's political agenda, and thus undercut the movement to refor the Jewish religion."8 (3) The principle of parity among the major religions advanced the legal status of French Jewry well beyond the condition of Jews in other lands. Under Napoleon Judaism was granted the status of an officially recognized religion alongside Catholicism and Protestantism. Although a quarter-century would pass before Jewish clergy were declared to be salaried employees of the state, as Catholic and Protestant ministers had been early in the century, the application of religious parity to the case of the Jews was entirely unprecedented and without parallel. The principle of parity is a good example of a revolutionary concept that required time to be implemented fully. As we shall see below, for French Jewry the idea and its realization would act as a powerful influence on their political and cultural orientation. Each of the aforementioned three areas found institutional expression in the consistorial system, the communal organization established by Napoleon in 1808 in accordance with the structure devised for non-Catholic minorities. As the sole recognized framework for the administration of internal Jewish affairs, and as the body representing Jewish concerns before the government, the Consistoire Isra61ite was the foremost instrument in the realization of the government's plan for regenerating the Jews. The consistory strove for administrative centralization, adamantly and successfully rejecting any effort to compete with its authority. Despite the persistence of divisions over regionalism versus centralization, tradition versus reform, and unity versus diversity, all institutions under its control tended to be pluralistic, and therefore moderate. Makers of religious, educational, and social policy had no alternative but to strive for an ongoing modus vivendi that produced a de facto cooperative spirit. Together on various educational committees sat 81. On the Paris Sanhedrin, see Simon Schwarzfuchs, Napoleon, the Jews and the Sanhedrin (London, 1979) and Frances Malino, The Sephardic Jews of Bordeaux (University, Ala., 1978). The use of the decisions of the Sanhedrin to strengthen the arguments of religious reform is quite well known. See, for example, David Philipson, The Reform Movement in Judaism (New York, 1931), pp. 149-163. One example of reliance on the Sanhedrinal decisions by opponents of religious reform is a letter from Rabbi Salomon Klein of Colmar to the Minister of Instruction Publique et les Cultes, in Archives Nationales F19 11037, December 31, 1856. Klein argued that in recommending certain ritual reforms, the 1856 Paris rabbinic conference had violated the religious status quo as set forth by the Sanhedrin and subsequently confirmed by the Napoleonic regime.</page><page sequence="39">THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE JEWS 63 rabbis, communal leaders, and proponents of religious reform."2 The faculty of the Ecole Rabbinique of Metz included traditional rabbis who adamantly rejected the idea of religious reform, and some whose position on the issue was virtually identical to that of Rabbi Zacharias Frankel, founder of the movement for Positive-Historical Judaism.83 Owing to the primacy of unity, there emerged a consensus on the necessity of moderation, at the very least at the level of formal relations in the community. This commitment to moderation provides an additional explanation for the absence of a successful movement to reform the Jewish religion. Radical religious reform in Germany-as contrasted with more restrained religious modernization-fed on deep social and religious divisions within the Jewish community. In France the structure of the Jewish community imposed the notion of public discipline in religious matters and political affairs, thus making it extraordinarily difficult for such a movement to emerge.84 While these important developments stemmed from the Napoleonic effort to institutionalize the ideals of the Revolution, they were manifested only much later. During the quarter-century following the Revolution, virtually 82. In 1841 the Metz primary school administrative committee, for example, was composed of the local chief rabbi, Lion-Mayer Lambert, and several nlaskilinm. On this, see Archives isradlites de France 2 (1841): 538. 83. The dcole rabbinique of Metz exemplifies the pluralism that prevailed in French Jewish life. S. Krotger, one member of the Talmud faculty who had been associated with Frankel before assuming a position at the Metz school, issued a sharp attack against R. Samson Raphael Hirsch for having criticized the 1856 Paris rabbinical conference. In a pamphlet entitled De la conmpetence de M.S. R. Hirsch, rabbin de la conlfrrie religieuse a' Francfort-sur-Mein (Paris, 1856), KrUger expressed the widely felt Franco-Jewish rejection of the denominationalism that came to dominate Jewish life in Germany. Condemning religious extremism, KrUger warned Hirsch that his style of orthodoxy had no chance of success in France inasmuch as French Jewry was protected from the abuse of rabbinic authority by the consistorial system. 84. Although the consistories were apparently overburdened by bureaucratic duties, and therefore failed to provide effective leadership for the modernization of French Jewry, they nonetheless did play an absolutely decisive role by providing both a formal administrative structure and, no less important, a framework of symbolic unity. On the consistorial system, see Phyllis Cohen Albert, The Modernization of French Jewry: Consistory and Commnunity in the Nineteenth Centutry (Hanover, Mass., 1977). The absence of a religious reform movement is generally explained by the potent forces of cultural conservatism in the rural northeast and the resistance of the region's rabbinic leadership to ritual innovation. See Albert, pp. 263-265, 290-302, and Berkovitz, Shaping of Jewish Identityr pp. 187-188, 210-214. My emphasis here on the structural impediments to religious reform stresses the Napoleonic foundations of this phenomenon.</page><page sequence="40">64 JAY R. BERKOVITZ no Jewish initiative, either communal or otherwise, was taken in response to the enormous changes that had transformed France. But the foundations for a new vision shared by all sectors of French Jewry, irrespective of ethnic heritage, geographical origin, or religious orientation, had been secured. In the century-long debate over the challenges posed by emancipation, these premises would be very rarely contested; they served as the starting point for all future discussion. Divisions would center, instead, on determining the limits of social integration and cultural adaptation. 2. The Bourbon Restoration The restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in 1815 inaugurated an era marked initially by optimism concerning the Jewish condition. The ordinance on primary education (1816) provided the legal foundation for the establish- ment of modern Jewish schools, and it was this law which was later viewed as signaling a return to the authentic ideals of 1789. Under the Napoleonic regime there had been virtually no public discussion of the Jews' position in the state. The tight grip of the emperor made this impossible. Only with the defeat of Napoleon in 1815 was the Jewish question once again brought to the attention of the public, a development that may be explained, in part, by a degree of openness characterizing the early years of the Bourbon Restoration. More importantly, the deterioration of the Jewish condition in central Europe, particularly in those territories where emancipation had been granted and subsequently withdrawn, stimulated new interest among the French. Charles-Joseph Bail, formerly responsible for the administration of the Bonapartist Kingdom of Westphalia, published the first book of the post-Napoleon era to decry the intolerance and legal discrimination directed at the Jews of Frankfurt, Hamburg, Lubeck, and other free cities. The ensuing debate regarding the compatibility of Judaism with the duties of citizenship extended for several years, focusing on French Jewry's slow transformation. Concern about purported obstacles posed by the Jewish religion was expressed routinely, although the spirit of these discussions was generally constructive.85 85. The literature on the Jewish question in Restoration France is too vast to cite here. Two of the best-known works are Charles-Joseph Bail, Des Juifs au dix-neuvimnze sidcle (Paris, 1816) and Agricole Moureau, De 'incompatibilitr entre le Judaitsme et 1'exercise des droirs de cirt et des moyens de rendre les Juifs citoyens (Paris, 1819).

This occurred only upon the demise of Napoleon, as a renewed confidence in France's commitment to its revolutionary heritage reverberated distinctly within the Jewish community.86 In the political arena and at the communal level, French Jewry displayed a vitality that contrasted sharply with the lethargy of the preceding twenty-five years. Within a fifteen-year span the first Jewish periodical to appear in French, 1'Isradlitefrangais (1817-18), was published; modern schools in the spirit of the German Haskalah were established; a central rabbinical seminary was created; the Hebrew press in Metz resumed its work after nearly two decades of inactivity; and the first steps in the emergence of modern Jewish scholarship were taken. These developments signify a conspicuous departure from the cultural patterns of the ancien rigime, having stemmed from the discontinuity and disruption engendered by the Revolution and the subsequent upheavals. The result was a progressive break with the tradition linking the Jews of Alsace-Lorraine with territories to the east. Slowly, a distinct Franco-Jewish identity, driven by powerful political, economic, and cultural forces set in motion by the Revolution itself, began to crystalize, and was fortified by the return to France of rabbis and maskilim who had emigrated to Germany during the Napoleonic years. Whether the repatriation of members of French Jewry's intellectual elite was a response to the deteriorating conditions in central Europe or an expression of faith in France is difficult to ascertain. Whichever the case, of R. Lion-Mayer Lambert, who returned to Metz from Frankfurt Alsace generated a considerable literature. For a survey of this material, see. Berkovitz, Shaping of Jewish Identit?, pp. 45-56. On the debate that began with the appearance of Bail's book, see Abraham Cologna, Quelques observations sur la deuxiemne idition de I'ouvrage intitule "Des Juifs au XIXe siecle" de M. Bail (Paris, 1817); Antoine Isaac Silvestre de Sacy, Lettrae M.***, Conseiller de S.M. Le Roi de Saxe, relativement a l'ouvragenment intituld: "Des Juifs au XIXe sikcle" (Paris, 1817); and Abraham Cologna, Rdflexions adressdes a' M. Le Baron S. de S. (Paris, 1817). 86. Typical of the optimism voiced in the early years of the new regime is the characterization of the 1814 Charte by Jewish community leader Alphonse-Theodore Cerfberr: "le vaste et magnifique edifice d'une legislation nouvelle, temple sainte oi sont grav6es les libert6s publiques, les s6curit6s nationales," in Observations sur les voeux mis par les Conseils generaux des dipartenzens du Haut et Bas-Rhin, relativenent aux mesures a' prendre contre les Juifs, par suite de Dicrit du 17 mars 1808 (Paris, 1817), p. 9.</page><page sequence="42">66 JAY R. BERKOVITZ in 1816 although no position awaited him, it was said that his decision was motivated by loyalty to his native land. The appearance of l'Isra"lite frangais in 1817 offers a valuable index of the new political outlook of French Jewry. Clearly, the journal was the product of efforts to thwart the extension of the residential and economic restrictions of the 1808 "Infamous Decree" beyond its original ten-year term. Already in 1814 the Conseils Gendraux of the Haut- and Bas-Rhin had demanded that the 1808 regulations remain in force, apparently fearful that the new regime might permit the law to expire. Aware, then, that an attempt would undoubtedly be made in 1818 to reintroduce the discriminatory law, Jewish leaders already began to lay the groundwork for the political struggle early in 1816. Arguing that the 1808 law was a violation of the status of the Jews as citizens, representatives of the five departenments comprising Alsace-Lorraine were able to win support among public officials. A year later, with the publication of the journal in Paris, where the matter would ultimately be decided, the Paris Jewish community assumed a leading role in the struggle. Relying on 1'Isradlite frangais to bring the issues before the general and Jewish public, Paris leaders succeeded in galvanizing the support needed to defeat the petition.87 Underlying the political orientation of the French-Jewish elite was the conviction that full emancipation would be achieved only with a total dedica- tion to improving the public image of French Jewry. This view was expressed repeatedly in the pages of l'Isra"lite frangais. The fact that literary and intellectual affairs were largely subordinated to the practical concerns of a population unsure of its future only supports our contention that in the first years of the Restoration Jewish leaders were preoccupied with the political challenges facing their communities. The new Franco-Jewish spirit, then, assumed a predominately political character, marked by an abiding faith in, and commitment to, the ideals of the French Revolution. Significantly, once the battle against the renewal of the 1808 riglement was successfully completed, the new journal lost its raison d'&amp;tre and ceased to appear.88 87.

Although the journal did offer a forum for discussion of religious, philosophical, and literary subjects, political issues were accorded the highest priority, as is evident from the following excerpt appearing in the journal's introduction, pp. ii-iii: "C'est pour arriver plus</page><page sequence="43">THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE JEWS 67 Efforts to establish Jewish primary schools where children were to receive secular and religious instruction in accordance with modern pedagogical techniques came to fruition beginning in 1818, when the first such institution was opened in Metz. By 1821 twelve Jewish public schools, all consistent with the educational philosophy of the Haskalah, were established in the seven departmental consistories. The history of Jewish education has received more attention than most other aspects of Jewish life in nineteenth-century France, and there is no need to repeat the findings of that research. Insofar as our interest here concerns the timing of this development, however, several observations are in order. The new Jewish schools were created after nearly thirty years of discontinuity, and their objectives were defined in relation to vastly different conditions than those that prevailed in Germany when the movement for educational reform began. In late-eighteenth-century Germany, enlightened Jewish schools founded by maskilim were intended as vehicles for either progressive social change or more radical restructuring of Jewish values. Their beginnings coincided with the crisis in religious authority which was then enveloping German-Jewish communities.89 The French schools, by contrast, were much more conservative, insofar as their mission was to serve the goals of rebuilding (or regenerating) the Jewish community. Frequently the product of individual or private initiative, the schools were fully consistent with the publicly articulated goals of rig~inration, and therefore received the unqualified support of communal leaders. Because rabbis were full partners in the community leadership structure, they were, for the most part, strong supporters, not antagonists, of the movement for educational modernization in France. Rabbinic involvement was crucial for whatever success these ventures enjoyed, owing to the central role of the rabbi and the synagogue in Jewish life, particularly in Alsace-Lorraine. No less importantly, the communal rabbis promptement ' cette solution, et par consequant a une amelioration desir'e par les gens de bien et commandde par l'esprit du siecle, qu'on publie l'Israelite franpais.

BERKOVITZ were a consistently conservative influence on the character of the movement for educational reform.90 The activity surrounding the creation of a rabbinical seminary in 1820, though perhaps less familiar than that of the primary schools, furnishes an illuminating example of the new trends. First, the establishment of the institution rested on popular support. The organizational framework used to found the Metz primary school was employed for the establishment of the 6cole talmudique de Metz, and in 1820 subscriptions for fundraising were set up.91 The Hebrew appeal for support contains the following description of the situation: On account of the distress of the times, the Torah is forsaken, abandoned to the side, and no one inquires after it. Everyone has gone his own way, turning to vanities of this world, placing trust in the idols of silver and gold, without giving attention to the eternal world. Nearly lost is the wisdom of God. ... Anguish filled our loins, as we recall how the splendor of Israel was cast off. Alas! Lonely sits our community, once she was the joy of the entire world, which included dialecticians and cuckolds. Torah and greatness are inseparable. The attempt to recall the glory of the Metz yeshiva was heightened by the fact that the new rabbinical school was placed in the old yeshiva building. However, it is clear that a very different direction was envisioned by the founders of the new institution. Their intention was "to form a school enabling Jewish youths to rise from one level to another, ascending upon the ladder reaching heavenward, so as to be nourished by the Talmud and poskim, and even by the other essential subjects, derekh/ eretz, will the young then satisfy their hunger, to find favor and understanding before God and men." The influence of the Haskalah, which placed emphasis on graduated education and on the importance of derekh/ eretz, is especially apparent here. Moreover, in contrast with the period preceding the Revolution, when entrance to the yeshiva was limited to the very best students, the nineteenth century witnessed a dramatic liberalization of admissions standards, permitting any student "who has an open heart" to study there.

First, for all intents and purposes, the establishment of the Metz rabbinical school put an end to the many local yeshivot which had reopened or were founded anew in the first decades of the century. This network of small academies corresponded, at least organizationally, to the prerevolutionary pattern. In time, the yeshivot across Alsace-Lorraine eventually fell victim, as did other local academies in Europe, to the dominant forces of centralization emanating from the state and supported by Jewish proponents of refonrm. Second, the rabbinical facility attracted French students only, and in this respect reflected, perhaps even strengthened, the distinctively French identity of the Jewish citizens of France. In the first class of matriculants in 1829, ten of the eleven students were born in Alsace-Lorraine, and the eleventh, though born abroad, was a resident of France. Thirty years later, as the school prepared to be transferred to Paris, it was reported that all 109 students who had attended the institution during the years 1829-1859 had been French citizens.93 The Hebrew press in Metz, though revived (in 1813) shortly before the end of the Napoleonic regime, was at once guided in its work by the opportunities available during the Bourbon Restoration and influenced by the disruptive effects of the preceding two decades on Jewish cultural and intellectual life. From its inception in 1764 until its doors were closed in 1793, the Metz press published fifty-two titles that included biblical commentaries, talmudic texts and novellae, responsa, liturgical compilations, Hebrew calendars, two volumes of Haskalah literature, and one Hebrew grammar.

A comparison with the list published after 1813 reveals a vastly different circumstance. Among the thirty-eight titles that appeared between 1813 and 1843, only a handful of works of traditional talmudic scholarship were published. The vast majority of publications can be classified in the following categories: prayerbooks (9), textbooks and catechisms (10), and calendars (9). Particular emphasis was placed on translations of Hebrew texts, first into German, and after several years into French. Clearly, the post-1813 list was intended for a public that had seen a decline in its knowledge of Hebrew and a reduction in the number who were either capable of or had an interest in traditional rabbinic learning. Finally, the absence of any titles composed by foreign authors, in addition to the gradual disappearance of liturgical variants in the prayerbooks, suggests the growth of an independent Franco-Jewish consciousness.94 The new involvement in modern Jewish scholarship exemplifies, in quite a striking manner, French Jewry's evolving perspective on emancipation and tradition. Though undeniably nurtured by the example of the German Wissenschaft des Judentums movement, the roots of Jewish scholarship in France are more correctly located in an entirely different social and intellectual framework. For German Jewry, Wissenschaft des Judentums was the product of the failure of political emancipation. The Congress of Vienna and the rise in anti-Jewish rhetoric and hostility in 1816-19, culminating in the Hep-Hep riots, set the stage for a novel response to the challenges of modernity. The purpose of the Verein fur Kultur und Wissenschaft der Juden was to eradicate the negative image of the Jew by emphasizing the universal values of Judaism. Most Verein members were not ritually observant and saw their involvement in the group as a way of strengthening their attenuated ties to Judaism. Some, such as Eduard Gans and Heinrich Heine, ultimately converted to Christianity.95 In France Jewish scholarship emerged not as a response to anti-Jewish hostility, but as an expression of confidence in the prospects of emancipation. Its character was shaped by a small group of 94. Until recently the most complete list of titles issued by the Metz press was published in Eliakim Carmoly, "De la typographie hebraique ' Metz," Revue orientale 3 (1843-44): 209-215, 283-289.

Its development was slow, principally because of the small number interested in the subject.96 Several of the leading personalities only returned from Germany upon the demise of the Napoleonic regime. In fact, however, the time spent in Germany permitted contacts with Zunz, Jost, and others, thus contributing in no small way to the character of Jewish scholarship in France. This influence notwithstanding, the nascent French movement of itudes juives developed a special character which it owed primarily to local conditions. Ultimately, the degree to which Jews were received into the general circles of scholars, as well as Jewish perceptions of the dangers posed by the continuing Christian imprint on French culture, would exert considerable influence on Jewish scientific research in France. The singularity of Franco-Jewish scholarship, particularly its relationship to emancipation, may be observed in the two successive stages of its devel- opment. Initially, Jewish and Christian scholars were drawn together by a common interest in Hebrew language and Semitic texts, despite the chasm still separating Jews from the mainstream of French society in the first decades of the century.97 With the creation of the Soci6t6 Asiatique in Paris in 1822, Jews and Christians were able, for the first time, to participate in joint scholarly ventures. This opportunity, however, was short-lived. Owing to the resurgence of Catholicism, beginning with the accession of Charles X to the throne in 1824, Jews lost much ground in their quest for social acceptance and equality, while Jewish-Christian collaboration became virtually impossible. From this date, no new Jewish members were admitted to the Soci6t6 Asiatique, and those who had joined earlier were entirely inactive during the last years of the Restoration. Opportunities for less conspicuous relations were limited to individual cases, such as Salomon Munk, who studied Arabic with Sylvestre Schorsch, "Breakthrough into the Past: The Verein fur Cultur und Wissenschaft der Juden," ibid. 33 (1988): 3-28. 96. In a letter to Leopold Zunz (October 7, 1822), Sylvestre de Sacy warned that while he had the greatest respect for the work of Wissenschaft des Judentums, the utility and difficulty of the work would be appreciated only in Germany. With respect to the scholarly elite, de Sacy's views on the lack of enthusiasm among French Jewry were certainly not borne out, though his remarks were accurate insofar as the general Jewish public was concerned. De Sacy's letter appeared in Zeitschrift fur die Geschichte der Juden in Deutschland 5 (1892), "Aus Leopold Zunz' Nachlag," pp. 223-268. The quotation appears on pp. 259-260. 97.

Only after the 1830 Revolution, however, was there a revivification of Jewish membership in learned societies and a resumption of regular scholarly collaboration.98 As we shall see below, Jewish studies during this second stage would assume an entirely different character. 3. The July Monarchy Political, legal, and social developments under the constitutional monar- chy of Louis-Philippe opened a new chapter in the history of French Jewry--one that was characterized by an intensification of the emancipation dynamic. During the thirties, a decade when France became, in the words of Maurice Liber, "le foyer du libe'ralisme en Europe," extensive efforts to return to the ideals of 1789 were undertaken through a variety of government initiatives. As far as the Jews were concerned, unprecedented opportunities for social integration and professional advancement were slowly becoming available in major urban centers. By mid-century, a secular, liberal philosophy fostered an atmosphere of greater social acceptance, enabling many Jews to make impressive strides in realizing the promise that the Revolution had extended to them.99 The full legitimization of the Jewish religion was an important factor in the shaping of a new identity. Under the law of February 8, 1831, Jewish clergy were placed on a par with Catholic and Protestant ministers, as the state assumed a part of the financial burden formerly borne by the Jewish community in paying its clergy and in maintaining its educational institutions. In fact, the law gave the Jews of France a measure of confidence previously unknown. Community leaders forthrightly demanded equal support for Jewish educational establishments, basing their claims exclusively on the principle of egalite.'1? But much more importantly, the law signaled a new stage in the full realization of the revolutionary ideal: the Jews and Judaism were recognized 98.

This last area of responsibility, a natural outgrowth of the revolutionary idea of universal brotherhood, acquired special significance in this era, owing to the rehabilitation of a religious orientation in French society and culture. Taken very seriously by the Jews, social integration was understood to require the fulfillment of certain duties by the rabbi in his capacity as representative of Judaism vis-a-vis the non-Jewish community.102 101. In the estimation of contemporary observers, both Jewish and gentile, the law of February 8, 1831 signified the final step of emancipation. According to the 1843 report of the prifet of the Bas Rhin, "la veritable emancipation des Israelites ne date pas de la loi qui a proclam6 leur 6galit6 civile et politique avec les Chr6tiens, mais de celle par laquelle l'Etat a reconnu leur culte et declar6 que ses ministres seraient salari6s par la loi . . . lorsque les Israel1ites virent leur culte et ses ministres mis sous la protection de l'Etat et trait6s l'6gal des cultes chr6tiens, ils commencerent seulement a croire A l'6tendue de leur libert6 civile et religieuse. Cette croyance les releva ' leur propres yeux, leur donna de l'assurance et les conduisit a se depouiller dans leur relations avec leur concitoyens des autres cultes, de cette humilit6 rampante, resultat de leur longue oppression. La nouvelle loi ne manque pas non plus son effet sur la population chretienne a qui cet acte 16gislatif apprit ' accepter une egalit6 plus positive, avant l'objet de son dedain. Alors une nouvelle 're commenya pour les Juifs." This excerpt is cited in David Cohen, "L'Image du Juif dans la societ6 franqaise en 1843 d'apres les rapports des prefets," Revue d'histoire cononique et sociale 55 (1977): 84-85. The law of 1831 was understood to be of greater significance than the 1844 abrogation of the more judaico, which was regarded more as an embarrassment than a serious legal disability. Emphasizing the symbolism of the more judaico, Samuel Cahen, for example, referred to it as "ce dernier vestige de barbarie d'un autre age," in Archives israelites de France 6 (1845): 104. 102. The duty of representing the Jewish community to the general public can be observed in the sermons pronounced at ceremonies marking the initiation religieuse and the dedication of new synagogues. The public nature of these events, at which Christian clergy, local officials, and townspeople were present, extended an opportunity and a challenge to Jewish leaders to improve the image of Judaism. The incessant efforts made by leaders of the consistory and the rgegnirateur movement to persuade rabbis to preach in French were related to this goal. Only the French-speaking rabbi, it was argued, would be able to represent Judaism appropriately to the larger, Christian society. After citing an excerpt from a local Nancy newspaper reporting on the sermon pronounced by R. Salomon Ulmann at the inauguration of the synagogue in Chateau-Salins in 1844, the Archives israelites stated the following: "Le temps est pass6 ob les catholiques allaient ' la synagogue pour en rire. La dignit6 est rentr6e dans le temple de Salomon avec l'6mancipation civile des juifs. Puissent-ils comprendre tous les avances de la soci6t6 frangaise a leur 6gard, et 61ever leurs coreligionnaires des classes inf6rieures a la hauteur du titre de citoyen franqais." In the view of the Archives israelites, the matter was at the heart of emancipation. See Archives israelites de France 5 (1844): 868-869.</page><page sequence="50">74 JAY R. BERKOVITZ Greater emphasis on the social dimension of emancipation rested on another fundamental principle of the Revolution: that citizenship was a public and political expression of an idealized, extended family. Repeated references to la grande famille frangaise, both in Jewish and gentile sources, attest to the spread of the Revolution's social doctrine. Actually, the expectation and demand that the Jews become absorbed into the French "family" had been voiced decades earlier. Napoleon was of the opinion that the Jewish problem would be solved, ultimately, through intermarriage, and this view was repeated regularly by French writers, bureaucrats, and other public figures throughout the next half-century. The abandonment of customs that distinguished the Jews-kashrut, Sabbath observance, etc.-was also demanded by those who aspired to fusion sociale. Surrounding this expression ensued a debate within the Jewish community on the one hand, and between Jews and non-Jews on the other, on the essential character of emancipation."'3 The most acute trauma of emancipation was not experienced in the immediate aftermath of the Revolution and the bestowal of civic rights, but was delayed several decades when regular contact with French society became possible. This contact was manifested in increased attendance at French secondary schools and universities only after the demise of Napoleon. Many of the younger generation measured solutions to the Jewish question not by expressions of loyalty to the state or by the ability to perform civic duties, but by the extent and scope of social integration. They demanded thoroughgoing religious reform in order to facilitate fusion sociale. Olry Terquem, writing under the pseudonym Tsarphati (Hebrew for "Frenchman"), and Leon Halevi, for example, believed that the elimination of the "rittuel asiatique" in Judaism would lessen the distance between Jew and non-Jew. Others renounced 103. On the notion of French society as a family, see Marc Shell, The End of Kinship (Stanford, 1988). The expression la grande famille franiaise appeared innumerable times in Jewish sources. See, for instance, Samuel Cahen's remarks in Archives israelites de France 1 (1840): 658. For an example of the claim that the refusal of Jews to marry gentiles was an obstacle to social integration, see A. Tourette, Discours sur les Juifs d'Alsace (Strasbourg, 1825), p. 37. On the debate over "fusion," Rabbi Abraham Cologna, for one, protested against the use of the term in the following remarks: "Let no one speak to us any more of 'fusion,' away with these vague expressions, let us call things by their names: it is only a matter of civil and political association, which has nothing and which can have nothing in common with belief in the messiah who has come or who is to come," in his Rdflexions adressdes a M. Silvestre de Sacy (Paris, 1817), pp. 9, 17, cited in Posener, "Immediate Effects," pp. 325-326.

From the examples of apostasy in this period we learn that the final decision to convert came in the aftermath of bitter disappointment and out of great skepticism concerning the ability of the Jews to achieve fusion sociale as long as they remained Jewish. This was the conclusion at which Theodore Ratisbonne arrived; it was based on the view that there was a fundamental incompatibility between Judaism and French citizenship, and was reinforced by the realization that French society was not religiously neutral, but Christian. Until the moment of their conversion, however, those Jews who converted to Christianity remained active in the Jewish community. In fact, it appears that for most, the decision to convert was hardly inconsistent with their commitment to regeneration, as Ratisbonne himself affirmed: "it is my Christian faith that brought me to renounce the pleasures of life in order to consecrate myself to the rig~inration of my brothers."'0 For the vast majority of French Jews, the aforementioned views were far too radical and were well beyond the pale of the Jewish community. Most Jewish leaders, including those whose religious orientation was decidedly liberal, recognized the ever-present dangers posed by the open society of the July Monarchy. Unable to ignore the social demands of the revolutionary legacy, yet unwilling to sacrifice Jewish tradition on the altar of fraternit&amp;, they sought expressions of Jewish identity that remained faithful to the competing claims made by revolution and tradition. Our consideration of this phenomenon now brings us to an examination of the second stage in the emergence of modern Jewish studies, when scholars pursued their academic objectives in two parallel and distinct frameworks, thus reflecting the complex dynamics of emancipation in France. The political climate of 104. Ratisbonne served as secretary of the Societ6 d'encouragement au travail en faveur des isra61ites du Bas-Rhin. In a mineinoire he composed in 1824, Ratisbonne had advanced recommendations for reform that aimed at realizing the vision of fusion sociale. For excerpts of the nzemoire, see Journal de la Socidr~ des Sciences, Agriculture, et Arts, dui Bas-Rhin 3 (1826): 376-377. Until his conversion in 1827, Ratisbonne was active in the work of the Soci6te d'encouragement. According to Ratisbonne and fellow converts Isidore Goschler and Jules Lewel, their involvement in Jewish communal affairs was undertaken at the insistence of their mentor, Louis Bautain, as a preparatory step before undergoing baptism. On this involvement, and on the use of the term redge'nderation, see Philosophie diu Christianisme: correspondance religieuse de Louis Bautain, 2 vols.

BERKOVITZ the July Monarchy enabled Jewish scholars to resume their prior associations with general scholars and to develop new areas of common interest. Salomon Munk's research in Islamic and Jewish philosophy, together with his assiduous work with oriental manuscripts, epitomizes the pursuit of scholarly activity in both Jewish and general French contexts. Munk edited the Dictionnaire de la Conversation, the Encyclopidie des gens du monde, and the Encyclopidie nouvelle, and thereby established contact with members of the Acad6mie frangaise and the Institut de la France. Between 1834 and 1838 he published nearly a score of articles in Temps on biblical, Persian, and Sanskrit literature, several studies in the Journal asiatique, and biographical studies of several thirteenth-century French rabbis in the Histoire litteraire de la France, while assisting numerous scholars in their research."15 Other Jewish scholars shared Munk's dedication. Gerson-L6vy, champion of Jewish educational and moderate religious reform, was centrally involved in the general intellectual life of his native Metz, first as editor of L'Independant, and then as a founding member of the Acad6mie de Metz. Similarly, Samuel Cahen, Jewish educator, director of the Bible translation project, and editor of the Archives Israelites, collaborated in the Encyclopidie des gens du monde. The careers of these figures reveal the dual commitment that was both desirable and possible in postrevolutionary France.1' Their work was rooted in the conviction that the study of Jewish civilization ought to be undertaken within the context of world cultures, nurtured by and integrated within the general scholarly traditions of European society, and not restricted to the Jewish community. Their universalism was clearly reinforced by the growing success of Jewish integration in French society.107 105. The numerous examples of Munk's collaboration with French scholars include the assistance he provided to Eugene Bore in publishing "Une seance du Tahkemoni,"Journal asiatique (January, 1837): 21-43; a cooperative project on the Druse with Sylvestre de Sacy, published in Tenips, March 2, 1838; the help he gave astronomer J.-B. Biot for the latter's work on Abulafia in 1843; and the general assistance he gave to Ernst Renan, who preceded him as professor of Hebrew and Syriac literature at the College de France.

In 1831 the first volume of a French translation of the Hebrew Bible appeared under the direction of Samuel Cahen.o10 This project, inspired by the example of Moses Mendelssohn's Biut; was an attempt to approach the biblical text and ancient Semitic culture using the methods and tools of philology, anthropology, and archaeology. Completed over the course of two decades, volumes of the new translation included many important studies, such as the first installment of Munk's French translation of the Guide of the Perplexed, which were intended to provide scientific background to the biblical texts. Although the methodological similarity to Wissenschaft was pronounced, the differences between the French and German schools were more profound. French-Jewish scholars hardly dealt with rabbinic literature, while in Germany this was the area of principal concern. Before mid-century the school of biblical criticism in Germany was dominated by Protestant scholars whose research was influenced by prejudice and even hostility toward the Jewish religion. German-Jewish scholars were therefore apprehensive about engaging in biblical studies for fear that their work might be discredited through its association with harsh critics of Judaism. Furthermore, it is clear that research on the Bible would not prove as valuable as critical studies of postbiblical and rabbinic materials, as the latter would lay the groundwork for religious reform.0' In France, the possibility of dialogue and cooperation between reformers and rabbis precluded unrestrained assaults on the Talmud, although the former certainly agreed with their German colleagues on the evolution of Jewish law. In accordance with general trends in France, French-Jewish scholars preferred to direct their energies to biblical, philological, and philosophical research. Moreover, French-Jewish scholars were not subject to the same political constraints concerning the critical study of the Bible. Insofar as they were well beyond the sphere of the controversy, they were able to address issues on which the Wissenschaft scholars had remained silent, including the hypothesis concerning human authorship of the Bible.11 108.

BERKOVITZ In light of the more open atmosphere that prevailed in the 1830s, it may be asked why Jewish scholars-the same Jewish scholars who had penetrated French academic circles-decided to devote themselves to this more narrowly conceived project. The answer may be related, in part, to the timing of its conception. The initial decision to undertake this translation was made in 1829, during the period when Jewish scholars were still excluded from academic circles. It is not unlikely that as a result of the assault on the legacy of the Revolution and the accompanying experience of social exclusion, Jewish intellectuals were driven more tightly together, and that the project permitted an opportunity to form their own learned society. In light of the strong Christian orientation prevailing in French biblical scholarship, Cahen's initiative may very well have constituted an attempt to wrest the Bible from Christian dominance and place it squarely within the province of Jewish studies. This decision was undoubtedly reinforced by the realization that even French liberals such as Vinet, Constant, de Broglie, and Guizot continued to identify French civilization with Christianity, despite their declared commitment to the separation of church and state. Thus, the Bible project gave expression to the particularistic interpretation of emancipation. In the view of Jewish scholars, both aims, the universal as well as the particular, were essential and appropriate to the conditions of Jewish life in postrevolutionary France."' Conclusion Contrary to the expectations of most proponents of emancipation, the Revolution inaugurated an era when the modernization of the Jews was, paradoxically, greatly frustrated. The formal removal of legal disabilities did not translate directly into the long-awaited transformation, first, because improvements in legal status were not implemented evenly or expeditiously, and second, because the idea of including Jews within general society failed to strike roots among most members of the local population, and in fact met with considerable hostility. The attitude of leaders-both Jewish and gentile-may also have hindered the advance of Jewish regeneration. No Jewish institutions devoted specifically to the task of promoting modernization 111. See Frederick Artz, France under the Bourbon Restoration, 1814-1830 (New York, 1963), pp. 158-163, 170-176.</page><page sequence="55">THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE JEWS 79 were created during the first quarter-century of emancipation, in part because of the widely held assumption that there no longer was a need for them once civic equality had been granted. It may be argued, also, that the predominantly rural character of Jewish life in the prerevolutionary era, accompanied by steadfast religious traditionalism, served to discourage Jews from breaking with established patterns of behavior, even after community controls were formally dissolved. In sum, it is clear that with the exception of Parisian Jewry, modernization lagged far behind the pace of change in other Western countries, and that this delay, resulting from the cumulative impact of the Revolution, the Reign of Terror, and the Napoleonic regime, had far-reaching consequences for much of the nineteenth century. For the majority of France's Jews, the encounter with the trauma of emancipation occurred several decades after the bestowal of civic equality-a fact whose significance was evident to at least some Jewish proponents of regen2ration. Samuel Cahen, for one, explained that the Revolution caught French Jewry unprepared for the challenges it was about to face: "It is recognized that liberty came as a surprise to our fathers, who were not at all prepared.... The epoch was hardly favorable for indispensable meliorations, for emancipation interieure.... One was a Frenchman of the Revolution and a Jew of the Middle Ages.""2 In the view of Cahen and others, the timing of emancipation relative to the state of socioeconomic and cultural modernization was a critical factor; ironically, in the case of the Jews of Alsace-Lorraine, particularly those in rural districts, the early bestowal of citizenship may have impeded the progress of cultural and religious regeneration."3 While the origins of these failings were, as we have observed, certainly more complex than Cahen's explanation, the important issue of timing has nonetheless been largely ignored, particularly with respect to its impact on the leadership of French Jewry. Owing to the emigration of numerous rabbis and maskilim to Germany and French-occupied Mayence during 112. Archives Israelites de France 4 (1843): 3-4. Cahen's son Isidore, who succeeded him as editor of the Archives israelites, commented on French Jewry's ill-preparedness with the following observation: "Nos coreligionnaires, appeles par la Revolution au benefice de la libert6 civile et politique, n'avaient encore ni les moeurs ni meme la conscience de leur nouvelle situation; il ne connaissaient guere que le trafic pour occupation, et leur foi 6tait entachait d'abus et des superstitions; les chaines 6taient tombees, mais les membres 6taient engourdis; de nouveaux horizons s'ouvraient pour les Israelites, mais leur oeil n'6tait pas fait encore a les contempler."

BERKOVITZ the latter Napoleonic years, no modernizing elite within the ranks of the Jewish community emerged until the 1820s and early 1830s. Furthermore, the disruptive effects of the postrevolutionary era commanded the attention and energies of leaders upon whom the work of creating urgently needed communal institutions was thrust. By the time reformers were prepared to take up the issues which German Jewry had addressed decades before, the prospects for reform were already quite limited. In addition to the fact that there was so very little support-either popular or rabbinic-for ritual reforms, the comprehensive, highly structured nature of the Jewish community imposed constraints on the dimensions of change, thus precluding the implementation of a radical religious reform program. The same was true of education. Modern schools and other institutions that might have become the training ground for more radical activity were established very late, after the rabbinate had emerged as a power in community affairs and assumed control of Jewish education. Rabbinic involvement in Jewish schooling points to a larger development, a reconfiguration of community leadership in the nineteenth century. The reemergence of the rabbinate as a dynamic force in communal affairs alongside the lay elite was a conspicuous turnabout from the decline it experienced in the last decades before the Revolution. Admittedly, this judgment is at odds with the prevailing view, which holds that the stature of the rabbinate plummeted as consistory lay leaders endeavored to impose their authority even in strictly religious affairs. Low prestige, decreasing representation in the consistory executive bodies, the pervasive view of the rabbis as opponents of reginderation, and mounting secularization are typically adduced as prime elements in the argument. While these factors are largely incontestable, some qualification is required. With the establishment of the consistorial system, the rabbinate acquired an official status which surpassed that of the earlier period. Rabbis were now formally included in the decision-making process. Although rabbinic authority was no longer protected by community controls, rabbis remained the principal leaders in the communities of Alsace-Lorraine, where Jewish life continued to be organized around the synagogue. They provided essential leadership in the establishment and direction of modern schools, in the central rabbinical facility, in publishing, and in the organization of vocational societies and training. Frequently they, not the lay consistory leaders, were called upon to represent the community at public events. Finally, it should be pointed out that the stature of the rabbis in Alsace-Lorraine was</page><page sequence="57">THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE JEWS 81 much greater than in Paris. For a variety of reasons, the rank and file as well as consistorial lay leaders in the northeastern provinces were more respectful of rabbinic authority. So long as Alsace-Lorraine remained the dominant population center for French Jewry, the argument concerning the decline of the French rabbinate must be restricted to Paris."4 Vying with the rabbinate for leadership of the Jewish community were intellectuals whose views on rig~nunration were grounded in the ideals of the Berlin Haskalah. Several had established close connections with German-Jewish scholars during their sojourn in Germany, and upon their return to France combined community activism with scholarly pursuits. The delay in modernization explains the general readiness to regard the Haskalah, even in the 1820s, 1830s, and 1840s, as suitable to the needs of French Jewry. In the absence of a movement of religious reform, the ideology of Haskalah came to be viewed by both scholars and rabbis as an appropriate model of socioeconomic and cultural adaptation. As a result, French Jewry was protected from the bitter quarrels that began to surface in Germany in the 1780s and that divided German-Jewish society throughout the next century. By the time the issues were discussed in France, they were less explosive and less threatening. Thus, the exceedingly modest impact of the Revolution in the earliest stages of emancipation paradoxically accounts for much more significant effects that were not to be felt until some decades later, and visible primarily in their moderating influence on French Jewry's program of regeneration and on the pace of its cultural transformation."5 Although patterns of Jewish culture and social norms changed slowly, surviving the Revolution and the rampant political upheavals with great tenacity, the self-image of French Jews underwent considerable transmutation. The legacy of 1789, as distinct from its tangible impact, left a profound imprint on the collective consciousness of French Jewry, though it certainly was not unaffected by the languidness of the modernization process. That legacy provided the theoretical underpinnings for the perception of French society as a single, unified family, and although this unity was never fully 114.

BERKOVITZ achieved, its mythic power captured the imagination of Jewish leaders. Their hope of taking part in this undertaking was expressed by an allegiance to France that was to become the most central element-and ultimately the most irrepressible-in their new identity. Far more than simply a declaration of loyalty to the ruler and the state, devotion to the patrie was expressed by a growing identification with French society and culture, especially with the image of the Revolution that Jews inherited and transformed over the course of the century. As the ideals of 1789 were institutionalized and thereby gained greater permanency, the myth of the Revolution grew stronger and would, at least until mid-century, constitute a critical element in French Jewry's ideology of emancipation. Faith in the ideals of the Revolution, and the conviction that France's overall commitment to those ideals accounted for its embrace of the Jews, were powerful forces enabling community leaders to play down periodic incidents of anti-Jewish hostility and to remain committed to the belief that the Revolution had laid the foundation for new relations between Jews and gentiles."6 This perception was anchored in the view that the Revolution had opened a new era of promise with its bestowal of civic equality, and was sustained by a firm faith in the reign of law. Typically, the Revolution was portrayed as having altered the destiny of French Jews by putting an end to persecution, discrimination, and intolerance."' Quite remarkably, however, the numerous setbacks suffered during the Reign of Terror, later throughout the nineties, and under Napoleon are largely absent from the nineteenth-century Jewish collective memory. For Jews, as for most other Frenchmen, the inflated image of the Revolution went hand in hand with 116. I do not take issue with the claim made by Michael Marrus, in The Politics of Assimilation, that assimilationism blinded French Jewry to the dangers of antisemitism. However, it does appear that for those Jews who did not subscribe to assimilationism, a different mechanism had to have been employed in order to reconcile the occasional outbursts of anti-Jewish hostility with their abiding faith in the new order. When anti-Jewish riots erupted in Alsace in 1848, the Archives israelites explained that "I'Alsace ... est, quant a la tolerance religieuse, une contr6e a part," and that the hostilities should therefore not be regarded as a failure of the revolutionary legacy because Alsace was distinct from France proper. See Archives Israelites de France 9 (1848): 467 and 5 (1844): 868-869. In a more realistic sense, Reinhard Rttrup has seen the riots as an indication of the limitations of the Revolution in transforming the popular image of the Jews. See RUrup, "European Revolutions of 1848," p. 33. 117. See, for example, the views of Simon Bloch and Rabbi Samuel Dreyfus, in La Rdgenunration 1 (1836): 180, 340-341, cited in Hyman, "L'Impact de la Revolution," pp. 30-31, and of Rabbi L.-M.

Both as a framework for collective actions and consciousness, and as a symbol of unity, the state, particularly through its educational system, played a pivotal role in the shaping of a collective identity for its citizens."8 In the case of the Jews, the aggregate effect of these forces was the fashioning of an identity that was primarily autochthonous. The progressive break with a long-standing tradition linking the Jews of Alsace-Lorraine culturally, socially, and economically with territories to the east had already been set in motion by the Revolution, and explains the tendency of French Jews to respond to challenges that were endemic to France, if not entirely unique. Their responses in the realm of religious ideology, intellectual pursuits, attitudes toward general culture, and their conception of Jewish responsibility, set them apart from Jewish communities abroad. Pride in the political successes of France further enhanced their Jewish cultural distinctiveness, at least in the eyes of Franco-Jewish leaders who would often measure the progress of their coreligionists against the condition of Jews elsewhere. Widespread experience either as nmiigrds or, in the case of Salomon Munk, as newcomers to France facilitated this comparison. Contrasting the ease with which he found work in France to the difficulties he encountered in Germany, Munk reported to his brother-in-law that "in France, religion does not make the least difference"; to his mother Munk repeated his delight that religion played a minimal role outside of the church and synagogue."' Perhaps overzealous in their praise, Munk's remarks typify a tendency among the leaders of French Jewry to exaggerate the positive while understating the negative. 118. This last formulation is based on Eric Hobsbawm, "Mass-Producing Traditions, 1870-1914," in The Invention of Tradition, ed. Eric Hobsbawm and Terrence Ranger (Cam- bridge, 1983), p. 264. 119. Schwab, Salomon Munk, pp. 37, 56-58. The quotation from Munk was that "en France, la religion ne constitue pas le moindre difference." This statement should certainly not be construed as suggesting a lack of sensitivity to the tensions posed by religious elements within French society. Munk and others were critical of the Catholic resurgence and were concerned about the dangers of religious extremism. But this concern did not overshadow their optimism about the future, nor their conviction that conditions in France were still superior to those in Germany.

BERKOVITZ The fundamental relationship between civic equality and patriotic devo- tion had important cultural implications as well. More than simply a display of gratitude for the opportunities extended to the Jewish population, allegiance to the patrie was an expression of cultural affinity and aspiration. In the view of Jewish intellectuals, the fact that German Jewry was still denied the full rights of citizenship was an insurmountable obstacle to the creation of a genuine bond to the national culture. Culture and politics were, in the estimation of French Jews, inseparable.120 Echoing the assertions of Guizot and others, French Jews were united in their belief that France was the most spiritual and the most advanced of all civilizations.12' This conviction, rooted in the mythology of the Revolution, enabled Jewish leaders of diverse orientations to embrace French society and culture without fear of publicly betraying their own Jewish values. To the contrary, there was broad consensus that the symbiosis of Judaism and French civilization was a sacred mission entrusted to the first Jewish population to have been molded by the ideals of 1789. French Jewry saw itself as a symbol of the liberal principles of the Revolution, both with respect to Jewish communities abroad and to general French society. The coherence of this orientation was sustained by the continued use of the term rigendration throughout most of the nineteenth century, providing a semantic as well as thematic link to the Revolution. By mid-century the development of an attitude of superiority toward Jews in other countries'22 was reflected in a rather striking reinterpretation of rigegnration. Formerly conceived of as a process through which the Jews of France would be transformed into upstanding and productive citizens, rigeneratiotn was now viewed as a program that French Jews would actively administer themselves. The reinterpretation of rigenerationz reflected the changes in the way that French Jews viewed their role in the process of emancipation. In the minds 120. See ibid. 5 (1844): 864, where Samuel Cahen, in response to Ludwig Philippsohn, asserted that "celui qui n'a pas de droit dans un pays, ne peut sincerement soutenir que ce pays est sa patrie." 121. For excellent examples of the reverence felt for French civilization and culture, see the remarks of Metz grand rabbin Lion-Mayer Lambert, Priecis de l'histoire des hIbreux, pp. 406-407, and Archives israelites de France 2 (1841): 596.

Attention was directed to Algeria, the Near East, and the Ottoman Empire, in the hope of bringing the blessings of the Revolution to their less fortunate coreligionists."24 French Jews felt obliged to set an example for their coreligionists abroad, generally through their fulfillment of civic duties, and specifically through their own successful regne'ration." In short, regeineration had become an international imperative. As for the attitude toward French society, one may detect a remarkable turn in Jewish thinking. Over the course of a half-century, the former objects 123. The term rigineIration was used in virtually all sectors of the community, including Orthodox circles. Rabbis Samuel Dreyfus and S. Lhvy, both Alsatian, employed the term to mean something akin to a revival. Dreyfus saw re'g~nration religieuse as one of two objectives, the other being political emancipation, that were mandated by the Revolution. Levy used the expression rigte'nration in describing R. Salomon Klein's combined yeshiva and icole de travail. See Univers israelite 9 (1853): 211-213, 231. By mid-century the term had become part of the mainstream vocabulary. Central Consistory Grand Rabbi Isidor, like his predecessor R. Salomon Ulmann, referred in his 1867 inaugural discourse to l'oeuvre de idgcinration that had been pursued together during the preceding twenty years. See Archives israe'lites de France 28 (1867): 308. 124. Involvement in the regeneration of Algerian Jewry was hardly surprising, insofar as Algeria was a French colony. The general concern for other communities in the Ottoman Empire, Near East, and North Africa, though spearheaded by Baron James de Rothschild and his almoner, Albert Cohn, was fully consistent with the sense of responsibility which French Jewry understood to be central to its ideology of emancipation. In articulating the goals of the Alliance Israelite Universelle at the organization's sixth annual general assembly, Adolphe Cremieux described r'gene'ration as follows: "La rdgendration des Juifs, nous n'avons pas a nous occuper autour de nous: c'est au loin que nous portons nos regards, c'est dans l'Orient que nous intervenons, au milieu de populations si loin de notre civilisation actuelle, oh les Juifs vivent encore sous le poids de prejuges les plus accablants," published in Archives israelites de France 28 (1867): 14.

According to Samuel Cahen, "notre liberti, nos droits publics, et la tolerance religieuse dont nous sommes l'objet, ne nous appartient pas a nous seuls; ils sont aussi le patrimoine de nos frbres repandus sur la surface des deux hemispheres. Car la France est le phare qui 6claire le monde." And in more universal terms, "la regeneration de toute l'Europe" dated from the era of liberty.

BERKOVITZ of regenerative efforts came to view themselves as now bearing immense responsibility for the reformation of society at large. For example, after discussing certain liturgical modifications that might be introduced in the synagogue on national festivals such as the First of May, Samuel Cahen issued the following warning to his Jewish readers: "We must [however] not merely imitate other religions by conducting an official service, but as their elders, we should serve as a model for the intervention of religion in the duties of citizenship." Simon Bloch went a step further. He insisted that Judaism must assume the duty of "penetrating more and more into the social fabric and to infuse its blood and soul into the veins of this generous land, through which Providence apparently wishes to redeem and to regenerate society."'26 In this spirit a distinctly Franco-Jewish definition of the notion of "mission" was formulated, at once seeking to be free of emancipation apologetics and aspiring to considerably more than the appropriation of general culture. What was once an internal Jewish transformation had become, through the convergence of the goals of the Jewish and French civilizations, a critical force in the regeneration of humanity. This new direction was rooted in an interpretive tradition that sought to identify the ideals of Judaism with those of the French Revolution. A generation before, Joseph Salvador had argued that the Sinaitic revelation ought to serve as an example to modern France, claiming that Mosaic institutions were permeated with the principles of the Revolution. The Jewish people, for its part, was destined to serve humanity as a model of justice, equity, and reason. By the end of the century others, such as James Darmsteter, would energetically echo this theme, making the case for the centrality of Jewish ideals to modern France.'27 Strained as these efforts may have been, they confirm the powerful impact of the legacy of the Revolution, particularly the urgency which Jewish leaders felt in articulating a distinctive mission for their coreligionists in postrevolutionary France. 126. For the Cahen quotation, see Archives isradlites de France 1 (1840): 642. The First of May, originally a popular fertility festival, was transformed in the 1830s into a national holiday dedicated to the honoring of King Louis Philippe. This was not an uncommon phenomenon, as many popular festivals went through a similar political transformation; see Weber, Peasants into Frenchmen, pp. 377-398. The Bloch quotation appeared in Univers israelites 17 (1861): 6. 127. See Joseph Salvador, Histoire des institutions de Mo'se et de peuple hedbreu, 3 vols. (Paris, 1828), and Graetz, From Periphery to Center; pp. 154-185. Also see Marrus, Politics of Assimilation, pp. 106-107.</page></plain_text>
