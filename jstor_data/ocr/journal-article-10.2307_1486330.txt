<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ze'ev W. Falk. Law and Religion: The Jewish Experience. Jerusalem: Mesharim Publishers, 1981. 238 pp. This is an erudite, passionate statement of the role of values in shaping the content and methods of Jewish law. It is also a fascinating and illuminat- ing exploration of many of the values of Judaism and a comparison of the legal expression of those values to that of Anglo-American law. It is also a well-reasoned, sharp critique of a positivistic, largely Orthodox approach to Jewish law. For all of these reasons, it is well worth reading. What it is not is a sustained consideration of the topic indicated in the title and the first chapter-i.e., the nature of the suffusion of law and religion in the Jewish experience. In fact, the major weakness of the book is that it jumps from topic to topic, offering tantalizing views into each one of them, but ultimately not satisfying the reader's desire to stay with a subject</page><page sequence="2">296 BOOK REVIEWS for a while to explore its depths. The proliferation of topics would be tolera- ble-especially given Professor Falk's sensitive handling of so many of them-if the reader had a clue as to why the author is going from Subject A to Subject B and what he wants to accomplish in the end. In other words, the weakness of this book is that it does not sufficiently reveal its organiza- tion and purpose. That is a shame, for I fear that many readers will be dis- couraged from following Falk to the end by the lack of an evident game-plan. The trek through Professor Falk's work is well worth the effort to overcome that obstacle, though. He argues cogently, and from several dif- ferent perspectives, for recognizing the values inherent in both the content and the methods of Jewish law. In his view, "Jewish law is not an end in itself but a means of moral fulfilment and of spiritual elevation" (p. 82). The attack against legalism should not be left to critics from the outside (mainly Christians), but should rather be discussed and corrected within the Jewish community, even if it means sharply criticizing a man as respected as Rabbi J. B. Soloveitchik (pp. 156 ff.). "If Jewish law is to continue its role, .. . the study of values must become part of the study of Torah, and an avenue must be opened towards creative interpretation. Judaism should be taken as a constant encounter between positive norms and human values. Any decision should reflect both and do justice to the situation" (p. 235). That position causes him to attack Orthodoxy in a number of places for its misunder- standing of the nature of Jewish law and even for its mistaken interpreta- tions of specific passages in rabbinic literature (e.g., its attempt to emascu- late the notion of hiddushey Torah so as not to allow what the term clearly means, i.e., novelties of teaching-p. 175). On the other hand, he also argues against those who would try to identify and preserve Jewish values without the framework of Jewish law. Jewish law must remain the vehicle for Jewish values, but to do that it must be interpreted and applied by people who are sensitive to its valuational base. This view of Jewish law requires that one see the law in a broad context, and probably the greatest strength of this book is that Professor Falk does just that. He understands the full impact of the fact that most Jews do not now observe Jewish law-to the point that he asks "whether the lack of efficacy of many rules of Jewish law does not affect their validity. Even if divine law does not derive its legitimacy from the recognition or obedience on the part of human beings, it cannot disregard social reality" (pp. 137-138). That social reality is not only the relationship of the Jews to Jewish law; it is also the relationship between it and the non-Jewish community. Falk argues persuasively that we must and can be more open to</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 297 some of the people and values of the modern world than Jews have been during many periods of the past, both because we have some things to learn from non-Jews which will aid us in applying Jewish law intelligently in the mdoern world and because the existence of the State of Israel can help assure the maintenance of our own separate identity in the process (pp. 84 ff., 101 ff.). Aside from the social context of Jewish law, he is sensitive to its historical context and development. Moreover, he recognizes the effects of language on the law and the function of faith in Jewish law as well as Jewish religion. He also makes illuminating and accurate comparisons between Jewish and Anglo-American law, always resisting the temptation to carry the comparison too far. The fact that Professor Falk reminds us of all of these contexts in which Jewish law operates is itself an invaluable contribu- tion to our understanding of it. Professor Falk's breadth of vision is matched by its depth. The bulk of this book is devoted to an exploration of specific values articulated in Jewish law-democracy, liberty, equality, human rights, disobedience, generaliza- tion and individualization, and authority. In each case, the author not only delineates the extent to which Judaism holds this value or fails to; he also probes the philosophical assumptions behind the values as they are articu- lated in both Jewish and non-Jewish literature. One comes away with a sense that the identity and specific expression of the values in question are not the capricious result of history, but rather flow from the fundamental assumptions which differing societies make about humanity, nature, and God. In that way Professor Falk helps us to do what he exhorts everyone to do in the opening pages of this book-i.e., develop a philosophy through which to see law and life in general. I only wish that he would have spelled out the principles and implications of his own philosophy of law more systematically so that we could be helped yet further. Elliot N.
