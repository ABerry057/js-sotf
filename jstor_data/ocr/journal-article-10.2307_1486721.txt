<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tony Kushner, The Holocaust and the Liberal Imagination: A Social and Cultural History. Cambridge, Mass.: Blackwell Publishers. 1994. xiii, 366 pp. This is a well-researched book which, however, advances an untenable thesis. Tony Kushner explains the failure of Britain and the United States to help rescue the threatened Jews of Europe as due to the limitations of "the liberal imagination" and "liberal culture." He does not adequately explain these terms, but he uses them frequently and interchangeably, along with "liberalism," "liberal values," and "liberal universalism." "In Britain," he writes, "the limitations of the liberal imagination made it hard for most to accept the reality of irrational facts such as the planned extermination of the Jews" (p. 137). People were, indeed, slow to see that the Nazis were moving from persecution to extermination, but this was not due to "liberalism." The great majority of the Jewish victims, including the ultra-Orthodox, who were quite uninfluenced by "liberal culture," did not initially believe that the Nazis were planning their systematic extermination. Ghetto leaders, to use a tragic example, believed that the Jews would survive if they made themselves useful to the Nazi war effort. Extermination was so irrational and went so far beyond traditional antisemitism that it was difficult to comprehend, with or without the influence of "the liberal imagination." Kushner has written several books and many articles about recent Jewish history in Britain, and his current book is based on considerable research. It does a good job of telling how the news, first of persecution and then of extermination, came to Britain and to the United States, and of how the two governments, despite their expressions of sympathy, refused to moderate the restrictive immigration policies, which denied rescue to the victims. He does, however, cite one interesting exception. The British government, which accepted the advice of the British Medical Practitioners Union and the British Medical Association to bar entrance to Jewish doctors, allowed 20,000 young Jewish girls to enter as domestic servants. The servants union was,</page><page sequence="2">424 BOOK REVIEWS apparently, much weaker than those of the physicians. When Kushner sticks with such concrete matters, he is interesting and informative. Unfortunately, he constantly returns to his main target, "liberalism." "Liberal universalism," according to Kushner, forbade action to help a particular group: "With remarkable consistency and in partial contrast to the United States the British government held closely to these liberal values throughout the war" (p. 198). These "liberal values," according to Kushner, explain the Foreign Office's answer to a request by the chief rabbi in the summer of 1944 that Britain grant a protected status to the Jews of Hungary: "It is not the policy of HMG to regard Jews as belonging to a separate category. It is felt that discrimination of this kind savours too strongly of the Nazi attitude towards Jews" (p. 199). This is certainly an elegant excuse, but not what is commonly understood as "liberalism." When a particular group is singled out for persecution, it is not a violation of liberal principles to single that group out for special help. Kushner finds another upholder of"liberal official values" in the American Assistant Secretary of State, Breckinridge Long, the official in charge of issuing visas, or more accurately of denying them. Long, more than any other official, made sure that the gates of refuge in the United States remained shut. Kushner writes that Long "was not a pathological antisemite who hated all Jews.... In fact Long revealed classic liberal tendencies with regard to the Jews of Europe. . . . Long's liberalism was reflected in his commitment to individualism" (p. 160). True, Long believed that Russian and Polish Jews were "lawless, scheming, defiant, and in many ways unassimilable," but he also believed the same about the lower orders of Slavs and Western Asians. "Long's restrictionism," writes Kushner, "was thus not specifically aimed at one group" (p. 161). Such inclusiveness, in Kushner's view, makes Long (and possibly Archie Bunker) a liberal. Ernest Bevin, the British Foreign Secretary in the postwar Labour govern- ment, opposed Jewish immigration into Palestine and wanted only restricted Jewish immigration into Britain. He warned the Jews that they could rouse antisemitism by getting "too much at the head of the queue." Kushner writes that Bevin was "seen by many as a great enemy of the Jewish people. What has been little understood, however, is the tenacity with which Bevin clung to the liberal principles with regards to the Jews" (p. 233). Bevin, apparently, was acting in the spirit of an earlier Foreign Office document which stated that(the opinion of "His Majesty's Government [is] that Jews must be treated as nationals of existing states. To single out 'the Jew' as a separate category</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 425 [would] perpetuate the very Nazi doctrine we are determined to stamp out" (p. 127). David Wyman, in The Abandonment of the Jews, does not see the liberal influence which Kushner sees everywhere. Wyman describes the conservative victories in the 1942 congressional elections in America as a blow against any possible program for help to Jews: "With a more conservative Congress due in Washington in January 1943, prospects for congressional support to help the stricken Jews of Europe were bleak" (p. 58). Kushner dedicates his book in part to Eleanor Rathbone, a British member of Parliament who worked tirelessly, though on the whole unsuccessfully, for large-scale immigration of Jews. She "was to die shortly after the war, ill and exhausted by her activities" (p. 200). Kushner writes of her with admiration and gratitude. His descriptions of her work are moving and tragic. It may be that the terms "liberal" and "conservative" are of little use in this matter. A person can be "liberal" on some issues and "conservative" on others. But if the label "liberal" is used, it is better used to describe people like Rathbone. "Liberalism" can be used in many different ways, but it is usually associated with civil liberties, tolerance, and freedom. It can be simple-minded, but it is not usually hard-hearted. It mandates sympathy for the victim and directs that sympathy where the suffering is greatest. I believe that Eleanor Rathbone embodied "liberal values" during those terrible years. Breckinridge Long and most of the officials of the Foreign Office and the State Department did not. Once the Holocaust began, most of the Jews of Europe were trapped. Some could have been saved before the war; others, perhaps a few hundred thousand, mainly in Romania and Hungary, could have been saved later in the war. They were not saved, because the governments of Britain and the United States did not want to save them. They deplored their murder, but did not want them arriving on their shores. They set forth their justifications in pious and sometimes even liberal terminology, which Kushner accepts at face value. He argues that it is glib to cite antisemitism or bureaucratic indifference as the cause of this policy. But why did Britain and the United States lack the generosity to open their doors to people who were being denied not only civil liberties, tolerance, and freedom, but life itself? Was it."liberal culture and "the liberal imagination"? I think not. Melvin Shefftz Binghamton University Binghamton, N.Y.</page></plain_text>
