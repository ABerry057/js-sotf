<plain_text><page sequence="1">Menahem I. Kahana. The Geniza Fragments of the Halakhic Midrashim, Part One. Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 2005. xv, 360 pp. During the hundreds of years of its formation, rabbinic literature was trans- mitted orally, allowing access only to those who could meet face to face with the rabbis and their Tannaim, the "walking books" who had memorized their teach- ings. Those distant from centers of learning were limited, if not completely excluded, from participating in the ongoing development of the Jewish legal and aggadic tradition. The eventual writing of the Talmud allowed its dissemina- tion to the far-flung lands of the Diaspora, but even then, participation was basi- cally limited to those with access to manuscripts. Only the printing of the Talmud eventually altered this situation, in time allowing for the modem phenomenon of hundreds of thousands of Jews who daily study the Babylonian Talmud. The academic study of rabbinic literature lingers far behind in granting access to its treasures, namely the manuscripts and geniza fragments of the various rabbinic compositions. Over 150 years after Wissenschaft des Judentums began, there are still no critical editions of most of the Mishnah, a significant portion of the Tosefta, the Sifra, the Yerushalmi, and nearly the entire Bavli. Exist- ing critical editions are often outdated, most having been published scores of years ago. Some manuscripts and fragments have been published, and some may be 442</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews found on the Intemet, but the publication of truly critical editions of rabbinic texts still seems to lie in the distance.' The publication of all of the geniza (and other) fragments of the halakhic midrashim is a welcome, if partial, remedy to this deep- rooted problem. At the same time, it forces us to recognize just how problematic the situation truly is. In an odd twist of history, the halakhic midrashim are now the segment of rabbinic literature that exists in the best state of academic publication. There are critical editions (some better and some worse) of all of the halakhic mid- rashim, with the exception of most of the Sifra, and now these same lucky midra- shim merit the publication of all existing Cairo geniza fragments. Although there are many reasons for this odd situation, one is certainly the extraordinary individ- uals who, over the past century, have devoted their lives to this branch of rabbinic literature, the most recent of whom is Menahem Kahana. The Geniza Fragments of the Halakhic Midrashim is not a critical edition of any one midrashic composition but rather a transcription of all of the fragments (from both the Cairo Geniza and elsewhere) of pieces of the halakhic midrashim. In this volume, there are 391 fragments, most previously unpublished, from six midrashim: Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael, Mekhilta de Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai, Sifre Numbers, Sifre Zuta on Numbers, Sifre Deuteronomy and Mekhilta Deuteronomy (Midrash Tannaim). Because of their volume, Kahana is scheduled to publish a separate volume with the Sifra fragments. Each fragment is tran- scribed word for word, line by line, exactly as it appears without any correction or emendation. Fragments that originally belonged to one manuscript are joined together. Each fragment is referenced to the existing critical edition of the midrashim. Descriptions of the fragments can be found in Kahana's companion catalogue, Manuscripts of the Halakhic Midrashim, An Annotated Catalogue (Jerusalem: Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, 1995). There is no discussion of the texts published. Rather, this volume is "merely" a transcription of 391 pages of fragments from six of the halakhic midrashim. Credit for this impressive project goes both to Dov Friedberg and the Friedberg project and to Menahem Kahana. In the late 1990s, Friedberg initiated the Genizah Publication Project with the aid of Professors Neil Danzig, Yaakov Elman, and Lawrence Schiffman. The project's aim is to order, identify, catalogue, record, and publish (both electronically and in print) the hundreds of thousands of Cairo Geniza fragments. Menahem Kahana was appointed head of the halakhic midrashim staff and is the first to publish rabbinic texts under the auspices of the Friedberg project. The importance of the Cairo Geniza fragments of the halakhic midrashim is that they provide glimpses into a relatively unknown stemma of this literature, the Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael in particular. This is an Eastern version that frequently differs from the Western version, a version that is generally more well known 1. Besides the book under review, the only other "full" publication of the Cairo Geniza fragments for any one rabbinic composition is Michael Sokoloff's publication of the fragments of Genesis Rabbah. David Golinkin published the fragments for Bavli Rosh Hashanah, but this is only one tractate. 443</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews because of its preservation in the complete manuscripts and printed editions. At times, the fragments prove that existing difficult readings are correct despite their difficulties, and at other times, they provide evidence for readings that differ from those in the full manuscripts. They contribute to our understanding of the redactional history of the midrashim, their language and terminology, and the wording of the biblical texts on which they comment. Second, the Cairo Geniza fragments are often the only or at least the main source for midrashic compositions that otherwise have been lost. Most importantly, this publication grants easy access to the texts themselves. Catalogue numbers for geniza fragments are useful, as the interested researcher could visit the individual libraries in which each fragment is preserved, order photographs of the fragments, or visit the Institute of Microfilmed Hebrew Manu- scripts in Jerusalem. But published transcriptions are to catalogue numbers what the printing of the Talmud was to the manuscripts and oral traditions-they open up the information contained in these texts to a far wider audience. This publication should force us to ask a difficult and sensitive question: Why are there so few critical editions of rabbinic texts being produced in the academic world? Why is it that every year, numerous articles and books about rabbinic culture, thought, and history are published when accurate, scientific com- mentaries and publications of texts and manuscripts are still scarce? Indeed, there are a few institutes and individuals working on the publication of manuscripts and fragments of rabbinic literature. One is the Lieberman Institute, which recently released a CD-ROM, complete with search functions, containing the full manu- scripts of the Babylonian Talmud, and plans to continue updating this project. This publication makes manuscripts accessible and, most importantly, searchable for the researcher, no matter where he or she is, instead of hidden in the dark recesses of the world's libraries. Bar-Ilan University has a Web site with transcrip- tions of the Tosefta. Hebrew University has a Web site with facsimiles of a limited number of Bavli and Mishnah manuscripts, and the Academy for Hebrew Languages has published in electronic form one representative manuscript of each rabbinic composition. Nevertheless, much of the information is still not accessible. Thirty years ago, at the Seventh World Congress of Jewish Studies, it was announced that the work of Mif'al hamishnah was complete and that all Cairo Geniza fragments of the Mishnah, Tosefta, Yerushalmi, Bavli, and Alfasi had been incorporated into one catalogue. Recently, at the 2005 World Congress of Jewish Studies, it was again announced that this catalogue is forthcoming. Scholars who have had access to the findings of this catalogue simply have not made its information easily accessible to a wider audience, and sometimes they seem to withhold information intentionally. It seems that the study of rabbinic lit- erature is, as it was in Sura and Pumbedita of yore, again limited to students whom certain "geonim" deem worthy of entering their sacred halls. Thankfully, Professor Kahana has opened some doors, harking back to the great day in rabbinic legend when "they removed the guard and gave the students permission to enter" (Berakhot 28a). Finally, I should mention another problem that those involved in the aca- demic study of rabbinic literature in a university setting must address: Can the 444</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews system of promotion in universities-a system that typically promotes and pays its researchers based on their number of publications-foster work that demands many intensive years of research to produce an edition of a single work? And if the answer is no, where do we go from here? To put the matter bluntly, in fifty or a hundred years, when most articles have been forgotten, books have become outdated and gone out of publication, when academic discourse has already taken different and unforeseeable turns, what will be left of this generation's work?
