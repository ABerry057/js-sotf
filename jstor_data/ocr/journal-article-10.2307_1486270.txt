<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHANGING VIEWS OF PASSOVER AND THE MEANING OF REDEMPTION ACCORDING TO THE PALESTINIAN TALMUD by BARUCH M. BOKSER Gershom Scholem points out that within Judaism the concept of redemption does not merely consist of an abstract feeling but entails a belief in a concrete physical redemption, publicly visible in this world and taking place on the stage of history and within the community. However, it projects the realization of this hope to the future, therefore making Jewish life provi- sional, incomplete, and unfulfilled-a "life lived in deferment."' The history of the Passover seder illustrates how both aspects of this outlook became expressed in a specific time and place. But it also indicates that the hope was not always projected into the future, for we find people who both believed in a physical redemption and at the same time tried to internalize redemption in their own lives. The Passover rite provides a fitting place to analyze these views because throughout the history of Judaism, the holiday of Passover has revolved 1.

BOKSER around the idea of redemption, and already in the Bible the Exodus experi- ence held out to people the hope for a better life.2 By comparing different versions of the rite, we are therefore able to examine changes in the ways Jews saw themselves, their world, and their future. Here we contrast the attitudes to redemption in the first rabbinic seder, M. Pesabhim 10, and one of its first adaptations, in the Palestinian Talmud. The Mishnaic heritage provided later generations with a point of departure in their thinking regarding Passover. As I have demonstrated else- where, the Mishnah restructures the celebration to make it viable without the sacrificial cult, so that, for example, the eating of unleavened bread and bitter herbs may be independent of the Passover offering. In doing so, it draws on the notion of redemption, mentioning different aspects of this concept in three of the nine mishnayot in the chapter.3 First, M. 10:4 is designed to make people appreciate the fact of God's deliverance. A parent is to explain the distinctiveness of Passover night by reviewing Jewish history, starting with its "disgraceful" origins and ending with its "glorious" heights."4 In addition, the parent is to undertake a separate exposition of the classical biblical section epitomizing the divine patronage and concern for Israel, Deut. 26:5 ff., "A wandering Aramean was my father..." Here the individual supplements and expands the bib- lical text.5 Second, the theme of redemption figures in M. 10:5's symbolic expan- sion of Rabban Gamaliel's teaching requiring an individual to say, i.e., to concentrate on, not to do, the characteristic elements of the rite, the Passover offering, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs. Gamaliel thereby elevates the unleavened bread and bitter herbs to the same status as the Passover offering and distances us from the physical quality of each rite. An anonymous authority, extending this trend, offers the symbolic inter- 2. See, e.g., Samuel Lowenstamm, the Tradition of the Exodus in Its Development [Hebrew], 2d ed.

For the unleavened bread he draws on the current notion that leaven connotes something spoiled or impure and explains: "'Unleavened bread'-because they were redeemed."6 Accordingly, eating unleavened bread acts out or symbolizes the liberation from destruction. The Mishnah's mention of the redemptive act provides the rationale for the next requirement, to praise and thank God for what He has done for us and our ancestors: "Therefore we are obligated to give thanks, to praise, to glorify, to crown, to exalt the One who did for us all these miracles and took us out of slavery to freedom, and let us say before Him Hallelujah" (M. 10:5 end).7 Although the participants, in referring to themselves ("for us") in addition to their "ancestors," identify with the ancient Israelites, they speak not only from the state of anxiety of the first Passover eve, awaiting the Exodus, but also from an after-the-fact situation, acknowledging the redemption. Third, M. 10:6, following up on M. 10:5's closing reference to singing Hallelujah and discussing the extent of the first portion of the Hallel section of Psalms, ensures that the psalmist's view of divine salvation is incor- porated into the evening ritual. Since the Mishnah assumes that one follows the House of Hillel, who hold, in contrast to the House of Shammai, that Psalm 114 and Psalm 113 are recited, the outlook is shaped by both psalms.8 In their choice of language referring to God, these chapters address Jews irrespective of their political situation. Psalm 113 speaks of God, enthroned on high, delivering even the lowliest individual. Psalm 114 treats the exodus of the people from Egypt, emphasizing the response of nature to that act. In particular, the comment that "mountains skipped like rams" (v. 4), referring to the Sinai revelation of the Torah, fits in with the mention that Israel became God's sanctuary and Judah His dominion (v. 2). Here the chapter follows the biblical strand that asserts that God's presence dwells on the whole people and is not limited to a single location or building. The Mishnah's focus on Hallel gains special significance once we remember that according to both the Book of Chronicles and the Mishnah and Tosefta only Temple experts such as the Levites, during the cultic activity, sang these songs. In therefore asserting that the Hallel is said as a response to the divine act, the lack of the sacrifice implicitly becomes inconsequential, and individuals, even in their nonsacrificial meal, become obligated to sing the Hallel.9 This position likewise emerges from the rabbinic requirement to make Hallel a liturgical text by surrounding it with blessings, with the closing one addressing the theme of redemption. These passages are thus designed to make people recognize the ongoing</page><page sequence="4">4 BARUCH M. BOKSER significance of the Exodus event. Since the divine act, symbolized in the unleavened bread, redeemed every generation, it continually provides benefit. Jews therefore are forever required to express their thanks to the divine redeemer. Nevertheless, although the Mishnah emphasizes the relevance of the Exodus redemption, it does not openly address the problem of the actual existence of post-70 C.E. and post-Bar Kokhba Jewry, lacking redemption and living under Roman rule without the cultic center. This disregard, however, accords with the Mishnah's overall static view of religious life, generally setting out procedures without expressly acknowledging develop- ments. M. Pesabhim 10 thus writes as if the Passover rite had never changed since Temple days. But its account differs from all previous descriptions of the celebration, which assume the centrality of the sacrifice and which make nonsacrificial elements contingent on the offering. Accordingly, the mishnaic masters, without stating what they are doing, respond to the situa- tion by redefining the role of the Passover sacrifice. As we saw in regard to Gamaliel's teaching in M. 10:4, they treat the Passover offering as just one of several equal elements. M. 10:3 exemplifies this ahistorical outlook: [A] [They] served him- [he] dips the lettuce [bazeret; i.e., the vegetables used for the bitter herbs] before he reaches the bread condiment. [B] [They] served him unleavened bread and lettuce and haroset [a mixture, e.g., of nuts, fruit, and vinegar pounded together], even though the baroset is not a mi;vah. 6. Our exegesis of this passage builds on Howard Jacobson, The Exagoge of Ezekiel (New York, 1983), pp. 128-129. See 1 Cor. 5:6-8; Matt. 16:11-12; and Bokser, Origins of the Seder, chap. 3, n. 13. 7. I follow the manuscripts in presenting the interpretation of unleavened bread third (after that of the bitter herbs) and in deleting the postmishnaic gloss (drawn from the B.T.) explicitly bidding a person to empathize with the redemption ("In every generation a person is required to regard himself as if he went out from Egypt, as it is said . . ."). See Bokser, Origins of the Seder, chap. 3, n. 13. 8. The second half of the Mishnah, including both the Akiva and Tarfon traditions, assumes that it is appropriate to mention the theme of redemption. 9. See 2 Chron 30:21, 35:15; M. Pesahim 5:5, 7, 9:3; T. Pisba 4:11 (Lieberman ed., p. 163, 1. 69), 8:22 (Lieberman ed., p. 188, 1. 72). Menalhem b. Solomon ha-Meiri, Beit ha-Behirah, Pesaihim, ed. Joseph Klein, 2d ed. (Jerusalem, 1967), p. 250, already sensed this transformation, and Meir [Ish Shalom] Friedmann, Me'ir Ayin al Seder ve-Haggadah shel leilei Pesah (Vienna, 1895), pp. 71, 72, recognized the dynamic behind the Mishnah.

Eleazar ben Zadok says, [It is a] mi;vah. [Cj id in the Temple [they] serve him the carcass of the Passover offering.'0 When we follow, in C, the readings of the manuscripts, which have "they serve," T,'K' , without the auxiliary "used to," riji, added in printed editions, we see that the text employs language commonly used to contrast practices inside and outside the Temple. The clause therefore refers not to two stages in the law but to two pre-Destruction customs: a general and ostensibly standard protocol for outside the Temple, and an added special feature for inside the holy precincts. In adding the auxiliary, making the verb into the past tense, the printed editions reflect a later outlook that turns the clause into an acknowledgment of change. This later perspective is also reflected in the postmishnaic gloss that interpolates, in B, the phrase "two cooked foods," representing the Passover and festival sacrifices. Mentioning these symbolic substitutes makes the loss of the sacrifice implicit. But this outlook differs from the Mishnah's static view. M. 10:6 provides the only apparent exception to this ahistorical perspec- tive. But on close examination it turns out to be an exception that proves the rule. It follows after Gamaliel's equation of the three Passover elements, the anonymous interpretations emphasizing the divine redemption, and the resulting requirement to thank God through the Hallel ("and let us say before Him Hallelujah"). M. 10:6 presents a dispute between R. Tarfon and R. Akiva concerning how to close the expression of gratitude. R. Tarfon says, [One says:] "Who has redeemed us and redeemed our ancestors from Egypt and brought us to this night" [some texts add: "to eat thereon unleavened bread and bitter herbs"]... R. Akiva says, [One adds to the blessing:] "Thus O LORD, our God and God of our ancestors, bring us in peace to the approaching festivals which are coming to meet us, happy in the building of Your city [some texts add: "joyous in Your service"], [so as] to eat from the Passover and festive offering whose blood will reach the wall of Your altar with favor, and let us thank You for our redemption. Praised art Thou, O LORD, Who redeemed [or "redeems"] Israel."' ' 10. See Bokser, Origins of the Seder, chap. 3, nn. 6-9 and reference there. 11. The reading "to eat thereon ... herbs" is in the Cambridge and Paris (but not the Kaufmann and Parma) MSS and early editions; "joyous in your service" is in the Cambridge,</page><page sequence="6">6 BARUCH M. BOKSER To be sure, Akiva formulates a petition that clearly alludes to the current situation preventing Jews from offering sacrifices ("bring us . . . happy in the building of Your city"). But since he expresses the new sentiment only in passing, his prayer remains tied to the passage's wider context of the Egyp- tian redemption, which is mentioned in the preceding passage closing M. 10:5, "and let us say before Him Hallelujah"; in Tarfon's text, to which Akiva adds, "Who has redeemed us and redeemed our ancestors"; and in the close of Akiva's own text, "and let us thank You for our redemption. Praised art Thou, 0 LORD, Who redeemed [or "redeems"] Israel."'2 Hence, while the prayer contains the potential for a new approach, in its present form it remains a simple hope expressed in traditional terms and hardly comes to grips with the problem posed by the contemporary his- torical reality. The Mishnah thus makes redemption a central motif but presents it primarily as an ahistorical concept and promise. It does not dwell on the dissonance undoubtedly faced by first- and second-century Jews speaking of redemption yet having suffered defeat at the hands of Rome. We may understanding this disregard by noting that it may accord with the Mishnah's overall design: by concentrating on remything the celebration and making everything independent of the Passover offering, the Mishnah responds to the related but different challenge posed by the lack of the sacri- fice, which biblically made up the foundation to the rite.'" In anachronisti- cally describing the current practice as if it had existed in Temple days, the Mishnah could hardly explicitly treat the lack of redemption; indeed, that would be counterproductive. Precisely because the Mishnah generally disregards the lack of actual redemption, in structuring the seder as a ritual it deals with the problem in a nonverbal manner. Modern scholars illuminate this notion of ritual. Jonathan Z. Smith, for example, suggests that rituals often are meaningful Parma, and Paris MSS (with slight variations); "redeems" is in the Kaufmann and Parma MSS. See Bokser, Origins of the Seder, chap. 3, nn. 14-16, and chap. 6, nn. 22-26 and text thereto, for a fuller citation of the variants and a discussion of this text. 12. This point is recognized by both E. D. Goldschmidt (The Passover Haggadah: Its Sources and History [Hebrew] [Jerusalem, 1960], pp. 56-57) and Joseph Heinemann ("Book Review of E. D. Goldschmidt's Haggadah" [Hebrew], Tarbi; 30 [1960-61]: 407), who other- wise differ in the analysis of this text. 13. Bokser, Origins of the Seder, esp. chap. 7.

The P.T.'s novel response to the issue of redemption may be discerned by focusing on seven passages.'6 First, the notion of redemption is personalized as the liberation from slavery, a perspective meaningful to individual Jews irrespective of the nation's political situation. Thus in explaining M. 10:1's requirement that everyone, even a poor person, follow the standard banquet custom of reclin- ing, we read: Said R. Levi, Because it is the custom of slaves to eat standing, here [, Passover eve, it is the custom of people] to eat reclining to proclaim that they have gone out from slavery to freedom.'7 The Mishnah's reference to a poor person has thus become a slave, transforming a social-economic category into a social-political one. 14.

BOKSER Second, the cups of wine, likewise common at banquets, though here four in number, symbolize the redemption of the individual and the group. In its exposition, the P.T. explicitly addresses the stark reality of life, assert- ing that the act of deliverance takes place not just in the past: God is des- tined to redeem Israel and vanquish the oppressor again in the future. Four comments explaining the significance of the four cups join in expressing this message, highlighted by an interpolation in the middle of the last comment. Let me review this passage.'8 1. Drawing on the example of Egypt: the four cups correspond to the four terms and dimensions of redemption used in Exodus 6:6-7. 2. Drawing on the example of Joseph, an individual redeemed from prison: the four cups correspond to four instances that the cup is mentioned in conjunction with the cupbearer's dream. 3. Drawing on the Daniel motif of four successive world empires: the four cups correspond to the four world empires, after which the Kingdom of God will come. 4. Drawing on the prophetic references to a cup: the four correspond to "four cups of retribution that the Holy One, Praised be He, will give to the nations of the world to drink." After citing ". .. a scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup" (Ps. 11:6) as the fourth verse, the explanatory gloss adds: What is "the portion of their cup"? R. Avin said, A bowl of poterion like the bowl of poterion after bathing.""9 This enigmatic text underscores the alternative uses of the divine cup. Pliny helps us understand the reference to poterion. Such a concoction, consisting of the root of the poterion bush, honey, and other ingredients, was 18.

See Bokser, Talmud, ad loc., for a discussion of the textual problems. Briefly: Leiden MS's reading of vtia D would mean a "double measure of poterion." If poterion, following an alternative meaning of the Greek word, means "cup," the phrase would then refer to a double cup, defining the exact amount of the "portion of their cup." Although this rendering is possible and may be alluded to with a play on words, we prefer the reading "vial of poterion," r-,t ,,(,). The latter is firmly grounded on the basis of the usage and readings elsewhere and the realia. See Marcus Jastrow, A Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature (New York, 1903), pp. 304a, 1140b; and n. 20 below.</page><page sequence="9">CHANGING VIEWS OF PASSOVER 9 taken to relax a person's muscles. In our case, however, the cup is harmful instead of therapeutic. We may understand this in light of rabbinic texts else- where that mention a bowl of poterion in describing the ill fate that befell several individuals. For example, Titus, after a bath, took a cup of poterion that, undoubtedly through its honey ingredient, attracted a fly that went up his nose, killing him.20 In a like manner, the divine cup will not bring bless- ings but punishments to the nations. The interpolated definition of the cup leads us into the second half of the exposition, providing a fitting closure to the whole passage. And corresponding to them [i.e., the four cups of retribution], the Holy One, Praised be He, will give Israel four cups of consolation to drink. Here we have more than the Mishnah's simple reference to redemption in the past or even to an ongoing participation in the past deliverance, for the Yerushalmi does not just explain the Mishnah, showing, for example, how the group continues to benefit from the past divine act. Rather the comments alter the focus, connecting both the individual and the group to the redemption. Moreover, they add a new dimension: instead of treating redemption only as a past event that is to be appreciated or a fact that is to be acknowledged, they dwell on the current lack of redemption, claim that the traditional apocalyptic and prophetic schemes apply to the ultimate future, and thus relate to redemption as a promise and a hope for the future. While these hopes certainly were firmly believed, they are not presented as if bearing fruit in the immediate future.2' 20. The story of Titus appears in Leviticus Rabbah 22:3 (Margulies ed., p. 501); ARNB, chap. 7 (Schechter ed., p. 27), and in part, depending on the readings, in Genesis Rabbah 10:7 (Theodor and Albeck ed., pp. 82-83). The vial of poterion and the fly likewise figure in the explanation of the sin of Pharaoh's cupbearer, in Genesis Rabbah 88:2 (Theodor and Albeck ed., p. 1078 and variants). The correction in the pericope from P.T. Pesahim 10 is confirmed by Genesis Rabbah 51:3 (Theodor and Albeck ed., pp. 534-535), which quotes Psalm 11:6 and an analogue to P.T.'s explanatory question and answer differing only in the attribution. Several manuscripts, including Vatican 60 (Midrash Bereshit Rabbah, Codex Vatican 60. A Page Index by A. P. Sherry [Jerusalem, 1972], p. 191), read 5", (or ',',,D); see Theodor and Albeck ad loc.

In this light, note a parallel to the P.T. pericope in Genesis Rabbah 88:5 (Theodor and Albeck ed., pp. 1081-1083), which contains an analogue for the four interpretations of the cups but not for the explanatory gloss to "portion of their cup." Two variations between the P.T. and</page><page sequence="10">10 BARUCH M. BOKSER Third, the symbolic interpretation of the .aroset, the delicacy into which the bitter herbs are dipped, further contributes to the concrete identification with the dynamics of redemption. In one comment, the haroset represents the mortar and thus provides a reminder of the physical burden of slavery. In another comment, it represents the blood and thus the saving act of redemption achieved through the blood.22 Hence, both reinforce the per- sonal element of redemption. Fourth, a baraita referring to four types of children and supplementing M. 10:4 offers an interesting nuance of the notion of redemption. The Mishnah mentions two types of children, one who is able to ask and one who lacks sufficient intelligence to do so, and suggests three questions concerning the main elements of the celebration. The Yerushalmi baraita, shaped by the alternative wisdom typology of four types of children, pro- vides four different explanations of the meaning of Passover. Comparing the P.T.'s versions of this text with the other versions in the Mekhilta and the Haggadah brings out the Yerushalmi's particular stress on redemption. The first variation centers on the placement of Exod. 13:14, which characterizes the redemption from Egypt as an act achieved through the LORD's "mighty hand." The P.T. employs the verse as the response to the wise child's ques- tion concerning the meaning of the "exhortations, laws, and norms" enjoined by God (Deut. 6:20). The Mekhilta and Haggadah, on the other hand, make it the answer for the simple child's question of "what is this?" As for the answer for the wise child, the latter suggest mentioning the laws of Passover, in particular M. 10:8's requirement not to end the meal with revelry (afikoman or afikomon), an attempt to dissociate the seder from a symposium.23 Evidently then, P.T. saw in the mighty act of redemption the Genesis Rabbah may be significant. First, the P.T.'s use of the verbal form - r'n instead of Genesis Rabbah's simple future in the form of the participle, ,in, may emphasize the future element. Second, the P.T.'s calling of the cups given to Israel "cups of consolation," mnrm, instead of Genesis Rabbah's "cups of deliverance," ,raw, the word used in the last proof-text, from Psalm 116:13, may direct the hopes in a manner that tempers the messianic anticipation. The B.T., in contrast to the P.T. and Genesis Rabbah, does not offer extensive symbolic interpretations of the four cups. At most, an anonymous authority, at 108a, believes that the cups connote freedom. (The reference at 109b bottom is a post-talmudic gloss interepolated into Ravina's comment; see Raphaelo Rabbinovicz, Variae Lectiones in Mishchnam et in Talmud Babylonicum, 15 vols.

The second variation lies in the language in the question and answer associated with the evil child. The P.T. has him contemptuously speaking of "what is this rite [avodah] of yours" (Exod. 12:26) with the words, "what is this bother [torah] that you impose on us every year," a characterization that the Mekhilta and Haggadah lack. Of special significance is the formula- tion of the response. While all three see the evil child as excluding himself from the group, they differ in describing his exclusion from redemption. The P.T. states, "If that person had been in Egypt he would never have been worthy [ra'ui] to be redeemed from there."24 The Mekhilta and Haggadah, by contrast, speak of being actually redeemed: "he would not have been redeemed." P.T.'s preference thus stresses meriting redemption, whenever it might arrive, in place of an emphasis on the actual onset of the deliverance.25 This understanding of the Yerushalmi's approach receives support from the next P.T. section. Fifth, the end of M. 10:4, elicits two thoughts concerning the nature of redemption. First, explaining the Mishnah's instruction to a parent to "start [reading] with the disgrace [section of the Bible] and end with the glory," the P.T. comments with the following reference to the initial history of the Jews: Ray said, As with the [very] beginning [gloss in Leiden: "(one) is required to start with"], "In olden times, your ancestors-even Terah, father of Abraham and father of Nahor-lived beyond the Euphrates," etc. ["and worshipped other gods"]. "But I took your father Abraham from beyond the Euphrates," etc. [= "and led him through the whole land of Canaan"] "and multiplied" [va'arbe(h)] ["his offspring. I gave him Isaac.. ."] [Joshua 24:2-4].26 The choice of Joshua 24 to describe early Israelite history is significant. As Yehezkel Kaufmann observes, this chapter treats the history in a distinc- 24.

BOKSER tive manner, focusing on the Israelites' giving up of idolatry and clinging to God. This theme is mentioned in the quoted verses and at the chapter's end, which speaks of the present task before the Israelites.27 The standard alter- native definition of the notion of disgrace and redemption, coming from Deut. 26, deals with the more common view of Israelite history retelling the Egyptian slavery and the national redemption. The P.T.'s inclusion of only the former interpretation centering on Joshua 24, in contrast to the B.T.'s mention of it along with the standard alternative, may not be arbitrary, for it fits the Palestinian situation under Roman subjugation. Indeed, the per- ception of Passover as a liberation from false ideas and ideologies would entail less dissonance among Passover celebrants than a message of politi- cal freedom.!8 Joshua 24's overall message to convince the Israelites to remain faithful to God is brought out in an exegesis appended to this biblical text. The P.T. contains two explanations of the word K1xi, usually read as if written ,mani (va'arbeh), with a final he, and rendered "I multiplied." The comments, however, read the word defectively, as printed in the Bible, taking va'areb in the sense of either a test or an ambush. According to the former rendering, the text, emphasizing the fact that faith requires a person to endure tests, reminds the participants that God repeatedly tested Abraham before giving him the child Isaac. According to the latter, in speaking of an ambush, God indicates that He stood in wait to see how Abraham would act. If Abraham sinned he would get his reward, that is, his punishment. But if he proved righteous, vindicating himself, he would receive a different type of reward. The passage reads: Said R. Aba, wim is written: How many tests did I test him before I gave him Isaac. Another matter: I became in regard to him [i.e., to Abraham] an ambush-if he sinned to give him [his due], and if he justified [himself] to give him [his due-a child, Isaac, as his reward].29 27.

The fact that the tradition is attributed to the Babylonian Rav in itself is not problematic. First, the P.T. chose to include this teaching. Second, the passage may be an instance of what scholars claim to be the tendency of Rav, who studied in Palestine, to represent the Palestinian position or to be sensitive to the Palestinian situation. 29. See Bokser, Talmud, ad loc.</page><page sequence="13">CHANGING VIEWS OF PASSOVER 13 Both interpretations underscore the notion that Israel in its history has not just received grants and experienced redemption but has also faced crises testing its faith and has lived up to a standard. By implication, later Jews too must vindicate themselves in their faith in order to receive their due. Sixth, the P.T. to M. 10:6, treating the dispute in regard to the extent of the Hallel, emphasizes the cogency of the Hillelite view that both Psalms 113 and 114 are recited. While to some degree adjudications of the Mishnah such as this fall within the range of expected comments on the Mishnah, the fact remains that initially the Mishnah presents both as viable options and only implicitly favors the Hillelite view, which in particular, as we saw above, speaks to Jews irrespective of their political situation. But in addition to making the last point explicit, the Yerushalmi, by citing and glossing a baraita that explains the two opinions, may also read something into the dispute. According to the P.T., the House of Shammai hold that the rite must strictly follow the sequence of the original Exodus. Since the Israelites did not leave Egypt until the morning after the evening gathering around the Passover offering, Jews should not thank the LORD for redemption until the day of Passover. The Hillelites, however, reject this logic. According to P.T.'s anonymous amoraic gloss, it is not just an issue of the historical record: "One who starts with a mi;vah, they tell him, 'Finish it.' " Hence, even though people may not have experienced "even half of the redemp- tion," if they can start saying something, then they must finish it. Surely, this attitude accords with the other P.T. comments in freeing the notion of redemption from being a simple acknowledgment of past divine acts. Seventh, in providing a proof-text for the saying of Hallel, the P.T. indi- cates that God may act without bringing an immediate comprehensive redemption. The passage, relevant to both M. 10:6 and 7, reads: [A] It is written, "In exacting retribution for Israel, when people offer will- ingly-Praise the LORD" [Judg. 5:2]. Let the heads of the people offer willingly-when the Holy One, Praised be He, does miracles for them-[that is,] they should sing a song. [B] [They objected, challenging the principle in A:] Lo, [what of the redemp- tion of] Mordechai and Esther [when Hallel is not said]? [C] It is a different [there], for they were outside the Land [of Israel].</page><page sequence="14">14 BARUCH M. BOKSER [D] They objected, Lo, what of the Egyptian redemption [which also occurred outside the Land but- for which Hallel is said]? [E] It is a different [there], for it was the beginning of their redemption [which was completed when they entered the Land of Israel]. [F] And there are those who want to say [as an alternativel to C] that Mordechai and Esther were redeemed from their enemies but were not redeemed from the [foreign] government. [This explanation for the lack of hymns removes the basis for D's question.]30 This text yields two relevant observations. First, the present use of A may contribute toward redefining the meaning of Hallel and the Passover rite. Hallel is a human response appropriate not just for a full redemption such as the Exodus experience; what is crucial about the Exodus is that God did miracles for Israel-not that He redeemed the people. The second observation emerges from B-F. While it does not strictly accord with the previous proposition, it ends up making a similar overall point. The case of Mordechai and Esther indicates that the notion of "redemption" must be distinguished from the relief Israel may gain from an oppressor or some similar divine intervention in Israel's behalf. Hence, while true redemption might be something that only the distant future brings (as we saw above in the exposition of the four cups), a Purim event is something that can still be hoped for. While such an event may not merit the recitation of Hallel, that does not change the fact that people experience a respite from oppression. Moreover, the case of the Egyptian exodus indi- cates that something not initially appearing to be a real redemption might yet turn out to be one. Both of these cases in different ways thus offer a basis for hope. Accordingly, while B-F may differ with A-or limit its prin- 30.

Reviewing these seven sections of the P.T. demonstrates the P.T.'s direct approach to the issue of redemption. While in part it follows the Mishnah's perspective, seeing redemption, symbolized in the unleavened bread, as a central fact of Jewish experience and affecting every generation, overall it represents a departure from the Mishnah. First, the P.T. brings out the point that redemption is not just a single event in the past that has affected all later history. Rather it makes the concept meaningful on an individual level that transcends history. Thus it repeatedly emphasizes the symbolic nature of rituals; it speaks of the liberation, for example, of a slave from slavery instead of the redemption of the whole group; and it defines redemption as the release from the false ideology of idolatry. Second and even more significant, the Yerushalmi, in openly treating the problem posed by the current lack of redemption, presents a message strikingly fitting the situation of Jews living under a foreign power like Rome and having little hope for immediate divine intervention. This is reflected in the above-mentioned definition of redemption as liberation from idolatry, something for which Jews, irrespective of adverse current political situations, may remain thankful. This theme is even clearer in the interpretations of the four cups of wine, which employ prophetic and apocalyptic motifs to suggest that the full redemption will materialize not soon but in the distant future. At that time God will pour from His cup of bounty for Israel and from His cup of wrath for the nations oppressing Israel. Moreover, the P.T. makes clear that the Passover experience teaches that individuals must become worthy of redemption and act in a manner to merit it. In thus asserting that a crisis may actually represent a divine trial, it encourages and challenges any generation or individual desiring divine help. In addition, in suggesting that a deliverance short of an immediate interven- tion and comprehensive redemption exists, it provides alternative models of divine assistance for which people may aspire. The Yerushalmi thus provides a variety of approaches to the problem of redemption. Since such a divergence exists, the comments undoubtedly derive not from a single unified effort but from a common perspective that tries directly to cope with the current political-religious situation. This concern actually fits into a wider outlook. In contrast to the Mishnah as a whole, the P.T. does not try to give the impression that the rabbinic rite merely continues the pre-70 celebration held outside the Temple, but expressly acknowledges that a gulf separates contemporary practice from</page><page sequence="16">16 BARUCH M. BOKSER that of Temple days.3' Therefore, as part of that recognition, it can fully deal with the disparity between the ideal and reality. The interest in redemption and the recognition of a discontinuity in religious practice are also found in the other postmishnaic work, the Baby- lonian Talmud. But the Bavli differs from the Yerushalmi in the way in which it develops these materials. I have noted several features of that approach, but a discussion of it on its own terms must await a separate occasion. Our observations regarding the P.T.'s handling of the concept of redemp- tion have broader implications concerning the history of Judaism.32 We have pointed to one aspect of the difference between mishnaic and post- mishnaic Judaism. The Mishnah's perspective, while quite influential, did not determine the Yerushalmi's approach. Similarly, interpreting and explaining the Mishnah's teachings did not circumscribe the thinking of the postmishnaic masters. Rather the latter drew upon the Mishnah for a repertoire of subjects and extended its themes in new ways, often transform- ing them and making them fit a very different perspective.33 Scholars such as Nahum Glatzer, Jacob Neusner, E. E. Urbach, and Judah Goldin who have studied the history of redemption and messianic ideas in late antiquity have marshaled other evidence to highlight related third-century developments.34 31. See Baruch M. Bokser, "Rabbinic Responses to Catastrophe: From Continuity to Discontinuity," Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research 50 (1983). As part of recognizing the gulf, the P.T. here-as elsewhere-becomes open to articulating the symbolic dimension of religious life. See the materials discussed in Baruch M. Bokser, "Recent Developments in the Study of Judaism 70-200 C.E.," The Second Century 3 (1983): 2.C. 32. Our results regarding the P.T.'s concentrated focus on redemption and its selection and treatment of traditions, which together make up a coherent and distinctive message, are in accord with the notion that the P.T. editors imposed their point of view on the contents when they selected the material, in particular those portions transmitted from Babylonia. Hence, we are justified in drawing historical conclusions from the literary evidence. See Saul Lieberman, The Talmud of Caesarea, Supplement to Tarbi; 2, 4 [Hebrew] (Jerusalem, 1931), pp. 22-23; and Baruch M. Bokser, Post Mishnaic Judaism in Transition (Chico, Calif., 1980), p. 469 and nn. 33. See Bokser, Post Mishnaic Judaism, esp. pp. 467-482. 34. Nahum N.

This explains why third- and fourth-century literary and artistic sources portray an idealized view of the messianic or future world-to-come and a glorified vision of the Temple and Jerusalem. As the memory of the Temple faded and its restoration no longer formed an actual hope for the present reality, people thought about and described the future in more imaginary terms.35 Let me review our results to show how the P.T.'s treatment of Passover may reflect this posture. First, we see the concern for redemption along with the implication that redemption will not immediately occur. Here the Yeru- shalmi draws on and adapts the two biblical strands differing over the place of redemption in the divine scheme. According to one strand, redemption requires Israel's merit; according to the other, it will come automatically as a result of the divine promises. Following the first strand, rabbis emphasized the importance of merit to encourage penitence and to stress that individual human acts can be signifi- cant. Passages such as the answer to the evil child and the exegesis of Joshua 24 illustrate this approach. On the other hand, rabbis also responded to the strong attraction for the alternative point of view, giving prominence to the notion that God will compassionately live up to His promises.36 The interpretation of the four cups of wine vividly exemplifies this trend. But even when setting out these teachings, the P.T. does not specify when that future will materialize. Rather it appears to be part of the indefinite future. Although the individual comments emphasize one or another aspect of these two positions, the P.T. as a whole, by juxtaposing both outlooks, integrates both positions, perhaps suggesting that each conveys part of the truth. tion in Judaism" (Paper delivered at the Thirteenth Annual Meeting of the Association for Jewish Studies, Boston, Mass., December 1981). 35. See nn. 13 and 22 above. It is for this reason that scholars such as Urbach can rightly criticize the treatment by Avi-Yonah (The Jews of Palestine [Oxford, 1976, trans. and adapted from the Hebrew eds. of 1946, 1952, 1962, 1969], pp. 127-132) as too schematic, undifferen- tiated, and therefore inaccurate. 36. See, e.g., Urbach, Sages, pp. 668-671, 683; and Jacob Neusner, Eliezer Ben Hyrcanus, 2 vols. (Leiden, 1973), 1:477-479, 2:418. The treatment of Abraham's binding of Isaac, the Akedah, provides a vivid example of the increased emphasis on God living up to His promises; see Dan Ben-Amos, "The Akedah: A Folklorist's Response," in The Biblical Mosaic, ed. Robert Polzin and Eugene Rothman (Philadelphia and Chico, Calif., 1982), pp. 166-167.</page><page sequence="18">18 BARUCH M. BOKSER While the future redemption is sure, it is not immediate. Likewise, by requir- ing merit, it both encourages people to become worthy of redemption and suggests that redemption on its own is not shortly about to burst forth.37 Second, the P.T. may reflect a wider outlook in speaking to Jews on two different levels of consciousness. It structures the rite so that the participants in the celebration both experience a sense of redemption and also look to the future for a comprehensive realization of their hopes-hopes which they are to verbalize. Individual Jews are thus to believe that if they merit it, they will share in the great consolation and vindication, whenever it comes. Mean- while, they may feel that other forms of redemption remain valid. Jews are not slaves; they are free from their enemies and persecutors; they are liber- ated from false religious beliefs. In addressing these divergent aspects of redemption, the P.T. thus not only interprets the religious rites of Passover in light of traditional notions and current trends, but also makes its own contribution, mediating between opposing perspectives. This conclusion brings us to Scholem's observation that deferring the full realization of a better life to the future characterizes rabbinic attitudes to messianism in general. Our study suggests that this position took root in the postmishnaic period, in certain Palestinian circles. We must, however, also note that deferment is not the complete story. As we have seen, seder participants, aware of the gulf otherwise separating them from the ideal, actualize aspects of redemption in the ritual. Similarly, if they follow the P.T. version of the rite, they minimize those features of the celebration causing dissonance in their own lives. In the P.T.'s program, the lack of redemption-and not the lack of the Temple and sacrificial cult- causes the problem. Nevertheless, even in this personalized dimension of redemption which addresses each individual, since the participants see themselves as part of the whole, the group character of Judaism remains in effect. In this sense Scholem is correct that redemption is not "in the private world of each individual."38 Dropsie College Merion, Pa. 37. See n. 25 above. 38. Scholem, "Messianic Idea in Judaism," p. 1. I am appreciative of the critical comments of Lawrence H. Schiffman and Robert Goldenberg, who read earlier drafts of this paper; and of the constructive suggestions of the participants at the Annual Meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature, December 19, 1982, where an earlier version of this study was delivered, and of the anonymous reviewers for the AJS Review.</page></plain_text>
