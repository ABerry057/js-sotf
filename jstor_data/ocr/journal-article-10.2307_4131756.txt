New York: New York Universi- ty Press (in association with the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies), 2001. viii, 363 pp. Jerusalem is an ancient venue that has been not only a symbol of peace and a focus of religious belief but also a city of dispute. For centuries, indeed millen- nia, it has been a magnet for conflict between diverse groups with divergent reli- gious interests and others with competing political and/or national claims. It is sacred to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and claimed as a national capitol by both Israelis and Palestinian Arabs. Since the mid-1950s it has been a central issue of the Arab-Israeli conflict that emerged to be even more problematic after the Six Day War of 1967, in which Israel gained full control over the entire city that had been divided between it and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in the first Arab- Israeli war of 1948-1949. In recent years it has became the ultimate issue among the final settlement stumbling blocks for an Israeli-Palestinian peace. It has served as a pretext for Osama bin Laden and as a concern for Muslim regimes as diverse as Iran and Saudi Arabia because of Jewish control over Muslim holy places, in this instance the third holiest site in Islam, after Mecca and Medina. The author has taken on himself a difficult and complex task: to examine Jerusalem as a contested city; he deals with various aspects of the city and its po- litical history in Arab-Israeli relations since the 1960s. Using a multidisciplinary approach (history, political science, geography, city planning, sociology, and in- ternational relations) he seeks to dispel many of the myths that shape the discourse and to examine the political and religious fault lines relating to Jerusalem. He pre- sents the geographical and urban reality and its historical background; he describes how Jerusalem fared during the Israel-Egypt peace negotiations of 1977-79; he analyzes the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations from the early 1980s to the Declara- tion of Principles negotiated in Oslo and signed in Washington in 1993. He con- siders the role and the concerns of both the Arab League and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, as well as those of Jordan, concerning the city's Islamic holy places. Klein also analyzes the Palestinians' position and relations between their local representatives and national institutions. He discusses the "Palestinian identity of East Jerusalem" as well as Israeli policy and actions under both Labor and Likud governments. Klein is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Political Science at Bar-Ilan University and a Board Member of B'tselem, the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories that is generally critical of Israeli gov- ernment policies and actions in the occupied territories. He is also a Researcher at the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies. As with most writers on the subject of Jerusalem and the Arab-Israeli conflict the author (indeed, the reviewer as well) is not wholly objective or dispassionate, and one might ask whether anyone can be. His views are those of the left-of-center in Israel's political spectrum and these are reflected in his work. The blurb on the book jacket notes: "indeed the Al-Aqsa In- tifada was precipitated by a visit to Jerusalem's most holy Muslim site by Ariel Sharon." This not only points to the contemporary importance of the city, but also clearly identifies the perspective of the author, who does not note that Sharon's vis- 396</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews it was to a Jewish holy site on the Temple Mount and approved by the Israeli Gov- ernment. The book is dense, loaded with arguments, data, information, analyses, and points of view. There are lots of details (it is well, if not overly, documented- sometimes to the point of obscuring the story and the analysis). It makes for diffi- cult reading; the arguments are hard to follow, and the organization of the work is trying. It provides the reader with a wealth of usually accurate and useful infor- mation, but despite, or perhaps because of, the overwhelming amount of informa- tion provided, the author has a problem in communicating clearly his ideas and proposals as the reader is overwhelmed with references and notes. Nevertheless various assertions remain undocumented. Curiously, while the city is holy to all three monotheistic faiths, there is little discussion of Christian or Jewish holy places. Indeed the index does not even list the Temple, and the Temple Mount list- ing provides a cross-reference to the section on Islamic Holy Places. Although he seeks to dispel myths, he seems to contribute to some even while deflating others. Primary sources are not often used although he notes a wide range of documents and sources in English, Hebrew, and Arabic. Israeli and Hebrew language sec- ondary sources are widely and liberally used even to the point where discussion of United States policy is often based on and refers to Israeli newspaper sources. This is particularly surprising given the ready availability of official and primary U.S. government sources in print and online. His maps are good and useful. The author purports to describe the reality of the situation as a basis for a future practical so- lution. The work further amplifies the issues in concern but does not offer a com- promise solution that is possible and practical. The author's optimism about the future abounds. He argues that "the foun- dation laid at Camp David will constitute a reference framework for all future arrangements, since its basis is solid" (5). Nevertheless, he admits that "when guns are blasting and people dying it is hard to see how the two sides can begin to ne- gotiate again, in order to complete what they began in Camp David" (5). The af- termath of Camp David II with the al-Aksa Intifada and escalation in the early months of 2002 seem to endorse this sentiment and raise serious doubts about op- timism concerning the future of Jerusalem. Specialists and students will find this work contributes some new ideas and perspectives on old issues. Bernard Reich George Washington University Washington, DC</page></plain_text>
